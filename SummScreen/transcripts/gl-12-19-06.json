        "Dinah: Oh, what did you get me?",
        "Mallet: Who says I got you anything? I'm still trying to decide if you've been naughty or nice. And stop peeking, you've been peeking all day. You're still a kid.",

        "Mallet: I do, too. (Cell phone rings) I've got to take this. It's work. Mallet. That's not good, when did that happen? Okay, I'll be right there. No, no, that's fine, I'll be right there. Thanks. I got to go.",
        "Dinah: What is it? Is it a homicide or a robbery?",
        "Mallet: Are you asking me as the woman who loves me and who is worried that I might get shot? Or are you asking me as a rival television personality?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Lillian is passed out with Sarah in your bed. Kind of sweet.",
        "Lizzie: I hate to wake them up.",
        "Jonathan: Then don't. You can sleep in my bed, I'll sleep on the couch, I've got some blankets.",
        "Lizzie: I had a great time tonight.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it was something.",
        "Lizzie: I was thinking...",
        "Jonathan: Uh-oh, don't hurt yourself.",
        "Lizzie: I was thinking that was really fun, to get out like a real married couple, and I don't know why it has to stop.",
        "Jonathan: Stop?",
        "Lizzie: We're husband and wife. Why does the night have to end with you in one room and me in another? I think that we should be together. Come on, come to my room. I want to be with you.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, we can't just jump into bed like a bunch of crazy...",
        "Lizzie: What, married people?",
        "Jonathan: What if, you know, Sarah wakes up or Lillian?",
        "Lizzie: I'll try to be quiet.",
        "Jonathan: I meant, what if Sarah needs us?",
        "Lizzie: She's with nana. Nana is a nurse. What is it, me? Look, I know that I have a couple of pounds to lose since the baby...",
        "Jonathan: No, no. Lizzie, you look great. You look great. It's just...",
        "Lizzie: Just what?",

        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, I know that you have needs.",
        "Jonathan: It's okay.",
        "Lizzie: No, it's not okay. Look at me, I am here. And I want to be more than just your baby's mom. I want to give Sarah the family that you never had. You know? Warm and loving and real.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I want Sarah to have a real family, too.",
        "Lizzie: Kids know when their parents are pretending, and I don't want to pretend anymore. I want you to make love to me. I think it's what we both need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Remember, stay out of sight, let Mallet do his police stuff, and then we're going to swoop in and take the human interest angle.",
        "Doug: Is that a priest?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. All right, so...",
        "Mallet: Alright, Father, so, the name of the orphanage again?",
        "Father Ray: Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow. Fitting, isn't it?",
        "Mallet: Boy, I'll say. So, once again, no sign of forced entry, but all of the toys are missing from under the Christmas tree.",
        "Mike: Even my basketball. I found all of the wrapping paper off.",
        "Mallet: Really? I'll tell you what, I'm going to get that basketball back for you. I'm going to make this case a top priority.",
        "Dinah: If he thinks he is going to one-up me with a tear- jerker story, he's got another thing coming. Okay, zoom in, hurray, get everybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'm sorry, I'm just really not in the mood for this.",
        "Marina: Trust me. I know what's best for you. Where is that gorgeous little girl?",
        "Harley: Where do you think, Gus is hogging her as usual.",
        "Gus: You want to see who it is. It's your cousin Marina.",
        "Marina: Hey, Sydney.",
        "Gus: I want to go over there.",
        "Marina: Come here, look who it is. Hi.",
        "Gus: She's eating the camera and she's had the milk.",

        "Tammy: Oh, she's beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, what are you doing in there, scrubbing all your sins away? Just kidding. Hey. Hey. Oh, it's cold out here, get under the covers. Why am I on top of the covers? Music. Hi.",
        "Jonathan: Wow.",
        "Lizzie: Really? You think?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I think.",
        "Lizzie: Look at what's chilling. It's not champagne. It's beer.",
        "Jonathan: A woman after my own heart. You want one?",
        "Lizzie: I want you.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Just wait, just listen, okay. I have been waiting for a night like this, hoping for a night like this. Just think of it as the honeymoon we never had.",
        "Jonathan: You deserve a real honeymoon with someone who is more-- you know, in some tropical setting.",
        "Lizzie: No, no. Okay, I don't need Paris, and I don't need Maui. I just need you. You care about me, right?",
        "Jonathan: Of course I do.",
        "Lizzie: And we made something beautiful together, that little girl.",
        "Jonathan: The best thing I've ever made.",
        "Lizzie: Me, too, and I love Sarah, more than Roxy, more than anyone. And I have her because of you.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Listen, my granddad told me that you were never going to really love me because you'll always want Tammy.",
        "Jonathan: Alan was...",
        "Lizzie: Listen. I understand what it is like to love someone like that, because that's how I love you.",
        "Jonathan: I know what you want me to say, but I...",
        "Lizzie: No, you don't. I will never ask you to stop loving Tammy. I'm just asking you to let me love you. I think that in time, as much as you love Sarah, that you'll come to love me, too, just a little bit.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, you're not that hard to love.",
        "Lizzie: Really?",
        "Jonathan: No, not hard at all.",
        "Lizzie: Then show me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to take every police officer and put them on this case until every single present is returned.",
        "Kids: Yay!",
        "Father Ray: Okay, guys, let's not get our hopes up too high. The nice policemen's going to do his best, okay?",
        "Dinah: Boy did this show become a sentimental show. My audience is going to eat this up. You go ahead, you zoom in. We're going to do this better. Zoom in, zoom in.",
        "Jessica: Why is your cameraman hiding?",
        "Mallet: Hmm? Where?",
        "Jessica: There.",
        "Mallet: Well, would you look at that? That would be my girlfriend and her pesky camera crew. Everybody say, \"Hi, pesky.\" Hi, pesky. What are you doing here?",
        "Dinah: We were passing by.",
        "Mallet: Oh, really?",
        "Dinah: Mm-mm. We were on our way to cover other story and we noticed you and these sweet children.",
        "Mallet: You're going to have to turn that off because this is official police business.",
        "Dinah: Well, that didn't stop you and \"The Law\" from taping it. You know, this is a human interest story, and it belongs on my show. How about you kids being on a real TV show, you think you would like that?",
        "Kids: Yeah!",
        "Dinah: Yeah, now who is the best crier of the bunch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Wow, she's so much bigger than...",
        "Marina: She is not supposed to make you think of Jonathan's baby.",
        "Tammy: Sorry. She is beautiful Harley.",
        "Harley: Thank you. I wish I could take credit for that. Look at her face. I love when she makes that face.",
        "Tammy: Sarah makes the same...",
        "Gus: She likes the camera. There you go.",
        "Tammy: You take her. Thank you for letting me hold her. I think I should probably... I should probably go.",
        "Harley: Okay. Look, look... I feel so bad for her.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Um, Coop? Don't leave without saying good- bye, please.",
        "Coop: You're leaving already?",
        "Marina: Yeah. I have some business I have to take care of.",
        "Coop: Okay, all right.",
        "Marina: Bye, best friend.",
        "Coop: Bye.",
        "Tammy: Bye.",
        "Zach: Can I put this under the tree?",
        "Harley: Sure, who is that for?",
        "Zach: Sydney, so she won't feel bad.",
        "Gus: Why would she feel bad?",
        "Zach: About not being a real kid.",
        "Harley: (Laughs) Well, that is very sweet. But just because somebody is adopted doesn't mean that mommy and daddy love them less than any other kids.",
        "Ava: I was adopted.",
        "Zach: You were?",
        "Ava: I was. And my mom, the lady who adopted me, she loved me very, very much.",
        "Zach: What happened to your real parents?",
        "Coop: Zach, that doesn't matter now.",
        "Ava: I just got to know who my real parents are.",
        "Zach: Do you love them?",
        "Ava: Well, I probably wouldn't have chosen them, if I had a choice, but I guess I'm just getting to know them.",
        "Zach: Maybe you'll get to know them by next Christmas.",
        "Ava: Maybe.",
        "Coop: Zach, I tell you what, you don't have to worry about that. I'm going to make sure that Ava has a Christmas to remember in England.",
        "Alan-Michael: Seems like a long way to go for eggnog and cookies. But hey, I guess Coop knows what's best for you. Where's my niece?",
        "Gus: She's right here.",
        "Alan-Michael: How is she doing?",
        "Gus: Good.",
        "Alan-Michael: Look at that face. You get prettier every time I see you. Yeah. You realize I'm already mapping out her future at the company.",
        "Gus: Yeah? Well, I think she is going to be a biophysicist or a doctor.",
        "Alan-Michael: Oh, really?",
        "Gus: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Harley: Hello. Hey, Mel, I'm assuming you're calling with adoption news. How did I know that was going to happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Here you are. I want to know what you've been up to tonight.",
        "Alan: Beth, you're going to have to learn to trust me. I've been doing a little match making.",
        "Beth: Between whom?",
        "Alan: Jonathan and Tammy.",
        "Beth: Oh, Alan.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth is not going to leave him until she realizes what a louse he truly is.",
        "Beth: And just how do you intend on making her realize that?",
        "Alan: I happen to know that they're not sleeping together. And why is that? Because he's in love with another woman, Tammy. So all we have to do is kind of nudge him in that direction.",
        "Beth: No. I won't let you do this. This is wrong.",
        "Alan: Beth, you lost your moral high ground in a hotel room, remember? You'll play along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You should go back to Harley's and spend more time with Coop.",
        "Marina: Not until you tell me what in the world is going on between you and Jonathan. We'll take two beers, please. And you can keep them coming. Thanks. I thought seeing that baby was going to make you happy.",
        "Tammy: It did.",
        "Marina: Oh, please, no, stop smiling so much. You're really starting to frighten me.",
        "Tammy: It's just that Sydney reminded me of Jonathan's little girl.",
        "Marina: I know.",
        "Tammy: I know how much Jonathan wants to be a good dad. That's why I feel so guilty.",
        "Marina: Guilty? What in the world do you have to feel guilty about? You gave the guy up, right?",
        "Tammy: I did, until tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, look, I'm not trying to pressure you. Come here. I'm not going to pounce on you. I just want to help you feel relaxed with me. We could just hold each other.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Lizzie: We'll make a rule, okay? No touching, just holding.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, wait. I really have to tell you something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcy Rylan, \"Inside The Light.\" If I wasn't an actor, I would be going to law school. Secret about myself? I'm terrified of interviews. See Lizzie, Wednesday, December 20, \"Inside The Light.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You have no idea how much that means to me. We're going to be there forever.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Look, you've been really honest with me tonight, and that's great. And I want to do the same, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: You're very important to me. And you look hot, hot in your... you know, whatever you call it.",
        "Lizzie: Nightie.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. I don't want to be with you just because we have a marriage license, you know, or just because you want me to.",
        "Lizzie: I'm okay with that.",
        "Jonathan: No, you're not. No, you're not. You want me to mean it, and I'm going to have to do that on my own time in my own way.",
        "Lizzie: Oh! Why do you have to pick tonight to become so damned honest?",
        "Jonathan: You want a real marriage. So do I. It's just not going to happen overnight.",
        "Lizzie: Or ever.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, you know me. If I didn't care about you, I would pin you to this bed and you wouldn't leave it for a week. Yeah. But I care. I do care.",
        "Lizzie: Great.",
        "Jonathan: Stop it. I want this to be right. And you know, I can offer you something even better than sex.",
        "Lizzie: What's better than sex? This better be good.",
        "Jonathan: Fully inverted forks. Ready to rip.",
        "Lizzie: That is so hot.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: You're really going to let me ride on the back?",
        "Jonathan: You're my wife. We share everything, right?",
        "Lizzie: Right, let's go.",
        "Jonathan: Hold on. Come here. Fix your hair. There we go. Got to make sure nothing happens to Sarah's mom.",
        "Lizzie: You're such a safe driver.",
        "Jonathan: Ha!",
        "Lizzie: Jonathan, you are, right?",
        "Jonathan: I think so, I don't know. Hop on and find out.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, great! (Laughs)",
        "Jonathan: You've got to hold on.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: Tighter, tighter. There you go. (Motorcycle engine roars)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Okay, look, it's not like Jonathan and I meant to make love in the barn, it just happened.",
        "Marina: Right, your bodies just smacked into each other.",
        "Tammy: I swear, it happened like that, okay? One minute he's telling me to leave him alone, and the next... being with him again, it was everything. I mean, we were together again.",
        "Marina: What happened after?",
        "Tammy: He went home with Lizzie.",
        "Marina: His wife.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Marina: And he left you in the barn to pick the hay out of your sweater.",
        "Tammy: Okay, it wasn't like that. I don't know what it means.",
        "Marina: Tammy, it means that you're completely out of your mind. Look at what you're doing to yourself. You're driving yourself absolutely insane. You've been depressed all night. You keep checking that phone every 3.2 seconds, praying he is going to call you.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I'm not praying.",
        "Marina: Jonathan is a grown man with a wife and a kid.",
        "Tammy: I know.",
        "Marina: And it's probably going to stay like that, all right? So if you just sit around for the rest of your life waiting...",
        "Tammy: I'll be the other woman.",
        "Marina: No, you'll be a sucker. Tammy, I was in your shoes, okay? I know what it's like. And I could have waited for Danny to choose me over Michelle and the baby. But you know what? I didn't want that. I didn't want that for him. I didn't want it for them, and above all, to be honest, I really didn't want it for myself.",
        "Tammy: Okay, but Jonathan doesn't want to be with Lizzie. He wants to be with me. He only married her for Sarah.",
        "Marina: I know all of that. But you need a friend here who's going to actually ask you all the questions that no one else will. How is this going to work? Not for Jonathan or Lizzie, but for you?",
        "Tammy: I don't know.",
        "Marina: Do you think that he'll leave Lizzie and the baby?",
        "Tammy: I don't know.",
        "Marina: Do you want him to?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I... I don't know. I don't know!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mallet: Okay, okay, come on. Enough, enough. I called for backup. You're going to have to pack up this traveling little circus here and move on or I'm going to have to...",
        "Dinah: Or what? What are you going to do? You going to arrest us just for me helping a priest and some kids get some toys back?",
        "Father Ray: Come on guys, it's Christmas.",
        "Dinah: You know what, tell scrooge that. He doesn't want to share.",
        "Mallet: Excuse me, fair lady, but I'm trying to investigate a theft, okay, and you're impeding upon my police business here.",
        "Dinah: Fine. Go ahead, arrest me, handcuff me to a wall.",
        "Mike: Wow.",
        "Jessica: Cool.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, Doug, start rolling. My show is going to be number one, and it's going to kick your butt off the schedule.",
        "Mallet: Okay... stop. This isn't about doing television shows. This is about solving a crime.",
        "Dinah: The only crime would be is if your show won over mine.",
        "Father Ray: Mikey, what are you doing?",
        "Mike: Betting to see if she goes down or not.",
        "Father Ray: Give me that. Guys, it's late. I better get the kids back. But thank you. Both of you, thanks.",
        "Mallet: Father, I'll call you the minute I have anything.",
        "Father ray: Great, you do that. Please, come on.",
        "Dinah: Okay, Doug, we're still rolling?",
        "Doug: Rolling.",
        "Dinah: Okay, ready? Hi, I'm Dinah Marler, your \"Light On Springfield,\" bringing to you a tragic story of loss. Someone stole all of the presents from a children's orphanage here in town today. There are some sad, sad children here tonight, as you can see. But what I'm asking you to do is to do something that the police can't: To find the toys. Please, don't let somebody steal Christmas from these poor, poor children.",
        "Mallet: She's laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?",
        "Dinah: Officer Mallet is in over his head. You need to help him help the kids. Please give him a call at 555-1212. This is his personal cell phone number. He wants you to have it. Please share any information you have at all. Call us with any sort of tip. Thank you. Anything to give joy to the children, right Detective Mallet?",
        "Mallet: Uh-huh.",

        "Gus: Yeah, you're losing a personal assistant, but look at it this way: You're gaining a niece, huh?",
        "Harley: This is bad, Mel. What am I supposed to tell Gus?",
        "Alan-Michael: She is a heartbreaker. When you're old enough, I'll tell you how to handle guys.",
        "Gus: Yeah, guys like you.",
        "Alan-Michael: Me?",
        "Gus: Yeah, you.",
        "Alan-Michael: I've lost my touch. Ava's leaving.",
        "Coop: Oh, Alan-Michael, you don't have to take that personally. She just got a better offer.",
        "Ava: I am going to miss the job, though, all of the excitement at Spaulding.",
        "Alan-Michael: You could always stay.",
        "Coop: Nope, she's going.",
        "Alan-Michael: Hey, I know when I'm beat. I'll e-mail you some numbers, friends and contacts I've made over there. If you ever need help, you can use my name.",
        "Coop: Thanks, but we're actually looking forward to doing this on our own.",
        "Alan-Michael: It must be exciting to start over without anything to bind you back here.",
        "Gus: Who was that on the phone?",
        "Harley: It was Mel.",
        "Gus: Is everything going okay with the adoption hearing?",
        "Harley: Yeah, they scheduled the hearing.",
        "Gus: Oh. That's good, right?",
        "Harley: Judge Green is taking over the case.",
        "Gus: Stop it.",
        "Harley: Yeah, he thinks we kind of got off easy at the original custody hearing. You want to know what he told Mel?",

And if you don't settle this somehow... (cell phone rings) Sorry, hold on. Cooper. He's... what? Where? All right. Backup. I've got to go. Are you going to be okay?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Marina: Hug?",
        "Tammy: Thanks.",
        "Marina: You'll be okay.",

        "Ava: Wish I could help out, too, any way I could support.",
        "Coop: Yeah, Harley, if really need us...",
        "Harley: You know how you can help us? You can go to England safely. We can handle a cranky old judge by ourselves. Don't worry about it.",
        "Coop: Okay, all right. You guys are going to win this.",
        "Gus: We better.",
        "Ava: Don't worry, little baby. Nobody's going to take you away from the people who love you.",

        "Gus: Who'd ever thought we'd get a Christmas present like you, huh?",

        "Mallet: Yeah, those poor, poor children. Are you interested in those children or are you interested in better ratings?",
        "Dinah: Oh, and you are?",
        "Mallet: Well, I'm not obsessed with being a celebrity like you are.",

        "Mallet: Here is the deal: My show serves a purpose.",
        "Dinah: Oh, really?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Gives the general public confidence in its local police.",
        "Dinah: I think what your show does is give female viewers the hots when they see your hunky cops dress up in their uniform.",
        "Mallet: That means you kind of think I'm hot.",
        "Dinah: En fuego hot. Muy caliente.",

        "Alan: She's young. Her heart will mend soon. Besides, it's not like Jonathan loves her back.",
        "Beth: Well, I think he will come around if we give him a chance.",
        "Alan: We are saving Elizabeth from herself. That is why we're doing something drastic, to pry her loose from his hold.",
        "Beth: Has it ever occurred to you, Alan, that maybe what Lizzie wants-- what any woman wants-- is to be loved and appreciated, not controlled by anyone, no matter how noble his motives?",

        "Coop: You're remembering something?",
        "Ava: Yeah, my mom. She loved Christmas trees. We had one every year. And we decorated it with pine cones and shiny ornaments, and it had a big wishing star on top.",
        "Coop: And what did you wish for?",
        "Ava: Well, sometimes I wished for a little sister, which is really weird. Because after all this time, my wish finally came true. Only I'm not spending Christmas with her.",
        "Coop: Right. I'll tell you what, Ava, how about when we get to England, I will buy you the biggest Christmas tree we can find? We'll get all those decorations and we'll get some pine cones. We throw it up on there and then you can take that wishing star and you can be the one to put it on top of the tree. How does that sound?",
        "Ava: I like that.",
        "Coop: You like that?",
