        "Reva: It's really a beautiful tree.",
        "Cassie: Beautiful.",

        "Tammy: How do you explain why you fall in love?",
        "Cassie: This is not love.",
        "Tammy: Yes, it is. I love him.",
        "Cassie: If you go now, don't ever bother coming back.",
        "Reva: It's hard not to feel hopeful this time of the year. Don't you think?",
        "Cassie: To tell you the truth, Reva, I'm trying hard not to think right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Waitress: Merry Christmas, Mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: Thank you very much, Merry Christmas to you, too. You haven't seen Tammy Winslow tonight around here at all, have you?",
        "Waitress: Tammy, no. Is she missing?",
        "Josh: No, no. She's just... she took off with a friend and it is snowing, so I'm worried.",
        "Waitress: I'll keep an eye open.",
        "Josh: Thank you. I appreciate it. I'm just trying to get her home safe.",
        "Sandy: She will be home safe if I have anything to say about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Merry Christmas, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: You, too, Coop.",
        "Lizzie: I'm so glad you had time for this. I missed you so much.",
        "Alexandra: Oh! Wait a minute, dear, stand back and let me look at you. What is it, something is different?",
        "Lizzie: No. I'm doing wonderful.",
        "Alexandra: Really? No, there has got to be something-- new haircut?",
        "Lizzie: Something like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: It's not right.",
        "Reva: Well it's not something either one of us wanted, but now we're going to have to find a way to deal with it.",
        "Cassie: I would do anything for her, you know that-- she knows that, right?",
        "Reva: She's strong, honey, and smart. She's just like her mama, and she's brave. And I have to believe that she will be all right.",
        "Cassie: Reva, I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad we're in this together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Oh. So... where to?",
        "Tammy: I'll be okay. I don't care where we go, as long as I'm with you.",
        "Jonathan: You sure? We can still turn back.",
        "Tammy: I know. We can do anything. So how fast does this thing go? How far?",
        "Jonathan: Well, it goes as fast and as far as you want it to.",
        "Tammy: Show me. ( Engine starts ) ( rock music playing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Go home, Sandy. You've done enough.",
        "Sandy: We have to find Tammy and bring her home.",
        "Josh: We will. Her family will find her.",
        "Sandy: I can help find her and keep her away from Jonathan for good. You don't know what he's capable of. You don't know him the way I know him.",
        "Josh: Actually, I think I know Jonathan just fine. And I know you.",
        "Sandy: You think you do.",
        "Josh: Look, whatever happens between her and Jonathan, she has obviously made her choice: She doesn't want to be with you.",
        "Sandy: I'm right for her. I'm not going to hurt her.",
        "Josh: You all right have, in some ways, worse than Jonathan did.",
        "Sandy: I love her. I'll fix it.",
        "Josh: Sandy, do you honestly see this as some kind of a second chance for you, or third or fourth chance? You're just going to... you're going to come in, you're going to rescue her in some way, and we're all going to accept you? Because I've got to tell you something: I don't really want to see Tammy with you, anymore than I want to see her with Jonathan.",
        "Sandy: You're making a big mistake.",
        "Josh: It won't be my first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes. Well I can't quite put my finger on it, darling, but there is something definitely different?",
        "Lizzie: Yes, there is.",
        "Alexandra: Uh-huh. So, it's not the hairdo. It's not those shoes.",
        "Lizzie: Well...",
        "Alexandra: Oh, good heavens. Coop, isn't it? Coop took you dancing.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Alexandra: Well, it's an archaic expression for... well, they used to call it a dance, a wonderful dance.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, yes! Yeah, dancing. ( Laughter )",
        "Alexandra: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, aunt Alex. I never I knew I could be this happy in my entire life. But don't worry, we're doing it right, you know, responsibly.",
        "Alexandra: Uh-huh. Uh-huh, okay. All right, well...",
        "Lizzie: What's wrong?",
        "Alexandra: I just need to step back here and take a breath and sort of take all of this in. ( Cell phone rings ) oh, excuse me. It is your grandfather. I better take this.",
        "Lizzie: Dancing. Hmm.",
        "Quinn: Well, well, things must have gone really well with your guy, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Quinn, hi.",
        "Quinn: Hi. And just think, it's all thanks to me. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I know it's hard to face-- especially when you've tried so hard, but the truth is, he is still the same angry and violent boy who came to Springfield in the first place. Still determined to hurt all of us. What he did to Tammy was awful.",
        "Reva: She found a way to forgive Jonathan. And I believe it was that forgiveness that helped him, inspired him to try to be a better person.",
        "Cassie: People don't change, Reva. They say they do. They say they will, they say they'll try, but they don't. Look at Edmund, same thing with him. Just wait, the same thing will happen with Jonathan. And when it does...",
        "Reva: What are you doing?",
        "Cassie: I'm taking the tree down. It's a lie, Reva, Christmas, the tree. I don't want any of it. Not without Tammy. Until my daughter comes home, and alone, there will be no Christmas. No Christmas.",
        "Reva: Sweetie...",
        "Cassie: No Christmas.",
        "Reva: Tammy will be home. I know her. She's going to come home because Jonathan won't allow her to stay away. Believe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Let's go inside because I'm really ready to order some food.",
        "Jonathan: You're hungry?",
        "Tammy: Starved.",
        "Jonathan: Me, too. Wait. We've got to do this right.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you're crazy!",
        "Jonathan: I have done this once before, the night of your wedding.",
        "Tammy: Okay, don't call it my wedding night, all right? It was something else; it was something new, the start of us.",
        "Jonathan: So is this.",
        "Tammy: Mmm.",
        "Jonathan: Get those lights.",
        "Tammy: Wow.",
        "Jonathan: It's the last one they had.",
        "Tammy: That's not so bad. I've stayed in hotels like this before.",
        "Jonathan: When?",
        "Tammy: With my mom a long time ago. It was what we could afford. She always used to pretend like the whole room was velvet and gold and we were princesses. It's funny.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Tammy: I was thinking later on we actually did get to live in a real castle, me and mom. I couldn't have cared less, though, but what mattered was that she was always there to take care of me and love me.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Now, I know that you'll always be there. Everything will be okay as long as I'm with you.",
        "Jonathan: You gave up a lot to be with me.",
        "Tammy: Maybe, but I've got the one thing in the world I wanted the most.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: We found them together in the barn, and Tammy stood up holding his hand in front of the whole family, and she looked us in the eye and she said she wanted him, that she loved him. I was... so close. You know she was almost mine.",
        "Ava: It's over. She is not yours anymore. Tammy and Jonathan, the two of them, when they're together, they have something. They have a connection. It's obvious.",
        "Sandy: We had a connection, too.",
        "Ava: Maybe, but you know what? It's time you move on. It's time to let it go.",
        "Sandy: I can't.",
        "Ava: She doesn't see who you really are. She doesn't deserve to be with you. Maybe she never deserved to be with you. You deserve to be loved.",
        "Sandy: Ava...",
        "Ava: She just doesn't understand. If she did, she wouldn't be doing what-- no, uh-uh.",
        "Sandy: You know who I am, and you don't care. You know what I've done.",
        "Ava: Just don't, okay, don't.",
        "Sandy: Ava, I need you. You understand that...",
        "Ava: Stop it, okay! Stop it! You're freaking me out.",
        "Coop: Look, she said stop, right? The last time I heard, stop means stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Quinn: Have you thought about going to St. Lawrence with me?",
        "Lizzie: I won't be able to, but maybe we can do dinner some time.",
        "Quinn: Dinner, yeah.",
        "Lizzie: And while you're thinking about old times, you need to consider lending me that old penthouse if you're not going to be there.",
        "Quinn: You mean for you and Coop \"the wonder waiter.\"",
        "Lizzie: You know, he works so hard, and I want to do something nice for him.",
        "Quinn: Sure, why not.",
        "Lizzie: You won't regret it.",
        "Quinn: Oh, of course I won't.",
        "Lizzie: You're the best.",
        "Quinn: Second to Mr. Coop, that is, right? That's all right. I like a challenge.",
        "Lizzie: I'm surprised how easy that was.",
        "Alexandra: Lizzie? Is that a new friend of yours?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: We've got plain crackers, cheese crackers, peanut butter crackers. This tv gets five channels. It's every girl's dream.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, right.",
        "Tammy: Hey. We're here together, and that's all I've been dreaming about. We told the world tonight who we are, and how we feel. We should be celebrating us. On Christmas.",
        "Jonathan: Well, there's no tree, and no presents.",
        "Tammy: So we'll come up with our own traditions.",
        "Jonathan: I got it. ( Rap music playing ) yeah, yeah! Yo, we got D.J. Johnny John, Big John Stud, the original bad boy with the beautiful Tammy, holding it down out of town. Yep! Jingle bells, this room smells, the carpets are all stained oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-room roach parade dashing down the road in my beat-up Chevrolet through Springfield we go laughing all the way",
        "Tammy: Ha-ha-ha",
        "Jonathon: hear my cell phone ring it's mommy Reva Shayne she says north pole just burned right down and you're the one to blame. ( Banging on the wall )",
        "Tammy: Ooh. I guess you should turn it down.",
        "Jonathan: Like hell, we're celebrating. ( Banging on the wall ) yo! Why don't you deck the halls in there, or something. We're trying to have a little Christmas in here. Merry Christmas! Jingle bells, jingle bells... Tammy, you're not merry.",
        "Tammy: Sure I am.",
        "Jonathan: No, you're not. ( Music stops ) I dragged you away from your mom and your family and a really great Christmas to bring you to this.",
        "Tammy: I don't care.",
        "Jonathan: Don't lie to me.",
        "Tammy: You know how I feel about you.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I do. But I know something else, too. You want to go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: Jonathan is not the same person who hurt Tammy.",
        "Cassie: Don't waste your breath, Reva.",
        "Reva: He only wants what is best for her, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: He thinks he's best for her.",
        "Reva: Well, you know what? She made her own choice.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, after the wedding, after what Sandy did to her. I can't blame her for being confused. And maybe I was too hard on her. Who would have thought... really I mean, whoever would have seen that coming? Reva? Did you see this coming?",
        "Reva: I just-- I had a feeling that Jonathan cared about Tammy, and then I saw what a hard time he had at the wedding.",
        "Cassie: What hard time?",
        "Reva: Tammy's easy to love, sweetie. She has a rare soul. And Jonathan-- I mean, after Nate died, he tried so hard to put the pieces back together, and has tried to be a better person.",
        "Cassie: A better person? He's still burning down houses.",
        "Reva: We don't know that. I mean, the police didn't come up with any kind of report.",
        "Cassie: You know, I wish I could just lock Tammy up to keep her safe.",
        "Reva: Tammy is a grown woman, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Then tell me, what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to keep them apart? We can't just sit back and let this happen.",
        "Reva: We?",
        "Cassie: Reva, yes. You are my sister. I can't do this alone. I need you to help me keep my daughter safe. I need you to help me keep her away from Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"Guiding Light\"...",
        "Coop: Okay.",
        "Ava: Leaning on you a little too much?",
        "Coop: You know what? ( Laughter )",
        "Cassie: You know as well as I do this just cannot happen.",
        "Josh: If you try to separate them now, you might make things worse.",
        "Cassie: I'm losing her, Josh, I'm losing my little girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: Back off, Coop, this isn't your business.",
        "Sandy: Ava, are you okay?",
        "Ava: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Sandy: She's fine. See you later.",
        "Coop: I think I'll stick around if it is all right with Ava.",
        "Ava: Yes.",
        "Coop: All right. I guess I'm not going anywhere then.",
        "Sandy: So you're going to gang up on me, too? Take your best shot; everyone else has. And why not you, too. I did try and give you everything, though?",
        "Ava: You what? You tried to give me everything? You never loved me. I didn't even see that because I was so worried about trying to get you to feel something for me that I didn't even notice it. You... you made me think the entire time we were married that I was the problem, that it was my fault, that what I was feeling... you were saying things to me like I love you, but I knew deep down inside, something was wrong!",
        "Sandy: I was trying to do my thing.",
        "Ava: I knew something was wrong. I knew it! If you cared for me, and you felt anything for me, you would've never done what you did to me, you never would've left me. You left me. No call, no letter, nothing. You just took off. This.",
        "Sandy: It's your ring; keep it.",
        "Ava: You know what? You gave it to me for the wrong reasons. I was wearing it because I was hoping to have a life with you, that I know I will never have. I don't want it.",
        "Sandy: So that's it, you're just going to walk away? Actually, that's perfect because you are abandoning me when I need you. That's...",
        "Ava: You left me first.",
        "Sandy: Good times.",
        "Coop: Uh, are you okay?",
        "Ava: Oh, my gosh. I think I'm going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alexandra: Lizzie, this friend of yours...",
        "Lizzie: Quinn, I have known him forever. And that is exactly why he is just a friend. He's one of those old, you know...",
        "Alexandra: Pals?",
        "Lizzie: Right.",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Well, Lizzie, he's the kind of friend you agree to go out to dinner with in exchange for what, a key to his was it a penthouse?",
        "Lizzie: Were you eaves dropping? You are unbelievable.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, well, what does Coop think about all of this?",
        "Lizzie: I'm doing it for Coop.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, really? And does he see it that way?",
        "Lizzie: I'm happy; he's happy. And I think that's all that matters.",
        "Alexandra: Ah...",
        "Lizzie: And sure, I mean, I'll get another job sooner or later. But in the meantime, it's not like I'm cheating on Coop. I'm doing this for him; Quinn knows it.",
        "Alexandra: You know there are other ways to get by, my darling. For instance, heaven forbid, you could come home. Oh, come on, Lizzie, we're a family. We're you're family, darling. I mean it's the holidays. I mean... don't you miss us? We miss you?",
        "Lizzie: Sometimes.",
        "Alexandra: Hmmm. Well, you know what? I think I have an idea why you're doing this, because I have a feeling you just sort of miss yourself. Don't worry, darling, I understand. ( Laughing ) we miss you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: You can work on Jonathan; I know he'll listen to you. And I will work on Tammy. Maybe some time away. I could send her to Paris to visit with Marah. Reva?",
        "Reva: Look, there's Josh. He's here.",
        "Cassie: Honey, I know this is hard on you, too, it's your son, but you know as well as I do, this just cannot happen. Any luck?",
        "Josh: No, I'm afraid not. Nothing.",
        "Cassie: I'm glad you're here, Josh. We were thinking of ways to keep Tammy and Jonathan apart.",
        "Josh: Actually, I'm not sure that is such a good idea.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Josh: Cassie, if you try to separate them now, you'll make things worse. In fact, I think you'll drive her farther away.",
        "Cassie: I can't just stand by and watch.",
        "Josh: Yeah, but if you fight her on this, she's going to fight even harder. You've got to let her figure this thing out on her own.",
        "Cassie: I don't think I can see them together and not keep them apart.",
        "Josh: Cassie, look. You raised a smart girl and you know that. You've got to give her time. If there's no future in this, she'll see it.",
        "Reva: You think so?",
        "Josh: Yes, I do. I think she'll see that it's not going to workout and she'll want to come home. But that's exactly why you've got to leave the door open for her. Otherwise, she won't feel like she's welcome here.",
        "Cassie: You guys have been through this. How do you let your kids go?",
        "Josh: ( Laughing ) well, because you have no choice.",
        "Reva: And because you know it's the right thing to do. Because you've been on their side of it, even though it does hurt.",
        "Josh: After all of the bruised knees, and all of the excruciating school plays and the birthday parties-- one day after another, and one day comes and they leave and walk out the door, which is exactly what they're supposed to do. But then you're wandering around in this big, old empty house. And sometimes... sometimes they make choices you don't agree with, and every part of you wants to change that or fix it, but you can't do it.",
        "Reva: Tony and Marah?",
        "Josh: Oh, yeah. Well, my first instinct there was to lock Marah in her room for the rest of her life and take Tony, you know, on one of those drives out to the woods with Billy and the pickup and the pig, but I didn't do that. I let her get to that point herself where she figured it out. She knew that Tony wasn't the guy and she walked away. And you've got to let Tammy get to that place on her own.",
        "Cassie: I just want her to be happy, that's all I've ever wanted for her, but...",
        "Reva: But what?",
        "Cassie: I can't live with this, not with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Of course I miss my mom. It's Christmas. We have stuff.",
        "Jonathan: Christmas stuff?",
        "Tammy: I know it sounds lame.",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Tammy: It is just what I'm used to, that's all. But things change.",
        "Jonathan: No, Tammy, why should you have to give up all of your holiday stuff for me.",
        "Tammy: Us.",
        "Jonathan: But you shouldn't have to choose. I mean, what if I'm not worth it? And you know what I do. I hurt, I break, I burn things.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: Here. Call your mom. Tell her that I forced you to come, tell her that you made a mistake.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Jonathan: Tammy, it's not too late. Look, I want you to do this now, while things are still good between us, before I screw everything up like I always do. Come on. I want you to walk away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: Sandy, he's all I've ever known my whole life. Even after he left me, all my decisions and everything revolved around him. Now he's gone.",
        "Coop: Well, this is your chance to start over.",
        "Ava: Yeah.",
        "Coop: Come on, isn't working at Springfield's hottest new club exciting enough for you? It has got to be. Let me see a smile. There you go.",
        "Ava: Oh, yeah. Of course it is, and you've been really sweet. Thank you.",
        "Coop: True, but I still owe you. You just saved me for having to work 24-hour shifts continuously.",
        "Ava: If I end up hanging out here more frequently, then I may need a friend I can lean on.",
        "Coop: That's fine. A little, a lot. It doesn't really matter.",
        "Ava: A little, a lot. I'm leaning on you too much.",
        "Coop: You know what? When we start to fall over, you'll know.",
        "Ava: ( Laughing ) there you go. Hey, there she is. Lizzie, come here. Come here. Let me tell you, you just missed an incredible moment.",
        "Lizzie: Really, did I?",
        "Coop: Ava find finally kicked Sandy to the curb.",
        "Ava: I did and I could not have done it without you. And your timing, it was incredible.",
        "Lizzie: I feel sorry for Sandy. He has had a tough time.",

        "Josh: Cassie, you've got to sit down and relax.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's nice, you know how much I love eggnog. Wow.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I kind of figured I'd give it a kick, sort of a peace offering.",
        "Cassie: Peace offering? I'm not mad at you. Okay, well that's not exactly true.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I kind of got that.",
        "Cassie: I am... I'm mad at the world, Josh. Having to give up Hope and watching Tammy humiliated on her wedding day, and Jonathan, and then you bringing up this whole thing about Jeffrey's past, it's just too much.",
        "Cassie: Is that damn eggnog ready yet?",
        "Josh: Yes, it is. It's ready and it's strong.",
        "Cassie: How strong, that's the question.",

        "Cassie: Josh...",
        "Josh: No, no. If you're done with it, I'm done with it.",
        "Cassie: I am. And I don't blame you. I never would.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Besides, I knew there was nothing to it, so there's no reason for us to talk about it then or now.",
        "Josh: Exactly.",
        "Cassie: Especially when there are other, more important things to talk about now. I'm losing her, Josh. I'm losing my little girl.",
        "Josh: You don't have to.",
        "Cassie: You told me to leave her alone.",
        "Josh: No, I told you not to lay down the law. But you're still her mother, and she needs you. You need her. Go for it.",

        "Jonathan: Don't throw a fit?",
        "Tammy: Just shut up! You almost just gave up on us, and pushed me away. We're past that, okay? We're in this together. I'm where I belong. ( Glass breaking )",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no. Let's go. We're getting out of here.",
        "Tammy: What, you don't want to stay here and watch infomercials and eat crackers with me.",
        "Jonathan: Not here. Let's go.",

        "Ava: Yeah, I'm still standing up, still alive, thanks to you and Coop, you've been so great.",
        "Lizzie: Well that's sort of what I wanted to talk to you about, Coop.",
        "Ava: What about him?",
        "Lizzie: Well, um, I noticed you've needed a lot of time lately-- his time-- you know, someone to listen to, lend a friendly ear. And Coop's really amazing about that.",
        "Ava: He is.",
        "Lizzie: And he's happy to do it, but he has had so much lately. I mean, there's his dad with that heart problem. And he's been picking up the slack on that end. And then his sister's just fresh out of prison, and she's running my family's company already. And he's basically raising her two sons on his own. And that's just the beginning of it. I mean, it's like... well, yeah, everyone in town goes to Coop for advice and help.",
        "Ava: Just like me.",
        "Lizzie: Exactly, and you know, he actually confessed to me last night, that-- well that's just pillow talk, I guess I shouldn't publish that, but, you know, I'm just worried about him. I think he's taking on too much. I hate to lay this on you, I really do, Ava.",
        "Ava: No, it is fine. The last thing I want to do is be a burden, and Coop never mentioned anything to me about that, so...",
        "Lizzie: Well, he wouldn't. Whenever you have any problems, just don't call Coop, you can call me and we can do brunch.",
        "Ava: Brunch?",
        "Lizzie: Brunch. We're friends now, aren't we?",

        "Ava: Ah, I would love... um, yeah, you know what? Thanks for asking me, but I can't.",
        "Coop: Ah, why not?",
        "Ava: Ooh, there's a customer over there I have. Time for me to check in anyway. Thanks.",
        "Coop: Yeah... is she okay?",
        "Lizzie: She's fine. I told her whenever she needs me, I'm here for her.",
        "Coop: Well that was awful nice of you.",
        "Lizzie: I know. Well, I guess it was just the Christmas spirit.",
