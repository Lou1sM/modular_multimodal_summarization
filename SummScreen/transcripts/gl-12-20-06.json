        "Jonathan: Oh, no, no, no. Okay, okay. Oh baby, baby. Sarah. Oops, upside down. Is it there's a quiet I don't reach so still I can almost hear out hearts beat I want to say all the things that I would never say and live the lines that we rehearse in our heads in our heads you don't know what to trust and you don't trust what you know when the moment is you're still not ready to let go now that it's too late did you find what you're looking for? There's nothing left to break hope you find what you're looking for I'm not afraid to say you were braver then but lately your heart's worn paper thin pain makes your fear less of the truth when you feel like there's nothing left to lose left to lose but you don't want to know and you don't know what you want and the other side wasn't anything that thought now that it's too late did you find what you're looking for? There's nothing left to break hope you find what you're looking for do you know what you're looking for? Do you even know? I only know you by the empty place in me I only know you by the negative space you leave you leave now that it's too late did you find what you're looking for? There's nothing left to break hope you find what you're looking for do you know what you're looking for do you even know?",

        "Tammy: Is that what I am? The other woman? That is so clich\u00e9, like I should have a big scarlet \"A\" on my chest or something. I'm overreacting. Jonathan and I made love. It wasn't just some roll in the... oh, my God, I'm two clich\u00e9s. How did it get to this? I was the perfect kid. Followed the rules. Didn't talk back. Always finished my homework, my chores, my vegetables. What changed? Was there a moment when it happened? Or was it happening all along? Okay. Stop obsessing. What I have with Jonathan is right, and it will all work out as soon as he leaves his wife. I really am the other woman.",
        "Remy: Okay, you've seen me in a towel before. Oh, and Marina and I owe you one. Tammy... which one is my stuff?",
        "Tammy: That pile. You guys can do the grocery shopping for a month.",
        "Remy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's cool of your mom to let us stay here while they're fixing up our place. We should get her something to say thank you.",
        "Tammy: Oh, hey, those are dirty.",
        "Remy: It's not dirty. They're semi-clean.",
        "Tammy: Like me. Not dirty, semi-clean. Oh, God.",
        "Remy: So what should we get her?",
        "Tammy: Who?",
        "Remy: Your mom. We took over her bathroom, her washer and dryer. I thought you said you were going Christmas shopping.",
        "Tammy: I am. I just lost track of time.",
        "Remy: Still haven't gotten my sister anything.",
        "Tammy: Remy. Hot, smart, fun, super thoughtful. No wives or babies. You already know he's into you. What are you waiting for? I mean look at him, that six pack. I think it's more than six. One, two... five.",
        "Remy: Hey, where did you go?",
        "Tammy: I was just counting. We were meant to be. Now there's a clich\u00e9 I don't mind. Next year that could be me, back together with Jonathan Christmas shopping for our families and Sarah. Before she was born we got along with Lizzie. We found a way to make it work. We'll just have to do it again because I'm not the other woman. I was there first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: I only asked what your holiday plans were.",
        "Mel: Because you want to know if Rick's a part of them.",
        "Beth: Well, he did have to spend Thanksgiving alone.",
        "Mel: You are still trying to steal my husband.",
        "Beth: Look, I care about Rick. He was my friend long before you came to town.",
        "Mel: So, what, Beth, you two shared the same homeroom senior year? You beat me to it, is that what you think? That he's more yours than mine because you saw him first? Or maybe after walking down the aisle a few times you lose respect for marriage. Well, Beth, mine means something to me and it's not over yet. Why don't you go home to your husband and leave my family alone. I'm sorry, you guys.",
        "Remy: Why are you apologizing? Beth's the home wrecker.",
        "Mel: She doesn't quit. I mean, wherever I go, she's there. Even if I wanted to make up with Rick... it's Christmas, you know, and I just hate what it's doing to Leah being in the middle of all this.",
        "Remy: I got her those speakers she wanted.",
        "Mel: Oh, you are such a good uncle, Remy.",
        "Remy: Tammy made me do it.",
        "Tammy: He was getting them anyway.",
        "Mel: Well, I better go hide these gifts before Miss Leah gets back. Bye, sweetie. See you later, Tam.",
        "Remy: Every time I see her, it's the same thing.",
        "Tammy: It's not the same thing. I don't chase Lizzie down the street asking her about Jonathan. I don't show up at their house. Well, only because Aunt Reva lives there. And it's not like Mel stole Rick from Beth. Lizzie stole Jonathan from me. He's only with her because he has to be, because of the baby. Using her baby to hang on to Jonathan wasn't enough, now she's using Santa? Oh, that's shameless. He has to see how fake she is. Alan must be around here somewhere. He's putting on a show for Alan.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, come here.",
        "Tammy: So, Sarah's first visit to Santa?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I was thinking that we could use this picture for next year's Christmas card. But Jonathan just reminded me she's going to look a lot different then.",
        "Jonathan: A lot can change in a year.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Did you send Christmas cards this year?",
        "Tammy: I didn't have the time.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, us either.",
        "Tammy: Us?",
        "Lizzie: With Sarah coming so early, we just, you know, some things got pushed to the side.",
        "Tammy: You mean like me?",
        "Lizzie: But I'm really glad that we were able to make it to your mom's party. (Baby crying)",
        "Jonathan: Line's moving.",
        "Tammy: Is she okay?",
        "Jonathan: She's probably just tired.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think that we need to do the Santa thing another day?",
        "Jonathan: Well, we already waited on line. I mean, I'll stay here with her if you want to go. Yeah, maybe we'd better go.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Well, guess I'll talk to you guys later.",
        "Lizzie: If we don't see you before Christmas.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, you too. Lizzie, who's everything I'm not. While I was getting straight \"A\"s, she was burning down boarding schools, tripping people on staircases. Thanks to an unplanned pregnancy, she gets to go home with Jonathan, leaving me out in the cold. Me, the other woman. Jonathan? \"Meet me at our place.\" Jonathan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: (Sighs) Look at me, I'm a mother. And it looks right. I could totally be one of those TV moms pedaling pampers and peanut butter. Oh, my God, I am so a mom. When I think about how freaked out I was when I first got pregnant, I didn't even know whose it was. \"Look, everyone. She's psycho and a tramp.\" Instead, it turned me into a good girl. One crazy night and, poof, nine months later I've got a hot husband, a cute baby, and a home that looks homey. My mother-in-law is even starting to like me. And I'm learning to care about people other than myself, not that I don't still care about myself. Jonathan will fall for me eventually. I can be patient. A little patient. Well, not really patient. I mean, he could do a lot worse. This time I won't have to lie to him or try to play him. He'll want to be my husband in every way. Tammy who? I am the whole package now. A good wife, a good mother with great hair and excellent fashion sense. My body's even snapping back into shape. I have it all. Almost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reva: What stinks?",
        "Lizzie: I was cooking.",
        "Reva: What is it?",
        "Lizzie: Lunch.",
        "Reva: No, no, I mean...",
        "Lizzie: I know what you mean. I don't know what it is. It's supposed to be this and it's this.",
        "Reva: Okay, just calm down. We'll order take out.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. It needs to be this.",
        "Reva: I'm not eating it.",
        "Lizzie: Look, any wife can order a pizza. I want Jonathan to come home to the smell of fresh baked...",
        "Reva: Feet?",
        "Lizzie: Reva...",
        "Reva: No, it smells like feet.",
        "Lizzie: Don't you want me to take care of your son like Tammy could?",
        "Reva: Okay. Tammy is a good cook. But you're not Tammy.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, duh.",
        "Reva: You need to be you, Lizzie. You need to find out what you're good at and then be that for Jonathan.",
        "Lizzie: I guess I could dress him better.",
        "Reva: He'd hate that and you know it.",
        "Lizzie: I know. I like him just the way he is anyway. You know, I had a happy home on. It just didn't last.",
        "Reva: It couldn't be easy growing up Spaulding. That house is so cold.",
        "Lizzie: It's all marble.",
        "Reva: No, I didn't mean... the thing about raising kids is that it's a great opportunity for you to do kid stuff again through the kid. You know, you and Jonathan, you had such a rough go of it growing up and now Sarah is like your do-over. You get the make the kind of life that you always wish you had for her.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I hope she likes take out. Do you think I have a chance with Jonathan now that Tammy is gone?",
        "Reva: Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Look, I mean, you were the one that said before I had Sarah that you thought that Jon and I would be okay. You know, okay isn't good and good certainly isn't happy, so if you don't think we can be any of those things just tell me so I can stop hoping.",
        "Reva: You know, I always believed that you only have one great love in your life but now... you and Jonathan chose to be in this marriage for your daughter. It wasn't a choice that you made by accident, so the two of you have something that only the two of you can share. So, yes, I do think you have a chance. Some day.",
        "Lizzie: I knew it. I knew it. I felt like... I could feel like he was having feelings for me but I wasn't sure. I just want to be the best person that I can be for him. I really do.",
        "Reva: Like Tammy?",
        "Lizzie: Like Lizzie. I was listening to you, Reva. I was so good at being bad, if I could just get that good at being good, it would be great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Okay, sit.",
        "Jonathan: Why do I feel like Roxy right now.",
        "Lizzie: Well, when she listens she gets a treat, too. Okay, so it's not gourmet but Reva said that for my first try it doesn't have to be.",
        "Jonathan: This is your first try?",
        "Lizzie: Well it's my second. I had to throw the first one away. Well?",
        "Jonathan: Are you going to stare at me while I eat it?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. Oh, my God, spit it out. Jonathan, spit it out.",
        "Jonathan: (Laughs) I'm kidding, it's good. It's good. Did you try some yet?",
        "Lizzie: No, I wanted to make sure it didn't kill you first.",
        "Jonathan: Nice.",
        "Lizzie: He likes it. He likes me. I am going to be the best person of myself for him, the ultimate good girl. Casseroles are just the beginning, baby. I am going to make this marriage rock.",
        "Jonathan: It's really good.",
        "Lizzie: Good. Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: It's a state of mind. Do you like those? I got them for you for helping us with Sarah.",
        "Lillian: Lizzie... oh, I don't know what to say. Honey, thank you. But, of course, you didn't have to give me anything because I love watching Sarah.",
        "Lizzie: Well, everyone loves watching Sarah because she's the greatest baby that ever lived. But I just wanted to do something nice for you.",
        "Lillian: Motherhood is certainly bringing out the best in you.",
        "Lizzie: Motherhood and Jonathan. Oh, he makes me so happy. He doesn't even have to do anything. He just walks in the room. I just want to deserve that kind of happy.",
        "Lillian: You do deserve that kind of happy.",
        "Lizzie: It can't hurt to give back a little and set a good example for Sarah, just like you do.",
        "Lillian: Thank you, but I wasn't always such a good example.",
        "Lizzie: But anyone can make a change for the better.",
        "Lillian: You're very funny.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, okay, I'm going home to my family.",
        "Lillian: Thank you, sweetie. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Lizzie: You're welcome. Bye, Nana. How much fun was that? And nana is kind of me-- or I'm her. Living proof you can change your ways and be a better person. Look how she turned out. Kind, generous, beautiful, independent. Jingle bells, jingle all the the way",
        "Lizzie: And all alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: December 2005. Why is Jon keeping this? Tammy. Should have known. Even the penmanship is perfect. A good girl will put it back. She's out, I'm in, who cares what it says? \"Dear Jonathan, can't stop thinking about you...\" blah, blah, blah, \"last night, amazing.\" Okay, Tammy, how original. \"I hate that we can't be together without people looking down on us. My family should talk. They act like they're happy even when everyone's miserable. What I love most about us is when I'm with you, we don't worry about doing the right thing or pretend to be something we're not.\" You're so full of it, Tammy. You don't need him to do the right thing. Mess with his head, why don't you? Maybe he likes doing right things for me. Husband things. Yeah, we're going to be doing lots of husband and wife things. You can take your deep, meaningful connection and shove it up your... dust buster. Dust buster. Whatever. It's my house. Sort of. I'm just cleaning because that is what good girls do. (Cell phone beeps) \"Meet me in Cassie's barn. I have a surprise for you.\" Jonathan. Bad boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: I can pull this off. The dad thing. I can be good at it without turning into a Josh or an Alfred, a saint or a devil. I can hang out somewhere in between, loving my kid without losing my edge. I want Sarah to like that about me. I want to be the cool dad when I drop her off at school. School. Dude, don't rush things. She's not even holding up her own head. Going to be great watching her grow up. Tammy was right. Sarah is the only thing I think about except when I'm thinking about Tammy. It sucks. She's the one who put me up to this and now she's not even a part of it. But she can't be part of it. It's too hard. What happened in the barn...what happened in the barn? I'm a cheating husband. I have a wife and I cheated on her. Lizzie has been trying so hard. I can't be that guy. I don't want my daughter to see me as someone who would hurt her mom like that. I've got to think like a dad. The trick is doing it when you're still in the picture. How many times has Tammy been on the back of this bike, her arms around me holding on tight? Sometimes it still feels like we're just taking a break. I'm here playing house for a while then I'll go home to her. (Baby crying) Now there's someone who needs me more. Now this one, she's never going to be on the back of any kid's motorcycle if I got anything to say about it. How does it go? \"Do as I say not as I do.\" Got that, Sarah? No, I do something, I got to own it now. I've got someone watching me. Kids pick up on things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Hello, Jonathan. If you're looking for Tammy, she's not here. I think she went shopping or something.",
        "Jonathan: Why would I be looking for Tammy?",
        "Josh: I don't know. Looking for Cassie or for me?",
        "Jonathan: No, no. Lizzie left her earring at the party here the other night, she thinks.",
        "Josh: Well, I don't remember seeing it. Do you know what it looked like?",
        "Jonathan: No.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I guess that's kind of a dumb question to ask, isn't it? I don't think I could probably pick out one of Cassie's earrings from a lineup. Besides you've got enough to worry about these days, I'm sure.",
        "Jonathan: You have no idea, Josh.",
        "Josh: So, how is Sarah doing?",
        "Jonathan: She's... I wouldn't have expected it, but I really dig hanging out with her, you know?",
        "Josh: I'm really proud of you, Jonathan. I am. You've stepped up to the plate for your daughter. You've really changed your life around for her and that's a good thing.",
        "Jonathan: Thanks.",
        "Josh: And for Lizzie too. You made the jump to father and husband in a very short period of time and that's not an easy thing to do. And I also know what you had to give up for that.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Josh: So I have to get to work. If you want to go inside and look around for that earring, you're more than welcome to. Good luck. It will be like finding a needle in a haystack, I'm sure. I'll see you. (Cell phone rings)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I can't believe you picked here. You sent me a text message telling me to meet you here.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't send you a text message.",
        "Lizzie: Then why are you here?",
        "Jonathan: Because I got a text message telling me to come here. I got two of them, actually.",
        "Tammy: Me too.",
        "Lizzie: I did get a second one. It says to be here at 1:30.",
        "Jonathan and Tammy: Mine said to be here at 1:00.",
        "Tammy: And I'm late.",
        "Jonathan: It's a set up.",
        "Lizzie: What?",
        "Jonathan: Whoever it is told you to come later so that we would be here together already and when we got here, you would think....",
        "Lizzie: It must have been my granddad. He wants me to not trust you. Wow, I feel bad, Tammy, that my granddad has done this. Here she's trying to move on with her life and he's just shoving us in her face.",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, where is the baby?",
        "Lizzie: She's with nana.",
        "Jonathan: We should go.",
        "Lizzie: No, wait. I'm going to go. I have something I have to do. I am sorry Tammy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: I am the good girl. I'm a good girl. Okay. Just breathe, Lizzie.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, come in. I'm just finishing a business meeting.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, you were right. I found them together. Jonathan and Tammy.",
        "Alan: I'm so sorry, sweetie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Daddy's got a story for you. Okay, we're going to start it off with \"Once upon a time,\" okay? Yeah, once upon a time there was a boy who lived on an island. Oh, yeah. And the boy's dad was a prince. But the boy didn't know it because he didn't grow up with his real dad. Yeah, he grew up with a different dad. I know. It's a little... I know. I know. I was upset too when I heard this. But the different dad, he was mean son of a... yeah, he was. Bad dad. So when the boy grew up, he wanted to find his real mom. So, he went to find his mom because he was really mad, you know, and he went to find her and he went to hurt her and everybody around her and everybody that she knew. And then he met this girl-- a girl like you-- and the girl, she loved him and he fell for her. People had a little fit about it because they were kind of cousins, but, yeah, we won't get into that. I know. It's icky. So he met the girl and he didn't care that they were cousins. Everybody else did. And they stuck it out. And the girl didn't try to change him and she made him want to be a better man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: At least it's not an angel. Not feeling like one of those right now. Never wished on a tree topper before, but hey, a star is a star is a star. I didn't even get to the Jonathon part. Stupid star.",
        "Delivery person: Cassie Winslow?",
        "Tammy: I'm her daughter. I can take it.",
        "Delivery person: Happy holidays, Miss.",
        "Tammy: Thanks, you too. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: You set us up. You set us up but it didn't work.",
        "Alan: You hit me, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: And you know why? Because Jonathan and I know better than that. You can't break us up, Granddad. We're married and I love him and he loves me, too. Throwing Tammy into it isn't going to change anything anymore. I'm talking to you.",
        "Alan: I need some more ice.",
        "Lizzie: You just need to get over it. Get a life, whatever. Jonathan and I have a baby together. We are hooked up for the rest of our lives and we like it that way.",
        "Alan: Why did Jonathan show up at the barn?",
        "Lizzie: You know why.",
        "Alan: Think, Elizabeth. Why.",
        "Lizzie: You sent him a bogus text message.",
        "Alan: If it had been from me, he wouldn't have shown up. I didn't send it from you. I sent it from Tammy. He and Tammy thought they were meeting each other in the barn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I have been dying to talk to you.",
        "Jonathan: I know.",
        "Tammy: I didn't know if last night was hello or good-bye.",
        "Jonathan: Well, it wasn't good-bye.",
        "Tammy: What changed?",
        "Jonathan: I can't leave them now and I won't be like Alfred but I can't let you go either.",
        "Tammy: I don't understand.",
        "Jonathan: I know. Okay, listen, I was trying to put Sarah to sleep before, and so I started telling her this story about myself but it became a story about us. I wouldn't be who I am right now without you, and I want her to know you. I want her to know all the good things that you are. You know, I wouldn't be doing my job as her father if I kept someone as special as you out of her life.",
        "Tammy: I'm not her mother. Lizzie is her mother.",
        "Jonathan: And I'll take care of her. I'll always be there for her in that sense, but I mean we can't keep living the way we're living. It's like every day I'm fighting myself. Sarah gets older, she's going to realize that. I mean, Lizzie already must feel it now. It's not fair to her either.",
        "Tammy: Earlier today in the barn.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, she's not stupid. She's putting it together.",

        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
