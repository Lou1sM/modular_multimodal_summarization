        "Alan: We have to talk about Elizabeth.",
        "Alan-Michael: It'll have to wait. I'm expecting a call.",
        "Alan: What's more important than your niece, Alan-Michael? Well, what's this?",
        "Alan-Michael: None of your business.",
        "Alan: You've offered Ava Peralta a six-figure executive position at Spaulding Enterprises?",
        "Alan-Michael: Did I owe you an explanation? I'm sorry. I thought I was running Spaulding.",
        "Alan: I assume she leapt at the opportunity?",
        "Alan-Michael: She will. Haven't heard back from her yet.",
        "Alan: Oh, really? Well, she'd be a fool not to. That is, unless she thinks you're trying to get her into bed.",

        "(Knock on the door)",
        "Olivia: Ava, I thought you were leaving for England today.",
        "Ava: I am leaving for England in a few hours. Don't worry, I didn't come by to say good-bye to you. I came to say good-bye to you! Emma! How are you, baby? I missed you. How you doing, huh?",
        "Emma: Good.",
        "Ava: (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Aha! So... cheerio.",
        "Marina: Yeah, that is what they say in England.",
        "Coop: Sure, sure. The chimney sweeps and the artful dodger.",
        "Marina: Well, excuse me for trying to be creative.",
        "Coop: No. Listen, Marina, I really do appreciate it, okay? And I know that Ava will, too. So thank you.",
        "Marina: You're welcome.",
        "Coop: All right.",
        "Marina: If Ava ever gets here.",
        "Coop: Stop. She's going to get here. Okay? She will be here very, very soon. She is really excited about getting away from here. I think this is something that the two of us really need to just do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey! Oh, I'm so glad to hear your voice. Where are you?",
        "Jonathan: Home. You miss me.",
        "Tammy: Nah. When am I going to get to see you again?",
        "Jonathan: How's tonight?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie's not home?",
        "Jonathan: No, she just ran out to the store, but as soon as she gets back I'll make an excuse to leave and we can meet up. You know where.",
        "Tammy: Well, what are you going to tell her?",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry about it. I'll think of something.",
        "Tammy: Okay, just be careful. 'Cause, you know, the last thing we want to do right now is hurt her.",
        "Jonathan: I know. So, are we on? I really want to see you tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Why did Jonathan show up at the barn?",
        "Lizzie: You know why.",
        "Alan: Think, Elizabeth. Why?",
        "Lizzie: You sent him a bogus text message!",
        "Alan: If it had been from me, he wouldn't have shown up. I didn't send it from you. I sent it from Tammy. He and Tammy thought they were meeting each other in the barn.",
        "Lizzie: No. No. I am not going to let my granddad get to me. I won't. Is that for me? I was expecting a call. Hello? Who is this? Hello? Hello? I said who is this? Hello?",
        "Sal: Lady, this is Sal at Sal's Bike and Leather. Who the hell are you?",
        "Lizzie: Oh... I'm sorry... sorry. I'll give you back to my husband now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Excuse me, excuse me. Yeah, Marina, do you think Ava's going to get here soon?",
        "Marina: Why, you got some place better to be?",
        "Tammy: Um... I just have something to do, something that just came up.",
        "Marina: It sounds mysterious. Let me guess. Jonathan.",
        "Tammy: You really don't want me to answer that.",
        "Marina: Yes, I do.",
        "Tammy: No, you don't, because really the less you know, the better.",
        "Marina: Now, see, where I work that's what we call an incriminating statement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, okay, Sal. Thanks. Why did you grab the phone like that?",
        "Lizzie: Um, I thought it was for me. The bicycle shop, huh?",
        "Jonathan: It was. It was supposed to be a surprise for Christmas for you.",
        "Lizzie: For me?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-mm. So much for the surprise. I was calling around trying to see if anybody had a pink leather jacket for you to match this.",
        "Lizzie: You got that for me?",
        "Jonathan: You don't like it?",
        "Lizzie: I love it! I just... I... I came in and you were one the phone and I just... I thought that... and I... this is really cool!",
        "Jonathan: You're not making any sense, you know that, right?",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs)",
        "Jonathan: If you don't want it, I can take it back.",
        "Lizzie: No! No, no, no. I want it. I... I can't believe that you picked something like this out for me. It's awesome. Wow.",
        "Jonathan: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: Wow.",
        "Jonathan: Good. And I'm going to get you the jacket, too, okay? But that's for Christmas.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: And I'm going to hide it really good. So don't even try and find it.",
        "Lizzie: Where are you going?",
        "Jonathan: I got to go to Sal's because he's only got one jacket left in your size, so I got to go grab it before somebody else does.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: She's down and she's had a half a bottle, so she'll be okay. And I won't be long.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. That will give me more than enough time to wrap a couple of your presents. There are going to be some surprises under there for you, you know. Hurry back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Hey, Coop? Hey, I'm sorry. I can't stay. I thought Ava would be here by now.",
        "Coop: Yeah, well, me too.",
        "Tammy: Will you say good-bye to her for me?",
        "Coop: I will, I will.",
        "Tammy: Have a great time and I want lots of e-mails, okay?",
        "Coop: Yes.",
        "Tammy: And, remember, I fully expect you to write the next Pulitzer Prize winning novel.",
        "Coop: Well, I will do my best.",
        "Marina: And, Tammy, I will see you at home. So, do you think you should call Ava? I mean, did she have anyone to say good-bye to?",
        "Coop: Anybody like who?",
        "Marina: Oh, Olivia, Jeffrey?",
        "Coop: Now, those are not people that she needs to say good-bye to.",
        "Marina: Oh, right. No, they're just her parents.",
        "Coop: No, they're not her parents, they're poison. And you know what? You can throw Alan-Michael in that mix, too. All right, now, I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings, but you're not dating him anymore. And, frankly, I don't care what I have to say about him now.",
        "Marina: No, of course. You can say whatever you want to about Alan-Michael, but I thought that he was helping Ava out.",
        "Coop: Helping her. No, he has a thing for her, is what he's doing.",
        "Marina: Honey, let me let you in on a secret. Alan-Michael likes any girl in a skirt.",
        "Coop: Yes, exactly. And, let me just throw this out there, today he wanted to give her a huge promotion. This afternoon, he was going to give her a huge raise.",
        "Marina: That monster!",
        "Coop: No... Marina, I'm talking about... he's trying to trick her to get her to stay here.",
        "Marina: And she turned down the job. Now, I'd say that takes guts.",
        "Coop: Well, she would have turned it down. I just spared her from having to do it.",
        "Marina: You spared her?",
        "Coop: Yes, I spared her. Look, he sent a messenger over to her room. Her room, of all places. She was in the shower. I got the message, and I did what any good boyfriend would do. I took it, and I put it right in the... in the trash can.",
        "Marina: Coop! You didn't tell her?",
        "Coop: No. Why... Marina, why would I tell her, okay? She's all set to go to England. She's happy, okay? Why am I going to ruin her last day here in Springfield with some of Alan-Michael's games again?",
        "Marina: No, you're right. You are... you're absolutely right. Because we know you should absolutely just delve into her private property and then keep things from her that she has every right to know about. Cheerio, dummy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ava: So I promise when I go to England I'm going to write you all the time and I'm going to send you pictures. And actually, you know what? We can be pen- pals. We can write back and forth and you're mama can help you do that. That'll be nice, right? And don't worry, we won't lose touch, because I love you. You know that I love you?",
        "Olivia: Hey, Em, it's time to say good-bye to Ava. She has a plane to catch and you have to get ready for bed, okay?",
        "Ava: Yep, that's right. It's time for bed. But wait... oh! I have something for you. I brought you a Christmas present. Hey! It's big. But you've got to promise me you can't open it until Christmas morning. Can you promise me that? Yeah? This is for you. Merry Christmas, baby. Okay? Night-night. Guess it's time for you to go to bed, okay?",
        "Olivia: You take this and go in your bedroom. Go on. So, is that it?",
        "Ava: Not exactly. I have something for you, too. I'm not sure why, but...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: It's imperative that we help Elizabeth open her eyes about who Jonathan really is. We have to save that baby.",
        "Alan-Michael: You need a new act, Dad. This one's getting tired. And I have a company to run, so if you don't mind...",
        "Alan: And that's why you will never make a great head of our family, Alan- Michael.",
        "Alan-Michael: Really?",
        "Mandy: I'm sorry, Mr. Spaulding. I just got your message.",
        "Alan-Michael: What happened to the job offer I asked you to deliver to Miss Peralta.",
        "Mandy: I delivered it.",
        "Alan-Michael: When?",
        "Mandy: Right after you gave me the envelope.",
        "Alan-Michael: Why hasn't she responded yet? I know her. Even if she wasn't interested she would have at least called.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Look, if this is some kind of a gift or something like that, it's not going to be reciprocated, okay? Because I do not have anything for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: Ava. Good luck in England.",
        "Ava: Thanks.",
        "Olivia: Are you up on the customs, the language?",
        "Ava: Yeah, well, they speak English.",
        "Olivia: I know, but there are differences. I mean, it's practically a different language, really.",
        "Ava: Yeah. Jumper is sweater and lift is elevator. Coop's been filling me in on the lingo.",
        "Olivia: Good, good. He takes good care of you.",
        "Ava: He does. And Buzz takes good care of you.",
        "Olivia: You know, I was probably your age the first time I went there. I was a little nervous. Are you nervous about it at all?",
        "Ava: Maybe a little, but, you know, I travel well. I sleep well on planes, so...",
        "Olivia: Well, I can sleep just about anywhere, really.",
        "Ava: Yeah, I'm the same way. It's like, anywhere...",
        "Olivia: I hope that doesn't keep you up.",
        "Ava: Right. I think I should go now.",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm. Thanks for the Christmas present.",
        "Ava: Sure.",
        "Coop: Hey.",
        "Ava: Hey.",
        "Coop: You all right?",
        "Ava: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Coop: You sure? I don't know, you seem kind of like your thoughts are somewhere else right now.",
        "Ava: Maybe I'm just a little nervous, I guess.",
        "Coop: Listen, this is going to be great, okay? Ava, you're going to love this. I'm going to take you all over the place. I'm going to take you to Brighton, I'm going to take you to Stonehenge, I'm going to take you to Hampton Court, I'm going to take you to Bath, all right? You're going to see everything that I know, and we're going to love it together. Okay?",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: I promise you. This is going to be a little different, I'm not going to lie. But it's not going to be different to where it's going to be weird or where you're going to be homesick. Promise.",
        "Ava: It's just that they speak a different language practically, right?",
        "Coop: Different language? No, why?",
        "Ava: Just... never mind. It's just something someone said to me. I'm excited, right? I mean, if we get homesick we can just jump on a plane and come back home. We're really not that far, right? It's not that big a deal. We can just come back for a quick visit.",
        "Marina: Well, top o' the morning to 'ya.",
        "Coop: Marina! Okay, that's Irish, first off. And secondly, it's night outside, by the way.",
        "Marina: Well, whatever. Are you having fun?",
        "Ava: Yes, yes. It's absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much for doing this. I love the sign.",
        "Marina: Thank you. See, she likes the sign.",
        "Ava: I love it.",
        "Marina: So, did Coop tell you?",
        "Ava: Coop tell me what?",
        "Marina: About the card that we signed for you. We all signed it, actually. And there's pounds. English money, pounds in the card to help you get started.",
        "Ava: Thank you. Thank you, that was so nice of you. Thank you.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, you know, we're like family, all of us, huh? So we want you to have fun, and best of luck, and we hope all of your dreams come true.",
        "Ava: Thanks. Me, too. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: Hold up. I'm sorry if I startled you. I'm looking for Ava Peralta. This her room?",
        "Maid: Sorry, sir. The lady's already checked out.",
        "Alan-Michael: Wait. I need to look through the trash in your bin. You don't mind, do you?",
        "Maid: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Well, I see you're Christmas wrapping, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Out! You are not allowed within 100 feet of Sarah. The restraining order clearly tells you you have to...",
        "Alan: Is this the kind of life you want for you and little Sarah?",
        "Lizzie: This is my home and Jonathan's and Sarah's, and you are not welcome here. So turn around and walk out the door before I call the police. (Sarah crying) It's okay, honey. Mommy's right here. I'm right here. Are you asking to be arrested? As soon as I pick up that phone...",
        "Alan: The restraining order has been revoked. Doris took care of it for me.",
        "Lizzie: Doris? Doris? Well, what else has Doris been taking care of for you? And does mom know?",
        "Alan: Speaking of spouses, where is yours? Missing in action again, huh?",
        "Lizzie: He is Christmas shopping.",
        "Alan: Ah, for whom?",
        "Lizzie: His family. He loves me. And if you'd like some proof... right here. He bought me the most wonderful, awesome Christmas present ever.",
        "Alan: This is supposed to win me over?",
        "Lizzie: Yes. It is a motorcycle helmet so that we can go riding together. Do you really think that he would have bought me such a personal and romantic present if he didn't want to be with me?",
        "Alan: You're very young. Don't you realize that when a man feels guilty about cheating on his wife he buys her a special gift?",
        "Lizzie: Out. Come on, honey. Come on. Get out. Out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle Ray Smith, \"Inside The Light...\" I'm learning about who I am every day, to be honest with you. Ava is a little bit more easygoing and more passive than I am in real life, so it's been a challenge for me, actually, to learn how to kind of... I don't know, tone myself down a bit, I guess. See Ava Wednesday, December 27 \"Inside The Light.\"",

        "Tammy: Are we crazy?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Doesn't it feel great?",
        "Tammy: How long can we stay?",
        "Jonathan: (Groans)",
        "Tammy: The stores are going to close. Lizzie will be home soon.",
        "Jonathan: I have a flat tire.",
        "Tammy: How many times can you use that one?",
        "Jonathan: I'll get a new one next time.",
        "Tammy: I would stay forever, but...",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Okay. So then we're going. We're going right now. Right?",
        "Jonathan: Right.",
        "Tammy: Here we go.",
        "Jonathan: Here we go. Absolutely.",
        "Tammy: Jonathan, we have to. Come on. Mom.",
        "Cassie: Well, I guess I should have seen this coming, huh?",
        "Tammy: I can explain.",
        "Cassie: No, honey, I was the other woman myself not too long ago. So, no. I am the last person you need to explain this to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Let me guess, you called Mel and she verified that the restraining order had indeed been lifted and that it's perfectly legal for me to see little Sarah.",
        "Lizzie: They made such a mistake.",
        "Alan: And then you called your husband and he didn't answer the phone. I wonder why.",
        "Lizzie: Hmm. No, I hate to disappoint you, Granddad, but I was on the phone with the pharmacy ordering some poison. I figured if you were going to be coming around now, I'd better stock up.",
        "Alan: Empty threats are beneath you, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: Empty? I'm the one that tried to shoot you, remember? And now I have a little girl to protect.",
        "Alan: You protect her, but let me protect you.",
        "Lizzie: From Jonathan? I don't need protection...",
        "Alan: No. No, not from Jonathan. From yourself. Jonathan's doing what comes naturally. He's in love with Tammy, while you are holding on to these false hopes of some kind of marriage that doesn't exist. And it's only going to hurt you more when he leaves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Aaah!",
        "Remy: Whoa, are you nuts?",
        "Marina: No, just nosy. Is my gift in there?",
        "Remy: No, I bought yours a long time ago.",
        "Marina: Well, thanks for coming to Coop and Ava's party.",
        "Remy: I'm sorry, I just got off work a few minutes ago. I'll swing by and see them before they leave.",
        "Marina: It's too late. They're probably at the airport.",
        "Remy: Are they all excited?",
        "Marina: I guess. I don't know. Coop's got this whole weird thing with Ava right now, where he says that he's doing things because it's the best thing for her.",
        "Remy: Maybe he does know best.",
        "Marina: And maybe he doesn't. Did you finish your Christmas shopping?",
        "Remy: What do you think?",
        "Marina: I think you might be in trouble if I don't help you out. Stores are open late tonight, I got a couple hours to kill. What do you say I give you a hand? Let's see the list. Mom, dad, Mel, Chief, Coop... did you even really start?",
        "Remy: Oh, man. I have to go all out this year, too. Mel's in such a bad place right now, and it's totally freaking my parents out. I have to be the perfect son-- from zero to hero.",
        "Marina: No pressure. Remy, you know, you've always been my hero.",
        "Remy: Don't mess with me, Cooper.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) But you make it so easy. So, what did you get Tammy?",
        "Remy: Oh, that's for me to know and for you to find out.",
        "Marina: Oh, and I will find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Olivia: And then Tiny, the teeny, weenie mouse, he said in his biggest voice, \"Who goes there?\" That's what he said. But he heard nothing. And he thought, \"Maybe I'm mistaken.\" You want to open that present, don't you? Yeah. She said not until Christmas, Em. I don't think she'll mind. Go, open it. Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan-Michael: She just threw it away.",
        "Mandy: Maybe she didn't read it.",
        "Alan-Michael: No, she opened it.",
        "Mandy: Well, perhaps she got sidetracked if she was in a hurry?",
        "Alan-Michael: No, she knew this was important. You delivered it to her personally and you told her it was from me. Didn't you?",
        "Mandy: Not really.",
        "Alan-Michael: What do you mean, \"not really?\" That's what I told you to do.",
        "Mandy: I know. It's just, when I knocked on the door a guy answered it, a nice guy. He said Ava was in the shower and that he would deliver it to her. So I just assumed...",
        "Alan-Michael: And you believed him? I took... you're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: It looks like we have a little bit longer before they start boarding our flight. I guess we could have stayed at the party a little bit longer then, too.",
        "Ava: I don't mind getting here early. Is your mouth dry?",
        "Coop: No. Is somebody getting a little bit nervous for the flight? Hmm?",
        "Ava: Not really.",
        "Coop: Not really? Oh, okay, so you just have cottonmouth for no reason then, huh?",
        "Ava: I have nothing to be nervous about.",

        "Ava: Right?",
        "Coop: Right. Right. You trust me?",
        "Ava: I wouldn't be getting on the plane if I didn't trust you.",
        "Coop: Good answer. Tell you what, why don't you get some water before you start boarding?",
        "Ava: Okay. Great idea. Will you watch the stuff?",
        "Coop: Yes. And thank you.",
        "Ava: Okay.",
        "Coop: All right.",
        "Jeffrey: Coop. Where is she? Where's Ava?",
        "Coop: Oh, come on. What do you want to see her for?",
        "Jeffrey: I need to see her, okay? I have to see her.",

        "Little girl: Mommy, Smokey doesn't want to get on the plane. He's scared.",
        "Husband: Smokey's scared? And what about you? Are you maybe just a little bit scared, too?",
        "Mother: Don't be, sweetie. Flying's fun. We're going to have a great time.",
        "Husband: You even get to watch TV on the plane.",
        "Mother: And daddy and I will be sitting next to you the whole time. We won't let anything happen to you.",
        "Husband: Promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, look. I have something for her, okay? I have a Christmas present for her. Not that it's any of your business.",
        "Coop: How did you get it through security?",
        "Jeffrey: Where is she, Coop?",
        "Coop: Look, what do you want to see her for?",
        "Jeffrey: She's my daughter, okay. What do you want me to say?",
        "Coop: Who are you here for, Jeffrey? Are you here for Ava or are you here for yourself? Do you think that getting her a Christmas gift now, it's going to erase all the mistakes that you've made? You're acting as if you care about her.",
        "Jeffrey: I do care about her.",
        "Coop: Uh-huh. Then do you want her to get on that plane tonight with any second thoughts, wondering if there's a father for her in Springfield that she's leaving behind? Let me ask you this. If she stays here, are you going to be that father for her? Are you going to be a good father, and can you... can you honestly promise that? Can you guarantee it? Because if you can't, do you want to put her through that? I mean, why do you want to stop her from doing something really positive for herself when ultimately you know that you're just going to end up failing her again?",

        "Marina: Good job, Boudreau.",
        "Remy: I can't believe I'm done.",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, that's because I am the super shopper of the year.",
        "Remy: Can't argue with that, ma'am. Thank you.",
        "Marina: No thanks necessary. You just got to hold up to your end of the deal now. Tell me what you got Tammy for Christmas.",
        "Remy: Oh, we did not make a deal.",
        "Marina: You owe me.",
        "Remy: Sorry, sorry.",
        "Marina: Oh, come on. Why not? Did you get us both the same stupid generic roommate gift?",
        "Remy: Not exactly.",
        "Marina: Okay, then tell.",
        "Remy: Okay, it's a... a whatchamacallit, a charm bracelet.",
        "Marina: Nice!",
        "Remy: Is it?",
        "Marina: That depends.",

        "Jonathan: Okay. Maybe we should have picked a different place. But this place is kind of special to us, so... probably I'm just making this worse. Come on, let's just go.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan. If you think I'm angry at you, I'm not. But I would like a moment with you before you leave. Alone, please?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Yeah, that's okay. I'll be right out. Okay, Mom. Hit me with the lecture.",
        "Cassie: No, no lecture. Honey, you obviously love each other. Very much. So I can't even tell you it's wrong. And I can't say don't act on it because that would make me a hypocrite.",
        "Tammy: I feel a \"but\" coming.",
        "Cassie: Well, I was afraid that Jonathan's marriage to Lizzie was a mistake, and now I know. Honey, you cannot turn love on and off like that.",
        "Tammy: I know. I know that. That's why we're back together.",
        "Cassie: He left Lizzie?",
        "Tammy: Not yet.",
        "Cassie: Uh-huh.",
        "Tammy: Okay. We're just giving Lizzie a little bit of time to adjust to being a mom, you know? And to make sure that Alan's out of her life. And then we're all going to sit down and we will tell her honestly how we feel. And Jonathan will get a divorce.",
        "Cassie: How long do you think that's going to take, honey? How long do you think it's going to be until Lizzie, who isn't especially emotionally stable, is going to be okay with what you're planning?",
        "Tammy: I don't know.",
        "Cassie: It's going to take a long time. Months, maybe a year, maybe longer.",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Cassie: Yes. And even then, even after Jonathan is supposedly free to be with you, he's not going to be free. He's going to feel guilty about what he did to Lizzie, and then she's going to use that and use it against him every chance she gets. He's going to feel a pull toward his daughter and want to spend every moment with her. Honey, you are always... you are always going to feel in second place with him.",
        "Tammy: Mom, I'm tried being without him, and I can't do it. I can't, and I don't want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you are a wonderful young lady and deserve better than this. Jonathan is wounded, and he reacts by hurting people.",
        "Lizzie: That sounds familiar.",
        "Alan: Look, what I think he needs is a good shrink.",
        "Lizzie: That is funny that you should say that. (Knock on the door) Come in.",
        "Alan: Well, Dr. Baker. I can assure you Elizabeth that I did not call him.",
        "Lizzie: I know. I did. Dr. Baker is not only aware of my history of emotional problems, Granddad, he's also aware of yours.",
        "Dr. Baker: Lizzie tells me you've been very stressed out lately, Alan; acting very irrational.",
        "Lizzie: I really think that you need to rest, Granddad. Someplace where you won't be disturbed.",
        "Alan: Why do I get the feeling that I'm being set up?",
        "Lizzie: See, doctor, he's paranoid. There, there. Just try to relax. We just want you to get better.",

        "Coop: You're okay, you're okay. You're here now, you're fine, okay? Let's just grab the bags.",
        "Ava: All right. Do you have the tickets?",

        "Ava: Why would I avoid you?",
        "Alan-Michael: I don't know. I thought maybe the job offer I had messengered over to you offended you or something, because you didn't bother to respond.",
        "Ava: What job offer?",
        "Alan-Michael: Very funny.",
        "Ava: I'm serious, what are you talking about? What job offer?",
        "Alan-Michael: It's a new opening at Spaulding. It would be a promotion for you with a big raise. I put it all in writing and had my new assistant deliver it to your room. She said you were in the shower so she left it with someone else. Are you saying you never got it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I thought we had an understanding, Doctor.",
        "Dr. Baker: I got a better offer.",
        "Lizzie: I am so worried about him, Dr. Baker. He has this bizarre attachment to my baby. I mean, since before she was even born he's been trying to steal her away from me and raise her as his own. I don't know. I'm sure that you have a lot of different types of tests that you can run on him to see what's going on inside his poor, feeble mind. I'm sure you're going to have to hold him for observation for 72 hours, at the very least.",
        "Dr. Baker: Oh, quite possibly longer.",
        "Alan: You're going to far with this, Elizabeth.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, it's okay. We just want to help you.",
        "Alan: You're this desperate to prove to yourself that Jonathan loves you? He will never love you, do you not understand that?",
        "Lizzie: He does love me, and I am not going to let you get in the way. I am not going to end up like every other Spaulding, miserable and alone. My marriage is going to mean something, and the only way I have a fighting chance is if you are out of the picture.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You okay? You've been kind of quiet since your mom had a word with you.",
