        "Ross: Everybody ready for a Christmas story?\r\n",
        "Meta: Oh, yes. ",
        "Ross: Is that okay with you, Clarisse, my \r\nlittle birthday girl? I'll take that as a yes. There you go. Oh, actually, you \r\nknow something, this is a Christmas Eve story, and it takes place right here in \r\ngood old Springfield. ",
        "Blake: Here I come. ",
        "Meta: Oh, for heaven's sakes. (Talking over \r\none another) ",
        "Blake: It's okay, Ross, don't wa... Don't get \r\nup really. We can manage. ",
        "Ross: I should hope so, you've got the tree \r\noutnumbered four to one. I was about to tell the kids a story. ",
        "Holly: Well, carry on, we'll just work around \r\nyou. ",
        "Michelle: May grownups hear the story too?\r\n",
        "Ross: If you promise to behave and be quiet \r\nback there. ",
        "Meta: Beautiful. ",
        "Ross: So our tale takes place in Springfield \r\non a typical Christmas Eve. But this night is not so typical as you may first \r\nbelieve. For 'tis a season of magic, when love and faith renew. A time when \r\nmiracles can happen. And as you'll see, they surely do. Our tale begins with the \r\ntown folk completing their holiday chores. The women are being domestic, the men \r\nare hitting the stores. For the men have put off shopping till the very last \r\nmoment of all. ",
        "Blake: Typical. ",
        "Ross: So on Christmas Eve, they find \r\nthemselves, where else, but at the mall? The rest of the town had bought their \r\ngifts and were now so safe and sound, trimming their trees or cooking or chasing \r\nthe kids around. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas... Loved ones came from far \r\nand near to share this special day. ",

        "Marah: Hey, where's your Christmas spirit.\r\n",
        "Josh: Now, listen, listen, listen. Settle \r\ndown. Settle down. Settle down. Now, there's a fund raiser going on over at the \r\nTowers, their Santa got sick and I'm the fill in and we're late. Smile. \r\n",
        "Cassie: That's right. And Santa can't make an \r\nappearance without his trusty elf. ",
        "Shayne: I am not. I am not wearing this in \r\npublic. ",
        "Josh: Easy, easy, easy, son. Come on. \r\n",
        "Shayne: I'm going to die because it's 75 \r\ndegrees out. ",
        "Josh: 65. ",
        "Shayne: Look. Big difference, look. It's the \r\nhottest Christmas ever on record. ",
        "Josh: Settle down. Breathe, I'll make you a \r\ndeal. I'll make you a deal. You don't want to wear the outfit, just wear the \r\nhat. ",
        "Shayne: The hat is the worst part! \r\n",
        "Josh: Shayne, come on. ",
        "Billy: Okay, what's all the ruckus? \r\n",
        "Marah: Oh, Shayne's just being a scrooge.\r\n",
        "Josh: Wait a second. Give me that. Let's see \r\nhere. (Laughter) What do you think, huh? ",
        "Reva: I like that. ",
        "Josh: What do you think? Is this going to \r\nwork? Look at that. (Cheers) All right, you're the elf for the night, let's \r\ngo. Come on, let's go. Good-bye, everybody. Bye. ",
        "Reva: Bye. Okay. Okay. Not so fast you \r\ngrouchy gnome. While I'm away, you go out and get the firewood. ",
        "Shayne: What? So we can have a steam oven in \r\nhere? What are you doing? Where are you going? ",
        "Reva: I'm going to go and get the food.\r\n",
        "Marah: Mom didn't have time to cook so she's \r\ngoing to pick some food up. Oh, don't forget to pick up R. J.'s birthday cake.\r\n",
        "Reva: Ah, that's right. Thank you, ma'am.\r\n",
        "Shayne: Talk about lousy Christmas spirit.\r\n",

        "\r\nRoss: Now do you get the picture? The prevailing attitude? The citizens of \r\nSpringfield are in a very disgruntled mood. While children know that Christmas \r\neve is magically enchanted, sometimes adults forget or take this day for \r\ngranted. We fuss and fight and hold a grudge all through December. So on this \r\nnight, we need a nudge, a lesson to remember. ",
        "Radio announcer: Springfielders, hoping for a \r\nwhite Christmas? You'll have to wait another year. We've got Indian summer in \r\nDecember, folks. 67 degrees and not a hint of precipitation\u00a0 in sight. \r\n",

        "Ross: If you ladies will allow me to \r\ncontinue, you'll find out everything, okay? Now when last we left our story, \r\nChristmas Eve was looking grim. Petty squabbles now prevailed and Christmas \r\nspirits were pretty dim. But a powerful force had started working its magic on \r\nthis town, for the snow-- at first just flurries-- was really coming down. And \r\ndown.. And down. ",

        "Rick: No, no, it's not just a high-tech \r\npager, it's a super- duper Blackburn 1600. ",

        "Rick: They just sold the last one. That woman \r\njust bought the last one. ",

        "Danny: I thought I smelled something. \r\n",
        "Gus: Yes, it is. Oh, did Harley want one of \r\nthese? It figures because it is the best pager on the market. Yes, it is. The \r\nvery best. No, don't... Do not go into your... You're going to go into your \r\nwallet, right, and you're going to offer me money so you can be Mr. Bigshot and \r\ngive it to Harley. Don't. Don't do that. ",

It's a story that was \r\ntold to me by this really incredible man by the name of Harlan B. Lewis. It \r\ntakes place on a battlefield in Europe, Christmas eve, 1917. There'd been fierce \r\nfighting all day long between the allies and the central powers. And their front \r\nlines were getting closer and closer, barely a half an acre apart at this point. \r\nBut as night drew closer, the shooting subsided. And all the soldiers got into \r\ntheir trenches. They were clutching their rifles, and they were lonely, and \r\ntired, and they were freezing cold. And as midnight drew near, their thoughts \r\nturned homeward. They started thinking about all the celebrations that they'd be \r\nmissing and the loved ones that they may never see again. And a hush fell over \r\nthe forest. And at the stroke of midnight, there was absolute silence. And \r\nsuddenly out of nowhere, the faint, sweet sound of music filled the air. Someone \r\nstarted playing \"Silent Night\" on a harmonica. And a German soldier who was so \r\ndeeply moved by it stood up, he got right up out of his trench and he stood up, \r\nunarmed in front of everyone and started singing, in German: Silent night holy \r\nnight... Then an American boy started, and then another German, and an Italian, \r\nan Englishman. Pretty soon, all the soldiers from every country were singing \r\n\"Silent Night\" in their own native language. Tears were streaming down their \r\ncheeks and they were singing of joy and beauty, defying hatred and war. And for \r\none brief, perfect moment, there truly was peace on earth. ",
        "Olivia: So, what happened? ",
        "Edmund: They all got back in their trenches \r\nand the fighting resumed. So, what was the point? ",
        "Reva: I guess that a few seconds of peace and \r\njoy are better than none. You know when the three of us get out of here, when \r\nthis elevator starts moving again, and we walk out of here, our battles are \r\ngoing to start all over again, too. And I don't exactly feel like singing. (\r\nWhispers) But I have got boxes full of food. (Laughs) I do. Anybody up for \r\nChristmas Eve dinner? ",
