        "Frank: No peeking, Zach. (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Okay, you can open.",
        "Zach: It's a butterfly! (Laughter)",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Harley: It's a special gift from Daddy.",
        "Zach: Daddy?",
        "Harley: Yes. He does his Christmas shopping early and this was a special gift for you from him.",
        "Harley: Ross found Phillip's gift list in his personal things. And this something that he wanted him to have.",
        "Buzz: Phillip was always prepared, wasn't he?",
        "Frank: Zach, what is that?",
        "Zach: It's a butterfly.",
        "Buzz: Oh, I never seen anything like that before.",
        "Frank: Yeah, but why a butterfly?",
        "Buzz: Well, some say a butterfly can ??? his wings in China someplace like that and it will trigger off a chain of events and cause an earthquake or make a rainbow half way across the world.",
        "Zach: What does that mean? (Laughter)",
        "Buzz: It means that everything that happens in the whole world is connected to everything else.",
        "Zach: Even in Springfield?",
        "Buzz: Oh, especially Springfield.",
        "Zach: Okay.",
        "Buzz: You see, in Springfield like anywhere else no one is really ever alone because everything and everyone is connected, especially today.",
        "Harley: What's today?",
        "Buzz: What's today?",
        "Zach: Christmas.",
        "Buzz: Yeah, Christmas is the best time for miracles to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: How are you doing?",
        "Reva: I miss my kids.",
        "Josh: Me, too.",
        "Jonathan: But you still got the Grinch. Ho, ho, ho! (Laughs)",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Even, you know, connections seemed ripped up, falling apart, you know, like blanket that your Mommy just wants to wash. It's gets worn. It's full of holes, right?",
        "Zach: It's still good. (Everyone laughs)",
        "Buzz: My point exactly, everything about that blankie that made you love it is still good. It's just that it's hard for other people to see sometimes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Okay, who is next on the delivery list?",
        "Tammy: How about Aunt Reva? I don't want to be the one to keep you from your own sister. I am with my wonderful daughter, the man that I cannot wait to marry. I feel like the luckiest girl in Springfield.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Even though that connection is as real as the stars in the sky, sometimes you can't feel the strings at all. You feel empty. You feel alone. Like happiness is for other people. Not for you. But you know what the good news is? The world is full of heroes. All it takes is one person in another person's life.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Can I just... Dad, look, you're not getting me. There is no way I'm celebrating the holidays while Olivia's locked up at Ravenwood, okay? No, it cannot wait till tomorrow. I'm not going to let Alan steal Christmas from Olivia and Emma.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Coming around. Excuse me. Oh, there goes Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs)",
        "Gus: Say hello, Roxy.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Oh, wonderful. Wonderful. I mean Emma's first Christmas with the Spaulding's. We need a record of this.",
        "Gus: Smiles, everybody. Smiles.",
        "Lizzie: Say hi.",
        "Alexandra: Okay. All right. All right.",
        "Gus: Dad, get a little close. Say a little Christmas cheer right there. Hello, Emma.",
        "Alexandra: There. Oh, I thought you might have been spending at least a little time with Harley and her family, huh?",
        "Gus: Well, she's where she's supposed to be and I guess I am, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: (Whispers) Hey, thank your Dad for the butterfly.",
        "Zach: Thank you for the butterfly, Daddy.",
        "Harley: The star is Phillip's way of watching him and letting him know that he loves him.",
        "Zach: I want to play with my butterfly.",
        "Frank: I don't know if that's such a good idea, because if you take off the lid...",
        "Buzz: Oh, no, Zach.",
        "Frank: Oh, there it is. I'll get it right there.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Frank!",
        "Zach: Daddy needs a star. That's how he could see us.",
        "Frank: Oh, Zach, I am so sorry. That was total accident. I apologize.",
        "Harley: You know what, buddy? Accidents happen, you know. It was just an accident.",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Like the time that Mommy climbed up to the balcony at Egan's department store, because I was trying to see that star at the top of their tree.",
        "Zach: And you fell?",
        "Harley: That's right. I fell. Exactly. I was reaching out to touch that star and I fell. That's how I got the scar on my arm remember? And it was just an accident. Sometimes people fall. And the star fell and it was just an accident.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, sis. I should have been more careful than that.",
        "Harley: No, it wasn't your fault. I bumped into you ... you bumped into me.",
        "Zach: That's why Daddy can't see us. No. He needs a star.",
        "Harley: You're right. You're right. He does need a star. And so you know what? I'm going to find another one.",
        "Frank: How are going to do that? Everything's closed.",
        "Harley: Maybe not. I'll find something. Mommy is going to find you a brand new star, baby, okay?",
        "Zach: Promise?",
        "Harley: I promise. Because you know what? It's just like Grandpa said. A butterfly flaps his wings in Company and who knows, across town a star is falling from the sky. And all I have to do is find it, right?",
        "Coop: What's this doing here?",
        "Buzz: Oh, we found that under the tree when we were cleaning up the glass.",
        "Coop: Oh. I thought Lizzie was supposed to take this with her.",
        "Frank: Hold on a second. Where are you going?",
        "Coop: I'm going to go play Santa Claus to the person who needs it, the owner of this place.",
        "Zach: Is Mom coming back soon?",
        "Buzz: Well, if anyone can find a replacement star it's your mother.",
        "[He knows when you're awake...]",
        "Harley: I know I don't deserve a favor. For all I know I'm the reason my son doesn't have his father, but don't punish him, okay? One lousy star, is that too much to ask? Well, what do we have here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I'm not joking, Ross. Alan had Olivia locked up at Ravenwood against her will. Now you're the mayor. Isn't there something you could to get her out of there?",
        "Ross: Bill, I don't mean to sound unsympathetic. But it's Christmas, my friend. Most offices are closed or soon will be. In fact, I have legal problems myself that have been put on hold leaving me to shuttle between Blake and Dinah.",
        "Bill: Come on. Least you get to spend a holiday with your daughter Ross. Olivia's locked up all alone in an asylum.",
        "Ross: Thank you. All right. I'll see what I can do first thing tomorrow.",
        "Bill: Thanks.",
        "Ross: But I cannot promise you anything.",
        "Bill: All right.",
        "Ross: Hey, Harley, Merry Christmas to you.",
        "Harley: Right back at you, Mayor. Oh, by the way, happy anniversary.",
        "Ross: (Laughs) thank you. Say, will you be seeing Gus tonight?",
        "Harley: Merry Christmas, Ross.",
        "Ross: I'll tell Blake that you said hello.",
        "Harley: Please do. Oh, and by the way Olivia, Emma and Bill could use a happy holiday. I mean someone could. So if you could talk to Alan...",
        "Ross: All right. I'll do it right now and I'll do everything I can. Merry Christmas.",
        "Harley: Thanks, Ross. All right, I helped you out with Ross. Now I need your help.",
        "Bill: What you need?",
        "Harley: Scrub up. We have to perform surgery on this can.",
        "Bill: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Gus, you know there's a part of me that wondered if you would be here today with us.",
        "Gus: Well, it's Christmas, almost new years. You think you're going to be able to let you go?",
        "Alan: By all this you mean Phillip?",
        "Gus: I mean wanting revenge. I know it's not easy. You're never going to get over losing your son, but we have to find some way of moving forward.",
        "Lizzie: You know, can I say something?",
        "Alexandra: Of course, you can, darling.",
        "Lizzie: There's obviously nothing than I want more then for my Dad to be alive. But you know, Gus, I think he'd be really proud of you.",
        "Gus: I don't know about all that. Look enough about me, all right. This is Christmas. And it's about children and presents. Look, we got Emma. Right. We got Emma. How did you do that by the way? What did you call a truce there with Olivia?",
        "Alan: Something like that. As long as Emma's with her family where she belongs.",
        "Ross: And what about her mother? Is Emma's mother where she belongs?",
        "Alan: Well Ross, nice of you to join us.",
        "Ross: Well, thank you very much, Alan. I'm feeling the spirit of the season. The spirit of brotherhood and goodwill toward man and woman, and with that in mind and with the Christmas spirit that's in your heart, why don't you tell everyone how you took Olivia and locked her up at Ravenwood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, so I put Lou away. I gave him a big fat hamster with a sugarplum in his mouth.",
        "Reva: You always have the most cherry thoughts.",
        "Jonathan: What's this?",
        "Reva: You're stocking.",
        "Jonathan: Are you kidding me?",
        "Josh: Everyone in the family gets one, Jonathan. Just say thank you and hang it on the mantel.",
        "Jonathan: You bought this for me?",
        "Reva: Hang it.",
        "Jonathan: So... all right. When do we open the presents? Josh, I'd take money, but I already have plenty of that. So how about a stake in the family business?",
        "Josh: Keep dreaming, Jonathan.",
        "Reva: Jonathan, before we open the presents there is on thing that I need from you.",
        "Jonathan: Sure. I'm feeling in generous mood today.",
        "Reva: You could promise me once and for all that you will not show up at Cassie's wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Are you sure about not being with Reva today?",
        "Tammy: It's really okay, Mom.",
        "Edmund: Because Tammy and I can always go back to the farm and see you later.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, we still have to wrap R.J.'S birthday presents. (Phone rings)",
        "Cassie: Hello? Yeah, hi. It's the hotel. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Well, let me see if I have the hotel doctor cell phone number. Yeah. Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bill: I'm fine. Look I don't need any medical attention, Harley, okay. I'm fine.",
        "Harley: This is all my fault. You can't cut a star out of a tin can.",
        "Bill: Well...",
        "Harley: What was I thinking? You're going to need stitches for that.",
        "Bill: What? No. I just need some duct tape. That's all. Please. I'm fine. I don't know. You got any glue back here? You got any stapler or something? (Chorus of angels singing)",
        "Harley: You can't steal the star from somebody else's tree. (Screaming) (ornaments breaking) help!",
        "Bill: You better unplug this thing before she gets zapped.",
        "Harley: Oh. No, I'm fine. I'm just fine.",
        "Bill: What the heck happened? I turn around for one minute and next thing I know you're wrestling a nine-foot Christmas tree.",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my gosh. Harley, did my Christmas tree fall on you. Oh, gosh. You know, there's a doctor right outside, okay.",
        "Harley: No, no. Actually it's my fault. I heard angels singing and then I didn't want to, but, you know, the star was so bright. Did I mention I heard angels singing?",
        "Bill: Wow. I don't know what's going on with the Cooper's today, but they're wrestling Christmas trees. Frank knocked over theirs as the star went shattering.",
        "Harley: No, you have to understand. Zach believes that that's Phillip's way of seeing him from heaven. So I had to find him another star.",
        "Cassie: You could have just asked.",
        "Harley: Well, I don't know. I mean I'm in a mental fog here. All I could see was that star and Zach's little face.",
        "Cassie: Dr. Martin, please come over here. This one has a hand problem and this one's got a problem in her head.",
        "Dr. Martin: Yeah, pine needle lacerations, sap burns and I think there's a gumdrop lodged in your ear.",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Harley: You have to help me find a star.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's exactly what I'm going to do. And I know where to look to.",
        "Harley: You do?",
        "Cassie: Yes. I wasn't going to go over there, but I guess it's in the stars that I do. So come on, let's go.",
        "Harley: How's his hand?",
        "Dr. Martin: I can stitch him up here, but he's going to need a tetanus shot just in case. Unfortunately, I'm on my way to visit a patient at Ravenwood. So...",
        "Bill: Ravenwood. Can you give me a shot there?",
        "Dr. Martin: Sure. But isn't that out of your way?",
        "Bill: No. No, no, I think that will be just fine.",
        "(Radio playing) [I'll be home for Christmas you can count on me...]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Ross, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Ross: Alan, I just talked to Bill. Do we really have to go through this charade?",
        "Gus: Ross, what's going on?",
        "Ross: Well, Bill Lewis claims that Alan took Olivia and locked her up on the false pretense of mental instability.",
        "Alexandra: Well, Ross, it sounds to me like Olivia's husband ought to find her a good lawyer.",
        "Ross: Oh, he did one better than that. He now has the mayor on his side. What a household. Gus, do you think that you could inject some humanity into this family just one day out of the year. Happy holidays, everybody.",
        "Gus: Oh, well, yeah, I'm going to see about the humanity thing. See what Santa delivers.",
        "Ross: All right. Oh, I just saw Harley a few minutes ago. In fact, she was the one who talked me into coming over here.",
        "Gus: Did she seem happy?",
        "Ross: Not really, much like you. Merry Christmas Gus.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Lizzie: Roxy! Oh, my God! Have you guys seen Roxy anywhere?",
        "Alexandra: Maybe she got out the front door when Ross left.",
        "Lizzie: The front door. Wow, that's just great, Aunt Alex!",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, listen. She's probably on the lawn right now. If you had a larger dog you keep track of it better.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad! I can't believe you.",
        "Coop: Merry Christmas.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, just shove it. I need your help. I got to find Roxy.",
        "Coop: Ho, ho, ho to you too.",
        "Gus: So?",
        "Lizzie: Roxy!",
        "Alan: It's not what you think.",
        "Gus: Now wait. So you didn't have Olivia committed so we could have Emma for Christmas?",
        "Alexandra: Anyone for more eggnog?",
        "Gus: Not interested. I'm going to go look for the dog.",
        "Alan: Here we go again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Reva, I ordered that monkey suit before I knew that I was uninvited.",
        "Josh: You've got a long way to go before you're considered part of anything we do, Jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Then I'll just take my stocking and go.",
        "Reva: No, please listen. Look. I don't want to fight. Can we just not fight for one day? Joshua?",
        "Josh: For you darling, absolutely.",
        "Reva: Good. Then it's settled. No conflict for one day.",
        "Jonathan: Well, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas for me. Aunt Cassie. Stranger.",
        "Cassie: Where's my sister?",
        "Jonathan: She's right inside. We're all trying to get along today!",
        "Reva: Cassie. Honey, you're here.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Reva: Oh, I'm so glad you changed your mind. Hi, Harley.",
        "Cassie: Well, we are on a mission.",
        "Harley: Merry Christmas, you guys.",
        "Reva: Merry Christmas.",
        "Josh: How are you doing, Harley?",
        "Harley: I've been better actually.",
        "Cassie: Well, Harley's star on her tree crashed and burned. And Zach really wants another one. I was hoping maybe you had an extra.",
        "Reva: Oh, we put an angel on top of our tree. We have these stars here. Could I cut maybe one of those stars off?",
        "Harley: No, no, no. That's sweet. It kind of needs to be a shining star, you know. (Laughs)",
        "Josh: I can look up around up in the attic if you'd like.",
        "Harley: No. You guys are so nice. I'm sorry for interfering. You know, it's Christmas and you guys are obviously pretty tense actually. So I'm going to go and... okay, I'll...",
        "Reva: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Ah-huh.",
        "Reva: Can you just stay for a minute?",
        "Cassie: You know, really, I don't think that I can...",
        "Josh: Take this. Come with me?",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Josh: We're going to go out to the wood shed for just a minute.",
        "Reva: Okay. It's good to see you.",
        "Cassie: Can I have some eggnog?",
        "Reva: Of course. (Laughs)",
        "Jonathan: So what's this? The part where you slap me around a little bit? Go ahead, because I've been beaten up by bigger guys than you.",
        "Josh: I know. I've heard that story before. And, no, I'm not going to lay a hand on you. I just wanted to give Reva and a sister a little bit of time alone. I'll tell you something else though. I'm really getting tired of hearing you remind Reva of what a rotten childhood you had.",
        "Jonathan: So, what? I should just get over it?",
        "Josh: You've been crying about not having a family. Well, now you have one. What are you going to do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Let's get back to the farm before your mother and have a roaring fire waiting. What do you say?",
        "Lizzie: Have you guys seen Roxy anywhere? You see, Uncle Ross came over and he ran into Bill and Bill told him what happened to Olivia and then he started to tell us, but then he left, he left the door open and Roxy must have...",
        "Tammy: She ran away? Smart dog.",
        "Lizzie: Whatever. Roxy?! Roxy?!",
        "Coop: For some reason the dog seems to love this park, but there's no way we're going to be able to find her.",
        "Edmund: It is Christmas. We could spare a few minutes, I think.",
        "Tammy: All, right.",
        "Coop: Oh, great.",
        "Tammy: Okay, but only because I can't stand to hear Lizzie screaming all over town all day.",
        "Coop: Fine. Perfect. You guys could stay here and just check out this area. Just holler if you see anything, okay?",
        "Edmund: Got you.",
        "Coop: Thanks.",
        "Edmund: That's very generous of you.",
        "Tammy: Do you ever wish you didn't know so many people? Or maybe wish Springfield was a little bigger?",
        "Edmund: No such luck. We're all stuck together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Alex, I miss Phillip so much.",
        "Alexandra: Well, so do I, Alan. But you know, you can't let Gus fill that void. Or Emma or Lizzie.",
        "Alan: Don't even start with that.",
        "Alexandra: She's Olivia's daughter.",
        "Alan: And she's my granddaughter. And she happens to be surrounded by people who love her.",
        "Alexandra: But not by her mother.",
        "Alan: Whose side are you on anyway?",
        "Alexandra: Emma's.",
        "Emma: Emma's.",
        "Alexandra: Emma's. (Laughs)",

        "Dr. Martin: I'm happy to help. But even if you get to your wife, you two will never make it pass the guards on the way out.",
        "Bill: Well, doctor I appreciate everything you do. If there's anything else I'd...",
        "Dr. Martin: Nurse, I'll take that. I'd like to see all my patients. It's Christmas.",
        "Nurse: That is so sweet of you, doctor. Merry Christmas.",
        "Dr. Martin: Good luck.",
        "Bill: Thank you. Mrs. Lewis? Mrs. Lewis?",
        "Olivia: Oh.",
        "Bill: What are you doing?",
        "Olivia: Oh, Bill. You came to save me.",
        "Bill: Of course I came to save you.",
        "Olivia: Can you get me out of here?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Olivia: Good. I don't care. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Bill: So good to see you. But there's good news and there's bad news.",
        "Olivia: What's the good news?",
        "Bill: Well, the good news is Emma's great, okay. And then I'm here. (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: What's the bad news?",
        "Bill: The bad news is I can't get you out, at least not today. But I ran into Ross. He said he's going to look into it, see what Alan did, and he's going to get you out of here.",
        "Olivia: Emma. You sure she's okay?",
        "Bill: Olivia, she's great. She's I mean ... I'm sure she misses her Mommy, but she's good.",
        "Olivia: You can't get me out of here?",
        "Bill: Not today. But I can be with you now. And look. I brought us Christmas dinner.",
        "Olivia: (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Okay. All right, listen. If that food doesn't do it for you, let me tell you about the dream meal we'd be having if you weren't locked up here, okay.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Bill: We'd be having goose, not turkey. We'd be having oyster stuffing and fresh baked bread and roasted chestnuts, of course.",
        "Olivia: You're planning in making all that for me?",
        "Bill: No. You'd do the cooking. I'd be by your side... do the dishes of course. But I'd have to nap first. Maybe some cranberries and snow peas...",

        "Edmund: I thought I saw her, but it turned out to be a squirrel. Did you find anything?",
        "Tammy: Nope. Well, hey, we've done our good deed for the day. Can we go?",
        "Josh: Hey, hey, hey, what are you guys doing out here?",

        "Edmund: Cassie's with Reva?",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. She came by with Harley looking for a replacement star for the tree. I figured I should give the two sisters some time alone.",
        "Edmund: Thank you for that.",
        "Josh: Sure.",
        "Jonathan: It's a Christmas miracle.",
        "Josh: You know why don't the two of you come over to the house for a bit? Just for a short time. You know, I'm sure that Cassie and Reva would both appreciate that.",
        "Tammy: No. I don't know, Josh.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Josh, thanks for whatever. Actually, I'm going to head over to J. Farley's. So tell Reva thanks for that thing. And tell I'll see her around, okay?",
        "Josh: Okay, I'll tell her that.",

        "Buzz: Well, was Lizzie jumping for joy?",
        "Gus: Yeah, she's thrilled. Getting the dog back to it's rightful owner, right? Did my good deed for the day. So... Merry Christmas, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: Where are you going?",
        "Gus: I got stuff to do, you know.",
        "Buzz: What stuff?",
        "Gus: It's complicated, Mr. Cooper. I'm the one who complicates things, really. So if you see your daughter, just tell wish her a merry Christmas for me.",
        "Buzz: Why don't you do it yourself?",
        "[Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh... whoa... Whoa... (applause)]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Very nice.",
        "Reva: You know what? Remind me to thank the angels for this moment?",
        "Tammy: It's not the angels you should thank.",
        "Reva: What, honey? Oh, that's a good one.",
        "[Oh, holy night the stars are brightly shining it is the night of our dear savior birth long may the world in sin and ever pining till he appears and the soul has his word a thrill of hope the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks of new and glorious morn fall on your knees oh hear the angels voices o' night devine o' night when Christ was born o' night divine o' night o' night divine.]",

        "Olivia: I can't pretend that this meal is like the meal we should be having. I should be with my little girl.",
        "Bill: Hey. And you will be. Okay, you will be. Let me tell you about next Christmas. We're going to do it at our own home. No Spaulding's allowed.",
        "Olivia: We're getting a house? Who's picking up the mortgage? You or me?",
        "Bill: (Laughs) Always the bottom line with you. I don't know. Who cares. Okay, maybe we'll go to Cross Creek. Just me, you and Emma. Everything you ever dreamed of.",
        "Olivia: Promise?",
        "Bill: I do.",
        "Olivia: You know, this us thing--this married life--it doesn't feel much like business anymore.",
        "Bill: Hmm. Where's mistletoe when you need one?",
        "Olivia: We don't need no mistletoe?",

        "Alan: Emma, look at what granddad's got? A gold watch with ruby inlays and sapphires. Isn't it beautiful?",
        "Alexandra: Are you sure you want to dangle that in front of her, Alan? She might smash it to pieces.",
        "Alan: Well, if she does and if it makes her happy, it makes her granddad happy.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well, well, well. She's certainly proving she's a Spaulding. Her eyes light up at the sight of gold. (Both laugh)",
        "Lizzie: They found her! She's over at Company. Oh, I'm so excited. We found her.",
        "Coop: Yeah.",

        "Lizzie: What is that? There's hair on it?",
        "Coop: It's pig's ear. Look, dogs love them. I got it for Roxy. I thought that she'd... [Coop's thoughts: you thought I was going to spend my perfectly good money on a gift for you, didn't you?]",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know what? [Lizzie's thoughts: You don't see me handing you anything either.]",
        "Coop: Fine. You know what? I'm glad you got your dog back. Merry Christmas. [Lizzie's thoughts: little brat.]",
        "Lizzie: Merry Christmas to you, too. [Lizzie's thoughts: jerk.] (Laughs)",

        "Harley: Oh. Well, Frank broke the star on the tree.",
        "Gus: Did he use your head? (Both laughs)",
        "Harley: Zach's butterfly got out. Frank tried to catch it, the star broke, Zach got upset. So I went hunting for a replacement. Outside Beacon I found a tin can with a star on it.",
        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Harley: Bill cut his hand. But the doctor took him over to Ravenwood.",
        "Gus: Oh.",
        "Harley: Then I tried to boost the star at Beacon and the tree fell on me. But Cassie brought me over to Reva's except she didn't have a shining star. But it brought Cassie and Reva together. So that was good.",
        "Gus: Did you and Bill run into Ross at all?",
        "Harley: Yeah, yeah. Why?",
        "Gus: I was just asking.",
        "Harley: So what are you doing here?",
        "Gus: I started out looking for the dog, but I think that I'm here because Zach's butterfly got loose.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Frank: I got it! I got it! I got it! Oh, no, she slipped away. Come on. Come here. Come here. Come here.",

        "Frank: Don't scare... whoa! Hey!",
        "Gus: I got her. Look at this. A star.",
        "Zach: A star.",

        "Gus: Here you go.",
        "Frank: Come on you guys.",
        "Harley: I knew it. I knew it. I knew we would find one.",

        "Gus: Merry Christmas. Roxy?!",
        "Frank: Oh, no!",
        "Buzz: She's gone.",
        "Frank: Now Roxy got loose. Where did she go? You think she's in the kitchen?",
        "Buzz: See, one little flap of the wind this morning, a little earlier and that's what we got. I mean it's not a tornado. But you can't tell me those two aren't forces of nature.",
        "Zach: I love you, Grandpa.",
        "Buzz: I love you more. [Buzz, looking into the camera: Any second now they're going to realize this kiss has to stop. And then tomorrow we'll all go back to being selfish, frightened, misguided people. But in this day, in this moment, we know what it's like to love and to be loved. To be connected, because we all really are. I mean it's a simple idea, but it's a hard one to fully appreciate. So no matter how difficult this task, we all have to promise not to stop trying to make good on these connections. That's what being human is all about.]",
