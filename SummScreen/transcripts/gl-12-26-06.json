        "Gus: This is good. ",
        "Harley: Your very first as part of our family, right? ",
        "Gus: ... Little stiff, get in there. ",
        "Zach: Don't push me, Gus. ",
        "Gus: Don't pretend... don\u2019t... just don't act like you're on camera. Go \r\nahead. ",

        "Lizzie: Look, Sarah. It's your very first Christmas. Feels like it's mommy's \r\nfirst Christmas, too. First Christmas as Mrs. Jonathan Randall and first \r\nChristmas as your mommy. ",
        "Alan: Why did Jonathan show up at the barn? ",
        "Lizzie: You know why. ",
        "Alan: Think, Elizabeth. Why? ",
        "Lizzie: You sent him a bogus text message! ",
        "Alan: If it had been from me, he wouldn't have shown up. I didn't send it \r\nfrom you, I sent it from Tammy. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry mommy looks so sad, honey. There's no reason to. You know \r\nwhy? Because daddy loves us very, very much. This is going to be the best \r\nChristmas ever. Yeah. ",

        "Tammy: You, too. ",
        "Jonathan: You find it? ",
        "Tammy: It wasn't in the barn. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, that's where I took it off. You don't have an extra one lying \r\naround, do you? ",
        "Tammy: Sorry. It's got to be somewhere, right? It'll turn up. ",
        "",
        "Alan: It's Christmas and I demand to be released! I'm not a criminal. I'm not \r\ninsane. My granddaughter's delusional. She thinks her husband loves her and he \r\ndoesn't love her at all. I've got to get out of here so I can help their child. \r\nWell, well, well. Finally you come. Now, you've got to get me out of here so I \r\ncan go home to my family. ",
        "Beth: No need, Alan. Your family's come to you. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. ",

        "Ava: Have this. ",
        "Jeffrey: What's this? You've given me a knife? ",

        "Olivia: You really love that dolly, don't you? ",
        "Emma: Yes, but Ava gave it to me. ",
        "Olivia: I know. I know that Ava gave it to you. ",
        "Emma: She's my sister. ",
        "Olivia: You know what, sweetie, we have to get to Harley and Gus\u2019s. You need \r\nyour jacket. Buzz is going to meet us there. It's going to be the best Christmas \r\never. ",
        "",
        "Jeweler: Mr. Cooper? ",
        "Buzz: Renee, hey. ",
        "Jeweler: Nice to see you again. Do you need to buy a last minute gift? ",
        "Buzz: No, actually, I... I was wondering if you take returns. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: I really want to see you today. ",
        "Tammy: Yeah, me, too. ",
        "Jonathan: Can you stay at the bar for awhile and then as soon as I can get \r\nout of here I'll come meet you? ",
        "Tammy: Oh, that would be great but this is your first Christmas with Sarah. ",
        "Jonathan: I know. And I'll be with her. I'll stay until she takes a nap. ",
        "Tammy: I don't want Lizzie to get suspicious. ",
        "Jonathan: Are you saying you don't want to see me on Christmas? ",
        "Tammy: Well, what do you think? ",
        "Jonathan: I think I can't wait. ",
        "Tammy: So you'll be here soon? ",
        "Jonathan: As soon as I can. ",
        "Tammy: And then next Christmas, we'll be together for real. ",
        "Lizzie: Is it cold outside? ",
        "Jonathan: It's not that bad. ",
        "Lizzie: Who were you talking to on the phone just then? ",
        "Jonathan: Um... the new bartender at Outskirts. I thought I'd fixed that \r\nplumbing problem the other day, but he said that the sink is backing up again, \r\nso I think I need to go over there and tinker with it again. Later. Later, after \r\nwe open our presents and we put her down for a nap. ",
        "Lizzie: Good. Have you talked to Tammy recently? I was just wondering what \r\nshe was up to today. You know, I heard that Josh and Cassie took R.J. skiing. ",
        "Jonathan: I don't know what she's doing. ",
        "Lizzie: Maybe she's just spending the day with Remy and his family. ",
        "Jonathan: Maybe. ",
        "Lizzie: Can I ask you something? ",
        "Jonathan: Okay. ",
        "Lizzie: What were Christmases like for you? ",
        "Jonathan: Christmases... what... ",
        "Lizzie: Like, were they ever happy? ",
        "Jonathan: Wow... well, my dad would fall asleep sometimes. At least it would \r\nbe quiet. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh. I'm sorry. It's not going to be like that for our little girl, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Jonathan: No, it's not. ",
        "Lizzie: So what about now? Are you happy now? ",
        "Jonathan: She makes me very happy. ",
        "Lizzie: You make me very happy. Part of me wishes that Reva was here and not \r\nvisiting family in Oklahoma, but it does feel good to have the house to \r\nourselves for our first Christmas. It's cozy, right? ",
        "Jonathan: Look at all these presents. This whole pile is for you. ",
        "Lizzie: It is? ",
        "Jonathan: Mhmm. Here. ",
        "Lizzie: Oh, good. Jonathan, where's your wedding ring? ",

        "Marina: Well, you should have come here! I know, but California just isn't \r\nChristmassy to me. I'm actually looking forward to having a wonderful Cooper \r\nChristmas holiday. Speaking of, here's grandpa, so I gotta go, but I will talk \r\nto you later. I will. I love you. Merry Christmas, Mom. That's from mom. ",
        "Buzz: Oh, it is? How is the lady? ",
        "Marina: She's good. I think that she's upset that I'm not there for \r\nChristmas. Actually, I think she's more upset that I don't have someone to \r\n\"share the holidays with.\" ",
        "Buzz: You have a house full of people to share the holidays with. ",
        "Marina: I know. That's what I keep telling her, but she goes on and on about \r\nhow I have this job that I spend too much time on and I don't make enough time \r\nfor a boyfriend. ",
        "Buzz: She... ",
        "Marina: Don't! If I wanted a boyfriend I could scrounge one up somewhere, but \r\nI actually like being on my own. It takes the stress out of the whole gift \r\nexchange thing. You know, what if I give him a cashmere sweater and he gives me \r\nan umbrella? Or vice-versa? ",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) ",
        "Marina: Seriously! It's very stressful and I'm glad to be on my own. ",
        "Buzz: (Laughs) ",
        "Marina: So do you want to go to Gus and Harley\u2019s together? ",
        "Buzz: Yeah, you go ahead. I'll... I have things to do. ",
        "Marina: Don't tell me you haven't finished your Christmas shopping. You are \r\nworse than dad! ",
        "Buzz: I have a decision to make. ",
        "Marina: You're not going to cut and run, are you? ",
        "Buzz: What? ",
        "Marina: You've got this look on your face. You've got the look on your face \r\nlike it's Christmas, you're stressed out and you just want to go have Chinese \r\nfood somewhere by yourself. ",
        "Buzz: I will be there. I have a call to make. ",
        "Marina: Well, I would wait around, but I don't want to miss the kids opening \r\ntheir gifts, so I will see you later. I love you, go get lost.\r\n",
        "Buzz: I won't run. But I won't get lost. I just have to decide how I want \r\nthis day to end. ",

        "Beth: So, how are they treating you? ",
        "Alan: Like I'm crazy. ",
        "Beth: Well, with all the ranting you're doing, it's no wonder. ",
        "Alan: I have every right to rant. Elizabeth's got me locked up in here until \r\nthey can take me away to Ravenwood where they can run some psychiatric \r\nexaminations on me. ",
        "Beth: You know, the more you yell, the more you make Lizzie\u2019s case for her. ",
        "Alan: Not if you can talk her out of it. Now, you have spoken with her, \r\nhaven't you? ",
        "Beth: Oh, I spoke to her about her Christmas plans. ",
        "Alan: Did you mention me? ",
        "Beth: Well, don't take this the wrong way, Alan, but you have been acting... \r\nodd. You've been acting obsessive and irrational. Maybe a little R & R would do \r\nyou some good. ",
        "Alan: R & R? R & R is a spa where they give you massages and mud baths. No! \r\nRavenwood is where they put you in tiny little rooms with bars on the windows, \r\nBeth. Don't you understand? ",
        "Beth: Yes, no fun for a claustrophobic. You know, it's surprising that Doris \r\nWolfe can't help you with this situation. I guess that's a conversation for \r\nanother time. The fact is, you have no one to blame but yourself for this. You \r\nmust have frightened Lizzie an awful lot for her to take such drastic action. ",
        "Alan: Elizabeth is only frightened of the truth. You see, I told her that her \r\nhusband is involved with his girlfriend Tammy Winslow again. ",
        "Beth: How do you know that? ",
        "Alan: I sent them both text messages and said, \"Meet me in our special \r\nplace.\" Guess what? They showed up in Cassie\u2019s barn. ",
        "Beth: I have something for you, Alan. You can consider it my Christmas \r\npresent. ",
        "Alan: Gonna get me out of here? ",
        "Beth: This could just do the trick. ",
        "Alan: Ah. ",
        "Rick: Merry Christmas, Alan. ",
        "Alan: What's he doing here? ",
        "Beth: Well, Rick is going to examine you. If he feels you're mentally fit, \r\nyou could get out of here as early as this evening. ",
        "Rick: But on the other hand if, you know, I find you're just a little \r\nkoo-koo, you might spend New Year's with a straight jacket on. ",
        "Alan: Nice gift. But I want a real doctor! Not some quack who shacked up with \r\nmy wife. ",
        "Beth: (Clears throat) ",
        "Alan: Where are you going, Beth? ",
        "Beth: I can't hear you. ",

        "Frank: Oh, good, good. Zach, get your present there, big man. Come on, open \r\nthat up. What is it, what is it? ",

        "Jeffrey: Hey, Gus. ",
        "Gus: Hey, how are you? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, Mel and I came up with a strategy to get mean Judge Green on \r\nour side during Sydney\u2019s adoption hearing. I thought I'd, run it down. ",
        "Gus: Yeah? ",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. ",

        "Jeffrey: Yeah, why not? ",
        "Gus: Do you know what day it is? ",
        "Jeffrey: It's a few days before the hearing, so, you know, we should get our \r\nducks in a row. ",
        "Gus: Okay, first of all, let's not worry about ducks right now, shall we? I \r\njust want to say thank you for everything you've been doing with Mel to help to \r\nus with Sydney, but it's Christmas. I don't want you to be, like, a loser or \r\nanything, you know? Don't you have somewhere to be or something to... ? Do you \r\nlike eggnog? ",
        "Jeffrey: I hate eggnog. ",
        "Gus: Oh, come on. I'll make you a little eggnog. It'll put a smile on your \r\nface. ",

        "Olivia: Yeah. Ava gave it to her before she left, and now it's her favorite \r\ndoll. ",

        "Jonathan: Well, you know I took it off when I was working on the plumbing at \r\nOutskirts and I didn't even realize I didn't have it until I got home. I know. I \r\nwas in a rush to get home, but I'll get it when I go back there later, okay? ",

It's about a baby. It's about a little boy baby and a mother and a \r\nfather and a family that was all alone in a strange town looking for a place to \r\nstay for the night. The mom was pregnant. They'd been traveling for days and \r\nthey were dog-tired. But the Inns were filled up, you know? No vacancies. But \r\nfortunately, a kindly innkeeper told them about a stable where they could stay. \r\nYou know, a manger. And it was pretty bare bones. There was straw on the floor \r\nand everything, but they were grateful just the same. And so they settled in for \r\nthe night. ",
        "The mom and the dad thought they were all alone in the manger that night, but \r\nthey weren\u2019t. A star was shining big and bright in the sky above them. A special \r\nstar. Someone who was watching over them. Under the stars' guiding light on that \r\nmagic night, a miracle occurred: A child was born. The baby born that night was \r\nspecial, so special that people came from far and wide to see him. And they \r\nbrought gifts for him, too. Three kings even showed up to pay their respects. \r\nKings were usually only impressed by money and power. They were awed. The baby \r\ntouched their hearts, too. And after the kings, a whole procession of visitors \r\nand well-wishers made their way to the manger. Shopkeepers and shepherds, rich \r\nfolks and poor folks, animals, and angels, too. What? You say you don't believe \r\nin angels? You say you've never seen one? Sure, you have. Angels are with us \r\nevery day. Maybe they don't always have wings and wear white robes. And they \r\nsure don't always have halos, but you better believe there are angels in this \r\nworld. They're amongst us. They are us. In the acts of kindness we show each \r\nother every day, a helping hand we show to a stranger in need, the hope and the \r\nfaith we hold on to even through the worst of times. The spirit of that special \r\nnight, the spirit of goodness, that lives on in all of us. ",
