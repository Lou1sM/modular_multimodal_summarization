        "Danny: Well, that was productive.",
        "Marina: Really?",
        "Danny: Nobody's seen Michelle or Tony, nobody remembers Michelle or Tony, nobody knows where Michelle or Tony went after they checked out.",
        "Marina: So, what next?",
        "Danny: I don't know. I think we just need to, like, hit the local bars, restaurants, hotels, show these pictures of Michelle and Tony around, see what we can find out.",
        "Marina: I wish we had more to go on.",
        "Danny: Yeah, me, too. But we don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tony: Excuse me. Man, I need your help, please.",
        "Concierge: How may I be of service?",
        "Tony: I'm looking for a pilot, anybody to fly me off the island tonight, but everything's booked.",
        "Concierge: It is a busy time of the season.",
        "Tony: I will pay whatever I have to pay. Please.",
        "Concierge: A man claiming to be a pilot just checked in.",
        "Tony: Really, okay, that's good. It's urgent. Please call him. I'll make it worth your while, and his. Please.",
        "Danny: Hello?",
        "Concierge: Hello, this is the concierge. I'm sorry to disturb you. I seem to recall that you are a private pilot.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Concierge: Very good. There's a man here who'd like to speak with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sebastian: Michelle's husband, Danny Santos, is in Santo Domingo. He'll try to get to me. Make sure he doesn't.",
        "Michelle: Great. Sebastian just keeps getting crazier and crazier.",
        "Holly: He's angry. You'd be angry, too, if you were fighting for your life and losing.",
        "Michelle: Oh, that's right. You're on his side. I keep forgetting I'm locked in here with the enemy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: What? Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Coop: No, I'm not looking at you.",
        "Lizzie: All right. Whatever you say. I'm telling you, Roxy is the smartest dog in the world. I mean, who would think she would run to my restaurant, of all places?",
        "Coop: Well, she's smarter than her owner. Pure genius.",
        "Lizzie: Like you even know what a genius is. Maybe I should change Elizabeth and Company to \"Roxy's place.\" What do you think about that?",
        "Coop: Great, sounds just like a strip club. You're the boss. And, Miss boss, don't forget about this, okay?",
        "Lizzie: [Lizzie's thoughts: Does he really think I can be bought with a dog treat?] You know, that was really sweet of you to get Roxy a gift. Seriously.",
        "Coop: I tell you what, how about... how about I drive you over to Company and we can go pick her up?",
        "Lizzie: Mind reader. [Lizzie's thoughts: He can't get enough of me.]",
        "Coop: [Coop's thoughts: I knew it. She'll do anything to be alone with me.]",
        "Lizzie: Well, what are you waiting for? [Lizzie's thoughts: He's dying to kiss me, poor sap.]",
        "Coop: If you want to kiss me, you really don't need the mistletoe.",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs) Me kiss you? Oh, my gosh, don't flatter yourself. You know what? You almost kissed me earlier. If I hadn't have backed off earlier, you would have...",
        "Coop: Oh, my gosh, you've got such a vivid imagination. Lizzie, this isn't worth fighting about, okay?",
        "Lizzie: Fighting is all we do. You know why I think it is we do that? Because we like each other, you know what I mean? [Lizzie's thoughts: Go ahead, Henry, make a fool of yourself.]",
        "Coop: Well, anything is possible, I guess. Except for that. I mean, maybe you're right.",
        "(Together): Cool, it's working.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: I thought you could use some brandy. I know I could.",
        "Beth: No, no, Alan, maybe later. You know, Phillip used to love this ornament. When we were out in Arizona, he'd always tell Lizzie how much he missed the snow at Christmastime so she said that she wanted to buy him snow for Christmas. And you should have seen his face when he opened this. Do you ever dream about him, Alan?",
        "Alan: Phillip? No, no, I don't dream. What about you?",
        "Beth: Every night.",
        "Alan: Every night? It must be comforting to see his face.",
        "Beth: No. They're not good dreams. They're nightmares.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: Wait.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: Can I just...",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: I just want to make sure I'm not dreaming.",
        "Gus: You're not dreaming. If you are, please don't wake up. (Phone ringing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Yeah, Cooper here. I'm on it, O'Neill. I promised you I'd bring in Phillip's murderer tonight, and I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Look, yes, I am a licensed pilot, but I'm not for hire. Just tell the guy it's not about the money. I can't help him.",
        "Concierge: I understand. Sorry to disturb you. Merry Christmas, sir.",
        "Tony: No, no. Hello? Hello? What's the pilot's room number?",
        "Concierge: Sorry, sir, I tried.",
        "Tony: Listen to me. The woman I love will die tonight if I don't get off this island. That pilot is my only hope. Now you're going to tell me where he is. Go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: Sebastian! Sebastian, what the hell are you doing in there?",
        "Holly: Making it worse than it already is.",
        "Michelle: If he dies while we're stuck in this cage, we are going to be shark bait by New Year's. Sebastian!",
        "Sebastian: What? What do you want?",
        "Michelle: I want to help you. Let me give you a shot.",
        "Sebastian: Not this again. Michelle, if I die, it's not going to be because you poisoned me.",
        "Michelle: Let me help you hold on until Tony gets here with the medicine.",
        "Sebastian: No, thanks. For all I know, you'll shoot me up with drain cleaner. You women, you want trust, but you're incapable of loyalty. You pretend to care but you're consumed by your self-serving agendas.",
        "Michelle: That's funny coming from such a generous guy like you.",
        "Holly: He's talking about me. Poor Sebastian. He wants to leave this world bitter and angry when Michelle could help him stay alive. You fought so long to hold on. Why are you going to give up now?",
        "Sebastian: I don't have anything left to hold on to.",
        "Holly: Me. You hold on to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Beth, what kind of nightmares?",
        "Beth: No, it... it doesn't matter, Alan.",
        "Alan: Yes, it does matter if these are torturing you.",
        "Beth: Just... just forget that I said anything, okay?",
        "Alan: Listen to me. We all feel guilty about what happened, but you did not betray Phillip.",
        "Beth: He had my kids.",
        "Alan: I know he did. But I also know that you loved him very much.",
        "Beth: He was the love of my life.",
        "Alan: Beth, are you... are you all right?",
        "Beth: I'm fine, Alan. I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm tired. I just need to get some fresh air.",
        "Alan: Don't even think about it, Mr. Bradshaw.",
        "Coop: Busted.",
        "Lizzie: Well, we were just... we were just leaving.",
        "Alan: Excuse me? \"We?\"",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I'm going with Coop.",
        "Alan: No, you're not. The Cooper's have caused our family enough trouble already.",
        "Beth: Alan, stop.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, I'll tell you what. How about I go back to Company and pick up Roxy? Why don't you just stay here and give me a call me when the coast happens to be clear?",
        "Alan: Your a father wouldn't like this, Elizabeth.",
        "Beth: And maybe that's why it's okay, Alan. Maybe Lizzie can be the one to put a stop to the mess this family has made.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: Frank! I wonder where you'd gotten to.",
        "Frank: I thought I'd give Gus and Harley some space.",
        "Buzz: It does look like a promising new year, doesn't it?",
        "Frank: Well, I'm glad you think so.",
        "Buzz: Look around you. I got out of the hospital in time for Christmas. Zach got his star on top of the tree. The dog didn't end up being road kill, and there's romance in the air, Frank. What more could you ask for?",
        "Frank: It was nice spending Christmas together.",
        "Buzz: Frank, you finally closed Philip's murder case. It's going to be a better year. What is with you? Are you still blaming yourself for having to arrest me? Get over it. Come on, Frank, you were doing your job. I'm proud of you. It's over. The family's together. Everything's fine, Frank. It's fine.",
        "Zach: Ready to go, Grandpa?",
        "Frank: You betcha.",
        "Buzz: You betcha. We're going to go to the park and build a snowman. Shall we let him put on the nose?",
        "Frank: You know what? I would love to go with you guys and build a snowman, but, unfortunately, I've got something to do. Listen, Zach, you have fun with your Grandpa, okay, buddy? I love you, Zach.",
        "Zach: I love you, Uncle Frank.",
        "Frank: You're the best, big man.",
        "Harley: We said this couldn't happen. This couldn't happen. We can't do this.",
        "Gus: Why?",
        "Harley: This is insane. After everything that has happened, really, all the pain, all the hurt, all the nightmares with our family.",
        "Gus: Just come on, please.",
        "Harley: I want to. Believe me, I want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marina: Ready?",
        "Danny: Whoa! Now, how am I going to get people to talk about Michelle and Tony when they're all just going to be staring at you?",
        "Marina: Yeah, I know, it's a curse.",
        "Danny: It's a nice curse.",
        "Marina: Thanks. You ready to hit the streets?",
        "Danny: No, we need to eat something. I ordered room service. It will be up in a minute.",
        "Marina: Good. I didn't want to slow this thing down, but I'm starving.",
        "Danny: Me, too.",
        "Marina: What have you got?",
        "Danny: I've been writing down addresses of nearby hotels. I thought we'd start by this one because it's closest to here, and then work our way around from there.",
        "Marina: Sounds good. Let me see the map.",
        "Danny: This is the local map here. So how do you feel now about ditching your family's Christmas to do this?",
        "Marina: Well, my family is fine. I called my Dad and he was just so anxious to get off the phone with me. He's not worrying about me for once in his life.",
        "Danny: Yeah, because he thinks you're skiing with a friend.",
        "Marina: We can find a mountain on this island somewhere, right? What?",
        "Danny: Nothing. Nothing at all. Food, food, food.",
        "Tony: Listen, excuse me, I don't mean... oh, my God, Danny. Danny, listen, you have no idea what we have been through. I need your help. I need...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michelle: You're not going to regret this, okay?",
        "Sebastian: I guess we'll find out.",
        "Michelle: Before I give you this, can I ask you a question? What is it that's so important about your life? What is it that you have?",
        "Sebastian: Do you have anyone you have to live for, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, I have a son. I have...",
        "Sebastian: Your husband? Danny?",
        "Michelle: Roll up your sleeve.",
        "Sebastian: You were going to say \"Tony,\" weren't you?",
        "Michelle: You know, people tell me that Danny and I were meant to be together. But I don't remember, and I probably never will.",
        "Sebastian: Then there's poor Danny. He's willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for someone, for a woman who doesn't even love him.",
        "Michelle: The ultimate sacrifice? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Sebastian: Just give me the injection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alan: Beth, you're not encouraging her to mingle with a Cooper, are you?",
        "Beth: She can do whatever she wants.",
        "Alan: Not with a Cooper! I want her to set her sights a lot higher.",
        "Beth: Alan, don't be such a snob.",
        "Lizzie: Hello? Do I get a say in this?",
        "Alan: No, you don't. You know how your father felt about that boy.",
        "Beth: And is that what you want for your granddaughter? You want her to pick up the hate where Phillip left off?",
        "Lizzie: Mom!",
        "Beth: Because I don't. I don't want Phillip's obsession to ruin this family. What he drove us to was... I want better for her. I want her to love and be loved. I want her to be happy in ways that Phillip never could be.",
        "Alan: And I want the same thing for her.",
        "Beth: Oh, yes, but only if it's on your terms, right Alan?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, this is my life you guys are talking about.",
        "Beth: And I don't want you to end up like your father. Yes, I want you to carry on his legacy, but I want you to be the best of who he was, not the person he was in the end, not the person who tore lives apart because I'm glad that person isn't ever coming back.",
        "Alan: Beth!",
        "Beth: I'm sorry, Alan. Lizzie, I didn't mean it. I've got to go check on James.",
        "Alan: Christmas without your father has been hard on every one of us. But you don't need to turn to someone like Coop!",
        "Lizzie: I'm not turning to Coop. I don't even like him, okay?",
        "Alan: Well, you have an interesting way of showing it.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, settle down okay? Please. I promise you, this is strictly business, nothing else.",
        "Alan: What kind of business?",
        "Lizzie: Coop has the hots for me, and I can use this to my advantage. He can get his family to quit fighting me on every executive decision I make at Company.",
        "Alan: Very good.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I mean, Dad gave me the restaurant and he believed in me... I know I've screwed up in the past, but I'm not going to do it this time.",
        "Alan: I believe you. And you know something, Elizabeth, if you ever need any help, you can always come to me. We've got to pull together more than ever because we have a lot of enemies.",
        "Lizzie: We'll crush them, right? We'll make Daddy proud.",
        "Alan: I believe we will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: Look, do you know how happy Lizzie is now that you've found little Roxy here? You know how much she loves that little dog, right? (Phone rings)",
        "Lizzie: Coop, do you have Roxy? Is everything okay?",
        "Coop: Yeah, Roxy is actually right here in the arms of her hero, Zach. Tell you what, we're taking her for a walk at the park so...",
        "Lizzie: I'll be right there.",
        "Coop: Lizzie's on her way to the park right now.",
        "Buzz: Oh, goody.",
        "Coop: Look, she's going to be on her best behavior.",
        "Buzz: Oh, even better.",
        "Coop: Hey, Dad, can I talk to you for a second about possibly covering for me tomorrow night at work?",
        "Buzz: What are you asking me for? Lizzie's your boss.",
        "Coop: See, but that's the thing though. Both Lizzie and I are going to be off tomorrow night. Only if you agree and cover for us.",
        "Buzz: Off where?",
        "Coop: We may just go to the movies or something.",
        "Buzz: You mean like a date?",
        "Coop: Wait a minute, I am not the first Cooper to go for a Spaulding. I seem to remember that you hooked up with Alexandra and Harley married Phillip and then almost married Gus. What about Lucy and Alan-Michael?",
        "Buzz: Do yourself a favor. Trust me, find another girl. Come on, big guy. Come on, get up here. We're on our way. She's getting heavy, isn't she?",
        "Coop: He bought it. Good. Hey, pops. Wait up.",
        "Gus: Okay, listen. We could turn down the lights, we could turn up the music and we could pick up where we left off thanksgiving night. Do you remember? Forget Phillip's murderer might still be out there or, even worse, is in your arms right now? Listen, my girl is not a murderer.",
        "Harley: Gus, you don't know that.",
        "Gus: Come on, please. I know I don't want this to end.",
        "Harley: Hey, Frank.",
        "Gus: Frank.",
        "Harley: We thought you left.",
        "Frank: No, not yet.",
        "Gus: What's up?",
        "Harley: Yeah, what is it?",
        "Frank: It's...",
        "Harley: What, you're scaring me. Is it Marina? Is it the kids?",
        "Frank: It's you, Harley. I'm arresting you for the murder of Phillip Spaulding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danny: Get up! Get up.",
        "Tony: What was that for?",
        "Danny: What do you think it was for? You took advantage of Michelle when she was putting her life back together.",
        "Tony: I didn't do anything.",
        "Danny: Except encourage her to abandon her son.",
        "Tony: Danny, that's not what happened! What are you doing here, Marina?",
        "Marina: Nice to see you, too.",
        "Danny: Where's Michelle?",
        "Tony: They're with Sebastian. He's keeping her and Holly hostage on an island south of here. Listen to me. He's dying. He's crazy. He thinks that those two are the only way to save him.",
        "Danny: Where are they?",
        "Tony: I told you, an island south of there.",
        "Danny: Is there an airstrip there?",
        "Tony: Yes, there is. Danny, you cannot go there by yourself. I was there. Listen, I'm the only chance for survival.",
        "Danny: So you left them there?",
        "Tony: He asked me to leave to find Ed Bauer and find a cure for some disease that he's got. He believes he's got the cure. Danny, I need to get off the island tonight!",
        "Danny: No, you're not going anywhere. I found Ed once and I'll find him again.",
        "Tony: Listen to me...",
        "Danny: No, you listen to me! From now on, we do things my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: How's he doing?",
        "Michelle: He's hiding something. He's talking about Danny.",
        "Sebastian: Holly?",
        "Holly: Sebastian?",
        "Sebastian: Holly?",
        "Holly: Sebastian? Are you feeling better?",
        "Sebastian: I'm still breathing. Actually, I... yeah. I am, I'm feeling better. My headache's gone.",
        "Holly: You seem more relaxed.",
        "Sebastian: I've been thinking so much about the first time I saw you.",
        "Holly: Oh. Well, that would be at Towers when you told me Roger was gone.",
        "Sebastian: No, actually it was before that, long before that. And I've wanted you from that moment on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lizzie: Oh, Roxy, baby, come here! Come here, honey! Oh, don't run away like that ever again, okay?",
        "Buzz: All's well that ends well.",
        "Coop: Don't worry about it. Zach was keeping an eye on her every second of the way.",
        "Zach: I did, Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Did you? Thank you. I'm very lucky to have you for a brother.",
        "Coop: Do you want to throw the ball with Roxy? Yeah? All right.",
        "Buzz: Wait a minute. Zach and I have unfinished business.",
        "Coop: Sure. Sure. Here you go.",
        "Lizzie: We'll be right over there, okay, Zach?",
        "Zach: Grandpa, where is it? My snowman was right here.",
        "Buzz: Well, the snow melted fast this time around, didn't it? Let me see, right here a couple of Christmas's ago or so you and your Dad built a snowman here didn't you? And I bet you he gave you a carrot to use for the nose. So then this snowman was special, wasn't it? It was for him. He knows you did it. He knows it.",
        "Zach: I love you, grandpa.",
        "Buzz: I love you, too. And this kiss is from him. I tell you what, I'll make you a deal, okay? Next time it snows we're going to build the biggest snowman ever. It'll be so big it's going to be a watermelon for a nose and a garbage can for a hat and your Dad will know you did it and it will make him happy. Deal?",
        "Zach: I love you, Grandpa.",
        "Buzz: I love you more. Roxy's out there looking for you. You don't want to get on her bad side, do you? Okay. Go get her.",
        "Alan: Very touching speech, Buzz, coming from someone who hated Phillip the way you did.",
        "Buzz: I didn't hate him. I was terrified of what he became. But I had a sort of fondness for him. But we both love his kid, don't we? Our Grandson. Sort of like you with Olivia. You don't like her very much but you have a great favorite here in Emma, don't you?",
        "Alan: Yes, I do.",
        "Buzz: Alan, as a father, I can't imagine what you're going through. But the person that shot your son is dead and gone, so it's time to move your life along. It's over.",
        "Alan: You don't understand, Buzz. It will never be over for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Beth: Rick, hi, it's Beth. I hate to disturb you on the holiday. But... well, if you get this message, I was hoping that we could meet. There's something that I need to tell you about Phillip, about Phillip and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: All right, this is crazy Frank, okay? Because we know that Ruth Karloff killed Phillip.",
        "Frank: I am so sorry, sis.",
        "Gus: It was Ruth Karloff, she jumped off the bridge and she confessed. You closed the case.",
        "Frank: The case is not closed.",
        "Gus: Frank, this is your sister, for God's sakes. Don't go down this road.",
        "Harley: You know about Ruth, don't you?",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Harley: How?",
        "Frank: The scar on your arm. It's the same scar you got from Eagan's department store, which is the same scar that Ruth Karloff had on her arm when she tanked on the bridge.",
        "Gus: That doesn't mean anything. It could have been a reflection.",

        "Gus: How can you do this?",
        "Frank: Because I'm a cop and I'm the chief of police, and a man is dead. Sis, I haven't read you your rights so anything you tell me will be off the record. But I've got to know. I've got to know, sis. Did you shoot Phillip?",

        "Tony: I'm not letting you go. Danny, listen, if you ever want to see Michelle again, you've got to get me to Ed. We've got to find the medicine that Sebastian needs, okay?",
        "Danny: Tony, do you have any idea how long that will take? You don't just fly into Africa and find Ed sitting around a campfire in the middle of the jungle. It could be weeks before you get back. I have to find Sebastian myself.",
        "Tony: And what are you going to do? I was there. You cannot get them out of there.",
        "Danny: I mean, how could you even let this happen? How did you let Michelle even come down here?",

        "Holly: Where?",
        "Sebastian: Springfield. I was looking for Roger and I thought maybe you'd know where he was, so I went to your office and I followed you. I followed you to the park, where you kicked off your shoes and you walked through the grass towards the swings. You were so beautiful. I'd never seen anyone so beautiful. I wanted to run up to you. I wanted to introduce myself but I was afraid that I'd scare you so I just watched. And I've often wondered how our lives might have been different had I run up to you, had I introduced myself, had I walked you home.",
        "Holly: I think you need to ask yourself, where do you want to be right now?",
        "Sebastian: Michelle asked me why I'm fighting so hard to live and it was that night in the park. You touched me, Holly. You touched me with your light, and I feel it now. Even though you've hurt me, I feel it even stronger. And that's all. That's it. That's the only reason I need to fight to live, the only reason I need to fight for my life.",

        "Coop: How about a late movie maybe? [Coop's thoughts: At least I won't have to talk to her.]",
        "Lizzie: [Lizzie's thoughts: So he wants to get me in the dark.] Sure, that sounds good. I guess we can just get Buzz to watch Company for the night?",

        "Harley: Well, for one thing, you would never have allowed it. And second, because... because Ruth was a device. That's all. She was just a device for me to get inside Spaulding. Because I was so angry at Phillip, at all of them, at that whole family, and I wanted a way to chop them down to size.",
        "Gus: Listen to me, just stop talking.",
        "Harley: But then things started getting out of hand because Phillip was getting worse and worse. And then I couldn't stop being Ruth, not until I knew I could protect my family.",

        "Harley: But then it started to look like the real killer was Dad, and he couldn't go to jail. Even a trial was a death sentence for him. And I was in a position to help him, and you weren't. So I started building a case against Ruth to make it look like she killed Phillip, and it worked, it worked for Dad. Even you were happy about that.",
        "Frank: Sis, do you know how bad this makes you look?",

        "Harley: He cut his hand breaking in.",
        "Frank: Harley, Ruth sent Phillip a threatening letter, and I caught you in Spaulding's study trying to steal it back.",
        "Harley: I wasn't stealing it back. I was there to plant it. It was after Phillip died. I was making Ruth look guilty. Frank!",
