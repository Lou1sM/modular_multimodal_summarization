Afterwards, I confronted O\u2019Neill and I ask him if he was going to step\r\nup and be the father that you needed.",
        "Ava: What did he say?",
        "Coop: He didn\u2019t give me an answer, which if\r\nyou think about it , is an answer in itself. Ava,\r\nlook, I didn\u2019t ask the guy to take off. But seriously, he is not worthy of\r\nbeing your father. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be. Oh come on, what did I do now?",
