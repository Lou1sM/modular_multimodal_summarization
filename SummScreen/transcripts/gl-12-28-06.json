        "Cassie: Well, Springfield is still here. You never know when you go away for a\r\nfew days. ",
        "Josh: Well, we are still in the airport,\r\nthough. You never know. Outside could be all pod people. ",
        "Cassie: So if we were to stay in the\r\nairport, does that mean that our vacation wouldn't be over yet? ",
        "Josh: Isn't being with me sort of like being\r\non vacation all year long? ",
        "Cassie: Why, yes, it is, my love. I've got\r\nto get R.J. to that basketball thing. ",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. He's still watching planes\r\ntake off, and Atticus' flight should be in any minute, so... ",
        "Cassie: Yes, the man we had to cut our trip\r\nshort for. You know, I don't like him one bit. ",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. It's just, he doesn't get\r\nthrough Springfield that often, so... ",
        "Cassie: I know. Do you think he's going to\r\nknow anything about Sheila? ",
        "Josh: Well, he's been the Lewis family\r\nlawyer for about 100 years. So if Sheila was in Oklahoma looking into Billy\u2019s estate, he would certainly know\r\nthat. ",
        "Cassie: All right. Well, I just hope that\r\nshe's not after Billy\u2019s money because he deserves more than that. ",
        "Josh: Yes, he does. ",
        "Cassie: Good luck. ",
        "Josh: Thank you. ",
        "Cassie: (Chuckles) You're going to be at R.J.'s thing later, right? ",
        "Josh: Yes, ma'am. I will meet you there. ",
        "Reva: Hello, Joshua. Welcome home. ",
        "",
        "Ava: What are you doing here? ",
        "Coop: It's the first day of your new job,\r\nand I just wanted to wish you luck. ",
        "Ava: Coop... ",
        "Coop: What? ",
        "Ava: I told you I needed some space. ",
        "Coop: Yeah, I know. I get it. ",
        "Ava: No, you don't know or else you wouldn't\r\nstill be here. ",
        "Coop: Ava, it's just a cup of coffee. All\r\nright, call it a break or whatever you want to call it. Look, my route to Co2\r\ncomes right past your door here, so you can expect a cup of coffee tomorrow\r\nmorning, too. ",
        "Ava: If you want to do something nice for\r\nme, give me some space. ",
        "",
        "Jonathan: And then... uh-huh, this one is\r\nfrom somebody who's very special and means a lot to your dad. See the card? It\r\nsays, \"Merry Christmas, Sarah. Love, Tammy.\" ",
        "Lizzie: What are you doing? Checking out the\r\nloot? ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, it's just I've never seen so\r\nmuch stuff for one kid. ",
        "Lizzie: What, are you afraid we're going to\r\nspoil her? ",
        "Jonathan: No, it's great. It's just too much\r\nto put together, you know? ",
        "Lizzie: I could help. And then after we\r\ncould take Sarah to the lake to watch the ice skaters. Or if you feel like\r\nhitting the stores, we are so returning those hideous plates Aunt Alex gave us.\r\nI don't know what she was thinking. ",
        "Jonathan: Why don't you go out and have some\r\nfun? ",
        "Lizzie: No, it will be fun. ",
        "Jonathan: Lizzie, I meant... it's okay. When was the last time you hung out with your\r\nfriends or went shopping with your mom? I bet she has returns to make, too. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, why on earth would I want to\r\ndo that when I could hang out with my family? ",
        "Jonathan: Well, look, I mean, you had a life\r\nbefore Sarah. I don't want you giving that stuff up. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, I don't miss any of\r\nthat. ",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Look, Lizzie, you know, I\r\ndidn't give up my motorcycle, you know? I don't want you to have to give up stuff,\r\neither. Look, our little princess and I are going to have naptime together.\r\nWe're going to have father- daughter bonding. She says she wants you to go out.\r\nShe just told me that-- first words. ",
        "Lizzie: What are you guys going to do\r\ntogether? ",
        "Jonathan: I've got it under control, okay?\r\nCome here. ",
        "Lizzie: I don't even know where to go. ",
        "Jonathan: Put your coat on. It's cold. You\r\ngo wherever you want to go. Don't worry about us. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Thanks, I guess. ",
        "Jonathan: Bye, Mom. ",
        "Tammy: Hey, where are you? ",
        "Jonathan: Home. ",
        "Tammy: I miss you. ",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I need to see you, too. Can\r\nyou get to the Beacon later? ",
        "Tammy: Are you kidding me? I'll be there\r\nnow. ",
        "Jonathan: Give me a half hour. ",
        "Tammy: Is Lizzie with you? ",
        "Jonathan: No, I just talked her into\r\ntreating herself to a day out, so... you know, I think she's actually going to\r\nbe okay on her own pretty soon. ",
        "Tammy: Not soon enough for me. ",
        "Jonathan: Well, as soon as this is over, we\r\nwon't have to sneak around again ever. ",
        "Tammy: Mmm. What will we do for fun? ",
        "Jonathan: I'm sure we'll find something. ",
        "Tammy: See you soon. ",
        "",
        "Lizzie: Thank you for coming so fast. ",
        "Beth: What's going on? You said it was an\r\nemergency. ",
        "Lizzie: I'm losing Jonathan. I can feel it. ",
        "Beth: Oh, honey. ",
        "Lizzie: Mom, I need to be, like, a real wife\r\nto Jonathan now and I need you to help me. ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, have you even had breakfast\r\nyet? ",
        "Lizzie: You know, maybe it was the holidays\r\nbecause I started feeling like Jonathan and I were in a real marriage. But then\r\nhe checked out again, and I am positive that it's Tammy. ",
        "Jonathan: I was just telling ",
        "Lizzie how I was working on the ",
        "plumbing under the bar at ",
        "Outskirts... ",
        "Beth: You know where I found ",
        "this? ",
        "Cassie's barn after you cheated ",
        "on your wife with Tammy. ",
        "Jonathan: Are you going to ",
        "tell Lizzie? ",
        "Beth: I'll have a Bloody Mary. What about Tammy?\r\n",
        "Lizzie: Oh, the fact that he can't stop\r\nthinking about her. ",
        "Beth: How do you know that? ",
        "Lizzie: Because we aren\u2019t... oh, I so don't\r\nwant to be talking about this with you. ",
        "Beth: You called me. ",
        "Lizzie: I know, but it's just that you're my\r\nmom, and it's too weird to just say. It's just... (sighs) Okay, all right. Okay. Pretend that we're at a gas station, you know, the\r\nkind where you can pick self-service or full-service. ",
        "Beth: You have never pumped gas in your\r\nlife. ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I've seen people do it, okay?\r\nThink of my marriage as the car, okay? And it's running okay on the\r\nself-service thing. Jonathan gets out, gets the gas. Okay. I need Jonathan to\r\ntry the full service, because then he can get the gas without getting out of\r\nthe car. ",
        "Beth: Lizzie, what are you talking about? ",
        "Lizzie: We're not sleeping together! I mean,\r\nwe're sleeping together, but we're not sleeping together, okay? Just... I need him to let me get his motor running or he's\r\ngoing to go somewhere else to fill his tank. ",
        "Beth: Okay, okay. So you think that if you\r\nsleep with Jonathan, he's going to forget all about Tammy? ",
        "Lizzie: Okay, no, no. Okay? He can't fall\r\nout of love with Tammy and fall in love with me until I've had a chance to show\r\nhim that I can give him everything he could want from a marriage. It's not\r\ngoing to be some drunken one-night stand. He is, like, 99% my husband, and I'm\r\na good wife. I'm good at that. ",
        "Beth: There are a lot of things that go into\r\na marriage, honey. ",
        "Lizzie: I know. I know, and we have every\r\nsingle one except... ",
        "Beth: Except love. It's not the same thing. ",
        "Lizzie: Will you just help me? Will you\r\njust... please. ",
        "Beth: How? How am I supposed to do that? ",
        "Lizzie: I... I've kind of got it all figured\r\nout. ",

        "Alan-Michael: Good morning. I haven't even\r\ntold you what we're doing yet. ",
        "Ava: Well, you'd better hurry up, because\r\nI'm ready to go. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Well, do you want some coffee\r\nor something? ",
        "Ava: No thanks. Black,\r\nright? Two sugars. ",
        "Alan-Michael: Ava, you don't have to get my\r\ncoffee. You're not my assistant anymore. ",
        "Ava: Well, you haven't given me anything\r\nelse to do. ",
        "Alan-Michael: You've been here like one\r\nminute. ",
        "Ava: Do you want me to get on that 10:30 conference call for you? It's not a problem. ",
        "Alan-Michael: I want you to slow down and\r\nenjoy the first day of your promotion. ",

        "Reva: I mean, really, what's the big deal? I\r\njust wanted to surprise you. ",
        "Josh: Like crashing my meeting with my\r\nlawyer. ",
        "Reva: Shh. People in airports don't like to\r\nhear people using the word \"crashing,\" Joshua. ",
        "Josh: Reva, I've always had a pretty good\r\nworking relationship with Atticus, and I'd kind of like to do this on my own. ",

        "Reva: You think this is really how I wanted\r\nto spend my morning? ",
        "Josh: Why are you here? ",
        "Reva: Because I introduced Billy to Sheila,\r\nthe money magnet. I feel responsible. ",
        "Josh: You are responsible. ",
        "Reva: Well, fine. Then go home and let me\r\nhandle the meeting. ",
        "Josh: Billy is my brother, Reva. ",
        "Reva: And he's my ex-husband. ",
        "Josh: Oh, I see this. You do this kind of\r\nthing for all your exes? Is that the way it works? ",
        "Reva: There may be one I wouldn't do it for,\r\nbelieve me. ",

        "Cassie: What do you mean once he showed up? ",
        "Tammy: It was his daughter's first Christmas,\r\nMom. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, and...? ",
        "Tammy: So, I waited for him at Outskirts for\r\na while, that's all, and it took him a little longer than he thought. ",

        "Tammy: He just needs to be sure that she'll\r\nbe okay without him there all time, that she can take care of herself, maybe\r\nmeet somebody new. ",
        "Cassie: Yeah, sure sounds easy. ",
        "Tammy: Okay, look, you're the one who said\r\nthat this would get complicated. Can't you just enjoy the fact that you were\r\nright? ",
        "Cassie: No, honey, I wish I could but I\r\ncan't because ending a marriage is a big deal. ",

        "Tammy: Well, you guys don't have the easiest\r\nrelationship either. A marriage ended there, too. ",
        "Cassie: Honey, that\r\nis not the same thing. First of all, Reva is more than capable of being on her\r\nown. And secondly, that marriage is already officially over. Josh and I are...\r\nwe are stronger than ever. ",
