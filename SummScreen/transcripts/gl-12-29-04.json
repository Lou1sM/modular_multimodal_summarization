        "Gus: What's up, Frank? Where is everybody? Where's all the customers? The waitress?",
        "Frank: Well, you can thank our new owner, Lizzie Spaulding.",
        "Gus: Where's the old owner?",
        "Frank: He's not down from his room yet.",
        "Gus: Are we here for the same thing, Frank?",
        "Frank: Probably.",
        "Gus: So Buzz doesn't know?",
        "Buzz: Frank, what's going on? What don't I know? Talk to me.",
        "Alan: They're trying to figure out a way, Buzz, to tell you Harley's been arrested. She's in jail where she belongs. You see your daughter is under arrest for the murder of my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: You know, that's just about your favorite Christmas present, isn't it, RJ?",
        "RJ: Just like the real ones that came here.",
        "Edmund: The night the barn caught fire?",
        "RJ: That night was scary.",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Yes, it was. For all of us, but you know, everything turned out okay, and tomorrow something very happy is going to happen in that barn.",
        "RJ: You and Mom getting married?",
        "Edmund: Yes, that's right. We're going to get... you know, that reminds me of something. I have to talk to you guys about something.",
        "RJ: What?",
        "Edmund: You see something out there buddy? No? Okay. You go sit on the sofa, I'll get Will and we'll have a little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: It's one drama after another in here.",
        "RJ: (Echoing): Mommy! I can't get down!",
        "Dinah: (Echoing): You'll be okay. Everything's going to be fine, okay?",
        "RJ: (Echoing): Mommy! Mommy!",
        "Dinah: (Echoing): Everything's going to be fine, okay? You'll be okay. Everything's going to be fine, okay?",
        "RJ: (Echoing): Mommy! Mommy!",
        "Dinah: Now you're going to marry Edmund, you're going to pop out a kid and live happily ever after and you're going to get... (sobs) ...what you have always wanted, once again, and I will always lose! Lose. You win and I lose! (Sobs) Why didn't I just leave you here to die?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: You need help with that?",
        "Sandy: Need some help with that? Not that you need any help. I mean you look beyond beautiful already.",
        "Tammy: Thanks. I didn't hear anyone come in.",
        "Sandy: Oh, I just came by to see if you wanted to go skating later. But I see you're a smidge underdressed.",
        "Tammy: Well, I don't know. This dress might look really nice when I spin. See?",
        "Sandy: Oh. A-ha.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Here you go, sweetie. Now, can you make sure I get some extra towels in my room? Thanks. So, tomorrow's the big day, huh? Big boss lady's getting married. Must seem like a holiday around here for the staff when Mrs. Winslow is not around to monitor quality control. (Laughs)",
        "Maid: Oh, Mrs. Winslow's moving back in. Just for tonight.",
        "Jeffrey: The night before her wedding?",
        "Maid: The bride is not supposed to spend it with her groom. She took a suite. I just finished getting it ready. I think Tammy is staying with her.",
        "Jeffrey: Really? Anything else I should know about?",
        "Maid: Can I help you?",
        "Jonathan: Uh, yeah. My friend in 420 needs some ivory, actually, but this will clean it up perfect. So, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sandy: It worked okay for a spin, but how about a death spiral? (Laughter)",
        "Cassie: (Clears throat)",
        "Sandy: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Hi. Haven't seen you in a while.",
        "Tammy: Sandy just...",
        "Sandy: Dropped by to ask Tammy if she wanted to go skating. And I discovered this vision. Doesn't she look amazing in this dress?",
        "Cassie: She does look amazing. But the dress needs alterations. Today.",
        "Tammy: Mom.",
        "Sandy: Ah. I dropped in, I can drop back out. Oh that's cool.",
        "Tammy: I just don't think Tammy's had a chance to tell you that she had plans today.",
        "Seamstress: Hello, Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Seamstress: Tammy, I'm ready for you in the fitting room.",
        "Tammy: Do not make him leave. Don't leave.",
        "Cassie: I had plans to spend the day with my daughter.",
        "Sandy: No problem. I'm out of here. It's cool.",
        "Cassie: I'm sure you'll see her at home. I mean I know she's living at your apartment now.",
        "Sandy: That's an issue for you and her to discuss.",
        "Cassie: Is it?",
        "Sandy: Cassie, we're on the same page here. I think Tammy would be better off at home, too. But I also think my place is better than the alternatives, and she can crash there as long as she wants to. And I won't apologize for it. Have a nice afternoon with your daughter.",
        "Tammy: You made him leave, didn't you?",
        "Cassie: I have been looking forward to spending some time with you, just us. We haven't done it in so long, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Well, here we are. You know, you haven't gotten rid of Sandy forever. He's my date for your wedding.",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Unless you want me to find someone else. It's not too late to find a replacement. I know. How about JB?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: Hey, buddy. What have you got there? Oh, great. Great. It's your mother's master key to the Beacon. (Laughs) hey, RJ, you know what a master key is?",
        "RJ: It opens all the doors.",
        "Edmund: That's right. It opens all the doors. And if Willy boy here were to have lost it, your mother wouldn't have been able to open any doors at the Beacon, so we're going to put it right over here for safekeeping. Now, let's talk about tomorrow. Not that we're not a family already, but tomorrow, we become more of a fam... Well, tomorrow, we make it... tomorrow we make it official. We make it official, because when two people get married, they make a bond between themselves and the people they love that's even more powerful.",
        "RJ: And then you get to eat cake.",
        "Edmund: (Laughs) and then you get to eat lots of cake. But before that, there's something I have to... there's something I have to ask you. I have to ask your permission.",
        "RJ: What?",
        "Edmund: Well, you guys are the men of the house now and you've been men of the house, well, for a few years, cumulatively, and I'm still kind of an outsider, so I think it's important that I ask you permission to marry your mother.",
        "RJ: Didn't Mommy say yes?",
        "Edmund: Well, yeah. Yeah, she did. But I want you to say yes, too. I do. I want you to say yes and if you say yes, I promise to be the very best Daddy I can be. I promise to love you ... I promise to protect you. So, hey, what do you say? What do you say? Is that good? Do I get two thumbs up? Yeah. Thanks. (Claps) (laughs)",
        "Jonathan: Say yes, kids. Quick. Just nod your head and go along with the program. See, you're going to want to stay on your new Daddy's good side. Believe me. I'm speaking from experience here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frank: Dad, please.",
        "Buzz: Frank.",
        "Gus: Please just stay out of this.",
        "Buzz: You arrested Harley?",
        "Frank: I didn't have a choice. Better me than someone else.",
        "Buzz: Better you... what the hell is going on here?",
        "Gus: Take a deep breath.",
        "Buzz: I'm not going to take a deep breath!",
        "Gus: She didn't do it, okay? She didn't do it, Frank.",
        "Buzz: My daughter's in jail!",
        "Alan: Then why is she in jail, huh?",
        "Gus: Will you please stay out of this, Dad? Please.",
        "Buzz: Why is she in jail, Frank?",
        "Frank: Dad, because the evidence was overwhelmingly against her.",
        "Buzz: What evidence? This doesn't make any sense. What are you guys talking about?",
        "Gus: It's a new development. It makes her look a little bit...",
        "Alan: What my son is trying to tell you, Buzz, is the truth about your daughter is out.",
        "Buzz: The truth is that Ruth Karloff taped her confession and jumped off the William Street Bridge.",
        "Frank: Dad. There never was a Ruth Karloff.",
        "Buzz: There never was...? I was... I was out there with her. I had a heart attack. She called an ambulance. She wouldn't leave until it came. Phantoms don't dial 911!",
        "Gus: She is a real person, yes, but her name isn't Ruth Karloff. Her name is Harley Cooper.",
        "Buzz: Oh, that's crazy.",
        "Gus: Listen to me Buzz. She invented this character to get a job with Phillip Spaulding at...",
        "Buzz: I...",
        "Gus: Let me talk. Please! So she could get a job with him and stop him from ruining lives in this town.",
        "Buzz: No!",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Buzz: I talked to Harley many times about Ruth Karloff.",
        "Gus: I understand that.",
        "Buzz: She never let on anything about...",
        "Gus: I understand that. No, she doesn't want to blow her cover. She couldn't afford that, especially when it came time to protect you.",
        "Buzz: She admitted it? Ruth? The confession? The tape? To save me?",
        "Gus: Buzz... just, the whole thing is like a big misunderstanding.",
        "Alan: Misunderstanding?",
        "Buzz: There's more to it, isn't there, Frank? What is it?",
        "Frank: Dad, Harley confronted Phillip that night.",
        "Gus: They had a little argument and it got a little bit ugly.",
        "Frank: Dad, we have blood evidence linking Harley to the shooting.",
        "Buzz: Oh, God. Oh, my God.",
        "Gus: Buzz listen to me. She is innocent, okay? And I'm going to prove it. We are going to prove this.",
        "Alan: Wait a minute, wait a minute. We are going to prove this? Let me tell you something, Frank. I expect you to show no preferential treatment to your sister. Now, I got you your job back and I can take it away just as easily.",
        "Frank: Gus told you to stay out of this. Now do it before I just...",
        "Alan: Before you what? Are you going to pull your gun on me? When you lose your badge, maybe you can get a job here at Company, working for... (arguing)",
        "Jeffrey: Stop it! Stop it!",
        "Gus: Buzz, Buzz, this is not helping.",
        "Frank: Your father, Gus. Come on.",
        "Alan: Stop it! Get off.",
        "Jeffrey: Knock it off. Knock it off or I'll have you both arrested.",
        "Alan: O'Neill, don't you have something better to do, like ensure that Harley's...",
        "Buzz: Phillip asked for it! He deserves to be dead.",
        "Gus: He doesn't have a case.",
        "Jeffrey: That's okay Buzz. Don't worry about it?",
        "Alan: Doesn't have a case? I'd like to have a seat on that jury.",
        "Gus: Dad, I am giving you ten seconds to get out of here. Ten seconds.",
        "Alan: You know something? I think you've got your allegiances mixed up.",
        "Gus: Dad? Leave.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, all right. He's gone. Fireworks are over.",
        "Frank: Sit down. I said sit down and take a rest.",
        "Gus: Do you need a glass of water?",
        "Buzz: I don't want a glass of water! I want to know how you got my daughter into this mess!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "RJ: Who are you?",
        "Jonathan: I'm Jonathan. How are you doing?",
        "Edmund: Great. And now that you've said hello, say goodbye.",
        "Jonathan: Well, I think it would be really cool if I could spend time with you guys and get to know you better. You know, we could hang out, do stuff, make animal sounds. (Makes monkey noises) (laughs) And maybe when it gets warmer, we could go swimming. And if you don't know how, I can teach you. You know, your Daddy wanted to teach me how to swim when I was a little tiny baby. But he never got the chance, and I think he was really bummed about that.",
        "Edmund: Isn't it really great that your cousin Jonathan stopped by, and it's too bad he can't stay very long because he really has to be going now.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, no. Actually I'm in no rush at all. Besides, Edmund, I brought this gift for you, and I would really love to hear about this big wedding that I'm going to miss.",
        "Edmund: You know what, guys? I think Mrs. Chitwood left your favorite DVD in the player, so let's to find out. Come on. Come on, RJ.",
        "RJ: I want to play outside. Can I?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, can he?",
        "Edmund: All right. All right. Be sure to put on your jacket and your gloves and don't go far. Really, RJ, don't go far. Okay? Go on.",
        "Jonathan: Go get them.",
        "Edmund: This may take a while so I really think you should go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Jonathan? Tammy, you wouldn't...",
        "Tammy: Of course I wouldn't. Like I want to be with him at all, let alone at your wedding.",
        "Cassie: Then why would you even mention his name?",
        "Tammy: To show you how crazy it is to go after Sandy. Yeah, he made a big mistake when he first came to town, but he is a really good guy. JB is a monster and you act like they're the same.",
        "Cassie: They're not the only two choices in town.",
        "Tammy: I like Sandy. And he's sorry for what he did. Look at everything that he's done for me.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. He's keeping you away from your family. That's great.",
        "Tammy: No. I'm doing that. He just offered me a place to stay where I feel safe. He gave me time. And he was just there, which is a big deal, because I've been pretty tough to be around lately. But Sandy's... he's special.",
        "Cassie: How special? Are you two involved, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Do you mean, like, are we having sex? See, I can see how you would think so.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Tammy: In your head, since I already gave it up once...",
        "Cassie: No. Okay? I am not thinking that. Look, I just want to know what's going on with you, okay? That's all. And for some reason, you can't stand to be around me, Tammy. I'm your mother and I love you.",
        "Tammy: Sandy and I are just friends. For now.",
        "Cassie: For now?",
        "Tammy: I don't know, okay? It's hard to know. I don't know if I want to be with any guy again.",
        "Cassie: Okay, come on. Sit down. Sit down with me. You know, that's all going to change.",
        "Tammy: Will it?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah. And then the question is going to be, \"which great guy do I choose?\" Look, Tammy, I just want you to be with a guy that treats you right, with a guy who would never think of hurting you.",
        "Tammy: That's Sandy.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Maybe. Maybe...",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Cassie: Look; I just know that it's really easy to get caught up with a guy who's exciting and dangerous.",
        "Tammy: You mean we get turned on by the bad guys.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, Tammy. It happens.",
        "Tammy: And you think it's happening with me? Because Sandy's bad?",
        "Cassie: No. No, I... I ran into Jonathan. And he made it seem like the two of you are...",
        "Tammy: Are what?",
        "Cassie: Well, he... he said that you are softening towards him.",
        "Tammy: And you believed him? Okay, so because I'm not running around screaming and yelling about him anymore, suddenly I want to be with him again?",
        "Cassie: No, I don't think that, okay? But we haven't been talking a lot lately and a lot has happened with you, and I feel like I am completely on the outside.",
        "Tammy: Well, you are. But I'm fine. I will let you know if I need anything.",
        "Cassie: Will you? Tammy, you're my daughter and I will do anything to help you. Do you understand that?",
        "Tammy: You can start by not bringing up Sandy or JB. Let's change the subject to my dress. This hem needs to come up on it, still. Finally, something we can fix.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Look at you now, good-old barn. Full of joy. Happiness and joy.",
        "RJ: Why are you here?",
        "Dinah: Why are you here?",
        "RJ: I'm playing.",
        "Dinah: Not me. That's a cool truck. Can I see it? I guess... I guess what happened that night in the barn, I can't get that out of my mind, I don't think.",
        "RJ: Me too. Sometimes I dream about it.",
        "Dinah: Really? Oh, man, that was a bad night. That was a terrible night. But we got you out. That's all that counts, right. So it turned into a wonderful night. Do you remember the sound of the fire, the sound it made? It was roaring, like it was alive.",
        "RJ: I was scared.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Looking down on the flames, seeing your mother caught underneath a beam.",
        "RJ: I saw Uncle Edmund and Jeffrey, too, before that.",
        "Dinah: Wait a minute. You saw them together? RJ, you saw Edmund hit Jeffrey over the head with a shovel and drop the lantern that started the fire? Oh. Oh, that isn't what you meant.",
        "RJ: I saw Edmund carry Jeffrey out.",
        "Dinah: And that's all you saw. Come here. Oh, boy. Honey, I think Dinah just made a very big mistake. Or not.",
        "RJ: He hit Jeffrey with the shovel?",
        "Dinah: Yeah, he did. He hit him in the head, like right there. And you know what? I want you... actually, need you to forget that Uncle Edmund did any of that kind of stuff. But it is impressive that Jeffrey didn't die, and he fell from that hey loft all the way up there, to the floor right there. And Mommy didn't get hurt. She was trapped under a beam, and so everything worked out okay. So I want you to promise me. Hey. I want you to promise me that you're not going to remember any of this, okay? Pinky swear?",
        "RJ: Does Uncle Edmund hate Jeffrey?",
        "Dinah: You know something? When you are all grown up, I'm sure that your Mommy is going to tell you everything. And in her version, she will probably be the hero. But at least it will be the truth, okay? But for now, I want you to pretend that we didn't talk about this. In fact, I want you to pretend that I was never here, okay? Kind of like when we first met, when we were imaginary friends?",
        "RJ: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Now, this is a new truck. I haven't seen this before. Is this your favorite toy?",
        "RJ: It was.",
        "Dinah: Not anymore?",
        "RJ: Now it makes me think of the fire, not the firemen.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. It's going to be okay, though. It really will be. Listen. It's getting cold out. You better get back home.",
        "RJ: Okay.",
        "Dinah: Go. See ya. First the fire, now the explosion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: The seamstress said the dress would be ready first thing in the morning.",
        "Cassie: Oh, okay, great. Then we're ready for the big day, huh?",
        "Tammy: I can't wait.",
        "Cassie: I forgot to give you this. Room 416.",
        "Tammy: What is this for?",
        "Cassie: Tonight.",
        "Tammy: Are you serious?",
        "Cassie: I'm not trying to pry you away from Sandy's apartment, okay? It's just... one last night goofing around with your single Mom before she's not single anymore.",
        "Tammy: I don't think so.",
        "Cassie: Come on, come on. A girl's-only night before the wedding, watching sappy movies, ordering room service. And we'll laugh. I promise we'll laugh.",
        "Tammy: We haven't done that in a while.",
        "Cassie: The room's all ready for you. Brand-new fuzzy robe, those bath salts that you like, tons of chick flicks. (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: I do need a new robe.",
        "Cassie: Is that a yes?",
        "Tammy: Fine.",
        "Cassie: Yay! (Laughs)",
        "Tammy: It might be fun.",
        "Cassie: Might be? It's going to be great. Okay, all right. Okay. I'm going to go to the farm and get a few things that I'll need, and I'm sure you need to go get some things that you need.",
        "Tammy: Definitely.",
        "Cassie: You know what? Then we'll meet at the Beacon, okay? Just meet there.",
        "Tammy: No problem. I was going to call Sandy and ask him to come pick me up anyway.",
        "Cassie: That's fine. Can I say one more mother thing and then I'll be done, completely done?",
        "Tammy: Go ahead.",
        "Cassie: You've been through so much, you know? You have. And I don't think you're going to get over it as quick as you think you are. So I think tonight is a really big deal.",
        "Tammy: Maybe so.",
        "Cassie: I'll see you later.",
        "Seamstress: We'll be fitting one of those for you before long.",
        "Tammy: It's the wrong color.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonathan: Hello. Seek and ye shall find.",
        "Edmund: I said I wanted you gone.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, I thought that was a suggestion, not an order.",
        "Edmund: Let me make myself more clear.",
        "Jonathan: Oh!",
        "Edmund: Get out!",
        "Jeff: A few years out of the palace and the guy's manners go right to hell. Did I 86 you from Reva's when you came over for that little chat before Christmas? No. You basically forced yourself in, and I was as nice as they get, even when you were blackmailing me.",
        "Edmund: I was reasoning with you.",
        "Jonathan: Oh. Oh, okay, just like you were teaching me when you tried to off me when I was still a baby?",
        "Edmund: You burned down your parents' house, and you agreed to stay away from the wedding.",
        "Jonathan: Why would I want to watch my father's widow marry his murderous brother?",
        "Edmund: All right, fine. Here's something you may have missed. I don't want you to just stay away from my wedding. I want you to stay away from my house; I want to you stay away from my children.",
        "Jonathan: \"My wedding\"? \"My kids\"? \"My house\"? You wouldn't have any of this if my father Richard hadn't bought it in that accident. All of this would be his, even that lovely bride. Speaking of which, she can't seem to keep her hands on this ever since I gave it to her, so maybe you could hold on to it a little longer than Cassie could.",
        "Edmund: God, you think you're so clever, don't you? You think you can just say and do anything you want with impunity. You can't, and I know that better than anyone. You dedicate your life to revenge. You hurt as many people as you possibly can. And then you smile and claim victory. I see something Jonathan that no one else can see. And it's this: You don't hate me; you don't hate Cassie; you don't hate Reva half as much as you hate yourself. You hate yourself, Jonathan Randall. And as long as you do, you will always be miserable. You will always be alone. And we will always win.",

        "Buzz: This whole Ruth thing was your idea, wasn't it?",
        "Gus: I'm not the reason that your daughter is in jail, Buzz, okay? I was the one who tried to help her stay out of trouble.",
        "Buzz: Well, you did a lousy job!",
        "Gus: Yes I did! I'm sorry. I wish I could change everything that happened the last few weeks, but I can't.",
        "Buzz: You and me both.",
        "Gus: Buzz, there's a killer out there. He killed my brother. I'm going to find out who it is and I'm going to clear your daughter's name, okay?",
        "Buzz: I'm just not good at hearing news that makes me want to break people's heads. I mean, she did this for me, and I'm blaming you. It's my fault.",
        "Frank: Dad, come on don't do this.",
        "Buzz: Oh, no, come on, Frank. She rigged it. She rigged the confession, the suicide to get me off the hook. And now where is she? She's in a jail cell away from her family. Frank, tell me she didn't do it. I mean, tell me you're just following protocol and there is something down the pipeline that's going to clear her.",
        "Frank: Dad...",
        "Gus: I'll tell you, Buzz. She didn't do it. She didn't kill Phillip.",
        "Buzz: You got proof?",
        "Gus: I just need time.",
        "Frank: Look, can I have some time alone with my father, please?",
        "Alan: It's time.",
        "Gus: Time for what?",
        "Alan: Time for you to change sides.",
        "Gus: You really have to stop with this \"us verses them\" crap. My brother is dead. He ain't coming back. But Harley is innocent.",
        "Alan: So you're choosing Harley over your own brother.",
        "Gus: She's innocent. I know she's innocent.",
        "Alan: Well, I know wishful thinking when I hear it, too.",
        "Gus: I should have stopped Phillip months ago. I should have stayed by my girl's side. I should have said...",
        "Alan: It would have been a mistake.",
        "Gus: I should have walked away from Spaulding on day one and I should have stayed with my girl, and I should have said, \"Baby, I am with you. I am with you no matter what.\" That's what I should have done.",
        "Alan: Listen to yourself. \"I should have\"? Harley Cooper masqueraded all over this city as Ruth Karloff. She fooled you. She used you. She used us all. Now, has she indicated in any way that she wants you back?",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Alan: Well, then why are you willing to throw away your entire life?",
        "Gus: Because it's what I have to do.",
        "Buzz: I was pretty rough on him.",
        "Frank: I'm sure he understands, pop. You know we all understand. It's been a tough time for everyone.",
        "Buzz: I never ask you very much, but I need a favor.",
        "Frank: Sure, pop. You name it.",
        "Buzz: Pull some strings, Frank. Make some evidence disappear. Get Harley out of this.",

        "Cassie: I just came from seeing Tammy, so...",
        "Edmund: What's wrong? Is she all right?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. I don't know. She still seems so fragile. Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm just being a hyper-protective Mom seeing problems where there aren't any.",
        "Edmund: No, I don't think so, Cassie. She's been through a lot.",
        "Cassie: So you don't mind me going?",
        "Edmund: Mind it? I hate it. But I understand it. And I think there may be just enough time for one more thing.",
        "Cassie: Wow, you think there's time for that?",
        "Edmund: I think there's time for a glass and a toast. So I'm going to go to the kitchen and get us something to drink.",
        "Cassie: And I'm going to look for that master key.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: Thanks again for driving me over here. I didn't bring too much stuff, did I?",
        "Sandy: Oh, no. Three bags, no big deal. Not for these guns.",

        "Sandy: Oh, how did it go with her?",
        "Tammy: Great?",
        "Sandy: Yeah?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, totally fine. You want to go down and get something from the kitchen?",
        "Sandy: Ah, the joy of owning your own hotel: Complementary potato skins.",
        "Tammy: Mm, mm.",
        "Sandy: Mm, potassium.",

        "Gus: There's one thing I know, and that's police work, and it's gathering clues and analyzing evidence. And there's a killer out there, and he murdered my brother, and I'm going to find out who it is.",
        "Alan: You know what? You're right about one thing. You know police work. But you don't know anything about family loyalty.",
        "Gus: You know what? It makes me sick that you just said that. I hid the fact that my Aunt was a drug dealer for loyalty, for you. I lost everything that was important to me because of it--my credibility, my job, the woman I wanted to marry. That's not enough for you?",
        "Alan: You never walk away from family.",
        "Gus: You know that's the first intelligent thing you've said today? You're right. I won't walk away from my family.",
        "Buzz: Frank.",
        "Frank: Hey, pop, I want to clear Harley's name as much as you do, and I'll do anything to make that happen, but it's got to be legal.",
        "Buzz: I thought you'd say that. That's why you're a cop and I'm tired. I'm tired of being helpless and angry at the same time. I'm tired of people tiptoeing around me because they're afraid bad news will make me keel over. I'm tired of being tired. But most of all, I'm tired of Phillip reaching out from the grave to wreck my family. Leave my family alone and let Harley live her life.",

        "Sandy: So, you want me to hang out until your Mom gets here?",
        "Tammy: Oh, no, that's okay. You know, it's probably better if you're not here.",
        "Sandy: Hm. Gotcha. Well, have a good nap or something.",
        "Tammy: You know, Sandy, I don't tell you nearly enough how much I appreciate you. But I'm going to change that. I am.",
        "Sandy: Hey, the potato skins were more than enough, so...",

        "Dinah: When was the last time you saw Cassie?",

        "Dinah: And how the she seem? Did she seem all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Would you stop with the 20 questions and tell me what's going on, please?",
        "Dinah: All right, look. You cannot say anything about this. You did not hear this from me because I heard it from somebody else who got it from somebody else, so I don't even know if it's credible, but I think she has called off the wedding with Edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: She's called it off?",
        "Dinah: Like I said, just a rumor. But it's a pretty big one. See you.",

        "Edmund: Don't go anywhere. Eye of newt, and the cider is ready.",
        "Cassie: Where can I go, except crazy if I can't find the stupid key. Hey, there. How's my three-alarm guy? Missed you.",
        "RJ: Me too.",
        "Cassie: Yeah? Wow. You look upset. Are you upset because I'm going away? Oh. Okay. Well, something bothering you about tomorrow, the wedding?",
        "RJ: The fire.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yeah. Thinking about the fire... we were in the barn, we were stuck in the fire?",
