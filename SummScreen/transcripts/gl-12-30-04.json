        "Harley: Nice picture.",
        "Frank: Come on, you guys. Let's go. Move it. Chris, open up. Come on. I got two troublemakers here.",
        "Harley: Hey.",
        "Frank: You get over there and you get down there.",
        "Harley: They're coming in here?",
        "Frank: You bet they are.",
        "Harley: Frank, you're putting two perps in the same cell as me?",
        "Frank: You know, actually, you're going to have three guys in here with you. At least they're not total strangers, though.",
        "Buzz and Coop: Happy New Year, Harley.",
        "Buzz: (Chuckles)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Well, another new year's eve alone. That's okay. Things might heat up, though, as soon as RJ tells his Mommy about the terrible thing Uncle Edmund did to Jeffrey the night of the fire. Whew. Happy New Year's, Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "RJ: I don't want Edmund to be my Daddy if he does bad things.",
        "Cassie: RJ, why would you say such a thing? Come on. Take your coat off. Go on. Have a seat.",
        "RJ: I was thinking about him and Jeffrey.",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey O'Neill?",
        "Cassie: Were you out in the barn? I guess seeing the wedding decorations that has you upset?",
        "RJ: No.",
        "Edmund: RJ, we were all very lucky that night. No one was hurt, at least not that badly.",
        "Cassie: I know the night of the fire was really scary, but when Edmund and I get married tomorrow, we're going to have a bunch new barn memories. Happy ones. Okay? (Knock on door)",
        "Reva: There they are! Come on, you're coming with me.",
        "Josh: And Edmund, we are coming with me. Come on.",
        "Cassie: Are we being kidnapped?",
        "Reva: Well, you can kind of call it that. It's your last night before your wedding and it's time to separate. So come on, let's go.",
        "Josh: Grab your coats.",
        "Reva: Mrs. Chitwood has agreed to watch RJ and will, so come. You've got to come. Come, come, come.",
        "Cassie: Okay, wait, wait.",
        "Reva: The cars are still running.",
        "Cassie: Hey. Do you mind if Edmund and I go out for a little while?",
        "RJ: No.",
        "Cassie: Hey. Is there anything else you want to tell me?",
        "RJ: No.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, listen to Mrs. Chitwood and she'll let you stay up late and watch the ball drop, okay? Tomorrow's a big day, sweetie. I love you. Okay.",
        "Reva: See you, RJ. Thanks, Mrs. Chitwood.",
        "Josh: Let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Thank you very much.",
        "Mrs. Chitwood: Have fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "RJ: Hi, I'm Jeffrey. I'll go and fix the lights. Here comes Uncle Edmund with his shovel. Bam, bam. Fire! Fire!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: How did you get in here?",
        "Jonathan: Same way you did: Through the door.",
        "Tammy: Then use it again. Get out.",
        "Jonathan: Would you chill out? I wasn't planning on bumping into you. I heard the maid saying about how you and your Mom were going to be here tonight so I thought I'd stop by and write you guys a note wishing you a good time.",
        "Tammy: So where's the note?",
        "Jonathan: I didn't get a chance to write it before you came in. Look, your Mom is getting married. She's going to start a new life, right? Well, that's what I want, too. To change things, to clean up my act.",
        "Tammy: You have a long way to go.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, Tammy, I know I didn't treat you too hot when I first came to town. Involving you in my issues with Reva was probably wrong.",
        "Tammy: Probably?",
        "Jonathan: All right, the point is, what's done is done. I can only fix things moving forward. Now, if you really want me to split, I will, but I feel like it's hard for you to keep on hating me. You're not the kind of person that would hold a grudge.",
        "Tammy: You think you know me?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I do know you. I know you better than anyone, if you know what I mean. (Knock on door)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mrs. Chitwood: Hello, Mr. O'Neill. Come on in.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, Mrs. Chitwood. Thank you. Hey, champ. Happy New Year.",
        "Mrs. Chitwood: Well, thank you. Same to you.",
        "Jeffrey: Is Mrs. Winslow around?",
        "Mrs. Chitwood: Oh, no. You just missed her. She and Edmund were kidnapped by Mr. And Mrs. Lewis for some pre-wedding celebration.",
        "Jeffrey: Celebration. So everything is moving forward as planned? As far as the wedding is concerned, I mean.",
        "Mrs. Chitwood: Well, sure. Why wouldn't it be? (Washing machine Buzzes) That darn washing machine. Excuse me.",
        "Jeffrey: Sure, sure. Hey, buddy. I came by to see if your Mom was all right. I guess she is. What are you staring at?",
        "RJ: Did it hurt?",
        "Jeffrey: Did it hurt? Did what hurt?",
        "RJ: The night of the fire. When Uncle Edmund hit you with the shovel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harris: Lewis.",
        "Billy: What are you doing here?",
        "Harris: I ran out of money.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, you're not going to get any more from me.",
        "Harris: Well, then I guess the cops will be getting a call that you hired someone to rough up Phillip Spaulding and, uh oh, Spaulding ended up dead.",
        "Billy: Let's just go inside here and let's talk about this, okay? Right over here. Let's go right over here. Oh, good, good. I'm going to borrow this for a second. Now, look. My friend's daughter is sitting in jail. See this? And she is charged with, funny, everything that you've been blackmailing me for. Now, you told me things got out of hand between you and Phillip, right? Well, the evidence says that she's done it. Now, either Phillip got killed twice or you've been handing me a line of bull. Now, which is it?",
        "Harris: I never made it here that night.",
        "Billy: You what?",
        "Harris: A couple of hours after you and I made our deal, I bumped into a bookie I know. He had a tip on a hoops game in Chicago, so I blew off your job and went up there. The next morning, I saw the paper and...",
        "Billy: Yeah, you saw an opportunity to blackmail. Man, you are a real weasel. I almost wish it had been you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harley: You guys, you can't be in here. It's against the rules.",
        "Frank: Sis, what are you talking about? I'm bringing him in on a serious offense. I.D.K.",
        "Harley: I.D.K.?",
        "Frank: Yes. An illegal discharge of kazoos. Listen, one, two, three. (Playing \"auld lang syne\" on kazoos)",
        "Harley: Okay. Okay! You are nuts! Enough. (Laughter)",
        "Coop: Yes, and we're all together.",
        "Harley: Where's Gus? There weren't enough kazoos to go around?",
        "Buzz: He's trying to get you out of here. You should be grateful.",
        "Harley: Well, I'd be grateful if none of you were here. I mean seriously, Frank, you are days off of suspension. What if you get into trouble for doing this? Who's going to look after my kids? Please, take off before you make a bad situation even worse.",
        "Buzz: (Gasps)",
        "Harley: Daddy?",
        "Frank: You okay, pop?",
        "Harley: Daddy, okay? Is it your heart? Is it your heart?",
        "Frank: Sit him down. Sit him down.",
        "Harley: Okay, sit down.",
        "Frank: You okay?",
        "Harley: Just breathe, okay? You all right? You all right?",
        "Buzz: (Breathing hard) You're breaking my heart.",
        "Harley: That is not funny.",
        "Buzz: You take after me, you know? You take after me. You make your problems worse by trying to prove you don't need any help.",
        "Harley: Whatever. Go home. All of you.",
        "Buzz: It's different now. I've been sick, I need help. I need help, especially from the family. And more than that, I need to help you some. So, why don't we make it a two-for-one deal, sort of a New Year's resolution?",
        "Harley: Daddy, I don't need help.",
        "Buzz: So that's it? You're sending me home?",
        "Harley: So that's it? You're going to pull the \"I'm sick\" card?",
        "Buzz: I just did. I was hoping it would work. (Plays note on kazoo)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You know what it's like to sleep with me, but that's not the same as knowing me.",
        "Jonathan: Maybe. Or maybe that's how you wish it was.",
        "Tammy: What I wish is that I had never met you. Why would you even bother to get to know me? It's not like I mattered to you. I was just a way to get at Aunt Reva. That's all you cared about.",
        "Jonathan: Back then, yes. I said I was sorry and I can do it again if it will make you feel any better.",
        "Tammy: If I didn't believe it then, why would I believe it now?",
        "Jonathan: I was messed up. That's no big secret. You know, blame it on my rough upbringing, but I guess you wouldn't be able to relate to that.",
        "Tammy: (Scoffs) Right. Because my days in foster care were a barrel of laughs. Yeah, didn't know about that, did you?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe that's why we connected.",
        "Tammy: We did not connect. I could never have, not if you were honest, not if I knew the real you.",
        "Jonathan: I don't know about that. Everything we did, who you are, that's all you. And I think you know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: I'm only going to take a minute to drop off the bag, but let me find my keys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: So, RJ, you play with these guys all the time, right, and make up stories like what happened in the barn the night of the fire.",
        "RJ: I didn't make that up. I'm sorry Uncle Edmund hit you.",
        "Jeffrey: With a shovel?",
        "RJ: And started the fire.",
        "Jeffrey: And how do you know all this, RJ? It's okay. It's okay. You can tell me.",
        "RJ: I was there.",
        "Jeffrey: You were there. You were in the barn. You saw Edmund. How come you never mentioned it before?",
        "RJ: I didn't remember it at first, and then I did.",
        "Jeffrey: And you haven't told anyone else about this, have you? Not your Mom?",
        "RJ: Aunt Reva and Uncle Josh came, so I couldn't.",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Well, you know what? Hey, I think it's a good thing if you don't tell your Mom because you don't want to ruin her big day tomorrow, right?",
        "RJ: You're not mad at Uncle Edmund?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what, RJ? There's a lot of messed-up stuff happens in life and you can't hang on to it all. You know what? I want you to let it go, too, okay? RJ? RJ, I don't want you to think about this, okay? Just think about other things, like the fun you're going to have tomorrow. All right?",
        "RJ: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Here. Say goodbye to Mrs. Chitwood for me, all right? I've got to go. Yeah, it's me. We need to see each other. No, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Playing the kazoo)",
        "Coop: Look, you're going to beat this, sis, okay?",
        "Frank: Yes, you are. It's just a matter of when.",
        "Harley: Yeah. 30 years, life. (Bitter laugh)",
        "Frank: Come on, sis.",
        "Harley: Hey, Frank, have you seen Zach and Jude today?",
        "Frank: Yeah. Yeah, I have.",
        "Harley: How are they doing.",
        "Frank: They're doing great. They miss their Mommy but I think that goes without saying. Look, sis, you've raised two really strong kids.",
        "Buzz: They get it from you, don't they? The minute I get back, I'm going to talk to those little guys and tell them they can count the days until you get home.",
        "Harley: No, don't... don't do that, Dad.",
        "Coop: Whoa. There's nothing wrong with a little bit of hope here.",
        "Harley: No, there is if it's false hope. Please stay away from those boys. I have done enough to those kids already. I don't want to add a promise I can't keep to the list.",
        "Coop: Harley, you didn't do anything to them.",
        "Harley: Really? Going after Phillip dressed as Ruth? Making the war against the Cooper's and the Spaulding's more important than taking care of my kids?",
        "Coop: Harley, Phillip pounded this family flat and he was kicking us where we lie, okay? We all wanted to do something about it. We needed to do something.",
        "Harley: Yeah, but how far would you have gone to do just that, huh? See, that's what separates you and me--what I did do and what you might have done-- and that's why I'm here. That's why I'm in prison and that's why I deserve to be in prison.",
        "Buzz: Stop talking like that, you hear me? Stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: Hey, you're hurting me.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, does that hurt? Does that hurt? You ought to try getting hit in the head with a shovel sometime, Dinah. Now, I want you to take a look around. I said take a look around and go back to the last time you were in here and what you did and what you saw.",
        "Dinah: Why are you doing this?",
        "Jeffrey: How did that fire start, Dinah? Tell me.",
        "Dinah: Why don't you tell me your theory? You seem to have one.",
        "Jeffrey: Or better yet, we'll get RJ down here and have him tell us.",
        "Dinah: RJ.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, RJ. He's got a unique take on this himself. I just found out about it.",
        "Dinah: Well, he's a child. Why would you listen to him?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I wouldn't listen to him. That's why I called you.",
        "Dinah: Me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Dinah: Me? Nobody believes or trusts me. Why are you asking me?",
        "Jeffrey: Call it a hunch. Now, I'm going to ask you nicely the first time. Did you or did you not see Edmund come in here and did you see him come up there and hit me with this shovel and start that fire?",
        "Dinah: Why would Edmund do something like that?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, why would he do it? Let's see. Maybe because he hates my guts? Maybe because he just saw me come back from Washington, DC, with his girlfriend. Maybe because he's insanely jealous and maybe that situation was made worse by you constantly whispering into his ear about me and Cassie.",
        "Dinah: You know I don't have to listen to this.",
        "Jeffrey: Did Edmund hit me with that shovel and start that fire or is this just a figment of RJ's imagination?",
        "Dinah: Let me go.",
        "Jeffrey: Tell me, Dinah! Did he?",
        "Dinah: Yes. He did. But you cannot tell anybody. No one. Because I was the only other person in this barn when it happened besides RJ. Edmund will know that it came from me, and if he loses Cassie because the truth is out, I will be the one he blames.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: Now, you're probably thinking that I was roped into this, right?",
        "Edmund: Well, we're hardly pals.",
        "Josh: Well, I'll be honest with you. This was Reva's idea, but it was a good one, because I owe you.",
        "Edmund: For what?",
        "Josh: When Reva had to have her surgery, I was out of town. I couldn't be there for her. But you were there, and she told me that you made things better for her, and that means a lot to me.",
        "Edmund: Josh, I think I'm the one who owed all of you.",
        "Josh: Well, that's probably true. But Cassie loves you and that's worth a lot, so let me buy you a drink. Come on.",
        "Edmund: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: Yeah, I think that just about takes care of us for tonight, okay? And forever. Hey, guys! The bridegroom, the chief reveler, I have been waiting for this.",
        "Edmund: At least I see you were keeping yourself busy while waiting.",
        "Josh: Do we have a table?",
        "Billy: Yeah, right there.",
        "Josh: Edmund, why don't you have a seat? I want to talk to my brother here for just a minute, okay?",
        "Edmund: Yes, of course.",
        "Josh: Thank you. I appreciate that. Come here. That was him, wasn't it?",
        "Billy: Who?",
        "Josh: That guy you just kicked out of here. That's the one that phoned you. What's going on, Billy?",
        "Billy: Hey, look, nothing's going on.",
        "Josh: Oh, really? You don't mind if I chase this guy down, then, and ask him myself?",
        "Billy: Hold on. Whoa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: I know what this is about.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, did you get a flash? Enlighten me.",
        "Tammy: You came to town ready to rip it to shreds--or at least Aunt Reva's part of it--and you started to, only now you're not so sure that's what you want anymore.",
        "Jonathan: You sure about that?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. See, if that's all you cared about, you'd be gone. But you don't want to leave. You don't want to be alone anymore, do you?",
        "Jonathan: You guys are like a family of amateur shrinks. Maybe it's because you all need so much therapy.",
        "Tammy: Look who's talking. But since you decided to stay, you realized you needed to make things right again. Starting with me.",
        "Jonathan: It's a good theory. I don't know, though. It's... your flash seems a little dim. It's assuming a lot, like I'm just a lost little puppy who's looking for a home. Like there's not a much simpler reason that I came.",
        "Tammy: Then why are you here?",
        "Jonathan: Maybe I just wanted to see you. Be alone with you. Maybe I couldn't get you out of my head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Let me see what... ah. (Laughter) you know, why don't I take your bag in there and I can just meet you at Farley's?",
        "Reva: Are you sure? Oh, you want time alone with Tammy, right?",
        "Cassie: If you don't mind. I mean the moments are so rare now.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Cassie: You sure?",
        "Reva: Yes. Take it. Don't be long.",
        "Cassie: I won't.",
        "Reva: I'll meet you there.",
        "Cassie: Okay.",
        "Jonathan: You can't deny our connection, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: Don't you talk to me about \"our connection.\"",
        "Jonathan: You're right. Let's not talk.",
        "Cassie: Get away from her. Get away from her!",
        "Jonathan: Hey, hey! Don't beat me up, Aunt Cass. I won't be able to hang out with the gang down at J. Farley's if they hear I got beat up by a chick.",
        "Cassie: You stay the hell away from my daughter or you will be sorry.",
        "Jonathan: Thank you for the chat. I'll see you around, Tam-Tam.",
        "Cassie: No, you won't. Are you okay?",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Did he threaten you? Did he hurt you?",
        "Tammy: No, I'm fine. It just... it got weird, that's all. We were talking and then...",
        "Cassie: And then he was kissing you. Thank God I came in here when I did. What else would have happened, Tammy?",
        "Tammy: Nothing else would have happened.",
        "Cassie: I'm going to call Frank. I'm going to call Frank. I'm going to have him arrested.",
        "Tammy: Mom.",
        "Cassie: No, you know what? I am going to call Danny and I'm going to get in touch with some of his old mob friends, because they will surely know what to do with him.",
        "Tammy: Mom, will you stop it?",
        "Cassie: Tammy, he is on a mission to ruin Reva's life and you are not going to be a part of his psycho game again. Do you hear me? I'm not going to let that happen.",
        "Tammy: Mom, listen to me. You don't have to flip out like this. I can handle myself. I can take care of JB.",
        "Cassie: No, you can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: You hired a hit man?",
        "Billy: Look, the guy was not supposed to murder Phillip.",
        "Josh: But you thought he did and that's why this guy was able to shake you down, right?",
        "Billy: Yes. Things got a little messy.",
        "Josh: What were you thinking, Billy?",
        "Billy: Look, I was thinking about my boy. Phillip found out that I tried to get Olivia deported and he was blackmailing me. He was going to tell Bill and that would have been the end of our relationship. I wasn't going to have this.",
        "Josh: So, when Phillip ended up dead, you just had to sit on this until the police put the pieces together.",
        "Billy: Basically, yeah. Hey, I wasn't going to turn myself in. I think Phillip got what he deserved, but I'll tell you, when they brought Buzz in, I wasn't going to let Buzz go down for something that I was responsible for. I mean I learned my lesson with Maryanne last year. But before I could tell Frank, that Ruth Karloff tape came in, you know, it was a confession. What am I going to do?",
        "Josh: And now Harley is the one in the hot seat.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Well, you know, I feel bad about that, but it made it pretty clear that my guy didn't do it.",
        "Josh: It's a hell of a way to get off the hook.",
        "Edmund: Gentlemen, so far this party is a party of one. Any change in sight?",
        "Josh: Sorry about that, Edmund. I see you started without us, though.",
        "Edmund: Well, \"eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow...\" so forth and so on.",
        "Billy: Wait, wait, wait. You're not getting cold feet about this, are you?",
        "Edmund: No, no. The only thing I'm skittish about is something a bit more immediate. Billy, it takes a lot of nerve to ask this of your brother, but nerve I've got in spades, so Josh, will you be my best man?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buzz: I know things look bleak, but they are going to be okay.",
        "Harley: And you know this for a fact, huh?",
        "Buzz: No, I know what I believe, and I believe that people get what they deserve in this world, and I have known a lot of people in my life, but you are just about one of the best of the bunch.",
        "Harley: (Sighs) Daddy. I don't think so. (Laughs) You know, I have never had trouble taking responsibility for my actions. I used to give Gus such grief for playing fast and loose with the rules. How could he just go after what he wanted and never think twice about how. Well, I'm starting to find that out.",
        "Buzz: Listen to me. You are a good, decent, honorable person.",
        "Harley: Yes. A good, decent, honorable person who got pushed too far and lost her way.",
        "Coop: It's New Year's eve. I thought we were here to party. Am I right?",
        "Harley: Cue \"Jailhouse Rock.\"",
        "Coop: Ah. I actually have something a little bit better than \"Jailhouse Rock.\" What do I have here? Ta-da!",
        "Frank: What are you doing? You can't bring that in here.",
        "Coop: Oh, lighten up. Come on. Here. If you could hold that for me.",
        "Buzz: Your call, Chief.",
        "Frank: Well, you know, I'm probably going to get fired for bringing you here in the first place, so...",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Coop: All right. Whoo!",
        "Frank: Nothing's going to make it any worse.",
        "Coop: Here we are. There's one. For Harley.",
        "Buzz: That's enough for Coop. (Laughter)",
        "Coop: All right, here we go.",
        "Buzz: Okay, here we go.",
        "Coop: This is to 2005. Out with the old--the garbage of the year that it was, which is going to be ending here at midnight--and hopefully it will be better for all of us.",
        "Buzz: Here, here.",
        "Frank: Um, I'll actually take that one step further. I agree with everything that you said but I'd like to toast to the Cooper's. To this family. We've been through one hell of a year. We have dodged, we have ducked and we've always managed to come out on top. May our streak continue.",
        "Buzz: Wait. I don't think we just got it done there, you know? There's one person, only one person we should toast tonight, and that's Harley.",
        "Harley: Daddy.",
        "Buzz: Quiet. I'm extemporizing. To my daughter, who not only is the heart and soul of our family but she's shown us what we were and what we will be. You've shown us what it means to care, you've shown us what it means to love, and you've shown us what it means to fight because we care and love. I'd say I look up to you, but it's a little more than that. You are the yardstick by which I measure myself every morning. I love you. To Harley.",
        "Coop: To Harley.",
        "Frank: To Harley.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Edmund: I know my request probably strikes you as bizarre, given my history with you and especially with Reva, and I understand if you turn me down. I just thought I'd ask...",
        "Josh: No, actually, I'm not going to turn you down. I'll do it. Bring on the rings.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. Thank you, Josh. You know, I may have been a God-awful brother but I'm determined to be the best brother-in-law I can be.",
        "Billy: And as witness, I will keep you to your promise.",
        "Edmund: Thank you.",
        "Billy: Good.",
        "Edmund: Thank you. And if Josh starts kicking himself over this decision, remind him later that he brought it on himself.",
        "Josh: I did.",
        "Edmund: Yes, you did. You reminded me that people change.",
        "Josh: That's true. People do change, and the toughest part about that is taking the first step. But my money always goes on the guy who is willing to take on that challenge. In fact, that sounds like something we should drink to, don't you think?",
        "Edmund: Good. To courage and first steps.",
        "Josh: And to be willing to own up to your mistakes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: Pretending there's not a problem doesn't mean there isn't one, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: I'm fine. It's fine. Look, I'm just brushing my hair, getting ready to go to your party.",
        "Cassie: Jonathan was kissing you.",
        "Tammy: And I would have kicked him out on his head all by myself.",
        "Cassie: Well, you didn't. And from here, it looked like the next place Jonathan was going was down your pants.",
        "Tammy: Mom, that is disgusting!",
        "Cassie: Yes, Tammy, it is disgusting.",
        "Tammy: You think I'm really that clueless? That I would let J mess with me again? You think I wanted him to kiss me?",
        "Cassie: No. Okay, look, I'm not saying that. I am just really worried about you and I don't want to see you get hurt again.",
        "Tammy: You think I do? Look, Mom, I can't stand here and say that JB doesn't push my buttons, okay? He does.",
        "Cassie: Great.",
        "Tammy: And obviously he gets some kind of a thrill out of it, but that doesn't mean that I can't take care of myself. I'm not stupid. What are you doing?",
        "Cassie: I'm calling the police.",
        "Tammy: No. Will you listen to yourself? When you start in on JB, it is like there's nothing else in the world for you. All there is, is this guy and how much you hate him. But Mom, you can't let JB get to you so much. That's what he wants.",
        "Cassie: Okay. I will calm down when it comes to Jonathan, but you better promise me that you are going to be very, very careful.",
        "Tammy: I will. We really should go.",
        "Cassie: Look, I want you to know that the only reason I am worried about you is because I love you very much, Tammy.",
        "Tammy: You know I really feel like I'm starting to understand JB. I mean I was taken away from my Mom when I was little. It was awful. But I got the happy ending. He didn't. So I'm not worried about how to deal with JB.",
        "Cassie: If you drop your guard even for a second, he will be all over you in every way, and I am telling you right now, I won't allow it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dinah: What are you going to do?",
        "Jeffrey: He came up the stairs and he crept up on me and hit me over the head with a shovel while I was working on the generator. It must have been then because I can't remember anything after then.",
        "Dinah: Well, it's probably best you don't remember more.",
        "Jeffrey: Of course, Cassie knows nothing about this. Otherwise she wouldn't be marrying that guy tomorrow. A shovel, Dinah. He hit me with a shovel.",
        "Dinah: I know. It's terrible.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. If it's true.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Why should I believe you?",
        "Dinah: You're the one who came to me, remember?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, if it's true, Dinah, Edmund has been running around pretending that he's this big hero, pretending that he did nothing, lying to Cassie, pretending that he didn't start this fire, that he saved me, that he saved her. It's the perfect fit. The new Edmund. Yeah, the big heroic act.",
        "Dinah: You know, if it were true, wouldn't it be better for you?",
        "Jeffrey: What are you talking about?",
        "Dinah: It's going to impact your relationship, the relationship you've been itching to have with Cassie all these years.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, come on, Dinah. This isn't about me and Cassie, okay?",
        "Dinah: You know what? If you decide that you don't want to believe what I've told you about Edmund, that is your business, but you know, let's face it, you believe that Edmund is not right for Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it doesn't matter what I believe, okay? Because she believes that she loves the guy and he nearly cost RJ his life with this fire.",
        "Dinah: Yeah. And Cassie almost lost hers. And here she is committing her life to the man who caused that fire. It's pretty ironic, don't you think? Good luck, Cassie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coop: You know what? We still have a little bit left. How about another toast?",
        "Frank: Uh, no. You know what? Let's not push our luck, okay?",
        "Coop: Right. Right.",
        "Frank: Okay?",
        "Coop: There. Hold that. Thanks. Hang tough, Harley. Okay? Everything is going to be okay, you're going to get out of here.",
        "Harley: I think that's the champagne talking.",
        "Coop: No.",
        "Harley: But thank you for coming.",
        "Coop: All right.",
        "Harley: Trying to get me drunk.",
        "Coop: Oh, you are not drunk. You are not drunk. Although I wish you were. It would make this a lot easier. Take care.",
        "Frank: I'm going to check on you later, okay?",
        "Harley: I certainly hope so, Chief.",
        "Frank: I hate this, sis.",
        "Harley: Wow. Same here.",
        "Frank: Hey, Chris, can you open up?",
        "Harley: Just go. (Laughs) Please. Hey, you guys? Happy New Year.",
        "Buzz: Happy New Year.",
        "Frank: Happy New Year.",
        "Coop: Happy New Year, Harley.",

        "Reva: Hey. Oh, you're here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Hey, hi.",
        "Cassie: So, is everyone else here?",
        "Reva: No, no. Actually, you're the first but you're the only one that counts because it's your last night of freedom. We are going to celebrate. Hey, are you okay?",
        "Tammy: Great. Oh, did you get the table?",
        "Reva: I did. I practically had to throw myself across the only table there is in this place, but we got it. It's right over there. Unfortunately, Harley's not going to be able to be here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know.",
        "Reva: But it doesn't matter. We'll have a good time anyway, right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, we will.",
        "Reva: Let's get this party rolling.",
        "Cassie: Okay, you know what? I want to call Edmund and I can't get reception here so I'm going to step outside and I'll be right back.",
        "Reva: Okay. Hurry up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tammy: You think I'm really that clueless that I would let JB mess with me again?",
        "Jonathan: I'll see you around, Tam-Tam.",
        "Tammy: I can't stand here and say that JB doesn't push my buttons.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, talk about timing.",
        "Tammy: He does.",
        "Cassie: Get away from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Billy: And so the husband says, \"well, if you think the closet's bad, you should try under the bed.\" (Laughs)",
        "Edmund: (Forced laughter)",
        "Josh: That was actually one of his classier jokes.",
        "Edmund: Yes, well.",
        "Billy: Hey, I've got a million of them.",
        "Edmund: Good. Good. Because the evening is young, but I have to duck outside for a minute, excuse me.",
        "Josh: You feeling those drinks a little bit?",
        "Edmund: Um, not as much as I think I need to hear more of those jokes, but I have to call Cassie, so excuse me. (Laughs)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeffrey: Having trouble?",
        "Edmund: No, none so far. And I really don't want any from you, thank you very much.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know what, Edmund? We don't always get what we want.",
        "Edmund: Mr. O'Neill, I don't know why you're here and I really don't care. Tomorrow this time, I am going to be a married man, so say whatever you like, you can't ruin my evening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Next, on \"Guiding Light.\"",
        "Jonathan: Why would I want an inexperienced girl like Tammy when I could have a real woman like you? Come on, babe. What do you say? Last night before your wedding you can taste something you've never got to taste before.",
        "Jeffrey: He hit me on the head with that shovel and started that fire, left me there to die.",
        "Dinah: Are you going to keep this to yourself or are you going to tell Cassie the truth?"
