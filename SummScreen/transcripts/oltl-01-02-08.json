        "Viki: Yep. Whatever.",
        "Moe: Where's the sunny-side-up Viki that we're all used to around here?",
        "Viki: Huh. She left on a road trip with Charlie and I'm what's left.",

        "Michael: Sally Ann, it's Michael McBain again. Either she's not there or she's not answering.",
        "John: You sure you got the right room?",
        "Michael: You don't forget a room the police dragged you out of. God, I still can't believe she lied to me right to my face about seeing Marcie.",
        "John: The question is, who's she protecting, Marcie or herself?",
        "Michael: And if she had the ring then, or if she'd already given it to this Gigi to pawn.",
        "John: Do me a favor -- keep a lookout, will you?",
        "Michael: What are you doing?",
        "John: You want answers or not?",
        "Michael: I don't want to end up in jail again.",
        "John: Mike, it's only a B&E if you get caught.",
        "John: You coming?",
        "Michael: Oh, no.",

        "Marcie: Hello?",
        "Gigi: Marcie, it's Gigi. Are you still in town?",
        "Marcie: I'm actually running one last-minute errand, and then I got to get on the road. Why?",
        "Gigi: I'm glad I caught you. I need to see you.",
        "Marcie: Oh, I wish I could. But, look, I got to get to the border by the end of the day. I don't want anymore close calls.",
        "Gigi: This is really important, or I wouldn't even think about asking.",
        "Marcie: Well, what is it?",
        "Gigi: I can't get into it over the phone, but I have something for you and you're not going to want to leave without it.",

        "Dorian: You didn't --",
        "Addie: You don't like them?",
        "Dorian: Blair, how could you be so irresponsible? What did you do, go to some sleazy tattoo parlor with her?",
        "Blair: Oh, would you chill out? They're fake. Look at all of these. Langston was throwing them out and we went through them and we got us some matching tattoos!",
        "Addie: Ooh! You should try one, Dori.",
        "Blair: Yeah, which one would be good for her?",
        "Dorian: No, I wouldn't wear a tattoo, faux or otherwise.",
        "Addie: What happened to you? You used to be fun.",
        "Blair: Yeah. What happened to you? You used to be fun.",
        "Dorian: Today is not a day for fun.",

        "Dorian: Take a look.",

        "R.J.: Commissioner.",
        "Bo: Hey, R.J.",
        "R.J.: Happy New Year.",
        "Bo: Well, you, too. Heck of a way to kick it off, isn't it?",
        "R.J.: Yeah. So, what are Lindsay's chances today? Straight up.",
        "Bo: Well, the judge will decide if she's fit to stand trial, or not. If not, then she'll be sent back to St. Ann's.",
        "R.J.: I'll take it. St. Ann's beats Statesville any day.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, I'll take a healthy Lindsay over what she is right now.",
        "R.J.: Yeah. So it's basically a lose-lose situation?",
        "Bo: Well -- that's one way to look at it.",
        "R.J.: Well, maybe there's something both of us can do to even up the odds a little bit.",
        "Bo: You care to elaborate on that?",
        "R.J.: Well, we both know Lindsay, and we know there's no way she'd kill Spencer if she was in her right mind, and I don't think either of us wants to see her punished for it, so maybe we're in a position to do something to be of assistance to her.",
        "Bo: Sounds to me like you're suggesting that we put our differences aside and then we can present a united front in support of Lindsay.",
        "R.J.: And if I am?",
        "Bo: Then I'm right there with you.",
        "[R.J. chuckles]",

        "Michael: I can't believe it.",
        "John: Well, no one's staying here unless they travel really light.",
        "Michael: She doesn't -- she told me she's traveling with a kid. She's gone.",
        "John: Nothing in here, either.",
        "Michael: Ah. Too late.",
        "John: We don't know that, mike. You know? The maid hasn't been in here yet. Maybe she just checked out.",
        "Michael: No, she could've left last night, and if that's the case, then we'll never find her.",
        "John: Towels are still damp. Whoever was here took off not too long ago.",
        "Michael: We don't even know it was Sally Ann. She could've checked out right after I got hauled out of here.",
        "[John turns TV on, cartoon plays]",
        "John: Whoever was here before -- they either had a kid or they like cartoons. All right, look, I'll tell you what -- you go down to the desk, you see what you can find out about this Sally Ann, all right? I'll take another look around here. Maybe she left something behind that will tell us where she's headed.",

        "Marcie: Gigi, are you okay?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.",
        "Marcie: Did that cold of yours get worse?",
        "Gigi: No, I'm just feeling a little -- choked up about you leaving.",
        "Marcie: I know, me, too. And I wish I could stay, but I've been here long enough as it is.",
        "Gigi: I know. It does seem like you've been here too long, but, see, um, I came into some money last night.",
        "Marcie: How?",
        "Gigi: Those lottery tickets I'm always playing -- one of them finally paid off and I want you to have the money.",
        "Marcie: All I've done since I've gotten here is to take from you. You need that money for Shane's doctor bills.",
        "Gigi: We'll be okay. Just do this, will you?",
        "Marcie: No. I'm sorry, okay? Look, I got to cut this short because I've got to get to the border by the end of the day, but I want you to know that you're one of the best friends I've ever had and I'll never forget you.",
        "Gigi: Marcie, listen to me.",
        "Marcie: I will call you when I can, when I get someplace safe. Thanks for everything. Bye.",
        "Gigi: Marcie? Marcie -- Marcie, are you still there? She hung up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: Charlie left you high and dry?",
        "Viki: No. No, he didn't. He had something, you know, important to take care of and he had to do it on his own.",
        "Moe: More important than you?",
        "Viki: Huh. Never seen you be so protective.",
        "Moe: I ain't no busybody. You won't see me sticking my nose in my workers' business.",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah? And entering the bake-off against Noelle? That didn't count, huh?",
        "Moe: I made that up to her.",
        "Viki: Yeah, you did and that was good.",
        "Moe: So, what gives with Charlie? What'd he do?",
        "Viki: Look, Moe, he -- he has a lot to make up to his son, you know, and he can't do that here in Texas because his son isn't in Texas, so he left, and I backed him 100%.",
        "Moe: And how big a percentage wished he'd asked you to go with him?",
        "Viki: He did. I was the one that said no.",
        "Moe: Really? Well, then you're a bigger jackass than Charlie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: We need to have a talk.",
        "Jared: No, we had our talk. I told you to stay the hell out of my life.",
        "Charlie: You mind if I sit down?",
        "Jared: Yeah, I mind. I want you gone.",
        "Charlie: Well, you can't always get what you want.",
        "Jared: Yeah? I never did from you before.",
        "Charlie: And that's exactly why I'm here.",
        "Jared: I'm going to tell you the same thing I told you last time -- too late. Or were you too drunk to remember, Dad?",
        "Charlie: I'm not wasted now, I've got nothing but time, and I'm not going anywhere, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Did -- did you just call me a --",
        "Moe: A jackass -- yeah. That's what you are for letting Charlie go -- a jackass.",
        "Viki: Huh -- you know what? You just don't understand.",
        "Moe: No, the guy leaves town, maybe never coming back, asks you to go along for the ride, and you sit it out?",
        "Viki: Moe, you know, to run away with Charlie right now, that would've been, like, just too impulsive. It would've been wrong, you know?",
        "Moe: I'm sure you've got all the excuses in the universe except the real one.",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah -- and, like, what is that?",
        "[Moe clucks]",
        "Viki: No. No, I'm not chicken, okay? And what about you?",
        "Moe: Oh, I'm not saying I'm not. Look where it's got me -- alone, in the kitchen. But, you, Viki -- you've got a shot at something if you got the guts to go for it.",
        "Viki: How about a little less talky and a little more worky? I'm going to go dinner prep.",
        "Moe: Start by getting the meat out of the walk-in.",
        "Viki: Yes, Sir, boss.",
        "Marcie: Yes, it's me. You talking to Noelle yet, huh?",
        "Moe: She hasn't come back from Dallas yet. That your son?",
        "Marcie: His name is Billy. Here. It's the money I owe you from the broken dishes.",
        "Moe: Are you going somewhere?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I'm leaving town.",
        "Moe: Could you put it off for a couple of hours? Gigi's AWOL -- again.",
        "Marcie: AWOL? No, I just spoke to her a couple of minutes ago. She didn't say anything about working today.",
        "Moe: You know, maybe I should fire her for good this time. First, she skips last night, now this morning.",
        "Marcie: Wait a minute, wait a minute. She didn't show up to work last night, either?",
        "Moe: Something with Shane -- again. I'm telling you, Sally Ann, kids are nothing but trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I did what you said. Now give me back my son.",
        "Todd: No, the deal was that you get your son back when Marcie gets here. She's not here.",
        "Gigi: There was nothing else I could do!",
        "Ramsey: I don't know -- I think you could've tried a little harder.",
        "Gigi: My son has an asthma problem. He needs this. If he doesn't get this, he won't be able to breathe and -- my God! Please don't do this to him! Just bring him back!",
        "Ramsey: Well, see, now there's the kind of oomph I'm talking about. If you had that kind of oomph in that phone call, he'd be halfway home by now.",
        "Gigi: You're evil!",
        "Ramsey: No, shoot, I've been called worse -- a lot worse.",
        "Todd: Gigi? Sit down. I know how you feel. I know what it's like to be kept from your -- your flesh and blood. You haven't seen your son in, what, a day? Huh. Imagine not seeing him for two years.",
        "Gigi: You saw him all the time -- with Marcie and her husband.",
        "Todd: Yes, but I didn't know he was mine, did I? I just want my little boy back, same as you. You know, I think we can help each other. Why don't you call Marcie back?",
        "Gigi: She might not answer.",
        "Todd: Hmm. It's worth a shot, though, don't you think? You get Marcie back here; we'll give you back your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: How does Todd do it? He's off goodness knows where chasing after his baby boy, and yet, he still has time to publish this slanderous rag.",
        "Blair: Well, what can I say, Dorian? Todd is a get-her-done kind of guy.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Blair: How much trouble does it say she's in, huh?",
        "Dorian: If Lindsay is deemed sane enough to stand trial, Nora is going to pull out every dirty trick in the book. She's going to make sure that Lindsay goes to Statesville or worse.",
        "Blair: Oh, but she's not going to go for the death penalty -- you know it.",
        "Dorian: What do you mean? Nora's been trying to get back at Lindsay for years. You know what? I'm going to that courtroom -- yes. And if Nora pushes forward this vendetta, she's going to have to do it in front of me.",
        "Addie: And me!",
        "Blair: Well, Mama, I don't think that's a good idea, okay?",
        "Addie: Why not?",
        "Dorian: Because you've never been to a courtroom, and judges -- they have a very high standard of behavior.",
        "Addie: I don't have tourette's. I know how to keep my mouth shut and I want to be there for Lindsay, too. We became very good friends at St. Ann's. Who do you think did all this?",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Lindsay?",
        "Addie: She's a makeover genius. And more to the point, she saved your life when she killed Spencer Truman. I say we make a show of solidarity -- Cramer women for the defense!",
        "Blair: All right, Mama. I'm in.",
        "Dorian: Me, too. All for one!",
        "Blair: Whoo-hoo!",
        "Addie: Yes!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What sign of the apocalypse has the two of you so chummy?",
        "Bo: Actually, that was more like a new year's resolution.",
        "R.J.: For Lindsay's sake. And Happy New Year to you, too.",
        "Nora: 2008's looking better and better.",
        "Bo: Are you going to war?",
        "Nora: No. I just like to be prepared -- especially for a case like this.",
        "R.J.: Getting a little ahead of yourself, aren't you? I mean, we're not even sure there's going to be a trial.",
        "Nora: I have great faith in the staff at St. Ann's. I think they know the difference between real illness and someone who is posing. I'm looking forward to the chance to send Lindsay back up the river from whence she came.",
        "[Nora gasps]",
        "Nora: Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Nora.",
        "Bo: How you doing?",
        "Lindsay: I'm okay. I'm as okay as I can be.",
        "R.J.: Well, you look beautiful, as usual.",
        "Lindsay: Thank you. Thank you both. I don't think I could get through this without you.",
        "R.J.: Well, just hang in there.",
        "Bo: Yeah. You're not alone. Matter of fact, looks like you have a whole cheering section.",
        "Dorian: Hi.",
        "Lindsay: Oh.",
        "R.J.: Is that Addie?",
        "Dorian: Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Hi.",
        "Dorian: How are you doing?",
        "Lindsay: I can't tell you how much it means to me that you're here, that you're all here, especially you, Addie.",
        "Dorian: Well, how could we stay away?",
        "Addie: We decided on the way down here that we should give you honorary Cramer woman status.",
        "Dorian: Oh, look at that.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I think you better get used to it, son. I'm not going anywhere -- not until I fix things between you and me.",
        "Jared: You know how many times I wanted you to do that? And you know how many times you came through? Not once. Never -- not when mom died, not when I was framed for something I didn't do, and not when I was trapped in prison for it.",
        "Charlie: Look, I wish I had had my act together when you needed me.",
        "Jared: You knew?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, your lawyer -- he called me.",
        "Jared: My God -- the only comfort I had when I was sitting in that stinking cell was knowing that you were too drunk to know what was happening to me. But you did and you did nothing.",
        "Charlie: Look, I was a screw-up, all right? I admit that, and you suffered because of it, but not a day passes that I don't hate myself because of that.",
        "Jared: Oh, go hate yourself somewhere else!",
        "Charlie: That would be the easy way out, for both of us! But I'm not going to do that this time.",
        "Jared: Take a look around you. Does it look like I need you? I worked things out, Dad, without you. Oh -- or is that what this is all about? That I'm -- I'm finally set up, and out of the blue, here comes daddy ready to make things right.",
        "Charlie: Look, I don't give a damn about any of this. The only thing I care about is you.",
        "Jared: Oh, well, too damn bad. I have a real father. His name is Asa Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, Cole, it's John. Do me a favor and -- look, just call me when you get a chance, all right?",
        "Michael: You okay?",
        "John: Yeah. Why?",
        "Michael: I know you're worried about Cole. You must be missing Marty so much.",
        "John: What'd you find out at the desk?",
        "Michael: Nothing that we hadn't already guessed -- that this Sally Ann person was here for a couple of months, that she paid in cash, and that she checked out in a hurry this morning.",
        "John: That's it?",
        "Michael: I didn't want him to start asking his own questions and figure out that we broke in here.",
        "John: Yeah, okay, okay. Forget about it, all right? You did good.",
        "Michael: Well, not good enough. We need to find this girl.",
        "John: We will -- if not her, then we'll find her friend Gigi.",
        "Michael: I'm scared, John. What if these girls are tag-teaming Marcie and blackmailing her? What if they have the ring because they did something to her? Or what about Tommy, what --",
        "John: Stop -- don't even think that way, all right? Don't even think that way. We haven't found anything that tells us they're not all right.",
        "Michael: Did you have any more luck when I was downstairs?",
        "John: No, the place is cleaned out, all right? Let's go check out the cafe.",
        "Michael: All right. What, is something in there?",
        "John: Actually, I looked through it and it was empty, but I didn't --",
        "Michael: Plastic bag.",
        "John: No, Mike, not just any plastic bag. Marcie was here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: So, does Gigi usually call in when she's about to leave? You want to sit, honey?",
        "Moe: Except when she doesn't.",
        "Marcie: Well, you know, she didn't seem right when I spoke to her a little while ago.",
        "Moe: So?",
        "Marcie: So something must be wrong, Moe. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Marcie's hell-bent on getting away from you two. There's nothing anybody can do to stop her.",
        "Ramsey: How does this thing work exactly -- just squeeze it?",
        "Gigi: Give that back to me.",
        "Ramsey: Huh? Must take a pretty big bite out of a waitress' salary, no?",
        "Gigi: Give that back to me!",
        "Ramsey: Hey, hey, hey, now what if Shane has an attack and doesn't have his medication?",
        "Gigi: Give it back to me!",
        "Todd: Shh.",
        "Gigi: All right! I'll call her again.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Ramsey: If that ain't Marcie McBain, get rid of it.",
        "Gigi: Hello?",
        "Marcie: Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Look, honey, I'm so sorry that I had to cut you off before -- I was just in a hurry. But, look, I just spoke to Moe and he said that you were supposed to be here last night, you never showed up, and then you never came to work this morning, so what's going on?",
        "Gigi: Okay, it's Shane. I was trying not to panic, and, um -- I -- I didn't -- that's why I didn't tell you this before, but he's having a really bad asthma attack, and my -- my car broke down and I need help getting him to the E.R.",
        "Marcie: Well, why didn't you just say that, Gigi? You know I would be there in a minute if I knew that it was about Shane. You -- you just made it seem like it was all about money.",
        "Gigi: I didn't know he was this bad.",
        "Marcie: All right. I'll be right there, okay?",
        "Gigi: She's on her way.",
        "Marcie: Would you do me a favor and give these pictures to Noelle? They're -- huh -- they're pictures of -- of you guys posing with all your pies and -- so look, I -- I got to run. Nice knowing you. Come on, say \"bye-bye.\"",
        "Moe: Is Gigi coming in, or what?",
        "Viki: Moe, it's not worth giving yourself a heart attack over a restaurant, you know?",
        "Moe: Are you still here?",
        "Viki: Yeah, doing my job like you told me to.",
        "Moe: Yeah, and I told you to go after Charlie, too, and you didn't listen.",
        "Viki: Yeah, and leave you here on your own -- that'd work. What were you bellowing about anyway?",
        "Moe: Sally Ann just dropped in and quit, and Gigi's taking another personal day!",
        "Viki: Well, I'm sorry about Sally Ann. I never even met her.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",

        "Dorian: Lindsay saved Blair's life. She doesn't deserve to be punished for it, and do not tell me that's not what you're trying to do.",
        "Nora: Well, I am the D.A. It is my job.",
        "Dorian: It's more than just your job to you.",
        "Nora: And is it more than that to you? I mean, is this little show of support about Lindsay or is it about sticking it to me because of Clint?",
        "Dorian: You just can't stand not having a fight, can you?",
        "Nora: Well, that's very rich coming from you, who's placed me as Viki's stand- in while she's out of town.",
        "Dorian: I wonder what Viki will think when she finds out that you're shacking up with her ex-husband, the very ex-husband which -- who I believe you told her to make a play for.",

        "Dorian: I just hope Bo doesn't get hurt.",
        "Bo: Oh, Dorian -- I do appreciate your concern. I do. But you know what? I have to talk to Nora for just a second, privately.",
        "Dorian: Of course.",
        "Nora: Oh, no, no, no, I just want to finish up with her, just for a second, and I'll be right with you.",
        "Dorian: It's classic. You lied to Bo, in a court of law.",
        "Nora: I'm not under oath.",
        "Dorian: Oh, and that excuses it?",
        "Nora: Okay, once again, Dorian, there is no relationship between me and Clint.",
        "Dorian: Right. What is it that I walked in on, twice?",
        "Nora: Okay, I don't know what it is, Clint doesn't know what it is. If you want to hate me for it, fine, go ahead, but I have a nice relationship with Bo. We are raising a son together, and that relationship's very important. So please, do not suck him into this vortex of hell you've created.",
