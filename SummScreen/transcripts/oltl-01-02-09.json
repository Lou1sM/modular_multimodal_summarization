        "Right when John is ready to go at it with Blair, he gets a call from Cole when Cole cannot find his mom and he's afraid that Marty may have done something crazy in regard to Todd Manning. In Marty's empty room Cole, Starr and then John all see the written material and everything she's kept about Todd indicating that she is obsessed about him. But they cannot find her. Todd \"takes the bait\" to accept her invitation to be with her. She leads him out on the roof. And she tells him he has betrayed her and ruined her life. And she wants him to die. Viki and Charlie informs Clint and Nora that they just ran into David who gave them some \"crucial information\" about Dorian. Hearing that, Clint and Nora realize that they must find David Vickers before more people find out that he is Asa's son and Asa has declared that he is the sole heir of the Buchanan fortune. David goes to Dorian's home after she's fled to the south sea islands. He runs into Addie and Shawn alone in the house. They wonder if he really has changed and has no interest in monetary wealth as he alleges that he has."

        "David: Namaste.",
        "Addie: David Vickers! Hey, peeps, this is my ex-husband.",
        "David: I'm David Vickeroshi. I'm following the path of the Buddha.",
        "Addie: Good for you.",
        "Shaun: Yeah, and I'm Mother Theresa.",
        "Addie: You're just in time for the beat-boxing.",
        "David: I did not come to dance. I came to cleanse my soul.",

        "Todd: Listen. Listen, I know it seems impossible, but it's just like everything else in my life. You know, pretty much my whole life people told me I was worthless. And proving them right seemed pretty easy. It seemed impossible that you would have survived that explosion, but you did. Even more impossible that I would find you, but I did. And you changed me. It doesn't matter when or how it happened, the point is that it did happen. And I know you and I being together seems impossible, but it isn't. We can be together if we just try. Please.",
        "Marty: My God -- yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Happy New Year.",
        "John: 2009 is working out pretty well so far.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Charlie, does this make you uncomfortable at all? With us, uh --",
        "Charlie: No, no, no.",
        "Nora: You sure?",
        "Charlie: No, don't worry about it. No, I think alcohol poisoning and hospitals are in the past for me.",
        "Nora: How long has it been?",
        "Charlie: Seven months in, now.",
        "Viki: Well, it should be longer than that.",
        "Clint: What do you mean?",
        "Viki: That last binge that Charlie supposedly went on? He didn't fall off the wagon -- he was pushed.",
        "Nora: By whom?",
        "Viki: Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: If this is being on the lam, it works for me.",
        "Alex: So glad you like it.",
        "Dorian: Alex Olanov?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: What is your mom doing with all this stuff about my dad?",
        "Cole: I don't know.",
        "Starr: It's giving me the creeps.",
        "Cole: Oh, my God.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Cole: I gave my mom my laptop and printer. I thought she wanted to research her life so that she'd remember something.",
        "Starr: Well, it seems to me like your mom just wanted to find out how bad my dad really did hurt her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. That's depraved, even for Dorian.",
        "Clint: Jealousy always brings out the worst in Dorian. But I didn't know that she was riled up about the two of you.",
        "Viki: Oh, that's not why she did it.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. No, she thought that I might get in the way of her big plans to take over B.E.",
        "Clint: How?",
        "Viki: Well, this was the day before the big shareholders' meeting. And Charlie had just told Dorian that he was on his way to see me to tell me that Jared was his son and not a Buchanan. And of course Dorian couldn't have that.",
        "Clint: No, because her takeover was based on the fact that we had defrauded the stockholders for presenting Jared as one of the family.",
        "Nora: So if Charlie had made it to you before the shareholders' meeting, then Dorian would have been out of luck.",
        "Viki: Right.",
        "Clint: We never would have lost the company and, much more importantly, Nash Brennan would still be alive.",
        "Viki: Jessica would not have gone off the deep end and gone after Natalie. The horrors of what this woman has done just go on and on.",
        "Nora: Are you going to press charges?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Bo already went to see her.",
        "Clint: And?",
        "Viki: Well, he was going to arrest her, but of course she's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Are you the new towel girl?",
        "Alex: Funny. I own the place. So what did you say about being on the lam?",
        "Dorian: Your hearing must be going. I was merely thinking out loud about ordering the lamb au brochette. So what is this about you owning something? What? Your discount airline ticket? The kid waiting at the bar, hmm?",
        "Alex: Wolf, bring us some champagne -- my private stock.",
        "Bartender: Right away, Ms. Olanov.",
        "Alex: So back to your question, um, St. Blaze's Island.",
        "Dorian: You're saying you own the island? All of it?",
        "Alex: And the surrounding waters.",
        "Dorian: Wow, that's some hunk of real estate. So who did you have to sleep with to get your hands on it?",
        "Alex: Someone you could never land -- Asa Buchanan. He left it to me in his will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Namaste.",
        "Addie: Bye.",
        "David: Namaste.",
        "Addie: I'll try and swing by Joker Dee's later.",
        "Man: You hanging out with tricksta sista A.C. tonight, or what?",
        "Shaun: No, I'm on duty, player.",
        "Man: All right.",
        "Shaun: See you later.",
        "Woman: Happy New Year, monk.",
        "Man: Bye, Addie.",
        "Addie: That was fun. Next time, let's do Hungarian folk dancing. Let's mix it up a bit. You look so handsome. That color's very flattering.",
        "David: It's good to see you, Addie.",
        "Addie: Even after our divorce? No hard feelings?",
        "David: No, not toward anyone.",
        "Addie: Really? That's wonderful. Let me get you a drink. I still have your favorite vodka.",
        "David: Addie, vice is a barrier created between the worldly self and the pure self.",
        "Addie: Oh. Would you like a cocktail, Shaun?",
        "Shaun: Thanks, but not while I'm working.",
        "Addie: What brought you back?",
        "David: La Boulaie is part of my journey.",
        "Addie: Don't you think you might be better off in an ashram?",
        "David: I was led here to be cleansed, to free myself of the burden of guilt -- to apologize to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What do you say you help me blow out these candles and we can continue this at my place?",
        "Blair: I guess we could do that. Or we could just stay here. You know, you do own this place. You can do whatever you want, right here.",
        "John: That could work.",
        "Blair: I think it could.",
        "Starr: Maybe your mom made last minute plans.",
        "Cole: With who? She doesn't know anyone. Besides, she said she was staying in tonight. You know what? Nora gave her a cell phone. Hopefully she took it with her.",
        "Starr: I'm sure she did.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Starr: Or not.",
        "Cole: I can't imagine what's going through her head right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I love you, Marty. You changed everything for me. All I want is to be with you. I don't care how. You know what? You told me you love me, that's all that matters.",
        "Marty: You sick -- you sick, pathetic bastard. You're deluded. I don't love you. I set you up, and you fell for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: No one's seen her.",
        "Starr: You talked to Renee and Nigel? I thought you said your mom was handling things pretty well after the hearing.",
        "Cole: Yeah, she kept telling me she was okay. But think about it. How can she be okay? Your dad's lawyer made a complete fool out of her on the stand. The judge dropped all those charges like your dad never did one bad thing to my mom. I mean, if you hadn't stood up and told the judge that your dad was planning on kidnapping our baby, he would have walked on that, too.",
        "Starr: Look at all the stuff that my dad has done.",
        "Cole: No, I don't want to look at it. I don't want to even think about it. I'm too creeped out that she's collecting it. I'm scared for her. I mean, where could she be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What's with the face, Todd? Your charming friend T\u00e9a Delgado warned you there might be a set-up. You thought the woman you raped could actually love you. Those pages in my journal? \"His past doesn't matter any more than mine. The new year will soon be here and all that matters, all I can look forward to, is starting that new year with Todd.\" It was blank. There was nothing.",
        "Todd: It was all a lie.",
        "Marty: Oh, yes. All of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Blair: Okay, you are not a cop anymore, so you do not have to go off and save the world.",
        "John: Cole put this ring-tone on the phone.",
        "Blair: Okay, okay, you've got to get it. You've got to get it. Okay. It's okay.",
        "John: He was really upset earlier.",
        "John's voice: Yeah?",
        "Cole: John, I'm sorry to bug you on New Year's Eve.",
        "John: You're not bugging me. What's up?",
        "Cole: I'm really worried about my mom. Something weird is going on. I don't know where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I should correct myself. There is one thing I've said in the past few days that was true. I was thinking about you to the point of obsession, but not with love, Todd -- with hatred. I'd sit up night after night reading about all the horrible things you've done. I've spent every minute of every day trying to figure out how to get back at you. And then it hit me. This -- fill you with hope and then crush you the way you crushed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Sorry, it's Cole. He's really worried about Marty.",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, I don't blame him. After the day she had in court?",
        "John: He found out she's been collecting information about Todd, doing a lot of research on him. And she said that she was going to be staying in tonight. And Starr and Cole, they went over there. She's not there. He's worried about where she is.",
        "Blair: What do you make of that?",
        "John: I don't know.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know, look. John, listen. There's no conflict here, all right? You and Nora are all Cole has, so let's go.",
        "John: No, no. Listen.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "John: Stay put, all right? Please? You know, she'll probably show up by the time I get there, anyway. I'll come right back.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "John: Have a drink on the house. Don't shift gears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I want you to feel what I have felt. I want you to feel it. How it feels to believe that someone loves you with every ounce of their being. How it makes your life worth living. And then to find out that it was all a lie. There's no real love there, no real love at all. You were played. The ground just -- the ground just folds right up beneath you. And you fall. Look at me. Look at me! This is what you made me. This is what you turned me into.",
        "Todd: Marty, I never meant to hurt you. Ow.",
        "Marty: You didn't mean to hurt me? You're a liar! You kept me scared and isolated for months. You didn't tell me I had a son. You told me that the man who loved me wanted to kill me and you didn't tell me you were my rapist. What am I supposed to do with that? How am I supposed to get past that? One step at a time, one step at a time. Swallowing that pill to make sure that there was no baby, just in case. That was the first step in destroying every trace of you. And this is where I finish the job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Weird, right?",
        "John: Maybe, maybe not.",
        "Cole: Well, why would she just take off? She said she was staying in tonight.",
        "Starr: Wait, doesn't your mom like to take walks?",
        "Cole: This late? It's freezing outside.",
        "John: Look, Starr's right, all right? Why don't you two go walk the grounds, see if you can see anything.",
        "Cole: I guess it couldn't hurt, all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: That's preposterous.",
        "Alex: What is?",
        "Dorian: Asa would never leave you anything in his will. The man despised you.",
        "Alex: Oh, I could have gotten him back anytime I wanted. All I would have needed is a bikini, some pork rinds, and a satellite dish.",
        "Dorian: He didn't mention you in the will.",
        "Alex: Oh, how would you know? You were so busy running around that ranch like a wild boar in heat. And it must seem silly now, all that paranoia about Clint.",
        "Dorian: It was not paranoia.",
        "Alex: Oh, well, the surprising thing is that Clint dumped you for Nora. That must really be embarrassing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Think of how much misery could have been avoided.",
        "Viki: Well again, I'm sorry to bring it up because this has been a lovely evening.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, what do you say we put this topic to sleep for the night? I think we could all toast to that, huh?",
        "Clint: Sure, absolutely.",
        "Charlie: To a new year, to a better year.",
        "Clint: Yes.",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Charlie: And to having this beautiful woman back in my life.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Listen, there have been a few bright spots in 2008. You and I, we have a new grandchild. And Nora -- thank you, Nora -- brilliantly managed to get Buchanan enterprises, Asa's legacy, back into the hands of family. Oh, did I say something wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: You seem so serious.",
        "David: I want to apologize, Addie, for marrying you for the wrong reasons. I wanted to get back at Dorian for screwing me on the Buchanan Enterprises deal.",
        "Addie: I know, dear.",
        "David: I used our marriage to extort money from her.",
        "Addie: Uh-huh.",
        "David: I wanted to show Dorian that you aren't the gullible, pathetic, borderline invalid that you appear to be. I wanted her to see how much fun we were having together. I thought it would make her nuts.",
        "Addie: And it did. But I know all of this, David.",
        "David: You do?",
        "Addie: Of course. And we did have fun, didn't we?",
        "David: I'm sorry I didn't marry you for love alone.",
        "Addie: David, we didn't marry for love at all.",
        "David: Namaste, Addie. That was the old David, who worshipped the twin gods of greed and revenge. I am the new David, now. I have freed myself of vice and desire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Don't tell me that Buchanan Enterprises might actually be going back to Dorian.",
        "Clint: Uh, no. No, nothing like that. But, Charlie, how did you find out what Dorian did to you?",
        "Viki: Ah, the person who knew all about it finally came clean.",
        "Nora: Oh? Who was that?",
        "Viki: David.",
        "Clint: Vickers?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Clint: And he told you this when?",
        "Viki: Just the other day. Well, he's back in Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: It's lovely to see you liberated from greed. It gives you a wonderful glow.",
        "David: In the interest of full disclosure, I have something else I must tell you, Addie. The gift that you gave me, David Vickers, the dog. Turns out, I was allergic. So I gave it away.",
        "Addie: Well, that's understandable.",
        "David: No, it is not. When a gift is offered, it should be received as a treasure.",
        "Shaun: That dog was a treasure, all right. The word on the street is the crown jewels of Mendorra were stuffed in the lining of the doggie's vest. You passed off a dog worth millions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: For your information, I was not the only one being cheated on at the ranch. Oh, yes. While you were sniffing around for money like a truffle- hunting pig, David was in the sack with me. And furthermore, he told me that he had only married you for money.",
        "[Alex laughs]",
        "Dorian: What's so funny?",
        "Alex: The joke was on him. I didn't have a dime to my name. I pretended to so he would marry me.",
        "Dorian: And why would you do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You should have killed me when you had the chance.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God, I wanted to. John's right. You're not worth going to prison over. But you do not deserve to live. You don't deserve to live!",
        "Todd: No, I don't. I just thought maybe you were coming here -- Marty, I -- Marty, I can't live without you. I don't want to live without you.",
        "Todd: I wish you had just pulled the trigger.",
        "[Marty scoffs]",
        "Marty: Well, if that's how you really feel, go ahead. Jump.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Why in the world would you want David to marry you?",
        "Alex: Well, he's hot. I hope that hasn't been lost on you.",
        "Dorian: There must be some other reason.",
        "Alex: Sex can be a very motivating factor. Very powerful. Even your sister Addie knows that, despite her regular flight path over the cuckoo's nest.",
        "Dorian: What are you saying about my sister?",
        "Alex: Oh, just that she's nuts.",
        "Dorian: You take that back, you tramp. You take it back, or so help me, I will drown you in that pool.",
        "Alex: Okay -- Addie's not nuts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: David, are you okay? You look pale.",
        "David: [Chanting] Aka sho no kun. [Voice breaking] Aka sho no kun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: David Vickers is back?",
        "Viki: Uh-huh.",
        "Clint: Why?",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "Viki: You won't believe this latest incarnation. He claims to have undergone a profound change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Aka sho no kun. And I'm fine and peaceful and full of joy that I do not need crown jewels. Nothing is needed beyond the path of enlightenment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: He has given up all of his worldly possessions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I care not about possessions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: And he claims to have absolutely no interest in money anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: My only currency is spiritual wealth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I've had the feeling all night that you've both been a little jumpy, but as soon as David Vickers' name came up, I figure something is wrong. What is it about David that you two are not saying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: \"I went to see Todd today. He really loves me.\" \"I went to see Todd today. He really loves --",
        "John: \"I called Todd. He agreed to meet me on neutral grounds, and I can't wait. 12-31-08.\" Where are you -- where did you go? Come on, give me something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't understand.",
        "Marty: Yes, you do. You said you wished you were dead. So go ahead -- jump.",
        "Todd: That's not why you -- that's not why you brought me up here, is it?",
        "Marty: I knew you'd follow me up here. I knew you'd say, \"Marty, I love you, and you love me, and we can work this out.\" Do you forget, all those months, the only people I saw were you and Janet. I know you. Oh, I know you. And I know your weakness -- 'cause it's me. And you'd do anything for me, wouldn't you? You would. I finally found out who you are. And it brought us here -- so you can let me watch you die.",
        "Marty: You said without me, there's no reason to go on. You said that, right? You'll love me for the rest of your life. And you'll never, ever have me.",
        "Marty: Can you live with that, Todd? Isn't this the only way out for you? Isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: Hey, Blair.",
        "Blair: Hey, are you okay?",
        "John: Yeah, look, this is going to take a little longer than I thought. Cole is driving Starr home. You might want to -- you might want to head home yourself. I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: You and me both.",
        "John: Hey, thanks -- and again, I'm sorry we had to cut our evening short.",
        "Blair: Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: So your sister was really having sex with David?",
        "Dorian: I prefer not to dwell on what happened between David and Addie during their brief marriage. Besides, he only married her to get back at me.",
        "Alex: Why, what did you do now?",
        "Dorian: I refused to share my good fortune when I took over Buchanan Enterprises.",
        "Alex: You run B.E.?",
        "Dorian: Did -- past tense.",
        "Alex: Ah, wow.",
        "Dorian: My takeover of B.E. was international news. Where have you been?",
        "Alex: Here, casting a whole new light on Asa's beloved sanctuary. And I have a booming business. So, David was begging you for a piece of B.E.?",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "[Alex laughs]",
        "Dorian: What's so funny about that?",
        "Alex: I am just so happy to not be involved in that family anymore. Oh, gosh. I was in such a hurry to get away from that ranch, I think I actually hit a coyote.",
        "[Alex giggles]",
        "Dorian: You idiot. That was no coyote -- that was me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I always get a little testy when I'm talking about David Vickers. I didn't want this evening to go south, not when I have so much to be grateful for. For one thing, Jessica. She's in good hands.",
        "Viki: I actually spoke to her doctor today at St. Ann's, and he said that she is making progress. They are thinking about releasing her.",
        "Nora: Oh, Viki, oh, Clint -- oh, my God, that's wonderful.",
        "Viki: She's going to undergo intensive therapy, but at least she'll be home with Bree and Chloe. Speaking of home, we should probably go home, huh?",
        "[Charlie chuckles]",
        "Clint: Charlie, I want to tell you that Jared is turning into an impressive young man. We're looking forward to having him in our family.",
        "Charlie: You know, he loves your daughter very much, and I'm sure he's going to be very good to her. Are you fit to drive home, young man?",
        "Clint: Yeah, I'll be fine, thank you. Happy New Year.",
        "Nora: To you as well.",
        "Viki: Good night, Clint.",
        "Clint: Happy New Year.",
        "Nora: I am not good at lying -- especially to Viki.",
        "Clint: It's not a lie, it's an omission.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Clint: Nobody can find out that Vickers is Asa's son, especially not Viki. She seems to have this soft spot for the guy. You know, if Vickers tries to make a claim for the family fortune, we could end up with nothing.",

        "Shaun: You sure you're giving it all up, Vickeroshi?",
        "David: I can show you the path to bliss, Shaun.",
        "Shaun: I'm full of bliss.",
        "David: Tina Turner is a Buddhist.",
        "Shaun: Your point?",
        "David: I'm not sure.",
        "Addie: Oh, David, Buddhism is lovely, but I'm afraid it would conflict with a few things on my list.",
        "David: I accept that. Namaste, Addie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: This isn't just for you, Todd. It's your one chance to be selfless. Do it for me. Let me be free of you. I could put all the pain behind me. I might be happy. I might be able to have a life. Please? Please. Do it for both of us. Do it for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Beaver Calhoun said that Vickers was spotted in Asia. Asia -- what's he doing here?",
        "Nora: Well, do you think he knows something?",
        "Clint: Oh, there's only a handful of people who know that Vickers is a Buchanan. How could he possibly find out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: Oh, was that you I ran over?",
        "Dorian: You nearly killed me.",
        "Alex: Well, we don't know that for sure. I mean, there's a possibility that it was someone else, or something else. But if I did hit you, I'm very sorry about that.",
        "Dorian: You're sorry? You left me like road kill. All right, Alex, move over, because now I am in the driver's seat. Oh, yes, I am going to sue you for hit- and-run. And when I'm finished with you, you're not going to have two coconut shells left to rub together.",
        "Alex: I told you it was an accident. What do you want from me?",
        "Dorian: Other than St. Blaze's? Hmm -- what have you got?",
        "Alex: Information.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: I'm glad David has found some inner peace.",
        "Shaun: I wouldn't count on it. The Vickers I know sees nothing but dollar signs.",
        "Addie: Not anymore.",
        "Shaun: I don't care if he's wearing robes or chanting. If a Brinks truck explodes, he would be the first one on the scene -- trust me.",
        "Addie: I think anyone can change if they want to. I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Well, Viki and Charlie said that David's changed, that he's renounced all material wealth.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I don't buy that, either. Oh --",
        "David: Namaste.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Information? About what?",
        "Alex: David Vickers.",
        "Dorian: What about David Vickers?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Vickers?",
        "David: I am no longer David Vickers. I am David Vickeroshi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: David Vickers is not David Vickers.",

        "Starr: Cole, I know you're freaking out, but John probably already found your mom.",
        "Cole: Yeah, then why hasn't he called? I've got to get home. I've got to see what's up.",
        "Starr: Cole, he knows what he's doing. Just let him take care of it, okay? Why don't you stay here tonight -- with me? I mean, if anything happens with your mom, then we can deal with it together.",

        "Todd: You want this?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Todd: This will bring you peace? This will -- this will make you forget about me, about what I did?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Todd: I can make you happy by doing this?",
        "Marty: You will.",
