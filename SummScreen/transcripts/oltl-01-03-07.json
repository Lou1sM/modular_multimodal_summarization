        "Jessica: It doesn't sound like a plow. Yeah, good move. Any more bright ideas?",

        "Nash: It's a cave-in, all right? I'm a crafty fellow, Jessica, but I don't control the rocks!",
        "Jessica: Well, gee, it's comforting to know that you didn't do wrong by us",
        "Nash: We're not buried alive. We're just -- bouldered in. All right? We're getting out of here. Trust me -- I don't want to be stuck in here with you any longer than you want to be stuck in here with me.",

Nothing is going to stop you.",

        "Clint: You trying to get rid of me?",
        "Viki: No, of course I just assumed you had stuff to do today. I don't want to keep you.",

        "Blair: When am I going home?",
        "Todd: I'm not sure. The doctors are going to move you out of ICU, Though. They think you're doing much better.",
        "Blair: Where are Jack and Starr?",
        "Todd: Uh, I've got a babysitter for them. I went home earlier to get them going and Jack insisted that -- they have your pancakes for breakfast. Apparently, mine don't cut it.",
        "Blair: How's Starr doing?",
        "Todd: She misses you. She's all over the place, picking up after Jack, telling what to do just like you. And they want their family back. They want their mom back. And so do I.",
        "Blair: I believe you, Todd. But we both know that that's not going to happen.",

        "Carlotta: Oh, well, it's only natural to worry.",
        "Marcie: How am I ever going to do with anything major, you know? Everybody keeps on telling me that we should just tell Tommy that he was adopted.",
        "Carlotta: Listen, whenever you decide to tell that beautiful son of yours where he came from and how he came into your life, he will know that he was wanted.",
        "Rex: Know what? We're not going to talk about Todd or babies or secrets today.",
        "Adriana: Avoid the problem -- that's good.",

        "Viki: I really do appreciate your thinking of including me as you begin your adventure.",
        "Clint: Well, it's a standing invitation if you should choose to reconsider. I mean, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Viki: Hmm.",
        "Clint: You didn't mind that I stayed h overnight, did you?",
        "Viki: Of course I didn't mind -- I invited you. It was -- it was really very nice, wasn't It? I mean, it was sort of like old times, you and me looking after the children.",
        "Clint: You know, we have been doing an awful lot of reminiscing lately.",
        "Viki: Well, that's holidays, that's all.",
        "Clint: Is that why we keep talking about the way things used to be, Viki -- because it's the holidays?",
        "Viki: Well, no. No, it's not just that.",

        "Clint: Asked you first.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on -- it's not a game.",
        "Clint: No, it's not a game. It's a question and I'm hoping to get an answer.",
        "Viki: It would be so much easier to answer that if --",
        "Clint: \"If\" what?",
        "Viki: If I knew exactly where you stood with Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Perhaps Clint would like to answer that question for me, too.",

        "Matthew: Duke gave me a crash course at the bachelor party. I really got into it. Me and my friends have been playing every Friday night ever since.",
        "Nigel: You think you can beat your old grandpa?",
        "Matthew: Maybe.",

        "Asa: Two exceptions.",
        "Matthew: Well, if you're wrong about them, how do you know you're not wrong about Dr. Lord?",
        "Asa: Matthew/here's one thing I do know -- I know about women.",
        "Bo: Yeah, he's been married 13 times, son.",
        "Asa: Well, at least, if that's true, makes me an expert, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, well, I may not be an expert, but I did have a girlfriend once, so it's not like I'm totally clueless.",
        "Bo: You had a girlfriend?",
        "Matthew: Wasn't a big deal. It was only for a few weeks anyway.",
        "Bo: So, you know, what'd you learn from the experience?",
        "Matthew: It's pretty simple. If you're nice to the girl, then they'll be nice back to you. So, maybe if you're nicer Dr. Lord, she'll be nicer to you.",
        "Asa: Are you here to or play? Jacks high, your bet.",
        "Matthew: I'm getting sick and tired of playing for peanuts and pistachios. Let's make this interesting.",

        "Clint: Should I open it now?",
        "Dorian: If you like.",
        "Clint: Ah -- a pencil.",
        "Dorian: I thought perhaps some day if you had some time, you might pencil me in. Uh-huh. If Adriana can find it in her heart to give me a second chance, why can't you?",
        "Clint: Dorian, I'm happy that Adriana has forgiven you.",
        "Dorian: You haven't answered my question. You have forgiven Viki so many times for so many things. Am I not worthy of the same? Am I just wasting my time here, or is there something worth fighting for?",

        "Antonio: Hm how much did you have to drink last night?",
        "Claudia: Not enough. Used to be I could toss back a few and convince myself I still stood a chance with Nash. But, last night, even drunk, I couldn't buy that lie. There isn't enough booze in the world to do that.",

        "Antonio: Today.",
        "Claudia: Ever. Nash will never give me what I need -- I know that now.",
        "Antonio: Nash isn't the reason why you drink, Claudia. You have an illness, and if you don't get help, you're going to destroy your life. You need to go to rehab.",

        "Jessica: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Nash: Come on, you tell me who I can be friends with. You have your husband bailing me out, you interfere in my love life. Admit it -- I'm a project to you.",
        "Jessica: Well, excuse me if I want the father of my daughter to be happy.",

        "Adriana: Yeah. Ready to go?",
        "Rex: Yep.",
        "Carlotta: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: So I'm in?",
        "Antonio: They're expecting you tonight.",
        "Claudia: My father had such high hopes for me. Out of rehab wasn't part of that dream.",
        "Antonio: You're making the right move, Claudia.",
        "Claudia: Well, I wasn't going to get any better here with Nash and no friends. I don't deserve you.",
        "Antonio: You know, I used to think the same way you do. I thought that I would never have the good things in life, that I was destined to be alone, but you'll turn things around just like I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: So tell me, what does this perfect Nash of yours look like, huh? Does he live in Llanview? Have a house? White picket fence? Kids?",
        "Jessica: I'll know him when I see him.",
        "Nash: Hmm. Well, then keep on staring, honey bunny, because if you don't like what you see, then don't hold your breath.",
        "Jessica: Well, if I'm so off the mark then what is it that you want?",
        "Nash: There's no getting what I want.",
        "Jessica: Right. Tess is gone.",
        "Nash: Oh, don't throw Tess' name in my face.",
        "Jessica: I'll talk about what you want. We both know what that means.",
        "Nash: If you care about me as much as you say you do, then back off. Give me time to learn to want something else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Ok, go ahead.",
        "Dorian: I have been thinking over what you said to me the other day.",
        "Viki: And what was it I was trying to do to you?",
        "Dorian: I think that you are willing to put up and fight to keep Clint away from me.",
        "Viki: Do you?",
        "Dorian: Yes. Because you didn't say that when I asked you if you were trying to get him, you evaded. You wouldn't answer one way or the other.",
        "Viki: Recall, I told you it was none of your business, and it still isn't.",
        "Dorian: I think the most likely reason is that you cannot stand to see me happy. No. This is not about love. This is about petty jealousy.",
        "Viki: Dorian, you are so completely off the wall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Too rich for my blood. I'll fold.",
        "Nigel: As will I.",
        "Matthew: Look it's just me and Grandpa, then.",
        "Bo: Your girlfriend's honor.",
        "Clint: Dorian?",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, why, is there another one in the running? Is Viki back in the running?",
        "Asa: I win. I got all the peanuts, red, green -- and I get to pick your next girlfriend.",
        "Matthew: And if I win, you have to apologize to Dr. Lord.",
        "Asa: That's why I'm not going to lose. Aces over. Beat 'em.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry to interrupt. I wanted to show Tommy the birch grove. You know, that's my favorite part of the grounds.",
        "Blair: Hmm. Mine, too.",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry to hear about what happened. If there's anything I can do, just let me know.",
        "Blair: May I hold him?",
        "Marcie: Sure."
