    "Recap": [
        "After the prison break-out and the power outage, the prison warden informs John and Bo that many inmates have escaped although he's not entirely certain exactly which ones. He believes that a \"dead man\" whose face is covered by a bandage is Mitch Laurence so at least they no longer have to worry about being terrorized by Mitch again. John and Bo question whether that's really true. Mitch finds Natalie and is ready to kidnap and take her somewhere until she lets him \"have\" his daughter, Jessica. She refuses. Clint tells Mitch it won't happen. But Mitch is relentless in taking Natalie with him. Troy MacIver also escapes, finds Nora and tells her he wants her and knows they are meant for each other. She secretly calls Bo and tells Troy what he wants to hear but Troy has a gun and knows he cannot trust. Cole Thornhart breaks out of prison to find Starr and Hope. She urges him to turn himself back into Statesville. But he urges her to let him see Hope and hide him. She finds a place for him to stay for the night and refrains from calling the cops under the promise that he will leave the next morning, but he doesn't seem intent on doing that. Todd wants to get back with Blair and she tells him that might happen some day but not right now. She appears to have mixed feelings about their future."

        "Blair: Todd... what are you -- you doing?",
        "Todd: What I should have done at midnight.",
        "Starr: James, are you back for one last kiss? [Gasps] Cole?!",
        "Cole: [Breathing heavily]",
        "Starr: Oh, my God. It's really you. What are you doing here?",
        "[Indistinct shouting] Get back!",
        "Mr. Evans: Check cellblock four. Ah, lieutenant McBain, thanks for coming.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Mr. Evans: Bo. I'm glad you're here.",
        "Bo: I'm not with the department anymore, but I'll do what I can.",
        "Mr. Evans: Hey, we can use all the help we can get.",
        "John: What the hell happened here?",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, the regional power grid was on the blink all day.",
        "Bo: We noticed.",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, it seems that one of the inmates, maybe more, had connections to the outside. Now, they were able to sabotage the grid. At midnight, there was a full-on blackout. The electronic locks here -- all disarmed.",
        "John: Shouldn't the emergency power have prevented that?",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, it took a minute to kick in. The inmates stormed out of the cells and attacked the guards, and they, uh, blew open the exterior gate with a makeshift bomb. Prisoners went flying out of here, heading God knows where.",
        "Nora: Is somebody here? Who's here? [Gasps]",
        "Troy: Nora...it's me.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. Troy? What are you doing? When did you get out of prison?",
        "Troy: I've missed you, Nora.",
        "John: All right. Get back to me when you have a number. I called in every unit that's not dealing with the blackout.",
        "Mr. Evans: I appreciate it.",
        "John: I also put in a call to Cherryvale P.D., All right? They're fanning out around the prison. Do we know how many inmates are missing?",
        "Mr. Evans: W-we're trying to get a handle on it, you know. At least 100.",
        "Bo: Were they armed?",
        "Mr. Evans: Unfortunately, the inmates were able to overpower the guards and take their weapons. Look, I'm telling you, I've never seen a break like this. It was perfectly executed. But fortunately, we got the ringleader in custody.",
        "John: Who was it?",
        "Mr. Evans: Prisoner 92973. Mitch Laurence.",
        "Natalie: [Screams] And happy new year to you, too, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: [Screams]",
        "Mitch: Are you, uh, happy to see me?",
        "Starr: Cole, what's going on? How did you -- wh-- get in here. Get in here. It's freezing. How did you get here?",
        "Cole: Is anybody else here?",
        "Starr: Uh, Jack and Sam are sleeping, but my mom and dad, they're around somewhere.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: It's really cold out here.",
        "Todd: It's -- it's, uh, it's -- it's warm -- it's warm in here.",
        "Blair: Todd.",
        "Todd: It's warm in here. Come on in. Tell me what's on your mind. [Clears throat] What's going on?",
        "Blair: It's all just too soon for me.",
        "Todd: Uh, didn't we just usher in the new year by burning up all the bad stuff that had happened to us in the last little while?",
        "Blair: Come on, five minutes ago, all right? Uh, you know, give the girl some time here.",
        "Todd: Okay, but what you wrote down on that piece of paper, that was about Tom\u00e1s, right?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Okay, so everything to do with Tom\u00e1s just went up in smoke. Isn't that enough? Why you still beating yourself up over this? Why don't we both just let everything to do with Tom\u00e1s go, okay? Just for tonight.",
        "Starr: Cole, you just w-what? You escaped?",
        "Cole: No. I mean...well, not on purpose.",
        "Starr: What does that mean?",
        "Cole: I-I don't even know what happened. The...power went out, and then all the cells were unlocked. And, Starr, it was totally insane in there. The inmates were beating on the guards.",
        "Starr: You look okay.",
        "Cole: I'm fine. I stayed out of the fight. But...the next thing I knew, I was heading for the exit. And when I got outside... [Sighs] Starr, it felt so good.",
        "Starr: I'm sure it did.",
        "Cole: So I just kept going. I didn't even think about it. I just -- I just did it. I just kept thinking I had to get here... to my family. I had to see hope... and you.",
        "Troy: How else would I have gotten out of prison? I behaved myself.",
        "Nora: So, you, um... you got out on good behavior?",
        "Troy: I was very good, Nora. You see, I knew if I could keep myself in check that I could get out sooner. And guess what. It worked. Isn't this great?",
        "Nora: Yes. Yes. That's wonderful news. I'm -- I'm v-very happy for you.",
        "Troy: Oh, I just really think that 2012 could be my year, Nora. I can feel it! Can't you feel it?",
        "Nora: Absolutely.",
        "Troy: So, how about a hug to wish me the best? [Both chuckle] I was hoping I wouldn't have to use this, Nora.",
        "Nora: [Gasps]",
        "Troy: But I don't have any choice. Put down the phone, Nora. Captain, we have to keep going!",
        "Nora: I don't understand this, troy. I was so proud of you when you said that you'd gotten out on good behavior, and now I see you have a gun? I mean, are you lying to me, troy?",
        "Troy: I had to. I didn't want to scare you.",
        "Nora: So, how did you get out of prison?",
        "Troy: This blackout. We made it happen. Once the lights went out, the cell doors just opened. Managed to pick this up in all the confusion.",
        "Nora: Don't you understand what's going on here now, troy? You're gonna have to go back there. I-I-I mean, you're gonna get caught. T-this is -- y-you've just made things worse.",
        "Troy: Nora, how much worse can they be? I knew I couldn't get out of there any other way. And I had to get out, Nora. I couldn't help myself... because I knew it was the only hope I had of ever being with you again.",
        "Mr. Evans: Laurence set off the bomb that blew open the front gate. Unfortunately, it exploded in his face.",
        "John: Laurence got injured in his own escape attempt?",
        "Mr. Evans: I can't say that I'm sorry. I wouldn't want that maniac running around out there, menacing our families.",
        "Mitch: Now, I'm going to take my hand away, and you are not going to scream. Otherwise, your parents' blood will be on your hands. So... will you heed the messenger? All right, then.",
        "Natalie: You filthy, disgusting lunatic.",
        "Mitch: Why, Natalie, don't you harbor even the slightest degree of affection for your old husband?",
        "Natalie: I had a real husband -- Jared. And you killed him, you son of a bitch.",
        "Mitch: Oh, Jared was worthless. He deserved to die.",
        "Natalie: [Shouts]",
        "Starr: Cole, you do know that James and I --",
        "Cole: Yeah. I know about you and James.",
        "Starr: Then what are you doing here? You just escaped prison!",
        "Cole: I've dreamed about this... literally. And then I'd wake up in my 8x10 cell. But now... just being here, it's... we played with hope for the first time in this house.",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Cole: After we spent all those months thinking she was dead, Jessica brought her back to us, and we played with her right here. Do you remember that?",
        "Starr: Of course I do. How could I forget?",
        "Cole: We were finally okay again.",
        "Starr: Cole... Cole, you're not supposed to be here. You're supposed to be doing time for a murder. You don't want to make that longer because of a jailbreak! We need to get you back to the police station, explain your situation. Maybe -- maybe they'll take it easy on you.",
        "Cole: No. I'm not going back there -- not until I see our daughter.",
        "Blair: I let go of Tom\u00e1s tonight.",
        "Todd: Right. I-I thought that we did all that burning stuff so that we could start over together, right? All the mistakes, they're -- they're -- they're literally blowing in the wind, okay? This is our year. This new year is for our year.",
        "Blair: God, I wish it were that simple.",
        "Todd: You don't think it's that simple?",
        "Blair: No. Do you? Really? Really, Todd?",
        "Todd: [Sighs] When I first came back here to Llanview, right, when I fought my way here to be with you, I was watching you.",
        "Blair: Stalking me.",
        "Todd: I was stalking you from those bushes right outside, okay? And I saw you... for the first time in eight years. And do you know how difficult it was to not just run to you, to... touch you... to tell you how much I had been thinking of you, how much I had hoped to see you again?",
        "Blair: Todd...",
        "Todd: We belong together. You know that we belong together. It's not about Tom\u00e1s, is it? If Tom\u00e1s is not what's keeping you from being with me, then what is it?",
        "Blair: It's you.",
        "Mr. Evans: Laurence is still unconscious. You won't get anything out of him.",
        "Bo: Do you know which inmates from Llanview escaped, Richard?",
        "Mr. Evans: We're trying to find out. I mean, things are still pretty chaotic. Now, we were able to lock down the cellblocks and to -- and secure those inmates, but we're still trying to get an I.D. On those that escaped. I'll get an update.",
        "Bo: John?",
        "John: Hmm?",
        "Bo: What are you thinking about Laurence?",
        "John: I don't know yet.",
        "Natalie: [Shouts]",
        "Mitch: [Groans]",
        "Natalie: [Shouts]",
        "[Both grunting]",
        "Mitch: Yes! Now! Oh, I love tangling with you, girl. All this over Jared. Well, at least John McBain gave you a child. But that pitiful Jared -- he didn't give you anything.",
        "Natalie: What the hell do you want, Mitch?",
        "Mitch: You know what I want. I want my daughter, Jessica.",
        "Natalie: I don't know where she is. She went out. And even if I did know where she is, you would have to kill me first.",
        "Mitch: Oh, well, ask and ye shall receive. But before resorting to bloodshed, let's go check upstairs.",
        "Natalie: [Whimpers, grunts] Wait. No. No, no, no. Don't. Don't. Don't.",
        "Cole: Please, Starr, let me see hope.",
        "Starr: You do see hope -- every week when we come to visit.",
        "Cole: It's not the same. Here, I can hold her. I can walk around with her. I could even put her back in bed and kiss her good night instead of just waving goodbye.",
        "Starr: The police can come in at any minute!",
        "Cole: Five minutes, Starr. Just five minutes where I can forget that I shot Eli. When I thought he killed you and hope, that was the worst moment of my life.",
        "Starr: Cole, I know that, and I am sorry.",
        "Cole: I know I screwed up. I just want one more chance to hold my daughter, to see her without guards timing the visit. Please, Starr. Can I see her?",
        "Starr: She's sleeping.",
        "Cole: Well, then I'll just look in on her, okay? I'll -- I-I'll just watch her sleep.",
        "Starr: Cole!",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Hope: Daddy.",
        "Cole: Hey, hope! How's my beautiful little girl? I missed you. I missed you more than you'll ever know.",
        "Todd: I'm what's keeping you from being with me? What did I do? What did I do this time?",
        "Blair: [Chuckles] It's not just this time, Todd. Come on. We've been through years and years of ups and downs, back and forths, marriages, divorces.",
        "Todd: That's life. Not so bad.",
        "Blair: The ups, they were, uh...amazing. The downs, they... oh, my God. Sometimes, I loved you so much that I couldn't even see straight. Then you would go, and you would... you'd so something, and you'd screw it up. I mean, something that was so terrible that, you know, most people don't even think about things like that. But...you'd hide it. Truth would come out. Destroy us.",
        "Todd: Yep. I did that to you more than once.",
        "Blair: How many times did I trust you, completely give you my heart and my soul, only to have you just stomp on that trust, rip my heart out, and tear that soul into little bits? I... I can't do that. I-I can't do that again, Todd.",
        "Todd: [Clears throat]",
        "Blair: I can't.",
        "Todd: Well, I feel like it's different this time. I feel like I'm different. I feel like I'm -- I'm... changed.",
        "Blair: How many times did you say that to me?",
        "Todd: It's different this time because the promises that I've made, I have made to myself. I made a lot of promises to myself in that hell hole, and I swear, I will keep every one of them.",
        "Blair: Can you guarantee me that? Hmm? Can you really stand right here, look me in the eye, and promise me that you won't let me fall for you again only to have you hurt me, lie to me...betray me, tear me apart? Can you promise me that?",
        "Todd: Absolutely not. Why the hell would I do that?",
        "Cole: There you go, sweetie. This will keep you warm.",
        "Starr: Okay, Cole. You saw hope. It's time to put her in bed. We'll go to the police station.",
        "Cole: Starr --",
        "Starr: I'm sorry, but it is the right thing. You need to go back to Statesville.",
        "Cole: I'm not going back.",
        "Mr. Evans: I need that list now! Yes, sir.",
        "John: I'm still just getting a busy signal. The land lines are still down?",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, they blew the system during the jail break. I mean, the only way we've been able to communicate is by radio.",
        "John: I got someone checking on Natalie and Liam, but I'd sure like to hear their voices.",
        "Mr. Evans: Look, I'll let you know as soon as the lines are up.",
        "John: Thanks. [Sighs]",
        "Bo: You keep looking at Laurence. Do you think something's going on?",
        "Mr. Evans: Okay, we haven't been able to get a handle on the women's side of the prison yet, but I got the name of a few of the men from Llanview who escaped.",
        "Bo: Okay. Who are they?",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, the first one is Cole Thornhart.",
        "Starr: What do you mean, you're not going back? You have to.",
        "Cole: Starr, you don't understand.",
        "Starr: I gave you what you wanted. You wanted to see hope. You saw her. I... what do you want, Cole? You -- you want us to go with you?",
        "Cole: No. This isn't about you and hope. It's about something else.",
        "Starr: What is it?",
        "Blair: You can't promise that you're not gonna hurt me? Okay, Todd. What -- what are you not telling me here?",
        "Todd: Well --",
        "Blair: No. No \"well.\" What -- what is it? What is gonna come back to haunt me and bite me on my backside that you've done?",
        "Todd: It's nothing. Blair...",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Come on. Who -- who -- who in their right mind would make a promise like that?",
        "Blair: Well...",
        "Todd: Truly? Can you make a promise like that? Can you guarantee me that you are never again going to hurt my feelings?",
        "Blair: No. No, I can't.",
        "Todd: Right. I can promise you I love you. I can promise you that I love our children. I can promise you that I will take care of you. I can promise you that I will look after our family. Isn't that enough? That's really the question, isn't it? Can that be enough? Because I already know that you want to be together with me again.",
        "Bo: What about the name \"MacIver\"? It's troy MacIver. Is he on that list?",
        "Mr. Evans: MacIver... Is missing.",
        "Troy: I belong with you, Nora. And you belong with me.",
        "Nora: I'm really flattered, but I don't know whether you've heard the news or not, but bo and I got married.",
        "Troy: Yes, I know that. But the only reason you married bo is because you thought you could never be with me again, Nora. You were afraid I'd never get out of prison. But I was framed. You know that, don't you? They said I was a serial killer. But even after they caught the real killer, they put me back in that cell!",
        "Nora: Well, that's -- that's not exactly how it happened, troy. I mean, you -- you escaped. You were in prison, and you escaped from prison at the same time that the music-box killer was doing his killing. And -- and we proved it wasn't you.",
        "Troy: That's right.",
        "Nora: Right. And -- but you -- then y-you had to go back to prison. You're gonna have to go back to prison this time, too.",
        "Troy: You know, Nora, I think this reunion calls for some wine.",
        "Nora: Troy, the last time we shared wine, you tried to poison me.",
        "Troy: No, Nora. I never did anything bad to you, Nora! That was Colin, my twin brother! Not me! He's the bad one! I'm the good one! I'm the one that is born to be with you, Nora! God. I love you, Nora. [Sniffles] Nora, I love you so much!",
        "Natalie: No, you can't go upstairs.",
        "Mitch: Really? Why not?",
        "Liam: [Crying]",
        "Mitch: Is that... is that my grandson, Ryder?",
        "Natalie: No. No, no. Ah... Ryder's with Jessica.",
        "Mitch: Oh, then that wailing must be emanating from your little baby. Let's go upstairs together and check on him.",
        "Natalie: You aren't going anywhere near my son! [Grunts]",
        "Clint: Natalie, it's all right. Your mother's taking care of Liam. Natalie!",
        "Mitch: [Sighs] Hello, Clint.",
        "Clint: Let go of my daughter and get out of this house.",
        "Mitch: Not without my daughter.",
        "Clint: You will burn in hell before that happens.",
        "Mitch: Clint, we can settle this like lambs... or like lions.",
        "Natalie: [Gasps]",
        "Mitch: Which will it be?",
        "Todd: You tell me you don't feel exactly the same way.",
        "Blair: Of course I do. Todd, I want to love you. I want to just throw away every little bit of doubt, and I want to jump right in.",
        "Todd: That sounds great. Why don't you do that?",
        "Blair: I can't. But...",
        "Todd: Hmm?",
        "Blair: I'm not saying that... that I won't. All right? I just -- I can't do it tonight. But I do promise you... that I will someday. Okay? Is that enough for you?",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's enough.",
        "Blair: We have so much -- so much to look forward to.",
        "Todd: Just not tonight.",
        "Blair: Mnh-mnh. Because you... [Sighs] [Laughs] ...Have to go.",
        "Cole: You see this? Someone smuggled it into Statesville. It's a letter -- from my dad.",
        "Starr: Your dad?",
        "Cole: He's alive, Starr. He was living underground. And when the police were after my mom, someone helped her get back to him.",
        "Starr: That's what happened to your mom?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: C-Cole, she -- she needed -- she needed help. She not only kidnapped Liam, but she nearly killed Kelly and Natalie.",
        "Cole: I know she was pretty far gone when she got away, but my dad says that after they were together again, she finally started to heal. And...they're happy. Please, Starr. I didn't even know my dad was alive. And now... h-he and my mom are together, and -- and they miss me.",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Cole: The -- the last thing he says in here is that someday we'll find a way to be together again.",
        "Starr: And you will... when your sentence is over. But it's never going to be if you don't go back to Statesville right now!",
        "Cole: Even if I hadn't escaped, I'd still be looking at nine more years in prison. I got to see my parents.",
        "Starr: You don't even know where they are!",
        "Cole: I just need some time to figure it out, and I -- I'll find them.",
        "Starr: Cole, do you see that little girl over there?! I know you only see her once a week, but it's a lot better than never seeing her again!",
        "Cole: I'll see her.",
        "Starr: How?!",
        "Cole: I'll find a way.",
        "Starr: How?!",
        "Cole: I don't know yet, but I will. Please, Starr. The last thing I want is for you to get in trouble because of me. But...you -- I don't have anyone else. You're all I have. You know that.",
        "Starr: Cole... I don't... I don't know what you expect me to do.",
        "Cole: I just need you to hide me until I can get myself together and take off. Please, Starr. If we ever meant anything to each other, you'll help me. Please hide me.",
        "Blair: Starr?",
        "Todd: You in there?",
        "Bo: Damn! The system's still tied up. Is there any word on the land line, Richard?",
        "Mr. Evans: They're working on it.",
        "John: I'll radio the LPD, get someone to check on Nora.",
        "Mr. Evans: What did MacIver do to Nora?",
        "Bo: He was obsessed with her. He tried to kill her.",
        "Nora: Okay. Troy, you're hurting me now. If you love me the way you say you do, why would you treat me this way?",
        "Troy: I just don't know how else to get through to you. Please. Please, just tell me you love me. Tell me you believe me.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Troy: Look. That's bo.",
        "Nora: I have to answer it, 'cause if I don't answer it, he'll worry and he -- he --",

And we should, uh, we should have that wine. I'll pour. Uh, bo was busy with the prison break, and, uh, Matthew's in D.C. With his brother, so we'll have all the time in the world. We'll be by ourselves, and no one will disturb us. So...why don't you relax? Put the gun down, and we can have some... wine.",
        "Troy: I thought you didn't want to have a glass of wine with me.",

        "Troy: No.",
        "Nora: Oh, come on. That's just the adrenaline talking, because I bet once the adrenaline crashes on you, you could eat a horse. [Chuckles] Since I don't have one handy, um, I do have some things. I know. Let's order out from your favorite restaurant. Remember the one that gave us all that exotic food? Remember that night? Hmm. So let's order, and then while we're waiting for the food... we can talk. We can make plans. We could celebrate. To us.",

        "Todd: She's gonna ask for a reptile any day now.",
        "Blair: [Chuckles] If we're lucky.",
