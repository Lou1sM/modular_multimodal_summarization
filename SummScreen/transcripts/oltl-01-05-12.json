And, yes, I know you're still there, lieutenant, and, yes, you, too, the ever-faithful Clint. But as always, Victoria, the decision is yours.", "Jessica: No. You're wrong, Mitch. The final decision is mine.", "Mitch: Jessica? Is that you?", "Jessica: That's right. And I know what you want, and the answer is \"yes.\" You can have me as soon as you tell us where Natalie is. Give her back and I'm yours.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nora: You went to prison, troy, because of what you did to me. [Sighs] And after you were gone, I had to pick up the pieces of my life and move on. I fell in love with Bo again. And we have a family. We've been to hell and back together, and we've stayed together. I'm sorry, troy, but nothing -- nothing -- can ever make me forget my husband.", "Troy: Actually, Nora... there is.", "Nora: What is that? What is that?", "Troy: You've had it before, Nora. Your old friend Lindsay gave it to you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bo: Troy said that he and Nora and Matthew were gonna be a family soon?", "Lindsay: Yes. But that's not gonna happen.", "Bo: No, it's not, because now I think I know where they are.", "Lindsay: Where?", "Bo: The shack that he went to when he kidnapped Matthew.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nora: Keep that away from me.", "Troy: It's gonna make you feel so much better.", "Nora: I don't need it! I don't need any medicine!", "Troy: It'll make everything so much easier.", "Nora: To do what?", "Troy: Nora, once you've had your medicine, your life with Bo will be like a dream that never happened. A dream you can't remember. And then you and I can spend the rest of our life together.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Clint: There is no way in hell that we're trading Jessica to Mitch.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jessica: Let's do it.", "Viki: No, Jessica. You cannot do this.", "Jessica: If I don't, then Mitch will kill Natalie.", "Viki: And what's he going to do to you?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "John: He won't get a chance.", "Clint: Is that a hope or a promise?", "John: I promise I'm bringing both your daughters home safe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mitch: Jessica is on her way here. I'll finally be able to give her a proper baptism into my church.", "Natalie: Jessica will never go with you!", "Mitch: I think my daughter knows her scriptures. Let's see. How does it go? \"Honor your father so that you may live long in the land the lord, your god, is giving you.\"", "Natalie: You're not her father.", "Mitch: She will obey me... if she wants her sister to live.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laser firing]", "James: Hey. So, what's the secret you and Starr are keeping?", "Sam: I can't tell you.", "James: I thought we were baseball buddies.", "Sam: Let's go, Phillies!", "James: So how can you keep a secret from me? Sam, it's okay, buddy. You can tell me. I know it's about Cole. Isn't it?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Starr: Cole, what are you doing?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cole: The same thing you are. Kissing the person I love.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Bo: Last time troy got out, he took Matthew to Llantano mountain.", "Lindsay: Okay. I'll drive.", "Bo: No, you're not coming, Lindsay.", "Lindsay: Oh, yes, I am. I know how troy thinks.", "Bo: And I can deal with him.", "Lindsay: But you know what? He thinks you're the cause of all his problems. I can talk to him.", "Bo: Yeah, but we're not gonna argue.", "Lindsay: You're right. I'll navigate.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nora: What are you talking about?", "Troy: You remember what Lindsay did to you in Cherryvale?", "Nora: What is that?", "Lindsay: It's my way out of this.", "Nora: What, death by lethal injection -- you're gonna kill me? After keeping me alive all these months, now you're gonna kill me?", "Lindsay: No, I'm not gonna kill you.", "Nora: I'm always gonna be there, Lindsay. No matter where you are, no matter how happy you are, even if you go back with Bo, I'll be right by your side, always reminding you of what you did to me. I will never let you forget what you did to me.", "Lindsay: Well, I'll take that chance, because you won't remember. You won't remember anything after I give you this shot.", "Nora: That's the same -- that's the same drug that Lindsay gave me?", "Troy: And it was wrong of her to do that.", "Nora: Yes. Yes, it was.", "Troy: Because she's not a trained medical professional.", "Nora: Oh, god, no.", "Troy: Not like me.", "Nora: No. No.", "Troy: Nora, I might not have my license anymore, but I'm still a doctor.", "Nora: No. No.", "Troy: Trust me.", "Nora: No.", "Troy: Trust me.", "Nora: No.", "Troy: I know what I'm doing. Trust me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "James: Sam. Sam. Hey. Sam. It's about Starr and Cole. I know it is.", "Sam: Ask Starr.", "James: Listen, Sam, I know why Starr didn't want to tell me, but the secret could get her into a lot of trouble.", "Sam: How?", "James: Well, if she's helping hide Cole and the cops find out, she could go to jail.", "Sam: Again?", "James: Yeah. And you don't want that, do you? Me neither. So you got to help me out, okay? You be a hero. Is Starr hiding Cole?", "Sam: Check the cabana.", "James: That's my buddy.", "Sam: But you didn't hear it from me.", "James: You got it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Laser firing]", "Starr: I can't. I can't.", "Cole: I'm not going back to jail, Starr. We can be together.", "Starr: I can't, Cole. I told you why.", "Cole: You, me, and our little girl.", "Starr: You want us to just run away with you?", "Cole: The cops won't catch us.", "Starr: I'm with James. You told me you understood.", "Cole: I lied. I know what I told you because I didn't want you wait for me.", "Starr: You lied?", "Cole: I said what you needed to hear. But I loved you when I said it. And I love you now. I don't care who you're with now. You still love me, too.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door closes] We have an update from the press officer at Statesville prison. The authorities are revising the total number of escaped prisoners to 198. The LPD is cautioning Llanview residents to stay indoors until the escapees are rounded up. If civilians do see a prisoner, you're warned to keep your distance. Get to safety immediately and call the authorities. All convicts should be considered armed and dangerous. Among the convicts recently added to the list of escapees is Hannah O'Connor. O'Connor attempted to kill up-and- coming pop singer Starr manning. The former L.U. Coed was recently transferred to Statesville from St. Ann's, where she was initially confined for psychiatric treatment.", "Hannah: Hey, kid. Can I play? ...Bury Starr manning and her boyfriend, James ford, alive.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Jessica: You can only bring Natalie and me home safe if you bring me with you as bait.", "John: You do what I say.", "Jessica: Sure.", "John: Not \"sure.\" All right? It's got to be \"yes,\" all right? You do what I say and only what I say. No \"I'm gonna do my own thing and try to save the day.\" Understood?", "Jessica: Understood.", "John: Good. Let's get going.", "Viki: Please, please, please listen to john.", "Clint: And be careful.", "Jessica: I promise, okay?", "Viki: Honey, we love you so much.", "Jessica: I love you, too. Listen, in an hour, this will all be over and I'll bring Natalie home, okay?", "Viki: Okay.", "John: You ready?", "Jessica: Yes. Let's go.", "Clint: Bye, Jessie.", "Viki: Bye.", "Jessica: See you soon.", "Clint: John. You take care of her.", "Viki: Oh, god, please, please, please keep our girls safe.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Natalie: Mitch, why are you so obsessed with Jessica when you've got me right here?", "Mitch: You're a bargaining chip.", "Natalie: Well, I can be so much more than that.", "Mitch: Can you, now?", "Natalie: Yeah. I mean, why would you want Jessica, I mean, when she's been crazy for the past couple of years?", "Mitch: Well, she didn't fragment after our time together.", "Natalie: Really? After you almost raped her? Yeah, she, um, thought she was 17 years old for months.", "Mitch: It was prophesied that I would have another heir. But I misread the signs. But the prophecy still stands. I will have another heir. Mm. Yes. The lord has shown me the way. The mother of my son is before me.", "Natalie: What?", "Mitch: It's you... Natalie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sam: These are my toys.", "Hannah: Don't you know it's nice to share?", "Sam: Not with you.", "Hannah: Ouch! I'm really fun.", "Sam: I saw you on TV. You hurt Starr.", "Hannah: Not really. Starr hurt me first.", "Sam: Starr!", "Hannah: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Inside voice. Understand? Okay. You be quiet or I'll give you a reason to yell. Got it? If I take my hand away, you'll be quiet? Okay. Look, I'll leave you alone. I promise, kid. You just got to tell me where to find Starr and Cole.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "James: Hey.", "Starr: I thought that you left.", "James: Yeah. I got that. You knew he was here the whole time?", "Starr: James --", "James: You lied to me.", "Starr: I lied to the cops, not you.", "James: Same thing. Starr, you almost got thrown into prison when you helped your dad escape from jail last fall. What do you think is gonna happen if they catch you now?", "Cole: Starr had nothing to do with it.", "James: Damn it. Are you that stupid? They don't care if Starr busted you out of Statesville. If she hides you, she is your accomplice. How could you put her in that position?", "Starr: I helped Cole because I wanted to. It was my choice, James, and I would do it again.", "James: Why? Is he right? No matter who you're with now, you love Cole?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Clint: Now, john McBain is not gonna let things get out of hand.", "Viki: Oh, Clint. For heaven's sakes. With Mitch Laurence, things are always out of control.", "Ford: Where's Jessica?", "Clint: Was the front door just standing open?", "Ford: I'm sorry. I heard about the breakout at Statesville on the news. Is everybody okay?", "Viki: Yes. We're fine.", "Ford: Well, does Jessica know that Mitch escaped?", "Clint: She's heard.", "Ford: Well, where is she? Is she upstairs?", "Viki: No. No.", "Ford: She didn't take Ryder anywhere, did she? I mean, she wouldn't do that. Not with Mitch on the loose, right?", "Clint: We should tell him.", "Viki: Uh, okay. Jessica is not home.", "Ford: Well, why not? Where is she? Does Mitch have her?", "Clint: No. Mitch doesn't have her. Mitch has Natalie.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mitch: You know, when I first returned to Llanview, I chose you for my mate. And you, Natalie... fell in love with me.", "Natalie: I never loved you.", "Mitch: Well, believe me, honey. You would have if we'd been able to consummate our marriage as husband and wife [Smooches] Should.", "Natalie: If you so much as breathe in my direction, I swear to god I will tear you apart.", "Mitch: I love that feistiness. Mwah! [Laughs] Oh, yeah. Kick. You'll be kicking, all right. Love that fire in you, girl. You know what? I believe our children will have that fire one day. [Whistles]", "Natalie: John will be here soon.", "Mitch: Yes. I wish we could take our time, but I promise you, my lovely, I'm sure that you'll enjoy yourself.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Troy: Relax. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.", "Nora: You don't want to do this, troy.", "Troy: You'll never let go of Bo if I don't.", "Nora: What happened to the man I loved, hmm?", "Troy: Nora... I'm right here.", "Nora: No. No, what happened to the man that came to Llanview? That's the one I cared about. He was so good to me.", "Bo: They're inside.", "Lindsay: Is Nora okay?", "Bo: Yeah, she seemed to be, but MacIver's got a gun and what looked like a syringe.", "Lindsay: Oh, no. That's not good. Could you hear what they were saying?", "Nora: You made sure Lindsay paid for what she did to me. Troy, you came up with the treatment that made me whole again. Why would you want to do this?", "Troy: To give us a second chance, Nora.", "Bo: MacIver's gonna do the same thing to Nora that you did. He's gonna wipe out her memory. And me with it.", "Nora: Troy. You can't do this. It's too risky, you know? What if it doesn't work?", "Troy: It will if I give you enough.", "Nora: What if you give me too much? What if I don't even remember you, huh?", "Troy: Don't worry, Nora. I'll get the dosage right. There's plenty here to work with.", "Lindsay: We have to stop him.", "Bo: No, Lindsay. We can't surprise him. Troy might accidentally stick Nora with that needle, or worse.", "Lindsay: We can't just stand out here.", "Bo: I know that, but I have a plan. I need your help.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "James: Tell me the truth. Are you hiding Cole because you're in love with him?", "Starr: I helped Cole because he's hope's father, James, and he shouldn't have been in jail in the first place. I helped Cole because it was the right thing to do.", "James: Is that the whole list?", "Starr: It doesn't mean I don't love you, James. I do. Cole won't be here for long.", "James: What's the plan, Cole?", "Cole: I'm gonna find my parents. We just have to figure out where they are.", "James: And how long is that gonna take?", "Cole: I don't know.", "Starr: But we will find a place to hide him.", "James: So, what? You're gonna drive him somewhere and smuggle him food every day? How many times can you do that before the cops catch on?", "Starr: I won't get caught.", "James: Like Cole won't? Starr, wake up. This is the first place they came. You're gonna end up in jail and hope's gonna grow up without a dad and a mom.", "Cole: He's right.", "Starr: What?", "Cole: This was a mistake. I have to go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Ford: Do the cops know that Mitch has Natalie? How do you know?", "Viki: Well, Mitch called us on Natalie's cell phone.", "Clint: McBain's on his way to St. Emmanuel to get her back.", "Ford: With backup, right?", "Viki: Not yet.", "Ford: Well, why not? Does john think that Mitch will just hand Natalie over?", "Clint: Ford, why don't you sit down.", "Ford: Hang on a second. What aren't you telling me?", "Viki: Mitch said that he would give Natalie back to us if somebody else took her place.", "Ford: Somebody? Jessica? No. No. How can you just hand her over?", "Clint: Ford, there is no way we would just hand over our daughter.", "Ford: Then where is she?", "Viki: She went with john to lure Mitch into giving Natalie back.", "Ford: This isn't happening.", "Clint: Afraid it is, son. They're on their way.", "Ford: How could you let her anywhere near that psycho?!", "Viki: She's not going to be anywhere near him. He's not gonna get close to her.", "Ford: Right.", "Clint: Hey, hold on.", "Ford: I'm not just gonna sit around here.", "Clint: Ford, don't you go there.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mitch: Natalie, if you'll calm down, you're about to get the greatest gift god ever gave you.", "Natalie: You're gonna have to kill me first.", "Mitch: Once you've given birth to our child, I will be happy to oblige you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hannah: Well?", "Sam: Take a hike.", "Hannah: Excuse me?", "Sam: I'm not telling.", "Hannah: Little boy, this is a bad idea. You tell me where Starr is right now or else I'm gonna -- ow! Ugh!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Troy: Let's not waste any more time. In just a few moments, Nora, you're gonna be so much happier.", "Nora: No, no, no, no, no, no.", "Troy: Our new life is about to begin. Aren't you excited?", "Nora: No, no, no, no, no, no.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lindsay: Troy, stop!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hannah: Hey.", "Sam: Let me go!", "Hannah: I would have let you go, but do you listen? No.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: Put him down.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mitch: I would be gentle, my dear, but if all you understand is force...", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Door opens]", "John: Natalie!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Clint: If Viki wasn't able to stop him, I don't know --", "Viki: He took off. I couldn't catch him.", "Clint: And she couldn't. So this is a heads-up for you, john. You can expect ford to come busting in there. All right. You call us when both of our daughters are safe, okay? Good luck.", "Viki: What? Voicemail?", "Clint: Yeah. John's probably in the church by now, but I had to try.", "Viki: Oh, my god. Look.", "Clint: Oh, god. A spokesman for Statesville prison has just confirmed that cultist, kidnapper, and murderer Allison Perkins is among the inmates who escaped in tonight's prison break.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Allison: I hate that picture. Really doesn't do me justice.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Todd: You're the girl who gave Starr such a hard time last year.", "Hannah: And you must be her dad -- the real Todd manning. I heard about you.", "Todd: Well, if you know anything about me at all, you know what I'm gonna do to you if you don't give me Sam. Put him down. Right now.", "Hannah: Actually, I think you're gonna stay right there.", "Todd: You okay, Sam?", "Sam: Yeah.", "Todd: What do you want?", "Hannah: I'll give you the kid back... if you give me Starr and Cole Thornhart.", "Todd: I don't have --", "Hannah: Five minutes. Or I start blowing holes in this one until there's nothing left but the glasses.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Starr: You can't just walk out of here.", "Cole: We can make sure nobody sees me.", "Starr: You don't have money. You don't have a place to stay. You don't have --", "Cole: I'll figure it out.", "Starr: No, you're gonna stay here.", "Cole: No. James is right. I put you and hope at risk. When I got outside, all I could think was I had to see my girls. It was dumb. The last thing I want is to make trouble for you and hope.", "Starr: You're just gonna disappear on us?", "Cole: I'll get word to you when it's safe, okay? My mom and dad will figure out a way.", "Starr: At least -- at least just let me give you money.", "Cole: I don't want your money.", "Starr: Shut up! Take it. Do you need anything else? Clothes or --", "Cole: No. I just want to see my daughter and say goodbye to her -- say goodbye to both of you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hannah: Did you hear me?", "Todd: I heard you. Take it easy with the gun, okay?", "Hannah: Don't worry. I won't slip and put a hole in the kid.", "Todd: The kid is named Sam. He saw Santa Claus this year. He really likes spider-man... and, for some reason, the Phillies, right? And he didn't do anything to you.", "Sam: She can have my toys.", "Todd: She doesn't need your toys, Sam. And she's not gonna take them, either. He's got nothing to do with this, right?", "Hannah: No, you're right. I don't care about Sam. He could live or die for all I care. But he matters to you, right? So you're gonna tell me where Starr is or else --", "Starr: I'm right here.", "Hannah: [Chuckles] Hey, guys! Come on in. What are you waiting for?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nora: Lindsay?", "Lindsay: Nora.", "Troy: How did you find me?", "Nora: Oh, of course. The two of you are in on it together. I should have known.", "Troy: What are you talking about? After what she did to you? Lindsay, if you're here to hurt Nora, I swear --", "Lindsay: Oh, please. I could care less about her.", "Troy: Well, I'm not available, so leave.", "Lindsay: Forget it, troy. I'm over you. I just wanted you to be the first to hear.", "Troy: I'm not interested. Why don't you go find Bo? He's available.", "Lindsay: No, he's not.", "Troy: Yes, he is. Nora is with me now. So if you get together with Bo, then he'll leave us alone, which will be perfect.", "Lindsay: Well, I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.", "Troy: Why not?", "Lindsay: Because Bo is dead. I killed him.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Allison: That is so sweet. But hold it right there, partner. You think I don't have enough bullets to hit both and you and the lady lord?", "Viki: Allison, get out of my house!", "Allison: I have to say, Viki. I'm impressed. That was forceful. Too bad I don't take orders anymore -- from anyone.", "Viki: Please. You're Mitch's tool.", "Allison: Not since my revelation. Want to hear it?", "Clint: No. We don't give a damn.", "Allison: It wasn't really my revelation. It was more like Oprah's. She said the most amazing thing. \"Never give your power up to another person.\" And I decided she was right, which is why you should put that phone down, Clint. Where was I? Oh, yeah. The revelation. I realized so many bad things had happened to me because I had put my faith in someone else. Like you mentioned, Viki, Mitch has a way with words. But in the end, where did it get me? And I'm afraid I made the same mistake with Dave. [Laughs] Excuse me. Ben and his sweet nothings.", "Viki: So why are you here now? Doing Mitch's bidding?", "Allison: Wrong again, as usual. I arranged tonight's early release program.", "Clint: You set up the breakout?", "Allison: All by my lonesome, which is more than Mitch could do, the big dummy. He's nothing without his best disciple, Allison. I can't wait to see how that filmflammer mucks things up without me.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Mitch: We had a deal, detective. Where is Jessica?", "Natalie: Don't let her come in here, john.", "Mitch: Give me my daughter now.", "John: No way.", "Mitch: If I don't get Jessica --", "Jessica: I'm here, father. Let Natalie go.", "Allison: It's amazing how much I let myself do the dirty work with no credit. Want to drive Viki crazy? Call Allison. Need a baby switched? Allison will do it. Want somebody dead? I'm sure Allison's not busy. She'd be happy to. Hello -- don't even think about reaching for that phone. Are you so easily bored? I told you. These are revelations. And not many people get the chance to hear real ones.", "Viki: Allison, we're very, very worried about our daughters. Do you know what Mitch is planning?", "Allison: I know all about your daughters. Your daughters, not his. At least Jessica isn't Clint's. Just slutty McSlutslut.", "Mitch: You're more beautiful than ever, Jessica. Come to your father.", "Natalie: Jess, don't.", "John: Let Natalie go. When she's over here safe and sound, I'll send Jessica to you.", "Mitch: You're not in charge here, McBain. Send her now and then you can have your slattern back.", "Jessica: I'm coming.", "Natalie: Jess, no!", "Allison: Your precious girls, slutty and cuckoo -- twin sisters by different misters. Mitch was so determined to have a child with you. Why was that anyway, Viki? It wasn't the gene pool or the mental-health history.", "Viki: Allison, what do you want?", "Allison: Am I boring you? This is your favorite subject. You. You and your miracle twins. One mom, two different dads. One is Clint's and one is Mitch's. What are the odds? It almost defies reason. It's practically impossible.", "Viki: What do you mean? What are you saying?", "Jessica: I'm here, okay? But you have to let Natalie go.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Both: Sam.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "James: You okay, buddy?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Sam: I'm fine.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Hannah: Cole... I knew you'd be here.", "Todd: I didn't. What the hell are you doing here?", "Cole: I'm waiting for Hannah.", "Todd: Of course, you are.", "Cole: I'm sorry, but... Hannah's the one I want. I'm really glad you found me.", "Hannah: It's been so long.", "Cole: Yeah. Too long. I've been thinking about you ever since I went in.", "Hannah: I missed you so much.", "Cole: Me too. I hated how we left things.", "Hannah: Wasn't my choice.", "Cole: I know. But now that we're both out, maybe we can have another chance.", "Hannah: You don't mean that. You came here for her.", "Cole: No, no. I came here for my daughter -- to say goodbye to hope. We're free now, Hannah. We can go.", "Hannah: Really? Really?", "Cole: Yeah. Come on. Let's get out of here, away from all these people -- just you and me.", "Hannah: Sounds perfect.", "Cole: It will be. Just let Sam go and we can leave.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nora: You're lying. You didn't. You couldn't kill Bo.", "Lindsay: I didn't want to. He didn't give me any choice.", "Troy: What happened?", "Lindsay: Well, I knew that you were gonna go after Nora, so I thought that would be my chance with Bo. I poured my heart out to him, and he didn't want to listen. He tried to slam the door in my face, so I -- I shot him.", "Nora: No!", "Lindsay: This is your fault. It's your fault because he didn't want anybody but you. Now he doesn't get to be with anybody.", "Nora: You have now really lost it, you crazy bitch.", "Lindsay: Don't worry. You'll get over it now that you've got troy. I just did you a huge favor. Nora's gonna need you to get over her grief with Bo. She's gonna fall in love with you all over again. You won't even need that drug.", "Troy: Maybe you're right.", "Nora: Bo!", "[Both grunting]", "Nora: Untie me! Untie me!", "Lindsay: Now?!", "Nora: Yes, now! Untie me!", "[Both grunting]", "Nora: Bo? Bo? Bo? [Crying] Oh, god.", "Bo: It's okay, red. It's okay.", "Nora: Are you okay? Are you all right? Oh, god. I thought you were dead. Lindsay told me --", "Lindsay: I was trying to help your husband.", "Bo: Lindsay had to lie so that we could get the drop on troy. Are you okay?", "Nora: Yes, I am now. I am now.", "Bo: Okay.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Clint: Allison, you want to tell us something, and we want to hear it.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Allison: Oh, so now you're interested?", "Viki: It sounds as if you want to tell us something about Jessica and Natalie.", "Allison: Is that how it sounded?", "Viki: Allison, for god's sakes, just spit it out. What are you trying to say about our daughters?", "Jessica: Please, father.", "Natalie: Jessica, no.", "Mitch: I can never refuse a loving daughter. You, I will see again soon.", "Natalie: Aah!", "Mitch: It's time to gather the flock.", "Allison: Forget it. You blew it. Not gonna do it. Besides, I'm not here to give you a history lesson.", "Viki: But you came to give us something, didn't you?", "Allison: An ending.", "Jessica: Go to hell.", "Mitch: \"Whoever offends her father shall be put to death.\"", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Nora: I guess I should thank you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Lindsay: If you really want to thank me... how about a pardon?", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Cole: Come on. Let's go. We can't take Sam with us. He'll just slow us down. Just leave Sam here and we'll go.", "Hannah: I wish we could.", "Cole: There's nothing stopping us. You'll let us go, right?", "Todd: The sooner, the better.", "Hannah: If only... no, no, no, no, no. It doesn't matter. You'll never let go of Starr.", "Cole: That's not true. She's with James now.", "Hannah: I know that. You're the one who won't let her go. But don't worry. I'll help you, Cole. Aah!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Natalie: No! You can't shoot jess!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Footsteps]", "Allison: Goodbye, Clint. Bye, Viki. It's been real.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Indistinct shouting]", "[Gunshot]", "Starr: [Gasps] No!", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "[Gunshot]", "[Both grunting]", "[Both scream]", "[Gunshot]", "Clint: I love you.", "[SCENE_BREAK]", "Viki: I love you."], "Transcript Author": ["Provided By Suzanne"], "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvixDT1qNxc"}
