        "Bo: I got a message from Clint, said something about David Vickers. What happened?",
        "Nora: He's here.",
        "Bo: In Llanview?",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm, I ran into him on New Year's Eve.",
        "Bo: Does he know that --",
        "Nora: What, he's Asa's son, and that he stands to inherit everything? No, of course not. Oh, he's a Buddhist now.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Bo: Yeah, right.",
        "Nora: No, I'm serious. He says he has absolutely no interest in any material possessions.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm. David Vickers taking an oath of poverty. I'll believe that when I --",
        "David: I have the sun and the moon. What more could I possibly want? Namaste.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Sorry to wake you. It just looked like you were having a nightmare.",
        "Cristian: No, no, I was just --",
        "Vanessa: Uncomfortable on the daybed? You know, you don't have to suffer. You should sleep upstairs from now on -- with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Good morning. Agent Troy, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.",
        "Layla: Wrong apartment, buddy. We're all Americans here.",
        "Sarah: No, it's okay. He's here to see me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd?",
        "Ray: Ray. Who the hell is Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Viki: Jessie?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. It's me.",
        "Viki: Oh, darling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd is my ex-husband and also currently my client.",
        "Ray: That sounds like a distraction you don't need right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Or the perfect cover for why I'm really here, to get you out of prison and nail the woman that put you there.",
        "Ray: Every day I spend in this agujero infecto is a day I can never get back, thanks to that puta, Vanessa.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, what happened to you is --",
        "Ray: You get me out of here! You -- you get me out. So I can make her pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: The daybed is fine.",
        "Vanessa: Well, it won't be fine if immigration shows up and my American husband is sleeping downstairs while Lola and I share the master bedroom upstairs. T\u00e9a said that we --",
        "Cristian: I can't do it. Vanessa, look, I've already pushed Sarah too much on this. What is she going to do if she finds out I'm sleeping in the same bed with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Um -- I'm surprised they sent somebody so quickly. I thought maybe I would get a phone call first or something.",
        "Agent Troy: No, at I.C.E., we take our responsibility very seriously.",
        "Sarah: I can see that.",
        "Agent Troy: You're not having second thoughts, are you?",
        "Sarah: No. The person I'm reporting is a Colombian woman. Vanessa Montez.",
        "Agent Troy: Vanessa Montez, isn't she the one who shot her ex-husband at the airport?",
        "Sarah: She's the one.",
        "Agent Troy: Why isn't she in prison?",
        "Sarah: Vanessa was supposed to face charges in Colombia. And immigration was about to give her the boot when she got a quickie marriage to an American.",
        "Agent Troy: You say here that this is a marriage of convenience.",
        "Sarah: Well, um, yeah, sort of.",
        "Agent Troy: Ms. Roberts, you need to come clean with all that you know now or risk implicating yourself in this fraud.",
        "Sarah: Okay, it is what you said it is, a marriage of convenience.",
        "Agent Troy: And this, what, Cristian Vega, he went along with it?",
        "Sarah: No. I mean, sort of, but it's not really his fault.",
        "Agent Troy: Is he, Mr. Vega, is he an adult male of sound mind?",
        "Sarah: Yes, but --",
        "Agent Troy: And he married Ms. Montez to help her fight the deportation order.",
        "Sarah: Yes, but Vanessa practically forced him into it.",
        "Agent Troy: Ms. Montez? How? What, did she threaten him?",
        "Sarah: No. No. None of this was Cristian's idea, okay?",
        "Agent Troy: Did he not know he s perpetrating a fraud when he married Ms. Montez?",
        "Sarah: Look, he's a man, all right? And Vanessa is a very attractive woman who convinced him that he had her life in his hands. He was seduced.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Sarah was a witness at our wedding. She knows what's at stake. She'll understand why we need to sleep in the same bed.",
        "Cristian: Would you understand if you were her?",
        "Vanessa: No, but Sarah is kind and compassionate like you. I owe you both my life.",
        "Cristian: You know, Vanessa, you don't have to keep saying that. I know how grateful you are for my help.",
        "Vanessa: But you still miss Sarah.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I just hate that I have to put her through this. But don't worry, I've made a decision, and I am going to see this through.",
        "Vanessa: I can see why she loves you so much. If I.C.E. shows up, we'll just say that you snore or something.",
        "Cristian: They'll never buy it. The immigration judges are already suspicious.",
        "Vanessa: We'll figure something else out, then. Coffee?",
        "Cristian: Vanessa -- look, um, Lola can sleep on the daybed. I'll sleep with you tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Just got to get Lola away from her stepmother so I can work on her. Don't worry, she'll crack.",
        "Ray: No. If you or anybody even thinks of \"cracking\" my daughter, you will answer to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Threats, Ray, really?",
        "Ray: I do not threaten, T\u00e9a. I make promises.",
        "T\u00e9a: Lola's the one who testified against you. If it was Vanessa who coached her --",
        "Ray: Of course she coached her. How do you think I got in here? I did not kill my wife.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know, Ray. And I promise you, I'm going to prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: You sure it's okay for me to visit? I mean, I don't want to bring up any bad memories or nothing.",
        "Dr. Levin: I okayed your visit because I think it's important for Brody to talk about what happened with someone who was there.",
        "Wes: What happened? You mean like over there?",
        "Dr. Levin: I'm talking about the incident in which Lieutenant Lovett shot and killed the Iraqi boy. You were a witness, correct?",
        "Wes: So, you want me to get Brody to talk about all that?",
        "Dr. Levin: Lieutenant Lovett needs to share his feelings with someone he can trust.",
        "Wes: Look, Doctor, with all due respect, Brody already shared that stuff with me. It didn't help.",
        "Dr. Levin: I know it seems counterproductive to have the patient rehash such a painful episode. But believe me; Brody has to experience all the feelings he has about what happened. It's the only way he'll be able to forgive himself.",
        "Wes: I don't know. I don't know how good I am in the feelings department.",
        "Dr. Levin: Can you give it a shot? You're all he's got right now.",
        "Wes: Okay.",
        "Dr. Levin: Thank you.",
        "Wes: Yeah.",
        "Dr. Levin: Thanks.",
        "Wes: Thank you.",
        "Dr. Levin: I'll be by to check in on him later.",
        "Wes: Yo, dude.",
        "Brody: Who let you in here?",
        "Wes: Visiting day at the zoo. How you doing, man?",
        "Brody: I'm living, you know.",
        "Wes: Yeah? What does that mean?",
        "Brody: That means things are not so good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, I spoke with your doctor just a few days ago.",
        "Jessica: Did he tell you Tess came out?",
        "Viki: Yeah, he did. Apparently, she caused quite a stir, huh?",
        "Jessica: She hatched a plan to escape, and when it didn't work, she went off on one of the other patients, this really nice guy. And she's still obsessed with --",
        "Viki: With what happened to the baby, right?",
        "Jessica: I just think that she can't accept that Bree and Chloe are mine. You know what? She's going to have to.",
        "Viki: You know, darling, when I spoke with your doctor, he had the impression that your other alter Bess might know a great deal more than you or Tess do.",
        "Jessica: About what?",
        "Viki: Something that you are not ready to face perhaps.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Don't you look terrific? Yes. Oh, my, I can't get over it. Every day, you look more and more like Viki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: David has found the light. Isn't that right, David?",
        "David: I've never felt lighter, Nora. Namaste.",
        "Nora: Namaste.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: He's back from Tibet, where he's hoping to return.",
        "Bo: Hmm. What brings you back to Llanview, Vickers?",
        "David: It's Vickeroshi now. The effects of all deeds actively creates past, present, and future experiences, thereby allowing one to be responsible for one's own soul and the happiness of others.",
        "Nora: He's here to atone for his sins.",
        "David: Oh, Carlotta, esteemed one, would you join us for a moment?",
        "Carlotta: Is there something I can get you, David?",
        "David: No, but there is something that I must give you. Carlotta, I am the one responsible for burning your diner to the ground. And while I will surely pay the karmic consequences in my next life, and perhaps the next, I would like to pay for my carelessness in the only way that I can, by offering myself for incarceration. Carlotta, would you hold my staff? Thank you. Arrest me, Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: I get why you feel stuck in here, okay? It's going to be rough times, but you will get through it.",
        "Brody: I killed a kid, for God's sake.",
        "Wes: It was war, man. The kid had a gun, all right? He could've taken out any one of us. You did what you had to do -- what I would've done.",
        "Brody: You remember when I told you I see stuff and it seems real?",
        "Wes: You're still there in your head. It's normal.",
        "Brody: I see him. The kid I killed. He's always there. He's got these sad eyes, accusing me \u0096",
        "Wes: Accusing all of us. You weren't alone. Look, hey -- I'm going to see you through this. You're still not alone, all right?",
        "Brody: What are you talking about?",
        "Wes: I'm sticking around Llanview. I got a part-time job, place to crash. Even got this crazy chick waiting for me back in my hotel room.",
        "Brody: Get the hell out of here.",
        "Wes: Nope. That doctor, he wants you to relive all that.",
        "Brody: I'll never be free of the kid, not ever.",
        "Wes: Who told you that, Dr. Levin? I don't know about that guy.",
        "Brody: No, it wasn't him. But somebody did. A friend.",
        "Wes: What kind of friend would say crap like that?",
        "Brody: It's okay, she didn't mean anything by it. She wasn't herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Your alter Bess is very much like my alter Jean Randolph. Jean was my gatekeeper. She was there to protect me and keep things neat and tidy. And although she liked to present herself as very responsible and respectable, in fact, her actions were as evil, if not more so, than Niki's.",
        "Jessica: Tess and Jean both like to lock up people that are making their lives difficult, huh?",
        "Viki: Well, yes, gatekeepers are pragmatists. And as such, honey, they can be extremely destructive.",
        "Jessica: Do you think Bess is destructive?",
        "Viki: I think she could be, yeah.",
        "Jessica: Worse than Tess?",
        "Viki: That's a possibility, yes.",
        "Jessica: Tess locked Jared and Natalie up with a ticking time bomb.",
        "Viki: Yeah. Why didn't Bess stop her?",
        "Jessica: Maybe she didn't know.",
        "Viki: Oh, no. Oh, no, she knew. These alters, the gatekeepers, they're watchers, and they detach so that they can see everything. If they see something that they think is a threat to the host personality, they step in and they do whatever's necessary to eliminate the threat.",
        "Jessica: You're right. If there was ever a time that I needed protecting, why didn't Bess stop Tess last summer?",
        "Viki: My guess is that she didn't think she was needed.",
        "Jessica: Tess tried to murder Jared and Natalie in cold blood. What could be worse than murdering my own sister?",
        "Viki: That's something that you have to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: When do you think that Bree and Chloe are going to be able to go visit Jess?",
        "Clint: Well, Dr. Levin says not yet.",
        "Jared: That baby doesn't know her own mother, and Bree's missing her mom like crazy.",
        "Clint: I know that, but we can't put a timetable on this. Viki's at St. Ann's with Jessica, so maybe later she can give us a clearer picture.",
        "Natalie: Well, what about me? Can I -- can I go see Jess?",
        "Clint: No, Dr. Levin wants Viki to be the point person for the family, at least for now.",
        "Natalie: Only Mom gets to see Jess?",
        "Clint: Natalie, Jessie's not doing well. She's very unstable. Tess keeps making regular appearances, and now there's another alter, Bess. And Dr. Levin doesn't want you to stumble into something that you can't handle, and he doesn't want to overload Jessica.",
        "Natalie: Dad, thank you, I appreciate the straight talk. Now, why don't you tell him the good news?",
        "Jared: Oh, um, yes. Well, uh, I've talked it over with my bride-to-be, and we've reached a decision about me coming back to B.E. I'm in. And, uh, what's wrong?",
        "Clint: There's a slight hitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Please, Bo, do your duty. Arrest me for burning down Carlotta's diner.",
        "Bo: What the hell are you talking about, Vickers?",
        "David: I can explain. I was burning a check that I was given by Clint and Nora, a check that had suddenly become worthless to me. So I lit a match to it.",
        "Carlotta: In my diner?",
        "David: Careless, I know, Namaste. I left it smoldering and walked out the front door, only later to learn that this wonderful establishment had burned to the ground. It is I -- and when I say I, I invoke the uncapitalized \"I\" of one who no longer identifies with the ego. It is I, David Vickeroshi alone, who is responsible for burning these hallowed, flan-covered walls to the ground.",
        "Carlotta: David, your burning check was not the cause of the fire.",
        "David: Carlotta, I've always been aware of your fondness for me.",
        "Carlotta: I received the report from the insurance company. It was the wiring. This building is old, and the circuits overloaded. You didn't do it, David. Your conscience is clean.",
        "Bo: Vickers, excuse me, you know what? I'm -- I'm curious -- how were you planning to compensate Carlotta if, in fact, it was your fault? Haven't you renounced all worldly possessions?",
        "David: That I have. I'm penniless. All I can offer is my apology and a willingness to serve time.",
        "Bo: Because money means nothing to you.",
        "David: Money is an illusion.",
        "Bo: Oh, okay --",
        "David: Like all things on the material plane.",
        "Bo: All right, let's just say, what if you found out that you won the lottery, okay? You were about to become richer than you ever dreamed of being. You wouldn't cash in the ticket?",
        "David: As I said --",
        "Nora: Money is an illusion.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but what does that mean?",
        "David: It means that I'm finally free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: So, in walks Vanessa. She gets him out of prison, and then turns around and makes him feel like she saved his life. And then she starts crying about how her ex-husband is trying to kill her. And, you know, Cristian, being the protective type, he -- he did what he could, and he got Vanessa and her stepdaughter into the U.S.",
        "Agent Troy: And she promptly shoots Mr. Montez at the airport.",
        "Sarah: Right. And fast-forward to a couple of days ago. Vanessa has done everything in her power to stay in the country, but no cigar. She's got the deportation order, she's got to go. And then, boom, a note shows up under Cristian's door, where she's staying, and it's a death threat.",
        "Agent Troy: Who sent the note?",
        "Sarah: Vanessa says it was her ex-husband, Ray, who she shot.",
        "Agent Troy: The one who's now in Colombia.",
        "Sarah: Yes, exactly, right? He's in prison. How could he send a note like that?",
        "[Agent Troy sighs]",
        "Sarah: I wouldn't be surprised if Vanessa sent the letter to herself.",
        "Agent Troy: I'm sure you have a theory about why she would do that.",
        "Sarah: All I know is that Cristian had absolutely no intention of marrying her before he saw that note.",
        "Agent Troy: Okay, where is it now?",
        "Sarah: I don't know. Look, Cristian is an honest guy who was put in an impossible situation by a woman who knew exactly what she was doing. Cristian was just trying to do the right thing.",
        "Agent Troy: Yeah, by breaking the law.",
        "Sarah: Agent Troy, listen, I promise you. Once you meet Vanessa Montez, you will understand why Cristian did what he did. She knows how to get what she wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What's Lola going to say if we're sharing the same bed?",
        "Vanessa: Look, my stepdaughter was not born last night, Cristian. She understands that her safety and mine depends on this marriage looking like it's real.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Cristian: Hi.",
        "T\u00e9a: You two look like a couple of deer caught in the headlights. Tranquilo.",

        "Lola: I'm ready.",
        "Vanessa: For what?",
        "T\u00e9a: Didn't you tell her?",
        "Lola: T\u00e9a invited me to brunch.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, okay, well, just give me a minute and I'll --",
        "Lola: It's just the two of us.",
        "Vanessa: Why?",
        "T\u00e9a: Cris and you need some time alone together. You know, get to know each other in case I.C.E. shows up.",
        "Vanessa: Well, shouldn't Lola be present for that?",
        "T\u00e9a: I.C.E. doesn't care about things like birthdays and your favorite colors. They care about your personal lives.",
        "Lola: She means sex.",
        "T\u00e9a: We'll be at the Palace if you need us. Come on. Have fun.",
        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "Vanessa: T\u00e9a's right. We put this off long enough.",

        "Vanessa: Yeah, that would be great, thank you.",
        "[Vanessa sighs]",
        "Vanessa: Um, I'm just going to go first, Cristian, because they're probably going to ask this.",
        "Cristian: Ask what?",
        "Vanessa: Well, what was it like when you first realized that you were attracted to me? When you first realized that you might be falling in love with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: So tell me about this new friend of yours, the girl who wasn't herself? What's so funny?",
        "Brody: She's a patient suffering from something called D.I.D., split personalities.",
        "Wes: Whoa, how many are we talking about?",
        "Brody: I've met three so far, but the main one, Jessica, she's really sweet.",
        "Wes: Sweet? Uh-uh. Which one's the hottest? Chill, bro. What, need a shot or something?",
        "Brody: You wish somebody would dope me up to stop the ass-whooping you're asking for.",
        "Wes: Seriously, no disrespect to your girl, man.",
        "Brody: Jessica's not my girl.",
        "Wes: Friend, whatever. Look, doesn't it creep you out just a little bit that she has all these people, you know, inside her?",
        "Brody: I remember the night we went into Fallujah. My knees were knocking. I told myself, you know, \"You got to buck up, punk. You're not some snot-nosed kid from Lakewood. You're a bad-ass Seal.\" I became what I needed to be to get through it. Far as I can tell, me and Jessica, we're not that different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I keep coming back to the issue of the baby, you know? Bess made herself known first, right around the time that Chloe was born, and Tess keeps insisting that there's something wrong with the child, which we know to be not true. The baby's fine. So, I don't know, maybe -- maybe they are both trying to protect you from remembering the pain of the delivery, or, I don't know, maybe something else happened that night.",
        "Jessica: There are no secrets.",
        "Viki: Oh, sweetheart, why else would a personality like Bess emerge, huh?",
        "Bess: You are badgering Jessica, and I will not allow it.",

        "Clint: There may not be a B.E. to return to. Asa's attorney, Beaver Calhoun, just showed up and -- with a posthumous message from Pa. It was a codicil to the will that we had not been aware of.",
        "Jared: And what'd it say?",
        "Clint: The codicil said that since we failed to meet the demands of the original will --",
        "Jared: The stock price fell.",
        "Natalie: But what company's didn't?",
        "Clint: Doesn't matter. The codicil said that everything that we inherited will be transferred -- transferred to the son that Asa never acknowledged.",

        "Bo: Yeah, but those are some real big ifs.",
        "Nora: I know. And in the meantime, I've got a kidnapping rapist to put behind bars, so I would really appreciate it if you could get me those phone records ASAP.",

        "Sarah: Hey, munchkin. You're not quite housebroken, are you?",

        "T\u00e9a: I'm so sorry, Lola. Do -- do you remember, like, where it happened, what room?",
        "Lola: Why are you asking me all these personal questions?",
