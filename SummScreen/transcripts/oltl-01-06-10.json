        "Cole: Dude, are you still thinking about Ford?",
        "Markko: Oh, what, I mention muscles, and you think it's about him?",

        "Destiny: You don't want a hot, new woman to help you get your mind off Rachel?",
        "Shaun: Nngh! What do you think?",
        "Destiny: So, come on. Let's go. We made a deal. We're in this together.",
        "Shaun: I don't see you doing 50 crunches.",
        "Destiny: You finish yours first, and I will match you solid crunch for crunch.",

        "Matthew: Me, neither. I mean, I never kissed a girl... or a boy. I never kissed anyone.",
        "Dani: I just always figured you were the kind of guy to have a girlfriend.",
        "Matthew: I mean, I tried. We even kissed once.",
        "Dani: But I thought you said you never kissed someone before.",
        "Matthew: Doesn't count. She was just playing a game.",
        "Dani: What happened?",
        "Matthew: I was into this girl all freshman year, and there was this dance, and they did this big joke in front of everyone.",
        "Dani: What did you do?",
        "Matthew: I got into a friend's car, and I asked him to just get me out of there. At the time, I didn't know he was high. I didn't buckle my seat belt...",
        "Dani: Oh, my God.",
        "Matthew: And ever since, I've just been wanting to get out of that wheelchair.",
        "Dani: So, no time for girls?",

        "Destiny: Oh, please. Anybody could do that.",
        "Shaun: So, what's yours?",

        "Layla: You hear that? I'm hot.",
        "Ford: My name is Ford, Robert Ford, but everybody calls me Ford. I really meant no offense.",
        "Cristian: None taken. I'm Cristian Vega, and this is Layla \"my hot woman\" Williamson.",
        "Ford: Nice to meet you.",
        "Layla: You, too.",
        "Ford: Sweet. Now I've doubled the number of people I know here.",

        "Starr: Yeah. I usually don't drool.",
        "Langston: Why would I be thinking about the guy who almost ruined New Year's Eve for me and Markko?",
        "Starr: Okay. Fine. You weren't thinking about Ford.",

        "Cole: You're sure you're not thinking about that guy Ford?",
        "Markko: Look. No. Yes. No. I mean, why do you keep asking me?",
        "Cole: Because you forgot to put the lid back on the blender?",
        "Markko: All right. If I'm thinking about Ford, which I'm not, it's because he's screening my film today.",
        "Cole: Ah, for that class he's teaching.",
        "Markko: He's only the assistant teacher, but, I mean, he's still a Hollywood producer. I want to know what he thinks.",
        "Cole: I get it. My mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Believe me, Ford is the last thing that I'm thinking about right now.",
        "Starr: Well, believe me, there's nothing wrong with having fantasies.",
        "Langston: The only fantasy I have is finishing this musical before the end of winter break.",
        "Starr: Well, the one you wrote 3 years ago was great.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but that was when we were freshman. This one has to be even better.",
        "Starr: What's it about?",
        "Langston: So, far, all I know is, opening night is right before prom and students will be involved.",
        "Starr: Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out.",
        "Langston: I hope so. This is the last thing I do in high school, and I want to go out with a blaze of glory.",
        "Starr: It'll be great. I know it.",
        "Langston: I have to finish it first, so you go back to your senior thesis, and I'll go back to mine.",

        "Todd: Yeah?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",

        "T\u00e9a: Todd, I'm sorry for all the lies I told you.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. I mean, all the times, you know, that I said I hated you, that I never wanted to see you again, it was just a bunch of crap. All I could think about was that night in that room, all those plans we made.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really?",
        "Todd: Yes. It was a waste of my life, man. It was a waste of my life to hate you. I couldn't hate you. I missed you. God, I'm gonna miss you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm gonna miss you, too, Todd, but we have to leave.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. I just-- I want you to stay one more night with me.",

        "Dani: Well, when I lived in Tahiti, I was a total tomboy.",
        "Matthew: Yeah?",
        "Dani: All I ever thought about was surfing. I wanted to be better than the boys, not kiss them.",
        "Matthew: Oh, I bet you were. So, now that we've both kissed someone...",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Matthew: What'd you think?",

        "Shaun: Well, if you need to talk about it, you know I know what it's like to get your heart knocked around.",
        "Destiny: By your own brother.",
        "Shaun: Don't remind me.",
        "Destiny: I would've felt way worse if Matthew chose Dani over me, but he told me they were just friends.",
        "Shaun: That's what he said?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. Why?",
        "Shaun: Just wondering.",

        "Cristian: Oh, right. That's where I remember.",
        "Ford: As if it wasn't bad enough I was hitting on your girlfriend.",

        "Langston: Oh, whatever.",
        "Markko: Hey, and if you finish all your stuff when I get back, we can celebrate.",
