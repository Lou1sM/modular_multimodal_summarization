        "Jessica: [As Tess] She's not here.",
        "Jared: Who?",
        "Jessica: Jessica. Remember me -- the girl that set you up, the girl that got you put away in prison? And I have got to find a way to make it up to you.",
        "Jared: Tess?",
        "Jessica: In the flesh, and I think that it is time that we finish what we started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, you can open.",
        "Adriana: Rex.",
        "Rex: I spent a bucket full of quarters till I got the one that looked like a diamond.",
        "[Adriana chuckles]",
        "Rex: Although it's only temporary, sort of like the loaner car of engagement rings, I wanted the whole world to know that you and I are officially engaged.",
        "Adriana: It's beautiful. And it means as much to me as a real diamond.",
        "Rex: Yes, because you are a downwardly mobile paragon of virtue.",
        "Adriana: And you are the amazing, irresistible love of my life. And I also want the whole world to know that we're getting married.",
        "Rex: Except your mother. Could we somehow keep it from her?",
        "Adriana: Hmm -- uh-uh. She's going to be the first one I tell and I can't wait to see the look on her face when I tell her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: God -- this is unbelievable. Oh! Wow.",
        "Charlie: Dorian? What are you looking at?",
        "Dorian: I -- I'm so embarrassed. I stupidly knocked over your book and this photo came out. Uh -- who is that woman?",
        "Charlie: Oh, that's Viki, a friend of mine from Paris, Texas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Why are you here? Did your brother send you?",
        "Viki: No. No, Marcie, I think the bigger question is, why are you here -- with Todd's son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: She's got no money and no time. She's got to go back to that diner.",
        "Todd: What are you doing?",
        "John: Well, I'm going to call the local police and see if we can't get some backup.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "John: What are you doing? Why are you pointing a gun at me?",
        "Todd: Well, I'm threatening you with it. Please put the phone down.",
        "John: What are you --",
        "Todd: Please, John, just put the phone down.",
        "John: I'll call you back.",
        "Todd: Listen to me. I intend to do this alone, with or without you. If you know where she is, with you. I intend to find my son alone, okay, at all costs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Whew -- you're alone. I was all set to get the boot.",
        "Miles: The boot?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- Roxy? I don't know if you noticed, but she was none too thrilled that I was here New Year's Eve. Is everything okay?",
        "Miles: Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here thinking that when I do get out of here, maybe I should try to find another place to live.",
        "Natalie: What's wrong with the carriage house? I thought you were happy there.",
        "Miles: I was. But Roxy thinks that I don't want to go out with her because I have a thing for you, and if I continue to live that close to her, she's --",
        "Natalie: Going to get jealous.",
        "Miles: Yeah, I don't want to risk it. She's -- she's been a great friend to me.",
        "Natalie: Miles, that's -- that's really sweet. I mean, it's kind of weird, but, I mean, in a -- in a good way. I mean, do you -- do you know it is so rare to find a guy that actually cares if he hurts a woman's feelings?",
        "Miles: Oh, I know what it feels like to love somebody, want somebody that doesn't want you.",
        "Natalie: Yes -- unrequited love. But requited love can suck, too. You can want someone -- wants you, too. Doesn't necessarily mean it's going to have a happy ending.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: So when were you bitten?",
        "Jessica: [As Tess] What?",
        "Jared: The acting bug. I see a lot of potential here.",
        "Jessica: Ah -- I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jared: No, this performance right now is really Oscar caliber.",
        "Jessica: It is not a performance, sweetie. It is me, Tess.",
        "Jared: Wow. Staying in character -- now, that's talent.",
        "Jessica: You know, I really don't give a rat's ass what you think.",
        "Jared: No, see, it's not your acting, because it's a top-notch performance, like I said. It's just that I'm not an idiot, nor am I clueless about your struggle with mental illness. Disassociative --",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
        "Jared: Identity disorder, I believe it's called?",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
        "Jared: See, when I learned that's what you have -- or rather, had -- I did my research. Tess was your other personality, your alter.",
        "[Jessica yawns]",
        "Jared: But you got integrated -- clever you. And now, you're the sincere and dignified and ever so unslutty Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry. Are you finished now?",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: Are you really going to keep this up, this whole -- I mean, come on. I'm on to you, Jessica. I know you're trying to manipulate me, and all you're doing with this whole little Tess dance is making me lose respect for you.",
        "Jessica: Well, no, actually, because I'm losing respect for you because you are being cynical and trying to bully me in my own house, so you can get out now.",
        "Jared: Are you saying you've been pretending to be Jessica for all these months?",
        "Jessica: I'm not \"saying\" anything because you would only say that I'm acting.",
        "Jared: And why would you do that, you know? Keep up such an elaborate pretense for all this time?",
        "Jessica: Well, Jared, things got complicated.",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Jessica: I got knocked up; I ran out of money, the Buchanans wanted me gone.",
        "Jared: Hmm.",
        "Jessica: You see, they prefer the sweet, kind of dull, totally unthreatening and completely unslutty Jessica.",
        "Jared: So you got them off your back by pretending, playing the role of Jessica, day in and day out?",
        "Jessica: Well, it wasn't that hard considering most of the time, their heads are so entrenched up their --",
        "Jared: Hmm.",
        "Jessica: Where the sun don't shine.",
        "Jared: Right.",
        "Jessica: I convinced my parents, my sister, my brothers, my grandfather, and Antonio.",
        "Jared: Hmm. What about Nash?",
        "Jessica: Well, Nash, I -- Jessica got sick. She couldn't handle it, so ta-da -- I came out. Nash sat by my side no matter who I was. He didn't notice.",
        "Jared: So now you feel indebted to him?",
        "Jessica: Oh, honey. I was going to leave town the second I was healthy, but then you showed up and things just got interesting.",
        "Jared: So, why didn't you tell me you were Tess before, like, when I first showed up?",
        "Jessica: Well, because I wanted it to matter.",
        "Jared: And it does now?",
        "Jessica: Yes, it certainly does, more than you know, because I'm going to help you figure out how to get something that we both want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Viki --",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: From Paris, Texas. She's a waitress?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and a damn good one, too. We met each other over the blue-plate special.",
        "Dorian: Ah -- charming.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: And the two of you became friends?",
        "Charlie: Oh, we sure did.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. From the gleam in your eye, I'd say just a little bit more than that.",
        "Charlie: Well, it started to go a little past just friends, but then I had to come back here and I don't know when I'm going to get to see her again.",
        "Dorian: Because you're here and she's in Texas.",
        "Charlie: Boy, I miss her.",
        "Dorian: Oh. You probably had some wonderful times together.",
        "Charlie: It's funny --",
        "Dorian: Oh -- what?",
        "Charlie: We don't even know each other's last names. It started out sort of as a little game, and then we just -- I don't know -- we just kept it up. I guess we kind of liked the mystery of it.",
        "Dorian: Charlie?",
        "Charlie: Hmm?",
        "Dorian: I don't know your last name.",
        "Charlie: Well, folks just call me Charlie B.",
        "Dorian: Oh. So it'll be, Charlie B.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Did Todd send you?",
        "Viki: No, he did not.",
        "Marcie: Why are you dressed like that? Oh, my God. Are -- are you the Viki that Gigi keeps talking about?",
        "Viki: Yes, I imagine I am. And you are \"Sally Ann\"?",
        "Marcie: Tommy? Tommy, honey, Mommy needs you to sit right over here, okay? Just sit right here. I got to go get something and then we'll be on our way. Look, I don't have time to talk to you, okay? I came to get my bag.",
        "Viki: Is this it?",
        "Marcie: That's mine. That is my bag. Now, you hand it over to me and I will be on my way!",
        "Viki: No, I am not going to do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Is that it right up there?",
        "John: Yeah, that's it.",
        "Todd: All right.",
        "John: And I don't see Marcie's car. Look, pull somewhere out of sight, all right, so she doesn't see us and panic.",
        "Todd: I don't care if she's panics.",
        "John: Really? Is that how you really feel? You really want to risk someone else getting hurt?",
        "Todd: Yeah, all right. I'll do it your way for the sake of my kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You can't stop me from leaving, Viki.",
        "Viki: Well, I am -- I am not about to let you walk out the door with that little boy.",
        "Marcie: What are you doing?",
        "Viki: I'm calling the police.",
        "Marcie: Put the phone down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, I know. I know I told you that I didn't like him, but, you know, you called me on it before I recognized my feelings.",
        "Miles: So you and he --",
        "Natalie: In Texas. You know, Jared and I started talking and kind of got to know each other, thought we'd see where it would go when we got back. So which sounds worse -- that he's my uncle or I'm his niece?",
        "Miles: Sorry it didn't work out.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, that's the way it goes. I'm fine -- really fine.",
        "Miles: You know what? You deserve to be more than fine -- you should be happy.",
        "Natalie: So should we all. You know, and quit feeling guilty about this whole Roxy thing. She falls in and out of love with guys all the time. She's -- she's a tough bird. She'll get over it.",
        "Miles: What about you? Will you be able to get over Jared?",
        "Nurse: Sorry to interrupt. Need to check your vitals, Mr. Laurence.",
        "Miles: Okay.",
        "Natalie: I'll be right outside. I won.",
        "Miles: Pfft.",
        "Nash: Natalie --",
        "Natalie: Nash.",
        "Nash: Hi, sorry. Lois told me I could find you here.",
        "Natalie: What's wrong?",
        "Nash: And I wanted to get here before your uncle got to you.",
        "Natalie: What's going on?",
        "Nash: Well, nothing so far, but if Jared gets his way, I'm going to lose my vineyard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: That is so sweet of you to offer, Tess. But I'm doing okay. I don't need your help.",
        "Jessica: [As Tess] Yeah, that's true. You've been doing very, very well on your own so far. That scam was real good -- genius, actually.",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: D.N.A. doesn't lie.",
        "Jessica: Oh, honey. It can fib some of the time. But I'm sure you would have no problem proving that you were Homer Simpson's son. You are just that clever.",
        "Jared: Is there a point to this?",
        "Jessica: I want that inheritance as much as you do.",
        "Jared: And that involves me how?",
        "Jessica: Oh. Okay. We all know that Nash is as dumb as a salad bar, but he did have a really good point. The Buchanans -- they hate you.",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Jessica: And you are going to have trouble convincing them at the sky is blue, let alone convincing them to buy this lame-ass vineyard. So, what you need is an ally, and ta-da! I'm right here. It's your lucky day",
        "Jared: Does it not occur to you that my memories of the two of us are not all that fond? That because of you, I spent two years in jail and lost everything? I wouldn't get in bed with you, literally or figuratively, if you were the last woman on this planet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Oh, those family gatherings at La Boulaie -- how I do so look forward to them. The awkward silences, the me wanting to scream at having to sit there with a doofus smile on my face -- warms my heart just thinking about it.",
        "Adriana: We don't have to go to those gatherings, you know? There's no law.",
        "Rex: No, no, no, no. We don't want to piss everyone off. I'm sure in no time flat, I'll be calling Dorian \"mom\" and she'll be gushing to all her friends about her adorable son-in-law. It will be downright nauseating.",
        "Adriana: Right.",
        "Rex: You look a little nauseated right now. What -- what is it?",
        "Adriana: I was just thinking about this past Christmas, the Cramer women -- not a good time.",
        "Rex: What happened?",
        "Adriana: Okay. I was going to tell you the minute that you got back, but then you proposed and then Michael and John realized that it was Marcie's ring and --",
        "Rex: What is it, Adriana?",
        "Adriana: Blair found out that you were working for Michael and she kept attacking you because you were supporting the kidnapper. And then she went after me because I'm being disloyal to my family and it was really mean and really insulting and, finally, I couldn't take it anymore so I told her I had nothing to be sorry about.",
        "Rex: And then you said?",
        "Adriana: And then I said I was glad that I kept the secret about Tommy.",
        "Rex: Okay -- are you telling me that you -- you -- you willingly admitted to keeping the truth about Todd's son from him?",
        "Adriana: Dumb, huh?",
        "Rex: \"Dumb\"? No. No, no, I'd say it's -- it's insane, stupid, moronic, and very, very bad, so I think that we'll be sharing our \"I dos\" from behind bars in Statesville. That cool with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: And this Viki -- um, is she from Texas -- [Southern accent] Born and raised?",
        "Charlie: Why are you so interested?",
        "Dorian: [Normal voice] I'm a hopeless romantic. Just -- may I?",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: I -- I -- I adore hearing all about, you know, how people meet, what attracts them to each other. It -- it gives me so much hope, so indulge me.",
        "Charlie: Okay. Uh -- no, she doesn't come from Texas. Actually, she's got a whole other life somewhere else. She's got grown children.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Charlie: And I don't know anything about them, or anything about that life, at all.",
        "Dorian: Or where that other life is.",
        "Charlie: Yeah -- no. But I hope to get a chance to find out.",
        "Dorian: But you don't know how long you're going to be here.",
        "Charlie: No. Or if she's going to be in Paris when I get back there.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Oh, my! This is the most amazing coincidence!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: The vineyard is your dream.",
        "Nash: Yes, it is, except Jared doesn't care about that, does he? All he cares about is the money, money, money, money, money.",
        "Natalie: He wants Buchanan Enterprises to buy out the vineyard?",
        "Nash: Yeah. He thinks that you guys should go and make my label a franchise, make it go global, that it would make a whole bunch of money and the B.E. stock will go up.",
        "Natalie: And then we'll all be closer to getting that inheritance by the terms of Grandpa's will.",
        "Nash: Exactly.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "Nash: That's not exactly how I envisioned my winery, you know? I wanted to stay small, kind of a hands-on family operation.",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Natalie: It's just from a business standpoint, Jared's got a good idea.",
        "Nash: Oh, come on. You are not going to back up that backstabbing son of a --",
        "Natalie: No, no, no, no, no. No, I'm -- I'm not. Family is way more important to me than -- than profit, okay? And it was important to Grandpa, as well.",
        "Nash: If you back up Jared on this --",
        "Natalie: I'm not backing up Jared. Nash, look, don't freak out. No matter what, Jared's going to have to get the other board members to agree to this and they're Buchanans.",
        "Nash: Including Jessica.",
        "Natalie: Exactly. It's -- she would never go for this.",
        "Nash: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: [As Tess] You -- you don't like me? You're still pissed at me? I'm so sorry.",
        "Jared: That surprises you? Did you think I was going to be over having lost two years of my life? \"Hey, Tess, no hard feelings. So you stole a bunch of stuff and I took the blame for it -- I'm sure your intentions were honorable.\"",
        "Jessica: Oh, grow up! I didn't know you'd spend any time in jail. I thought you'd be smart enough to talk your way out of it.",
        "Jared: Okay, that is a lie.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Jared: You never for one minute thought about what would happen to me, much less gave a damn.",
        "Jessica: Okay! But I give a damn now because you have proven yourself. The boy I met in Atlantic City was a loser, he was a nobody! But the guy -- the guy that got all angry about this naughty girl named Tess and followed her all the way to Llanview and then became a Buchanan -- that's what I call a happy ending.",
        "Jared: What do you want from me?",
        "Jessica: Oh, it's not what I want from you -- it's what I want for us.",
        "Jared: Oh, right -- the family fortune?",
        "Jessica: Uh-huh, and I know how to get it.",
        "Jared: Drop the act.",
        "Jessica: Jared, I have dropped the act. The act was playing boring, wimpy, Jessica, although she is stunningly good-looking.",
        "Jared: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jessica: All right, I give up. See you later, dude.",
        "Jared: Okay, wait. If you're really Tess, prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What a coincidence! I -- I recognize this adorable blue waitress' uniform with the emblem of Texas, with the tricolor of France -- for goodness sakes! It's the Bon-Jour Cafe, right, in Paris, Texas? I know the place!",
        "Charlie: You do?",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: I do -- I was there just recently. The owner's name is Moe, isn't it?",
        "Charlie: That's absolutely right.",
        "Dorian: I was very impressed with his culinary skills, especially his bouillabaisse. It was fantastique!",
        "Charlie: Now, exactly when were you there?",
        "Dorian: Well, just before you found me unconscious at the Buchanan ranch.",
        "Charlie: Well -- oh. My God, that is a coincidence. I mean, do you realize that Viki might've waited on your table?",
        "Dorian: No. I would remember being waited on by a woman so handsome. Hmm. Yes, I would've remembered. This must mean something.",
        "Charlie: Like what?",
        "Dorian: Right from the beginning, our friendship has been fraught with coincidences from, well, our meeting at the Buchanan ranch to my knowing the young man you were looking for in Llanview -- Jared Banks, now Buchanan -- to our both being at the same \"in the middle of nowhere\" cafe, possibly at the same time.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, some people don't believe there are any real coincidences in life.",
        "Dorian: If that's the case, then you and I have met up again for some very special reason.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: No, Marcie. You don't want to do that.",
        "Marcie: Give me the phone. Give me the phone!",
        "Viki: Marcie, there's a child here. A child, and the only mother he's ever known in his life is standing there holding a gun? That's what you want him to see? Is that what you want?",
        "Marcie: I want to be someplace safe with my son, Viki -- that's what I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: All right, that's her car.",
        "John: Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. There's a -- there's a back entrance to this place. See if we can do this quietly, all right? The guy said it's usually locked, but let's check it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Now, hand me my bag and I will be on my way.",
        "[Todd jiggles doorknob]",
        "John: Marcie -- hey.",
        "Marcie: John, I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Marcie: What am I going to do? Oh, my God -- what am I going to do, honey?",
        "Viki: Marcie, there's only one thing you can do now. Marcie --",
        "Todd: Marcie? Open the door. Open the door. Bring me my kid.",
        "Viki: Marcie, look, I'll -- I'll talk to Todd. I'll get him to calm down.",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Todd: Marcie!",
        "Marcie: No, lo, I -- I have to think, all right? There has to be another way out of this. There just has to be.",
        "Todd: Marcie, you better get out here. I've got a gun.",
        "Marcie: So do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You're saying that my sister would sell out her own husband?",
        "Nash: Well, if she's backed into a corner, she might.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's really nice. I'll make sure to tell her. It'll warm her heart.",
        "Nash: Oh, you know what I mean.",
        "Natalie: No, you have no faith in her.",
        "Nash: No, that's not what I mean.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Off the subject of my sister's loyalty, or lack thereof. I hate to say it, but I think that the Buchanans would agree to have Buchanan Enterprises buy out your vineyard.",
        "Nash: All right, well, then they are as stupid as you are and they can all go to hell.",
        "Natalie: Okay, look, you can't deny that Jared's got a really good idea here, and it would get him some credit with the other family members.",
        "Nash: It's a stupid idea. My vineyard makes no money, and do you really think that I give a damn about Jared getting credit with the B.E. members? You know, I'm still not so sure that he didn't dummy with that D.N.A. test somehow.",
        "Natalie: Would you give it a rest?",
        "Nash: Why don't you get the stars out of your eyes and stop backing that jerk up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How'd you make out?",
        "Miles: I'm good. What about you?",
        "Natalie: Not so much.",
        "Miles: Jared?",
        "Natalie: You know, you would think at by now, I would have figured out a way to -- I don't know -- get over men that don't deserve me, especially when one of those men turns out to be my adoring uncle. I mean, you would think that that would make it much easier to get past, given the added creepiness of the whole thing. But for whatever reason, I'm clueless. Any suggestions?",
        "Miles: The easiest way -- the best way to get over somebody is to fall in love with someone else.",

        "Jessica: [As Tess] You want proof?",
        "Jared: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Here you go. Go get yourself a D.N.A. test. But, oh -- be careful, because they're not always foolproof.",
        "Jared: That's cute. Why are you doing this?",
        "Jessica: Because it's worth the risk. Do you know that I can go the rest of my life living the cushy life of Jessica Buchanan? But the thought of making fools out of those jackasses is just -- it's enticing to me.",
        "Jared: Okay. Now I'm listening. So what's your plan?",
        "Jessica: Okay. So, the next board meeting for Buchanan Enterprises is soon, right?",
        "Jared: A couple of days.",
        "Jessica: Okay. All you have to do is present your plan. Say that you want to sell Nash's little love child, this great factory that's passing as a vineyard to Buchanan Enterprises.",
        "Jared: And where do you come in?",
        "Jessica: Well, I will be sitting there with a sweet little Jessica smile on my face. And when the vote comes around to my part of the table, I will say a resounding \"yea\" for the sale of the vineyard to B.E. enterprises, and then you will know Tess is back in town.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know what? You're right, Miles. I mean, why didn't I think of this myself? Fall in love with someone else, because there's just so many fabulous single men just waiting to be snatched up.",
        "Miles: Well, why don't you go in online? To one of those dating sites?",
        "Natalie: You are kidding?",
        "Miles: What? Everyone's doing it.",
        "Natalie: Okay, I'm not that desperate -- yet. No, I just -- I got to -- I got to figure out a way to get Jared out of my head, that's it, you know? I wonder if maybe my brother-in-law was right, you know? Maybe -- maybe somehow, Jared manufactured the whole D.N.A. test and the whole discovery about him being Grandpa's son -- that it's all a fraud. Except --",
        "Miles: Except what?",
        "Natalie: Well, if Jared's conning everyone, that means he made a choice to hurt me. If he did that, I could never forgive him.",

        "Jared: No, because your plan's a dud.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Jared: What good's your one vote unless the board at B.E. goes along with it? And let me remind you that right now, your annoying husband is running around this town campaigning against me.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Jared, Jared, Jared --",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, you are right about one thing. He is annoying -- my husband, that is. And that's why nobody listens to him. Good thing Jessica isn't. She actually -- she's quite the opposite. She's charming, sweet, and persuasive, especially when it comes to her daddy. Yeah, yeah, she's got Clint Buchanan wrapped around her little finger. Actually, she has all the men in the Buchanan family wrapped around her little finger. Mm-hmm. And when she speaks, let me tell you, those losers hang on to her every insincere word.",
        "Jared: She always gets what she wants, does she?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm, and then some. So all I have to do is state my case, and they will all --",

        "Adriana: I'm not insulted, Rex, I'm panic-stricken! And not just because of what the police might do. What about Blair and Todd? Those two will seek revenge on anyone who so looks at them cross-eyed! What are they going to do to me when they find out that I've been screwing with their lives?",

        "Rex: Okay -- even better -- the -- the cleanest, easiest thing to do is -- is just deny it. There's no proof, right? And if it's your word against Blair's, then who --",

        "Charlie: Well, there's not much to say, except she's smart, beautiful, and a lot of fun.",

        "Charlie: Well, wait. Why would you doubt that?",
        "Dorian: I just tend to think that first impressions can be very deceiving. And isn't it better to let relationships develop slowly?",
