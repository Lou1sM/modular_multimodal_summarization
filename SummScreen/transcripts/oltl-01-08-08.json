        "Jessica: Well, your timing was perfect, because I was just about to strangle that guy.",
        "Nash: Really? Answer the question, Jessica. Were you pretending to be Tess?",
        "Jessica: Lighten up, Nash.",
        "Nash: No, I won't \"lighten up,\" Jessica. I went on and on and on about how dangerous I think this is.",
        "Jessica: Tess can do what no one else can. She can expose Jared for who he really is, and that way, we can get him out of the family and out of Buchanan Enterprises, not to mention the fact that my sister can finally stop obsessing over this stupid jerk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Thank you.",
        "Roxy: All right, I knew it.",
        "Natalie: Roxy.",
        "Roxy: \"Oh, no, don't worry about anything, Roxy. Miles and me are just good friends.\"",
        "Miles: Rox --",
        "Roxy: Don't even think that you can deny it. You dumped me because of her. My own kid stole you away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I can't do this. I can't get my mother involved.",
        "Rex: Then you're obviously comfortable with the whole jail thing.",
        "Adriana: No, of course I'm not. I'm terrified, but if Blair wants to tell the police that I knew all along about Tommy --",
        "Rex: Look, she won't -- not if Dorian backs us up and talks her out of it. It's our best hope right now.",
        "Adriana: Wait, no, not yet.",
        "Rex: What now?",
        "Adriana: Well, the -- what about the other news we have? The good news -- us getting married?",
        "Rex: What about it?",
        "Adriana: Well, shouldn't we wait for a better time?",
        "Rex: I thought you were all gung-ho to tell her about it.",
        "Adriana: I was. I am. I -- I mean, it'll be fine, right? She gave you her blessing, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Dorian, thank you. That's very generous, but --",
        "Dorian: \"But\" nothing. We've got this thing settled.",
        "Charlie: I told you that I would stay for a couple of nights, but after that --",
        "Dorian: What are you going to do? Go check into some dark, airless room in a dingy motel? Charlie, I just love having a house full of people. And I promise you, I'm going to take very good care of you for your -- um -- I'm sorry, what was her name?",
        "Charlie: Viki.",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Viki. Ha.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "John: Come on, Marcie, you don't want to do this. Let her go, we'll talk this out.",
        "Marcie: There is nothing to talk about, John. So back off, or I'll shoot her!",
        "John: Come on, Marcie, you're not going to shoot her.",
        "Todd: The hell she won't. She's out of her mind. Where's my son?",
        "Marcie: Tommy is fine.",
        "Todd: Actually, his name is Sam now.",
        "Marcie: I don't want to shoot anyone, Todd. I don't want to shoot Viki, but I swear to you, I will shoot her.",
        "John: And then what? What are you going to do? You think you're just going to walk on out of here? You won't get 100 yards from the diner.",
        "Marcie: All right, that's it! Get back! Get away from the door, now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: My own daughter, no less, knowing that I am crazy about the guy, has to shake her maracas right in his face!",
        "Natalie: Okay, Roxy, will you just listen to me? I did not betray you. Miles and I are just friends.",
        "Roxy: You know what a fool I feel like? I came over here because I wanted to say that I was sorry because I was so mean to you, and I thought, you know, maybe we could do community service again. But now, I don't know about that.",
        "Miles: Wait, you don't know about what? Rox, Natalie was giving me a kiss goodbye.",
        "Natalie: On the cheek.",
        "Roxy: If I hadn't come in here, that big mouth of yours would have slid from his cheek to God knows where.",
        "Natalie: Roxy!",
        "Roxy: You're in love with him. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Natalie: That's just crazy! I can't be in love with Miles when I'm in love with someone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You know, I got an idea. From now on, why don't you just leave me out of it? Make your own damn decisions!",
        "Jessica: Oh, Nash, stop it. You know I think your opinion is really important and --",
        "Nash: Oh, my opinion is important to you? It's so important to you that you just outright ignored it. I asked you not to do something. I asked you not to do something that not only directly affects me and my business, but it jeopardizes your health.",
        "Jessica: Nash, I never promised that I would not try this plan on Jared, and I didn't plan for it to happen -- the opportunity just presented itself to me!",
        "Nash: \"The opportunity presented itself to you\"? I suppose you just happened to put that dress on today and put that beautiful makeup on.",
        "Jessica: Okay, I will admit it. I look like Tess, but that was just to -- that was just to get the feeling of it, okay? And then once you said that you weren't really into this plan, I -- I decided to drop it. But -- but then Jared came back when you were gone. He came back to get his folder.",
        "Nash: So you just came on to him?",
        "Jessica: No, I didn't! Jared kept on going on about Tess and how she was the reason that he was in town, and this horrible plan that he has for the sale of the vineyard to B.E., and he was just so arrogant and smug about how he was going to convince all the board members. I just -- I just couldn't take it anymore!",
        "Nash: But Tess could take it, right? I'll bet she was just swell with the whole thing.",
        "Jessica: Yes, okay? I told -- Tess told him that she would help him.",
        "Nash: Wow, did he buy that?",
        "Jessica: Well, I think so. Nash, I can use Tess to expose Jared for the fraud that he really is.",
        "Nash: Unless he figures out what a total fraud you are first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: And I am going to put you in the large guest suite --",
        "Charlie: Oh --",
        "Dorian: With the balcony overlooking --",
        "Charlie: But I just don't need a big room like that.",
        "Dorian: Nonsense. Come, let me show it to you.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Dorian: Oh, excuse me one moment.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Adriana: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Come on in, Adriana, Rex. My goodness, it -- isn't it a bit late for a visit?",
        "Adriana: I know. We were going to wait till the morning, but we really wanted to tell you about -- well --",
        "Dorian: You got engaged.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, we did.",
        "Rex: And you're overjoyed. I mean, look at that huge smile that's about to break out on your face. Or maybe not.",
        "Dorian: I did know about it, but still, it's -- well, it's rather startling.",
        "Rex: You did give me your blessing, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Yes, I did.",
        "Adriana: So are you going to congratulate us, or what?",
        "Dorian: I believe that it's proper to -- um -- give the bride best wishes, sweetheart, and congratulate the prospective groom. Hmm. So, now let me see the ring. I want you to take off that glove and show it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Thank God he's asleep.",
        "Viki: Marcie -- Marcie, I've known you a very long time, and what you're doing now -- this -- this -- this gun -- this is not who you are.",
        "Marcie: Well, it's who I am now, Viki. The old Marcie -- she was a fool. She believed in honesty and in love. And the only person who has ever shown me love or honesty is that little boy over there. Everyone else has lied to me, including you! You were here for a trap, weren't you?",
        "Viki: Marcie, no! Listen to me. I have been in Paris, Texas, for months, long before Gigi ever came in and told me she had a \"friend.\" I didn't know that you were Sally Ann. I didn't even know that Tommy was Todd's son until I spoke with Todd a few weeks ago. And this -- this meeting between us here today is purely by chance. But what happens now is up to you. Look, you can get out of this. I can help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Rex: The ring, though exquisite, is temporary.",
        "Adriana: But I really love it, and I'm starting to think I might not even want to replace it.",
        "Rex: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: You're joking, right? I mean, you surely are not going to wear this dime-store ring for much longer?",
        "Adriana: I'm starting to feel really attached to it.",
        "Rex: I actually bought your daughter a genuine diamond, but --",
        "Dorian: \"But,\" uh --",
        "Rex: Uh -- but -- tell her, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Well, the ring was part of a police investigation --",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Adriana: And actually, that's the other thing. It all ties in to Marcie being on the run with Tommy.",
        "Dorian: What? What? Really, you've got my head spinning.",
        "Adriana: Look, Mom, that blurt I made on Christmas when I told Blair that I had known about Tommy all along --",
        "Dorian: Yes, and we're going to have to talk about that, just not now.",
        "Adriana: Mom, it's really important.",
        "Dorian: I have company.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Dorian: I'll introduce you to him. Come on in. Come, come, come. Oh, Charlie, I would like to introduce you to my beautiful daughter Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Hi.",
        "Dorian: And --",
        "Rex: Fianc\u00e9, Rex.",
        "Charlie: Oh. Hi, I'm Charlie -- ahem -- ah. Pardon me, I'm -- um -- Balsom. Charlie Balsom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: All right, just for starters, what about when Jared catches on to you?",
        "Jessica: How?",
        "Nash: \"How?\" I don't know how Jared managed to worm his way into the Buchanan family, but he did. He's going to figure this out, and when he does, he's going to use it to his advantage. He will use it to finally pay you back for all the years he spent in jail!",
        "Jessica: Nash, Jared Buchanan is not interested in wasting his time and energy on getting revenge. Jared Banks was.",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Jessica: But this guy -- all he cares about is money and power, and that's why he was so enthralled when I told him that I would give him my vote for the sale of the vineyard.",
        "Nash: You did what?",
        "Jessica: And -- and wait. Before you get upset -- I am not putting our future in jeopardy.",
        "Nash: Oh, my -- you just did!",
        "Jessica: No. Nash, it's not going to make it to the vote, okay? Way before then, I'm going to have Jared wrapped around my little finger, and -- and I'm going to be able to find out how he got around the D.N.A. test and expose him for the fraud he really is!",
        "Nash: You hope.",
        "Jessica: I know. Nash, you should've seen the dollar signs popping out of his eyes when Tess told him that she would help him get what he wanted.",
        "Nash: Except Tess didn't tell him that. You did.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Whatever. What's your point?",
        "Nash: Look at you - you're getting off on this. You -- you're all excited by being Tess, and that scares the hell out of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You can't help me, Viki. You're just saying that.",
        "Viki: What you have just done -- taking me hostage, pointing a gun at me -- that's made things a lot worse for you. But I can see to it that no charges are brought against you for that. I will talk to John, I will talk to Todd, and I will explain to them that --",
        "Marcie: Explain what? Viki, they don't understand, okay, and they never will! They won't!",
        "Viki: What is it they don't understand? That you're trying to protect your son by waving a gun around?",
        "Marcie: I am protecting him! I would never hurt my son in a million years, and the only person that is going to be hurt is you if you just don't shut up and just let me think! Viki, I need to think!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Wait a minute. Who are you calling?",
        "Todd: The cops. I'm going to get a swat team in there.",
        "John: Oh, yeah, when I was calling for backup earlier, it didn't make sense. Now it does?",
        "Todd: None of this makes sense. My kid and my sister in a diner being held hostage by a crazy woman with nothing to lose.",
        "John: She's got everything to lose. That little boy means the whole world to her. Look, give me the phone, all right? Please? I'm going to talk her out of there before we get anyone else involved and all hell breaks loose.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Viki: Marcie, I think you should answer that.",
        "John: Marcie? Look, I know you're in there. Do not hang up on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Did you say your name's Balsom?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, why?",
        "Rex: That's my name.",
        "Charlie: Really?",
        "Rex: Yep. S-o-m?",
        "Charlie: S-o-M. Small world, huh? Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Yes, it certainly is.",
        "Adriana: Hey, maybe you two are distant cousins.",
        "Rex: Uh -- it's possible. Uh -- Walter Balsom? Corinne? Those names mean anything to you?",
        "Charlie: No, I don't think so. But you know something? I really should get going, so --",
        "Dorian: No! No, Charlie, you are staying here.",
        "Charlie: Dorian, I can't. I --",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. You're staying here. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to open a bottle of my very best champagne and propose a toast to your engagement. Do not let that man leave.",
        "Charlie: Well -- I --",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Rex: So, Charlie, where are you from?",
        "Charlie: Out west.",
        "Adriana: Maybe there's a whole wing of Balsoms out there.",
        "Rex: Hmm.",
        "Charlie: Well, I don't know. You know, it's not necessarily the same Balsom. It's a relatively common name.",
        "Adriana: So Mom says you're staying here.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, she's very kind, very generous, but I -- you know, I don't want to intrude. I'm just going to find myself a little hotel.",
        "Adriana: Oh, well, how about the Angel Square? You know, Rex's mom runs it. She could probably give you a good deal.",
        "Charlie: Oh. The Angel Square? Yeah -- um -- yeah, I do -- I do know of that, yeah.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Well, did -- maybe you met her. Her name is Roxy.",
        "Charlie: Roxy? No, I don't think I've met her.",
        "Rex: Hmm. You haven't. If you had, you sure as hell would remember.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Out of the blue you lay this on me? You never even mentioned that you were seeing someone, never mind loving them.",
        "Natalie: First of all, I wouldn't tell you anything that I don't want all over a billboard. And secondly, I said that I was in love with him, which is kind of an overstatement, you know? I had feelings for the g -- the point is, I was saying it so that you realize I did not come on to Miles.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, Miles was coming on to you.",
        "Natalie: No! No one was coming on to anyone! Miles and I -- we are friends, end of story!",
        "Roxy: All right, well, why don't you tell me about this other story, then? Who's the guy that you got the hots for?",
        "Natalie: Well, that story is over, as well. In fact, it was finished before it ever started.",
        "Roxy: Well, maybe according to your brain. But I'm looking at your face, and your heart ain't listening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Right. Right, and I did it for kicks, you know, because pretending to be Tess brings back such fond memories.",
        "Nash: Oh -- did you enjoy it?",
        "Jessica: I enjoyed doing something to help this family, yes.",
        "Nash: You got no satisfaction in talking like Tess or flirting like Tess?",
        "Jessica: Don't accuse me of flirting!",
        "Nash: You're doing your version of Tess! Somehow, I suspect you weren't quoting scripture.",
        "Jessica: You know what I find really infuriating about this whole thing?",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Jessica: Is that you're talking about Tess like she's some alien that -- that took over my body. Need I remind you, Nash, that I am both Jessica and Tess? And the sum total of those two women make up the woman that loves you and the woman that you love back.",
        "Nash: Well, can you guarantee me that Tess won't take over, and our daughter won't lose her mother again?",
        "Jessica: I am not playing games here, okay? Jared wormed his way into my family, our family, and he is trying to take away my grandfather's legacy. He is doing everything that he can to do that. So if anybody's playing games here, it's Jared. Not to mention, breaking my sister's heart.",
        "Nash: Your sister's better off without him.",
        "Jessica: So are we all, Nash. That is why I will do anything, including using the Tess in me to get Jared out of our lives!",
        "Nash: I won't. I am not willing to do anything. I'm not willing to risk losing my wife again to get rid of \"Jared Buchanan.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Listen to me. A lot of people know where you are, not just me and Manning. The F.B.I. are going to find you, Marcie. And taking a hostage -- you just made things worse for yourself. So why don't you give yourself up, all right? Let's not get anyone else involved, and we can help you.",
        "Todd: What about my sister and kid? Who's helping them?",
        "John: Listen, Marcie, I want to speak to Mrs. Davidson.",
        "Marcie: Why?",
        "John: I want to know that she's all right.",
        "Viki: John?",
        "John: Hey, Viki, how a you?",
        "Viki: I'm fine. I'm not hurt.",
        "John: How's Tommy?",
        "Todd: Sam.",
        "Viki: The baby's fine, the baby's fine.",
        "Marcie: All right, hurry up. Hurry up.",
        "John: Ms. Davidson, do you think Marcie could pull the trigger?",
        "Marcie: All right, that's it. Come on, time's up. That's it. Hand me the phone. She said she was okay. You heard her.",
        "John: That's good. You don't want anyone to get hurt, do you? Marcie, you still there? Marcie?",
        "Todd: Listen to me, you crazy bitch! You hurt my sister or Sam, I'm going to kill you!",
        "Marcie: His name is Tommy!",
        "John: Marcie?",
        "John: What's the matter with you?",
        "Todd: Let me try her again.",
        "John: Oh, you think she's going to answer us after you scared the hell out of her? God.",
        "Todd: I don't know what you expect me to do, man. Stand here and do nothing while you coddle her? While she's got my sister and my kid at gunpoint?",
        "John: Go ahead, knock yourself out. She's not going to talk to us.",
        "Todd: All right. I'll call the cops.",
        "Todd: Cops and F.B.I. are on their way.",
        "John: Good. Now, give me the gun.",
        "Todd: You're kidding.",
        "John: Give it to me. Or I'll have the cops take it from you when they get here and once they find out you've got an unregistered concealed weapon on you, you'll be thrown in a jail cell so fast it'll make your head spin. Give it to me. Thank you. Now, may I borrow your phone? May I borrow your phone?",
        "Todd: Sure. Want my wallet?",
        "John: Later.",
        "Todd: How about my pants?",
        "John: I don't like polyester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Don't you worry, baby, okay? You and Mommy -- we are going to be just fine. We're going to get back on that road again real soon, too, okay?",
        "Viki: You must be so tired. Do you want some coffee?",
        "Marcie: Yes, please. Don't try anything, though, because I will be watching you.",
        "Viki: I'm -- I'm actually just going to get my sweater. I'm a little chilled, okay?",
        "Viki: So, uh, where are you planning to go?",
        "Marcie: Why would I tell you that?",
        "Viki: Out of the country, I assume, right? Mexico? Do you speak Spanish? Well, I suppose you'll learn. Your brothers must be very worried about you. I -- I know your brother Ron. I -- I've never met the other two. You have two others, right? Yeah. Must have been hard for them, not having you around at Christmas. And your father -- how is your father?",
        "Marcie: Just stop it. Okay? I know what you're trying to do and it's not going to work.",
        "Viki: I'm making conversation, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: You were trying to remind me of what I've left behind, like I don't -- like I don't think about that, Viki, every minute of every day of my life, but it is not enough. It is not enough for me to give up my child, okay? I will never --",

        "Adriana: And now, there's this whole other branch of genealogy where you can trace your ancestors using D.N.A. -- oh.",
        "Dorian: Rex? Here you go.",
        "Rex: Oh -- hmm.",
        "Dorian: Adriana?",
        "Adriana: Thank you. So, you know, maybe you guys have ancestors in common.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. Charlie?",
        "Charlie: Well, no, none for me.",
        "Dorian: Oh. All right, well, why don't I just pour you a nice sparkling water?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.",
        "Rex: So, pretty soon, three of us in this room are going to have the same last name.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Rex: Fascinating observation, huh?",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Well, maybe not. It may just be that two of you have the same last name. After all, Adriana may choose to keep her own name, the fiercely independent young woman that she is.",
        "Adriana: Um, actually, I haven't really decided. You know what -- maybe I'll do the hyphenated thing.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Well -- well, it's certainly something that we can talk about tomorrow. All right, I would like to propose a toast to my beautiful daughter Adriana and to Rex, her fianc\u00e9. May they have everything I could possibly wish for them.",
