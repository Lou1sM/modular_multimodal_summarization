        "T\u00e9a: Viki.",
        "Viki: Hello, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: I've been so buried in my work, I wouldn't even notice an earthquake. I didn't see you. How are you?",
        "Viki: Todd's case?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, yes. It is so good to see you.",
        "Viki: You know, T\u00e9a, I wish I could say the same. What are you doing? Why are you helping Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You too cool for school now?",
        "Cole: I didn't get much sleep last night. I'll go in later.",
        "John: Come on, you don't want to be hanging around here. I'll give you a ride.",
        "Cole: John, just tell me what happened to my mom.",
        "John: She's fine.",
        "Cole: You didn't answer my question.",
        "John: Look, I think she had a rough night. And now's probably not the best time to be interrogating her.",
        "Cole: Yeah, when will be a good time? Sometime next year?",
        "John: I'm sure she'll tell you everything you need to know when she's ready.",
        "Cole: Yeah, like I can even ask her. Seeing as how I have no idea where she is. Do you even know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Come on in. Glad you're here. We have a lot to talk about. Make me remember all the terrible things you did to me. Please. Make me forget how I fell in love with you. I don't think so. You thought the woman you raped could actually love you.",
        "Todd: It was all a lie.",
        "Marty: Go ahead. Jump. It's your one chance to be selfless. Do it for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Why am I helping Todd?",
        "Viki: Yes. I'd like to know.",
        "T\u00e9a: Here, sit down. Let me clear --",
        "Viki: No, I'm not staying. I'm actually meeting someone.",
        "T\u00e9a: No time for a croissant between former sisters-in-law?",
        "Viki: I'd prefer an answer.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm defending Todd because I'm his lawyer.",
        "Viki: You're his lawyer, T\u00e9a, because you appointed yourself his lawyer.",
        "T\u00e9a: Must've read that in \"The Banner\" since I didn't see you in court.",
        "Viki: You're right. I was not in court.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh. So maybe the question isn't why am I helping Todd, but why aren't you, his sister, helping him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hey, so what do you have next, Spanish?",
        "Starr: Econ.",
        "Langston: How's it going so far?",
        "Starr: Okay, ready? I found out that Greg gave Monica an std.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? I heard it was just mono.",
        "Starr: Uh-uh. Oh, and there was a pop quiz on Othello in the other section of A.P.",
        "Langston: God. So no one's said anything about you being pregnant?",
        "Starr: Negative.",
        "Langston: Well, maybe things are going back to normal.",
        "Starr: Just wait until I see Cole.",
        "Langston: What happened with his mom on New Year's?",
        "Starr: I don't know. I was waiting for him by his locker this morning, and he never came around.",
        "Langston: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.",
        "Starr: My mom made waffles.",
        "Langston: And I missed it for model U.N.?",
        "Starr: Yeah, but whenever something happens, she decides that we should all have a family breakfast.",
        "Langston: Did she say anything?",
        "Starr: Nothing. But how much you want to bet that it's going to be about my dad and Cole's mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, God.",
        "Blair: Were you asleep?",
        "Todd: Well, no. I wasn't asleep. What do you want?",
        "Blair: I wanted to see if you were all right.",
        "Todd: Well, I'm alive. No thanks to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, I meant to tell you. I'm sorry I put you in a compromissionary position.",
        "Charlie: Uh, what?",
        "Roxy: You know, when I told Natty that you and Viki were getting hitched?",
        "Charlie: Oh, that, yeah. No, we didn't mind that.",
        "Roxy: Just so you know, Viki's clock is tocking.",
        "Charlie: What clock is that?",
        "Roxy: That's the clock that goes when you're fake engaged to wanting to be really engaged.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well --",
        "Roxy: So when are you going to pop the question?",
        "Natalie: Charlie, have you met Chloe?",
        "Charlie: Oh. Hey, Chloe, baby. What -- do you got your Aunt Natalie out for lunch today?",
        "Natalie: Well, actually, Jared called me from B.E., and he said that he was jonesing for a burger, so --",
        "Charlie: Is -- Jared's back at B.E.?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Dad hired him back this morning.",
        "Charlie: Well, don't let him work too hard.",
        "Roxy: Hey, no offense or nothing, but he's got to provide for my kiddo here.",
        "Natalie: Your kiddo here can provide for herself.",
        "Roxy: So when's my baby girl going to have a baby?",
        "Natalie: A what?",
        "Roxy: Because I hate to admit this, but my clock is rocking also. I want another grandkid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Why am I not supporting Todd?",
        "T\u00e9a: You always have. No matter what he did or who he hurt.",
        "Viki: Why did you marry him?",
        "T\u00e9a: Excuse me?",
        "Viki: It wasn't just the $5 million, was it?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, it wasn't just the $5 million. I suppose we had a connection. We were both abandoned by our mothers. Both find it hard to trust people. And we both cared a great deal about Starr.",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a, he's not that man anymore.",
        "T\u00e9a: I beg to differ that he is exactly that man. In a tremendous amount of pain, lashing out at whoever and whatever hurts him.",
        "Viki: Well, then fine. Maybe it's not what Todd has done. Maybe it's the people he has done it to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, I saw your mom. She wants to be alone.",
        "Cole: So what? You let her?",
        "John: Cole, I'm walking a fine line here, all right? She's an adult.",
        "Cole: She's messed up. You saw that stuff about Todd that she's been hiding.",
        "John: She needs time.",
        "Cole: What if she tries to do something to him, like revenge or something, and ends up hurting herself?",
        "John: Between you and me, a guy I used to work with, he's keeping an eye on manning. If anything happens, I think we'll know about it.",
        "Cole: By then, it might be too late.",
        "John: I'm not sure we have to worry about it so much.",
        "Cole: Why not?",
        "John: I think your mom's had enough of Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Oh. What happened? Who the hell are you?",
        "Blair: Yes, I did save your life. The least you can do is let me in.",
        "Todd: You took a CPR class at the rec center. What do you want, a medal?",
        "Blair: I brought you some muffins. You want blueberry or --",
        "Todd: You brought muffins?",
        "Blair: Cranberry, yes.",
        "Todd: Oh, wow. I hate muffins.",
        "Blair: This is a new level of ungrateful, even for you, Todd.",
        "Todd: Thank you for bringing muffins, Blair.",
        "Blair: That's not what I meant, Todd.",
        "Todd: Thank you for taking the CPR class. Thank you for saving my poor pathetic life, Blair. When all I and Marty wanted to do was end it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Why don't you think my mom would try anything on Todd?",
        "John: We don't need to get into all that.",
        "Cole: I thought you were always straight with me.",
        "John: I'm trying, Cole. I'm telling you everything you need to know.",
        "Cole: You're really not going to tell me where she is?",
        "John: I'll let her talk to you about it, okay?",
        "Cole: Yeah, okay.",
        "John: Come on. You want a ride or not?",
        "Cole: What's the point? It's not like I'll be able to study. I'll be worried about my mom the whole time.",
        "John: I know. But you know, by the time you're home, she'll be back, and she'll tell you everything that happened.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I won't hold my breath.",
        "John: She loves you. No matter what her problems are, that doesn't change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: I'm Wes Granger.",
        "Marty: Uh, that's supposed to mean something to me?",
        "Wes: You jumped on my bike last night? Said you didn't want to go home, so you crashed here.",
        "Marty: I -- Angel Square.",
        "Wes: Want a coffee?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Wes: I'd take you to breakfast, but I got to get to work.",
        "Marty: Oh, no, that's okay. I don't think I could eat anything.",
        "Wes: You okay?",
        "Marty: Yeah, I'm fine. I will be. It's just -- sorry about swearing at you. I have a memory problem.",
        "Wes: After last night, I don't blame you.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I definitely won't forget last night. Whoo! This is it?",
        "Wes: This is it. I'm just crashing here while my buddy's sick.",
        "Marty: I like it.",
        "Wes: Thanks.",
        "Marty: You going to give me a tour?",
        "Wes: Uh, yeah. Okay, well, that's the bed. And that's the dresser.",
        "Marty: Oh, yeah. We need a stereo. We need music.",
        "Wes: Oh, no music.",
        "Marty: What?",
        "Wes: No liquor and no parties.",
        "Marty: Oh, God. No parties.",
        "Wes: The owner of the place hates them. Unless she's invited.",
        "Marty: See, I love parties.",
        "Wes: You know, I kind of got that feeling.",
        "Marty: Yeah, it's my middle name. Marty \"the party girl\" Saybrooke.",
        "Wes: Good nickname.",
        "Marty: Uh, yeah. Some guy I know called me that. At least that's what they tell me. But he knows better than to call me that anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You actually wanted to jump off that building?",
        "Todd: That's very good, Blair.",
        "Blair: You wanted to actually kill yourself?",
        "Todd: Let's you and I share a muffin together.",
        "Blair: No. You know, you wouldn't do that, Todd.",
        "Todd: You're right, I hate breakfast.",
        "Blair: You wouldn't commit suicide.",
        "Todd: Because I'm too much of a coward, right?",
        "Blair: Because when John pulled you out of the water, you had a tuxedo on.",
        "Todd: What the hell difference does that make?",
        "Blair: You wouldn't dress up to kill yourself. Oh, God, you did it for Marty. You walked off that roof for Marty Saybrooke because you're trying to make up for everything that you did to her. God, how did she do that? How did she talk you into walking off that roof? And why do you give her so much power over your life, even more than your own children?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're right. I have always stood by Todd. Even when he hurt members of my own family. And you know, my son Kevin never understood that. He actually thought that I favored Todd over him, over my own children.",
        "T\u00e9a: I remember that.",
        "Viki: And I did it because I understood what made Todd the way he was. We shared a monstrous father. And whatever pain Todd felt -- I mean, I got it. I shared it with him.",
        "T\u00e9a: And that meant the world to him, that no matter what, you always stood by him.",
        "Viki: Yeah, and I forgave him until last summer. Last summer, my daughter Jessica had a complete breakdown. Todd knew it. He did nothing to help her, and he said nothing about it. He allowed her to hold her own sister prisoner. She was going to kill Natalie. And then he held his rape victim hostage for no other reason other than to feed is own insane fantasy. And that's when I decided that forgiveness is not necessarily a good thing for Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair had taken his kids away. He was out of his mind, Viki.",
        "Viki: Do you know why? Do you know why? He took Sam and put him in the front seat of his car. No car seat, no child seat, and then went and got into an accident. An accident that could have killed Sam.",
        "T\u00e9a: But if it was an accident, accidents --",
        "Viki: And he had a huge fight with Starr that resulted in her falling down an entire flight of stairs. He brutalized her boyfriend, Marty's son.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. If I know Todd, and I think I do, he probably thought he was trying to protect Starr.",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a. That's a very odd, violent way to go about it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, it is. He's always had a blind spot when it comes to Starr. You know he loves her more than anything else in the world.",
        "Viki: I used to think that. I don't anymore. I don't think he remembers how to be a father. I think all he knows now is how to dole out pain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: The kids don't want me.",
        "Blair: Of course they do.",
        "Todd: You won't let them see me. Of course, they're not fighting you on it either.",
        "Blair: They still need you to be their father. The one that you could be.",
        "Todd: Would you give me a break with that? My God, what's the first thing you always said when we had a fight? \"I'm taking the kids, Todd. Don't expect to see them again.\"",
        "Marty: Well, and the court made it very clear how you could get them back.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes. I'll be a good little boy.",
        "Blair: No, you could be a grown up, Todd. All of this could be different if you just act like a grown up.",
        "Todd: I'm a grown up.",
        "Blair: You are not a grown up. You run away. You run away, just like you always --",
        "Todd: I'm still sitting here, aren't I?",
        "Blair: You know, you didn't have to leave town this time. You just went off in that stupid little fantasy land you have --",
        "Todd: It's not a fantasy.",
        "Blair: It is --",
        "Todd: It wasn't a fantasy.",
        "Blair: Yes, it was.",
        "Todd: I loved her.",
        "Blair: Oh, don't make me puke.",
        "Todd: It's true.",
        "Blair: You don't love her, Todd. You don't love her. You never did, and you never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, you guys.",
        "Langston: We didn't think you were coming in today.",
        "Starr: Did you find out about your mom?",
        "Cole: John told me that he found her last night. She's okay.",
        "Langston: Well, that's good, right?",
        "Cole: Yeah. I mean, she's still not home. John won't tell me anything else.",
        "Starr: You know what? My mom seemed like she knew something this morning.",
        "Cole: Did she tell you what happened?",
        "Starr: No, she just made me waffles and told me that everything was fine.",
        "Cole: It's nice how they have so much faith in us, right?",
        "Starr: If I find out anything, I'll let you know.",
        "Cole: Me, too.",
        "Langston: Me, too. Even though I'm not really involved at all, but --",
        "Starr: Langston, you're involved enough.",
        "Cole: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Langston: I'm going to go get my trig notes.",
        "Starr: Wait, you found them?",
        "Langston: Markko had them in his locker the whole time.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: See you later.",
        "Cole: See you.",
        "Cole: So how's your first day back been?",
        "Starr: Pretty okay. No one has said anything yet.",
        "Cole: It's kind of weird, right? Having to worry about stuff like homework again.",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "Katie: Hey, you guys. Congratulations. Was it a boy or a girl?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Are you Luisa?",
        "Luisa: Yes, that's me.",
        "John: Hi, I'm John McBain. Detective Vega gave me your name. Did you happen to see this woman last night?",
        "Luisa: She was outside by the statue.",
        "John: Did you see where she went?",
        "Luisa: She drove off with some guy on a motorcycle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: Kind of tame, huh?",
        "Marty: What do you mean?",
        "Wes: For a party girl. Next time we should go somewhere else. I mean, there's only so much we can do here, right?",
        "Marty: In fact, Mr. Granger, I just came from a party.",
        "Wes: I'm sorry I missed it.",
        "Marty: Oh, yeah. Oh, you would have loved it. It was a blast. There were candles and champagne, bubbly champagne, and there was fireworks.",
        "Wes: What was it? The New Year's special at Genoese's Italian?",
        "Marty: Oh, no, no, no. This was the Palace Hotel. I haven't even told you the best part yet.",
        "Wes: What's that?",
        "Marty: My date. He jumped off the roof.",
        "Wes: What?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "Wes: Was he high?",
        "Marty: For a second.",
        "Wes: No, no, no, I mean --",
        "Marty: Seven stories, whoo! All the way down.",
        "Wes: Are you okay?",
        "Marty: I'm fine. Fantastic. Can't you tell?",
        "Wes: Should I take you to a hospital?",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "Wes: So he --",
        "Marty: He lived. God. You can't kill the guy. You cannot kill the guy if he doesn't want to die.",
        "Wes: You're kidding.",
        "Marty: No, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. You can't kill the guy.",
        "Wes: So why'd he do it?",
        "Marty: I -- because I told him to.",
        "Wes: You're just yanking my chain now, aren't you?",
        "Marty: He deserved it, trust me. He got off easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: How the hell would you know that I don't love Marty?",
        "Blair: Because you can't.",
        "Todd: Isn't that what you always said when we first got together? That I was in love with her?",
        "Blair: Well, now I've seen the light. Because -- yeah. Because you only love people who don't want you to change.",
        "Todd: You're right. Marty doesn't want me to change.",
        "Blair: Right. Right, she loves the real you. The real Todd Manning. Her knight in shining armor who's saving her from the evil, dark John McBain.",
        "Todd: Why is there a problem with that?",
        "Blair: Because it's a lie.",
        "Todd: No, no. She believed that's who I really was.",
        "Blair: Well, did you ever stop and think maybe that was wrong?",
        "Marty: You're making up for it now. Done a lot for me. You know, you deserve to be happy.",
        "Todd: She and I were living in the present tense. Not in the past.",
        "Blair: Todd, Marty loved you, only because she couldn't remember the past. Now what about the people that knew your past and loved you anyway? Wasn't that important? Because it wasn't easy. You had to fight for their love. My love, Starr's, Viki's. Hell, even T\u00e9a's. And you loved her. And don't tell me she didn't make you work for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I'm not going to defend things Todd allegedly did when I wasn't here.",
        "Viki: Then you're looking at him with blinders on. Those incidents with Sam and Starr directly led to him losing custody of the children.",
        "T\u00e9a: That may be true. But are you going to stand there and tell me that you honestly don't think he loves his children?",
        "Viki: Todd doesn't have a clue what love is.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. Then doesn't it stand to reason that if he is hurting his own children, if he is ready to leave them, then something must be horribly, horribly wrong?",
        "Viki: Yes, something is horribly wrong.",
        "T\u00e9a: Viki, he needs you to forgive him.",
        "Viki: No, T\u00e9a. I don't think he does. And you know why? Because when I look at him, I don't see it. I don't see one ounce of remorse.",
        "T\u00e9a: Viki.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: He tried to kill himself last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Did I freak you out last night?",
        "Wes: What, you mean when you said you talked some guy into take a header off the Palace Hotel?",
        "Marty: Yeah, that.",
        "Wes: No, not really. It takes a lot to freak me out. You told him to jump? And he did?",
        "Marty: Yeah, pretty much. But he lived. Some people pulled him out of the water.",
        "Wes: Sounds like you're pretty lucky.",
        "Marty: Lucky? No, I wanted him out of my life.",
        "Wes: Well, throwing him off a building's one way to do it.",
        "Marty: I wanted to erase him. I wanted to forget that I ever knew his name. You think I'm crazy, don't you?",
        "Wes: No, I get it. You're one hot, crazy chick.",
        "Marty: You're not so bad yourself.",
        "Wes: Maybe that's why you got on the bike with me.",
        "Marty: So we didn't already know each other? I'm sorry, it's just memory problems.",

        "Marty: You never joined K.A.D.?",
        "Wes: What's that?",

        "Todd: You're so melodramatic.",
        "Blair: No, and then there's Jack. Missed a goal playing soccer last week. But I have to tell him not to worry about that because you're never going to watch him play. You're not going to be there to tell him that his coach sucks and that it doesn't matter that he missed a goal. Because you couldn't even say goodbye to him.",
        "Todd: Come on.",
        "Blair: Then there's Starr. Starr asked me, you know, what about -- \"We going to ever have another family poker night? I love that, mama.\" She's distracted, or her friends are giving her a hard time at school, Todd. She picks up that deck of cards, you know. The ones you always play when we're playing poker.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "Blair: And you're cheating. You remember that deck. She looks at it, and says, \"Are things ever going to be the same?\" And I tell her, \"You know, Starr, it's okay. You don't have to be distracted because I'm there for you. I'll be there to listen to everything, always. You should know that. You should always know that. Just like your father should know that I always would've been there for him.\"",

        "Blair: I don't know. It's up to you. I can either tell them that they're not going to see you again. You may as well be dead to them. Or I can tell them that you're really trying to get better, and that someday they will see you again, and remember you for the man that you used to be, before everything went wrong.",
