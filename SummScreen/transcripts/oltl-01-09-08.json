        "Officer: Step aside, Mr. Manning, or I'll have you removed from the area.",
        "Michael: Did you ever once stop to think why Marcie and I didn't want you anywhere near Tommy? It's because of this, Todd -- because you are a stupid, selfish, reckless, jerk.",
        "Agent Sutton: Knock it off, gentlemen, or you're both out of here.",
        "John: Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Was that Michael? Is he all right?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I mean, did you see Todd and Michael going at it?",
        "Jessica: Oh -- no. Todd was crazy before Mom was even grabbed. I tried to talk to him on the phone about a story last week and he was all over the place.",
        "Natalie: Did you talk to Dad?",
        "Jessica: Well, I left a message. You know how early he goes to sleep. He wakes up so early, maybe we should just all go over there.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I think that's a great idea. Do you really think that Marcie's going to shoot Mom?",
        "Jessica: Okay, honey. Listen, Nash is putting Bree in the car, so I guess I'll see you over there, okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Has there been any more news?",
        "Rex: No, a commercial.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd, it's me and I know that you're upset, but you have got to stay calm, all right? Just call me. Call me, please. He didn't pick up.",
        "Dorian: I hope he's not strangling that reporter.",
        "Blair: Well, what'd she do now?",
        "Dorian: No, they're still on commercial break.",
        "Blair: Well, did she explain why Viki was there in the first place -- I mean, at the diner?",
        "Dorian: Hmm -- not a word, though I'm sure Viki will be happy to fill us in on all the details.",
        "Blair: Yeah, if Marcie doesn't shoot her first.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Marcie's not going to shoot her. I mean, you know, that's just something people do when they're desperate.",
        "Blair: Oh, that's right -- shoot people.",
        "Dorian: No, they say they're going to shoot people because they're that desperate, but then they -- they calm down and, you know, back down.",
        "Blair: Todd must be climbing the walls to know that his son is, like, 50 feet away from him inside that building and he can't even get to him.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. I hope there's somebody there who can calm him down.",

        "Michael: Whatever it takes, Todd.",
        "John: Look, I know you got food and water in there. You need anything else?",
        "Marcie: What I need, John, is a car and a driver and he better be unarmed.",
        "John: A car and a driver -- why? You going someplace?",
        "Marcie: I'm going to the airport, John! Okay, so I need a charter and -- and -- and the gas tank better be big enough to take us wherever I want it to take us! And -- and I need two -- two new passports and -- and the pilot needs clearance because I am not filing a flight plan -- do you hear me?",
        "John: That's not the answer, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Just do it, John! Just do it!",

        "Todd: She wants a plane?",
        "John: Can you work on the car and the driver, see about the passports?",
        "Todd: Hold on -- am I missing something? You're going to meet her demands?",
        "John: Yeah. You got a problem with that?",

        "Reporter: Reporting from here in Paris, Texas, this is Dylan Ferrera.",
        "[Rex mutes TV, sighs]",
        "Rex: They're all saying the same thing.",
        "Adriana: Well, no news is go news. Look, I don't care what Natalie said -- Marcie would never hurt anyone.",
        "Roxy: I need to get some air.",
        "Adriana: Sorry.",
        "Rex: It's not you.",
        "Adriana: Do you want the sound on?",
        "Miles: No. Turn it off.",
        "Adriana: You okay?",
        "Miles: All of this is -- Marcie on the run, Todd in Texas, Viki held hostage. It's all my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey.",
        "Roxy: Am I that bad a mother?",
        "Rex: No. No, you're a -- you're -- you're a one-of-a-kind mother, but that's good.",
        "Roxy: Nattie doesn't think so. And if Marcie has plugged Viki, what's she going to do? Because I'm going to be all that Nattie's got left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Oh -- Bree really did not want to go back down to sleep.",
        "Jessica: She must sense that there's something wrong. I'm going to go downstairs and see if there's anything new to report.",
        "Nash: Hey. Your mom is going to be okay.",
        "Jessica: What is she even doing there in the first place, Nash? I mean, why did she leave us? Why did she feel the need to go away?",
        "Nash: I don't know. I'm sure she had her reasons.",
        "Jessica: Well -- oh. I was thinking -- God. Before she went on her trip, she asked me -- she called me and she asked me if she could take Bree to the park for the day and I said no because I had this stupid play date planned and I -- I told her that we should do it some other time, and I just --",
        "Nash: I'm sure she doesn't blame you.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Maybe, I don't know. I mean, she said that she was okay with it, but I -- I just -- what if I hurt her, you know?",
        "Nash: Jessica, you are not responsible for your mom going away any more than you're responsible for what's going on now. Your mom loves you, she knows that you love her; she knows that you need her. She always has.",
        "Jessica: Well, I hope so and I hope that she's going to be okay because it's not just me that needs her, okay? It's all of us. It's Natalie, it's Bree, it's Kevin, it's Joey -- we all need her.",
        "Nash: She's important to a lot of people.",
        "Jessica: You know what I'm going to do?",
        "Nash: What are you going to do?",
        "Jessica: When she gets back, I am going to make sure that I bring Bree over all the time.",
        "Nash: All the time.",
        "Jessica: And I'm going to call her every day. I'm going to -- first thing when I wake up in the morning -- it's the first thing I'm going to do. I'm going to call her every morning.",
        "Nash: Yes, every morning, and I can just hear her now. [As Viki] \"Darling, why are you calling me every single morning? I simply don't understand. It's not necessary. Cool it.\" [Normal voice] I don't think she'd say that.",
        "Jessica: I actually think that she would. Oh, thank you.",
        "Nash: All right.",
        "[Bree cries]",
        "Jessica: Oh, oh. You know, I'll go get her.",
        "Nash: Oh -- no. You know what? I'll -- I'll go put her back down to sleep. You go back to your family.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",

        "[Dorian turns TV off]",
        "Dorian: Yeah, it's just a euphemism.",
        "Blair: What -- what is Viki doing down in Texas anyway? Todd didn't tell me she was going down there to help him find his son.",
        "Dorian: Well, I'm sure that Viki has her reasons. She always does.",

        "Michael: Are you really going to give her a plane?",
        "John: No, Mike, but we need to make her think she's making progress, all right? How we doing on that car and driver and the passports?",
        "Agent Sutton: We're working on it.",
        "Michael: Wait, and then what? Marcie's not stupid -- she'll know it's a fix.",
        "John: Mike, we don't have a lot of options. Our best shot is to make her think that, you know, we're playing along, okay? Give her time to assess her situation.",
        "Todd: And when that doesn't work?",
        "John: Hope your sister gets through to her.",
        "Viki: Is he asleep? He's a beautiful child, Marcie.",

        "Viki: I remember when my children were that age, and mom is still the center of their universe. It's so sweet, you know? They look for you in the morning, peeking over the rail of the crib and their arms are out and they're smiling. There's nothing better.",
        "Marcie: Viki? I'm his mom.",

        "Viki: Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Truly, I'm sorry. I -- I was reaching for your hand, okay? I'm so sorry. Please, Marcie? You don't want that thing to go off -- put it down, please.",
        "Marcie: I just don't -- I don't trust anybody anymore.",
        "Viki: Well, I can understand that, given what you've been through.",
        "Marcie: The thing is, you know, we've -- we've met so many terrific people. And they had no reason to help us and -- huh. But they did. You know, they took us in and they -- and they fed us and they gave us money and they -- you know, some of them even called ahead to find us a place to stay and then it was just because, just because we needed the help.",
        "Viki: Well, that's proof that angels exist. There are wonderful people in this world -- at least I've found that.",

        "Natalie: Yeah, when she was in Texas this whole time instead of France.",
        "Jessica: But why would she lie to us?",
        "Nora: Oh, I don't think she was lying. She just was protecting her privacy, that's all.",

        "Todd: Hey, Blair.",
        "Blair: Oh, Todd, thank God I got you. I've been watching this circus on television and it's crazy. Now, you've got to stay calm. Any word on Viki and the baby?",

        "Viki: Yes, of course I would and I have. But Tommy's life is not on the line. Tommy's life is not at stake here -- yours is, Marcie. You've already given up everything.",
        "Marcie: Yes, and I would do it again! I would do it again! You know, I never really knew my mom.",
        "Viki: Yes, I know that was hard for you.",

        "Viki: So are you doing this for Tommy, or for you? I know you love him, very much, and obviously you've taken very good care of him under difficult circumstances. But, Marcie, is this need of yours to provide him with you as his mother-- is that more important than Tommy's need to have a normal life?",
        "Marcie: But a normal life is what I have given him, Viki. He needs me.",

        "Jessica: Maybe I should try and reach Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I can see him, Blair. He's right there in front of me. She put him in the car seat, I saw him. I couldn't get to him because I was trapped behind this stupid fence. And then she took off, and now she's holed up in a diner with a gun.",
        "Blair: How could she take off and think she could get away with it?",
        "Todd: Oh, that idiot, Ramsey, took a shot at her -- while she was holding Sam.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, was he hurt?",
        "Todd: No, he -- I don't think so, he seemed okay. But Michael McBain showed up and jumped in front of the gun and took a bullet in the shoulder.",
        "Blair: Well, is he okay?",
        "Todd: Yeah, they patched him up okay. But he's pretty upset about all this.",
        "Blair: Well, why wouldn't he be, Todd? He doesn't want anything to happen to that boy, you know that.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. You know, for a McBain, he's okay. It's still my kid, though.",

        "Michael: This is going nowhere.",
        "John: There's not much else we can do.",
        "Michael: Yeah, there is. They can let me talk to Marcie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Of course he needs me, Viki. I'm his mother, he needs me! Do you know how much he's been through? He's already been orphaned twice. When we first got him, he didn't sleep. He didn't sleep. I -- I sat with him for hours on end, I -- I rocked him to sleep. I -- I relaxed him, I reassured him, I -- he didn't eat. Michael and I -- we had to teach him how to smile. So, yes, Viki, he needs me, he depends on me, and I'm not going to give him -- I'm not just going to hand him over to just anyone, especially Todd! I know he is your brother, but he is a terrible person, Viki!",
        "Viki: I have no doubt that he treated you terribly. But, Marcie, have you put yourself in Todd's shoes?",
        "Marcie: Yes, I have. Viki, I have, and I -- I would never treat a child the way Todd has treated Tommy -- like a lost possession that he wants back, with no consideration of Tommy's needs. It's -- with Todd, it's just \"me, me, me -- what I want, what I deserve,\" and then -- and the hell with everybody else! Well, the hell with Todd!",
        "Viki: Starr is one of your pupils, isn't she?",
        "Marcie: Yes. And she's wonderful. But I think she has Blair to thank for that, don't you?",
        "Viki: Starr loves her father very much, so does Jack. I'm not trying to excuse Todd's horrendous approach to the situation. But, Marcie, I know one thing -- Todd loves his children.",
        "Marcie: And I love mine.",
        "Viki: So I guess this is about you -- and you being selfish.",
        "Marcie: \"Selfish\"? Oh. Hmm. See, I have lost everything. I lost my husband, my home, my family, my friends, and if I lose my son -- if I lose my baby --",
        "Viki: I have lost a child, too. I know how painful it is, but you do get over it.",
        "Marcie: With all due respect, Viki, I don't think that this situation is the same at all, really, because your daughter died. You had no choice but to lose her.",
        "Viki: Well, I guess that that's my point, then -- you have a choice to make. Do you continue with this life on the run, with all its dangers and distractions, or do you make the much, much harder choice and let him go? It will hurt you deeply, but it may save your son.",

        "Roxy: You don't know that.",
        "Rex: Look, even if Viki decides to stay in Texas --",
        "Roxy: Yeah, probably because Marcie has shot her.",
        "Rex: Right -- which won't happen. But even if Viki is -- let's just say for whatever reason is unavailable, Natalie will be just fine because she has you. And although you're technically not her birth mother, and you were pretty much out to breakfast, lunch, and dinner while she was growing up, she loves you.",
        "Roxy: She tell you that?",
        "Rex: Yes. I know she loves you.",
        "Roxy: You're not both ashamed of me?",
        "Rex: No. Absolutely not. You're a terrific person.",
        "Roxy: Give me a hug. That's enough. Better get in there before Adriana runs off with Miles. Hey, I'm just joking. What's the matter with you? You leave your sense of humor in your sock drawer? Any news?",
        "Adriana: Last I checked, Viki was still in the restaurant with Marcie and Tommy. And the reporters have basically given up trying to get any information from the cops -- they're just questioning people in the crowd. Should we call Marcie's brother?",
        "Rex: Ron?",

        "Roxy: Hey, listen, you had just gotten out of the cracker box for, like, what, you know, three days? You know, you did what you thought you had to. You -- you thought you were putting a dad together with his son.",
        "Miles: I should've kept my mouth shut.",
        "Roxy: Lesson learned. You know, eventually, you'll be able to keep up with us poor slobs. But, you know, in the meantime, you can't beat yourself up. And next time --",

        "Dorian: Did he say why he was so calm?",
        "Blair: Just that Marcie's making demands, the F.B.I. are trying to accommodate her without getting her to run away, and that's what's taking so long.",
        "Dorian: So there isn't much he can do?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I don't know. I'm just -- he's just being weird, and he's actually being very nice about Michael.",
        "Dorian: Call the paramedics.",

        "Blair: No, Todd doesn't need a psychiatrist, he needs me. I mean, he even asked for me down there. So I -- I need you to watch Jack and Starr -- and before you go and say that Addie and Langston are a handful right now, I know that. But if anybody's going to pull this family together, it's going to be me, and I'm going to help Todd bring his son home. So, please, will you watch Jack and Starr for me, please? Please?",
