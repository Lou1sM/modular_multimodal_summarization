        "While Cole is upset and back in school, a drug user asks Cole to join him. Cole notices that Matthew might be hanging with the \"wrong crowd\". They have a new biology teacher. And Starr finds out that he is Dr. Joplin's son. Tea knows that she needs to fight to prevent Nora from proving that Todd intended to kidnap Starr's baby. He admits that Janet the nurse knows all about it but nobody knows where Janet is. Tea warns him that they better make certain that Nora and the prosecution do not find Janet before they do. Janet comes out of nowhere, contacts Renee and asks for her \"help\". Marty spends the night with a strange guy. She seems more comfortable with him than than with the people who know her but whom she does not remember. John is concerned. But she has no memory of him or of Cole."

        "Blair: Just promise me you won't do this again.",
        "Todd: Okay, I promise.",
        "Blair: No, I mean this. And I'm not asking for me. I'm asking for your kids, because I'm the one that has to go home and talk to them about their future with their father.",
        "Todd: What are you going to tell them?",
        "Blair: I don't know. It's up to you. I can either tell them that they're not going to see you again.",
        "[No dialogue]",
        "Blair: And remember you for the man that you used to be -- before everything went wrong.",
        "Todd: Like when I was with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: So, what's the deal with this new science teacher?",
        "Langston: I have no idea, but he can't be worse than Mr. Keller.",
        "Starr: Is that's the most unbelievable comb-over you have ever seen?",
        "Langston: I know, right? I mean, the guy had to be living in a whole different world if he thought he could get away with that.",
        "Starr: Yeah, really bad.",
        "Schuyler: I love the smell of sulfur in the morning -- means I'm in a science classroom.",
        "Langston: My God, he's, like, gorgeous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teen: I'm telling you, dude, a few tokes makes everything look way better.",
        "Cole: Thanks, but that's not going to do it for me.",
        "Teen: So I'll get you something stronger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Nora: Oh, great. Hi, guys.",
        "Antonio: Hey.",
        "Nora: Thank you very much for meeting me here.",
        "Antonio: Sure.",
        "Talia: So what, we can't talk freely at the station?",
        "Nora: I'm really sorry to drag you all down here. It's just that the \"The Sun\" has so many anonymous sources, I really want to keep Todd and T\u00e9a out of the loop.",
        "Talia: Sure.",
        "Antonio: So what do you need?",
        "Nora: I need help. I need help. I got to make these kidnapping charges stick. If that bastard walks, it's going to push Marty right over the edge, and she is this close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, Marty. Who the hell are you, and what did you do to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, before you lost it over Starr and Cole, we actually had a pretty good long stretch there -- I mean, you know, for us.",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. You really had my back when we were looking for Sam.",
        "Blair: Well, I loved you back then. I was even beginning to trust you.",
        "Todd: Not now.",
        "Blair: You threw it away, Todd, like you always do. Those days are over.",
        "Todd: Yes, they are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: I didn't do anything to her.",
        "John: Who are you?",
        "Wes: I should be asking you that, showing up here, accusing me of --",
        "Marty: His name is John McBain.",
        "Wes: Okay, you got a name. Now take a hike, John McBain.",
        "John: Not until I find out if she's all right.",
        "Wes: Whoa.",
        "John: Come on; let's get you out of here.",
        "Marty: I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Marty's putting on a brave face.",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "Nora: But she needs justice. And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure she's got it. Unfortunately, thanks to T\u00e9a, our only shot at it are these kidnapping charges.",
        "Antonio: And those are all based on Starr's testimony.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. If I can prove that Todd was planning on kidnapping Starr's kid, I got my case.",
        "Talia: Okay, so what do you need?",
        "Nora: Well, I've subpoenaed Todd's phone records, but T\u00e9a is fighting me on that.",
        "Antonio: You know, I've known T\u00e9a my entire life, and it still surprises me that she's representing scum like Manning.",
        "Talia: Are there any witnesses that we can question?",
        "Nora: Well, yeah, Jessica Brennan. She spent a lot of time at Todd's house when Marty was there, but she's off-limits.",
        "Talia: Why? Because Todd's her uncle?",
        "Nora: Are you kidding me? All his nearest and dearest are chomping at the bit to see him do time, or worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[No dialogue]",
        "Blair: There are times when -- when I see Starr and her willfulness and determination, I see you. And I hear Jack's reluctant laugh. That's you. And I swear Sam -- he's already, you know, holding his fork like exactly the way that you do, and --",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Blair: I know my kids. I mean, they're me, but there's a lot of you. And I know maybe that's why I, you know, I saved you without thinking. Maybe I'm crazy, but I think that there is a good man in there. I still think that there is, and God help me, I hope so.",
        "Todd: I don't know.",
        "Blair: Well, you're going to have a long time to think about it when you're in that cell all by your lonesome.",
        "Todd: Hmm. Maybe just what I need.",
        "Blair: Todd, you need to pay for the things that you did.",
        "Todd: Nice.",
        "Blair: You were planning on stealing your own daughter's baby. That's sick. That's really sick, even for you.",
        "Todd: I didn't steal my daughter's baby.",
        "Blair: But you wanted to, Todd. You wanted to. Starr knows that. And she may never forgive you for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: He's definitely an improvement over Mr. Keller.",
        "Markko: Whatever. Dude's still a science geek.",
        "Langston: I think I've been getting a little bored of the arts anyway.",
        "Schuyler: Well, you all look alert. So before you doze off, why don't I take a minute to tell you a little bit about what you should expect from me this semester? I have an approach and a style that's a little different from Mr. Keller. I prefer a more informal ambiance. My name is Mr. J, at least that is what the students in my last school used to call me. I'm also going to be giving you a little bit more of a hands-on approach this semester.",
        "Langston: I'm going to like this class.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teen: Fine, don't get mashed. No biggie. But if you just want something stronger, I'll hook you up.",
        "Cole: Yeah? I guess I wouldn't mind taking the edge off. Just checking out for a while.",
        "Teen: So?",
        "Cole: So, hook me up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, Blair, thank you very much. You've brought me muffins. You've hit all your talking points. I think you've made your point. You can leave now.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what, Todd? I brought you something else. You remember that? Yeah, that was last Christmas when you named Sam. Honoring a man who was like a father to you, another person who saw the good in you.",
        "Todd: That's funny. You're in this picture. Why'd you think I would want to look at this?",
        "Blair: That's why God made scissors. You can cut me right out of it. I just want you to take a good, long look at the man in this photo. Remember who he was, because he's certainly not the man standing in front of me right now.",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm.",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: So, last semester Mr. Keller focused mostly on animal biology. Is that right? This term, I want us to concentrate on human biology. Now, don't worry, we won't be dissecting too many humans.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Starr: Just wait till he gives out the first test. All the girls will stop crushing right away.",
        "Langston: Oh, stop.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, hi. Why don't we start with you?",
        "Starr: Me?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Yeah, you, because you seem to have so much to say. Why don't you tell us what you know about basic human biology?",
        "Starr: Meaning?",
        "Schuyler: Reproduction.",
        "Starr: Excuse me?",
        "Schuyler: Conception, babies, birth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teen: I know a guy. Whatever you want, he'll deal you in.",
        "Matthew: What's up, Cole?",
        "Cole: Matthew, hey, don't you have class right now?",
        "Matthew: Uh, no, there's some freshman faculty thing, so we got out early. What are you up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Is Jessica trying to protect Todd? Is that why she's not going to testify?",
        "Antonio: Jess is in St. Ann's. I mean that doesn't exactly make her a credible witness.",
        "Nora: Oh, it's a little more complicated than that.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I know. I know, John filled me in. He said that he got a warrant to search Todd's apartment and that when he got there, Jess was there and that she started complaining about the pain -- something to do with carrying the baby, and that gave Todd enough time to hide Marty. But that couldn't have been Jess. That had to have been Tess.",
        "Talia: Do you think that means she knew about the plan to steal the baby?",
        "Nora: I don't know for sure. That's why I asked Viki if I could question Tess.",
        "Antonio: No, no. You can't ask to talk to Tess. I mean, you ask to talk to Tess, and there's a very good possibility that you will never see Jess again.",
        "Nora: Antonio, I get that, okay? I would never, ever endanger Jessica or anyone else that was in a compromised state just to get what I wanted, okay? I won't. Somehow, I got to prove my case.",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Talia: Hey, Jessica is under strict medical supervision. If something were to go wrong, couldn't they steer her back?",
        "Antonio: No. No, look, I -- I know Jess, and if she knew that she could help, she would. But she's in no condition to make that decision.",
        "Nora: And that's exactly what Viki said, which is why she denied access, so that is that.",
        "Talia: Great. So what do we have?",
        "Antonio: We questioned people at the hospital.",
        "Nora: Yeah?",
        "Antonio: Apparently they saw Todd wandering around when Starr gave birth.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, he'll just say that he was exercising parental rights. He was concerned.",
        "Talia: Okay, but he couldn't have been doing this alone, you know. He couldn't have just walked into the nursery and taken the kid.",
        "Nora: Well, that's why we thought that maybe the doctor was involved.",
        "Talia: Do you think that's why she committed suicide?",
        "Nora: Well, we'll never know for sure, will we? There is one other person -- someone that both Todd and Marty trusted implicitly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on, what do you say I take you home?",
        "Marty: I don't have a home now.",
        "Wes: You heard the lady. She's not leaving with you.",
        "Marty: I'm a visitor in a home full of strangers.",
        "John: Those people care about you, and they love you. You don't belong here.",
        "Marty: Would you stop acting like you know what's best for me? And for your information, I was having a good time until you showed up.",
        "John: I'm trying to help you.",
        "Marty: Yeah, well, if you wanted to help me, you should've let Todd drown.",
        "John: You'll realize in time I did that for you.",
        "Marty: Oh, God, would you just stop doing things for me? You don't know what I want. So just go!",
        "Wes: Start walking.",
        "John: Not without her.",
        "Marty: Oh, I don't need a rescue here. I'm here of my own free will.",
        "John: Like you were at Todd's?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: We were talking about moral obligations, which you know nothing about. Todd, if you love your kids like you say you do, you'll step up and start doing right by them.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, they're better off without me.",
        "Blair: You survived, Todd. Why don't you just get over it and deal with it?",
        "Todd: How?",
        "Blair: Well, you can start by not letting this soulless creep put Starr up on the stand and rake her over the coals like she did Marty Saybrooke. Please, Todd, don't do it to Starr, okay? She can't take it. She lost her child. She's just a child herself. You stand up, and you tell the judge that everything Starr said was true, please.",
        "T\u00e9a: For the record, Blair, Starr volunteered to testify. I am only interested in getting the truth from her.",
        "Blair: Oh, you wouldn't know the truth if it jumped up and slapped you upside the head, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: She's funny.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "T\u00e9a: She's very funny. I can see why you married her all those times.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: How are you?",
        "Todd: Oh, I'm alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Todd's bodyguard.",
        "Antonio: Keyshwan Reddick. John dragged him before a judge. He confirmed that Marty was alive and living at Todd's house.",
        "Nora: You know him?",
        "Talia: Oh, yeah. I pulled his sheet. Let's just say that he's very comfortable with lying.",
        "Nora: Yes, well, he was questioned. And he said he never heard Todd mention Starr's baby.",
        "[No dialogue]",
        "Talia: Do you believe him?",
        "Nora: I don't know. He's had enough brushes with the law. I don't think he wants any more, so -- all right, down to our last one -- someone that Todd hired. Janet Ketring.",
        "Antonio: She worked for Ramsey.",
        "Nora: Yeah, and she's got a whole list of aliases in here. Look at this. Lee Halpern, Lee Sanders, Carol Dennison.",
        "Talia: We already have an A.P.B. out on her.",
        "Nora: Good, but be aware of something. Llanview was her old stomping ground. She's got a lot of friends here. She used to work for Renee.",
        "Talia: What, she used to be a prostitute?",
        "Nora: Yep. And then she decided to go straight and find a legitimate career in nursing.",
        "Antonio: Which would be useful if you're planning on running off with a newborn.",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: So, you still on that going-to-kill-myself jag? You better not be. You know, you don't look half bad for a guy who took a half-gainer off a roof last night. Count your blessings, Todd. Remember when Blair gave me the heave-ho from the third-floor ballroom? I looked like crap. Do you remember that? You stayed with me the whole time.",
        "Todd: I was a different person back then.",
        "T\u00e9a: So, why was Blair here anyway? What did she want?",
        "Todd: Why are you here? What do you want?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm trying to keep you out of jail. That's all. You need to talk to me, Todd. You need to tell me everything.",
        "Todd: I thought I did already.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, great, so Marty -- you told Marty that you were going to raise Starr's baby as your own. No crime there, even if you told Starr the same thing. Still does not prove intent to kidnap. It's not like you had a plot --",
        "Todd: No, no, no. There was intent. There was definitely a plot. The plot was to make Starr believe her baby was dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: This is A.P. biology, my lady. You must know the fundamentals by now. And I presume you did the reading.",
        "Markko: Reproduction is the foundation of life. It's the system of internal fertilization, implantation, and gestation.",
        "Schuyler: Fantastic. Fantastic. But if the young lady doesn't know the basics, then perhaps she's in the wrong class.",
        "Langston: Starr's the smartest person in the room.",
        "Schuyler: That's great. That's great. I live to hear from the smartest person.",
        "Langston: Leave her alone. She knows the fundamentals. I mean, she had --",
        "Starr: I had a baby. I had a baby, and I lost her. So, yes, I know all about reproduction and birth and babies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Asher's on the baseball team.",
        "Asher: Yeah. Anyway, I got to go.",
        "Cole: All right, later.",
        "Matthew: Dude, everyone knows that guy. He's so popular.",
        "Cole: So, how's it feel to make it to second semester?",
        "Matthew: Well, I'm still a freshman, but I live with you, so that gives me a little credit.",
        "Cole: You don't need that from me.",
        "Matthew: Is that why you're done hanging out with me?",
        "Cole: I'm not done hanging out with you. I just haven't been into hanging out lately.",
        "Matthew: Dude, I know. I was just joking. I get it.",
        "Cole: I don't think you do.",
        "Matthew: My mom's memory was really messed up, too. She always said it was hard on her, but harder on everyone else.",
        "Cole: What did you do when she was like that?",
        "Matthew: I was just a little kid. What are you doing about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Why would you throw Todd in my face like that?",
        "John: Don't let Manning do this to you again. Marty, don't turn your back on the people who care about you. What you're doing here -- this is dangerous, all right, and it's not you.",
        "Marty: Yeah, well, you know why I'm here? Because he's not telling me what to be, and he's not asking me to remember something that I can't.",
        "John: Sitting around a room here getting drunk with this guy -- this is going to help you with your problem?",
        "Wes: That's enough.",
        "John: Hurt her in any way and I'll kill you.",
        "Wes: I don't take threats lightly.",
        "John: Don't get in my face again.",
        "Wes: Why? You a cop?",
        "Marty: He was. He was also my lover.",
        "John: It wasn't like that.",
        "Marty: I don't know what it was or wasn't. Doesn't make you my legal guardian.",
        "John: I'm here. Because Cole didn't know where you were and he was worried.",
        "Wes: Okay, what -- who's Cole?",
        "Marty: My son. A kid I can't remember.",
        "John: You will in time.",
        "Marty: You know, I don't even remember having him. Or his first day of kindergarten, or when he lost his first tooth. God, I can't even -- all I can give him is hurt and disappointment, and I can't change it, so you know what? He would be better off believing I was still dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Well, I can't talk to my mom, but I can talk to Langston and Markko and Starr. You know, that helps a lot.",
        "Matthew: And, dude, I hear that seniors have parties and stuff, and raves.",
        "Cole: Where did you hear about raves?",
        "Matthew: Everyone knows about them. Can you bring me sometime?",
        "Cole: Well, I -- I don't go to those kind of parties, so --",
        "Matthew: Well, maybe another kind, then.",
        "Cole: Matthew, why do you want to hang out with people three years older than you are?",
        "Matthew: Because they're cooler.",
        "Cole: Don't be so sure about that.",
        "Teen: Hey, Matt, what's up?",
        "Matthew: Hey, what's up, man? Oh, you know Cole, right?",
        "Cole: Hey, how's it going, guys?",
        "Teen: We're meeting the girls in, like, 10 minutes. Do you want to come?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, sure.",
        "Cole: Hey, Matt, Matt, come here. Wait, hold on a second. Who you hang out with doesn't make you cool. All right, it's who you are. Got that?",
        "Matthew: I know.",
        "Cole: It's good to know. Just good to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Uh, please accept my apologies. I -- I had no idea. Okay, well, we will also be looking at something called biological variations. Does anybody know what that is?",
        "Markko: Isn't that stuff like how climate and environment affect people?",
        "Schuyler: Yes, that's -- something like that. It's about how we as humans are different from one another in some respects and not in others.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: When were you planning on telling Starr that her baby died?",
        "Todd: I wasn't. The doctor was.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, let's start at the beginning, shall we? Now --",
        "Todd: Well --",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, the more you know, the more you're going to want out of this relationship.",
        "T\u00e9a: Trust me, I can take it. Lay it on me.",
        "Todd: See, the whole idea was Starr was going to give her baby to Marcie McBain. Marcie was going to adopt my grandchild, and I couldn't let that happen, because Marcie was the one that stole my son.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I read about that.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Well, I just knew that Starr would regret having given this child to Marcie.",
        "T\u00e9a: And?",
        "Todd: Well, and I decided that -- I decided to take it. And Marty agreed to raise him with me -- or her.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you thought that you could really pull this off?",
        "Todd: At least until Starr was ready to have me back in her life or until she was ready to be a mother anyway.",
        "T\u00e9a: And how were you going to pull this off, Todd?",
        "Todd: Uh -- well, the doctor -- after Starr delivered the baby, the doctor was supposed to buy some time and tell everyone involved that there was something wrong with the kid, and then -- and then she was supposed to take the kid from the delivery room to her office, and then after that, she was going to go down and tell Starr the baby was dead.",
        "T\u00e9a: So, you were going to get the baby from the office and then meet up with Marty, and the three of you were going to ride off into the sunset --",
        "Todd: No, I wasn't going to handle getting the baby out of there. Someone else was.",

        "Antonio: John questioned Janet Ketring. She wouldn't give Todd up.",
        "Talia: What is this hold that Todd has on her?",
        "Nora: Oh, it might be money or something out of her past, who knows? But whatever it is, she did absolutely everything he asked her to do, including telling John, when he came to search Todd's house, that Marty's room was her own. I want her. I want to talk to her.",
        "Antonio: We'll find her.",
        "Nora: Please do, please. Okay, Marty said the last time she saw Janet was just a few hours before John broke into Todd's house.",
        "Talia: Well, that was right when Starr was going into labor.",
        "Nora: Well, doesn't that time out nicely? Keep that file. I have to go -- sit, sit, sit. I got to go anyway. Matthew's coming home from school early. Do me a favor, find her. You hear anything about her, anything at all, you call me anytime, day or night. It's that important.",

        "Todd: Then nothing. I changed my mind.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why?",
        "Todd: Hmm. Starr went into labor, and she called me from the hospital. And we had this really nice conversation and -- I don't know, it made it real, you know? And, uh, I just -- I thought at that moment, I can't do this to her.",
        "T\u00e9a: And the fact that the baby died --",
        "Todd: No, that's just God punishing me.",
        "T\u00e9a: You can take that up with God later. Let's go back over the people who knew about this plan.",

        "Todd: Well, that my wasn't my fault.",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't say it was your fault.",
        "Todd: No, believe me, I mean, I -- I saw her at the hospital. I told her the plan was off, and she was relieved. She seemed happy actually. I don't know. She killed herself because she missed something in Starr's medical history that could've saved the baby. That poor baby.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, listen -- I know this is hard, but we're getting somewhere. We've narrowed it down to the only two people who know that this crazy plan ever existed, okay?",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "T\u00e9a: Dr. Joplin is dead, and Janet Ketring is where?",

He hired her to take care of Marty. Her name is Janet Ketring. Well, we think that she could corroborate your daughter's story that your ex-husband tried to steal her child. Well, I'm not sure if Starr would have to testify, but honestly, having a second witness would really drive a nail in Manning's coffin. I think -- hello? Hello? She hung up. Why would she hang up on me?",

        "Antonio: Look, just because I didn't think it was a good idea that Nora put Jessica on the stand doesn't mean that I have feelings for her.",
        "Talia: Hey, hi, that's not what I'm saying. I think it's a great thing, you know? You haven't forgotten how much you loved Jessica, because you are loyal and compassionate. And those are just two reasons why I love you so much.",
        "Antonio: Thank you. Really. But, uh, Manning and Blair are a whole other story.",
