        "Todd: Okay, because Michael said that --",
        "Viki: Yes, I know what Michael said, but I think he exaggerated my condition so that, you know, Marcie would let me go. Actually, once I had my medicine, I -- I was okay. I -- I'm going to be fine, and you know what? So is your son.",
        "Paramedic: Okay if I check you out?",
        "Viki: Yes, yeah, that's fine.",

        "Todd: Wait a minute, wait a minute here. What are you waiting on, Sutton? You got that psycho in there with my kid, now with her husband, who's probably making plans for her to escape. Why don't you get the hell in there and get them out?",

He -- um -- he's speaking in almost whole sentences. I mean, sometimes -- well, most of the time he forgets the verbs, but he knows how to get his point across -- at least to me, right? Right? \"Laloo\" means \"I love you.\"",

        "Viki: Todd, she -- I really think she's beginning to understand what it is she has to do.",

        "Marcie: No, Michael -- Michael, that's not going to happen. It's not going to happen.",
        "Michael: Marcie, you're not cooperating, you are not surrendering. You took Viki Davidson hostage!",
        "Marcie: Look, I am not the criminal. I am not a criminal. Todd Manning is the criminal, Michael. He doesn't know Tommy, he doesn't love Tommy. He just thinks that he's his. A possession -- that's all he thinks.",
        "Michael: I know, I know it's not fair.",
        "Marcie: You're damn right it's not fair, especially not to Tommy! I mean, if I give him up now, he's the one who is going to suffer the most!",
        "Michael: What do you think is going to happen? That you're going to hang on to him while you shoot your way out of here and just pray that he doesn't get hit by a bullet?",
        "Marcie: No. Michael, I would never hurt Tommy, I -- you know that. Okay, John said that he's going to get us a car, and he's going to get us a plane --",
        "Michael: And then what?",
        "Marcie: And then we're going to fly someplace safe! We're going to go someplace safe, where no one knows who we are, and where no one will take our son away from us, Michael!",
        "Michael: Marcie, that is never going to happen. I'm sorry; this is the end of the line.",

        "Jessica: You don't have to apologize for that.",
        "Clint: Listen, I'm going to get the jet fired up, we're going to come down there and bring you home.",
        "Viki: Uh -- wait a minute, Clint. I -- I appreciate that, but I -- I can't leave here just yet.",
        "Natalie: Why not?",
        "Viki: Because I want to stay with Todd until he gets his son back and -- and make sure that, you know, everything is okay. Look, I'm all right, okay, and -- and I'll explain everything to you when I get home.",
        "Natalie: Well, when -- when is that going to be?",
        "Viki: Uh -- soon, darling. I -- I promise you, okay? Look, I've missed you all very, very much, but I -- I want to go back to Todd now, all right?",

        "Viki: It's all right. Todd, it's all right.",
        "Gigi: Viki --",
        "Viki: Yeah?",
        "Gigi: I had no idea that you knew Sally Ann -- Marcie, I -- or that Tommy was your nephew.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, it's a lot to fathom, isn't it?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I want you to know that, um, I'm not sorry that I helped Marcie, but I'm awfully sorry for the trouble that it made for you.",
        "Viki: Gig, did you know that Sally Ann was really Marcie?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I found out a while ago.",
        "Viki: And yet you continued to help her. Wow. Well, you did what you thought was right, I understand that.",
        "Gigi: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey -- the problem is you could be in a little bit of trouble now.",
        "Gigi: Hmm -- what else is new?",
        "Moe: Uh -- excuse me. Are we going to talk about the great big elephant in the room -- I mean, parking lot?",
        "Shane: Huh?",
        "Noelle: Does Charlie know who you really are?",
        "Viki: Who I really am? If you mean my last name and my life story? No, not so much.",

        "Langston: Come on, it'll take your mind off things.",
        "Starr: You're starting to sound like me, Langston.",
        "Langston: Well, don't you want to look nice for tomorrow's welcome-home party for your brother?",
        "Starr: Whatever. I wonder if Cole's watching this stuff.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm sure they're hanging on to every word at Chez Buchanan.",

        "Marcie: People have been helping us every step of this way. They don't even know us, and they've been sacrificing, and --",
        "Michael: What do I have left to sacrifice? I have lost everything! And when I could've helped, you wouldn't give me the chance.",
        "Marcie: If you had told me the truth about Todd being Tommy's father from the beginning, then this would never have happened, Michael! This would never have happened. I never would've left -- before the custody hearing, before --",
        "Michael: I made a terrible mistake -- just like you made when you took off.",
        "Marcie: I lost everything. I lost my job. I lost you, Michael. I was not about to lose my baby!",
        "Michael: You don't have to lose me, Marcie -- I'm right here. But we can't stay in this diner for the rest of our lives! Look, if you -- if you cooperate with the authorities, you might not even do jail time.",
        "Marcie: Oh --",
        "Michael: I mean, no, you can plead this out, Marcie. Viki will vouch for you, and John -- maybe we'll be granted visitation.",
        "Marcie: \"Visitation\"? Do you think I want to visit my son, Michael? How do I do that -- I mean, knowing that he belongs to someone else, Michael? How do I live without my son? How do I do that?",
        "Michael: You do it the same way I have. I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye -- he thinks that I just disappeared on him.",
        "Marcie: I couldn't trust you. I just couldn't trust you, Michael, okay, and I -- I thought you understood. You -- I heard you. I heard you say that you understood!",
        "Michael: When did you ever hear me say that?",
        "Marcie: Weeks ago, weeks ago! You came to visit me across the street in the motel and I heard you! I heard you talking to Gigi!",

        "Michael: I poured my heart out to Gigi, and you heard that and you still couldn't come out --",
        "Marcie: I thought you were going to take Tommy away! Michael, I --",

        "Viki: Look, I -- I understand you're desperate for airtime, guys, to fill it, but -- but this story is about my brother and his son and I'd like to keep the focus on that, okay?",
        "Reporter: I understand you went home after the death of a family friend and just recently returned to Paris. If your family's watching, will you tell them at least what brought you back here?",

        "Michael: Marcie, I didn't think that I could, either, all right? But this doesn't have to be the end of your life, of our life as a family. Look, I'm here now, okay? We -- we're together again; we can make this decision together.",
        "Marcie: I don't know how to -- no. No, you mean that you are going to tell me what to do, Michael, that's what you mean.",
        "Michael: No! No! You have to make this decision. If you can decide to forgive me for not telling you that Todd was Tommy's biological father, we'll be able to be together again. We'll be able to get each other through this.",
        "Marcie: I don't know how to do that, Michael. How do we forgive each other for what we've done? How do we do that?",
        "Michael: Because we love each other. I know that no matter what has happened, you still love me. Marcie, being with you again -- it's like I have my life back. Marcie, you are my life. You always have been, and you always will be. Marcie, I love you.",

        "Todd: I don't know. They might have something. Maybe -- maybe if I -- if I had been more -- you know, if I hadn't been so impatient about wanting him. If I hadn't said, \"No, I can't wait, I got to have him right now, all or nothing,\" then maybe Marcie wouldn't have felt threatened and she wouldn't have run. This is the point where you -- you're not saying anything.",
        "Viki: No, I'm not, no. Hindsight is 20/20, Todd, okay, and who knows what any of us would've done differently? But the point is now you have to look forward.",
        "Todd: To what? I have no idea what all of this has done to Sam. If it hasn't ruined his life already -- he could die as a result of this.",
        "Viki: No, that's not going to happen. Marcie loves that child more than life itself. She is not going to let anything happen to him.",

        "Marcie: You really think that, Mike?",
        "Michael: Yes. I've thought about this a long time. Tommy is still so young, and I know that we don't ever want him to forget about us, but he's young enough that he will, and that's a blessing. Tommy has a bunch of people to love him and to take care of him, and that's so much better for a kid than a life on the run, a life as a fugitive. We have to let him go, Marcie, but on our own. If we don't, I'm afraid that I'm going to be saying goodbye to both of you -- forever.",

It's the reason why -- why he is in this situation right now, why Mrs. McBain snapped and is threatening to kill Aunt Viki. And you best believe that as soon as my dad and mom get back with Sam, we are throwing Adriana and Rex straight in jail. And you know what? I don't think that they cover prison weddings in that magazine.",

        "Marcie: No.",
        "Michael: Or we can try to shoot our way out of here, and risk all getting caught in the crossfire. Marcie, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, but we have to give him up now, we have to let him go, and we have to do it together. Because once he's gone, what else are we going to have but each other?",
