        "Ross tells Dani that Todd is her biological father. He tells her she should go back to Llanview and get to know Todd. Dani says Todd will never be her father and that he creeps her out. T\u00e9a tells Dani that she won't report to the authorities that Ross is alive if Dani comes back to Llanview to get to know Todd. Ross tells Dani he will be at their house in Tahiti and she can come back whenever she wants. Starr and Langston move in with Cole and Markko. Mitch Laurence goes to Todd's house and tells Todd that he knows what it is like to lose his children. He comments on Todd losing T\u00e9a and Dani and now Starr moving out. He offers to arrange for Cole to have another accident so that Starr will turn to Todd, but Todd warns Mitch not to touch Cole. Mitch says Todd owes him because Todd killed his brother, Walker and had plastic surgery to look like him. He wants Todd to help him get Rex's child because he is not leaving Llanview without the chosen child. Todd refuses.",
        "Rex moves back into the loft with Stacy. Rex and Stacy tell Jessica about Mitch wanting to take their baby and mold it from birth as his heir. Jessica tells Rex that some of the cops on the Llanview PD moonlight as security guards. She warns him to watch out for Stacy. Layla tells Cris and Fish that she was told not to report to work until further notice. Ford is informed that he will not get graduate student housing at the university. Layla, Cris, and Fish discuss how Cris sleeps in Layla's room and Fish usually sleeps at Kyle's place. They decide to invite Ford to move into their apartment with them. David Vickers vows to find Ford.",
        "David goes to the Buchanan mansion and confronts Kim about being a gold- digger. He tells her that he will not let her sleep her way through his fortune. He tells her to get out of Clint's life or he will be forced to tell him the truth about how she manipulated Neville to set into motion the events that led to Clint finding out about Nora and Bo. Clint overhears the end of the conversation so Kim admits it and says he only did it to prevent Clint from being embarrassed by finding out another way. Clint thanks Kim and tells David that Bo is no longer his brother therefore David is no longer his nephew. David leaves. Clint tells Kim that it is obvious that she is looking for a sugar daddy and that they will eventually have to talk about the sugar."

        "Layla: You're just trying to distract me.",
        "Cristian: Is it working?",

        "Rex: Well, that's the last of it.",
        "Stacy: You kidding? I come home from the mall with more than that.",
        "Rex: Well, it's just as well. I'm sure Kim has probably taken over the closets.",
        "Stacy: Oh, I didn't tell you? Kim moved out.",
        "Rex: What? When?",
        "Stacy: This morning. You don't have to worry about she and I driving you crazy. It'll just be the two of us.",
        "Rex: Three.",
        "Stacy: You're right.",
        "Rex: I meant Shane.",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, sure. I'm really looking forward to seeing Shane.",
        "Rex: You didn't ask Kim to move out on account of me moving in, did you?",
        "Stacy: No. No, no. She just got an offer she couldn't refuse. It was a much better situation for her.",
        "Rex: Eh, if that's what she wants.",
        "Stacy: It is. Kim and I are both getting what we want.",

        "Kim: You know who I am and what I did?",
        "David: That's right, toots. I'm smart.",
        "Kim: Who are you?",
        "David: Your boss' nephew David Vickers Buchanan.",
        "Kim: Never heard of you.",
        "David: My father is Bo Buchanan, the former police commissioner.",
        "Kim: So what? You gonna call daddy in for a raid, or maybe you're just trying to get a free lap dance?",
        "David: I don't have to call my-- I'm sorry. What? A free what?",
        "Kim: Everyone knows I was an exotic dancer in Vegas. I don't have any secrets.",
        "David: Are you sure about that?",
        "Kim: Is the pope German?",
        "David: I don't know. Is he?",
        "Kim: Yeah, pretty sure.",
        "David: See, I've always found that confusing, what with him living in Italy and all. You'd think-- don't you change the subject. Remember, I'm smart. We were talking about your secret.",
        "Kim: I told you, I don't have a secret.",
        "David: That's not what Nevil told me. You remember Nevil, don't you?",

        "Markko: So, we're all moving in together?",
        "Cole: Looks that way.",
        "Langston: So, what happened? Did you get in a fight with your dad?",
        "Cole: No. I asked Starr to move in with me.",
        "Markko: What, in front of her dad?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Langston: And he just gave you guys permission?",
        "Starr: Well, he had to. I'm not his little girl anymore, and he had to let me go.",

        "Ross: Sweetheart, I'm not your father. Todd Manning is.",
        "Dani: What? What are you talking about? You're my father.",
        "Ross: I'm not. I'm not biologically.",
        "Dani: No. Don't say that.",
        "Ross: I wish I were, but I'm-- I'm not.",
        "Dani: Why is he doing this?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because he loves you enough to tell you the truth.",

        "Todd: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Mitch: Todd, is that any way to greet an old friend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Who's Nevil?",
        "David: Nigel's dentally challenged look-alike cousin.",
        "Kim: Never heard of him.",
        "David: Oh, don't give me that. Nevil spilled the whole story over a single glass of sherry, told me all about you.",
        "Kim: Who are you again?",
        "David: I told you, I'm David Vickers Buchanan of the London and Llanview Buchanans. Nigel is our butler here, Nevil is our butler there. Nigel is ticklish, Nevil has the teeth of a windmill--what is so confusing? And you broke Nevil's heart without ever thinking twice.",
        "Kim: You must have me confused with somebody else.",
        "David: Oh, I've got the right body. Nevil described it right down to the push- up bra.",
        "Kim: I can't help it if he liked what he saw.",
        "David: So, you didn't ply Nevil with alcohol and promise him that lap dance that you assumed that I wanted, which I do if it's free and I'll tip you.",
        "Kim: That was part of my old job description.",
        "David: Doesn't mean you can't put those skills to good use. You got Nevil to tell the truth to Clint about his unfaithful wife, didn't you? And then you could have Clint all to yourself.",
        "Kim: Actually, why don't we talk about this later?",
        "David: How much later?",
        "Kim: Tonight over drinks at Rodi's or wherever you're staying.",

        "Kim: You calling me a gold digger?",
        "David: Takes one to know one.",
        "Kim: So, this isn't about me breaking your uncle's heart. It's about me using it to get my hands on the Buchanan billions.",
        "David: Looks like maybe you're smart, too. So the only question left is, which one of us is smarterest? And I'll tell you something, cupcake. If anybody is getting their hands on that money, it's me.",

        "Rex: Hey, Jess, come in.",
        "Jessica: Hey. What's going on?",
        "Rex: Sorry I couldn't get into it on the phone. I didn't want to scare you.",
        "Jessica: Are you all right now? Did something happen?",
        "Rex: Mitch made a move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I heard you were back in town.",
        "Mitch: Hmm, and you've been profiting quite handsomely from my return.",
        "Todd: No, you've lost me there.",
        "Mitch: Well, how many times have I been on the front page of that pathetic rag of yours, huh? 4? 5? But who's counting?",
        "Todd: So, you've been reading it.",
        "Mitch: Oh, I loved the recreation of, you know, my surprise appearance at Jared Banks' funeral, although I must say, the model you hired to pose in the casket, he didn't look a thing like me. You, on the other hand-- you continue to look exactly like my late brother, Walker. Your surgeon really-- really was quite an artist.",
        "Todd: What do you want, Mitch?",
        "Mitch: You owe me, Todd. I'm here to collect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston, what made you decide to move in?",
        "Langston: Well, Markko and I have been talking about it for a while.",
        "Starr: And we can't live at Dorian's, and you don't want to live with my dad, right?",
        "Langston: He can be a little intense.",
        "Markko: Which we totally get. I mean, my dad--",
        "Starr: No, is nothing close to my dad.",
        "Markko: Yeah, kind of.",
        "Starr: But I still love him. It's just that I want Cole and Hope and me to be a family.",
        "Cole: And her dad hates the idea.",
        "Langston: Well, it's not like you can't be on your own. You're almost 18.",
        "Starr: I know. Soon I'll be able to vote, but I'm always gonna be my daddy's little girl, his \"only daughter.\"",
        "Cole: Well, it's not like you're moving halfway across the country.",
        "Starr: I know, but he wasn't expecting this. It's not easy for a father to say goodbye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You know how I told you that Ross and I met, right?",
        "Dani: You were stranded on an island.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes.",
        "Dani: You fell in love, got married, and then went back to Tahiti and had me.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's right. That's right. Well, we weren't alone on that island.",
        "Dani: What? You always said it was just you and Dad.",
        "T\u00e9a: It was Ross, me, and Todd.",
        "Dani: When I was little and you told me the story--",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I know. I know. We left out that part.",
        "Dani: Why?",
        "T\u00e9a: You were little. We didn't think you needed to know that.",
        "Dani: Know what, that you slept with Todd?",
        "T\u00e9a: It was only once. It was only once.",
        "Dani: You knew all this time?",
        "Ross: Dani, I--no. I found out in Seattle.",
        "Dani: And you believed her? She's lying.",
        "Ross: She's not lying.",
        "Dani: She so is! She'll say anything to keep me and you apart.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sweetheart, I have proof. Here. See for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: So, you admit it. You used Nevil to get to my uncle.",
        "Kim: No one used Nevil for anything. He flew here from London to tell his master the truth about his wife's affair.",
        "David: Until Nigel talked him out of it.",
        "Kim: Yeah. Nigel is a control freak.",
        "David: Oh, look who's talking. You're the one who played 'Enry 'Iggins and got Nevil to pretend he was Nigel.",
        "Kim: All I did--",
        "David: All you did was break up Clint and Nora so you could take advantage.",
        "Kim: No one can take advantage of Clint Buchanan.",
        "David: Many have tried and failed.",
        "Kim: Including you?",
        "David: Including me, but he's my uncle now. This is my family.",
        "Kim: Really?",
        "David: I've got the genes to prove it, and I'm not gonna let you start sleeping your way through my fortune, princess velvet thighs. This family isn't big enough for the both of us.",

        "Layla: Maybe we should move this to the bedroom in case Oliver gets home.",
        "Oliver: Uh, he's home.",
        "Cristian: What are you doing here?",
        "Oliver: I live here.",
        "Cristian: Not since you started dating Kyle.",
        "Oliver: Uh, well, do you want me to leave?",
        "Layla: Of course not. Cristian is just kind of grumpy.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, you try dealing with a flooded restaurant at 4:00 in the morning.",
        "Layla: Cris and I are having kind of a bad day.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Well, join the club. I go on duty, I don't even know who's gonna be there. I mean, Lowell fired Bo, John. Who's next?",
        "Layla: I think you're looking at her.",
        "Oliver: What are you talking about?",
        "Layla: I got a call telling me not to come in.",
        "Oliver: That's it? No explanation?",
        "Layla: Pretty much.",
        "Oliver: Then you should just quit.",
        "Layla: John told me not to.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. He wouldn't want you to go down without a fight.",
        "Layla: Besides, with two of us out of work, we could lose this place.",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Cristian: I'll get that.",
        "Ford: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Ford: Am I early?",
        "Cristian: For what?",
        "Ford: We're gonna hit the gym, remember?",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah. That's right. Let me--I'll get my stuff.",
        "Layla: Hey, Ford.",
        "Ford: Hey.",
        "Layla: Ford, this is Oliver Fish. Oliver, this is Robert Ford.",
        "Oliver: Hi.",
        "Ford: Just Ford. Nice to meet you.",
        "Oliver: You, too.",
        "Ford: Ooh, sorry. Hang on a second. It's work. Hello? Yeah. Right, so what am I supposed to do? Great. Thanks.",
        "Oliver: Problem?",
        "Ford: Not unless you count me losing my graduate student housing.",
        "Layla: Well, you're in luck.",
        "Ford: Yeah? How come?",
        "Layla: This building has an apartment for rent. You can live here.",

        "Stacy: Mitch sent one of his people.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. Did he hurt you?",
        "Stacy: No. It was actually a woman, and she said she was a nurse. She came with this syringe full of something that was gonna knock me out.",
        "Jessica: What did you do?",
        "Stacy: I grabbed that needle and knocked that bitch out first.",
        "Jessica: And, well, that's it?",
        "Rex: Oh, no.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, Mitch shows up thinking he's gonna help this crazy nurse get me into the trunk of his car",
        "Jessica: He was trying to kidnap you?",
        "Stacy: He wants my baby.",
        "Jessica: What? Why?",
        "Stacy: He thinks it's his grandkid.",
        "Rex: Well, it is his grandchild.",
        "Stacy: Right, um, but what I meant was just, he thinks it's the chosen one over Bree and Shane.",
        "Rex: The heir he can mold from birth.",
        "Jessica: Oh, you're kidding.",
        "Stacy: No. Told him to get lost. He's not going anywhere near my baby.",
        "Rex: Only Mitch isn't exactly the type of person to take no for an answer.",
        "Jessica: This is horrible.",
        "Rex: Tell me about it. He wants all of us under his control--me, you, Natalie, Stacy.",
        "Stacy: No. He doesn't care about me. I mean, you two are his kids, but I'm just a human incubator.",
        "Jessica: He said that?",
        "Stacy: Actually, he called me the vessel. He made it clear that, you know, once he gets his hands on my baby, I'm not necessary anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I owe you?",
        "Mitch: That's what I said.",
        "Todd: How do you figure?",
        "Mitch: You killed my brother. You stole his identity.",
        "Todd: Yes. Well, I needed a new one after you had my face rearranged, so by my account, we're even.",
        "Mitch: You tried to destroy me. You used my family, my love of my family against me.",
        "Todd: Yes, to protect mine.",
        "Mitch: Well, that's one thing we agree on.",
        "Todd: We don't agree on anything, Mitch.",
        "Mitch: Family is everything. When I look at you, I see the brother I lost. Your very existence is so painful to me.",
        "Todd: Well, then get out of here.",
        "Mitch: Eh, I don't think so.",
        "Todd: Are you sure? I mean, there must be some idiots in need of a village somewhere.",
        "Mitch: Oh, this isn't about my followers.",
        "Todd: Did they get wise?",
        "Mitch: I need someone to carry on after I'm gone, an heir, and my children want nothing to do with me. Of course, children don't always know what's best for them.",
        "Todd: Sounds like yours do.",
        "Mitch: You know, no matter how grown up they are, they still need a father's guidance, his love, like your daughter, Starr, for instance, or your other daughter...Danielle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: This doesn't make Todd my father.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sweetheart--",

        "Ross: Dani, Dani--",
        "Dani: You're my dad. I love you.",
        "Ross: And, you know you'll always be my daughter, but you have to--",
        "Dani: He'll never be my father, not ever.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sweetheart--",
        "Dani: How could you not say anything? Did you know any of this? Did you know she slept with Todd?",
        "Ross: I--",
        "Dani: You had a baby with another man, and you never told Dad?",
        "T\u00e9a: I thought it was Ross'. I wanted it to be Ross'.",
        "Dani: But it wasn't. I'm not his daughter because of you!",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella, please try to understand. I was very much in love with Todd when you were conceived.",
        "Dani: So much that you didn't care when he left you.",
        "T\u00e9a: He was in love with someone else. I had no choice but to accept that, and then Ross and I got married.",
        "Dani: So when you found out you were pregnant, you just pretended it was his?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I didn't pretend. I put it out of my mind because I didn't want it to be true.",
        "Dani: Yeah, right.",
        "T\u00e9a: It--it's true. I-- and by that time, I was committed to someone else, and we loved each other until we didn't anymore, and it wasn't Todd's fault. It wasn't anyone else's fault.",
        "Dani: So why now, after all this time?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because I got a call about a case that would bring me back to Llanview.",
        "Dani: You knew you'd see Todd again.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I did, and when I saw him, I had feelings. I had confused feelings, and I-- I didn't know what to do about them. I knew I had to deal with them.",
        "Dani: So, you figured now was a good time to find out?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I had a DNA test done, and those are the results.",
        "Dani: When?",
        "T\u00e9a: Months ago.",
        "Dani: Months ago? Why didn't you tell me?",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't tell anyone. I was scared to.",
        "Dani: Scared of what? Of Todd, what he'd to do you?",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you mean, what Todd would do to me?",
        "Dani: In Seattle, Dad said that Todd was a monster, that you can't trust him.",
        "Ross: Oh, honey, I was-- I was angry. I--",
        "Dani: But it's true. He tried to kill you.",
        "Ross: I think, Dani, he was just trying to protect you.",
        "T\u00e9a: He was trying to save his daughter, Dani.",
        "Dani: Wait. He knew he was my father?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What the hell do you know about Dani?",
        "Mitch: Hmm, must be so hard to lose her and then Starr.",
        "Todd: I haven't lost Starr.",
        "Mitch: Oh, she's about to turn 18, move in with the father of her baby. She doesn't need you anymore.",
        "Todd: You have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Mitch: Of course, I do. Jessica refuses to even acknowledge that I'm her father or that her sweet little Bree is my grandchild--",
        "Todd: Smart girl.",
        "Mitch: And my son Rex has a child coming soon, a grandchild I may never see.",
        "Todd: None of this is my problem.",
        "Mitch: But you do understand, or maybe \"empathize\" would be a better word, because you've also been abandoned, haven't you? Cast aside.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Poor me.",
        "Mitch: Face it, Todd. You're exactly like me. Family is everything to both of us.",
        "Todd: Mitch, you have no idea what family is about.",
        "Mitch: Oh, we both know what it's like to lose them--T\u00e9a, Danielle, Starr, Hope. It's like losing a piece of your soul, isn't it?",
        "Todd: You don't have any soul, Mitch.",
        "Mitch: Hmm, that's what they said about you after you made Marty Saybrooke your prisoner. This is where you kept her, huh? Away from the son who needed her, the woman you raped, all to yourself. Hmm, that must've been strangely satisfying.",
        "Todd: You are one sick son of a bitch. You know that?",
        "Mitch: Oh, sorry. I see I've hit a nerve. But how could anyone expect you to know how to behave with a female when the only one who's ever loved you unconditionally was Starr?",
        "Todd: If you ever say her name--",
        "Mitch: And now you've lost her to the bed of the son of the woman you raped.",
        "Todd: Okay, Mitch, that's enough.",
        "Mitch: But I can get her back for you, Todd. You know I can. Now, if Cole were to have another accident, a fatal one this time, whose arms do you think Starr would run to?",

        "Langston: Actually, come to think of it, it could be kind of cool, the 5 of us living together. I mean, it's not so bad.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you think?",
        "Langston: Well, it takes a village, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah. It was pretty sweet living in La Boulaie, though. I could get help any time I needed. Now with us living on our own--",
        "Cole: It's gonna be great.",
        "Langston: Yeah, and Markko and I can help out with Hope whenever you guys are in class.",
        "Markko: We can?",
        "Langston: Of course.",
        "Starr: I promise that Hope won't bother you.",
        "Langston: Well, how could she? She's adorable. Come here. Come to Langston. Come here, Hopie.",
        "Cole: No, don't call her Hopie.",
        "Langston: Hopie, Hopie, Hopie.",
        "Starr: Ha ha ha!",
        "Cole: Okay. I'm gonna go get Hope's stuff out of the car.",
        "Markko: All right. Do you need a hand?",
        "Cole: Yeah. You wouldn't believe how much stuff comes with a baby.",

        "Rex: I think they're okay. Mitch said he wants to start from scratch.",
        "Stacy: A whole new person he can mold into his totally gross image.",

        "Jessica: You have to.",
        "Rex: This isn't your problem.",
        "Jessica: We're family. Of course it is. Are you okay?",
        "Stacy: Other than the baby kicking up a storm, yeah.",
        "Rex: Tiny dancer. Stacy seems to think it's a girl.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Rex: Guess we'll find out soon enough.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. When are you due?",
        "Stacy: I'm due March 14.",
        "Kim: That's a month late.",
        "Stacy: You don't think I know that?",
        "Kim: You got to have this kid around Valentine's Day if you want Rex to believe it's his.",
        "Stacy: February 14, Valentine's Day.",
        "Jessica: Whoa, that's only 4 weeks away.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, 4 weeks.",
        "Jessica: You're lucky. You're carrying small.",

        "Kim: Spend 8 hours in platform heels and a g-string. See how you feel.",
        "David: Actually, Berlin, '97. I was so broke, I had to take a job in a club where I wore the-- that's irrelevant. So you're only here for the day job, huh?",
        "Kim: Yeah, and I'm gonna get really good at it, too. I'm learning a lot about computers, I'm filing--",
        "David: All the better for you to gain access to Clint's financial records.",
        "Kim: His password is triple-protected.",
        "David: Which you just happen to know.",
        "Kim: Like I said, I'm his assistant, so unless you have an appointment with Mr. Buchanan, we're done here.",
        "David: You're sort of skipping the part where Mr. Buchanan is going to be upset when he finds out you ruined his marriage.",
        "Kim: I didn't ruin anything. His wife already did that by cheating on him with his own brother.",
        "David: Get out of Clint's life, now.",
        "Kim: What if I don't?",
        "David: Well, I guess I'll be forced to tell him the truth.",

        "Layla: Ford's university housing fell through.",
        "Cristian: That sucks.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, and I was thinking, you know, I'm at Kyle's most of the time.",
        "Layla: And you're with me every night.",
        "Oliver: So, we basically have a spare bedroom.",
        "Layla: And if one of us loses our job...",
        "Oliver: Then we could definitely use the extra rent money.",

        "Dani: I'm gonna kill you, just like you killed my father.",
        "T\u00e9a: So we decided not to make you face the truth. We decided to give you time to grieve, to heal.",

        "Todd: Mitch, if you touch one hair on Cole Thornhart's head, I swear to God--",
        "Mitch: Yes. You'll kill me. When did you become so drearily predictable?",
        "Todd: Well, Starr is an adult now. She's made her choice.",
        "Mitch: Like when she wanted to put her baby up for adoption and you tried to let her think that the baby was dead?",

        "Dani: What?",
        "Ross: Yeah. I got to hold you in my arms, I taught you how to surf. I watched you grow up.",

        "Mitch: Hmm. You can help me.",
        "Todd: I don't even know them, Mitch.",
