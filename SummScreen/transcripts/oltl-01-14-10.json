        "Dorian: I thought that Starr might like to open her birthday present early-- ah-ha--while we have some very fine French chocolate.",
        "Blair: Choke on it.",
        "Dorian: Honey, I want to apologize.",
        "Blair: Okay. Fine. Go ahead.",

        "Langston: Or her dolls.",
        "Markko: Okay. That's it.",
        "Langston: Markko.",
        "Markko: Look, I love Starr and Cole, but living with them is impossible.",
        "Langston: Mm. Hope kept you up all night, too, huh?",
        "Markko: How am I supposed to bulk up if I can't get my 8 hours? Not to mention that there's no room in the fridge for my protein shakes and my--",
        "Langston: It's okay.",
        "Markko: No, it's not okay. I can't have [Whispers] Sex. [Normal voice] Knowing Hope could come crawling in at any moment. This isn't working.",
        "Langston: Well, duh.",
        "Markko: And I know it's only been one night, but--wait. What did you say?",
        "Langston: I was online all morning looking for new apartments.",
        "Markko: Any luck?",
        "Langston: I think I might have finally found it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Ahh--",
        "Oliver: Are you okay?",
        "Ford: Oh. Yeah. I just slept funny. Must've done something to my back.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, when I first moved in, I was hunched over for, like, a week.",
        "Ford: Do me a favor, will you? Crack it.",
        "Oliver: Um...how?",
        "Ford: Just grab hold and squeeze it really hard. [Exhales]",

        "Langston: It's in a great building with an amazing view.",
        "Markko: Whoa. Is that the bathroom?",
        "Langston: The sooner you get ready, the sooner we can get there and snatch it before somebody else does.",
        "Markko: I can't wait for a hot shower.",
        "Langston: Oh, tell me about it.",
        "Markko: And some alone time with my girlfriend wouldn't be too bad, either.",

        "Langston: What was that about alone time?",
        "David: Markko, my boy. Thank God.",

        "Greg: You sure you guys won't mind rooming together?",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah. Why?",
        "Greg: I don't know. Living together, working together. If it was me, I might get annoyed.",
        "Schuyler: No, no. We'll be fine.",
        "Greg: Okay, well, if it doesn't work out, Rachel can always move in with me.",
        "Rachel: Not going to happen.",
        "Schuyler: Heh heh. We're hardly going to be seeing each other outside of work, anyway.",
        "Greg: Oh, good. So, you have some other place to be?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, holed up in my room. Studying. And if I happen to get that done early, then--",
        "Gigi: Then he will be hanging out with Shane and me.",
        "Schuyler: That's assuming-- assuming Shane can stand the sight of me.",
        "Gigi: He'll come around. Someday.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, my God. That is so encouraging. Thank you.",
        "Gigi: Hey, come on. He got used to Stacy carrying Rex's baby, didn't he? If he can deal with that, he can deal with anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You don't have to come in with me.",
        "Rex: You don't want me there?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, no, I just mean I can do it by myself.",
        "Rex: I know, I just haven't been to an appointment in a while. I want to know everything I can about my baby.",
        "Dr. Baez: Okay, so, we'll see you in a week.",
        "Woman: Thanks.",
        "Dr. Baez: Stacy, I'll be right with you.",

        "Woman: Oh. You'll be getting something better than chocolate this year.",
        "Stacy: Right.",

        "Blair: If Langston wanted you to know where she was, I think she would've told you herself.",
        "Dorian: You know I'll find out eventually.",
        "Blair: Oh, you just go find out, but you're not gonna hear it from me.",
        "Dorian: Blair...",
        "Blair: Mm.",
        "Dorian: I understand your anger.",
        "Blair: Anger? Oh, no, I think it's a little more than that. You hired the man that kidnapped my daughter and my granddaughter to run the Llanview police.",
        "Dorian: I know that you're concerned.",
        "Blair: Uh, concerned? I think, yeah. I had to move in here with Todd.",
        "Dorian: And that's what concerns me. No, no, strike that. That is what scares me more than anything.",
        "Blair: Oh, more than hiring Stanley Lowell to run Llanview?",
        "Dorian: How many times does Todd get to hurt you?",
        "Blair: Okay, Dorian, listen to me. I am here at Todd's. That is it.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, and we know where \"it\" has led you before.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? No, no, no, no. That's it. You're not gonna sidetrack me by talking about Todd. Now just get out. Go.",
        "Dorian: Not until you tell me where Langston is.",
        "Blair: Forget it.",
        "Dorian: Look, you and Starr and Addie, you can hate me from wherever you want, but Langston is my daughter, and she better hate me from home.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? I'm not gonna get in the middle of it, Dorian. Not gonna do it.",
        "[Dorian scoffs]",
        "Dorian: You know, I would do the same for you if our positions were reversed. Please, Blair. Tell me where Langston is.",
        "Blair: Langston moved in with Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Actually, Markko and I were just on our way out.",
        "David: Well, I guess I'll just have to subpoena him, then. You're not gonna want to miss our big day in court.",
        "Markko: What are you talking about?",
        "David: I'll let my mouthpiece do the speaking for me. Mouthpiece! My lawyer Elijah Clarke.",
        "Langston: Why do you have a lawyer?",
        "Eli: Because he accosted me at the diner and begged me to represent him.",
        "David: I'm telling you, I got a case!",
        "Markko: What case?",
        "Eli: From what I can gather, David is suing for copyright infringement.",
        "David: The classic struggle between talent and commerce. Your little date? It can wait.",
        "Markko: Actually, it can't.",
        "Langston: Yeah, we're gonna go see about a new apartment.",
        "David: Actually, this place is...rather sad.",
        "Langston: We gotta get there before somebody else gets it.",
        "David: An apartment? Markko, after we win our case, you're gonna be buying houses, mansions, islands!",
        "Markko: How? I was just the cameraman.",
        "David: And you're entitled to a fee, nominal, of any money that's made from my name or my likeness.",
        "Langston: Markko, maybe I should just go see it by myself.",
        "Markko: As long as it's not condemned, we're taking it.",
        "Langston: I'll see you later. Mwah.",
        "Markko: Okay, David, what is this about?",
        "David: The character assassination of David Vickers by the coward Robert Ford.",

        "Oliver: Kyle. I thought you were starting your obstetrics rotation this morning.",
        "Kyle: I am. But rounds got delayed an hour, so I grabbed a cab, thought I'd come surprise you for some breakfast.",
        "Oliver: That's great.",
        "Kyle: Now I get to see what you do with all your spare time.",
        "Oliver: Kyle, this is Ford.",
        "Ford: Hey.",
        "Kyle: How you doing, buddy?",
        "Ford: How you doing?",
        "Oliver: Ford just moved in.",
        "Kyle: With the 3 of you?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Well, you know, Cris and Layla basically share a room, so we had some extra space...",
        "Ford: They offered it to me, really cheap.",
        "Kyle: Oh, that's great. Now you can spend all that extra money to buy yourself some clothes.",
        "Oliver: You see, Ford hurt his back.",
        "Ford: And Oliver cracked it for me.",
        "Oliver: That's all.",
        "Ford: I feel a lot better. Great guy you got here.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, that's why he's my boyfriend.",
        "Ford: Relax, bro. I'm straight.",
        "Kyle: Yeah? I feel like I've heard that one before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: And that is the last of it.",
        "Greg: We've got one more box out in the car.",
        "Gigi: I'll go with you. Coffee?",
        "Schuyler: Sounds good.",
        "Rachel: Yeah. Thanks.",
        "Greg: You two will be okay here by yourselves?",
        "Schuyler: Well, yeah, I guess we're gonna have to be, seeing as we're roommates.",
        "Greg: Right. Right.",
        "Gigi: Come on. Let's go.",
        "Greg: Okay.",
        "Schuyler: So, Greg's thrilled.",
        "Rachel: He'll get used to it.",
        "Schuyler: You think?",
        "Rachel: Not everybody can be as low-key as Gigi.",
        "Schuyler: I know, right? How cool is she?",
        "Rachel: You two look pretty happy.",
        "Schuyler: We are pretty happy. I mean, it was--it was kind of tense there for a while, but things are good now, you know what I mean? I feel like-- I feel like things can only get better.",
        "Rachel: Assuming that nobody finds out that Gigi's sister is carrying your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: My secret? Well, I guess I just don't use being pregnant as an excuse to eat like a horse.",
        "Woman: Excuse me?",
        "Dr. Baez: Stacy, why don't you go into the exam room? I'll be right with you.",
        "Rex: What's wrong with you?",
        "Stacy: You know I get nervous with doctor's appointments.",
        "Rex: What does that have to do with that woman?",
        "Stacy: Well, she said my baby looked small. I mean, what if that means something's wrong with it?",
        "Rex: She didn't mean it that way.",
        "Stacy: Well, I don't like getting upset when I have to get poked and prodded.",
        "Rex: Don't worry. I will help keep you calm.",
        "Stacy: You will?",
        "Rex: I won't leave your side.",
        "Dr. Baez: Stacy? All ready?",
        "Stacy: Uh, don't you have to go check on protection for me from Mitch?",
        "Rex: Yeah, after we hear about the baby.",
        "Stacy: Okay, well, Rex, this exam's kind of private.",
        "Rex: Oh, I get that.",
        "Stacy: Look, I'm safe here in the hospital. I'll tell you everything I find out.",
        "Rex: Just don't go anywhere till I get back.",
        "Stacy: I promise. Whoo. I thought he'd never leave. He just wants to be so involved but he gets me so anxious.",
        "Dr. Baez: Is it because you're afraid he'll figure out that it's not his baby you're carrying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I never knew you were a chiropractor.",
        "Oliver: I'm not.",
        "Kyle: I can't wait for you to crack my back.",
        "Oliver: Please come here for a minute.",
        "Kyle: You gonna do it right now?",
        "Oliver: No. Listen, nothing happened. It was completely innocent.",
        "Kyle: Methinks the lady doth protest too much.",
        "Oliver: You have no reason to be jealous.",
        "Kyle: I know.",
        "Oliver: You do?",
        "Kyle: Come on, Oliver. Can you not tell I was just having some fun with you?",
        "Oliver: Listen, it is all still pretty new to me, remember?",
        "Kyle: Okay, well, something else you need to know is it's okay to look.",
        "Oliver: I don't want to.",
        "Kyle: Are you kidding me? Your new roommate's kinda hot.",
        "Oliver: Oh, is he? I hadn't noticed.",
        "Kyle: Did you notice he's ripped, too? Because I did.",
        "Oliver: Well, you're not so bad yourself.",
        "Kyle: Oh, thank you.",
        "Oliver: And the only guy for me. Listen, I don't sleep with straight guys.",
        "Kyle: Right. Just straight women?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What are you talking about?",
        "Dr. Baez: I heard you lie about your due date.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Dr. Baez: I can only assume it has something to do with the baby's paternity.",
        "Stacy: Oh, listen. I don't know what kind of reality show patients you get in here, but I am not one of them. Rex is my baby's father.",
        "Dr. Baez: You don't owe me any explanations.",
        "Stacy: So, you won't tell Rex?",
        "Dr. Baez: I couldn't even if I wanted to. I'm bound by doctor-patient confidentiality.",
        "Stacy: Then why are you putting me through this?",
        "Dr. Baez: Look, the longer you keep this a secret, the stickier it'll get for you. Especially when Valentine's Day rolls around and you're not even close to having your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Please tell me this is not how you're gonna be.",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Schuyler: Bringing up Stacy's baby every time we turn around.",
        "Rachel: I said one thing.:",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, yeah, and we've been living together how long now?",
        "Rachel: What kind of a roommate would I be if I didn't try to keep you honest?",
        "Schuyler: Um...the good kind?",
        "Rachel: Fine. Just don't blame me when it all blows up in your face.",
        "Schuyler: What is that? Why would it?",
        "Rachel: Isn't Stacy's baby gonna be born a month late?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, I'll figure something out.",
        "Rachel: Really? Like what?",

        "Schuyler: Uh...",
        "Greg: Something we want to share with the rest of the class?",
        "Schuyler: I gotta go to the hospital.",
        "Gigi: I should go, too.",
        "Greg: Schuyler, I guess you'll be starting your rotations soon.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Next couple weeks.",
        "Greg: Uh-huh. Well, I'd be happy to put in a good word for you at the hospital, make sure you're treated right.",
        "Schuyler: Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Greg: No trouble. I'd hate for you to get stuck doing scut work for the rest of your life.",

        "Greg: Drive safely. What?",

        "Schuyler: So, Greg's a little intense.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Schuyler: Do you think maybe I should try law school instead, or--",
        "Gigi: Just stay away from Rachel. That's an order.",
        "Schuyler: Hey. Hey, now.",
        "Langston: Oh.",
        "Schuyler: Hey.",
        "Langston: Mr. J. Hi.",

        "Langston: Um, good. Um, do you know, is this the apartment that's available?",
        "Schuyler: Oh. Not anymore.",
        "Langston: I-I just saw an ad online.",
        "Schuyler: I know. I just signed a lease last night. I'm so sorry.",
        "Langston: Oh. Great.",
        "Schuyler: Well, okay, I'm sure-- I'm sure that there's--there's-- there's something else in the building.",

        "Blair: Because I'm not her mother.",
        "Dorian: I'm her mother. Why didn't you talk to me?",
        "Blair: Oh, like you talked to us before you hired Lowell?",
        "Dorian: Langston is far too young to be cohabitating with her boyfriend.",
        "Blair: Langston and Starr are both almost 18 years old, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Don't bring Starr into this. Like I said, they are too young.",
        "Blair: Okay, maybe they are, but I can't control them anymore and neither can you. You'd think you might've taken a hint when Langston walked out on you. Look, I'm sorry.",
        "Dorian: No, you're not.",
        "Blair: I am.",
        "Dorian: No, you're not.",
        "Blair: I am sorry. Look, Langston and Starr are old enough to make their own decisions, Dorian, and old enough to make their own mistakes.",

        "Dorian: There is a difference between a mistake and a monumental catastrophe.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, listen to you. Don't you think you're overexaggerating?",
        "Dorian: If I--I mean, if I were there--",
        "Blair: But you weren't, Dorian. You weren't. And you only have yourself to blame for that.",
        "Dorian: I had a very--a very good reason for hire--for hiring Stan Lowell.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "Blair: Wow. Lay it on me. I just can't wait to hear this one. Go ahead.",

        "Eli: Show him what?",
        "David: The video! It's all in the file. Use that laptop over there. Okay, Markko. Picture this. I'm minding my own business in my private wing at the London Buchanan compound. I'm searching the interweb for charitable sites, and I see an advertisement for the internet's newest sensation. My curiosity was piqued and I entered the site, but I was not prepared for the horror that unfolded before me.",
        "[Music playing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Blair, I want my family back.",

        "Blair: Okay, that's it. You no longer get to comment on my life.",
        "Dorian: I have a right. You comment this. Why, out of all the places you could've gone to to seek safe haven, did you choose to live under your ex- husband's now- conveniently T\u00e9a-free roof?",
        "Blair: Okay. You don't get to comment! No more! Todd and I are over! And I am moving on.",

        "David: He stole our concept, he turned it into an internet telenovela, and he committed the cardinal sin--he recast me.",
