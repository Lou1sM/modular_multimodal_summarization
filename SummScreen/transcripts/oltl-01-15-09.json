    "Recap": [
        "Starr's new teacher (Dr. Joplin's son) admits to her that his mother got really \"messed up\" by bailing him out of his messes such as drug addiction. And that could have contributed to why Starr's baby died. She finds out that Tea has been contacting him in order to build Todd's case. Cole starts taking pills after his mother admits to him that she needs to stay away from him since she remembers nothing. Marty admits to Cole and to Nora that she'd rather spend time with Wes and live with him than be around them. Brody talks to Jessica about her upcoming meeting with her parents and doctor. She goes with them to the place where she (as Tess) gave birth. And she admits that Tess realized the baby was not crying. It's too painful for her to know what really happened. And she turns into Tess again. David Vickers comes to visit Dorian. She does not believe that he has \"changed\" and tries to seduce him and serve him caviar and expensive champagne. Natalie and Jared want to make certain that David never finds out that he inherits all of Asa's fortune. But Dorian has another plan where she marries him and lets him find out about his inheritance so that she can take it from Clint."

        "Noelle: David Vickers?",
        "David: Namaste, Noelle.",
        "Noelle: It's below freezing outside.",
        "David: I told myself not to feel cold. Therefore, I am not cold.",
        "Noelle: Well, your goose pimples say different. Come on, Carlotta's got a pot of five-alarm chili on the stove.",
        "David: Noelle, meat is temptation. Is it vegan?",
        "Noelle: Oh, you don't have to eat it. You just have to stand by it. You really don't feel cold?",
        "David: If the spirit is strong, so is the flesh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: It was so gracious of you to come over on such short notice. You see, I've only just returned --",
        "Delphina: From St. Blaze's. So, when people tell you to 'go to blazes', you take them literally.",
        "[Dorian and Delphina laugh]",
        "Dorian: Yes, you're of course talking about Victoria Davidson. Why that dreadful woman decided to falsely accuse me --",
        "Delphina: Of drugging Charlie Banks? Ha, we knew it. Mm-hmm. Charlie would never drink on his own.",
        "Dorian: Anything else?",
        "Delphina: I don't know, is there? That's about it.",
        "Dorian: All right. Perhaps you could tell me whether or not Viki's still on the warpath?",
        "Delphina: Oh, that. You don't need to worry about that. You are the last person on her mind right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Jessica is hoping that she will remember what happened the night that she gave birth.",
        "Nora: So you're taking her back to the cottage?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Clint: Yeah, Dr. Levin is all right with that. He thinks it might trigger something.",
        "Viki: Maybe she'll finally be able to figure out why Tess won't leave her alone.",
        "Nora: Is -- is there a chance that Tess may re-emerge?",
        "Viki: We're hoping she won't.",
        "Clint: And yet, it is a possibility.",
        "Nora: Well, I mean, I'm just remembering that you said I couldn't question Tess about what Todd did last summer because it could endanger Jessica.",
        "Viki: Yes, that's exactly what I said, Nora. And it was the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Brody, you awake?",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Hey. Sorry to bother you.",
        "Brody: It's okay. Everything all right?",
        "Jessica: I'm leaving in a few minutes.",
        "Brody: Leaving?",
        "Jessica: To take your advice.",
        "Brody: You're going back to the place where you had the baby.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, the place that my husband, my late husband, built to find out why Tess keeps saying there's something wrong with the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Oh, you're early.",
        "Starr: I had to finish my assignment on roan cows.",
        "Schuyler: Make sure that you study up on recessive genes. That's going to be on the test on Friday, so --",
        "Starr: I know we agreed to pretend that your mother wasn't my doctor.",
        "Schuyler: We're not pretending. In this classroom, we are teacher and student, so --",
        "Starr: You know why I didn't get my homework done last night? It was because I went to visit my baby's grave. And I thought about her for the rest of the night. Actually, I never stop thinking about her. Probably like you never stop thinking about your mom.",
        "Schuyler: You know, she killed herself before I could say I was sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Really, you think that I'm a good almost mom?",
        "Jared: Yeah, I got admit, I didn't exactly see you as the maternal type, but --",
        "Natalie: Oh, me neither.",
        "Jared: Now, if only we could use our superior parental skills to aid us in getting Vickers out of town before he finds out.",
        "David: Finds out what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So Viki's no longer making those false accusations against me. Wonderful. Now, I need you to find someone --",
        "Delphina: David Vickers, before he figures out that he's Asa's son and is entitled to the entire Buchanan fortune",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry, I'm feeling a little light-headed, yes. Perhaps we should both sit down, please.",
        "Delphina: Sure, sure. Over here?",
        "Dorian: Delphina, thank you. I'll be just fine in -- ahem -- just a moment. So, how did you know that Asa had left his entire estate to David Vickers?",
        "Delphina: Psychic!",
        "Dorian: Yes, but if you knew --",
        "Delphina: What?",
        "Dorian: Nothing.",
        "Delphina: Oh, you wanted me to tell you?",
        "Dorian: Oh, now why would I want you to do that?",
        "[Delphina sighs]",
        "Delphina: Because you thought you could get to David Vickers before he knew he won the jackpot, and you could use it to your advantage.",
        "Dorian: For goodness sakes, David inherits all of Asa's money. What good would that do me?",
        "Delphina: What is this, a test? You get the last laugh on Clint Buchanan. Ta- da.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Going back to the cottage might force me to remember what happened when my baby was born.",
        "Brody: Sorry I can't go with you.",
        "Jessica: You have your own stuff you're dealing with. Are you still seeing that little Iraqi boy?",
        "Brody: No sightings since last night. Since I saw him without the gun. I still don't know what that means.",
        "Jessica: Why don't you ask somebody who was there? Your friend Wes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You like huevos rancheros? My treat.",
        "Wes: What, you scratch off a lottery ticket when I wasn't looking?",
        "Marty: It's the least I can do. It's not like you asked for some crazy chick to crash at your place.",
        "Wes: It's crazy, hot chick, remember?",
        "Marty: Ah, thank you for that. Well, as of this morning, I'm going to be out of your hair. I just needed a break. I just couldn't handle going back to the place where I was staying.",
        "Wes: You sure you can handle it now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hey, good morning.",
        "Cole: My mom, she didn't sleep here again last night.",
        "Nora: I know. Have you heard from her?",
        "Cole: Uh, no, but I found her anyway. She's staying with some guy at the Angel Square Hotel.",
        "Nora: What guy?",
        "Cole: I don't know. I didn't see him. I just went there to talk to her.",
        "Nora: How'd that go?",
        "Cole: Bad. She, uh, she says she can't live with me anymore.",
        "Nora: Oh, Cole --",
        "Cole: No, it's -- it's no big deal.",
        "Nora: Yeah, it is. It's a huge deal.",
        "Cole: You know, I get it. She hates that she can't remember me, that's all.",
        "Nora: Well, that's not your fault. Did she say that it was?",
        "Cole: I make her life harder than it already is.",
        "Nora: Well, what about your life? You need your mother.",
        "Cole: Seeing her is not that great for me, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Well, I am going to the teachers' lounge. I need a cup of what passes for coffee --",
        "Starr: No, please, you don't have to leave --",
        "Schuyler: Starr, you and I can't have this conversation.",
        "Starr: Because of some what, stupid rule?",
        "Schuyler: No, it's called a code of ethics.",
        "Starr: We're talking. What's wrong with talking?",
        "Schuyler: Okay, what would you like to talk about?",
        "Starr: I liked your mom.",
        "Schuyler: Thanks.",
        "Starr: Why do you feel like you have to apologize to her?",
        "Schuyler: Because I -- because I was pretty messed up.",
        "Starr: What, like on drugs or something?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, on drugs or something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: What were we talking about?",
        "David: Please, forgive me for intruding on your private conversation.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "David: You should be able to talk about whatever you want without interference from the outside world.",
        "Jared: Okay.",
        "David: In my previous life, I would've wanted to know everything you were saying about me. But now, I want only one thing.",
        "Jared: Okay.",
        "David: May I chant over the child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You seem to know an awful lot about David Vickers.",
        "Delphina: Who, us? Huh. Got it all right here. Age, height, weight, turn-ons, turn-offs.",
        "[Delphina chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Do you know how to locate him?",
        "Delphina: Mm-hmm. Yeah, the man you call David Vickers -- yeah, is very far away. Yeah, and also very close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Dr. Levin's bringing a security guard in case Tess comes out and freaks.",
        "Brody: You think she will?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I don't know. Just going back to the place where the baby was born -- if it's too much for me -- sometimes she stays out.",
        "Brody: For how long?",
        "Jessica: After Nash died, she was out for months.",
        "Brody: You have to come back. Okay, Jessica?",
        "Jessica: I'll do my best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: You sure you're okay?",
        "Marty: Well, ready to go home, whatever that means.",
        "Wes: McBain will get off my back, then.",
        "Marty: Why, what happened? Did he come after you?",
        "Wes: He's my new boss now.",
        "Marty: You're kidding.",
        "Wes: I wanted to tell you last night, but you were already sacked out. He just bought the bar where I work.",
        "Marty: I bet you're starting to wish you'd never given me that ride.",
        "Wes: And miss out on a kicking New Year's party?",
        "Marty: Hmm, true. How's your friend, you know, the one you're staying here for?",
        "Wes: Let's just say he doesn't have a whole lot of free time. I didn't mind having someone to break the rules with.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Wes: Oh, sorry.",
        "Marty: No, go ahead, go ahead.",
        "Wes: Hello?",
        "Brody: Hey, man.",
        "Wes: Brody, hey, what's up?",
        "Brody: You think you could stop by At. Ann's today?",
        "Wes: Everything okay?",
        "Brody: I just need to talk about some stuff.",
        "Wes: On my way. Sorry, that was a friend.",
        "Marty: Right.",
        "Wes: Call me anytime.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You think you'd be better off without your mother?",
        "Cole: Where's Matthew? We're going to be late.",
        "Nora: He's already gone. Bo drove him to school.",
        "Cole: He decided to go out for basketball after all?",
        "Nora: No, his father just doesn't want him to take the bus anymore.",
        "Cole: Okay. Well, I guess I better go or I'm going to miss it.",
        "Nora: He would've driven you, but I think that Bo wanted to have a little one- on-one time with Matthew, so --",
        "Cole: Why, what happened?",
        "Nora: I found a joint in his backpack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I am sorry. That was none of my business.",
        "Schuyler: No, it's okay, it's okay. I mean, drugs are a part of my past.",
        "Starr: It's not the reason why she died, though.",
        "Schuyler: I don't know. It could be the reason your baby died.",
        "Starr: What do you mean?",
        "Schuyler: Well, you said she had a lot on her mind, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah. What, do you think that's because of you?",
        "Schuyler: Wait, my mom was a brilliant doctor, but she covered for me a lot. And, I mean, even when I was sober for a while, she still worried, and if something happened, and she was worrying about me, I mean, maybe -- maybe I'm the reason she made a mistake with the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[David chants]",
        "Noelle: That was beautiful.",
        "Jared: Yeah, that was something, all right.",
        "Natalie: Shh.",
        "Noelle: It's like saying a prayer for the baby.",
        "David: You understand.",
        "Noelle: Nothing simpler than prayer.",
        "David: Thank you for the privilege of being this close to the pure soul of a baby. Namaste.",
        "Natalie: What was that?",
        "Jared: He's grateful for the privilege of being this close to the pure soul of a baby.",
        "Natalie: When has David ever been grateful for anything but cold, hard cash?",
        "Jared: I don't know, but he turned down a suitcase full of it.",
        "Natalie: I hate to say it, but if he's faking, he is really convincing.",
        "Jared: I got to find another way to get him out of town before he finds out he's Asa's son.",
        "Natalie: If he doesn't want money, what does he want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Delphina?",
        "Delphina: Mm-hmm?",
        "Dorian: Del-- Delphina?",
        "Delphina: Mm-hmm?",
        "Dorian: Where is David?",
        "Delphina: He's here.",
        "Delphina: And he's not here.",
        "Dorian: Oh, for crying out loud! Where is he?",
        "Delphina: Well, he -- ah, I see. He's here physically. But spiritually, he's on another plane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Matthew had a joint?",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Cole: You sure?",
        "Nora: I've seen them before.",
        "Cole: Well, why'd he have it?",
        "Nora: I don't know, I don't know. I think maybe he's just trying to fit in or -- I don't want you to worry about this, too.",
        "Cole: Hey, listen, Matthew's a good kid. If you want me to talk to him --",
        "Nora: No, that's -- you wouldn't happen to know how he came by it, would you?",
        "Cole: No. Sorry.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Cole: See you.",
        "Nora: Have a good day at school.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You can't think that you're the reason my baby died.",
        "Schuyler: Why not? Did she tell you I wasn't?",
        "Starr: No, she didn't tell me anything about her personal life.",
        "Schuyler: Like I said, she covered for me a lot. You know, when I was young, she used to -- she would tell my dad that she was the one who stole 20 bucks from his wallet or lost her favorite pair of earrings. You know, she should've -- she should've hung me out to dry. She should've taken care of herself, but she didn't.",
        "Starr: So you took her earrings?",
        "Schuyler: I did a lot more than that. I think I broke her heart.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but you got better.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, after I was clean for about a year, I knew her birthday was coming up and I actually went out and I bought her a new pair of earrings. And then before I could give them to her, she killed herself, so --",
        "Starr: I am so sorry.",
        "Schuyler: No, um, I shouldn't be telling you all this.",
        "Starr: It's okay. You --",
        "Schuyler: No, it's not. I'm the teacher, and you're the student, and it's my job to be aware of these boundaries. So, Starr, just go finish your homework or something, okay? I'll see you later.",
        "Starr: Wait, Mr. J. Please, don't go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hi, Marty.",
        "Cole: Hi.",
        "Marty: Hey.",
        "Cole: I'm going to be late for school.",
        "Nora: Uh, Cole, wait a minute -- go after him, go after him. Go, hurry, go, you can catch him.",
        "Marty: I can't.",
        "Nora: What do you mean, you can't? You have to. That's what -- oh, for God's sake, he's your son. Whether you remember him or not, he's your son. And you're supposed to put your problems aside because that's what mothers do.",
        "Marty: Yeah, well, being his mother is my problem.",
        "Nora: Well, you know what? You can do it, because you just have to try --",
        "Marty: I have tried. I tried to be the mother he remembered, and all I could be was this stranger who had to pretend to love him. That's not what he needs. He deserves more than that.",
        "Nora: Really, he deserves more than that? Well, what does he deserve? You tell me, what is it that he deserves? Does he deserve a mother who goes out and shacks up with the first guy she finds?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You know how I see that kid, the one from Iraq?",
        "Wes: So what are you saying? Let it go, war is war, he was out to kill you.",
        "Brody: He said, \"It's a lie.\"",
        "Wes: What's a lie?",
        "Brody: I don't know, but when I thought about everything that happened, when I went over it in my mind, he didn't have a gun. Wes, did I -- did I shoot an unarmed kid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: We're here for you, sweetheart.",
        "Viki: Try not to be afraid, okay? Honey?",
        "Jessica: It's okay, I'm okay.",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Viki: Jessie, are you okay?",
        "Jessica: I'm remembering. I'm remembering Tess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Delphina, David Vickers is in Llanview? Oh, please, please, do not tell me that he knows he's Asa's son.",
        "Delphina: No.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank heaven --",
        "Delphina: Not yet.",
        "Dorian: Not yet? What do you mean, \"Not yet\"?",
        "Delphina: Well, someone else is looking for him, and they say it's -- I'm not going to say that. No, I'm not. Okay. They're saying it's an aquatic rodent.",
        "Dorian: Beaver, Beaver Calhoun. Do you know where Calhoun is? And does Calhoun know that David is in Llanview?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Beaver Calhoun hit a dead end in St. Blaze's.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's good.",
        "Jared: But he has a lead that's going to take him straight to Llanview.",
        "Natalie: Which means straight to David to tell him that he's Grandpa's son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: They're saying he'll be here very soon.",
        "Dorian: I only need a few hours.",
        "Delphina: For what?",
        "Dorian: To get David into bed and then straight to the altar.",
        "Delphina: What? No.",
        "[Delphina laughs]",
        "Delphina: You're going to need a little more time than that.",
        "Dorian: And you call yourself a psychic? No, no, no, no, you don't know David the way I know David.",
        "Delphina: No, but there's something that you don't know about David.",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry, nobody but nobody knows David Vickers like I do.",
        "David: It's David Vickeroshi now.",
        "David: Dorian, Namaste.",
        "Dorian: What happened to your clothes?",
        "David: I'm wearing clothes.",
        "Dorian: I don't see any labels.",
        "David: I've taken a vow of poverty.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: Oh! That is a good one.",
        "David: Dorian, suffering ends when craving ends. I no longer crave.",
        "Dorian: Oh, really? Well, what about --",
        "Delphina: Greed, envy, lust?",
        "David: I've found bliss -- not in the trappings of material goods nor in the pleasures of the flesh, but in a feeling of a clear conscience and an unsullied soul.",
        "[Mouths word]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, what was Beaver Calhoun's lead?",
        "Jared: Tibet.",
        "Natalie: What -- what's the problem? I mean, that's about as far away from Llanview as you can get.",
        "Jared: You don't think someone's going to tell him David was just there and where he was headed when he left?",
        "Natalie: Who in the world would tell Beaver that David left there to come here?",
        "Jared: Listen, if Beaver gets to David before we get him out of town, we're screwed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Nora: Yes, yes, you can. And you have. You made a decision a long time ago that you'd stop acting this way.",
