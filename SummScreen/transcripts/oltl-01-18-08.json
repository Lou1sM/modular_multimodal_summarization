        "Jared: Those are for the actual board members.",
        "Nash: Oh. You're missing a comma in the first sentence. You might want to fix that.",
        "Jared: I think the content speaks for itself.",
        "Nash: Yes, it's slick and pretty and completely void of substance, just like you. When the Buchanans finally prove what an absolute fraud you are and kick you out on your buttocks, you are going to wish that you'd held on to your piece of my little vineyard because you're going to have nothing else left.",
        "Jessica: Well?",
        "Viki: Well, the pilot said we're landing in an hour.",
        "Natalie: That's great. You've called Kevin and Joey and Bree, taken a nap, powdered your nose. There's nothing left to do but talk to us -- is there?",
        "Viki: What, do you think that I'm avoiding talking to you? No.",
        "Natalie: Oh, no -- you're an open book. We emailed, we talked to you on the phone, we talked when you were in Llanview, and somehow you still failed to mention that you were in Paris, Texas, instead of Paris, France, this whole time.",
        "Jessica: And we don't even know what you were doing there in the first place.",
        "Natalie: Oh, and there's this mysterious boyfriend.",
        "Viki: Who?",
        "Natalie: Oh -- don't deny it. Noelle outed you. So, why haven't we met him?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. What's wrong with this guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki was held hostage?",
        "Dorian: Made headlines -- national coverage.",
        "Charlie: Really? National news and I never even heard about it -- is she all right?",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes. Our Viki always ends up all right.",
        "Charlie: What are you talking about? You don't even know my Viki.",
        "Dorian: I have known Viki for a long time, way before she was \"your\" Viki. You see, she's one of my oldest and dearest friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Yeah, I'll just be a minute. Come on in -- oh, hey. Hey, I was just helping Lindsay get squared away. Nora, what brings you by? You're not on the B.E. board.",
        "Clint: Well, we didn't come here on business.",
        "Bo: \"We\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, Sam, I guess I'm as close to a mommy as you have.",
        "Margaret: You're not his mother. I am. And don't you call him \"Sam.\" That's my little Todd Jr. Oh -- T.J.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? I'm just having a nightmare.",
        "Margaret: Oh, no, honey. This nightmare is your life.",
        "Margaret: Come to Mama, Teej. Oh.",
        "Blair: Okay, I've just had way too much coffee, you know? I'm having -- I'm having a -- just a nightmare because Margaret, she -- she's dead.",
        "Margaret: Oh, well, I've been dead before -- resurrected, too.",
        "Blair: Get out!",
        "Margaret: No -- can't. See, you're the one who called me here, Blair. You need me.",
        "Blair: I --",
        "Margaret: And T.J. Needs me, too, because I love him and I want him, whereas you don't.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Margaret: My boy is so -- already so grown-up. Oh, my, look at all those teeth you have!",
        "Blair: Get away. Get out of here! He's not yours! You hear me?",
        "Addie: Blair? What's wrong?",
        "Blair: Mama -- Mama, stay away. That woman over here, she's -- crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Now, what -- what is taking the driver so long?",
        "Dorian: I don't know how far away the gas station is, but I'll tell you, he better be jogging if he wants to keep this job.",
        "Charlie: Viki's been in the news? Like -- I mean, she almost died and I had no idea? She must think I don't care.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no. Viki would never think that.",
        "Charlie: Well -- you know, when I told you about her, when I showed you her picture, why didn't you tell me then that you knew her?",
        "Dorian: I -- I was about to. But then when I realized that Viki herself had not wanted you to know a thing about, you know, who she was or where she came from, I thought, \"well, it certainly isn't my place to tell you if she doesn't want you to know about her 'other life.'\"",
        "Charlie: Right here in Llanview.",
        "Dorian: Ooh. Small world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Okay, in the first place, I was not running away.",
        "Natalie: Keep talking.",
        "Viki: I wanted to find out what was missing.",
        "Jessica: And what was missing?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Viki: I didn't even know.",
        "Natalie: But you found out, didn't you?",
        "Jessica: With a certain blue-eyed someone?",
        "Viki: Oh, boy. You know, I love Noelle, but she's got a big mouth.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. She said that and not a drop more, so spill.",
        "Viki: Why? Sweetheart, you were completely silent on -- in all your emails about that young man you were interested in -- Jared, right? You know, every time I asked a question, you simply avoided answering it.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I must take after my mother.",
        "Viki: Honey, did it end badly because he was a Buchanan or did it just end badly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You don't want me to make you any money --",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Jared: Partner? You're the one that doesn't belong in this family. You know, the Bukes -- they may not like me yet, but they do love some cold, hard cash, and I think they're going to be thrilled to let me make them richer.",
        "Nash: How? You see, I still own 49% of this vineyard. And what the Bukes are going to see is two partners who can't agree on the color of the label, and that is all your pretty little prospectus is going to be good for.",
        "Jared: Oh, good -- a friendly face.",
        "Sarah: Huh. What? What do you want now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Well, if you two aren't here on business, then what is it -- pleasure?",
        "Clint: We've been meaning to have this conversation with you for quite a while, but other things kept coming up.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "Nora: And we wanted to be the ones to tell you so you'd -- you know, before you heard it from someone else.",
        "Bo: Okay. Tell me about what?",
        "Clint: Nora and I are seeing each other.",
        "Bo: So you're \"seeing\" each other, as in \"dating\"?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Although we -- we haven't really had a date yet -- I mean, officially.",
        "Clint: No.",
        "Lindsay: I hope you two will be very happy.",
        "Clint: Well, thank you.",
        "Nora: Right.",
        "Clint: Bo?",
        "Bo: Hmm?",
        "Clint: You okay?",
        "Bo: Yeah, sure -- caught off-guard.",
        "Nora: So were we.",
        "Clint: You know how much both of us care for you, and if you're uncomfortable with this --",
        "Bo: Well, then what are you going to do -- stop seeing each other?",
        "Nora: You don't want us to do that, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki's an heiress?",
        "Dorian: Hmm -- blood of the bluest blue.",
        "Charlie: I mean, a publisher and mother of four, lost a daughter? How could I not have known all these things about her?",
        "Dorian: She didn't even tell you her last name.",
        "Charlie: Well, we just thought that that was the best way.",
        "Dorian: Viki is a -- a multi-faceted person. There are a lot of sides to her, more than you could ever dream of.",
        "Charlie: Well, yeah. Well, who could've -- who could ever believe that the woman described here is just a waitress?",
        "Dorian: Oh -- oh, she's always been very good at dishing it out.",
        "Charlie: It --",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Ba-da-bum -- sorry. Forgive me but, you know, you -- you do know my humor is based on the utmost fondness.",
        "Charlie: Well, why didn't you wake me up when you were watching this -- the hostage situation on TV?",
        "Dorian: Because I was afraid you would go running straight to her.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and what would've been wrong with that?",
        "Dorian: Okay, stop. Right now, I want you to brace yourself, okay, because I'm going to tell you the craziest coincidence of all. This family, these people that your son Jared is bilking -- the Buchanans? The Buchanans, well, comprise Viki's ex-husband and her children.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared and I never got far enough to \"end badly.\"",
        "Jessica: Yeah, finding out some guy is your uncle could put a damper on things.",
        "Viki: So he really is Asa's son?",
        "Natalie: Yes.",
        "Jessica: Maybe.",
        "Natalie: You know he had the D.N.A. test.",
        "Jessica: You're not going to do this.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Jessica: You're not going to get us to talk about Jared.",
        "Natalie: Yeah -- yeah! Good point. Mom, we're not letting you change the subject. This is about you and your boyfriend right now.",
        "Jessica: Ooh!",
        "Viki: Oh, \"boyfriend\" -- it -- it's such an undignified term for a woman my age -- a \"boyfriend\"? Okay, okay, I did meet someone in Paris, Texas, that I thought was a very special person.",
        "Natalie: So what's his name?",
        "Viki: Charlie. Charlie B.",
        "Natalie: Charlie -- be good? Charlie be what?",
        "Viki: Charlie, last name initial B.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- you don't know his last name?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- Noelle didn't make it sound like -- like it was a --",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Jessica: Well, a one-night stand.",
        "Viki: Okay, because it wasn't!",
        "Natalie: Well, I mean, is this guy a criminal? I mean, why does he want to remain anonymous and why would you let him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: To whom are you speaking, Blair?",
        "Blair: Well, she was right here. I --",
        "Addie: Who?",
        "Blair: Uh -- no one. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I scared you, okay, buddy? Sorry.",
        "Addie: Sit down, honey. I can make you some tea.",
        "Blair: Mama, I don't want any tea, I don't. I just want some normalcy. I'm just -- I'm exhausted.",
        "Addie: I'm sure you are.",
        "Blair: I was probably standing right over there sleeping with my eyes wide open.",
        "Addie: But you were yelling. Do you do that in your sleep, too?",
        "Blair: No, Mama, and I'm sorry if I upset you, really.",
        "Addie: Blair, I'm not upset, and I'm not a child. After all you've done for me and all I've failed to do for you --",
        "Blair: But you have not failed me, ever.",
        "Addie: Can't you let me do just one small thing for you now?",
        "Blair: You are doing everything because you're here with me.",
        "Addie: Then let me be really here for you, Blair. Talk to me. What are you really afraid of?",
        "Addie: You said she was crazy.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Addie: Were you talking about me?",
        "Blair: No. Mama, I was -- I was talking about Margaret Cochran, but --",
        "Addie: Isn't --",
        "Blair: I thought she was here.",
        "Addie: Isn't she dead?",
        "Blair: Yes, she is. Now, you know, I'm the one that sounds crazy, right?",
        "Addie: There's nothing wrong with you, honey. You're under an enormous amount of stress. I'd be worried if you were acting as though everything were fine.",
        "Blair: But everything is fine, Mama. Todd has his son home, we're together. Look -- you're here, you're fine, although you are in a bathing suit and fur coat. I mean, I guess I can't sweat the small stuff, right?",
        "Addie: Polar Bear club.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Addie: Very invigorating.",
        "[Blair laughs]",
        "Addie: So Margaret's in your life again?",
        "Blair: No, no. Like I said before, Margaret Cochran is dead.",
        "Addie: But she's Sam's mother.",
        "Blair: Well, she gave birth to Sam, but she's definitely not his mother.",
        "Addie: I know what happened. You must've tried very hard -- your very, very best -- to forget it.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Todd, he just doesn't even want to talk about it.",
        "Addie: He must be working very hard not to think about it now, now that Sam is finally home. Air: I think when Todd sees his son, he just sees a little baby that needs all kinds of love, you know?",
        "Addie: And when you look at Sam, what do you see?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Why would you two think that I'd care if you see each other as long as it's okay with Matthew?",
        "Nora: Well, we're going to talk to him, but we just wanted to tell you first.",
        "Bo: Take a look at this, will you? Here I am -- I'm sharing quarters with your ex-wife and you're seeing my ex-wife.",
        "Nora: Huh.",
        "Bo: I mean, there -- there's another complicated branch on that old wacky Buchanan family tree, huh?",
        "Nora: So -- no big deal, right?",
        "Bo: No, no, no. Look, we've been divorced for a long time. You -- you really were worried that I'd be upset?",
        "Nora: Uh -- no, no. It's just Clint is your brother and -- okay, well, I'm glad we got that out of the way.",
        "Bo: That's right.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Bo: This business is settled. Hey, listen -- I don't want to be late for the board meeting, okay, because I have a little item to put on the agenda that I think you're going to really -- going to enjoy.",
        "Nora: You know, I'm going to -- I'm going to have to shove off myself, too, okay? All right.",
        "Lindsay: Well, wait, Nora?",
        "Nora: Yes, yes?",
        "Lindsay: Could you stick around for a couple of minutes, because I'd like to chat?",
        "Nora: You would?",
        "Bo: Do you think that that's a good idea?",
        "Nora: As long as she doesn't have any scissors.",
        "Lindsay: Oh -- huh. Bo put the scissors away.",
        "Nora: Okay. Well, then, I'll see you at home later, Clint.",
        "Clint: Okay.",
        "Lindsay: And I'll see you when you get home.",
        "Bo: Yep, you sure will.",
        "Lindsay: Okay.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, have a good meeting.",
        "Bo: Okay, yeah, I think we will have a good meeting.",
        "Nora: Okay, okay. All righty, okay.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: Okay, now the men aren't here for you to play that fragile Lindsay act with, so -- give it to me with both barrels. What the hell do you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Can I get a word in here, maybe? So I'd -- I'd been working at the bon- jour cafe for, I guess, about two months. And then one day, this very handsome gentleman came in and he sat down in my section.",
        "Viki: Welcome to the Bon-Jour Cafe, my name's Viki. What can I get you?",
        "Charlie: Oh, hello, Viki.",
        "Viki: Hi.",
        "Charlie: I'm Charlie.",
        "Natalie: So he was your customer?",
        "Viki: Well -- no! He was a customer.",
        "Jessica: Okay, well -- well, how did he go from \"a customer\" to your man friend?",
        "Viki: Okay. He mentioned he was looking for a place to stay in town.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God! You -- you asked this man to move in with you?",
        "Jessica: A complete stranger -- you would've killed us if we had done that!",
        "Viki: No, I did not!",
        "Natalie: Please, please tell us that you didn't sleep with this guy not knowing his last name.",
        "Viki: Since when would that be any of your business?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: No, no. Viki's last name isn't Buchanan. It's -- well, I'm -- it starts with a D.",
        "Dorian: Well, you see, her last husband was Ben Davidson. The husband before that was Sloane Carpenter -- they both died terribly young, so tragic. But she was married to Clint Buchanan for eons -- twice, as a matter of fact -- so, Jared's lie makes him Clint's half brother and therefore uncle to Viki's children.",
        "Charlie: I don't believe this.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, it's unbelievable.",
        "Charlie: Well, but then, Jared isn't really anything to Viki -- I mean, biologically.",
        "Dorian: Jared is lying about who he is and you have agreed to keep his secret. I mean, surely you now see the implications of what you have gotten yourself into.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm starting to.",
        "Dorian: You've got two choices here. You can tell Viki the truth and betray your promise to Jared, or you can lie to Viki and possibly break her heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, I see -- I -- I see a beautiful little boy that needs a stable home and two loving parents.",
        "Addie: That's the answer you practiced for the judge. You're talking to your mother now. Is that really all you see?",
        "Blair: Mama, when -- when this baby cries for his mama, he's not crying for me. He's not even crying for Margaret Cochran. He's crying for Marcie. All Todd thinks about is biology, but that little boy -- all he knows is -- is Marcie. He's just -- it's going to take him time. Time, you know, to -- to adjust.",
        "Addie: So he doesn't remind you of Margaret?",
        "Blair: No. He's an innocent in all this. There's not an ounce of her evil in him.",
        "Addie: There's not an ounce of you in him, either. It -- it can't have been easy to take him in, knowing what you know, how he came to be.",
        "Blair: Well, you know, Todd and I talked about this. I mean, way before we even knew that Sam was with the McBains. I promised Todd that I would help him raise his boy, even if we weren't together, because we make a great -- a great team, all right? I mean, you can say a lot of things about Todd. I mean, we definitely made our mistakes, but we have -- we have terrific kids.",
        "Addie: And so do I. But nothing could have prepared you for what it would be like to hold that little one in your arms, to -- to be alone with --",
        "Blair: You know what, Mama? I can do it. I can do this.",
        "Addie: If you can't, better to say something now than to resent that little boy.",
        "Blair: I -- I don't resent him. It's just going to take me some time to get to know him and -- and to get to love him.",
        "Addie: Are you worried you might not be able to?",
        "Blair: Well, when I thought I saw Margaret here earlier, she said that I hoped that she would take the baby away, that I'd be glad about that. You know, if -- if that's what's real going on in my -- in my psyche, then maybe that's what I really want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You know, let's -- let's dispense with the pretense of civility, shall we?",
        "Lindsay: You didn't like me congratulating you with Clint?",
        "Nora: I didn't like the way you did it.",
        "Lindsay: You didn't think I meant it?",
        "Nora: See? You are not out of it.",
        "Lindsay: I don't want to be your friend, Nora.",
        "Nora: Well, that's a good thing.",
        "Lindsay: But I am going to have to be living here for a while, and since we're going to be seeing each other, I think that it would be good for everybody if we could learn to tolerate each other.",
        "Nora: Okay. How?",
        "Lindsay: You know, I think we'd actually get along pretty well if you would just stop going after all of my ex-husbands.",
        "Nora: And you should stop going after mine. Try not to kill this one, though, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So how did you wind up going out?",
        "Viki: Well, do you want coffee?",
        "Charlie: Nope.",
        "Viki: Okay, well, then if there's nothing else I can get you --",
        "Charlie: Well, actually, um, there is.",
        "Viki: You just said there wasn't.",
        "Charlie: I know, but the thing I'd like is -- um -- I'd like to take a very lovely woman out tomorrow night, and I'd like that lady to be you.",
        "Jessica: And you said yes?",
        "Viki: No, I didn't. I said no! You know, honey -- look, I was not looking for romance in Paris, Texas, okay? I was looking for a clear head, and in my mind, the two just didn't go together.",
        "Natalie: But you changed your mind.",
        "Viki: No, actually, I didn't. Gigi changed my mind.",
        "Natalie: Well, I am sure that Charlie B was very happy.",
        "Jessica: So where'd you end up going for your first date?",
        "[Movie plays]",
        "Charlie: Great.",
        "Viki: Well, you just give it a great big whack. That usually works. No?",
        "[Charlie groans]",
        "Viki: It's all coming back to me now. A broken speaker at the drive-in.",
        "Charlie: Well, that was the excuse a fella used to always give for not being able to watch the movie.",
        "Viki: We could always exchange it for one that does work, you know.",
        "Charlie: I've got a better idea.",
        "Jessica: You kissed?",
        "Viki: No, we didn't kiss. Much better. We talked. We talked and we talked, and we talked. He's -- he's -- he's wonderful. He's very sweet, he's funny, he's smart.",
        "Natalie: Sounds serious.",
        "Viki: But you know, it didn't feel serious. It just felt right.",
        "Natalie: Then why didn't you want us to meet him in Paris?",
        "Viki: Well, that wasn't really an issue.",
        "Jessica: Doesn't he know that you have kids?",
        "Viki: Yes, he does.",
        "Natalie: Well, then what's the problem?",
        "Viki: I don't know where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: If you tell Viki that Jared's your son, there's no way she's going to let him perpetrate a fraud against her children.",
        "Charlie: I wouldn't expect her to.",
        "Dorian: And he'll be disinherited, and go to jail. So, what other choice do you have but to continue lying to her the way you've been lying to everybody else?",
        "Charlie: Well, it's a rock and hard place.",
        "Dorian: I am so sorry that Viki chose not to tell you who she really is. But she did, so now I'm afraid you have a pretty tough choice to make. You can either betray the son you're trying to win back, or lie to the woman you've given your heart to.",

        "Sarah: What do you want from me?",
        "Nash: Your vote is probably the only reason he asked you out.",
        "Sarah: Uh-huh. Well, if that's true, then it definitely backfired. Because now that I know you're my uncle, I look at you and I think -- ew.",
        "Clint: Ah, good afternoon, Patty. Were you able to line up the conference call?",
        "Patty: Yes, they're already on the speakerphone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Good. Bo, wait a minute. You hardly said two words on the way over here.",
        "Bo: I've got a lot on my mind.",
        "Clint: Are you sure that's all --",
        "Bo: No -- look, Clint, I'm fine with you and Nora being a couple, if that's what you are. So don't ask me about it again, okay?",
        "Clint: Bo, I didn't.",
        "Bo: Well, don't.",
        "Sarah: Oh, here's Uncle Bo, guys.",
        "Bo: Hi, Sarah. How are you, Nash? Good to see you two.",
        "Nash: Sir.",
        "Clint: All right, I'm told that we have Kevin, Cord, and Joey on the line and we're already behind, so let's get this thing moving and let the London men go to bed.",
        "Jared: Shouldn't we wait for Jessica and Natalie?",
        "Nash: Oh, didn't you hear? They flew to Texas to make sure their mom's all right. I guess they're not going to make it.",
        "Clint: All right, I call this meeting to order.",
        "Jared: Wait, I think we should postpone until the full board is in attendance.",
        "Clint: Well, the bylaws define a quorum as a majority of the members, and we certainly have that, although I do appreciate your concern for the rules. Now, let's turn our attention to item one on the agenda.",
        "Sarah: Wine. I like.",
        "Nash: Hey, maybe you should've brought samples, since the only way you're going to push through this is if they're drunk.",
        "Jared: Why is he allowed to be here? He's not even on the board.",
        "Clint: Well, as your business partner, he may contribute something to the discussion.",
        "Nash: That, I do, Sir.",
        "Bo: Before we entertain Jared's idea, I'd like to let everybody know that I kept my promise to look into his background. He seems to know everything there is to know about the Buchanans, so I think it's only fair that we know everything there is to know about him. Right, Jared?",

        "Blair: If Todd knew how I felt ---",
        "Addie: If Todd knew you were human?",
        "Blair: I'm a child of rape, Mama. I turned okay, didn't I?",
        "Addie: You're better than okay, thank God.",
        "Blair: I just want to be able to love Sam as much as you love me.",
        "Addie: I've been through a lot of therapy, and here's what I know.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Addie: If you want to love Sam, you have to deal with your doubts and your fears and all your feelings now. If you -- if you push all that down, you're just going to make it so much harder for yourself. You're a wonderful person and a terrific mother, and I know you'll find the love in your heart for that little one. He's very lucky to have you.",
        "Blair: Mama -- I'm the one that's lucky. I'm lucky that I have you.",

        "Nora: Hmm?",
        "Lindsay: I don't care what you think.",
        "Nora: Well, let me tell you, a brief stint making fruitcake with the sisters does not atone for your sins in my book, sister. Hmm.",
        "Lindsay: So you're going to make sure that I do? Is that the idea?",
        "Nora: See? For me, you're not out of it at all. As a matter of fact, you're very sharp.",
        "Lindsay: I was insane when I killed Spencer Truman. Half of Llanview thinks I did them a favor. I'm the one that has to live with what I've done for the rest of my life. And if you don't think that I've been punished enough, well, I guess I'm just going to have to answer to a higher authority. To be honest with you, Nora, I don't really have anything more to lose.",
        "Nora: If you really believed that, you would never have been so desperate as to be seen in public drooling.",
        "Lindsay: You think I was pretending?",
        "Nora: Oh, no, no, no, I truly believe that you are permanently and criminally insane, but you are culpable for your actions. You see, you were never catatonic. And you didn't have a nervous breakdown.",
        "Lindsay: I don't care what you think. Ever since Jen died, I don't care what anybody thinks.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. Not even Bo? And don't you ever, ever throw Jen at me, trying to make me question myself, because it will not work! Oh, and by the way, my son will be visiting here, so I will be watching you. You give him so much as one piece candy after he has brushed his teeth, and I may suddenly go criminally insane.",

        "Jessica: You don't know where Charlie is?",
        "Natalie: Did you break up?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Natalie: What happened?",
        "Viki: Charlie has a son, a grown son. But they've been estranged for years. Totally out of touch. And Charlie has actually spent the better part of last year looking for this son. And he finally found him.",
        "Natalie: So, and he just took off?",
        "Viki: Well, he went to talk to him, yeah. And he asked me to go with him, but I said no.",
        "Jessica and Natalie: Why?",
        "Viki: Because his son is his first priority, and that's as it should be.",
        "Natalie: Okay, but I don't understand why he has to choose. It shouldn't be you or his son.",
        "Jessica: It's your way of staying uncommitted. So you can take the easy way out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki's going to think I'm a louse for not calling her, and now when I finally do call her, I'm going to have to be even a bigger louse and lie to her.",
        "Dorian: Or you could not call.",
        "Charlie: I don't like either option.",
        "Dorian: You know, maybe you should concentrate on your relationship with Jared, the way Viki suggested. That way, given time, the two of you might have a rapprochement, and then you won't have to lie to Viki anymore.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I think I was fooling myself thinking that Jared would want to have anything to do with me at all. No, what do I have to offer that the Buchanans don't?",
        "Dorian: He is your flesh and blood. You love him.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and I disappointed him today, again! I promised him I would be there and I wasn't.",
        "Dorian: He'll understand.",
        "Charlie: What, we ran out of gas? Basic excuse number 32 from way back when?",
        "Dorian: Yes, but in this case, it happens to be true. And it's my fault, and I'm very sorry.",
        "Charlie: No, no. Look -- you were just trying to set me up with a job here, and you've given me a place to stay, and you've been terrific.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Does that mean that you -- you've forgiven me for not telling you the truth about Viki?",
        "Charlie: Hey, like you said, you were just doing it out of respect for your friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Your D.N.A. came back as a match, but the only thing that we really know about you is that you're an ex-con. So it seems like it would be a good idea to do a thorough background check, since we're talking about Pa's legacy, you know.",
        "Sarah: So what'd you find?",
        "Sarah: Nothing?",
        "Bo: No, we could trace Jared's background to a period just before he went to prison but anything before that, nada. I tried to interview several people, but none of them wanted to talk. They just had nothing to say.",
        "Clint: So, then, all we have is Jared's word that he grew up alone with his mother. What was her name again?",
        "Jared: Valerie Banks.",
        "Clint: Oh.",
        "Bo: Well, I was able to dig up someone who could shed some light on all of this. Someone who might have a unique perspective on pa's life -- that period of Pa's life during this period that's in question. Hi, can you come in, please? I'd like everybody to please say hello to Pa's second wife. This is Pamela Stuart.",
        "Pamela: Second unofficially, fifth officially. Depends on how you count.",
        "Clint: Pamela, it's good to see you again.",
        "Pamela: Oh, it is to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm sorry about before, talking and yelling. You must have thought I was a crazy woman. There's only two of us here, you and me, that's it. Just you and me.",
        "Margaret: Don't listen to her, T.J. Of course someone else was here. Your mother is always here to protect you from her. No, I heard it all, Blair, every pathetic word. Poor Addie filling your head with that phony pep talk. \"Oh, my darling. You have so much love in your heart. You're the perfect person. A wonderful mother.\" And you fell for it, didn't you? Ate it all up. Well, reality check, Blair. It was all lies. You will never love my little Todd Jr. Never. Never.",
        "Margaret's voice: Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, it's not that I don't want to see Charlie again. It's that he may have moved on. You know, this -- this whole business with Marcie -- it's been on the national news. If he had wanted to be in touch with me, he'd -- well, he would have been.",
        "Jessica: Well, maybe he just hasn't seen the news yet.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on.",
        "Natalie: Or, Mom, maybe he found out who you really are and he's just, you know, intimidated.",
        "Viki: Well, that's possible, yeah.",
        "Jessica: Well, you should try and find him and make him understand.",
        "Natalie: He's worth putting it on the line for, right?",
        "Jessica: How did he make you feel?",
        "Viki: Revived.",
        "Natalie: How long has it been since you felt that way?",
        "Viki: A long time.",
        "Jessica: Well, then what are you waiting for?",
        "Natalie: Go get him.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Jared's gone?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, when he wasn't answering his phone, I knew he wasn't going to be in the diner anymore.",
        "Dorian: Well, I have the feeling that eventually, things are going to work out between the two of you.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I wish I did. And in the meantime, you're right. I can't call Viki. I mean, you know how you said I was going to have to choose between her and my son? Right now, I just hope that I'm not going to lose both of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pamela: Thank you.",
        "Bo: No, thank you for coming all this way.",
        "Pamela: I'll do whatever I can to help.",
        "Bo: Well, would you please tell the board what you told me on the phone?",
        "Pamela: Oh, of course. Ahem -- I can assure you with absolute certainty that Asa Buchanan never conceived a child with a woman named Valerie Banks.",

        "Cole: We can't talk to you about this.",
        "Cristian: You've always gone after a woman if you wanted her.",

        "Natalie: Maybe you're not really a Buchanan.",
        "Todd: I'd like an explanation.",
        "Viki: For what?",
        "Todd: For why you're not pressing charges against Marcie."
