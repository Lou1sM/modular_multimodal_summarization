    "Recap": [
        "Charlie is distraught and drinking by himself at the bar, knowing he is helpless to do anything about Mitch Laurence. And it just so happens that Dorian is also there, by herself, similarly at wit's end after John and Brody have cornered her about what's going on regarding Mitch and she knows she cannot live in fear of Mitch's threats. She tells Charlie that instead of getting drunk, losing Viki and ruining his life, a better alternative would be for the two of them to kill Mitch. At first Charlie argues but realizes she may be right. He returns to Viki telling her everything is going to be alright, yet doesn't tell her what happened when he was away. Clint is getting closer to Kim. Stacy is worried after Rex has hired Oliver to protect her and the baby. She knows that with that happening, Kyle might very well tell Oliver the secret he promised to keep that the baby could not be Rex's. Not only that, she knows that the baby could very well be Oliver's and he could find that out."

        "Nora: Hey, Viki.",
        "Bo: Good to see you.",
        "Viki: I don't even know where to start.",
        "Nora: Start with what?",
        "Viki: Looking.",
        "Nora: What's wrong?",
        "Viki: Mitch Laurence showed up here a while ago and started in on us.",
        "Bo: Damn.",
        "Viki: And Charlie got so upset. And he left, and I don't have any idea where he went.",
        "Bo: Do you think he went for a drive to cool off?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Sure. That's maybe what he did.",
        "Nora: Oh, you don't even believe that. Okay, what is going on? Come on, talk to us.",
        "Viki: He started drinking again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Uh, double vodka. I don't care what kind. Just keep 'em coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, help me, Mel. Give me a sign. There has to be some lowlife in this dump who can help me kill Mitch.",
        "Man: Hey, where's that drink?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'll get the alarm system upgraded tomorrow, okay? Stacy. Why are you so quiet?",
        "Stacy: Don't think about me!",
        "Schuyler: Well, how am I supposed to do that Stacy when the baby you're carrying isn't even Rex's! It's mine!",
        "Stacy: I'm scared.",
        "Rex: Don't worry. Mitch Laurence is never gonna get his hands on our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What is wrong, Kyle?",
        "Kyle: I hate that Mitch Laurence guy threatening people.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Kyle: I mean, he wants to steal Stacy's baby? That's just messed up.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but come on. That's not what's bugging you.",
        "Kyle: No, it's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music playing]",
        "Gigi: Is something wrong?",
        "Schuyler: Why would you say that?",
        "Gigi: 'Cause you're cutting off my circulation.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, sorry. Sorry. I'm happy to see you.",
        "Gigi: Uh-huh. Did something happen at the hospital?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Yeah, it did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Bourbon and branch.",
        "Clint: I have died and gone to heaven. That is very, very nice. What's the occasion?",
        "Kim: I love to cook.",
        "Clint: Ha ha ha!",
        "Kim: Did I say cook? I love to order--you know, plan menus.",
        "Clint: Well, yeah. Your plan has all my favorites in it.",
        "Kim: Well, I just want to thank you.",
        "Clint: Not necessary.",
        "Kim: I think I'm even ready to try some cheese grits.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Clint: You talk as if it's not food. You put salsa on the grits. They're delicious. You'll love it.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Clint: Where's Nigel?",
        "Kim: Some card game. I'll get it.",
        "Clint: All right. Kim, get rid of whoever it is.",
        "Kim: Yes, boss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You can't guarantee me anything.",
        "Rex: Mitch will not get near you.",
        "Stacy: So you're gonna watch me 24/7?",
        "Rex: You are going to have me or Oliver Fish here every hour until the baby's born.",
        "Stacy: Oliver Fish?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Kyle, what's up?",
        "Stacy: Okay, now that you know, you can't ever tell anyone.",
        "Kyle: Something came up during rounds today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What happened?",
        "Schuyler: I can't tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I wish I could, but I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What, is it some big secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: It falls under doctor-patient confidentiality.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: But you're not even a doctor yet.",
        "Schuyler: I know. It still applies to anything a patient tells me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I'm sorry.",
        "Oliver: Hey, it's okay. You know, there's gonna be police work that I can't discuss with you either. Is there anything I can do to help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I'm sorry.",
        "Gigi: Don't apologize. Nobody wants a doctor who blabs. I'm glad you're following rules. And I trust you. Aah!",
        "Schuyler: Whoa!",
        "Roxy: You need hosing off. How could you do that to Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You know, I am starving.",
        "Rex: Let's order in.",
        "Stacy: Actually, I have a major craving for a veggie panini from Positano.",
        "Rex: I'll call.",
        "Stacy: But they don't deliver. Please?",
        "Rex: I'll pick it up.",
        "Stacy: While you're out, you think you could get me some cheese fries and maybe some churros and maybe a piece of Noelle's key lime pie from Buenos Dias?",
        "Rex: Why not?",
        "Stacy: Thank you.",
        "Rex: You got a linebacker in there?",
        "Stacy: A dancer. They burn up a lot of calories.",
        "Rex: I'm gonna call Fish, see if he can come over while I'm gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I wish I could forget the day I had.",
        "Oliver: Oh, yeah? What did you have in mind?",
        "Kyle: Hmm!",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Oliver: One sec.",
        "Kyle: No, go ahead.",
        "Oliver: Fish.",
        "Rex: Hey, it's Rex. Can you come over for an hour or so?",
        "Oliver: I just got off.",
        "Rex: I'll double your rate for the trouble.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, yeah, okay. I'll be right there. I, um...",
        "Kyle: I heard.",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry. But you know, it's extra cash, and it's keeping Rex's baby safe. It's kind of hard to say no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I need to grab a shower. Do not open the door to anyone.",
        "Stacy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: It's Kim, right?",
        "Kim: Right. I'm your father's executive assistant.",
        "Jessica: And you're Stacy's friend.",
        "Natalie: Yes, the stripper. Are you off to a new gig?",
        "Clint: What's holding up our evening here? Hey! Natalie!",
        "Natalie: Dad.",
        "Clint: Jessie, what a surprise.",
        "Natalie: Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Clint: No, no, you're not interrupting. Kim and I were just about to sit down and have dinner, and we have got plenty of food. Do you want to join us?",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Kim: Excuse me.",
        "[Ring]",
        "Kim: Hey.",
        "Stacy: Kimmy, this whole thing is coming down around my ears. I need you, like, right now.",
        "Kim: Perfect. I'm on my way. I'm so sorry that I have to run.",
        "Clint: Why?",
        "Kim: Stacy's having a meltdown, but I'll come back as soon as I can.",
        "Natalie: Well, don't rush on our account.",
        "Kim: I really hope you're still here. You, wait up for me.",
        "Clint: I will. Well, let's get in there. Let's eat.",
        "Natalie: \"Wait up for me\"?",
        "Jessica: Ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Burying a son, it's... I can't even talk about it. Anybody would want a drink after that.",
        "Viki: Well, I mean, he slipped apparently after Jared's funeral. But then he told me he wasn't gonna drink anymore. You know, so we were here and Jessica and Natalie were with us, and Mitch Laurence shows up. He's out. He's free, you know.",
        "Bo: Yeah, we heard.",
        "Viki: And what that did to Charlie... and there's absolutely nothing I can say to him to make it better. So he left. I wanted to go with him. He said no. He wanted to be alone. And I can't follow him after that.",
        "Nora: No, of course you couldn't. Charlie needs to do this for himself.",
        "Viki: I know. The only person who can stop Charlie from drinking is Charlie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Double vodka.",
        "Dorian: Are you sure you want to do that?",
        "Charlie: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Dorian: Hiding out.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, that really works. You can't hide from what you did, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: No. Nobody can do that, not even in a bottle.",
        "Charlie: What, so now you care about me being sober, huh?",
        "Dorian: I did a terrible thing when I poured that alcohol down your throat.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, but you had your reasons, huh? Well, now I have mine. He came by today.",
        "Dorian: Mitch?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Your old pal. He dropped in, and now Jessica, Natalie, Viki, they're all a wreck by the time he strolled out of there. But he's free to come by and drop in and terrorize them anytime he wants to, thanks to you. So here's to...the woman who put Mitch Laurence back on the street. Here's to your reasons.",
        "Dorian: Charlie, that is vodka.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: You think Viki's not gonna find out that you're drinking it again? I thought you were back on the wagon?",
        "Charlie: Go away, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Do you want to lose Viki?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I cannot believe that Mitch Laurence is walking around free.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Viki: Well, you wouldn't have let that happen.",
        "Bo: No.",
        "Nora: That's why he doesn't have his job anymore.",
        "Viki: Well, if I were mayor, that wouldn't have happened. I think resigning and letting Dorian take over was the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life.",
        "Nora: Okay, your family needed you, Viki, and besides, who in the world would have guessed that Dorian would let Mitch loose?",
        "Bo: No, that's too much, even for Dorian.",
        "Nora: You said that Jessica and Natalie were here. How did they handle seeing Mitch?",
        "Viki: They were amazing. They were very, very strong. They're taking care of each other now, which is bringing them closer than they've been in a long time.",
        "Nora: Oh, that's so nice.",
        "Viki: I think they're actually learning how to deal with Mitch Laurence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So Mitch Laurence just walked right in?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, like he owned the place, talking about his daughter.",
        "Clint: Oh, sweetheart.",
        "Jessica: Oh, and his bride.",
        "Clint: Both of you remember that he has no claims, no rights.",
        "Natalie: We know.",
        "Jessica: I just wanted to see my real dad tonight.",
        "Clint: Well, you got me. Anybody know where Laurence is staying these days?",
        "Jessica: We didn't ask.",
        "Natalie: Why?",
        "Clint: Well, it would be nice if he were in the country somewhere during this busy hunting season.",
        "Natalie: Dad?",
        "Clint: Might look like the back end of the moose. Be an easy mistake to make.",
        "Jessica: And no one would believe you.",
        "Clint: If I shot the sob right between the eyes, I'd be doing everybody on the planet a big favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I'm no good to Viki, at least not the way I am now.",
        "Dorian: And how is that?",
        "Charlie: Full of hatred.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I know that feeling. Drinking is not gonna bring Jared back, and it's certainly not gonna stop Mitch Laurence.",
        "Charlie: Yeah? You got a better idea?",
        "Dorian: Well, as a matter of fact, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: If Mitch Laurence tries to come in, he's trespassing. If he resists, I can use force.",
        "Rex: Good. You hear that? You and the baby are safe.",
        "Stacy: Thanks.",
        "Oliver: I'll guard you like it's my own child.",
        "Rex: I won't be long.",
        "Oliver: Wow. Last time I was here--",
        "Stacy: That never happened. It was a big mistake for both of us, right?",
        "Oliver: Right. If I had known that you were pregnant, I probably would have been too afraid to touch you. I mean, could it hurt the baby if you like--",
        "[Loud knocking on door]",
        "Stacy: Kimmy?",
        "Kim: Yeah, open up.",
        "Kim: Hey, Fish. What are you doing here?",
        "Stacy: Rex hired a guard. Oliver, would you just give us some privacy for a few? We have girl talk.",
        "Oliver: Uh, yeah. I'll just wait outside. Stay away from the windows.",
        "Kim: Oh, my God, I'm so glad you called. The heiress twins showed up just in time for dinner.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I hate those girls.",
        "Kim: Yeah, they're fond of you, too. Oh, the blonde is prissy. The redhead hates my guts. You want to hear the good news? Clint hasn't listened to them so far, so... Stace?",
        "Stacy: No, it's great. Your life's really gonna work out.",
        "Kim: So will yours.",
        "Stacy: Kimmy, it's falling apart. Rex thinks we're having the baby on Valentine's Day, and it's not really till a month later. I should just let Mitch cut me open and take the baby. That's what he would do if he could.",
        "Kim: Okay, settle down.",
        "Stacy: No, no, no. Kyle Lewis heard me talking to Schuyler. He knows the baby's not Rex's.",
        "Kim: No.",
        "Stacy: Yes, and P.S. That guy out there? That's the baby's real father. What do you expect me to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Aah!",
        "Schuyler: Whoa, whoa, whoa!",
        "Roxy: How could you do that?",
        "Gigi: Aah!",
        "Schuyler: Stop!",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God!",
        "Roxy: You were finally together. Fairy tale time.",
        "Gigi: Only it wasn't, Roxy.",
        "Schuyler: No! No! That does not help anybody.",
        "Roxy: It's helping my pitching arm, I'll tell you that! Okay, how about a little highball--",
        "Kyle: Roxy, no! No! No, no! Roxy, no! Stop!",
        "Roxy: Don't stick up for these two.",
        "Kyle: I'm not, okay? I'm not. Believe me. Okay, let me have this, and let me buy you a drink. Okay?",
        "Roxy: I'm not done with you yet.",
        "Kyle: Hey, hey, go get a table. I'll get a drink.",
        "Gigi: Thanks. I'm gonna go dry off. Can you hold fort?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah.",
        "Kyle: If it were up to me, she could throw everything in the joint at you. You've earned it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Okay, let's take one thing at a time. How did Kyle hear about Schuyler?",
        "Stacy: I was at the doctor, and he figured I was lying about my due date.",
        "Kim: Okay. You didn't mention that part.",
        "Stacy: It was just one of those days. Anyway, Kyle's a med student, so he can be lurking or whatever. And Schuyler comes up and goes off about Mitch and his baby's safety.",
        "Kim: Oh, brother.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, Kyle was in both of our faces.",
        "Kim: Okay, not great, but would Kyle have any reason to tell Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, Balsom.",
        "Bo: Hey, you got a minute?",
        "Nora: Go. I'm fine. I'll take care of this.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "[Music playing]",
        "Nora: Did you get ahold of Charlie?",
        "Viki: No. It just goes straight to voice mail. He doesn't want to talk to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Mitch tried to kidnap Stacy.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Rex: He sent in some female flunky with a needle full of something to knock her out. Stacy fought back. By the time I showed up, Mitch was there, too, ready to finish the job.",
        "Bo: He wants them for leverage against you.",
        "Rex: It's worse than that. He says that the baby is the heir to his cult.",
        "Bo: All right, you need protection, Balsom.",
        "Rex: Well, I already hired Fish to watch Stacy when I'm not home. I moved in with Stacy till the baby's born.",
        "Bo: How does Gigi feel about that?",
        "Rex: Couldn't care less. She's already left me for Schuyler Joplin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I hope Roxy's drinking water. Anything harder, and she gets really mean.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, that was the nice version?",
        "Gigi: I deserve it.",
        "Schuyler: Hey, don't.",
        "Gigi: What I don't get is why Kyle's so mad at you. Did you see the looks he gave you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I gave that guy a roof over his head, let that skank Stacy bunk with him for free. I should have kicked his butt out.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, but you should have kicked me out, too, and you didn't. You have a good heart, Rox.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, and I got half a brain. But it worked out. You've got my back.",
        "Kyle: Yes, I do. But I also cannot afford bail, so please just don't throw any more stuff.",
        "Roxy: I know it's a mess, but it's 'cause of that baby.",
        "Kyle: What?",
        "Roxy: See, that's why Gigi and Rex broke up. None of this would have happened if Stacy wasn't carrying Rex's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I don't think Kyle would tell Rex about the baby. He wants to be a doctor. The last thing he needs is to be in the middle of another mess with me.",
        "Kim: Oh, yeah. He helped you pass the stem cells off as yours, right, when Shane was sick.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, he also tried to blackmail Jared and Natalie. I don't think Rex would believe him even if he did say something.",
        "Kim: Then we're fine. As long as Kyle never finds out his boyfriend's the daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, Nora, thank you, but you don't have to hang around. I don't want to ruin your whole evening.",
        "Nora: Are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Viki: Why would I do that?",
        "Nora: Are you angry at me because I left Clint?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'd shoot the man outright, but it would be a shame for anybody to go to jail for killing Mitch Laurence.",
        "Jessica: Is this what you sit around and think about?",
        "Natalie: Don't you?",
        "Jessica: I think we need to find better things to focus on.",
        "Clint: Sweetheart, I've been working on that.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. We were--",
        "Jessica: If you want to see Bree--",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah.",
        "Jessica: Because she was just learning how to ice skate, and she wants to show off.",
        "Clint: Well, bring her over. The sooner the better. The moat's frozen, you know. We could sit around and watch Bree skate rings around us, literally. Ha ha! What?",
        "Jessica: Nothing. You just seem so much better than when we saw you at mom's.",
        "Clint: Which time?",
        "Natalie: When you were spitting nails about Bo and Nora.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah.",
        "Jessica: We're just worried about you, Dad.",
        "Clint: Well, don't you two waste a minute worrying about me. I'm all right. In fact, I'm planning on having fun again.",
        "Natalie: Really?",
        "Clint: Oh.",
        "Natalie: What were you planning on doing tonight?",
        "Jessica: Natalie.",
        "Natalie: What? He said he was gonna wait up for Kim.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, and you guys are working late.",
        "Clint: Uh, no. Kim lives here now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Kyle's the least of our problems.",
        "Stacy: Unfortunately, yes.",
        "Kim: So, what's the biggest? Mitch and that stealing-my-baby, lead-my-cult [Indistinct]?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I know it's scary, but it's what made Rex pay attention. And that's heaven but such a problem because he won't let me go away and have this baby alone somewhere.",
        "Kim: So no wiggle room on the due date.",
        "Stacy: Oh, not one bit.",
        "Kim: Okay, so, you'll give birth late. It happens.",
        "Stacy: Not 4 weeks late.",
        "Kim: Yeah, I guess that's pushing it. Okay, so I'll make sure you give birth on time.",
        "Stacy: Well, not if it's gonna hurt the baby.",
        "Kim: There's gotta be a way around that.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Kim: Where's your computer? We'll look it up online.",
        "Stacy: Is there any way we can look up a way to kill Mitch Laurence without leaving a trail?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Of all the gin joints in all the world...",
        "Dorian: Oh...ha ha! It was a sign. It's fate. You're at the end of your rope. I'm at the end of mine.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, great. Then we can hang together.",
        "Dorian: Indeed. Really. We can solve this problem if we work together, but we can't do that if you crawl into a bottle.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, so, what do we do instead?",
        "Dorian: Well... you could kill Mitch Laurence.",
        "Charlie: You want me to kill Mitch Laurence, your buddy?",
        "Dorian: He's no friend of mine.",
        "Charlie: Well, you made sure that he went free.",
        "Dorian: Mitch Laurence is dangerous. He's the most dangerous man I've ever met.",
        "Charlie: Wait a second. He's got something on you?",
        "Dorian: I don't give a rat's ass what he does to me.",
        "Charlie: Then it's something else, then, huh? Your family? Did he threaten the Cramer girls? Hmm?",
        "Dorian: You repeat this to anybody, and I will call you a drunken liar. But yes. Charlie... he tried to destroy my family the same way he tried to destroy yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, Nora, your life is your business.",
        "Nora: Yeah, but you still think what I did to Clint was pretty lousy.",
        "Viki: Yeah. It was pretty lousy. On the other hand, he was very well aware of the fact that you and Bo were still very close. And he talked to me about it a whole bunch of times before your marriage. And if I'm not mistaken, you were pretty close to stopping that wedding.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I just wish I'd had the strength to do it. Maybe Clint wouldn't be so angry with me now and wouldn't be acting the way he's behaving. I'm very worried about him.",
        "Viki: Well, he's gonna need time to lick his wounds, you know.",
        "Nora: Oh, he's got somebody else to do that for him.",
        "Viki: Oh?",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. Cute little pole dancer from Las Vegas young enough to be his daughter.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Nora: Uh-huh. I got shoes older than her.",
        "Viki: No, no, no. Nora. I mean, are you sure that Clint and--who is she?",
        "Nora: Kim. Kim. Kimmmmm.",
        "Viki: Are you sure that... they're together?",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. She moved into the mansion with him, moat and all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Kim lives here?",
        "Clint: Natalie, she needed a place to stay.",
        "Natalie: Isn't she living with her little friend Stacy?",
        "Clint: For some reason, Stacy had to move out of her place. It's not that big a deal.",
        "Jessica: So, she's, like, a roommate.",
        "Clint: House guest.",
        "Natalie: This is... this is...",
        "Clint: This is what?",
        "Jessica: It's so soon, Dad. And we know that you're hurting.",
        "Natalie: She's an ex-stripper!",
        "Clint: Interpretive dancer.",
        "Natalie: Whose best friend is a slut that tricked Rex into getting her pregnant. I mean, she's...",
        "Clint: She's a gold-digger who's looking for a sugar daddy. I know that.",
        "Jessica: You do?",
        "Clint: I'm not blind, and this is not my first rodeo. Of course I know what Kim is. I saw her coming a mile away.",
        "Jessica: Then why...",
        "Clint: Because I saw her coming a mile away.",
        "Jessica: I guess that makes her less dangerous.",
        "Clint: She's fun. And you know what, she is surprisingly helpful at work. She charms the chaps out of all those good old boys I have to work with at B.E. all the time.",
        "Natalie: Well, I guess that is her specialty.",
        "Clint: Natalie, what would you like me to do? Wander around the place in my pajamas and slippers crying in my bourbon over big, bad Nora?",
        "Jessica: No one wants that, Dad. No.",
        "Clint: No, including me. It's okay. I don't mind getting my kicks from a young lady who makes me laugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Okay, early labor. Way easier than perfect murder.",
        "Stacy: You sure about that?",
        "Kim: Made you smile. Okay, you can walk. No, wait. You have to already be having contractions. Castor oil can induce labor by causing intestinal spasms.",
        "Stacy: Ooh, no, that sounds nasty. Plus, it could hurt my little girl. What?",
        "Kim: You really care about this kid.",
        "Stacy: Yeah.",
        "Kim: Okay. That's what I'm talking about.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Kim: Drugs. Oxytocin.",
        "Stacy: Drugs?",
        "Kim: Yeah, they give it to mothers in the hospital to induce labor all the time. Causes uterine contractions. Says it's perfectly safe.",
        "Stacy: Oh.",
        "Kim: And a good thing we know someone in the hospital who can hook us up with some.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: This whole thing reeks.",
        "Schuyler: I know.",
        "Kyle: Roxy's over there talking about how excited she is to be a grandmother, and I'm standing there knowing it's not her grandchild.",
        "Schuyler: Kyle, I don't like it either.",
        "Kyle: Then tell the truth.",
        "Schuyler: When it's the right time.",
        "Kyle: Okay, you're never gonna own up to this, are you?",
        "Schuyler: Kyle, I'm trying to stop the woman I love from ending up with the wrong person. You know what that's like, don't you, Kyle?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Last I heard, Gigi was doing some thinking.",
        "Rex: Yeah, she found other things to do with Schuyler.",
        "Bo: I'm sorry, Balsom. I wish I had known.",
        "Rex: There was nothing that you could have done. Gigi and I were rocky, but we were dealing. Then Mitch started his comeback, and everything crumbled.",
        "Bo: So that's another thing he's gonna have to answer for.",
        "Rex: No. Actually, I'm better off without Gigi. If you ask dear old dad--",
        "Bo: No, no, no. Don't ever refer to him as that.",
        "Rex: Mitch says this clears the way now for me to join his cult.",
        "Bo: It's unbelievable.",
        "Rex: The good news is he doesn't seem to have an interest in Shane. Thank God, because I can't be there every day to watch him now.",
        "Bo: Are he and Gigi still living at the carriage house?",
        "Rex: Yeah. I didn't want to rip up his life any more than we had to. And Viki will probably add security now with Mitch on the loose.",
        "Bo: You can count on that.",
        "Rex: Now I can concentrate on keeping my baby safe.",
        "Bo: I'm sorry that this is what you have to think about right now.",
        "Rex: Mitch is not getting my child. If he makes a move toward Stacy, I will kill him with my bare hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: What exactly did Mitch do to your family?",
        "Dorian: My daughter survived, but it was awful.",
        "Charlie: You mean Langston?",
        "Dorian: I don't want to talk about it. Let's just leave it.",
        "Charlie: Well, then, how the hell could you let the guy out of jail?",
        "Dorian: Because I had to buy time with him.",
        "Charlie: Well, he was already in the lockup.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but he was going to get out with or without my help. Bo can't keep him in jail. John McBain can't keep him in jail. Nothing. This is going to work, and you and I both know it. In fact, we may be the only 2 people in this town not afraid to face the truth. Nothing's gonna stop Mitch Laurence as long as he's alive.",
        "Charlie: So... you want me to do your dirty work and kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Dolores, foothill division. Call the number, take out a restraining order against Laurence.",
        "Rex: And you think that'll work?",
        "Bo: No, but it does give you some legal coverage if you have to use deadly force against him. Now, do you understand?",
        "Rex: Yeah. You think I can get that past Commissioner Lowell?",
        "Bo: That's why you bypass headquarters. This way, it will go directly to Nora at the D.A.'s office.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Bo: All right. And if Laurence shows up--",
        "Rex: Call the police.",
        "Bo: After you call me.",
        "Rex: Got it.",
        "Bo: Anytime, Balsom. I'm always gonna be there for you. Remember that.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: If we put our heads together, we can find a way to kill Mitch and get away with it.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, or I can go over your head and go straight to the authorities.",
        "Dorian: And what happens then, best case scenario?",
        "Charlie: Mitch gets thrown in jail.",
        "Dorian: And he gets out again.",
        "Charlie: It never ends, does it?",
        "Dorian: Unless we put an end to him permanently.",
        "Charlie: I... kill him.",
        "Dorian: I want peace. I want my family to be safe, the same way you want yours to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What if Schuyler won't help us?",
        "Kim: He doesn't want Gigi to hear the baby's his. He'll be happy to see you deliver early.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, but not if it's gonna hurt the baby.",
        "Kim: Would you read this? It's a perfectly legitimate medical drug. Okay? And Schuyler works in the hospital. He can get his hands on some and make sure the baby's delivered safely.",
        "Stacy: But not too soon.",
        "Kim: Okay, they said at the 8th month, the lungs are fully developed, so anytime after that we're fine. In the last month, the baby just hangs out in there and gets fatter and gives you bigger stretch marks. Look. Look at the numbers. There's zillions of babies that have come out like this. It's fine. So unless you want to tell Rex the truth...",
        "Stacy: Okay. Sounds--",
        "Kim: Perfect.",
        "Stacy: Valentine's Day, I'm gonna meet my new baby...with Rex.",
        "Kim: You're gonna get everything you want. Maybe I will, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: We want you to be happy, Dad.",
        "Clint: But?",
        "Natalie: Can't it be with someone your own age?",
        "Clint: Just tried that. Didn't work out too well.",
        "Jessica: And you're hurting.",
        "Clint: Damn right I am. And being with Kim takes away some of the sting.",
        "Natalie: And how does she do that?",
        "Clint: I can draw you a diagram.",
        "Natalie: Oh, God.",
        "Jessica: Dad, come on.",
        "Clint: I could. I could draw you a diagram.",
        "Natalie: He's so messing with us, thank God.",
        "Jessica: And we thought you were such a nice man.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well.",
        "Natalie: So, you two aren't, you know, sharing a...room?",
        "Clint: Not yet.",
        "Jessica: Who do you like for the Super Bowl this year, huh?",
        "Natalie: I'm loving the weather. I'm loving the weather right now.",
        "Clint: I haven't had as nice an evening as this in ages.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, Clint's a big boy. He can take care of himself.",
        "Nora: Yeah, but he's just bouncing.",
        "Viki: Well, Nora, you made your choice, you know, and so Clint has made his choice. And now I have to face the fact that Charlie has to make his own choices.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You know, my late husband Mel was a recovering alcoholic. He would say things like...\"stick with the winners. Don't quit before the miracle.\" He'd never forgive me if I helped you drink again.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, your sudden concern for my drinking is real touching.",
        "Dorian: I have my reasons.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, you always do. That's one thing I can trust. And you also always love to see Viki suffering.",
        "Dorian: Not at Mitch Laurence's hands.",
        "Charlie: Oh. Great. If you could use me to do it, then...",
        "Dorian: Viki would never hear about this from me. I can't talk about you without betraying myself.",
        "Charlie: Something makes me think you'd find a way.",
        "Dorian: Fine. Drink up. Yeah. And you keep drinking until you lose everything, including Viki. Like, why don't you just drink yourself to death? Or... you could kill Mitch and you could save everybody that you love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Can we give you a ride home, Viki?",
        "Viki: They're about to close, aren't they?",
        "Nora: Yes.",
        "Viki: I think I'm gonna stay and wait a little longer.",
        "Nora: Well, you know what, we can stay with you.",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Nora: Yeah. No, I'm not gonna let you go home alone.",
        "Viki: I won't be alone. Okay? Jessica and Natalie are both at home. I won't be alone.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Viki: Thanks.",

        "Clint: Oh, yes, yes. Please do that.",
        "Kim: Hey, sorry I missed dinner.",
        "Jessica: It's okay. It was good. You did a very good job.",
        "Kim: Thanks.",
        "Jessica: How is Stacy?",
        "Kim: You know, she's hitting the finish line, so her hormones are going all nuts, but she's fine now.",

        "Oliver: It's just security work.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, it doesn't make it any less dangerous.",

        "Kyle: It's not just up to you, Oliver.",
