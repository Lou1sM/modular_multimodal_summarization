        "Starr: That's what you said at the jewelry store.",
        "Cole: I know. I still say we should go back. I mean, your dad did give you that check.",
        "Starr: There's no way I'm spending all of this money on one necklace.",
        "Cole: Okay. I do believe that the instructions were for you to buy whatever you want.",
        "Starr: But my dad went overboard this time, even for him.",
        "Cole: Yeah. I can't really blame him. I mean, I understand him wanting to spoil your only daughter.",

        "Kim: Hello? Earth to Stacy.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Kim: I'm sending Nigel out for some Rodi burgers. Do you want the usual -- triple decker maximized?",
        "Stacy: No, no. I'm not hungry.",
        "Kim: Aren't you supposed to be eating for two? Oh, God, you're not gonna start throwing up again, are you?",
        "Stacy: No. It's not morning sickness. I just can't think about food at a time like this.",
        "Kim: Like what? What's wrong?",
        "Stacy: Everything.",
        "Kim: Is this about pushing up the due date? Because even if Schuyler can't get his hands on the oxytocin, we'll figure out another way.",
        "Stacy: No, no. It's not that.",
        "Kim: Then what is it?",
        "Stacy: I'm gonna die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Kyle: I'm saying we can't jump to conclusions.",
        "Oliver: Are you kidding?",
        "Kyle: Okay. We don't know anything yet, Oliver. Deal with this like it's one of your cases. What would you do if you got brought a bunch of evidence and it could mean a lot of different things?",
        "Oliver: Track down every lead. Try to figure out the truth.",
        "Kyle: Okay, so that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna sort through the evidence, and we'll find out the truth.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, which could be that I'm a few weeks away from becoming a father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, man, what can I get you?",

        "Markko: Aw, come on. You're off the clock.",
        "Cristian: What are you doing here, anyway? Shouldn't you be spending the day with birthday girl?",
        "Markko: Yeah. We were shorthanded, and I could use the extra money -- you know, birthday presents, things like that.",

        "Blair: What, did something happen between you and Ford?",
        "Langston: No. No, at least I don't think so. Okay. You see, last night, Markko and I were -- having sex, and all of a sudden out of nowhere, I thought about Ford.",

        "Langston: I'm a virtual slut.",
        "Blair: You are not.",
        "Langston: I don't want to cheat on my boyfriend. I love Markko.",
        "Blair: I know. I heard you.",
        "Langston: Well, then I shouldn't be having sex with him and thinking about another guy.",
        "Blair: What, you think you're the only person in the world that's ever done that?",
        "Langston: Other people do that?",
        "Blair: People do it all the time.",
        "Langston: Have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I explained to her, Todd. Daniella understands you're her father.",
        "Todd: How could you do this?",
        "T\u00e9a: What? Listen. Listen to me. Listen.",
        "Todd: We had an understanding here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I know that we did.",
        "Todd: So, what's changed?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it's complicated.",
        "Todd: Did you not say that you thought that Dani needed time to heal?",
        "T\u00e9a: She does.",
        "Todd: Well, how does telling me that I'm her father gonna help her?",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen.",
        "Todd: It's not. It's gonna make things worse. No. Wait. You listen to me. Just listen to me for a second. She hates me. We both know that. I killed her father. She thinks I'm evil.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm, not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Okay. Time to find out about the straight goods on Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: How can this be happening? I slept with Stacy once.",
        "Kyle: Could've been a lot worse.",
        "Oliver: Worse than getting her pregnant?",
        "Kyle: Yeah. You didn't use protection, Oliver, so yeah.",
        "Oliver: I was wasted.",
        "Kyle: Oh, God, and that makes it better?",
        "Oliver: No. I know. Kyle, I know it was dumb, but she said it was taken care of.",
        "Kyle: Come on, Oliver. You believed her?",
        "Oliver: Oh, how could I have been such an idiot?",
        "Kyle: Okay. Okay. Let's just stick to the facts. When, exactly, did this happen?",
        "Oliver: The night before I came out.",
        "Kyle: Hate to say it, but --",
        "Oliver: You don't have to. The timing is right.",
        "Kyle: She's telling Rex that the baby is due in February when it's actually due in March.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's mine.",
        "Kyle: Oliver --",
        "Oliver: She said that she had sex with Schuyler, too, right?",
        "Kyle: Apparently.",
        "Oliver: So, then maybe it's actually his, or -- you know what? -- Maybe it's neither of ours. She was trolling for a baby daddy. Who knows how many guys she slept with that week?",
        "Kyle: She did make a move on me.",
        "Oliver: See?",
        "Kyle: She was really desperate, too. She even tried to use her friend Kim to sweeten the deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Since when are you the grim reaper? I told you, oxytocin is totally safe.",
        "Stacy: No. It's not that. It's this.",
        "Kim: Okay. What are you doing with a will?",
        "Stacy: Rex's lawyer gave it to us to fill out.",
        "Kim: Is he trying to scare you to death?",
        "Stacy: He's trying to be a good father.",
        "Kim: Yeah, by convincing you you're gonna die?",
        "Stacy: I will someday.",
        "Kim: Yeah, when you're, like, 100 years old.",
        "Stacy: But, Kimmie, it's different with Mitch in the picture. Rex just doesn't want him to be able to take the baby if something happens to us.",
        "Kim: Okay, so who gets little nipper?",
        "Stacy: Rex wants Jessica and Natalie.",
        "Kim: What? Those bitches are gonna turn your kid into some whiny little goody two-shoes.",
        "Stacy: I know. I want somebody who's gonna raise my little girl like I would.",
        "Kim: Somebody to teach her to love fast cars and fast men?",
        "Stacy: Someone who's gonna keep me alive in my baby's eyes, the real me, someone like you.",

        "Blair: Sweetie, everybody has fantasies. It happens all the time.",
        "Langston: Yeah, except it shouldn't happen when you're in bed with your boyfriend.",
        "Blair: Okay. Well, let's talk about that boyfriend. Now, is sex with Markko maybe not so --",
        "Langston: Oh, no ,no, no, no. It's great.",
        "Blair: It is?",
        "Langston: Yes, so I guess thinking about Ford makes me a total nympho.",
        "Blair: No. It does not make you a nymphomaniac, okay? Just stop right there. The only problem that I could foresee is if you were actually interested in Ford. Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I forgot that you guys are roommates now.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. How do you guys know each other again?",
        "Markko: Oh, we used to work together.",
        "Ford: Markko did camera on David Vickers' reality show. I was a producer.",
        "Markko: Yeah. The show never made it to air.",
        "Ford: Oh, but now he's taking a film class at L.U.",
        "Markko: Ford is a T.A. That's a teacher's assistant.",
        "Ford: It's a big day tomorrow, first class. I hope you've started reading.",
        "Cristian: Ooh, then you better not stay out late tonight.",
        "Ford: Oh, big night?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Langston and her friend Starr are having a double birthday party at Capricorn.",
        "Ford: Oh, yeah. I've been meaning to check that place out.",
        "Markko: Oh, man, you know, it's too bad it's a private event.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. It's a good thing I run the place. I can always get a roommate in.",
        "Ford: Yeah?",
        "Cristian: Definitely.",
        "Ford: No. I couldn't do that, I mean, unless it was okay with Markko.",

        "Todd: So, you don't think it's a problem that Dani knows the truth, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not anymore, I don't.",
        "Todd: I don't believe this.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, believe it. Dani is ready to meet you as her father.",
        "Todd: What did you do? Did you take her for some electroshock therapy?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what I did, Todd.",
        "Todd: You did something, didn't you, because last time I saw her, she was ready to kill me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, like I said, things changed.",
        "Todd: Yeah. A few days ago, we weren't gonna see each other anymore, and she was never gonna forgive me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, a few days ago, Dani had reason to not forgive you. She thought you had killed her father.",
        "Todd: What do you mean, she thought I killed her father?",
        "T\u00e9a: Dani can't hold that against you anymore because Ross is alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, would you ever give Hope a check like this for her 18th birthday?",
        "Cole: Well, hopefully, by then, I'll actually have a job.",
        "Starr: Stop.",
        "Cole: Well, I want to give her everything. Don't you?",
        "Starr: Yes, and we can, but it just might be hard for my dad.",
        "Cole: What, now that you're an adult?",
        "Starr: Yeah. When I was a kid, I counted on him. Whenever I needed something, he gave it to me.",
        "Cole: And now you don't need him.",
        "Starr: It probably seems like a good thing.",
        "Cole: But he is your dad.",
        "Starr: So, it's okay, how he treats you?",
        "Cole: Oh, well, you're worth it.",
        "Starr: Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I think he would do the same thing to anyone else.",
        "Cole: Anybody who's dating his daughter.",
        "Starr: Well, he feels like he needs to protect me, just like you want to protect Hope.",
        "Mitch: Pity. No matter how hard we try, we can't always protect our loved ones from the evil in this world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella and I -- please move your legs; thank you -- told Ross that we would not tell anyone he was alive.",
        "Todd: You're telling me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I couldn't let you keep thinking you'd killed a man, Todd. What are you thinking?",
        "Todd: Thinking of calling the cops, actually.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't call the cops.",
        "Todd: Uh, he was about to take a swan dive off a bridge with our daughter. He's dangerous, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: So are you, and I've defended you from the first minute I met you because I always knew you were more than just your flaws.",
        "Todd: My flaws. It's an interesting choice of words.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, that's what they are, right? We all have them, human beings. We're not perfect. Look. Ross is not going to come after us again.",
        "Todd: How can you be so sure?",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't be. I'll tell you this. Face charges if he does.",
        "Todd: That didn't stop him before.",
        "T\u00e9a: He understands that we don't have a chance anymore, Todd. He understands we can't be a family anymore. Ross is the one who explained to Daniella that you're her father. He wants her to get to know you.",
        "Todd: Ross does?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. He's the one who convinced her to come here. You have him to thank for another shot at being your daughter's father.",

        "Oliver: This baby could be anybody's.",
        "Kyle: It also means it could be yours.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but when I found out Stacy was pregnant, I asked her if I was the father.",
        "Kyle: You did?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, and she said that it was Rex's.",
        "Kyle: Except she'd already lost Rex's baby and she has to make him believe that this one is his.",
        "Oliver: Okay, so then it has to be Schuyler's.",
        "Kyle: Why?",
        "Oliver: Because that's the only thing that makes any sense. Why tell Schuyler it's his kid if it isn't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You would be perfect.",
        "Kim: To take care of a baby?",
        "Stacy: Yeah. Why not?",
        "Kim: Well, what about Gigi?",
        "Stacy: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Kim: She already has a kid. She probably still has the, you know, instruction manual.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, and she hates me, and she'd turn the kid against me. You know what, she wouldn't even want it. She'd leave it on somebody's doorstep.",
        "Kim: So, maybe she picks someone good.",
        "Stacy: I don't want anybody Gigi picks. I want you. You're the closest thing I have to a real sister.",
        "Kim: Oh, Stace.",
        "Stacy: I know. Mostly, you're the only person I trust.",
        "Kim: I love you, honey --",
        "Stacy: I love you, too.",
        "Kim: And I would do anything for you. I would lie, cheat, blackmail. I'd even pimp for you --",
        "Stacy: I know.",
        "Kim: But I draw the line at diapers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Stacy doesn't do anything that isn't good for Stacy, so she has to have a really good reason to tell Schuyler this is his baby.",
        "Oliver: What, other than the fact that it actually is?",
        "Kyle: She wants Rex to believe that this kid is his, so why would Schuyler cover for her?",
        "Oliver: I don't know. You know, Kyle, I don't know what to believe. All I keep thinking is that I could have a baby.",
        "Kyle: I know.",
        "Oliver: What am I gonna do?",
        "Kyle: I know what we're not gonna do is panic.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. I think it might be too late for that.",
        "Kyle: Listen to me. We're gonna deal with this together, okay, no matter what we find out.",
        "Oliver: Okay.",
        "Kyle: So, what's the first step, Officer? How do you deal with a lying, scheming bimbo?",
        "Oliver: Head on.",

        "Starr: Mitch Laurence --",
        "Cole: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Mitch: I'm just spreading the word of God to the masses, for those who seek deeper meaning amidst the abyss of consumer culture.",
        "Cole: Well, we're not interested.",
        "Mitch: You're obviously in need of spiritual guidance, two lost souls such as yourselves with a baby born out of wedlock.",
        "Starr: Hope is the best thing that ever happened to us.",
        "Mitch: Well, we could hardly expect better, given your upbringing -- your mother the town tramp, your father a rapist --",
        "Cole: Shut your filthy mouth.",
        "Mitch: But you would honestly defend Todd Manning?",
        "Cole: Yes.",
        "Starr: Just don't. His words can't hurt us.",
        "Mitch: That's true. It was her father who hurt your mother, hmm?",
        "Cole: I said shut up.",
        "Mitch: Once he had sullied her, her life was ruined forever.",
        "Starr: Aah!",

        "Blair: I heard you.",
        "Langston: He's my best friend. I mean, you know, he opens doors for me, and he always asks me how my day was and my opinions on things. When I get really tired, he rubs my feet until I fall asleep. He's it.",
        "Blair: I believe you.",
        "Langston: Good.",
        "Blair: So, you have nothing to feel guilty about about what happened.",
        "Langston: Right, except I can't stop thinking about Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Sure. Come to the party.",
        "Ford: No. No, thanks. I can't.",
        "Markko: Aw, hot date?",
        "Ford: Yeah, actually, with the syllabus. The professor says I got to plan next week's seminar.",
        "Cristian: So, do it tomorrow. Come on. It'll be a cool party.",
        "Ford: What do you think?",
        "Markko: Me?",
        "Ford: Yeah. I mean, would it be weird if I came?",
        "Markko: No. No. It's not weird at all. In fact, you can be my guest.",
        "Ford: Sure Langston won't mind?",
        "Markko: Why would she mind? There's gonna be so many people, she won't even know you're there.",
        "Ford: All right. It's a date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: What is my problem? I mean, he is just some guy with a hot body.",
        "Blair: Well, Langston, sometimes that's about all you need.",
        "Langston: He's also got good looks and a killer smile.",
        "Blair: Ooh, that doesn't hurt, either.",
        "Langston: But so what? A lot of guys have that. That's never been enough for me.",
        "Blair: Will you listen to me? You are gonna be attracted to other guys, even though you still love your boyfriend.",
        "Langston: So, what am I supposed to do?",
        "Blair: Nothing.",
        "Langston: Nothing?",
        "Blair: As long as you know who you love, you're gonna be okay.",
        "Langston: Well, I just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again.",
        "Blair: Well, the only advice I can really give you on that one is, maybe just stay away from Ford.",
        "Langston: Right. Well, it shouldn't be too hard. I don't really have a reason to see him. Do you think I should tell Markko?",
        "Blair: Absolutely not.",
        "Langston: Why?",
        "Blair: Well, because you tell Markko, that's all Markko is gonna be able to think about, is you and Ford.",
        "Langston: Yeah. He kind of already does.",
        "Blair: All right, so you want to make him feel any more insecure than he already is? Tell you what. It'll be our little secret, okay?",
