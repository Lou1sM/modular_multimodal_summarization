        "Cristian: All right, so, tell me -- what do you think?",
        "Antonio: That you left your manhood in the shower?",
        "Cristian: Green or blue?",
        "Antonio: It's a shirt.",
        "Cristian: It's a date.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, with a girl you've known for how long? I mean, you work with her, you've lived with her --",
        "Cristian: And now I'm going out with her, which is a lot more than I can say for you. How long have you known Talia? How long have you worked with her? You can't even get her on the phone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Cole: So we have to do this group thing every week?",
        "Langston: Sitting in that room with, what -- what was her name, Marla?",
        "Cole: Marla, yeah. Yeah, she was the one that was talking about how she got forced into -- to going to the mall.",
        "[Cole chuckles]",
        "Langston: How weak is that?",
        "Cole: Man. Then there was that basketball player and --",
        "Langston: Talk about sad.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Just -- this whole thing is just really pathetic, you know?",
        "Langston: Huh. Are we -- oh. Guess we must be -- pathetic?",
        "Cole: No. No, it's just the situation. I mean, look at what we're talking about. It's good, right? No, I mean, I'm glad I said what I did.",
        "Langston: Me, too.",
        "Cole: But it is depressing.",
        "Langston: People die and you don't?",
        "Starr: Mom, I'm home! Hey, Mom, are you -- oh. Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Hey, there, gorgeous. You okay?",
        "Lindsay: I'm fine. You could've called.",
        "R.J.: Why? Is Bo here?",
        "Lindsay: No, but he could be here any minute.",
        "R.J.: Well, then there's no problem. We don't have to hide.",
        "Bo: Pamela is Pa's ex-wife, so maybe she would be able to tell us whether Jared is Pa's son?",
        "Pamela: As I said before, Asa never conceived a child with Valerie Banks.",
        "Jared: Uh -- I'm sorry, but I grew up with Valerie Banks. She's my mother -- that's a fact. And as for the rest of it, how exactly would you know that Asa and my mother never conceived a child together?",
        "Natalie: Sorry -- the airport was backed up.",
        "Clint: All right, that's all right, come on in. Natalie, sit here, Jessie, over there. How is your mother, and speak up -- we got the boys on a conference call.",
        "Natalie: Hi. No, she's fine. She just needed her meds.",
        "Jessica: She's at home. She flew in with us. Pamela Stuart.",
        "Natalie: What's she doing here?",
        "Bo: Pamela was kind enough to fly in and meet with us and tell us everything she knows about Jared's claim that he's a Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Todd!",
        "Todd: Hi.",
        "Viki: Hey. Come in. I didn't know you were back.",
        "Todd: Yep.",
        "Viki: What's up?",
        "Todd: I'd like an explanation.",
        "Viki: For what?",
        "Todd: For why you're not pressing charges against Marcie for holding you hostage.",
        "Viki: Why aren't you at home with your new son, hmm?",
        "Todd: I -- he and Blair are bonding.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Todd: Don't change the subject.",
        "Viki: I'm not changing the subject. Your new son's homecoming is the subject, or at least the point.",
        "Todd: No. I just got a call from my people in Paris and they told me you weren't pressing charges.",
        "Viki: Well, that's true.",
        "Todd: So, this woman holds a gun to your head and gives you a heart attack, and you're just going to let her go off?",
        "Viki: Okay, it was not a heart attack and she never held a gun to my head.",
        "Todd: Oh, so it was no big deal.",
        "Viki: I never said it wasn't a big deal.",
        "Todd: Well, what are you saying?",
        "Viki: I'm saying that Marcie has suffered enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Nothing for me.",
        "R.J.: Well, we've got to toast.",
        "Lindsay: Toast to what?",
        "R.J.: We're safe -- I mean, unless Bo bugged the place, which I wouldn't put past him. Hmm -- club soda?",
        "Lindsay: Oh.",
        "R.J.: To getting away with it.",
        "[R.J. chuckles]",
        "Lindsay: R.J.!",
        "R.J.: Oh, come on, now. You just spent, what, six months at St. Ann's and weeks before that in lockup? You fooled the cops, your attorney, the judge, the doctors -- all of them. Very impressive. I'm proud -- you're audacious.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I don't know if that's exactly a compliment.",
        "R.J.: Oh, now, that is high praise. You know, we haven't had two minutes alone like this since before you were arrested, which is reason enough to celebrate. And I, for one, want to say it out loud -- you popped Spencer Truman. You punched his ticket, and you got away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What are you talking about, man? I talked to her this afternoon -- you were there.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I know. You talked about how you can't get together.",
        "Antonio: Well, she -- she works nights, and weekends.",
        "Cristian: Okay, so that only leaves, what, another hundred hours a week?",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah? Well, I -- I also have a job, okay? And if -- if you include the hours I put in at Capricorn -- not to mention that I love spending time with my daughter --",
        "Cristian: Oh, right. It's simple, just say it -- you're giving up.",
        "Antonio: You know, how did we get off of your love life and on to mine?",
        "Cristian: You don't have a love life, and you never will if you don't get off your nonproactive ass and go after the girl. You know what? Maybe she's not worth it.",
        "Antonio: No. Of course she's worth it.",
        "Cristian: Then what's the problem? I mean, come on -- you've always gone after a woman if you wanted her.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, maybe I've changed. That one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Your mom's upstairs with Sam.",
        "Cole: Yeah, we just got here.",
        "Starr: How did grief counseling go?",
        "Cole: You know about that?",
        "Starr: Yeah, Markko stopped by. He told me about it.",
        "Cole: It -- I -- I would've called, but Nora kind of sprang it on me at the last minute.",
        "Langston: Yeah, same here. I mean, Dorian was basically shoving me out the door --",
        "Starr: No, no -- it's okay, it's fine. I just want to know how it went. So did -- did everybody talk?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: About the people that they lost, right?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: So, how was it?",
        "Langston: Well, how -- it was -- it was fine.",
        "Starr: Okay, but -- but you guys feel better about it, right, so it's working?",
        "Cole: It -- it's -- it's fine.",
        "Starr: Is that all that you guys can say?",
        "Langston: They have these rules and they want us to talk, so --",
        "Cole: They -- they have -- they have this saying, \"what happens in the room stays in the room,\" which means we can't talk to you about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, what's going on?",
        "Bo: Pamela says that there's no way that your grandpa had a baby with Valerie Banks.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Jared: Whoa, don't look at me. Pamela and I just met, and how she knows anything about my mother --",
        "Pamela: The first time I was married to your grandfather, he was leading a double life -- as Captain Jeb Stuart.",
        "Bo: Yeah, that's a long story but the bottom line is that when Jared was conceived, Pa would've been on an island with Pamela.",
        "Natalie: And you're sure about that?",
        "Pamela: Asa never had a child with Valerie Banks.",
        "Natalie: So, maybe the D.N.A. testers were wrong -- maybe you're not really a Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You guys can't talk to me?",
        "Langston: No, we can talk to you, just not about what goes on in grief counseling.",
        "Cole: Yeah, about the other people, what's said.",
        "Langston: Yeah, it's supposed to be confidential.",
        "Cole: Yeah, so that they don't tell their friends about us.",
        "Starr: Yeah -- no, right. Um -- it makes sense.",
        "Cole: Starr, it's really not that big of a deal.",
        "Starr: It's fine, I understand. I -- as long as it works, right?",
        "Langston: Well --",
        "Cole: So, what's going on? Why'd you come running in here?",
        "Langston: Yeah, where -- where were you?",
        "Starr: Oh, um -- well, you guys aren't going to believe this, but my dad -- he took me to the D.M.V. to get my license. He bought me a brand-new car today.",
        "Cole: Wow, that's cool.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: On the same day that you got your license?",
        "Starr: Uh-huh. I drove the car home and everything -- it's in the driveway.",
        "Cole: Well, why'd your dad buy you a car? I mean, I know he can afford it and everything, but still --",
        "Starr: Well, he's been promising me since I was 12 that the day I turned 16, I could go --",
        "Langston: Oh, my God -- Starr, your 16th birthday. I -- I completely forgot.",
        "Cole: Me, too.",
        "Starr: Yeah, no, it's okay. Everybody kind of did. But it's fine -- a lot of stuff has been going on. It's -- it's no big deal.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me, Starr? That's a huge deal. I -- I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I don't think you've changed. I think your life has changed.",
        "Antonio: Well, yeah, it's changed for the better and wait -- well, just wait till you have a kid and you'll understand.",
        "Cristian: No, no, no, no. Don't put this on Jamie -- she loves Talia. Listen, Antonio, you got to stop letting stupid stuff like schedules get in the way of something good. Talia has been nothing but there for you. Listen, man, I know how it is, you know? It took me a while to get over this thing with Evangeline, but you know what? I'm getting there, I'm starting something with Sarah.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, and look how nervous it's making you -- you can't even pick out a shirt.",
        "Cristian: So I'm nervous -- so what? The point is I'm showing up, and you know why? Because the girl's terrific, and she had the guts to tell me how she felt. The least I can do is meet her halfway. Antonio? You've been divorced twice, you have a kid, a mother that doesn't back off, and you work a job that can get you killed every damn day. How many girls do you think will line up for that?",
        "Antonio: Thanks.",
        "Cristian: Just telling it how it is.",
        "Antonio: No. You're going to wear that?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Why not?",
        "Antonio: It's wrinkled.",
        "Cristian: So? I'm an artist.",
        "Antonio: Translation -- slob.",
        "Cristian: Thanks.",
        "Antonio: I'm just telling it like it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: And you're willing to swear that Asa Buchanan and Valerie Banks never had a child?",
        "Pamela: Absolutely.",
        "Clint: Did you know Valerie Banks?",
        "Bo: No, she said that they never met.",
        "Pamela: No, no. I said that Asa never met. I knew Valerie Banks very well. Valerie was -- my sister.",
        "Bo: Your what?",
        "Jessica: You're kidding!",
        "Bo: You know what? We talked on the phone, Pamela, for a long time. You never mentioned any of this.",
        "Pamela: Because you just wanted to know where Asa was when. I didn't realize what you were really asking until you brought up Valerie.",
        "Bo: But you never said she was your sister!",
        "Pamela: Because I realized I had to talk to you -- all of you! Especially you, in person. I'm sorry, Bo. I didn't really mean to just mislead you.",
        "Clint: Bo, if she is Valerie's sister, it stands to reason she'd have a pretty good idea if she were involved with Asa.",
        "Pamela: Asa was never involved with Valerie! They never even met!",
        "Bo: All right, then -- so Jared's claim --",
        "Jared: Whoa, Bo -- I didn't make any claim. This was all your father's doing, remember?",
        "Pamela: Actually, Jared has every right to have a claim.",
        "Clint: And why do you say that?",
        "Pamela: Look, nobody knew better than I do about how much Asa loved his freedom, especially on the open sea. I mean, he always said to me all the time how perfect our life was together, just the two of us. Then I got pregnant, I thought I would lose him. And so when I had the baby, I gave him to my sister.",
        "Sarah: Uh -- hold on, I'm a little lost. If Jared isn't Asa's son, then what --",
        "Pamela: Oh, no, no. Jared is very much Asa's son. I know that for a fact because I'm his mother.",
        "Jared: My - mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: To you -- you rid the world of Spencer Truman, and the part I like best, you got away with it. I mean, you pulled the same crazy rabbit out of the same damn hat and nobody noticed.",
        "[R.J. chuckles]",
        "Lindsay: Just you. Nobody can know that I'm faking it this time -- you do know that, right?",
        "R.J.: Your secret's safe with me.",
        "Lindsay: You are a good friend.",
        "R.J.: Oh, Lindsay, we're more than friends. We're more like -- soul mates.",
        "Lindsay: We think a lot alike.",
        "R.J.: Mm-hmm, which is why I knew that you were faking.",
        "Lindsay: Why didn't you turn me in?",
        "R.J.: Well, I hate visiting you here at Bo's but I much prefer it to the penitentiary, so you better be careful.",
        "Lindsay: I haven't seen the papers yet today. Is there any word on Marcie?",
        "R.J.: Well, as far as I've heard, she's still in Texas, in jail.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, God, tell me that Michael has Tommy.",
        "R.J.: Well, Marcie turned the boy over to Manning before they took her into custody.",
        "Lindsay: You mean this was all for nothing?",
        "R.J.: No. No, I wouldn't say that. You did stop Blair from being raped or murdered.",
        "Lindsay: But that's not why I did it and you know it. And I would do it all again if I thought that I was helping Marcie.",
        "R.J.: Well, let's just try to help you, hmm?",
        "Lindsay: What do you mean?",
        "R.J.: Well, you've got a target on your back.",
        "Lindsay: I was found innocent by reason of insanity. They can't charge me twice.",
        "R.J.: Well, if I know Nora -- and I do -- I'm re she'll try to find some way around that.",
        "Lindsay: In order for her to do that, she would have to prove two things -- one, that I was not insane when I killed Spencer Truman, and, two, that I was faking it.",
        "R.J.: Well, she already knows you weren't insane. She just can't prove it.",
        "Lindsay: What do you mean?",
        "R.J.: Well, you -- you might've fooled Bo, but you haven't fooled Nora. She's coming after you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Marcie has suffered? I see. So, she kidnaps my son and she drags him around for months and I have no idea where he is or if he's alive, and Marcie's suffered?",
        "Viki: What Marcie did was wrong -- it was very wrong. However, it's over. You have your son back and that's all that matters, and I think you should focus on that and just forget about vengeance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Okay, fine. I'll -- I'll wear this one.",
        "Antonio: You're going to show up in a wrinkled shirt?",
        "Cristian: So I'll throw it in the dryer.",
        "Antonio: What's that going to do?",
        "Cristian: Well, it heats it up, then you put it on and, you know, things smooth out.",
        "Antonio: Do you have an iron?",
        "Cristian: Of course I have an iron. I use it to remove wax off my canvases.",
        "Antonio: Well, great. Then you can clean it off and you can iron your shirt. You do know how to iron a shirt?",
        "Cristian: Mami irons all my shirts.",
        "Antonio: Oh. Where's your iron?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I know that Nora's coming after me. She has as much as said it, but she doesn't have anything.",
        "R.J.: No, well, not yet. Well, she's not going to give up, especially not with you living here with Bo.",
        "Lindsay: Well, that wasn't my idea and you know it.",
        "R.J.: Oh, you just better be careful. She'd do anything to prove to Bo that you were lying.",
        "Lindsay: She's dating Clint.",
        "R.J.: Does not matter.",
        "Lindsay: I'm not going to slip up.",
        "R.J.: You did with me.",
        "Lindsay: I was in St. Ann's, I was exhausted. My guard was down.",
        "R.J.: No, the point is Bo isn't that stupid. If I could see through your act --",
        "Lindsay: There is no more act. There's no more act. I've recovered -- remember? Do you still hang out with Nora?",
        "[R.J. chuckles]",
        "R.J.: Well, we see each other.",
        "Lindsay: Could you put a word in for me?",
        "R.J.: Hmm -- that's not going to help. Not even Bo could turn her around, and if Bo figures out that you were lying, he'll turn you in himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pamela: Valerie was a mother to you in every way that really counts. And I know that she loved you from the bottom of her heart. But, yes, Jared -- I gave birth to you.",
        "Jared: But she would've said something.",
        "Pamela: And risk losing your love -- I don't think so.",
        "Jared: Uh -- she never mentioned you and she never mentioned having a sister.",
        "Pamela: Well, it can get complicated with sisters. We didn't get along very well until I asked her to take you, and then we decided that it would be better for me to stay out of your life. But, oh, she talked about you. She told me about how you lost your first tooth on a candy apple at Halloween, had your little red bike with a black stripe on it, and how your first dog was called \"Jagger\"?",
        "Jared: Anyone could've told you that.",
        "Pamela: Valerie told me that. We talked every Sunday night after dinner.",
        "Jared: That was her friend from college.",
        "Pamela: We both went to Ohio State.",
        "Clint: Natalie, excuse me. Boys, this has gotten out of hand. I'll call you back when we get it sorted out.",
        "Bo: I think that it's hard to believe that Pa would go along with this.",
        "Pamela: Well, obviously, he changed his mind. Otherwise, why would he put that letter in the will?",
        "Clint: Pamela, why come forward now after all these years?",
        "Pamela: The truth is I never was going to come forward. But after Bo told me about the letter and the will, I realized it was time. I owed you that much. Look, I'm not looking r your love or your forgiveness. I just wanted you to know that it's true -- you're Asa's son. And when all is said and done, obviously he wanted our child to be part of this family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Bo is the commissioner of police. If he figures out that you knew what you were doing when you stabbed Spen--",
        "Lindsay: He won't figure it out.",
        "R.J.: And you won't tell him?",
        "Lindsay: Why would I do that?",
        "R.J.: Well, living here, you start getting comfortable. You start thinking maybe you can trust him.",
        "Lindsay: I'm never going to be that comfortable.",
        "R.J.: Or maybe your conscience starts getting to you, and you confess.",
        "Lindsay: I won't confess.",
        "R.J.: Or you just say something, and he starts to suspect.",
        "Lindsay: He doesn't want to suspect me; he wants to believe in me.",
        "R.J.: Ah. Why? Because he's in love with you?",
        "Lindsay: No. I mean, he cares about me.",
        "R.J.: And you care about him?",
        "Lindsay: Oh, I'm so grateful to him. He has been so supportive and caring.",
        "R.J.: Oh. There's that word again.",
        "Lindsay: Well, what word do you want me to use, R.J.?",
        "R.J.: I want you to be careful.",
        "Lindsay: I will.",
        "R.J.: Why didn't you just plead self-defense? I mean, you could've said that you were trying to save Blair and Spencer turned on you.",
        "Lindsay: Because John McBain found my dress that had Spencer's blood on it. He figured out that I was visiting Spencer the day that he was murdered. Nora would've been all over that. It was not a safe bet.",
        "R.J.: Well, you just better hope that Bo never sees through your bluff.",
        "Lindsay: Or I'll lose everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Valerie Banks is my mother and I loved her, period. As for the rest of it, Asa's letter and you claiming that Asa gave his kid away -- it means nothing to me.",
        "Pamela: And the fact that Valerie kept a scrapbook with all of his newspaper clippings?",
        "Jared: She used that to inspire me to stay in school and how do you know about that scrapbook?",
        "Bo: Pamela, I'm not buying it.",
        "Pamela: I don't blame you. And that's why I brought this.",
        "Jared: And what's all that?",
        "Pamela: Oh, it's a picture of you a few days old and a lock of hair. You can have it tested if you'd like.",
        "Natalie: Okay, for crying out loud, you guys, Jared is Grandpa's son and the more you try to prove that he isn't, it's -- it makes it much worse. Please, case closed.",
        "Pamela: I'm sorry, Jared. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's just that Valerie was so desperate to have a child and I was afraid I w going to lose Asa. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Look, my business card is in there and -- well, you can call me sometime if you'd like. I would love to hear from you. Oh. Your mother would have been so proud of you.",
        "Sarah: Next? I'm sorry, I don't mean to rush everyone, but we're here on B.E. business and I've got a date. So, are we going to vote on this vineyard thing or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You're hired.",
        "Antonio: No, you're learning, okay? First you do the collar. And then, do the part for the buttons, all right?",
        "Cristian: Who taught you how to iron?",
        "Antonio: Jessica did, by never doing it. The girl had a servant her entire life.",
        "Cristian: No wonder she left you. That was a joke.",
        "Antonio: Yes, I know. You're about six months away from being funny.",
        "Cristian: Wow, six months, huh? That's -- that's progress. A month ago, you would've burned my shirt.",
        "Antonio: Well, a month ago --",
        "Cristian: You hadn't fallen for Talia.",
        "Antonio: I haven't fallen for her. I like her.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, well, you know what they say -- \"un clavo saca al otro.\"",
        "Antonio: \"One nail drives out another\"?",
        "Cristian: Of course, for that to work, you'd have to actually see the girl.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, Cris, the reason I didn't start up with Talia was because I didn't want to use her to drive out memories of Jessica.",
        "Cristian: All I'm saying is the girl makes you laugh. And you know what? It's about time.",
        "Antonio: Wait.",
        "Cristian: It's fine, man. I put it on; it's going to wrinkle, anyway.",
        "Antonio: Huh. You're welcome.",
        "Cristian: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Sarah has a point. I'll get the boys back on the conference call.",
        "Nash: Well, Bo, I guess now we'll vote on B.E. buying my vineyard, huh?",
        "Jared: Our vineyard.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jared: Now, I have emailed all of you the proposal in its entirety. The packets that I've placed in front of you are a summary, including a linear timeline representing the growth of the domestic wine market over the past 20 years, franchise opportunities nationwide, and the projected growth rate over the approaching fiscal year. In short, I believe the vineyard is a lucrative opportunity for B.E.",
        "Nash: And a great turnover for you. You buy low from Antonio and sell high to B.E.",
        "Jared: At a fair price and you will be compensated.",
        "Nash: Whoo-hoo.",
        "Clint: All right, the London Buchanans are back on the line, so let's get this moving.",
        "Jared: Perfect. Shall we bring it to a vote?",
        "Jessica: Before we do -- um -- I would just like everybody to know that I have watched my husband turn this vineyard from nothing into turning a steady profit, and that's why I agree with Jared. And I urge you all to vote yes. Let's buy the vineyard.",
        "Nash: So it came to a vote and you're taking his side?",
        "Jessica: Nash -- it -- you'll still be able to run the vineyard and this way, you'll be capitalized.",
        "Nash: What if I don't want to be \"capitalized\" by your family's company, huh?",
        "Jared: That's two \"yes\" votes. Anyone else?",
        "Jessica: Nash, wait, wait, wait. Nash, wait, please --",
        "Nash: There is nothing -- nothing you can say that'll make me less angry. Nothing. I'm leaving.",
        "Jessica: But --",
        "Clint: So there's two \"no's\" and an additional cautious \"yes,\" Natalie?",
        "Natalie: No. No. Not now, not ever.",
        "Clint: Thank you. Sarah?",
        "Sarah: Well, I'm an Indie girl, so small trumps big in my world. My vote is \"no.\"",
        "Bo: My vote makes it five.",
        "Clint: Jared, your motion's been denied.",
        "Sarah: We all set now?",
        "Clint: Yes, we are -- for today.",
        "Sarah: Great. Thanks, guys.",
        "Natalie: Have fun.",

        "Todd: I just can't believe you're trying to make me feel bad for wanting Marcie punished.",
        "Viki: No, wanting revenge is going to make you feel bad. I don't know why you would do that to yourself. Sam isn't going to thank you because he loves Marcie.",
        "Todd: That's nice.",
        "Viki: Well, he does. It's true -- he loves Marcie and she loves him.",
        "Todd: You know, I don't know why I ever come to talk to you about these kind of things. What'd you just do? You just ditched me and went to work in some greasy spoon restaurant with a bunch of misfit losers.",
        "Viki: Excuse me, the Bon-Jour Cafe is not a greasy spoon --",
        "Todd: I don't care about the stupid diner!",
        "Viki: Okay, and my friends are not \"losers.\" They are wonderful, warm, caring people who happened not to have been born rich.",
        "Todd: Well, why the hell don't you go back there, then? Maybe you could -- if you leave now, you could make the breakfast shift!",
        "Viki: I will go back -- to visit. But I belong here.",
        "Todd: I'm glad to hear that. So why don't you please just call the Paris police chief and tell him you're going to press charges after all?",
        "Viki: No, I can't do that.",
        "Todd: You can't, or you won't?",
        "Viki: I won't.",
        "Todd: Fine. Just let that kidnapper get away with what she did to my son, and to me, and you. And just stab me in the back. Yeah. There's nothing new there, anyway, so --",
        "Viki: I beg your pardon?",
        "Todd: Is Miles Laurence still living in the back?",
        "Viki: Oh, Todd --",
        "Todd: Don't \"Todd\" me. That's not going to change a thing.",
        "Viki: No, you're right, it's not. For some idiotic reason, I'm always going to love you.",
        "Todd: Then why are you helping Marcie in this?",
        "Viki: I'm not doing this for Marcie, I am doing this for Sam! Todd, listen to me, if that child is going to have even a chance at a normal life, the people around him are going to have to start behaving like enlightened adults. That kid has been through enough, you know? Three families in two years? He was lucky -- lucky that Michael and Marcie adopted him. They loved him. They took wonderful care of him. He is the happy, sunny, bright, smiling child that he is because of them and you know that! If you're so interested in payback, why don't you pay Marcie back for that? She saved your son's life.",

        "Starr: No, no, no, it's okay. Look, Cole, all I care about is that you get through this, okay? Your life has been turned upside down, and I know how hard this is for you. It must be hard for you to just get through this day. And I really -- I really am glad that you and Langston are going to this whole group therapy thing.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I guess. But you're going to have to let me make this up to you.",
        "Starr: Well, I have a closet that needs organizing.",
        "Cole: I've got a better idea. Is your dad home?",
        "Starr: No, I think he went to my Aunt Viki's, why?",

        "Cristian: I'm not. Okay, I am. But you know, I'm just -- I don't know -- I'm just worried about the stupid stuff, like do I have enough gas in my car? Am I going to drive too fast? You know, take it light? Get stopped by a cop?",
        "Antonio: What did you just say?",
        "Cristian: Nothing, nothing. I just -- I want to make sure I don't screw this up, that's all.",
