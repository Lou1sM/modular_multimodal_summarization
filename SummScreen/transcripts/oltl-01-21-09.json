        "Blair: Oh, no. What do you want?",
        "Todd: Something wrong?",
        "Blair: Nothing I care to discuss with you, Todd. Why are you here?",
        "Todd: I want to see the kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: This is ridiculous.",
        "Nora: You know, principals are very busy people.",
        "Bo: Don't make excuses for the woman. She's putting off dealing with us.",
        "Nora: Maybe. Or maybe she's running late.",
        "Bo: My guess is that she doesn't want to answer questions as to why the son of the police commissioner and the district attorney is buying drugs at her school.",

        "[Knocking on door]",
        "T\u00e9a: Mr. Joplin, may I come in?",
        "Schuyler: You know, it's been a long day.",
        "T\u00e9a: We spoke on the phone. I'm T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "Schuyler: I know. I know who you are. Starr Manning told me you're defending her father.",
        "T\u00e9a: That is correct.",
        "Schuyler: On attempted kidnapping charges.",
        "T\u00e9a: And your mother was Starr's doctor. I'm sorry for your loss.",
        "Schuyler: Thank you.",
        "T\u00e9a: This will only take a minute. I was just wondering if your mother ever said anything to you about Todd Manning or Starr's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You're not into this, are you?",
        "Starr: No, I am. I've just been through a lot lately.",
        "Langston: I know you're always thinking of your baby.",
        "Starr: Always. Okay, everything sucks right now.",
        "Langston: Everything as in?",
        "Starr: For one thing, I ran into my dad at Hope's grave. And he wants me to forgive him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hi.",
        "Gigi: Hi -- need this?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Gigi: You know, you're really going to wish that you hadn't made me come here. Because I've been on my feet all day and I have a really big blister. And no offense, but all I want to do is kind of just go home and have a glass of wine and soak my feet.",
        "Rex: Well, we can have wine. And we'll do a toast.",
        "Gigi: To?",
        "Rex: To you, for having the brilliant idea of getting Puddle of Mud here, which brought in enough money for us to bring in your favorite band.",
        "Gigi: Hmm?",
        "Rex: Oh, you need a hint?",
        "[Humming]",
        "Gigi: Uh-uh. Nuh-uh. What? The Plain White T's? They're playing here? Tonight?",
        "Rex: Right. But you know, I mean, if you're too tired, then --",
        "Gigi: Oh no, Balsom, baby. I can dance all night long. Cheers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If the kids are here I'd like to see them, if I may.",
        "Blair: No, you may not. I have full custody of the kids. Shaun's in the kitchen. All I have to do is call him and he'll throw you out.",
        "Todd: I'm not here to cause any trouble.",
        "Blair: You know, for months you didn't give a damn about your kids. Now suddenly Marty dumps you because you can't ride off into the sunset with Starr's baby and you want to be father of the year. Is that it?",
        "Todd: No. I ran into Starr at Hope's grave and we talked. And it made me realize how much I miss her and how much I need my kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bo grunts]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Bo: What is it, Matthew?",
        "Matthew: Look, Dad, I know you're mad at me, but can I please go out, just tonight?",
        "Bo: Wha -- are you kidding me? You're grounded.",
        "Matthew: I know, but --",
        "Bo: There's no buts. Grounded means you don't go anywhere.",
        "Matthew: Look, my favorite band is playing at Rex's club. There's no way I'll get into trouble there, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: What are you doing tonight?",
        "Cristian: Nothing.",
        "Vanessa: Lola's going out. We have the place to ourselves again. Should we -- I'll take that as a yes.",
        "[Vanessa laughs]",
        "Cristian: Maybe we should be more careful when Lola's around.",
        "Vanessa: Oh, she knows we're together for reasons more than immigration. She's fine with it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Vanessa: Now no one can deny we belong together.",
        "Markko: Hi, I'm here to pick up Lola.",
        "Vanessa: Where's Langston? If you think I'm letting Lola go out alone with you, you'd better think again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I'm really sorry I couldn't hang out when you got back from the cemetery last night. Lola was freaking out about this letter she got from my uncle.",
        "Starr: It's okay.",
        "Langston: So what happened?",
        "Starr: Well, I wanted to spend some time at Hope's grave. And apparently my dad did, too. He was there and he was saying some pretty intense things to her.",
        "Langston: Like what?",
        "Starr: Like how he was sorry. He was sorry that he wanted to take her away from me. And it just made me feel kind of bad for him.",
        "Langston: Bad enough to forgive him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Did your mother ever mention anything?",
        "Schuyler: I'm sorry, why talk to me about this?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it would be very helpful to know if your mother ever mentioned anything about Todd or Starr Manning.",
        "Antonio: Don't say another word. I'm Detective Vega. You answer to me first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So, why are you here, Todd, really? T\u00e9a tell you to pop in and pretend to be a decent dad before the trial?",
        "Todd: No, T\u00e9a did not tell me to come here. This has nothing to do with my case.",
        "Blair: Why the sudden turnaround? I mean, Marty is certainly not here.",
        "Todd: It has nothing to do with Marty. It has to do with them, with my kids, my family.",
        "Blair: Yeah, right.",
        "Todd: Honestly, it's mostly about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Langston just asked me to pick up Lola because it was on my way.",
        "Vanessa: You take her straight to the club, no side trips.",
        "Markko: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Lola: Hi.",
        "Markko: Whoa, going somewhere?",
        "Lola: I'm just moving my stuff downstairs so these guys can get the bedroom.",
        "Cristian: Thanks for being so cool about it.",
        "Lola: Sure, no problem. Oh, Markko, let's go. I don't want to be late. You guys have a good time.",
        "Cristian: You were pretty tough on Markko there.",
        "Vanessa: I'm probably overprotective of Lola, especially now.",
        "Cristian: Do you think she's upset about us?",
        "Vanessa: No, no -- it's not that. But there's definitely something bothering her. Maybe it was our talk.",
        "Cristian: What did you talk about?",
        "Vanessa: Whether or not to trust T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm entitled to question him.",
        "Antonio: That may be true, but not before I do. I was sent by the D.A.'s office.",
        "T\u00e9a: Some other time. And remember, you have the right to remain silent.",
        "Antonio: Always a pleasure, Ms. Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Igualmente, senor.",
        "Antonio: Do you mind if I call you Schuyler?",
        "Schuyler: Not at all.",
        "Antonio: Great. Schuyler, I'm not here to arrest you. I just need you to answer a few questions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I don't care if the band is playing in the squad room right outside of my office. You're not going.",
        "Matthew: Well, what if Mom says I can?",
        "Bo: She won't. Look, there are consequences to buying pot. You've got to face them.",
        "Matthew: But Dad --",
        "Bo: End of conversation, Matthew.",
        "Cole: Hey, man. I heard you got busted by your folks.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it sucks.",
        "Cole: Hey, who sold you that stuff? Asher says someone in Mr. J's homeroom is selling to freshmen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Do you have to be so tough on him?",
        "Bo: Compared to the way I wanted to be, I was adorable.",
        "Nora: Bo, I know you're angry. But, you know, this approach can backfire.",
        "Bo: We are making it very easy on him. He's not here right now. You know, we agreed to meet with the principal after hours to save him from the embarrassment.",
        "Nora: Okay, all right.",
        "Bo: Come on, Nora. Look, we're going to have to be on the same page about --",
        "Principal Dickinson: Hi, hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. I had a curriculum meeting that ran over. Uh, Commissioner, yes. Ms. Hanen.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Principal Dickinson: What can I do for you?",
        "Bo: We found this in our son's backpack. He bought it here at school.",
        "Principal Dickinson: In the school? Are you sure?",
        "Nora: Well, that's what he told us.",
        "Principal Dickinson: Did he tell you who sold him the drugs?",
        "Bo: No.",
        "Principal Dickinson: So he could be lying about where he got it.",
        "Bo: He's telling the truth. Someone is dealing drugs here at your school, and I want to know what you're going to do about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Look, you don't need to give me the third degree. My dad already covered that.",
        "Cole: I wasn't going there, but okay.",
        "Matthew: The whole \"just say no to drugs\" speech.",
        "Cole: Hey, listen, man. I'm the last guy to do that, trust me. I just don't want to see you screw up, you know?",
        "Matthew: I won't. Look, promise not to tell anyone if I tell you something? I never even tried pot, or anything else. I just bought that joint so Becca and her friends wouldn't think I was a loser.",
        "Cole: Why would they think that?",
        "Matthew: Dude, my dad is the police commissioner, and my mom's the D.A.",
        "Cole: So what? You know, some people would actually think that's cool. I'm not helping here, am I?",
        "Matthew: Nice try.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Matthew: I've got to take this. Hey, Bec.",
        "Becca: When are you getting here?",
        "Matthew: I can't, I'm grounded.",
        "Becca: Why?",
        "Matthew: My rents found the joint I had in my bag.",
        "Becca: You had pot?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, so I'm stuck here tonight.",
        "Becca: You always do what your parents tell you to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: What do you want with me?",
        "Antonio: Well, we were looking over some of Manning's phone records and we noticed that there were several phone calls between him and your mother.",
        "Schuyler: Well, that doesn't sound like a completely outrageous coincidence. She was Starr's doctor.",
        "Antonio: Well, yeah, yeah, that's true, except that Manning and his daughter were estranged. So there's really no reason for him to have any communication with her doctor.",
        "Schuyler: Well maybe, you know, maybe it was just his only way of finding out how she was.",
        "Antonio: Or maybe he was conspiring with the doctor to steal the baby.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, you know what? My mother would never do that.",
        "Antonio: Starr Manning's baby dies, and you mother commits suicide shortly after.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, because she felt guilty.",
        "Antonio: I think there's more to it than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My dad tried to steal my baby. I mean, that's a little unforgivable.",
        "Langston: And now that you've accused him of that he's all lawyered up and is saying you're a liar.",
        "Starr: I know. And I still feel real bad because I don't want him to hate me.",
        "Langston: He could just be working you, Starr.",
        "Starr: I can't do it, Langston, I can't hate him. And the worst part about all this is that I can't even talk to Cole about it.",
        "Langston: Why not? Did something happen between you two?",
        "Starr: You're not going to believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I didn't get a restraining against you to punish you, Todd, or to be mean to you. I did it because I thought it was in the best interest for our children and I still think that.",
        "Todd: Well, you seemed very happy that I didn't succeed in what I was trying to do when I jumped off that roof. And then later on you told me that if I had died, and especially in that way that it would have destroyed our kids. Isn't that why you saved me? Because you wanted me to be able to live for my kids, and how am I going to do that if I can't see them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: There you are. Hey, Starr. Drinks?",
        "Langston: Sure.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Lola: I'll help carry.",
        "Langston: I thought you and Cole were friends now.",
        "Starr: Mm -- me, too. Look, after we had the baby I thought that we could get through anything. But apparently he doesn't think so.",
        "Langston: Okay, what am I missing here?",
        "Starr: Nothing.",
        "Langston: Starr, come on.",
        "Starr: Cole was high at school today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Have you talked to your stepmom about the letter you got from your dad?",
        "Lola: How could I? I mean, my father says he's innocent and that he didn't kill my mother, and Vanessa says he did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Do you know what I'm going to do now?",
        "Vanessa: What?",
        "Cristian: I am going to take a shower.",
        "[Vanessa laughs]",
        "Vanessa: T\u00e9ase.",
        "Vanessa: \"You are my daughter and I love you, and I swear on everything that's holy I did not kill your mother. Vanessa is not who she seems. Find someone else besides your stepmother, someone you can confide in, and please, be careful. May God bless you and keep you safe.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Principal Dickinson: Believe me, Commissioner, we'll find out if someone is dealing drugs, and when we do you'll be the first to know.",
        "Nora: Well, thank you very much, Ms. Dickinson, for your time. Appreciate it.",
        "Principal Dickinson: I'm sorry this happened.",
        "Nora: [Sighing] yeah.",
        "Principal Dickinson: But I hope that Matthew has learned a few lessons from this.",
        "Bo: So do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Where are you going?",
        "Cole: To catch the Plain White T's concert.",
        "Matthew: Oh, can I hitch a ride?",
        "Cole: I thought you were grounded.",
        "Matthew: Um, my parents, they gave me a pass for the night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Are you sure Cole was high?",
        "Starr: I caught him with pills.",
        "Langston: What kind of pills?",
        "Starr: Painkillers.",
        "Langston: What did you do?",
        "Starr: I told him to get rid of them.",
        "Langston: Did he?",
        "Starr: I hope so. Cole just wasn't Cole anymore. He completely freaked out when he saw me hugging Mr. J.",
        "Langston: Hold up. You were hugging our super hot science teacher?",
        "Starr: Only because he's Dr. Joplin's son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Look, I'm not here to place blame on your mother. I love my mother also. I know what it's like to want to defend her. It's just that Manning, he has a way of persuading people to do his bidding.",
        "Schuyler: What are you saying, he bribed her?",
        "Antonio: It's a possibility.",
        "Schuyler: No. No, it's not. My mom's -- she wasn't exactly a good candidate for that kind of thing. She had too much integrity and she didn't exactly need a pay raise.",
        "Antonio: Okay, it's not money.",
        "Antonio: Could it be there was maybe something in your mother's life that Manning could hold over her?",
        "Schuyler: Because I was pretty messed up.",
        "Starr: What, like on drugs or something?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, on drugs or something.",
        "Schuyler: Are you trying to tell me that Todd Manning could have blackmailed my mother?",
        "Antonio: That's what I'm asking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Here to question Dr. Joplin's son? Don't bother. Antonio's all over it.",
        "Bo: Oh, I wouldn't expect anything less.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi, Bo.",
        "Bo: Hi. I'm going to go by your place, check on Matthew. Okay? Don't worry, I'll be good.",
        "T\u00e9a: Not here on Todd's case, huh? What, are you taking a night class, Nora?",
        "Nora: You seem a little edgy, T\u00e9a. Is that because the police got to Schuyler Joplin before you had a chance to tamper with his statement?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I don't have to resort to such tactics. You have nothing to prove these allegations against Todd. Starr's testimony alone won't cut it.",
        "Nora: No, but Janet Ketring's testimony may back her up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, good luck with that.",
        "Nora: Thank you. Thank you very much. We'll find her. And I bet she's got a whopping story to tell.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: Here you go, lee. Oh, I'm sorry. Would you prefer that I call you Janet?",
        "Janet: Renee, you're letting me stay at your guest house. You can call me whatever you want. Are you sure it's safe for me to be up here at this house?",
        "Renee: Everyone's out for the evening. You're keeping me company.",
        "Janet: But if the police find me here, or worse, if Todd finds me here --",
        "Renee: Lee, you told me that you were helping Todd take care of Marty Saybrooke. How much did you know about his plans for kidnapping his daughter's child?",
        "Todd: Now you understand? You have to be there when she has the baby, so you can deliver it right to me.",
        "Renee: I think you owe me that, Lee. What kind of role did you play in Todd's plans?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: After everything you've done to your children, I just didn't want them to live with the fact that their father committed suicide.",
        "Todd: I see. So it had nothing to do with them losing me as a father. It was just about putting the right spin on it.",
        "Blair: No, Todd. You have put them through hell. You've managed to drive a permanent wedge between you and Starr. Jack has nightmares about seeing you in jail. And I bet Sam, he probably wouldn't even recognize you. Well, Todd, here's the deal. As long as I feel that you could hurt, manipulate, or even kidnap one of your children, I'm not going to allow you to see them. I'm not going to allow you to see them.",
        "Todd: Hey, Blair, please. Please. Please. Please, they're all I have left.",
        "Blair: Todd, come on.",
        "Todd: Blair, please, you have no idea how hard it is for me to be here, or what it took. I mean, I'm violating my bail right now. Call the cops and you can have them haul me in. I just -- I need contact from people who might love me. I mean, I only have two relationships in my life that I haven't destroyed yet -- my sons. If you want me to beg you, I'll beg you. Please. Call Shaun, that's fine. Call him in and he can watch me, keep an eye on me. I just, I need to see them. I have to see them.",
        "Blair: I'll go get them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Renee, this whole thing has become such a big mess. I just don't want to get you more involved than you already are.",
        "Renee: Lee, look, whatever you did for Todd, isn't it better to go to the police? At least -- at the very least, they can protect you.",
        "Janet: They will arrest me, and then Todd will know where I am, and he will kill me.",
        "Bo: Matthew. Matthew. Hi, Renee.",
        "Renee: Hi.",
        "Bo: Is Matthew in there?",
        "Renee: Oh, I -- I thought you knew. I thought -- he said that you and Nora gave him permission.",
        "Bo: Permission for what?",
        "Renee: To go out.",
        "Bo: Oh, man. This kid is in so much trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Becca: Hey.",
        "Matthew: Hey.",
        "Becca: Did you see everyone in the parking lot? They're hanging out until the band comes on. Someone brought a couple of six-packs.",

        "Antonio: Blackmail is a breeze for Manning, okay? He has an army of P.I.s on retainer. He has the resources of his rag of a newspaper. So he can dig up dirt on even the cleanest person. So think. Think -- is there anything, anything in your mother's life that he could use against her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Think -- did Joplin ever indicate that her son knew what you were doing to his mother?",
        "Todd: No, she didn't. I told you that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Because if he has any idea that you knew he was stealing drugs from the hospital, he would figure out that you were blackmailing his mother with that information, and then we are screwed, Todd.",

        "Schuyler: Look, there is nothing -- nothing from her past that could even be used against her. And she would never compromise her work.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, Joplin was too smart for that -- a paper trail. She's not going to leave a paper trail. It would hurt her son. She was all about her kid. Oh, hey!",

        "Markko: Well, I'm not a big fan of your father's, but I'm a good listener.",
        "Lola: When I was little, he was good. He used to make up stories about a little girl named Lola. Sometimes she was an angel, and sometimes she was a brat, depending on how I behaved that day. He knew me really well.",
        "Markko: That's how Starr feels about her dad. And she's still going to testify against him.",
