        "Mitch writes Jessica a letter asking her to meet him on the docks and promising to leave Viki, Charlie and Natalie alone if she does so. Brody does not want her to do it and warns her. He then goes off to find Mitch. Meanwhile, Charlie secretly meets with Dorian and she persuades him to take a gun and kill Mitch. Viki finds him and is worried that he will drink again. He does not tell her what he is doing and asks her to stay away from him until he \"fixes\" things. Dani does an internet search on Todd Manning and finds about the rape of Marty Saybrooke and all of Todd's shady history. She leaves and goes to the docks alone. Tea and Rachel don't know where to find her or how to deal with how she's found out this information regarding Todd this way. Matthew finds her. She informs him what she has just found out, wants nothing to do with Todd and remarks that Marty's son has good reason to want to kill Todd. Right then, Matthew takes Dani to meet Starr and Cole so that she can meet Todd's daughter (her sister) and Marty's son."

        "Cole: And put some clothes on first.",
        "Starr: Stop. You are so bad. Oh, my God. Okay, this is the best birthday ever. Ready? On the count of 3. 1, 2, 3. Ha!",
        "Cole: There you go.",
        "Starr: Okay. Ah! I think we got it.",
        "Cole: Ah.",
        "Starr: Oh. Okay.",
        "Cole: Hey, so, uh, where exactly are we gonna put this?",
        "Starr: Oh, I don't know. We'll find someplace. Langston! Where are they?",
        "Cole: Oh, they're at Capricorn. We're gonna meet them there.",
        "Starr: Oh, okay. Well, let's just put this thing together so we can head over there. The clerk said it came with directions, so...",
        "Cole: It better be in English.",
        "Starr: We'll figure it out.",
        "Cole: Hey, you know your dad's not gonna like this. Now, you were supposed to buy something for yourself with that check he gave you, not Hope.",
        "Starr: But the look on Hope's face when she sees her playhouse, she's gonna freak, and he'll understand. Plus Dad's kids always come first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I'm going to watch the sunset from the terrace. It's going to be beautiful.",
        "Charlie: Un-huh.",
        "Viki: Well, you're working. I won't disturb you.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, are you okay? You've been so quiet since that run-in with Mitch.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Charlie: Oh. Sorry. Here. Just-- yeah, Charlie Banks here.",
        "Dorian: It's me--Dorian. I'm at that sleazy bar that I met you at last night. Can you join me?",
        "Charlie: Uh, I don't think that's possible.",
        "Dorian: Charlie, I need to know whether you are going to do the right thing and kill Mitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I've got to get going. Lowell's riding me, and I got to stay under the radar so I can help John keep an eye on Laurence. But I've got Jason Mosser coming by, and he's gonna keep an eye on you and Bree. He's one of the few good cops that Lowell hasn't weeded out yet.",
        "Jessica: That's sweet, but I don't need a bodyguard. I haven't seen Mitch since--",
        "Brody: A note. \"To Jessica, from your loving father.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella? Dani? Maybe she's with Rachel.",
        "[Keys jingling]",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, thank God. Rachel, where's Dani? Is she with you?",
        "Rachel: No. She's not here?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, she's gone. No note. I have no idea where she went.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: No one's gonna find us here.",
        "Dani: You sure?",
        "Matthew: I'm positive. Why don't you trash those?",
        "Dani: Because I need them.",
        "Matthew: For what?",
        "Dani: So I don't forget that my biological father's a rapist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What are you doing?",
        "Marty: Calling security.",
        "Todd: No, no. It's okay. It's about my daughter. You're the only one who can help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Thanks. How many of these have I destroyed?",
        "John: I stopped counting. You all right?",
        "Natalie: No. Do I look all right? Jared's dead. Mitch is alive. I got to do something about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Do you think it's rigged?",
        "Brody: I wouldn't put anything past Laurence. Are you sure you want to see this? Because I can read it--",
        "Jessica: As long as you're with me, I can handle anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Um, that was a client, so I've, uh, got to go, so... see you later.",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Starr's 18. If she wants to move in with--",
        "Todd: No, no. This has nothing to do with Starr. It's about my other daughter.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "Todd: I had one with T\u00e9a.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "Todd: You knew, didn't you?",
        "Marty: When did you find out?",
        "Todd: No, wait a minute. Don't pull that--",
        "Marty: I know the guy at night security very well, and he knows you even better.",
        "Todd: All right, okay, okay. Sorry. I've been under a lot of stress. I just found out about it recently, and now T\u00e9a's told her about me, and we're all supposed to meet, so I would love it if you came with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have dragged you out here. Are you okay? I mean, shouldn't you be resting or sitting down or--",
        "Matthew: I've done enough of that.",
        "Dani: I just had to get out of there before Mom came back dragging Todd and I had to be all, \"nice to meet you, daddy rapist.\" Am I wrong? He should be in jail. Just because he worked the system doesn't mean that I have to meet him, because it's not happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I'm sorry. I should have called you. There was an emergency at work.",
        "T\u00e9a: So she didn't say anything about going anywhere, right?",
        "Rachel: No. I was under the impression that she just wanted to relax, wait for you. Although...",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Rachel: She was asking a lot of questions about Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: This has nothing to do with me. She's T\u00e9a's child.",
        "Todd: You know, she doesn't know who I am. I mean, who I really am, and I think she needs to hear it from me before she hears it from someone else. What I'm asking you to do is to help me talk to her. I think it's gonna be hard enough for her to face the fact that I'm her father, let alone...",
        "Marty: So you--you would like her to meet the woman you raped?",
        "Todd: Yes. Yes, so you can tell her that you forgive me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I was doing okay. Ahem. Though I was spending most of the day fantasizing about Jared, that I could hear him talk to me, like he was still there. But at least I was sleeping at night. And now...",
        "John: What happened?",
        "Natalie: All I have is anger. I can't stop thinking about Mitch. He is the only thing I can think about. Mitch is alive, and Jared's dead. It's not fair. And all I feel is hate for Mitch. When I go to sleep at night, I want to dream about jarred, and all I have are nightmares about Mitch. I can't get away from him. I just--I feel like I'm obsessed, and I don't like the person that I'm becoming. So that's why I'm here. I, uh, I just--I thought maybe I would take Marty up on her offer and maybe get some help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I'm gonna refer you to someone else.",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. No, I don't want another shrink. I just --I need you to step up for me. Isn't that what you're all about?",
        "Marty: Ahh...",
        "Todd: Come on. I've admitted that what I did was wrong. I've tried to make it up to you. I need you to talk to my daughter and tell her that I'm not a monster. Ha! You know, it's bad enough that I shot Ross. When she finds out what I did to you...",
        "[Todd inhales sharply]",
        "Todd: Well, see, that's the beauty of her talking to you because she's gonna see this and she's gonna see that--that it's all okay, that you've gotten past it. You've moved on with your life.",
        "Marty: I can't meet your daughter.",
        "Todd: Well, why not? You see, if she doesn't realize that you've forgiven me--",
        "Marty: I haven't forgiven you. I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: \"Manning held Ms. Saybrooke down while he forced other members of his fraternity--\"",
        "Matthew: Okay. It's the worst. I don't need to hear about it.",
        "Dani: Well, that's not even the half of it. Apparently he kidnapped the same woman, Marty Saybrooke. This was years later, and she'd had some kind of brain injury and didn't know who he was. And he kept her in that house of his and didn't tell her that she had a grown son who all this time thought she was dead. Can you imagine being that boy? If I were him, I'd kill Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look, I respect that you keep trying to find the best in your dad. I do. But that's never gonna happen for me. I mean, it can't, not after what he did to my mom.",
        "Starr: Oh, no wonder. Part \"K\" is supposed to go with part \"K1.\" I'm sorry. No, look, I don't expect you to like my dad. It's just...with Hope...",
        "Cole: Look, if your dad mellows out and he's a good grandfather, that's fine. But Hope just has to know that we have her back.",
        "Starr: Who do you think you're talking to?",
        "Cole: I know. I'm just saying.",
        "Starr: You don't need that. And here is what I think. I think that my dad is damaged. There's no question about that. And yeah, he's done a million horrible things, but he can be really sweet, and I have to believe that there's that good side to him. That's why I keep forgiving him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: This poor woman, Marty Saybrooke, was totally helpless. She could hardly move. She'd lost her memory, and Todd locked her up and forced her to have sex with him.",
        "Matthew: And they charged him with rape again, and your mother defended him, and he got off.",
        "Dani: That is so twisted. There's no way I'm letting him be my father. How can I? How could anyone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You didn't tell her about the rape, did you?",
        "Rachel: No, of course not. But you know she is gonna find out.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Todd wants to tell her himself. What--what did you guys talk about?",
        "Rachel: Not much. Just that we went to college together and that he was on the football team. T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Rachel: Look.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, my God. She must have run a search on Todd. Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch's voice: Dearest daughter, please accept my apology for upsetting your family when we ran into each other. I wasn't trying to open old wounds or stir up enmity. I just wanted to see you. I knew that stalwart boyfriend of yours would be on the job and I might be able to catch you alone. I know he thinks he's protecting you, but he's so lacking in imagination and spirituality, sensitivity. He's a stolid beast of burden and totally unworthy of you. I know that in time you'll tire of his slavish devotion. I'll buy you a puppy if that's all you want. He's so boring, darling, so predictable. But you already know that, don't you? You know it won't last. You see, I know you, Jessica. I'm part of you.",
        "Jessica: He doesn't know me at all. He knows nothing about me.",
        "Brody: There's more.",
        "Mitch's voice: I must be with you. I need to forgive you for wanting to take my life, and you need to embrace me as your true father. I'll be waiting on the docks. Meet me. Alone. And I promise I will leave Natalie, your mother, and Charlie in peace forever. All my love, father.",
        "Brody: In your dreams, maniac.",
        "Jessica: No. I have to meet him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Indistinct music playing]",
        "Dorian: Oh. Thank heaven you're here. Well, I was worried you wouldn't show up. So, are you going to do it or not?",
        "Charlie: If I kill Laurence, I'll ruin what's left of my life.",
        "Dorian: You keep drinking, and it'll definitely ruin what's left of your life. Charlie... there's no other option. Do this. Do it for Viki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You're not going anywhere near Mitch Laurence.",
        "Jessica: If it means he'll leave my family alone...",
        "Brody: So now you think he keeps his promises?",
        "Jessica: No, but I--",
        "Brody: He's lying to you. He's pushing your \"I'll save everybody\" button.",
        "Jessica: But maybe that's all he wants to do is talk--",
        "Brody: Jess, he dug your husband out of the ground. He shot Jared. He murdered him. He wants you to meet him on the docks where you tried to kill him. Do you really think he just wants to have a little chat? Look at me. The only way to fight a skel like Laurence is to stay detached.",
        "Jessica: So I won't let him get to me. But I can talk to him. I have to do something, Brody. Natalie is so depressed. My mom doesn't know what to do with herself, and Charlie is going out of his mind.",
        "Brody: Look, Charlie would rather cut off his right arm than let you go talk to Laurence on your own. They all would, that I can guarantee you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: No one will ever know. The gun can't be traced. I'll lure Mitch to some sleazy place, and you...will do what has to be done.",
        "Waitress: What can I get you, handsome?",
        "Charlie: Uh--",
        "Dorian: He is fine. Thank you. Uh, but I-I'll have another, thank you very much. Ahh. Ahem. Hope you don't mind. I'm a--ha! I'm a social drinker, but...it steadies my nerves.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, for a while at least.",
        "Dorian: I, um, feel so icky. This place makes me feel like I need a bath. At home. Will you excuse me while I go freshen up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Is Marty in with a patient?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, um, I didn't have an appointment. I wasn't really sure if I was ready.",
        "John: Ready for what?",
        "Natalie: Um, to admit Jared's gone and to find a way to keep on living. Anyway, what are you doing here? I'm not--I'm not horning in on a date, am I?",
        "John: No.",
        "Natalie: Well, why are you here?",
        "John: She forgot her lunch, and I thought--",
        "Natalie: You'd come here without it? Uh, my brief stint in forensics made me very observant, John, and there's no paper bag.",
        "John: Well, maybe I'm taking her out for lunch.",
        "Natalie: You're working a case, aren't you?",
        "John: But I'm not a cop anymore.",
        "Natalie: Ha! You'll always be a cop. Might not be employed... oh. You're trying to put Mitch Laurence away, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No. You forgave me.",
        "Marty: I know.",
        "Todd: You said you forgave me.",
        "Marty: I know what I said.",
        "Todd: So what's the problem? Dani needs to know that you moved on, that I did not destroy your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella must have run a search on Todd.",
        "Rachel: I am so sorry.",
        "T\u00e9a: She knows everything. It's--everything's here. She knows--I mean, she knows it all. Oh, God. Okay, what, she must have gotten upset and gone somewhere. Where do you think she went?",
        "Rachel: I bet I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Why don't I hang on to these?",
        "Dani: I want to go home. To my real home where I was happy with my real dad.",
        "Matthew: You can't go back to Tahiti. There's nothing there for you.",
        "Dani: He promised to take me back there.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but that was before your dad--before he was killed. Besides, you've got to deal with this.",
        "Dani: What do you mean?",
        "Matthew: Like it or not, Todd Manning's your father.",
        "Dani: I don't want him.",
        "Matthew: And I don't blame you, but it's a fact, okay? And it's not gonna go away. And you have to talk to your mom.",
        "Dani: I can't.",
        "Matthew: She's not gonna force you to live with him. Worse-case scenario is she would send you back to boarding school, and I would just miss you a whole lot.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Matthew: Yeah?",
        "Rachel: Matthew, is Dani with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: You're a drunk. It's the hand God dealt you. Nothing changes that. In your shoes, I'd be so wracked with guilt I wouldn't be able to stand up straight. No, I'd be torturing myself...wondering if Jared would have been a better man if I had only stayed around.",
        "Viki: Charlie!",
        "Charlie: You followed me?",
        "Viki: Yes. I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm really sorry, but it's all I could think of to do. You know? You'd been so distracted and upset all day, and then there was that very cryptic phone call, and then I guess you lied to me about where you were going.",
        "Charlie: No, I didn't lie to you.",
        "Viki: Are you meeting a client here?",
        "Charlie: Well, so now you're checking up on my business?",
        "Viki: I love you, and I'm very worried about you.",
        "Charlie: Why don't you just call it what it is--you don't trust me.",
        "Viki: Do you blame me? I mean, last night you just disappeared. I--I understood that because Mitch Laurence was awful, he said terrible things, but you can't even look at me now.",
        "Charlie: Uh, ah...",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I know how hard this is. I've lost a child, and I know that the pain is just unbearable, and I know that the urge to--to drown that pain is overwhelming, but it doesn't help. It makes it worse.",
        "Charlie: Look, I swear to you, Viki, I haven't been drinking.",
        "Viki: Okay. Charlie, there's a drink sitting right here on the table, okay, and I saw the waitress take an empty one away. Now...if you're not drinking, then what is going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Right now stopping Laurence is probably what I think about most, yeah.",
        "Natalie: I know what you mean. Fun for Marty.",
        "John: You know, Laurence, he used a private nurse while he was recovering, and he's still using her.",
        "Natalie: So you came to the hospital to dig up dirt on some nurse, but you're not a cop, so you don't have a warrant.",
        "John: Warrants just make judges happy. You can't force someone to talk to you.",
        "Natalie: So you're planning on charming the information out of her? 'Cause you know, you could use a charming redhead's help; someone who happens to have quite a bit of time on her hands and happens to be very sneaky.",
        "John: Oh, I know she's sneaky. She is sneaky, but, um, I thought you had to see Marty?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, yeah, I was. Unless you think it's a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So we agreed to be civil for our children's sake and for our granddaughter, and I think we're doing a good job acting as if we've put all this behind us.",
        "Todd: Who's acting? I'm happy that we're past this.",
        "Marty: But we're not! I tolerate you at best. I certainly don't like you. And I'm never gonna-- never gonna trust you again. I tried that once, remember? When I had no memory, I couldn't walk, and you were all I had? Didn't turn out real well.",
        "Todd: Now, look, I know that what I did was wrong, but I was trying to--",
        "Marty: You're such--make it all better? It will never all be better. You did a terrible thing, and you don't get to make it all better because now you want to! Doesn't work that way! I won't give that to you! Is that what you want me to tell your daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Dani Rayburn's back? Since when?",
        "Rachel: She got back this morning. I got your message about coming by to see the new apartment.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but when you didn't call, I figured you were out.",
        "Rachel: So you didn't come by and run into Danielle and take her someplace?",
        "Matthew: Why would you think that?",
        "Rachel: Matthew, her mother is worried sick.",
        "Matthew: Look, tell, T\u00e9a that Dani can take care of herself, okay? I got to go.",
        "Dani: Thanks. I know it was hard for you.",
        "Matthew: I don't like to lie to my sister. Your mom's really worried.",
        "Dani: She just wants me to like Todd so we can all play house.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but I'm sure it would be a lot easier for her if you did. I also think she would hear you out.",
        "Dani: I can't talk to her. I can't talk to anybody.",
        "Matthew: Not even me?",
        "Dani: Matthew, your father is a wonderful man. You just don't know what this feels like.",
        "Matthew: You're wrong. But there is somebody who knows exactly what you're going through.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Woo-hoo! This is gonna be so great! We are gonna have tea parties and sleepovers, and it is going to be so much fun.",
        "Cole: Let's see if we can get the roof on.",
        "Starr: Okay. Oh, it's great, right?",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's pretty great.",
        "Starr: But what?",
        "Cole: Uh, just Langston and Markko don't seem to be sharing the love lately.",
        "Starr: Oh, trust me, they're sharing the love.",
        "Cole: No, no. I just think they feel a little cramped. They seem to be cranky a lot lately.",
        "Starr: That's not our fault. Markko's extremely jealous of Ford, and Langston has writer's block.",
        "Cole: Writer's block?",
        "Starr: Yeah, from that musical that she wanted to write about us, and I said no.",
        "Cole: Huh. Yeah, it is a pretty great story, though. I mean, we fell in love even though our parents hate each other. But Shakespeare already did that.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah, except for the fact that Juliet didn't get pregnant the first time she had sex with Romeo, and she also didn't think that her baby was dead for months at the time.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and then Romeo offed himself, and he didn't get addicted to drugs and drive his friend into a tree.",
        "Starr: But he also didn't have a really happy ending. Matthew's walking again, and we have our baby back.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it is a pretty good story. And Matthew is a big part of it.",
        "Starr: But there aren't going to be any parts because there isn't going to be any musical.",
        "Cole: Hey, as long as we can live happily ever after, that's all I care about.",

        "Brody: Jason's here. He's out checking the grounds. Mitch doesn't want to talk to you, Jess. He's playing with you, making you think you can get through to him and make him stop. He just wants to get you alone so he can take off with you or worse. I'm gonna take this into the station.",
        "Jessica: Lowell won't let you arrest him.",
        "Brody: Lowell's not gonna be there forever, and I need to make a case. This is evidence.",
        "Jessica: Well, it's not a crime to write a letter.",
        "Brody: It's not just a letter. He's trying to set you up.",
        "Jessica: All that stuff that he wrote about you--",
        "Brody: You think I care what a whack job thinks about me?",

        "Viki: God, I know how bleak and unfair this seems, and you have to deal with Mitch Laurence on top of everything else. No one should have to do that, but, sweetheart, we can get through this together. Please just come home with me.",
        "Charlie: It's not that I don't want you, Viki. I do, more than ever.",
        "Viki: Then come home with me.",
        "Charlie: I can't. I tried that. It didn't work. I went to meetings. I prayed. God knows I've prayed. Just let me sleep through the night. Just let me wake up one morning without remembering my son, my boy being gunned down because of me.",
        "Viki: No, Mitch Laurence gunned him down. You had nothing to do with that.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, okay, yeah, you're partly right. Laurence was the root of it, but...look, I know you don't understand, what you can't understand is that I have found what I need. I know how to get through this. I know how to fix it. And if you just can't trust me, then I want you to just protect yourself. Go on home, look after the kids, and just forget all about me.",

        "Jessica: You know that none of it's true.",
        "Brody: Hey, I don't mind being called stalwart or even predictable. Now, beast of burden, now that pisses me off.",
