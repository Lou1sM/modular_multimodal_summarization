        "[PREVIOUSLY_ON]",
        "Lindsay: He told me that you went to see Allison Perkins to ask her questions about my prison escape. Why?",
        "Troy: To shut you up.",
        "Todd: Take Blair away from here -- assuming you're willing to be responsible for her death.",
        "Sam: We're being followed.",
        "Natalie: This ends right here, right now. I'll sleep with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: There. Safe and sound.",
        "Blair: You know, Sam, what about that car that was following us?",
        "Sam: No, I shook him off a long time ago.",
        "Blair: You know -- if it turned its lights off, maybe -- maybe we just didn't see them.",
        "Sam: Remember all those twists and turns, Blair? Trust me, there's no way anybody could follow us.",
        "Blair: Well, maybe he did, though.",
        "Sam: Blair, we're safe. And if I wasn't completely sure of that, we wouldn't be here. Unless you have any doubts. I mean, I'll take you back to Todd's if you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Shawna, I don't know where you are, but maybe you're on your way. And I hope you're here soon so that we can do stuff. All right. How long will it take? Put some lipstick on a wine glass. Like five -- five minutes tops, no --",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Todd: Oh, it's about time. Come on in. Just -- come on in. It's open. Just throw your coat anywhere. Don't know what took you. You want some wine?",
        "Viki: I'd love some wine. Thank you. So, who were you expecting?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Good.",
        "Liz: Well --",
        "R.J.: Well, it's been a long day of worrying about Keri, so I'll let you get off your feet.",
        "Liz: Yeah. R.J. -- I don't want you to go. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Troy's voice: Hi, this is Dr. MacIver. I can't take your call right now, so please leave a message.",
        "Nora: Troy? Oh, boy. Okay, well, I wish I could say I was in your bed waiting for you, but I needed to get to the police station because of what happened to Carlotta, so I love you and I miss you.",
        "Troy: You got to get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hank -- any news on Carlotta?",
        "Hank: Well, she's gotten a lot better.",
        "Nora: Good.",
        "Hank: She should be fine.",
        "Nora: Good, good. Any news on you know who?",
        "Hank: No, Allison's out of here. She's up in Statesville. Nora, I don't -- I don't have enough evidence, but I just know she did this. I mean, I was right there, just a few feet away.",
        "Nora: Hank, you can't blame yourself, okay?",
        "Hank: Oh, come on.",
        "Nora: I mean, how could you have known?",
        "Hank: I should have known something was going to happen. Laurence -- he's not going to let Cristian and Natalie just get away with a free pass.",
        "Nora: I know. Those poor kids.",
        "Hank: Yeah. Well, at least Bo is back. And he's sure that Laurence is behind this and that that poison was meant for Cristian.",
        "Nora: Who else is Mitch Laurence going to hurt till he gets what he wants?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So what are you waiting for?",
        "Mitch: You really mean this.",
        "Natalie: I said yes. I'll sleep with you right here and right now.",
        "Mitch: Well, I knew you'd change your mind about making this a real marriage. Just out of curiosity, how did Cristian handle the news that his beloved was coming home to her husband?",
        "Natalie: Cristian's not going to know anything about this.",
        "Mitch: Keeping secrets already, are you?",
        "Natalie: This is a one-time deal, Mitch. Get your witness or whoever to come in and see it, and then you can get your divorce.",
        "Mitch: Is that any way to speak of our marital bond?",
        "Natalie: Okay, we have no marital bond. All you want is my money. So we do this, and you get it. We do this, it's over. Then I get to go spend the rest of my life with the man that I love.",
        "Natalie: Come on. What are you waiting for?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Mitch: Don't you want to get that, wife?",
        "Natalie: No. Like I said, what are you waiting for?",
        "Bo: Natalie? Open the door, Laurence. I know she's in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: No, I -- I don't want to go back to Todd's. I want to stay --",
        "Sam: Are you --",
        "Blair: Right here with you.",
        "Sam: You're sure?",
        "Blair: Yes. You know, I know that I'm acting kind of funny, and I know that you shook that car a long time ago. And you are so amazing, Sam.",
        "Sam: All I did was drive.",
        "Blair: No, come on. It's pitch-black out there. I mean, how did you even know where you were going?",
        "Sam: I've been up here a couple of times in the last few days.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Sam: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: It's a long drive. It took a lot of your time.",
        "Sam: Well, I had to make sure this place was safe, and it is.",
        "Blair: You thought of everything.",
        "Sam: Well, I just did what I had to do to be alone with you.",
        "Blair: Mission accomplished.",
        "Sam: Not quite. Now that we are finally alone, I'm going to hold you all night long. And as long as you feel safe, this is going to be the night we've both been waiting for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What are you doing here?",
        "Viki: I actually came by to tell you and Blair that Jessica has gone.",
        "Todd: Gone where?",
        "Viki: She left town.",
        "Todd: Well, that's -- that's it. I'm not returning any of her postcards. She doesn't say goodbye to me.",
        "Viki: If it makes you feel any better, she tried to leave town without saying goodbye to me, too.",
        "Todd: But she did say goodbye to you.",
        "Viki: Only because I got to her before she left.",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Viki: I also came by to thank you. She told me what you did. You showed up at Mitch's, and you rescued her. I guess you nearly killed him?",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, from now on, I finish what I start.",
        "Viki: Thank you so much for saving her. And can I ask you now to let it go?",
        "Todd: \"Let it go?\" You're the one who's always on me about how I need a better work ethic.",
        "Viki: He's not worth it, really. Don't waste your time worrying about him, okay?",
        "Todd: I'm not worried. I'm not worried about anything. Everything in my life is fine.",
        "Viki: Fine? Really? Then why is Blair worried about you?",
        "Todd: Blair? Well, Blair's not -- oh, yeah, Blair's worried about me. She's so worried, she took off with Sam.",
        "Viki: Didn't you tell me there was a contract on her life or something?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'm worried she might be in danger.",
        "Viki: So why would she leave town with Sam?",
        "Todd: Boinking, making whoopee -- is any of this ringing a bell?",
        "Viki: So how do you feel about that?",
        "Todd: I think Sam put Blair's life at risk so that they could do the horizontal hula.",
        "Viki: You know what? I don't really think that Sam would ever put Blair's life at risk.",
        "Todd: What would you call what he's doing?",
        "Viki: I'm not entirely sure. I have a feeling you probably haven't told me the whole story. Maybe you left a little something out?",
        "Todd: No, I didn't leave anything out.",
        "Viki: Oh. So why aren't you upset because Blair is with Sam and not you?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Todd: Ha.",
        "Shawna: Hi. So happy you invited me over.",
        "Todd: Oh, and I am so glad that you came. Come on in. Would you like a glass of wine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Why, it's the commissioner. Natalie has chosen to spend the evening with her husband. It doesn't warrant any police action.",
        "Bo: What are you doing here, Natalie?",
        "Natalie: I came to see Mitch.",
        "Bo: Why? No, go on. You can tell me. You can tell me if he's holding something over your head.",
        "Natalie: I came because of what happened to Mrs. Vega.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. That was terrible. But I don't want you to worry. All right, I called the hospital, and Carlotta's out of trouble.",
        "Mitch: The hospital? Oh. What is Cristian's poor mother doing in the hospital?",
        "Bo: That's a nice try, Laurence. I know what you did, and I know why Natalie's really here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hank: You and Troy are doing well.",
        "Nora: What? Yeah, fine.",
        "Hank: And?",
        "Nora: And?",
        "Hank: You're getting married soon.",
        "Nora: Yes, I am. A little bumpy start.",
        "Hank: Yeah, I remember that.",
        "Nora: Yeah? A little secretive, wasn't he? Well, but then I learned, you know, just give him some space. And if he's in a bad mood, it probably has more to do with work or a patient, not anything to do with me. So I leave him alone. Hmm?",
        "Hank: Now, that's a first.",
        "Nora: Oh, shut up.",
        "Hank: So, is it working?",
        "Nora: Yes, fine. It's fine.",
        "Hank: Good. Then go home.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Hank: And don't tell him that you're waiting around for the results on that cake.",
        "Nora: Okay. Something's wrong, Hank. There is something wrong, and it has a lot to do with Lindsay, I think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Troy: I'm not going to bed with you, Lindsay. Not tonight.",
        "Lindsay: Why? Because Nora called? You don't have to worry. All you were doing was shutting me up. That's what you want to do, isn't it?",
        "Troy: I'm sure I'm not the only one.",
        "Lindsay: What does that mean?",
        "Troy: It means I couldn't get R.J. to tell the authorities about your part in the prison break, so obviously you must have something on him, too.",
        "Lindsay: If I were you, I would be more concerned about what he has on you. He knows that you're having an affair with me.",
        "Troy: Why would you tell R.J. anything?",
        "Lindsay: I guess I was excited about being with you again.",
        "Troy: You were excited, Lindsay? Excited? About what? About forcing me to have sex with you?",
        "Lindsay: Excited about making love with you.",
        "Troy: But we don't make love. We have sex.",
        "Lindsay: Oh. Okay. But someday I do think that you'll change your mind about that.",
        "Troy: No, Lindsay, there isn't going to be a someday because eventually I'm going to find something out about you -- something that I can use. And then this is all going to be over.",
        "Lindsay: You don't want this to be over.",
        "Troy: Sure, I do.",
        "Lindsay: No, you don't. I know you. You want everybody to think that you're good. And you are on the outside. But underneath this mask --",
        "Troy: No, Lindsay, there is no mask here.",
        "Lindsay: Underneath this mask is a man that doesn't care about doing the right thing or saying the right thing. All that matters to you is getting what you want.",
        "Troy: That's you. That's not me.",
        "Lindsay: And the only time that you feel like yourself is when you're with me. And you like it because it feels so good to be back with me, doesn't it?",
        "Lindsay: Tell me something, Troy. Why is it that you're sleeping with me?",
        "Troy: Because I love Nora.",
        "Lindsay: Well, some people would say you have a mighty funny way of showing it.",
        "Troy: I will do whatever I have to do to keep Nora in my life.",
        "Lindsay: Even sleep with a bad girl like me.",
        "Troy: I think she's worth it.",
        "Lindsay: You think she's worth lying to?",
        "Troy: Look, Lindsay, I've done some bad things, okay? Joanna is dead because of me. Nora takes all that away.",
        "Lindsay: And you think that Nora, if she found out about Joanna, would leave you because she can't accept that.",
        "Troy: A lot of people couldn't.",
        "Lindsay: The good guys couldn't. But I got news for you -- there aren't any good guys and bad guys. The problem are people who think that there are. The biggest problem are people who think they're good, and that's the kind of person Nora is.",
        "Troy: You don't know anything about Nora.",
        "Lindsay: I know she doesn't love you. She doesn't even know you. I know you. I know you because you're exactly like me. I'll do anything to get what I want. And when I get it, I don't like to let it go. And I have you, don't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hank: You have everything now. You've got a great career, two really great children. You've got a lot of friends, and there is a man you are just crazy about who you're about to marry.",
        "Nora: Gee, when you put it that way, it does sound like I have everything.",
        "Hank: Yeah, right. And the bottom line is, there is no room for Lindsay.",
        "Nora: I know that.",
        "Hank: Not unless you give it to her.",
        "Nora: I understand that. I really do. Oh, do you want to hear the latest?",
        "Hank: What's that?",
        "Nora: Lindsay announced to me that she has a new boyfriend -- your brother R.J.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Hmm, nice.",
        "Liz: Thanks. This is the first time we've ever been in an actual bedroom together.",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Liz: Mm-hmm.",
        "R.J.: I know.",
        "Liz: I used to try and think of ways to sneak you up into my bedroom without my parents finding out.",
        "R.J.: Hmm?",
        "Liz: Wait, just skip that.",
        "R.J.: Well, I remember watching your house, waiting for you to sneak out to me.",
        "Liz: Mm-hmm. And then I'd listen for your car to pull up, and I'd race out, and I'd jump into the seat next to you.",
        "R.J.: I could barely keep my mind on driving.",
        "Liz: I wonder why.",
        "R.J.: I could hardly wait to get out of town.",
        "Liz: Seemed like it took forever. And then all of a sudden there would be our spot in that field underneath the pine trees. And then you'd spread out your blankets and you'd get out your thermos. It was like we were the only two people in the world.",
        "R.J.: Sitting next to you -- I don't know. I don't know if I ever thought I'd feel like that again. But I do.",
        "Liz: What?",
        "R.J.: That's -- that's Steven's wedding band, isn't it?",
        "Liz: Yeah. It is.",
        "R.J.: Elizabeth, are you sure you're ready for this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Can I take your coat?",
        "Shawna: Oh, thank you.",
        "Viki: Todd?",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Viki: How do you do? I'm Todd's sister. I'm Victoria Davidson.",
        "Shawna: Oh, I know who you are. Everybody does.",
        "Viki: Good. And you are?",
        "Shawna: Oh, I'm Shawna Quinlan. I'm an intern for \"The Sun.\" Actually, I thought we were going to be alone tonight so we could do some work on the paper.",
        "Todd: Oh, would you like a glass of wine?",
        "Shawna: I'd love some.",
        "Shawna: Hmm. I love good wine.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Shawna: Oh, yeah. It tastes like -- sex.",
        "Todd: Okay. You need to go now.",
        "Shawna: What?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I think it's time for you to leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Are you all right?",
        "Blair: What? I'm fine.",
        "Sam: No, you're not.",
        "Blair: Yes --",
        "Sam: Blair, Blair, I know you. Something's wrong.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Sam: Are you sure you want to be here with me?",
        "Blair: Of course I do, Sam.",
        "Sam: Blair --",
        "Blair: Look, I know that I'm -- I know that I'm acting strange, and I'm sorry.",
        "Sam: You don't have to be.",
        "Blair: Well, I am, because I know that you went to all this trouble, and -- you're right. It's just -- I'm worried. I am. I'm worried, you know, that somebody might be following us, might be watching us, and that I'm going to have to stay at my ex-husband's house, whom I hate, and that my daughter's trying to get us together constantly, and it's just -- it all just -- it makes me crazy.",
        "Sam: Blair, don't you think we've come too far to lie to each other?",
        "Blair: I'm sorry, Sam.",
        "Sam: What is it?",
        "Blair: I -- I wanted to be with you. I did. But I can't. No matter how much -- how many times I tell myself it's because of those mobsters, it's --",
        "Sam: It's not because of the mobsters. It's because of Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Tell me, Commissioner, what exactly did I do?",
        "Bo: Well, you made sure that you took advantage of the fact that I was out of town.",
        "Mitch: Well, I hate to disappoint you, but I don't keep track of your comings and goings.",
        "Bo: Well, it really doesn't matter because I sure keep track of yours. See, someway, you managed to get Allison Perkins moved to the same part of the jail that Cristian Vega was being kept in. And in someway, you got someone to bring her a toxic substance. And then she put that on a piece of cake that Carlotta Vega brought to her son.",
        "Mitch: Really? I had a deranged prisoner poison some cake? I assume you have proof of this.",
        "Bo: I've got people working on it.",
        "Mitch: Ooh, that sounds conclusive.",
        "Bo: That poison was meant for Cristian, and you did that because you're trying to get to Natalie.",
        "Mitch: Why would I have to get to Natalie? She's right here.",
        "Bo: And you're here right now because you're trying to get Laurence to back off Cristian, aren't you? Natalie, listen to me. It's over. Allison Perkins has been moved to Statesville Prison.",
        "Mitch: What?",
        "Bo: She's gone, Laurence. So he can't get to you anymore, and I'm getting you out of here right now.",
        "Natalie: It's okay, Uncle Bo.",
        "Bo: Yeah, come on, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Look, I just -- I'm going to gather some of my things. I'll meet you back at Llanfair. It's --",
        "Bo: No, I'm getting you out of here now.",
        "Mitch: I can't imagine how either of you could possibly believe that I would have anything to do with that poor, delusional woman poisoning a piece of cake. It doesn't make any sense. Now, if I wanted to harm Cristian -- which I don't -- why would I have him thrown in jail? I mean, I'm the one whose life has been threatened here.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, I know, and you're scared of him.",
        "Mitch: Natalie, much as I hate to see you go, why don't you put your uncle's mind at ease and let him escort you back to Llanfair. Otherwise, I'm afraid he may send out a posse to rescue you.",
        "Bo: Natalie, Cristian's safe. I made sure of that, okay? And now I'm going to make sure that you're safe, too. Let's go.",
        "Bo: Natalie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You were right. I can't be with you because of Todd. And I want to blame the people that are following me, but I can't -- not if I'm going to be honest.",
        "Sam: Yeah. I knew that you cared for Todd on some level --",
        "Blair: You did?",
        "Sam: Yeah. Well, he's the father of your children, and there will always be that connection. I understand that. I just didn't think that it would get in our way tonight.",
        "Blair: But it did.",
        "Sam: Tonight you seemed different.",
        "Blair: You know me, Sam, so well. Something happened.",
        "Sam: What? What happened?",
        "Blair: Todd and I kissed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: That was great, and we should do this again real soon.",
        "Shawna: You really want me to go?",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah, I do. That's what I said.",
        "Shawna: You are so weird.",
        "Todd: I know, I know. I get that all the time.",
        "Todd: Um -- I'll -- I'll see you at work tomorrow, right?",
        "Viki: You're trying to make Blair jealous?",
        "Todd: Hmm? What?",
        "Viki: Since when do you invite interns -- or anyone, for that matter -- over for drinks?",
        "Todd: Oh, I like Shawna.",
        "Viki: You don't like anyone.",
        "Todd: Well, then why would I -- why would I invite her over here?",
        "Viki: Who the hell do you think you're talking to?",
        "Todd: Is that a trick question?",
        "Viki: I don't know why you can't just admit that you want Blair back. Why can't you just admit that you love her?",
        "Todd: I do.",
        "Viki: Well, my goodness. Now, I'll bet that didn't hurt a bit, did it?",
        "Todd: It kind of did. It kind of hurt my voice a little.",
        "Viki: It's really nice. You want her back. You love her.",
        "Todd: All right, Viki, you don't got to keep saying it.",
        "Viki: Only one little problem. I don't know if you've considered this, but Blair might actually be seeing Sam because she has feelings for him.",
        "Todd: No, she doesn't.",
        "Viki: Well, she might.",
        "Todd: Then why would she kiss me?",
        "Viki: Did she?",
        "Todd: Yes, she did.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Todd: I mean, she slapped me right after, but she did kiss me.",
        "Viki: If Blair loves you, you're not going to get her back by making her jealous, playing some sort of silly game with an intern.",
        "Todd: How do you know?",
        "Viki: Because it's stupid and it's not real. I don't know why you can't just tell her that you love her or show her. I don't know. No, you can't. It's too scary.",
        "Todd: Why would that be scary?",
        "Viki: Because you might tell her and you might still not get her back.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Viki: Hang on. No, that's me. Hello. Yeah, Bo, hi. What? Is Natalie all right? Oh, my God, yeah. I'm on my way, yeah. I'm sorry. I have to go.",
        "Todd: All right, so go.",
        "Viki: You okay?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not the one with a mob hit on my head and, you know, being driven around by some horny lawyer to God knows where.",
        "Viki: I know it's really hard waiting for someone to come back.",
        "Todd: No, it's -- you know what? I should straighten up.",
        "Viki: I -- I just want you to be happy. That's all I've ever wanted for you.",
        "Todd: Really? You know what I really want is world peace. So maybe you can arrange that.",
        "Viki: I don't have a lot of my family left around me, as you might have noticed. I don't want to lose the only brother I have.",
        "Todd: Good. That's enough. I'll probably start to wrinkle.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",

        "Blair: It was just a kiss, Sam.",
        "Sam: You don't owe me an explanation.",
        "Blair: Yes. Yes, I do. I wish it could be different. You know, maybe -- maybe it could be different if we could just be together like normal people, you know, without people watching us. We have to hide out. You know, if Todd weren't around all the time --",
        "Sam: You're never going to get away from Todd.",
        "Blair: I will. I will. I mean, all of this will be over, Sam. Please. If you just -- if you would just wait --",
        "Sam: I would wait if I knew we'd end up together, Blair, but that's not going to happen.",
        "Blair: Sam, you don't know that.",
        "Sam: Yes, I do. He hurt you, Blair. He hurt you in the deepest way imaginable, and you still feel something for him.",
        "Blair: It was just a little kiss.",
        "Sam: Yeah -- it's not -- not with you and Todd. No, it could never be just a kiss. It's -- I mean, Todd is a fact of your life, like -- like your birthday -- like your birthday and like the color of your eyes. You can't change that. I know you want to and I know you want to try to love me instead of Todd.",
        "Blair: I can. I can. I can love you, Sam.",
        "Sam: No --",
        "Blair: I can.",
        "Sam: Not if you -- not if you have to try. That's not really love.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Sam: I need you to love me without really trying, the way I could love you.",
        "Blair: Oh, but I -- I don't -- I don't want it to be over.",

        "Hank: The way R.J. looks at Liz, no way he's hooking up with Lindsay.",
        "Nora: I understand that. But then why would they say they were seeing each other if they weren't?",
        "Hank: Well, Nora, maybe they're up to something. It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Nora: Well, that's true. I mean, he did want to keep it a big secret, this relationship with Lindsay, and he didn't treat her very well for someone who's seeing her.",
        "Hank: Yeah, well, who could?",
        "Nora: Lindsay has been keeping her distance from him since the escape.",
        "Hank: Mm-hmm. Well, you know, come on, R.J. was a suspect for a while.",
        "Nora: Yes, but he has Keri as an alibi and he's in the clear.",
        "Hank: Nora, I wouldn't worry about it. It's just not worth it.",

        "Troy: There's no excuse here, Lindsay. I really don't want to be with you.",
        "Lindsay: I accept you, Troy. I'll never judge you because I am exactly like you. I know you know that. I can feel it in the way that you touch me. You like being with someone that's just like you, don't you?",
        "Troy: There's nothing between us. I'm just with you so that I can shut you up, so that I can keep Nora.",
