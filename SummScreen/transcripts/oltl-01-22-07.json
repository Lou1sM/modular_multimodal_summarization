        "Spencer: Absolutely right, Blair. You are so brilliant. That is the best idea -- we keep Todd in the dark about where little Tommy is, and we keep little Tommy where he is, and everybody wins.",
        "Rex: He knows that Tommy is Todd's son. No. No way. We've been talking about T.J., right? Todd and Margaret's baby, their late baby?",
        "Spencer: Yeah --",
        "Rex: T.J.?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, yeah, T.J., T.J. -- Tommy.",
        "Rex: Who are you talking about, Spencer? Tommy who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Tommy McBain. You're a handsome fellow -- you know that? And when I get out of here, I'm going to spoil you rotten, kid.",
        "Marcie: Ok. Come on, kiddo.",
        "John: All right.",
        "Marcie: It's almost time for \"me and my mommy\" class, and we have -- you have got to give Uncle John back his scarf.",
        "John: Oh, yeah.",
        "Marcie: Yes, you do.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Oh, it's getting caught. Can you get that?",
        "Michael: I'll take that, yeah.",
        "Marcie: Oh, there you go. Oh, look at you. You're looking good.",
        "Marcie: I'll see you later.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Hey, you be good for Mommy, ok? Make her proud, little guy.",
        "Marcie: Oh, he always does. Hey, see you soon, John.",
        "John: All right, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Bye.",
        "John: Thanks for coming by.",
        "Marcie: No problem. See you later.",
        "Michael: See you, babe.",
        "Michael: Oh. This is nice.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Michael: A little color, huh?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael: Nice to see you finally dropping the Goth look. Must be Natalie's influence.",
        "John: Don't you have a \"Me and Mommy\" class to be at?",
        "Michael: Well, you'll have to deal with that someday.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Michael: Or you won't.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Michael: So? You keeping up with your PT?",
        "John: Yeah, doing everything I can to get back to work.",
        "Michael: Well, you got to stick to your timetable, ok? No cheating.",
        "John: No, or Natalie will freak out and there goes the relationship -- I know.",
        "Michael: Well, there goes your --",
        "John: Thing is, mike, I get stuck in this apartment much longer and the whole relationship is doomed anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Whoo.",
        "Natalie: Relax. I'm not going to hit you again, although you deserved it.",
        "Vincent: Hmm. No remorse, huh?",
        "Natalie: Uh, no, not after you held accusing Cristian of burning down your warehouses. I hope he sues your lawyer for slander.",
        "Vincent: Well, it's only slander if it isn't true.",
        "Talia: So, you want to tell me why you have detailed photographs and blueprints of the buildings that just burned to the ground?",
        "Cristian: I don't know what that is.",
        "Talia: Well, look again.",
        "Cristian: Those aren't mine.",
        "Talia: Well, does anyone have access to your computer?",
        "Cristian: No, because I never take my computer out of the apartment.",
        "Talia: A word of advice, Cristian -- Computer Forensics we be able to tell me exactly where those files came from. It would be a lot better coming from you.",
        "Evangeline: I wanted to be there when they searched his place.",
        "Antonio: Well, you heard Bo -- we have to stay away. Or we give credibility to Vincent's attorney's accusations. If you weren't in the middle of this and you had a client to advise, you'd probably say the same thing. I don't know why I'm worried anyway -- it's not like they're going to find anything. You know, I'm -- I'm glad my brother has you in his life.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you. You know, when I went to represent him in Statesville, I never thought I would fall in love with him.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, you know what they say -- sometimes you find love in the strangest places.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I want to know what I did to make number one on your little hit list.",
        "Jessica: You want to know why?",
        "Nash: What did I do to make you --",
        "Jessica: You want to know why?",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Well, because if I don't hate you, then --",
        "Nash: Then -- then what?",
        "Jessica: Then what I do feel could ruin everything.",
        "Nash: Well, what do you feel, Jessica?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Well, thank you, very much. Your family's very close. Am I right? Must be hard on your mother, knowing her baby might end up back at Statesville again.",
        "Antonio: You set the bar really low.",
        "Talia: What are you doing here?",
        "Antonio: Sucking blood.",
        "Aaron: I assume you uncovered evidence at the home of Cristian Vega?",
        "Talia: I don't owe you any information.",
        "Aaron: Thanks. I got what I came for.",
        "Antonio: You got nothing but assumptions.",
        "Aaron: A member of my staff saw officer Sahid and a uniformed officer enter the premises of Cristian Vega, and exit a while later with a crateful of -- something. Now, you don't look like a fan of the arts, officer. So I'm going to infer that that crate was filled with evidence. I'll let the press make what they will of it.",
        "Antonio: What have you got?",
        "Talia: More than enough for a DA to get a warrant. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to arrest your brother.",
        "Cristian: They really think I set those fires.",
        "Evangeline: How? Why?",
        "Cristian: Because I use turpentine and gloves when I work.",
        "Evangeline: Well, that's enough for reasonable doubt right there.",
        "Cristian: There's more. They found pictures in my laptop.",
        "Evangeline: Pictures of what?",
        "Cristian: Vincent's warehouses. Maps, blueprints.",
        "Evangeline: I don't understand, Cris. You took pictures?",
        "Cristian: No, I didn't take pictures. I don't know how they got on my computer. Someone else must have put them there.",
        "Evangeline: On your laptop?",
        "Cristian: What, you don't believe me?",
        "Evangeline: Of course I believe you. But I'm a lawyer, and I ask -- I ask lawyer questions.",
        "Cristian: Someone set me up. I'm being framed.",
        "Evangeline: Who would want to do that to you?",
        "Cristian: I don't know. But I'm going to find out. Because I'm not going back to prison. No way.",
        "Evangeline: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Come on, Spencer, say it. Todd's son is dead.",
        "Spencer: T.J., Todd's son, is dead and alive?",
        "Rex: No, wait -- you can't do this. You cannot destroy something I have tried so hard to protect.",
        "Spencer: Oh, Blair, thank god you're here. Would you get this kid out of here? He's making me nuts!",
        "Officer: Time to go, Balsom.",
        "Rex: Yeah -- a couple more minutes? Please?",
        "Officer: You've been in here too long. Come on, let's go.",
        "Rex: I can't let you do this, Spencer. I can't let you destroy any more lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Be honest, mike. Are you saying you're satisfied with the way Truman worked it, that he may never have to spend a day in prison?",
        "Michael: Of course I'm not satisfied, John. I wanted this guy to pay as much as you did. And as horrible as it sounds, I kind of wish the guy died on the operating table. I keep having this recurring dream, you know, where I run down and I plunge a scalpel right into his heart. Do the deed myself. There was a moment there, you know? The two of us were alone, right before Truman's surgery. I could have killed him. I probably would have gotten away with it, too.",
        "John: I should have killed him when I had the chance.",
        "Michael: Right. Your unscheduled visit to his hospital room. You could have done it. Blame the drugs or the pain. But you didn't.",
        "John: There were other factors to consider.",
        "Michael: You didn't finish it because you're not a killer, John -- even when a guy deserves to die! You're a good man. You can't get away from that.",
        "John: Tell that to the guy in the church. You remember, right? And if being good is letting scum like Truman walk around, well, then count me out, mike.",
        "Michael: It is what it is, John.",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael: Well, Truman's being shipped off to Wingdale before either one of us get another chance at him. I -- I got to get to work. I got to get the hospital. Listen, Johnny, I know that it sucks, ok, but it looks like the both of us are going to have to get used to the fact that Spencer Truman may never pay for killing dad. I'll see you, bro.",
        "John: Yeah, I'll see you. Sorry, Mike, I don't think I can do that.",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "John: Hey. Why are you limping? What happened to you?",
        "Natalie: Oh --",
        "John: Come here.",
        "Natalie: Thank you. Leave it up to me to go get a massage and wind up spraining my ankle. Ow.",
        "John: What happened? What did you do, fall?",
        "Natalie: Not a smooth move, needless to say.",
        "John: Well, anything I can do to help? You want to go see a doctor?",
        "Natalie: No, I'm ok. Vincent helped me. He wrapped it up",
        "John: How nice of him.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, he was there working out. I did use that time to give him hell about what he's doing to Cristian, but anyway -- oh, I ran into Michael. He said to ice it, keep it elevated.",
        "John: Yeah, that's -- that's good.",
        "Natalie: Michael also said that if you keep doing what you're supposed to do, that you're going to get out of here, and you're going to get your life back to normal.",
        "John: Not soon enough.",
        "Natalie: Soon enough for what?",
        "John: Not soon enough for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Blair? Oh, hey. It's you.",
        "Michael: Sorry to disappoint.",
        "Spencer: Where is Blair anyway?",
        "Michael: She's in her room.",
        "Spencer: Getting ready, right? I hope. I hope she's getting ready. She needs to be getting ready. I mean --",
        "Michael: Ready? For what?",
        "Spencer: The baby's dead, you know.",
        "Michael: The baby?",
        "Spencer: There's a death certificate to prove it.",
        "Michael: What baby?",
        "Spencer: Your baby.",
        "Michael: You really are gone.",
        "Marcie: Did you have fun, huh? Ooh. Who's this? Let's see who it is. Oh, it's Daddy. Yeah. Want to say hello?. Hey, honey.",
        "Michael: Hey, sweetie. How was Mommy class?",
        "Marcie: Oh, it was great. Tommy loved it. I think he actually started to sing.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I wouldn't doubt it.",
        "Marcie: We're exhausted.",
        "Michael: Is Tommy with you?",
        "Marcie: Of course. Where else would he be?",
        "Michael: Nowhere. Never mind. Um -- sweetie, could you do me a favor and just kiss him for me? Tell him I love him?",
        "Marcie: O-- ok.",
        "Michael: I love you, too, sweetie.",
        "Marcie: I love you, too. I'll see you at home, right?",
        "Michael: Right.",
        "Marcie: Whew. Ok.",
        "Adriana: Hey, everything ok?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I guess. I don't know -- I just got off the phone with Michael. He was acting really weird.",
        "Rex: Hey, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Hey.",
        "Rex: How's it going?",
        "Marcie: Great. Yeah. All right, I'll see you guys soon.",
        "Rex: Later.",
        "Adriana: See ya.",
        "Rex: See ya, big guy.",
        "Marcie: Come on. Let's go, Mr. McBain.",
        "Adriana: Hmm. Oh, my god. That was beyond weird.",
        "Rex: What happened?",
        "Adriana: Marcie called Tommy \"T.J.\" I swear, I nearly passed out. I got lightheaded and everything. You gave Todd the phony death certificate for his and Margaret's baby, right?",
        "Rex: Never got to Todd. And the death certificate is moot.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Spencer knows.",
        "Adriana: What?",
        "Rex: Spencer knows that Tommy is really Todd's son.",
        "Adriana: No. No, no.",
        "Rex: It -- yes.",
        "Adriana: But if he tells Todd, then Michael and Marcie --",
        "Rex: Lose their baby and I go to jail.",
        "Adriana: Do you think Spencer will tell Todd?",
        "Rex: I -- I don't know. The guy is as nutty as a fruitcake. He's hallucinating people who aren't even there, saying all sorts of nonsensical stuff.",
        "Adriana: Well, then is it possible that if he did tell Todd, he wouldn't believe him? I mean, is it possible that nobody is going to believe anything that Spencer says?",
        "Rex: It's possible, but Todd is determined to find his son. If Spencer makes sense to even one person --",
        "Adriana: No, Rex. We can't let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Hey, Jess. Oh, listen, I was just calling to let you know that they found something on Cris. And they're going to have -- you know what? I'll fill you in later. I'm -- I'm glad you got the day to yourself and that you're enjoying yourself, and I hope -- I hope you got everything you wanted.",
        "Nash: You have feelings for me, admit it.",
        "Jessica: I can't have feelings for you. I love my husband.",
        "Nash: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. But admit it -- you do. Come on, if you want to hate me for that, that's fine. If you want me to pretend to hate you, I can play that game, too. We never got to talk about it again, but admit it. You have feelings for me.",
        "Jessica: I've said all I can say.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Natalie: I want you to stay away from John.",
        "Todd: Maybe if we can find my son, we can find our way back to each other.",
        "Rex: Tommy is Truman's ace in the hole. He is not going off without playing that card.",
        "Spencer: He doesn't know who the baby's father is, but I do. My signature."
