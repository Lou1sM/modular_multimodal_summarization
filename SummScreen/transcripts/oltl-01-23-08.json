        "Clint: Come on, what's to decide? Sit down!",
        "Bo: Well, looks like my date and I will be joining my brother and Ms. Hanen.",
        "Lindsay: Ooh. Ah.",
        "Nora: Ahem.",
        "Clint: Bernard, send the waiter over because we'll need more wine at this table.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You know, that song you wrote is -- it's pretty cool. Can I see it?",
        "Sarah: Huh. I don't think so.",
        "Cristian: Why not?",
        "Sarah: Huh-huh. Um -- I just --",
        "Cristian: Are you all right?",
        "Sarah: I'm embarrassed.",
        "Cristian: Well, why would you be embarrassed?",
        "Sarah: I should not have read this to you.",
        "Cristian: Why not? It's not like that song is about me. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You know, Cristian made Sarah sound like the Martha Stewart of roomies before she moved in.",
        "Vincent: Well, maybe the man just wanted to date her, not live with her.",
        "Layla: Like us?",
        "Vincent: I don't know. Is it?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Layla: That's probably Rex and Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Hey!",
        "Layla: Hey, congratulations, you guys.",
        "Adriana: Thank you. Hey, Vincent.",
        "Rex: Hmm -- oh.",
        "Vincent: Hmm.",
        "Layla: Come on in, take your coats off. You're probably frozen. I'm so happy for you guys.",
        "Adriana: We're pretty happy ourselves.",
        "Vincent: So, when's the big day?",
        "Rex: The timing's a little tricky. Uh, it has to be before Adriana and I are booked on felony charges and after I find out what my mom's hiding.",
        "[Vincent chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I have lost control of Jessica.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, like you ever had control of her.",
        "Nash: Maybe that came out wrong. I'll try another clich\u00e9 -- she's playing with fire and she won't listen. I shouldn't be dumping this on you, should I?",
        "Roxy: If not the bartender, then who?",
        "Nash: Hmm. Had a fight -- big fight. Maybe I got through to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: What do you want, Tess? Now, what's wrong? I was just about buying that you're Tess and you're holding out on me? Come on, baby. I need a friend. Ahem.",
        "Jessica: [As Tess] That's good --",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Jessica: Because I'm feeling very friendly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I got into it with Blair about Tommy and I let it slip that Rex and I have known all along that Tommy was Todd's kid.",
        "Layla: So what do you think Blair will do?",
        "Rex: She hasn't done anything yet.",
        "Vincent: You better get a lawyer.",
        "Rex: Todd has the kid now. Maybe it'll all blow over.",
        "Vincent: You know, I could give you a few names just in case.",
        "Layla: So it's safe to say that Todd and Blair won't be on the guest list for the wedding?",
        "Adriana: Not mine, but I think my mom's going to take over and I'm sure she'll invite them.",
        "Layla: And the rest of main line Pennsylvania?",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: All her side. I have exactly three on my list -- Roxy, Nattie, and my grandma, although Roxy hasn't spoken to her since she jinxed her into losing all of her money at the tables in A.C.",
        "[Vincent chuckles]",
        "Adriana: Have you talked to your Aunt Corinne?",
        "Rex: My dad's sister, the one Roxy dumped me off with when I was a kid.",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "Adriana: Have you talked to her?",
        "Rex: I left her a message this morning, she hasn't called back.",
        "Vincent: You really got no other family?",
        "Adriana: If he does, Roxy's not talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So, you know, Jessie and I go way back. She was like my kid for what, like, about two minutes or so I thought. And even I got confused about that baby switch that Alison Perkins, that nut job, made with who?",
        "Nash: Yeah, I heard the story.",
        "Roxy: So, you know, maybe Jessica got confused. Maybe that's why Tess even exists.",
        "Nash: I don't want to talk about Tess, please.",
        "Roxy: All right -- okay, sorry.",
        "Nash: Look, I fell in love with Jessica -- Jessica is who I married. When I heard about what Tess was into -- ah.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, all that dope, man. We almost lost Jessie.",
        "Nash: Ah, thank you. I got to get home, I got to check on Bree.",
        "Roxy: Hey, man, you can't go home looking like that. You're going to scare the baby half to death. Come over here. You know, you look worse than when you lost your grapes in that poker game. Funny thing is that guy who won?",
        "Nash: Mmmm?",
        "Roxy: He became a Buchanan just like Natalie.",
        "Nash: Yeah, that's hilarious.",
        "Roxy: And funnier still, he's still doing that funny business with Natalie.",
        "Nash: Want to know what's even funnier? He's getting funny with my wife.",
        "Roxy: Right. Then you got to do that caveman thing and clabble him.",
        "Nash: You see, the thing is, it's not all him. Jessica's trying to seduce him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You had me worried there for a second, Tess.",
        "Jessica: [As Tess] Did you think I was going to back out?",
        "Jared: I was just looking forward to seeing you after the day I've had.",
        "Jessica: Oh, honey. I'm so sorry those butthead Bukes turned down your little vineyard idea.",
        "Jared: And it was a good one and they all knew it.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jared: They just closed ranks.",
        "Jessica: And they're stupid. I happen to know for a fact that jug wine sells very, very well with the frat boys.",
        "Jared: Well, try telling your family that.",
        "Jessica: Well, I did. You heard me. You were there.",
        "Jared: A lot of good it did me.",
        "Jessica: Again, I'm sorry.",
        "Jared: Well, at least you came through, though.",
        "Jessica: So you're not mad at me?",
        "Jared: Since when does Tess care if anyone's mad at her or not?",
        "Jessica: Well, you know, you're the only one that knows that I am Tess. You're the only one I can be myself around and not pretend to be Jessica -- God. I hate her.",
        "Jared: You hate Nash, too?",
        "Jessica: No, I just can't believe that he bought that whole integration thing and then he fell in love with Jessica when he promised me that he wouldn't. I mean, he gave me his word.",
        "Jared: So he has no idea?",
        "Jessica: No, Jared. Nobody has any idea, because if anybody finds out -- poof, I'm toast, I'm gone. You are the only one that knows -- just you -- so, it gets a little lonely. You know what I mean?",
        "Jared: I do, because I'm lonely, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Didn't that beat all at the board meeting, Pamela Stuart claiming to be Jared's mother?",
        "Bo: I know it, yeah. She told me one story on the phone and then she tells me something totally different in front of him.",
        "Nora: I guess we have to be careful who we choose to trust.",
        "Bo: And what does that mean?",
        "Nora: Nothing, I was just commenting.",
        "Waiter: May I take your order now?",
        "Lindsay: No.",
        "Nora: Yes.",
        "Clint: Why don't you give us a minute, huh?",
        "Waiter: Sure, take five.",
        "Clint: All right. How about a toast?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Um -- to Lindsay, whose recovery was nothing short of a miracle.",
        "Nora: If you believe in those.",
        "Bo: Oh, come on, Nora.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, you know what? It -- it wasn't a miracle. It was you. You brought me back. To Bo. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: You're awfully quiet.",
        "Cristian: So are you.",
        "Sarah: Yeah. Could be worse. We could be talking about food and weather -- that's not a good sign.",
        "Cristian: Let me ask you a question. You obviously wrote that song with some guy in mind. Was that guy me?",
        "Sarah: No. Okay. I wrote the song for you.",
        "Cristian: So that part in the so when you're walking through the crowd and you know where your heart is -- it's me?",
        "Sarah: I never thought I'd write again, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: I felt that way about painting -- more than once. Sometimes all you need is a little inspiration.",
        "Sarah: Must've been that look in your eyes when I'd drop a glass at Capricorn or mess up an order. Or when I booked Timbaland.",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on, you got to admit -- that's a stretch for anybody.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, especially for me, huh?",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Sarah: Because I'm a little cocky.",
        "Cristian: \"A little\"? Uh --",
        "Sarah: What? Are you saying I'm full of myself?",
        "Cristian: Well --",
        "Sarah: Like you're not?",
        "Cristian: Me, cocky?",
        "Sarah: Ha -- you want me to make a list?",
        "Cristian: Go for it, right now. Bring out that little paper of yours -- start. What?",
        "Sarah: See how easy it is for me to get to you? I think I feel a song coming on.",
        "Cristian: So you're telling me that's what inspired you?",
        "Sarah: Actually, it was the shirt -- my shirt, the one I left at your place when I moved in with Layla? You washed it for me? That was it, Cristian. That's when you had me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Don't make too much out of this, Lindsay. I mean, I -- yeah, I stopped by a few times, but at first I don't even think that you knew that I was there.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I must've heard you in there somewhere.",
        "Bo: Yeah. You just can't give me too much credit -- that's all.",
        "Nora: Well, Bo, that's interesting. If -- who is responsible for this miraculous recovery, then?",
        "Clint: St. Ann's -- they have a very good reputation.",
        "Nora: Well, they keep making recoveries like this, those shrinks will have to be canonized.",
        "Clint: Who's ready to order?",
        "Nora: Bo, you should have the angel hair pasta.",
        "Bo: Is that right?",
        "Nora: Yeah. Well, Lindsay's called you her angel, you brought her back. And then, my goodness, even the timing was heavenly -- you brought her back just in time to walk from a murder charge.",
        "Bo: She didn't know if she would ever walk.",
        "Nora: Well, why not? She's done it before.",
        "Bo: Did you invite us to join you just so you could work Lindsay over the coals? I mean, is -- is that what this is really all about?",
        "Lindsay: You know, Bo, it's okay. I think I do know what it's about. You don't believe that I had a psychotic break when I murdered Spencer Truman. You wanted to convict me and you didn't get to. You didn't think I had enough punishment, but I'm the one that has to live with the fact that I killed a man for the rest of my life and that's worse than any prison you could put me in.",
        "Nora: Whatever.",
        "Lindsay: You know what? Let's just put it on the table, shall we? You are so jealous that I'm living with Bo that you can't see straight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So, what are you saying -- Jessie's trying to get into Jared's shorts?",
        "Nash: Uh -- that's what she wants him to think she wants so that he'll admit that he's not really Asa's son. It's all gone too far.",
        "Roxy: Stinkin' piece of garbage!",
        "Nash: That is exactly what I think!",
        "Roxy: You know, this plumbing is on the fritz again. You know anything about pipes?",
        "Nash: No. I know about irrigation.",
        "Roxy: Well, if this were a farm, we'd be in business.",
        "Nash: Ah.",
        "Roxy: Man, come on!",
        "Nash: Hey, you're going to hurt yourself if you keep that up.",
        "Roxy: Oh, no, it feels good. I'm pretending it's Miles.",
        "Nash: Laurence -- what do you got against him now?",
        "Roxy: He dumped me.",
        "Nash: Didn't know you two were together.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, he didn't know it, either. Unfortunately, and it ended before it began. So, I'm sure that's what you want Jessie to do with this Jared guy.",
        "Nash: Yeah. I know she's not into him, I -- I know that. She's just trying to figure out if he's trying to fleece her family.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, I'm sure you don't want her to keep stringing him along.",
        "Nash: I don't want him to try something on her. Tried to put my foot down but she doesn't seem to take well to orders.",
        "Roxy: Well, unfortunately, that's probably my affluence on her.",
        "Nash: Your influence -- yeah, yeah, probably. She said that she just wants one more try to get him to slip up. I couldn't talk her out of it.",
        "Roxy: So you're saying that she's going to see this hunk? You better do something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: [As Tess] Why are you lonely, Jared?",
        "Jared: Oh, you have to ask?",
        "Jessica: Oh, I know. They treated me the same way -- like toxic waste. Sucks, doesn't it?",
        "Jared: What's with all the pillow talk, Tess? You were never into that before. Well, at least until after.",
        "Jessica: How many people live in this mausoleum?",
        "Jared: Ah -- too many.",
        "Jessica: Well, I don't really perform well in front of an audience. So if you want to have me, it's going to have to be in a hotel.",
        "Jared: So you came here to talk?",
        "Jessica: No, I came here to get away from Nash. I'm not kidding.",
        "Jared: This is your way of getting back at him?",
        "Jessica: No. This is my way of being with someone who knows where I'm coming from. You feel the same way, Jared, I know you do. You could hardly wait for me to come over here. I could hear it in your voice when I called you. And do you want to know why?",
        "Jared: Because you're as hot as you think you are?",
        "Jessica: Well, that, too.",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jessica: But, really, I am the only one who doesn't give a crap whether or not you're a Buchanan. I mean, Asa's second wife comes in and she says that you are really her and his son, and they still don't believe you. Ha! But it really, it was -- it was touching, honestly, the whole mother and son reunion -- oh.",
        "Jared: And what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Jessica: Well, you certainly don't think I bought it? I mean, Pamela's no more your mother than I am.",
        "Jared: Is that what you think?",
        "Jessica: I get you, Jared. You can't be yourself, either. I don't give a damn whether or not you're a Buchanan! I just want to party with somebody who knows who I am.",
        "Jared: Hmm. You want to party, let's party. What's the matter? I mean, I know Jessica can't drink, but what's Tess care about her liver? You match me shot for shot, I'll tell you anything you want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: Bon appetit.",
        "Bo: Thank you.",
        "Clint: So, why don't we all take a deep breath and enjoy the meal?",
        "Bo: Okay, but you just give me one minute here, okay, because I want you to understand that Lindsay and I are not, as you say, \"living together.\" It's a court-appointed guardianship until Lindsay's back on her feet.",
        "Nora: Well, it wasn't as we say. Lindsay is the one that said you were living together.",
        "Lindsay: What's your point?",
        "Nora: Well, if you're not living together, how can I be jealous?",
        "Lindsay: Because you are.",
        "Nora: Or maybe you just want me to be because that would make it all the more fun for you. I'm with Clint. And maybe it just bothers you because it bothers Bo.",
        "Bo: What -- wait a minute, wait a minute. I am not bothered, Nora. I mean, we're ancient history.",
        "Clint: Well, if that's true, why do you have your back up all of a sudden?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So all I had to do was wash a shirt for you?",
        "Sarah: You didn't ruin it.",
        "Cristian: Well, then why did you treat me so bad when I had you with the shirt?",
        "Sarah: I don't know. There's just something about you that makes me love driving you crazy, and that's not going to change, by the way.",
        "Cristian: Let me let you in on a little secret -- I get it.",
        "[Cristian chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Hey, serious business. If you want my lawyer's name, the man is good.",
        "Rex: I'll let you know.",
        "Adriana: Excuse me. Aren't we supposed to be talking about something else -- flowers, my wedding dress? We are not going to talk about getting arrested tonight.",
        "Layla: Oh, my God, I saw this great dress in the magazine that would look awesome on you. Come on.",
        "Adriana: Let me see it.",
        "Layla: Yes.",
        "Vincent: You want to trade that in for a beer?",
        "Rex: Could we just trade that stinky cheese for some bar nuts, too?",
        "Vincent: I'll see what I can do.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Rex: Aunt Corinne.",
        "Corinne: Oh, hi, sweetheart. I just got in and saw your message.",
        "Rex: Uh, it's cool. I have news.",
        "Corinne: Good news?",
        "Rex: I'm getting married.",
        "Corinne: Rex, that's wonderful! Is it that girl you were telling me about?",
        "Rex: Adriana, yeah.",
        "Corinne: My little Rex, a married man.",
        "Rex: She's the most amazing woman I've ever known -- besides you, of course.",
        "Corinne: Always the sweet talker.",
        "Rex: I cannot wait for you to meet her. Can you come to Llanview?",
        "Corinne: I'd love to. Let me see what I can book and I'll get back to you.",
        "Rex: Uh -- I wanted to ask you about someone else. Did you and dad have any other relatives? Because there's some guy in town who says his name is Charlie Balsom.",
        "Corinne: Never heard of him.",
        "Rex: Okay. What about any other long-lost relatives? My guest list is a little short.",
        "Corinne: Why don't you ask your mother?",
        "Rex: I did, but Roxy had a really strange reaction.",
        "Corinne: Roxanne, strange -- that's something new and different?",
        "Rex: Strange even for Roxy. You have any idea what that's about?",
        "Corinne: No.",
        "Rex: Okay.",
        "Corinne: I- I've got to go. Um -- congratulations, really, to you and Adriana. After everything you've been through, you really deserve something good in your life. Bye, now. I love you.",
        "Rex: You, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Oh, it's just cold as hell out there.",
        "Nash: Get it fixed?",
        "Roxy: Turn it on.",
        "Nash: Whoo-whoo! Wow, what'd you do?",
        "Roxy: What you got to do with Jessica -- if things get tough, you got to get tough back.",
        "Nash: Jessica and I don't really operate that way. The whole tough-love thing -- it's a little retro, you know what I mean?",
        "Roxy: You know, it kind of reminds me of that song \"Cruel to be Kind\"? See, the cruel part of it was that it killed me to have to give Nattie back to the Buchanans and the family, and the kind part of it was, is that she was better off being with them than she ever would've been with me.",
        "Nash: That's very altruistic of you.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, baby. You don't know me very well, but I always tell the truth.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- no, I -- I'm saying that -- that you put Natalie ahead of your own wants and needs -- \"altruistic.\"",
        "Roxy: Well, you know, sometimes there's nothing that you won't do for your family, and Jessie's like that.",
        "Nash: I'm worried about what she is doing to her family -- to her, to Bree, and to me.",
        "Roxy: Well, then you better teach her a lesson -- make her stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: To the truth -- about me. Ah. Or maybe about you, Jessica. Huh.",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jessica: [As Tess] Well, it's my liver, too, jackass! And I'm not going to die just to prove a point to you, okay? I put myself on the line for you today, Jared. I voted with you. I risked Nash and my entire family finding out who I really am and you still don't trust me.",
        "Jared: Well, what do you expect?",
        "Jessica: I expect a little gratitude here, okay?",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jessica: God. Do you know that Nash was all over me after that meeting? He kept on saying over and over and over again that only Tess would do this, and do you have any idea what would happen to me if Nash -- or anyone else, for that matter -- found out that I was still around?",
        "Jared: Actually, I do.",
        "Jessica: Who the hell are you?",
        "Woman: You're coming with us.",
        "Jessica: What? Is this some kind of joke? You set me up.",
        "Jared: I called St. Ann's after the board meeting, for your own good.",
        "Woman: There's your signature.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Woman: See, right there?",

        "Woman: Look, I was right here waiting to talk to Mr. Buchanan and I heard you. I heard you say that you were no longer integrated, that you are Tess now and just pretending to be Jessica.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, you got it wrong -- I -- I -- I am pretending to be Tess, okay?",
        "Woman: Look, in this document, Jessica Buchanan warns that Tess will try and trick everyone into believing she's Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Listen I wrote that to try to protect my daughter, okay, and you used it against me.",
        "Jared: I was very concerned about you, Tess. You're a dangerous woman. I mean, you put me in prison for two years for something I didn't do. And you almost killed Jessica when you shot up, so I don't blame Jessica for wanting to protect her child from you.",
        "Jessica: But I'm not Tess. I'm -- I'm not Tess! I'm not --",
        "Jared: But that's what you said a few minutes ago.",

        "Jared: I can't do that, I can't do that, not when I think about Bree, that sweet little girl, and what you might do to her if you're on the loose.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no. No, please. Can't you see what he's doing? Okay, he's just trying to get me back, so don't -- don't let him use you guys, okay, for his revenge fantasy against me.",
        "Woman: I'm sorry, but I have to go by these orders.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God!",
        "Woman: Jessica was very clear about keeping her husband, her family, and especially her child safe from Tess. I'm afraid we have no other choice but to follow her orders.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Let -- let -listen. Let me just call my husband. My husband will clear this whole thing up.",
        "Jared: Her husband was in love with Tess and never wanted her to get integrated in the first place.",
        "Jessica: No, no! My husband was -- he fell in love with me, Jessica, okay? He doesn't want Tess to come back at all. He doesn't even want me to do this! He knows that I'm pretending to be Tess right now, okay, so I know if you just let me call him right now, he will clear this entire thing up.",

        "Layla: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.",
        "Vincent: No, I mean it.",
        "Adriana: It's okay. Rex explained and I understand. We were up all night last night watching Marcie give up Tommy to Todd. We're lucky to have each other. A ring doesn't matter.",

        "Clint: Okay, yeah, yeah. Let's hear it.",
        "Bo: All right. You know that Nora cheated on me, so I'm wondering to myself, \"Why the heck would you set yourself up for the same thing?\"",

        "Clint: Between two grown men?",
        "Nora: Oh. I'm -- I'm the one that fired the first round and I'm so sorry about that, I really am. It's just knowing Lindsay's getting away with murder again just drives me nuts.",

        "Nora: Well, you're not Viki, you're certainly not Dorian. What happened between you and Bo was a mistake, but we're all guilty of making those. We'll probably make even more.",
        "Nora: Are you sure?",
        "Clint: At least they'll be our mistakes.",

        "Bo: I know you have, you know? But she is so stubborn that when she thinks she's right, she just won't give an inch.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I can't blame her for thinking that I faked the breakdown.",
        "Bo: Even though she read every doctor's report that said it was real? That's her problem. That's not ours.",
        "Lindsay: Do you mean that? I hope you do because you know what -- I meant what I said at dinner. If you hadn't kept coming to see me, I wouldn't be here, Bo. I'm only here because of you.",

        "Cristian: You ever skate?",

        "Sarah: I'd show you if I wasn't wearing heels.",
        "Cristian: That's too bad.",

        "Jessica: Well, Jared set me up.",
        "Jared: Because she's Tess -- she's been telling me that for a while now. I was just trying to protect you and your kid.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I do hate Lindsay living with Bo, but it has nothing to do with jealousy. Lindsay murders two people, and both times she got off because she copped an insanity plea. I just worry that Bo is -- I worry about him bringing her into his life.",
        "Clint: It's Bo's mistake to make.",

        "Nora: Bo's mistakes have fallout on Matthew. But you're right -- if Bo wants to step in it with Lindsay, he will.",
        "Clint: Hmm. You taste like a fine merlot -- and I smell like French dressing -- I'll go get the car.",
        "Nora: Oh, Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay. If I didn't know you were faking it before, I sure do now. And I am going to out you -- if it's the last thing I do.",

        "Sarah: These are -- how good of a skater are you?",
        "Cristian: Just a little ice hockey, no big deal. Come on. Careful.",

        "Sarah: I'm out of practice -- these are not exactly skates!",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know. Moon was in your eyes and all that -- we should've brought out the sunglasses.",
