        "Guard: Rise and shine! You've got visitors.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Michael: Hi.",
        "John: We've got good news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hey, no, do it again. Throw it to me -- right through here, right here. Three points wins the game -- no! He's missed it! They lose! You know what, though? You got a lot of potential. Now, you don't have to play football, but I can tell you have a lot of potential. You'll go very far in the game. You know you're named after the only man who ever took a liking to me? You're going to have it a lot better than I ever did. And I'm sorry we weren't there for you in the beginning. But we're here now, you know? And we love you. And pretty soon, you're going to love us. Let's try it again -- right through there, buddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Viki coughs]",
        "Nora: I just really only want some coffee for now -- more coffee, with some cream, please.",
        "Viki: Actually, my shift doesn't start for another couple of hours. Sorry.",
        "Nora: Well, you \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Did you reach Jared?",
        "Charlie: Well, no. He's still not taking my calls.",
        "Dorian: Oh, Charlie, I'm so sorry.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, it's pretty sad when a dead stranger is a better father figure to my own son than I am.",
        "Dorian: But you're not giving up.",
        "Charlie: No, no. As I said to Viki, I --",
        "Dorian: You told Viki?",
        "Charlie: No, no, just that I'm going to be a father to my son if it's the last thing I do.",
        "Dorian: Even if it means losing Viki?",
        "Charlie: Look, Dorian, I have disappointed that boy so many times and I don't approve of what Jared is doing, but I'm not going to be the one to send him to prison. I've got to keep his secret and I appreciate the fact that you're keeping it, too.",
        "Dorian: Oh -- well, of course. And I understand completely -- I would do absolutely anything to protect my children.",
        "Adriana: Good morning.",
        "Rex: Hey!",
        "Dorian: Good morning.",
        "Adriana: Uh -- bad time?",
        "Dorian: Not at all! Hey, we've got a wedding to plan!",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: I got ahold of every single bridal magazine published in the last year. We're going to have so much fun -- your hands are cold. Oh, dear -- maybe I shouldn't plan too elaborate a reception since your fianc\u00e9 can't afford to get you a real engagement ring. Hmm. Ah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Shane! A good day starts with a good breakfast! This is going to be a great day -- I can tell already. You almost left your homework, and you're going to miss your bus if you don't hurry! Oh. Shane Morasco, you get your little butt out here right now or I'm going to --",
        "Ramsey: You're going to what? I hope you weren't just threatening your son, Ms. Morasco, because isn't that our job?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Viki, oh, my God -- welcome home! Oh!",
        "Viki: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Nora: How are you?",
        "Viki: Oh, my God, Nora, I'm -- I'm wonderful.",
        "Nora: Well, you look wonderful.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Nora: What is it, what is it? Is it the waitressing or is it the hostage situation?",
        "Viki: Yeah. You know what? I just loved living a much simpler life.",
        "Nora: Really?",
        "Viki: Yeah, really. And I guess I let everybody think that I was in France because I didn't think they'd understand.",
        "Nora: You know what? I think we could all use a break from our life from time to time, Viki.",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. I'll tell you all about it some time over dinner, okay?",
        "Nora: Perfect and I'll wait on you, then.",
        "Viki: Excellent.",
        "Nora: I won't cook, though. Sit down, join me, will you?",
        "Viki: Are you sure?",
        "Nora: Yes!",
        "Viki: Okay, thank you, thank you. Hey, what have you been up to?",
        "Nora: Oh, what have I been up to? Uh -- work, and Matthew, and work and Cole.",
        "Viki: And work. Work.",
        "Nora: Pretty much.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Pretty much.",
        "Viki: You seem very preoccupied with something.",
        "Nora: Hmm?",
        "Viki: Um -- are you still working on putting Lindsay away?",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Uh-huh. The thing is I thought the charges against her were dropped by reason of insanity.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I know, but, see, if I can prove that Lindsay was faking it --",
        "Viki: But now that she's been declared competent, how do you do that?",
        "Nora: I don't know, but I'm going to figure it out. Viki, she's gotten away with murder twice and now Bo has been declared her legal custodian, which means she's living in his house, which is where my son goes to see his father.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, I get that, yeah.",
        "Nora: Yeah, yeah. Well, hey, look who's here.",
        "Viki: Oh, hi. Clint, hi.",
        "Clint: Hi. It's so good to see you.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Clint: You look terrific.",
        "Viki: Yeah, thank you, thank you.",
        "Nora: I said \"wonderful.\"",
        "Viki: Thank you very much.",
        "Clint: We were so worried about you.",
        "Viki: Yeah, it was a sad, awful situation, but, I mean, I'm fine, you know.",
        "Clint: Well, you look -- you look it.",
        "Viki: Thank you. How are you?",
        "Clint: I'm great.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Clint: Yeah. Why shouldn't I be?",
        "Viki: Well, I mean, I heard about, you know, you and Dorian and, um -- I guess I'm sorry that it ended that way, you know, for you.",
        "Clint: No, you're not.",
        "Viki: Well --",
        "Clint: No, you're not! And honestly, neither am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I don't care about a real diamond ring.",
        "Rex: But I'm getting her one.",
        "Charlie: Ooh.",
        "Adriana: And I don't care if we elope, which we'll do if you don't stop lobbing cheap shots at Rex.",
        "Charlie: Well, if you'll excuse me --",
        "Rex: Oh, before you go --",
        "Charlie: Hmm?",
        "Rex: I asked my mom if -- if you might be related to us.",
        "Charlie: And let me guess -- I'm not?",
        "Rex: Who knows? But my half of the guest list is looking kind of sparse, so if you want to come beef up the Balsom side --",
        "Charlie: Well, unless, of course, you elope --",
        "Dorian: No, they are not going to -- ha-ha-ha -- elope!",
        "Charlie: I wish you both a lot of luck.",
        "Dorian: My, my, my. The wedding could get to be expensive if you go around inviting random strangers off the street.",
        "Adriana: Wasn't Charlie a random stranger off the street when you invited him to be your roomie?",
        "Dorian: You know, they do not let you pick your own roomie in prison, darling, and that could be where you end up -- yeah -- if your fianc\u00e9 gives you yet another stolen ring.",
        "Adriana: The ring Rex gave me was not stolen.",
        "Rex: Ladies --",
        "Dorian: And none of this would've happened if he had gone to a reputable jeweler as I suggested.",
        "Adriana: He bought it from a friend, okay?",
        "Dorian: I see. He bought you a secondhand ring which turned out to be hot. I mean, does not any of this bother you?",
        "Adriana: It wasn't hot. It belonged to Marcie McBain.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Adriana: Rex bought it from Marcie's friend in Texas.",
        "Dorian: I thought it was Rex's friend.",
        "Rex: She happened to go to high school with me.",
        "Dorian: Honey, are you believing any of this?",
        "Adriana: Yes, because it's the truth.",
        "Dorian: I see. And it doesn't bother you in the least that Rex bought Marcie's engagement ring down in Texas where he went trying to find Marcie and Tommy for Michael McBain?",
        "Adriana: Will you keep your voice down so Todd and Blair don't hear you?",
        "Dorian: You know, you could end up being thrown in jail for grand theft -- yes, that is if Todd doesn't murder you first, Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hey, guys.",
        "Todd: Hey! We're -- we're playing football. He's got a hell of an arm.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Todd: Let's show her -- uh, hold your arms up like a field goal.",
        "Blair: Oh, wait, wait. Don't -- don't hit me with that.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no, no. It's just a little spongy football. Go ahead, show her. No, he's -- he's pooped.",
        "Blair: Oh. Well, did you guys sleep all right? Did you sleep in here?",
        "Todd: No, he was crying. I had to get him out of his crib.",
        "Blair: Well, why didn't you wake me, Todd?",
        "Todd: I tried.",
        "Blair: You tried to wake me?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I knocked on your door. You must've been really out.",
        "Blair: I must have been.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I've been looking forward to this for so long -- his first night with his family, with us. Now, what's wrong, Blair?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Mike, you have good news? Is -- is it about Tommy?",
        "Michael: Look, Tommy's fine. We got you a great lawyer.",
        "John: And the district attorney's agreed to meet with you this morning.",
        "Marcie: That's the good news?",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "John: Since Mrs. Davidson has agreed not to testify against you, the D.A.'s considering dropping all the charges.",
        "Marcie: Mike, have you seen Tommy? Have you seen him since they took him away?",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Marcie: Did they take him back to Llanview?",
        "Michael: Marcie, listen to me. We think we might be able to take you back home, too.",
        "Marcie: That's good. So then I -- I can see Tommy, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: How did you get in here?",
        "Ramsey: Oh, you think a little door lock's going to stand in the way of the F.B.I.?",
        "Gigi: You're not even in the F.B.I. anymore.",
        "Ramsey: Ah, I'll be back in soon. But if you try to stand in my way, you'll end up on my list.",
        "Gigi: What list? Are you Santa now?",
        "Ramsey: Hmm -- maybe. Now, you already have a record -- do you want me to call Social Services in? Your son doesn't even answer when you threaten him. Do you know where he is, by the way?",
        "Gigi: Shane? Shane, you answer me right now! I swear to God, if you did something to him --",
        "Shane: Sorry -- I had my headphones on. What are you doing here?",
        "Gigi: Get out of here, Shane. Run away.",
        "Shane: I'm not leaving you alone with him. What do you want?",
        "Ramsey: I want to make sure your mama keeps you safe and sound.",
        "Shane: If I'm not safe, it's because you're here.",
        "Gigi: Shane, shh.",
        "Ramsey: No, don't shush him when he's right, and he's right -- I'm here because you've got a real problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: Look, I know, Mike. I know that I can't see him -- of course I can't -- but you could. Mikey, if you wanted to, you could see him.",
        "Michael: I wish I could. Todd is not going to let me anywhere near him.",
        "John: Look, I know you got Tommy on your mind. We all do. But right now, we got to focus on getting you out of here.",
        "Marcie: I don't care about that. I don't! I just need to know that Tommy's okay, Mike.",
        "Michael: Blair and Todd are going to take great care of Tommy --",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Michael: You know that!",
        "Marcie: He doesn't know them, Michael. And they don't know anything about him. They don't know that when he says \"map, map,\" he needs a nap. They don't know that for him to go to sleep, we have to sing to him.",
        "Michael: Look, Blair's a singer. She's raised two kids. Maybe she will figure it out.",
        "Marcie: So, what, are you -- you're just -- you're saying that he's going to be okay? He's going to be okay without us?",
        "Michael: That's what you want for him someday, isn't it?",
        "Marcie: No, I just -- Mike, I just didn't want to break his heart. And that's exactly what I've done. Michael, I broke his heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd, there's nothing wrong here. It's just you know what I think? Well, I wanted to give you and your son some time to get to know each other -- some alone time.",
        "Todd: If somebody had told me that I'd rather be up playing peek-a-boo than anything else -- just hated hearing him crying.",
        "Blair: Well, babies cry.",
        "Todd: But he seems so miserable. God, it just -- it didn't have to be this way. If Marcie and Michael, Rex --",
        "Blair: And Adriana.",
        "Todd: And Adriana hadn't lied to us for so long, it could've made things much easier for everyone involved, especially Sam.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I know.",
        "Todd: It would've been so much -- God, so much simpler. I mean, we -- we would've gotten to know him sooner, he wouldn't have had a chance to get so attached to Marcie. And she certainly wouldn't have had a chance to take him on the run the way she did. We could've -- we could've met him and gotten to know him before he moved in here and -- and it would've shown the McBains that we're good parents.",
        "Blair: Todd --",
        "Todd: I would've given them visitation rights.",
        "Blair: I know.",
        "Todd: I guess I just wanted him too much. But I didn't know what was missing in my life till he got here. I didn't know that I'd love him so much. He's -- he is great, isn't he?",
        "Blair: Yeah. He's -- he's great. I -- I can't wait to, you know, get to know him better.",
        "Todd: Do you think he's teething or something? Maybe that's why he's so --",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? He's your son. Maybe he's hungry, Todd -- always makes you fussy.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Todd: well, that's a thought -- a good day starts with a good breakfast. And today is going to be a good day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Are you saying Blair may have told Todd that we knew about Tommy? Oh -- so much for family loyalty.",
        "Dorian: Todd is her husband.",
        "Adriana: On paper only, supposedly. I'm her flesh and blood.",
        "Dorian: Exactly, so when Blair and Todd are settled in with Tommy or Sammy or whatever they're calling him, I will call a Cramer women conference -- yes, and we'll all talk about this in a nice, civilized manner.",
        "Adriana: The last time you called a Cramer conference, Blair called a cat fight and I really don't want to be the bride with the bald spot.",
        "Rex: You won't have a bald spot. I'm the one who's going to take all the heat for this.",
        "Dorian: That's very chivalrous of you considering you got her into all of this.",
        "Adriana: We are in this together.",
        "Dorian: Oh, for goodness sakes. Todd's got his son back -- why should he care about anything else?",
        "Adriana: Oh, you know Todd -- no grudge is too small for him to hold on to.",
        "Rex: Okay, well, what do you say we hit the highlights of the wedding plan and am-scray? Don't want to be late to meet Aunt Corrine.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Oh, is she in town?",
        "Adriana: To meet me.",
        "Dorian: Well, how lovely. Okay, um, uh -- show me the guest list.",
        "Adriana: Right here -- here.",
        "Dorian: Ah. Marvelous. Oh, Rex -- well, I can see you weren't kidding when you said you had a very small family.",
        "Adriana: Mom.",
        "Rex: Quality over quantity.",
        "Dorian: And as for you, Adriana -- mm-hmm -- disappointed to see that Blair is not on this list.",
        "Blair: The only way I would go to that wedding is so I could throw something at the happy couple, and it wouldn't be rice. Adriana, I don't think you'll have to worry about a wedding crasher because you're going to crash and burn way before you walk down that aisle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: What happened with Dorian seems like, well, a distant memory now.",
        "Viki: Well, then, that -- that's good.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Did you ask Viki to join us?",
        "Nora: Yes.",
        "Clint: Good.",
        "Viki: Oh, you're meeting Clint -- I'm sorry.",
        "Nora: Yes, no.",
        "Viki: Gosh -- don't you see enough of each other living under the same roof?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Clint: No, not nearly.",
        "Nora: Oh, you know -- huh! You know, some people just do it backwards, you know? Like us -- huh. Go figure. I mean, some people -- you know, they -- they date and then they move in together.",
        "Viki: Oh! Oh, you -- oh, it's you two?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Nora and I are seeing each other.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: There are plenty of reasons to get you back to Llanview.",
        "Marcie: No, not if I can't see my son.",
        "Michael: The lawyer says you should waive your right to fight the extradition. Hey, that'll just show that you're cooperative and that can only help with the charges back home.",
        "Marcie: And then what?",
        "John: You'll stand trial or you'll make a plea arrangement and then you'll be sentenced for kidnapping.",
        "Marcie: My son?",
        "Michael: Hey, well, at least back in Llanview you will be with people who know what happened, they know the story, they love you, character witnesses \u0096",
        "Marcie: Todd's money -- Todd's newspaper that he will use to make me look like public enemy number one. It's not enough for them that they've already taken away our son, Michael.",
        "Michael: But Todd doesn't own the judge and jury.",
        "Marcie: Huh. John, will you tell me the truth, because Michael obviously won't. Will you just tell me -- how much time am I going to spend in prison?",
        "Michael: He can't tell you that.",
        "Marcie: Tell me.",
        "John: You'd be facing 10 years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You said if I kept quiet about you kidnapping Shane, you'd leave us alone. What do you call this?",
        "Ramsey: Making good on my promise.",
        "Gigi: I haven't said a word!",
        "Ramsey: Then why is that mangy dog John McBain nosing around like he smells pork chops?",
        "Gigi: Hasn't he been doing that since before you ever met me?",
        "Ramsey: You always answer questions with questions?",
        "Shane: Why do you?",
        "Ramsey: Take after your mom, do you?",
        "Shane: You bet I do.",
        "Gigi: Look, Shane is my whole life, okay? I am going to do whatever it takes to keep him safe, I swear to God.",
        "Ramsey: All right, well, my job is my whole life and I'm not going to let you and your son take that away from me.",
        "Gigi: No, Sir, we're not.",
        "Ramsey: Okay. If you think that you're going to get me and my boss, Todd Manning, up on kidnapping charges, if you think that you're going to get rid of us by sending us off to jail, you're going to be the one who ends up there.",
        "Gigi: I just came from jail. The last place I want to go is back.",
        "Ramsey: All right, if you think you're going to strike a deal, use Todd Manning as a bargaining chip --",
        "Gigi: I don't know why you're so worried about little old me. I'm just a lying criminal who helped a woman steal a baby. Why would anyone listen to anything I say?",
        "Ramsey: All right, well, we're not going to give them the chance.",
        "Shane: Don't you touch her!",
        "Ramsey: Hmm?",
        "Gigi: Shane -- what -- Shane! Oh, he's sorry. He was just protecting me. You're sorry, aren't you? Tell him you're sorry.",
        "Shane: No!",
        "Gigi: Shane --",
        "Ramsey: Relax.",
        "Gigi: Oh!",
