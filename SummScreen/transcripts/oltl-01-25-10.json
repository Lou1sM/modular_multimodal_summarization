        "Natalie knows she needs a therapist to deal with the loss of Jared. And that therapist just happens to be Marty who tells her that she may have a \"dependence\" on John that is not healthy for her. But Natalie does not buy that Marty is concerned about her well being regarding John and tells Marty she just doesn't want Natalie with her boyfriend. Dani talks to Starr but tells her she does not trust Todd nor want to see him as her father knowing that he's a rapist. Tea and Todd find her and she tells them she wants to stay at Starr and Cole's for the night. Meanwhile, Jessica has gone missing. Everybody suspects that Mitch has taken her and Lowell is behind it. Lowell then arrests John and fires Brody from the force knowing that they won't \"cooperate\" with him."

        "Blair: Hey, Markko. Where is the party?",
        "Markko: All around. And thank you so much for making it happen.",
        "Blair: Well, it's fine, but I haven't seen Starr or Cole yet. Where are they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: This is Halloween. That's Jack and the one in the little rock outfit, that's Sam.",
        "Matthew: They're both different kids.",
        "Cole: Yeah, no kidding. Jack is always in your face. Trying to work an angle, you know.",
        "Starr: You never know what he is going to say next.",
        "Cole: And Sam's really quiet.",
        "Starr: [Gasps] Oh, look. Here's an even better picture of them without their costumes. There you can really see them.",
        "Dani: They're cute.",
        "Starr: Thanks. You know, I have hard copies somewhere. I just didn't get a chance to unpack them.",
        "Dani: No. It's okay.",
        "Starr: No, I left some of them at Aunt Dorian's when we ran out.",
        "Cole: Yeah, look, I'll find the prints.",
        "Dani: Stop, okay? I mean, it's nice, they're cute kids, but... all I can think is that we're Todd Manning's children.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: We're getting no help from these people. 15 minutes.",
        "T\u00e9a: Till what?",
        "Todd: Till my PIs are supposed to call me back. If they haven't found Danielle by then, I'll step it up.",
        "T\u00e9a: What does that mean?",
        "Todd: Well, I know this private security firm and these guys ask all the right questions and they can also look internationally.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, it hasn't come to that...",
        "Todd: Are you absolutely positive of that? Really? Our daughter, who was able to sneak herself and a kid in a wheelchair out of England? You're positive she hasn't gotten on a plane?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, I'm not the enemy.",
        "Todd: No, that's me.",
        "T\u00e9a: I think Rachel's onto something. She thinks Matthew was lying and she thinks Daniella's still with him.",
        "Todd: Let's go see Bo and Nora.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, let's go.",
        "Officer: All right, I'll start the paperwork.",
        "Todd: Are they locking you up, John? I guess Lowell finally got something right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Every morning, before I wake up, it's like this tape that keeps running over and over again. All the ways that--that I could've stopped Mitch from killing Jared. And every morning, I save him. And then I open my eyes.",
        "Marty: That's very natural. Very normal. It's easier for you to blame yourself than it would be to feel that it was beyond your control.",
        "Natalie: And what about blaming other people?",
        "Marty: Very common. That works, too.",
        "Natalie: No. No, except it didn't. It didn't work. I mean, I blamed John because he didn't believe that Jared was innocent. I mean, I smacked him around a little. I went to his room and I just let him have it. And then I-- and then I fell apart.",
        "Marty: Apart?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I was a mess.",
        "Marty: Well, that's probably why you went to John. Not because you were mad at him but because you needed to grieve. And you felt safe with him. I mean, you two are very close, aren't you?",
        "Natalie: Okay, this is weird. I mean, I'm John's ex and I'm going to therapy with his girlfriend? Does this work?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: They had me arrested for assault. You want to know why?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "John: Lowell had me arrested so Mitch Laurence could go after your niece Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Where's Jessica? Mosser. Hey, Jason, Jason, come on, man. Where is Jessica?",
        "Jason: I don't know.",
        "Brody: Stay with me. Hey. What happened?",
        "Jason: I was watching Jessica on the phone and I felt something sharp.",
        "Brody: Like a needle? Did you see anything else?",
        "Jason: No.",
        "Brody: Jessica's gone!",
        "Viki: Brody?",
        "Brody: Yes, ma'am. Is Jessica upstairs?",
        "Viki: No, I don't think so. I left her here.",
        "Brody: When?",
        "Viki: A few minutes ago. I went upstairs to make a--what's going on? What happened?",
        "Brody: Officer Mosser was drugged and I found Jessica's cell phone and her purse. There's no way she'd leave these behind.",
        "Viki: What are you saying? Somebody came in here and took her?",
        "Brody: They must have been watching. They waited until Jessica was alone and they grabbed her.",
        "Viki: It's gotta be Mitch.",
        "Brody: Has to be. That letter was a trap and I fell right into it.",
        "Viki: She told me about the letter. He wanted to meet her.",
        "Brody: Mitch knew we'd never let her do that. Viki, he knew I'd go to the docks instead. He knew I'd leave Jessica here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, Laurence set it up so Jessica would be alone and he had Lowell arrest me so I'd be out of the way.",
        "Officer: I'll see what Lowell wants to do. Keep an eye on him, all right?",
        "Second Officer: It's John.",
        "First Officer: Doesn't matter.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, what if Mitch took Danielle?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why would Mitch Laurence want our daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I can handle hearing about John from you. I wouldn't have suggested counseling if I didn't.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Marty: Are you uncomfortable talking about him?",
        "Natalie: No. No, I mean, John-- John's great. He knows me so well. I mean, I definitely can't fool him. We were--we were close for a really long time.",
        "Marty: Do you think about that now?",
        "Natalie: What do you mean?",
        "Marty: It's natural when a spouse dies. The loss, it's so hard to take in. And people tend to want to fill that space, you know, find a substitute. It's like a phantom spouse. And oftentimes, it's the children that takes on that role.",
        "Natalie: But I don't have any children.",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Natalie: So you think that I'm turning John into a phantom spouse?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Mitch came to see me the other day. He wanted help with Jessica.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why would he think you would help him?",
        "Todd: The sicko believed that I owe him something. I don't know. But he knew all about Danielle.",
        "T\u00e9a: What? How?",
        "Todd: I don't know. He just knew. He tried to bond with me because we both have daughters who don't understand us, so I kicked him out.",
        "T\u00e9a: So this could be payback.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I'm sorry I'm being a bitch.",
        "Starr: No, you're not.",
        "Matthew: We get it.",
        "Dani: You're all so nice and trying to make it okay, but it can't be. I mean, Todd Manning. How is that ever okay?",
        "Starr: I grew up with him. I know a different guy than who you read about.",
        "Cole: Nobody's saying it's not a big problem.",
        "Starr: And look, there's just more. That's all. There's a whole family that's involved.",
        "Dani: How does that work? Do you all get together? I don't want to be in the same room as Todd.",
        "Cole: Well, for birthdays and holidays, we make it work.",
        "Dani: How?",
        "Starr: My mom. She's the one that holds us all together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Starr and Cole had, um, a thing come up.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, a thing?",
        "Markko: They can't be here.",
        "Blair: Are you kidding me? Starr is not even gonna be here for her own 18th birthday? Something didn't happen to Hope, did it?",
        "Markko: I asked. She's fine.",
        "Blair: Well, then, what is it?",
        "Markko: I don't know. Cole said that--that they were all all right but that it couldn't be helped. It sounded important.",
        "Blair: Unbelievable. Well, is Langston here at least? Did she make it to the party?",
        "Markko: Oh, yeah, yeah. She's here and she is definitely having a good time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You're intense.",
        "Langston: Not just me.",
        "Ford: Feel.",
        "Langston: I can't--I can't do this.",
        "Ford: Okay.",
        "Langston: I love Markko.",
        "Ford: Then go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So, where is Langston?",
        "Markko: She's in the ladies room, but I can tell you she really appreciates everything you did, and so do I.",
        "Blair: Well, that's great. So, did everybody come? All your friends?",
        "Markko: Yeah. Yeah. Everybody came. I even invited that phony filmmaker.",
        "Blair: Who?",
        "Markko: His name is Ford. He lives with Cristian and Layla, so I thought it would be polite to ask. He's hanging out with them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My mom's great at keeping the peace.",
        "Cole: When she wants to.",
        "Starr: She does want peace in the family, but I'm sure your mom didn't tell you that.",
        "Dani: She didn't say anything about your mom.",
        "Starr: Really?",
        "Cole: Ha!",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Starr: They don't exactly get along.",
        "Cole: That's an understatement.",
        "Starr: Look, do you want to see a picture of my mom? That's her.",
        "Dani: I know her.",
        "Starr: You what?",
        "Dani: She was with me in Seattle when my dad, my real dad--my--",
        "Starr: You met my mom in Seattle?",
        "Dani: She was amazing to me. You're the daughter. She said she had a girl a little older than me.",
        "Starr: I guess that would be me.",
        "Dani: She really loves you.",
        "Starr: Your mom loves you, too, you know.",
        "Dani: I guess.",
        "Matthew: You know what? It's getting kind of late. My parents are probably gonna look for me. And I know your mom already is.",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Matthew: We need a plan.",
        "Dani: Can I stay with you?",
        "Starr: Sure. Under one condition.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I'm going to go see what's taking Langston so long.",
        "Blair: Don't.",
        "Markko: Why not?",
        "Langston's voice: I can't stop thinking about Ford.",
        "Blair: I'll just--I'll go get her, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Go on. Go back to Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Please, Starr. Tell your roommates I won't be any trouble.",
        "Starr: Oh, no, that's not--",
        "Dani: I'll sleep on the kitchen floor if I have to.",
        "Cole: Look, we're fine with you being here.",
        "Dani: Then what's the condition?",
        "Starr: You have to call your mom and tell her that you're here.",
        "Dani: No.",
        "Matthew: Come on, Starr. Give her a break.",
        "Dani: I can't deal with them yet.",
        "Matthew: I promised her you wouldn't make her call.",
        "Starr: Don't make promises for me, Matthew. And I didn't say \"them.\" I just said \"her.\"",
        "Dani: Like she'd come alone.",
        "Matthew: Look, what if she just calls her mom and tells her that she's okay?",
        "Dani: Yeah, then she knows I'm okay and she won't be worried.",
        "Starr: She's still gonna go nuts looking for you.",
        "Dani: Okay, then. No problem. Thanks anyway.",
        "Starr: Dani, wait. T\u00e9a will not make you see Todd.",
        "Dani: She'll tell him where I am and he'll, like, break down the door to get in here,",
        "Cole: She knows your dad.",
        "Starr: Trust me. T\u00e9a will make him stay away. You do not have to deal with Todd until you're ready, okay? Please. Call her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Tell me everything Mitch said to you.",
        "Todd: I don't remember word for word, but he offered to get rid of Cole if I'd help him with Jessica.",
        "John: Nice.",
        "T\u00e9a: What did he mean \"get rid of\"?",
        "Todd: Exactly what it sounded like. You know about this guy, don't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Did he threaten Daniella?",
        "Todd: Not in so many words, but it's always there with Mitch.",
        "T\u00e9a: John, do you think what Lowell and Mitch did tonight is about getting to Jessica?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: All right, buddy. I got EMS on the way.",
        "Viki: Bree's asleep. She's fine, thank God.",
        "Brody: I spoke to Clint. We can get more security from B.E.",
        "Viki: What about the police?",
        "Brody: They're useless with Lowell in charge. He showed up at the docks with a couple of uniforms, just in time to protect Mitch and to arrest John and me.",
        "Viki: So, how did you get here?",
        "Brody: Well, John distracted them long enough for me to get away. The second Lowell showed up, I knew.",
        "Viki: They were gonna arrest you and someone was gonna take Jessie.",
        "Brody: We have to find her.",
        "Viki: Look, I know he won't hurt her, okay? I know that. Because she's his daughter. We've got to get her back. Maybe John can help. Is there any chance he got away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Laurence may want payback for what Todd's done.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you're saying he might be after our girl?",
        "John: Maybe. I think Laurence's first move tonight is gonna be--",
        "Officer: Hey, who said you could talk?",
        "T\u00e9a: No talking? In a squad room? Are you joking? Since when did that become a rule? Now, you may all be Lowell's goons, but I'm not taking crap from any of you.",
        "Todd: Terrific. Where is she? All right, keep her there. Hey, hey. We have Dani. Come on, let's go.",

        "Natalie: Everything has been a nightmare since Jared died. You think that I want to replace Jared with John?",
        "Marty: It's not for me to say.",
        "Natalie: Well, why not? You're the professional here.",
        "Marty: It's more important for you to try to work your way through your own feelings.",
        "Natalie: For John?",
        "Marty: For your loss.",
        "Natalie: Marty, I don't have to go looking for that pain. Why do you want to talk about John?",
        "Marty: We've talked about a lot of things. We've talked about Jared. We've talked about your family. We've talked about Mitch for most of the session. It's your time.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, it is my time, but all I've said is that I gave a smack to John and--and you're saying that I want to make him my substitute husband.",
        "Marty: That's not exactly what I said.",
        "Natalie: Close enough.",
        "Marty: You feel a loss. John is a rescuer.",
        "Natalie: Uh-uh. No. No, no. John's your rescuer. That is your relationship with John.",
        "Marty: We're not talking about me.",
        "Natalie: Really? Are you sure about that, Marty? You know, I'm starting to wonder why were you so hot to want to counsel me in the first place. Marty, my husband just died and you think that I want to go out and steal your boyfriend? My God, you are a manipulative bitch.",

        "Stan: We're getting his cell ready now. You left a crime scene, Officer. You evaded arrest.",

        "Stan: Who?",
        "Brody: Mitch had her kidnapped. Where'd he take her?",

        "John: No matter what you do for him, it won't be enough, you know? Get down on your knees, you give him the keys to this city, it's not gonna change your fate. You're a snitch, Lowell. Laurence knows that. He can't let you live, because he knows you'll turn on him. So, what'd you get for being a stooge? Huh? A few months out of a cell? You get to put me away for a little while? Is that worth your life?",

        "Marty: You stabbed Mitch Laurence and he covered for you. He already rescued you.",
        "Natalie: I didn't ask him to do that. In fact, I tried to confess several times.",
        "Marty: I know, I know, and he didn't want you to.",

        "Dani: I'm sure.",

        "Viki: They lured Brody away, and then the guard outside was drugged, and somebody came in here and took her.",
        "Natalie: Well, what are we doing?",
        "Viki: Well, John is under arrest, and Brody is at the police station.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Viki: I know. The whole thing is just insane.",
        "Natalie: No, no. It makes perfect sense to that creep Lowell and Mitch. So, the cops actually went along with arresting John?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Apparently, they did.",
        "Natalie: Wow, this is not a good sign. This is not a good sign at all. That means that the cops will do anything that Lowell says.",
        "Viki: Yeah, and the commissioner is not gonna lift a finger to help us find Jessica, not even if I make a stink about it.",
