        "When Janet gets wired and attempts to get a confession from Todd, he knows what she is up to, rips her shirt and discovers her wire. Antonio and Talia go to arrest him. But Talia protects her client from the three of them. Meanwhile, Dr. Joplin's son has an unopened letter from his mother in the desk drawer of his new classroom. Dorian tells Moe that she will give her home and all of her wealth to him and to Noelle. But Noelle is worried that they will have serious consequences, as they were previously warned by Madam Delphina. In the high school, Cole is tempted to take drugs. So is Matthew."

        "Todd: Why do you want to talk so much about something that never happened, Janet, hmm?",
        "Janet: It could have happened. It would have happened if you'd just had the --",
        "Todd: Why don't we talk about what happens to people who turn on me? Would you like to talk about that?",
        "Janet: No, no, it's fine. I'll just go. Obviously, it was a mistake, me coming here.",
        "[Janet cries out]",
        "Todd: Nice try.",

        "Schuyler: All right, class, simmer down now. Does anybody have any questions about last night's assignment?",
        "Langston: I have one. Is he single?",
        "Schuyler: What was that, Ms. Wilde?",
        "Langston: Um, nothing. Sorry.",
        "Schuyler: Turn to page 215 in your textbooks.",
        "Markko: You are such a freak.",
        "Langston: Jealous much?",
        "Markko: You wish.",
        "Schuyler: Ms. Dickinson, what's going on?",
        "Dickinson: We have determined that drugs are being sold on the school property.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Garth: Look who it is -- son of narc. Still trying to get people to think you're high when you're the straightest kid in the school?",
        "Matthew: If I'm the straightest kid in school, then why do I have these?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You're not sure your father killed your mother, but you testified against him.",
        "Lola: I know, I know, but --",
        "T\u00e9a: But what? You can trust me, Lola. You need to tell me everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: What's wrong, Noelle?",
        "Noelle: Honestly? Delphina, the psychic.",
        "Carlotta: Uh-huh.",
        "Noelle: She told me something she saw.",
        "Carlotta: Uh-huh, and how much did that cost you?",
        "Noelle: No, I know, I know. It's silly. I shouldn't give it another thought, but I'm worried, Carlotta.",
        "Carlotta: What did Delphina say?",
        "Noelle: She said that great power and fabulous wealth were going to cause big trouble for Moe and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Yes, you -- you, Maurice \"Moe\" Stubbs, to you I bequeath all of my worldly goods, but please, do not allow it to corrupt you the way that it corrupted me.",
        "Moe: I don't understand.",
        "Dorian: Perhaps David Vickeroshi can explain it to you better.",
        "David: In an attempt to prove to me that she is genuine about trying to achieve nirvana, Dorian is giving up all of her worldly goods and possessions. It would appear that she is giving them to you, Moe. Namaste.",
        "Moe: Nama who? Lady, did you spike your herbal T\u00e9a this morning?",
        "Dorian: I have never felt more generous or more cleansed in my entire life. Maurice, La Boulaie and all of its contents are yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You've been a very bad girl. This isn't playing fair, is it?",
        "Talia: He found the wire.",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Todd: Talk about ungrateful.",
        "Janet: No!",
        "Antonio: She's been compromised. We're going in.",
        "Talia: This is not good.",
        "Todd: You know what they do to rats, Janet?",
        "Todd: Wasn't I good to you, Janet? I paid you a fortune to be loyal, and this is how you repay me.",
        "Janet: You -- you don't understand. I was on the run.",
        "Todd: Not from me, you weren't. You'd have never heard from me except for those transfers to your bank account. You had no reason to fear me, but you do now.",
        "Janet: You can't hurt me, because if you do, they'll catch you. The police are right outside.",
        "Todd: Oh, you're working for the cops.",
        "Talia: Freeze.",
        "Antonio: Put your hands in the air.",
        "Janet: Oh, thank God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dickinson: As you all know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs at this school and that goes double for selling it on the school property. Now, we will conduct a full investigation into this matter, and whoever is found to be involved will face suspension as well as possible criminal charges. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to remind those of you who are 18 years of age that you are no longer considered juveniles in the eyes of the law. Convictions of any kind will stay with you for the rest of your lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I told you, I am required by law not to divulge anything you say to me. It's called lawyer-client confidentiality.",
        "Lola: The night my mother died, I was in my room sleeping. I heard some shouting and I woke up. My mother and father were arguing about something. They were so loud it scared me, so I went to their door. They stopped right away. My father brought me back to bed and told me that -- that grownups sometimes fight, and he promised that everything was going to be okay, and then he tucked me in, and he told me that he loved me, and he kissed me goodnight, and I fell asleep. Then I woke up again, and I'm not sure why, but I went to their door. And that's when I saw -- when I saw my father. He was on his knees beside my mother's body.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's okay. Keep going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: This just isn't right. I can't take your house and all your -- your stuff.",
        "Dorian: Why not?",
        "Moe: Oh, it's not mine. It's yours.",
        "Dorian: No, they are not mine either.",
        "Moe: What are you trying to say? You stole all of this?",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes, you could say that, spiritually speaking.",
        "Moe: And I don't know what kind of cult move you're trying to pull here, pal --",
        "David: Namaste, new friend.",
        "Moe: Now you have got to stop with that.",
        "Dorian: Oh, but David has not done anything to me. No, I have chosen to follow the path, the path of the good and the true.",
        "David: The noble and the enlightened.",
        "Dorian: Yes, the noble and the enlightened. So, he has been my longtime friend and my sometime lover, who has shown me what is possible, and that is true inner peace.",
        "David: Not bad, Dorian. Namaste.",
        "Dorian: Thank you. Therefore, Moe, I have chosen you to be the recipient of my largesse.",
        "David: Of your devotion.",
        "Dorian: Right, my devotion and my largesse. Moe, come on. Do you not want the finer things in life?",
        "Moe: It is beyond generous for you to even think of me, but I can't accept.",
        "David: Moe, you are a man of genuine clarity and wisdom. You, Dorian, on the other hand --",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute. David, David, David, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to understand. I am very serious about this.",
        "David: I believe what I have been present to see and to hear. Moe has said no. If you wish to take a vow of poverty and abstinence as I have, you will have to find another way to shed your wealth.",
        "Dorian: But there is no other plan. I mean to say, Maurice is the man that I have chosen to have all of the things that I own.",
        "David: Dorian, I hope that's not because you think that you can get them back.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me?",
        "David: You can't give your things away to someone you know so that when you change your mind you may retrieve them.",
        "Dorian: David, don't you think you're being just a tad bit negative and judgmental?",
        "David: Prove yourself. Give everything away to charity, perfect strangers. I can have the unwashed homeless people back here in five minutes if you dial the phone for me.",

        "Talia: What happened?",
        "Janet: He figured out about the wire.",
        "Talia: You ripped open her shirt?",
        "Todd: I was looking for this.",
        "Antonio: Shut up.",
        "Todd: Do you guys got a warrant --",
        "Antonio: I said shut up. You're going down for the assault and attempted rape of Lee Halpern.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: I'm okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: You sure?",
        "Lola: I just stood there, looking at her. I don't even know how long I was there for until my father turned and noticed me, his face full of tears. I asked him what happened, and he said that an intruso had come into my house when he had taken me back to bed. An intruso stabbed my mother and ran away. The police came.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did they find the murder weapon?",
        "Lola: No, they thought that the intruso had left with it.",
        "T\u00e9a: But they never found him.",
        "Lola: No, because there was no intruso. Vanessa and I found the knife years later. It was in my house, hidden by my father. We took it to the police and Papi was arrested. It was awful.",
        "T\u00e9a: I am so sorry, Lola, but what you said about your father not being guilty, why did you say that? Was it something about the way you found the weapon? Was it something about Vanessa?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I have to take this. Hold on. I'll just be a second. I'm right in the middle of something, Todd. What is it?",
        "Todd: Yeah, so am I. The cops are here in my home, and I'm about to be arrested.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, don't say a word. I'll be right there. I am so sorry. It's an emergency. I have to go, but I want to finish what we were talking about as soon as I am done. Keep your cell phone on, okay, so I can reach you. Lola, I know it doesn't feel like it now, but getting this off your chest is the best thing you can do for yourself, okay? Whatever happened, we're going to make it right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Moe, is this not why you came to Llanview, why you decided to stay, so that you could pursue your culinary arts and give yourself and your lovely fianc\u00e9e a better life?",
        "Moe: Well, yeah, but I want to work for a living and get ahead on my own steam, not take my boss's house and everything in it while she's going through a midlife crisis.",
        "David: Actually, you would be assisting Dorian in achieving inner peace.",
        "Dorian: I beg you to reconsider.",
        "Moe: Uh, wow, she's serious about this, huh?",
        "David: It appears to be genuine, but until she has shed all material goods, it cannot be believed.",
        "Dorian: Moe, I want you to take all my stuff. I beg of you. I beg of you, because that is the only way that I will be able to climb the heights and reach spiritual enlightenment, which is what I aspire to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: So, who wants to talk about what Vice Principal Dickinson had to say about drugs being sold here at school? Anybody? Guys, I know this is hard, and if you or anyone you know is involved, you may be afraid to step forward and do something about it, but I'm urging you.",
        "Markko: You urge us to what? Snitch?",
        "Schuyler: If someone you know is mixed up in drugs, that person needs help, and they're not going to get it unless you come clean, okay?",
        "Roger: All you do is come clean, huh? Cool.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, you know what I mean, Roger, and if you don't have anything intelligent to say, how about you practice not saying anything at all, okay?",
        "Langston: Look, I'm not saying in know anyone buying or using drugs, but do you know how much pressure is on people who do know somebody who's doing that? Do you know what it's like trying to keep it hidden and not look like a rat?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, yeah, I actually do know how that feels. And when you cover for somebody who has an addiction, do you know what you're doing? You're enabling that person to keep using. Okay, I could continue, but I think this time would be better spent letting you guys off early so that you can reflect -- hey, hey -- so you can reflect about the issues that were discussed here today -- drug use, dealing, selling, snitching, wrong, and right, but don't -- this isn't playtime. Don't think you can just go hang out with your friends. By next class, I want a thousand word essay on the physiological ramifications of an illegal drug on the human body, and don't think that you can just cut and paste from the internet, okay? I want -- I want sources. I want specifics. I want quotes from local experts -- a doctor at Llanview Hospital, a researcher at the university, a case worker at the rehab clinic. The quotes are going to be mandatory. So help me, I will be checking.",
        "[Bell]",
        "Schuyler: Okay, you're dismissed. Go.",
        "Markko: Still think he's hot?",
        "Langston: Oh, come on, you big baby. We still got a lot of researching to do.",
        "Starr: Can we talk?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. I just --",
        "Starr: I know someone who's using.",

        "Becca: Hey, where'd you get those?",
        "Matthew: I have my ways.",
        "Garth: What are they?",
        "Matthew: Pain killers.",
        "Garth: What, like aspirins?",
        "Matthew: No, but you keep telling yourself that, tough guy.",
        "Becca: You on one now?",
        "Matthew: No, you want one?",
        "Garth: You first?",
        "Matthew: Not here. Let's go to the baseball diamond.",
        "Cole: Hey, Matthew, can I borrow you for a second?",
        "Matthew: Um, yeah.",
        "Garth: We'll wait over there.",
        "Cole: Hey, you stole those pills from my locker, didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Well, if you're ready to talk about someone who's involved with drugs here at school, then we can go see Ms. Dickinson right now.",
        "Starr: Oh, no, no, please. You're really easy to talk to, and I -- I just wanted to -- I don't know -- ask your advice. After all, you did tell me everything about your drug problem and what happened.",
        "Schuyler: Starr --",
        "Starr: I was just hoping you could help --",
        "Schuyler: Starr, that was wrong of me and completely inappropriate for me to burden you with stuff like that.",
        "Starr: No, it wasn't. After everything that happened with your mom and my dad, we have that connection, and it just happened. What's so wrong with that?",
        "Schuyler: Come on, take a seat.",
        "Schuyler: What do you need my advice about?",
        "Starr: I don't know what to do.",
        "Schuyler: About what?",
        "Starr: How do you help someone who doesn't want to be helped?",
        "Schuyler: Is this about a friend?",
        "Starr: Oh, yes, it is about a friend. I'm not just saying that. It's not me. It's some one that I care about, and I don't know how to stop this person from doing this thing.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, Starr, the thing is you can't make them do anything. They're going to get help only if they want to get help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Look, dude, I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Cole: Hey, stop lying to me. Look, I'm not going to bust you. I just need you to tell me the truth.",
        "Matthew: Okay, fine, I took them.",
        "Cole: And you told that kid and that girl over there that you had the pills.",
        "Matthew: So what if I did?",
        "Cole: Matthew, the school is going ballistic over the fact that drugs are being dealt here. Ms. Dickinson just talked to my class. She practically begged students to narc. With you running your mouth the way you have, how long do you think it's going to take before someone turns you in, huh? I'll cover for you this time, but you need to cut this crap out.",
        "Matthew: Hey, I heard Starr yelling at you for having those pills, so why are you taking them?",
        "Dickinson: Boys, everything all right here?",
        "Cole: Everything's fine.",
        "Dickinson: Didn't look fine to me. You two having a problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: My fianc\u00e9 Moe Stubbs works here. I need to see him.",
        "Maid: He's in the living room with Dr. Lord.",
        "Noelle: Oh, I knew it. So sorry to interrupt, but we need --",
        "Moe: Babe, you're not going to believe this. Baby, we're rich.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Yeah, we're on our way in. How does it feel, manning, to know that no matter where you go I'll never stop until I bring you in. Put your hands up. You can't keep your hands off the ladies, can you?",
        "Talia: Antonio, watch it.",
        "T\u00e9a: You want to let go of my client, 'Tonio?",
        "Talia: A charge of police brutality will not look good on your record.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: What do you mean we're rich?",
        "Moe: You're not going to believe this.",
        "Dorian: I am taking the path to enlightenment.",
        "Noelle: Come again?",
        "David: Dorian is going to join me on the spiritual path to wholeness. And in so doing, she will relinquish all her worldly possessions.",
        "Moe: She gave us the house, Noelle.",
        "Noelle: I'm sorry?",
        "Moe: The house, all the stuff in it, and all her money. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. It's like we hit the jackpot, baby!",
        "David: You have veiled eyes after all. These riches are an obstacle to inner peace, though I understand the draw.",
        "Noelle: Moe, have you been making your daddy's wake-n-bake brownie recipe in that high-tech kitchen?",
        "Moe: I promise you, Noelle, this is the real deal. Dorian's going to sign over everything to me, to us. [Sputtering] Isn't this the greatest day ever?",
        "Dorian: Now do you believe that I am sincere?",
        "David: I do. You've done it, Dorian. Namaste. Now show Noelle your closet. She's going to love your former wardrobe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Matthew and I were arguing about the Sixers.",
        "Dickinson: I had a visit from your parents. They told me that they caught you with a joint and that you bought it from somebody here at this school. Who's providing you with drugs, Mr. Buchanan?",
        "Matthew: See, my parents have it all wrong. I've never smoked pot. That's the truth.",
        "Dickinson: I know that you and Matthew are close and that you live in the same house. I have to say I was disappointed when it came out that you were using steroids last year, but I really admired the way that you took responsibility for your actions. You could be a role model to Matthew now. You could show him what's right and what's wrong. Now get back to class. Both of you.",
        "Matthew: Dude, if she finds me with those pills, I'm dead.",
        "Cole: Okay, give them back to me. Come on, hurry up. You leave this stuff alone, all right? And the pot, too. I'm serious.",
        "Matthew: Hey, who the heck are you to tell me to stop doing drugs when you're doing them yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: The insidious thing about drugs is that they change who we are. I mean, anytime a person battles addiction, addiction wins. It wins against friends, against family, everything. And you can't make them do anything. You can suggest they seek counseling, NA -- narcotic anonymous -- any number of things. And you can stay on them about it. You really can. But in the end, they're only going to get clean if they want to.",
        "Starr: I hate this so much, you have no idea. It is just this big waste.",
        "Schuyler: I know. It will be okay.",
        "Starr: Yeah, what if it's not? I'm sorry. I -- just forget that I said that. I have to go. Oh, you know what? Um -- did my dad's lawyer ever question you?",
        "Schuyler: Uh, no. And if she had, I would have told her the same thing I told the police, which is whatever your dad was planning on doing with your baby, there's no way my mom could have been involved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You don't move.",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you hurt? Ms. Ketring -- or Lee Halpern, whatever it is you call yourself these days, good to see you. You came in here wearing a wire?",
        "Talia: Don't worry, we had a court order.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really?",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did the court order extend to you busting in here, guns drawn?",
        "Talia: Your client, a convicted rapist, attacked our witness.",
        "T\u00e9a: My guess is you went for the wire because Ms. Ketring's statement didn't help your case against Todd. And when she couldn't get him to incriminate himself, you busted in here and things got physical.",
        "Talia: Ah.",
        "T\u00e9a: I would hate to see your butt on suspension for improper conduct, 'Tonio.",
        "Antonio: It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "T\u00e9a: And it won't be the last if you keep bursting into people's personal homes.",
        "Talia: Excuse me, he ripped open her shirt.",
        "T\u00e9a: Because she was wearing a wire. What -- what did you hear him say? That he paid her large amounts of money as a nurse for many months?",
        "Antonio: He paid her large amounts of money to keep her mouth shut.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ah, details, details. What matters is that the courts have determined that there was no crime committed here while Marty Saybrooke was here as Todd's guest.",
        "Antonio: Guest?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm.",
        "Antonio: You know, I don't know what spell he has you under, but you better break it fast.",
        "T\u00e9a: Tell me something, 'Tonio. That van parked out there, where you and your partner had your little listening party, did you hear my client say a single thing that incriminated him?",
        "Janet: They have me. And they have his daughter. You tried to kidnap that baby and you paid me off to help you do it. I have immunity. What do you have?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: Are you out of your cotton-picking mind?",
        "Moe: No.",
        "Noelle: Or what? What, taking over this house and all of Dorian Lord's possessions and becoming what, Lord of a manor? You're a cook. I'm a waitress. You said you had all the things money can't buy.",
        "Moe: I said that because I was broke. But Dorian convinced me she wants to do this. She wants me to benefit from it. She wants us to benefit from it.",
        "Noelle: And you think it's all going to go real smooth, and Dorian's not going to want anything in return?",
