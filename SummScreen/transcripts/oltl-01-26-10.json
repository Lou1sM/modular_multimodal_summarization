        "Todd: I'm sure they're gonna find her.",
        "Viki: Who, the police? This is their fault! They're the ones that let Mitch go!",
        "Todd: Yeah, thanks to Dorian, huh?",
        "Viki: I know. I still cannot believe that she fired Bo. What was she thinking? Did she not know what was going to happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Remind me to thank Delphina for skipping town. Oh!",
        "Bo: You know, she could've at least left a bed or a couch cushion or --",
        "Nora: Mm. There is that.",
        "Bo: You know what we can do?",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Bo: Let's call one of those mattress companies. They guarantee they can deliver the same day.",
        "Nora: Bo?",
        "Bo: Hmm?",
        "Nora: It's nighttime.",
        "Bo: Ah. Well, we can check back into the hotel.",
        "Nora: Oh, bite your tongue.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Guess we waited this long. We can --",
        "Nora: We can. Let me tell you something, sir. We have waited long enough to know how we feel about each other. We've waited long enough for Clint to know how we feel about each other. We've waited long enough for me to leave him, and now Matthew's gone for at least another hour.",
        "Bo: Ah.",
        "Nora: I'm not waiting any longer.",

        "Viki: I wish there were, but without Bo there at the station --",
        "Todd: You know what? I'm gonna hate myself in the morning for this, but maybe I could get his old job back for him.",
        "Viki: How?",
        "Todd: Well, I could use the \"Sun\" to slander Lowell and get him impeached or recalled or whatever it is they do to police commissioners, and then I could maybe sic the investigator on him, and maybe they could find Jessica in the interim.",
        "Viki: That would be good. That would be -- oh, God! I never called Clint.",

        "Stacy: Huh?",
        "Schuyler: Hey. You ok?",
        "Gigi: Work was brutal! I had a table of 12. They ordered half the menu and -- guess what they left me? 1.50. So, all I wanna do is park myself on the couch, watch some really dumb TV, and -- what's all this? Has Rachel got company?",

        "Greg: Hey.",

        "Greg: Ooh. You ordered ribs from smoky's?",
        "Rachel: And pecan pie. I knew you were working late, so I figured you could use some sustenance.",
        "Greg: Well, I can think of something else that I need.",
        "Rachel: Mmm. I think I can manage that. But where?",
        "Greg: Well, we can go back to my place, but yours is closer.",
        "Rachel: Uh. I told Schuyler that he could have the apartment to himself. He has plans with Gigi.",

        "Schuyler: Hmm. Well, I want you to relax. No distractions. No worries. And -- where is it? No interruptions.",

        "Stacy: Hmm.",
        "Rex: So, how's the baby?",
        "Stacy: Tiny dancer's kicking up a storm. I swear that kid can't wait to get out of there. Which means you and I need to have a talk.",
        "Rex: What do you mean?",
        "Stacy: We have to pick out a name, Rex. This kid's gonna be here before we know it.",
        "Rex: You're right. I've been so caught up with this Mitch thing --",
        "Stacy: Oh, no, no, no. Please. I don't want to hear his name tonight.",
        "Rex: Sorry.",

        "Clint: You know, the hard sell really isn't necessary.",
        "Kim: It's the truth. You're a very attractive man.",
        "Clint: Who's old enough to be your father.",
        "Kim: What can I say? I like rich, powerful men. It turns me on when I walk into that boardroom and you're crushing some arrogant tycoon. I like it when you get angry and you pull out your shotgun and you shoot something.",
        "[Clint laughs]",
        "Kim: I like it when I make you laugh. And I think you like having me around. I'm not that much trouble.",
        "Clint: Oh, we'll see about that.",
        "Kim: I'm definitely good company and -- totally easy on the eyes. Isn't that enough -- for now?",

        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Kim: No calls. No work. No nothing.",
        "Clint: But that could be important.",
        "Kim: Well, whatever or whoever it is, they can wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Clint, it's Viki. Listen, call me just as soon as you get this. Please. It cannot wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: All work and no play makes you an unhappy boy. You need to relax.",
        "Clint: Oh, I know, yeah, but I'm not sure that this is the answer.",
        "Kim: Then you've had a dull life. Come on. It's not like we haven't been here before.",
        "Clint: No, no, no, no. No, before, nothing happened. That was just for show, for Nora.",
        "Kim: Honey -- there is nothing that Nora can do that I can't do 10 times better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, God. You warm enough?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: Okay. This isn't how I remembered it.",
        "Bo: No good?",
        "Nora: Better -- than ever. Why is that? How'd that happen?",
        "Bo: I don't know.",
        "Nora: Is it because we waited so long? Huh. And because we --",
        "Bo: Red. Red, red, red, red. Do we have to analyze?",
        "Nora: Well, I found that in my professional capacity as --",
        "Bo: No! [Laughs]",
        "[Nora laughs]",
        "Bo: Oh, it's good to see you smile again.",
        "Nora: Oh, God, it's so good to smile. I just wish that --",
        "Bo: That my brother would calm down? Yeah.",
        "Nora: I want him to be happy. I really do. This -- this feels unfair.",
        "Bo: Well, he brought it on himself.",
        "Nora: How so? Because -- because I'm yours?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Well, it works both ways, mister.",
        "Bo: You bet it does.",
        "[Kissing]",
        "Nora: I never should've married him.",
        "Bo: He never should've asked you. I know he's -- he's really hurting right now and I feel awful about that, but -- it's gonna take some time. Someday soon, hopefully, being happy and feeling guilty won't go hand in hand.",
        "Nora: Oh, God. You promise?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: What's the matter?",
        "Clint: Uh, not a thing.",
        "Kim: I thought we weren't gonna lie to each other. You don't like my outfit? I can change.",
        "Clint: The outfit is fine.",
        "Kim: Then what is it?",
        "Clint: Kimberly -- you're a very beautiful, sexy, young woman. Everything a man could possibly want.",
        "Kim: But?",
        "Clint: But it wasn't that long ago that I was sharing that bed with my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: That is the best dim sum in the country.",
        "Bo: You're right.",
        "Nora: Napkin?",
        "Bo: Oh! Ha ha!",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Nora: Okay. Oh, you're phone. Your coat's ringing. Yeah. This? Here you go.",
        "Bo: Go to voicemail?",
        "Nora: No.",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Viki: Bo, oh, thank God. It's Viki.",
        "Bo: Hey, Viki.",
        "Viki: Listen, do you know where Clint is?",
        "Bo: I don't know where Clint is. Did you try his cell phone?",
        "Viki: He's not answering his cell, and I'm afraid something's happened.",
        "Bo: Why? What's going on?",
        "Viki: It's Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What are you doing here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I -- I dropped some stuff off for Dani at Starr's and then I went to the Buenos Dias, you know, thinking I'd have some soup and check my emails, but I couldn't stop thinking about Viki. How's she doing?",
        "Todd: We haven't heard anything.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, I'm not usually one for capital punishment, but in Mitch Laurence's case?",
        "Todd: Oh, I'd pull the switch.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. He's not gonna go after Dani, right?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. She's safe. All my kids are safe. I've made sure they're protected.",
        "T\u00e9a: But -- but what if he does try to go after --",
        "Todd: Mitch? Nah. He can't touch her. End of story.",
        "T\u00e9a: How did he get to Jessica?",
        "Todd: Listen, I'd do anything to keep my kids safe. Don't worry about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm not naming my daughter Kim.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Okay. I'll trade you a Kim for a Rex, Jr.",
        "Rex: [Sighs] R.J. No. I know an R.J. I don't like him any more than I like Kim. How about Bo, Jr.?",
        "Stacy: B.J. Balsom? Oh, the kid'll never make it out of kindergarten.",
        "Rex: You got a point. But I thought you were so sure that this is a girl.",
        "Stacy: Okay. So we got Lil' Kim --",
        "Rex: You know what? She doesn't need to be named after anybody. This little girl needs her own thing. Not some hand-me-down. What?",
        "Stacy: I never thought I'd see you so happy about this baby.",
        "Rex: Well, it's kind of fun, you know? Thinking about -- what she'll be like. What kind of music she'll be into. Maybe she will be a dancer. Or maybe we've got a long board champ on our hands. Or, you know, a scientist. Who knows? Anything's possible.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Rex: Gigi had to do all this on her own. I wonder if she had any fun with it. Or if she was just scared to death.",
        "Stacy: Well, we're a team, Rex. This baby's gonna have both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Ha ha.",
        "Gigi: This was so good.",
        "Schuyler: Hey. No. No, you don't. No.",
        "Gigi: You shouldn't have to do everything.",
        "Schuyler: I would do anything for you. Don't you know that?",
        "Gigi: You okay?",
        "Kim: You're gonna get your hands on some oxytocin. You're gonna give it to Stacy. We're all gonna live happily ever after.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. You've been clearing tables all day. Let me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: If we're keeping it real? Nora's not your wife, not since she started looking at your brother.",
        "Clint: I know. And I hate her for that.",
        "Kim: You still love her. You know she's not coming back. And you gotta start taking care of yourself. Make yourself happy. That means getting back in the saddle.",
        "Clint: [Laughs] So, what you're saying is --",
        "Kim: Giddyap.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Thanks, Viki. I'll get right on it.",
        "Nora: All right. Okay, Nigel said that Clint came home a little while ago, so, thank God he's all right.",
        "Bo: Did you talk to him?",
        "Nora: No, he told Nigel he didn't want to be disturbed. And besides, this isn't the kind of thing you can tell him over the phone.",
        "Bo: No. No, it isn't. Look, I'm gonna get over there.",
        "Nora: Um, Bo, I -- maybe this is something that I should do. I mean, let's face it, he doesn't want to see either one of us, but there are other things that you could be doing.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I guess. Are you ready to face him?",
        "Nora: Oh, please. What's the worst that could happen? [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you need to get out of town. Go somewhere new. Let the rest of the family worry about the business for a while. Take a vacation.",
        "Clint: By myself?",
        "Kim: Sure. Why not? You love to shoot things. Go shoot something big.",
        "[Clint chuckles]",
        "Kim: Like an elephant or something.",
        "Clint: You want me to go to Africa?",
        "Kim: I want you to cheer the hell up. And if that means that you have to take some time for yourself, lick your wounds a little --",
        "Clint: No, that's not my style.",
        "Kim: Now, me -- I'd jump on someone new. There's nothing that'll ease your pain like a warm body. But you're different.",
        "Clint: I wouldn't be so sure about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: We are gonna get caught and you are gonna get canned.",
        "Greg: Never happen. They love me here.",
        "Rachel: Who's they?",
        "Greg: Everybody. Besides, you've seen those hospital dramas. They catch us making out and the next thing you know, I am chief of staff.",
        "Rachel: God help the hospital.",
        "Greg: What are you talking about? I'd make a great chief of staff. I'd turn this place upside down.",
        "Rachel: Don't I know it. Mm. But I have to get going soon.",
        "Greg: Oh, no, no, no. We're supposed to have dinner together.",
        "Rachel: I have to catch up with T\u00e9a.",
        "Greg: What, is Danielle still missing?",
        "Rachel: No, they found her and she's okay. But it's complicated. And I think T\u00e9a could use my help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a. Hi.",
        "T\u00e9a: Viki, I am so sorry. I heard -- I was with Todd when he heard about Jessica. Is there anything that I can do?",
        "Viki: No, I don't know. I don't think there is anything. It seems all we can do is just pray and wait for news.",
        "Todd: Where is everyone?",
        "Viki: Well, Natalie went to the police station because without Bo being there, you know, they won't tell us anything on the phone.",
        "Todd: And where's Charlie?",
        "Viki: Uh -- Charlie would be here if he could. I just wish Clint would get here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You want me in bed with you.",
        "Stacy: No, that's not what I meant. I just -- I figured you could use some sleep, and this is your bed after all.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I don't think that's such a good idea. No.",
        "Stacy: Why not? It's not like we'd be cheating on anyone, and I'm not gonna come on to you.",
        "Rex: You're not?",
        "Stacy: I'm pregnant. All right? I don't exactly feel like whipping out spikes and pasties.",
        "Rex: Yeah, that would be a little --",
        "Stacy: Ugly? Yeah.",
        "Rex: You're not ugly, Stacy. You're pregnant. It's beautiful.",
        "Stacy: Really?",
        "Rex: All pregnant women are beautiful.",
        "Stacy: Oh. Well, anyway, if you want to bunk with me and Lil' Kim or Lil' Bo, you're welcome to. I get to bond with the baby all day. You hardly ever get any daddy time. Don't you want to cuddle up to your little kid?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Rex: Hey. We were just talking about you. Come in.",
        "Bo: Thanks.",
        "Rex: What's going on?",
        "Bo: I'm sorry, Balsom. Your sister Jessica's missing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Clint, I'm so sorry to barge in, but -- oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So now that we're alone, where's your husband?",
        "Viki: Look, Todd, I told you --",
        "Todd: To mind my own business. Yes, I heard you loud and clear. So where is he? If I can show up, he can show up.",
        "Viki: He -- he would be here, okay, if he knew the details.",
        "Todd: What details does he need to know? Mitch Laurence snatched your kid. What else is there to know?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look who I found.",
        "Viki: Oh, gosh. Sweetheart, what are you doing up?",
        "Bree: Grandma, where's my mommy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Is this really necessary?",
        "Rex: Well, you got a better idea?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Rex: Look, I don't like this any better than you do, it's just --",
        "Gigi: I know, I know. We don't have a choice.",
        "Rex: It's my fault.",
        "Gigi: Don't say that. How could it be your fault? Listen, I'll pack a bag and meet you at Viki's.",
        "Rex: Okay, all right. I should be there in about 20 minutes. Gig?",
        "Gigi: Yeah?",
        "Rex: It's going to be all right.",
        "Gigi: It has to be, Balsom.",
        "Schuyler: You're -- you're packing a bag?",
        "Gigi: Oh, yeah! It's not for me, it's for Shane.",
        "Schuyler: What for?",
        "Gigi: Rex and I are sending him out of town to keep him safe.",
        "Schuyler: From what?",
        "Gigi: Mitch Laurence. He just kidnapped Rex's sister, Jessica.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, my God.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Schuyler: But I thought Rex said that Mitch wasn't going after Shane.",
        "Gigi: We can't take any chances. Bo is going to hide Shane someplace where Mitch can't find him.",
        "Schuyler: Well -- I mean, what about -- what about, you know, Stacy? Sorry. I -- you know, I just figured that maybe she should go away, too.",
        "Gigi: Not my problem. I got to go.",
        "Schuyler: Wait -- okay, let me just finish getting dressed. I'll go with you.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, no, I can't have you there. I have to say good-bye to Shane, and it'll just make things harder.",
        "Schuyler: Oh. Right.",
        "Gigi: I got to run.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Um, be careful.",
        "Gigi: I will.",
        "Schuyler: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi's going to bring Shane's stuff.",
        "Bo: Shane's with a sitter?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Balsom, you all right?",
        "Rex: I was just thinking about Jessica. That was the one good thing to come out of all this, you know? She's my sister.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: She's such a good person. For Mitch to just take her --",
        "Bo: Okay, but right now, we have to think about things that we can do. And one of them is to make sure that Shane and Stacy are safe.",
        "Rex: You really think Shane's safer away from his parents?",
        "Bo: Shane will be with Nora and me, and I can't think of a safer place than the Buchanan ranch. Now, Chuck Wilson and his ranch hands, they shoot first, ask questions later.",
        "Rex: Mitch took out about half a dozen cops in Napa.",
        "Bo: That's because they didn't see it coming. Our boys'll be prepared. Now, Mitch and any of his people, they're gonna look like Swiss cheese if they set foot on that property. Look. Why don't you and Stacy come with us?",
        "Rex: That's an idea.",
        "Stacy: Oh, no. I can't fly, not this late in the pregnancy. The doctor told me last time I was there.",
        "Rex: She's right. She's almost due.",
        "Bo: Okay. All right, but Shane'll be fine. Nora and I won't let him out of our sight. This way, you can focus on Stacy.",
        "Stacy: Right, and our baby.",
        "Rex: I just don't like the idea of being that far away from Shane.",
        "Bo: Okay, Balsom. Take it from me. Sometimes the best way to protect your kid is to accept the fact that you don't have all the answers.",
        "Rex: You think your brother would buy that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Kind of in the middle of something.",
        "Nora: I know. Believe me, I am so sorry I interrupted.",
        "Kim: What is that, two for two? How'd you even get in here?",
        "Nora: Okay, Nigel.",
        "Kim: I'll have a talk with the staff.",
        "Nora: Yeah, good luck with that. Uh, listen. Nigel told me that you were upstairs in bed. I didn't know.",
        "Kim: And what? You thought he'd just crawl back under the covers?",
        "Nora: I need to talk to Clint.",
        "Clint: If you have anything to say to me, you talk to my attorneys.",
        "Nora: Okay, Clint, we don't have time for this. We have got to get to Viki's. It's Jessica. She's in trouble.",
        "Clint: What happened?",
        "Nora: Mitch Laurence has her.",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Nora: I tried calling you. You're not answering --",
        "Clint: What the hell happened?",
        "Nora: I don't have the details.",
        "Clint: Let's go. I'll drive. Kimberly, don't wait up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I found Bree in the hall outside her mom's room.",
        "Viki: Oh. Well, uh, Mommy had to go on a little trip, that's all, and she just -- she didn't want to wake you up.",
        "Bree: Is she sick again?",
        "Viki: No! No. No, darling. No, she's fine. She's fine.",
        "Bree: When will she be back?",
        "Viki: Well, she'll be back very soon. I'm sure she will be. Okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: I happen to know for a fact that your mother is thinking about you right now. And even though she's not here right now, she loves you very, very much. I have a little girl myself. Well, she's not so young anymore. She's not your age, but when she was and I used to go away on business trips whenever I came back, she'd have a picture for me, a picture of what she'd been doing while I was away. Do you want to draw a picture for your mom? Come on. Come on.",
        "Todd: You got crayons? Yeah? Where are they, in your playroom? I'll go get them.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't listen to him.",
        "[Viki sighs]",
        "Viki: Oh, God. Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rachel: Ooh! Hey, mom.",
        "Nora: Hi, sweetheart. Listen. Um, Bo and I are gonna leave town for a couple of days. We're, um, gonna go down to the ranch, and I was wondering if you would be able to take care of Matthew for me. I -- I just -- he's missed so much school already, I just don't think that he should come along.",
        "Rachel: Sure, no problem. What's going on? Oh, my God. Yeah, of course he can stay with me. Absolutely. Well, you do what you have to do. And, Mom, please, be safe.",
        "Nora: Bye-bye. Hey. Hi, Stacy, Shane, Rex. So? Um, any problems?",
        "Bo: No. All systems are go.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, you ready for a fun trip?",
        "Shane: If I have to.",
        "Nora: Well, I know it wasn't much notice, but you're gonna love the ranch. It's fabulous. There's horses and wagons and cowboys and a barn with a big hayloft. And there's a rope swing. And Matthew loves it there.",
        "Rex: Mm-hmm. It'll be great.",
        "Bo: Did you find Clint?",
        "Nora: Uh, yeah.",
        "Bo: How did it go?",
        "Nora: It was -- informative.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Clint, this is all my fault! You know that, don't you? I should never, ever have stepped down as mayor and given Dorian the opening because the first thing she did, she fired Bo! And now look what's happened.",
        "Clint: Mitch would have simply found another way.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. That's no comfort.",
        "Clint: Have you talked to John McBain?",
        "Viki: Oh, that's another thing. He's been arrested.",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Viki: Yeah, that's Lowell's doing, on Mitch's orders, no doubt. Natalie and Brody are down at the police station now. They're trying to arrange bail. Well, I don't hold out any hope for that because Lowell is just gonna drag his heels. And we sit here doing absolutely nothing, and Mitch has Jessica! Do you know what Bree said to me?",
        "Clint: Does Bree know that her mother's gone?",
        "Viki: Yes. And I had to lie to her. I told her that mommy was on a trip someplace. But she said, \"Is mommy sick again?\" Well, I mean, of course I said no, but what if she breaks down?",
        "Clint: Viki, no. She's integrated.",
        "Viki: Clint, this trauma could devastate her. What if she has to go through that all over again?",
        "Clint: Look, we are going to find her. On the way over here, I made some calls, and my people are already on it.",
        "Viki: And what about Bree? I was here in the house when they took Jessica. We had an armed guard. Believe me, if Mitch can get to Jessica, he can get to Bree.",
        "Bo: I, uh, I have an idea, if you'll hear me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Mom, did you get my charger?",
        "Gigi: It's -- it's in the bag. Are you okay?",
        "Shane: I'm fine. But what is this? Why do I have to go to Texas in the middle of the night?",
        "Rex: He's old enough.",
        "Shane: Old enough for what?",
        "Rex: I've got some bad news. Um, Mitch kidnapped your Aunt Jessica.",
        "Shane: What?! Is she okay?",
        "Gigi: We don't know.",
        "Rex: But we are gonna track her down and bring her home. It'll just be easier if we know that you're safe.",
        "Shane: Is Mitch after me, too?",
        "Rex: It is possible.",
        "Gigi: But he can't get you in Texas.",
        "Shane: Why not?",
        "Rex: Because they have got all sorts of security there, okay? I am talking cowboys with guns.",
        "Shane: But what about you guys? If it's not safe for me to stay here, you guys should come, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Chuck arranged for Shane and Nora and me to stay at the ranch. Now, Bree is welcome to come with us. It's no problem.",
        "Viki: That's a good idea, don't you think?",
        "Nora: Oh, Clint, I promise I will take good care of her. Nothing will happen to her.",
        "Clint: Well, this is one promise you better keep.",
        "Todd: Viki, you've got some pests.",
        "Viki: Aw. Hey, Shane. Hi, babe. Hi, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: I'm so sorry about Jessica.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Hey, I hear you're going to the ranch, huh?",
        "Shane: I guess so. I just don't understand why we all can't go.",
        "Rex: I would like to. I would. But I can't leave Stacy. And she can't fly because of the baby.",
        "Clint: Shane, I'd like you to do me a favor.",
        "Shane: Yes, sir.",
        "Clint: Bree's going to be going with you. I'd like you to keep an eye on her. Take good care of your cousin.",
        "Rex: It'll be good practice, huh? By the time you get back, you're gonna have a new baby brother or sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I am so glad you called. You would not believe the night I'm having.",
        "Stacy: Oh, girl, believe me, it can't be any worse than the day I've had. Have you talked to Schuyler? 'Cause he's not returning any of my phone calls. I mean, if he doesn't get me that oxytocin in time to have the baby next month, I --",
        "Kim: Relax. I'm on it.",

        "[Schuyler sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So what do you say, Shane?",
        "Shane: Yeah. I'll look out for Bree, not that it will make a difference.",
        "Gigi: What do you mean?",
        "Shane: You think it'll be any safer in Texas? Mitch Laurence killed Jared. And the cops just let him go. They basically gave him a free pass. And now he has Jessica. So we can run wherever we want, but we can't hide as long as Mitch Laurence is still out there."
