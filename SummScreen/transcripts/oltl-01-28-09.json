        "At Rodi's, Cole looks at a packet of little white pills as he remembers a conversation that he had had with John. John walks up and asks Cole as to what he is doing here. At the Angel Square diner, David is just about to sign away the Buchanan fortune when Rex comes in and interrupts. At a table in the Angel Square diner, Blair questions Todd as to why he is trusting Tea. Tea visits Star at La Boulaie and tells her that Todd had tried to kill himself on New Year's. In Rodi's, Cole attacks Wes and hits him in the face over Marty. Blair urges Todd to confess to what he had done to Star. Rex stops David from signing away the Buchanan fortune. Viki tells Natalie that she is taking Chloe to visit Jessica at St. Anne's. Natalie objects. Jared suggests that they move out of Llanfair.",
        "David questions Dorian as to why she hates Rex so bad. John tries to talk to Cole about his problems, but Cole refuses to listen and then pops another pill. Jared tells Natalie his feelings about them moving out of Llanfair into their own place, but finally gives in to Natalie's wishes for them to stay at Llanfair . Viki realizes that something is wrong when Jessica doesn't remember Chloe being born. Tea tells Star that Todd had forbade Tea to cross examine Star on the witness stand.",
        "Tea is determined to win the case for Todd. She goes and talks to Starr privately and milks sympathy from her by informing her that her father tried to take his own life. At that point, she establishes that Starr may not testify against her father. Todd also makes it clear that he does not want to let her damage Starr on the witness stand. Not knowing what to do and finding she cannot contact Cole or Langston, Starr rushes to the high school and seeks comfort from her new teacher, Mr. J. (Dr. Joplin's son). Rex goes to find out what is up with Dorian and David. He cannot find out any information from them about what they are up to. But he lets Natalie and Jared know that he can clearly see that Dorian wants to find a way to get all of David's wealth when he inherits it. Natalie admits to her mother and Dr. Levin that she does not want Jessica to come home and be able to care for her two children after being homicidal recently. Viki goes to arrange for her daughter to come back. But she admits to Dr. Levin that she realizes something is not right with her daughter and questions whether she has really integrated or not."

        "Natalie: Look, Dr. Levin, I am taking care of her daughters right now, and it is my responsibility to make sure they're safe. So until I think that Jessica is not a danger to those girls --",
        "Viki: Excuse me, Natalie, who are you talking to?",
        "Natalie: It's Dr. Levin. He thinks that we should bring Chloe to St. Ann's for Jessica. And you know it's too soon. Tell him, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John's voice: She's shutting everyone out, even Cole. Do you know where she is right now? She's with some guy, some stranger in a hotel room right down the hallway.",
        "John: Cole, what are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: The least you can do is join me in this gesture, even if it is only symbolic. Put your David Vickeroshi right there.",
        "David: This is heavy reading. Why don't you just tell me what it says?",
        "Dorian: Basically, it's just legal jargon. \"I, David Vickeroshi, aka David Vickers, do hereby bequeath all my worldly possessions,\" blah, blah, blah, \"to the Llanview Clouds-in-River Zen Center and the Sunshine-on-Meadow Mind Temple.\" There you go.",
        "David: All right.",
        "Rex: Vickers. Wow, so orange is the new black.",
        "David: Actually, it's saffron.",
        "Rex: That's right, you're a Buddhist now. What's up with that?",
        "Dorian: Actually, we are in the middle of doing something, so if you will excuse us.",
        "David: Namaste, Rex.",
        "Rex: Will I stay? I don't mind if I do. Well, look at you, Dorian, all peaceful and serene.",
        "David: Rex, would you like to watch as we mutually release from atman?",
        "Rex: Cool. What's that?",
        "David: Attachment to worldly goods and possessions.",
        "Rex: Fun. What are we signing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Don't tell me you trust T\u00e9a Delgado. Even you aren't that stupid, Todd.",
        "Todd: All right, I promise you, I shut T\u00e9a down. She's not going to even cross-examine Starr.",
        "Blair: She can say whatever she wants. Once she's in that courtroom, all those promises go right out the window.",
        "Todd: It'll be fine.",
        "Blair: Starr is going to tell the jury that you confessed to her that you were going to take her baby, and you think T\u00e9a's going to let that slide?",
        "Todd: She's not going to cross-examine Starr. I told you that. She gave me her word just now, and I trust her on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: It's true, your father tried to kill himself. I am so sorry.",
        "Starr: Where is he? Where is he?",
        "T\u00e9a: He's -- he's okay.",
        "Starr: He shouldn't be alone right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Shh!",
        "Starr: What are you doing?",
        "T\u00e9a: He's okay, he is okay. I need to talk to you. This happened on New Year's Eve. He is all right.",
        "Starr: Why didn't anybody tell me about that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr, he didn't want you to know.",
        "Starr: Why not? Why not?",
        "T\u00e9a: He didn't want you to feel responsible.",
        "Starr: You're saying that my father tried to kill himself because of me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr --",
        "Starr: Is that what you're trying to say?",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr, listen to me. You and I both know your father is a very complicated man and there is a lot -- there is a lot going on for him right now. A lot of bad things are happening to him. He's lost Marty Saybrooke, he can't see you kids, and he's facing a trial.",
        "Starr: Then why did he say he didn't want me to feel responsible?",
        "T\u00e9a: I think he felt incredibly guilty about your baby's death.",
        "Starr: He should feel guilty. He paid the nurse to take my baby out of that delivery room. If she would have taken hope to NICU, she might still be alive right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Who told you that, huh? Was it Nora Hanen? Lee Halpern is trying to stay out of prison. She will say anything the D.A.'s office tells her to say.",
        "Starr: My mom and I saw Lee Halpern. She didn't look like a criminal. She just looks like a regular nurse.",
        "T\u00e9a: People aren't always what they seem. Dr. Joplin seemed like a good doctor, but she made a hideous mistake, one that resulted in your child's death. She is the reason your baby's not alive, not your father.",
        "Starr: And now Dr. Joplin is dead.",
        "T\u00e9a: Honey, you've been through hell. I am so sorry. Starr --",
        "Starr: Dr. Joplin killed herself. My dad tried to kill himself because of me and my baby.",
        "T\u00e9a: I never should have told you any of this. This is exactly what your father didn't want.",
        "Starr: Do you know that if I would have never gotten pregnant, Dr. Joplin would still be alive and my dad wouldn't be on trial for murder?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I don't care what promises T\u00e9a made to you. She's going to rake Starr over the coals because T\u00e9a can't stand to lose. The cards are stacked against you, Todd.",
        "Todd: How's that?",
        "Blair: Lee Halpern, Janet Ketring, Marty's nurse? Yeah, remember her? Don't act like you're not worried. She was in the delivery room when Starr's baby was born, and she took her baby out of that room and she was supposed to hand her over to you. But if she had taken her to the NICU instead of going by your orders, her baby might still be alive.",
        "Todd: No, you can't know that.",
        "Blair: You think that's going to get you off the hook? Starr knows now what you did, and she's going to have to live with that for the rest of her life. Todd, you can protect her from a whole lot of pain if you would just confess. Don't make her relive all of that.",
        "Todd: You know that I want to be a good father to her. How am I supposed to do that from prison?",
        "Blair: You should have thought about that before. Starr and Lee Halpern are just going to seal the deal.",
        "Todd: Lee Halpern is just a -- an ex-con, just a washed up whore. She's a joke.",
        "Blair: Oh, really?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Blair: I think when she tells the jury everything that she did in the delivery room and why she was there, I think they're going to think she's a barrel of laughs, don't you? Especially when she goes into detail about what you were paying her for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Rex, we are signing a very personal business and spiritual document. If you will please excuse us.",
        "David: No, Dorian. Rex, please remain. We share openly. Anything else would interrupt flow.",
        "Rex: Alrighty, then.",
        "David: Rex, you're about to bear witness to a very big step in Dorian's process to release herself from material goods. She is about to sign over all of her worldly possessions to the Llanview Clouds-in-River Zen Center and the Sunshine-on-Meadow Mind Temple.",
        "Rex: Like buying stock in your spiritual future.",
        "David: Why, yes, you could say that.",
        "Rex: Wow, this is a big shift, Dorian.",
        "David: And I'm doing the same, although, mine is purely symbolic. I'm already penniless.",
        "Rex: Right, but say you were to get your pennies back, would you have to \u0096",
        "[Dorian coughs]",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry, there's no water on the table. Would you mind?",
        "David: Oh, allow me.",
        "Dorian: Thank \u0096",
        "[Dorian coughs]",
        "Dorian: What are you doing?",

        "John: Don't you got school or something?",
        "Cole: No, it's my free period.",
        "John: Ah.",
        "Cole: So you bought this place?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cole: You're a bartender now?",
        "John: Sometimes.",
        "Cole: I bet you have to talk to a lot of people about their problems.",
        "John: It kind of comes with the territory. You want a soda or something?",
        "Cole: No, I was wondering if we could talk.",
        "John: Absolutely.",
        "Cole: I just, you know, I've been having a real hard time.",
        "John: I know.",
        "Cole: I'm trying -- I'm trying to deal with everything, but it's a lot, you know? With me and Starr breaking up and then losing the baby and my mom shacking up with some biker dude --",
        "John: Yeah, I know. You meet him yet?",
        "Cole: No. His name is Wes, right?",
        "John: Yeah, look, there's something that -- something you should know. I \u0096",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: Hey, listen, this is my brother. He's going through some problems. Sit tight. I'll be back in one minute, all right? Yeah, Mike.",
        "Gigi: Hey, Wes, can you grab that last box, please?",
        "Cole: Hey, are you Wes?",
        "Wes: Yeah.",
        "Cole: You're the son of a bitch that's been using my mom, huh?",
        "Wes: Look, man, I get why you're upset, but I'm not using any --",
        "Cole: Shut up. She's sick, and you're playing house in your hotel room. What do you call that, you lowlife piece of --",
        "Wes: Look, I swear, we're just friends.",
        "Cole: She has friends all over this town! She just doesn't remember them.",
        "Wes: Your mother is where she wants to be.",
        "Cole: You -- you don't know what she wants! You don't know her.",
        "Wes: Listen to me, maybe that's why she's so comfortable with me. Okay, she doesn't have to worry about getting it right. We don't have a past she needs to remember. It's killing her that she doesn't remember.",
        "Cole: You don't talk about my mom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Okay, thank you, Dr. Levin. Yes, well, we will see you shortly. Bye.",
        "Natalie: Are you kidding me?",
        "Viki: No, darling, I'm not. Dr. Levin is a professional.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, Chloe's just a little baby.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, the doctor has a much better grasp of Jessica's situation than we do, and he feels that she's ready for this.",
        "Natalie: So, what? So we're just supposed to wave Chloe under Jessica's nose and see it one of her alters comes out to screw with everybody again?",
        "Viki: No, I don't think that's the idea, no.",
        "Natalie: I can't believe you would even go with this.",
        "Viki: Darling, if I thought that Chloe was going to be in any danger, I would never have agreed to it.",
        "Natalie: You're not thinking about her. All you care about is Jessica.",
        "Jared: Natalie was up all night with Chloe. She's exhausted.",
        "Viki: You've been wonderful with her.",
        "Natalie: I love her.",
        "Viki: I know that, darling. And you've been doing all this while you are still recovering from a severe emotional trauma.",
        "Natalie: Right, so I'm the whack job.",
        "Viki: No, darling, no.",
        "Natalie: Mom, Jessica tried to kill Jared and me and everyone thought that she was just fine, but really, she was completely crazy out of her mind. But you think this is different, how?",
        "Viki: Well, darling, I don't know yet, do I?",
        "Natalie: Well, don't you think you should find out before you take her down there?",
        "Viki: No. Jessica has a right to see her daughter, and this baby needs her mother.",
        "Natalie: Mom, please.",
        "Viki: I'm sorry, Natalie, okay? Look, she's going to be in very, very good hands. I will be there, Dr. Levin will be there. He feels that she's made a major, major breakthrough. In fact, he said she might be ready to come home.",
        "Natalie: You're kidding me.",
        "Viki: No, he just wants to see how she's going to react to Chloe, and so I'm going to make that happen. Come on, sweetheart, let's get you ready to meet mommy. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What am I doing? A man's gotta eat.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please.",
        "Rex: No, I'm serious, but then I saw you and David and, well, I'm very curious about this sudden spiritual awakening.",
        "[Dorian clears throat]",
        "Rex: I'm all ears.",
        "David: Dorian, may I explain?",
        "Dorian: Please, given my voice.",
        "David: This wasn't sudden, Rex. Dorian was born into this world on a quest. She's been trying to better herself her entire life.",
        "Rex: No kidding, a quest.",
        "David: Would you agree? She has tried searching for money, men, success, and happiness. None of them really worked out. Only now, she has found fulfillment.",
        "Rex: Right, because she's letting go of all that. So you're giving your millions to some Zen, clouds, and trees place.",
        "Dorian: Clouds-in-River.",
        "Rex: Yeah, that. There's one thing I don't get. These people took a vow of poverty, right, so what do they need money for?",
        "Dorian: Maintenance.",
        "Rex: I'm surprised you're not giving it to the homeless or to help cure some deadly diseases.",
        "David: What a compassionate thought, Rex. Namaste.",
        "Rex: I'm just saying I don't want to see you guys screw it up. Karma, that's all. I'd hate to see you come back as a couple of piranhas. Don't they eat their own?",
        "David: You're right. He's right. Thank you, Rex. Thank you a million times over for your enlightenment.",
        "Rex: Don't mention it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You have no idea the hell that Starr is going through.",
        "Todd: We talk.",
        "Blair: Oh, are you talking about that little heart-to-heart out at the cemetery? That only made things worse.",
        "Todd: Well, at least she knows that I'm willing to do anything to win her back.",
        "Blair: Except confess. Todd, she's just a teenager. She should be out having fun with her friends, but you know what she was doing this morning? She was rehearsing her testimony. She's a wreck.",
        "Todd: She's going to be fine. She's tough.",
        "Blair: She shouldn't have to be tough. Starr is anything but fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: If there is one thing I want you to know, is that you are not responsible for any of this, okay? It's perfectly natural for you to feel bad and responsible when something bad happens, but it is not your fault.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Now, let's just stop for a second and take a deep breath, okay?",
        "Starr: You know, I already tried that and it doesn't work so well.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm so sorry your father tried to kill himself, Starr.",
        "Starr: It just doesn't seem like him. It doesn't seem like something that my dad would ever do.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I -- I don't know the details.",
        "Starr: Yes, yes, you do. You know some of them.",
        "T\u00e9a: What does it matter now?",
        "Starr: It matters to me. And if you don't want me to feel responsible, then I suggest you tell me all of them right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, I don't want you to feel responsible, so I will tell you everything I know. That night, your father and Marty had some sort of an encounter. He ended up on the roof of the Palace hotel.",
        "Starr: Are you saying that he jumped?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Get off of me.",
        "Wes: Take it easy, man.",
        "Gigi: Guys, guys, come on.",
        "Wes: Look, let's just talk about this, all right?",
        "Cole: I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Wes: Fine, then I'll do the talking, okay? No one is taking advantage of your mother, all right? I'm not that kind of guy. She's a friend, okay? Are we cool? Are we cool?",
        "[Cole grunts]",
        "Gigi: I hate to break it to you, but you're going to have a hell of a shiner.",
        "Wes: Thank you.",
        "John: What the hell happened?",
        "Gigi: Wes and Cole were getting to know each other.",
        "Wes: Yeah, that kid knows how to throw a punch.",
        "Gigi: He was trying to calm him down.",
        "John: You okay?",
        "Wes: I guess. I bet you wish you landed that punch instead of the kid, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I have a really bad feeling about this.",
        "Jared: Honey, everything is going to be okay. Look, your mom is going to be there, and Dr. Levin is a trained psychiatrist who has dealt with Jessica plenty in the past, so --",
        "Natalie: Come on, Jared. Oh, my God, it's only been three months and she had us locked in a basement, had us in there with a bomb. And you know what? Now everybody thinks she's just fine because she says she is. She has one session and everyone thinks she's fine because she's Jess now, not Tess. But you know what? Jess is the real danger.",
        "Jared: How are you going to handle her when she gets home?",
        "Natalie: If she passes the so-called test? I don't know.",
        "Jared: Okay, well, maybe we should move and find our own place to live.",
        "Natalie: And leave those girls to fend for themselves? How could you even suggest that?",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I don't know what to do with myself.",
        "Dr. Levin: Try sitting down. Take a few deep breaths.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "[Jessica exhales]",
        "Jessica: My heart's pounding. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I haven't seen my baby in weeks.",
        "Viki: Well, that's about to change.",
        "Dr. Levin: Jessica, do Tess or Bess feel present right now?",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Viki: Honeybunch, say,\" Hi, Mommy.\"",
        "Jessica: Hi, sweetie. Hello. Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Your father's a lucky man. He landed in the river.",
        "Starr: What did Marty do to him?",
        "T\u00e9a: Only the two of them will ever know what happened in there.",
        "Starr: Why were they even together?",
        "T\u00e9a: He wanted a second chance. He wanted to make things right. He knows now that will never happen, which is why you are all the more precious to him, Estella.",
        "Starr: He can't take back what he has done.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, you are absolutely right, Starr. He can't take back what he has done. Your father is a passionate man. He's impulsive and irrational at times. And that's done a lot of damage in his lifetime. I think this time around he just -- he couldn't deal with it.",
        "Starr: Do you think that he will try to kill himself again?",

        "David: I feel such bliss.",
        "Rex: Glad I could help.",
        "David: My new mission in life is to seek out those less fortunate than I and symbolically offer my worldly goods to them.",
        "Rex: Sounds like a plan.",
        "David: Rex, you are traveling on a higher spiritual plane than most.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "David: If you're interested, I lead a very peaceful sunrise meditation where we chant the [unintelligible].",
        "David: It's followed by T\u00e9a.",
        "Rex: I'll check my calendar. Well, it was nice bumping into you two. That color is really flattering on you.",
        "Dorian: That meddling little bastard.",
        "David: Dorian, why are you so upset?",
        "Dorian: I -- that Zen center was really close to my heart.",
        "David: Your ego is pulling you back to your old self, the Dorian that hides the truth. I want you to tell me what I already know.",
        "Dorian: What do you mean tell you what you already know?",
        "David: The real reason Rex upset you -- he hurt Adriana.",
        "Dorian: Yes, that's right. He broke my Adriana's heart so badly that she had to go running away in order to mend her broken heart. And I will never forgive Rex for that. In fact, I hate his guts! I mean to say that I am channeling a lot of negative energy about him.",
        "David: We have much work to do.",
        "Dorian: So close, and yet so far.",

        "John: I was about to.",
        "Cole: You actually pay this guy money.",
        "John: Look, he was working here before I bought the place.",
        "Cole: Why didn't you just fire him?",

        "Cole: I don't feel it. I don't feel much.",
        "John: That's not good, Cole.",
        "Cole: Really? Why not? You run a business that's all about that, don't you? Don't people come here and drink until they're numb? Isn't that the point?",

        "Jared: Look, Natalie, I am not the enemy here, okay? I love Bree and Chloe as much as you do.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Jared: But they're not our children. They're Jessica's.",
        "Natalie: Could you do me a favor and not treat me like a patient at St. Ann's? I know they're not our children. I'm not trying to steal them.",
        "Jared: I'm not saying that.",
        "Natalie: I'm protecting them.",
        "Jared: For how long?",
        "Natalie: For as long as it takes. Jared, I would love to move out of here and get our own place. I mean, that'd be great. But if I left and something happened to Bree and Chloe, I would never forgive myself and neither would you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. She looks so different. I mean, she's holding her head up now and she seems so focused.",
        "Viki: Well, darling, they change a lot in the first year, you know.",
        "Jessica: I missed so much. You know, I was hoping that she'd look like Nash a little more. But the good news is, you look a little bit like your grandma.",
        "Viki: You think so?",
        "Jessica: Definitely, I do.",
        "Dr. Levin: How are you feeling, Jessica?",
        "Jessica: Um, calm. Happy. I feel like a whole person now.",
        "Dr. Levin: Any feeling that Tess or Bess are trying to get out?",
        "Jessica: No, just me and this beautiful baby girl.",
        "Dr. Levin: Do you understand whose baby she is?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, of course I do. She's mine.",
        "Dr. Levin: Any other thoughts or feelings about that?",
        "Jessica: Just that I've loved this little girl since the moment I saw her. When I came to the cottage and felt her tiny little heartbeat with mine.",
        "Dr. Levin: And when you gave birth to her, how did you feel?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I'm not sure of anything that happened last summer.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, would you excuse us just for a moment?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Dr. Levin, could I talk to you in the hallway?",
        "Dr. Levin: Uh --",
        "Viki: Is it all right?",
        "Dr. Levin: Yeah, sure, sure.",
        "Viki: There's something seriously wrong here.",
        "Jessica: Hello.",
        "Viki: Jessica just said she does not remember the baby's birth or anything about last summer.",
        "Dr. Levin: Oh, well, Tess and Bess were in control at that point.",
        "Viki: But how can she be integrated unless she has her alter's memories?",
        "Dr. Levin: Well, it doesn't always unfold that way.",
        "Viki: It did in my case. And my alter's memories were overwhelming to say the least.",
        "Dr. Levin: Well, there's a process called \"regression in support of the ego.\" Sometimes a patient will take a brief step away from recovery as a kind of protective instinct. I think Jessica's memories will return as soon as she settles in and feels safe.",
        "Viki: I hope you're right. I mean, I would obviously like to believe that the worst is behind her. I just find the fact that she doesn't even remember the baby's birth very discouraging.",
        "Dr. Levin: I understand. It's a difficult process for everyone involved.",
        "Viki: Well, what about the children? Are they going to be safe with her?",
        "Dr. Levin: When I hypnotized her, I asked to speak to Tess and Bess. There was no sign of either of them. All this is very, very positive. She's come a long way.",
        "Viki: And you really think she can come home?",
        "Dr. Levin: As long as she continues with strict outpatient care.",
        "Viki: Oh, of course, yeah. Well, that's wonderful.",
        "Dr. Levin: Good. I'll have them get the papers together.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",

He didn't tell me not to cross-examine you, he forbid me from cross-examining you. He would rather spend the rest of his life in prison than see you suffer for one more moment.",

        "Starr: No, he doesn't, because he does terrible things to people.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, he does. And then he does something so beautiful and loving, and it makes you think about what he could be. Maybe that's why I'm fighting so hard for him. I want him to have another chance.",
