        "Blair: You want to talk?",
        "Todd: Is that a trick question? I just figure, you know, because of what we did last night -- I know that's not part of the deal when we got married.",
        "Blair: So?",

        "Cole: I know. Good deal, huh?",
        "Starr: Yeah, it's a great deal. I finished mine, like, three days ago. So, I figured that you could come over here, we'll have some breakfast, and then maybe we could go ice skating?",
        "Cole: Well, that sounds great, but I haven't finished my report yet.",
        "Starr: Oh, really? What are you doing yours on?",
        "Cole: Uh -- it's kind of personal.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, you could still come over here and do your project and then once you're done --",

        "Cole: Hello?",
        "Langston: Are we still on?",
        "Cole: I am if you are.",
        "Langston: Definitely, just as long as Starr doesn't find out.",
        "Cole: Don't worry, Starr doesn't have a clue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex and Natalie: You look like hell.",
        "Natalie: Okay, well, I didn't sleep last night, but it really -- it's no big deal. What's wrong with you?",
        "Rex: Oh, no, I know you, Nattie. \"I didn't sleep well last night\"? Give me a break.",
        "Natalie: Okay, Jared had my sister committed. Top that.",
        "Rex: Aunt Corinne says Wally Balsom might not be my real father.",
        "Rex and Natalie: You win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: You live here?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: It's nice.",
        "John: I did all the decorating myself.",
        "Shane: At least you got a TV.",
        "John: Uh-huh.",
        "Shane: Where do you keep the video games?",
        "John: With the silver and fine china.",
        "Gigi: Don't you have your handheld thing with you?",
        "Shane: Yeah, but I finished the one game I have.",

        "John: Yes, yeah.",
        "Shane: Well, do I get my own room?",
        "John: Uh -- well, to be honest with you, Shane, there is only the one room and one bed.",
        "Shane: Well, where are we supposed to sleep?",
        "John: Well, I was thinking if it was okay with you guys, you and your mom would take the bed, and I'll bunk up out here.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no. No, no, no. We are not going to kick you out of your own bed. We'll be fine sleeping out here, won't we, Shane? It'll be an adventure for us, like camping out.",
        "Shane: I guess.",
        "Gigi: Besides, it won't be for long -- just till you take care of Ramsey.",
        "John: The deal is we take care of Marcie, too",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: All of the charges against Marcie were dropped in Texas -- that's got to be good for her case.",
        "Bo: But it's out of my hands, Mike. Marcie will be booked and arraigned on kidnapping charges. After that, it's up to the judge.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Nora: Antonio is bringing Marcie in.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Nora: Um -- Bo?",
        "Bo: Excuse me.",
        "Nora: Can we talk?",
        "Bo: I need to speak with Marcie.",
        "Nora: Marcie's not going anywhere, and I really think that we need to talk first.",

        "Michael: Marcie \u0096",
        "Pfc. Fish: I'm sorry, Sir.",
        "Antonio: It's all right, Fish.",
        "Michael: Thank God you're home. Oh, everything's going to be okay now.",
        "Marcie: No, I don't think so, Mike. I don't think things are ever going to be the same again for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay, why don't you try this book instead?",
        "Shane: I ain't afraid of that guy Ramsey.",
        "Gigi: What did I tell you about saying \"ain't\"?",
        "Shane: I'm not afraid of that guy Ramsey. My friend Charlie showed me how to protect myself.",
        "John: Oh, yeah? What, did he -- he teach you the sleeper hold?",
        "Shane: No.",
        "John: Well, you know, it's a -- it's a pretty secret move. You know, it's mostly just used by pro wrestlers and some cops.",
        "Shane: Really?",
        "John: Mm-hmm. Oh, there's a lot of ones I could teach you. There's the flying dragon, there's -- well, there's a lot, but I can only teach them to you if you show some discipline and that you're pretty well behaved.",
        "Shane: That's me -- just ask my mom.",
        "Gigi: Actually, I try and teach Shane to be a lover, not a fighter.",
        "John: Ah.",
        "Gigi: In fact, John is going to find Ramsey and show him the error of his ways in a nonviolent manner.",
        "John: Sure -- later on we'll go skipping through the village.",
        "Shane: Mom?",
        "Gigi: Huh?",
        "Shane: Could we go home after that?",
        "John: It may not be that simple, Shane. The Texas police only agreed to let your mom and you come here because your mom agreed to testify at Marcie's hearing.",
        "Shane: You came here to squeal on Marcie?",
        "Gigi: I did not! Morascos don't squeal.",

        "Michael: I'm sorry the Texas police wouldn't let me get on the same flight as you. Was it -- was it okay?",

        "Michael: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: Thank you.",
        "Ofc. Fish: I -- I don't understand, Sir. The regulations in a case like this are clear.",
        "Antonio: Well, you see, Fish, officers have a certain amount of discretion when it comes to enforcing those regulations.",
        "Ofc. Fish: But this woman kidnapped a child, and was a fugitive for three months. What if she tries to escape?",
        "Antonio: She won't -- not if you stand right here and keep a close eye on her. And, Fish?",
        "Ofc. Fish: Yes, Sir?",
        "Antonio: Try not to let her get the drop on you, okay?",
        "Ofc. Fish: No, Sir, I -- that was a joke, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Nora, this isn't the time or the place for us to get into some kind of a personal discussion.",
        "Nora: Well, there are only doughnuts here so I think it's probably safer than the Palace restaurant.",
        "Bo: Manning.",
        "Nora: Yes -- the blessings of free press.",
        "Bo: Remind me to shut this rag down.",
        "Nora: Well, you're not going to be able to do it before one of Matthew's friends shows him this.",
        "Bo: Oh -- well, we're going to have to talk to Matthew. You planning to keep up this nonsense with Clint?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, later, then?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'll see you there.",
        "Langston: All right. Bye.",

        "Cole: Hey, Starr, you still there?",
        "Starr: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm here. Who was it?",
        "Cole: Uh -- it was Markko. Um -- but, listen, I have to go because if we're late for practice, coach makes us do extra wind sprints which --",
        "Starr: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Cole, don't worry about it. Um, so maybe we can hang out --",
        "[Line disconnects]",
        "Starr: Hello? Cole -- I hate basketball, it ruins everything. We were supposed to -- hey, wait! Where are you going, who were you just on the phone with?",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: Who were you just on the phone with right now?",
        "Langston: Markko.",
        "Starr: Wait, wait, wait! No, you totally were not. Who were you really on the phone with?",

        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: Better go check on Sam.",
        "Todd: I don't hear him.",
        "Blair: He's going to be waking up and be very cranky and very hungry, and I hope today he will actually let us feed him.",
        "Todd: You see, now --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: You're going to be such a good mother.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Todd: You just have to stop thinking about Margaret, okay?",
        "Blair: But Sam --",
        "Todd: No \"Sam.\" I don't hear Sam. You have to give me one half-hour more. I'll give you the ride of your life, okay? This is our --",
        "Addie: Rise and shine, Todd!",
        "Blair: Oh, Mama?",
        "Todd: Oh, my God. It was just a freaking dream.",
        "Addie: Watch your language, there are small children in this house.",
        "Todd: Addie, did -- uh -- did you forget to take your medication this morning?",
        "Addie: New-and-improved. Orange juice?",
        "Todd: Why is your mother in my bedroom dressed like this?",
        "Blair: Uh -- well --",
        "Addie: I'll field this one, sweetie. I thought you might be hungry -- and I have aikido in an hour.",
        "Blair: Mama is on some new meds.",
        "Todd: I see that. Are -- uh -- are we sure they're effective?",
        "Addie: Todd, it is such a shame that I couldn't appreciate your dry sense of humor all these years.",
        "Todd: Well, this is all very new to me.",
        "Addie: Well, I'm here to stay so you have plenty of time. I've been meaning to come and find you before this to have a talk, but I've just been so busy.",
        "Todd: Doing what?",
        "Addie: Living life to its absolute fullest.",
        "Blair: Your hair looks fabulous.",
        "Addie: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Addie: But my activities are no excuse for not coming to you to have that heart-to-heart talk that we really need to he.",
        "Todd: Okay. We need to have a heart-to-heart talk because --",
        "Addie: You're my son-in-law, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yes, I know.",
        "Addie: That should be a very special relationship.",
        "Todd: Uh --",
        "Addie: So I'm just going to stay here for as long as it takes for us to forge a mature relationship.",
        "Todd: You mean you're going to stay here now?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I think that's what she means and you know what, sweetheart? I will let you guys take some time and -- however long it takes, okay?",
        "Todd: No, I don't think you're going to leave me here like this.",
        "Blair: Well, yeah.",
        "Todd: No, this is our honeymoon.",
        "Blair: Honey, let go. It's always going to be our honeymoon. Okay?",
        "[Blair gets out of bed]",
        "Todd: I --",
        "Addie: Well, I guess we just have to decide where to start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What did you just say?",
        "Bo: Are you going to keep dating Clint?",
        "Nora: That's not what you said.",
        "Bo: What -- yeah?",
        "Antonio: Commissioner, would you like to talk to Marcie before -- before I book her?",
        "Bo: Yes, I would. Thank you, Antonio, I'll be right out.",
        "Antonio: Sure.",
        "Bo: Think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Marcie, you'll be processed in a few minutes -- nothing you haven't seen a hundred times when you were working here.",
        "Michael: Thanks, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Sure.",
        "Bo: Marcie, we're going to do everything we can to make this as easy on you as possible.",
        "Marcie: I don't see why, Commissioner. It's not like I deserve special treatment.",
        "Nora: Well, the system isn't allowing for special treatment, Marcie. It's just that you're a first-time offender and we happen to know you very well.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, and I know that I'm going to spend the rest of my life in prison, so I think I should get used to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I was talking to Markko.",
        "Starr: You couldn't have been -- Cole was just on the other line with him.",
        "Langston: I know. Markko's parents just upgraded his phone and got him three- way calling and he was really excited about it, so he wanted to call Cole and try it out.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah -- guys are such suckers for that stuff.",
        "Langston: Yeah, tell me about it.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: Okay, I'll see you later.",
        "Starr: Wait, um, I'll get my coat, I'll come with you.",
        "Langston: No, no, no, you can't!",
        "Starr: Why not? Where are you going?",
        "Langston: Um -- I'm --",
        "Starr: Look, if you're going to see Markko, you can't hang out with him today -- he has basketball practice.",
        "Langston: Yeah, I -- I know. I -- I'm going to help plan Adriana's wedding.",
        "Starr: You're what?",
        "Langston: I -- I'm sorry. I -- I should've told you before but I thought you might have this reaction.",
        "Starr: Then why would you do it?",
        "Langston: Dorian found out we had the whole day off and she asked me to help pick out flowers and taste cakes and that whole routine, and you wouldn't want to be a part of that, right?",
        "Starr: Right.",
        "Langston: And I can't say no to Dorian.",
        "Starr: No, no, no, it's okay, I get it.",
        "Langston: Okay, thanks.",
        "Starr: But maybe after -- Langston, maybe you would want to hang out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ah, Corinne was about to board some codger cruise, so I took Adriana over to the palace to meet her.",
        "Natalie: So, what, at lunch, Aunt Corinne was just like, \"oh, by the way, Wally's not your dad?\"",
        "Rex: I said that I knew there was some kind of secret. We keep talking about the wedding, and anytime anything comes up about family, Roxy just starts acting totally bizarre.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I noticed at the hospital.",
        "Rex: So I started pumping Corinne and she drops the bomb.",
        "Natalie: You know, if I were you, I'd be breaking out the champagne.",
        "Rex: Let's see, what did you do when you found out you were not a Balsom? Oh, that's right -- you figured out a way to blackmail your new family.",
        "Natalie: I never said that I was perfect. But would you rather be the son of an alcoholic, brainwashed baby-snatcher?",
        "Rex: Uh -- are you talking about Wally or Roxy?",
        "Natalie: Look, Roxy has got her good points, but Wally was a Mitch Laurence zombie. He helped Mitch Laurence take me away from my real family, Rex!",
        "Rex: Hello! I thought we were talking about me here! You hit the daily double when Allison Perkins introduced you to the Buchanans. I doubt that Roxy hooked up with a prince or a millionaire.",
        "Natalie: Okay, this is not a joke.",
        "Rex: You're telling me? This kind of thing is not supposed to happen to me. I'm Rex Balsom, son of two total screw-ups. Whenever I screw up myself, I have to tell myself at least I'm doing a hell of a lot better than either one of those two did. Now I'm son of Roxanne Louise Lipschitz and \"fill in the blank.\" My whole self sense of worth is shot to hell.",
        "Natalie: So, what are you going to do, whine about it?",
        "Rex: I'm not going to whine. I'm going to find my daddy -- and you're going to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Sorry I'm late. Starr basically interrogated me on the way out.",
        "Cole: And she doesn't suspect anything, right?",
        "Langston: I came up with a brilliant cover.",
        "Cole: Because, you know, if she finds out that we're planning a surprise birthday party for her, it sort of isn't a surprise anymore.",
        "Langston: Don't worry. It's three weeks late, and she thinks we're incapable of doing anything but grieving. She doesn't suspect a thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Rex, you are about to get married to Adriana and you two have something incredible, something that I envy. And you should be focusing on your future, not mucking around in the past trying to find some mystery father.",
        "Rex: So you're not going to help me?",
        "Natalie: I didn't say that. I didn't say that. But you said that every time you bring up family, Roxy gets weird.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: So if Roxy's ashamed of this guy, maybe it's not such a good thing.",
        "Rex: Nattie, if Wally wasn't my father, I need to find out who was for all kinds of reasons.",
        "Natalie: What do you want me to do?",
        "Rex: Remember anything you can about when I was a baby.",
        "Natalie: I was, like, a toddler then.",
        "Rex: Whatever you can remember from back then might help, anything that -- that Roxy might've said or if anybody came around asking about me after I went to live with Aunt Corinne.",
        "Natalie: Okay. But you're not going to like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Marcie, you got to stop talking about going to prison. All right, you're back home, the people in this town love you. Or they know you and they know Todd, and they know what happened to us. I mean, the judge still might give you a suspended sentence or something -- right, Nora?",
        "Nora: I can't make promises to either of you, I'm sorry.",
        "Michael: Oh, come on. Marcie surrendered in Texas, nobody got hurt, she's been totally cooperative with the authorities, and you know that everybody in this town will be willing to testify on her behalf.",
        "Bo: A lot has happened in the past couple of months.",
        "Michael: Like what?",
        "Nora: Since Marcie left with Tommy, \"The Sun\" has been running this story on the front page every day.",
        "Michael: So what? That's Todd's paper.",
        "Nora: The entire school board was scapegoated and voted out of office because people were angry that the district had even hired Marcie to teach.",
        "Michael: Marcie's a wonderful teacher, those kids loved her.",
        "Bo: But this thing's taken on a life of its own, Mike.",
        "Nora: I -- I don't want to prosecute Marcie. But if I recuse myself, they're going to pull in some hotshot A.D.A. who's going to go for blood, so --",
        "Michael: So, I don't understand what you're saying.",
        "Nora: I guess what I'm saying is I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm really sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Marcie's my friend. There's no way I'm getting on the witness stand and -- and selling her out.",
        "John: Well, listen, no one's saying that you have to get --",
        "Gigi: She doesn't deserve what's happened to her, and I -- I just can't make things worse for her, I can't.",
        "Shane: What'll happen to Mom if she doesn't do what the judge wants?",
        "John: It's not going to go that far, Shane, I promise.",
        "Gigi: But you just said --",
        "John: You didn't let me finish.",
        "Gigi: Oh, sorry -- I do that a lot.",
        "John: It's okay. All right, listen -- you and Marcie -- I'm going to get you out of this mess, all right, and if everything goes as planned, neither one of you are going to do any time.",
        "Gigi: I'm still not completely clear how you can keep Marcie from going to prison.",
        "John: I can't, but Manning can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, we're going to start with you seeing me naked, because I'm about to get dressed.",
        "Addie: Okay.",
        "Todd: I'd appreciate it if you would avert your eyes. You know, Addie, uh -- considering everything that's happened, I think you and I can hold off on this discussion for a couple of years. I don't want you to be late for your class.",
        "Addie: I have time.",
        "Todd: Well, I'm in a bit of a rush.",

        "Todd: That's something you should discuss with Blair.",
        "Addie: Well, then perhaps we ought to talk about how you're going to integrate Sam into your family so that it goes as smooth as possible for all of you.",

        "Starr: Well, let's see -- I came into your room this morning and your bed was all made and I thought maybe you went out for the day, but here you are in your robe, and --",
        "Blair: Ha-ha-ha-ha. Hey, hey, hey! Watch your mouth.",
        "Starr: I just think I need to know for future reference. If there's a fire or a flood, where should I send the rescue team to find you -- in your room or Dad's?",

        "Langston: Are you trying to gyp us?",
        "Rex: Uh, well, you're all minors -- I had to factor in the money I'd be losing at the bar.",
        "Langston: This is ridiculous.",
        "Rex: Well, I hear St. Bartholomew's has a terrific basement. It's only 250 bucks, and that includes Sister Mary Margaret's rap version of \"Dominique.\"",

        "Natalie: Okay, I'm coming with you, then.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Natalie: Neither one of us may be Balsoms anymore, but I am still your big sister. Plus, you got me curious. Let's go.",

        "Gigi: Okay, uh, what are you going to say to him that'll help Marcie?",
        "John: Well, for starters, Manning kidnapped you and Shane, all right, and Marcie probably told you about a lot of other things that he did.",
        "Gigi: She said he tried to kill people?",
        "John: A long time ago. He also went to prison for rape.",
        "Gigi: So he's a total lunatic?",
        "John: Total lunatic.",
        "Gigi: How can you be so sure that he's not going to come after you?",

        "Starr: Okay. What am I supposed to think?",
        "Blair: About what?",
        "Starr: I go into your room, the bed is made and you're not there. Come on, Cole doesn't want anything to do with me today, Langston's out doing some errand -- whatever. The least you could do is tell me a little bit of what happened last night.",
        "Blair: Well, your father and I had a very long talk and we happened to clear the air about a lot of different things.",
        "Starr: And?",

        "Blair: \"Okay, whatever\"? Starr, what is your problem here?",
        "Starr: What? I guess I was sort of okay with the way things were. That whole arranged-marriage thing was working. Yeah, you and Dad were still in love with each other, but nobody had to talk about it. Everything was working out just fine and now you want to screw it up with the real thing? Yeah, way to go, Mom.",

        "Addie: And that was only two classes.",
        "Todd: All right, you've convinced me. What do you want to say?",
        "Addie: You have to understand that more than anything, I want Blair to have success and happiness in her life.",
        "Todd: Yes, that's what I want.",
        "Addie: At the moment, but not always.",
        "Todd: I'm confused. I thought you liked me. Are these -- are these new meds changing that?",
        "Addie: I love you, Todd, and I've always known my daughter loves you, too. You and Blair have given me two beautiful, precious grandchildren -- I think the world of you.",

        "Blair: Well, you know, you sound cynical when you say, \"I wish you were stuck in that fake marriage, Mom.\"",
        "Starr: It's just that you and Dad are always trying to fix things. Yeah, I want you two to be together, but at the same time, it's sort of exhausting.",
        "Blair: Oh, you're telling me that? Yeah, it is exhausting but what I've learned -- to be happy, you have to work for it, it's exhausting. But I'd rather do that and fight that battle to be happy than to be stuck in just being content. Hey, I want you to be happy. I want you -- you to find real happiness.",

        "Starr: Wait, but Dorian's at \"Craze.\"",

        "Langston: I don't see that happening.",
        "Cole: Starr's parents hate the guy, right, so this would be a great chance for him to try to get them to change their minds about him. I mean, I've been on the Todd Manning hate list -- it's not fun.",
        "Langston: I remember.",
        "Cole: Where's Markko? I thought he was supposed to meet us here.",

        "Todd: Blair is the most important thing in my life. You know, every time I told her, \"I don't love you, Blair,\" I was lying to her. I love her, I love Starr, I love Jack -- more than my own life. But, apparently, I can't expect you to believe that so I'm not going to try to make you believe it. I'm just going to make the marriage work and if you see it, fine -- if you don't, I don't care.",

        "Natalie: Yeah. So do you think that we're still his godparents?",
        "Rex: Blair and your Uncle Todd hate my guts. They're never going to let me anywhere near that kid. And Todd's determined to crucify Marcie.",

        "Marcie: You know, every night after Tommy would go to bed, Michael and I would sit and we would talk about what Tommy was going to be when he grew up, you know? And we didn't care what he was going to be, and we couldn't wait to see him decide for himself. But I guess that's never going to happen now.",

        "Cole: And why would she do that?",
