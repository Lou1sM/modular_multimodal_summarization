        "Mitch wants the nurse to administer Electro Convulsive Therapy so that Jessica can lose her memory and be obedient to him. But the nurse hesitates to do it. Mitch is determined to go through with it regardless of the consequences. Meanwhile, Lowell, the cops and the judge are ready to put John away for assaulting Mitch. There's nothing anybody can do. But Brody walks into the courtroom with a gun, points it at Lowell and tells him he will kill him if he does not tell him where Jessica has taken Mitch. Lowell does not answer. Brody fires a shot and it accidentally hits John and knocks him to the ground. Dani gets to know Starr, Cole and baby Hope. But she's not ready to come home nor face the fact that Todd is her father. At that point, Tea is ready to enroll her in school at Llanview High. And she is happy for that. Dorian convinces Charlie that Mitch has gone too far. And they have to take drastic action in order to save Jessica. And she tells him the only way to get to Mitch is through Stacy's baby. Right then, Stacy wants to get closer to Rex and puts her plan into motion to make it look like she's ready to give birth with the help of Kim and Schuyler."

        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Todd: Hi. Actually, I assumed that Starr would answer the door. I actually came to see her, and\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Good news?",
        "Eli: Uh, yeah. I'm sorry, though. Not about this case.",
        "Marty: Ah. Well, I just want to get John out of here.",
        "Eli: Well, if this arraignment goes as planned, you'll be able to do just that.",
        "Marty: What do you think our chances are?",
        "Eli: I'd have a better idea if we're up against Nora Buchanan, but with her out of town, the assistant D.A. is prosecuting.",
        "Marty: Well, you think he's in Lowell's pocket? What about the judge?",
        "Eli: Look. I haven't been in Llanview all that long, but from what I've experienced so far, anything is possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stan: McBain--hold on--you are going away for a very long time.",
        "John: Oh, yeah?",
        "Brody: Oh, excuse me. Oh.",
        "Stan: You clown! Where's my phone? Who is this guy?",
        "Brody: Oh, no. I broke it. Very sorry.",
        "Stan: Disconnected my call. Unbelievable.",
        "John: What are you gonna do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: At least we know Shane is safe in Texas. Our baby is being guarded 24/7.",
        "Rex: Feel safe with Fish?",
        "Stacy: I feel safe knowing that you want to protect me.",
        "Rex: So, how you doing? You feeling okay?",
        "Stacy: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Rex: Well, you're due pretty soon, right?",
        "Stacy: Right.",
        "Rex: So, you'll let me know if I should start boiling water?",
        "Stacy: Remember, my doctor did say that a lot of first babies are born late.",
        "Rex: Yeah, but some are early, right?",
        "Stacy: I don't think you have to worry about that.",
        "Rex: Well, whenever she gets here, I just want her to be healthy.",
        "[Stacy chuckles]",
        "Stacy: Yeah. I think she seems pretty healthy, don't you think? Ha ha ha!",
        "Rex: Yeah. She does.",
        "Stacy: You're falling in love with her.",
        "Rex: Yeah. I guess I am.",
        "Stacy: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mitch leaves me no choice. We have to resort to drastic measures.",
        "Charlie: And what do you mean by drastic measures?",
        "Dorian: Fight fire with fire.",
        "Charlie: What, do to Mitch what he's doing to us?",
        "Dorian: Mitch has used our families against us. We're gonna use his family against him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I'm sorry, my sleeping beauty, but you've given me no choice.",
        "Nurse Charles: Messenger, what are you going to do?",
        "Mitch: Persuade Jessica to care for Rex's child as her own.",
        "Nurse Charles: You said that would require drastic measures.",
        "Mitch: Unfortunately, yes.",
        "Nurse Charles: What sort of drastic measures?",
        "Mitch: Mm, this.",
        "Nurse Charles: But that's--",
        "Mitch: Exactly what Jessica needs to become a loving, devoted mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, what are you doing here?",
        "Todd: I was worried about you.",
        "Starr: You said that you were gonna give Dani space.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I know. I just-- Mitch Laurence is on the loose, and I thought I'd come by and--",
        "Starr: Have they found Jessica yet?",
        "Todd: No. That's the point. That's why I'm here. I want you to be careful, okay? I love you.",
        "Starr: Dad, I get that, but you can't force this stuff with Dani.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I know.",
        "Starr: Sooner or later, she's gonna see you like I do, okay?",
        "Todd: How's that?",
        "Starr: Well, you're not all that bad and that you're actually a really great guy.",
        "Todd: Since when did you figure it all out, anyway?",
        "Starr: When I turned 18, I just got this instant wisdom.",
        "Todd: Mmm, mmm.",
        "Starr: I love you.",
        "Todd: I love you, too. Now promise me--",
        "Starr: I promise that everything is gonna be okay and I'll take care of myself.",
        "Todd: Okay.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Todd: I'll let you know as soon as I find out anything about Jessica.",
        "Starr: You don't have to do that.",

        "Starr: I'm really sorry about the couch and--",
        "Dani: Are you kidding? It's great.",
        "Starr: Hey, I actually probably have more room out here because Cole and Hope and me are in one room and then Langston and Markko in the other.",
        "Dani: Markko and Langston went to school?",
        "Starr: Yeah. Markko is at college, and Llanview High is back from break, so--",
        "Dani: You don't have to go?",
        "Starr: I have a half-day today, and I can finally hear myself think.",
        "Dani: And I'm imposing on you.",
        "Starr: No, no, no. You're not imposing. We're sisters.",
        "Dani: So, what did he want?",
        "Starr: He was worried about us. He wanted to make sure that we were okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd is probably where he always is every day.",
        "T\u00e9a: Which is?",
        "Blair: Work.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, right. Oh...",
        "Blair: You all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I'm fine. I just-- I didn't sleep very well last night.",
        "Blair: Jet lag?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, among other things. Ohh...",
        "Blair: Thought maybe that was why you slept in last night. You know, Todd really did miss you when you were gone.",
        "T\u00e9a: What, are you trying to say that we spent all night having sex? Is that what you're--",
        "Blair: Whatever you and Todd do is really none of my business.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm worried about my daughter.",
        "Blair: Of course you are. That's not what I was--",
        "T\u00e9a: When, exactly, did you say you were leaving?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Hey, man.",
        "Guard: Hey.",
        "Judge: In the matter of the Commonwealth versus John McBain, the defendant is charged with assault.",
        "A.D.A.: Your Honor, Police Commissioner Lowell and two other officers apprehended the defendant in the act of assaulting Mitch Laurence.",
        "Judge: How does the defendant plead?",
        "Eli: Not guilty, Your Honor, and we request the charges be dropped immediately.",
        "Judge: I suppose you're going to give me a reason.",
        "Eli: Commissioner Lowell has a personal bias against my client, and the people have no evidence to support a charge of assault.",
        "A.D.A.: There's plenty of evidence, Your Honor.",
        "Eli: Oh, are you referring to those two witnesses with their hands in Commissioner Lowell's pocket or--",
        "A.D.A.: People resent that implication.",
        "Judge: Perhaps it would be best if defense simply sticks to the facts.",
        "Eli: All right. Fine. Here's one. Mr. Laurence hasn't bothered to grace us with his appearance here today. Doesn't my client have the right to face his accuser?",
        "A.D.A.: Uh, Your Honor, Mr. Laurence suffered grievous bodily harm, not to mention emotional distress because of the defendant's actions.",
        "Eli: Oh, please. Well, then why isn't he here to prove that? Where is Mitch Laurence?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Surely, you have assisted with electroconvulsive therapy before.",
        "Nurse Charles: I wasn't completely comfortable with it.",
        "Mitch: Oh, because of the stigma. Do you have any idea of its origin?",
        "Nurse Charles: When the treatment was first used, high doses of electricity were administered without anesthesia.",
        "Mitch: Hmm, which, in our case, will be the key.",
        "Nurse Charles: But administering the treatment without anesthesia causes memory loss.",
        "Mitch: Exactly what we hope to achieve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: So, you think that Mitch's family is his weakness.",
        "Dorian: It's everybody's, isn't it?",
        "Charlie: I guess I just don't believe that there's any way we can actually hurt that guy.",
        "Dorian: Mitch's feelings for his family are just about the only weakness he has.",
        "Charlie: Well, now wait a minute. Mitch's family is Jessica.",
        "Dorian: No. I'm talking about Rex.",
        "Charlie: Rex?",
        "Dorian: Rex! Rex's baby is Mitch's grandchild, and we're gonna use that baby to get at Mitch.",
        "Charlie: What makes you think he even cares about that baby?",
        "Dorian: He cares so much about the baby, he tried to kidnap Stacy. That's how much he wants it. He wants to raise it in his cult.",
        "Charlie: Come on. What for? He didn't even try to raise Jessica or Rex.",
        "Dorian: Oh, he thinks that baby is the heir to the throne, the messiah.",
        "Charlie: Oh, come on. You got to be kidding me.",
        "Dorian: Mitch is one crazy bastard, but he's just crazy to get his hands on that baby.",
        "Charlie: So?",
        "Dorian: So, what if we get to the baby first, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You know, all the women in the doctor's office, it seemed like they fell in love with their baby the minute they found out they were pregnant.",
        "Rex: Thanks, but, I mean, it's not like we planned this. You needed time to get used to the idea.",
        "Stacy: For the longest time, it felt like aliens had invaded my body.",
        "Rex: But not anymore?",
        "Stacy: Nope, not since I felt her first kick. I have a baby growing inside of me. It's just-- it's our daughter. I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for us.",
        "Rex: I haven't really done that much.",
        "Stacy: You let us stay here. You hired Fish.",
        "Rex: She's my baby, too.",
        "Stacy: I just didn't want you to think we don't appreciate it. You've been really great.",
        "Rex: But?",
        "Stacy: I just worry about what's gonna happen after.",
        "Rex: After what?",
        "Stacy: After I have the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: With her memories gone, Jessica will be a blank slate that I can fill in anyway I please.",
        "Nurse Charles: Electroconvulsive therapy is typically used to treat severe depression, mania, schizophrenia.",
        "Mitch: Yes. Mental illness, and Jessica has quite a history of that.",
        "Nurse Charles: I've never heard of an instance where it was successful with D.I.D.",
        "Mitch: Well, for us, it'll serve a higher purpose. We're going to help Jessica understand her true calling. Yes. My girl has a very powerful will. We're going to break it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I thought maybe you'd want to know that Todd really did miss you while you were away, and now that you're back and, I guess, obviously together, then--",
        "T\u00e9a: We're not exactly together.",
        "Blair: You're not?",
        "T\u00e9a: We're working things through.",
        "Blair: Probably not an easy thing to do with me and the boys underfoot, either.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's all right.",
        "Blair: Look. I know that this is not an ideal circumstance for any of us, but it seemed like it was the best solution, but now that you're back, I mean, if you want the boys and me to go, then--",
        "T\u00e9a: No. I don't want that. I know that you're just trying to give the boys a stable home.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and with this family, that is not an easy task, believe me.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's all right...",
        "Blair: Look. Thank you --",
        "T\u00e9a: For now.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. Right now, all I'm worried about is my daughter.",
        "Todd: I just saw Starr.",
        "Blair: What, you went over to Starr's apartment?",
        "T\u00e9a: How is Dani? Is she okay?",
        "Todd: She's fine.",
        "Blair: Well, I thought you said that Dani needed her space.",
        "Todd: Yeah. That's what Starr said.",
        "Blair: Um, I'm sorry that it's so hard, Todd.",
        "Todd: No, no, no. It's not like I've never given someone space before.",
        "Blair: No. I mean, I know how much it hurts you, you know, to think that your daughter hates you.",
        "Todd: Hmm, she did slam the door in my face, not that I blame her.",
        "Blair: Well, you got to remember Starr and how she reacted when she found out what you did to Marty.",
        "Todd: Starr is different. Starr was already stuck with me by then.",
        "Blair: Well, Dani doesn't know you like Starr does.",
        "Todd: She doesn't want to.",
        "Blair: Listen to me. You don't know Dani. You don't know how she's gonna react. You don't know.",
        "Todd: It's really not important.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, it is. It is important.",
        "Todd: She doesn't want me as her father, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you are her father. For better, for worse, you are her biological father, and I want you to be part of your daughter's life.",
        "Todd: Doesn't really matter what you want or what I want. She doesn't want anything to do with me.",
        "T\u00e9a: So, what, we let a 15-year-old call the shots?",
        "Todd: You have a better idea?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, let's see. She can't stay at Starr's forever. She's gonna have to go to school eventually.",
        "Todd: That's not gonna bring her home. Nobody wants to graduate that badly.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sooner or later, she has to go back to school, Todd.",
        "Blair: You know, maybe I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It's weird, isn't it?",
        "Dani: Saying we're sisters? Yeah. You missed your party last night.",
        "Starr: Oh, no big deal.",
        "Dani: I ruined your birthday.",
        "Starr: You didn't ruin anything.",
        "Dani: Yeah. Like you really want to spend it with your totally messed-up, long-lost little sister.",
        "Starr: Yeah. Actually, I did.",
        "Dani: Come on.",
        "Starr: Look. I don't want to get all mushy or anything.",
        "Dani: I get the feeling our family doesn't do mushy.",
        "Starr: We don't, but finding out that I have a sister was the best birthday present I could ask for.",
        "Cole: All right. I think I got all the bananas out of her hair.",
        "Starr: Ah, how did you do that?",
        "Cole: Well, I have my ways.",
        "Starr: Honey. Hee hee!",
        "Dani: She's beautiful.",
        "Starr: Hope, meet your Aunt Dani.",
        "Dani: I have a niece.",
        "Starr: Do you want to hold her?",
        "Dani: Oh, I don't know. I haven't really held that many babies.",
        "Starr: Oh, you'll be fine.",
        "Cole: There's nothing to it.",
        "Starr: Ha ha!",
        "Cole: Come here. Oh... there we go.",
        "Dani: Hi. Hi, Hope. It's nice to meet you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: I don't need to remind you, Mr. Clarke, that's Mr. McBain's accuser, Mitch Laurence, need not be present at his arraignment.",
        "Eli: Thank you, Your Honor. I do have a law degree.",
        "Judge: Furthermore, I have reviewed the evidence and find it more than sufficient. The charges against your client stand.",
        "Eli: Then we ask for bail to be set.",
        "Marty: Whatever it is, I'll post it.",
        "Judge: Bail is denied.",
        "Eli: Your Honor, please.",
        "Judge: Mr. Clarke, I won't tolerate these continual interruptions.",
        "Eli: Are you justice-intolerant, too, as well, Your Honor, because it seems to have no place here in your courtroom.",
        "Judge: You want to see justice? You're about three seconds away from being charged with contempt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What's going to happen?",
        "Stacy: It's just, you know, I've been living here a while now, and it's been great staying at your place and knowing I can call you if something happens.",
        "Rex: Nothing is going to happen.",
        "Stacy: No. I know you would make sure we were okay while I was pregnant, but when I have the baby, I just--",
        "Rex: You'll stay here as long as you want.",
        "Stacy: You mean the 3 of us?",
        "Rex: What'd you think, I was gonna kick you out?",
        "Stacy: I just didn't think you would want to be living with me.",
        "Rex: Stacy, you are the mother of my child. I'm not gonna let you live on the street. Thought you knew me better than that.",
        "Stacy: No. I do know you better than that, and, yeah, I knew you wouldn't kick me out.",
        "Rex: Good.",
        "Stacy: Guess I'm just worried about the future, you know, my baby's future...",
        "Rex: Our baby's future.",
        "Stacy: And we've been getting along so well lately.",
        "Rex: Less stress for the baby, right?",
        "Stacy: I just don't want anything to ruin that.",
        "Rex: But?",
        "Stacy: Do you think-- do you think there's a chance that maybe there could ever be, you know, something more between us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: What do you mean, get our hands on Stacy's baby?",
        "Dorian: So we can use the baby as leverage against Mitch.",
        "Charlie: Well--oh. What? You're saying that we should kidnap Stacy and then turn her over to Mitch?",
        "Dorian: Would you please just listen to me? Shh shh!",
        "Charlie: Okay. No. I won't do it. Dorian, you got the wrong guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: So, are we ready to begin?",
        "Nurse Charles: Messenger--",
        "Mitch: You have an objection?",
        "Nurse Charles: Of course not, but I would be remiss if I didn't inform you that electroconvulsive therapy can cause cognitive impairment and memory loss.",
        "Mitch: I understand that.",
        "Nurse Charles: Your daughter may become confused. She may not know where she is or why she's here.",
        "Mitch: And the more treatments she has, the longer the confusion may last, hopefully till the end of days.",
        "Nurse Charles: Messenger, I must admit, I'd never administered ECT before.",
        "Mitch: Well, we can still proceed.",
        "Nurse Charles: If the voltage is too high, we can kill her.",
        "Mitch: No need to worry. I know exactly what I'm doing.",
        "Nurse Charles: You're going to administer the treatment?",
        "Mitch: Of course. She's my daughter. Now ...prepare the patient.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know that you both would like to see Dani get a fresh start, and you need to think about it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Think about what? She's not ready to leave Starr's yet.",
        "Blair: Well, if you push her, she may even move further away.",
        "Todd: Yeah, so what are we supposed to do?",
        "Blair: Well, I actually get along with Dani pretty well. Maybe I could talk to her about enrolling in some school.",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Todd: Why?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because I still have to get the transcripts from the Warwick school.",
        "Todd: How long does that take?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, have you ever dealt with an English boarding school?",
        "Blair: Look, T\u00e9a. I'm not trying to, you know, take your place as a mother.",
        "T\u00e9a: I never said you were.",
        "Blair: No, and if anybody knows what it's like to have someone try to take their place as a mother, I think that would be me...",
        "T\u00e9a: I guess I had that one coming.",
        "Blair: But you know what? I'm grateful to you.",
        "T\u00e9a: You are?",
