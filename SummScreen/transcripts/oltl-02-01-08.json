        "Gigi: Your girlfriend -- oh -- I'm so sorry. How long ago did she die?",
        "John: 26 days, I think.",
        "Gigi: Oh. How did it happen?",
        "John: Ramsey.",
        "Gigi: Ramsey killed her?",
        "John: He was involved. So maybe you can understand why Rex Balsom is the least of our problems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Bo: Make yourself at home, Balsom.",
        "Rex: You ever feel like you've been broadsided by a big rig?",
        "Bo: A big rig? That's big.",
        "Rex: You have no idea.",
        "Bo: Why don't you tell me? That's why you're here, right?",
        "Rex: I don't even know why I'm here. I don't even remember how I got here.",
        "Bo: Sounds bad.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: My life, as I've known it, is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Hey --",
        "Roxy: You're just the guy I wanted to see.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Roxy: It's a matter of life and death.",
        "Charlie: Whoa. Is -- is there something --",
        "Roxy: I'm Roxy. Roxy Balsom.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I know. I met you at your beauty parlor.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but not officially, because it was kind of like a crazy day.",
        "Charlie: Look, I don't know what this is all about, but -- um --",
        "Roxy: My son needs a father, and you're it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Whew. Ah, Clint. Nora. Having a drink. Join me?",
        "Clint: Pack your stuff. You're out of here.",
        "Jared: Is there a problem?",
        "Clint: Yeah, a big one, and it's you.",
        "Jared: What?",
        "Nora: You're being evicted, Jared, effective immediately.",
        "Clint: For having my daughter committed to a mental institution, just to protect your own interests.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Give me a couple more spoonfuls and you're all done?",
        "Nash: How come you'll eat for your Auntie Nattie but you won't eat for Daddy, huh?",
        "Viki: Well, she's calmer now. Besides, she really likes Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Here.",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "Natalie: So maybe a little later, we'll have some vanilla pudding. Does that sound good, Breezy?",
        "Viki: Yes, yum, yum, yum, yum.",
        "Nash: You know, I didn't think she'd stop crying. She misses her mommy.",
        "Viki: Well, it was Jessica's choice not to sign the waiver, you know.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Viki: She could've been home today.",
        "Nash: It's almost like she wanted to stay at St. Ann's, isn't it?",
        "Viki: I know. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sister: Oh. Oh, heavens, not another triple jump?",
        "Allison: Victory is mine!",
        "Jessica: Can I have the next game?",
        "Allison: Why, Jessica, of course you can. Sorry, Sister, but you should've kept your pyramid intact.",
        "Sister: Well, woulda, coulda, shoulda.",
        "[Sister sighs]",
        "Sister: Good luck, dear.",
        "Jessica: I was hoping I'd run into you again.",
        "Allison: I bet you were.",
        "Jessica: Well, I can't help but be curious about what you said you know.",
        "Allison: You get red.",
        "Jessica: My family's overcome a lot of stuff over the years, and we do not keep secrets from one another.",
        "Allison: That's not what I hear. Your move.",
        "Jessica: What do you mean? What do you hear?",
        "Allison: That your formerly insane mother was leading a double life in Texas as a waitress.",
        "Jessica: So what? Look, spit it out. I'm not going to be here for very long, okay? And when I do leave, I'm not coming back and visiting.",
        "Allison: Did I ask you to visit? What are we all of a sudden? Best friends?",
        "Jessica: Will you just tell me the damn secret already?",
        "Allison: What's in it for me, Tess?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What is going on, Balsom?",
        "Rex: I shouldn't even be talking about it.",
        "Bo: But -- but you're here to talk about it, aren't you?",
        "Rex: No, but I can't. I mean, I shouldn't.",
        "Bo: Here -- sit down. You okay?",
        "Rex: I -- I got to do something. I can't just stand here and not do anything. I've --",
        "Adriana: Bo, you have to help me save Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: You're Rex Balsom's mother.",
        "Roxy: And you're his father.",
        "Charlie: Okay, look, I don't know what you're trying to claim, but I don't even know you.",
        "Roxy: Of course you don't. And of course you're not his father. But I need you to say that you are.",
        "Charlie: I'm not even going to ask why.",
        "Roxy: Couldn't tell you anyway.",
        "Charlie: But it's a matter of life or death? I think I'm going to stay out of this one.",
        "Roxy: Even if you knew you could prevent a train wreck?",
        "Charlie: Maybe you should find somebody else to play the part.",
        "Roxy: It's a little too late. You've been cast. I already told my kid you're the guy.",
        "Charlie: Rex thinks that I'm his father?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, and he's real jazzed about it, too.",
        "Charlie: Well, what about his real father?",
        "Roxy: No, we don't talk about that bastard, and Rex is never to know the truth. Nobody is to know the truth. Listen, I got to admit, I was a lame excuse for a mother, and I dumped him with my sister-in-law, who raised him and -- man, I just didn't have my act together, but I sucked it all up, I got it together and now, we're doing really groovy, Rex and me.",
        "Charlie: Well, you were until you lied just now.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, and he can't find out about that, okay? Because it's going to be over, and my whole life is going to be over.",
        "Charlie: Hey, Roxy, I would like to help.",
        "Roxy: Really? So you'll do it?",
        "Charlie: No, that's not what I'm saying.",
        "Roxy: No, no, no. Listen, listen -- I don't think you understand what it's like for a kid to hate you, okay? And that's exactly what's going to happen. And I don't want to lose my son forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I assume, then, you're also going to punish Jessica's husband in some way, since he did give his full cooperation.",
        "Clint: Pack your bags.",
        "Jared: Hell, he got off on it, actually, having his own wife committed.",
        "Nora: Okay, we're not -- we're just talking about you now, Jared, all right? As guardian of this house, and out of respect to Asa, I cannot allow you to stay here any longer after what you just did to Asa's granddaughter.",
        "Jared: I am Asa's son. Doesn't \"son\" trump \"granddaughter\"?",
        "Clint: From the day you arrived in Llanview, both of my daughters have suffered a great deal because of you, and that's going to come to an end right now.",
        "Nora: So, you have an hour to get your stuff together. No more free ride.",
        "Dorian: May I chime in here?",
        "Nora: Well, what -- what are you doing here?",
        "Dorian: Nigel let me in.",
        "Clint: Well, Nigel can let you out, because you're just not welcome here, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: I did not come here to see you, Clint, or your charming paramour. I came here to see Jared. I want to talk to him about his father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't know why anyone would want to stay in St. Ann's any longer than they had to.",
        "Miles: St. Ann's?",
        "Viki: Miles? Hello.",
        "Miles: Hi.",
        "Natalie: Hey. Yeah, my -- there was some very strange misunderstanding, and my sister ended up there.",
        "Viki: It's temporary.",
        "Miles: What happened?",
        "Viki: Basically, Jessica was pretending to be Tess.",
        "Nash: And it blew up in her face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: My name is Jessica.",
        "Allison: And your other name is Tess. First Viki, then Niki, then Jess, then Tess. Apple didn't fall far from the tree, now, did it?",
        "Jessica: You're right. I did have D.I.D. and then I was treated, and now that part of my life is over.",
        "Allison: Your mama thought the same thing, too, didn't she? But Niki popped in and out like a cuckoo clock -- oh -- no pun intended.",
        "Jessica: It's true. My mother's treatment did take longer than mine. Niki had a lot of secrets, and she was harder to put down -- not unlike you, Allison.",
        "Allison: Honey, there is only one of yours truly, and that is more than enough.",
        "Jessica: But you do have some secrets to tell, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Adriana --",
        "Adriana: Rex? Oh, I'm so glad you're here. So you told Bo?",
        "Bo: No, he hasn't told me anything yet.",
        "Adriana: Well, then I will. Todd almost killed him.",
        "Bo: What happened?",
        "Rex: Not much, except Todd wanted to make my face a panini on Dorian's stove.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, and he would have, too, if Charlie Balsom hadn't stopped him.",
        "Bo: \"Charlie Balsom\"?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Rex: Yeah, what's up? Yeah, I'll be right there. Electrical problems at U.V. I got to go. See you back home?",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bo: So, Charlie Balsom rescued Rex Balsom?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. He's a friend of Dorian's, and it's just a coincidence that they have the same last name. Look, Bo, you have to do something. You can't let Todd get away with this.",
        "Bo: I'm not sure that we have a choice.",
        "Adriana: What? Why?",
        "Bo: Because if you go after Manning, you might make him even more hell-bent on revenge. You know? Then he won't just threaten Rex physically, he might do everything he can to put him away for good.",
        "Adriana: So you know?",
        "Bo: That Rex knew that Tommy was Manning's son? That's why Manning attacked him, isn't it? See? Now, if -- if you do want to go after Manning --",
        "Adriana: I'm just -- I'm so afraid that Rex is going to get really hurt.",
        "Bo: No, well, I'll talk to Manning. I'll make sure that he knows it's in his own best interest to leave Rex alone.",
        "Adriana: Thank you, Bo.",
        "Bo: No, it's okay. I mean, you know, I'll do whatever I can to protect the kid. He's -- he's like a son to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You got any kids, Charlie?",
        "Charlie: I don't see what that has to do with anything here.",
        "Roxy: Because if you did, you'd know what it feels like when they turn against you. It's like a knife to your heart.",
        "Charlie: Look, my pretending to be Rex's father -- it won't even fly, not these days, not with D.N.A. testing.",
        "Roxy: Hey, there are ways to fix that.",
        "Charlie: No, and didn't I also hear that Rex is a -- some kind of private eye. Wouldn't he be able to figure it out?",
        "Roxy: Why would he do that? You're the daddy of his dreams. As a matter of fact, I'm kind of sorry that we didn't hook up.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but we didn't. Hmm?",
        "Roxy: Oh, you're thinking a great guy like you, what would you be doing with a skank like me?",
        "Charlie: No, Roxy, that's not what I meant.",
        "Roxy: I know. I'm just not your type. It's okay. I get it.",
        "Charlie: Well, no -- you're not my type, but that's no reason to be putting yourself down.",
        "Roxy: Hey, listen, when you've been told things a lot of times, you know, it's hard to believe. Look, I've been told so many times I'm just a nobody and a nothing that the world would be a lot better place if I just wasn't in it.",
        "Charlie: What, did some man make you feel that way?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, every man made me feel like that. Listen, you're a man. You know what kind of monsters you guys are. Especially to your kids. I mean, you're the worst with kids. And I got to do something to protect them. I got to take care of my son.",
        "Charlie: Roxy, I --",
        "Roxy: Listen, listen, listen. I'll give you anything that I got, okay? Listen, I don't have a lot, but I'll give you my store, okay? Because if I don't have my son, then I got nothing.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Yeah, I do understand. But, Roxy, I can't do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You're here to talk to me about --",
        "Dorian: Your father. You are Asa Buchanan's son, are you not?",
        "Jared: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Good. I own a magazine called \"Craze,\" and I would like to do a profile on you and your newfound parentage. Ha, ha. Buchanan stories always sell.",
        "Clint: Dorian, you couldn't have come at a worse time.",
        "Dorian: Oh? Have I interrupted?",
        "Jared: Yes, actually. Clint and Nora have asked me to move out of my father's house.",
        "Renee: Oh, pardon me. Don't I get to weigh in on this? Or have I been reduced to being the old widow in the attic?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Marty Saybrooke -- I heard about it on the news. It happened in Ireland, right?",
        "John: Yeah. She has a son, you know. Cole -- he was there, he saw it.",
        "Gigi: My God. That poor kid. Why did Ramsey do it?",
        "John: He's just another jerk with a gun. You know, he made it look like it was by the book, but it wasn't. He took Marty's life in his hands. She died because of it.",
        "Gigi: So, how long were you and Marty together?",
        "John: Not long enough.",
        "Gigi: I'm so sorry. I can't imagine how I'd feel if someone I loved was killed.",
        "Shane: What about Dad? Didn't you love him?",
        "Gigi: Honey, of course I loved your father. It's not polite to eavesdrop, mister.",
        "Shane: Is your dad still alive?",
        "Gigi: Shane.",
        "John: It's okay. No, Shane, my dad died a long time ago.",
        "Shane: When you were a little boy?",
        "John: Maybe not much older than you.",
        "Shane: I was too young to remember my dad. Do you remember yours?",
        "John: Yes, I do.",
        "Shane: You're lucky. Don't be mad, okay, Mom?",
        "Gigi: I'm not.",
        "Shane: She gets upset when I talk about my dad, because she still misses him. If I'm careful, can I keep playing darts?",
        "Gigi: Sure.",
        "Shane: Thanks.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. I'm sorry about all the questions, from both of us.",
        "John: No, I don't mind. You know, as long as we're all living under the same roof, we might as well get to know each other a little, right?",
        "Gigi: Right.",
        "John: Right. And you did tell Balsom not to tell anyone that you're staying with me?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I told him to keep it on the down low. But Rex doesn't even know Shane is here -- or that I have a son. And I'd like to keep it that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So are you saying you won't help me, or you can't help me?",
        "Charlie: No, I'm saying that it wouldn't be fair to lie to your son.",
        "Roxy: Are you kidding? You'd be doing him such a big favor. He took such a shine to you. Even after what I said.",
        "Charlie: What did you say?",
        "Roxy: Well, I said we totally got schnockered and we had this \"slam, bam, thank you, ma'am\" kind of affair, and then you split.",
        "Charlie: What, and he still wants me as his father?",
        "[Roxy chuckles]",
        "Roxy: Listen, you don't know his father. And believe me, you wouldn't want to.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Roxy: See, I know that you saved his life.",
        "Charlie: What, he told you that?",
        "Roxy: See, I already know that you've got this connection, anyway.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I guess, but --",
        "Roxy: Hey, listen, this kid's life is worth saving. I mean, you know, sure, once upon a time, he was a real punk. T look at this place? He's marrying Dorian's daughter. And he's got a nightclub and he's got his own P.I. business, and he's real chummy with the police commissioner. And he's a good kid. Any man would be proud to have him as a son. I know the way he feels about you. He thinks, like, you can walk on water. Wouldn't you just love to have a son like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: God forbid anyone should tell me anything. If I didn't eavesdrop, I wouldn't have the foggiest idea what's going on.",
        "Nora: Okay, Renee, it wasn't our intention to exclude you on this. And -- listen, my name may be on the deed of this house, but it is your home.",
        "Renee: That's very kind of you, Nora. Do you really mean it?",
        "Nora: Well, yes. Yes. Of course.",
        "Renee: Well, then, you will not have to throw this young man out of the house just because you don't like him. This is my husband's son! He will always have a place in this house, and in my heart!",
        "Clint: Renee, we're not throwing him out just because we don't like him.",
        "Nora: It's a little more complicated than that.",
        "Renee: How? Yeah, come on, come on, come on! Somebody, spit it out!",
        "Clint: Jared had Jessica committed to St. Ann's.",
        "Renee: What?",
        "Jared: Okay, hang on! Why am I the bad guy here? Her own husband agreed to it. Jessica was pretending to be Tess, hoping that she could trick me into admitting I wasn't Asa's son, after all.",
        "Renee: Well, why in God's name would she want to do that?",
        "Jared: Because she has issues with me. She feels I'm a threat to her, for some reason.",
        "Renee: So, it sounds to me like Jessica instigated the whole thing.",
        "Clint: Renee, you're not listening to me. He had her committed -- an unbelievably cruel thing to do to my Jessica, and that is why he's no longer welcome in this house.",
        "Jared: As if I've ever been welcomed in this house.",
        "Nora: Oh, please --",
        "Jared: Except by Renee.",
        "Renee: Jared is right. He's been treated shabbily from the beginning. And quite frankly, I've had enough of this. If he goes, so do I.",
        "Dorian: Oh, my. Evicting Asa's widow and his newfound son on the same day -- ah, the old cowboy in a continental suit's probably turning in his grave.",
        "Clint and Nora: Shut up, Dorian!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Um -- I don't really think we should be talking about this in front of Bree, okay? Mommy's going to be back very, very soon.",
        "Miles: Why -- why would Jared have your sister committed?",
        "Natalie: I don't know -- the whole thing is just ridiculous.",
        "Miles: Oh.",
        "Addie: What's ridiculous?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Come on, Allison, you can tell me. It's not like I'm going to go spreading it around.",
        "Allison: If you're thinking of using that man as a flank attack, you can forget it, girlfriend.",
        "Jessica: Okay, Allison, you can tell me. I'm not going to tell anyone. And when I leave here, I will come back and visit -- every week. And I will send you stuff, whatever you want.",
        "Allison: Yeah? Like what?",
        "Jessica: Like brownies and cookies --",
        "Allison: Books and CDs? Some cute pajamas? Noise-canceling headphones?",
        "Jessica: Yes, all of that. I will send you a package every day.",
        "Allison: Fine. Come closer. I'll whisper the secret in your ear so those nosy nuns won't hear. My secret is about your twin sister, Natalie.",
        "Jessica: The secret's about Natalie?",
        "Allison: Shh!",
        "Jessica: What is it?",
        "Allison: She hates your guts!",
        "Jessica: What? Uh -- is that it?",
        "[Allison chuckles]",
        "Jessica: Oh, God.",
        "Allison: No, dummy, that's not the secret! But remember that -- when she came to town and she became your friend and then she, like, made you fall in love with that dunderhead Seth, and just so she could pull the rug out from underneath you and, oh, your poor broken heart?",
        "Jessica: That was a long time ago, okay? Natalie and I are very close now, as close as two sisters could possibly be.",
        "Allison: Stop -- I'm going to cry!",
        "Jessica: I'm out of here.",
        "Allison: Come on, play another game.",
        "Jessica: I hate checkers.",
        "Allison: But you haven't heard the truth.",
        "Jessica: Like I believe a word that you say -- you're a loon.",
        "Allison: Or crazy like a fox, and if it's the latter, aren't you just dying to know what I know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Thanks again, Bo.",
        "Bo: Okay, but if Manning threatens Rex again in any way --",

        "Bo: That you're engaged?",
        "Adriana: He told you?",
        "Bo: No, no, he hasn't told me anything about it yet. I heard it through the grapevine, but congratulations.",
        "Adriana: Thank you.",
        "Bo: I understand that there was a little problem with the ring?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, it belonged to someone else.",
        "Bo: Hmm -- Marcie?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. Rex bought it from a woman in Paris, Texas, and he had no idea what he was getting into. His heart was in the right place.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, sure -- it usually is. Don't take this wrong, but did he get that from a pawnshop?",
        "Adriana: No. Uh -- he knew the woman who sold it to him. Actually, she was his ex-girlfriend.",

        "John: You know, the less Balsom knows, the better. Maybe just, you know, stay away from him till we get this settled.",
        "Gigi: Not a big Rex Balsom fan, huh?",
        "John: Oh, he's all right. This is more about lying low, if Ramsey gets wind that you're in Llanview.",
        "Gigi: I know, I know. He's dangerous -- Todd Manning, too. I was scared to death of both of them.",
        "John: Good. Listen, I'm going to go out for a while, all right? I'm going to go check on Marcie's case.",
        "Gigi: John?",
        "John: Hmm?",
        "Gigi: Um -- since Marty had Todd's picture on a dartboard, I assume she knew him, too?",
        "John: She knew him.",
        "Gigi: I don't get it. Viki's such a great person. How does she have such a horrible brother?",

        "Dorian: Well, really, you needn't be so rude.",
        "Nora: We're being rude? You barge into a house that doesn't belong to you and then start chiming in in a conversation that doesn't concern you?",
        "Clint: Nora, don't. It's not worth it.",
        "Dorian: I was only trying to help.",
        "Nora: Renee? The last thing I want to do, the last thing that Clint wants to do, is to cause you any kind of unhappiness, especially while you're still in mourning.",
        "Renee: Yes. Yes, I am in mourning.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Renee: I will mourn my husband to the end of my days. Bu there is one person who has helped me in my grief and it is this young man, with his -- oh -- gracious spirit, his sense of humor. So, you own this house, and if you're committed to asking him to leave, then I'm not bluffing. I will leave, too. We'll set up residence at the Palace.",
        "Clint: No. We can't allow that.",
        "Renee: So, Jared is staying and so am I, and I hope that we never have to have this extremely unpleasant conversation again.",
        "Dorian: Well, I think things worked out really nicely.",
        "Jared: Huh.",
        "Clint: Nora, let's go to dinner.",
        "Nora: In a minute. We may not be allowed to ask you to leave, but I do hope that you find your time here extremely uncomfortable knowing that you're not welcome.",
        "Dorian: Thank you -- I will sit down.",
        "Jared: Yeah. Huh.",
        "Dorian: Really, how can you stand living in the same house with that woman?",
        "Jared: Well, she's been okay -- till now.",
        "Dorian: Huh. Nora is a narcissist. Really -- she's so self-absorbed. She's totally incapable of empathy of any kind, and of course, poor Clint is always drawn to domineering women, I suppose to compensate for his own weakness.",
        "Jared: In other words, he's whipped. Ahem.",
        "Dorian: You betcha -- though I might have put it more delicately.",
        "Jared: So, what is it you want to know about me for this article?",
        "Dorian: You bought that line?",
        "Jared: \"Bought\"? I --",
        "Dorian: I'm not here to write an article about you -- that's not the reason I'm here at all.",
        "Jared: Well, then, what is this about?",
        "Dorian: I am a friend of a friend of yours.",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah -- who's that?",
        "Dorian: Does the name \"Charlie\" sound familiar?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Look, Rex seems like a fine young man, but I -- I can't do this, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Why not? It ain't like you never lied before. So what's the big deal with this one? Can't hurt anybody. And you'll be doing Rex a favor by giving him the dad that he never had, and you'd be getting a great kind in the deal. Listen, I just want you to think about it. And I meant it before when I said it was life and death. And if Rex ever found out the truth --",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "Roxy: You won't be sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You know Charlie?",
        "Dorian: Lovely man. He told me that you were very upset with him for missing your lunch date? And that you didn't believe his story that he was out of town on business, that he ran out of gas and there was no cell phone transmission. Well, I'm here to tell you that yes, he was out of town looking into a contracting job for me. We took my car, my chauffeur, ran out of gas. There was no cell phone tran-- blah, blah, blah. Anyway, I take full responsibility for what happened.",
        "Jared: So he sent you here to do his dirty work?",
        "Dorian: No. In fact, he has no idea that I'm even here.",
        "Jared: Then why are you here?",
        "Dorian: Because I want you to give him a second chance.",
        "Jared: It's not going to happen.",
        "Dorian: Oh, dear. Well, then I guess I'm going to have to spill the beans.",
        "Jared: Excuse me?",
        "Dorian: I'm afraid that I am going to have to tell everybody in this house who you really are.",

        "Addie: So we have Blair and Todd, Starr and Langston, Jack and Sam, and me. And then as if there weren't enough people in our house, my sister has invited a virtual stranger into our midst -- not that he isn't terribly handsome, mind you.",
        "Viki: Good. Well, who is this handsome stranger?",
        "Addie: A lovely man --",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Addie: Charming! And since I've been in bed with him, I can tell you with assurance that he sleeps in a T-shirt and with boxer shorts on.",
        "Natalie: You -- you were in bed with this guy?",
        "Viki: This is not something that needs pursuing, Natalie. How are things going with little Sam?",
        "Addie: Oh, Viki, it's heart-rending. He's obviously missing his adopted parents.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Addie: And I can see it in his eyes. It's -- oh, the poor, sweet darling.",
        "Viki: But I'm sure that he will adjust, don't you think?",
        "Addie: I hope so -- although I'm not sure my daughter ever will. She's having a terribly difficult time with this transition.",
        "Viki: I'm so sorry, but it is understandable.",
        "Addie: Viki, I've never thanked you for all you've done for my daughter. You were there for her when I couldn't be.",
        "Viki: You know, Addie, Blair is an extraordinary woman and I think you should be very proud of her.",
        "Addie: I am.",
        "Viki: And you should also know that even when you couldn't be there for her, she always knew who her mother was, and she always spoke of you so lovingly. She must be over-the-moon happy that you're back now.",
        "Addie: I have a lot of lost time to make up for.",
        "Viki: But I'm sure you will do that. You know, if you don't mind, I think I'm going to go and drop in and see Blair, and maybe I'll get to see my little nephew Sam if he's not asleep, hmm?",
        "Addie: Asleep, at this hour? He's a night owl, that one.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, that's great! I'll go now, then. Darling, you don't mind, do you?",
        "Natalie: No, no, no, we'll be fine. I'm going to try to keep Nash and Bree's mind off Jess.",

        "Natalie: Oh.",
        "Addie: Poor darling. But if it's any help to you, Nash, I lived at St. Ann's for years, and as much as I complain about squandered time, they're good people. Your wife is safe there.",

        "Jessica: You know why I'm losing it? I am losing it because I don't belong here, okay? And the only reason I stayed here is because I thought you had something important to tell me, but now I see you're playing mind games, so I'm going home!",
        "Allison: Oh, Jessica --",
