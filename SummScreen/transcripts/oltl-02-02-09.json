        "Langston admits to Starr that she is very disappointed in her for lying in court to protect Todd. Starr tells Langston she does not understand. Only \"Mr. J\" does. Yet she doesn't tell Langston just how she knows that Schuyler Joplin (Mr. J) is \"in the same boat\" as her the way nobody else is. Schuyler goes to his mother's grave and asks her what he is supposed to do and why she did not tell him that Todd blackmailed her by threatening to expose her son if she did not help him kidnap Starr's baby. After Janet has been murdered in Todd's living room and it looks like he did it, Tea comes and asks him what happened. They are both suspects for the dead body. But there is another suspect who is Wes. He admits to Marty that Janet was his father's mistress. She ruined his family and took all Wes's father's money. And Wes is very angry at her. It looks like Todd may have gotten away with intending to kidnap Starr's baby since she has refused to incriminate him in court. But the murder of Janet incriminates both him and Tea."

        "Bo: The best chance to find Lee Halpern is to find the place -- you know, the place where she would feel safe, okay? Did she mention anything like that when you were guarding her?",
        "Talia: I don't think she felt safe anywhere. She was already nervous about testifying at Todd's trial, and after she saw that newspaper article in \"The Sun,\" she flipped out.",
        "Bo: All right, but she didn't say anything about somebody that she knew that might hide her? Help her get out of town?",
        "Talia: Renee took her in once a long time ago, right?",
        "Bo: No, no. I talked to Renee. She wouldn't go anywhere near Lee Halpern now.",
        "Talia: She just clocked me and took off.",
        "Nora: Yeah, and took most of my case, or what's left of my case, with her.",
        "Bo: Well, we're going to find her. I don't care if I have to get a warrant for every Janet, Lee, and Carol in the tri-state area.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well with that article in the newspaper now, everyone's going to know who she is. She couldn't have gotten far.",

        "Markko: We go to the same school. I see who you hang with.",
        "Cole: You are just like Starr. You just can't wait to narc on me, can you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How did you betray Cole?",
        "Starr: I wanted everything to be okay for him. I was so mad that my dad wasn't going to jail for what he did to Cole's mom. That's why I stood up at that hearing.",
        "Langston: And told everyone he was going to steal your baby.",
        "Starr: Right. Right, to make him pay.",
        "Langston: You didn't do anything wrong, Starr. All you did was tell the truth.",
        "Starr: Langston, I saw him at the cemetery. He was at Hope's grave and he was talking to her. And he sounded so sorry. I know he was sorry.",
        "Langston: That doesn't change what he did.",
        "Starr: But then, Jack came to me and he was upset. And he was like, \"If Dad goes away, then I'll never see him again.\"",

        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: I know, every time I think about it, it freaks me out more and more. Just the thought of losing my father forever --",
        "Langston: I understand.",
        "Starr: But I was willing. I was willing to do that. I was willing to lose my father forever in order to make him pay. And then I didn't know what to do, so I talked to Schuyler.",
        "Langston: Schuyler? As in Mr. J? Our teacher? Since when are you on a first name basis with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I wish -- I wish you had told me about this before you decided -- before. Before. You know, you could've told me anything. That's what you always used to tell me. You used to say that I shouldn't be afraid to come to you and tell you anything. Gosh, I wasn't was I? I told you everything. I mean, especially about the drugs. That's why Todd Manning was able to blackmail you, because of me. And that's why you agreed to help him kidnap his own grandchild, because you didn't want me to lose my job. You didn't want my reputation ruined. I don't want your reputation ruined either, Mom. And if your part in Manning's plan comes out at his trial, that's exactly what's going to happen.",

        "Wes: I mean, Manning's own kid was going to testify against him.",
        "Marty: Yeah, too bad she didn't.",
        "Wes: What?",
        "Marty: Starr got up on the stand, and said she was going to -- she said she asked her dad if he was planning on stealing the kid. And then, she said that he told her no.",
        "Wes: What?",
        "Marty: Yeah. She said she lied about the fact that he was planning on stealing the baby.",
        "Wes: You're kidding.",
        "Marty: I wish I was.",

        "Todd: Yep. I didn't kill her.",
        "T\u00e9a: We have to call the police.",
        "Todd: Tell them what? She got stabbed by the other millionaire publisher she was planning to testify against?",
        "T\u00e9a: You're right. Even if I believe you didn't kill Lee Halpern, no one else in the world would.",
        "Todd: I didn't kill her. I wish I had.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't say that. Don't say that, okay? There is a woman lying on the floor in your living room, and she is dead. And there is a knife that probably came from your kitchen. I am your lawyer. I'm going to have to convince 12 people that you had nothing to do with it.",
        "Todd: Is that what you're going to do?",
        "T\u00e9a: Tell me everything that happened from the moment you walked in.",
        "Todd: The door was open.",
        "T\u00e9a: Was there anything else unusual?",
        "Todd: Just her.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you have no idea why she came here?",
        "Todd: No. Maybe she wanted money. Maybe she was going to kill me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, we have to account for your time from the moment court let out for recess. Where did you go after leaving the courtroom?",
        "Todd: I went to Blair's to ask Starr why she changed her testimony to protect me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, so Starr can be your alibi?",
        "Todd: No, I didn't see her. She wasn't home.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, someone must have seen you. Someone must have let you in.",
        "Todd: No, didn't go in. I didn't see a light in Starr's room. And I didn't want to go another 10 rounds with Blair.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, so no one has seen you in the last three hours?",
        "Todd: Just our guest here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, this is bad.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it is.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, it is. Because everyone knows you had the motive to kill Lee, and now you have the means and the opportunity, too.",
        "Todd: But I'm not the only one. I mean, look at all the people she hurt before. All the people she named in that article.",

        "Schuyler: If what I have done comes to light, questions will be asked. There was another witness in the delivery room. A woman who worked for Todd as a nurse. I imagine she knows even more than I did. Please don't blame yourself for any of this. I don't want this to consume you. You've turned your whole life around, and I'm so very proud of you. I love you with all my heart, Ma.",

        "Starr: I've been talking to Schuyler about -- Mr. J about everything that's been happening. Hope dying, him losing his mom. I don't know, I guess we kind of bonded.",

        "Starr: I just felt like there was no one else I could talk to.",
        "Langston: About being scared to testify?",
        "Starr: Well, I tried to call Cole, but he didn't pick up. And I don't think he would be much help, considering how messed up he's been lately.",
        "Langston: Why didn't you call me?",
        "Starr: I did, but it went straight to voicemail.",
        "Langston: Why didn't you leave a message?",
        "Starr: Well, I figured you were probably out with Markko, and I really didn't want to ruin your night.",
        "Langston: You don't think you testifying against your dad is a little more important than me going on a date with my boyfriend?",
        "Starr: It's my problem, okay?",
        "Langston: And I'm your best friend. If you've got a problem, I want to hear about it.",

        "Starr: I said that I lied before.",
        "Langston: What?",

        "Markko: After you stopped doing steroids, you were like, total straight-edge. But I guess that was before you thought your mom died, and Starr got pregnant, and everything else.",
        "Cole: Right. You mean before my mom came back and didn't know who I was? Before my baby died? Before Todd Manning got away with hurting everyone that I care about?",
        "Markko: Hey, he's not going to get away with it. He's going to get convicted.",

But it wouldn't have been about the great mom who helped me build a scale model of a human heart after spending all night up delivering twins. It would have been about the crooked doctor who was covering for her drug-addict son.",

        "Marty: What were you planning to do if you did?",
        "Wes: Didn't really have a plan. Just figured I'd know what to do if I ever got the chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Let go, Todd. We have to call the police.",
        "Todd: You and I are the only two people that know about this, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: And whoever killed her.",
        "Todd: But I have a feeling they're not going to want to talk.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, what do you want to do, Todd?",
        "Todd: Let's dump the body where no one will find it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, that's a great plan, Todd. We'll fit her with a pair of cement boots and drop her in the Llantano River.",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you serious? You're asking me to conceal a crime.",
        "Todd: You've done that before.",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't do that. We can't, we can't do this, Todd.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a. Don't go ethical on me now, okay? I need you. Will you help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Okay, I get why you feel bad for your dad, but you still lied under oath.",
        "Starr: Okay, it's not like I'm happy about it.",
        "Langston: It's called perjury, Starr. You could go to jail.",
        "Starr: Langston, do you really that Nora is going to throw me in jail because I didn't testify against my own father?",
        "Langston: You don't think she's going to be mad that you helped get him off? And if she can't punish your dad, maybe you're the next best thing.",
        "Starr: So you really think she's going to -- she's going to go after me?",
        "Langston: Maybe. I just can't believe you did something so stupid.",
        "Starr: Okay, you know what? This is why I didn't tell you, because you wouldn't understand.",
        "Langston: Oh, right, but Schuyler does, because he's your new best friend, right? And he understands everything.",
        "Starr: Actually, yes, he does. He does understand that I want to protect my father, and maybe if your father were alive, you would understand, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Now we have something else in common.",
        "Wes: Like, you mean, besides motorcycles and booze?",
        "Marty: Yeah, we've both been hurt by this Lee Halpern, or whoever she calls herself.",
        "Wes: At least she'll never hurt us again.",
        "Marty: Oh, what makes you think that?",
        "Wes: I just meant that she's probably so far from this town by now. I mean, she'll go underground again and start scoping out her next victim. That's what she does, right?",
        "Marty: Well, she didn't start out hurting me. She took care of me. She helped me get better.",
        "Wes: While she was helping Manning keep you in the dark.",
        "Marty: I went and saw her last night. She said she wanted to make up for what she did. She wanted to testify and put him away.",
        "Wes: Well, people don't always mean what they say, especially her.",
        "Marty: I believed her. Then again, I believed Todd.",
        "Wes: You know, it's not wrong to trust people.",
        "Marty: No, maybe not. Man, I seem to have a knack for trusting the wrong ones.",
        "Wes: I really wanted to see Manning put away. I wanted that for you.",
        "Marty: Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I sat there in the courtroom and watched the D.A.'s case fall apart. I couldn't believe it. He's going to get away with it just like he did before. There is -- there is no justice.",

        "Nora: Oh, God, there's no sign of her?",
        "Bo: I think someone is deliberately trying to point us in the wrong direction.",
        "Antonio: She hasn't turned up at Renee's or at the palace, and everybody else that she knows in Llanview is long gone.",
        "Bo: What about Manning?",
        "Nora: Why in the world would Lee Halpern go there when she -- he's the one man we're trying to protect her from?",
        "Bo: Money. A way out of town. If she doesn't want anyone to find her, Manning doesn't want her found --",
        "Antonio: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: All right, we need something to wrap her in, sheets or blankets or something, something to load her with so she doesn't float to the surface. Take my keys.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, wait.",
        "Todd: Drive the car around to the back entrance.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, just wait, wait, wait a second.",
        "Todd: I'll do everything. I know you've never done this, but if we don't wrap the body, someone may notice we're dumping a body.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, just give me a minute, okay? Just -- just give me a minute, okay?",
        "Todd: All right, we don't have a minute. We've got to get rid of her before someone tracks her here.",

        "Marty: Doesn't mean he'll go to jail either.",
        "Wes: Look, just because things don't work out the way you want them to doesn't mean there's no justice.",
        "Marty: Lee Halpern ruined your family. Where's her justice?",
        "Wes: Oh, it'll happen. I believe people always get what they deserve.",
        "Marty: What, do you mean like karma? Because you don't strike me as the kind of guy who's going to wait until the next lifetime.",
        "Wes: You know, there's more ways to make someone pay than putting them in jail.",
        "Marty: What do you mean?",
        "Wes: Don't listen to me. I'm not making any sense.",
        "Marty: No, I honestly think you're the only person that makes any sense.",

        "Markko: No, no, dude, I'm just saying what if this witness doesn't make it and Manning gets off? You know, what if you can't forgive Starr? What if -- what if your mom doesn't get better?",
        "Cole: You really suck at cheering people up.",

She didn't testify against her father. Couldn't do it. Couldn't -- couldn't let the world know what he had done. She loves him too much. And now, Mom, the only other witness is gone which means the only thing left that could condemn Todd Manning is the letter you wrote me.",
