        "Starr encourages Dani to believe that Matthew likes her and she is correct. He comes over and admits that he's been thinking about her and they seem to have mutual interest. Dani is not ok with knowing that Todd is her father however. And he's discouraged. Mitch has Jessica unconscious and believes she is ready to be the mother to Stacy's baby. Kim and Rex go with Stacy to the hospital. He still believes that Stacy is really going into labor with his baby. So does Gigi. But Schuyler, who knows what they are doing, tells them he refuses to go through with their plan. If it means Gigi finds out he got Stacy pregnant and she breaks up with him, he will accept that. Gigi admits to Rex that she is not ok with the fact that she had Shane all by herself without him and Stacy can have his baby with him there. She admits to Rex that she loves Schuyler. But he does not love Stacy. Meanwhile, Charlie and Dorian are trying to find Stacy and her baby in order to force Mitch to let Jessica go. But they cannot find her."

        "Todd: What do you mean, no sign of her? Here's a sign for you: You're fired.",
        "T\u00e9a: Was that your P.I.?",
        "Todd: Yeah, one of 50. And not one of them has a lead on Jessica.",
        "T\u00e9a: They will find her, okay?",
        "Todd: What happened with Dani?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, she, um, she's registered at Llanview High School. She starts classes tomorrow.",
        "Todd: So she wanted to go?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, she couldn't wait.",
        "Todd: So she's gonna be okay, then, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. She's--she's in good hands with her big sister.",
        "Todd: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So what are you gonna wear for your first day at Llanview High?",
        "Dani: Any of these. I'm just glad I don't have to wear a uniform anymore.",
        "Starr: I'm sure.",
        "Cole: Hey, guys, good shopping?",
        "Dani: Yeah, it was great.",
        "Starr: What are you looking for?",
        "Cole: Uh, the remote. I want to see what's going on with John's arraignment.",
        "Starr: Oh, you haven't heard anything?",
        "Cole: No. My mom hasn't called me yet. She's afraid that that scum Lowell is gonna hold things up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stan: I asked you a question. What's going on here?",
        "Marty: You're pretty sure of yourself...when John's not here to use as a human shield.",
        "Stan: I'm not discussing McBain and his trigger-happy fugitive buddy with you.",
        "Marty: Well, if he's on the run, aren't you afraid he's gonna finish off the job?",
        "Stan: Dr. Saybrooke, why are you still here? Why aren't you in the ambulance taking care of your boyfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Surprise.",
        "John: What the hell is she doing here? I told you not to get her involved.",
        "Brody: Yeah, you try and stop her.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, do you really think that I would listen? Besides, it went like clockwork. You're out.",
        "John: Yeah, well, pull over. We're letting you out.",
        "Brody: John, we don't have time. We need all the help we can get to find Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Yes. That's right, my darling, you sleep now...and rest. Doesn't it feel good to stop fighting, hmm? And when you've woken, you will forget everything about that false family. You'll be a brand-new person, reborn. And when the baby arrives, we'll create new memories. And you will love Rex's baby as your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I'm not doing this. I can't do this.",
        "Kim: Why not? Stacy needs to have this baby now.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. I'm not helping you induce labor just to fool Rex.",
        "Stacy: Wait. I thought you said this was safe.",
        "Schuyler: Maybe it is, Stacy! I don't know! I don't know, okay? What I do know is that it's not right, and I'm not gonna do this to my child.",
        "Kim: We have a deal, Schuy. You help us get this baby out of Stacy now. Rex doesn't find out it's yours. And Gigi will never find out you slept with Stacy. Everybody wins!",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, you know what? That's--that's not important to me anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Morasco, wait up!",
        "Gigi: Don't you have to get back to Stacy?",
        "Rex: We think it's gonna be a while.",
        "Gigi: Do we?",
        "Rex: Look, I saw how upset you were before when I came in here with Stacy, and I want to make things right for you...for us.",
        "Gigi: I think it's a little late to make things right between us. Things started going south as soon as Stacy hit town. Now she's having your baby.",
        "Rex: Must have been kind of awful running into her here today.",
        "Gigi: I've had the last 9 months to get used to the idea, right? It's not like I didn't know this day would come.",
        "Rex: I don't think any of us were exactly ready for it.",
        "Gigi: But now that it's here, all this pain that I thought I had set aside...it all came rushing back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I don't care what's important to you! This baby's important to me, and I need to have it now! So give me that shot now.",
        "Kim: Do it, Schuy, before Rex gets back. Come on! Rex is one closed door away from finding out this baby isn't his.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. What if something goes wrong?",
        "Stacy: We're in a hospital. Just inject me, and we'll get my doctor.",
        "Schuyler: Doctors don't fix everything.",
        "Kim: Yeah, well, they charge like they can.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, if something happens to this kid because we did this, because I did this, how am I supposed to live with myself knowing that I hurt my own child?",
        "Kim: So what? You're just deciding this now when Rex already thinks Stacy's in labor, and we have no time to make another plan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Together you and I will lead a life most blessed.",
        "Nurse Charles: Messenger.",
        "Mitch: I'm with my daughter.",
        "Nurse Charles: I'm sorry, sir, but I just received word that Stacy Morasco is in labor. Your grandchild's about to be born.",
        "Mitch: Bring the vessel carrying my grandchild back to me. We have everything we need to ensure a safe delivery. By the time the child arrives, Jessica will be ready to hold him. My daughter's arms the first he will feel, her heartbeat the first he will hear, her smile the first he will see. And my dear, darling Jessica will finally stop mourning the baby she lost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Newscaster: We're receiving reports that former Llanview chief of detectives John McBain, arraigned today for the alleged assault of cult leader Mitch Laurence, was shot and wounded in what can only be described as a courtroom melee. We'll keep you updated as we learn more.",
        "Starr: Oh, my God.",
        "Cole: My mom's at the courthouse.",
        "Starr: All right. I'll go-- I'll go with you.",
        "Cole: No. Stay here with Hope. I'll call you, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: With all the guards you had covering John, there wasn't enough room in the ambulance.",
        "Officer: Commissioner, we just got word. McBain escaped.",
        "Stan: What? How the hell did that happen?",
        "Officer: Seems he had backup waiting at the ambulance-- Brody Lovett.",
        "Stan: But how could he-- ahh. It was a setup. That son of a bitch!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Mitch killed my husband and he kidnapped Jessica. What do you expect me to do, sit around and do nothing? Besides, when Mitch goes down, I need to be in on it.",
        "John: Then quit driving like an old woman in Florida. Did Jessica try to call you again?",
        "Natalie: Jessica called you?",
        "Brody: I think so, but she hung up before I could answer.",
        "Natalie: Well, can you call her back?",
        "Brody: Restricted number. At least she was able to make the call. Maybe it means she's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Bring the harlot back here safely and make sure that my son is not harmed. Go! Maybe once this child is back here with me and Jessica... Rex will decide to join his true family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I didn't just decide this now. I tried to tell myself that it was okay. I even had myself pretty convinced, but now that I'm standing here with a needle in my hand...no. I can't.",
        "Kim: Then give it to me. Give me the needle. I'll do it.",
        "Schuyler: No.",
        "Stacy: Ah ah! I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Schuyler: Nobody is doing anything.",
        "Kim: What do you want, Schuy?",
        "Schuyler: Nothing.",
        "Kim: Well, you must want something 'cause clearly Gigi isn't enough, so what is it? Huh? Money, drugs? Want a few free lap dances?",
        "Schuyler: Don't you understand this isn't about that?",
        "Kim: Then what is it about?",
        "Schuyler: Telling Gigi the truth!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: It's bad enough that my sister's having your baby, but seeing you take such good care of her, getting her to the hospital and making sure she's all right, buying her lollipops, for God's sake.",
        "Rex: I'm--I'm sorry.",
        "Gigi: When Shane was born I took a taxi to the hospital.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you told me.",
        "Gigi: And when I was paying the driver, counting out the last of my tip money, I just kept thinking this is not how this is supposed to be.",
        "Rex: Gigi--",
        "Gigi: But that wasn't the worst thing about it. The worst thing was walking into the hospital all alone. I was in labor for 12 hours, Rex, and I spent every agonizing minute wishing to God I knew where you were.",
        "Rex: So you could kill me?",
        "Gigi: No, so I could call you and ask you to come and be with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I thought you shot him with blanks.",
        "Brody: Nah. A blank's not like a cap gun. It packs a hell of a kick at close range.",
        "John: I'm fine. Take this exit. We're gonna stick to the side roads. When you get off the ramp, make a left.",
        "Natalie: Got it.",
        "John: Ahh...what have you got for me?",
        "Brody: Fish? Eh, your boy set us up with everything we need.",
        "John: You guys did good.",
        "Brody: Something else?",
        "John: I'm just worried we left Marty holding the bag.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stan: Put out an APB on Lovett and McBain and find every available unit. I want McBain found now!",
        "Marty: Good luck on that.",
        "Stan: Hold it right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole's mom has been with John McBain for a while now.",
        "Dani: Hope he's okay.",
        "Starr: Yeah, me, too. You know, my mom was actually married to him for a little while. They got married for a custody thing, but they ended up really caring for each other. He's a really good family friend.",
        "Dani: I think our father might disagree. John McBain was the guy who rescued Cole's mom from him when he was keeping her captive.",
        "Starr: So you really did read all about that?",
        "Dani: Yeah. I don't want to get into this again.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, let's figure out what you're gonna wear tomorrow, then. You know, Matthew's a sophomore, too.",
        "Dani: Well, good. Then I'll have a friend in some of my classes.",
        "Starr: A friend? Yeah, okay.",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Starr: Well, it just seemed like you guys were a lot more than friends.",
        "Dani: You know, I really like this sweater. Think it'll look good changing the subject?",
        "Starr: What? Come on, you have to tell me. I'm your, uh, your big sister.",
        "Dani: I--I know. But I spent so many years as an only child. I'm not used to sharing things.",
        "Starr: Okay, fine. But I do think you should know that I've known Matthew since he was a kid, and he used to always follow me around. You guys are really tight.",
        "Dani: Well, we did kiss once.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Dani: But it was just once. It wasn't a big deal or anything.",
        "Starr: Really?",
        "Dani: But...he hasn't called in a while.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Dani: Not since I freaked out about Todd in front of him.",
        "Starr: I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation.",
        "Dani: Yeah, like he thinks that I'm this crazy, damaged, high-maintenance girl or something.",
        "Starr: No, he would not think something like that.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Starr: Oh. Sorry. Hold on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So Dani doesn't want anything to do with me, does she?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um...",
        "Todd: That's all right. I know. I knew I should not have burst over there this morning, but I just couldn't help myself. It's like one of those pod people.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha. Well, that's a step.",
        "Todd: What, having my body taken over by aliens?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. Becoming conscious, knowing you should back off.",
        "Todd: Yeah. What good is a conscience if you don't listen to it?",
        "T\u00e9a: You wanted to make things right with her. I understand that. I mean, look at how I charged out of here this morning. Nothing could stop me from wanting to make things right with my daughter.",
        "Todd: You can make things right with her, though.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry you have to go through all of this.",
        "Todd: What for? I'm the one who raped Marty. Ha. Did a billion other bad things.",
        "T\u00e9a: Which you regret.",
        "Todd: It's not good enough.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ahh. Well, what is, huh?",
        "Todd: Nothing. Now that Dani knows the truth about me, she's never gonna forgive me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You want to tell Gigi the truth? Have you lost your mind? If you do that, she'll run away from you so fast, you'll get whiplash.",
        "Schuyler: Maybe she won't.",
        "Kim: What do you think is gonna stop her?",
        "Schuyler: Maybe she'll understand. Maybe she'll even forgive me.",
        "Stacy: Ha! Yeah, right. Un-huh.",
        "Schuyler: You know, she did tell me she loves me. Maybe that's enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi, look, I swear that if I had known that you were pregnant...",
        "Gigi: I know.",
        "Rex: Things--",
        "Gigi: It's my fault for not telling you. But you never gave me a chance. You didn't even leave me any way to reach you.",
        "Rex: And I wish I had, okay? I will never stop regretting that I was not there for you.",
        "Gigi: That's what makes this all so hard. All this time you've been looking after Stacy and giving her a place to live, going to all those doctors appointments with her, making sure she's okay. It just reminded me of how alone and scared I was. Between contractions, I kept wondering how you'd ever find me in Texas. So I almost wished that I had stayed in Michigan after my parents tossed me out. Almost--",
        "Rex: Geeg--",
        "Gigi: Anyway, it was a long time ago, and we can't change it now. And it's not really anybody's fault even. It's just that today...I wish that I had had what you were giving Stacy, the best of you.",
        "Rex: Stacy does not have the best of me. And my heart might be with the baby, but my heart is not with Stacy. My heart still belongs to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Wow, Gigi must really love you. I mean, if you think she can forgive you for sleeping with Stacy.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, give it a rest. She's not winning a Nobel Peace Prize, okay?",
        "Stacy: I--I don't know, Schuy. You know how much my sister actually hates me.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, you know what? You know what? It was one time, and it doesn't count when you drugged me!",
        "Kim: Yeah, Stace, give Gigi a little credit. I mean, if she can forgive Rex for sleeping with you on the U.V. floor, I'm sure she can forgive Schuyler here.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay. I know what you're doing.",
        "Kim: And if Gigi can forgive Rex for knocking you up, then I'm sure she can forgive Schuyler for--oh, wait. She didn't forgive Rex. In fact, that's the reason she left him.",
        "Schuyler: Huh. Are you through?",
        "Kim: Come on, Schuyler! Okay, if you're gonna be honest with your girlfriend, try being honest with yourself. Gigi is never gonna be okay with this.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Yeah, well, that's a chance I'm gonna have to take.",
        "Kim: Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I know you are afraid, but soon you will see that there is nothing to fear. When my grandson arrives, you'll be up and about and ready to care for him, and the hole in your heart will finally mend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Uh!",
        "Schuyler: Let go. Let go. It's gone.",
        "Stacy: No.",
        "Kim: I can't believe you just did that.",
        "Stacy: What are we supposed to do now?",
        "Kim: Don't worry, there's more where that came from.",
        "Schuyler: Well, you're not getting it from me.",
        "Kim: You stupid bastard. You think Gigi loves you? She doesn't. She loves that nice, sweet guy who was always there for her when Rex wasn't, the guy who could never lie to her, the guy she thought she could always trust no matter what. Where is that guy, huh? 'Cause I don't see him, do you?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, which is exactly why I have to come clean.",
        "Kim: And you think that's all it's gonna take, huh? That Gigi's gonna forgive you, go back to the way things were after you've been lying to her every single day? Wake up, Schuyler! Nobody loves anyone that much.",
        "Schuyler: If Gigi doesn't forgive me, that's my own damn fault, and that's the price I have to pay. But guess what. This is not happening. It's over.",
        "Kim: If you really love Gigi, you couldn't do this to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, stop it. Please. Don't tell me that your heart still belongs to me.",
        "Rex: But it does.",
        "Gigi: My sister is having your baby right now, okay? Telling me that doesn't do any good for either of us.",
        "Rex: Don't say that!",
        "Gigi: But it's true. I spent all of those years hoping you'd come back to me, thinking... knowing that if you did, everything would be perfect.",
        "Rex: It was perfect for a little while.",
        "Gigi: And then it wasn't. And I still didn't want to let go. I--I kept holding on until you finally did what had to be done: You put us out of our misery.",
        "Rex: I never wanted this.",
        "Gigi: I know, but it's all right. We're all better off now.",
        "Rex: I should get back to Stacy.",
        "Gigi: I have to get going, too. It's supposed to snow up in the mountains, and...I want to get up there before it starts coming down.",
        "Rex: Uh, wait. You're--you're going to Viki's cabin where you and Schuyler first hooked up? Is he gonna be there with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna leave, and then I'm gonna go up to that cabin, and I'm gonna meet Gigi, and I'm gonna tell her everything.",
        "Kim: How do you think that's gonna make her feel, huh?",
        "Schuyler: Hurt. Hurt and upset.",
        "Kim: No. She's not gonna be hurt. She's not gonna be upset. She's gonna be destroyed.",
        "Schuyler: No. She's a stronger person than that.",
        "Stacy: Wait. If that were true, why would she need you?",
        "Kim: You're her knight in shining armor, Schuy. How do you think she's gonna feel when you turn out to just be another guy who lied to her to get her into bed?",
        "Schuyler: You know, when you put it that way, it almost sounds accurate.",
        "Kim: Don't do this, Schuy. Don't tell her you're the father. If you really love her the way you say you do, you won't hurt her like this. Rex already did that. You need to save her, save her from the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: We've also got a secret weapon. Fish gave me a bug with a two-way GPS tracking device.",
        "John: Department issue, I guess.",
        "Brody: No. I planted it on Lowell's phone.",
        "Stan: What is going on? Who is this man? Get him out of here.",
        "Brody: Very sorry. Very sorry, sir.",
        "Brody: As soon as he calls Laurence, we'll be able to pinpoint his location.",
        "John: If he calls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stan: What did you say? \"No room in the ambulance\"?",
        "Marty: Excuse me?",
        "Stan: That's what you said. Turns out John McBain wasn't in that ambulance. How do you explain that? You were in on this.",
        "Marty: How could I be?",
        "Stan: You examined McBain. Even if you didn't know what he was planning when Brody pulled the trigger, at least you knew when the paramedics got there.",
        "Marty: All I know is when this is over, you're gonna get everything that's coming to you.",
        "Stan: Likewise. In fact, why wait. Give me your cuffs. Marty Saybrooke, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting--",
        "Cole: Get your damn hands off my mother! You don't touch her, do you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Anything from Fish?",
        "John: Yeah. There's some more information on that letter Laurence wrote to Jessica.",
        "Brody: Something useful, I hope.",
        "Natalie: Guys, we got company.",
        "[Siren]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, what did we say about never, huh?",
        "Todd: I'm not going to kid myself.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, what, do you think I'm kidding myself? Huh? Trust me, Daniella will forgive you. She just needs some time.",
        "Todd: And what do I do until then? Take up crocheting?",

        "Mitch: A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come. But as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish. For joy, a human being has been born into the world. But for the fallen woman who's carrying my grandchild, there will be no joy, dear Lord, but only anguish.",

        "Rex: Okay, then. Okay.",
        "Gigi: Rex, everything is going to be fine. It will. Once Stacy has that baby and you hold it in your arms for the first time, you won't know what hit you.",
