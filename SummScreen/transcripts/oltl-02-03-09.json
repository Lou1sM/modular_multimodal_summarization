        "Many people are \"in limbo\" not knowing what will happen with Todd's trial or where their star witness, Lee Halpern is. Only Todd, Tea, Antonio and Talia know that Lee/Janet has been murdered. Marty and Wes talk about both of their association with this woman. Blair warns Starr that if they find Lee Halpern and she testifies against Todd with evidence, Starr could get charged with perjury. Schuyler Joplin is not certain what to do knowing his mother's involvement in Todd's attempt to steal Starr's baby, the fact that she complied with Todd in order to protect her son, or her untimely suicide. He goes into Rodi's and talks to John. Cole catches Matthew with a joint in his room. Matthew argues that he only smokes pot and odes not pop pills. Renee tells them both they need to shape up. Cole reveals to her that he has \"motives\" to get revenge upon Lee Halpern. It appears there are many suspects in the murder investigation of Lee/Janet. But Tea confesses to the murder. Antonio and Talia do not believe her but they take her down to the station. She still wants to represent Todd and win the case for him."

        "Antonio: Stay right here, both of you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I killed Lee Halpern.",
        "Antonio: Talia?",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "[T\u00e9a weeps dramatically]",
        "Antonio: Yeah, she's dead, but you're not the one who killed her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: I wish there was some way I could take your pain.",
        "Marty: So do I. Wes, don't.",
        "Wes: I'm sorry, that was way out of line.",
        "Marty: No, you don't have to apologize.",
        "Wes: Yeah, I do, all right? I shouldn't have done that, not after everything you've been through.",
        "Marty: I'm okay, I'm all right.",
        "Wes: It's just that Lee Halpern screwed us both over and I felt this, I don't know, connection to you.",
        "Marty: I don't know what I'm going to do if they don't find Lee and make her testify against Todd.",
        "Wes: They'll find her.",
        "Marty: He has to pay for what he did.",
        "Wes: He will.",
        "Marty: Wes, that's all I can think about. You've been such a good friend to me. I'm just not ready for anything else.",
        "Wes: There's more to it than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Can I just get a club soda, please?",
        "John: Didn't I see you at Manning's trial earlier?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I guess. Yeah.",
        "John: You a reporter or something?",
        "[Schuyler laughs]",
        "Schuyler: A teacher. I'm a teacher.",
        "John: You teach law?",
        "Schuyler: If you want to know why I was at the trial, my mother was Starr Manning's doctor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair's voice: Starr?",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Blair: I'm glad you're here, because when you left the courthouse I didn't know quite where you were headed. Are you all right?",
        "Starr: Is it true that Aunt Dorian gave this house to Moe and Noelle and that she decided to become a Buddhist?",
        "Blair: Yeah, apparently. But I think we have more important things to discuss right now.",
        "Starr: Well, you don't have to. Langston already yelled at me for not testifying that Dad was kidnapping my baby.",
        "Blair: Okay, look. I'm not going to yell at you. And I'm not mad at you in the slightest, all right, sweetie?",
        "Starr: Really?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Starr: Then that puts you in a definite minority.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Matthew, what the hell? What do you think you're doing?",
        "Matthew: Same thing you're doing, except with pot instead of pills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay. Well, I managed to stop David from signing over all his future wealth to Dorian.",
        "Jared: And the bad news?",
        "Rex: I know this woman. It's only a matter of time before she figures out another way to get her hands on all that Buchanan money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Did you see that, Dorian? A shooting star. What a glorious end to our trek up the mountain.",
        "Dorian: Yes, it's marvelous.",
        "David: I've decided that there's nothing more that I like more than a brisk hike in the winter air to cleanse the body and soul.",
        "Dorian: Yes, I feel absolutely robust.",
        "David: Come clean. You hated every minute of it.",
        "Dorian: I do not hate. I have liberated myself from hate. I have liberated myself from fear, because there is no death. There is only life, there is only love. I am at peace.",
        "David: Dorian, I am a seeker of enlightenment, not an idiot. I know you.",
        "Dorian: And I know you, David. I just would like to really know you, you know? Oh, come on David. You're the one who's insisted that we remain chaste.",
        "David: Dorian, you've strayed. Hop back on the path. Why is it you're so interested in the life that I lead? What do you get from it?",
        "Dorian: Isn't it obvious? Inner peace.",
        "David: The Dorian I know only likes two things -- money and drama. Inner peace gets you neither.",
        "Dorian: But can't you see David? I've changed.",
        "David: No. I do not see that you've changed. I see that you want something. But since I have nothing I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is that you want. Why are you trying to make me believe that you believe what I believe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Dorian's faking it. She doesn't know bodhisattva from bodhidharma.",
        "Gigi: I love it when you talk dirty.",
        "Jared: Okay, look. I know Dorian's faking it. The last I saw, Vickeroshi wasn't buying it either. So how did she do it? How did she convince him that she was this peace-loving, oath-taking, poverty-stricken Buddhist?",
        "Rex: First, she handed over La Boulaie to Moe Stubbs and his girlfriend, Noelle.",
        "Jared: Paris, Texas, Moe and Noelle?",
        "Rex: Yeah. Step number two, she concocts this Zen-sounding shell company and donated all of her money to it.",
        "Jared: Get out.",
        "Rex: Oh, yeah. She one-upped Mr. Zen master himself. You want to guess what step three was?",
        "Jared: Daring David to follow her lead.",
        "Rex: You got it. If he loves enlightenment as much as he says he does --",
        "Jared: He's going to sign over his future wealth to Dorian's bogus company.",
        "Rex: And there goes the Buchanan Empire -- signed, sealed, and delivered to Dorian Lord in three short steps.",
        "Jared: No, no, no. But you stopped it, right? He didn't sign.",
        "Rex: Oh, he tore up the papers. Dorian looked like she wanted to feed me into a wood chipper. She definitely knows David is Asa's son.",
        "Jared: But how? How does she know?",
        "Rex: I'm guessing there was a beaver involved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm sorry for your loss. I know Starr and her mom liked Dr. Joplin.",
        "Schuyler: Ah, thank you. Yeah, you know, besides raising me, my mom put everything she had into her work. She even kept pictures of all the babies that she delivered. It never became not special to her, bringing new life into the world. Can you imagine somebody like that killing themselves? Can you? And now, you know, the cops are asking all these questions like trying to prove that she was involved in Manning's baby-napping scheme.",
        "John: Yeah, I heard Lee Halpern's going to testify your mom was in on it.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, now it's looking like she might not be testifying at all, so \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I'm just not ready to be with anyone after Todd. I -- that's why I pulled away when you tried to kiss me. You and -- it's all on me. It's got nothing to do with you.",
        "Wes: I know. It's got nothing to do with me, and everything to do with John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm sorry you're taking the heat for letting your dad off the hook.",
        "Starr: I can handle it.",
        "Blair: Well, sweetie, you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. You don't need to carry everybody else's stuff.",
        "Starr: Oh, like everyone counting on me to put my dad away for life, that kind of stuff?",
        "Blair: Look, I know that you were nervous about testifying today. I know that. But you were also committed to doing it. And Starr, your father did tell you that he was planning on kidnapping hope.",
        "Starr: But he didn't do it. And now you are mad at me.",
        "Blair: No, sweetheart. I promise you, I'm not mad at you. But I am curious about why you changed your story. See, I'm thinking that either your dad or T\u00e9a leaned on you. Who was it and what did they do to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: CSU is on their way.",
        "Antonio: Fantastic. At least now we'll get some answers with basis in fact.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm telling you the truth. I swear to you. I killed that woman. Look at me -- don't you look at me? Look at me. Please, look at me.",
        "Antonio: This just keeps getting better by the minute. What, you rip your shirt, you grab the knife, you tell me you killed her. Then what, I'm supposed to believe you?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not lying. I am not lying.",
        "Antonio: When are you going to stop doing his dirty work?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why would I lie? Why would I confess, Antonio, to killing someone that I didn't kill? Why would I do that? I wouldn't --",
        "Antonio: Come on, go on. Get it out, T\u00e9a. Get it out.",
        "T\u00e9a: Antonio, you have to --",
        "Antonio: Because I don't believe you, okay? You didn't do it. And when forensics gets here, that's exactly what they're going to prove.",
        "Talia: You're not helping this guy out, lady. But you sure as hell are going to go down as an accessory if you don't start telling the truth.",
        "Todd: I didn't kill her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why are you holding the knife?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd had every reason to kill that woman.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd had everything to gain if Lee Halpern was suddenly unable to testify. I can see why you and Officer Sahid would think that he killed her. But he didn't. I did. It was in self defense. And frankly, Antonio, the one who should be answering questions is your partner. Wasn't she supposed to be guarding Ms. Halpern? Huh?",
        "Talia: Okay, after she read the article in Todd's paper about all her prior exploits she knocked me out and she took off.",
        "T\u00e9a: You are a cop with a gun. You have a problem keeping a middle aged nurse under a lock and key?",
        "Talia: Do you know what? You're the one who's going to have a problem.",
        "Antonio: Okay. Start from the beginning, T\u00e9a. How did you come to kill Lee Halpern in Todd's house with him standing right here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know somebody made you change your mind, Starr. Now who was it? Was it T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: Your father tried to commit suicide.",
        "Starr: Nobody got to me.",
        "Blair: Starr.",
        "Starr: Nora --",
        "Blair: Nora?",
        "Starr: Nora, yeah. She kept talking about how long dad was going away for and I did not want to see that happen. I felt bad for him. I mean, you did, too. Isn't that why you let Jack and Sam see him the other night?",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no. I let the boys see your father because they needed to see him. I didn't do it as a favor to your dad.",
        "Starr: Well, I couldn't put Jack and Sam's father in prison, even though I do think he should pay for what he did Cole's mom, to me. What he did to Hope. But I couldn't do it and I don't think you could have either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Well, if the cops don't pick up Halpern there's no one to implicate your mother in Manning's kidnapping attempt.",
        "Schuyler: Right.",
        "John: It also means Manning skates on everything he's been accused of.",
        "Schuyler: But -- wait, wait a second. I know you. I recognize you from the paper. You're the cop. You're the cop that rescued Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "John: Ex-cop.",
        "Schuyler: So you must really want this Halpern woman to pay for letting Manning get away with keeping his rape victim locked up in his house all that time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Do you think if I were ready for a relationship it would be with John? Not only do I not remember if I had a relationship with him, I can't stand the guy.",
        "Wes: There it is.",
        "Marty: There what is?",
        "Wes: All that feeling for the guy.",
        "Marty: Oh, you know, have you seen the way he acts towards me? I can't stand to be in the same room with him.",
        "Wes: Really? Then why is it that you will find any excuse just to see him, huh? Why do you go out of your way to get in his face?",
        "Marty: Out of my way.",
        "Wes: Yeah, I mean, look. God knows I hate the guy, okay? But there's obviously something between you two.",
        "Marty: Oh gosh, now you sound like Blair.",
        "Wes: Look, I'm not saying this to upset you, okay? I was wrong to try to kiss you. We are just friends and I get that. But maybe if you admit how you feel about John, he won't be so mad all the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I came to check on Todd. The door was open and I knew instinctively something was wrong. I was afraid for Todd, so I came in. I started calling, \"Todd, Todd.\" And that is when she jumped out at me. She had a knife, she was hysterical, and she was yelling at me that I had destroyed her life, that Todd and I had destroyed her life.",
        "Antonio: Destroyed it how?",
        "T\u00e9a: The article printed in the newspaper. She was worried that every person she had ever conned would come out of the woodwork and try to get her.",
        "Antonio: Oh, wow, she was terrified.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes -- she was furious, I mean, and terrified.",
        "Antonio: Which was it, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: She was terrified and furious, as was I. So I grabbed her arm to keep her from cutting me.",
        "Antonio: Still the street fighter, huh, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: I managed to get the knife away from her, but she wouldn't stop. She was all over me and in the struggle she got stabbed.",
        "Talia: Right in the heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What are you doing in my room?",
        "Matthew: Look, I'm sorry, but everyone keeps coming into my room ever since they found the joint in my bag.",
        "Cole: Dude, you told me you bought this pot to be cool. You said you never tried it.",
        "Matthew: I haven't. But this kid Justin, he's all over Becca and he keeps saying I don't have the guts to smoke.",
        "Cole: The guy is a loser.",
        "Matthew: Look, I just want to see what the big deal is.",
        "Cole: It's not going to happen, okay?",
        "Matthew: Give it back to me or I'm going to tell everyone that you pop pills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I want nothing but happiness, the happiness that you have found.",
        "David: Not happiness, joy. There's a difference.",
        "Dorian: Joy, joy. I want to find joy. I want to be one with joy. I want to be one with the change that I seek, but it is absolutely impossible in the face of this unrelenting doubt.",
        "David: Peace achieved without adversity is no peace at all.",
        "Dorian: Then help me, David. Help me. Show me the way. Show me the path.",
        "David: You want something, Dorian, and it is not the joy of poverty. Now either you tell me exactly what it is or we march right back up that mountain and we do not stop until you can't walk anymore.",
        "Dorian: No. No, you're right. You're absolutely right. My motives are not pure.",
        "Dorian: I think I'm going to regret saying these words as soon as they pass my lips.",
        "David: No, never regret speaking the truth.",
        "Dorian: The reason I've been trying so hard to prove myself to you is I still love you. And I will do anything to make you love me back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Where are David and Dorian now?",
        "Rex: I left them at the Buenos Dias cafe, but that was a while ago.",
        "Rex: Isn't Clint in the U.K.?",
        "Jared: He's not back until late tonight.",
        "Rex: Well, then Bo's your guy.",
        "Jared: He's hard to find, too. He's busy with police stuff lately. And for some reason he's been spending a lot of extra time with Matthew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I mean it. You give it back to me or I'm going to tell my mom and dad that you're popping pills. You know what? I'll tell John, too.",
        "Cole: Do what you have to do, but you're not getting this back.",
        "Matthew: You'd rather get caught than let me smoke?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Renee's voice: Cole? May I come in?",
        "Cole: Yeah, yeah. Come in, Renee.",
        "Renee: Oh, there you are. Just the young man I've been looking for.",
        "Matthew: Uh, me? Why?",
        "Renee: Because you lied to me. And I want to know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know the pull that your father has on you, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: He has a pull on all of us.",
        "Blair: And I'm not asking you not to love him. I would never, ever do that. But Starr, listen to me. I'm really worried. I'm worried that you may have gotten yourself in some serious legal trouble here because you perjured yourself on the stand. And listen, if they find Lee Halpern, they could -- she could completely contradict your story.",
        "Starr: Well, I'm kind of hoping that she's gone for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Where was he during this whole thing?",
        "Todd: I was not here. I went to see Starr to thank her for not testifying against me.",
        "Antonio: Right. That was a doozy, wasn't it? One minute Starr's testifying that you were trying to kidnap her daughter, and the next, she decides she's lying.",
        "Talia: Yeah, it's almost as if somebody got to her. I'm going to check the kitchen.",
        "Antonio: Oh and then, of course, the only other person that could testify against you is here, dead on your living room floor. And then, so if you can get Starr to give you an alibi, you're good to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You haven't heard from your father tonight?",
        "Starr: No. I don't want to talk to him or anyone else.",
        "Blair: Well, does that include me?",
        "Starr: No. I'm just tired, that's all.",
        "Blair: Okay. Well, you -- you rest. And I'm going to head out for a little while, so if you need me you call me for anything, all right?",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Starr: Oh, what did I do? Oh, God, what did I do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're going to leave Starr out of this.",
        "Antonio: Oh, I guess that means you don't have an alibi.",
        "Todd: She wasn't home.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't say another word.",
        "Antonio: Come on, after that Oscar-winning performance in there? What are you doing, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm protecting my client.",
        "Antonio: Oh, because I thought this time you were grieving for the woman in there that you just killed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Tonio, check the knife. It has my prints on it.",
        "Antonio: Ah, yes. But then it was in your hand when we walked in.",
        "Talia: So the murder weapon matches a set of knives in the kitchen.",
        "Todd: It wasn't murder, it was self-defense.",
        "T\u00e9a: Lee must have grabbed the knife from the kitchen waiting for Todd, but she got me instead.",
        "Antonio: Are you seriously going to stick with that story?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I wish I could just ignore John, but I can't.",
        "Wes: I think you're confused, maybe a little scared about whatever is between you guys.",
        "Marty: All I know is that he says he understands me and he goes and does the exact opposite of what I really need.",
        "Wes: Like dragging Todd out of a river after you talked him into offing himself.",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Wes: Look, just because people don't do what you want doesn't mean that they don't get you.",
        "Marty: What does that mean?",
        "Wes: I'm guessing John saved Todd for your sake. You're no killer, Marty.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: Yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm telling you the truth. I did this. See this? I did this.",
        "Antonio: Fine, suit yourself. You're under arrest for the murder of Lee Halpern.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: They might not have to get married.",
        "Natalie: What do you mean?",
        "Jared: Well if she can somehow get herself appointed as David's guardian, then MMM",
        "Natalie: No, tell me he wouldn't let that happen would he?",
        "Rex: Trust me, Dorian used to be my mother in law. She's got more lawyers than teeth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You still love me?",
        "Dorian: Look at me, David. I've hobbled my feet. I'm wearing this highly unflattering outfit. I've given away all my worldly possessions, all to prove myself worthy of you.",
        "David: Dorian, you don't have to prove yourself worthy of anyone.",
        "Dorian: But I want to, David. I -- I want to show you that I will do anything to be with you. I will give up the world as I know it. Why do you think I was so out of control when you married my sister? Why I did everything I could to break the two of you up?",
        "David: I know. You threatened to cut off my sacred lingam.",
        "Dorian: I could not bear the thought that you had chosen her instead of me. And why do you think I'm so jealous of Viki? Your friendship with her just makes me nuts. We were so close to being married, and then you let Spencer blackmail you into leaving me at the altar.",
        "David: I've always regretted hurting you that way.",
        "Dorian: Why aren't you saying that you're sorry we're not married?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "Schuyler: Ms. Cramer, hi.",
        "Blair: Hi.",
        "John: You know each other?",
        "Blair: Yeah, he's Dr. Joplin's son, and Starr's science teacher.",
        "John: Oh, you didn't mention that.",
        "Schuyler: You didn't ask. How is Starr?",
        "Blair: Well, she had a tough time in court today, but I'm sure it wasn't very easy for you, either.",
        "Schuyler: I'll be okay. Thank you.",
        "Blair: So -- I'm good. So any word from any of your friends at the police department about Lee Halpern?",
        "John: No, I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: You know, I just don't want her to show up and contradict Starr. I'm just worried what's going to happen to my little girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Starr: I don't want to talk to anyone.",
        "Jack's voice: But I brought you something.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Jack: Don't be mad, but I overheard you and Langston fighting before.",
        "Starr: You were eavesdropping?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, but I had to find out what happened in court today. Nobody would tell me. So you didn't rat out Dad, and now everybody's mad at you.",
        "Starr: You really shouldn't be eavesdropping.",
        "Jack: I know, and I'm sorry. But now I'm glad I know the truth.",
        "Starr: Is that it?",
        "Jack: No. I thought you could use an old friend. Sam had him, but he doesn't really need him anymore. I know it's lame, but I didn't know what else to do. Thank you for not putting Dad in jail. And thank you for letting me and Sam keep our dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: At this point, I doubt Nora wants to bring Starr up on perjury charges.",
        "Blair: I just feel so bad for Starr. It's just hard on her, you know. And I know one of them got to her. I don't know if it was T\u00e9a or Todd, but one of them got to her. John, she's been torn apart by all this, and I know she still is tied to her father, whether she wants to be or not. Who am I kidding -- he still has the same effect on me.",
        "Wes: There's no chance Marty's going to let you in. Not unless you give her the room she needs to live her life the way she wants to -- no matter how much you're hung up on her.",
        "John: Yeah, I get that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: So you're a killer, huh? Who have you killed?",
        "Marty: I convinced Todd to jump off that building, and I was relieved when he did it.",
        "Wes: The guy's still breathing.",
        "Marty: Yeah, thanks to John. I suppose he thinks he saved me from having to live with a death on my conscience.",
        "Wes: He did you a favor, trust me. Marty, I've killed people, okay? And even if it was for my country, it's changed me. You start to think that human life isn't worth so much after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: The scene is right through here. This appears to be the murder weapon.",
        "Todd: Antonio, don't arrest T\u00e9a for this.",
        "[Antonio scoffs]",
        "Antonio: Turn around. Put your hands behind your back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: He remembers me as this gentle, law-abiding girlfriend that he once knew, but that woman's gone. I wish Todd and Janet the absolute worst for what they did to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Tonio, Tonio, put away the cuffs, okay? You think you're going to call my bluff and get Todd to confess? He didn't do it.",
        "Antonio: I'm taking you in for questioning.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine. But my story is not going to change, because it's the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: If John really understood me, maybe he'd accept the fact that I'm not the forgiving type anymore. Maybe I never was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: Look here, kiddo. I let you go out the other night, while you conveniently forgot to tell me that you were grounded.",
        "Matthew: I'm sorry.",
        "Renee: Well, you better be, because I'm not catching hell from your parents again. So get on back to your own room, and get ready for bed before your mom comes home.",
        "Matthew: All right.",
        "[Renee sighs]",
        "Renee: Okay, what's going on between you and Matthew, huh? And don't say \"nothing,\" because I could see you were bent out of shape when I came in.",
        "Cole: Well, of course I'm bent out of shape. Starr told a different story on the stand today.",
        "Renee: Yes, I heard, and I'm so sorry. And now my old friend, Lee Halpern, is missing.",
        "Cole: Wait, that lady is your friend?",
        "Renee: Old friend from a former life. You know, I tried to convince her to do the right thing, Cole. But obviously, sometimes people don't have the guts to do the right thing.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, Lee Halpern will get what's coming to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Hey, Rob.",
        "Antonio: Get next to your buddy, there.",
        "Talia: We're going to take your picture, and we're also going to need to have those clothes that you're wearing for analysis. You want to make sure to hand those over.",
        "Man: Say \"cheese.\"",
        "Antonio: You know, I can hold you for 24 hours without charging you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Can we just get this over as soon as possible? Todd and I need to be in court tomorrow so I can make sure that he spends the rest of his life with his family, and not in prison.",
        "Antonio: Of course, without the prosecution's star witness, getting this family man acquitted will be a hell of a lot easier than before, now, won't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wes: Sorry about me trying to kiss you before. Like I said, I was way out of line.",
        "Marty: You've been a very good friend to me. Good enough to call me on this thing I have with John.",
        "Wes: So you're admitting you have a thing now?",
        "Marty: I don't -- \"I\" don't have a thing. Maybe the woman that I was before had a thing. The thing is, even if I could remember some of my past, if I could access some of those feelings, it would be a huge mistake.",
        "Wes: How do you know that?",
        "Marty: Because the last time I let myself trust someone, it was Todd. I am in no shape -- no shape to let something like that happen again. Even with John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Once you set the alarm, you've got about 30 seconds before the thing starts going off.",
        "Gigi: I know how to close. Now, get out of here.",
        "John: All right, you sure?",
        "Gigi: Yep.",
        "John: Thanks, Gigi. Hey. Are you going home to Starr?",
        "Blair: She said she wanted to be alone.",
        "John: There's a lot riding on tonight. The cops finding Halpern, whether or not Manning walks.",
        "Blair: I just don't want Starr to be the only person that has to pay for all this mess, you know? After everything she's been through.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Dorian knowing that David is Asa's son gives a whole new meaning to \"worst case scenario,\" don't you think?",
        "Rex: Tell me what you need -- as long as it's more or less legal.",
        "Jared: Okay, well, I've got to run this by Bo and Clint first, but I'm thinking we do the unthinkable and tell David he's a Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You know, when Mel died in that airplane crash, I gave up hope of ever finding love again. And then I found you, and fell head over heels.",
        "David: I did, too.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: I was so happy.",
        "David: I was happy, too.",
        "Dorian: Oh, David, we can find our way back to being happy again. To joy -- pure joy.",
        "Dorian: David Vickeroshi, will you marry me?",
        "David: Marry you? I'm supposed to be celibate.",
        "Dorian: Only monks are celibate. It is within the parameters of spiritual enlightenment for a seeker to take a mate, is it not?",
        "David: Yes, but Dorian, we must all choose our own path.",
        "Dorian: But David, I honor your path. I respect it. I do not want you to change, not at all. I will be the one to change.",
        "David: Well, in order for you to take my path, you must relinquish all desire, not act on it.",
        "Dorian: But -- what if my path toward enlightenment is through you? David, let us join our lives together, and we can walk toward nirvana, if only you'll marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: If we're going to do this, and tell David the truth, we better do it before he falls for one of Dorian's traps.",
        "Rex: You're thinking this is the way to go?",
        "Jared: I'm thinking it may be our only option.",
        "Rex: Well, then, you need to get David alone. Without Cruella. Because if she's somehow able to convince him that they're soul mates or something, the Buchanans are toast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I am honored by your proposal, and if I allowed myself to desire, it would be you that I desired. And you're right -- one is allowed to take a mate and to love a mate and still be a seeker.",
        "Dorian: Is that a yes?",
        "David: I need to meditate on it until the morning. You'll have my answer at sunup.",
        "Dorian: I have my answer already. I'm going to be Mrs. David Buchanan.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: What do you mean, \"Lee will get what's coming to her\"?",
        "Cole: I just have to believe that, right?",
        "Renee: Look, darling, I can't imagine what you must be feeling after what Starr did on the stand today.",
        "Cole: We were getting to be friends again, and just like that, we're back to enemies. I don't know what happened.",
        "Renee: I'm sure that nothing that I can say will convince you that it will get better. But it will. It may take a while, but darling, justice has a way of being done, and sometimes in ways that you least expect.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
