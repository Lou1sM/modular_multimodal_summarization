        "Kim: Yeah, that's why I came looking for you. It was a false alarm.",
        "Rex: You're kidding?",
        "Kim: Nope. Doctor said that she isn't having the baby yet, so he sent us home. Maybe that's where Stacy went.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I was safe upstairs.",
        "Dorian: Not true. The second Mitch Laurence found out where you were, you were in danger.",
        "Stacy: How do you know that?",
        "Dorian: Because I am Mayor Dorian Lord, and I have a task force tracking Mitch's every move. I have a car waiting right there. Shall we?",
        "Stacy: Uh, no. No, thank you.",
        "Dorian: Do you have any idea what you're dealing with?",

        "Markko: Whoa. Brody shot -- shot his way out of the courtroom?",
        "Starr: No. He fired shots at John, but they really weren't shots. They were blanks, and he made it look like he was gonna shoot Lowell, but then Lowell jumped behind John, and it's --",
        "Markko: Oh, but that's the beauty part, right? I mean, if Lowell was such a coward, John and Brody must have known he'd do that.",
        "Starr: Yeah, that's true.",

        "Starr: They're out looking for Jessica.",

        "Starr: You can't have a camera in a courthouse.",
        "Markko: Hidden camera. You shoot the whole thing like a home video, documentary style, and it costs nothing, and it looks gritty, real --",

        "Markko: So it's a mess?",
        "Starr: Yeah, pretty much. But you're right. It would make a good story.",
        "Markko: Yeah, right. And with the right writer, I wouldn't even need a big budget.",
        "Starr: Oh. Can you get your writer/girlfriend on that, please? Because she needs a new project.",
        "Markko: I will. If she ever gets here.",

        "Natalie: So what do we do now, just drive around in circles until the cops catch us?",
        "John: Did you get anything we can use?",
        "Brody: It was too short for a full trace, but I can get a vector.",
        "John: What's that mean?",
        "Brody: About a 5-mile radius.",
        "Natalie: Well, now we're talking.",
        "John: All right, good. We'll take it and use the forensics report and maybe we can narrow things down.",

        "Brody: Llantano Mountain.",
        "John: Okay, where's that from here?",

        "Kim: Yeah?",
        "Rex: Can that even happen?",
        "Kim: I guess 'cause it did. Like I can explain medical conditions. Ask the doctor.",

        "Kim: Be nice.",
        "Rex: If Stacy is sitting home eating ice cream, I'm letting her have it. She does not get to scare me like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Okay, first, Mayor Lord, I didn't vote, and if I did, I'm not sure I would have voted for you.",

        "Dorian: No! Do not answer! Don't! Don't!",

        "Dorian: Because this is how Mitch is tracking you. He's monitoring your phone calls.",
        "Stacy: Oh, that figures.",
        "Charlie: You're calling him? What is going on?",
        "Stacy: Who is that?",

        "Todd: Feels so good. And I know the difference. God, I was miserable after you and Dani left town. Of course, I had [Indistinct] To get there.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha! Oh, come on, things are that strange between us.",
        "Todd: A little more than strange. I'd say crazy. Except for that moment we kissed and right this second.",

        "Langston: Why would I?",
        "Ford: Well, I don't know. I thought that's what people in love did, tell each other everything.",
        "Langston: Not when it's gonna hurt them for no good reason.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Wow.",
        "Markko: What is that?",
        "Starr: Well, no. I'm proud of you, that's all.",
        "Markko: Why?",
        "Starr: Why? Because Cole spent most of last year being mad at Mr. J and months before he could even be in the same room with him.",
        "Markko: Oh, wait. That's -- that's totally different, isn't it? I mean, you kind of went after that guy.",
        "Starr: Okay, can we not go there?",
        "Markko: I'm saying, this isn't Langston. It's all Ford. Isn't it?",
        "Starr: Of course. Yeah.",
        "Markko: So, you know, the guy knows to keep his distance now. That's done. So now he's just a garden-variety jerk.",
        "Starr: You seem very enlightened.",
        "Markko: Okay, don't get crazy. I can be civil, but Ford and I, we're never gonna be buddies, not until he can get a girlfriend of his own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Ah, so this is going nowhere.",
        "Langston: Right.",
        "Ford: You have a boyfriend, you're crazy about him.",
        "Langston: That's what I said.",
        "Ford: Okay.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Ford: I don't know. I just thought that you might have felt some of what I felt.",
        "Langston: How's that?",
        "Ford: Totally, completely consumed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, the mountain access road is up there on the left. After that, I need new directions.",
        "Brody: So do we. You said something about the forensic report on Mitch's letter.",
        "John: And we got the full report.",
        "Brody: Anything there?",
        "John: Ah. No fingerprints, no palm prints, standard paper, standard ink.",
        "Brody: Oh, I checked the geology. The report showed trace amounts of two different types of rocks.",
        "John: What's that?",
        "Brody: From southwestern Australia.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Brody: And a region in South America.",
        "Natalie: So what does that mean? He was traveling the world while writing the letter?",
        "John: Or he was in a place that had samples of those types of rocks.",
        "Brody: I've been over this map 10 times. There's nothing here that fits.",
        "John: It's not on a map. Remember when you were trapped up here a few years ago?",
        "Natalie: Like I could forget.",
        "John: One of the search parties, they found an old army installation.",
        "Brody: I don't see anything.",
        "John: It was decommissioned 4 years ago. It's deserted.",
        "Natalie: Or not.",
        "Brody: Do you remember where it is?",
        "John: Yeah. Let me take a look.",

        "Stacy: Where are you taking me?",
        "Nurse Charles: Family reunion.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Nurse Charles: It's a surprise.",
        "Stacy: Wait. What family? What surprise?",
        "Nurse Charles: That tone! You should learn to be more grateful. The messenger has very special plans for this baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I know you and Stacy are buddies. You keep each other's secrets. I respect that.",
        "Kim: Oh, please.",
        "Rex: You want to pull attitude with me now? Really? Why?",
        "Kim: Because you're not worried about Stacy. It's all about the baby! Stacy's not even a real person to you. She's just this baby container. You know, you're just as bad as your crazy father with that.",
        "Rex: Wow. Okay. Here's the difference. Yes, it's true I care about the baby but I would not kill Stacy to get it. Mitch would. Stacy knew that. That's why she never fought with me about having a guard. She wanted to be safe. She wanted the baby to be safe, right?",
        "Kim: Yeah, of course.",
        "Rex: So is there any reason that Stacy would have left here without protection? Any place she would have gone? Please -- tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Well, I take that back.",
        "Markko: What?",
        "Starr: You are still worrying about this Ford guy and Langston.",
        "Markko: I'm not worried.",
        "Starr: Good. You shouldn't be worried, because you are so much better than he is and Langston is way too smart to ever let you go. You should trust her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I don't know what to say.",
        "Ford: Nothing to say. You're not available. So I guess the only thing left is -- good-bye.",

        "Markko: I do trust Langston. Completely.",
        "Starr: Not Ford?",
        "Markko: Not for a second. Are you kidding me? No. There's been too many coincidences.",
        "Starr: Like?",
        "Markko: Like I keep finding them together.",
        "Starr: What do you mean?",
        "Markko: Well, Langston and I were looking for an apartment and she went to go check out --",
        "Starr: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You're moving out?",
        "Markko: Uh, what?",
        "Starr: Why didn't you talk to us about it?",
        "Markko: Uh, you know, because, um, because it's -- it's not set.",
        "Starr: Are you mad at us?",
        "Markko: No. Um, look, it's just things are kind of tight around here, you know?",
        "Starr: Is it the baby?",
        "Markko: Okay, the look on your face. I love Hope. You know that.",
        "Starr: But you're leaving.",
        "Markko: Well, it's not just for us. I mean, don't you guys want more space? Especially now with your new sister here.",
        "Starr: That's not gonna be forever.",
        "Markko: No, I know. It's just -- look, we're not leaving tomorrow. We didn't even find an apartment.",
        "Starr: Okay, so -- go ahead. What happened?",
        "Markko: Uh, all right. There was some big mix-up. We were checking out a place, only it wasn't empty. It was Ford-filled. I walk in, Langston is there, Ford is there half-naked, looking at Langston like -- like a dog eyeing a pork chop.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Wait, so, we can't even be friends?",

        "Dorian: If you lose the car, game over.",
        "Charlie: You want me to speed up? You want me to gun the engine on this road? Then what'll that crazy nurse end up doing? Want to have a crash with Stacy in the car?",
        "Dorian: That won't make any difference.",
        "Charlie: What? It won't?",
        "Dorian: No. If that woman delivers Stacy to Mitch, then it's all over for Stacy. Would you please get the lead out?",
        "Charlie: Back off, Dorian! I'm gonna do this my way.",
        "Dorian: Now you're angry at me?",
        "Charlie: Look, I let you call the shots all along so far. And look where it got us. Look where it got that poor girl.",
        "Dorian: Oh, poor girl? Stacy? Oh, for Pete's sake. Nobody would know where she was if it wasn't for us. I mean, you know, imagine what would've happened to Stacy if we hadn't shown up there.",
        "Charlie: What, and tried to kidnap her ourselves?",
        "Dorian: Well, that woman would've disappeared with her. At least now Stacy's got a fighting chance.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, we're real heroes.",
        "Dorian: We will save her if you just step on it.",
        "Charlie: Come on, you're not really worried about Stacy. You're just afraid that that woman's gonna tell Mitch that you turned on him.",
        "Dorian: Damn straight. I don't know what -- what I would do if one of my girls ended up --",
        "Charlie: Dead. You can say it.",

        "Nurse Charles: We have an escort. The mayor and her puppy are following us.",
        "Stacy: So you want to run us off the road to lose them? Yeah, that's really smart.",
        "Nurse Charles: I know what I'm doing.",
        "Stacy: You never said where we're going.",
        "Nurse Charles: No, I didn't. Why don't you just concentrate on your little boy?",
        "Stacy: I'm not having a boy. It's a girl.",
        "Nurse Charles: That's not the prophecy.",
        "Stacy: Excuse me?",
        "Nurse Charles: It has been foretold there will be a new male heir to carry on the messenger's work.",
        "Stacy: You are such a creepy zombie. Listen, I don't care about your prophecy if it says it's a boy. Your heir isn't my baby.",
        "Nurse Charles: It is the messenger's grandson.",
        "Stacy: No, it's not.",
        "Nurse Charles: Blasphemer. Listen, why don't you just sit back and breathe calmly? Your contractions will be coming more quickly.",
        "Stacy: No, they're not. I haven't had any. I was pretending.",
        "Nurse Charles: Ha ha. Willful little girl.",
        "Stacy: I'm not due for another month. Oh, you're doing the math? You must know when I slept with Rex.",
        "Nurse Charles: Down to the hour.",
        "Stacy: Oh, God.",
        "Nurse Charles: We know everything about you, missy.",

        "Kim: Yeah. I would tell you. She might have wanted to duck you for a while. But you're right. She should've called back.",
        "Rex: Why would you leave her alone?",
        "Kim: It was for 5 minutes. We're in the middle of a hospital.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Kim: So, don't you know a bunch of cops? Isn't Bo Buchanan, like, your best friend?",
        "Rex: Bo is in Texas with the rest of the kids at the family ranch. And I don't know who else I can trust on the force anymore.",
        "Kim: There's Fish.",
        "Rex: I left him a note where we were. He's probably on his way.",
        "Kim: Call him. Tell him Stacy's missing.",

        "Nurse Charles: I will examine you myself when we arrive.",
        "Stacy: Listen, you do not want to take me to Mitch. If he finds out the truth, he'll blame you.",
        "Nurse Charles: I won't be first in line. You better hope that I can prove that this baby is the messenger's heir, or it won't go well for either one of you.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Stacy: It's my friend.",
        "Nurse Charles: Ignore it.",
        "Stacy: I can't. I have to answer it. Do you want them looking for me, too?",
        "Nurse Charles: All right. Answer. Keep it short and sweet. Tell her you're fine. Make it believable.",
        "Stacy: Hi.",
        "Kim: Girl, where are you? Rex is flipping out. He thinks Mitch grabbed you and is gonna carve you up and steal your baby.",

        "Markko: Langston didn't tell you any of this?",

        "Markko: Yeah?",
        "Starr: Yeah, and I'm sure it's probably exactly like she said. She walked in, Ford was there, it was just this big mix-up.",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Markko: Uh, it's just -- you know, it's weird right now. Our schedules are so off. Langston and I don't really see each other much these days.",

        "Langston: This is different.",
        "Ford: No guy friends?",
        "Langston: Cole, sort of, but other than that, it's the land of women at my house, and I don't have guy friends at school.",
        "Ford: They say it can't be done.",
        "Langston: Well, that's stupid. Half the world can't be my friend? I don't accept that. Well, I'll prove them wrong.",
        "Ford: I don't know.",
        "Langston: Well, can't we try?",

        "Ford: All right. We'll give it a test drive.",

        "Ford: Change the names.",
        "Langston: That won't be enough.",
        "Ford: Then you're back to square one.",

        "Ford: Really.",
        "Langston: You want to be creative? Don't move in with your boyfriend, your best friend, her boyfriend, and her kid. Oh, and now we have a long-lost sister on the couch.",
        "Ford: Wow. That's a whole full house.",
        "Langston: Yeah, tell me about it. I can barely even get my homework done.",
        "Ford: Use my office.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Ford: The University gave me an office. I'm only in there a couple hours a week. The rest of the time, it just sits there.",
        "Langston: I would be in your way.",
        "Ford: No, you wouldn't even have to see me. Here. Look. Here's a copy of my class schedule and my hours. You can avoid me completely.",
        "Langston: We really don't have to go that far, do we?",

        "Dorian: Do you believe that there's something worse than death?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Surviving. Some days.",
        "Dorian: It's a terrible thing to see your family brutalized, terrorized -- and you can't do anything to stop it. I could not believe it when he showed up again. But I said to myself this time it'll be different. You're mayor. You have powers that you never had before. You know, he tried to poison my family.",
        "Charlie: How? He was in custody.",
        "Dorian: No. Jail can't stop him. And that's when I knew I had to find another way.",
        "Charlie: So, you found me. Because I had nothing else to lose.",
        "Dorian: It must be a terrible thing -- to bury a child. How do you wake up in the morning?",
        "Charlie: Slowly.",

        "Natalie: No.",

        "John: You're doing great.",
        "Natalie: It's not so much the snow as it is the ice.",
        "Brody: It's beautiful. Jessica invited me to go to the cabin with her and Bree this winter. Bree wanted to make a snow family. Not just a snowman but snow mom, snow pets. She wants to learn how to ice skate, too. Jess let me buy her her first pair of skates.",
        "Natalie: You went with the pink?",
        "Brody: Oh, yeah. With the sparkly laces.",
        "Natalie: Those are key.",
        "Brody: We were going to play in the snow, skate, roast marshmallows. It sounds so simple, so -- normal. Someplace I never thought I'd see. Jessica gave that to me without question. She doesn't care what I did before. She -- she looks at me and she sees a good person. Because that's who she is. Jessica gave me the world without even noticing. Every second I spend with her and Bree, I feel like -- I've won the lottery. She -- she saved me. I'll die before I let Mitch take her.",
