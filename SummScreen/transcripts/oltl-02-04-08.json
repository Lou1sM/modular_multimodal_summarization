        "Jessica: Mitch Laurence was an evil, despicable man.",
        "Allison: That is not a very nice thing to say about the man whose blood runs through your body.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm nothing like him.",
        "[Allison chuckles]",
        "Allison: I wouldn't be so sure. You know what they say -- \"blood is thicker than water.\"",
        "Jessica: If you think I feel anything for him but absolute hatred, you're wrong.",
        "Allison: Ah -- my, my, so stubborn! Well, if that old truism about blood rubs you the wrong way, maybe you should try this one on for size -- \"the sins of the father shall be visited upon the child!\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Yep, it's my son.",
        "Adriana: I didn't know you had a child.",
        "Shane: So, who are you anyway?",
        "Gigi: Shane, be polite.",
        "Shane: Well, I just asked a question.",
        "Adriana: A good friend of mine was a friend of your mom's from a long time ago.",
        "Shane: Did you know my dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I need your advice.",
        "Bo: About how to knock on a door?",
        "Rex: Uh --",
        "Bo: You're already in, Balsom. What -- advice about what?",
        "Rex: Uh, my father.",
        "Bo: Walter Balsom.",
        "Rex: No. He would be the man I thought was my father.",
        "Bo: I don't understand it.",
        "Rex: It's sort of like I woke up one morning and found out my whole life was a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I know you have a long history of disappointments with him, but you need to know that Charlie has changed. And he deserves a second chance from his son. That's right. Charlie told me the truth. You're not a Buchanan -- you're Jared Banks. Charlie Banks is your father.",
        "Jared: Bastard. I should've known not to trust him.",
        "Dorian: Oh, you can trust your father.",
        "Dorian: In fact, I never would've found out if it had not been for your carelessness.",
        "Jared: But -- what do you mean, he didn't tell you?",
        "Dorian: Ooh, absolutely not. You see, I innocently happened to overhear the two of you having a heated argument just outside the front door of this very house. And when I confronted Charlie, he denied it. He was trying to protect you.",
        "Jared: Ha -- I don't believe that.",
        "Dorian: Believe this -- you are going to give Charlie, your father, a second chance or you're going to lose everything. Because if you don't, I'm not going to hesitate to let the entire world know that you are not Asa Buchanan's son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki?",
        "Viki: Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You sure no one saw you come in?",
        "Ramsey: No one.",
        "Todd: All right, so you're welcome to stay here until I figure out what my next move is.",
        "Ramsey: Till \"we\" figure out.",
        "Todd: Ramsey, I got a lot at stake here, okay?",
        "Ramsey: Yes, you do. I have my career -- and my pension.",
        "Todd: Oh. Well, I could go to prison.",
        "Ramsey: Yes, you could. Gigi Morasco tells anyone that we held her and her son at gunpoint, we're both screwed.",
        "Todd: I just wanted to get my son back, that's all.",
        "Ramsey: I know all that -- I know that. But I also know you're going to have a judge in tears if you try to tell him that with your record.",
        "Todd: Well, it's like I said -- John McBain said he could keep Gigi from talking if I convince the D.A. to back off Marcie.",
        "Ramsey: How could John McBain guarantee anything, especially Gigi's silence? And you don't think she's going to want revenge for what you put her and her son through? Uh-uh -- you buy any more of John McBain's sloppy hooey, you might as well start packing for Statesville.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Charlie: It's good to see you.",
        "Viki: You, too.",
        "Charlie: Um -- come on in. Oh. And thank God you're all right. I mean, the last time I spoke to you was right before the --",
        "Viki: Before that awful night at the diner.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I mean, I didn't even know about it until I read about it in the paper. I -- well, they -- the article said something about chest pains or --",
        "Viki: No, I'm fine, I was fine. I was never in any danger. Charlie -- I left you all kinds of messages afterwards. You never returned my calls -- why?",
        "Charlie: I know, I -- I wanted to; I didn't know what to say. I knew I wasn't going back to Texas and -- hmm -- I just thought that maybe I'd already complicated your life enough and -- but I missed you so damn much.",
        "Viki: I missed you, too.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Viki: Charlie, what are you doing here? Are you visiting somebody?",
        "Charlie: Well, no -- actually, I'm living here.",
        "Viki: You're living --",
        "Charlie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Viki: With -- with Dorian, here? Are you drinking again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You're blackmailing me.",
        "Dorian: How dare you! Here you are living in the lap of luxury, you have duped the entire Buchanan clan into thinking that you are Asa Buchanan's long-lost son, you're about to bilk them out of millions of dollars, and yet you are appalled that I might use your own duplicity against you for a higher good?",
        "Jared: Okay, look, if it's money that you want, I --",
        "Dorian: Oh, please -- I can buy and sell you, young man! Have I mentioned money? No. I'm here on a goodwill mission as a friend of your father's.",
        "Jared: Stop calling him my father.",
        "Dorian: He is your father. And for some reason, he's devastated because he feels as if he has let you down.",
        "Jared: Well, that's not my problem.",
        "Dorian: You want to know what your problem is? Your problem is that I am on to you and you are now going to do exactly what I tell you to do.",
        "Jared: I can't believe he sent you here --",
        "Dorian: No, I -- he doesn't know I'm here. How many times do I have to tell you that? Your father is a good man. And he deserves another chance to rebuild a relationship with you.",
        "Jared: I get it now.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: You're falling for him, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Todd: Hi, John. Gee, how'd you find me?",
        "John: Does it really matter? So what are you doing here -- Blair throw you out again?",
        "Todd: Huh -- what do you want?",
        "John: Just an answer -- are you going to help Marcie or are you going to go to prison for what you and Ramsey did to Gigi Morasco?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I just met your mom right now. Sorry, I don't know your dad.",
        "Shane: But you said --",
        "Gigi: Shane, I thought you had some reading to do for school.",
        "Shane: I finished it already.",
        "Adriana: What grade are you in, Shane?",
        "Gigi: Honey, um, why don't you go into the bedroom and listen to music?",
        "Shane: Right now?",
        "Gigi: Yes, now, and put your headphones on because it's late and these walls are pretty thin.",
        "Shane: Fine.",
        "Adriana: Nice to meet you, Shane.",
        "Gigi: Now, what is it that you wanted?",
        "Adriana: Is Shane Rex's son?",
        "Gigi: Now, that's a good one. Huh. You actually think Shane is --",
        "Adriana: Well, you and Rex are the same age -- I know that. And Shane looks to be about 9 years old, which means you would've been really young when you had him -- about the same age you were when you were dating Rex.",
        "Gigi: Rex was long gone from Michigan by the time I got pregnant.",
        "Adriana: Rex's Aunt Corinne said you left town right after he did.",
        "Gigi: I did, and I met someone else. Guess I was on the rebound. The rest, as they say, is history -- my history.",
        "Adriana: Rex doesn't keep things from me, you know? He told me all about running into you in Texas and now, suddenly, you're here.",
        "Gigi: Funny -- Rex didn't mention that his fianc\u00e9e was a detective, too.",
        "Adriana: I'm not.",
        "Gigi: Oh, could've fooled me because you're pretty good with the third degree.",
        "Adriana: Well, I'm just trying to understand why Rex would've left out the fact that you have a son.",
        "Gigi: Well, that would be simple -- Rex doesn't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So, Adriana and I were over at Dorian's house and we met this guy who says his name is Charlie Balsom.",
        "Bo: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Is this the same Charlie Balsom that saved you from Manning?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Adriana said that he was no relation.",
        "Rex: Well, because that's what he said when we first met him. But then I started putting the heat on Roxy about Wally and she told me that he isn't my real father.",
        "Bo: And your real father is --",
        "Rex: This guy Charlie Balsom.",
        "Bo: Oy -- okay. Does he know that?",
        "Rex: Uh -- he has no idea, according to Roxy. She goes into this rant about how Wally and Charlie were cousins, so Charlie came over one night, they got drunk, they got together and -- and -- ta-da! As if my self-esteem isn't through the roof enough, now I have -- I find out that I'm the product of two total strangers bonding over a bottle of bourbon. A little depressing.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Did you talk to Charlie about Roxy?",
        "Rex: No, she begged me not to. She was afraid her reputation would be ruined -- what's left of it. And if I can't talk to the guy --",
        "Bo: What about a D.N.A. test?",
        "Rex: Well, you can't do a test without Charlie -- right? And what if Roxy's making it up? Or -- or what if -- what if he -- he has no idea, he doesn't want anything to do with me? Where does that leave me?",
        "Bo: You know, Balsom, you have turned your life around in the past five years. Now you're engaged to this terrific girl, the two of you are very happy. If you find out who your real father is now, that's not going to change anything.",
        "Rex: Changed things for Matthew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Ooh -- what makes you think I've been drinking again?",
        "Viki: Well, you dropped off the face of the earth, you never returned my calls, and now you're living with Dorian? You know, that alone is self- destructive.",
        "Charlie: Now, look, Viki, you were there with me when I took my last drink, and I never would've made it through that without you.",
        "Viki: Okay. Uh -- you know, there's this awful thought that is going through my mind right now and --",
        "Charlie: What? Oh, no, no! Oh, there's nothing like that going on here -- no. Dorian and I are just friends.",
        "Viki: You're friends with Dorian?",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "Viki: Where did you even meet her? Did you meet her at Mo's diner?",
        "Charlie: Well, uh -- no, no. It wasn't there.",
        "Viki: Does she know that you and I know each other?",
        "Charlie: Well, she didn't know until she saw the picture -- that picture of you and I at the Bon-Jour?",
        "Viki: You still have that?",
        "Charlie: Well, of course I do. I've got it right in my folder. I'm looking at it all the time. Anyway, it wasn't until after the hostage thing that she finally admitted to me that she knew you.",
        "Viki: \"After\"?",
        "Charlie: Hmm. Yeah, because, you see, she was kind of surprised to see you in a waitress uniform and everything and I had told her that you and I had not told each other our last names and I think it was sort of out of a -- maybe a respect for your privacy that she didn't feel it was right for her to mention about your life here in Llanview.",
        "Viki: And then she just invited you to live with her?",
        "Charlie: Well, oh, yeah. She wouldn't -- huh! She wouldn't take no for an answer, no. Yeah, she's said she's got, you know, a lot of empty rooms here and, you know, she didn't want me to waste money on a hotel, so --",
        "Viki: I see. So I -- I'm assuming she's filled you in on our relationship?",
        "Charlie: Hmm -- oh, yeah. She's told me about how you're her oldest and dearest friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Me falling for Charlie? No -- huh. We're just friends -- that's all there is to it.",
        "Jared: He's a lying drunk -- you know that, right? And he's screwed over everyone in his life. You won't be an exception.",
        "Dorian: The love of my life was a recovering alcoholic named Mel Hayes, so I know what I'm talking about. I can understand why you are angry and bitter -- because of the kind of father that Charlie was, but he is a different man today. I'm telling you, I haven't seen him touch alcohol the entire time I've known him.",
        "Jared: I know my father, okay -- the man who \"was\" my father. And he's not worth your time. And he's definitely not worth mine.",
        "Dorian: You punk!",
        "Jared: What did you call me?",
        "Dorian: I called you a punk because that's exactly what you are. You are a fit-time, novice con man trying to pull off this huge scheme. How many people are on to you, punk? There's Pamela, there's me, there's Charlie -- who else? I'm telling you, sooner or later, you're going to fall.",
        "Jared: Because you're going to make that happen.",
        "Dorian: Because you are not as good as you think you are. But for some reason, despite the kind of man you have become, Charlie is desperate to make amends with you. And I intend to see that he is not denied that opportunity.",
        "Jared: If I see him, you'll keep your mouth shut?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. In fact, I'm rooting for you. Shall we?",
        "Jared: Shall we what?",
        "Dorian: Your father is at my house right now.",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Dorian: I think your coming over to see him would be such a pleasant surprise.",
        "Jared: I know I'm going to regret this.",
        "Dorian: Not as much as the alternative.",
        "Jared: There must be something in this for you.",
        "Dorian: Someday, perhaps I'll ask you to return the favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What do you want, okay? I'll write you a check when I leave here.",
        "Allison: What, I'll bribe one of the nuns to throw the bingo game my way?",
        "Jessica: Okay, then what do you want?",
        "Allison: My freedom.",
        "Jessica: Your freedom?",
        "Allison: Hmm. This secret is going to knock your socks off, Jessica, and if you want to know what it is, get me out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So, what about it? You're going to help Marcie or not?",
        "Todd: So you -- you think that if I put a couple of articles in the newspaper asking for compassion for Marcie, that the D.A. will back off?",
        "John: It's worth a shot.",
        "Todd: Okay. Well, let's say that does work and Marcie goes free. What guarantee would I have that you wouldn't come after me anyway?",
        "John: My word.",
        "Todd: Oh. Oh, your word -- well, I don't know why I even hesitated then.",
        "John: You don't have to like me to know you can trust me.",
        "Todd: What about Ramsey?",
        "John: What about him?",
        "Todd: Well, he should get the same deal I'm getting.",
        "John: You know, it's a funny thing about Ramsey -- no one's heard from him since -- since what happened in Texas.",
        "Todd: You don't think he'll resurface?",
        "John: It's hard to say.",
        "Todd: Because I know you hold him responsible for what happened to Marty. So you're saying that if -- if you keep your word and I go free, so does Ramsey? Can you live with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Well, Matthew was still a little boy when he found out that I was his father.",
        "Rex: Look, I know it's different, but I see how lucky Matthew is to have you and -- and I just think maybe, just maybe I can get lucky, too.",
        "Bo: But it's not going to change your life -- it can't. You shouldn't let it change your life.",
        "Rex: What do you mean?",
        "Bo: There was a time when I let my relationship with Pa dictate my actions -- you know, one way or the other -- and it took me a long time to figure out that Asa Buchanan couldn't define who I was. I had to do that on my own. And you have had no choice but to do that on your own, and I think you've done a great job of it, Balsom. I think that -- I'm very proud of the man that you've become.",
        "Rex: Thanks. It means a lot. But even -- even if it -- if it isn't true that I -- I don't need a father to define who I am, just -- just to know the guy might help me figure out who I am a little better, you know, put the -- the pieces of the puzzle together, as they say. You have to understand that, right?",
        "Bo: Of course. But let's talk about this Charlie Balsom.",
        "Rex: I -- I -- I really don't know much -- hardly anything except he's already done more for me than Wally ever did.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah -- he kept Manning from killing you.",
        "Rex: Saving someone's life? Uh, yeah, I think that's a pretty big deal. And looking back now, the -- the look in his eyes, I -- I didn't see it before but it was like this look of recognition, I swear, like -- like he knew me. Think I'm imagining it?",
        "Bo: No, I don't.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: I don't know. Maybe I should just tell him, Bo. Roxy doesn't want me to tell him, but I -- if the guy's my father, he has a right to know. Doesn't he? What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Just how much did Dorian tell you about our friendship?",
        "Charlie: Well, she told me that you go back a long way.",
        "Viki: That would be true.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. And she said that you shared a lot of experiences over the years.",
        "Viki: That would also be true.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. And she said that she really respects you.",
        "Viki: Okay -- that would probably be the most outrageous -- oh, my, my, my, my, speak of the devil. My goodness, if it isn't my old, dear friend Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Why would you keep your son a secret from Rex?",
        "Gigi: Did I say it was a secret? It just never came up.",
        "Adriana: Really? I would think that would be pretty big news for two people catching up after all these years.",
        "Gigi: Look, Rex and I both moved on. He was my high school sweetheart, that's it. The life I live now isn't any of his business, and I'd appreciate if you didn't tell him about Shane.",
        "Adriana: Why not?",
        "Gigi: Because the fewer people who know we're even here, the better. I want to keep my son safe.",
        "Adriana: I don't understand.",
        "Gigi: We came here to help Marcie out. I got into some trouble down in Texas for trying to help her then. I just want to get this over with and get my son back home. That's all I can really say.",
        "Adriana: Well, Rex and I don't keep secrets from each other.",
        "Gigi: This doesn't have anything to do with the two of you. Besides, don't you have more important things to think about besides my family and me? Don't you have a wedding to plan?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, we do. Do you have a problem with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I want to help you, Balsom, but whether you tell Charlie that he could be your father or not -- I think that's got to be your call.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Bo: But I don't want to see you get hurt, you know? It could -- it could turn out that this is all not true or maybe the guy just --",
        "Rex: Wants nothing to do with me? Yeah, it's -- it's risky, I know, but whatever happens, I'll -- I'll handle it. I'll figure it out.",
        "Bo: All right. I will advise you on one thing, though. Steer clear of Manning. Could be that Charlie won't be close by next me.",
        "Rex: Well, that's going to be kind of hard to do considering I'm marrying his wife's cousin.",
        "Bo: That's right. And congratulations on that, by the way. I think that's just great.",
        "Rex: Adriana told you?",
        "Bo: No, she kind of hinted at it. I already heard it through the grapevine.",
        "Rex: Oh. I wanted to tell you about it first, but this whole thing happened with Marcie, and --",
        "Bo: No, I know. I understand that.",
        "Rex: Look, the reason I wanted to talk to you about it first was because -- well, I -- whew.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Rex: Ahem.",
        "Bo: Do you -- do you need a loan?",
        "Rex: No, no. No, no, nothing like that. I was kind of wondering if you'd be my best man.",
        "Bo: Really?",
        "Rex: You've been such an influence on my life, more than anybody else since I came to Llanview. Well, the -- you know, I mean, the good part of my life.",
        "Bo: Well, I don't know if that's necessarily true but, you know, you've become very important to me. I don't think I even need to tell you that.",
        "Rex: So you'll be my best man at the wedding?",
        "Bo: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Viki? What a surprise.",
        "Viki: Oh, I'll just bet it is. And imagine my surprise when Charlie opened the door to your home.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Jared: I parked next to that stretch limousine out there. Do you really have a chauffer drive you --",
        "Dorian: Viki, I -- I don't know if you know Jared Buchanan.",
        "Viki: Yes, we've met. That was before he had my daughter committed to a psychiatric facility and you knew perfectly well she didn't need to be there.",
        "Jared: Whether that's true or not, Ms. Davidson, it wasn't my decision. Not only did her husband agree to it, but Jessica had herself committed.",
        "Viki: Please don't hide behind a technicality. You knew she wasn't Tess!",
        "Jared: Jessica's obviously been talking to you about me but I somehow doubt she's told you the whole story.",
        "Viki: I see. What would that be?",
        "Jared: Well, did she confide to you what happened in Atlantic City? When she seduced me, set me up, and sent me to prison for two years? She mention that? Two years of my life, Ms. Davidson. So yes, relatively speaking, I think a night for her in St. Ann's isn't all that unfair, now, is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ramsey's got his own set of problems. I wouldn't worry about him if I were you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but his problems are my problems now.",
        "John: Yeah, yours and the F.B.I.'s. They're still investigating him for what happened in Ireland.",
        "Todd: And what if Ramsey was able to clear up what happened in Ireland?",
        "John: Oh. All of a sudden, he's not responsible for Marty's death? It's not going to happen.",
        "Todd: But you see, that's the attitude that concerns me. I know how much you hate Ramsey and I think that you would do anything to bring him down -- including using what you know happened in Texas, which may come back to bite me. Catch my drift?",
        "John: I gave you my word, right? You help Marcie, you don't go down for what happened in Texas. When I run into Ramsey, I'll -- I'll deal with him in my own way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: A problem with your wedding? Why would I even care?",
        "Adriana: Well, you and Rex have a history. I thought maybe --",
        "Gigi: Yeah, that was high school. People grow up -- at least some people do. I did. So did Rex. And it looks like he found someone real nice to spend the rest of his life with.",
        "Adriana: Thank you.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I'm happy for him, okay? I'm happy for both of you.",
        "Adriana: It's sweet of you to say that.",
        "Gigi: Well, that's a real positive way to look at things. And I hope you'll just stay focused on how happy you are and forget all about Shane and me. Now, I swore to John that I wouldn't open the door to anyone, so if you don't mind --",
        "Adriana: Actually, I was looking for John's brother, Michael.",
        "Gigi: Well, you can see he's not here so I think it's best if you go.",
        "Adriana: Okay. Bye, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Bye. Good luck with your wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You don't want to be my -- be -- hey, you know, if it's the -- if it's the toast you're worried about --",
        "Bo: No.",
        "Rex: It's no pressure -- those things can be nerve-wracking --",
        "Bo: It's not -- it's not the toast. Hell, I'd love to make a toast to you and your bride. You know? It's just that I can't really commit to this -- not right now.",
        "Rex: Oh. Well, we can adjust the date of the wedding if you think you're going to have some kind of conflict or --",
        "Bo: No -- jeez -- Balsom, stop. Really, it's not that, either. It's just that after everything that you've told me, I just feel that you should deal with this whole father issue before you make any decisions at all.",
        "Rex: I don't understand.",
        "Bo: What if it turns out that Roxy was telling the truth? That -- that Charlie really is your father? Then maybe you -- you'll really get to know the guy. Maybe you two will become very close. And maybe it turns out that it's Charlie that should be standing up there for you at your wedding, you know?",
        "Rex: No, it won't. I -- even if he and I do hit it off, it won't be the same. We'll have only known each other for a short time. He will not have been the one that taught me the difference between right and wrong. That was you. You always told me whenever you were proud of something that I did or disappointed in me. Even today whenever I make a big decision or -- or a small one, I -- I think, \"What would Bo do?\" Would not be the man that I am today, that Adriana is going to marry, if it weren't for you. You have to be my best man, Bo.",
        "Bo: I'd be honored. Oh, God. Oh, God.",
        "Rex: Thanks. It means a lot.",
        "Bo: Yeah, that's enough.",
        "Rex: Now I just got to figure out how to get a real ring on Adriana's finger.",
        "Bo: Well, I don't know. I saw Adriana and I think that knowing she's going to marry you, she would be just as happy with that little plastic ring that she was wearing on her finger. But -- I got a feeling that you'd be a lot happier if you could give her this.",
        "Rex: Wow!",
        "Bo: This was Gabrielle's. I gave this to her on the day that she died and -- I brought it back here from the hospital and I put it in that drawer. I haven't taken it out until just now.",
        "Rex: Bo, I can't --",
        "Bo: Yes -- hey, Balsom, listen. I know you, I've -- I've watched you with Adriana. I can see how much you two love each other. And I know -- I know that Gabrielle would want this to be the symbol of that love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I'm very sorry that you had to suffer because of something that Jessica did at that time in her life. But I'm quite sure you understand that she was not well.",
        "Jared: That didn't keep me out of prison, though, did it?",
        "Dorian: Maybe you had better leave. All this new information about her daughter probably has Viki quite upset. And we will finish our business real soon.",
        "Jared: Good night, Ms. Davidson. I am sorry our meeting wasn't as pleasant as the first.",
        "[Charlie chuckles]",
        "Jared: Sir. Good night.",
        "Viki: What business do you have with him?",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm writing an article about him for \"Craze.\"",
        "Viki: Oh -- let's change the subject, shall we?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Viki: Charlie --",
        "Charlie: Hmm?",
        "Viki: I would very much like to invite you to come and stay at my house, with me.",
        "Charlie: Well, I don't know, Viki. Um --",
        "Viki: Unless you prefer to stay here. That's fine.",
        "Charlie: Well, no, no, it's not that. No, it's just that you've gone to such great lengths to protect your privacy here. I don't want to intrude.",
        "Viki: You would not be intruding on that. I would very much like you to be a part of that life -- if that's what you want.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I do.",
        "Viki: Good. Will you come then?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Charlie: Okay. And I'm sure Dorian will be happy to have one less person living here.",
        "Dorian: Oh, nonsense. Charlie, it's been a -- a pleasure having you. And believe me, if anytime --",
        "Viki: I'm going to wait in the car. I'll see you outside.",
        "Dorian: Oh, dear. My surprise was spoiled. I never would have brought Jared over here if I had known Viki was here.",
        "Charlie: You couldn't have known.",
        "Dorian: You're not angry at me, are you? You did tell me to stay out of things.",
        "Charlie: No, it's okay. Your heart was in the right place.",
        "Dorian: The good news -- after I talked to him, Jared seemed quite open to the idea of a reconciliation. Of course, that was before your dear friend Viki chewed his head off.",
        "Charlie: Well, let's be honest, Dorian. Jared is not exactly playing by the rules. I mean, he's my son and I love him but Viki is completely justified in her feelings.",
        "Dorian: That is really tolerant of you.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Look, I need to be with Viki but I hope I can continue trusting you.",
        "Dorian: How many times do I need to reassure you? I'm not going to tell a soul that Jared is your son. Hey, no worries.",
        "Charlie: Okay. Thank you, Dorian. I'll never forget what you've done for me.",
        "Dorian: And I'm going to make sure you don't forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, where are you going, John?",
        "John: I'm not going to stand around here all night while you try to make up your mind. Don't stand so close to me, all right? Back up. All right, listen to me. You take the evening, you think about what you're going to do. You give me a decision tomorrow whether you're going to help Marcie or not. Otherwise, I go to Bo, I give him everything I got, and he puts you away. It's that simple.",
        "Ramsey: You're an idiot if you listen to him.",
        "Todd: I don't think I have a choice now.",
        "Ramsey: He has no badge, no authority. He's a morose depressive who can't guarantee sunrise, let alone Gigi Morasco's silence. Empty glass, empty promise.",
        "Todd: I don't like the alternative.",
        "Ramsey: But you don't go to prison if there's no one to testify against you. There's only Gigi and her son.",
        "Todd: So you're talking about really killing them? God, you are out of your mind. No way in hell. Look, I've got till tomorrow to decide what I'm going to do about McBain. Stay here and we'll talk in the morning.",
        "Ramsey: Okay. You sleep on it. I think you'll find my solution is the only one that protects you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Rex, I'm so glad you're here. Look, I went to go see Michael earlier and --",
        "Rex: Hey, can you hold that thought for one second? There's something really important I need to do.",
        "Adriana: What?",
        "Rex: Adriana, you're everything to me. I love you with my heart and soul and I'm going to love you for the rest of my life. I promise, this one's a keeper. Will you still marry me?",
        "Adriana: Oh -- Rex, I love you so much. You are the sweetest, craziest, most wonderful person I have ever met. And yes, I'll still marry you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Jared, I was completely blindsided. I had no idea Viki was going to be here.",
        "Jared: What was she doing there with my -- with Charlie?",
        "Dorian: Stop fretting. Look, your father has no intention of telling Viki that you are his son. And I have no intention of telling her, either. And as for our little meeting, I'll be getting in touch with you soon.",
        "Jared: Good night, Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: La Boulaie, Llanfair --",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Charlie: Now I know why all the houses in this town have names. This is a big place.",
        "Viki: Well, it's not really so big once you get used to it.",
        "Charlie: Well, I could sure get used to it with you here. I'm so glad you're all right.",
        "Viki: I was so afraid I was never going to see you again.",
        "Charlie: Well, maybe we were just meant to be, huh?",
        "Viki: A lot of coincidences. Listen, Charlie, what Dorian said earlier about my past --",
        "Charlie: You know what? We can talk about all those things tomorrow.",
        "Viki: Tomorrow.",
