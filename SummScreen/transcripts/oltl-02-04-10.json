        "Kim: Stacy?",
        "Stacy: We're in a car, and we're going up-- we're going up-- Kimmie, it's snowing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute. Something is wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, there's the turn.",
        "Natalie: On the right?",
        "John: Yeah. Watch out for the car. Natalie; yeah. I see it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse Charles: I'm gonna have your head, missy.",
        "Stacy: Look out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Stacy, talk to me.",
        "Rex: Wait. You're talking to her?",
        "Kim: I was.",
        "Rex: Where is she? Oliver is on his way here. He said there's no sign she had been home.",
        "Kim: She didn't make it there.",
        "Rex: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Wait. You're on the wrong side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Pull over.",

        "Natalie: They're not stopping.",
        "Brody: Get out of the way.",
        "Natalie: I can't. There's no place to go.",
        "[Tires screech]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh, my head.",
        "Mitch: Shh. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit disoriented after the therapy you've been through. It was just a little harmless ECT. Any discomfort you may have gone through is nothing, really, Jessica, as long as it has led you to embrace your destiny.",
        "Jessica: My what?",
        "Mitch: Your future. You're about to have a baby. He's on his way right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim's voice: Don't do this, Schuy. Don't tell her you're the father. If you really love her the way you say you do, you won't hurt her like this. Rex already did that. You need to save her, save her from the truth.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Schuyler: Hey.",
        "Gigi: Hi. I just wanted to tell you, it is snowing like crazy up here. Don't even try to come.",
        "Schuyler: Too late now. I'm on the way.",
        "Gigi: Then turn around. I mean it. I don't want--",
        "Schuyler: No, no, no, no, no. No, I can't. I can't turn back. I have to see you tonight.",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Tell me what is going on.",
        "Kim: Our girl is in trouble. They got her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You could've killed us.",
        "Nurse Charles: But I didn't.",
        "Stacy: What about everybody else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Hurry up, Charlie. Be careful but hurry up.",
        "Charlie: I'm coming. Jeez! Are you okay?",
        "Dorian: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Charlie: Ah.",
        "Dorian: You?",
        "Charlie: Well, yeah. I'm a little banged up, but I'll live.",
        "Dorian: I think that crazy nurse took Stacy up that road.",
        "Charlie: No. I saw them. They went up the hill.",
        "Dorian: Uh-huh, so where's the other car?",
        "Charlie: I don't know. Oh... oh... oh, I think they went over the side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Sparking]",
        "Brody: Oh, hey, you okay?",
        "John: Yep.",

        "Todd: Ooh, yeah.",
        "Tea: Ha ha ha! Is it snowing outside?",
        "Todd: No. Why?",
        "Tea: Because if it is, that means we don't have to go anywhere.",
        "Todd: We don't have to go anywhere, anyway, you know?",
        "Tea: Sooner or later, we are gonna have to get food and water.",
        "Todd: What? What do you mean? I got some old cheese and crackers in the sock drawer.",
        "Tea: How about booze? You got booze?",
        "Todd: Oh, I got booze.",
        "Tea: Ha ha ha! No, no. Maybe we don't have to go anywhere, after all.",
        "Todd: We never have to go anywhere ever.",

        "Starr: Hey, what happened with your mom?",
        "Cole: Well, Elijah Clarke is representing her.",
        "Starr: Really? That's great. He's really good.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Well, thanks to Lowell, she can't get arraigned until tomorrow.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Cole: Yeah. Eli is down there fighting it right now, but--",
        "Starr: But you don't think he can?",
        "Cole: No. It looks like my mom is gonna spend a night in jail tonight.",
        "Starr: Oh, you're kidding me.",
        "Cole: No. I couldn't even stay there. Lowell had me escorted out of the building.",
        "Starr: Can he even do that?",
        "Cole: He can do whatever he wants because he wants my mom to suffer because of John's escape.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Sparking]",
        "John: Natalie. Natalie, can you hear me?",
        "Brody: Is she breathing?",
        "John: Natalie.",
        "Brody: Is she okay?",
        "John: We got a pulse. Hey, open your eyes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm gonna have a baby? But I'm not pregnant.",
        "Mitch: Well, the chosen one is being carried by a surrogate vessel.",
        "Jessica: I don't understand.",
        "Mitch: Do you know who I am?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Oh, God, Stace.",
        "Rex: Okay. What happened? What exactly did she say?",
        "Kim: That she was kidnapped. That crazy nurse must've got her.",
        "Rex: What? Where'd she take her?",
        "Kim: That's what I was trying to find out, but the phone went dead.",
        "Rex: I knew Mitch hadn't given up. Damn it! Ohh...",
        "Oliver: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Rex: Stacy is gone. They got her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: We got to go back.",
        "Nurse Charles: Whatever for?",
        "Stacy: We just barely missed an accident. At least two other cars hit the guardrail. The mayor and the guy could be dead.",
        "Nurse Charles: The messenger will be pleased.",
        "Stacy: What kind of nurse are you? You're supposed to help people.",
        "Nurse Charles: God helps those that help themselves. The only thing that matters is that the chosen one is safe. The messenger eagerly awaits his arrival, as does the mother.",
        "Stacy: Listen. I'm the mother here, and it's not a he. It's a she.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I thought you had to work tonight, and now with this blizzard, let's just do it another night.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, it can't wait. I'll explain when I get there.",
        "Gigi: I'm losing you.",
        "Schuyler: I'll tell you when I get there.",
        "Gigi: What's going on? Is this about the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Hey, I got no signal at all. Oh, jeez.",
        "Dorian: Wait! Wait! Where do you think you're going?",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm gonna see if I can help the people who went over the side.",
        "Dorian: Absolutely not. You're not gonna leave me here alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Can you hear us?",
        "Natalie: John?",
        "John: Right here.",
        "Natalie: What happened?",
        "Brody: There was a car that lost control and came right at us. You swerved and hit the guardrail.",
        "John: What hurts?",
        "Natalie: What doesn't?",
        "John: Yeah. Okay. Come on. I'm gonna get you out if here.",
        "Natalie: Oh! I can't. I'm stuck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Yeah. If you could just keep working on it, all right? Thanks.",
        "Starr: What did Eli say?",
        "Cole: Still working on getting my mom arraigned.",
        "Starr: Okay. Well, that's good, right?",
        "Cole: He didn't sound very optimistic.",
        "Starr: Oh, she'll be okay. We're talking about the same woman who lifted a car off of you last year.",
        "Cole: Thanks. Yeah. That was pretty incredible.",
        "Starr: Yeah. After that, one night in jail will be a piece of cake.",
        "Cole: Hey, thank you.",
        "Starr: For what?",
        "Cole: For everything. I don't know what I'd do without you.",
        "Starr: Hey, hopefully, you'll never have to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I was gone, like, one minute.",
        "Rex: The point is, Kim left Stacy, and, apparently, Mitch's nurse grabbed her, and my guess is, she's taken her to wherever Mitch is hiding out.",
        "Oliver: Okay, and she's in labor with--",
        "Kim: Mitch's grandchild, so we've got to get her back, right, before Mitch does something we all regret.",
        "Rex: Problem is that it's just us with Bo out of office, John in jail.",
        "Oliver: No. John is out. Brody busted him out of the courthouse. They're looking for Jessica.",
        "Rex: Well, if they're looking for Jessica, they're headed for Mitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Natalie: What are you gonna do?",
        "John: You'll see.",
        "[Airbag hissing]",
        "John: Okay. Come on. Let's get you out of here.",
        "Natalie: John, you're wasting your time. I'm pinned underneath the steering wheel. Just go get Mitch.",
        "John: Laurence can wait.",
        "Natalie: But Jess can't. Please. I'll be fine here. Just go and find my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I am your father, the messenger. You are my daughter Jessica Laurence.",
        "Jessica: And the baby?",
        "Mitch: The baby is the chosen one, your son. Let me show you. See? We're all ready for him. Mm-hmm. He'll be in your arms before you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Can you hear me? Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah?",
        "Gigi: Is this about the baby?",
        "Schuyler: It is. Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Oh, there's a lot of static.",
        "Schuyler: We'll talk when I get up there.",
        "Gigi: Wait. Is there something wrong with the baby?",
        "Schuyler: No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing like that. The baby hasn't even been born yet.",
        "Gigi: But Stacy was in labor.",
        "Schuyler: No. She wasn't.",
        "Gigi: What do you mean, unless-- was it false labor?",
        "Schuyler: I'll tell you when I get there.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, what's going on? What aren't you telling me? Do you not trust me?",
        "Schuyler: Of course I trust you, more than anyone in the world.",
        "Gigi: Then tell me what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Dorian, that car that we saw coming towards us went off the road and is probably down at the bottom of that ravine, and there may be people who are hurt.",
        "Dorian: Or dead, and, okay, let's say they're hurt, all right? So, if you manage to climb down that icy mountain, what are you going to do?",
        "Charlie: I don't know. You're the doctor.",
        "Dorian: Well, I'm certainly not gonna go down there, absolutely not. I don't have my doctor bag. I have no equipment--and neither are you.",
        "Charlie: Oh, gee--",
        "Dorian: Hey!",
        "Charlie: What? What? So, what are we gonna do, just leave them down there to die?",
        "Dorian: Ooh, we're gonna find some place where there is phone service, and then we'll call for help.",
        "Charlie: I can't just walk away when there are people down there hurt.",
        "Dorian: Charlie, do I have to remind you, Mitch Laurence killed your son. He's got Jessica now. Heaven knows what he's going to do to her and that Stacy girl. We only have one thing we need to do--find Mitch and kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Nurse Charles: Stop it.",
        "Mitch: The vessel has arrived. The chosen one can be born.",
        "Stacy: Stay away from me.",
        "Nurse Charles: If all goes well.",
        "Mitch: Why shouldn't it? What took you so long?",
        "Stacy: Listen. I've never been so happy to see someone in my entire life. Are you okay? They didn't hurt you, did they? Oh, we can work together. We can get out of here, okay? Hey, there's two against two, and I can fight dirty. Look. I know we haven't been the best of friends, but Rex is so worried about you. They all are. Are you okay? Jessica! What the hell did they do to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole...",
        "Cole: Yeah?",
        "Starr: It's late.",
        "Cole: All right. Look. You just go ahead. I'm gonna check in with Eli.",
        "Starr: You know he will call you as soon as he hears anything.",
        "Cole: Well, I can't sleep with my mom in jail.",
        "Starr: And you can't help her if you're exhausted.",
        "Cole: I just wish there was something more that I could do for her.",
        "Starr: You can get some rest. Come on. Now. Come to bed. Let's go. Bedtime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Jessica, it's Stacy. Do you not remember me?",
        "Mitch: You let Dorian Lord and Charlie follow you up that mountain?",
        "Nurse Charles: When I got to the hospital, they had Stacy. I had to fight them.",
        "Mitch: What do you mean, they had Stacy?",
        "Nurse Charles: They were leaving with her. I surprised them in the parking garage.",
        "Stacy: Jessica.",
        "Mitch: And then what happened?",
        "Nurse Charles: And then they followed us.",
        "Mitch: So much for Dorian's loyalty as mayor.",
        "Nurse Charles: I don't think she's gonna be a problem anymore.",
        "Mitch: Oh, yeah? And why is that?",
        "Nurse Charles: It's snowing heavily. She lost control of her car. I think they went over the mountainside.",
        "Mitch: And so she's dead?",
        "Nurse Charles: I didn't stop, but from what I could see, it was a very bad accident.",
        "Mitch: God rest their souls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Hurry up, Charlie. We cannot stay here.",
        "Charlie: I can't get this engine to turn over. We're not going anywhere.",
        "Dorian: I am not gonna stay here in a car on an icy road. It's dangerous. We could be hit.",
        "Charlie: There is no one out there, Dorian. Who would be out driving on a night like this?",
        "Dorian: We were, Charlie. All it takes is one car, one car, and we are down that ravine, too.",
        "Charlie: Okay. Look. I don't want to get hit any more than you, but I just don't know what I can do about it.",
        "Dorian: Oh...",
        "Charlie: Will you just-- I'm doing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: It's not working, John.",
        "John: Here. Help her up. Natalie, I'm not leaving you.",
        "Natalie: John, John, please. I'm fine. Just go and do what you need to to get my sister. You can come back and get me.",
        "John: Pretty stiff by the time we got back.",
        "Natalie: Jessica is in trouble...",
        "John: So are you.",
        "Natalie: And if Mitch escapes, we're never gonna find her.",
        "John: Listen. I'm not leaving you, so forget it. Uh!",
        "Brody: Guys, I can't get a signal. We got to try something else.",
        "John: What?",
        "Brody: I got an idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: It's time.",
        "Stacy: Time for what?",
        "Mitch: Why, to deliver the chosen one, of course.",
        "Stacy: How? I mean, look at me. I'm not in labor. Tell him.",
        "Nurse Charles: Stacy's labor appears to have stopped.",
        "Mitch: Oh. Well, perhaps we should examine the vessel.",
        "Stacy: Oh, no. That's not gonna happen. No one is touching me.",
        "Mitch: There's nowhere to hide.",
        "Stacy: Jessica, wake up. I need your help.",
        "Mitch: Good girl.",
        "Stacy: What did you give her? Why is she acting like such a zombie?",
        "Mitch: If you don't cooperate, Stacy, you'll find out for yourself.",
        "Stacy: Look, I don't know what you have going on here, but I really don't want to be any part of it, so just please let me go.",
        "Mitch: Go where? Out into that blizzard all on your own? No, Stacy. That's just not sensible. Look, you're cold and you're tired. You've been through a very long ordeal. The sensible thing would be to let Nurse Charles make sure your baby is all right.",
        "Nurse Charles: That's what a good mother would do.",
        "Mitch: See, a good mother wouldn't go out into the dark and the cold, especially when she knows that she is so very far from any hospital.",
        "Nurse Charles: She would ask for help.",
        "Stacy: Hey. Stay away from me.",
        "Mitch: Stacy, don't be foolish. You really think you can take care of a fragile, tiny baby without our help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: So, if Stacy is in labor, it's way too early.",
        "Kim: Look. My best friend was just kidnapped, okay? Now is not the best time to bring up the fact that Rex isn't the father.",
        "Oliver: I'm just worried, okay? If Stacy gives birth, then the baby might need help or something.",
        "Kim: So, we need to find her, and if Rex thinking he's the father puts a fire under him, then who cares whether or not she's in labor?",
        "Oliver: Um, she's not in labor?",
        "Kim: Will you drop it?",
        "Oliver: Kim, would you just tell me, is she faking it?",
        "Kim: Yes, okay?",
        "Oliver: Okay. Good. I mean, not good that she's lying, but good that the baby is--",
        "Kim: You are working my last nerve here, tuna.",
        "Oliver: Okay. Fine, but maybe we should call Schuyler.",
        "Kim: Why?",
        "Oliver: Because-- Kim, because you know why.",
        "Kim: There's nothing he can do except--please, God--keep his mouth shut and don't tell Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What happened at the hospital after I left?",
        "Schuyler: Nothing.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, I can handle it. Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, you just need to know I love you, okay?",
        "Gigi: Oh, now you're scaring me.",
        "Schuyler: Why?",
        "Gigi: Because whenever anybody says that instead of answering a question, it's always bad news.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay. Look. I just-- I'm going to tell you the truth. Rex isn't--",
        "[Tires squealing]",
        "Gigi: Schuyler? Oh... Schuyler?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, we keep making these mistakes, huh?",
        "Tea: Yeah. We should probably talk about that.",
        "Todd: Not supposed to be a joke.",
        "Tea: Oh, I know.",
        "Todd: Well, before, you said you were okay with it.",
        "Tea: Tonight was wonderful.",
        "Todd: Okay, so what's the problem?",
        "Tea: We both needed it, but, well, we still haven't figured out where we stand.",
        "Todd: Think that's pretty obvious, don't you?",
        "Tea: No, not how we feel, but where we stand. We haven't resolved anything, Todd.",
        "Todd: It's just like a lawyer to talk everything to death.",
        "Tea: Well, you'll be happy to know that we're not gonna figure anything out tonight, okay?",
        "Todd: We're not, huh?",
        "Tea: No. I need a clear head, and I don't happen to have a clear head right now.",
        "Todd: So, what do you want to do now? Steak is not an option for me, I don't think.",
        "Tea: Yeah. You said you had some booze.",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. No. I got to go see Viki. I'm sorry.",
        "Tea: You don't think she's in bed right now?",
        "Todd: No. She's probably going crazy about Jess.",
        "Tea: Oh, yeah. Well, I'll come with you.",
        "Todd: No, no. You stay here in case Dani calls.",
        "Tea: Oh. Good idea.",
        "Todd: Plus, it'll be nice to know you're here when I get back, and you will be here when I get back.",
        "Tea: Yeah. I will. I promise.",

        "Charlie: Look. I just thought I heard something.",

        "Gigi's voice: Maybe not, but it's enough to make that pregnancy go away.",
        "Stacy: I lost the baby.",
        "Mitch: Well, if that's true, why didn't you tell Rex that you had had a miscarriage?",
        "Stacy: I was going to, but I just couldn't. I mean, the baby was the only tie we had. Rex didn't really-- I mean, he wasn't exactly convinced that he wanted to be with me, so he had to stick around because of the baby, and I had the miscarriage, and losing the baby was hard enough, but to lose Rex, too? And my friend Kimmie came in town, and she had this great idea, but I knew if I could get pregnant, like, instantly, I could make Rex believe that it was still his. The only problem was, I wasn't gonna get Rex to sleep with me, so Kim and I came up with a list.",
        "Kim's voice: So, who'll it be?",
        "Stacy's voice: Okay, boys. Which of you is gonna make me pregnant with Rex's child?",
        "Stacy: All I know is, this isn't Rex's baby. I know you had big plans, and I'm sure you're disappointed, and I'm sorry. I really am. I would've given anything to have a baby with Rex. It just didn't work out that way.",
