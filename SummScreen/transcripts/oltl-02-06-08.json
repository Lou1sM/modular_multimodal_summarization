        "Todd: Ah!",
        "Blair: Oh, look at that!",
        "Todd: Sam's idea. He wanted to say thank you for taking such good care of him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ofc. Fish: This computer is a relic from the Mesozoic age. We're looking at one very extinct T-Rex.",
        "Antonio: Oh, uh -- science aside, is there any way you can recover the department files?",
        "Ofc. Fish: Uh, well, I'd have to get my laptop from the car, try to hack --",
        "Antonio: Do it.",
        "Ofc. Fish: Okay.",
        "Antonio: Sahid gets near a machine and it self-destructs.",
        "Police chief: This is the first I've heard of it.",
        "Antonio: Oh, what, are you kidding me? She's legendary. I mean, weren't you the slightest bit curious as to why the Llanview P.D. wanted to get rid of her?",
        "Police chief: Ah, she's not that bad.",
        "Talia: Hmm.",
        "Antonio: Ahem. Ah!",
        "Talia: That went well!",
        "Antonio: Well, you have to convince him that you are that bad and I will convince Fish that he wants to work here.",
        "Talia: Oh. Well, but how do you know Bo will switch me out for Fish?",
        "Antonio: Uh, he'll -- he'll do it.",
        "Talia: In spite of the fact that I basically ran out of there like a bat out of hell?",
        "Antonio: In spite of that.",
        "Talia: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Hey, guys.",
        "Vincent: Hello!",
        "Layla: Hey! How's it going?",
        "Adriana: Good! Oh!",
        "Layla: Your voicemail sounded stressed.",
        "Vincent: Hello.",
        "Layla: You okay?",
        "Adriana: Better than okay.",
        "Vincent: Oh!",
        "Layla: Hello!",
        "[Vincent chuckles]",
        "Vincent: So Rex finally came to his senses.",
        "Layla: Wow.",
        "Adriana: It's an heirloom -- Bo gave it to Rex to give to me.",
        "Vincent: Hmm, nice, nice, nice.",
        "Layla: Well, now that you've got the rock, we have to work on your dress. Fabric time!",
        "Vincent: Oh, sweetheart, my meeting is about to start. I'm going to go mosey on over.",
        "Layla: Okay.",
        "Vincent: Bye. Congratulations.",
        "Adriana: Thank you.",
        "Layla: Okay. I knew the swatches would scare him away. Now, your phone call -- it wasn't just about showing me a new ring, was it?",
        "Adriana: It's about Rex.",
        "Layla: All right.",
        "Adriana: I think he may have a son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Mom told you, didn't she? That I'm your son?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, she came to me, but --",
        "Rex: You must've had a pretty big reaction, huh? Hearing something like that after all these years? You know, I went pretty crazy myself when -- when Roxy told me. The first thing I wanted to do was -- was come to you about it, but she didn't want me to.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, there's a good reason for that, Rex.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I know -- she's worried about her reputation for once, but who cares? Why would anyone judge her for this now? I'm just glad that it's finally out -- or not, because maybe you don't like the idea of having a grown son. And, hey, I'm cool with that. If -- if you'd rather I get lost, then just say so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Dorian, what do you want? You know what -- never mind. Just go away.",
        "Dorian: You needn't be so rude.",
        "Viki: Oh, please. I have not begun to be rude. Aren't you embarrassed to be wandering around in my house, wandering into my bedroom as if you still lived here?",
        "Dorian: At least I don't throw myself at every Tom, Dick, and David that crosses my path.",
        "Viki: Oh, Dorian, I've not had David in my bed -- well, not since Paris, Texas. Please go away.",
        "Dorian: Not until I tell you about your friend -- Charlie.",
        "Viki: I am really not interested in anything you have to say about Charlie.",
        "Dorian: You should be. You see, I got to know him very well while you were away serving up cornbread and grits.",
        "Viki: Dorian, you know, you may not have noticed this, but I'm happy -- I'm so happy.",
        "Dorian: Since you told Charlie we were such good friends, I -- I know you won't mind my asking. Did you get lucky last night?",
        "Viki: Oh, my God. Oh, never mind, it's all right. I know that you're frustrated.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me?",
        "Viki: Well, I mean, Clint walked out on you, took up with Nora, didn't he?",
        "Dorian: No, I -- I walked out on Clint.",
        "Viki: Oh, okay, fine -- you walked out on Clint.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Viki: I'm still not interested in anything that you have to say about -- about a man with whom I'm actually very close.",
        "Dorian: Really? If you're so close, did Charlie tell you about the decision he made?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey, that's -- that's cool. Like I said, can't say that I wasn't warned. Roxy told me that you wouldn't want to know and, you know, who can blame you? You get drunk one night and wind up having a kid you never wanted.",
        "Charlie: It's not that.",
        "Rex: No, don't worry about it -- really. Not like you owe me or anything. I've gotten along a long time without a father. So, I'll survive, okay? I'll be fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: No way -- Rex reproduced?",
        "Adriana: I think so.",
        "Layla: You think? Did he tell you?",
        "Adriana: I don't think Rex even knows about the boy.",
        "Layla: Uh, I don't get it.",
        "Adriana: Huh -- all right. You know his ex, Gigi, from Paris, Texas? Well, she's in town for Marcie's arraignment, so I run into her and in walks this kid and he looks to be about the age that he'd be if Rex had gotten her pregnant in high school and he looks exactly like Rex.",
        "Layla: Okay, slow down, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: I know, Layla -- this all sounds really circumstantial, but get this -- she never told Rex that she had a son and she asked me point-blank not to mention the kid to Rex.",
        "Layla: Well, did you ask her if her son was Rex's?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. She said no.",
        "Layla: Then maybe he isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Have Shepherd cover for Vega until he's back from this Cherryvale fiasco, okay? Thanks.",
        "Lindsay: Look, I -- I'm sorry that you've had to take time out of your busy day to come do this.",
        "Bo: No, no, no, no, it's all right. Believe me, I want to treat this whole guardianship, you know, thing -- I want to follow the rules to a T. I don't want to risk your freedom.",
        "Lindsay: Huh -- you know what? You just don't want to risk losing your legal hold on me, that's what it is.",
        "Bo: Well, why would I? I like having you around.",
        "Markko: If you'll follow me, Mr. Jones is waiting for you at table two.",
        "Bo: You know, actually, we can see Mr. Jones from here.",
        "Markko: Well, I'm trying to keep busy. I don't want to look like I'm slacking.",
        "Bo: Okay, got it.",
        "Markko: This way.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "Lindsay: Oh -- just for the record, I like being legally tied to you, too.",
        "Vincent: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, Sam! These are absolutely beautiful flowers and you are a handsome little devil, yes, you are! Thank you so much.",
        "Todd: He's a chip off the old block.",
        "Blair: Yeah, right. Hmm.",
        "Todd: Yeah, we wanted to thank you for doing such a great job with him. It's been tough, I know, but it's going to get easier of course.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm sorry that I didn't make a better impression. I really wanted to.",
        "Todd: Well, it's been a difficult transition for him.",
        "Blair: Well, it hasn't helped that you've been a little distracted, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I've been busy dealing with that idiot Ramsey.",
        "Blair: Oh. Ramsey is anything but an idiot and I want you to tell me, please, that you finally got rid of him?",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, I paid him off, sent him packing.",
        "Todd: What do you want?",
        "Nora: John been telling me some interesting stories about you --",
        "Todd: John. Don't you know that what happens in Vegas --",
        "Nora: That could directly affect my case against Marcie McBain -- can we come in? It's really cold out here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Talia screams]",
        "Talia: Um -- um -- oh. Oh.",
        "Police chief: What happened here?",
        "Talia: I think I broke it.",
        "Police chief: Ah, don't worry. Thing was on its last legs. Man, it's hot in here.",
        "Talia: Oh, yeah. Uh -- about that, I -- I went to turn up the heat and that -- that box thing? It -- it just, like, fell off.",
        "Antonio: Boy, do the folks here ever need you.",
        "Ofc. Fish: Yeah, if I hadn't have been here, they'd have lost all their records since 2001.",
        "Antonio: Well, what a nightmare.",
        "Ofc. Fish: Yeah, next time, it's game over.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, it's too bad -- too bad we can't clone you, Fish -- leave Fish number two here at C-vale?",
        "Ofc. Fish: Yeah, I know, but that would take weeks -- I mean, months. Can't bail on the commissioner like that.",
        "Antonio: Well, what if the commissioner agreed to, um, make the sacrifice, let you work here -- C-vale?",
        "Ofc. Fish: Well, there's no crime here. I'd love that. But the commissioner would never go for it. I am too valuable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Listen, I really want to thank you again. Thank you for keeping that gallery going while I was away at St. Ann's.",
        "Vincent: Well, ever since the \"Real Americans\" exhibit, I felt a real connection to the place and, you know, I love the work.",
        "Lindsay: And you know what? You got a real good eye for it, too.",
        "Vincent: Ah, thank you. You know, it's really nice to see you back into the swing of things and on your feet.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I don't know about the swing but I am still finding my footing.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, well, it helps to have friends that you can count on, you know? So, how long you going to need to stay with the commissioner?",
        "Lindsay: Um -- well, it's an open-ended guardianship. I stay there until my doctor thinks I'm well enough to be on my own.",
        "Vincent: Well, I hope that happens soon.",
        "Bo: Well, she's welcome to stay as long as she needs to.",
        "Lindsay: To business, then. Um -- I've got some very exciting news about the project I asked you to help me with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Listen. I want you to know that a radical change of heart about your son's kidnapper could be Marcie's best bet against a conviction. So?",
        "Todd: So, uh --",
        "Nora: Is what John's saying true?",
        "Todd: Well, why would you ever doubt John?",
        "Blair: Look, I just put Sam down for a nap. What are they doing here?",
        "Nora: Your husband is thinking about speaking to the judge at Marcie's arraignment.",
        "Blair: Well, that's right. He wants to make sure she's prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.",
        "Nora: Well, actually, according to John, he would like to go and ask for leniency for Marcie.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Rex, you're getting this all wrong. It's not like I'm denying that I'm your father -- I mean, I've already told someone else about it.",
        "Rex: Who?",
        "Charlie: Yeah -- well, that doesn't matter.",
        "Rex: Well, it does to me.",
        "Charlie: Viki Davidson.",
        "Rex: Really? What'd she say?",
        "Charlie: Look, she's a big fan of yours, Rex. She thinks very highly of you.",
        "Rex: Doesn't that count for anything?",
        "Charlie: Yes, it does. I -- I respect her opinion but I'm -- I'm still a little conflicted about this.",
        "Rex: Sure. The trouble is I -- I -- I've played out this thing in my head over and over again, telling you that -- that I'm your son. And in my fantasy, you were as happy about it as I was -- this stand-up guy that everyone seems to like who fought off Todd, saved my life -- like a father would do for his son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: His decision? Do you mean that he chose me over you?",
        "Dorian: No! Please. You see, I had the man living under my roof for weeks. And in the intimacy of long nights when neither one of us could sleep, he confided in me. He unburdened himself, told me his deepest, darkest secrets and I'm not talking about his alcoholism.",
        "Viki: Okay, for your information, yes, he did tell me his secret. I know all about his son.",
        "Dorian: Charlie told you?",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Who his son is?",
        "Viki: Well, of course he did. Sorry. You're not going to be able to protect me from Charlie after all.",
        "Dorian: I'm just surprised -- that he took the risk, given all the implications? And, of course, the connection with your children?",
        "Viki: Well, yes, I grant you it's a coincidence, an odd one, but it's no big deal.",
        "Dorian: It doesn't bother you?",
        "Viki: Well, of course it doesn't. Dorian, why would it bother me that Rex Balsom is Charlie's son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I didn't come here to hurt you, Rex.",
        "Rex: Well, how could you? It's not like, you know, we knew each other. It's not like I'm some little boy who -- who needs a father. I've taken care of myself for a long time. Roxy tell you how she let Aunt Corinne raise me? I didn't even have a mom growing up, so -- so this -- this isn't any different than I'm used to.",
        "Charlie: Well, I just feel bad about getting your hopes up.",
        "Rex: Stupid on my part. No hopes, no disappointments -- always worked for me before.",
        "Charlie: You know, not that I have any business telling you this, but that's no way to live your life.",
        "Rex: Don't get hurt that way.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and you don't feel joy, either.",
        "Rex: Careful. You're starting to sound like a dad here.",
        "Charlie: Look, I really am sorry, Rex.",
        "Rex: Don't be. Like I said, it's not your fault, it's not anybody's fault. It's t -- it's the way it is. But I got to say, it was -- it was nice having a father for all of five minutes, somebody everybody seems to like. To know that I come from that makes me feel good about myself, that I'm not some loser.",
        "Charlie: You -- a loser? No, no way. No -- even what little I know about you, you're no loser. You're a fine young man. Roxy has every reason to be proud of you.",
        "Rex: Well it doesn't take a whole lot to make Roxy proud. But like I said, it's not your problem.",
        "Charlie: I'd better be going.",
        "Rex: Charlie? There's just -- there's one thing I don't get. If you don't want to be my father, why'd you tell Viki you are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: So Gigi has a son -- so what? But she has baggage, too. She could be facing serious jail time for helping Marcie evade the F.B.I. There could be any number of reasons why she wants to keep that kid undercover, but you choose the worst one.",
        "Adriana: I didn't.",
        "Layla: You haven't even discussed this with Rex. You have to talk to him. You can't keep secrets from the man you're about to marry -- especially big ones, like the size of a real, live kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Each one of these hearts is going to be a unique piece of art and what I've asked Vincent to do is to go around to all the accessible locations in Llanview and put them out there. Each person's going to be invited to write their secret down on a piece of paper, put it in -- into the box -- and then, they're going to also put money in there and all of that money is going to go to the American Heart Association \"Go Red for Women\" campaign.",
        "Bo: Hmm, that's a great idea.",
        "Vincent: No, wait. Tell the commissioner the name of the project.",
        "Lindsay: \"Get it off your chest.\"",
        "Vincent: Come on, now. That's hot, right? \"Get it off your chest.\"",
        "Bo: That's great.",
        "Vincent: Think about it -- it taps into a real basic need that we all feel. You know, the first sculpture is due at the art gallery at any moment. Why don't you go find a nice place to put it and I'm going to go pick it up?",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Lindsay: Okay.",
        "Bo: You know what?",
        "Lindsay: What?",
        "Bo: It's just good to see you involved in your work again.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I owe a great deal of that to you, don't I?",
        "Adriana: Uh, Bo, sorry to interrupt.",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "Adriana: Um -- I just wanted to say thank you. Rex gave it to me last night.",
        "Bo: Looks great on you.",
        "Adriana: I understand Gabrielle was a very special woman.",
        "Bo: Yeah, she was.",
        "Adriana: Well, I'm so honored to wear this, so thank you. See ya.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "Lindsay: You gave Gabrielle's engagement ring to Rex?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Lindsay: Wow, you're an amazing guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: How's the -- how's the little guy doing?",
        "Todd: He's terrific. Can we get this over with?",
        "Blair: Todd, are you really considering going easy on Marcie?",
        "Nora: I would've thought the two of you had talked about this before.",
        "Todd: No, no, we've been too busy raising our third child to be thinking about Marcie.",
        "Nora: Really? So, the choice of whether or not to comply with the prosecution comes down to a time-management issue?",
        "Todd: And why do you care?",
        "Nora: Because I have a case to prepare and I've got the mayor watching it like a hawk to make sure that personal and professional lines don't get crossed -- again.",
        "Todd: Oh, no, that's John's fault.",
        "John: And I take full responsibility. Look, when -- when Manning told me he was thinking about asking for leniency, of course I came to you.",
        "Nora: Is that right?",
        "John: Yeah, and I know I'm not a lawyer, but I would imagine if he doesn't cooperate with the prosecution -- I mean, that doesn't really give your office a lot to do.",
        "Nora: Well, if Todd should decide to withdraw his complaint, then it certainly weakens our case.",
        "John: Of course, there's always Gigi Morasco. Talk about your hostile witnesses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ramsey: Who is it?",
        "Markko: Food delivery. Uh -- grilled pork and a side of platanos?",
        "Ramsey: What's the damage?",
        "Markko: 20 bucks.",
        "Ramsey: 20 bucks? Better be good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Todd, you should know that your testimony could put Marcie away for the rest of her life, but I certainly would understand if now that you have your son back, you should suddenly demonstrate uncharacteristic humanity towards the woman who has sheltered your child for the first year and a half of his life.",
        "Blair: You know what? I would be very proud if you went easy on Marcie. I can't help but feel sorry for her.",
        "John: What are you going to do?",
        "Todd: It's about our kid's welfare. It's a big decision, isn't it?",
        "Blair: I'm going to go check on your boy.",
        "Nora: John, my office doesn't have time for your little games, so what is it that you're planning to do?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I guess I'll decide whenever I decide.",
        "John: We'll settle this, okay? I'm sorry.",
        "Nora: Do that, will you?",
        "John: Uh-huh.",
        "Nora: And don't ever drag me back to this house again.",
        "John: Understood.",
        "Nora: Goodbye, thank you so much.",
        "John: So, microfibers --",
        "Todd: Yes -- remember that.",
        "John: I'll remember. Hey, you know what I think I'm going to do tomorrow? I think I'm going to go by the station. I want to bring Morasco and her kid by and when she tells her little story about how you and Ramsey kidnapped them, well, I think you can kiss this all goodbye.",
        "Todd: I thought you were going to give me a whole day to make my decision.",
        "John: Let me tell you something. If Marcie goes down, you're going down with her.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Todd: Sorry, hold on. Hey, Branagh, what's going on? Well, not without my approval you're not. I don't know what you're going to tell them. You're going to yell \"stop the presses,\" I don't care. I'm not -- I'm not putting something to press without my approval.",
        "Blair: Well, guess who is awake.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'll be right there. Thanks a lot. Hey.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Something came up at the paper, I got to go.",
        "Blair: What, are you -- hey, you said you took the whole afternoon off for us! Todd! Oh. So, can you tell me what just happened here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, that's my friend Starr and her parents. Is this her dad's place?",

        "Dorian: Forgive me for finding intrigue where there was none.",
        "Viki: Well, that's all right. I mean, you can't help it -- it's in your D.N.A.",
        "Dorian: Oh! Charlie's such a wonderful man, really. I -- I'm -- I'm so happy that he told you that Rex Balsom is his son.",
        "Viki: Okay -- why?",
        "Dorian: Because Rex is going to be my son-in-law and Charlie seems so fond of you, I'm sure there are going to be wedding bells. Think about it -- you and me, one big, happy family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: You'd still want me to be your father? I mean, even after everything you know about me?",
        "Rex: What do I know? That you and Roxy were drinking the night that I was conceived, that it was just that one time? Now, I don't judge you -- why would I?",
        "Charlie: Well, some sons would.",
        "Rex: Well, not me. I don't judge anyone, not -- not after the mistakes that I've made.",
        "Charlie: You know, I haven't always been this great guy that you seem to think I am.",
        "Rex: Like father, like son. Look, look, we can take this whole thing slow if you're not sure, sort of to test the waters.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Rex: And if it doesn't work out, no harm, no foul. We -- we don't have to -- have to do anything right away. We just -- we just talk sometime or go to breakfast somewhere or take in a Sixers' game -- I cannot believe I just said that. Talk about lame -- \"Dad, will you take me to a game?\" Are we cool?",
        "Adriana: Hey, I'm home. Oh, Charlie, you're still here uh -- should I come back?",
        "Rex: Uh, no, it's okay. Better than okay -- it's great. Charlie and I have decided to -- to try things out, get to know each other.",
        "Adriana: Oh, Charlie, that is so great! I mean, you don't know what this means to Rex and -- and to me, too, because I know it's something that he wants and -- I'm gushing. I'm sorry.",
        "Rex: No, no -- gush, gush away. Please, it's not every day a guy gets a new dad -- or -- or a dad at all. So we'll -- we'll do something soon.",

        "Police chief: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? Everything's broken.",
        "Ofc. Fish: Sorry, but I'm on Bo Buchanan's dime right now. It's a shame, isn't it? C-vale's going to have to pull through without Fish.",
        "Antonio: Uh -- listen, uh, chief? You know, if you're willing to -- to let go of Sahid -- maybe you could use, you know, her salary to hire Fish?",

        "Todd: Yeah. Apparently if I don't -- if I don't walk McBain's walk, Gigi and her kid are going to talk.",
        "Ramsey: Ah, don't worry. I got you covered. With this baby, a fellow can tap a busy waitress from 10 clicks and disappear before you know it.",

        "John: I don't think Todd has a lot to gain by bringing the hammer down on Marcie.",
        "Blair: Well, John, Todd doesn't think like that. He does what he wants and until you showed up, he was ready to bury Marcie and Michael.",
        "John: Things change, I guess.",
