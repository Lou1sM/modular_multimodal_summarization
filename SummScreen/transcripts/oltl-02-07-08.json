        "Lindsay: Wow! Look how many people have put papers in there!",
        "[Lindsay gasps]",
        "Lindsay: Hey, girlfriend!",
        "Addie: I'm so glad to see you.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah!",
        "Addie: You look well --",
        "Lindsay: Thank you.",
        "Addie: A little tired, maybe.",
        "Lindsay: Well, you know me. I don't sleep, I don't -- I have too much to do.",
        "[Addie chuckles]",
        "Miles: So is this your doing?",
        "Lindsay: Yep. That's all part of the Campbell's \"Go Red\" charity ball. See, people are supposed to write their secrets down on a piece of paper and you put them in the box with a dollar.",
        "Miles: Ah.",
        "Lindsay: See -- there.",
        "Miles: Looks like this town is full of secrets.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah.",
        "Addie: Every heart has a secret or two.",
        "Lindsay: I just wonder if it works.",
        "Miles: What do you mean?",
        "Lindsay: Well, I just wonder if writing down something on a piece of paper that no one's eyes are ever supposed to see -- I wonder if that brings them peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Jessica: I am so mad at you!",
        "Nash: Right back at you, Tess.",
        "Jessica: I am not Tess and you know it!",
        "Nash: Really? How do I know that -- because you tell me so, Jess/Tess? Because what about the next time you decide to break the rules, huh? What happens then?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Are you following me?",
        "Jared: I am here to see Nash -- are you following me?",
        "Natalie: All right. I was here first -- I'm here to see my sister.",
        "Jared: Are you ever going to forgive me, Natalie?",
        "Natalie: For which thing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi's what?",
        "Adriana: Her son?",
        "Rex: She doesn't have a son.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, she does and his name is Shane.",
        "Rex: No! That's her significant other.",
        "Adriana: Well, unless she's dating a 9-year-old who calls her \"Mom\" --",
        "Rex: She has a kid?",
        "Adriana: And for some reason, she didn't want you to know.",
        "Rex: Why would Morasco not tell me she had a son?",
        "Adriana: I can think of one good reason -- Daddy.",
        "[Rex chuckles]",
        "Rex: What? No! Are you serious?",
        "Adriana: Do I look like I'm joking, Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Gigi: Any chance those could be peacemakers, not killers?",
        "Shane: We're at war, Mom, if you haven't noticed.",
        "[Key turns in lock]",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "John: It's just me.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "John: Everything okay?",
        "Gigi: Well, it's a bloodbath over here on the floor.",
        "Shane: They don't have blood -- they're plastic.",
        "Gigi: But otherwise, we're cool.",
        "John: Okay. You know, you really don't have to do that.",
        "Gigi: I'm just tidying up. It's no big deal -- it's the least I can do, John. Um -- any word on Ramsey?",
        "John: He still hasn't surfaced.",
        "Gigi: So, no sign of him here in Llanview?",
        "John: So far, so good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: So we have a problem. Gigi Morasco and her son can testify that we kidnapped them. That's two counts and my bet is they won't let the sentence run concurrently, so your son will be raising his own kids by the time you get out.",
        "Todd: They're not going to testify.",
        "Ramsey: No?",
        "[Ramsey chuckles]",
        "Ramsey: Now, if you know what's good for you, by this time tomorrow, your troubles will be over.",
        "Todd: Ramsey, I don't know why you can't get it through your head -- I'm not going to let you shoot a woman and her child.",
        "Ramsey: Oh, I'm not going to shoot them. You are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I've got a friend in Washington who said he'd let me know if Ramsey makes contact.",
        "Gigi: So Ramsey just left his job?",
        "John: He was suspended after the incident in Ireland.",
        "Shane: Mom?",
        "Gigi: What's up, Captain Danger?",
        "Shane: I'm hungry.",
        "John: You're hungry? You want a burger?",
        "Shane: Again?",
        "Gigi: That would be \"Thank you, John.\"",
        "John: Well, then burgers it is.",
        "Gigi: Could you do me a favor and take your soldiers and weapons of mass destruction over there?",
        "Shane: So you can talk?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, about ways to make your life miserable if you don't move it. Oh. Sorry about that. He needs to hit a playground and run around.",
        "John: I understand -- I was a kid, too.",
        "Gigi: So, you hear from Todd?",
        "John: Yeah, well, he hasn't quite got there yet, but I'm working on him.",
        "Gigi: You know, if he presses charges against Marcie, they'll want me to testify and I can't do that.",
        "John: If Manning doesn't drop the charges against Marcie, he'll be facing charges himself. The last thing he wants is another stint in prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Now, why would I shoot Gigi Morasco and her son? There's no way they're going to testify -- told you.",
        "Ramsey: Oh, I know what you told me. I also know who you are.",
        "Todd: You don't know a thing about me, Lee.",
        "Ramsey: Oh, yes, I do. You're lucky. With your rap sheet, you should be in prison. You've dodged more bullets, caught more breaks. Why should this time be any different?",
        "Todd: No, I'm not shooting anyone.",
        "Ramsey: Oh. Okay, well, then somebody's going to march Gigi and Shane into court and they will make their heartfelt confessions. And you will be convicted, and Marcie, the kidnapper, will get a slap on the wrist and you, the kidnapper, will rot in prison. Now, I am surprised -- I would've thought after your stint on death row you would've done anything to avoid getting back in the cage, but I guess I was wrong.",
        "Todd: Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Uh, oh -- okay. I ran into Morasco down in Texas. Uh -- she didn't expect to see me, I didn't expect to see her. We talked for a few minutes, I bought the ring, and that was it. She never mentioned that she had a son, and she would have. In fact, now that I remember, she -- she -- she mentioned this Shane and I -- and I flipped because we used to watch that movie together -- \"Shane\" -- and we talked about it? Anyway, she would've mentioned if she had a kid named after the cowboy in that movie.",
        "Adriana: That you used to watch together?",
        "Rex: Okay, I know where you're going with this and it's just not possible.",
        "Adriana: So, the 9-year-old with blond hair and the cute smile in John's apartment --",
        "Rex: She does not have a 9-year-old.",
        "Adriana: Why, because that means he would've been conceived 10 years ago when you were both dating in high school?",
        "Rex: If Gigi had a son, she would've told me.",
        "Adriana: Unless she didn't want you to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I have admitted that I was wrong, I've apologized. I stayed at St. Ann's for 48 hours! I was evaluated -- I'm fine!",
        "Nash: Glad to hear it.",
        "Jessica: Nash, why can't we just let this go, okay? You haven't spoken to me since I got home.",
        "Nash: I'm not the only one who's mad here.",
        "Jessica: You? You had me committed! Are you kidding me? I -- I -- I -- you're right. I don't blame you, I don't blame you, but, God!",
        "Nash: But?",
        "Jessica: I hate this!",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: Can't we just be okay?",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Thank you. I'm so sorry.",
        "Nash: I love you. The important thing is that it's over, right? No more risky business. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I am sorry about outing your sister, although I'm really not. She deserved it, but I am sorry I upset the family and upset you.",
        "Natalie: I'll survive.",
        "Jared: As for our bigger problem --",
        "Natalie: What, that you're my uncle?",
        "Jared: Natalie --",
        "Natalie: Please -- don't talk about it. It makes it so much worse. Um -- sorry, I should've knocked first.",
        "Jared: And we ran into each other outside.",
        "Natalie: Yeah -- he's here to see Nash.",
        "Jared: Apparently, Natalie and her sister have plans tonight.",
        "Nash: What plans?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- I would've told you but we weren't exactly speaking.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm, yeah -- now we are. What plans?",
        "Jessica: Um -- Natalie said something about going to see Mom?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jessica: Oh -- there she -- that must be her. Phone ringing, huh-huh. Yep. Mom?",
        "Allison: It's Allison. Are you going to break me out of this place tonight, or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Okay, you guys are making me hungry.",
        "[Addie chuckles]",
        "Miles: Oh, well, that's the best part. The entire class lets me eat everything they cook.",
        "Addie: They made Miles the official taster.",
        "Lindsay: I need to get a picture of the official taster and his chef.",
        "Addie: Oh, and the -- and the heart box.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, yeah.",
        "Addie: I just love the idea of these -- all these secrets.",
        "Lindsay: All right -- ready?",
        "Miles: To parmigiana!",
        "Addie: Parmigiana!",
        "Roxy: Oh, excuse me.",
        "[Shutter clicks]",
        "Miles: Ah --",
        "[Addie chuckles]",
        "Roxy: Oh, great. Is there anyone in this town who isn't after Miles Laurence?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Mom! Uh -- Natalie and I are -- are on the way.",
        "Allison: Natalie's coming, too? Excellent!",
        "Jessica: Well, don't start without us.",
        "Allison: No worries, sister.",
        "Jessica: Okay -- see you soon, Mom. Bye. Mom is getting a little impatient.",
        "Natalie: Well, we should go, then.",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "Nash: Oh, you're going out for dinner?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- no. We're helping her with her, uh -- uh, Valentine's Day thingy, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah -- the \"Go Red\" ball. She's hosting -- hostessing -- it.",
        "Jessica: Uh -- uh, yeah. Oh, well, not -- not me. I'm not hostessing it, but -- but Mom is and it's -- it's for the American Heart Association, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Hosted by Campbell's and we're going to throw in a lot of their heart-healthy products in the goody bags.",
        "Jessica: Yes, like Campbell's select soup and Prego spaghetti sauce and V8.",
        "Nash: V8?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Anyway, so we better get a move on it.",
        "Jared: Jessica? I just wanted to say I'm sorry about busting you.",
        "Jessica: I was playing with fire and I'm not going to do it again. Tess is history.",
        "Jared: So we're good?",
        "Natalie: Okay. Before you guys kiss and make up, can I just say if given the chance, I'm not so sure that Jared wouldn't do it again.",
        "Nash: No, it's all right. Jared and I have come to an agreement. He has agreed to sell us back 1% of our vineyard. We're going to be even -- 50/50.",
        "Natalie: You're kidding!",
        "Nash: No.",
        "Jared: That is why I'm here -- to bring over the paperwork.",
        "Jessica: Let me see those. That -- these are real.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Told you so.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my -- oh, my -- oh, my God. Jared, thank you. I -- I don't deserve this.",
        "Jared: But Nash does.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, you're right. He certainly does. I won't be late, okay?",
        "Nash: All right.",
        "Jessica: Okay. And -- and if Bree wakes up --",
        "Nash: I will pass her right on over to Jared. I'm not kidding -- we'll be fine. Mm-hmm.",
        "Jared: I didn't think I'd ever be saying this given what we've been through, but shall we crack open a bottle and toast to our partnership?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I -- I -- I can't believe that Jared sold Nash 1% of the vineyard.",
        "Natalie: He felt guilty.",
        "Jessica: Whew -- whatever. All I care about is the fact that he can't evict us anymore.",
        "Natalie: That was Allison on the phone?",
        "Jessica: Uh, yeah -- huh.",
        "Natalie: Okay, how are we going to pull this off?",
        "Jessica: You're going to love it.",
        "Natalie: Okay, yeah, right. Busting a known psychopath out of a loony bin -- sounds like a barrel of laughs.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, what she has to tell me is really, really important, okay? I -- I feel it in my gut.",
        "Natalie: Okay, all right. So, okay, we get her out, she tells this big secret and -- and then what?",
        "Jessica: We put her back in.",
        "Natalie: Whoa -- we're taking her back?",
        "Jessica: Natalie, we can't keep her. Huh.",
        "Natalie: Right, but the whole point is that she wants out. She doesn't want to go back in.",
        "Jessica: Yeah -- Natalie, if she acts up, I'll call Bo and -- and I'll take the heat, okay? Don't worry about it.",
        "Natalie: They could put you back inside.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, this is big. It's important. She said that she knew something about my father, okay? I have to figure it out.",
        "Natalie: Jessica, honestly, Mitch is dead -- what could possibly be so important? Not to mention, it's going to be hard enough to bust her out of St. Ann's, but to bring her back?",
        "Jessica: Don't forget I swiped the -- the all-access key.",
        "Natalie: Okay. So we get in and how exactly are we going to explain why we're there?",
        "Jessica: Well, the key isn't the only thing I swiped. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: So you're saying that you and this Gigi person never had sex?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Well, I didn't say that.",
        "Adriana: So did you have sex?",
        "Rex: It was 10 years ago!",
        "Adriana: Exactly, when Shane was conceived.",
        "Rex: Okay, uh -- are -- are -- you're -- you're sure he's -- he's 9 and not just a big 6?",
        "Adriana: Or a tiny 12? He's 9, Rex, and he's Gigi's.",
        "Rex: So you talked to her about this?",
        "Adriana: Like \"is that my fianc\u00e9's son?\" Yeah, I did.",
        "Rex: You just came right out and asked her?",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: What'd she say?",
        "Adriana: No.",
        "Rex: Well, there you go -- case closed.",
        "Adriana: You don't think it's possible that she could be lying?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Why would she lie?",
        "Adriana: Uh -- I don't know. You tell me, Rex -- son of Charlie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Shane: Is that the food?",
        "Gigi: Shh! Don't wake the neighbors.",
        "John: Who is it?",
        "Markko: Delivery.",
        "John: Hey. Hey, I didn't know you were working at the diner.",
        "Markko: Yeah, a couple of weeks now.",
        "John: All right.",
        "Markko: Hi.",
        "Shane and Gigi: Hi.",
        "Shane: You have our food?",
        "Markko: Right here. I was wondering how you were going to eat all this, Lieutenant.",
        "John: Yeah, well, now you know. Well, that's a little steep.",
        "Markko: Huh.",
        "John: Let's see what you brought.",
        "Markko: Yeah, that's the thing about this job -- you go to a lot of the same places, so when the order changes, you notice.",
        "John: Well, you'd make a good detective.",
        "Markko: You think? Huh. Yeah, like earlier, I had this delivery for Mr. Manning, but I didn't know it was for him at first because he usually orders from Dr. Lord's. And not to mention he always orders the same thing -- steak, and this was for grilled pork and platanos.",
        "John: Yeah, well, Manning must be experimenting.",
        "Markko: No, it wasn't for him. He had a friend there.",
        "John: You sure this was Todd Manning's place?",
        "Markko: Hmm, yeah. It had to be. There were all these pictures of Starr and Jack.",
        "John: This friend have a name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Ah, you changed your mind.",
        "Todd: Ramsey? Let's use our heads, shall we? Gigi Morasco and her child turn up dead, who are the police going to come looking for? Huh? You and me.",
        "Ramsey: If they --",
        "Todd: Ah. Let's not add to our workload, okay? So, put that way.",
        "Ramsey: Ah. If they testify, you're scrubbing latrines in Statesville.",
        "Todd: No, I'm not going to go to prison.",
        "Ramsey: Well, you'll be needing this.",
        "Todd: If I let Marcie walk, Gigi goes away.",
        "Ramsey: You sure about that?",
        "Todd: It's a risk I'm willing to take.",
        "[Ramsey cocks rifle]",
        "Todd: That's funny.",
        "Ramsey: You think so?",
        "[Trigger clicks]",
        "Todd: What the hell is your problem, Ramsey?",
        "Ramsey: Oh -- guess it's not loaded. Want to try?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Ramsey: Ah, it's easy. Yeah. Wouldn't want the neighbors to see.",
        "Ramsey: Amazing, isn't it -- power it gives you? You just squeeze the trigger and suddenly, someone halfway across town is no longer with us.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I love it --",
        "Ramsey: Huh.",
        "Todd: But we're not going to do it.",
        "Ramsey: And changing your targets is just as easy as changing your mind.",
        "Todd: No. That's Dorian's. You threatening my family now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You're a good man, Nash.",
        "Nash: Yes. It's true. But there's no point looking backwards, I just try to stay in the moment -- to the vineyard.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Jared: Mmm. That is good.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jared: You really do know what you're doing.",
        "Nash: When it comes to wine, yes, I do.",
        "Jared: Believe it or not, I really do know business.",
        "Nash: I'm counting on it.",
        "Jared: It's too bad Natalie and Jessica couldn't stay.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, apparently duty calls. Viki can be very persuasive.",
        "Jared: Ah -- so I hear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I can't believe you talked me into this.",
        "Jessica: Shh, shh, shh! We're nuns.",
        "Natalie: Okay, except we're not nuts, and if they catch us dressed like this, they're going to make us join up.",
        "Jessica: Well, they're not going to catch us because Allison's room is just down the hall, so we're going to grab her and get the hell out of here.",
        "Allison: Watch your mouth, Sister!",
        "Jessica: For God's sake!",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, you just gave me a heart attack, I think.",
        "Allison: Oh, nuns -- yes, well, a little predictable but it'll do.",
        "[Allison chuckles]",
        "Allison: Long time, no caper, huh, Nattie?",
        "Natalie: I'm doing this for my sister, Allison.",
        "Allison: Yeah, you keep polishing up that halo.",
        "Jessica: Okay, Allison, you could just save us a lot of time and tell us what you know about Mitch Laurence right now.",
        "Allison: No can do. I have to show you.",
        "Natalie: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Allison: It means we got to jet. Shall we? This way. I left my bag back here.",
        "Jessica: No, no -- no time. Come on.",
        "Natalie: Let's go.",
        "Nun: And just where do you think you're going?",

There's an office, empty office, in Angel Square on the fourth floor right across from the hotel. And you just pull the trigger and boom -- problem solved.
