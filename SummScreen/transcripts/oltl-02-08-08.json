        "Allison: Bye-bye, St. Ann's. Good riddance! I think we made it, you guys. Nobody's following us.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I'm making sure to stay off the main roads, you know? Make sure that no one stops us, just in case the whole sticking-the-pillow-in- the-bed routine fails.",
        "Jessica: It didn't work when I was a teenager.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, it worked on Roxy like a charm. Of course, maybe she never checked.",
        "Allison: Isn't this exciting? We're like Thelma and Louise -- and Louise -- if they were nuns helping a mental patient escape.",
        "Natalie: Oh.",
        "Allison: So, sisters, have you given any thought to how you're going to make me disappear? Because I'm not telling you my juicy secret until you give me your word.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- what word?",
        "Allison: That I am never going back to that God-awful dump of a loony bin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Oh --",
        "Ramsey: Oops. Call next time. Nobody likes surprises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, not now. I don't want to have this conversation here.",
        "Shane: You going to eat your fries, Mom?",
        "Gigi: No, go ahead.",
        "Rex: Is he my son?",
        "Blair: Okay. Sam, you are now asleep. Please stay asleep, okay? Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Mom?",
        "Blair: Hey. What are you doing up?",
        "Jack: I'm scared. I had a bad dream. And I thought it was real, even when I woke up.",
        "Blair: Well, what was wrong? Huh?",
        "Jack: I'm too big to get bad dreams, right?",
        "Blair: Well, I don't think you're too big to get bad dreams. I get bad dreams. We all get bad dreams.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Blair: Yeah. But you know, I think when you're, like, an adult, you figure out ways to, like, shake it off. Why don't you tell me what that bad dream was about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Amazing, isn't it? The power it gives you? You just squeeze a trigger, and suddenly, someone halfway across town is no longer with us.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I love it. But we're not going to do it.",
        "Ramsey: And changing your targets -- it's just as easy as changing your mind.",
        "Todd: No. That's Dorian's. Are you threatening my family now? What's going on in here?",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "Blair: Our little guy here woke up with a nightmare.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah?",
        "Blair: Kind of scared.",
        "Todd: What was it about?",
        "Jack: It was about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ramsey whistles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh -- oh, no, there is no way that we're going to help you disappear, Allison. And so no one can find you? No, no, as soon as this show and tell is over with, you're going straight back to St. Ann's, and I emphasize \"tell.\"",
        "Allison: Well, then maybe I'll take my own sweet time giving you the scoop.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Oh, really? Well, you know what? Maybe we'll just take you right back to St. Ann's and skip the scoop, because I don't think there is a scoop!",
        "Jessica: Natalie --",
        "Natalie: What? Did you hear what she was just saying?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I did, but maybe it's better if we all just stay calm.",
        "Natalie: Right, right, because we just, you know, kidnapped somebody from a mental institution, we should mellow out.",
        "Allison: It was a dreadful, stifling place, which is why, when I asked Jessica to get me out of there, it wasn't supposed to be for one measly night.",
        "Natalie: Whoa, whoa -- what did you tell her?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- nothing, I -- we just kept it vague.",
        "Natalie: \"Vague\" is not going to cut it, okay? We need to make it very clear that Allison is going right back to St. Ann's, tomorrow.",
        "Jessica: Well, Natalie, how fair is that? It's like taking a -- a kid to a toy store and then not letting her buy anything.",
        "Natalie: That's a bad analogy, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, what kind of deal is that? One night of freedom, huh?",
        "Allison: Yeah, sister Tessica is right.",
        "Natalie: Well, then sister Tessica can be on her own, okay? I helped with the escape, which I should not have done, but I did. But I am not -- you want to make Allison disappear, you're on your own.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, come on. Why don't we let her tell us her secret, and then she can do whatever she wants. She can go wherever she wants.",
        "Natalie: Ow! Ow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you're -- you're right. What was I thinking? I mean, who cares what Allison does? We'll just, you know -- as long as she doesn't mess with us.",
        "Allison: After I tell you what I know, I won't ever mess with you again.",
        "[Allison snickers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Oh. Oh. Well -- let the games begin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, I'm -- I'm not going to talk about that here.",
        "Rex: Let's go somewhere else.",
        "Gigi: What? And leave my kid alone?",
        "Rex: We can go upstairs -- to the roof. It's 30 seconds away. Morasco, we're going to get this straightened out. Either we can do it here, or we can go somewhere else. You choose.",
        "Shane: Hey, Mister, I know you.",
        "Rex: Uh -- actually, yeah, we other in Texas. How's it going?",
        "Shane: Fine. Except I'm not there anymore.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I noticed.",
        "Shane: Weird.",
        "Rex: Weird, what?",
        "Shane: When I asked my mom about who you were, she said \"nobody.\" So I thought she didn't know you.",
        "Gigi: Shane --",
        "Rex: Actually, she may not have realized it at the time, because we haven't seen each other in quite a while. But as it turns out, I'm an old friend of your mom's.",
        "Shane: Oh. Like that lady that was here before? She didn't know my dad, but maybe you do.",
        "Gigi: Shane, I think --",
        "Rex: Who's your dad?",
        "Shane: If you knew him, you'd remember. He was a Navy Seal.",
        "Rex: \"Was\"?",
        "Shane: Yeah. He died saving people.",
        "Rex: Oh. Sorry.",
        "Shane: It's okay. I'm going to go watch TV, okay, Mom?",
        "Gigi: Sure.",
        "Rex: His father is dead?",
        "Gigi: Didn't he just say that?",
        "Rex: Navy Seal? A real hero.",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm. He -- he was. Shane was very proud of him.",
        "Rex: That's a great story, Gigi. Is it true?",
        "Gigi: I don't lie to my son. Now go back to your fianc\u00e9e.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What was I doing in this dream?",
        "Jack: Well, you weren't yourself. You were like this bad guy, and it was all mixed up. It didn't make sense. And I feel better now.",
        "Blair: Uh -- Jack, sweetie, you think you're going to be able to go back to bed?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I guess. And now, since I'm a big brother and I'm Sam's nightmare chaser, you think maybe he can sleep with his light on?",
        "Blair: I think maybe he can. It's probably a very good idea. In fact, maybe you should sleep with your light on, too.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Jack: But don't tell Starr. She'll think I'm a baby.",
        "Blair: She's not going to think that you are a baby. She has bad dreams, too, Jack.",
        "Jack: Mom, please.",
        "Blair: Okay. I won't tell.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it's our secret. Hey.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Todd: Come on back here. I think maybe you better tell me more about this dream. Sit here. So, I was a bad guy, eh? And what did I do exactly?",
        "Jack: Nothing, it was all mixed up, like I said.",
        "Todd: Are you afraid that it might upset you to tell me?",
        "Jack: No, I guess not. You gave me away to some zombies, like the ones in \"Night of the Living Dead.\"",
        "Blair: \"Night of the Living Dead\"? You saw that movie?",
        "Jack: Starr let me borrow it one night.",
        "Blair: Oh, great.",
        "Jack: They had a spaceship. And the worst part is when they threw me in it, Mom was crying, but you just stood there and watched. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. And when the door shut -- well, that's when I woke up.",
        "Todd: Well, that's a pretty nasty dream, isn't it? But of course, that's all it is, is a dream, right? Because you know that I love you and I would never do anything like that to you.",
        "Jack: But you already did.",
        "Blair: Jack, you're talking about your dream, right? In the dream, Dad gave you away?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's it.",
        "Todd: Hey, I'm wondering if this has something to do with something outside the dream. Did you -- did you hear something about me?",
        "Jack: Kids at school were teasing me, saying that their parents saw something on the news about you.",
        "Blair: Well, why didn't you say something when you walked in the door today from school?",
        "Jack: Because I thought they were lying. And I told them that they were wrong, that my dad would never do anything like that to me.",
        "Todd: And what did they say?",
        "Jack: When I was a baby, a little older than Sam, you gave me away -- to some nuns in Mexico in an airport. And you told Mom that I was dead.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? They had no right to say that to you, Jack.",
        "Todd: Blair --",
        "Blair: They were just trying to hurt you, all right?",
        "Todd: Honey -- sweetheart -- what those kids told you -- it's true. I did what they said I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, so let me get this straight, Morasco. After me, you hooked up with some Navy Seal and --",
        "Gigi: Shh.",
        "Rex: He can't hear us.",
        "Gigi: Are you kidding? His ears have poles on them. Ugh. Look, maybe we should go somewhere else to talk about this. Honey, come here. I'm going to go right upstairs, just for a few minutes.",
        "Shane: How come?",
        "Gigi: Rex and I need to talk, that's all. And it'll be nice to get some air.",
        "Shane: And you're afraid I'll hear? What's up with that?",
        "Gigi: Well, honey, it's grown-up stuff, okay? Um -- I'll be really close by if you need me. Just lock the door --",
        "Shane: Mom, I'm not a baby.",
        "Gigi: I know.",
        "Rex: Hey, you know, I usually keep these on hand for parking meters, but you can use them to play John's slot machine.",
        "Shane: Sweet. Can I, Mom?",
        "Gigi: I don't know.",
        "Shane: Please? John didn't say I couldn't.",
        "Gigi: I don't know where he went. I don't feel right calling to ask him about it.",
        "Rex: Look, I know John. He wouldn't mind if you played with the slots. Well, what else is it there for?",
        "Shane: Yeah, Mom.",
        "Gigi: Okay, whatever, fine. Let's go, Rex. And remember, don't open --",
        "Shane: I know! Don't open the door.",
        "Rex: What's going on? You'd think you were leaving the country.",
        "Gigi: I'm a mom. I worry about my kid, okay?",
        "Rex: Yeah, no kidding.",
        "Gigi: But I shouldn't, really. Not with John looking after us. I have nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: Okay. I'm about to fill you girls in on a big secret. So the least you can do to show your gratitude is crank up the tunes. And none of that old Lawrence Welk stuff they play at St. Ann's. I want to hear Barry White. Ha, ha! Got any of his CDs?",
        "Jessica: Not in the car.",
        "Allison: Oh -- oh, and that song \"Alison\" by Elvis Presley.",
        "Natalie: It's Costello.",
        "Allison: What about Costello?",
        "Jessica: Elvis.",
        "Allison: What about Elvis?",
        "Natalie: No, Elvis Costello sang the song \"Alison.\"",
        "Allison: Well, how am I supposed to know that? I mean, those nuns are always misinforming us -- another reason why I need to get out of that dreadful institution.",
        "Natalie: What, so you can know your Elvises?",
        "Allison: Hey, I lost touch with everything in that wretched place. Which is why, in exchange for my information, you both are going to get me a new identity and help me disappear.",
        "Jessica: Allison, after you tell us the secret, you can do whatever you want. You can go to a whole new country. You can change your name. Just as long as you are nowhere near us or our family.",
        "Natalie: Here's a really cool idea. How about when you get wherever it is you're going, you snatch up a couple of infants, switch them, and then make their lives miserable?",
        "Allison: Oh, sure, make your lame jokes at my expense, but I fixed that, didn't I? You got to be a Buchanan.",
        "Natalie: Oh, yeah, you're a real saint. You know, except for that minor lapse when you had our mom put in a box and almost killed. But wait, no -- you did manage to get Ben killed. Just another minor lapse from sainthood.",
        "Allison: Hey, that was Antonio's fault. You know, the guy Tessica cheated on.",
        "Jessica: Hey! How'd you know about that?",
        "Allison: It was in all the gossip columns. The nuns were yakking it up. They deny they read those tabloids, but they eat them up, believe me.",
        "Jessica: Okay -- enough, Allison, enough. As soon as you tell us the secret, we will let you go.",
        "Allison: What if you don't? What if you're playing me, and Bo Buchanan is somewhere around here waiting for us? You two are both sneaky enough to get me out of St. Ann's. What if you're going to try and pull some of that sneaky business on me now, huh? Why should I trust either one of you?",
        "Natalie: Because if you don't, all bets are off, and we take you straight back to St. Ann's right this minute. So it's your choice, nutso.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, Todd, I really don't think that this is a very good idea to talk about this now.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Come on, buddy, let's get you back to bed.",
        "Todd: No, not yet.",
        "Blair: Todd --",
        "Todd: I think he's old enough to know the truth.",
        "Jack: What truth?",
        "Todd: The truth is that -- well, these kids were -- well, like your mom said, they were being mean to you and they were trying to hurt you, but what they said was true. I really did --",
        "Jack: You mean you really did give me away?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I lied to your mom. And I told her you were dead. It was one of the worst things I've ever done in my life. I hurt your mom real bad, and I almost lost you. And when I think about what I did, I -- it's been very difficult to forgive myself for it. Much less, ask your mom to forgive me. And now, you. And of course, I know that saying \"I'm sorry\" is -- is not nearly enough. But -- and you know, the thing that makes me the most sad is that I -- I missed out on such a big part of your life.",
        "Jack: Like Sam, you mean?",
        "Todd: Right, like Sam.",
        "Jack: But only with me, you did on purpose.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's right. And I was very lucky to get you back.",
        "Jack: From who?",
        "Todd: From the people that you ended up with -- who loved you dearly and took very good care of you.",
        "Jack: I can't remember them.",
        "Blair: Well, of course you don't remember, because you were just a little bitty baby. But the good thing about it is that Dad did bring you back, and we love you so very much. You're so precious to us, and you always will be.",
        "Jack: But why did Dad give me away in the first place? Was there something wrong with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: What's he doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: This one's going to win, this one's going to win, this one's going win, this one's going to win. This one is going to win.",
        "Shane: Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes! I did it!",
        "[Bell rings]",
        "[Coins drop]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, honey, there was nothing wrong with you. You were perfect. You were perfect then, you're perfect now. My giving you away had nothing to do with you whatsoever. It was all me. It was my problem. I was messed up. See, what happened was I was under the impression that I was not your father.",
        "Jack: Why didn't you think that you were my dad?",
        "Todd: Oh -- well -- it doesn't matter why. I was -- I was a little messed up in the head in those days -- as your mother can attest.",
        "Jack: But you knew Mom was my mother, and you still gave me away, anyways?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'm not going to make any excuses. There are none. And I can't tell you how sorry I am about it. But I will tell you this. When I came to my senses, I searched the globe. I searched far and wide for you until found you.",
        "Blair: And when he found you, he brought you back to us. And I was so happy -- we were both so happy, you know what we did? We squeezed you tight, we held you all the time. We never let you go. We just kind of set you there and -- and stared at you. You're so precious to us, buddy.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, we love you more than anything else in the world. You know that, huh?",
        "Jack: Yeah. But before, you said --",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Jack: You said that you went a little crazy. And what if you go crazy again and give me away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You know, Balsom, you have some nerve showing up at this hour just because your fianc\u00e9e has a million questions about my son and me.",
        "Rex: Actually, just one question, Gigi, and kind of an important one.",
        "Gigi: Like it couldn't wait? You had to force me up onto the roof in the middle of winter where it's freakin' freezing?",
        "Rex: Here, take my coat. Okay. Can we talk now?",
        "Gigi: I've already told you what you need to know.",
        "Rex: Yeah, it would be what I need to know if I thought it was the truth.",
        "Gigi: I can't control what you think. You've got doubts, you'll just have to live with them.",
        "Rex: How can you say that? Do you think that I could stand that? Wondering for the rest of my life if that little boy is mine?",
        "Gigi: Would it be so terrible if he was?",
        "Rex: I -- I didn't say that.",
        "Gigi: That's how you're acting! Like it'd be some kind of nightmare if it turned out he was your kid! Like it'd screw up your life with what's-her-name. Well, let me tell you something, Rex Balsom -- you will never know a smarter, sweeter little boy than Shane. He is my pride and joy, the best thing that ever happened to me, and you would be damn lucky to be his father",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, buddy, I've known your daddy a long time and I know that he would never, ever do anything like that again, okay? And when he gave you away, he really wasn't doing that to hurt you -- even though he knew it might upset me. He thought he was giving you away to somebody that -- that loved you and cared for you. Otherwise, he never would've done that -- you understand? -- Because he loves you and he would never, ever hurt a child -- not you, not Sam, not Starr. Not any child, okay?",
        "Ramsey's voice: The Morascos are going away, Todd. You don't do it, I will. And if you try to stop me -- I think you have an idea what might happen.",
        "Todd: Oh, my God, no.",
        "Blair: Todd? What -- what's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Oh, my God. How did she forget to bring that with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, I didn't say that -- that it would be such a terrible thing if I -- if I turned out to be Shane's -- father. He's a really cute kid.",
        "Gigi: He's more than cute -- he's smart as hell. He talked in full sentences before he was 2, he knew the makes and models of all his little toy cars when he was 3 -- every single one of them.",
        "Rex: That's great, I'm impressed.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, Shane's father would be very proud of him.",
        "Rex: The Navy Seal.",
        "Gigi: Why do you say it like that?",
        "Rex: It just seems a little far-fetched. I mean, how would you meet a Navy guy in Michigan?",
        "Gigi: What kind of question is that? Have a little respect for the dead, Balsom.",
        "Rex: Yeah -- sure. Should we head back downstairs, huh?",
        "Gigi: Are you coming or not?",
        "Rex: Morasco, there's just one more thing that I don't understand. If -- if Shane was somebody else's kid, why would you want to keep it from me?",
        "Gigi: Why would you need to know? Like it's any of your damn business!",
        "Rex: You see, that's another thing that doesn't add up.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Rex: This attitude you have towards me and not just now, but every time you see me, you've got this look in your eye like you want to strangle me.",
        "Gigi: I didn't know it was so obvious.",
        "Rex: Could you not be sarcastic?",
        "Gigi: Could you not be totally dense? How the hell do you think I feel about you? I was your girlfriend, Rex, and you just skipped town without a letter or a phone call. You got what you wanted! You slept with me and -- and pretended you loved me.",
        "Rex: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. \"Pretended\" to love you? My memory is that we were just having fun, fooling around. We were kids, it was a fling.",
        "Gigi: Not to me, it wasn't.",

        "Natalie: So what's it going to be, big Al? You going to go back to St. Ann's and hang out with the strict sisters who will probably be keeping a pretty close eye on you from here on out more so than before, or you want to stay with the laid-back, fun-loving sisters here in this car?",
        "Allison: Hmm -- okay, okay. I guess I don't have much choice but to take you at your word.",
        "Jessica: Well, Allison, I will personally make sure that you don't get dragged back to St. Ann's -- at least not right away.",
        "Allison: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Jessica: Well, I mean, I will give you the cash to help you get away, but, you know, evading the authorities after that is kind of up to you.",
        "Allison: Or perhaps you'll see the light and help me become a totally different person with a whole new history.",
        "Natalie: And what's going to make us see the light, Allison -- a lobotomy, perhaps?",
        "Allison: Oh, yeah, make your jokes. But once you hear what I have to tell you and see what I have to show you, you will be grateful, happy, and indebted.",
        "Natalie: Maybe like bored stiff. Yeah, I have a funny feeling this secret's going to be very anticlimactic with the way you've been building it up.",
        "Allison: No, you'll see, o skeptical one.",
        "Jessica: Okay, Allison. You want to do show and tell -- where should we go?",
        "Allison: [In witch's voice] Homeward bound, my pretties -- straight to Llanfair.",

        "Jessica: Are you insane?",
        "Natalie: You're just now figuring that out, huh?",
        "Jessica: There is no way we are letting you near Llanfair or near our mother.",
        "Allison: Oh, now, dear girls, I'm harmless. I have no intention of hurting Viki or of even seeing her, for that matter, because I know she wouldn't approve of our little outing. I mean, I may be crazy but I'm not stupid.",
        "Natalie: Good, then you're smart enough to know we are not taking you to our home.",
        "Allison: Well, then my secret will be meaningless because you will have no proof of its veracity.",
        "Jessica: The proof of this secret is in my mother's house?",
        "Allison: No, not in the house, but close to your home and family --",

        "Allison: Very close.",

        "Todd: No, I'm not okay. I -- I -- I don't like what I did to Jack and I certainly don't like talking about it again. But you know, honey, I promise that I'm going to try to make it up to you in every way I can for the rest of your life.",
        "Jack: It's okay, Dad, you don't have to. And I -- and I know you won't do anything like that to me ever again.",
        "Todd: No, no, I won't. Uh -- I have to go to the newspaper.",
        "Blair: Why? Can't it wait till tomorrow?",
        "Todd: Well, no, I -- I let something get by me this afternoon and I want to make sure it -- it doesn't go through. But I'll be back as soon as I can and -- and if you're asleep, then I -- wait until the morning and you and I will do something extra special, okay?",
        "Jack: Yep.",
        "Todd: See ya.",

        "Blair: I'm glad, because I love you. Um -- I just wanted to tell you that -- that I'm proud of you. I am, Todd, and not just for telling Jack, you know, the truth about all of that past, but also earlier today when Nora was here when you said you were going to go easy on Marcie. I'm just proud of you.",

        "Gigi: \"Playing around\" -- right.",
        "Rex: You made fun of all the kids who talked about -- about marriage and babies, when they were just babies themselves, still in high school. What was all that?",
        "Gigi: Me protecting myself in case -- you did what you did, so you'd never know.",
        "Rex: Know what?",

        "Rex: I -- I just -- I -- I didn't think, okay? I figured -- I figured that we were together because we liked each other. I -- I -- I thought that, you know, everything between us was about fun.",
