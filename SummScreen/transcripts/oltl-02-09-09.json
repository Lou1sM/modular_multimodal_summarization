        "Rex and Gigi are on the hunt for Dorian and David and search all places in Vegas where there are weddings. They don't find them but run into Moe and Noelle. They witness their wedding and Moe and Noelle are officially hitched. Dorian and David are elsewhere and taking their time about tying the knot. It looks like David wants to go through with it but it hasn't happened yet. Behind the scenes, there is a mysterious show girl named Gigi who spies upon Rex and his Gigi. She tells her agent she needs to leave town and plans to work in Llanview, PA. Lola demands that Tea tells her what Vanessa's big secret is and why she (Tea) is talking to Lola's father. Lola admits to her that she believes that Vanessa murdered Lola's mother and set Ray Montez up for the crime. And she intends to prove that with Lola's help. Cristian and Vanessa are getting closer and he still seems to trust her. Blair and Marty argue. Blair makes it clear that she resents John's preoccupation about needing to help Marty."

        "Cristian: What's wrong?",
        "Vanessa: I tried to call Lola again.",
        "Cristian: I told you, she's probably asleep.",
        "Vanessa: She turned her cell phone off. It went directly to voicemail. Do you know any teenager girl who does that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I was just about to call you.",
        "Lola: So you could get me to talk? Don't bother. I heard you. Who were you talking to, and what is it that you want me to say?",

        "David: Namaste.",

        "Rex: Stop the wedding! Moe?",
        "Moe: Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Noelle?",
        "Noelle: Rex?",
        "Rex: James Brown?",
        "James Brown: Which one of the funk brothers would you be?",
        "Rex: What the hell is going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: This is it. We're really going to do it this time. You're finally going to be Mrs. David Vickeroshi. Let's chant.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God. So this is really happening? You guys are really getting married?",
        "Rex: Married? These two? Ha. They couldn't agree on the weather let alone a date. Although, I've got to hand it to you. The ring is a gem. Where'd you get it, out of a bubble gum dispenser?",
        "Gigi: Rex.",
        "Rex: Don't you see what's going on here, Gigi? This whole thing is a scam. Dorian hired Moe and Noelle to send us on a wild goose chase. And while they're here faking it, David and Dorian are getting married somewhere for real.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lama Bill: Oops. I forgot my prayer beads. I'll be right back.",
        "David: I'm sorry about this. I know this isn't exactly the wedding of your dreams.",
        "Dorian: As long as I'm marrying the man of my dreams, what does it matter if the ceremony is in the Temple of Tranquility or the grand ballroom at the Palace Hotel?",
        "David: I got to hand it to you. To be honest, I didn't think you had it in you.",
        "Dorian: To marry you?",
        "David: To give up all your money.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that.",
        "David: The choice was easy for me. You know how I used to love a gourmet meal or a bespoke suit. But I could never afford them on my own. So to long for them was a dead end. The life of the soul, the life of poverty made sense for me. But for you, you have it all. And to give that up to marry me, to join me in the gutter -- priceless.",
        "Dorian: Your life is my life.",
        "David: I know. You keep saying it. I'm actually starting to believe it.",
        "Dorian: You better believe it. We're about to get married.",
        "David: Dorian, it means so much to me that you would want what I have to offer. Not that I'm knocking it. You haven't lived until you've fasted for 10 days, and then tasted your first teaspoon full of yak butter. It's been a lonely life. I've missed you. I've missed us. We're fun.",
        "Dorian: We're about as fun as it gets, David.",
        "David: Dorian, will you marry me? I know you've already asked me, and I've accepted, but I thought I'd return the favor.",
        "Dorian: Yes, David. I will be happy to marry you.",
        "David: And yes, we'll be penniless. But we'll have the sun in the morning and the moon at night. And in the winter, there's this wonderful little ashram in the Bahamas where they let you eat for free if you do the dishes.",
        "Dorian: You wash, I'll dry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: So you were listening to my conversation?",
        "Lola: I didn't mean to, but you were on the phone and I heard what you said.",
        "T\u00e9a: I forgive you. And I understand that sometimes --",
        "Lola: Vanessa told me not to trust you. She was right.",
        "T\u00e9a: I was talking to your father. The truth is Ray is my client.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Look, I wouldn't worry about Lola. She just needs a little space.",
        "Vanessa: I feel like I've driven her away.",
        "Cristian: She's a teenager. She's going to want to call some of the shots in her own life.",
        "Vanessa: Do you think I've been too strict with her?",
        "Cristian: You worry about her. With good reason. And it's going to take a little while for the two of you to be able to relax.",
        "Vanessa: You're right. I don't hear from her for a little while and I think that something terrible has happened. But Ray's in prison.",
        "Cristian: She's probably online chatting with her friends right now. Look, she just needs a little time on her own. And so do we if we're going to convince those I.C.E. agents over there that we're a happily married couple.",
        "Vanessa: Where --",
        "Cristian: Don't. Don't look. It's better if they don't think we're onto them.",
        "Vanessa: How do you know they're I.C.E. agents?",
        "Cristian: Well, because it looks like they're drinking club soda and they're trying to act like they're not watching us.",
        "Vanessa: What should we do?",
        "Cristian: Let's give them something to watch.",

        "Wes: Son of a --",
        "John: Yeah. Surprised me, too. What do you think Marty would make of it?",

        "Marty: Blair? Blair, thank God. Come here, let me help you. Over here. Come over here. Over here. Come here. Grab my hand. You're going to freeze to death. Grab my hand, come on. I'm going to get you out of there.",
        "[Marty screams]",
        "Marty: You did that on purpose.",
        "Blair: You pushed me overboard.",
        "Marty: I did not. You came at me. All I did was move out of the way.",
        "Blair: When have you ever moved out of my way, Marty? You've been up in my face and up in my business as long as I can remember.",
        "Marty: Oh, that's not my fault.",
        "Blair: Oh, it never is, is it? Never is. And everybody else has to live to regret it.",
        "Marty: That's nice.",
        "Blair: Tell you what. You just stay away from John and me, okay?",
        "Marty: Anything else?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Get up before you catch pneumonia. I don't want all the men in this town to have to go get you an oxygen tank. Come on.",

        "Wes: You checking up on me?",
        "John: I have to run background checks on all employees.",
        "Wes: Yeah, I don't see anyone else's report on the screen.",
        "John: They all passed.",
        "Wes: I'm a decorated veteran.",
        "John: Why'd you lie about knowing Lee Halpern?",
        "Wes: I didn't lie. I just didn't think it was any of your business.",
        "John: Yeah? I'm responsible for anyone who walks through that door.",
        "Wes: I'm not a threat to anybody.",
        "John: What about Lee Halpern? Were you a threat to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: Dorian's marrying David?",
        "Rex: Like you don't know.",
        "Moe: First I've heard of it. I thought he was some kind of monk.",
        "Rex: Give it a rest, Moe. You're all in on it. You, Noelle, and that Swedish butler.",
        "Noelle: You talked to Sven?",
        "Rex: And he told me that David and Dorian were going to Las Vegas to get married.",
        "Moe: I hate to break it to you, scooter, but the only English that boy knows is on the label of a can of Swedish meatballs.",
        "Noelle: Yeah, or a package of lutefisk. Have you ever eaten that?",
        "Moe: If he understood anything at all, he probably thought you were talking about me and Noelle.",
        "Gigi: Well, uh -- so, James Brown?",
        "Noelle: Well, this was the first chapel we saw. Moe was a little hesitant to be honest. He's more of a Zydeco fan, but at this point, I'd get married in a convenient store.",
        "Gigi: Why? What's the rush?",
        "Noelle: Delphina, the psychic.",
        "Gigi: Been there, done that.",
        "Noelle: Well she told me that Moe and me were cursed. That money was going to come between us. Now I didn't believe her, but then Dorian handed us her house. I got scared, and --",
        "Gigi: Hold the phone. Dorian handed you her house?",
        "Noelle: Yeah, when she turned Buddhist. So anyway, Moe and I decided to get hitched ASAP",
        "Rex: I blew it. The money trail we followed was Moe using one of Dorian's credit cards.",
        "Gigi: I thought you said there was a local P.I. following David and Dorian.",
        "Rex: I just called him. They managed to ditch him. I'm sorry, Morasco. I know I promised you that hundred grand from Clint, but we can kiss the bonus goodbye. Because if I know Dorian, she's marrying David right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What's keeping him so long?",
        "David: You practice patience, my eternal flame, while I go look for the Lama.",
        "[Dorian strains]",
        "Dorian: Oh, now I know why the good Lord invented chairs.",
        "Dorian: I'm just doing what needs to be done. Clint Buchanan stole the Buchanan fortune from me when I had won it fair and square. So I'm stealing it back. That's karma where I come from. The only reason I'm marrying David Vickeroshi is because he is the one and only true heir to the Buchanan fortune. I'm lying. I crave money. I crave power. I crave stature. But I also crave David. I adore him. I just do. And if he finds out what I've done, he's going to hate me. He'll leave me. Well then, so be it. I've lived without him before. And I will live without him again.",
        "David: Perhaps we should call this whole thing off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Stan, you scared the life out of me.",
        "Stanley: What the hell you doing out here? You just missed cherry pie. Nomi had to go on in your place.",
        "Stacy: Nomi's been angling for my spot since I've been here. Finally, she has a shot.",
        "Stanley: Baby, Nomi's no you. That's your number.",
        "Stacy: Stan, I've got bigger fish to fry.",
        "Stanley: Wha\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: Delphina was right. This is what she was talking about, that money would come between me and Moe. I thought it was the house and the furniture and the clothes. But no, it was you and Rex and this hundred thousand dollars. You stopped our wedding.",
        "Moe: And I want to know why.",
        "Rex: It's a long story.",
        "Moe: Well now that you've ruined our wedding, we've got all night.",
        "Noelle: No, no, they didn't ruin anything. Now that they're here, you can help us celebrate.",
        "Gigi: We'd love to.",
        "Rex: Only we're on a case.",
        "Gigi: What case? You said it yourself, we blew it.",
        "Noelle: Can't you at least stand up for us? It would mean so much for us to have real friends as witnesses. Otherwise it's an additional $60 for the Cher and Liberace look-alikes.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I should really find David and Dorian.",
        "Gigi: And what? Congratulate the happy couple?",
        "Moe: You're going to walk out after you barged in and embarrassed my bride? I don't think so. If my fianc\u00e9e wants you in the wedding, you're in the wedding.",
        "Rex: But --",
        "Gigi: It'll take five minutes.",
        "Rex: We'd be honored.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You're leaving me at the altar again?",
        "David: No. Are you?",
        "Dorian: A woman's thoughts prior to saying her sacred wedding vows are private.",
        "David: Especially if she's getting cold feet.",
        "Dorian: Oh, my feet are quite toasty, thank you. What you overheard was merely --",
        "David: Dorian. Dorian, you don't have to explain. I understand.",
        "Dorian: You do?",
        "David: I do. I hurt you. Or I should say David Vickers hurt you. I made you love me. I made you long for me. And then I dumped you.",
        "Dorian: Let's not go there.",
        "David: No. I dumped you. I humiliated you. I made you look ridiculous. People were pointing at you and they were laughing.",
        "Dorian: Stop. That's enough.",
        "David: And you're afraid that I will do that again. But I won't, my ruby- throated hummingbird. Because I'm different. I'm a changed man. I'm not the same man that left you in a puddle in a pew. I'm new. I don't want your money. I want the here and now. I only want you, Dorian. And if you can see me for the man that I am now, not a Vickers or a Truman, not even a wannabe Buchanan, but a full-fledged Vickeroshi, then I'm yours. If you'll have me.",
        "Dorian: David, with all my heart.",

        "T\u00e9a: He hired me about a year ago.",
        "Lola: So all this time when you were supposed to be Vanessa's lawyer --",
        "T\u00e9a: I was helping you. Your father wanted you in a stable environment, okay?",
        "Lola: Then he shouldn't have murdered my mother. He ruined my life.",
        "T\u00e9a: Lola, I don't believe your father murdered your mother. And I don't think you do either. That's why I got him to write that letter. I wanted to see how you felt about him.",
        "Lola: He's my father. Do you think I want to believe he's a murderer?",
        "T\u00e9a: So there's part of you that doesn't believe that. Lola, your father and I -- we think that Vanessa murdered your mother.",
        "Lola: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: And we need your help to prove it.",

        "John: Don't get defensive, Wes.",
        "Wes: Well, you accused me of murder.",
        "John: I didn't accuse you of anything. I was just looking at a file.",
        "Wes: What went on with me and Lee Halpern is none of your business. Besides, they got their killer. That lawyer confessed. It's in the paper.",
        "John: Do you believe everything you read?",
        "Wes: Why not? You do.",

        "Marty: Make it two.",
        "Wes: So what happened?",
        "Blair: She threw me in the river.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God, that's not true. You want to know what happened? She went after me, fell in. When I went to rescue her, she pulled me in after her. God. Milk, no sugar.",
        "John: I know how you like it.",
        "Blair: Wow, some things never change.",
        "Marty: Oh, give it a rest.",
        "Blair: Really. Can we, Marty, really?",
        "Marty: You tell me, you're the one following me in the dark, God know why. Do me a favor. Leave me out of this little love nest thing you got going.",

        "T\u00e9a: Why would your father kill your mother? They loved each other, Lola.",
        "Lola: They said it in court, that my mother cheated on my father and that he stabbed her because he was angry.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hm. Do you believe that your mother cheated on your father? They never proved anything in court.",
        "Lola: So what happened?",
        "T\u00e9a: I think Vanessa knew that your father was a wealthy man. I think she murdered your mother to get her out of the way. She seduced your father and then she married him. She would have got away with it. That would have it, but then you found the knife. So she had to do something. I think Vanessa used you to frame your father for the murder that she committed. Listen, I know that you were very young back then, but do you think it's possible that Vanessa influenced your testimony?",
        "Lola: I don't know what you mean.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I am not trying to blame you, sweetheart. I just want to help your father. Is there something from that night that you remember, something you haven't told me?",

        "Gigi: That was a beautiful ceremony. Nutty but beautiful.",
        "Rex: Yeah, just think how much ceremony $100,000 would have bought.",
        "Gigi: We were not going to spend $100,000 on getting married. We could have bought the house.",
        "Rex: Well, it's not going to buy us squat, because we don't have it. I let David and Dorian get away.",
        "Gigi: So what? I mean it. Noelle and Delphina are right. Too much money can mess up your life. And ours is pretty good these days.",
        "Rex: You're right. We're pretty lucky.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I know I promised you a desert island, but you have to let me take you to Tibet first. We'll trek to Chomolangma where I experienced my reawakening. It was there where I stood naked on top of the world and vowed to walk the path of enlightenment.",
        "Dorian: As enticing as that may sound, I'm afraid that our pilgrimage may have to be delayed for a while.",

        "Lola: After Vanessa married my father, she wanted to renovate the house.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'll bet she did.",
        "Lola: She started with the playroom since I'd gotten too old and, you know, she made me help her. She went through all my old toys and books. And then she found this old jewelry box from when I was a little girl. She said to open it just in case I wanted something to give to my daughter someday. And I did. There was the knife.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you did find the knife.",
        "Lola: Only because she made me open it. It was like she wanted me to open it. She knew there was something there, something for me to find. But if Vanessa killed my mother, then how did she get my father's prints on the knife?",
        "T\u00e9a: A smart woman knows how to make that happen.",

        "Blair: This is my fault?",
        "John: No, no, that's not what I'm saying. You misunderstood.",
        "Blair: Right. You know, John, it's one thing to tell Marty that you'd be there for her as a friend, but it's another thing to dismiss me as even a factor in it all.",
        "John: No, no, I could see -- could see that she was in trouble and I was just trying to tell her not to worry --",
        "Blair: Well, she should worry. And so should you. You know, I -- I put right on the top of my list, right there beneath my kids. I think about you before I do anything. I guess that makes me a fool.",
        "John: You're not a fool. I think about you, too.",
        "Blair: Except when Marty's around. And that seems to be all the time.",
        "John: She was in a bad place.",

        "John: Fine, be angry. Come on.",
        "Blair: I'm not angry. I'm cold, I'm wet, and I just want to go home. You know what? If you want to find me, you can come get me up tomorrow. And if I don't see you, just have a nice life, John.",

        "Gigi: You turn me on, Balsom. And I guess I was sort of thinking out loud.",
        "Rex: Well, whatever you want, you know that.",
        "Gigi: I love you. I've loved you since high school. And I know that sounds corny, but the fact that I found you after all these years, and we're together, I just feel so lucky.",

        "Dorian: I wouldn't dream of giving all of that up. It's just -- it may have to be delayed. You see, I made a commitment to your best friend, Victoria Davidson, to co-chair the \"Go Red Ball\" with her. I certainly can't go back on that. I mean, she might have another heart attack.",
        "David: The \"Go Red Ball.\" I seem to remember something bad happened there last year.",
