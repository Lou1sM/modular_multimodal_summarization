        "Stacy is ready to give birth to her baby for real. And Gigi delivers it for her. At that point, it appears the two sisters might have reconciled their differences at least for now. But right then, it appears that there is something wrong with t the baby and they cannot get her medical care while stranded up in the cabin. Meanwhile, after Rex finds out that Stacy scammed that she was pregnant with his child when she knew it would have to be Schuyler's, Rex is ready to kill Schuyler for what he did. He admits he's glad to be able to wash his hands of Stacy and declares he wants to get Gigi back, assuming he can after she finds out what Schuyler did and that he (himself) did not impregnate her sister. Oliver is also worried about Stacy along with Schuyler although he does not tell either him or Rex the reason why. Charlie goes to shoot Mitch but the bullet accidentally hits Jessica. Everybody back in Llanview is still wondering what to do with all of the missing people on Llantano Mountain."

        "Marty: What? Did something happen?",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Clint: Yes, Oliver Fish called me and, uh, he found Jessica. And Brody was already with her.",
        "Marty: Oh, that's fantastic!",
        "Clint: Yeah, and not only that, Brody had Laurence hog-tied when Oliver walked in.",
        "Kimberly: Ah, I love coming in here. Booya!",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. This is my new assistant Kimberly Andrews. Kimberly, this is Marty Saybrooke, Viki Banks.",
        "Viki: How do you do?",
        "Kimberly: Nice to meet you.",
        "Marty: What about John and Natalie?",
        "Clint: Well, John and Natalie weren't with Brody.",
        "Marty: Well, wha--what-- are they--",
        "Clint: Brody told Oliver that everybody survived the car crash, and everybody was fine where he had left them.",
        "Marty: No, no, no, Oliver said that the car was burnt to a crisp. So that explosion happened after Brody left?",
        "Clint: Well, it must have.",
        "Viki: But they walked away. They're out of the car. They're going to be fine.",

        "Natalie: Jared?",
        "John: No.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "John: You can't drift off. I need you to say awake.",
        "Natalie: Why?",
        "John: You probably have a concussion. How's your head?",
        "Natalie: It's been better.",
        "John: What's your name?",
        "Natalie: Natalie Banks.",

        "Natalie: Did it stop snowing?",
        "John: Yeah, it did, but we're still stuck.",
        "Natalie: Maybe we should try to get to the road.",
        "John: No, it's too risky trying to move you. Search and rescue will be out soon.",
        "Natalie: You think?",
        "John: The car exploded. That gets attention even in a blizzard.",
        "Natalie: What if they all think we're dead?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Marty, they're alive, I know it.",
        "Clint: I'm sure of it, too.",
        "Marty: I hope you're right.",
        "Viki: Honey, they got out of the car.",
        "Marty: Yeah, now they're out in the snowstorm, maybe hurt.",
        "Clint: Well, John would find shelter, you know that.",
        "Kimberly: Yeah, what I've heard is that he's like one cape short of a superhero, that guy. He'll get himself and Natalie home, right?",
        "Clint: Exactly right, yeah.",
        "Kimberly: So how is Stacy? Clint?",
        "Clint: Maybe you should sit down.",
        "Kimberly: No, no. That's never good. Just tell me. Did Mitch hurt Stacy? Tell me what happened!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What are you talking about?",
        "Gigi: We can't leave when the baby's coming, so guess what's going to happen.",
        "Stacy: No, no, I can't do that. I can't have my baby like this.",
        "Gigi: You don't have a choice.",
        "Stacy: Who's going to deliver it?!",
        "Gigi: I guess I am.",
        "Stacy: What? You're going to deliver my baby?",
        "Gigi: You see anybody else here?",
        "Stacy: Oh, God, no. This can't be. Oh!",
        "Gigi: I'm not loving it either, but here we are.",
        "Stacy: No, I need a hospital, okay, and a doctor and drugs.",
        "Gigi: That's not going to happen.",
        "Stacy: I don't want to be trapped here with you!",
        "Gigi: Believe me, I'd rather be looking for Schuyler. He's out there right now, all alone, and nobody cares but me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You ruined my life! You took Gigi!",
        "Rex: I did not!",

        "Gigi: You knew it would hurt, right?",
        "Stacy: I can't do it.",
        "Gigi: This baby is going to come whether you want it to or not.",
        "Stacy: No, I'm not ready. Not like this.",
        "Gigi: You had 9 months.",
        "Stacy: Were you ready when Shane was born?",
        "Gigi: No, no, but I did it when I was still a teenager.",
        "Stacy: Well, I'm not you.",
        "Gigi: No, you're not.",
        "Stacy: What was that look?",
        "Gigi: I have to deliver a baby!",
        "Stacy: See, it sucks for the both of us.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, but it's here, right?",
        "Stacy: Maybe if I just-- maybe if I try to go to sleep or something, I could stop it.",
        "Gigi: Stacy, it doesn't work like that.",
        "[Stacy groaning]",
        "Gigi: Okay, breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. Breathe up through your noise, out through your mouth. Hee hee hoo, hee hee hoo. Hee hee hoo. Breathe!",
        "Stacy: I wish Rex was here!",
        "[Groaning]",
        "Gigi: You tried.",

        "Rex: Ask that lying piece of garbage!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What about Rex? He's not here. We both have work to do. The truth is, he'd be a wreck. We're better off.",
        "Stacy: Maybe. Don't go!",
        "Gigi: I have to get some more blankets and pillows and I have to boil water and we need scissors or something to cut the cord.",
        "Stacy: Oh, God!",
        "Gigi: Trust me, you won't feel it by then.",
        "Stacy: Wait, don't leave me, please!",
        "Gigi: Stacy, I won't set foot outside the cabin, okay? But I have to run upstairs. And you have two jobs while I'm gone--don't push.",
        "Stacy: That's no problem.",
        "Gigi: Yes, it is. You'll want to, but don't. And relax. You won't want to, but it'll really help the baby, I swear. Talk to it.",
        "Stacy: Her.",
        "Gigi: Her. Okay, talk to her. Tell her everything is going to be all right.",
        "Stacy: What's going on in there, girl? You're not supposed to be coming now. Unless... unless you really are Rex's baby after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You okay? What are you going to do, Rex, kill him?",
        "Rex: It's done.",
        "Oliver: Really?",
        "Rex: Yes, forget it, it's over.",
        "Oliver: Good. You've got more important things to worry about, okay? I found Mitch.",
        "Rex: [Indistinct]",
        "Oliver: Yes. We found him at the geological observatory, about a mile that way.",
        "Schuyler: Did you find Jessica?",
        "Oliver: Well, Brody got there first. It was taken care of when I left, and I still haven't found John and Nat.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, where's Stacy? Where--how is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I know you're not Rex's baby, but we'll make it true. You helped me out by coming out earlier. Now I don't have to tell Gigi or anyone that Rex isn't your father. We make a good team, girl. Best friends. Just don't tell Kimmy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I don't know how Stacy is.",
        "Kimberly: Why not? Oliver found them, right? And it's kind of hard to miss the pregnant girl hanging out in the corner.",
        "Clint: Stacy wasn't there.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but Mitch was, so obviously he didn't take her anywhere.",
        "Clint: That's right.",
        "Kimberly: It's that bitch nurse, wasn't it? She tried to take Stacy before. She's like Mitch's zombie slave or something. She ran off with Stacy.",
        "Clint: Oliver did not say that.",
        "Marty: Then please just tell us exactly what Oliver did say.",
        "Clint: Well, it was a short call, it was a bad connection, so I may not have all of it. But when Oliver got there, that nurse was trying to strangle Brody, and Oliver didn't have any choice, he shot her.",
        "Viki: Where are they?",
        "Clint: A geological station that's part of a deserted army base that's up there.",
        "Viki: Did you tell the FBI?",
        "Clint: That's the first call I made, so I'm sure they're on their way.",
        "Kimberly: Did Oliver know what happened to Stacy?",
        "Clint: Well, just from what he could gather from Mitch's rants, and...apparently Mitch just sent Stacy away.",
        "Kimberly: Like how?",
        "Clint: Like just pushed her out the door.",
        "Marty: What, in the middle of a blizzard?",
        "Viki: Well, that doesn't make any sense! Stacy's carrying his grandchild. I mean, why would he go to the trouble of kidnapping her and then toss her out in the snow? Why would he do that?",
        "Clint: What's \"why\" got to do with Mitch? He's a lunatic, we all know that.",
        "Viki: Still! Kim, I'm quite sure your friend will be fine.",
        "Kimberly: Yeah?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Clint: There are now swarms of people on the mountain and they're looking for Stacy.",
        "Viki: Somebody's trying to find her! Somebody will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: But what if they see our car and think we went up in flames with it?",
        "John: Your family wouldn't give up. Trust me, they're out there looking. And Brody will get through.",
        "Natalie: So what do we do?",
        "John: Stay here, we keep the fire burning, someone will see the smoke.",
        "Natalie: I hope so. I just want to sleep.",
        "John: I know. But you can't. Seriously.",
        "Natalie: Why not? Aren't you tired?",
        "John: Yeah, I am, but I'll stay awake and I'll keep you company. No sleeping until we get you checked out.",
        "Natalie: This feels so strange.",
        "John: You were pretty out of it.",
        "Natalie: No, it's much more than that.",
        "Jessica: Ahh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: What have you done?!",
        "Dorian: She needs...",
        "Mitch: What the hell did you do?!",
        "Mitch: Jessica?",
        "Dorian: Get her off the stupid floor! Get her up! Keep pressure on the wound.",
        "Charlie: It was an accident.",
        "Brody: Get out of here!",
        "Dorian: I'm a doctor. Apply pressure.",
        "Charlie: I didn't mean to--",
        "Mitch: You brought a gun and started firing!",
        "Dorian: We have to help Jessica! Now, do we have a dressing--",
        "Mitch: You planned this.",
        "Dorian: Oh, Mitch, really, surely you have some medical supplies?",
        "Mitch: Nothing will save you now.",
        "Dorian: We have to save Jessica!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Any other room that we can deliver our baby here? There's gotta be something in there we can use.",
        "Dorian: Just keep pressure on the wound. Charlie? Charlie! Please, could you go get some towels, see if there's any antiseptic? We have to save Jessica! And stop this bleeding.",
        "Mitch: If my daughter dies, it's on your head, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Right.",
        "Clint: Don't go all wobbly on me now, all right? Viki's right. Everybody's going to be found.",
        "Viki: Now that they know their location, they can focus the search.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kimberly: Where is this place?",
        "Clint: It's off highway 217, about halfway up the mountain.",
        "Viki: I actually have a cabin out there.",
        "Marty: Oh, people are searching.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Yeah, they are. And now that the snow has stopped, they can get a helicopter in there, everybody is going to be found, including Stacy.",
        "Kimberly: What if they're too late?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Breathe! In through your nose! Don't push! Are you pushing?",
        "Stacy: I can't help it!",
        "Gigi: Don't push, Stacy. Not yet. Just breathe.",
        "[Stacy breathing heavily]",
        "Gigi: Okay. Okay, wow, these contractions are coming really fast.",
        "Stacy: It's like they're coming too fast.",
        "Gigi: I was in labor with Shane for 12 hours, so you're lucky, this will be over soon.",
        "Stacy: I'm going to die!",
        "Gigi: No, you won't.",
        "Stacy: I'm sure.",
        "Gigi: No, no one's going to die. You have to make breakfast for the next 18 years.",
        "Stacy: I'm going to be a lousy mother!",
        "Gigi: Everybody thinks that.",
        "Stacy: Oh, Gigi, I'll suck and you know it. I don't know anything about kids!",
        "Gigi: Neither did I. You learn on the job.",
        "Stacy: She's going to hate me!",
        "Gigi: No, she won't. She'll be the one person who totally loves you. And when you hold her in your arms and you see the little person that you and Rex made, the whole world falls into place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Did you find somebody?",
        "Oliver: No.",
        "Schuyler: Well, didn't miss--",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but she was gone by the time Brody got to the site.",
        "Schuyler: Gone where?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Stacy breathing heavily]",
        "Gigi: Okay, good, now deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Slow. Slow breath, got it? Okay.",
        "Stacy: Why are you being so nice to me?",
        "Gigi: You're in labor, that's punishment enough.",
        "Stacy: You want to go find Schuyler, don't you?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Stacy: I wouldn't blame you if you left.",
        "Gigi: I wouldn't do that to an innocent baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Something happened between Mitch and Stacy. And he threw her out.",
        "Schuyler: Stacy got thrown out of her own kidnapping?",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "Rex: Well, there's a shock.",
        "Schuyler: Was he trying to kill her?",
        "Oliver: No. Well, I don't know. It was, like, punishment.",
        "Schuyler: For what?",
        "Oliver: Lying to him?",
        "Rex: Mitch figured out it wasn't his grandchild.",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "Rex: Stacy. She's not having my baby. It's Schuyler's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You want to help me no matter who the father is?",
        "Gigi: It's still a baby.",
        "Stacy: Oh, God! Oh, God! [Groaning]",
        "Gigi: I can see the top of the baby's head!",
        "Stacy: No!",
        "Gigi: It's time! Come on, push!",
        "Stacy: No, no, you said not to!",
        "Gigi: That was then, this is now! Do it now! Push! I've got you, Stacy, okay? You can do this! Push! Push!",
        "[Stacy screaming]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, don't! Don't! We have tried.",
        "Todd: Not hard enough.",
        "T\u00e9a: How can you say that?",
        "Todd: Well, you said it, didn't you? You said it yourself when you were back from Tahiti. You said that moment we kissed, I thought everything was going to be okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know what I said.",
        "Todd: Well, it was more than just talk, I think.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ugh! Todd...",
        "Todd: And you know what happened afterwards.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah--",
        "Todd: After that, you thought everything was going to be okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know what happened afterwards. Don't do this.",
        "Todd: You're doing it! You! And you know how you feel about me, and you know that I feel the same way. I don't know how you can stand there and deny it. How do you deny our love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What is it, you got a headache?",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] No, I don't know. I--it was like I was passed out, but I wasn't. And it's like this dream, but it was so real. Jared was here, with me, talking to me. I could feel him lying right next to me. Like he'd never left. I must be losing it.",
        "John: And you had a fever and you got hit pretty hard.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but it was so real.",
        "John: You were hallucinating.",
        "Natalie: I could feel him. I could reach out and just touch... you? Everything I said, I said it to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kimberly: Stacy's way pregnant, and she wasn't even dressed for the snow. We had just been at the hospital.",
        "Marty: The hospital, why?",
        "Kimberly: We thought she was going into labor.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Kimberly: It was a false alarm, though. But still, she's way far along. That girl does not have a good sense of direction, on her best day. Even if she did, she wouldn't know where to go.",
        "Clint: Well, the FBI knows, and they're going to be sending in rescue teams.",
        "Kimberly: What else?",
        "Clint: Well, we do an awful lot of praying that everybody gets back safely.",
        "Kimberly: You can't leave this up to God! What if he's not a fan? I can't just stand here!",
        "Clint: Whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Viki: Where are you going?",
        "Kimberly: Do you know how many times I've called the cops in my life and just waited?",
        "Marty: That's not going to happen here.",
        "Kimberly: You guys may have better luck with law enforcement, but they don't show up for people like Stacy and me.",
        "Viki: Honey, rescue crews are not going to discriminate, especially against a pregnant girl.",
        "Kimberly: I'm not taking any chances.",
        "Clint: Kim, what do you want to do?",
        "Kimberly: I want to go up that mountain and bring Stacy home myself.",
        "Clint: No, no--",
        "Kimberly: Now that's the plan. Is anyone with me?",
        "[Clint sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Tell me what happened.",
        "John: Like I said, you were pretty out of it. And you thought I was Jared.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. What I said.",
        "John: It's no big deal.",
        "Natalie: No, I couldn't stop going on and on about how much I love you and how we were always gonna be together.",
        "John: It was just that kind of day. You weren't thinking straight.",
        "Natalie: You should have stopped me.",
        "John: Yeah, I thought with everything you've been through, maybe that would make it worse.",
        "Natalie: You told me you loved me. When I said \"I love you\" to Jared, he said it back. That was you.",
        "John: Yeah.",
