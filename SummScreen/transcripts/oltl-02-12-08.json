        "Natalie: Ah.",
        "Jared: Ooh. Why did we wait so long to do that?",
        "Natalie: I don't know -- I think it had a little something to do with you pretending to be my uncle.",
        "Jared: Oh, right.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "Jared: Ah.",
        "Natalie: Now, what was that all about again?",
        "Jared: Oh, that was -- pfft -- just if you keep doing what you're doing.",
        "Natalie: What, interrogating you? You like when I put the screws to you?",
        "Jared: I like that other thing you do.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Okay, well, how about you do the talking and I'll do the other thing?",
        "Jared: Okay.",
        "Natalie: So -- impersonating Grandpa's son?",
        "Jared: Oh -- pfft. That was about money -- you know, it was ambition. I got my head on straight now. Whew.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I can see that -- uncle schmuncle.",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Jared: Uncle schmuncle.",

        "Natalie: Well, what's the plan?",
        "Jessica: Uh, same as yesterday.",
        "Natalie: Huh -- right, right, scare the truth out of her.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, one way or another.",
        "Natalie: Okay, wait -- then what? I mean, she gives us the big secret, and how are we getting back to St. Ann's?",
        "Jessica: well, let's let the nuns figure that out. You know, any second, they're going to realize that Allison is missing and then it's going to be breaking news, and then all we're going to have to do is lock her back in there, call Bo, cue the cavalry -- bada bing, bada boom.",
        "Natalie: How did I let you talk me into this?",
        "Jessica: I don't know -- I guess it was just your twin sense tingling.",
        "Natalie: All right, well, let's just hurry up before Mom shows up, by the slight chance that she decides this is a good day to come visit crazy old Victor.",
        "Jessica: Huh.",

        "Viki: Pancakes?",
        "Charlie: Well, how do you get them heart-shaped like that?",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. You can't work in a diner for five months and not learn anything.",
        "Charlie: Ah.",
        "Viki: Help yourself.",

        "Charlie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Viki: No, actually, Dorian and I decided that we were going to make this year's red ball one for the history books.",

        "Marcie: An hour, maybe.",
        "Michael: Yeah. All right, well, I'll see if they let me give you something for that.",
        "Marcie: No, look, you know the only thing that's going to help me is if I take responsibility for my actions, okay? So, look, if you're here to convince me that I --",
        "Michael: Honey, no, no, no --",
        "Marcie: That's really not --",
        "Michael: No, I'm not, I'm not. Today, I'm here to wish you Happy Valentine's Day.",

        "Todd: You're such an incompetent jackass -- because I'm innocent. No, no. No, it was him. No, I was trying to stop him. Son of a bitch was trying to kill two innocent people.\"",
        "Ramsey: Not me. Never me. This whole plan was about you -- just setting you up.",
        "Todd: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Ramsey: Well, you're a bright guy. You'll figure it out.",
        "Todd: Bo? I want my lawyer. This is false imprisonment. I'll tell you another thing -- when my newspaper gets ahold of this --",

        "John: Now, I tell you, if that's not Valentine's Day card material, I don't know what it is.",

        "Bo: John.",
        "Todd: So what's it going to be, Bo? You going to beat the truth out of us?",
        "Bo: No, John is here at my request as a witness to last night's shooting.",
        "Ramsey: Ah, even former officer John can see this has your name all over it.",
        "John: Check this out -- look how I got the toilet in focus in the foreground.",
        "Bo: That's good.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's abuse.",
        "Bo: Yeah. No, that's -- hey, save that. That'll make a great screensaver.",
        "Todd: You hear what I said? That's abuse.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Yes, I understand that, Mayor Lowell, but, see, Marcie's become kind of a cause celebre. Her supporters, they've raised thousands of -- but if I push for remand, you see, we're going to run the risk of -- with all due respect, Your Honor, you can't fire me. I'm an elected official? Hello? Hello? You pompous --",
        "Lindsay: Oh, I feel your pain. Believe me, I know what it's like not to be listened to.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Lindsay: Is this about Marcie's case?",
        "Nora: Why do you always ask me questions you know I won't answer?",
        "Lindsay: Because she's my friend. Have you totally forgotten that concept, of friendship --",
        "Nora: Oh, that's right.",
        "Lindsay: Support, loyalty?",
        "Nora: Yes, friendship that knows no bounds, not even murder.",
        "Lindsay: You did say something that was right to the mayor -- you don't want to keep Marcie in jail.",
        "Nora: What I want is none of your business.",
        "Lindsay: Believe it or not, Nora, I'm thinking about you here because if you pursue this case against Marcie, you're going to be in for a world of hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Allison? It's Jessica! And Natalie's with me, too! Hope you didn't freeze to death! Because we're going to do 20 questions, take two, so -- move away from the door. We are armed but we don't want to hurt you.",
        "Natalie: I do.",
        "Jessica: Allison?",

        "Roxy: Could I get a cup of joe and a jelly doughnut, please?",
        "Markko: I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm just here to pick up my paycheck.",
        "Roxy: Well, is Mama Vega around to take my order? Hey, listen, you want to make a big tip, or what?",
        "Markko: How do you take your coffee?",
        "Roxy: Is that it -- is that your pitch? \"How do I take my coffee?\"",
        "Markko: Uh -- did you want something else, ma'am?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I'd like you not to call me \"ma'am.\" Okay, listen -- when a customer comes in and they want a cup of coffee, you offer them a double cafe latte with plenty of whipped cream, and if they want a jelly doughnut, you give them the breakfast special with extra sausage. Hey, come on, this is America, man. Where's your hustle and glow?",
        "Markko: Yeah, but you didn't want any of that stuff.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, you know, if we always got what we wanted, we wouldn't need Cupid or the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus.",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Okay, we'll take this from the top. I'd like a cup of joe and a jelly doughnut, please.",
        "Markko: You like coffee, you're going to love Carlotta's cafe con leche. I'll get you a taste.",
        "Roxy: You got promise, kid.",

        "Allison: Allison, you lucky dog. There's your ticket to ride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Ah --",
        "Jared: Roxanne. What's going on?",
        "Roxy: Oh. Well -- well, what you do is, you know, you take a pen and you write out a secret -- you know, something that you'd love to tell somebody else but you just can't?",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Roxy: And then you put a buck in the box and -- and then you drop your secret in.",
        "Markko: They're throwing this ball tonight where they all get burned.",
        "Jared: With the secret, not the money?",
        "Markko: Oh, the money's for charity.",
        "Roxy: Oh, you know, I don't want the moola. I just want my secret back.",
        "Jared: Well, what's it matter if they're all going to get destroyed?",

        "Allison: Some secrets don't die in the fire -- do they, Rox?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, I feel like a big boob because I think I'm the only person who put a really important secret in there.",
        "Jared: Ah.",
        "Roxy: So -- what about you hunks? You got any really important secrets that you want to get off your manly chests?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Natalie, I did what you said. I -- I checked for tracks but all I found were our own.",
        "Natalie: That means the window of time for her to escape is huge. She could've left any time last night since -- before it was snowing an hour ago.",
        "Jessica: So -- so, what, so we're screwed? Great.",
        "Natalie: No, not necessarily, not necessarily, okay? Look at this plaque -- did it look crooked before?",
        "Jessica: Natalie, I don't come down here for quiet time, okay, so I wouldn't know. What are you doing? Natalie, we have to go and look for her!",
        "Natalie: Just give me one more second. Just a second.",
        "[Natalie groans]",
        "Natalie: Ah, ah! There's your secret.",
        "Jessica: Oh. That may be her way out.",
        "Natalie: There was probably a key in there -- that's how she got out.",
        "Jessica: Well, she knew where it was.",
        "Natalie: And whatever was in there, she took it with her.",
        "Jessica: Where the hell would she go?",
        "Natalie and Jessica: Mom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I mean, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to come to the ball. I mean, obviously I gave you almost no notice.",
        "Charlie: No, Viki, I'm -- I would love to go but I just don't think I should.",
        "Viki: Why not?",
        "Charlie: Well, I mean, let's face it -- I'd be sort of out of my element in that kind of fancy shindig and I don't want to, I mean, cramp your style.",
        "Viki: \"Cramp my style\"?",
        "Charlie: Look, this is a very important ball and, I mean, it's your first, you know, coming-out, sort of, since you've been back from Texas and all eyes are going to be on you.",
        "Viki: And on the man who's with me.",
        "Charlie: Exactly. And this is for charity and that's a very important charity to you and I don't want people to be focused on just gossip. I want them to be focused on forking out their money for this very good cause.",
        "Viki: Well, in the first place, the people have already forked over their money because they had to buy the tickets. And in the second place, they're going to gossip anyway, so it might as well be about us.",
        "Charlie: Hey, look, I'm -- I'm being serious here. And also, I don't have a tux.",
        "Viki: Pfft -- get you one in two seconds.",
        "Charlie: Hmm. Well, that would solve one of the problems, but what about the other?",
        "Viki: Charlie, listen. We'll make a very nice entrance and, yes, everyone will be wondering, \"Who is that fascinating, extremely handsome man who is with me?\" They will ask me a number of questions -- veiled -- about my love life and I will simply say, \"No comment. We're just friends.\" Then we will hand out all the gift bags and they have Campbell's select soup, we have V8 juice, we have Prego spaghetti sauce.",
        "Charlie: These are all red.",
        "Viki: Precisely.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: And then, we will simply sit back and let them wonder.",
        "Charlie: So -- I'm a part of your love life now?",
        "Viki: Well, if you're not, we've got a problem.",
        "Charlie: Well, we can't have that. So where are you going to get this tux?",
        "Viki: Are you kidding? I'm going to go upstairs and sew one up on my trusty sewing machine.",
        "[Charlie chuckles]",
        "Viki: Allow me one little secret, okay, and you can have one in return.",
        "Jessica: Mom, are you all right?",
        "Natalie: Looks plenty all right to me.",
        "Charlie: Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I -- I didn't realize that it was Valentine's Day.",
        "Michael: I wanted to do something special for you, but, you know, the guards wouldn't let me, so all I have to offer is me.",
        "Marcie: Oh, Michael, that's very sweet.",
        "Michael: And this.",
        "Marcie: Mike, you're not supposed to bring those things in here!",
        "Michael: So? I don't care. I love you, Marcie. Happy Valentine's Day.",
        "Marcie: Happy Valentine's Day.",
        "Michael: There's a lot in that little heart and I want you to know it's -- it's going to be here for you forever.",
        "Marcie: That's what I worry about -- because you've given me so much and I -- I worry that there's going to be nothing left for you.",
        "Michael: Taking care of you is taking care of me, okay? There is no me without you.",
        "Marcie: Oh, Mike, there has to be because I'm going to prison, you know that.",
        "Michael: No, no, no -- we don't know that. Anything could happen. Could you ever have imagined that Todd, after he took Tommy away from us, would do anything so stupid as to land himself in jail months after? Oh, okay, okay. Okay, that's a bad example.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: But you know what I mean.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Right?",
        "Marcie: Do you know why he and Agent Ramsey were brought in here last night?",
        "Michael: No. I haven't heard anything but I'm sure I will.",
        "Guard: It's time.",
        "Michael: Oh, okay. I will see you in there.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Remember -- not guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Well, thank you for the heads-up. I'll make sure I hire a bodyguard for when Marcie's verdict is read to protect me from your next murderous rampage and then inevitable breakdown.",
        "Lindsay: I'm of no danger to anyone, especially not you.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah? Then what was that threat two minutes ago?",
        "Lindsay: It wasn't a threat. It was concern.",
        "Nora: Huh.",
        "Lindsay: You're a district attorney. You haven't had a win in a long time. You just lost the trial of the decade with Spencer Truman's murder. You've lost the mayor's faith. You need a win and you're not going to get it with Marcie's case.",
        "Nora: You don't know anything about this case.",
        "Lindsay: There's no jury that's going to find Marcie guilty. Your career is going to be a joke.",
        "Nora: Well, then, maybe what I should do is throw a fit -- foam at the mouth. I could cause a mistrial, you could give me pointers.",
        "Lindsay: You're on the wrong end of this trial.",
        "Nora: You don't get out of my face, you're going to be on the wrong end of my foot.",
        "Bo: Everything okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay. I'll take it from here, Bruno. Can you take those cuffs off, please?",
        "Todd: What are we doing here?",
        "John: We're here for Marcie's arraignment.",
        "Todd: Oh, really? Fantastic. Uh -- I'll have a large popcorn, some chocolate- covered raisins, and if you can get me a front-row seat, I'll heckle her.",
        "John: Yeah, I think you're going to keep quiet till I say otherwise.",
        "Todd: Oh, well, you know me.",
        "John: Yeah, yeah, unfortunately, and I also know you don't want to go to prison for conspiring and attempting to murder Gigi and Shane Morasco.",
        "Todd: No, no, that was Ramsey. See, I was trying to get my kid back. It just -- that doesn't add up.",
        "John: You sure about that? See, a witness puts Ramsey in your penthouse chowing down on takeout less than 24 hours before the shooting. And I can put you in that building seconds later, smoking gun in your hand. Is it starting to add up now?",
        "Todd: Yeah, it is. What would you like me to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: What is wrong with you girls?",
        "Jessica: Nothing.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, we just wanted to come and see you, that's all.",
        "Jessica: But we can see that you're in the middle of something, so we'll come back.",
        "Viki: No, no, no, you're not interrupting.",
        "Natalie: No, actually, we have something to do.",
        "Viki: Okay, why do you want to see me?",
        "Jessica: Well, we just were wondering whether you need any help for tonight, and --",
        "Natalie: It looks like you got plenty.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Viki: This is really silly, okay? Come here. Let me introduce you. Jessica, Natalie, this is my friend from Paris, Texas, Charlie Balsom.",
        "Jessica: Really? Well, you finally got it together and tracked him down? Hi, I'm Jessica. It's so nice to meet you.",
        "Charlie: The pleasure is mine. Your mother's talked a lot about you.",
        "Jessica: So, I hope she's prepared you for the grilling that you're going to get.",
        "Viki: Jessie -- no.",
        "Natalie: So, Charlie B is Charlie Balsom?",
        "Jessica: That's funny, we know a lot of Balsoms, and didn't you say that he was looking for his son?",
        "Viki: Yes. And as a matter of fact, Rex is Charlie's son.",

        "[Music plays]",
        "Markko: Well, don't look at me. I'm an open book.",
        "Roxy: That's because you haven't lived long enough. You, on the other hand -- you're probably hiding about 100 skeletons in the closet somewhere. So why don't you throw the box a bone? You can afford it.",
        "Jared: Not my thing.",
        "Roxy: Doesn't matter, because Natalie already gave me the 911 on you, anyway.",
        "Jared: She did?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, you seem surprised about that. You know, even though Nattie and I aren't biologically related to each other, we share a lot of information. And I knew that you two were hitting it off, even before life threw you \"oy gevalt\" -- don't even go there.",
        "Jared: Yeah. We could've had something if things had turned out differently.",
        "Roxy: Ever wish they had? Yeah, me, too. I think I need a doughnut.",

        "Cole: You mentioned it in group the other day.",

        "Cole: Well, I wish, but I'm stuck studying for a history exam tomorrow.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Langston: Oh, that's okay, because Markko has to work, too, so looks like me and Starr have a little girls' day out.",
        "Starr: Oh, yay.",
        "Blair: Ooh, I think I need to go change his diaper. Hmm.",

        "Cole: Oh, man. Langston, she is totally clueless.",
        "Langston: Oh, okay, but that does not mean we can get sloppy. It would not be cool if she found out what we've been doing.",

        "Todd: Break a leg, Marcie. We're all counting on you! This is not going to work. Nobody's going to believe me.",

        "Nora: Okay, you need to take your little flowers and go sit down now.",

        "Bailiff: This court is now in session.",
        "Judge: Be seated. Our first order of business is to hear the charges, which include kidnapping in the first degree and reckless endangerment. Will the defendant please rise?",

        "John: You can always take your chances in court. Yeah, it's McBain -- I'll hold.",
        "Todd: Well, maybe I will take my chances in court. After all, everything that happened to Gigi and her son is on Ramsey. I am the one that stopped him from killing them.",
        "John: I'm going to call you back on that. I'm inclined to believe you. Now, Ramsey's going down on this no matter what. They can trace the gun to him; they found powder marks on his hand. And faced with all that evidence, he's going to want to make a deal, and that's when he implicates you. You were found with the gun in your hand. Let me tell you something -- in court, possession is 9/10 of the law.",
        "Todd: What's the other tenth anyway?",
        "John: Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "John: You know, when Gigi Morasco testifies as to who was threatening her and her son, she's going to look to me for a cue. One nod from me and she's going to say \"Lee Ramsey,\" another nod, she's going to say \"Lee Ramsey and Todd Manning.\" How I nod depends on the decision you make right now. So what's it going to be?",

        "Judy: Your Honor, she's a first-time offender who has been exceedingly cooperative since her arrest.",
        "Nora: Your Honor, she's also a proven flight risk.",
        "Judge: Thank you both. I've heard enough. Bail is granted in the amount of $1 million.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you can let her go, Your Honor. I'll post that bail.",
        "Judge: You're willing to post the defendant's million-dollar bail?",
        "Todd: Absolutely, no problem.",
        "Judge: Very well. Does counsel have any other business to attend to?",
        "Nora: I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, this is highly irregular. This is -- Mr. Manning is the victim's father, and -- and a loose cannon, to say the very least. He's been screaming for the defendant's head for months now. I mean, how do we know this isn't a ploy for him to be able to -- to punish Mrs. McBain outside of the law?",
        "Todd: Your Honor, if I might --",
        "Judge: This is a hearing, not a trial.",
        "Todd: Well, this isn't for you, it's for everyone else -- especially you, Nora -- or, D.A. Hanen, excuse me. I implore you to please go easy on Marcie over there. I -- I've been thinking about it, and I think that if our roles were reversed, I -- I probably would've done the same thing. I mean, I would've gotten away with it, though, right, Judge? Uh -- but it's over now, and my son's home with me, and that's the important thing. And I think that I'd like to concentrate my time and effort on raising him, and not coming to court every day and watching some lunatic woman. The other thing is I think she's learned her lesson. I don't think she's going to terrorize any more babies, do you? So -- I mean, she knows that -- that Sam's never going to be hers ever again, and she's certainly suffering -- I hope she's suffering -- and that's punishment enough. I don't want to be a party to any more punishment.",

        "Natalie: That's really strange that, you know, we never ran into each other. I mean, you don't -- you don't really look familiar to me. Although, that's not that's surprising -- Roxy had so many guys.",
        "Viki: Um -- Natalie, don't.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- but, you know, it's probably for the best that we didn't cross paths, I mean, if you were hanging out with Roxy back in the day. Hmm.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, we were -- I mean, our time together was very brief.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. Well. Well, you found Rex just in the nick of time -- he's deep into wedding plans with Adriana.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, yeah, and I met Adriana. She seems like a great kid.",
        "Viki: Oh, she is.",

        "Jessica: So, Charlie is Rex's dad?",

        "Jessica: Well, I took a shortcut -- I asked Lois, and she asked the staff if there was anything funny going on.",
        "Natalie: And nothing? Okay, well, you know, Allison could be anywhere. I'm going to go downtown; I'm going to check the bus and train stations. Why don't you go check the ride boards at L.U.",
        "Jessica: Okay, I'll call -- if I find her, I'll call you first and stuff her in my trunk second.",
