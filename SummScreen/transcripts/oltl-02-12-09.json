        "Eunice: Welcome to the \"Go Red\" Ball.",
        "David: Thank you. Namaste, Ms. Burns.",
        "Dorian: Eunice, it is so good to see you. Are we the first ones here?",
        "Eunice: I'll just need your tickets.",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes. Of course. There you are. Come, darling.",
        "Eunice: And your names?",
        "Dorian: You know my name. I am, after all, the co-chair of this event.",
        "Eunice: We have to keep a record of everyone who attends.",
        "Dorian: Darling, I wonder if you wouldn't go ahead without me. I'll be there in just a moment.",
        "David: Namaste.",
        "Dorian: Eunice, if the presence of my companion were known, it could cause a disruption at this event. And we wouldn't want that, would we?",
        "Eunice: I can assure you, I'm the soul of discretion.",
        "Dorian: I knew I could count on you. And please, would you add the name Beaver Calhoun to the list?",
        "Eunice: Does he have a ticket?",
        "Dorian: Yes! Of course, he has a ticket. He's a VIP.",
        "Eunice: Good, because no one gets in without a ticket.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Ugh. A ticket can't just get up and walk away, can it? But neither can a dress. Great, Morasco, now you're talking to yourself. How could they have just disappeared?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: David Vickers is here in your hotel?",
        "Roxy: Yes. So weird, because he didn't want any pillows. He said he wanted to be just like dolly someone.",
        "Rex: Yeah, the Dalai Lama.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, like her.",
        "Rex: You wouldn't be teasing me, huh? Your first-born son, your only son?",
        "Roxy: Why would I be giving you the skinny since Dorian gave me a lot of money to keep my lips zipped?",
        "Rex: Dorian, she's here, too?",
        "Roxy: Shh, quiet. She's in room three.",

        "Moe: Are you showing up -- what do they call, fashionably late? I read all about it in Emily Post.",

        "Roxy: Hey, Johnny-boy, I knew that Blair wouldn't stay angry at you. And so what if you told Marty and the two of those girls were swimming around in the Llantano River? Excuse me, if you didn't want anyone listening, you should've moved to another booth.",
        "John: Good night, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Oh, wait a minute. Oh, no, your tie is all -- no, it's all screwed up.",

        "T\u00e9a: I didn't work my ass off to get you acquitted so you could just hole yourself up here in Marty's old bedroom.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Balsom, it's me. You didn't happen to come back home and take my ticket and my dress, did you? Because I thought we were meeting at the ball, so you wouldn't need my dress. Unless you were planning on wearing it. You weren't, right? Call me as soon as you get this.",

        "Charlie: I just hope things go a little more smoothly than they did last year.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: David, I hope you will forgive me wearing this garish red dress instead of the traditional spiritual garb.",
        "David: Oh, no, I understand. You made a commitment to this cause before you made a commitment to me.",
        "Dorian: My d\u00e9colletage, does it offend?",
        "David: Dorian, you look --",
        "Dorian: Vulgar? Impure?",

        "David: What is this? It looks like a game show.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no, don't you see? It's a -- it's a meditation room. While I'm busy with my co-chair duties, well, you can be in here maintaining tradition, meditating, chanting.",
        "David: Why don't we go out together? I'm starting to get the feeling that you're hiding something.",
        "Dorian: Why, darling, what would I be hiding?",
        "David: Me. What are you up to, Dorian? What in the world is going on?",

        "Moe: Blair says she's not going.",
        "Noelle: What?",
        "Blair: Yeah, you know, I think I'll just sit this one out this year.",

        "Noelle: Oh, well, why don't you come with us?",
        "Blair: No, no, no, I would be intruding. I'm not going to do that.",
        "Moe: What about that ex-cop you were seeing?",
        "Noelle: Moe, that's none of our business.",
        "Blair: You know what? I asked myself the same thing. What about that ex-cop that I've been seeing? He's says that I'm the one, but every time I turn around, he's off --",
        "Noelle: You think he's cheating on you?",
        "Blair: No. But I am beginning to feel like it's just a matter of time, you know?",

        "John: Well, you took a header into the Llantano River.",
        "Marty: I didn't take a header. Your girlfriend pulled me in.",
        "John: Okay, I was just asking.",
        "Marty: What's with the pretty tux anyway?",
        "John: Well, there's this thing tonight.",
        "Marty: Oh, that's right, the \"Go Red\" ball. Didn't figure you for a $500-a-plate type. Blair must be thrilled.",

        "Rex: David's not in his room!",
        "Roxy: You know, you're completely freaking me out. I've been sitting here the whole time. He didn't go through the front door.",
        "Rex: Okay, look, there's no other way out of here?",
        "Roxy: There's no other way -- yeah, through the back. Actually, he could've gone out through kitchen --",
        "Rex: Damn! They're already at the ball!",
        "Roxy: Calm down -- hey! Hey, Rex, you forgot your phone. Rex, you got --",
        "[Roxy sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Eunice: I still need your name.",
        "Stacy: Why? It's not like I'm going to steal anything.",
        "Eunice: How do I know that? We have lots of lovely gift bags. Heart-healthy products, like that Swanson's chunk chicken, so handy to have in the cupboard.",
        "Stacy: And where do you expect me to stash that exactly?",
        "Eunice: I have to have your name. You have to be on my list or you don't get in the door.",
        "Stacy: Morasco.",
        "Eunice: Morasco -- Gigi?",

        "Nora: Are we sure they're coming?",
        "Clint: Any word from Rex?",
        "Bo: Not since he left Viki's.",
        "Clint: Damn it.",
        "Nora: Hey, hey, hey, tonight is about preventing heart attacks, remember?",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, if Dorian made some kind of deal with David, they could take over everything we own.",
        "Nora: Maybe we should've told Vickers about all of this before you hooked up with Dorian, and then we could've made a deal with him.",
        "Clint: I am not going to David Vickers with my hat in my hand.",
        "Nora: Well, maybe we don't have to. I mean, maybe his newfound Buddhism will give him his spirit of generosity.",
        "Clint: Oh, please, I don't buy that for a second.",
        "Nora: Yeah, okay, I'm not really buying it either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Why, David, what would I possibly be hiding? Um, no. Do you have any idea how excited I am to announce to everybody that I am now Mrs. David Vickeroshi?",
        "David: So let's go tell them now.",
        "Dorian: No, no, I -- I want it to be perfect, exactly how I imagined it.",
        "David: So, why don't we go out together to the party?",
        "Dorian: And spoil the surprise?",
        "David: You always did have a flair for the dramatic, didn't you?",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: And I will try and bring you back some refreshment.",
        "Dorian: Oh!",
        "Viki: What could you be up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Okay, guys, you better get going.",
        "Moe: What, and leave you here all by yourself?",
        "Noelle: Worrying that your man is cheating on you?",
        "Blair: John McBain is not my man.",
        "Moe: Didn't look like that to me.",
        "Noelle: He sure did seem sweet on you.",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, John McBain is his own man. He's the strong, silent type. First, I thought that was kind of sexy. Now, it's just kind of frustrating.",
        "Moe: You know, sometimes, men don't like to --",
        "Blair: To talk about their feelings?",
        "Moe: As much as women do.",
        "Blair: Yeah, they can risk their own life, and they're okay with that, but the minute you want them to talk about how they feel, they get all scared to death. Is that what you're saying?",
        "Moe: Well, sometimes, we like to pretend we don't even have feelings.",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, John didn't have any problem telling Marty Saybrooke how he feels. That's for sure.",
        "Noelle: Oh, you heard it?",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah. I definitely heard it, and if that's how he feels, then to hell with him.",
        "Noelle: Now, I'm sure you don't mean that. Whatever happened between --",
        "Blair: It's over, okay? I'm over John McBain.",
        "John: Oh, looks like I have a problem, then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I hope when my handsome prince shows up, he looks just like Johnny-boy.",
        "Marty: Excuse me?",
        "Roxy: You know, he wears more black than an undertaker. But, oh, man, do you see that white makes his blue eyes just go pop.",
        "Marty: Yeah, he looked nice.",
        "Roxy: Nice? Oh -- a hunka-hunka. Oh, I'm sorry, man, that was kind of gauche, because, like, the two of you used to --",
        "Marty: It's okay, I don't remember, whatever it was.",
        "Roxy: You know, I got to tell you, honestly, I was really put off when the two of you got together, because I thought Natalie and him were going to be together for life. But, you know, sometimes things, they just don't work out the way you plan. And you two were old friends for a long time, so you know, it was good, but sometimes when it's real slow like that, you turn up the heat just --",
        "Marty: Anymore travel magazines?",
        "Roxy: Well, I got a \"Guns and Ammo.\" It would be real good for the guy that you're shacking up with.",
        "Marty: I'm not shacking up with him.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, sure, you're with Seal boy, and Johnny's with Blair, it's cool.",

        "T\u00e9a: My client's been falsely accused of murdering his wife.",

        "T\u00e9a: Oh! I believed you when you said you didn't kill Lee Halpern. I found you slumped next to her body with a bloody knife in your hand, and still, I believed you.",
        "Todd: You're a dope, then.",
        "T\u00e9a: I lied to the cops. I told them I did it. I lied to the cops and told them I did it to save your ass! And now, you're making fun of me?",

        "T\u00e9a: Well, I wish I could lighten up. But an innocent man's life is at stake.",
