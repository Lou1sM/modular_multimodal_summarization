        "After Gigi notices that there is something wrong with Stacy's baby and she needs medical care, she goes out into the snow with the baby but discovers she's walking on thin ice over a lake. Rex tells Schuyler and Oliver he's washed his hands to Stacy and the baby that's not his and wants to get back with Gigi, assuming it's possible after she finds out that Schuyler is the one who impregnated Stacy yet lied to Gigi about it. The three of them find her on the ice with the baby before she's ready to fall through. Viki and Clint rush to the hospital after Jessica has been shot and Brody has difficulty telling them all that has happened for how she got shot by accident by Charlie. After Jessica gets shot, Mitch blames Dorian and tells her one of her girls will die. She is horrified knowing what he is capable of. And right then, we see Dorian's daughter, Adriana in Paris with her cousin Kelly Cramer at a cafe. And there is a mysterious man at another table watching them."

        "Rex: Find Gigi. Guess what happens next?",
        "Schuyler: She loves me, you know.",
        "Rex: Which version? 'Cause after she hears what you've done, I don't think \"love\" will be the word.",
        "Schuyler: You two were over, Rex. You did that.",
        "Rex: She could forgive me. And I won't stop till I get her back.",
        "Schuyler: What about Stacy?",
        "Rex: What about her?",
        "Schuyler: Well, she's out there in the snow somewhere, Rex, pregnant.",
        "Rex: Yeah, with his kid, not mine. Which makes her his problem.",

        "Gigi: I think there's something wrong with her.",
        "Stacy: What do you mean there's something wrong with her? You just told me she was perfect! 10 little fingers and 10 little toes.",
        "Gigi: I know, but didn't she look, I don't know, pinker to you before?",
        "Stacy: When?",
        "Gigi: When I handed her to you.",
        "Stacy: Well, she was just born! Even I'm paler now, right?",
        "Gigi: No, you're not. I mean, look at her mouth. Don't her lips look a little blue?",

        "Nurse: I'll check for you.",
        "Clint: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Look, I don't get this! How could she be fine one minute, and then somehow shot?",
        "Clint: Somehow?",
        "Viki: We don't know for sure that Mitch did it.",

        "Adriana: Yeah!",

        "Kelly: Oh. Well, I heard about Mayor Dorian.",

        "Kelly: Hmm, David told me.",
        "Adriana: I don't understand! How can she be so...",
        "Kelly: Irresponsible.",
        "Adriana: Stupid! And Lowell dropped the charges against that freak Mitch Laurence, so he's on the loose. Which means nobody's safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: He's threatened my family, and I can prove that. Yes, I have a picture of them. He crossed out their eyes. The youngest of them is a baby!",
        "Second agent: Ma'am, he can't hurt you where he's going.",
        "Dorian: No, but his followers can. He leads a cult, and they're everywhere. And the only way to stop them is to exterminate their beloved leader. And this time, I'm going to make sure you're dead.",
        "Mitch: He who believeth in me shall never die.",
        "Dorian: But you don't believe in anything. Therefore... [Click] You deserve to die.",
        "Mitch: I wouldn't do that if I were you, Dorian. Not if you still cherish those girls of yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: God, where is she? The nurse said the chopper's already left.",
        "Viki: Well, maybe they took her back to the--there's Brody!",

        "Brody: She lost consciousness.",
        "Greg: Is this the gunshot wound?",
        "EMT: She's got a serious bleed. Pulse is weak and thready, about 130.",
        "Viki: Stay calm.",
        "Greg: Put her in 133.",
        "Brody: I'm going with her.",
        "Greg: No, you're not. She needs a trauma panel, plus type and cross for six units. Give her o-neg for now. Then call upstairs for a stat fast exam and then set me up for a cordis.",
        "Brody: I promised her I was gonna go--",
        "Greg: What, that you'd save her? Then get out of my way.",

        "Natalie: You usually play your cards so close to the vest. So for you to tell me that you feel something for me...",
        "John: It was wrong. I shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Natalie: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: So you're just-- you're just going to walk away?",
        "Rex: From Stacy? She made my life a living hell, with your help. You figure it out. She's all yours.",
        "Schuyler: Rex, what are you going to tell Gigi?",
        "Rex: The truth. Get used to it!",
        "Oliver: You know what, maybe it's better this way.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah, if Gigi hears it from him instead of me, she's going to hate me.",
        "Oliver: Maybe. Or maybe not.",
        "Schuyler: No, I can't worry about this right now. We gotta find Stacy and my kid!",
        "Oliver: Trust me; I want to find her as much as you do.",
        "Schuyler: Why? Why is it so personal for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Maybe we should give her, what do you call it, mouth to mouth.",
        "Gigi: She's breathing, it's just, I don't know, it doesn't seem like it's enough.",
        "Stacy: Well, we have to do something!",
        "Gigi: We have to get her to a hospital.",
        "Stacy: How? You just said the roads are blocked! They're not going to plow them for days! There's no phones or no cell service.",
        "Gigi: Stacy, let me think!",
        "Stacy: We can't just sit around here and let her die!",
        "Gigi: I'm not going to let anybody die. I'm going to bundle her up and I'm going to walk her down to the main road.",
        "Stacy: Not without me, you're not.",
        "Gigi: You just gave birth, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Stacy: [Sighs] It's just that she's so helpless.",
        "Gigi: She's not. She has me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad? What happened between you and T\u00e9a?",
        "Todd: I like this hallway here, the look of it. What do you call this thing? It's not block, or--",
        "Starr: Tell me.",
        "Todd: Uh, she said that she couldn't live with me anymore.",
        "Starr: Because of Dani?",
        "Todd: Yeah. She's afraid that Dani was going to think that she was choosing me over her.",
        "Starr: So? She still loves you.",
        "Todd: I know. But I kinda get the feeling--",
        "Starr: Dad...",
        "Todd: This is really nice stuff.",
        "Starr: Dad.",
        "Todd: My house would benefit from this kind of look. The way it is now, it's just a... I have nowhere else to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: [Kiss] I love you, Sierra Rose.",
        "Gigi: I'm going to take really good care of her. I'm going to send someone for you.",
        "Stacy: Don't worry about me. Just take her.",
        "[Sierra Rose fussing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Look, I'm a cop, Schuyler, okay? It's my job to take care of people.",
        "Rex: Really, Fish? 'Cause I don't think so. It seems like Stacy and her baby mean something to you.",
        "[Vehicle approaching]",
        "Kim: Schuy? Schuyler!",
        "Schuyler: Kim, what are you doing here?",
        "Kim: I need to know what the hell is going on. Schuy, where's my girl?",
        "Schuyler: There's no word on Stacy.",
        "Marty: Where are John and Natalie?",
        "Oliver: We're still searching.",
        "Marty: Is that where the car went off the road?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, yeah, careful, careful. Ground could give way.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God.",
        "Oliver: Listen, I searched the car myself, okay? There were no bodies there. They got out, I'm sure of it.",
        "Marty: Then where are they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It's just the way things are. You're still mourning your husband and I'm involved with someone else. We shouldn't be even having this conversation.",
        "Natalie: You're right. Except... I feel something for you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Now why would Dorian fire Bo Buchanan and replace him with a sleaze like Lowell? It doesn't make sense.",
        "Adriana: Hmm, which is why I called her at home and asked her that point blank.",
        "Kelly: What did she say?",
        "Adriana: Did you know that Bo and Nora are having an affair?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "Adriana: David?",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Adriana: Okay. I mean, yes, fine. Suspend Bo, but don't hire Lowell. There's gotta be something in it for her.",
        "Kelly: Well, she did support his campaign.",
        "Adriana: Well, until he was arrested. Ugh, and then to make him the commissioner of police.",
        "Kelly: I think it's personal.",
        "Adriana: Ugh. Don't even go there. No, no. There's gotta be something going on that we don't know about. Why destroy her reputation? That's what's happening. The papers are all over it.",
        "Kelly: Maybe she didn't have a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You heard that! He's threatening my girls!",
        "Mitch: Ah, I'm merely pointing out the vagaries of life, Dorian. And how distraught you would be if something happed to a loved one.",
        "Dorian: You heard that! That is a direct threat!",
        "Mitch: And when you and your hired gun shot my innocent daughter?",
        "Dorian: That was an accident. Jessica would be home safe and sound now if you hadn't dragged her off. You have nobody but yourself to blame.",
        "Mitch: And when one of your beloved girls is fighting for her life, whose fault will that be...Dorian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Brody, are you all right?",
        "Brody: Yes, ma'am, I'm fine.",
        "Viki: Do you need to see a doctor?",
        "Brody: No, ma'am.",
        "Clint: Brody, what happened at the observatory?",
        "Brody: Get the hell away from her, Laurence!",
        "Brody: Um, I didn't really get a chance to talk to Jessica before.",
        "Clint: Yeah, but before all of that, when you got there, how was she and what was going on?",
        "Brody: When I got there, I had to get the jump on Mitch and surprise him, and I did. And Jess, she'd been drugged. And so she wasn't really aware of her surroundings. But I got there on time. You want to know about the gunshot. That came later.",
        "Viki: Brody, we know what Mitch Laurence is capable of, okay? I know you want to protect us. You don't have to.",
        "Clint: It's all right, son. You can tell us the truth.",
        "Viki: Please, for Jessie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm married, you know. I mean, I love my husband. It doesn't matter that he's gone, he's still my husband.",
        "John: I know.",
        "Natalie: It's just, the past couple of weeks, you have come back into my life in a way that's--",
        "John: That's not real.",
        "Natalie: What do you mean?",
        "John: Ahh. It's just extraordinary circumstances. Look at us, look at where we are. Seems like every time we turn around, there's always something there. It's not a car chase, it's a shoot-out or an explosion. In moments like that, people will do or say things they normally wouldn't.",
        "Natalie: So you're saying what we're feeling...",
        "John: It's a reaction. To this whole crazy time.",
        "Natalie: Except I fe-- I felt this way before. And so have you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Careful, careful, it's slippery.",
        "Kim: I take it you never made it to the cabin?",
        "Schuyler: No.",
        "Kim: Okay, so you haven't talked to Gigi.",
        "Schuyler: No, but before you get too excited...",
        "Kim: Hey, as long she doesn't know that Rex isn't the father.",
        "Schuyler: Rex knows.",
        "Kim: What do you mean?",
        "Schuyler: He knows he's not the father, I am.",
        "Kim: How? How does he know, Schuyler?!",
        "Schuyler: Because I told him!",
        "Kim: Take that back!",
        "Schuyler: I told him everything, okay? I told him about Stacy's miscarriage, I told him about how she drugged me, how she tried to pass--",
        "Kim: And he believed you?",
        "Schuyler: Yes, of course he believed me. It's the truth, Kim.",
        "Kim: [Sighs] We've gotta find her. If Rex finds Stacy first, he'll kill her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi! What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: [Breathing heavily] Okay, Sierra. We're halfway there, baby girl. It's just with all this snow, everything looks so different. It's gotta be this way. Aah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Brody, whatever you walked in on, we have to know.",
        "Brody: You don't need to know the details, trust me.",
        "Viki: Wrong, we do need to know the details. You know Jessica's history. You know what can happen to her if some awful truth stays buried.",
        "Clint: We appreciate you trying to spare us.",
        "Viki: If we don't know the details, we cannot help her face whatever it is.",
        "Clint: Son, we need to know, no matter how ugly.",
        "Brody: Oh, it was ugly. Uh, Mitch had her on the bed, he knocked her out, and he was about to rape her.",
        "Viki: Oh, my...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What are you talking about? My girls are not fighting for their lives. They are perfectly safe.",
        "Mitch: Are you sure about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: My mother never does anything she doesn't want to.",
        "Kelly: True.",
        "Adriana: Why do you think I'm in Paris? Dorian always comes first. It gets kind of old.",
        "Kelly: Well, there has to be a reason she would hire Lowell. I mean, after what he did to Starr and Hope, after what Mitch tried to do to Cassie...",
        "Adriana: Oh, that rape attempt?",
        "Kelly: Yeah! That is something Dorian will never forgive him for, so why let him go? Unless she had to.",
        "Adriana: But she's the mayor, it's her call. Unless Mitch got to her somehow.",
        "Kelly: I'm just saying, it's not adding up. Why would Dorian let either one of them walk? It's not like they're going to thank her. And I'm sure Lowell is already planning to run against her. And Mitch?",
        "Adriana: Could be anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm. Dorian : Look at you, Mitch. Shackled, defeated. My girls have nothing to fear. I am in control!",
        "Mitch: What's that saying about the spider and the fly?",
        "Dorian: Stop talking!",
        "Mitch: [Chuckles] Well, I might as well. Nothing I say is going to please you.",
        "Dorian: Who do you think you're playing with?",
        "Mitch: Oh, Dorian. I never play at anything when the death of a loved one is concerned.",
        "Dorian: You heard him!",
        "Second agent: Ma'am, I have to insist you put the gun down!",
        "Third agent: Drop it, lady, or we drop you. Ma'am, remember your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Enough about Mitch. I want some dirt. Are you seeing anyone?",
        "Adriana: Not really. Although, French men do have a certain...je ne sais quoi.",
        "Kelly: It's so nice to see some things never change.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Kelly: You do remember I went to boarding school here.",
        "Adriana: Ah, until you were expelled.",
        "Kelly: I learned what was important. Okay, so talk to cousin Kelly. Now I know it's not all work, work, work.",
        "Adriana: I've had some dates. Nothing memorable.",
        "Kelly: Please tell me you're not still hung up on the whole Rex Balsom thing.",
        "Adriana: It's just going to take someone very special.",
        "Kelly: Okay, so you really loved the guy.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm. Till his high school sweetheart showed up, and then that was that.",
        "Kelly: Gigi somebody.",
        "Adriana: Ugh, Gigi Morasco. Totally blindsided me. Which, of course, made me give her my right hook.",
        "Kelly: Ah, so she brought out the best in you.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Kelly: Boarding school, remember?",
        "Adriana: That's why you were expelled?",
        "Kelly: Among other reasons.",
        "Adriana: Ha ha!",
        "Kelly: Okay, back to Rex. I take it he and Gigi are married?",
        "Adriana: Well, according to my friend Layla, they split up.",
        "Kelly: Oh, why?",
        "Adriana: He's having a baby with her sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm so sorry, Dad.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Yeah, I really thought we had a shot this time.",
        "Starr: Maybe you still do.",
        "Todd: No, it's over. This is the second time she's dumped me in 2010, and it's only February. [Chuckles] I guess I should be happy that she didn't run off to Tahiti.",
        "Starr: Hey, you never know what's going to happen.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I do. T\u00e9a and I are over for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I asked you a question. What are you doing here and where is Gigi?",
        "Stacy: Rex, I had the baby.",
        "Rex: No, that's not possible. Schuyler said you weren't due for another month. Unless Schuyler's lying and it is my kid.",
        "Stacy: Rex, I swear.",
        "Rex: No! You know what, I don't want to hear it. You would just lie to me again. The truth is you lost our baby, and then you got pregnant again. This time it is Schuyler's kid.",
        "Stacy: She has a name. It's Sierra Rose. What do you think just happened here?",
        "Rex: You could have set all this up.",
        "Stacy: Why? I didn't know you were coming. Okay, look at me. Okay, she was just born just a little while ago.",
        "Rex: Okay, so where is she, this baby you had all on your own.",

        "Kim: If he does, it's on you. Why the hell did you have to go and tell him? We were almost home free.",
        "Schuyler: Because he went looking through--he went looking through my backpack in the car and he found a copy of the will naming me as guardian.",
        "Kim: So?",
        "Schuyler: So he's not stupid, Kim. He figured it out, and I explained the rest to him.",
        "Kim: I knew that will was a mistake.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, you know what, it doesn't even matter right now. It's over. It's done. The only thing that matters is that we have find Stacy. 'Cause she's out there somewhere carrying my kid.",

        "Kim: You know what, she's the one who's been carrying around this stupid kid for almost 9 months, getting stretch marks and swollen ankles, and who knows what else. Not to mention labor. Which if men had to give birth, would be outlawed. So don't go telling me how you're the father, okay. You're just the donor, Schuy. That's it.",
        "Oliver: Schuyler, you still up for looking for Stacy?",

        "Marty: Not without John and Natalie. Even if they survived that explosion, they're probably seriously injured. They could be lying in the snow somewhere.",

        "Natalie: You know what, you're right. This is weird timing, you know. If Jared hadn't died, we wouldn't even be here. And obviously I have a screw loose if I could look you straight in the eye and think that you were Jared. So I guess, yeah, I am. I'm still mourning. And, you know, you're involved with someone.

        "Clint: So he shot her.",
        "Brody: No, I'm sorry. This was before.",
        "Viki: Wait a minute, you mean Mitch didn't shoot her?",

        "Adriana: Yeah, last I heard.",

It was about the pioneers. And they used to drive their wagons across ice. And if that ice could hold a team of horses, it can hold us.",
