        "Marcie: Where is it?",
        "Michael: Where is what?",
        "Marcie: His crib. And -- and his toys, Michael -- what happened to Tommy's things?",

        "Todd: You haven't heard any news about it?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Todd: Uh -- Nora requested zero bail and the judge set it at $1 million.",

        "Todd: No, she's out.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, \"She's out\"? She doesn't have that kind of money, neither do the McBain.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but I do. I bailed her out.",

        "Antonio: As do I.",
        "Bo: But I want us all to be clear on our fraternization policy, okay? Whatever your relationship is outside this office, as long as you're on duty, I want you to keep it outside. You got it?",
        "Lindsay: Hey! Oh, I'm sorr-- I didn't mean to interrupt. You know what? I'm just going to leave this here. I saw your dry-cleaning ticket on the kitchen cabinet and I just thought I would pick it up for you. We are on for the \"Go Red\" ball tonight, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Everyone has their secrets, right?",

        "Natalie: Did you find Allison?",
        "Jessica: Oh, uh -- you obviously didn't, either.",
        "Natalie: Oh, okay, that psycho. You know, first she tricks you into breaking out of St. Ann's and then she disappears. Jessica, this was not one of your better ideas.",
        "Jessica: Okay, Natalie, she knows something. She knows something really, really important, and I know now more than ever after finding that hole in the wall in the mausoleum, okay, it's about our family. I know it.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, we'll never know what it is if we don't find her.",

        "Allison: I need somewhere to hide.",
        "Roxy: You can't hide here. I've got a business to run.",
        "Allison: Got any better ideas?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I got a much better idea -- how about if you go far, far away like west of the Mississippi or something like that, where nobody can find you? Okay, go, go --",
        "Allison: I'm not going anywhere, and neither are you.",
        "Roxy: Just what are you planning to do?",

        "Lindsay: \"Date\"? Oh, I didn't mean to imply that we had a date. I mean, it's not a date -- we're going to the ball. I'm going to the ball, Bo's going to the ball.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: Sounds like a date to me.",

        "Nora: Oh -- Lindsay. I wanted to talk to you about Marcie McBain's case. Todd's posted bail for her and the more I think about it, the more I --",
        "Man: Same here. The more I think about it, the more stunned I am she was even granted bail.",
        "Bo: Mayor Lowell.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Why is Marcie McBain back on the streets?",
        "Nora: Well, her bail was set prohibitively high.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Not high enough. I went on the record with this community assuring them that she would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.",
        "Nora: It's just a bail hearing. When the case goes to trial --",
        "Mayor Lowell: When the case goes to trial, we may have a new D.A. prosecuting.",

        "Shane: What were you doing working at the Paris cafe, then?",
        "Viki: Same as your mom.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. We're the same, all right, except you live in a mansion with a 12-car garage.",
        "Viki: Don't hold it against me, please.",

        "Rex: Yeah, he's a cute kid.",
        "Adriana: He is. Well, now that you know he's not yours, you can concentrate on your own situation.",

        "Rex: Hey, you guys! Nattie, I got to talk to you.",
        "Natalie: Really? Maybe about something weird I heard at my mother's -- about her boyfriend, Charlie, being your dad?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: It's kind of incredible -- yeah -- but true.",
        "Natalie: Wow.",
        "Jessica: Uh -- I'm sorry to do this, but I -- can you guys talk about this later here?",
        "Rex: Oh -- sure. Yeah, it's pretty meaningless anyway. I mean, I just finally found out who my father was -- no biggie.",
        "Jessica: Rex, I'm sorry, okay? I know it's important and it is a really big deal, but Natalie and I were just in the middle of something.",
        "Natalie: Rex, I'm sorry. You know what? I'll -- I'll call you because I really want to hear more about this -- much, much more.",

        "Jared: Dude, did I just hear you right? Did you just say Charlie Balsom is your father?",
        "Rex: Yeah. What's it to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So maybe we should check out the places that Mitch used to hang out, like the Lion's Heart or that old cabin in the woods.",
        "Natalie: Here's an idea -- why don't we let Uncle Bo know that we've let a maniac loose into this world?",
        "Jessica: But -- oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Why don't you give me those clippers and I'll give you a sweet little mullet -- free of charge?",

        "Allison: Okay, okay, okay. Let him in, but get rid of him! I'll be on the other side of the wall.",
        "Roxy: Whew. Hey, Nash, what's up?",
        "Nash: What's up? What's up with you? What are you doing closed in the middle of the day?",
        "Roxy: Well, I just wanted to be alone. I felt like I needed to meditate.",
        "Nash: Uh-huh.",
        "Roxy: You know, I have to get my blood sugar level down.",
        "Nash: Yeah, but you're not alone.",
        "Roxy: I'm not?",
        "Nash: No, you're not. I saw you come in here with another woman -- where is she? Wait, where is that woman? Where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Mike? Mike, where are -- where are his clothes and his toys? Just -- where are they? Answer me.",
        "Michael: I boxed them up for charity.",
        "Marcie: Why?",
        "Michael: I just --",
        "Michael: I did it -- I did it for you so that you wouldn't be reminded of --",
        "Marcie: Of Tommy? What did you think? You thought that I -- I could forget our son?",
        "Michael: What? No, of course not. I -- I just thought it might help.",
        "Marcie: My God, Mike? Michael, there's not even -- there's not even a trace of him here! Michael, do you understand? I wanted to -- I wanted to see his crib and his highchair and his clothes and I -- I wanted to touch that little frog, that little stuffed frog that he loves so much, even if it was for three seconds! I just wanted to see it and \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You hate Marcie. You go on and on how much you want her to suffer for what she did to you and then you post bail for her?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I -- I was blackmailed into it.",
        "Blair: Blackmailed by?",
        "Todd: McBain.",
        "Blair: Which McBain?",
        "Todd: John.",
        "Blair: Why -- what did you do?",
        "Todd: Uh, what would you like, the short version or --",
        "Blair: I want the whole story, Todd -- from the beginning, please.",
        "Todd: Are you sure? Because, uh, after I tell you this, you may not want to have this marriage continue much longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I don't know what's the matter with me. I forgot -- I got a new trainee here and she's trying out some smocks.",
        "Nash: All right, whatever. That's great, I'm glad you're here. I need a favor from you -- can you take Bree just for a little while?",
        "Roxy: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not good with kids.",
        "Nash: You -- you're great with kids. Watch -- hey, Bree, do you want to stay with Roxy for a little while?",
        "[Bree babbles]",
        "Nash: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah -- you see? She's smiling, she's smiling.",
        "Roxy: Such a cutie.",
        "Nash: Yes, she is. She loves you.",
        "Roxy: But, you know, I'm just swamped.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- okay. Okay, but, look -- I've got a meeting I'm late for. I got to meet Jared and this bottle distributor over at the diner. I -- I'm super late. I've been looking for Jessica everywhere. Please, it'll be half-hour, half-hour maximum -- maximum. Promise -- okay? Here.",
        "Roxy: You know, the good thing is, is that she's very calm --",
        "Nash: Yes!",
        "Roxy: Because usually kids get agitated when they take a look at my hair.",
        "Nash: Totally. She loves you, she loves you. Thank you! I owe you one -- I'll send you a case of my best chardonnay.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but, Nash, Nash --",
        "Nash: Love you. Bye, bye!",

        "[Door closes]",
        "Roxy: Oh.",
        "Allison: Is that Tessica's baby?",
        "Roxy: You know, it figures that Nash would bolt when this kid needs a change of diaper.",
        "Allison: Oh, here, hand her over.",
        "Roxy: No, no, no, no!",
        "Allison: Why?",
        "Roxy: No, not on your life!",
        "Allison: I know what I'm doing! I'm very good at changing babies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Natalie? You cannot tell Uncle Bo about Allison, because if he finds her before we do, we'll never get to know the secret.",
        "Natalie: If there even is a secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Do you know Charlie?",
        "Jared: I -- I was just thinking about Natalie.",
        "Rex: And what's she got to do with it?",
        "Jared: Well, she's your sister, right? I mean, at least you guys were brought up together.",
        "Rex: I'm still not getting the connection here.",
        "Jared: I saw Natalie's reaction to hearing that this Charlie guy was your dad. It seemed to do a number on her.",
        "Rex: Maybe you shouldn't care so much.",
        "Jared: Whew.",
        "Nash: Hey, sorry I'm late.",
        "Jared: Oh, no, it's cool. The bottle guy has not shown up yet.",
        "Nash: Oh, all right. Well, let's get a table and I'll -- hey! Whoa! Jessica, I've been looking all over you.",
        "Jessica: Uh, I -- I had some things that I had to take care of.",
        "Nash: Really?",

        "Natalie: Uh -- we went to our mother's.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Uh, so -- got to go.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- no, hold on. What are you two up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, Allison, I don't know how you got out of St. Ann's, but a lot of people are going to be looking for you, so you better blow this place.",
        "Allison: When I'm ready. Ooh, isn't she precious? She looks like Jessica when she was born. You certainly look like a Buchanan. Oh, but wait -- she couldn't be. Not if Jessica isn't one.",
        "Roxy: The kid's a Brennan. That's her father's name -- Nash Brennan.",
        "Allison: Makes all the difference in the world, doesn't it -- who someone's father is? Wouldn't you agree?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: The guy's flight was canceled, says he needs to reschedule.",
        "Nash: Huh. Nice of him to call.",

        "Natalie: Actually, Jess and I -- you know, we've -- we've got something to do, so --",
        "Nash: Really? Like what?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- like get a dress for the ball tonight, for one. Huh.",
        "Natalie: Yep.",
        "Nash: No, you don't. Ah -- I was going to save it as a surprise until we got home, but you remember that red dress at Logan's -- the one you thought would be perfect for the ball? I got it for you.",
        "Jessica: I -- can't believe you did that.",
        "Nash: Well, so, since my meeting's been canceled and you don't have to go shopping, what do you say we go home now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Nora made the strongest case possible against bail for Marcie McBain. No one could've seen it coming.",
        "Mayor Lowell: This is one of the highest profile cases we've had in this town since Daniel Colson -- another case that you were involved with, madam D.A.",
        "Nora: Um -- with all due respect, Sir, I don't believe we should be having this conversation in front of, um, a civilian.",
        "Lindsay: Oh -- I'm sorry. I'll wait out here.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Mayor Lowell: You can't drop the ball with this case the way you did at the bail hearing, Nora. You're going to bring in a conviction.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Why is it impossible that Charlie is Rex's father? Do you know Rex?",
        "Shane: He's a friend of mom's.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Rex and I went to high school together back in Michigan.",
        "Viki: That's amazing!",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm. He told me his father's name was Wally, and he was dead.",
        "Charlie: Well, that's who he thought his dad was.",
        "Shane: Then how could it be you?",
        "Gigi: Shane -- are you going to watch that movie that you conned me into downloading, or what?",
        "Shane: Oh, yeah, I forgot. Look, Charlie, check this out. Isn't it cool? Mr. McBain let me borrow his video mp3 player.",
        "Charlie: Whoa!",
        "[Charlie laughs]",
        "Gigi: Um -- ahem -- ahem. What?",
        "Charlie: So, Rex's mom and I were -- well, we were together for -- it was just one night, and she never told me that -- oh, and -- and I just found out that Rex was my son.",
        "Gigi: Oh, okay. So his mom just -- she's never told you that she was pregnant and she had your kid?",
        "Charlie: No, she didn't. So, what are you doing here in Llanview, Gigi?",
        "Viki: You know, I -- I tried to call you.",
        "Gigi: I -- I know --",
        "Viki: I was worried about you.",
        "Gigi: I know. Um -- John McBain got me out of there and brought me here to help Marcie. I hope you understand.",
        "Viki: Of course!",
        "Gigi: I -- I thought you would, since you wouldn't testify against Marcie. I was so relieved because she's -- she's a really good friend of mine.",
        "Viki: Gigi, I've known Marcie for years, and I feel terrible about what happened to her and what she went through.",
        "Gigi: But your brother ended up with little Tommy -- or whatever he calls him now. I guess that makes you happy, huh?",
        "Viki: Look, Todd is difficult, to say the least -- I know that -- but there's also a side to him that other people don't see and I do. He's a wonderful father, he adores his children. And I kind of think that, deep down underneath, if he wanted to be, he -- he could be a good person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What did you do?",
        "Todd: Uh -- I held someone hostage in Texas.",
        "Blair: Hostage?",
        "Todd: Yeah -- Gigi Morasco and her child? Uh, we -- we knew that Gigi was friends with Marcie, so we used Gigi to set a trap for Marcie --",
        "Blair: Okay, wait, wait, wait -- who is \"we,\" who you talking about?",
        "Todd: Ramsey and me.",
        "Blair: Oh, God.",
        "Todd: I wanted that kid back and, of course, that's all I could think about. And Ramsey wouldn't let it go, and so he threatened Gigi not to tell anyone what we did to her.",
        "Blair: But let me guess -- Gigi told John?",
        "Todd: Yes, and John cut a deal with me. Uh -- and so far as I would do whatever I could to help Marcie out, he would make sure that whatever I did to Gigi and her kid would go away.",
        "Blair: And you accepted the deal and paid off the bail?",
        "Todd: Well, according to Ramsey, that is still no guarantee that Gigi or her kid won't squeal.",
        "Blair: Is that why Ramsey came by here -- to ask for more money?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: What?",

        "Marcie: Did you expect me to pretend like Tommy never happened?",
        "Michael: No, of course not, Marcie. Of course Tommy happened, all right, and he will live in our hearts forever, but we have got to start letting go.",
        "Marcie: How? Mike, I mean, you -- you seem to have been able to do that, but how do I do that? I don't know how to do that.",
        "Michael: I don't know -- maybe part of it was packing up his things -- I shouldn't have taken that away from you.",
        "Marcie: Wait, wait, wait, where are you going?",
        "Michael: I left the boxes down with Roxy for pickup and maybe nobody has gotten them yet. If they're still there, I'll bring them back up, and then we can go through them together and we can pick out some things that we might want to keep.",

        "Roxy: Yeah, like Jessica would ever bring up that freakazoid to her own kid?",
        "Allison: I suppose not. She'd probably kill to forget that family tie -- or at least die to.",

        "Blair: Why didn't you tell me any of this?",
        "Todd: Because I figured that he wouldn't try anything like this because he's F.B.I. And then I was talking to Jack last night and, you know, we were talking about my past and he said, \"Daddy, would you ever do anything bad again? Would you ever do anything bad to me or any other child?\" And it got me thinking, well, I haven't done anything to stop Ramsey, so -- isn't that a threat to Gigi and her kid?",
        "Blair: Is that -- is that why you ran out so fast last night?",
        "Todd: I -- uh -- I tracked down Ramsey.",

        "Todd: And I tackled him -- and the gun went off.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: And I don't know what happened. Next thing I know, John McBain shows up, of course, and -- and then Bo and a small army of police officers. And Ramsey says, \"It's Todd's fault,\" and Bo arrests me and --",

        "Todd: Well, nothing, according to John. He says he has my back -- I held up my end of the bargain.",
        "Blair: By paying Marcie's bail?",
        "Todd: Yeah, and I made a very convincing speech about Marcie -- ahem -- in the arraignment. I just -- it made me sick. I almost threw up my breakfast. But nothing that I could say there is as hard as what I'm saying to you now. I let you down again. I put you and the kids in danger again. I thought it was going to be different this time -- apparently not. This is the deal breaker, isn't it?",

        "Michael: Well, no, we can bring her with us -- it'll only take a couple of minutes.",
        "Roxy: No, no. You know, I got this trainee here and, you know -- oh, honey -- we're doing coloring and stuff like that, and timing is everything because red can turn to orange in, like, two minutes -- like that.",
        "Michael: Well, just give me her and I'll -- I'll wait here.",
        "Roxy: No, no, no! No, no, listen -- uh -- hang on here a second. You know, I think I got that key -- oh, honey -- I got the key -- here you go.",

        "Gigi: Oh, thanks, but I don't think I can.",
        "Viki: Well, if you're worried about baby-sitting, I know that Shane can stay with my friend Nora's son, Matthew. He's a little bit older than you are, Shane, but he's extremely cool, and I know he'd love the company.",
        "Gigi: Hmm -- thanks, but I don't think so. You know, I -- I didn't pack my ball wardrobe.",

Look, I -- I'm not happy about what you did with that woman and -- and that boy, but I know how desperate you were, and I know that you wouldn't have that little boy right here in this kitchen now if you hadn't have done some of the things that you had to do. But I know how painful all of it was for you. Todd, look at me. So when you say that this is over, I don't see it that way.
