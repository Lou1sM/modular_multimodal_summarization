        "Dorian: Oh! I am so proud of these goody bags -- everything you need to stay healthy and look good, and all of it is red! Ta-da! Wait a minute. I don't -- I'm not sure I saw the lipstick. Lipsticks, lipsticks, lipsticks. Honey, please, would you check?",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Dorian: Check in the bottom of the bags. These lipsticks are supposed to be in there.",
        "Starr: Yeah, sure.",
        "Dorian: Ah. You should feel so proud; we're doing everything we can to promote healthy hearts.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it's really great.",
        "Dorian: Speaking of hearts -- yours does seem to be rather heavy.",
        "Starr: That's because it's being ripped into a million pieces by my boyfriend and my best friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Oh, wow. Langston, this is awesome. Seriously, how did you learn how to do all this stuff?",

        "Rex: No, completely unnecessary.",
        "Langston: What? We have to have music.",
        "Rex: And we will. I -- I am personally guaranteeing that this will be the most super Sweet 16 party Llanview has ever seen. I hired Mary J. Blige to perform.",

        "Rex: You're welcome.",

        "Blair: Well, why are you crying, sweetie?",
        "[Addie chuckles]",
        "Addie: You know that expression \"ignorance is bliss\"? Before I became enlightened, I didn't know I was missing anything. I've never been in love.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: My God, how could this have happened? I mean, it's frightening to think of that woman being on the loose.",
        "Natalie: What's going on?",
        "Viki: Honey, Allison Perkins has escaped from St. Ann's.",
        "Natalie: How did you know about that?",
        "Bo: Because the director called me. He wanted to keep the information in-house until they were sure that Allison wasn't hiding on the grounds somewhere.",
        "Viki: I mean, there -- there's no one guarding that place? How -- how would she get past security?",
        "Bo: She had help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Where's our daughter, Roxy?",

        "Layla: Yeah, it'll only take me about two minutes.",
        "Talia: Thanks.",
        "Layla: You're welcome.",
        "Adriana: Besides, friends don't let friends go to a black-tie affair without looking anything less than a million bucks.",
        "Layla: Yes, that's right, and you know what? Before we start getting all dolled up, how about we have a glass of wine?",
        "Adriana: Ooh.",
        "Layla: We have time, don't we?",

        "Adriana: Yeah, sure.",
        "Layla: Girl, are you feeling down about something? Gigi's son?",
        "Adriana: No, not anymore. I told Rex about it and he confronted Gigi and she told him that Shane isn't his son, and he believed her.",
        "Layla: Do you?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. I mean, who am I to say that she's lying?",
        "Layla: I hope she's not. That would really complicate your lives, right?",

        "Lindsay: Oh, my gosh, we are doing amazing. I mean, we are doing incredible. The people have been so generous -- we've made more than we expected already.",
        "Vincent: Hmm -- a lot of people have secrets, huh?",
        "[Vincent laughs]",
        "Antonio: Now, you know, it's easy to spill them when you know they'll all be destroyed.",
        "Vincent: Ah.",
        "Lindsay: Good point. Hmm.",
        "Cristian: All right, breather's over. What -- what do you say you guys get the rest of the boxes?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Are you sure you're not being overly sensitive?",
        "Starr: Oh, you know what? You're right -- I am and it's completely my problem that Cole and Langston are probably out having an amazing time tonight while I'm stuffing V8 Fusions in the gift bags, but I should definitely give them the benefit of the doubt, shouldn't I?",
        "Dorian: Yes, you should -- especially since both those young people have had terrible tragedies.",
        "Starr: I'm so tired of feeling for them! I'm sorry. Look, that -- that sounded awful and I do, I feel bad for them, but am I supposed to ignore the fact that they're cheating on me?",
        "Dorian: You don't know that for sure.",
        "Starr: Oh, right, and I'm wrong -- just like you were wrong about Clint and Nora.",

        "Cole: Ooh.",
        "Markko: Dude!",
        "Cole: Hey, listen, I hope you didn't put too much stress into that because we don't need it.",
        "Markko: Why?",
        "Langston: We don't need it because we got Mary J. Blige for tonight.",
        "Markko: You're kidding.",
        "Langston: No! She's singing here tonight!",
        "Cole: Yeah, thanks to Rex.",
        "Rex: Yeah. You can pay me back when you're fat-cat C.E.O.s. In the meantime, obey club rules, don't break any laws.",
        "Langston: No problem.",
        "Cole: Hey, we owe you one.",
        "Rex: Have a great time, but I've got a different party to go to. Call me on my cell if you need me!",
        "Langston: Okay, okay, so the plan. Everybody's going to hide behind these monitors.",
        "Cole: Uh-huh.",
        "Langston: I'm going to bring Starr inside, and then --",
        "Markko: I give the signal and we do the \"surprise\" thing.",
        "Cole: Wait, wait, wait -- are you sure that's it? You sure there's nothing we have to do before Starr gets here?",
        "Markko: Oh, well, there's something you can do -- you can get that lipstick off your collar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay. Is there anything else you need, Shane, before I take off?",
        "Shane: Are you kidding? Matthew's got, like, everything in the world here.",
        "Matthew: Huh -- except that one video game.",
        "Charlie: Well, Matthew, thank you for being such a gracious host.",
        "Matthew: Oh, no problem. Um -- Nigel's here if you need anything to eat or drink or whatever.",
        "Shane: Awesome.",

        "Jared: What -- what? What is it you want?",

        "Jared: Oh, okay, great. Now you can leave.",
        "Charlie: Look, Jared -- ahem -- since it's just the two of us face to face --",
        "Jared: Okay, if this is about you telling the world that you're Rex Balsom's father, I already know -- no idea what it's about but, hey, better him than me, so \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Wow, somebody helped Allison escape? That's awful. I mean, who -- who would do such a thing?",
        "Viki: My first guess would be one of Mitch's disciples.",
        "Bo: Probably.",
        "Natalie: Any leads?",
        "Bo: No, not yet, but we're not going to take any chances with this woman. She's already hurt too many people.",
        "Gigi: Hi.",
        "Viki: Hey, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Is everything all right?",
        "Viki: Well -- Natalie, this is Gigi Morasco. We worked together in Texas.",

        "Gigi: Oh, I'm sorry. I -- I'm in the way here.",
        "Viki: Bo, honey, you are so not in the way -- no, not at all. It's just that this woman who has done my family a great deal of harm has unfortunately escaped from a mental institution.",
        "Bo: And we'll find her, Viki. We will do everything possible.",
        "Viki: I know.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Is she gorgeous or what?",

        "[Blair and Addie laugh]",
        "Blair: That's a plus.",
        "Addie: Anyway, self-pity is not on my to-do list.",

        "Cristian: Yeah -- why?",
        "Nora: Oh -- huh. Well, I know I wrote down a little secret and -- and I put it in the box at the diner. I just am looking forward to seeing it go up in flames, you know? It'll be liberating.",

        "Dorian: The situation with Clint and Nora was completely -- I mean, totally -- different.",
        "Starr: How?",
        "Dorian: Well, for one thing, Clint is unreliable and Nora has always been a backstabbing, conniving bitch.",
        "Starr: Uh -- well, tell me how you really feel.",
        "Dorian: I don't know Cole all that well, but I know Langston. She's a lovely person, sweetheart, and she would never, ever hurt her best friend.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and you're just a great judge of character.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: What is the big deal? I was excited about Mary J. Blige so I just gave Cole a hug.",
        "Markko: Oh, oh.",
        "Langston: Well, it's not coming out.",
        "Markko: Better change your shirt before Starr gets the wrong idea. Come on, I'm kidding, it's a joke. Lighten up.",
        "Langston: I'm not in a joking mood right now -- too many things could go wrong.",
        "Cole: Okay, okay, okay, but nothing's going to go wrong because we planned everything perfectly, all right? Just relax, you know? I -- I just can't wait to see Starr's face when she sees all of this.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, I better go home for my girls' night. I'll see you later.",

        "Natalie: Bo is on the case. So if anyone can find Allison --",
        "Jessica: Well, uh, keep me posted. I'll talk to you later. Hey, sweetheart -- hello! Oh, I missed you so much! Oh.",
        "Nash: So -- sorry, I don't get it. Well -- we had such a hard time getting you out of the hospital and there was nothing wrong with you. How did Allison get out so easily?",
        "Jessica: No idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Yeah, thanks. Got our first lead.",
        "Viki: Yeah?",
        "Bo: My people interviewed the staff at St. Ann's. Now, some of them mentioned two novice nuns that subsequently have disappeared. Now, considering everything that happened, we think those women were posing as nuns. They helped Allison sneak out.",

        "Charlie: Well, if you'd just let me explain --",
        "Jared: Okay, you know what? Save it, Charlie, because I figured you out. You're involved in a scam. You're pretending to be someone you're not to gain some kind of advantage.",

        "Langston: Well, I don't know exactly but I know it'll be fun and you and I haven't done anything together, just the two of us, in, like, forever. And plus, I was really looking forward to this -- spending the night with my best friend?",

        "Lindsay: Well, it's only a dollar for a good conscience-clearing. I mean, it's not a bad deal.",
        "Nora: I think it's a wonderful idea for a charity event. I just hope that people realize that just writing down a secret on a piece of paper and putting it in a box doesn't really heal their guilty conscience.",
        "Lindsay: Hmm. Such a cynic, Nora.",
        "Nora: I'm not being cynical. Well, I just believe that until you right the wrong you've committed or make amends to the people that you've hurt along the way, your guilty conscience will probably destroy you and the people that you love.",
