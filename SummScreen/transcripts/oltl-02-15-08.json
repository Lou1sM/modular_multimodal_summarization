        "Cole: Starr, you don't --",
        "Starr: Is that lipstick on your collar? Are you kidding me?",
        "Cole: Starr, you --",
        "Starr: You know what? Don't even answer that because I know what the answer is -- you two have been sneaking around!",
        "Langston: Starr, no.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah, and that he was just so grateful for you making today so special! I'm going to go inside and I'm going to get rid of these stupid tears! And I promise you that this is the last time that I will ever cry over either of you!",
        "Langston: No, Starr, wait -- guests: Surprise!",
        "Cole: Happy birthday, Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Nice tux, Todd. You check your rifle in the coat room?",
        "Todd: What happened? I figured certainly you'd be back in Texas by now. Did your welfare run out?",
        "Gigi: Hmm. I thought I'd give you a chance to prove yourself. You want to shoot me, right? Let's see you look me in the eye and pull the trigger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ah, this can't be good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Do you see Rex over there? Looks like he's in need of some parental guidance. Why don't you go play daddy with him?",
        "Charlie: Are you going to shut up and listen to me? Or do I have to make an announcement right now that you are not Jared Buchanan but that you are in fact my son, Jared Banks?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Mayor Lowell, how nice of you to join us.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Well, I've never been able to say no to Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Stan, have you met the newest Buchanan -- young Jared?",
        "Mayor Lowell: No, I -- I don't believe I have.",
        "Dorian: Would you like me to introduce you -- oh, dear. I had no idea the two of them knew each other so well. Did you, Viki?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: So what'll it be, Charlie, a side car or do you just want to --",
        "Charlie: Just cut the crap, Jared. I saw the way you re looking at Viki's daughter when she came in here.",
        "Jared: Natalie is none of your business.",
        "Charlie: No, you made her my business tonight. Look, I've been waiting around this town like a jackass claiming to be someone that I'm not, pretending that some other kid is my son, and it's all in an effort to let you pursue this crazy dream of becoming a Buchanan.",
        "Jared: You know, if you were ever a father to me, this whole noble sacrifice routine of yours might actually have some impact.",
        "Charlie: Damn it, Jared, I have no control over the past, but I do have some kind of control over what's happening here and now. You want to be Jared Buchanan, then you are going to be Natalie's uncle.",
        "Jared: Keep your voice down.",
        "Charlie: And no uncle ever looked at his niece the way you were looking at her tonight. Listen, are you trying to hurt that girl? Because I'm not going to let you hurt her. And if you ever look at her like that again, then I swear to God, I'm going to blow your little scam sky-high.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: When I said that Allison's escape was all my fault, I -- I meant it literally. I broke her out.",
        "Nash: Oh, don't tell me that.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm not going to lie to you.",
        "Nash: No, what you mean is you're not going to lie to me anymore, right? Right.",
        "Jessica: I had my reasons, Nash.",
        "Nash: Had your reasons? What reasons could you possibly have for breaking Allison Perkins out of jail? Am I wrong? Am I wrong or has Allison Perkins done more damage to your family than anyone on this planet? Tell me exactly what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Bo? I see that something's bothering you. I wish you would just tell me what it is.",
        "Bo: All right. Come on. I've got to tell Clint and Nora, too.",
        "Clint: Good evening, Bo.",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "Clint: Lindsay.",
        "Nora: Hi. Clint and I were just going to go dance.",
        "Bo: No, just wait one second, please. I hate to throw a wet blanket on everything, but you two need to know, Allison Perkins escaped from St. Ann's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: Lindsay Rappaport -- you go, girl. Uh -- you never told me she had her fangs in Bo.",
        "Roxy: It's news to me.",
        "Allison: You're slipping, Rox.",
        "Roxy: Listen, baby, you're on the lam and I think we better am-scray.",
        "Allison: Don't be a party pooper. We're not going anywhere.",
        "Roxy: Well, don't be a wacko. If they catch you, you're going to be back at St. Annie's.",
        "Allison: Not till I've had my fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So, every single time we hung out and you guys would shut up when I walked into the room, it was because you were planning this party, right?",
        "Cole: Pretty much.",
        "Starr: Cole, I'm so sorry. Do you guys hate me?",
        "Cole: No, of course not.",
        "Langston: We've just been planning this party ever since we found out we forgot your birthday.",
        "Starr: I can't believe that I would ever think that you guys would be hooking up together. Could you ever forgive me?",
        "Langston: I think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Oh, if she pisses him off --",
        "Adriana: She must know how dangerous Todd is.",
        "Rex: No, you don't know Gigi. She sees a fire, she runs for gasoline.",
        "Adriana: Well, look, if you think you need to bail her out --",
        "Rex: You wouldn't mind?",
        "Adriana: Nope, no.",
        "Vincent: Oh. Where's your boy off to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So what happened the other night? A little performance anxiety?",
        "Rex: Wouldn't be the first time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Have any idea what Allison's intentions are?",
        "Bo: Trying to figure it out. We may not know anything until she surfaces.",
        "Nora: Well, you should ask Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Nora: Well, you did collaborate on a jailbreak once before and you were just in St. Ann's with her.",
        "Lindsay: What the hell are you talking about? I never saw her at St. Ann's.",
        "Bo: Let's not do this now, all right? You two ought to call Nigel. He's trying to coordinate security at your house.",
        "Clint: That's what we'll do. See you later.",
        "Bo: Sorry about that.",
        "Lindsay: It's not Nora I'm worried about; it's Allison -- on the run after all these years.",
        "Bo: Sure knows how to kill a buzz, doesn't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Is this the way high society gets off? Just swaying and standing around?",
        "Antonio: That's why they drink.",
        "[Talia chuckles]",
        "Talia: Ahem.",
        "Bo: Did you two officers just happen to bump into each other, Talia?",
        "Antonio: Just -- just a coincidence, a pure coincidence.",
        "Talia: Yep.",
        "Bo: I need to talk to you two for a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Cole! Oh, man, I was just looking for you.",
        "Cole: Well, what's up? Why are you hyperventilating?",
        "Markko: All right. Mary J. Blige --",
        "Cole: What, she's here?",
        "Markko: Yeah, dude, she just got here. She's in the back getting ready. Oh, my God, I was so close to her.",
        "Cole: Well, what'd you say?",
        "Markko: Well, I wanted to say, \"hey, what's up, Mary J.? I'm, like, psyched that you're playing for us tonight and -- and I think you're awesome.\" But all that came out was, \"Hi\" and I'm not even sure that came out.",
        "Cole: Starr is going to freak when she finds out Mary J. is performing. She'll forget she was ever upset.",
        "Markko: Dude, we have to go see her. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hey, Mayor, excuse me. I see my niece. Excuse me. Sarah. Cristian. Hi, darling.",
        "Sarah: Hi.",
        "Viki: Rescue me from that woman.",
        "Sarah: Oh? Some things never change.",
        "Viki: That's true.",
        "Cristian: I heard you were in Texas.",
        "Viki: Yeah --",
        "Sarah: Yeah, for a really long time. We missed you, Aunt Viki.",
        "Viki: Well, thank you, darling. I missed you all, too, and it's good to be back.",
        "Sarah: I think it's pretty cool, you know? You're reinventing yourself.",
        "Viki: Darling, I took a page out of your book.",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "Natalie: Hi, guys.",
        "Viki: Natalie!",
        "Sarah: Hey.",
        "Viki: Honey, you decided to come. Are you feeling better?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, the headache just kind of went away.",
        "Viki: Oh, good, good, good.",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "Sarah: Hey.",
        "Cristian: You look great. Man, I'm telling you, all this red is --",
        "[Cristian whistles]",
        "Cristian: Nice.",
        "Viki: It's red.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Natalie: Um, I'm sorry, Mom. Can I speak to you for a minute?",
        "Viki: Sure.",
        "Sarah: We -- we got to scoot. I mean --",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Sarah: He needs to monopolize the play list.",
        "Cristian: Right, the band.",
        "Viki: Something lively -- please, lively.",
        "Sarah: Definitely.",
        "Cristian: Definitely.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "Viki: Everything all right?",
        "Natalie: No, actually. Um -- can we go somewhere to talk, or are you waiting for Charlie?",
        "Viki: No, actually, Charlie went off somewhere with your uncle.",
        "Natalie: Bo's right over there.",
        "Viki: Not that uncle -- the other uncle, Jared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Getting all moral on us, are you? Must be the new girly-friend",
        "Charlie: If you think I'm not serious, you are dead wrong.",
        "Jared: Oh, so, what? Well, you can -- you can lie like a dog to Viki, but when it comes to Natalie --",
        "Charlie: This is different!",
        "Jared: How? How is it different?",
        "Charlie: Are you trying to hurt this girl, hmm? I mean, are you getting your kicks out of torturing her?",
        "Jared: I would never hurt Natalie, never.",
        "Charlie: Well, then you've got a choice to make. You either tell her the truth or back off.",
        "Jared: If I do tell the truth --",
        "Charlie: Huh?",
        "Jared: It's going to be over between you and Viki. She's going to see you for exactly who you are.",
        "Charlie: Fine, that's a chance that I'm willing to take.",
        "Jared: Whoa, whoa, wait. So you're willing to sacrifice for me?",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Jared: That's touching, Dad. A tad late, but --",
        "Charlie: You still want to hate me? Fine. But you're my son, and whether you like it or not, I will try to protect you.",
        "Jared: Not.",
        "Charlie: Okay. Look, I don't approve of what you're doing here -- you know, lying to the Buchanans, trying to weasel your way in to their family. But I understand that this is something you feel you need to do. But you can't have it both ways, not with Natalie. Look, if you really care about her, you better tell her the truth. You owe her that much. You owe that to yourself.",
        "Jared: Where was this kind of concern when I needed it, huh? Were you so worried about what I was owed when you walked out of my life?",
        "Charlie: We can't go back, Jared.",
        "Jared: You can't. That's for sure, because then you might actually have to take responsibility for what you did.",
        "Charlie: But that wasn't my decision. Your mother asked me to leave.",
        "Jared: Oh, oh, oh, so you're the victim now, huh? You only do what you're told?",
        "Charlie: No, at that time, I was a drunk, and I did what I thought was the best thing for everyone.",
        "Jared: The best --",
        "Charlie: Yes.",
        "Jared: The best thing? To -- to abandon your family, to let that sadistic son of a bitch come into your house and raise your kids instead of you?",
        "Charlie: I didn't know.",
        "Jared: You're right, you didn't know. Why not, huh?",
        "Charlie: I --",
        "Jared: No, no, you know what? Don't answer that. I know the answer -- you didn't care.",
        "Charlie: No, that's not true, Jared!",
        "Jared: Oh, so -- so you let that -- the bastard come into our house and sleep in our mother's bed, but as long as you were off the hook, it was okay that he beat her up, that he beat us up?",
        "Charlie: No. She never told me! Nobody -- if somebody had just told -- Jared, I didn't know!",
        "Jared: You didn't care.",
        "Charlie: No, that's not true! You cannot accuse me of that. I did care! But I was an -- I am an alcoholic, and I was too busy hating myself to -- okay, never mind. This is -- it's not going to be about me.",
        "Jared: Oh, for a change.",
        "Charlie: Look, what I did to you, just leaving you to fend for yourselves, that -- that was inexcusable. But then, what happened --",
        "Jared: Oh, stop right there.",
        "Charlie: No, no, that was an accident, Jared.",
        "Jared: I will not talk to you about that. I will never talk to you about that. Understand?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared's with Charlie?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Apparently, they've discovered they have something in common. Anyway, I assume you want to talk to me about Allison.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Can we go somewhere private?",
        "Viki: Sure, sweetheart.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: So that's the famous Gigi?",
        "Adriana: That's her.",
        "Layla: I don't know, I imagined her blonder.",
        "Adriana: Gigi is Rex's ex-girlfriend from high school.",
        "Layla: Or maybe his baby's mama.",
        "Adriana: Layla!",
        "[Vincent laughs]",
        "Adriana: I already told you that that kid is not Rex's.",
        "Layla: It didn't sound like you believed it.",
        "Adriana: Well, I do. Gigi swore to it. Why did you even bring it up?",
        "Vincent: Whoa. Rex has a kid?",
        "Adriana: Vincent, you're not listening, okay? Yes, Gigi has a little boy, and he has -- he has nothing to do with Rex. Nothing, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I don't think that Allison's going to get very far, but I just wanted you two to know.",
        "Antonio: What can we do to help?",
        "Bo: Well, nothing really. Um -- I just want you to enjoy the evening.",
        "Antonio: Does Jessica know?",
        "Bo: We're watching her. She'll be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: The last time Allison had a secret, Ben ended up dead and my mother was almost killed. I am not going to let that woman torpedo my life again.",
        "Nash: And now she's wandering around out there on her own? And from what I've heard, if Allison wants to launch a torpedo, no one's going to get in her way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: If Antonio had his way, we'd have nothing but Latin bands.",
        "Sarah: Wow. I always knew Llanview had a lot of secrets.",
        "Cristian: That's right, and they're all in that box.",
        "Sarah: Oh, look at this one. It's beautiful. It's got some kind of inscription on it.",
        "Cristian: Hey, you know what? The music is picking up. Why don't we go dance? Come on.",
        "Sarah: No, wait. I want to read. \"They say that it hits you like a thunderstorm and I am drenched, like walking through a crowded room and knowing which one has your heart.\" Those are my lyrics. Someone took my -- you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Mind if I steal Vincent for a dance?",
        "Vincent: Oh.",
        "Layla: Girl, you better go and take your man back. That Gigi woman can fight her own damn battles. Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Does Adriana know about your little waitress friend here?",
        "Gigi: I'm nobody's waitress. The only man in my life is my son, and if you do anything to hurt him in any way, I'll get a gun, too, and I won't miss.",
        "Todd: I actually believe you. But I don't want you to worry about it because I'm not the one to worry about. The only man to worry about in this room is Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So when is this big celebration?",
        "Nora: Yeah, when do we get to burn all these secrets, Lindsay?",
        "Lindsay: At midnight.",
        "Bo: I hope that fire is hot. If the thing fizzles out, there's going to be a lot of nervous people around.",
        "Lindsay and Nora: Hmm.",
        "Clint: So what do they call a secret that doesn't burn?",
        "Nora: Evidence.",
        "Bo: Ah -- incoming.",
        "Dorian: I believe you all know our mayor, Stan Lowell.",
        "Bo: Hello, Mayor Lowell. I'm sure you remember Lindsay Rappaport.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Who could forget her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: We got to get out of here before we get caught.",
        "Allison: I didn't break out of St. Ann's to hide behind a curtain. I got work to do, things to say.",
        "Roxy: Allison, I'm begging you. Nobody has to know anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: So you keep that inside, all that pain?",
        "Jared: I sure as hell am not going to share it with you.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but then why this life? Why the Buchanans?",
        "Jared: Mom's friend -- he had a sister named Pamela. She used to come to the house every weekend, and when she was there, he wouldn't hurt us. She would talk to me about her husband, a very special and powerful man named Asa Buchanan. He was a great, loving father to his sons. Well, I'm not sure if that part was true, but I believed it then. She gave me a picture of the two of them and told me that one day I'd be like him. I used to stare at that picture every day and imagine that Asa Buchanan was my father. Now, I never got a chance to meet him. But when the opportunity came up to be his son, I took it, okay? And I'm not going to let you take that away.",
        "Charlie: Yes, and I won't. I told you that. But as I also told you, if you want to be Jared Buchanan, then you can't be in love with Natalie. Hmm? So what's it going to be? What's more important to you -- the Buchanan name or the woman you love?",
        "Viki: Charlie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I have something to show you.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "[Starr gasps]",
        "Starr: Oh, my God! It's so cute! Where did you get all the pictures?",
        "Langston: Well, your mom gave me a lot, and then I took some from my own albums.",
        "Markko: Ha. Look at this one.",
        "Starr: Oh, my God! Oh, stop.",
        "Cole: There's a recent one right there. Actually, it's my favorite. My mom took that one.",
        "Starr: It's my favorite, too.",
        "Markko: Oh, who's that good-looking guy there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: \"Help me escape and I'll tell you a secret\"? Are we 7 years old?",
        "Jessica: Okay, when we searched the mausoleum this morning, there was a little compartment hidden behind a plaque. She wasn't conning me, okay? There was something hidden there, and whatever was there, she got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I just got to talking with Jared here, and --",
        "Viki: That's all right. So you two are getting acquainted, huh?",
        "Charlie: Well, it's a start.",
        "Viki: Well, I didn't mean to interrupt. Sorry. Natalie and I were looking for a quiet place to have a chat.",
        "Jared: If you wouldn't mind, Ms. Davidson, I would appreciate a moment alone with Natalie.",
