        "Rex, Schuyler and Oliver find Gigi with the baby in her arms walking on cracking ice over a lake. They all struggle to make sure the baby is ok. But Gigi falls through the ice. They save her but she's unconscious. Meanwhile, Dorian is terrified by Mitch's threats and implications that he already has a \"plan\" for harming one of her girls. And right then, we see her daughter, Adriana and her niece Kelly in Paris where they meet a friendly, handsome stranger who offers to take Adriana home in his car. Kelly encourages her cousin to take the guy up on his offer so that she can possibly move on. But Dorian contacts her daughter Cassie, warning her that they must all beware of Mitch. Cassie calls Kelly and passes on the message. And Kelly wonders what might happen. Viki and Charlie are wondering what to do regarding Mitch and the fact that Jessica has been shot. Marty walks in on Natalie and John kissing and clearly indicates that she's threatened by what they have been doing together since Jared has been dead."

        "Rex: Why? She's got the baby.",
        "Gigi: No, he's right. The ice is cracking. It's too dangerous. It's not safe. If you come out on the ice, it'll give way and we'll fall in. Don't worry. Don't worry. I will get us across.",

        "Kim: Okay, so what happened? How'd you end up here?",
        "Stacy: I told you. Mitch threw us out.",
        "Kim: He figured out the kid wasn't his grandkid.",
        "Stacy: No, I told him to save us.",
        "Kim: Good for you.",
        "Stacy: It's just it was so cold out there. And all I had was that thin little coat and those discount boots. And the snow was up to my knees. I just--I couldn't go any further. I had to sleep.",
        "Kim: In the snow?",
        "Stacy: But Gigi found me. She brought me back here. But then it started for real, the contractions.",
        "Kim: You must have been scared out of your mind.",

        "Gigi: You okay, Sierra Rose? Oh, you're cold, aren't you? Oh, your lips are blue. Oh. We have to figure out a way to get us off this ice. The baby needs help. We have to get her to a hospital.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, my God, Stacy had the baby. I have a daughter.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, that's what it sounds like.",
        "Gigi: This is your daughter, Rex.",
        "Rex: Gigi, I'm not--I'm not gonna let anything happen to you or the baby, okay. We're gonna get you off the ice. Don't worry.",
        "Schuyler: At least call for backup. Get a truck out here or something.",
        "Oliver: There's no time, okay. If the ice gives, they're gonna fall in.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay. I know, I know that. So what do we do?",
        "Oliver: Okay, we need to make a tether line and throw it out to them.",
        "Schuyler: A tether. Okay. With what? How?",
        "Oliver: I don't know, Schuyler. I don't know.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, what... you better figure it out or we could lose them both.",

        "John: Hey. Did you come on your own?",
        "Marty: Yes. There aren't enough people to search for everyone.",
        "Natalie: Did they find my sister?",
        "Marty: Yes. Yes, she's okay. Brody found her.",

        "John: How'd you get here?",
        "Marty: I walked. I'm gonna head home. I'll tell your parents where you are, okay, Natalie.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marty: Do you have any idea what you've put me through? Seeing you shot in the courtroom. Then driving off and telling me that I should stay because I'd be more helpful where I was while she's your driver.",
        "John: I didn't know that.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I was arrested for aiding and abetting your escape. My son had to bail me out of jail.",
        "John: I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: You should be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You meant to kill...",
        "Charlie: It's okay. He knows all about it. I mean, I had to convince him to bring me by here to talk to you and check up on Jessica before he brings me down to the station.",
        "Viki: The police station.",
        "Officer: Your husband's in custody. You've got 5 minutes.",
        "Charlie: I don't have much time.",
        "Viki: I don't understand this. You went to kill Mitch and you shot Jessica instead? How drunk were you?",
        "Charlie: No, I haven't touched a drop since the time you caught me and I promised you I was gonna go on the wagon.",
        "Viki: Charlie, I found you in a bar.",
        "Charlie: But with a drink that I never touched. It wasn't mine.",
        "Viki: Well, then why would you let me think it was?",
        "Charlie: Because I couldn't tell you the truth. That I was going there to meet someone to get a gun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Officers, you heard him. He threatened to kill one of my family.",
        "Mitch: Did you hear me use the word \"kill\"?",
        "Dorian: You said one of my girls was doomed.",
        "Mitch: Well, in any event, I doubt these gentlemen would let me do anything untoward, would you boys?",
        "Dorian: Oh. Officers, a jail cell has never stopped him before. No, he is the leader of a cult. He has followers all over the world. Nothing can stop them. They're just ready and waiting to do his bidding. And they could be anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: He's coming over.",
        "Man: Pardon. I hope I haven't offended you.",
        "Kelly: Far from it.",
        "[Man speaking French]",
        "Man: How you say...token, oui, token of my appreciation.",

        "Man: For improving the scenery.",
        "[Speaks French]",
        "Kelly: He's good.",
        "Man: Forgive me, but I simply could not admire you sufficiently from over there. [Speaks French] Emile Moreau. Permit moi to sit?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You can't make Dani do anything. You certainly can't make her like you. She's growing up. She's gonna come around to it.",
        "Todd: I want to speed up the process, though, you know.",
        "[Blair laughs]",
        "Todd: What if I bought her a car?",
        "Blair: Oh, my gosh. Didn't I hear you say something about not wanting to buy your way out of this one?",
        "Todd: That was a long time ago.",
        "Blair: It was yesterday. Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: I'm surprised you remember that far back.",
        "Blair: Oh, well, thank you so much. Have you tried a little patience? Maybe patience.",
        "Todd: I did try. It sucks.",
        "Blair: You did? Oh. What do you mean it sucked, Todd? Did something happen tonight or something?",
        "Todd: Like what?",
        "Blair: I don't know. Did you and T\u00e9a maybe have a fight?",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a's got nothing to do with this. It has only to do with Dani, my daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Give me a chance to explain. I'm sorry you were arrested. That wasn't the plan. Believe me. I thought you'd be long gone before the cops--",
        "Marty: I was defending you.",
        "John: I appreciate that. I'll fix everything when I get back.",
        "Marty: I was sitting in a cell worried to death about you. Listening to guards talk about a car chase, then find out your car had gone into a ravine and exploded. When I saw the wreckage I thought you were dead. So when I saw the smoke, I was almost a little too afraid to hope, you know. So I walked one mile in the snow to find you cozied up here with your other girlfriend making out.",
        "Natalie: Look, it's not what it looked like. I mean, it really wasn't. I know how you must have felt walking in, but it's not what you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I don't believe this. You were going to kill Mitch?",
        "Charlie: Hey, I tried to kill him once before but Brody stopped me. But when Lowell dropped all the charges and Laurence was able to walk out of there a free man, I mean, I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't get the idea out of my head how Jared could be cut down like that, taken so young with his whole life in front of him. And Mitch Laurence was not gonna have to pay for that.",
        "Viki: The last time I saw you, Charlie, when you came home after you found out Jessica had been kidnapped, that's what you were trying to tell me, wasn't it? Because you promised--you promised me I was going to get Jessica back. But then you turned around and you walked out without a word.",
        "Charlie: Because the plan was already in motion. And I... I knew... [Sighs] I knew that if I spent another minute there, I wouldn't be able to leave you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What have you done? Which one of my girls is in danger?",
        "Mitch: Oh, I never spoil a surprise.",
        "Agent: I'll take him out to the maximum security vehicle outside. Let's go.",
        "Mitch: Eye for an eye, Dorian. A daughter for a daughter.",
        "Second agent: Get him out of here.",
        "Dorian: A daughter for a daughter. You heard him. Please, I beg of you, allow me to call my daughter. Please. It's really important. I have to.",
        "[Line rings]",
        "Cassie: Mother?",
        "Dorian: Cassie? Oh, honey, thank goodness. Where are you?",
        "Cassie: I'm home in Savannah. I was asleep.",
        "Dorian: Oh, okay. Are your doors locked? Windows, too? Have you had any unexpected visitors?",
        "Cassie: Mother, everything's fine. What's going on?",
        "Dorian: Oh, good. You're probably not the target.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emile: So, I am Emile. And you are?",
        "Adriana: Adriana Cramer. And this is my cousin Kelly Cramer.",
        "Emile: Enchant\u00e9. Are all the women in your family so beautiful?",
        "Kelly: Yes.",
        "Adriana: Kelly.",
        "Kelly: They are.",
        "Adriana: My cousin exaggerates. But thank you for the compliment.",
        "Emile: And you are American? The accent.",
        "Kelly: Aw. I live in London, actually. And well, we are from the states. So you're right, yes.",
        "Emile: Ahh. You're on vacation.",
        "Kelly: Adriana lives in Paris. I'm heading back to London a little bit later today.",
        "Emile: Oh. [Speaks French] What a pity you won't be around much longer. But surely you have enough time to enjoy a glass of champagne. Hmm?",
        "[Speaks French]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but Rex knows the truth. Schuyler told him everything, which is how I got here. Rex went roaring off after Gigi, and I got scared for you. So I figured I'd come up here and do a little damage control, but it doesn't look like Rex ever showed.",
        "Stacy: Oh, no, he was here. He was furious. But I'm not worried about it. Once he sees Sierra Rose, that's her name, he's just gonna fall in love with her.",
        "Kim: Sierra Rose. Classy.",
        "Stacy: I know. Rex is gonna love her.",
        "Kim: Stace, Rex is--",
        "Stacy: You know, I know he thought that I'd lost her, but we didn't really go to the doctors. It was just those stupid paramedics. I mean, it's too early for it to even be Fish's baby, so it has to Rex's, right? I mean, I completely believe in miracles, don't you?",
        "Kim: Sure, honey. Whatever you say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You're doing great, Geeg. Okay, just hang on.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi. Gigi, how's the baby doing?",
        "Gigi: She's...we have to get her to a doctor. Her color's not good.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, is she breathing?",
        "Oliver: Gigi. Gigi, I found a mooring line, okay. I'm gonna throw it out to you. I want you to tie it around your waist.",
        "Gigi: Okay. I'll try, but I don't want to put the baby down.",
        "Schuyler: No, no, no, no, don't. Don't, don't.",
        "Oliver: It's okay. It's okay. I made a loop. I want you to step into it and then pull it up, okay?",
        "Gigi: Oh, it's too short.",
        "Rex: Fish, come on. Get it closer. Try again.",
        "Gigi: No, no, no. Don't. I can reach it. I can reach it.",
        "Oliver: No, no, no, don't.",

        "Gigi: Aah! Rex: Gigi!",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God! Oh! [Screaming] Please be all right.",
        "[Sierra Rose crying]",
        "Oliver: Gigi.",
        "Gigi: We're okay. Just get me out of this water.",
        "Oliver: Pull the rope now.",
        "Schuyler: What are you doing?",
        "Oliver: Hang on, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: I'm trying. I can't feel my legs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Natalie, it's okay.",
        "Natalie: No. No, it isn't. Marty, look, John didn't even know that I was driving the car. And when he found out, he was furious. It's just by then it was too late, the cops were on our tail. And then next thing you know, the car went off the road, and it was a miracle we all survived. I was pinned underneath the steering wheel. I couldn't move. So Brody got out. He went to go get help for Jessica. And then John literally had to cut me out of the vehicle. And then the engine started sparking and there was a gas leak. And I don't know how he did it, but he pulled me out right before it blew. And then he carried me all the way here because I was unconscious. And then when we got here, he started a fire because it was freezing. He was trying to keep me awake because I had a concussion and I was delirious. And I thought he was Jared, that he'd come back to me. And...or I died. I didn't care. I just--I was so happy to see him and then I kissed him. It's my fault, Marty. Please, don't be mad at John.",
        "Marty: Well, while that may be true, come on, I think we all know what's been going on here for a while now. Let's not pretend we don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Cassie, I want you to lock all of your windows and doors. Okay? Promise me that. And don't make a move--",
        "Cassie: Why, what's going on?",
        "Dorian: Just do it! Please. And I need you to do me a favor, okay. I want you to call Blair and tell her to get Langston and Starr and the baby, Addie, all the Cramer women to some place. I don't care where it is. Just someplace safe and secure. And then lock all of the doors.",
        "Cassie: Mother, slow down. You are starting to scare me.",
        "Dorian: Good. You should be scared. But I need you to call them, honey, because they'd just hang up on me.",
        "Cassie: Okay, Mother. But listen, if this is your way of trying to manipulate them back into La Boulaie, it's not going to work.",
        "Dorian: For goodness sakes. I am trying to save their lives, all right? I don't have time to argue with you. Mitch Laurence is after our family. Got it? Promise me you're gonna call Blair.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I promise I'll call her.",
        "Dorian: Good. And call me back as soon as you hear from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: So, Monsieur Moreau, what is it that you do?",
        "Emile: I work for a very powerful person.",
        "Kelly: Really? Tell us more.",
        "Emile: I do not want to bore you with talk of business. Not when we have so little time together.",
        "Kelly: Well, I may be heading back to London, but my cousin isn't. She lives here.",
        "Adriana: Yes, you told him. Twice.",
        "Kelly: And she is a very, very talented fashion designer, if you haven't already noticed just by looking at her.",
        "Emile: Tres chic.",
        "Adriana: Merci.",
        "Kelly: And she's single.",
        "Adriana: Kelly!",
        "Emile: And I'm sure that she has left, how do you say, many broken hearts.",
        "Kelly: Dozens.",
        "Adriana: No.",
        "Emile: Really?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "Emile: And why is that? Secrets. I see. You are full of mystery, Adriana Cramer. One I would like a chance to solve.",
        "Adriana: You should try the paniers feuilletes. They're to die for.",
        "Emile: Interesting choice of words.",

        "Gigi: I can't hold on much longer. My body is numb.",

        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "[Grunts]",
        "Schuyler: You can do it. You can do it.",
        "Oliver: Come on, just put her on the jacket and we'll pull her in.",

        "Schuyler: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're gonna bring the baby in, then we're gonna do the same for you, okay?",
        "Gigi: You're okay, baby. Okay. You're gonna be fine. You're almost there, Sierra. That's your daughter, Rex. She's gonna make it.",
        "Oliver: We got her, Gigi. We got her.",
        "Gigi: Is she okay?",
        "Oliver: Does she look right to you? Look at her lips.",

        "Blair: That is not what I said.",
        "Todd: So when's it gonna happen?",
        "Blair: Well, I don't know that exactly. But, you know, she's getting to know Starr, and that's a start. Soon she'll meet her brothers. And, you know, before long, she's gonna really feel like she's a part of this family I bet.",
        "Sam: No one tells me anything.",
        "[Clatter]",
        "Todd: Did you hear something?",
        "Blair: Oh, that's probably Sam. I mean, he's so curious about where the snow comes from. I'll go put him back.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: Just don't give up.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's what Starr said. But that was before.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Please don't make this a bigger deal than what it is. I'm sorry if I upset you, but John's with you. And he's made that very clear.",
        "Marty: Have you?",
        "John: Yes.",
        "Natalie: We should probably get going, right? Aah!",
        "[Groans]",
        "Marty: Hurt your leg?",

        "Viki: Oh, God, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: So I pulled out that gun, and I swear, I was just about ready to blow away that son of a bitch. And somebody tried to stop me.",
        "Viki: Who?",
        "Charlie: Well, now it doesn't matter. Look, the blame is mine. The gun went off and the bullet, it hit your daughter. And now I just pray to God that I haven't killed Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: \"To die for\" is an expression. It's slang for something that's really great.",

        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Adriana: Sorry. Oh, guess who it is.",

        "Dorian: But she's all right?",
        "Kelly: Oh, she's just fine.",
        "Dorian: Good. Oh, good. 'Cause I need you two to go someplace safe. And I want you to lock all of the doors.",
        "Kelly: Hold it, Mayor Dorian. I know what you've been pulling in Llanview, okay. And I know people have been moving out in protest.",
        "Dorian: Forget all of that. You're in danger.",
        "Kelly: Okay, Dorian, we'll talk about this later. All right? Au revoir.",

        "Stacy: My sister.",
        "Kim: Yeah, I know who she is. I just never heard you say anything nice about her.",
        "Stacy: She took the baby to the hospital.",
        "Kim: You're the one who belongs in the hospital. Which reminds me. What did you do with that blood you got from Mitch Laurence? 'Cause we could still make the baby look like it's Rex's if that's what you really want to do.",

        "Stacy: She's amazing.",

        "Mitch: One of my attackers injured my arm. But maybe you were too busy waving your gun around to notice. How's Jessica?",
        "Viki: Don't you dare. After what you've done.",
        "Mitch: You're understandably upset our daughter was shot, but perhaps you should focus your anger where it belongs--on Charlie and Dorian.",
        "Viki: Dorian? What does she got to do with this?",
        "Mitch: What, you didn't tell her?",
        "Charlie: I told her the truth. That, yes, I shot Jessica, but with the bullet that was meant for you.",

        "Agent: Ma'am, you need to go.",
        "Dorian: Please, I'm begging you. I'm trying to protect the lives of my girls here. And just help me out. Just one more minute. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Cassie, honey. Listen, I need another favor. You have got to try and reach Kelly and Adriana. They're together in Paris. I tried to warn Kelly, but she just wouldn't listen to me. Okay? This is Mitch Laurence we are talking about. Right? He shot Jared Banks right in front of his wife. There is no telling what he is going to do. What he is capable--",

        "Adriana: Thank you, but I can't impose.",
        "Emile: No, no, no. It is my fault. I made you late. You must let me take you home. It is no trouble. And this way we spend a little more time together. Yes?",

        "Cassie: I know, Kelly. I know. But apparently Mitch Laurence is causing some serious trouble. And it really wouldn't harm us to be a little more cautious until he's back in prison.",
