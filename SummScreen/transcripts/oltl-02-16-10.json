        "Rex, Schuyler and Oliver manage to pull Gigi out of the water and Schuyler rushes both her to the hospital with the baby. But Stacy appears and falls through the ice and they fail to save her. They all assume that baby Sierra Rose is without a mommy. And we can only guess who will be her guardian. Dorian confesses to Viki, Clint and Brody that she put Charlie up to shooting Mitch and that's how Jessica got shot. They are not going to forgive her. But she fires Lowell and reinstates Brody to the force. Blair tells Starr, Cole, Langston and Markko she needs them to come with her and stay at Todd's where there is top security, after Cassie has contacted her to inform her what Dorian has warned them off regarding Mitch's threat."

        "Kelly: Come on, Adriana, come on! Pick up! Pick up. You left here just two seconds ago. Adriana, hi, it's Kelly. I know you're busy, having a good time, but Cass\u00ede just called me and told me that we should watch out for strangers. I know I sound paranoid. I'm just a little concerned, since I just let you drive off with one.",

        "Agent: Ma'am, the doctor's waiting to check you for exposure.",
        "Dorian: It's not necessary. I'm a medical doctor. Please, cut me a break guys, give me a moment here. Please.",
        "Agent: We'll be at the nurse's station.",
        "Dorian: How's Jessica?",
        "Viki: Jessica's in surgery, fighting for her life. No thanks to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I wish I knew how the hell this happened. What is it?",
        "Brody: Nothin'.",
        "Clint: I don't need to be treated with kid gloves, Brody. Whatever it is, I want to know.",
        "Brody: [Sighs] I had Mitch subdued. Then Charlie burst in, he had a gun.",
        "Clint: Charlie Banks?",
        "Brody: He was going to kill Mitch.",
        "Clint: Charlie shot Jessica?",
        "Brody: He wouldn't have. But someone else intervened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Viki, I don't know what you've been told.",
        "Viki: I know that Charlie went to kill Mitch, and may have very well have ended up killing my daughter Jessica instead.",
        "Dorian: She's young, she's strong.",
        "Viki: And he had help. Someone who put him up to this. And that was you, wasn't it, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Yes, it was me. But I had... good reasons.",

        "Cole: I thought you said you were going to stay in the bedroom.",
        "Starr: And let someone get to Hope? Are you kidding me?",
        "Cole: Who is it?",
        "Blair: It's me, Cole. It's Blair.",
        "Starr: Mom!",
        "Blair: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I just didn't want to wake the baby.",

        "Blair: Yeah. You gotta get your stuff. Come on.",

        "Dorian: Viki, if you were in my position--",
        "Viki: Oh, I know your position, Dorian. Your position is selfish! And unthinking!",
        "Dorian: I am sorry about Jessica.",
        "Viki: Really? She's not just collateral damage to you?",
        "Dorian: You just don't know. There are reasons for--",
        "Viki: Dorian, there always are with you, aren't there? So what was it this time? I mean, what were you after? Money or power or just hurting me again?",
        "Dorian: None of this, none of it would have happened if it weren't for Mitch Laurence.",
        "Viki: Do go on.",
        "Dorian: Do you know what a monster that man is?",
        "Viki: Yes, I do. I did not know that he was also responsible for your actions.",
        "Dorian: Yes, he is responsible. Mitch Laurence is at the root of whatever happens to Jessica. And anybody else.",

        "Oliver: [Gasps] Keep talking to her, Rex.",
        "Rex: Gigi, please don't do this. Shane needs you. He loves you.",

        "Rex: Gigi!",
        "[Gigi coughing and gasping]",
        "Schuyler: Oh, thank God! You're okay. You're okay. Okay.",
        "Gigi: The baby! Where is she?!",
        "Oliver: I've got her, I've got her, she's right here.",
        "Schuyler: We're going to get you two to a hospital, okay?",
        "Gigi: Rex! Her name is Sierra. Your daughter's name is Sierra Rose. [Gasping]",
        "Rex: I know the baby's name. I saw Stacy.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dorian is the reason that Jessica was shot?",
        "Brody: Charlie had a clear shot at Mitch.",
        "Clint: And he didn't take it?",
        "Brody: I tried to talk him down, but he wanted Mitch to confess first. When he didn't, Charlie was about to fire, and...",
        "Clint: And?",
        "Brody: And Dorian burst in out of nowhere. She knocked Charlie's hands.",
        "Clint: Oh, for the love of God!",
        "Brody: And the gun went off, and Jessica was hit.",
        "Clint: Because of Dorian Lord.",
        "Brody: If she hadn't come in...",
        "Clint: Do you have any idea what the hell her intent was? Was Dorian trying to protect Mitch?",

        "Dorian: I'm not trying to absolve myself.",
        "Viki: Then take responsibility!",
        "Dorian: There were dire underlying circumstances.",
        "Viki: Oh, I'll just bet there were! You were Mitch's pawn!",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "Viki: You just did whatever he wanted you to do. He got you to set him free. You are responsible for all of this violence.",
        "Dorian: I didn't intend this.",
        "Viki: Oh, God, Dorian, what were you thinking? What was he going to give you, what was he worth to you?",
        "Dorian: My girls' lives.",

        "Blair: Starr, I need you to grab that blanket for me.",
        "Starr: What are you doing?",
        "Blair: Just grab--all right, get the bottles, would you?",
        "Starr: Mom, we're not going anywhere.",
        "Blair: Just do as I say, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: You can't tell me what to do.",
        "Blair: Yes, I can, because I'm your mother.",
        "Starr: You can't do this in my own home!",
        "Blair: Listen, your home is where Cole and Hope are, and we're going. And they're coming with us.",
        "Cole: Where are we going, exactly?",
        "Blair: We're going to go to Todd's.",

        "Blair: Please.",
        "Starr: Okay, then why?",
        "Blair: Because your father has security, that's why.",
        "Cole: Why do we need security?",
        "Blair: I can't explain everything to you. Will you just do as I say and help me pack some stuff?!",
        "Starr: And go to Dad's?!",
        "Blair: Listen, your brother and your grandmother are already there. And tomorrow morning, sweetheart, we will wake up as one big happy family and we'll have chocolate chip pancakes, 'cause that's your favorite.",
        "Starr: Absolutely not!",
        "Blair: Excuse me!",
        "Starr: I am not taking my daughter out in the middle of the night without an explanation.",

        "Dorian: Mitch was behind bars. A life sentence seemed guaranteed.",
        "Viki: There are no guarantees with him.",
        "Dorian: Of course I should have known, after what he did to Cass\u00ede and to you--",
        "Viki: And my children.",
        "Dorian: To so many people.",
        "Viki: Dorian, why the hell would you think you were safe?",
        "Dorian: I was desperate.",
        "Viki: So he came after you, and you just made a deal with him.",
        "Dorian: Oh, why else do you suppose I would have done the things that I did?",
        "Viki: Oh, please, you don't want me to answer that.",
        "Dorian: Mitch ordered me to fire Bo, to hire Lowell, or else... my girls would pay the price.",
        "Viki: You let the whole town suffer.",
        "Dorian: I was going to fix it.",
        "Viki: How? What'd you think, you'd suddenly be rid of him?",
        "Dorian: I knew that in time, an opportunity would present itself.",
        "Viki: Yeah, that opportunity turned out to be Charlie, didn't it? He'd lost his son. He was losing himself. He was drowning in his grief, and you gave him a drink and a gun.",
        "Dorian: I thought it might give him peace.",
        "Viki: No, you thought he was an easy mark.",
        "Dorian: Look, I was at my wit's end, the end of my rope. I didn't know what else to do. Viki, I swear to you, if I could take it all back, I would.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: And yeah, I know that this is the second message I've left you. Just call me when you get this, okay? Okay. Okay. I don't know what you're so worried about, Cramer. Really. Adriana's just fine. You know, she's just not picking up her phone because she's having a good time with her cute Frenchman. Who might have been sent by Mitch Laurence to kill her. Oh, my God. What did I do? What did I do? Ahhh! Do I call Dorian? I don't know. If I tell Dorian that I let her go off with a strange man, she'll freak, and then she'll kill me. Okay, well, there's no reason. There's no reason to panic Dorian when I don't know anything, and I don't know anything. That guy couldn't possibly be working for Mitch! Could he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I thought I'd seen all of Dorian's tricks, but this...",
        "Brody: I'm not sure Dorian was trying to protect Mitch.",
        "Clint: Well, she stopped Charlie from killing him, right, and got my Jessie shot instead.",
        "Brody: She did, but--",
        "Clint: That's all I need to know.",
        "Brody: You don't have the facts.",
        "Clint: You just told me what happened.",
        "Brody: Clint, you don't want to do anything crazy.",
        "Clint: I'm not, but when I get my hands on Dorian Lord, I am going to kill the bitch.",
        "Lowell: I believe that's our mayor you're talking about.",
        "Brody: You corrupt piece of scum!",
        "Lowell: And I'm the police commissioner.",
        "Brody: None of this would have happened if you had done your job.",
        "Lowell: I did my job. I was busy tracking two fugitive cops. Oh, look, here's one of them now. Officer Lovett, will you come quietly?",
        "Clint: If you touch him, you deal with me.",
        "Lowell: This has nothing to do with you. Officer Lovett wanted me dead.",
        "Brody: The only way I'm leaving Jessica is boots first.",
        "Lowell: That can be arranged. Officers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I just don't get you! How could you risk the lives of so many innocent people?",
        "Dorian: I was trying to protect my family.",
        "Viki: Oh, rubbish! You just wanted to trade your girls' lives for anybody else's.",
        "Dorian: I never intended for anyone to get hurt. I didn't want that.",
        "Viki: Really? Except Charlie? He was expendable.",
        "Dorian: That was a terrible mistake.",
        "Viki: You call that a mistake?",
        "Dorian: A terrible mistake. I--I--I realized that I couldn't let Charlie throw his life away.",
        "Viki: And when did you realize that, after he pulled the trigger?",
        "Dorian: No! Why do you think I went after him, to find him? I wanted to stop him!",
        "Viki: Oh, and what a spectacular success you were!",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Viki: You saved Mitch Laurence. You caused my daughter Jessica to be shot. You heaped even more guilt on Charlie. Natalie's still missing. Jessie's bleeding on an operating table, and her little girl Bree's at home wondering when her mother is coming home, if she ever is. Wow, wow! What a success.",
        "Dorian: I had to protect my girls.",
        "Viki: Well, don't you worry, Dorian. Your girls are safe. I just pray that someday, they'll be safe from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Did I hear you guys say something about danger?",
        "Starr: Yeah, we were just about to find out about it.",
        "Blair: I wish that I had all the answers here, but I don't. I just got a phone call from my cousin Cass\u00ede.",
        "Starr: Just now?",
        "Blair: Yes. And she said to get everybody together and get you all to a safe place.",
        "Starr: Did she tell you why?",
        "Blair: She said Dorian told her to.",
        "Cole: Since when do we start listening to Dorian?",
        "Blair: Look, Cole, I said exactly the same thing. But Cass\u00ede said that Dorian was absolutely dead serious. And believe me, she is more skeptical of Dorian than I am, so when Cass\u00ede says something like that--",
        "Markko: You listen.",
        "Blair: Yes, I do.",
        "Markko: All right, that's good enough for me. I'll get Langston.",
        "Starr: So you really don't have any idea what this is about?",
        "Blair: No, sweetheart, I don't. I wish I did, but--",
        "Markko: Langston's gone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh! Does it hurt?",
        "Ford: Well, it's not so much the physical pain, as it is knowing that I might not ever model again. It's okay.",
        "Langston: Seriously?",
        "Ford: Seriously. Grad school doesn't pay for itself.",
        "Langston: Is it really bad?",
        "Ford: I'll live. It's okay.",
        "Langston: I'm so sorry I unleashed my kickboxing on you.",
        "Ford: Oh, is that what that was?",
        "Langston: Well, I figured it couldn't hurt for self defense. I thought you were a rapist.",
        "Ford: Ooh, well, that makes us even. I thought you were a burglar.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Ford: Well, you know, you come in here in the middle of the night, and--",
        "Langston: With the key that you gave me. What are you even doing here this late?",
        "Ford: Well, the heat is out in my building, so I crashed here.",
        "Langston: You're kidding.",
        "Ford: Nope. Bet you're glad you didn't move there, huh? So what's your excuse?",
        "Langston: I couldn't sleep, so I figured I'd work on the musical.",
        "Ford: So you came here.",
        "Langston: You said I could use your office.",
        "Ford: [Chuckles] I did.",
        "Langston: That's right. If I had known you'd be here like... like that, I wouldn't have come, but you are, so I will go.",
        "Ford: Why? I mean, you can if you want, but you don't have to leave on my account.",

        "Rex: Just hold on, Stacy!",

        "Rex: Get Gigi out of here. Now. Here, take her.",

        "Gigi: I promise you! I won't let anything happen to her! You're my sister! I'll see you back at the hospital, I promise!",

        "Blair: Okay, so when is the last time that you saw Langston?",
        "Markko: When I left for work, she was asleep.",
        "Starr: Maybe she went to grab coffee.",
        "Cole: In the middle of the night?",
        "Starr: Yeah, if she woke up.",
        "Markko: She would have left a note or something.",
        "Blair: Wait, wait, where's Danielle?",
        "Starr: Oh, she's okay. She called me.",
        "Blair: Are you sure that she's safe?",
        "Starr: Yes, she is with Rachel and Matthew.",
        "Markko: Yeah, I saw them at Buenos D\u00edas.",

        "Markko: Wait, what about Langston? I'm calling the police.",
        "Blair: No, you know what, I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Markko: Why not?",
        "Cole: I gotta agree with Blair on this one.",
        "Blair: Yeah, you just can't trust the cops right now, with Lowell in charge. You just never know.",
        "Markko: All right, well, what about Dorian? She might know what to do.",
        "Starr: I think that we should call Langston.",
        "Markko: Well, what if she can't answer?",
        "Starr: Then we'll know that something's wrong. S9 but for now, for all we know, she could be absolutely fine.",

        "Langston: I should just go.",
        "Ford: You sure?",
        "Langston: Yeah. Well, the whole point of you giving me your key was so that I could use your office when you're not here.",
        "Ford: Oh, well, I don't want to bother you.",
        "Langston: Bother me? I'm the one who bothered you. I woke you up.",
        "Ford: You're right, and I will never get back to sleep ever again.",
        "Langston: I'm sure you have some work you could do.",
        "Ford: Well, there's plenty of room for both of us. Especially after you worked so hard to get in here.",
        "Langston: [Chuckles] Maybe I'll just go to the Buenos D\u00edas.",
        "Ford: Whatever you want. You have my schedule?",
        "Langston: Yes, I do.",
        "Ford: So you know when I'm here, and you can plan accordingly.",

        "[Viki sighs]",
        "Dorian: I don't know if this makes you happy or not, but my girls have cut me out of their lives. They moved out of my house when I hired Lowell.",
        "Viki: Poor Dorian. Didn't you try to win them over with your sob story?",
        "Dorian: I could not risk telling them the truth. Haven't you been listening to me?",
        "Viki: I cannot believe you! You let them believe that you were in bed with Mitch!",
        "Dorian: Well, that was worth it if it ensured their safety.",
        "Viki: So what are you doing now? Why are you telling me all of this?",
        "Dorian: Because every promise, ever assurance Mitch made went out the window when I went after him.",
        "Viki: You don't think he's going to honor your agreement, huh?",
        "Dorian: No.",
        "Lowell: Park their butts over there.",
        "Viki: Clint? Is there any word on Jessie?",
        "Clint: She's still in surgery.",
        "Viki: What happened to you two?",
        "Lowell: Your friends here broke the law.",
        "Clint: And Lowell decided to take Brody, and...",
        "Brody: Clint had a problem with that.",
        "Clint: And now we're under arrest.",

        "Schuyler: How are you doing?",
        "Gigi: I'm better, but I'm worried about Sierra.",
