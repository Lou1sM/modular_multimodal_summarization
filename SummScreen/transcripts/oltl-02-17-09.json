        "Nora, Bo, Clint, Renee and Nigel all wake up hung-over after the night of the ball where David Vickers finds out that Asa left him everything. Knowing they won't have a cent to their name, they all wonder what to do. David and Dorian appear and tell them it's time to get the hell out of their home. Stacy stays at Gigi and Rex's home. But she brings Fish over. She has seduced him the previous night but doesn't want anybody to know. At that point, he announces to Layla that he's found somebody else assuming Stacy is serious about him. Blair and Todd wake up together in his bed. She asks how that happened. He reminds her that he wasn't going to let her drive home drunk, have their kids see her in the state she was in and he couldn't go to Dorian's house since he has a restraining order. And they both know that John and Wes have been fighting over Marty. At Wes's, Marty awakens with blood on her hands and freaks when she sees that somebody stabbed Wes to death. John attempts to help her. Blair goes and observes them standing over Wes's dead body and calls the cops to report a murder."

        "Rex: No, why? Are you worried?",
        "Gigi: I just hope she had a good time after the ball. That's all.",
        "Stacy: Don't come down here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, no. The room is spinning. Oh, shh, shh. Don't make any noise.",
        "[Bo groans]",
        "Nora: Don't even move.",
        "Bo: Oh, never again. Oh.",
        "[Bo groans]",
        "Nora: Clint? Oh, no. How did we end up like this?",
        "Clint's voice: That's what I'd like to know.",

        "David: Is it morning? Is it time for the Surya Namaskar?",
        "Dorian: Zip me.",
        "David: Did we --",
        "Dorian: Share an absolutely blissful experience last night? Oh, we most certainly did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: John, I need an aspirin, bad.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, baby. I'll get you an aspirin. I'll get you anything you need.",
        "Blair: Todd? What the hell happened last night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Wes. What did we do last night?",
        "Marty: Wes? Wes?",
        "[Marty screams]",
        "John: What, Marty? Marty, open the door. Marty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: We raised big money last night. I'm really proud of what we did.",
        "Talia: Me, too. I could have done without the bar fight, though. That was crazy, you know? John and Marty, all of them.",
        "Layla: Please, that guy Marty was with? I mean, I thought he was going to break Todd in two.",
        "Talia: Yeah, and it's going to be in all of the papers, probably. I just hope that the message about heart health doesn't get lost in all that madness.",
        "Layla: Well, you know what they say. Even bad publicity is good publicity.",
        "Talia: Fish was kind of adorable, trying to break up that fight.",
        "Layla: Yeah, he was. What?",
        "Talia: What's going on with you and Fish?",
        "Layla: Well, I hardly even saw him last night. And after I got done working the room, he was gone.",
        "Talia: Well, he strikes me as an early to bed, early to rise kind of guy.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm, that's cool with me. So the guy's growing on me a little. There's something about him that gets to you after a while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Stacy, why can't we come down?",
        "Stacy: Uh, I'm not decent.",
        "Rex: Well, you're the only thing between me and my coffee, so what if I close my eyes?",
        "Stacy: Okay, okay. Just a second.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Okay.",
        "Rex: Stacy, my eyes are closed because I'm a gentleman.",
        "Gigi: Why are you sleeping on the floor?",
        "Stacy: Oh, you know, it's good for my back.",
        "Gigi: Want some breakfast?",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, sure.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Okay, you --",
        "Oliver: Why did you hide me?",
        "Stacy: Because I don't want to freak out my sister's kid. Come on, you've got to get dressed before he comes downstairs.",
        "Oliver: All right, I'm trying.",
        "Stacy: Here, here, come on. Let's go, let's go. Come on.",
        "Oliver: Listen, I just want to say that last night was amazing.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Oliver: I really feel --",
        "Stacy: Here's your coat. Yep, mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: Let me see if it's here yet.",
        "Stacy: Oh, were you looking for the newspaper? Yeah, it's not here yet.",
        "Rex: So this is you decent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Neither one of you remembered what happened last night?",
        "Nora: No.",
        "Bo: No, I don't, I don't. Do you?",
        "Nora: Me?",
        "Bo: Uh-huh.",
        "Nora: Uh, I do remember something about raiding Asa's wine cellar.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. Yeah, and we had toasts.",
        "Nigel: Many, many toasts. Burnt muffins and somewhat undercooked eggs. I'm not fully operational this morning.",
        "Nora: It's all right, Nigel. Neither are we. What the heck is that?",
        "Nigel: Oh, mummy's cure for a hangover. Banana shakes with a splash of Worcestshire sauce.",
        "[Bo groans]",
        "Nora: I feel like I woke up in a dorm room.",
        "Bo: I feel like I spent the night in a chicken coop.",
        "Clint: Nigel, Nigel, does that stuff work?",
        "Nigel: Not yet. Report back if it does anything for you, sir.",
        "Renee: Oh, oh, Nigel, is that a banana shake with Worcestshire sauce?",
        "[Renee moaning]",
        "Renee: Under normal circumstances, I would swear off alcohol forever. But now that David Vickers is Asa's son, and may claim this entire estate --",
        "Nigel: Perhaps Mr. Vickers will forgo his inheritance.",
        "Nora: And what? Continue on his path to Buddhism?",
        "Bo: Oh, right.",
        "Clint: Even if he wanted to, there's not a chance that his bride from hell would let him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm sorry, honey.",
        "David: So loud.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I like it better crushed.",
        "David: Am I really Asa Buchanan's son? It's not a dream?",
        "Dorian: Oh, it is a dream. It's just a wonderful dream. When I walked out of here last night, I really didn't know if it was going to come true. Whew.",
        "David: Yeah, you walked out on me.",
        "Dorian: Namaste. I wanted you to make the decision on your own. Take me along on this wonderful journey of yours, or divorce me.",
        "David: I thought long and hard about what you said.",
        "Dorian: And?",
        "David: You married me for the wrong reasons. But you apologized and said that you were vindictive and mean.",
        "Dorian: Did I use those exact words?",
        "David: Something along those lines.",
        "Dorian: You know, I couldn't wait to stick it to Clint, but I had to let you make your decision on your own. After all, it is your newfound fortune, and it's your decision to make, what you do with it.",
        "David: Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Darling.",
        "David: Huh?",
        "Dorian: We'll have everything now.",
        "David: Kind of looks like we already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Can't remember anything, huh? That doesn't surprise me. I have never seen you that wasted, you know.",
        "Blair: Oh, shut up.",
        "Todd: That was great. John McBain dropped you like a bad habit when he found Marty needed him.",
        "Blair: How did I end up here?",
        "Todd: Well, you confronted John when he went to Marty's defense.",
        "Blair: I know that part, Todd.",
        "Todd: And then you sidled up to the bar, and you started knocking them back.",
        "Todd: And then you told John to get lost. He tried to argue his case, but you wouldn't hear it. You froze him out. So he left.",
        "Blair: Look, this isn't a joke, Todd. How did I go from the bar to here?",
        "Todd: A couple more drinks.",
        "Todd: Last call was 20 minutes ago.",
        "Blair: Then what the hell are you doing here? I've got to get home. Where's my parking pass?",
        "Todd: What are you thinking?",
        "Blair: I've got to get home. Why don't you go away?",
        "Todd: My driver's downstairs. He'll give you a lift.",
        "Blair: Oh, the hell -- no, just --",
        "Todd: Fine with me. Walk.",
        "Blair: Well, okay. Well, just wait a minute. Wait a minute. I can't walk -- wait, Todd.",
        "Blair: Why didn't you just take me straight to Dorian?",
        "Todd: Because you were making a fool of yourself. It was terrible. I didn't want to take the risk of you embarrassing yourself in front of our kids. And anyway with Dorian, I'd have heard from her. You've got the restraining order --",
        "Blair: Todd, how did I go from the bar to here, and end up in your bed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John's voice: Marty? Marty, what's going on in there? Marty? Open the door, Marty. Open the door.",
        "John: What the hell happened?",
        "John: He's dead. Are you all right? Hey, look at me. Look at me. Tell me, what happened?",
        "Marty: I don't know.",
        "John: What do you mean, you don't know?",
        "Marty: I don't know. I woke up and he was like that. Wes was like that. He was just like that. Oh, my God. I'm going to be sick.",
        "John: That's his knife. That's the knife he pulled on Manning last night. Want to tell me how it ended up in his chest?",
        "Marty: I don't know! I was drunk. I just laid down. I passed out.",
        "John: Were you leaving him?",
        "Marty: No, no. No, he was throwing me out.",
        "John: Easy. Take it easy. Just tell me what happened when you left the party?",
        "Marty: We came back here. We had a fight.",
        "John: And then what?",
        "Marty: Then --",
        "Wes: Pack.",
        "Marty: Aren't we even going to talk about this?",
        "Wes: What's to talk about?",
        "Marty: I thought we were friends.",
        "Wes: I'm not your friend, all right? You drag me to that ball, lead me around by the nose, use me just to get in McBain's face, and what do I get for my trouble, huh? Socked in the face a couple of times and accused of murder?",
        "Marty: He told me that I was using him, and he was really furious with you for telling him that he killed Lee Halpern. He was -- and then I told him he was paranoid. And he got really, really angry.",
        "John: What did he say?",
        "Marty: He said that --",
        "John: What?",
        "Marty: He said he remembered -- he said he remembered that he saw Lee the night that she was killed.",
        "Wes: I wanted to see her face and for her to see mine. So she could see exactly what she did to my family.",
        "Marty: Wes, I'm sorry. You don't need to explain.",
        "Wes: You know I knew just how to look for her. Because you told me about the safehouse the cops had her stashed at.",
        "John: That's all.",
        "Marty: Wes, I know you didn't kill her.",
        "Wes: And how could you possibly know a thing like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What are you telling me?",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, what was I thinking?",
        "Todd: You weren't. Neither was I, though. I was pretty wasted myself. I probably wasn't the best host, was I?",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Todd: Sit down.",
        "Blair: Okay, where do you want me to go?",
        "Todd: I've got five bedrooms, just pick one.",
        "Blair: Eeny, meeny --",
        "Todd: Let's just take this one, shall we?",
        "Blair: Which one?",
        "Blair: This one here.",
        "Todd: Go on.",
        "Blair: I've got to open the door.",
        "Todd: I got into bed. But then a little after that --",
        "Blair: Oh. I'm looking for the bathroom.",
        "Todd: And then you passed out on the bed.",
        "Blair: No. No, that is not what happened.",
        "Blair: I'm just looking for the bathroom.",
        "Todd: Right there.",
        "Blair: Just -- this is what you call the master suite, huh? This is girly. This is not a suite.",
        "Todd: Use the bathroom if you're going to use it.",
        "Blair: I recognize this. Wait a minute. I recognize this from \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Todd: So what?",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, this where Marty -- you sleep in the same place where Marty sleeps? You're sicker than I thought.",
        "Todd: Get out.",
        "Blair: I'm going, okay? I'm go -- uhh! So where's the bathroom?",
        "Todd: Oh, please God, tell me we didn't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: All right, we are not just going to sit around here and wait for David Vickers to come on over here and stake his claim.",
        "Nora: Honey, I'm not really in the best shape for making -- for a strategy session.",
        "Bo: Can someone tell me how we got on the couch together?",
        "Clint: Half naked, mind you.",
        "Renee: You don't remember?",
        "Nora: Do we want to?",
        "[Renee laughs]",
        "Renee: Yes, we were clearing out Asa's wine cellar. And the guys were reminiscing about those great poker games that Asa used to have here. And one thing led to another.",
        "Clint: I'll see you and raise you 20. Peeking is cheating, Nora.",
        "Nora: It was worth a shot.",
        "Clint: That's what this wine needs is a shot, like a bourbon chaser. Right, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: How right you are, sir.",
        "Bo: I'm out.",
        "Renee: Where are you going?",
        "Bo: I'm going out to the barn. I want to say goodbye to some old friends.",
        "Nora: You know, we probably all are going to have to fold soon. There'll be nothing left to bet but the clothes on our back.",
        "Clint: No, I'm still in.",
        "Nora: What are you -- what are you going to do, ante up an empty wallet?",
        "Nigel: As Ms. Hanen said, we still have our garments.",
        "Nora: Why, Nigel, are you suggesting we play strip poker? Oh, my God. Say it isn't so.",
        "Nigel: Please say it isn't so.",
        "Renee: Very so. We just kept playing and drinking and drinking and playing. King high flush!",
        "Nora: Oh, no. I'm just starting --",
        "[All laughing]",
        "Nora: Yes! All off, drop 'em.",
        "Renee: Take it off, take it off, take it off! A king high flush.",
        "Clint: I remember that flush. I also remember stumbling up the stairs.",
        "Nigel: I fell down attempting to get into bed. And I slept on the floor.",
        "Renee: And, Nora, you were a complete goner. I did not have the heart to get you upstairs and into bed.",
        "Nora: Sorry about that. What's a little lost dignity among relatives, you know, when we're about to lose the roof over our heads?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Last night, we had une nuit du passion parfaite, with vintage champagne, fraises, pate, petit fours. But you, my darling, were the yummiest dish of all.",
        "Dorian: Mmm. Mmm.",
        "Dorian: Of course, none of this would have happened if you hadn't forgiven me. We both want the same thing, David -- a marriage born of love. Of course, your inheritance makes a fabulous wedding gift. David? You're so quiet.",
        "David: I was just thinking. I'm going to miss my morning [speaking Chinese language] I find comfort in a simpler life. I see the world in a different way, and for the first time in my life, I have found peace. Am I really ready to give all of that up? Yeah, absolutely. Who needs peace when you've got all that Buchanan money, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Stacy, you weren't mad at me for leaving early, were you?",
        "Stacy: No, of course not.",
        "Rex: Baby, you were upset.",
        "Stacy: You weren't mad at me for telling you the way I did, were you?",
        "Gigi: I can't think of a good way to break that kind of news.",
        "Stacy: Gigi, I'm really sorry I ruined your night.",
        "Gigi: It's okay. I mean, I asked about Mom and Dad. They were in a car accident. What are you supposed to say, they're fine?",
        "Rex: Come on, let's get you home.",
        "Gigi: You're going to stay with us, right?",
        "Stacy: You really don't need the hassle right now.",
        "Gigi: It's not a hassle. God, you're the only family I've got left besides Shane. And he's going to love you.",
        "Rex: He's going to get back from his sleepover and find out he has an aunt.",
        "Stacy: Are you sure?",
        "Gigi: Yes.",
        "Rex: I'll get our coats.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Stacy: Um, look, I'm going to stay here a while, give you two some time alone.",
        "Rex: I hope the party wasn't too busted after we left.",
        "Stacy: I managed to entertain myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Hey.",
        "Layla: Hey, Fish.",
        "Oliver: Hi. I didn't think that anyone would be here.",
        "Layla: What are you doing here?",
        "Oliver: Well, I lost my PDA. I think it might have fallen out of my pocket when I was, um --",
        "Oliver: Leaving.",
        "Layla: I thought you came here to make good on that dance I promised you. Look, I know I was juggling a lot of things last night. And when that awful fight broke out and -- I'm sorry you got in the middle of it, and --",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Can I talk to you alone for a minute? The thing is, last night I --",
        "Layla: It's all right. Just say it.",
        "Oliver: I can't see you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What are you doing?",
        "David: Getting dressed.",
        "Dorian: In that same old thing?",
        "David: It's all I've got. I gave everything else away, remember?",
        "Dorian: Valentina, please.",
        "David: Who's Valentina?",
        "Dorian: She's my personal shopper. Oh, hello, Valentina. This is Dorian Lord.",
        "David: Dorian Buchanan.",
        "Dorian: Right, Buchanan. I'll explain later. I am here in the conference room of the Palace Hotel. We need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Did we or didn't we?",
        "Todd: Give me a break. You were one drink shy of blacking out. I wouldn't take advantage of a woman in that condition.",
        "Blair: Oh, right, unless you called four of your buddies over.",
        "Todd: Ha.",
        "Blair: Ha.",
        "Todd: You know, I didn't bring you here so you could give me a hard time. I didn't want you driving into a ditch or something. You owe me a thank you, actually.",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm not thanking you for anything. You know, I'm the one that's keeping your daughter together after all the hell that you put her through. And the thought of even sleeping with you makes me sick, and it's never going to happen again.",
        "Todd: Well, you know, I'm the least of your problems. John McBain was way more interested in Marty last night than he was with you. Well, I'll tell you, when he came to her rescue, I thought you were going to bust a gut.",
        "Blair: Oh, and you were just tickled pink with Marty and that Wes guy. She was all over him on the dance floor. But you know, I don't blame her, you know. He's young and not hard to look at.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh, all right. It's over between Marty and me, anyway, so --",
        "Blair: Oh, right. She didn't even blink an eye when he had that knife right to your throat.",
        "Todd: God, I wanted to kill him.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. If looks could kill, he'd be dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Did Wes threaten you?",
        "Marty: I told him I knew he didn't kill Lee. And that made him angry.",
        "John: What did he say?",
        "Marty: He said, \"How could you possibly know something like that?\" But he was shouting, and I wondered, I remember wondering why is he acting like this?",
        "John: Then what?",
        "Marty: I don't know. We were both so exhausted and so drunk. I just must have laid down. But --",
        "John: What?",
        "Marty: I remember wondering if maybe he did kill her. I was thinking that she'd been here with me. The only witness that could have put Todd away for everything he'd done to me.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Without her -- oh, what if I went crazy? What if I went crazy? What if I went crazy, and I killed Wes?",
        "John: You didn't do this.",
        "Marty: How do you know?",
        "John: I know you.",
        "Marty: I pulled a gun on you. I was ready to pull the trigger.",
        "John: You were told I was dangerous. You were trying to protect yourself.",
        "Marty: You don't know who I am. You know who I was. And I am capable of killing someone. I got Todd up to that roof, and I made him jump. Two people were in this room last night. So if I didn't kill Wes, who did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Here's your aspirin.",
        "Blair: Ah!",
        "Todd: God, looks like you need it still.",
        "Blair: Don't you even think about telling anybody that I spent the night here last night. I mean it.",
        "Todd: Well, who would care? I mean, obviously you and John are finished.",
        "Blair: Don't count on it.",

        "Dorian: Oh, who cares? I'm going to take them all. Yes, Liz, write them all up.",
        "Liz: Will do, Mrs. Buchanan.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank you.",
        "David: Wool blend? I want cashmere! Ow! Watch it with those things.",
        "[David sighs]",
        "David: Too wide, too senatorial, too inexpensive. Seriously -- paisley?",

        "Rex: Uh, did, too.",
        "Stacy: I love that look. Business in the front, party in the back.",
        "Gigi: That was a five-minute phase, okay? Wow, this is Christmas the year I turned 17. This is the last photo I have of Mom and Dad. And she's wearing the sweater I got her. If I had known I was never going to see her again --",
        "Stacy: Gigi, wherever they are, they know you love them.",
        "Gigi: I hope so. God, it's so weird. We were just talking about them, remember?",
        "Rex: On our flight to Vegas. She said how she wanted to find them -- make up with them.",
        "Gigi: I just thought that they should be at our wedding.",

        "Rex: Uh, we've been sort of tossing the idea around.",
        "Stacy: That's great.",

        "Rex: Right, I knew that's what you meant.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, no -- I think every guy that I talked to last night was a complete loser, so -- it doesn't even matter anyway. [Stacy laughs] I'm just here to reconnect with my sister. I'm not here to hook up with some dude.",

        "Nora: Done. And I will continue to contest the will.",
        "Bo: All right, good. I'm running his name through the system. If he has so much as an unpaid ticket for littering, I'll bring him in.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Nigel: I've hidden the silver.",

        "Stacy: You know, he is right.",
        "Rex: You're still in a state of shock. You can't figure everything out in one day. It's going to take time. But you have that. You two found each other again.",
        "Stacy: Gigi, I can't tell you what happened inside of me when I saw you in Vegas. I just want to be your little sister again. I want to be Shane's aunt.",

Bo, I have always respected and admired you, even when you were slapping the cuffs on me. Nora, a sister-in-law before I even knew that I had one. Always very close to my heart. Nigel, you have served my family with grace and an admirable work ethic. And, Renee -- what can I say? Radiant as always.",
        "Bo: Where are you going with this?",
