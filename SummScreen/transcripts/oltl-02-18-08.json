        "Lindsay: I'm a jealous, obsessive shrew, and I can't stand for anyone else to be happy. Not much of a secret, Nora.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah? Well, how about \"I'm a cold-blooded killer who fakes insanity every time I get the semi-frequent urge to murder someone\"?",
        "Lindsay: Well, that's kind of strange. As a matter of fact, I'm feeling a little bit insane right now.",
        "Nora: So what are you saying? You planning on killing me so I don't find your secret?",

        "Bo: It's no joke, Balsom. I'm not the commissioner anymore.",
        "Ramsey: I know that Llanview's the kind of place where everybody knows your name, and I -- I promise you, someday, I'll know all of yours, too.",
        "Talia: But why is this happening here?",
        "Antonio: Why is this happening at all?",
        "Ramsey: And I'm sure you're all wondering why the time has come to bid farewell to our outgoing commissioner. Bo's a fine fellow. We wish him well.",
        "[Ramsey leads applause]",
        "Ramsey: But there have been too many crimes that have gone unsolved in this community. And the citizens of Llanview deserve better. The days of bleeding- heart juice and felons walking free in the streets are over.",
        "Bo: Unless your name is Lee Ramsey.",
        "Ramsey: Tonight, together, we make a fresh start. I stand before you a whole new man. And I've already made several relationships here, and I look forward to making a great many more. Thank you very much.",
        "Viki: Gigi -- honey, what's wrong?",
        "Gigi: I have to go get Shane now.",
        "Viki: But why? I mean, what's the matter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: For someone without a secret, you seem awfully desperate, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: This fundraiser was my idea, and it is my responsibility to keep people's secrets secret!",
        "Nora: Whoa.",
        "Lindsay: What?",
        "Nora: Nothing.",
        "Lindsay: Give me that!",

        "Jared: Nothing, if you just listen to me --",
        "Natalie: No. Please don't say another word.",
        "Jared: No, I'm telling you, I'm willing to give it up!",
        "Natalie: Give what up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "Langston: All right.",
        "Cole: It'll come true.",
        "Starr: Well, all of my wishes have already come true. Thank you guys all so much for coming and making tonight just amazing. Thank you.",
        "Cole: Wow. Okay, so when do you want to open your presents?",
        "Starr: Well, I don't know. I kind of want to, you know -- I don't want the surprises to end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Well, your date certainly added some excitement to the evening.",
        "Dorian: Yes, well, I had no idea he would use the occasion to fire the police commissioner. Quite a shock.",
        "Charlie: Nobody seemed too happy about it, or do I read that wrong?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Rex: No, you didn't. Bo's the best.",
        "Adriana: He's been like a dad to Rex. I mean --",
        "Charlie: No, I -- I know what you mean. He was there when I wasn't.",
        "Rex: Well, you're here now. Anyway, we're all real upset about Bo, but right now, he's not talking about it. So I guess we'll find out more at some point.",
        "Dorian: Yes, I'm sure we will.",
        "Rex: You know, I was looking for you, Charlie. It's good to see you.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Dorian: You know, it must make you feel really good, Rex, to know that you were sired by someone so cultured and intelligent and -- it must have been a shock, as it certainly was when I learned the news.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Rex: Yeah, especially considering I thought it was Wally Balsom all these years. You know Natalie, right? Viki's daughter?",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah.",
        "Rex: Well, anyway, Wally Balsom, the guy I thought was my father, took her, stole her away, gave her to Roxy to raise. Cheating Viki out of knowing she had a daughter and Jessica out of knowing she had a sister. All because he was in some cult led by another psycho, Mitch Laurence. Anyway, under the heading of \"more than you wanted to know.\"",
        "Charlie: Well, no, no, I do. Of course I want to know more about your life, your family.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm sure he wants to know everything. Please elaborate.",
        "Rex: Well, there's not all that much more to tell. I just went on about Wally to -- to point out that there's nothing you could ever say or do that would be a bigger disappointment to me than what I believed growing up about my dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Why is he doing this?",
        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Bo: Well, we had a difference of opinion. He wanted my resignation. I said no, so he fired me.",
        "Antonio: All right. Well, this -- this guy, Ramsey -- I thought he was F.B.I. What's he doing here?",
        "Talia: Yeah, do you know anything about him?",
        "Bo: I know that you two are going to be working for him. So I'll bet you that you can make up your minds on your own.",
        "Ramsey: Ms. Davidson, Lee Ramsey. I've heard so much about you.",
        "Viki: Ah. And I've heard absolutely nothing about you, which is odd, considering the fact that I publish a newspaper. I'm accustomed to having the news before everyone else.",
        "Ramsey: Well, I'm going to do my best to ensure that the news that's fit to print is good news, now that I'm in charge.",
        "Viki: Well, we'll see, won't we? Honey, why don't you come join Charlie and me, huh?",
        "Gigi: Thanks, but I really have to go -- soon.",
        "Viki: Well, you said that you wanted to go get Shane. Do you think he misses you?",
        "Gigi: No -- um -- no, I just -- I don't want him to overstay his welcome, that's all.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, I'm sure he couldn't do that. But anyway, I understand. I'm very glad you came.",
        "Gigi: Me, too.",
        "Viki: And you can take my car and driver, okay?",
        "Gigi: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Good night, sweetheart.",
        "Gigi: Good night.",
        "Viki: Well, congratulations.",
        "Ramsey: Thank you. Thank you very much, Gigi -- Gigi, remember, a good night tonight is up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What happened, Clint? You lose your date?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Are you really trying to kill me?",
        "Lindsay: If I was, you would already be dead, or at least in another nice, long coma.",
        "Nora: Oh, oh! God -- get off of me! Will you -- you know, if someone walked in here right now, what would they think?",
        "Lindsay: They would think you finally pushed me over the edge.",
        "Nora: Well, it's a short trip. Oh, my God! Did you put on a few pounds over the holidays?",
        "Lindsay: Oh, shut up!",
        "[Nora grunts]",
        "Lindsay: Stop wriggling!",
        "Nora: God, get -- get off of me! Aha.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Cheers.",
        "Starr: Cheers.",
        "Langston: Starr looks happy.",
        "Cole: Yeah, now. It's too bad she spent all that time being totally paranoid thinking we were hooking up behind her back.",
        "Langston: Well, I'd probably think the same thing if my best friend and boyfriend were spending all that time together.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, I mean, we were spending all that time together because we were planning this party for her. And that whole grief counseling thing, which we couldn't talk to Starr about, you know --",
        "Langston: Things got a little weird between us, right? That wasn't just me?",
        "Cole: You're right.",
        "Langston: You know what? I think that it's just because we were both going through so much, you know? I mean, we just got really close, you know?",
        "Cole: Yeah, we did. And no, I mean, you're right. Yeah, things did get a little confusing, but -- we're just friends, right?",
        "Langston: Yeah, friends. I'm really happy about that.",
        "Cole: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You found the note. That's your note. What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop it, stop it, stop it!",
        "Lindsay: I'm chewing!",
        "Nora: No, no, no, no! Don't chew, don't chew!",
        "Lindsay: Go away!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Perhaps Nora was so distraught over Bo's job loss that she lost control of her ever volatile emotions and just left.",
        "Clint: Are you enjoying this?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Blair: Dorian, what is going on here?",
        "Dorian: The mayor may have been my escort, but, darling, I certainly can't read his mind.",
        "Todd: What mind? He just turned a psycho into the police commissioner.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Who are you calling a psycho, Mr. Manning?",
        "Todd: You. You just put the last nail in your political coffin there, Lowell.",
        "Mayor Lowell: It's \"Mayor Lowell\" to you.",
        "Todd: What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Huh. Ramsey's the best man for the job.",
        "Todd: And what job is that, exactly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm going to go get my son and we're going to leave Llanview forever. I'm not going to cause any trouble for you, I promise.",
        "Ramsey: Okay, good. Thank you. Now, Shane is with his friend Matthew at the Buchanan mansion, isn't he? A good commissioner has eyes and ears everywhere. It keeps his citizens safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What exactly are you willing to give up, Jared, your sanity? Your good name? Our whole family's reputation?",
        "Jared: If you would just let me speak --",
        "Natalie: No. Why? So you can tell me again how you feel about me? Do you think that it makes me anything but miserable and sick to my stomach to hear you say that -- I can't even say it, it's so horrible.",
        "Jared: Being in love with someone -- how can that be horrible?",
        "Natalie: You know the answer to that, Jared. I don't -- I don't know why you're doing this. But we both know that we can't be together.",
        "Jared: What if there was a way?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, are -- are you going to tell me why you're planning on killing me, or is that a secret, too?",
        "Allison: You're not smart enough to figure it out? To complete the circle of life. To make those wretched people suffer.",
        "Jessica: Well, all the people that love me?",
        "Allison: Those few, yes. And those who didn't believe in Mitch, who wanted to make us suffer, because we were different.",
        "Jessica: I'm a part of Mitch. Mitch was my father.",
        "Allison: And it kills you to say that, doesn't it? Ha, ha, ha. Pun intended. If Mitch wanted you dead, it's good enough for me.",
        "Jessica: Well, what about my daughter? She hasn't done anything to anyone, and she's Mitch's flesh and blood. She needs her mother.",
        "Allison: The sweet, beautiful Bree --",
        "Jessica: Well, you're talking as if you've seen her.",
        "Allison: I held her in my arms, just like I held you, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Oh, God.",
        "Allison: She's so innocent, as you say. And helpless. I could have ended her life so easily.",
        "Jessica: Thank you. Thank you for sparing her.",
        "Allison: Poor child, you're all she has in this world. You'd think you'd be desperate not to leave her.",
        "Jessica: I am!",
        "Allison: Desperate enough to get down on your hands and knees and beg for your life? You have to think about it?",
        "Jessica: Please -- please --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Do you know why he got kicked out of the F.B.I.? No, you don't. Ahem -- he tried to kill a woman in Ireland.",
        "Mayor Lowell: In the process of attempting to save her life.",
        "Todd: Actually, just the other day, he tried to kill another woman. A woman and her son.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Lee Ramsey's a trained sniper. What he shoots at, he kills. So how do you explain that that woman and her boy are still alive? And -- and while you're at it, I'd like to know how you are still -- with your abysmally long rap sheet -- how you are not behind bars? You're a perfect example of what's wrong with the police department in this town.",
        "Blair: And you say he's doing his job?",
        "Dorian: I was certainly no fan of the now ex-commissioner. But really, Mr. Ramsey was very aggressive when he came to search my house a few months ago.",
        "Blair: He came in the house waving a gun at my daughter and her friend.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Well, they live with you husband every day. I'm -- I'm sure that barely made an impression, compared to what they're subjected to on a daily basis. Well, my mission here is accomplished, so I will be on my way. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",
        "Dorian: Well \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: One of my P.I. clients paid me in season tickets to the Sixers. They're having such a lousy season, I couldn't sell them.",
        "Adriana: Not to mention, you love going to those games.",
        "Rex: They're playing the Knicks this week, if you're interested.",
        "Charlie: Well, I mean, I'd hate to take the seat from your lovely fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Adriana: It's really not my thing.",
        "Charlie: Well, in that case, then yeah. I mean, I'd love to. I'm a huge basketball fan.",
        "Adriana: Well, now you know where you get it from.",
        "Rex: That's great.",
        "Adriana: Huh.",
        "Viki: So, the last time I heard, you two were engaged. When's the wedding?",
        "Adriana: That's a good question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Roxanne --",
        "Roxy: Oh.",
        "Clint: Have you seen Nora?",
        "Roxy: No, I haven't seen Nora lately. Have you seen -- uh -- oh -- forget it. Never mind. It's not important. It's no big deal, really.",
        "Clint: Okay, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: If you were a guy, I'd grab your jowls.",
        "Lindsay: If I was a dog, I would bite your finger off.",
        "Nora: Oh, quit -- oh, Heimlich, Heimlich, Heimlich.",
        "Lindsay: Oh!",
        "Clint: What the hell is going on out here?",
        "[Nora pants]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Okay -- I thought this was so important to me, being a Buchanan. But none of the Bukes ever gave a damn about me except Renee and you. I should have realized that you meant more to me than anything. But you see, I've had this dream my whole life, and I couldn't bring myself to give it up.",
        "Natalie: A dream?",
        "Jared: Yes, and it was a mistake, and I realize that now.",
        "Natalie: What are you talking about?",
        "Jared: It's only a clich\u00e9 because it's true. The truth can set us free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: Let's hear it.",
        "Jessica: Well, what do you want me to say?",
        "[Allison laughs]",
        "Allison: You're begging for your life and you want me to fill in the blanks? It couldn't be worth living.",
        "Jessica: It is!",
        "Allison: Oh, you're so vapid, girl. Is it because you grew up rich?",
        "Jessica: I -- I -- I got to grow up because of you, Allison. You let me grow up, and I thank you so much for that, because I have had a wonderful life and I am so sorry that you haven't. But it -- it doesn't have to be over right now for either of us. Um -- I -- I was really sick a little while ago, and -- and I -- I got a second chance, and you deserve one, too.",
        "Allison: To do what? Sit and rot in St. Ann's?",
        "Jessica: Oh -- I saw the look in your eyes when you were talking about Bree right now. I know that you have a heart, Allison. I know that you do. And you spared my life once, and you -- you spared hers, too. So, please -- please don't let Bree grow up without her mother. Please, I'm begging you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I asked both of you a question.",
        "Lindsay: She was going --",
        "Nora: She ate evidence. She wrote down that she was --",
        "Lindsay: She had the secrets, she was reading them --",
        "Clint: Shut up! You've been out here for God knows how long, so you probably haven't heard about Bo's news.",
        "Both: What happened?",
        "Clint: Bo was relieved of his duties as police commissioner. He's been replaced by some former F.B.I. agent by the name of Lee Ramsey.",
        "Nora: Ramsey?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Lindsay: Why did Bo lose his job?",
        "Nora: Like you have to ask -- like you don't know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What do you have on the mayor that you could make him -- you could coerce him into doing something like this?",
        "Ramsey: And what did you have that may have let you keep this job through years of bungling? I'm F.B.I.",
        "Bo: Former.",
        "Ramsey: Technically. But I worked my way through the ranks, I earned my position.",
        "Bo: Why are you in Llanview?",
        "Ramsey: The weather, you?",
        "Bo: It's my home.",
        "Ramsey: Oh. Not much here for you now. Ever think about going back to Texas, grazing the range with the longhorns?",
        "Bo: I'm going to get to the bottom of this, Ramsey. I'm going to -- whatever payoff that you might have made to the mayor --",
        "Ramsey: Payoff? Huh. You listen to me, rich guy. First of all, I'm going to be worth every nickel the taxpayers have to fork over for my salary. Secondly, what could I give the mayor that you couldn't?",
        "Bo: I don't know. But I will tell you something that you can take to the bank. I'm going to be a thorn in your side until I find out exactly what's going on here. What did I say, \"Thorn\"? No, hell, I'm going to be the whole damn bramble bush.",
        "Ramsey: Huh. You really work that folksy thing, don't you? Your father's gone. There's a power vacuum. Nobody to fight your battles for you but you.",
        "Bo: Do you want a fight?",
        "Ramsey: Huh! You can bring it.",
        "Bo: Not here, not tonight, but I will.",
        "Ramsey: Okay, let me know. I'll start losing sleep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Babysitter?",
        "Antonio: I only have her for another half-hour, except I wouldn't want to leave Bo like this. He seemed like he was in shock.",
        "Talia: Well, I doubt that he's ready to talk about it.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, you're right. So, let's not make this night a total loss.",
        "Talia: Okay, that's a good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: I saw you giving the mayor a hard time. You have that kind of sway?",
        "Todd: I own a major newspaper.",
        "Ramsey: A major newspaper?",
        "Todd: Why are you standing here?",
        "Blair: Because nobody else will have him around.",
        "Ramsey: No, clearly just to make your lives miserable.",
        "Blair: Huh. You will never have that much power over us.",
        "Ramsey: Oh, I think you've given that to me already.",
        "Blair: I know what kind of man you are.",
        "Ramsey: Really?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ramsey: Okay. Hmm. Do you know what kind of man your husband is, really?",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Ramsey: You know, just the other day, he tried to shoot a woman and her son. Did he mention that?",
        "Todd: Uh-uh. I forgot. I shot at a woman and her son. Shoot!",

        "Rex: Anyway, this being our first Valentine's Day as an engaged couple --",
        "Charlie: What, you don't want to spend it with a room full of people?",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Adriana: Have a good night.",
        "Charlie: Okay.",

        "Charlie: Oh.",

        "Charlie: Hmm?",
        "Viki: Um -- your other son -- the one you started out looking for in the first place --",
        "Charlie: Yeah, what about him?",
        "Viki: Well, obviously, you're still very sad about that.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I mean, it's just -- it took me a long time to realize that -- well, to come to grips with the fact that my son doesn't want me as his father.",
        "Viki: Are you sure?",
        "Charlie: You know, maybe coming to Llanview was meant to be for more reasons than one. Maybe it's time for me to start concentrating on what I do have, finally -- a young man who actually wants to be my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm not having this damn conversation one more time. You are my grandfather's son. We had a D.N.A. test to prove it. Pamela confirmed everything. So, unless you're telling me that in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, this is not true --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jared: Please don't answer that.",
        "Natalie: No? Why not?",
        "Jared: Because I have something else I want to say, and it could change our lives.",
        "Natalie: Huh. I have to take this. Yeah? Oh, my God, Nash -- no, I haven't seen her, but I'm going to tell Uncle Bo. All right, Nash, if you hear anything -- okay, thanks, bye.",
        "Jared: What -- what's wrong?",
        "Natalie: Jessica came here 45 minutes ago looking for Allison Perkins. I have to find her.",
        "Jared: Whew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Okay, if I were a nut case and I just escaped from a loony bin, where would I go to? Well, I know I sure as hell wouldn't come here. But Allison had some kind of master plan, like -- I don't know -- she's, like, gone, poof, without a trace.",
        "[Roxy sighs]",
        "Roxy: So where's the fire?",
        "Natalie: Roxy, we're looking for Jessica and Allison.",

        "Roxy: Well, how the hell should I know?",
        "Natalie: Okay, Roxy, look, Jessica is here, nobody has seen her. She could be in huge trouble.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, you know, now that you mention it, I think I saw someone that looked like her -- um -- over there. It was about 45 minutes ago. But -- I don't know -- you know, maybe it wasn't her --",
        "Jared: Okay, go tell Bo that Allison might be here.",
        "Natalie: What -- what are you going to do?",
        "Jared: I'm going to go look for Jessica.",
        "Natalie: Please be careful.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Allison, please, don't let my daughter grow up without her mother. Please, I'm begging you.",
        "Allison: I'm not moved to tears. But nice try. It's a shame you're never going to know the secret. Oh, but actually, it's going to be perfect, because it's going to be so much more painful and -- and heartbreaking for everyone else when they find out and you're not here. Tragic, really. But just what they deserve.",
        "Jared: Stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "Lindsay: What are you insinuating?",
        "Clint: The mayor told Bo that if he continued to be your guardian, he'd regret it.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, no, no. No, you cannot pin this on me.",
        "Nora: Not only do you get away with murder twice, you have now destroyed your dearest friend's career.",
        "Clint: Okay, let's not do this.",
        "Nora: The best commissioner that Llanview ever had!",
        "Clint: Stop it! Bo's out there wondering where his support system went. Now, let's go, ladies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Markko, how am I ever going to thank Langston and Cole for tonight?",
        "Markko: You already have. This party, putting it together for you -- it gave them something to focus on other than what they lost.",
        "Starr: I guess you're right. It's just whenever I think about all the stuff that's happened to them, how could I have felt sorry for myself? I mean, now, I have both my parents, I have great little brothers, I have amazing friends, and a great boyfriend that I love so much. I -- I feel so lucky right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I got some more bags.",

        "Cole: You know -- you know, earlier, when she was really mad at us?",
        "Langston: Yes.",
        "Cole: You know, and jealous and stuff --",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Well, it was then when I realized that I love her more now than ever. And I really hate that I've been pushing her away since my mom died, but I don't know what I would do without her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Holy moly! What the hell happened? All of Llanview's secrets unburnished for the whole world to see. Oh, my God! Oh, lame. Huh, oh, more lame. Oh, whoa. Oh, really whoa. Oh, I think that's one of mine. That is --",

        "Jessica: Wait, this is Jared Banks -- Buchanan, he's my uncle.",
        "Allison: Your uncle? Shouldn't he be a little bit older? Yeah, well, it's not my problem. Oh, very fortuitous, actually. I get to kill two Buchanans for the price of one!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know what kind of husband I have, and I know exactly who fired that gun.",
        "Ramsey: Okay. It's public record. The former commissioner, for some reason, chose not to pursue the case. Should I reopen it?",
        "Blair: Maybe you should.",
