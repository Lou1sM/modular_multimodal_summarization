        "Starr and her teacher are getting really close while working together and discussing genetics. The cops want to charge Todd with the murder of Wes. But there is no evidence pointing him to the crime. There is forensic evidence against Marty, however, since her finger prints were on the murder weapon and his blood was all over her. So they have no choice except to arrest her. John, however, indicates that he cares about Marty more than he cares about Blair. Lola tells Vanessa she believes she framed her (Lola's) father for the murder of her mother and believes that Vanessa might have killed her. Cristian and Vanessa sleep together. But Lola only trusts Langston, Markko and Tea. Ray escapes from prison, goes to Cristian's home, knocks him out and goes to find Vanessa."

        "T\u00e9a: There was someone else with Todd last night. Wasn't there, Blair? Do you want to tell them, sweetheart, or shall I?",
        "John: What's she talking about?",
        "Blair: I was, ahem, I was Todd's alibi last night. I was at his house.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mind sharing exactly where in his house you were?",
        "Blair: In his bed. I slept right next to him all night long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Okay.",
        "Starr: This is so cool that we get to be here after everyone else has gone home.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I, uh, I told the head of the lab I was doing a project on genetics, and so he set me up with my own set of keys. Okay, so the lab tech set this up for me. Now, you're going to notice on this baby, you're going to see a whole lot more than in the standard version we have at the school.",
        "Starr: Do you know how expensive this is? Like, they must really trust you.",
        "Schuyler: I know. Well, I grew up hanging around this hospital, and, um --",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Schuyler: Nothing, I just -- we agreed that I wasn't going to discuss my personal life, so --",
        "Starr: Tell me.",
        "Schuyler: I -- I was just going to say that if they do trust me this much, and if I'm here, which I am, it's because of my mom.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. I know how much you miss her. I bet you wish you had never met my dad or me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Oh, crud. I forgot to buy ice cream.",
        "Rex: I got it covered. I grabbed a rocky road while you were getting the frozen pizzas and five kinds of chips and dip.",
        "Gigi: This is lame, huh? Shane, you're never going to know your grandparents, but here, pig out. It'll help ease the pain.",
        "Rex: At least he'll get to meet his Aunt Stacy. What time does Shane get home?",
        "Gigi: Bobby's mom should be dropping him off any minute. I just hope he can handle all this.",
        "Stacy: Got you, sucker!",
        "[Squealing and laughter]",
        "Rex: It seems to be handled.",

        "Markko: \"Congratulations. You have been admitted to the UCLA School of theater, film, and television for the fall semester of 2009.\"",
        "Langston: Hey.",
        "Markko: Hey. Where did you go?",
        "Langston: I got you a present to celebrate you getting into L.U. Isn't it great?",
        "Markko: No. You're great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, there you go. Todd's alibi is the mother of his children. Could you possibly need anything else?",
        "John: Is it true? You slept with him?",
        "Marty: What's going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Shane, Shane, what are you doing home?",
        "Shane: Computer club was canceled.",
        "Gigi: How come Bobby's mom didn't call me?",
        "Stacy: Okay -- all right, time out, time out, time out.",
        "Shane: She waited to see if someone was home, and somebody was.",
        "Gigi: I see you've met your Aunt Stacy.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, the Shanester and I have been having a blast.",
        "Gigi: The Shanester?",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, sorry. I couldn't wait for the formal introduction.",
        "Gigi: No, no, it's fine. What else could you do?",
        "Rex: We just kind of wanted to tell Shane about his brand-new grown-up aunt.",
        "Stacy: Oh.",
        "Shane: I was totally surprised. I mean, you don't look anything like your old pictures.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, you know, I was ugly back then. It's okay.",
        "Gigi: Stacy, we don't say -- he's 10.",
        "Shane: Yeah, mom. I'm 10.",
        "Stacy: Sweetened with real fruit juice? Are you kidding me?",
        "Gigi: They're all natural. Shane loves them, don't you, Shane?",
        "Shane: They're all right.",
        "Stacy: Okay, let's see. Now, that's what I'm talking about. At least your dad came through for you.",
        "Gigi: Stacy, would you please take some of these groceries in to the kitchen? Rex and I need to talk to Shane.",
        "Shane: Is this about Grandma and Grandpa dying?",
        "Gigi: You know?",
        "Shane: Aunt Stacy already told me.",

        "T\u00e9a: Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe we have just eliminated Llanview P.D's favorite go-to guy as a suspect in the stabbing death of Wes Granger.",
        "Antonio: Who says Todd has been eliminated?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, Blair just told us that she spent the whole night in bed, next to Todd --",
        "Blair: I'd like to clarify something.",
        "T\u00e9a: Giving him an airtight --",
        "Blair: I'm clarifying something, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ooh, go ahead.",
        "Blair: Nothing intimate happened with Todd last night.",
        "Todd: That's cold, baby.",
        "Blair: Shut up. Shut up.",
        "Blair: Look, I drank too much last night, and I passed out, and he was supposed to take me home.",
        "John: Instead, you ended up in his bed.",
        "Blair: On his bed, John. I passed out.",
        "Antonio: You took her back to your place. Why not straight home?",
        "Todd: Because I have a restraining order against me, and I can't come within 300 yards of her place.",
        "Blair: Look, he took my keys, John.",
        "Todd: That's because she was a danger to herself and to others, which you would have noticed, John, if you hadn't dumped her for Marty.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Blair: Oh, God, shut up, Todd.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Antonio: All right, cool it.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Whispers] Not now, Ray.",
        "Antonio: What time did you get to Todd's?",
        "Blair: I don't remember.",
        "T\u00e9a: Was it before midnight, after midnight?",
        "Todd: She was in no condition to be able to read a clock.",
        "Blair: Oh, shut up.",
        "T\u00e9a: So, Antonio, if there's nothing else, we're out of here.",
        "John: If Blair was as drunk as she says, Manning could have left the house while she was passed out. She never would have known he was gone.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's a stretch, and you know it.",
        "Antonio: What about it, Blair? Is it a possibility?",
        "Blair: I was completely out, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: So out not to realize that?",
        "Blair: I didn't even realize that I was there. How could I realize that he was there?",
        "Antonio: Which means that he could have left and come back without your knowledge.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is this your story, Marty? That Todd broke into your little love nest with Wes Granger, finished what Wes started at the ball, and then snuck back into bed with Blair, as if nothing happened?",
        "John: It could have happened just like that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, sure it could have happened just like that, and Marty wants us to think that because Marty hates Todd. No secret there. She would like nothing more than to see him fry. You couldn't come up with anything better than that?",
        "Marty: I don't remember.",
        "T\u00e9a: Excuse me?",
        "John: Marty --",
        "T\u00e9a: Wait, wait, what did you just say?",
        "Marty: I woke up, and Wes was lying next to me with a knife in his chest. I don't know how it happened.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's very interesting. You have this statement on record, and you dragged my client in here to accuse him of murder? Here's your killer, standing right in front of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Starr, you are not responsible for what your father does.",
        "Starr: I'm always dealing with him and what he does, and whenever I meet someone new, someone that I like, I always have to wonder, \"Okay, is this going to set him off? What is he going to do now? Is he\" -- what are you -- what are you thinking about?",
        "Schuyler: Actually, I was thinking about genetics.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Schuyler: Well, you know, at the moment of conception, there's these two cells, and they combine, just two little cells, but when that happens, all this stuff is decided.",
        "Starr: Like what color eyes you're going to have, or whether or not you're going to have a big butt?",
        "Schuyler: Um, yeah, well, yeah, there's that, but we -- but we know that, but I'm thinking, what if it's more than physical qualities? You know, like a talent for public speaking or art or athletics, music, or, um, an inability to handle drugs and alcohol. I mean, what if it's all right there?",
        "Starr: Are you saying that you think your drug problem is because of genetics?",
        "Schuyler: Um...I don't know. There's alcoholism in my family, so maybe.",
        "Starr: Why were you thinking about that stuff when I was talking about my dad?",
        "Schuyler: Uh, well, because you kind of mess with that whole theory. I mean, somebody who's literally half Todd Manning shouldn't be so completely different from him. I don't know. I don't know how you do it. But we have work to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: You should have seen Cristian in his tux last night. He was the most handsome man at the ball. I wish you could have been there, mija, it was wonderful.",
        "Lola: Until the fights broke out.",
        "Vanessa: Well, Cristian and I were long gone by then.",
        "Lola: So you didn't see the man who was killed pull out a knife on Starr's father?",
        "Vanessa: You know, let's talk about something else. Um, like school -- how's that going, huh?",
        "Lola: It's okay.",
        "Vanessa: I know that being the new girl isn't easy, but you're lucky. You have --",
        "Lola: Lucky?",
        "Vanessa: Yes, you have your cousin Langston and --",
        "Lola: My mother's dead, and my father's in prison. Yeah, I'm lucky all right.",
        "Vanessa: Lola, what's wrong? I mean, ever since Talia's birthday, you haven't been yourself. Please, mija, talk to me.",
        "Lola: I can't do this anymore.",
        "Vanessa: Do what?",
        "Lola: Act like everything's normal when it's not.",
        "Cristian: What are you talking about, Lola?",
        "Lola: Ask your wife. She knows. You don't want me to remember, but I do.",
        "Vanessa: Mija --",
        "Lola: Stay away from me. I know what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You told Shane about Mom and Dad?",
        "Stacy: We were talking about you, and he was asking, like, what you were like when you were his age and --",
        "Shane: And Stacy told me that you'd laugh so hard, milk would come out of your nose.",
        "Stacy: And sometimes she'd --",
        "Gigi: Stacy. I wanted to tell Shane myself.",
        "Stacy: I'm sorry, Geege. I mean, he asked me what Mom and Dad were like. What was I supposed to say?",
        "Shane: She didn't do anything wrong, Mom.",
        "Gigi: It's okay.",
        "Stacy: No, it's not okay because you're biting your lip like you always do when you're trying not to cry.",
        "Rex: She kind of had this whole speech rehearsed and --",
        "Shane: We can still talk about it, Mom.",
        "Gigi: Are you okay?",
        "Shane: Well, I never really met my grandparents. So, it's not like I lost my dog or something.",
        "Gigi: You never had a dog.",
        "Shane: It's sort of like I never had grandparents either. I feel bad for you.",
        "Gigi: I'll be fine. I hadn't seen them in a really long time.",
        "Shane: Since they kicked you out for being pregnant with me?",
        "Gigi: How much did you and Shane talk about?",
        "Rex: Hey, Shane, don't forget -- we have that Flyers' game tonight. Why don't you run upstairs and grab your jersey, and we'll eat at the arena.",
        "Stacy: Gigi, I really am sorry.",
        "Gigi: Okay. It's just, I never told him about Mom and Dad kicking me to the curb. I didn't want him to feel like it was his fault.",
        "Stacy: How would it be his fault? He wasn't even born yet. I mean, I don't know. I don't have kids, but I would imagine you'd be better off not lying to him.",
        "Gigi: You think I'm lying to him?",
        "Stacy: What exactly do you call that whopper about telling him Brody Lovett's his dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: You know what I did?",
        "Lola: Just admit it. You used Cristian. You got him to think that my father was going to kill us so that he'd marry you and we wouldn't have to go back to Colombia.",
        "Cristian: Nobody used me, Lola. I knew what I was doing.",
        "Lola: You think so?",
        "Cristian: We got that letter from your dad.",
        "Lola: How do you know it was from him?",
        "Cristian: Well, who else would threaten you and Vanessa? And you're the reason he's in prison.",
        "Lola: You made me find that knife. You did it on purpose.",
        "Vanessa: I had no idea about any knife, Lola.",
        "Lola: You made me look in my old jewelry box when we were redoing the house, remember, right after you and my father got married? I didn't want to do it. I didn't care, but you pushed me because you knew the knife was in there. You put it there.",
        "Vanessa: What?",
        "Lola: She wanted me to testify against Papa to put him in prison, and then, when he showed up here in Llanview, she shot him to keep him from telling the truth.",
        "Vanessa: I shot Ray to protect you, Lola!",
        "Lola: My father was right. You framed him.",
        "Vanessa: Why would I do that, Lola? Why?",
        "Lola: Maybe you killed my mother yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: She had no reason to want Wes dead. There's no motive.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really? I can think of about 12 different reasons. Marty was drunk, she was partying, she went home, Wes wanted to get frisky, she didn't feel like it, he wouldn't take no for an answer --",
        "Marty: That's not what happened.",
        "T\u00e9a: I thought you just said you didn't remember what happened.",
        "John: Get off her case.",
        "T\u00e9a: How can I, when the police are on Todd's, and Marty is far more suspect.",
        "Marty: He was my friend.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wes was your friend? Well, I should hope so. You spent the night in bed next to him.",
        "Marty: It wasn't like that. It wasn't like that.",
        "Lewis: Marty, I would advise you not to engage with this --",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, listen. Wes Granger was stabbed to death. He was found in bed, next to Marty. She was covered in his blood, and you're trying to pin this on Todd?",
        "Marty: I am not a murderer.",
        "T\u00e9a: No? What would you call a woman who talks a man into trying to kill himself?",
        "John: Public service.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh, very funny. Come on, Todd. We're done here. Let's go.",
        "Blair: Why didn't you just take me home?",
        "T\u00e9a: Let's go.",
        "Todd: And miss all the fun?",
        "Blair: Could we just go someplace --",
        "John: Later. Can I speak to you for a minute?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so can you see the different pairs of chromosome partners?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Schuyler: Now, each chromosome has a similar partner except for?",
        "Starr: The male, who has an x and y chromosome.",
        "Schuyler: Good. Now, two identical versions of the locus is?",
        "Starr: Homozygous?",
        "Schuyler: And if they're slightly different?",
        "Starr: Heterozygous.",
        "Schuyler: Not bad. Not bad. You did the homework.",
        "Starr: Of course I did. Well, you make me want to do it, you know? You're a very good teacher.",
        "Schuyler: Well, it doesn't hurt that you're so smart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: It was about you, mija. It was always about you. It still is.",
        "Cristian: Lola, she cares about you.",
        "Lola: She cares about herself, and that's all. You just can't see it. I couldn't either, not till now, but once you do, it's so obvious.",
        "Vanessa: Lola, I love you like my own daughter.",
        "Lola: You are not my mother. I don't have a mother or a father because of you.",
        "Vanessa: That's not true, mija.",
        "Lola: Please, leave me alone.",
        "Cristian: Lola.",
        "Vanessa: Let her go.",
        "Cristian: Where did that come from?",
        "Vanessa: Her mind has been poisoned against me.",
        "Cristian: By Ray?",
        "Vanessa: T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know, Blair can swear on a stack of bibles that nothing happened between us, but John McBain is --",
        "T\u00e9a: Shh, I'm listening to my messages.",
        "Todd: Bad news?",
        "T\u00e9a: I missed a call while I was at the station.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, your other client?",
        "T\u00e9a: I have more than two clients.",
        "Todd: Let me guess, an innocent man is rotting away in prison.",
        "T\u00e9a: He didn't leave a message. He's probably furious with me.",
        "Todd: Because you didn't answer a call? Who is the guy anyway?",
        "T\u00e9a: His name is Ray Montez.",
        "Todd: Ray Montez. Oh, yes, Ray Montez. His ex-wife plugged him at the aeropuerto, did she not?",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, he's losing patience with me because every time he needs me, I'm taking care of you.",
        "Todd: Did I ask for your help?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, would you rather be another innocent man rotting away in prison?",
        "Todd: Call him back.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not like he has a private line in his cell. I dropped the ball on this one, big-time.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I thought you could juggle 15 at a time. Looks like you're slipping, Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't slip on this one, Todd. Vanessa Montez testified that Ray killed his first wife, and now I'm getting why.",
        "Todd: You care to share?",
        "T\u00e9a: I think she did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: I know that T\u00e9a is a family friend, but Lola is not coming up with these ideas on her own. She's getting them from somewhere.",
        "Cristian: You think from T\u00e9a.",
        "Vanessa: In the letter that Ray wrote, he told Lola to find someone to talk to, someone besides me, someone that she could confide in. What if that someone is T\u00e9a? What if she's putting horrible ideas into Lola's head?",
        "Cristian: Why would your own lawyer tell Lola things that aren't true?",
        "Vanessa: What are you saying, Cristian? You think I did kill Ray's first wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I can't believe I was so stressed out about this.",
        "Markko: Lang --",
        "Langston: Hey, you're coming over Sunday to watch the Oscars, right? Can't wait to see that.",
        "Markko: Look, there's -- there's something -- there's something I got to tell you.",
        "Langston: What -- Lola, what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Look, Gigi, I'm not dissing you. You were all alone, and you did what you had to do, and Brody was a great war hero, and you thought he was dead. Anyway, why wouldn't you try passing him off as Shane's father?",
        "Rex: Instead of the deadbeat who bailed on his mom.",
        "Stacy: Rex, okay, I didn't mean for it to sound like that.",
        "Rex: No, forget it. Everybody knows everything now. So, it's over.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, and everything's okay. I mean, Shane's a hunk of heaven, and he loves you. I mean, he's always \"Dad\" this, \"Dad\" that --",
        "Rex: It took some doing, but we're getting there. I'm very lucky to have him. His mom's not bad either.",
        "Stacy: We're all lucky. I mean, can you believe it? You guys were in Vegas for 20 minutes, and I spotted you guys in that casino. I mean, how crazy is that? It's almost like Mom and Dad were looking over us, wanting us to be sisters again. Okay, that was lame, huh?",
        "Gigi: No, it's not lame at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lewis: Detective, can my client go home now?",
        "Antonio: Not done yet.",
        "Lewis: Yes, you are. You have Dr. Saybrooke's statement, she's cooperated fully, so unless you're prepared to arrest her, I --",
        "Antonio: Lewis, we're waiting for forensics.",
        "Talia: I'm going to go and see if I can hurry those along.",

        "Marty: Water would be great.",
        "John: Yeah? Okay.",
        "Blair: John, um, could I just have two minutes --",

        "Vanessa: I loved him, Cristian. I really did. I thought that he was such a good person. I had no idea he was such a monster. How could I have been so stupid?",
        "Cristian: Hey, come on, you weren't stupid. Like you said, you were in love, and that can make us blind to everything else.",
        "Vanessa: Yeah, from that moment on, all I could think about was protecting Lola and myself. I got us away from Ray, but I was still afraid of him. You know, maybe -- maybe I did push Lola to remember that night, but I was desperate for Ray to be locked up somewhere where he couldn't hurt either one of us. Tell me I wasn't wrong to do what I did.",
        "Cristian: You did the right thing.",
        "Vanessa: But Lola doesn't think so.",
        "Cristian: Look, Ray reached out to Lola. Now, she's just confused. But don't worry, we'll talk to her. We'll figure this out.",
        "Vanessa: I thought it was over. Ray's trial, the threats, him swearing to come after us. I thought that once he was in prison, we could put it all behind us.",
        "Cristian: It is behind us. You're my wife now, and I'm not going to let him or anyone else hurt you. You got that?",
        "Vanessa: Hmm. I can't believe how lucky I am to have you in my life.",
        "Cristian: Well, I'm not going anywhere. You know, that roast can sit for awhile.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on, Antonio. You can't hold her much longer without cause.",
        "Lewis: He's right. Either release Dr. Saybrooke or fully charge her.",
        "Antonio: You know I got her for 48 hours, okay?",
        "Talia: I have the forensics report.",
        "Marty: What -- what does it say?",
        "Antonio: Your prints were on the murder weapon.",

        "Starr: Did you always want to be a teacher?",
        "Schuyler: Well, I grew up listening to my mom talk about all her patients, so I guess I was always kind of into science. I have -- I have a feeling that she hoped I would become a doctor.",
        "Starr: It was just too much school for you?",
        "Schuyler: No, no, that wasn't it at all. I'd already gotten my biology degree and I was thinking about going into med school, but, you know, I was -- I was messed up on drugs at the time, so it just didn't seem like a very good combination.",
        "Starr: So what made you decide?",
        "Schuyler: Ah, I'm sorry. Are you trying to get out of doing your work?",
        "Starr: I think you should just tell me.",
        "Schuyler: Oh.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, well. When I finally went to rehab and it started sticking, one of the counselors, he came to me and he asked if I would want to be that guy that talks to the younger kids and says, you know, why you should stay off of drugs and why you should stay clean, and I thought, really? Like, am I the kind of guy that somebody wants to learn from? What do I have to say? And my first kid, Joe, we called him Joe. He -- this kid, I would say something and he would look at me like I was talking another language. It was so frustrating. And I finally learned, you just have to be able to say the same thing 12 different ways for somebody to get it. And the look, Starr, the look in this kid's eyes when he finally got it, it was like -- it made it all worth it. For the first time in my life, I --",
        "Starr: You knew exactly what you wanted.",
        "Blair: Well, it looks like we can call it a night. If Marty's fingerprints are indeed on the murder weapon, looks like the case is closed.",
        "Antonio: Marty, can you explain how your fingerprints ended up on the murder weapon?",
        "Lewis: Don't answer that.",
        "Marty: I have no idea. I woke up and I reached for Wes. My hand was covered in blood. He'd been stabbed in the chest and so I started to scream.",
        "John: That's when I started banging on the door.",
        "Marty: I mean, I might have touched the knife then.",
        "Blair: Look, if your hands were already covered in blood, then maybe you are the killer.",
        "Lewis: Detective, are you formally charging my client?",
        "Antonio: Lewis, please! I am trying to help your client, okay? Now, Marty, I am going to ask you again. Do you have any idea how your fingerprints ended up on the murder weapon?",
        "Marty: No, no.",
        "Antonio: Do you think you touched the knife when you woke up next to him?",
        "Marty: I woke up and there was a dead man lying next to me -- my friend! I was half out of my mind! I'm sorry. I don't remember. I don't remember. I'm sorry.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, so am I. Because I'm going to have to place you under arrest.",

        "Langston: Lola, do you want to tell us what happened?",
        "Lola: I had a fight with Vanessa. It was awful.",
        "Markko: What was it about?",
        "Lola: The letter my father sent me. She -- she went through my things. She found it and she totally freaked. She said it was a threat and that my father wants me dead.",
        "Markko: But I don't understand.",
        "Langston: Me neither. I thought your father wrote that he loves you.",
        "Lola: He did. He warned me not to trust her, to be careful around her, and now I know why.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Vanessa: Oh, is that your phone? Do you need to get it?",

        "Stacy: Well, I'm not going anywhere. I'll be good. Have fun.",
        "Gigi: Well, all right. I bought some frozen pizzas at the store and we have leftover meatloaf from last night.",
        "Stacy: Gigi, I'm fine. I'll be perfect just as soon as I get out of these wet clothes.",
        "Rex: You okay? You sure? You're biting your lip again. I remember that, too.",
        "Gigi: It's silly. But I wanted to be the one to tell my son that his grandparents died.",
        "Rex: A, it's not silly. B, I don't think Stacy meant to mess anything up for you.",

        "Gigi: Well --",
        "Stacy: Go where?",
        "Shane: Well, Mom has to work tonight, so we have an extra ticket for the hockey game.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I -- I don't know if Stacy likes hockey.",
        "Stacy: I would love to go. Is that okay? I don't want to crash a family thing.",

        "John: But you don't know how many enemies this guy had.",
        "Marty: What does that mean? He was a good guy.",
        "John: It seems somebody wanted Wes dead, and it wasn't Marty.",
        "Talia: John, we're going to do a very thorough investigation.",
        "Antonio: By the book.",
        "John: By the book's a load of crap.",
