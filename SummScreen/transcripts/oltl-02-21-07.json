        "Bo, Antonio, and a fellow officer come into the squad room. They discuss Matthew, and his losing everything he has in the fire. Bo lets them know that he wants this arsonist case to be top priority. Cris and Jessica argue over the fact that Nash had told Layla that he (Nash) and her (Jessica) had just about made love. Jessica is beside herself, and can't believe that Nash would disclose something that personal to Layla. Layla instructs Nash to stay away from Jessica, but Nash knows that that is easier said than done. Layla spots Evangeline as she enters Capricorn. As Layla nears Vangie, she can tell that something is wrong. She questions Evangeline about it. Evangeline asks her about Cris. Todd sits in a booth at the Angel Square Diner when Marcie and Tommy come in. Marcie walks up to Todd's table, and asks if he minds if they join him. Very rudely, he tells them that, yes, he does mind. Marcie is thoroughly confused. John questions Michael about who had killed Spencer Truman. Michael is hesitant to tell him anything, but then opens up, and tells him that when he finds out who had killed Spencer, he would be sorry. John is confused.",
        "Viki and Clint play a board game, and are thoroughly enjoying themselves, except for the fact that Viki's wrist is paining fierce. Viki begins to talk about Dorian, a topic that Clint doesn't want to discuss. Viki begins to laugh, and tells Clint that she wonders what Dorian would think if she knew that they had spent the night together. Clint looks at her solemnly, and asks her, \"would she?\" Michael refuses to answer any of John's questions except to tell him that whoever had killed Spencer should get away with it . Jessica and Cris continue to argue over the fact that Jessica doesn't want Antonio to know about her little indiscretion. Cris doesn't agree with her by any means. Nash meets Date Harmon at Capricorn, and strikes up a conversation with him."

        "Bo: Sent Officer Black to the hospital to pick Matthew up. Excuse me.",
        "Antonio: How's he doing?",
        "Bo: Well, physically, he's doing as good as can be expected. The doctors said it was just smoke inhalation.",
        "Antonio: \"Just\"?",
        "Bo: It could've been a lot worse.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Well, I'm -- I'm glad he's doing ok, Bo.",
        "Bo: Well, my son almost died in that fire. So from now on, that case is priority one -- do you understand? I want this arsonist found, fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So you're saying it's true? You and Nash came close to having sex?",
        "Jessica: I can't believe it, I can't believe him. I can't believe that he would be that stupid to blab it to Layla.",
        "Cristian: If I were you, I'd be a hell of a lot more worried about what my brother's going to do when he finds out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You have to stay away from Jessica. God only knows what'll happen the next time the two of you are together alone. If you hadn't stopped, you know what would've happened.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I do.",
        "Layla: Don't even think about it, not if you know what's good for you.",
        "Nash: Oh, look, there's your sister.",
        "Layla: Nash? You have to forget about Jessica -- for your sake.",
        "Nash: Sorry, Layla. I just don't think I'm going to be able to do that.",
        "Evangeline: I need to find Cristian. Have you seen him?",
        "Layla: Yeah, but he left a while ago.",
        "Evangeline: Did he say where he was going?",
        "Layla: He didn't say much of anything. Vange, what's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Hey, Todd. Uh -- you here alone? I was wondering if you mind if Tommy and I join you?",
        "Todd: Yeah, actually, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Answer me. Do you know who killed Truman?",
        "Michael: All I know is that you're going to be real sorry when you find out.",
        "John: What does that mean? Huh? Mike, what is it about this murder you're not telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: How's Matthew taking it?",
        "Bo: How's he taking it? He's a little kid. He was almost killed. His home, everything he owns was all destroyed in that fire. I -- damn. Sorry, Antonio. Look, I'm not handling this very well myself.",
        "Antonio: Ok. Really, Commissioner, there's no apology necessary. I mean, this guy's gone after me and my brother. Trust me -- I want this guy caught, too.",
        "Bo: We have any new leads?",
        "Antonio: Other than the consistent use of turpentine as the accelerant, we haven't got much.",
        "Talia: The first fires were obviously connected. Vincent was the target and then Cristian was framed for doing it. Antonio is not only, you know, Cristian's brother, he was the cop who was investigating the case, so --",
        "Antonio: Which ties the arson at my property, too.",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you know, Nora doesn't fit this pattern.",
        "Antonio: Well, it could be a copycat, some -- some perp that she put away that's trying to get back at her.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, maybe all the victims were just selected randomly, although I doubt that that's likely.",
        "Talia: The fires could've been set to cover up robberies.",
        "Antonio: Anything -- anything valuable missing from Nora's?",
        "Bo: The place was burned so badly, we may never know that. CSI is working it right now.",
        "Antonio: Oh. Well, I suppose it could be some insane pyromaniac.",
        "Bo: What, you really believe that?",
        "Antonio: No, I don't -- unfortunately.",
        "Bo: All right. I want all the bases covered on this one. Why don't you two start working the streets right now? Talk to all our snitches. Tell them there is a big reward out there for the first guy who gives us a name, ok?",
        "Antonio: We're on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, my goodness! And I -- hmm -- seem to have won. I win!",
        "Clint: Triple game again. I had forgotten how you always kicked my butt at backgammon.",
        "Viki: Do you know I don't think I've played this game since we were married. And I had forgotten how much I enjoyed winning!",
        "Clint: Why wouldn't you enjoy when you always win? You want some more decaf?",
        "Viki: No, thank you. Dinner was really, really nice --",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Once I got there and dealt with the problem.",
        "Clint: Why don't you have one of these?",
        "Viki: Do you know the temerity of that woman -- Dorian getting Lindsay to distract me so that she could finagle her way into dinner with you?",
        "Clint: Could we please not talk about Dorian?",
        "Viki: I really don't know why I'm surprised. I know that Dorian would do anything to get her claws into you.",
        "Clint: I'm beginning to wonder if Nigel made decaf after all.",
        "Viki: Fine, we won't talk about Dorian any -- ah -- more.",
        "Clint: What's the matter there?",
        "Viki: It's my wrist.",
        "Clint: Still bothering you, huh?",
        "Viki: Yeah! It's sprained because Dorian spooked the horse.",
        "Clint: I thought we weren't going to talk about what's-her-name.",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint, how can we not talk about her when she continually insinuates herself into our lives? And I don't know how you can be constantly taking the high road and not allowing yourself to be provoked by the things she does.",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Viki: I was just wondering -- what would she do if she found out that we had spent the night together?",
        "Clint: Would you like to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: In case you didn't notice, I am here with my son.",
        "Todd: Yeah. It's kind of late to have him out and about, isn't it?",
        "Marcie: Well, you know, he went down early and then he woke up, so I thought I'd take him out for a ride. You know, but unfortunately, he's still up, so I thought I'd come here and share a bowl of soup with him, but --",
        "Todd: Oh, God.",
        "Marcie: You know what? I -- I didn't want to sit next to a stranger, ok?",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "Marcie: And even though you're strange, I didn't think you'd be rude.",
        "Todd: God, I don't want to hear your life story. If you want to sit down, sit down.",
        "Marcie: Fine. There's nowhere else to sit anyway. You know what? Would you mind watching him? I have to --",
        "Todd: Yes, I would mind!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Enough with the third degree, John. I'm not answering any more of your questions.",
        "John: Either I ask them or someone else is, Mike -- someone who isn't your brother, who isn't looking out for you, but you need to come clean with me now!",
        "Michael: Look, whoever killed Spencer Truman did the world a favor, ok? For God's sakes, John, the guy killed our dad! Look how many lives he ruined.",
        "John: I get it, Mike -- he deserved to die. Hell, I wanted to kill him with my bare hands! But now that he is gone, it is time for me to catch the killer before anybody else does Michael. And when you do find whoever did it, then what, John? Are you really going to turn that person in to face God knows how many years in prison, or even worse, death? And for what? For Spencer Truman? No, you know what? Don't -- don't even say it. I know what you're going to say -- you're going to say that you're doing this because dad would've wanted to have seen justice served, so you're doing this to honor his memory. Well, guess what, John -- dad is wrong this time, ok? And so are you. Whoever killed Spencer Truman should go free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Thank you, officer Black. Hey, son.",
        "Matthew: Mom on her way back yet?",
        "Bo: No, not yet. She went to get some clothes and some other stuff for the two of you. And then we'll get you all settled in over there at grandpa's house.",
        "Matthew: Why can't we stay at your house?",
        "Bo: Well, your mom and I talked about that and we thought that everything would be just a whole lot better, a lot easier if you were at grandpa's.",
        "Matthew: Why?",
        "Bo: Well, for one thing, the media won't know where you are. That's the last thing that you'd want to have to deal with right now.",
        "Matthew: I just don't get it. Who would do something like this?",
        "Bo: I don't know, Matthew. But I promise you, I'm going to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Whoa -- hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, it's all right. His money's no good here.",
        "Tate: Thanks.",
        "Nash: Sure.",
        "Tate: Do I know you?",
        "Nash: No, but I know you. You're Tate Harmon, right?",
        "Tate: Yep.",
        "Nash: Yeah. A fan -- big, big, big fan.",
        "Tate: You mean, you were a fan. I hung them up a little while ago.",
        "Nash: Yeah, well, you can't hang up your reputation or your records. Those are going to last forever.",
        "Tate: You sound like my mother or my agent. I'm not sure which is worse.",
        "Nash: Well, given the option, I think I'd rather be your agent.",
        "Tate: Please -- don't tell me you have a business proposition for me?",
        "Nash: No, but would it be so bad if I did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: He's furious with me. He must be.",
        "Layla: Why?",
        "Evangeline: I told Cristian I would be right back here and I -- I got held up.",
        "Layla: With Todd?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. Todd's going through something and I was -- I was just -- I couldn't just leave him alone, Layla.",
        "Layla: Ah, Cristian's jealous. It's good for him. Give him an hour to cool off and he'll understand.",
        "Evangeline: Not about this.",
        "Layla: What are you talking about?",
        "Evangeline: Todd kissed me.",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Evangeline: We kissed.",
        "Layla: Oh, my God. It must be in the water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: No, no, Cristian, you can't tell Antonio.",
        "Cristian: Are you going to tell him?",
        "Jessica: No! Why would I tell him -- what would be the point? It would just hurt him.",
        "Cristian: So, what, it's better to lie?",
        "Jessica: Well, I wouldn't be lying if he -- if he didn't -- if he doesn't ask if anything happened between me and Nash --",
        "Cristian: All right, Jess, enough with the BS, ok? It's a lie not to tell my brother what happened and it's even a worse lie for you to pretend you don't know that. I mean, come on -- how long have you been cheating on my brother with Nash?",
        "Jessica: I'm not cheating on your brother with Nash, ok? We haven't slept together!",
        "Cristian: Oh, oh, oh. Ok, so kissing and feeling up on each other, that's not cheating.",
        "Jessica: Ok, stop it!",
        "Cristian: Stop acting like this is not a big deal? It must be if you don't think about it or talk about it? The fact is that just because you didn't actually sleep with Nash, you still betrayed your husband! But I bet you got close, right? Huh, Jess? Did you get close to having sex with Nash?",
        "Jessica: Yes! All right, I did!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Would I like to what?",
        "Clint: Spend the night with me.",
        "Viki: Are -- are you serious?",
        "Clint: Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.",
        "Asa: Clint!",
        "Clint: Pa.",
        "Asa: Where the hell have you two been -- on the moon?",
        "Clint: What's the matter? Did something happen?",
        "Asa: \"Something happen?\" Just that Nora's house burned to the ground!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: How could the same guy not be connected to these fires?",
        "Talia: He'd be behind bars right now if I had been better at my job.",
        "Antonio: There's got to be some sort of connection.",
        "Talia: I had him, you know? I had him inside that building. He was mine.",
        "Antonio: You're going to have to let this go, Talia.",
        "Talia: Let it go? If I hadn't hesitated, then DA -- DA Hanen's house wouldn't have gotten torched and that little boy in there wouldn't have lost everything he owned. What if they had died? It would've been on me.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, it probably would have, but they didn't. Ok, look, the important thing is that they got out. All right, you froze. You shouldn't have, but you did. All right? You're going to have to move on, give yourself a break.",
        "Talia: I can't until I tell the Commissioner.",
        "Antonio: Yeah? What good is that going to do you now, huh? It's not going to change a thing. Right, and besides, what are you, some kind of derelict? No, you didn't take a shot at the guy because he -- because you weren't sure he was armed.",
        "Talia: It's all I think about, Antonio, and it's driving me crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: While we're waiting for your mom, want to order a pizza?",
        "Matthew: Not hungry.",
        "Bo: Oh, don't tell me that you could turn down a large pizza with double pepperoni on it?",
        "Matthew: No, thanks.",
        "Bo: You want to talk about whatever it is that you're thinking about right now?",
        "Matthew: It's nothing.",
        "Bo: No. Come on, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: It's not a big deal. I mean, I could've died and I didn't. Mom didn't, either. We're just really lucky.",
        "Bo: Yeah. You're very lucky. But I'll tell you, you've got every right in the world to be very upset.",
        "Matthew: I just can't believe all my stuff is gone forever. I mean, I know it's just stuff, but some of it just -- just can't be replaced.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Like what, though?",
        "Matthew: Videos Jen made for me. It's the worst part about all of this.",
        "Bo: I know. That's got to be tough, and I'm sorry.",
        "Matthew: I mean, I had so many pictures of her and Sammy, stuff they gave me.",
        "Bo: Ok, you know what? We'll talk to will, because I'll bet you he has pictures and he -- you know, maybe he can make copies for us, and Lindsay. And you know what -- Balsom. Balsom was her boyfriend, so you know he's got pictures and he'd love to help us. We'll make this a project, ok, and we'll work on it together. Ah, son. I'm going to fix this for you. I am if I can. But I'm just so glad that you're safe and nothing happened to you. Because I'll tell you what -- if anything ever happened to you, I don't -- I don't think I could live, you know? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: So is that why you bought me the drink -- so you could convince me to front some product you're pushing?",
        "Nash: No -- no, no, no, no, no. Not at all, not at all. I just read a lot about you. You're a good guy, great guy, great pitcher.",
        "Tate: Once upon a time, yeah.",
        "Nash: Well, short time, long time, it was a great time, good career. Hey, maybe some time you could sign -- sign a ball for my daughter.",
        "Tate: Sure.",
        "Nash: Great.",
        "Tate: What position does she play?",
        "Nash: Crib -- she's a baby.",
        "Tate: Oh.",
        "Nash: But I'm hoping she'll play softball sometime.",
        "Tate: What's her name?",
        "Nash: Brennan, but I'm supposed to call her Bree -- long story. Anyway, look, uh, I work here, so maybe next time you're in here, you could sign it. I'll keep a ball in the back of the room for you.",
        "Tate: What, you work here? What do you do?",
        "Nash: Manager. My day job is a vintner, though. I -- I own a winery.",
        "Tate: A winery, here in Pennsylvania?",
        "Nash: Yeah. Soil's rich.",
        "Tate: Like the women?",
        "Nash: Like the women.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Never mind. I just can't believe you and Todd kissed.",
        "Evangeline: It's not as bad as it sounds. I mean, he was -- he was hurting and I was -- I was trying to be there for him, Layla. And we both knew instantly that it was wrong and that it -- that it shouldn't happen and it will never happen again.",
        "Layla: Well, good -- good, because Cristian will flip.",
        "Evangeline: I know. I know.",
        "Layla: So, what are you going to do about this?",
        "Evangeline: I'm going to tell Cristian.",
        "Layla: What? Are you crazy? You think kissing Todd was a big mistake? Well, telling Cristian will be off the charts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So you almost had sex with Nash.",
        "Jessica: I don't want to discuss this with you anymore, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Did you want to have sex with Nash?",
        "Jessica: We didn't have sex, ok? We stopped ourselves before anything happened and we Both feel awful, horribly guilty about that, and we vowed that it'll never happen again, ok?",
        "Cristian: Oh, ok. So that -- that makes it fine?",
        "Jessica: Do you hear yourself right now? Do you know how judgmental you sound?",
        "Cristian: What's not to judge, Jess? You wanted to have sex with a man who isn't your husband, and even if you didn't actually go all the way, that's still cheating. And you know what -- my brother doesn't deserve that!",
        "Jessica: Look, I know that, ok? I feel awful, horribly guilty about it and I punish myself every day, but what I don't need, Cristian, is for you to all morally superior like you've never made a mistake in your life!",
        "Cristian: You're right -- I've made some terrible mistakes, but I'm trying to be a better person, which is exactly why I'm going to tell my brother the truth.",
        "Jessica: No, no. Cristian, Cristian, Cristian, please, please, please, please. You can't tell him, please. It'll break his heart.",
        "Cristian: You should've thought about this before you started messing around with Nash!",
        "Jessica: That's cruel, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Oh, cruel -- I'm being cruel and what you're doing to my brother isn't cruel?",
        "Jessica: You listen, and you listen really good. I have been through hell and back since this integration. I have had to deal with Tess and Nash memories. I've -- I've lain awake at night thinking \"what the hell am I going to do?\" I have cried myself to sleep more nights than I can possibly count, but I'm going to figure this out -- do you hear me, Cristian? I'm going to figure it out, because I love my husband more than anything else in this world. He is the man that I want to spend the rest of my life with.",
        "Cristian: Ok. If that's true, then why don't you go to your husband and explain to him your confusion, huh?",
        "Jessica: Because he's not --",
        "Cristian: Don't you think he has the right to know that, Jess?",
        "Jessica: I'm going to be able to handle it, Cristian. This situation is more complicated than you know, show some compassion.",
        "Cristian: I'm sorry, Jess. But so far, I haven't heard a really good reason why I shouldn't tell my brother the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: What is wrong with you? Todd, all I asked you to do was watch my kid while I went to the bathroom.",
        "Todd: I don't give a damn about your kid.",
        "Marcie: Why are you acting this way?",
        "Todd: There you go. See right there? It's a certificate of death. That's my son's name \u0096Rex gave me that. That is proof that my son is dead -- Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Why are you so determined about this? Hey, look. If you don't know who the killer is, you --",
        "Michael: I do know who it is, John. That's why I don't want them caught.",
        "John: Who is it, mike? Who killed Truman?",
        "Michael: Do you really want to know that bad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry, Todd. And I can't imagine what it's like to lose a child.",
        "Todd: Well, don't worry about it. You're not going to lose your child. And don't try to make me feel better, ok, because there's nothing so you know what? If -- since there's nothing you can do, would you -- would you mind taking your kid and getting the hell out of here?",
        "Marcie: Todd --",
        "Todd: Ok? No, no, no. Just -- please?",
        "Marcie: Yes. Fine. I'm truly sorry.",
        "Todd: Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: So, how did you get into pro ball?",
        "Tate: Well, it started when I was a little kid. I got pretty good at it -- all-state Llanview high, a baseball scholarship to ASU, first-round draft pick, a year in the minors, a couple of great seasons in the majors, and then blew out my arm and the rest is history.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Tate: How about you? How'd you get into winemaking?",
        "Nash: Well, I started to drink when I was a kid, drank all the way through high school, got pretty good at it, got a party scholarship to the entire southeast conference, couldn't get an honest job, and the rest is history.",

        "Jessica: I will give you the best reason in the world not to tell Antonio about me and Nash -- because I love him and I don't want to lose him. And if you tell him that I almost betrayed him, then I'll lose everything. I'll lose my marriage, our family. Do you really want that to happen?",
        "Cristian: Of course not. Look, Jess, I don't want to hurt you and I -- and I don't want to hurt my brother, but if he finds out about this later --",
        "Jessica: He won't. He won't, Cristian. Please? We've known each other for a really long time. Please don't do this out of a -- a spur-of-the-moment relapse, a stupid memory. Please don't do this to me. Don't do it to Antonio. Him and Nash -- they've become really good friends, and if he finds out about this, he'll feel betrayed by both of us --",
        "Cristian: He was betrayed. He was. And Nash isn't his friend. If he was his friend, he would've never done this to him. Look, I'm going to keep quiet for now, but you think about this and you think about this really hard. I really hope you do the right thing.",

I got -- there are theories coming out of my wazoo at the station! You think I haven't surmised by now that -- that the killer, whoever killed Truman, is somebody that I know?",

        "Michael: Because if you really care about me, if you care about me at all, John, you have to let this go.",
        "John: Why is that, Mike? Listen to me. You got to give me a name, man, or else they're going to think it's you. The evidence is pointing to you. Now, listen, I can help you, but you got to start talking to me now! I'm going to ask you straight up -- did you kill Truman?",
