        "Natalie: Are you all right?",
        "Michael: I need to ask you to do something for me.",
        "Natalie: Sure, anything.",
        "Michael: Talk to John. Get him to back off the Spencer Truman murder investigation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hello.",
        "Woman: Can I help you?",
        "John: Oh, I don't have an appointment or anything. I just wanted to know if Dr. Crosby had some time to see me today.",
        "Woman: Wrote a book and he's on tour with it. But he does have someone save his patients.",
        "Marty: John, hi. Can I help you?",
        "John: I came to see Crosby.",
        "Marty: Oh. - Well, I'm just -- I'm covering patients right now, and I've got a few moments, actually.",

        "Marty: You look like you need to talk to someone.",
        "John: Yeah -- Crosby.",
        "Marty: Well, do you prefer the chair or the couch?",
        "John: You're kidding, right?",

        "Marty: So how are you doing?",
        "John: I'm all right.",
        "Marty: Well, you seem anxious.",
        "John: Anxious? Th ioirthy not hn this guy, crosby, works for the police department, all right? He gets this stuff.",
        "Marty: Ok. I understand. But anything you say to me stays in this room. I can't be compelled to testify about it.",
        "John: I think I know who Truman's killer is.",
        "Marty: Well, that's good news, isn't it? Is it someone you know? John, is it someone close to you? Look, walking out that door doesn't change that fact.",
        "John: My brother, ok? I think mike may have killed Truman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Spencer Truman murdered our father. He ruined our mother's life. And now he's dead. Now, why does John have to keep this thing going? Why does John have to let him ruin his life, too?",
        "Natalie: I hoped this was all over. But it's not, not for John.",
        "Michael: Why?",
        "Natalie: He thinks that death was too easy for Spencer. He feels cheated.",
        "Michael: Don't you ever get sick of explaining my brother?",
        "Natalie: What do you want me to do, Michael?",
        "Michael: I already told you -- stop him.",
        "Natalie: And I already told you, I can't.",
        "Michael: 25 years of this. 25 years. And now John is going to fix it so that Spencer Truman can ruin a whole new generation of my family.",
        "Natalie: Are you talking about Tommy? How would Spencer's case affect him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.",
        "Todd: Can I get that back? That says he's dead and the blanket that he was wrapped in when he was born is all I have left. I don't think anyone can, really. You know what I've been obsessing about?",
        "Viki: No, what?",
        "Todd: Well -- when Margaret was alive and I knew she was pregnant, all I could think about was getting rid of her.",
        "Viki: After what she put you through, that's certainly understandable.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but she had a baby. She had my baby inside her. And it was -- it was -- it was not real to me. I never took it seriously. I was so -- I was so obsessed with making sure Blair never found out that I just -- just missed out. Just -- who cares about being in my son's life? I mean, I wasn't even there when he died.",
        "Viki: Todd, Margaret was violent and psychotic. There was no easy answer to any of that.",
        "Todd: I know. I -- I can't. I -- you think I'd have some kind of relief, but there's no relief. You'd think I'd be happy that I'm alive and Spencer's dead. I've got the rest of my life to live. And I've got two great kids already.",
        "Viki: Yes, you do. You have two great kids. But you also lost a son.",
        "Todd: Two sons. Yeah. Blair's miscarriage. Two sons, and that did it for Blair and me.",
        "Viki: No, I don't believe that.",
        "Todd: Well, I don't think positive thinking's going to bring Blair and me back together.",
        "Viki: Well, maybe not right now, but I'm sure it will happen in the future. But for now, you have to grieve for your son. And hopefully, take some sort of comfort in the fact that -- that it's over now. You know, the losses are all behind you.",
        "Todd: Not all of them. And I didn't even see this one coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I stood up at your wedding and talked about how lucky my brother was to have you. Now I find out he wasn't that lucky because he doesn't really have you.",
        "Jessica: Yes, he does.",
        "Cristian: I heard Nash. He said he was about one step away from sleeping with you, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: But we didn't. We stopped ourselves before it got too far. Cristian, please, just keep this to yourself.",
        "Cristian: I said I would, didn't I? But for the record, you have no right to ask me that. I'm doing this for my brother's sake, not yours.",
        "Jessica: Thanks.",
        "Cristian: I want you to swear to me you're not going to see Nash again -- except to hand the kid back and forth.",
        "Jessica: Cris, I --",
        "Cristian: That's the problem, isn't it? You don't want to stop seeing him.",
        "Antonio: You talking to someone?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- telemarketers -- they're so annoying. Anyways, I should get in the shower.",
        "Antonio: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Evangeline: What was that about?",
        "Cristian: I just found something out about Nash and Jess.",
        "Evangeline: What?",
        "Cristian: That it's not done between them. Not by a long shot.",
        "Evangeline: Really?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Yeah, and my brother doesn't have a clue. I told him. I told him it was a mistake to trust this brennan guy.",
        "Evangeline: Is that what upsets you the most, Cristian? That Antonio doesn't know?",
        "Cristian: It's just the whole thing upsets me. You know, Jessica knows that this is a huge mistake, and all she wants d keep quiet about it. It's just not right, man.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian --",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Evangeline: There's something I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: How can I help you?",
        "Miles: Hi, I'm Miles Laurence. I'm your wife's uncle.",
        "Antonio: I'll tell you what, Uncle Miles, why don't you turn around and walk away and don't come back?",
        "Jessica: Hey, Antonio, what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, ok. You know what? Just hold on. Look, I'm sorry. I have to take it. It's \"The Banner.\"",
        "Todd: Go ahead.",
        "Viki: I'll -- I'll take it in the library.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: I heard what you said to Jessica. I was -- I was listening.",
        "Cristian: Well, it's ok. I -- I wasn't trying to hide it.",
        "Evangeline: I know. And I understand your concern for Antonio.",
        "Cristian: I know. I know you get it. You know, one of the things I love most about you is -- is how you hold yourself to such -- this high set of standards.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian --",
        "Cristian: No, I mean it. You know, most people -- they -- they have this one set of rules for everyone else, but not you. You're --",
        "Evangeline: Todd and I kissed yesterday.",
        "Cristian: It's for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Well, I will tell Antonio that you stopped by, but I run the place, and like I said, we don't have any openings at the moment.",
        "Blair: I think you do.",
        "Nash: Really? Well, pardon me, Ms. Cramer --",
        "Blair: Blair.",
        "Nash: Blair.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nash: Why do you want a job here?",
        "Blair: Nash -- um -- you really don't know me that well. I know that, but have you ever reached a time in your life when you know that you need to make a change because the dreams just aren't cutting it?",
        "Nash: Yeah. And -- and your dream is to wait tables here?",
        "Blair: No. I've actually had a secret desire to sing. And I know that your last singer, Claudia Reston -- she's in rehab, right? So you have an opening.",
        "Nash: You want to sing here?",
        "Blair: Yes, I do. And I can start tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Miles, this is my husband, Antonio Vega, and he is a little bit overprotective.",
        "Miles: Maybe I should have stayed away, but I grew up with -- thinking I didn't have any family at all. And then I found out that I -- that I had this lovely niece.",
        "Antonio: Right. Can I talk to you a minute?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: Mm-hmm? Ahem. I don't like this.",
        "Jessica: I can tell.",
        "Antonio: I think he's figured out that his lovely niece is a Buchanan.",
        "Jessica: He has Spencer Truman's money. He doesn't need mine.",
        "Antonio: Yeah? Have youver thought about how he may have earned it? Look, honey, do I need to remind you what his brother did to you? He's a Laurence, right? There's got to be more to him than meets the eye.",
        "Miles: You're right. There is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You really think your brother might have killed Spencer Truman?",
        "John: I don't want to think it. Not yet, but everything I keep finding keeps leading me back to Mike. He's the best person I know. I was -- I was 10, almost 11, and little Mike -- he was -- he was 7.",
        "Marty: My son's father died very suddenly. I know what that must have been like for you.",
        "John: You see, I know there's a lot of guilt and anger. It's built up in there, but Mike -- he made peace with it, you know? He became a doctor so he could help people. That's why he's a surgeon. This doesn't make any sense. I mean, he's not the kind of person that would kill somebody. Maybe he never really did make peace with it. Maybe it wasn't because of my dad, or that wasn't all of it. I got this bad feeling inside. He killed him for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I was born with a birth defect. Disfigured. So repulsive that my father put me in a state hospital, and he turned his back on me. I've never met my brothers. I've never even seen a picture of my mother. And then Spencer found me. He fixed my face. And more importantly, he was my friend.",
        "Antonio: Truman.",
        "Miles: Yeah, I -- I know how you guys feel about him, but I can't apologize for my feelings. Spencer gave me a new life. And then someone took his. And now -- now I'm all alone again. Jessica, you're a good soul. Your wife -- she's my only blood relative. I mean, she's seen what I was -- the fact that she's willing to let me into her life -- maybe that means everything to me.",
        "Antonio: Does your mother know about Miles?",
        "Jessica: No, not yet.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. And how's she going to feel about you reaching out to him?",
        "Jessica: Um --",
        "Miles: No, I -- I want to meet Jessica's mother. That's why I came by. I thought it would be easier if she saw me in person. I'm not as scary as I sound in the abstract.",
        "Jessica: He could be right. I mean, Miles is all over the news. She's going to find out about him sooner or later, if she hasn't already.",
        "Antonio: Ok. All right, I guess everybody deserves a chance to prove themselves.",
        "Miles: Thank you. That's very generous.",
        "Jessica: Well, I guess I'll have to call carlotta and make sure she can take Bree for the day, and then I'll take miles over to llanfair.",
        "Antonio: Ok. I'm going to be at the club all day, so see you at the concert.",
        "Miles: You own a club?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, Capricorn. Nelly Furtado's playing there tonight.",
        "Miles: Really?",
        "Jessica: You know her?",
        "Miles: Well, yeah, I love her music. I used to download it from the internet and I saw a lot of concerts online.",
        "Antonio: Well, you should see her live.",
        "Miles: Oh, I've never seen a performance live. I haven't even been inside a club.",
        "Jessica: Well, hey, do you think you know anybody that could hook Miles up with a ticket tonight for the concert?",
        "Antonio: Uh -- yeah, I got a few connections.",
        "Miles: Oh.",
        "Antonio: I think I could work something out.",
        "Jessica: That's sweet. Anyways, I'm going to finish getting ready, and I'll get Bree ready for Carlotta, and I'll be back in a sec. Antonio:",
        "Miles: Thank you for giving me a chance.",
        "Antonio: Sure. So how long have you been out in the world?",
        "Miles: Well, not long enough. I've learned a lot from books, internet, television, but going out and seeing it for real -- it's a little intimidating.",
        "Antonio: I'm sure it -- it helps having Truman's money.",
        "Miles: I didn't ask for the money. I'm just grateful to have the opportunity to see what it's like to live.",
        "Antonio: My wife -- she's a -- she's a generous person.",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: And she and my children -- they -- they mean the world to me. So you remember that when you're figuring out how to live.",
        "Miles: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I just meant that I -- I think that my family has suffered enough because of what Spencer Truman has done.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, believe me, I -- I hear you. I do. But I don't -- I don't think I can get John just to sit back and let someone else handle this case. I mean, he won't let this go until he finishes writing the story.",
        "Michael: I don't think he's going to like the ending.",
        "Natalie: Well -- I mean, he could shake hands with the person who got his revenge for him.",
        "Michael: That's impossible.",
        "Natalie: Michael, John and I -- we're not doing so well right now.",
        "Michael: Well, are you ever doing very well?",
        "Natalie: Why are you being such an ass?",
        "Michael: I don't think you're listening to me. I need this thing to go away, ok? You know what? Maybe John's right. Maybe you do want to control everything. I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. I -- I'm under a lot of pressure here. I've been really stressed out because of this whole Spencer Truman murder thing. And -- and of course, I want you and my brother to be together and -- and be happy.",
        "Natalie: Well, we're working on it. But if I push what you want on him right now, I'll lose him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So do you have any proof that Michael killed Spencer?",
        "John: What am I doing? I can't talk to you about this.",
        "Marty: Well, you obviously need to talk to somebody, and I'm your best choice, because everything you say to me -- it stays confidential.",
        "John: Truman was stabbed with surgical scissors. Mike was in the hospital the night he died. There's forensics evidence that puts him in the room where Truman was killed. As far as the motive goes --",
        "Marty: Spencer killed Michael's father, too.",
        "John: No, Mike -- he's not an eye-for-an-eye kind of guy, all right? He's better than that. That's more like something I would do, all right? And mike knows that. I think mike thought it was just a matter of time before I killed Truman myself.",
        "Marty: Well, that doesn't sound like the kind of man you've been describing to me.",
        "John: No. You don't understand. This all comes -- this goes back to when my dad died. You know, I as forced to grow up real fast. I had to become the man of the house.",
        "Marty: At 11? I mean, that's way too young for that kind of responsibility.",
        "John: What I'm trying to say is, you see -- I stayed home, all right? But mike -- he had opportunities, you know? He went off to this boarding school up north, in Massachusetts. I --",
        "Marty: Well, how -- how did a single-parent family afford boarding school?",
        "John: Oh, Mike -- he's real smart. I mean, you know -- you wouldn't know it to look at him, you know. I would never say it to him, but he's bright, and, you know, he got a scholarship. He wanted out, he never looked back.",
        "Marty: Do you think he felt guilty about abandoning you?",
        "John: Yeah. Maybe.",
        "Marty: Still, killing a man is a rather extreme way to make amends.",
        "John: You got brothers or sisters?",
        "Marty: I'm an only child.",
        "John: Well, the thing between me and Mike -- it's as solid as it gets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Your boy doesn't give up, does he? Of course, you knew that.",
        "Todd: Evangeline, don't ignore me. Please, don't do that.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I guess you don't want to talk to him with me here.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian -- uh -- I can explain. Just let me --",
        "Cristian: What's -- what's -- what's there to explain? You cheated on me.",
        "Evangeline: No. It wasn't that kind of kiss.",
        "Cristian: Oh, so you got categories?",
        "Evangeline: No. All I know is that it wasn't -- it wasn't romantic.",
        "Cristian: Oh, right. So you're standing here and telling me that kissing Todd was like kissing your sister?",
        "Evangeline: No. No, I -- I went -- I went to see him and he had just gotten proof that his son -- the baby that he'd been looking for -- is dead.",
        "Cristian: Oh.",
        "Evangeline: And he was, like, devastated. I mean, it was like he had nothing and no one. And I was comforting him because he was in a lot of pain, and --",
        "Cristian: Right, and then -- and then he goes for it. He uses a little dead baby --",
        "Evangeline: No, no!",
        "Cristian: To get to first base.",
        "Evangeline: It wasn't -- it wasn't like that!",
        "Cristian: Look, I get the picture, ok? I get it! And it makes me sick. You know, we came home last night and made love.",
        "Evangeline: Because I -- I wanted you.",
        "Cristian: You sure you weren't working off the head of steam you built up with Manning?",
        "Evangeline: How can you say something like that? How can you even say something like that to me, Cristian? What happened with Todd didn't mean anything to me. What happens with you every single time I'm with you -- that's what's real. That is what's real to me.",
        "Cristian: And how am I supposed to believe that?",
        "Evangeline: Because it's the truth. And because I thought if I was honest with you, then maybe we could get past this.",
        "Cristian: Evangeline, if it was any other guy, you might be right. But it was Todd, the guy that's been after you for months. The guy that knew Vincent Jones was setting me up and he kept his mouth shut. You kissed him, and that means we're a lie.",
        "Evangeline: No!",
        "Cristian: We're a lie!",
        "Evangeline: Cristian --",
        "Cristian: We are a lie. And I don't want any part of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So you think Michael was so invested in your obsession with getting Spencer that he killed him for you?",
        "John: I don't know. But after everything that's happened, who knows what a person's capable of?",
        "Marty: Didn't he and his wife just adopt a little boy?",
