        "Gigi finds out for the first time, the startling news that Rex is not the father of Stacy's baby. Schuyler is. Hearing that, she assumes the only way that could happen is for Schuyler to have slept with Stacy. He protests that he did not. She was initially pregnant by Rex but then miscarried and told nobody. And shortly thereafter, she had to find a way to hold onto Rex and make him think that she was still pregnant with his child. So she went to drastic measures to drug him. But when Gigi finds out that Schuyler has known that he's the father of Stacy's baby since before she and Rex broke up and before she started seeing him, she feels betrayed and cannot accept that. Jessica only remembers her life up until her senior year in high school. She has no recollection of finding out that Natalie is her sister, nor of having Bree, nor meeting Brody."

        "Nora: Yes. Okay. Get your coat. Have Uncle Bo help you with your coat.",
        "Shane: Sorry this didn't work.",
        "Nora: Oh, you were great. You were absolutely great. You're already a big brother. Oh, it's perfect. Okay. I will...be in touch.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "[Kiss]",
        "Nora: Let me get my coat.",
        "[Nora laughs]",
        "Nora: Come on, sweetie.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bo: Girls are gone. Thought they'd never leave. There's got to be a basketball game or something.",
        "Shane: Whatever.",
        "Bo: Shane.",
        "Shane: Okay, I'm not gonna throw my crayons on the ground, but I really want to see my mom and dad. And the baby.",
        "Bo: Okay. Let me see what I can do about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Can I see the baby before she goes into surgery?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Yeah, you can see her while we finish the tests, but then we have to prep her.",
        "Oliver: Uh, Schuyler? I'm gonna take care of the incident reports, but if I need a statement--",
        "Schuyler: I'll be here. Thank you, Oliver, for what you did at the lake. You saved my baby.",
        "Oliver: It's my job.",
        "Kyle: Good luck.",
        "Rex: I pray that baby makes it.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, so do I.",
        "Rex: So, you ready to man up and claim the baby as your own, now that Stacy's not part of the deal? Or is it okay, because you have completely destroyed my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: See? She totally recognizes me. How could a twin forget?",
        "Jessica: Twin?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: I don't have a twin.",
        "Natalie: Jess, it's me. You just recognized me.",
        "Jessica: I have a sister named Natalie.",
        "Marty: Right. That's right. You remembered. Anything else?",
        "Jessica: Well, your boyfriend used to be Natalie's boyfriend.",
        "Natalie: Right. John McBain. You know him.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Marty: It's okay if you don't remember. You don't need to pretend. I mean, the most important thing is to be honest with us.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, what you need to know is that you're safe and you are surrounded by people who love you.",
        "Jessica: This is my twin?",
        "Viki: Yes, honey.",
        "Jessica: I've never met her.",
        "Natalie: Jess.",
        "Jessica: She doesn't look like me.",
        "Natalie: We have different fathers.",
        "Jessica: Daddy.",
        "Clint: I'm here, Jess.",
        "Jessica: This is crazy. Twins with different fathers? A twin I don't remember? I have 3 brothers--Kevin, Joey, Cord. I have one sister--Megan--and she's dead. And what year is it? Someone tell me. What year is it? Because the nurse said that it was 2010, and that can't be right.",
        "Viki: It is. It is right.",
        "Marty: You know, I think-- I think Jessica should talk to her parents for a little bit, okay?",
        "Natalie: See you soon.",
        "Clint: What should we do? How should we handle this?",
        "Marty: Be honest. You and Viki are her closest anchor to reality right now, and if you lie or you withhold information, you're just gonna lose her trust.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "Jessica: How can it be 2010?",
        "Viki: It is, honey. The thing is, you've had a trauma, and it just made you forget some things, that's all.",
        "Jessica: A sister?",
        "Viki: She was actually raised somewhere else.",
        "Clint: Honey, we didn't even know she existed.",
        "Jessica: Are there a lot of people I don't know?",
        "Viki: I don't know about a lot, but there are probably some that will be new.",
        "Jessica: Who's Bree?",
        "Viki: Bree is your daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Take your shots, Rex. Right now, all I can think about is that baby.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Rex: Hello.",
        "Bo: Hey, Balsom. Did you get my message?",
        "Rex: Sorry. I haven't even checked.",
        "Bo: I figured you were busy at the hospital. We're back in Llanview.",
        "Rex: Good.",
        "Bo: How's the baby?",
        "Rex: She's hanging in. She needs--",
        "Bo: Hey, hold on one second. There's somebody who wants to talk to you.",
        "Shane: Dad!",
        "Rex: Hey! Shane, it's good to hear your voice. How was the ranch?",
        "Shane: Good. We rode horses.",
        "Rex: Awesome.",
        "Shane: But I missed you.",
        "Rex: I missed you, too.",
        "Shane: How's my baby sister? Is she cute?",
        "Rex: She's...really little.",
        "Shane: Well, can I come to the hospital to see her?",
        "Rex: That's not possible.",
        "Shane: When will she come home?",
        "Rex: I will be home in a little while and I will tell you all about the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: So, what do you think about the new digs?",
        "Oliver: Wow. Roxy really is your best friend.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, it's plenty of room to relax. You should get off your feet.",
        "Oliver: I told you, I'm fine.",
        "Kyle: Okay, well, you could let me take care of you a little bit. Are you hungry?",
        "Oliver: No. I should be, right? But I'm still pretty keyed up.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, well, it's no wonder. You had a hell of a day. Do you remember how it started?",
        "Oliver: Oh, yeah. Chasing Mitch Laurence, shooting his accomplice, getting rescue to come for Jessica. Looking for John and Natalie after an explosion, pulling Rex and Schuyler off of each other, pulling Gigi out of a lake, and not getting Stacy out.",
        "Kyle: Hey.",
        "Oliver: This might be the longest day of my life.",
        "Kyle: Forgot about the baby.",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "Kyle: Just now. You never mentioned her once.",
        "Oliver: We did everything we could. It's up to the doctors now.",
        "Kyle: Oliver, you couldn't get out of the hospital fast enough.",
        "Oliver: My job was done.",
        "Kyle: Yeah. Unless you're the father.",
        "Oliver: No. You heard Schuyler. He said he's the father.",
        "Kyle: Because Stacy told him that, okay, but we both know that there's just as much a chance--",
        "Oliver: Kyle, just give it up, okay? I can't be that little girl's father.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, you had unprotected sex with her mother, so you definitely could be.",
        "Oliver: No. I can't. Come on, don't you get it?",
        "Kyle: No. Actually, Oliver, I don't, so why don't you just explain it to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I have so many questions I don't even know where--",
        "Rex: Shane's home. He just called. He says he wants to see his little sister.",
        "Gigi: God.",
        "Rex: Gigi, I think he deserves honest answers.",
        "Gigi: You're absolutely right. I have to stay with the baby.",
        "Rex: I know. I'll handle it.",
        "Gigi: Rex? Tell Shane I will be home as soon as I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How can I have a daughter? I would remember that, wouldn't I? How can--",
        "Clint: Well, maybe you will, honey.",
        "Viki: She's a beautiful little girl.",
        "Jessica: Who's her father? Is it that cop that keeps on saying he's my boyfriend? Is that\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: She looked at us like we were strangers, Brody.",
        "Brody: She'll come back. She has to.",
        "Natalie: Could this be permanent?",
        "Marty: If the police confiscated the ECT equipment, we might be able to see what dose was administered and how, but even then, it wouldn't tell how her-- how she reacted, and what brain centers were targeted. The human consciousness is a mystery. And with Jessica's history, it's really hard to tell how she was affected.",
        "Natalie: But she wants to remember. That's why she said my name, right?",
        "Marty: She wants to survive. I mean, you know she's safe now, but can you imagine? Can you imagine what the world looks like to her right now?",
        "Brody: She must be scared to death.",
        "Marty: Exactly.",
        "Natalie: But we can--we can help her. I mean, that's okay, right? We can try?",
        "Marty: Yeah. Oh, yeah. It can't hurt to try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Who's Bree's father?",
        "Viki: He was a terrific guy. His name was Nash Brennan, but he passed away.",
        "Jessica: I don't remember. I don't remember, not even his name. What happened?",
        "Clint: You've got a lot to catch up on. You don't have to do it all at once.",
        "Jessica: It's 2010. That's 13 years. That's a lifetime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Look who's here!",
        "Nora: We just--we couldn't wait. I hope this isn't a bad time. We just--we had to come. She wanted to see her mommy and everything else. Is Jessica awake?",
        "Marty: Yes. But it's a little complicated.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Do you have a picture of Bree?",
        "Viki: Yes, actually, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Dad.",
        "Rex: Dude. I'm glad you're safe.",
        "Shane: Yeah, we just hung out. Bo says I'm a natural ranch hand.",
        "Bo: Oh, you gotta see this kid muck out stalls.",
        "Rex: Yum. Let's sit down.",
        "Shane: Ha ha. Yeah, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it.",
        "Rex: Thanks, Bo.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Shane: So, when does the baby come home? I want to see her.",
        "Rex: I know you do.",
        "Shane: Does she have a name yet?",
        "Rex: Sierra Rose.",
        "Shane: Oh. That's...",
        "Rex: Aunt Stacy named her.",
        "Shane: Before she died? I already know. I'm sorry she's dead.",
        "Rex: Me, too. I know Stacy did a lot of bad stuff to us, but she really loved her baby and she died trying to get to her.",
        "Shane: So, how come the baby's still in the hospital? Because she's too little?",
        "Rex: That's part of it. She has a problem with her heart and they're doing an operation on her today.",
        "Shane: Whoa.",
        "Rex: Yeah, it's pretty intense, but the doctors say that she's gotta have it.",
        "Shane: Or what? My baby sister could die before I even see her?",
        "Rex: We don't know that. And here's the thing, Shane. Turns out the baby's not your sister.",
        "Shane: What?",
        "Rex: That's why she was so tiny. She was born early. And somebody else is the dad, not me.",
        "Shane: Who?",
        "Rex: Schuyler Joplin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Dr. Gangemi might be able to do a complete repair in this surgery. They'd only have to operate once, which is better for the baby, so...",
        "Gigi: He told me.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, please. I know you have questions. Just-- ask me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: There's nothing to explain, okay? Schuyler's the father.",
        "Kyle: Based on what?",
        "Oliver: Stacy put his name in her will as guardian.",
        "Kyle: Really?",
        "Oliver: Yes. Thank you. Look, Stacy's sure of it. Schuyler's sure of it. You're the only one who isn't.",
        "Kyle: Because you can't be positive without a DNA test.",
        "Oliver: No. We can't do that.",
        "Kyle: Okay, maybe now is not the right time to have brought this up.",
        "Oliver: You think?",
        "Kyle: Okay, but once the baby is out of the woods and stable, it's easy enough. I already told you. You don't have to do anything. I can get a sample off a hairbrush or a toothbrush or--or a bottle of water, okay, and then all I have to do is compare the results to the baby's DNA and--",
        "Oliver: We're not gonna do that.",
        "Kyle: Oliver, you may not want to be this baby's father, but you have a responsibility to that little girl.",
        "Oliver: That's right. The kid's life has been tough enough already.",
        "Kyle: That's right.",
        "Oliver: Okay, look, she has-- she needs a mother and a father. Gigi loves that baby already. She hasn't even put it down, and then she's with Schuyler now. They'll raise the baby together.",
        "Kyle: The baby's mother is dead, Oliver. And you could be the father. That means legally--",
        "Oliver: No. Kyle, forget legally, okay? I want what's right. The baby should be with normal parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Gigi.",
        "Gigi: My sister is dead... and her baby is so sick she could die, too. Rex, who I thought for 9 months was this baby's dad, isn't. It's you. Have I got that right?",
        "Schuyler: Yes.",
        "Gigi: Listen, I don't know where to start, okay? I have no idea where to start. So if you have something to say to me, please, please do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Why do you care about me and Natalie so much, anyway?",
        "Todd: I'm looking out for Marty.",
        "John: Like you did when you held her prisoner?",
        "Todd: Well, I didn't get her thrown in jail.",
        "John: Yeah. You're usually doing that yourself. But when you screw up your own life so much, maybe you decide to move on to somebody else's. What happened? T\u00e9a throw you out?",
        "Todd: No, you don't know what you're talking about.",
        "John: No, I think I do.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Well, anyway, I got to call my editor. If this story's not out first thing tomorrow, he's fired.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: You sure you want to do that?",
        "Todd: Well, I can get a new editor.",
        "John: What about a new sister?",
        "Todd: All right, what does Viki have to do with this?",
        "John: How is she going to feel when you run this story about her daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Come here, you. I'm missing my little niecey.",
        "Nora: High school? That's--that's the last thing Jessica remembers?",
        "Marty: For now.",
        "Nora: She doesn't remember anything else?",
        "Marty: Or anyone.",
        "Bree: I want to see my mommy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: This little girl's mine? My daughter? How can I not remember her?",
        "Clint: Honey, it's okay. There's no rush.",
        "Viki: Daddy's right, you know. You've got plenty of time.",
        "Clint: Things could come back to you all at once, or in bits and pieces. Either way, you're going to be all right.",
        "Marty: Hey. There's someone here to see you.",
        "Jessica: Is it someone I know?",
        "Nora: Nora Buchanan?",
        "Jessica: Nora--is she with Uncle Bo?",
        "Marty: No, she brought Bree.",
        "Jessica: My daughter?",
        "Marty: Yes. But you don't have to see her if you're not ready yet.",
        "Jessica: Yes, I--I want to see her. If there's anyone that could bring me back, it would be her, right? Let her in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Nor--normal parents? You mean straight parents, right?",
        "Oliver: You know what? I'm going to shower.",
        "Kyle: No. No, not now, you're not.",
        "Oliver: Would you forget it, Kyle?",
        "Kyle: No, no, you said it.",
        "Oliver: Oh, God. Please, could we not do this right now?",
        "Kyle: So you think you can't be a dad because you're gay?",
        "Oliver: No, of course I can. We have the right to do and be whatever we want.",
        "Kyle: And you don't believe a word of that.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, because I live in the real world.",
        "Kyle: Real world? The real world where only straight couples can raise kids?",
        "Oliver: Oh, God...",
        "Kyle: How does that normally work out, anyway? What's the divorce rate now? And what about the kids that start out with only one real--one real parent? Oliver, you are a good, caring, honorable man--with a partner who loves you. Isn't that what a child needs?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. She'll have that.",
        "Kyle: With Gigi and Schuyler? Were you even watching back there? Did you see what happened when he told her that was her kid? Did you see her face? She had no clue! Who knows if they'll even be together tomorrow, Oliver?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: We were all there when Stacy had the pregnancy test. Remember? At the hospital?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: She said it was Rex's baby. And you never once said \"maybe it's mine.\"",
        "Schuyler: No, it wasn't. It couldn't have been.",
        "Gigi: Ha! If it's your baby, then you had to have been sleeping with Stacy at the same time.",
        "Schuyler: No, Gi--no, Gigi, I was never at any point sleeping with Stacy. It was--okay. Okay, Stacy slept with Rex, she got pregnant--that was the test we all saw. That was Rex's baby.",
        "Gigi: \"Was\"?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, and--yeah. And then she had a miscarriage.",
        "Gigi: When?",
        "Schuyler: I don't know. I don't know. Sometime early on, I guess.",
        "Gigi: You guess?",
        "Schuyler: I didn't--you know, I don't--I didn't know any of this at the time, okay? But Stacy was devastated. She wanted a baby to hold on to Rex. She thought it would make him love her. She was desperate to--to still be pregnant, and so she drugged me, okay? And she had sex with me. I know, I don't--I don't even remember it happening. I thought I would have stopped it before we did anything, because all I could think about then, or ever, was being with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Has Stacy lied about her baby?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Shane: She really messed with you, and Mom.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Your Aunt Stacy had a lot of problems. But she's gone now, so let's not waste any time hating her. You still have a big job.",
        "Shane: What's that?",
        "Rex: Well, you're not going to be a big brother, but you are going to have a cousin. And your little cousin does not have a mom, so she needs you now even more.",
        "Shane: Yeah?",
        "Rex: Well, she's still the same little girl she was an hour ago and you couldn't wait to meet her. She's still a Morasco.",
        "Shane: You're right.",
        "Rex: You in, cousin Shane?",
        "Shane: I'm in.",
        "Rex: Well, why don't you unpack like you live here?",
        "Shane: Yes. Home!",
        "Rex: Is that the best kid, ever?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Rex: I see him jump stairs like that and I think about where we were a year ago.",
        "Bo: Where you were a day ago.",
        "Rex: Hell, I'm probably the only person who almost didn't die up on that mountain.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Rex: Well, I saw Gigi almost die. And I did watch Stacy die.",
        "Bo: You were there? Oh. And now you lost a baby.",
        "Rex: Well, at least she's alive.",
        "Bo: But you lost her.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I guess so. Even though she's not mine, I can't help worrying about the baby. I can barely think about what happens next. This baby broke me and Gigi up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I want--I wanted to tell you, Gigi. That's why I was driving up the mountain in a snow storm.",
        "Gigi: When you called, you said it was about the baby.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: You sounded crazed.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I--I know, I was. I needed you to know.",
        "Gigi: But the signal was so bad, I lost every other word. I did hear that Stacy wasn't really in labor. She had just come into the hospital.",
        "Schuyler: Right.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God. Is that--is that how you found out you were the dad? She just comes into the hospital and springs it on you out of nowhere? In the middle of this fake labor scam?",
        "Schuyler: No. No, I already knew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Your daughter--she knows you're hurt, but she needs your reassurance.",
        "Jessica: I know the feeling.",
        "Marty: Whether you recognize her or not, are you up for that?",
        "Jessica: Yes. Please, I need to see her.",
        "Marty: Okay. Hey.",
        "Nora: Hi, Jess.",
        "Jessica: It's good to see you. My little girl.",
        "Clint: Up we go.",
        "Jessica: Hi, come to mommy. Boy, did you get bigger? You sure did. Well, I missed you. Oh, is this for me?",
        "Bree: It's you, me, and Mary ice-skating.",
        "Jessica: Wow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: This can't be permanent. You know, we won't let it be.",
        "Brody: How's your foot?",
        "Natalie: Eh, good. It's nothing.",
        "Brody: Nothing to put you on crutches. I'm just glad it's not worse. When I heard about the car exploding--",
        "Natalie: Well, John got us out. Hey, I survived. I mean, my sister and I-- we're both very tough. We survive, we heal. You've seen that with her.",
        "Brody: I have. She's alive. She remembers her parents. That's a lot.",
        "Natalie: And we'll get her back to you. You're a part of her now, and the heart doesn't forget. She will find you, Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bree: When are you coming home?",
        "Jessica: Soon, sweetie. Um, but when I do come home, could you do me a favor? Um, you know that dress that you have--the red and black one with the flowers on it? Would you wear that for me? Because you look so pretty in that dress. I'd like that a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: How long have you known the truth?",
        "Schuyler: I...found out right before Thanksgiving.",
        "Gigi: November? So you've known that you were that baby's father for 3 months? Before I moved out on Rex? Before you and I were together? All that time, you knew the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Gigi and Schuyler will keep it together. They'll do it for the baby.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, and that always works out so well.",
        "Oliver: Kyle, she loves that baby already.",
        "Kyle: Gigi is that baby's aunt.",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "Kyle: Which means she will always be in Sierra's life, but you cannot count on Schuyler.",
        "Oliver: What? He's her dad. He's her legal guardian.",
        "Kyle: Gigi and Schuyler are not always going to be together. Okay? The--so this perfect couple fantasy you have isn't really holding up.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, well, it's still better.",
        "Kyle: For who? For the baby, or for you? Just because you're gay doesn't mean you have to give up your child.",
        "Oliver: She's not mine. Okay, look, now, please, Kyle, if you love me, you'll --you'll let this go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Balsom, you don't have to think too far ahead, okay? Not today.",
        "Rex: Good, because I'm fried. I'm a dad. My baby's in trouble. Her mom's dead. Only now, none of it's true.",
        "Bo: I know. You were looking forward to that baby.",
        "Rex: Well, I thought I'd get to be with my kid from the beginning this time.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you were there. She may not be yours, but she's lucky that you were there.",
        "Rex: Too bad her real father was using the pregnancy to seduce Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: How? How could you know that baby was yours and not say anything?",
        "Schuyler: I did not plan it.",
        "Gigi: You accidentally didn't speak up?",
        "Schuyler: No, no, it wasn't--at first, it was supposed to be a trade, okay? I --the day I found out, I had gone over to get Stacy to keep quiet about you staying at my place. Do you remember that?",
        "Gigi: Oh, so this is what you were negotiating over?",
        "Schuyler: Yes, I was trying to buy you time with Rex like you wanted.",
        "Gigi: Oh, so you did this for me?",
        "Schuyler: Yes. No, no. No, in the end, I did it for me, because I was so scared that if you found out, I would lose you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Bree, your mommy's getting really tired.",
        "Viki: I think we have to let mommy get some rest, okay?",
        "Bree: But you promised me we can go sledding with Brody.",
        "Jessica: Soon, how's that?",
        "Nora: Hey, Bree, how about you and I go get some hot chocolate?",
        "Jessica: Bye-bye, sweetie.",
        "Clint: That's her latest trick.",
        "Viki: You--you started that at Thanksgiving.",
        "Jessica: What a sweet little girl.",
        "Clint: And you remembered.",
        "Marty: Did you?",
        "Clint: Well, she knew what dress that Bree got for Christmas.",
        "Viki: Did you remember?",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Viki: But how did you know about the dress, honey?",
        "Jessica: She did look really pretty in it.",
        "Viki: Darling, did you remember anything at all about her?",
        "Jessica: No. No, I wish I did.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: I'll tell you what. I'm going to go talk with one of... I'm going to come back. We're going to get the help you need, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Anything?",
        "Marty: No. I mean, she covered well, but she didn't remember Bree. That's not good.",
        "Brody: Damn it, I just can't sit here and not do anything.",
        "Natalie: Brody, there's nothing we can do.",
        "Brody: Yes, there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, maybe I won't run the story.",
        "John: Good.",
        "Todd: I mean, not because it's not true, but because my sister's been through enough already.",
        "John: I think you made a wise decision.",
        "Todd: Who the hell cares what you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Shh.",
        "Jessica: I'm really scared.",
        "Viki: I know.",

        "Kyle: I'm not going to give up on you.",
        "Oliver: You know that it's not giving up on me if you just let this go.",
        "Kyle: Oliver, you can't walk away from this baby without knowing for--for real whether or not she's yours. Okay? The man I love couldn't live with that.",
        "Oliver: Don't I get to decide what I can and can't live with?",
        "Kyle: Yeah. Yeah, sure, but--",
        "Oliver: No, you know what? Kyle, I'm--I'm going to shower, okay? I just--I got to wash this day off of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I know it was wrong. I know it was wrong. I tried to tell you so many times. I--I even tried to tell Rex. Do you remember after Jared died, I came over that day?",
        "Gigi: I remember.",
        "Schuyler: I--I wanted to tell you so bad, but the closer I got to you, the harder it was to speak up, Gigi. Do you know that the day you told me you loved me was the greatest day of my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Bo: You stepped up, Balsom, every chance you had. You know, no matter how sad or messy this thing gets, you're going to be okay. You're going to use this.",
        "Rex: I am tired as hell of learning experiences.",
        "Bo: Hmm. I'll bet on you anytime, though.",
        "Rex: Thank you. For everything--with Shane, keeping all the kids safe.",
        "Bo: Look, any time. I'm around now, Balsom. You call me.",
        "Rex: I will.",
        "Bo: Okay.",

        "Shane: I'm back.",
        "Rex: Excellent.",
        "Shane: So, when's Mom coming home?",
        "Rex: I don't know. She has to stay with the baby till she's out of surgery, but she told me to tell you that she's going to be here as soon as she can.",
        "Shane: Will you stay here with me?",
        "Rex: Are you kidding? Pizza and Z-box, hmm?",
        "Shane: I mean, will you stay forever? You don't have a baby, so Mom can't stay mad, right? Can't you two get back together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I mean--I mean, that's what matters, right? That we love each other? I mean, the truth is out now, yeah, but that doesn't have to change anything.",
