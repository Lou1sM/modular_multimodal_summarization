        "Todd: Ok. Well, let's talk about why I'm here.",
        "Evangeline: What, you want to talk about what happened in the elevator? Because talking about it -- that -- that has done nothing but get me into trouble.",
        "Todd: Oh, no kidding? What happened?",
        "Evangeline: I told Cristian that we kissed. And he broke my heart.",

        "Jessica: Do you love Evangeline?",
        "Cristian: Yes, I do. So what?",
        "Jessica: Ok, well, think about that. Because that's how I feel about Antonio. And my feelings for Jamie and Bree -- there aren't words to describe them. And I am not going to put my family at risk by telling Antonio about some meaningless kiss with Nash.",
        "Cristian: I doubt it was meaningless.",
        "Jessica: Were you there?",
        "Cristian: Things like this always come out, Jess. Always.",
        "Jessica: Hasn't Antonio suffered enough? Do you really want to see him hurt again? Cristian, it's not fair.",

        "Cristian: I'll keep quiet.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Cristian: But you're lying to yourself about what's going on with Nash -- you know that.",
        "Jessica: Nothing is going on.",
        "Cristian: Nothing? Really? Nothing at all? Don't forget, Jess, we go way back.",
        "Jessica: I was a different person back then.",
        "Cristian: Maybe. But you better think long and hard about what your marriage means to you. Because the way I see it, you're not half as sure as you say you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Cristian broke your heart, huh? And you're just trying to be honest with him. Well, it's vintage Vega, if you ask me. I mean, I assume you explained the situation to him. I realize he hates my guts, but he doesn't -- he doesn't trust you at all?",
        "Evangeline: Don't. Don't you dare try to make him the bad guy.",
        "Todd: Evangeline, he -- he -- don't defend him. He's treated you like dirt.",
        "Evangeline: I deserve it. And how many times -- how many times have I defended you?",
        "Todd: Well, loyalty -- that's your blessing and your curse.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I know I said I'm in love with him. And you're in love with Blair.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but that situation with Blair and me is different. I did something to Blair that she thinks is unforgivable. So we're through. But you've done nothing wrong. He's -- he's going to dump you at the first sign of -- well, I'm not saying that the -- that the -- what happened in the elevator was a sign of anything, but --",
        "Evangeline: Cristian has had a problem with you and me for a long time, and you just egg him on.",
        "Todd: I don't think he deserves you.",
        "Evangeline: You do. You egg him on.",
        "Todd: He doesn't deserve you.",
        "Evangeline: You enjoy making him jealous.",

        "Cristian: Another.",
        "Marcie: Come on!",
        "Michael: No, you come on. Let me have your cell phone, ok? I -- I want to call Starr. I want to check on Tommy.",
        "Marcie: No. No! Ok, chill. Otherwise, I will divorce you.",
        "Michael: I can't believe you're not worried.",
        "Marcie: Tommy is fine! We're only going to be here a couple of hours. Nothing's going to happen to him.",
        "Michael: Yeah, do you know how many parents say that right before they cart their kids off to the E.R.?",
        "Marcie: Do you know how many parents actually never get to the E.R. because their kids are fine?",
        "Michael: You think I'm overreacting?",

        "John: I'm not talking about this case with you, Natalie. You've done enough damage.",
        "Natalie: Well, we have to help Michael. If we both think that he killed Spencer, the tabloids --",
        "John: Michael is not a suspect.",
        "Natalie: Well, I don't want to believe that, John, but how do we prove that he's not?",
        "John: \"We\" don't do anything. I rule him out.",
        "Natalie: By figuring out how the fibers from your scarf got on Spencer's body?",
        "John: So at some point, Truman's killer brushed up against me. It could have been anyone.",
        "Natalie: Including Michael.",
        "Natalie: John, I don't want to believe that he's guilty, either. But we can't just eliminate him because he's your brother.",
        "John: Michael is not a killer.",
        "Natalie: He hated Spencer just as much as the rest of us.",
        "John: He could have let Truman die during surgery. He didn't.",
        "Natalie: I ran into Michael earlier. He begd me to convince you to back off the case. Why would he do that if he wasn't guilty?",
