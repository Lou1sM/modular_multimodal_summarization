        "Clint: Viki.",
        "Nora: Hi, Viki. Good to see you.",
        "Viki: What's with the suitcases?",
        "Charlie: Going on a trip?",
        "Clint: Uh, not exactly.",
        "Nigel: We find ourselves in rather extraordinary circumstances.",
        "Charlie: What kind of circumstances?",
        "Nora: Dorian kicked us out of our house.",
        "Clint: Is there any room at the inn?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So we're agreed. We're going to tear up the south lawn and put in a labyrinth.",
        "David: A labyrinth? I thought we were going to build a big maze made out of hedges. Hey, on second thought, we should extend the garage. Did I tell you that I have a meeting at Llanview Motors tomorrow? I've ordered two convertibles, three SUV's, and a six-pack of motorcycles.",
        "Dorian: Well, then. We'll just demo the stables.",
        "David: Now that is a good idea. Allow me.",
        "Dorian: Thank you.",
        "David: I have unfortunate memories of the stables.",
        "Dorian: So do I. So we'll sell all of Asa's horses to a stud farm.",
        "David: What about the old gray mare?",
        "Dorian: Renee can fend for herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What are we going to do, Chloe? Huh? It's your bedtime and you are just not tired. No, you're not. You want to try reading? Huh? You want to hear a story? \"To our beautiful niece, Bree.\" \"It's the first of many stories we'll share together.\" \"Love, Aunt Natalie and Uncle Jared.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Why don't we just get out of here? Can't we forget about Jessica for one night?",
        "Natalie: We're next.",
        "Jared: Yeah? It seems like this might take a while.",
        "Attendant: Well, I mean, if you hit the turnpike, you've gone too far.",
        "Jared: We could go home, we could make a little dinner --",
        "Natalie: Who's this \"we?\"",
        "Jared: Hey. Bree and I happen to make a mean can of noodle doodles.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well Jess is going to be making the noodle doodles now. If she even remembers to feed them their dinner.",
        "Jared: You know Jess takes good care of the kids.",
        "Natalie: You mean now that she's not Tess. Tess is out of the picture.",
        "Jared: You don't believe that.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry. I can't. Not until I know everything that happened the night Chloe was born.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: You want to tell your lawyer that Vanessa killed your mom?",
        "Lola: I already did. What? You told me I should talk to someone.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but it's just -- maybe T\u00e9a wasn't the best person to tell.",
        "Lola: Why not?",
        "Markko: Ms. Delgado. -- She's got a habit of sympathizing with criminals.",
        "Langston: Like Starr's dad. Do you think you can really trust her?",
        "Lola: She trusted me enough to tell me the truth.",
        "Langston: What truth?",
        "Lola: She's been working for my father all along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Antonio, it's T\u00e9a. Would you please call me as soon as you get this? I'm trying to reach Cristian and he's not picking up his phone. It's very important, Antonio. If you speak to Cristian, please ask him to call my cell phone right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: So, you're not even going to say hello to me? That's amazing. And to think I used to be married to you.",
        "Vanessa: Ray --",
        "Ray: Oh, so you didn't forget my name while you let me rot in that hellhole.",
        "Vanessa: How did you get here?",
        "Ray: Why? Is it a problem? I'm screwing up your plans? You need more time, perhaps, to turn my daughter into your puppet?",
        "Vanessa: What do you want?",
        "Ray: You know, you're not being very friendly to a man who broke out of prison and came all this way just to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: T\u00e9a's been working on Uncle Ray's case this whole time?",
        "Lola: She just told me.",
        "Markko: But I thought she was your stepmom's lawyer.",
        "Lola: She is.",
        "Langston: So, what, she's defending your stepmother while trying to get your father out of prison?",
        "Markko: He's the guy Vanessa shot.",
        "Lola: She's trying to prove my father's innocent.",
        "Markko: Isn't that like --",
        "Langston: Um, unethical?",
        "Markko: Well, we are talking about T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi. Hi, guys. Lola, have you seen Cristian around?",
        "Lola: He was home when I left.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, and when was that?",
        "Lola: Like half an hour ago.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. Because I've been trying to reach him on his cell, and he's not picking up. Neither is Vanessa.",
        "Lola: Is something wrong?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know.",
        "Langston: Did something happen?",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe we should talk about this --",
        "Lola: It's okay, I told them everything.",
        "T\u00e9a: Lola, the more people who know the truth, the more likely it is that Vanessa will find out.",
        "Lola: I already told her, too.",
        "T\u00e9a: You told her what?",
        "Lola: That I think she killed my mother.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Lola: We got in a fight. I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't take it anymore. I'm sorry.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, it's -- it's all right. It's all right.",
        "Lola: Is it going to make it harder for my father to get out of prison?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not so much. He's already out.",
        "Lola: What?",
        "Langston: They let him out?",
        "Markko: Uh, isn't he dangerous?",
        "T\u00e9a: They didn't let him out. He escaped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Ah, what's the matter? No gun to pick up this time?",
        "Vanessa: Where's Cristian?",
        "Ray: What do you care?",
        "Vanessa: I love him.",
        "Ray: Really? You love him? You know, you used to tell me you loved me.",
        "Vanessa: Just tell me where he is.",
        "Ray: You used to say it to me all the time.",
        "Vanessa: Just tell me he's all right.",
        "Ray: Does he believe you like I did, Vanessa? Was he as big a fool as I was?",
        "Vanessa: Tell me what you did to Cristian.",
        "Ray: Maybe I gutted him. Maybe I gutted him like they say I did my wife. Like I could so easily do to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jess doesn't remember half the things that Tess did, okay? And Tess came here to the hospital the night Chloe was born and then left. Went to the cottage. And Tess doesn't do anything without a reason. I just want to know what that reason was. Hello? Do you want my GPS?",
        "Jared: What if it doesn't stop here, okay? What if you keep pushing until somebody gets hurt?",
        "Bo: Never going to happen.",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "Bo: This little lady would never hurt a fly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Poor Renee. She looked so exhausted when she came in.",
        "Nora: Oh, it's been a rough day on everyone, but especially her.",
        "Jessica: What's going on?",
        "Clint: Your mother's good friend decided to evict us.",
        "Viki: Oh, hello. Don't look at me. He's your brother.",
        "Jessica: Uncle Bo evicted you?",
        "Nora: No, no, no. David Vickers.",
        "Jessica: Excuse me?",
        "Nora: And your mother --",
        "Clint: Honey, it's a long, long story.",
        "Nora: Your mother's just been so gracious, and she's allowing us to bunk with her.",
        "Viki: Come on, it's no trouble.",
        "Nora: We would have stayed at the Palace.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Desk clerk wouldn't give us a room. Then the night manager backed him up. Can you believe that?",
        "Charlie: Wait a second; they wouldn't let Renee stay at her own place?",
        "Nora: Well it's questionable as to whether it's hers or not now.",
        "Clint: Due to some loophole in the will, David -- David of all people now owns the Palace, and we're persona non grata.",
        "Jessica: David who? David Vickers?",
        "Viki: I can't believe that David actually threw you out on the street. I truly thought the man had changed when he converted.",
        "Jessica: Converted to what?",
        "Charlie: You know, why wouldn't David and Dorian stay at her place? I mean, she's already got a mansion.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but she gave that to Moe and Noelle.",
        "Nora: Besides, ours has a moat and horses.",
        "Clint: It's not about the house. She could care less who has what house. What it is, it's revenge. She wants to make me pay.",
        "Viki: Well, that's her favorite activity, isn't it? Making other people miserable.",
        "Clint: Yeah. If she thinks I'm done, got another thing coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: The Buchanans are probably crying into their domestic beer right about now.",
        "Dorian: That's all those barbarians deserve.",
        "David: Easy. Those barbarians are my brothers.",
        "Dorian: You never cared when I said anything about Spencer.",
        "David: You're right, go ahead. They've never acted like my brothers. You're all the family I need.",
        "Dorian: And you've got a wonderful extended family now. You're going to love living with all my girls again.",
        "David: Yeah, where are the Cramer women?",
        "Dorian: I sent Addie to round them all up.",
        "David: What's wrong? You sound worried.",
        "Dorian: Vell, Sven said they were on their vay, but you know what atrocious English he speaks.",
        "David: Oh, they'll be here. You just increased their net value by several zeros.",
        "Dorian: I'm not sure they'll appreciate that.",
        "David: You're kidding, right?",
        "Dorian: No. The last time that I offered them a golden opportunity, I ended up running a company all on my own.",
        "David: Well that won't happen again.",
        "Dorian: Of course not. You just have to help me, David. Convince them that this is a new and golden era.",
        "David: Baby.",
        "[Door bell chimes]",
        "David: I'll do whatever it takes.",
        "Dorian: Are you ready?",
        "David: Always.",
        "[Door bell chimes]",
        "Dorian: Doggone it. Am I going to have to fire some of the help already?",
        "David: Don't you worry your pretty little head. I'll get it.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Wait. How do I look?",
        "David: Sweetheart, you look like a billion bucks. Trust me. This is going to be a piece of cake. Bienvenue a La maison Fleurie.",
        "Dorian: Addie!",
        "David: What did you do that for?",
        "Dorian: Oh, darling.",
        "Addie: Maison Fleurie.",
        "David: It's French.",
        "Addie: I know that. Learning fran\u00e7ais was on my list. How come you renamed the Alamo with something so delicate as a flower?",
        "David: A flower? You said it meant stud.",
        "Addie: Still at it, aren't you, Dorie?",
        "Dorian: Well, darling, when you think of it in terms of fertility --",
        "David: Hmm.",
        "Addie: One lie to explain another. That sounds like a really good recipe for a highly successful marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Obviously, you're all welcome to stay just as long as you like.",
        "Clint: Well, no. We won't be staying all that long. I mean, if we can't get the house back, there's always London.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. You're going to leave the country?",
        "Clint: Well, it won't come to that, no. Bo and I have options.",
        "Dorian: What are you doing, coming over here, acting like this? What kind of an example are you setting for the girls?",
        "Addie: What girls?",
        "Dorian: Aren't they on their way over?",
        "Addie: No. Langston's out with Markko. Starr has a project. And Blair hung up when she heard you'd called a meeting.",
        "Dorian: Oh, so of course you had to come over here, right? And just happened to throw a pie in my husband's face? Mmm.",
        "David: I just exfoliated.",
        "Addie: I didn't come here to unclog your pores. I came here to clear your stopped-up soul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Is everything all right?",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah. We're just having a little disagreement. That's all.",
        "Natalie: About the wedding. Because Jared wants a tent on the lawn, and I would like a canoe with beer in it. Down by the river, you know?",
        "Bo: So I -- good. I don't have to worry that you two are visiting a hospital.",
        "Natalie: Oh --",
        "Jared: Blood tests.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. For the marriage license.",
        "Jared: Officially disease-free.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm glad to hear that. When do you two plan on doing this thing, whatever it is that you turn out -- to do?",
        "Jared: Actually, we haven't set an official date yet.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Well, just FYI. If you do plan on going with your tent thing, don't plan on pitching it on Pa's lawn, because David Vickers is now the official Lord of the house.",
        "Jared: What? You couldn't cut a deal?",
        "Bo: No way.",
        "Natalie: I mean, I can't say I'm surprised. I really never counted on David's religious conversion really taking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: My soul is just fine, thank you.",
        "Addie: You're worse off than I thought. What about the damage you're doing to your future selves?",
        "Dorian: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Addie: I thought you were Buddhist, Dorie. You drank all that yak butter T\u00e9a for nothing. What about learning to live a life without want?",
        "Dorian: With all due respect to David's former faith, I think that his higher power did not want to see him suffer.",
        "Addie: Suffering is the only true path to enlightenment.",
        "Dorian: Well David's path led him to find his real self, and straight into this house. Maybe his higher power wanted him to be rich.",
        "David: Yeah.",
        "Addie: By turning the Buchanans out of their home?",
        "Dorian: That is melodramatic. Nobody has been turned out of anything.",
        "David: Eh, they kind of were.",
        "Addie: I thought so. Tell me, David. Is that what Buddha would do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So can you contest the will?",
        "Bo: Well, we can try. But could take up to a year. And so far, Vickers has the law and the money all on his side.",
        "Jared: There's nothing else you can do?",
        "Bo: We're going to do another DNA test.",
        "Natalie: Well Jared took a sample of David's hair to prove his case, and it worked.",
        "Bo: Yes, but we can't start legal proceedings until we verify that the DNA is a match. That's why I'm down here. I want to see if I can light a fire under these lab techs.",
        "Attendant: Next.",
        "Natalie: Finally.",
        "Bo: All right, I'll see you guys later, all right?",
        "Jared: Good luck.",
        "Bo: Hey, hey, congratulations on the engagement.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Bo: And FYI. You two do know that Pennsylvania no longer requires a blood test to get married?",
        "Natalie: Oh! All right.",
        "Bo: See you later.",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "Attendant: Hey.",
        "Natalie: We --",
        "Attendant: Ticket, please.",
        "Natalie: We really need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Cole, honey, it's Nora. Could you -- I need to talk to you, it's really important. Before you go back to the house, could you give me a call, please? Thank you.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Nora: Hi, Jess. How are you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm okay. Could I talk to you a minute?",
        "Nora: Sure.",
        "Jessica: Do you know anything about Wes Granger's murder?",
        "Nora: Did you know Wes?",
        "Jessica: No. He was a friend of Brody's though. And Brody and I were in St. Ann's at the same time. I only met Wes like once.",
        "Nora: I just don't think it's something you need to focus on right now --",
        "Jessica: Do they have any suspects?",
        "Nora: Well, actually, they've already made an arrest.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. Who?",
        "Nora: Marty Saybrooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: My father escaped? When?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not sure. I think a couple days ago.",
        "Markko: What does that mean?",
        "Langston: You don't know?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, the Colombian authorities weren't very forthcoming.",
        "Lola: I don't understand.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen --",
        "Lola: Weren't you helping him?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm afraid he thinks that I let him down. I got busy with another case, kind of dropped the ball with his case.",
        "Markko: Because you were getting Todd Manning off.",
        "Langston: Markko.",
        "Markko: What? You think the same thing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, if I have messed things up, I will pay for that later. I just want to make sure that no one's paying for my mess-up's right now, which is why I need to find Cristian. I can't keep him in the dark any longer about any of this, okay?",
        "Langston: You don't think that my uncle would risk coming here, do you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why wouldn't he? Everything he wants is in Llanview. I'm sorry, I have to go.",
        "Lola: I'm going with you.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. Lola, you stay here with Markko and Langston until I have everything settled with Cristian.",
        "Lola: He's my father, T\u00e9a. I don't care what you say, I'm going.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, let's go. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you, Markko.",
        "Langston: Be careful, all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Something wrong? Huh? Cat got your tongue? You couldn't stop talking when I was on trial for Selena's murder. You would've said anything to prove I was a killer. Some maniac who only knew how to hurt people.",
        "Vanessa: And now you're proving me right.",
        "Ray: I'm doing no such thing. Get up.",
        "Vanessa: You're here with a knife. How's it going to look to the authorities? All you're doing is making trouble for yourself.",
        "Ray: I told you to get up. I don't care anymore what anybody says about me. I only care that justice will now be done.",
        "Vanessa: What does that mean?",
        "Ray: That means you're going to pay for what you did to me. That means my daughter is going to wake up from a nightmare, and bring -- hey. Okay, now you need to step aside, my friend. I'm taking Vanessa with me.",
        "Cristian: Take a shot.",
        "Ray: It shouldn't have had to happen like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Attendant: This pass was stamped and paid months ago.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know. It's evidence.",
        "Attendant: What kind of evidence?",
        "Natalie: Well, this guy is suing me. Says that I rear-ended his car. But this here is proof that I was here the whole time. The problem is, the time is really light and you can't read it.",
        "Attendant: Oh, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, so I can't present this in court.",
        "Attendant: Sure, the judge would throw you out on your ass.",
        "Natalie: Right, right. So I was hoping maybe there was something you could do that could tell us when it's from?",
        "Attendant: Like one of those CSI guys.",
        "Jared: Look, man, if it's too much trouble, just --",
        "Attendant: I could just scan the ticket and print the info out on a receipt. Would that help?",
        "Natalie: Yes. Yes, thank you very much.",
        "Attendant: Here you go.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Attendant: Good luck with the lawsuit. I hate those creeps that sue everybody. Let me know if you need any more help.",
        "Natalie: Got it. Thank you.",
        "Jared: Thanks, man. What have we got?",
        "Natalie: Something that makes no sense.",

        "Jessica: I don't believe Marty killed Wes.",

        "Nora: No.",
        "Jessica: Is there anything I can do to help her?",
        "Nora: I wish there was. I'd like to help her, too. But she's been a little reckless since she's gotten away from Todd.",
        "Jessica: Is there anything that I can do?",
        "Nora: No, sweetie, no. Thank you for offering though. Oh, if you find out who killed Wes Granger, you can let me know.",

        "Charlie: You know, you could always ask Moe and Noelle to let you bunk in with them.",
        "Nora: And we would do that, why?",

        "Jared: Maybe she was afraid she was going to get caught. As far as she knew, we were dead.",
        "Natalie: Okay, but the vineyard? I mean, why would she go back there? Especially when she knows that that would be the one place that we would all look for her.",
