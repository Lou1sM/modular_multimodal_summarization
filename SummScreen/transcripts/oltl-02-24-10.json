    "Recap": [
        "Snoop Dogg returns to Llanview to perform at Capricorn. He first drops by Bo Buchanan's place for a visit. Bo, Nora, and Matthew live in Madame Delphina's old apartment now. Snoop meets Matthew and Nora and reveals that he knows the scoop on everyone from his east coast security\u0097Shaun Evans. He gives the three of them complimentary tickets to the concert. Matthew calls Dani and asks her to be his date. Nora is concerned about Matthew dating Todd's daughter after Todd beat up Cole when he discovered the extent of his relationship with Starr. Blair is moving back to La Boulaie with the boys but cannot find Jack because Jack went to Tea's hotel room to meet his sister. He is surprised that his new sister is older than he is. Tea calls Todd and tells him that Jack is there so Todd and Blair go to get him.",
        "Langston fantasizes about Ford. Markko senses that something is going on with Langston but she says she is just stressed about her musical. Starr and Cole are disappointed when their babysitter cancels, but Langston offers to forego the concert and stay home with Hope. Markko, Starr and Cole go to the concert together. When they arrive, Ford is working the door. Starr tells him that Langston isn't coming to the concert so he fakes being ill and goes to see Langston.   At Capricorn, Rachel and Greg argue about his intention to bring Schuyler Joplin before the ethics committee for staling Oxytocin to induce early labor. To Greg's surprise, he finds that Shaun and Greg's ex, Vivian are together now. Mr. and Mrs. Evans gush over Vivian and snub Rachel. Tea takes Dani to Capricorn for her date with Matthew. Todd also goes, but to keep an eye on Matthew and Dani."

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: What are you hiding?",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't you have homework to do?",
        "Dani: Yeah. So what is that, some kind of a drug?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Yeah, I figured I owed you a great night out after giving you a hard time about your roommate.",
        "Rachel: I figure you're right.",
        "Greg: Ha ha. Look, I know you're close with Schuyler. And thinking about him stealing that oxytocin--",
        "Rachel: You know what? Can we just put that whole mess on hold?",
        "Greg: Yeah.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Greg: Excuse me. Oh, it's the hospital.",
        "Rachel: You're not on call, are you?",
        "Greg: No.",
        "Rachel: Then why are they calling you?",
        "Greg: I asked them to keep me posted about the premature baby that Schuyler brought in. This is Dr. Evans. Right. Hold on. I'm on the ethics committee. They accused Schuyler of signing out a drug used to induce early labor. We have to investigate.",
        "Rachel: Do what you have to do.",
        "Greg: If he did anything to contribute to that baby's illness, he'll be in deep trouble. This is Dr. Evans.",

        "T\u00e9a: It's an exhibit for a case. Can't talk about it.",
        "Dani: Oh, right. I forgot. You're good at keeping secrets. Hey, remember the one that you kept about who my biological father is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Just stay on my daughter Dani. I want to know every move she makes. I'm just watching out for her. Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Oh, you're moving out?",

        "Matthew: Hey, guys.",
        "Nora: Ah! Oh, we missed you so much when we were in Texas.",
        "Matthew: I missed you, too.",
        "Bo: Here you are.",
        "Matthew: Hey, Dad.",
        "Bo: Good to see you, son.",
        "Matthew: You, too.",
        "Nora: I hope it wasn't too crowded at your sister's.",
        "Matthew: No. It was fun.",
        "Bo: Well, now that Mitch Laurence is in custody, I think things will maybe get back to normal around here.",
        "Matthew: I hope so, but it was great what you guys did for Shane and Bree.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, I'm still recovering from that. So how's it going, huh? What'd we miss?",
        "Matthew: Nothing much.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Snoop Dogg: Mmmm. This town has always had some fine sceneries. Blondes, brunettes, light, dark, and mocha. Well, look out, ladies of Llanview, the boss is back.",
        "[Music playing]",
        "Snoop Dogg: All that you get is one life to live all that I have is one life to live all that you get is one life to live all that I have is one life to live I try to do right I try to do right because I only got only got, only got, only got all that I have is one life to live",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What the hell are you talking about? I didn't do anything with Jack.",
        "Blair: Well, I just checked his room, and he's not there.",
        "Todd: Well, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.",
        "Blair: No, I looked everywhere, so where is he?",
        "Todd: I don't know. God.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, you don't know? Isn't he supposed to tell you when he goes?",
        "Todd: Well, it's Jack. He's not exactly a model kid. At least he doesn't hate me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Who the hell am I? You came to see me.",
        "Jack: Now, why would I want to see you?",
        "Dani: Nice welcome from my little brother.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Dani: Starr's shown me about 200 pictures of you. Fortunately, pictures can't talk.",
        "Jack: You're my sister?",
        "Dani: Who were you expecting, Taylor Swift?",
        "Jack: But you're, like, old.",
        "Dani: What does that, like, mean?",
        "Jack: I overheard my mom and dad talking, that my dad and T\u00e9a had a kid, so I figured you'd be my little sister. I thought you'd be, like, 8 or 9.",
        "Dani: Well, I'm, like, not.",
        "Jack: That makes no sense.",

        "Blair: Didn't I just say that?",
        "Todd: Well, it doesn't hurt to check, does it?",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. What if Mitch took him?",
        "Todd: Oh, Mitch is in federal custody.",
        "Blair: It's never stopped him before, Todd.",
        "Todd: There's got to be another explanation.",
        "Blair: Well, you care to share it with me?",
        "Todd: I didn't say I knew what it was. Why are you even worried, anyway?",
        "Blair: Because our son is missing, that's why?",
        "Todd: Well, Starr was always missing! She's fine!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Markko, I--Markko, I got to get to work, okay? Sorry.",
        "Markko: What, on the musical?",
        "Langston: Yeah, sorry.",
        "Markko: No problem. Lang, is everything okay?",
        "Langston: What do you mean?",
        "Markko: I feel like you're pulling away or something. Or is it all just in my head?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I wouldn't exactly call her my girlfriend. So asking her to see Snoop tonight...not gonna happen.",
        "Cristian: You know, you said the same thing when I thought you and this mystery girl of yours should double with me and Layla. What's that about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: What's wrong?",
        "Greg: The baby needs major surgery on her heart.",
        "Rachel: Oh, my God, is she gonna be okay?",
        "Greg: They don't know yet. But if Schuyler gave that infant's mother oxytocin to induce early labor...",
        "Rachel's voice: So what am I supposed to do with it?",
        "T\u00e9a: Let me take care of it.",
        "Rachel: You?",
        "T\u00e9a: It's safer than trying to hide it around here someplace where Greg will find it.",
        "Greg: Rachel. Why do I get the feeling that you know more than you're telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Actually, I think--uh, I think it's lip gloss.",
        "Nora: Lip gloss?",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it must have rubbed off from when I hugged Danielle. You know, she's going through a very hard time right now with her mom and dad, so she needed a hug. I'm gonna go do my homework.",
        "Bo: It's good to see him taking his education so seriously.",
        "Nora: Oh, you don't buy that. I though he and Dani were just friends.",
        "Bo: Well, they are, but maybe now just a little more than just friends. Okay, not long ago he told me that he and Dani had kissed. So what? I guess now his feelings have evolved.",
        "Nora: E-evolved? Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Bo: Because I was sworn to secrecy. And besides that, T\u00e9a took Dani away. He didn't think he'd ever see her again, and neither did I.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah, and guess what. Here she is.",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Nora: Do you really think this is such a good idea for our son to get close with Todd Manning's daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Uh, the sitter just texted.",
        "Starr: Oh, good. Is she on her way?",
        "Cole: Uh-uh. She's not coming.",
        "Starr: What? Why not?",
        "Cole: She scored a ticket to Snoop Dogg.",
        "Starr: Well, what are we gonna do? My mom has to be at Capricorn, and I don't want to ask my dad. What about your mom?",
        "Cole: She's on call at the hospital. What about your grandma?",
        "Starr: She's ice fishing in the Adirondacks.",
        "Cole: Damn, that list of hers is long.",
        "Starr: We're never gonna be able to find a baby-sitter at this time, and this was supposed to be our first date since we moved in together.",
        "Cole: Hey, I know. I'm sorry, all right. This really, really sucks. But on the bright side, Hope's asleep, Langston and Markko are probably on their way to Capricorn, so we have the place to ourselves. I know it's not as exciting as Snoop, but...",
        "Starr: It'll do.",
        "Cole: It will do.",
        "Starr: Ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I'm sorry if I've seemed distant. It's just... it's this damn musical. I--have this massive case of writer's block, and it's killing me.",
        "Markko: Okay, uh, yeah. I kind of figured that when you left in the middle of the night to go write at the library. And when Starr's mom came over because Mitch Laurence was after you and you weren't here...you don't want to know what I was thinking.",
        "Langston: I'm so sorry about that. I just need to get this musical out of my system.",
        "Markko: Maybe you should take a break.",
        "Langston: I've tried. Trust me. I try so hard not to think about it, but it just keeps popping into my head every two minutes, and I just want to feel normal again. I just--I want to feel close to you again.",
        "Markko: Well, you will. Babe, you will. Come on. Look, we're gonna have a great time seeing Snoop Dogg tonight. I really think it'll take your mind off this obsession for a while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So why are you keeping this girl a secret?",
        "Ford: She's not a secret, man. She's just not into the whole dating thing.",
        "Cristian: Why not? Is she with another guy or something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You are jumping to conclusions. Fine, you have to investigate Schuyler about the missing oxytocin, but you don't have evidence.",
        "Greg: Yes, we do.",
        "Rachel: What, one nurse's word? And even if he did take the drug, you don't know that he actually used it.",
        "Greg: The baby was premature.",
        "Rachel: But you don't know why yet. You have no evidence that this baby's problems were caused by someone inducing early labor.",
        "Greg: No. Nothing concrete, but--",
        "Rachel: Okay, so can we please drop it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Hey, I think they're almost done setting up. You think Snoop will give me his autograph? Am I interrupting something?",
        "Greg: Not a thing. You look smoking.",
        "Destiny: Shaun and I have been hitting the gym. It's our New Year's resolution since we both got dumped.",
        "Greg: I didn't know that you and Matthew had gotten together.",
        "Destiny: We didn't. Thanks for reminding me.",
        "Greg: I'm sorry it didn't work out, Des.",
        "Destiny: I made my move. I told him how I felt. But he dropped the \"let's be friends\" line just like you did to Shaun.",
        "Greg: Come on, Des.",
        "Destiny: It's cool. Rachel's into you. Matthew's into Dani Rayburn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So do you really think I'm like my dad?",
        "Dani: It's not a compliment. Starr was way off. She thinks you're the bomb, but you're a moron just like your father.",
        "Jack: Jeez, who would want you in the family? No wonder my dad kept you as a secret. Yo, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yo, Jack, what are you doing here?",
        "Jack: Wasting my time. I came here to meet my sister, but I could be doing some more fun things at my house like sticking my head down the garbage disposal.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. Wait. Your dad isn't here with you, is he?",
        "Dani: He better not be.",
        "Jack: I'm going commando.",
        "Dani: You're not wearing any underwear?",
        "Jack: No, stupid. It means I'm flying solo.",
        "Dani: No, stupid, it doesn't. It means--",
        "T\u00e9a: Jack, does your father even know you're here?",
        "Jack: No. He didn't tell me about the soulless princess of adolescent fury, so why should I tell him I'm here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Jack was here. I saw him--",
        "Blair: Well, good for you, Todd. Where is he now?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Blair: Is that Jack?",
        "Todd: It's T\u00e9a. Hi there. You sure you got the right number? I thought you left me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Jack's here. He wanted to meet Dani. Why didn't you tell him he had a sister?",
        "Todd: Well, why didn't you tell me I had a daughter?",
        "T\u00e9a: How many times am I gonna have to say sorry for that, huh? Jack's here. He's alive. I thought you'd want to know.",
        "Todd: All right, I'll come and get him! Apparently Jack went to meet his sister. How the hell did he find out about her anyway?",
        "Blair: You didn't bother to tell him that he had a sister?",
        "Todd: Don't. Ha ha. You sound like T\u00e9a.",
        "Blair: You know what? And you sound like a jackass. Don't ever compare me--",
        "Todd: What the hell difference does it make if Jack knows or not? Dani hates me. It's not like we're gonna be one big happy family anyway.",
        "Blair: I'll go with you.",
        "Todd: Oh, what's wrong? You worried that I'm gonna get back together with T\u00e9a? You change your mind? You want me, though.",
        "Blair: In your dreams.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Snoop Dogg: You know, Blair Cramer's gonna be looking real fine tonight. Um, she got some nice curves on her. But before I do, I got a place to be and a man to see. Llanview, what it do.",

        "Vivian: Scotch neat, huh? I thought you were the unpredictable type.",
        "Greg: How are you, Vivian?",
        "Vivian: Surprised to see you here. I heard you did the work of 10 doctors during the storm.",
        "Greg: Yeah. Probably still running on adrenaline.",
        "Vivian: Huh. So are you alone?",
        "Greg: Uh, Vivian, I--I think that you are amazing, but I thought that I made it clear that I'm serious about Rachel.",
        "Vivian: Oh, trust me, you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Destiny, when you say Matthew and Dani are hooking up, you don't mean--",
        "Destiny: I don't mean like how you and Greg are hooking up. I just meant she got him and I didn't.",
        "Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. That stinks.",
        "Destiny: You know what stinks? Dani's cool.",
        "Rachel: So you two have become friends?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. Makes it kind of hard to hate her. So what's going on between you and Greg? I felt some heat between you guys. Not the good kind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If you think you're moving in with my dad--",
        "Dani: I wouldn't live with your father if he was the last person on earth. Your dad's a kinked-out perv--",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, Daniella, basta ya. Okay?",
        "Jack: Don't worry, T\u00e9a. We're not in the market for a new family member, and if we were, it would definitely not be her.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's enough from you, too, all right?",
        "Jack: You've never yelled at me before.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you and your sister have never been in the same room before.",
        "Dani: Oh, and who's fault is that, Mom?",
        "Jack: You mean it's not my dad's?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. It is mine. I didn't tell your father about Daniella until recently.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Jack: That sucks.",
        "Dani: Tell me about it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, looks like I finally got you two to agree on something.",

        "Blair: Well--",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, Blair, looks like you've gotten your claws into Todd already. This is a record for you. And for you, too, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I guess this is--this isn't exactly an ideal situation.",
        "Nora: Our son is fraternizing with the spawn of Satan?",
        "Bo: But if you--",
        "Nora: I mean, she's a sweet girl. Don't get me wrong. She's really a lovely--",
        "Bo: I know, but if you saw how miserable he was when he thought that she was gone for good, you would be happy for him.",
        "Nora: Oh, I don't know about that.",
        "Bo: No, no, no!",
        "Nora: No, I really--I wish I could be happy. I wish I could, but I...",
        "Bo: So what do we do? Do we punish him for who her parents are?",
        "Nora: Oh, well, they are doozies, aren't they? I mean, T\u00e9a and I are just starting to be civil with each other.",
        "Bo: Yeah. It's not exactly like Manning and I are drinking buddies.",
        "Nora: Bo, how many times have you arrested him? Oh, my God, how many times have I prosecuted him?",
        "Bo: Well, why? Do you think it'll come to that?",
        "Nora: Are you kidding? Look what Todd Manning did to Cole when he found Cole and Starr in bed together. He beat the daylights out of that kid. He would do the same thing to Matthew in a heartbeat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh!",

        "Starr: Well, you don't have a bedroom with a baby in it.",
        "Langston: Yeah, well, we thought you guys would be already on your way to Capricorn. What are you still doing here?",
        "Starr: We're making the best out of a bad situation. Our sitter isn't coming, and now we can't find anyone else.",
        "Langston: I'll do it. I'll stay home.",

        "Cristian: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to step in anyone's business. It's just that Layla keeps hounding me for, you know, gossip about you. And all I can tell her is that some girl left a scarf in your office.",
