        "John: Thanks.",
        "Cristian: You waiting for someone?",
        "John: What tipped you off?",
        "Cristian: Maybe how your eyes keep going to the door.",
        "John: And they call me a detective.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How cool was Snoop's performance tonight?",
        "Cole: The guy invented cool.",
        "Starr: Stop. Remind me to get a present for Langston. If she hadn't offered to stay home with Hope tonight...",
        "Markko: We don't need to get her a present. She wanted to do it. I'm just sorry she's missing out on all the action.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey. I've been worried about you.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I'm fine.",
        "Viki: How you doing, hon? Came to see if there was any news on the baby.",
        "Gigi: I wish, but she's still in surgery.",
        "Viki: I'm so sorry about Stacy.",
        "Gigi: I was with her when the baby was born.",
        "Viki: I know. I heard.",
        "Gigi: She surprised me with how brave she was. And when she got that first look at her little girl...I--I saw a side of my sister I hadn't seen in a long time. I wish it could've lasted.",
        "Viki: Listen, you're gonna be there for her baby, at least that, you know, and I'm sure that's what Stacy wanted.",
        "Natalie: I can't imagine what you've been going through. I can't believe that Schuyler didn't tell you.",
        "Rex: Hey, how is Jess? We heard the surgery went well.",
        "Viki: Yeah, the surgery was a great success, and obviously, we're very thankful for that.",
        "Rex: That sounded like you're leaving something out.",
        "Natalie: Jessica's physically well.",
        "Viki: Unfortunately, her mind is somewhere else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I need you. I need you, my love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Laurence gave her shock treatments?",
        "Viki: Yeah. She knows where she is, though, and she knows Clint and she knows me. I mean, in most ways, she seems herself.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, herself in her senior year of high school.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Natalie: She can't remember past that, so anyone who's come into her life in the last 10 years, like me, she doesn't recognize.",
        "Rex: Oh, my God. Then she wouldn't recognize me, either.",
        "Viki: No, the thing is, you know, it could be temporary. She's been through such a trauma that, you know, it's gonna take time to get everything back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I love you. Wait. What happened? Where are you?",
        "Brody: I'm right here.",
        "Jessica: It's you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Thanks.",
        "Viki: You all right, sweetheart?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: All right. Let's go.",
        "Gigi: You know, you should really go with them. It could be hours before we know anything.",
        "Rex: I'm not gonna let you gut this out alone, Morasco.",
        "Gigi: I'll be okay.",
        "Rex: Where the hell is Schuyler? That's what I'd like to know.",
        "Gigi: He denied his daughter for months before she was born. Why stop now? Go ahead, say it. You were right about Schuyler all along.",
        "Gigi: You must think I'm the world's biggest idiot for trusting Schuyler.",
        "Rex: I'm not here to say I told you so. And you're not an idiot. You were lied to.",
        "Gigi: So were you. He never told you the baby wasn't yours.",
        "Rex: She may not be mine, but... she's Shane's cousin, which makes her family.",
        "Gigi: Shane. How am I ever going to make him understand any of this?",
        "Rex: He'll be okay. I've pretty much told him everything.",
        "Gigi: How did he take it?",
        "Rex: He was...surprised, obviously, but...I don't know. Shane always has a way of finding the bright side of things.",
        "Gigi: There's a bright side?",
        "Rex: He's taking it in stride.",
        "Gigi: And what about you?",
        "Rex: I'm fine.",
        "Gigi: Rex, you're not fine. How could you be, after everything you've lost?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I thought you could use a friend.",
        "Schuyler: Does that mean... you know what happened? Everything?",
        "Rachel: Well, I know that the baby was born prematurely. And I know that Stacy died.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, because of me.",
        "Langston: No, don't. It's wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: It's wrong for me to want you or for you to want me? It's called being normal, Langston. You're young. You should be figuring out what you want in this world.",
        "Langston: I know what I want.",
        "Ford: Oh, really? To be in a relationship where you're tied down and you're almost married? That should be years away.",
        "Langston: I made a commitment, okay? I love Markko.",
        "Ford: You keep saying that, but you keep kissing me. Okay? Like that time in my office.",
        "Langston: No, okay, you kissed me.",
        "Ford: Yeah, but you liked it. And then when I finally got you alone at your party, I could feel--",
        "Langston: No, okay, you know what? I think that you need to go.",
        "Ford: You think I need to go or you want me to go?",
        "Langston: What's the difference?",
        "Ford: One is just the noise in your head. The other comes from somewhere else. Talk to me from there and I'll listen. Do you really want me to go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Where are you going?",
        "Markko: It's hot in here. I was just gonna, you know, go outside and get some air.",
        "Cole: You were gonna call Langston.",
        "Markko: What--am I not supposed to miss her?",
        "Starr: You can miss her all you want but she is supposed to be working on her musical and you're supposed to let her.",
        "Markko: You're right. I just-- I hate it when she concentrates on anything that's not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So, you were trapped up on Llantano Mountain, too.",
        "John: If I never see snow again, Cris, it'll be too soon.",
        "Cristian: I read about Jessica, how she almost didn't make it.",
        "John: It was bad. Luckily, they got her to surgery in time.",
        "Cristian: Thank God. She and I used to...mean a lot to each other. You don't stop caring about someone just because your life changes, you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: Cole. Hi there, dear.",
        "Cole: Hi. Hey, guys, this is Hannah. She's in my sociology class. Hannah, this is Starr, my girlfriend, and my buddy Markko.",
        "Hannah: Oh, yeah. I've seen you around campus. I don't think we've run into each other yet.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah. I'm not usually on campus that often. I'm actually a senior at Llanview High.",
        "Hannah: Cool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hey.",
        "John: Hey. Nice dress.",
        "Marty: Thank you.",
        "John: You got my message. When I heard you were on that emergency, I wasn't sure--",
        "Marty: Yeah, it was Jessica.",
        "John: I thought she was okay.",
        "Marty: No, she is. I mean, her injuries are healing but there's some cognitive issues. Memory loss.",
        "John: How bad?",
        "Marty: She doesn't remember anything past her senior year of high school.",
        "John: Whoa.",
        "Marty: Yeah. I know. All that time is gone. She doesn't remember Brody or her own sister. And apparently Natalie's hard to forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Brody's in there with her.",
        "Viki: You know, I hope he doesn't try to force her to remember. The last thing we need is for Jessie to be upset.",
        "Natalie: I know, but Brody has this really good idea and I think we should let him try it, you know? Maybe just for a few minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Seemed like a pretty nice dream you were having. What was it about?",
        "Jessica: I don't remember, just like the last 10 years of my life.",
        "Brody: Well, maybe we can fix that.",
        "Jessica: What's that?",
        "Brody: Well, I gathered all the videos we've made together and I've put them all on one DVD.",
        "Jessica: A what?",
        "Brody: Oh. Right. Um...it's like a videotape, but you can play it on your computer. It's not enough to tell you how happy we were together. You need to be able to see it with your own eyes, and now you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Schuyler, when you say you killed Stacy--",
        "Schuyler: The only reason Mitch went after her was because he thought the baby was his grandchild.",
        "Rachel: That is not what I'm talking about.",
        "Schuyler: Rachel, Stacy was up on that mountain because she was trying to escape Mitch. Why was she trying to escape Mitch? Because I couldn't tell the truth. So, who's responsible? Who's responsible, Rachel, if not me?",
        "Rachel: What about the oxytocin?",
        "Schuyler: What?",
        "Rachel: The hospital is doing an investigation, Schuyler. Greg told me. Somebody forged a doctor's signature to get a drug that induces labor. It was you, wasn't it?",
        "Schuyler: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You thought you were gonna be a father again and you were finally letting yourself get psyched about it, weren't you?",
        "Rex: It doesn't matter now.",
        "Gigi: Of course it matters. It matters that Schuyler let that happen. It was cruel, Rex. You should've seen me. I really ripped into him.",
        "Rex: Good.",
        "Gigi: No, seriously, I--I gave him holy hell for playing with our lives the way he did. And just think--he might've gotten away with it forever if Stacy hadn't gone missing.",
        "Rex: Maybe.",
        "Gigi: No maybe about it. My sister would be raising Sierra with you and Schuyler...",
        "Rex: Where'd you learn how to deliver a baby? That's what I'd like to know.",
        "Gigi: On-the-job training. Wiped me out, too. When I put that little girl in my sister's arms, I felt like I had given birth to her myself.",
        "Rex: The fact that you could do that, after everything Stacy did to you...",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, it's pretty hard to ignore a pregnant woman screaming bloody murder. You'd do anything to shut her up. It's instinct.",
        "Rex: Instinct only takes you so far. For the rest, you need heart. And that's what you have, Morasco. One of the biggest hearts there is.",
        "Gigi: It's too bad I gave it to the wrong guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Crowd noise on DVD]",
        "Jessica on DVD: Can you put that camera away, please?",
        "Brody on DVD: Why'd you get me a camcorder if you don't want me to use it?",
        "Jessica on DVD: Well, figure it's a way to get yourself in the shot.",
        "Brody on DVD: This more what you had in mind?",
        "Jessica on DVD: I love you, Brody Lovett.",
        "[Stops DVD]",
        "Jessica: When was that?",
        "Brody: A few months ago.",
        "Jessica: I look different. I look so much older.",
        "Brody: You look beautiful, Jess. I dare you to find a single shot where you don't.",
        "Brody: See? Can't be done. Those pictures will tell you a story if you let them. They'll tell you how much we love each other.",
        "Jessica: How did we meet?",
        "Brody: I don't have any pictures from back then.",
        "Jessica: That's okay. You don't need pictures. Just tell me.",
        "Brody: We met in a hospital.",
        "Jessica: Here?",
        "Brody: No, somewhere else. You were a patient. So was I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Mom, have you talked to Charlie since--",
        "Viki: Since he shot Jessica? Yes, I have. Oh, honey. I look at this man that I thought I knew so well and I see what he did to my daughter and my brain just completely shuts down.",
        "Natalie: Mom, you know he wasn't aiming at Jessica.",
        "Viki: Oh, no, I know that. I know that. Here's my problem. He went there with the intention of killing somebody. He went there specifically to murder Mitch.",
        "Natalie: So did I. I tried to kill Mitch and I damn near succeeded.",
        "Viki: You--you weren't in your right mind, sweetheart, you know. You were-- there was all the pain and--and grief over Jared--",
        "Natalie: And it's the same for Charlie.",
        "Viki: I can't think about Charlie now. I just have to concentrate on you and Jessica. You both have to get well.",
        "Natalie: Oh. I'm getting there.",
        "Viki: Thank God for that. You know, when we heard that-- that nobody knew where you or John were...",
        "Natalie: We made it through.",
        "Viki: I'm just grateful you didn't freeze to death. You poor baby. You must've been terrified.",
        "Natalie: John wouldn't let me lose hope. He got both of us through it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm glad you came. I feel like we left a lot of things up in the air the last time.",
        "Marty: I know. And I feel like I owe you an apology.",
        "John: For what?",
        "Marty: Ever since I found you with Natalie, I've been distant.",
        "John: That's understandable.",
        "Marty: Is it? I mean, she explained how that kiss came about. She was disoriented. She thought you were Jared. And if that's true, I should be able to accept it and move on. Unless there's something else I should know.",
        "John: Natalie thought I was Jared and I let her believe it, the first time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: You don't mind if I borrow your boyfriend, do you? I just have to talk to him for a sec. So, about the project...",
        "Markko: Okay, take a deep breath.",
        "Starr: What are you talking about? I'm fine.",
        "Markko: Good. Because it's totally not worth getting jealous over.",
        "Starr: I know that, but you have to admit, she's hot.",
        "Markko: So, I'll tell you the same thing you told me when I was obsessing about Langston and Ford. You've got what everybody wants. Someone to love you. Trust it.",
        "Starr: I said that? I'm pretty wise.",
        "Markko: You said Langston chose me because she loves me. And you know what? I'm gonna go home right now and I'm gonna tell her that I love her, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You can't say it, can you? Because you don't want me to go. You want me to stay.",
        "Langston: I want you to stay.",
        "Langston: Wait. We don't have protection.",
        "Langston: Well, aren't you prepared?",
        "Ford: You have no idea how long I've been thinking about this. Where's the bedroom? That's okay. Here is fine. Here is perfect.",
        "[Key in lock]",
        "Markko: Langston? Lang, you there? Open up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I was praying it wasn't true. I couldn't stand to think that you would do something as dangerous as induce labor.",
        "Schuyler: Rachel, I didn't.",
        "Rachel: But you did take the oxytocin.",
        "Schuyler: I know. I--I told Stacy no, but she and Kim swore to me up and down if I didn't do it, they'd find somebody else to hook them up, so I convinced myself that at least I could make sure it was done safely.",
        "Rachel: There is nothing safe about any of this, Schuy.",
        "Schuyler: I know. I got that. I got it. In the end, I realized that. And I couldn't--I couldn't go through with it.",
        "Rachel: So, you didn't administer the drug.",
        "Schuyler: Hell, no. Hell, no. So many things could've gone wrong. That's when I realized how desperate I was. It was like using again, and lying, stealing, only this time, I wasn't destroying my own life, I was destroying everybody else's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Do you know how many hours it's been?",
        "Rex: Makes me think about when we were waiting for the news about Shane. But look what happened. He pulled through and so will Sierra. Where did Stacy come up with that name, anyway?",
        "Gigi: You don't like it?",
        "Rex: No, I do. It's just she never mentioned it when we were talking about names.",
        "Gigi: Sierra was her doll's name. When we were kids. And mine was Rose. Stacy started thinking about those days after she gave birth, when we felt like sisters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'll just be a minute. Hey, where's Markko? Do not tell me he's calling Langston.",
        "Starr: Better. He went home to surprise her.",
        "Cole: I thought Langston needed to finish her musical.",
        "Starr: I guess he wanted to see her more. So, what did your friend want to talk to you about?",
        "Cole: Oh, just a research project for sociology. Our professor wants us to work in pairs.",
        "Starr: Oh, so she wants you to be the other half of her pair?",
        "Cole: Are you okay with that?",
        "Starr: Why wouldn't I be okay with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, when we met, I was sick?",
        "Brody: We both were. We were friends at first, helping each other get better, and little by little, we fell in love.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I know I'm supposed to be that person, but I look at it and I don't know her.",
        "Brody: Give it time.",
        "Jessica: No. I don't want to give it any more time. I've lost 10 years of my life. I'm not gonna waste one minute more on a life that doesn't matter to me.",
        "Brody: Don't say that.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I'm not trying to hurt you. It's just, you know, the more I look at this stuff, these pictures, the more numb I feel.",
        "Brody: Okay. I'll leave you alone. I just want you to do one thing for me before I go. Kiss me.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Brody: When I first found you up on that mountain, I kissed you, and something inside you responded to that kiss.",
        "Jessica: Maybe you were just imagining that.",
        "Brody: No, I felt it. I'm in there somewhere, Jess. I'm in your dreams, I'm in your heart. Please. Just let me help you come back to me.",
        "Jessica: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Oh, I knew it. I couldn't picture you giving Stacy that drug. I mean, even after I found it in your backpack.",
        "Schuyler: Whoa. Wait. My backpack?",
        "Rachel: Yeah, they brought it to the apartment. And Greg was about to look through it to try to find proof, and I stopped him. But after he left, I found it myself.",
        "Schuyler: My God, Rachel. I'll get rid of it.",
        "Rachel: You can't. I gave it to someone.",
        "Schuyler: Who?",
        "Rachel: T\u00e9a.",
        "Schuyler: T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "Rachel: If she has it, nobody can use it as evidence.",
        "Schuyler: You seriously trust her?",
        "Rachel: I'm not just her friend. I'm a client now. She has a professional responsibility to do what I ask her to do. Schuyler, everything is going to be okay. Nobody is gonna be able to accuse you of something you didn't do.",
        "Schuyler: You really think I care about my career right now? Why should I? Why should I? Everything else in my life is gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Did you get ahold of Noelle?",
        "Rex: Everything's cool. Shane's asleep.",
        "Gigi: Thank God he's had you while I've been caught up in all this.",
        "Rex: He'll always have me. I'm his dad. That's forever.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I wonder if it'll be the same for Schuyler and Sierra.",
        "Rex: Why wouldn't it be?",
        "Gigi: He sure did go a long time without claiming her.",
        "Rex: Now that everybody knows the truth, that'll change.",
        "Gigi: I guess.",
        "Rex: Face it. He's in her life from here on out, which puts him smack in the middle of your life, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Ha! That was good. I'll give you that. But if that was supposed to trigger something, I'm sorry. It's like I've never kissed you before in my life, and that can't happen again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, darling, when you were missing, the only ray of hope for your father and me was the fact that John was with you. We knew that he wouldn't let anything happen to you. We knew he would keep you safe.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, even... even let me turn him into someone else.",
        "Viki: What do you mean?",
        "Natalie: Well...the crash. I--I was in pretty bad shape, you know. Explosion, and I had a concussion. I was confused, in shock. And I thought that John was Jared.",
        "Viki: You were delirious?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, and John thought that I was gonna black out, so, you know, he did whatever he thought would keep me conscious, and I-- I kissed John.",
        "Viki: Because you thought he was Jared.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. The first time. And then I kissed him again and I knew he was John.",
        "Viki: What are you saying? That you've fallen for John again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: When you found us, Natalie knew who she was kissing. I shouldn't have let it happen.",
        "Marty: Then why did you?",
        "John: I'm not sure. I think it was a--a reaction to feeling like we'd never get out of there, that we'd freeze to death. I don't know. But I know it was a mistake. I got caught up in a moment and suddenly I was back in my past when Natalie and I had something together. But we don't anymore.",
        "Marty: Then I guess I have only one question. If I hadn't come in on that moment, how far would it have gone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey. You have nothing to worry about, okay? But if you came up to me and you said you were working on an assignment with some good-looking guy...",
        "Starr: So you admit that she's gorgeous?",
        "Cole: Did I say gorgeous? I don't think I said gorgeous. Look, the point is, is if you have a problem with this, then I'll just tell Hannah to get another partner.",
        "Starr: Seriously?",
        "Cole: Yeah. I'll just work with one of the guys. Whatever you want. Your call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You have to get out of here.",
        "Ford: Where?",
        "Langston: In the closet. Over here. I'll be right there, Markko. You're home early.",
        "Markko: I couldn't enjoy it without you. Hey. You okay?",
        "Langston: Yeah. Why?",
        "Markko: You feel a little warm. And what's with the chain on the door?",
        "Langston: I don't know. I--I heard a noise in the hallway. I got a little spooked, I guess.",
        "Markko: Well, I'm all for a little extra security when you're all alone here.",
        "Langston: Markko... I wasn't alone.",
        "Markko: I know you weren't alone. I mean, not technically. Hope was here.",
        "Langston: That's not what I meant.",
        "Markko: What did you mean?",
        "Langston: Well... I felt like I had company because the TV was on.",
        "Markko: Oh. I thought you were gonna work on the musical.",
        "Langston: I know. I tried, but I couldn't get my head into it. I don't know why.",
        "Markko: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Langston: You know, actually, I do feel kind of warm and a little achy. Do you think you could get me some aspirin?",
        "Markko: Yeah. Yeah, sure.",
        "Langston: Come on.",
        "Ford: Like it or not, tonight happened for a reason.",
        "Langston: Get out of here!",
        "Markko: What are you doing?",
        "Langston: I was just relocking it. Oh. Thank you.",
        "Markko: Poor baby. What's wrong?",
        "Langston: Nothing. I just-- if I'm getting something, I don't want you to come down with it.",
        "Markko: Oh, you're amazing. Always thinking of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So, you're going to be doing a project with a girl. So what? And so what that she's really pretty and smart and... is she smart?",
        "Cole: Yeah. That's kind of why I wanted to work with her.",
        "Starr: Well, what's the project about, anyway?",
        "Cole: You really want to know?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Well, human sexuality. Kidding. I'm kidding.",
        "Starr: That is not funny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: The honest answer is I don't know what would've happened. But my guess is it would've ended there.",
        "Marty: I guess I want to believe that.",
        "John: I don't want to be with her. I want to be with you. I think we have something worth fighting for.",
        "Marty: I hope so.",
        "John: Last time I asked you... if you thought you could trust me again, and I didn't give you a chance to answer.",
        "Marty: No, you kissed me instead. Were you afraid of what I might say?",
        "John: Maybe. Maybe I thought I'd give you the chance to think about it. And now that you have... I'm gonna ask you again. Can you forgive me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: My relationship with John was very intense, but it's different now. We're friends. That's all it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry it didn't work, Brody.",
        "Brody: No, you keep them.",
        "Jessica: It's not gonna change anything.",
        "Brody: Things can always change. You know, when I set out in a blizzard to find you, I didn't think I'd make it, but I did. If that doesn't prove anything's possible...",
        "Jessica: Thanks so much, again, for saving me.",
        "Brody: Yeah, well, I saved you, so you owe me. Just...just keep looking at those pictures. They'll tell you everything you need to know.",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: If I have to deal with Schuyler because of the baby, so be it. But I don't want to talk about him right now.",
        "Rex: Great. I don't want to hear about him.",
        "Gigi: The important thing is Sierra Rose and that tiny, little heart of hers. God, she has to make it.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: The operation's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, darling, I really like Brody, okay, and I know he means well, but if you're not ready to remember, I don't think he should try and force you.",
        "Jessica: I don't blame him for trying. If I was in his shoes...this must really suck for him, you know?",
        "Viki: Well, he's strong, and he will be all right, okay? You'll have to concentrate on getting well enough to go home. If the memories come, that's wonderful. If they don't, darling, we will find a way to deal with it.",
        "Jessica: But sometimes I feel like I'm getting really close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm really sorry that those videos didn't trigger any ... we're just gonna have to give Jessica more time.",
        "Brody: That's what I keep telling myself. I'm gonna grab some drinks.",
        "Natalie: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: When you say you're getting close, does that mean that Brody seems familiar to you?",
        "Jessica: No, no. It's not like that. I don't remember him, like, not at all. But when I look at certain pictures, it's like I remember a feeling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Tell Jess that I'm glad she's okay. I'm keeping her in my thoughts.",
        "Brody: Thanks, man, I appreciate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I feel for Brody. He's so anxious for Jessica to fill in the blanks.",
        "John: I think that's what you call in the shrink business changing the subject.",
        "Marty: Right.",
        "John: You were going to tell me if you can forgive me.",
        "Marty: For getting caught up in the moment with an old flame.",
        "John: Something like that.",
        "Marty: All right. Here's what I think. Moments happen. I've had a few myself. And it doesn't-- it doesn't seem like you're interested in living in the past.",
        "John: I'm not.",
        "Marty: So, let's move forward.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say good-bye.",
        "Starr: Oh, you're leaving already?",
        "Hannah: I have a paper to do. I'll see you in class, Cole.",
        "Cole: Yeah. See you.",
        "Hannah: It was nice to meet you, Starr.",
        "Starr: Same here. She seems really nice. What?! I mean it. She seems really nice.",
        "Cole: Okay. You mean it.",
        "Starr: I'm really sorry I got all girlfriend on you there.",
        "Cole: But you are my girlfriend. And I love you.",
        "Starr: I love you, too. And if we love each other, we're supposed to trust each other. And I promise I'm gonna work on that.",
        "Cole: Trust. I like the sound of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I'm sorry you feel sick. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Langston: You already got me some aspirin. I probably just need to lie down and sleep it off.",
        "Markko: I could rub your shoulders.",
        "Langston: Markko, come on. I really don't want you to come down with this.",
        "Markko: The whole ride home, I was thinking about making love to you, and now you're gonna make me send you off to our nice, warm bed all by yourself? That hurts.",
        "Langston: You know, I'm sure I'll feel better tomorrow.",
        "Markko: You're right. There's always tomorrow. And...the next day and the day after that, for the rest of our lives.",
        "Langston: You know what? I really just need to go to bed.",
        "Markko: Okay. Come on. You know, I feel really bad you missed the concert. Snoop Dogg was unbelievable. You really should've been there.",
        "Langston: Yeah. I should've.",

        "Schuyler: Gigi told me that Sierra's out of surgery. Is she okay?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Well, I wanted you as the baby's father to be here when I gave my report. The first thing you should know is the procedure went well.",
        "Gigi: Oh, thank God. Can I see her?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: She's in recovery, so it's gonna be a while.",
        "Schuyler: But--but she's gonna be okay?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Well, that's what the next 24 hours is gonna tell us. We repaired the heart, but now we just need to see if the body's gonna respond the way we hope it will.",
        "Rex: So, we're not out of the woods yet.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Not yet.",
        "Schuyler: But in--in 24 hours, we'll know?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Give or take. In the meantime, all we can do is wait.",
        "Gigi: Then we'll wait. We'll wait as long as it takes.",
