        "Lindsay: Hey, thank you for meeting me here. I know that this isn't your usual kind of place.",
        "Dorian: No problem. I've always been very close to Carlotta. I practically raised her sons.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah, I see you're taking advantage of her amazing desserts. God, I wish I could eat that stuff.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Actually, this isn't for me. It's for you.",
        "Lindsay: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Bo: Got your message. You know who killed Truman?",
        "John: Yeah -- maybe.",
        "Bo: Who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Was Nelly Furtado great, or what?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael: She was great, ok?",
        "Marcie: I could say \"I told you so,\" but I won't.",
        "Michael: A, I think you just did, and, by the way, why would you do something like that?",
        "Marcie: Because we had a good time, even though you didn't want to come.",
        "Michael: Tommy's just so little.",
        "Marcie: I thought I had separation issues. I can't believe you freaked out over Starr babysitting Tommy.",
        "Michael: Well, I would've felt a lot more secure if we left him with Lindsay .",
        "Marcie: Well, Lindsay had other plans, and besides, Starr has a really special relationship with him.",
        "Michael: Well, she's --",
        "Marcie: She's what? What?",
        "Michael: She's very young.",
        "Marcie: Yes, but she's capable of taking care of Tommy. Look, she takes care of Jack all the time and she hasn't lost him yet, has she? Don't worry. He's very safe with her.",
        "Antonio: Hey.",
        "Marcie: Hey!",
        "Michael: Hey!",
        "Antonio: You guys enjoy the concert?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Oh, oh, are you kidding? Did you? I mean, I know you had a lot of --",
        "Antonio: Ah, no, no, no, but I -- I took some time out to watch. Hey, you guys see Jessica by any chance?",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Marcie: No, it's been a mob scene.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: No, I know, I know.",
        "Marcie: You know what? We'll let her know that you're looking for her if we see her.",
        "Antonio: Ok. Thank you.",
        "Michael: Thanks again, man.",
        "Antonio: All right.",
        "Talia: Hey.",
        "Antonio: Hey.",
        "Talia: Great concert",
        "Antonio: Uh, uh -- thank you.",
        "Talia: I'm totally impressed.",
        "Antonio: Thank you, thank you. I -- I didn't see you here earlier.",
        "Talia: Oh, no, I came late and stood in the back, but looks like everyone had a really great time.",
        "Antonio: Well, yeah, not -- not everyone. Um -- excuse me.",
        "Talia: Ok.",
        "Antonio: So you think drinking is going to solve your problems?",
        "Cristian: Who said I had problems?",
        "Antonio: All right, well, this does.",
        "Cristian: Hey, I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not the only one drinking tonight.",
        "Antonio: No, but you are the only one who thinks his girlfriend betrayed him.",
        "Cristian: Only because I know she cheated on me.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. I see.",
        "Cristian: Some guys don't know what their girlfriends or wives are doing behind their back.",
        "Antonio: Right. You know, Evangeline didn't do anything behind your back because she told you that she kissed Todd.",
        "Cristian: Doesn't make it any better.",
        "Antonio: Hmm, so, what, you think that she did more than kiss him?",
        "Cristian: She said she didn't, and that the kiss was a mistake.",
        "Antonio: Ok. So why don't you believe her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Oh. You should go.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Whew. I swore I'd never do that again.",
        "Jessica: So why did you?",
        "Nash: I don't know. If you want to slap me again, go ahead.",
        "Jessica: No, no, I kissed you back.",
        "Nash: Yeah. It's not a crime.",
        "Jessica: Wanting more is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You know, I really thought we had something special. And I was starting to think about the whole nine yards with Evangeline -- marriage, kids, the works.",
        "Antonio: Well, the last time I heard, you weren't ready for that.",
        "Cristian: Not the point. The point is that every time I brought it up, she said it was too soon. Now I know why.",
        "Antonio: Oh, because you think she has a thing for Manning?",
        "Cristian: That's what kissing usually means.",
        "Antonio: Well, not always. Look, the last time I saw you two together, she was crazy in love with you.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. She has a funny way of showing it, don't you think?",
        "Antonio: You know -- listen, Cristian. Have you ever thought that maybe, just -- just maybe, you know, Todd manipulated her into that kiss?",
        "Antonio: Because the guy doesn't do well on his own, man. I mean, look, Blair just dumped him, he needs a little sympathy, and Evangeline feels sorry for him.",
        "Cristian: I think it's a little more than that.",
        "Antonio: All right, look. I'm not a shrink, but if I were to wager, I would bet that he knows that she feels guilty that she wasn't able to save him from death row, ok? So he's using her to make Blair jealous, all right, so what she said to you is true -- the kiss was a mistake.",
        "Cristian: Ok, ok. Let's say it was.",
        "Antonio: Uh-huh.",
        "Cristian: What am I supposed to do with that?",
        "Antonio: You are supposed to swallow your pride and tell her that she means the world to you.",
        "Cristian: That's easy for you to say, Antonio. Let me ask you something -- what would you do if you found out Jessica was sleeping with another man?",
        "Antonio: I'd kill the son of a bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Are you saying that you have feelings for me?",
        "Jessica: What do you think, Nash?",
        "Nash: I think you should come out and say it, tell the truth, stop playing games. Say the words, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Ok, ok -- I think about you all the time. I think about you when I'm feeding Bree, when I'm getting Jamie ready for school. I think about you and I wonder what you're doing and I wonder if you're thinking about me.",
        "Nash: Always. But are you thinking those things are or is Tess?",
        "Jessica: No, no. Tess isn't even in the equation.",
        "Nash: Jessica --",
        "Jessica: No, no, don't, please. No making things worse.",
        "Nash: Oh, hey, wouldn't want to make things worse.",
        "Jessica: Oh, and you are. I love Antonio, I'm married to him, so why can't I stop thinking about you?",
        "Nash: For the same reasons I can't stop thinking about you.",
        "Jessica: Don't go there.",
        "Nash: You know what? For the longest time, I tried to convince myself that I was in love with Tess.",
        "Jessica: Maybe you are.",
        "Nash: I'm not. You and I belong together. I know that now and so do you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: The phone -- Hello?",
        "Marcie: Hey, Starr, it's me. Everything ok?",
        "Starr: Yeah, yeah, Tommy's perfect. He's -- he's sleeping. No problems.",
        "Marcie: No, I didn't think there would be. Look, we're about to leave right now. Can you stay another hour?",
        "Starr: No problem. Bye. Are you hungry? Do you want me to -- look, there's a slice left. Do you want me to heat you up one? Or you can have it cold, whichever one that you would want --",
        "Cole: Starr, Starr? Stop. Why -- why don't you just come sit down?",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Cole: So, can we talk about something else?",
        "Starr: Sure. What?",
        "Cole: Sex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: You're paying my dry-cleaning bill.",
        "Dorian: Sue me.",
        "Lindsay: What's gotten into you?",
        "Dorian: You told Viki when you went to Llanfair that I asked you to stall her so that I could have more time alone with Clint.",
        "Lindsay: And I'm sorry about that, but that's why I invited you here -- so that I could apologize.",
        "Dorian: Too little, too late.",
        "Lindsay: I didn't mean to rat you out.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Really? Sure.",
        "Lindsay: I didn't. You know, I was talking to Viki, and, well, we started talking about Jen and Megan and how much we both still miss them.",
        "Dorian: My heart bleeds for both of you.",
        "Lindsay: You know, you would have a different attitude if something like that happened to Adriana. Now, I know it pains you, but Viki and I connected.",
        "Dorian: And I'm sure --",
        "Lindsay: We're grieving mothers.",
        "Dorian: Viki --",
        "Lindsay: No, I couldn't lie to her.",
        "Dorian: I wish you had because I am sure she went straight to Clint and she told him all about it and now we are going to have to work twice as hard to win him back for me.",
        "Lindsay: There you go, with the \"we\" again.",
        "Dorian: Hey -- listen up. You have a gallery opening. You invite Clint, I just happen to be there.",
        "Lindsay: No, forget it.",
        "Dorian: What do you mean? We have a deal. You're going to help me win Clint back, I'm going to help you win Bo back.",
        "Lindsay: You know, I was really never crazy about this idea. I'm not interested in scheming to get Bo back.",
        "Dorian: Oh, since when?",
        "Lindsay: Since I did that years ago and lost him as a result of it.",
        "Dorian: But a good man is hard to find and worth fighting for.",
        "Lindsay: Bo is with Paige now.",
        "Dorian: Oh --",
        "Lindsay: I can't break them up.",
        "Dorian: Oh, gosh. Oh, look -- speak of the devil. Hi, Paige! Hello! How you doing?",
        "Lindsay: What are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Dorian: Come on over. Hey.",
        "Paige: Hey.",
        "Lindsay: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Were your ears burning? Because we were just talking about you.",
        "Paige: Really?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. You want to know why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Is there a problem?",
        "John: What if it's someone I know?",
        "Bo: Is it someone that's important to you? John, do you remember when you said you wanted to work this case, I warned you? I told you that it might turn out that Truman's killer is someone you care about?",
        "John: And you were right.",
        "Bo: How close are you?",
        "John: I told you I wouldn't let my personal feelings get in the way of me doing my job.",
        "Bo: And I took you at your word. Was I wrong? Do you have proof that this person killed Truman?",
        "John: Nothing that you want to take to the D. A.",
        "Bo: Yeah. What do you have?",
        "John: Someone with a very strong motive.",
        "Bo: What about means? Opportunity? John, if this person was someone other than someone that you know that you care about, how would you proceed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Ok. Thanks for dragging me out. I had a great time.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm. It's one of the perks of being married -- you get to see your husband have some fun.",
        "Michael: Whew -- having fun? I almost forgot what that was like.",
        "Marcie: Hmm, I know. You've just been under a lot of stress lately, that's all.",
        "Michael: Whew, and how.",
        "Marcie: I did think that Spencer's death would give you a little more closure, though.",
        "Michael: Can we",
        "Marcie: Yes, I'm sorry. You know, it's just that, well, you've -- I don't know. You see more upset than before Spencer was killed. Maybe when they catch the real killer, it --",
        "Michael: No! I mean, I don't know if they're ever going to catch Spencer's killer.",
        "Marcie: Hey, Michael, you cannot possibly be ok with that.",
        "Michael: Of course I'm ok with it. The guy killed somebody who deserved to die, and he probably saved Blair's life in the process.",
        "Marcie: But that doesn't mean that he deserves to go free.",
        "Michael: Marcie, what if the killer was someone you loved?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: It'd not so easy to forgive when it's Jessica, is it?",
        "Antonio: It -- you know, Cristian, yes, I would want to kill the guy who kissed Jessica, all right? But first, I would want to hear her side of the story.",
        "Cristian: How could she possibly come up with an explanation for why she kissed another guy?",
        "Antonio: I -- I don't know. I don't know. But, you know, people make mistakes, including me.",
        "Cristian: Huh. You see, this is -- this is the whole Vega problem here. We're always blaming ourselves. It's not always your fault, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Well, then maybe it's not always Evangeline's. She made a mistake. That doesn't erase all her love for you.",
        "Cristian: If she has any love for me. Jury's out on that.",
        "Antonio: You know, when you got hurt, she was the first one that convinced you to find another creative outlet, right? All right? And you weren't easy on her, ok? Now, that is love.",
        "Cristian: Or pity.",
        "Antonio: She was willing to give up her job when you were a suspect in the arson case. That's not pity, Cris. That's sacrifice, ok? When was the last time you sacrificed anything for her?",
        "Cristian: She kissed another guy, Antonio, not just another guy -- Todd Manning! Now, how am I supposed to erase that out of my head, huh?",
        "Antonio: Are you asking me how I got over Nash and Tess? Do you love her?",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: Ok. Then sacrifice your damn pride and forgive her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You and I belong together, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: This is out of control.",
        "Nash: It doesn't have to be.",
        "Jessica: There's no easy solution here.",
        "Nash: There is if you stop listening to your head and trust your heart.",
        "Jessica: I love Antonio, Nash.",
        "Nash: No, you're convincing yourself that you do. But you belong with me.",
        "Jessica: You make it sound like we're soul mates.",
        "Nash: We are. And we have Bree. Have you thought about what it would be like? Can you even imagine --",
        "Jessica: Yes, I have and I can!",
        "Nash: You, me, and Bree? We can make this work.",
        "Jessica: And Antonio!",
        "Nash: Leave him. Run away with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: So why were you talking about me? Lindsay huh -- how much we all have in common. We're all career women.",
        "Dorian: We've all dated Buchanan men.",
        "Paige: Yeah -- is there a support group for that?",
        "Lindsay: Yes, it's called vodka. You know what, Dorian? We better get going or we're going to be late.",
        "Dorian: Oh, who cares if we're late? Huh. You know, you are so lucky to have a man like Bo in your life.",
        "Paige: I know. He's -- he's really great.",
        "Dorian: And I'm sure that Lindsay would agree with you on that, right, Lindsay?",
        "Lindsay: Ok. We got to go -- now.",
        "Dorian: Paige, do you know that Lindsay has been trying to break you and Bo up behind your back?",
        "Lindsay: Dorian!",
        "Paige: What?",
        "Dorian: Yes. Lindsay wants Bo back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: If I didn't know the person, I'd hold him for questioning.",
        "Bo: Then that's your answer. You know, you've got to treat this suspect the way you would any other suspect.",
        "John: It's not as easy as it sounds.",
        "Bo: Huh. If you want easy, turn in your badge, get a job on a cruise ship.",
        "John: As tempting as that sounds, you know I'm not going to do that.",
        "Bo: I know, then you got to do what's right, John. It's what the department expects.",
        "John: I could be totally wrong about this person, Bo.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you could be totally right. And if you back off, it shouldn't be too hard for me to figure out who you're protecting.",
        "John: I need some time, figure out how to handle this.",
        "Bo: Don't take too long. Remember, you betray the badge, you sell your soul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Ok. Yeah, here we go. Here's the remote. So -- should I call you tomorrow?",
        "Evangeline: Are you going to be ok?",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, I'll be fine.",
        "Evangeline: I know it's going to be tough going to an empty penthouse.",
        "Todd: Oh, well, nah. I'm sure I'll be fine. What about you? Are you going to be ok? You going to -- you going to weather this Cristian thing?",
        "Evangeline: We're going to work it out.",
        "Todd: Well, don't work too hard because -- I mean, take Blair and me, for example. No two people worked harder to salvage something that wasn't meant to be.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian and I are meant to be -- I still believe that. I just got to make him understand that what happened between you and me -- it didn't mean anything.",
        "Todd: I guess I'm supposed to apologize for being the cause of the problems you guys are having, but I can't. I think you can do a lot better than Cristian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I want to forgive her.",
        "Antonio: And she obviously wants to be forgiven.",
        "Cristian: How do you know that?",
        "Antonio: Well, she was honest about the kiss.",
        "Cristian: Maybe she just didn't want manning bragging about it.",
        "Antonio: No, man, I seriously doubt that. Look, if -- if she wanted manning to keep quiet about it, she would've told him. All right, look, you know, I'd be worried if she kept it a secret.",
        "Jessica: I am not going to put my family at risk by telling Antonio about some meaningless kiss with Nash.",
        "Cristian: I doubt it was meaningless.",
        "Jessica: Were you there?",
        "Cristian: Things like this always come out, Jess, always.",
        "Antonio: She loves you, Cris. And you know, a love like that only comes once in a lifetime, dude. Fight for it.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Yeah, it was great.",
        "Talia: Listen, I hope there's no hard, you know, feelings between the two of us, you know, about my investigating you as an arson suspect.",
        "Cristian: Look, you were doing your job and that all worked out anyway.",
        "Cristian: Well, I thought the cops got close to catching him.",
        "Antonio: We'll -- we'll get him next time.",
        "Cristian: Well, it better be soon. Between your building and Vincent's and now Nora's place, if you asked me, I think he's hitting way too close to home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I can't run away with you.",
        "Nash: Why not?",
        "Jessica: Two words -- Antonio and Jamie.",
        "Nash: How is ignoring your own feelings any less painful?",
        "Jessica: I'm not ignoring my feelings. I love Antonio, I married him.",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Jessica: And if he found out what we did, it would --",
        "Nash: It would kill him.",
        "Jessica: It would kill me, too. Breaking his heart would really kill me. I get it. I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but Antonio is a good guy. And he's been a good friend. Yeah, he's been nothing but kind and generous, and this is how we repay him?",
        "Nash: Jessica, somebody's going to get hurt.",
        "Jessica: Not Antonio. Not Antonio.",
        "Nash: Well, then, us.",
