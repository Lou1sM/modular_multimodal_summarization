        "Jessica: Hi, it's Jessica Buchanan Brennan calling -- I'm calling to check on someone in the I.C.U. Allison Perkins.",
        "Nash: That is exactly right.",
        "Jessica: Yes, I can hold.",
        "Nash: Yeah, fantastic, I can hold.",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "Nash: Yes, this is him.",
        "Jessica: Yes, okay.",
        "Nash: Hi. Well, no, but thank you very much. Well, at the moment, we have the absolute best Cabernet Franc in the region. And come spring, we will have three equally fantastic and wonderful sparkling wines.",
        "Jessica: Uh-uh, I'm sorry, I don't understand that medical jargon. Can you tell me what that means? Oh. Okay.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Whew. My dear, things are looking very, very good for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Marce, you almost ready? We don't want to be late for your hearing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: All right, let's see the agreement.",
        "Todd: God, it just makes me sick letting her get away with this.",
        "Nora: She's not getting away with anything. The judge is going to decide on her sentencing.",
        "Todd: I don't have a pen.",
        "Bo: Excuse me. Nora, you seen the judge yet?",
        "Nora: No, but I'm early -- why?",
        "Bo: Oh, I just had to tie up some loose ends, that's all -- prior cases.",
        "Nora: Speaking of getting sick to my stomach -- I don't understand how the mayor can remove you from office and then give that very important office to someone like Lee Ramsey. I mean, what is he thinking?",
        "Todd: And what are you going to do about it, Bo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: How did this happen?",
        "Talia: John, on your trip to D.C., did you dig up anything on him?",
        "John: How could Bo be replaced by this son of a bitch?",
        "Talia: The mayor.",
        "John: The mayor? Has what -- lost his mind? Is that what you're telling me?",
        "Antonio: He wanted Bo to give up guardianship of Lindsay. Bo refused.",
        "Talia: He wouldn't resign, either.",
        "Antonio: So Lowell replaced him with Ramsey.",
        "John: Lowell knew Bo would never back away from his responsibilities to Lindsay. That guy's a crook. He's always been in -- he's always been in someone's back pocket. This time, it's Ramsey's.",
        "Antonio: John --",
        "John: Get out of my way.",
        "Antonio: No. Where's it going to get you? Charging in there, blowing up at him?",
        "John: I'm not going to let him get away with what he's done, all right? Now, back off!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Oh, it's like February out there.",
        "Gigi: Seeing as how it is February, that should come as no surprise.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Pretty cold in here, too.",
        "Gigi: There's some hot chocolate on the stove. I made it for Shane. Where is he anyway?",
        "Rex: Game room. He wants to hustle me at pool. He also played a marathon of video baseball, and then he wants to take me out back and play catch -- show me how hard he can throw.",
        "Gigi: In 20-degree weather.",
        "Rex: And he does throw hard. Got a swollen catching hand to prove it.",
        "Gigi: These teacher/conference days.",
        "Rex: Is that why you're in a bad mood?",
        "Gigi: I'm not, I just have a lot on my mind.",
        "Rex: Like what? And that would be none of my business. Or would it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: No one can do anything about Ramsey -- for now. But you know what? Guys like that -- they always end tripping themselves up in the end.",
        "Nora: \"In the end\"? Yeah. Well, that could be in a few weeks, in a few months, in a few years. In the meanwhile, everything is going to go to hell in a hand basket.",
        "Bo: No, we're not going to let that happen. Do me a favor; just tell the judge that I'll come back later.",
        "Nora: I will.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Nora: Bye. Sign the statement.",
        "Todd: Hmm?",
        "Nora: The statement about Marcie -- sign it.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Todd: You know, I was thinking, Nora -- you letting Marcie off the hook so easily like this, I -- I just -- I was just wondering what you think that new sheriff's going to do about that. I mean, I -- I don't think he's going to react so well. I think he's going to stomp all over you for it.",
        "Nora: Well, he's going to stomp all over a lot of people.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: Ha. No, couldn't be.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Nora: No, it's impossible -- maybe not. I think that very possibly, after all this time, we might actually agree on something.",
        "Todd: No, that's impossible.",
        "Nora: No, I think it's possible. I do. See, I'm not -- I'm not real crazy about Lee Ramsey, and I'm getting the impression you're not, either. You don't like him at all, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I know you're dreading this, Marcie. I am, too. But you know, if the judge recommends a sentence that we're not happy with, then it can always go to trial. But I have a feeling that it's not going to come to that, you know, if Todd actually follows rough with not pressing charges.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael: We need to go.",
        "Marcie: But --",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Marcie: Thanks.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: That is great news. Excellent, thank you. Thank you. Yes! Ha, ha, ha! Yes!",
        "Jessica: \"Yes,\" what?",
        "Nash: Guess. I'll give you a hint.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Nash: Okay, okay, okay, okay. What is the best possible thing that could happen to us?",
        "Jessica: I got nothing.",
        "Nash: Oh, come on!",
        "Jessica: Nash, why don't you just tell me?",
        "Nash: I got our credit line extended. The guy from the bank -- he called me back. It's all set. Hello? Super successful vineyard, expanding product line. The best part -- I can finally afford a marketing company. We're in the big- time.",
        "Jessica: That's great.",
        "Nash: Oh, my God. Maybe I can finally afford to upgrade the irrigation system. Ooh, no, probably not. And the best part -- the best of the best part -- I did it myself. I did it, me, no Jared -- although, you know, it might be a good idea to keep him on board. He -- he does come up with some pretty good ideas, and I do feel indebted to him, and how could I not? After all, how could I not feel grateful to the guy who saved my wife's life? That doesn't make you feel uncomfortable, does it?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- the fact that you're grateful to Jared? Of course not. I am, too.",
        "Nash: Jessica, who were you on the phone with?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- the hospital.",
        "Nash: To check up on Allison Perkins? I thought we were past that.",
        "Jessica: I -- I was. You know, I really tried. But I just can't help but thinking that --",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I can't help but think that maybe she wasn't lying. You know, maybe she really does know this big secret about me.",
        "Nash: I don't think she has a secret. I think that if she'd had a secret, she would've told you a long time ago. I think that if she'd had a little secret all of her own, she would've told you a heck of a lot sooner.",
        "Jessica: Maybe. Anyway, now, we'll never know.",
        "Nash: Wait a minute. Did she die?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You're not saying anything, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: That's because you were right the first time. None of it has to do with you.",
        "Rex: Been a while since I had hot chocolate. Remember -- remember back in Michigan -- senior winter break, we went ice fishing on the Upper Peninsula?",
        "Gigi: Wolf Lake.",
        "Rex: Lake? It was a glorified pond.",
        "Gigi: Still, lots of fish, though -- perch, bass, northern pike.",
        "Rex: I always thought that was redundant.",
        "Gigi: What was?",
        "Rex: Well, we were only a couple miles from the Canadian border. You're hardly likely to catch a southern pike.",
        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Gigi: I can remember a time when you didn't know what \"redundant\" meant.",
        "Rex: It was a great winter break, though. A little hut out on the lake, portable stove, cans of food, thermoses of hot chocolate.",
        "Gigi: I don't know how we managed to keep warm.",
        "Rex: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: No, Allison isn't dead, but she may as well be.",
        "Nash: What did they tell you?",
        "Jessica: They said the injuries from her fall were so severe that the doctors put her into a medically induced coma. She hasn't regained consciousness.",
        "Nash: But she could.",
        "Jessica: They don't think so.",
        "Nash: Jessica, you're not feeling guilty about this because she set herself up for this.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Yeah, I'm feeling guilty. Huh, and also, you know, I just can't help but think that maybe -- maybe Allison did have a secret, you know? And -- and -- and it could've changed my life. And now, she's lying in a hospital bed, unconscious. She's probably going to die.",
        "Nash: I don't think she had a secret. I think you're torturing yourself. I think -- I think that she was messing with you. I'm convinced that she was messing with you. She told you that she would tell you a little secret if you would spring her from St. Ann's, so you did. You and Natalie got her out of St. Ann's, and what did she do? She started terrorizing you, immediately -- mission accomplished.",
        "Jessica: Yeah -- what about the red ball? She wanted to tell this big secret in front of everyone. And what about -- what about the DVD?",
        "Nash: I think the DVD was meaningless. It doesn't matter now anyway. It was smashed in the fall so no one is going to see it.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I guess if Allison did have a secret, she's going to take it with her to the grave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Get out of my way.",
        "Talia: Men, if you'll excuse me, I want to go over some reports with Ramsey.",
        "John: I'm going in there.",
        "Antonio: And do what? What's it going to accomplish, huh? You going to beat the hell out of him? Come on, John, I'm not letting you do it.",
        "John: I'm -- I'm going to rip his head off.",
        "Antonio: And what, lose rank?",
        "John: What rank? I don't work here anymore.",
        "Antonio: Yes, you do. In a few hours, you'll be reinstated. You'll be back on the force.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So you have an intense dislike for Ramsey, too, eh?",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Todd: Well, that's no big surprise, though. I mean, you had a real cozy situation with Bo as commissioner.",
        "Nora: What are you talking about?",
        "Todd: Well, I mean, I know that you guys were at each other's throats a lot -- or so I've heard. But, I mean, you guys had a kid together so I'm sure he let you slide on a few issues, right?",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah, all the time -- no.",
        "Todd: Oh, come on.",
        "Nora: No.",
        "Todd: You got to be a little bit bummed, I mean, seeing him get kicked to the curb like that. And you had him wrapped around your little finger.",
        "Nora: Oh, for God's sake -- Bo is the most ethical police commissioner this city has ever had.",
        "Todd: Yeah, okay. Whatever you say.",
        "Nora: It's true.",
        "Todd: Yes, and he only got a dollar a year for the job.",
        "Nora: You know what? Bo has very high principles, something -- well, I know that's a concept that you can't really grasp.",
        "Todd: He's a chump.",
        "Nora: Really? Well, that \"chump\" has come to your rescue more times than I could count, or care to.",
        "Todd: He does have good instincts, I'll give him that.",
        "Nora: Yeah, and you should be eternally grateful to him because if it wasn't for Bo, you'd probably be living the rest of your life in an 8 x 10 cell.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, I am very grateful and I've let him know that on several occasions. And -- and I think it stinks seeing him get replaced by -- that stinking son of a bitch.",
        "Nora: You know something about Ramsey, don't you?",
        "Todd: I -- I don't know any more than anyone else does. I mean, I know he's a -- he's a bad actor, man. He's a -- he, uh -- he's not to be trusted.",
        "Nora: No, you -- you -- you got something on him or something. You do. Wait a second. You had to -- didn't you guys -- you had dealings with him, when you were looking for your son. And then there was that whole thing about the fact that you -- you claimed that you weren't the one that shot at -- uh -- Gigi Morasco's son. And then you pointed the finger at -- at Lee Ramsey. And -- and then you backed off. Why? Why did you do that? Why did you abandon all that?",
        "Todd: Well, the charges against me were dropped, so I let it go.",
        "Nora: No. No, no, no, Todd. No, no, no, no. You -- no. When someone crosses you, you're all about revenge.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, I've mellowed.",
        "Nora: Yeah, right. No, you know something about him -- what is it? What is it that you got on him? What are you not telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Nash: I don't understand.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Nash: You were so grounded when you walked out of that hospital room. You were not going to obsess over Allison Perkins anymore.",
        "Jessica: I know. I know. And then I woke up this morning and -- and I couldn't get it out of my mind. I couldn't stop thinking about how I ran into her in St. Ann's and how she kept on taunting me about this stupid secret that she had about me. And I know -- I know, I know, I know -- I should be counting my blessings and not going looking for trouble.",
        "Nash: Yeah. I mean, aside from your health -- which is the most important thing, right? The vineyard is solid. Jared -- Jared is no longer a thorn in our side. I mean, after all, anybody who takes a bullet for my wife has got to be okay in my book. Jessica, the little black cloud that has been hanging over us is finally being lifted.",
        "Jessica: I know. I know. After getting so used to struggling and being afraid, I don't know what to do with all this happiness. Hmm.",
        "Nash: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: That's not my problem. Figure it out. What do you want?",
        "Talia: I need a case file.",
        "Ramsey: I'm handling all open cases now.",
        "Talia: It's a cold case.",
        "Ramsey: Cold? You're out of luck. Trash can.",
        "Talia: You throw them away? They're unsolved. Why would you do that?",
        "Ramsey: That -- \"unsolved\" generally means \"move on,\" okay? We're done.",
        "Talia: Um -- I -- I have a procedural question.",
        "Ramsey: Don't care.",
        "Talia: You don't even know what I was going to ask.",
        "Ramsey: It doesn't matter. Oh, and about the fraternization policy -- you and -- what's his name?",
        "Talia: \"What's his name\"?",
        "Ramsey: Your friend, the Hispanic cop.",
        "Talia: His name is Antonio.",
        "Ramsey: Hmm. Your family's okay with that?",
        "Talia: \"My family\"?",
        "Ramsey: Yeah, some Arab families keep women under tight wraps.",
        "Talia: I'd better get back to work.",
        "Ramsey: But they're not like that?",
        "Talia: What are you talking about?",
        "Ramsey: May be a mixed marriage with those beautiful blue eyes. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Bo have something to do with this?",
        "Antonio: He knew he was getting fired so he fast-tracked your reinstatement.",
        "John: That was a mistake.",
        "Antonio: Come on, John --",
        "John: There's no way I'm reporting to that bastard.",
        "Antonio: Bo wants this. The department needs you. All right, look, Talia and I -- we felt the same way. All right, we wanted to resign when Ramsey came in. Bo talked us out of it, so we stayed out of respect for him. Now, the best thing you can do is get out of here before Ramsey sees you and stops your reinstatement from going through.",
        "John: I'd do anything for Bo, but not this. I can't work for him.",
        "Antonio: Then tell it to Bo. He's in the courthouse tying up a few loose ends.",
        "Antonio: Thanks for the diversion. What's wrong?",
        "Talia: I need a shower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: A simple yes-or-no question, Todd. Do you or do you not know something about Ramsey?",
        "Todd: I lost the pen.",
        "Nora: I could bring him to his knees. Just give me something. Tell me something and I'll run him right out of Llanview, anything at all. Just give me one thing and I will take it from there.",
        "Ramsey: Changing your targets -- it's just as easy as changing your mind.",
        "Todd: No. That's Dorian's. Are you threatening my family now?",
        "Nora: Anything you can give me that'll bring him down.",
        "Todd: Don't you think if I could say something --",
        "Nora: Finish that, Todd. If you could, you would, but --",
        "Todd: I have nothing to tell you.",
        "Nora: Hey, I have something for you, Michael.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Michael: Oh, I can't believe this. I've been reinstated at the hospital.",
        "Nora: Congratulations, Michael. Todd, sign that, please.",
        "Michael: You haven't signed it yet?",
        "Todd: No, I'm having mixed feelings about giving a free pass to someone who kidnaps babies.",
        "Nora: Sign the statement now, please. Thank you.",
        "Todd: Marcie? What's wrong with her? Obviously, she can't find the words to express her gratitude to me. Or maybe she's tired -- from all the kidnapping and ruining people's lives. It takes a lot out of you, doesn't it? You know what? I want to -- I want you guys to remember one thing that you can be proud of. Lee Ramsey would never have heard of Llanview if it weren't for you. So it's not all doom and gloom. Also, I want you to see something here. Here you go. It's my brand-new happy family. Check it out.",
        "Nora: Todd, don't do this --",
        "Todd: No, no, this will ease her conscience. It's got to feel better knowing that the kid she tried to rob me of is where he belongs. Yes, yes, touch it. No worries, Marcie. After all the kidnapping and running out on your husband, everything else -- holding my sister hostage -- it's a happy ending. Just not for you.",
        "Michael: Todd --",
        "Todd: Not for you.",
        "Michael: Put it away.",
        "Todd: You don't deserve one, do you, Marcie?",
        "Michael: Put it away, please.",
        "Todd: Look.",
        "Michael: Put it away!",
        "Nora: Todd?",
        "Todd: Hmm? Does that mean yes? Okay, here. Let's see. Here's one with his new mom. He doesn't remember you, Marcie. He couldn't care less about you. He doesn't miss you. Look. You'll never see him again.",
        "Nora: All right, you know what? You got to go right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Viki should be here any minute.",
        "Rex: Not to change the subject.",
        "Gigi: I didn't know we had a subject.",
        "Rex: Fish. The bass I caught must've weighed five pounds.",
        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Gigi: Pound and a half, tops.",
        "Rex: Oh, come on! It barely -- barely fit in the pan!",
        "Gigi: It was good eating, though.",
        "Rex: You fried it up perfectly as I recall. You still a good cook?",
        "Gigi: I'm a better waitress.",
        "Rex: As good as Viki?",
        "Gigi: Huh. I can't imagine what could be keeping her.",
        "Rex: Wild guess -- Mr. Charlie Balsom.",
        "Gigi: What was it like meeting the father you never knew?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: All right, are you going to tell me what went on in there, or should I take it up with Ramsey?",
        "Talia: Drop it, okay? It's fine.",
        "Antonio: It's obviously not.",
        "Talia: I'm handling it.",
        "Antonio: Talia, please.",
        "Talia: I don't want you going after him.",
        "Antonio: Why would I do that?",
        "Talia: Because he made a remark about my beautiful blue eyes.",
        "Antonio: Oh. Are we talking about sexual harassment here?",
        "Talia: Or minority harassment -- maybe a little bit of both.",
        "Antonio: Hey, you want to tell me what he said?",
        "Talia: He was just doing his usual thing -- being condescending and snide, and he said something about Arabs and was surprised that my eyes weren't dark. It's, you know, not anything a person could go to court with but he knew that.",
        "Antonio: Well, thanks for telling me. You know -- ahem -- if he ever speaks to you like that again, I'm going to take the guy out myself.",
        "Talia: No. No, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Look, Talia, I'm just saying --",
        "Talia: Stop! I know what you're just saying, you know? You want to protect poor Talia from the evil in all the world but, you know, I don't want that -- and I don't need it. I can take care of myself. I have my entire life.",
        "Antonio: Hey, I didn't mean --",
        "Talia: Did I not take out that pimp, at the waterfront? I laid him out, I didn't get any help. And who took charge of the drug bust last week?",
        "Antonio: That -- that would be you.",
        "Talia: I had the back of every male cop on the scene and I held my own. Did I not?",
        "Antonio: Uh -- yes, yes. You're right. Okay? You can handle Ramsey.",
        "Talia: It's not like I haven't come across that type before. He's a hatemonger. He burns and scorches everything in his path.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, Bo, what the hell?",
        "Bo: John, when'd you get back?",
        "John: A couple of hours ago -- I just came from the station.",
        "Bo: Oh, and did you see your new boss?",
        "John: He's not my boss -- I will never work for him.",
        "Bo: No, come on, John. Look, the department -- it needs people like you.",
        "John: Hey, look, even if I was arrogant enough to think I could help the department, why would he keep me around, huh? As soon as I'm back on the force, he'll just fire me.",
        "Bo: No, he can't fire you without just cause.",
        "John: He'll come up with something.",
        "Bo: Don't let him. You're a great cop, John. You worked with Ramsey -- I mean, you know all his moves. Stay one step ahead of him.",
        "John: I'll end up killing him first.",
        "Bo: Huh. Look, I need you and the rest of that department to keep an eye on this guy. I'm reaching out to everybody I know right now in Washington, D.C., trying to figure out how this guy went about doing all of this, you know? What card did he play with Lowell?",
        "John: Won't work.",
        "Bo: Well, why not?",
        "John: Well, I just spent two weeks in D.C. trying to dig up something on Ramsey -- I got nothing.",
        "Bo: Classified documents, huh?",
        "John: Or documents that don't exist anymore.",
        "Bo: He's got to have friends in high places and I'll bet you he's got something on every one of them.",
        "John: He didn't get your job on merit and good service, I'll tell you that.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but why this job? This guy goes from F.B.I. to commissioner of police in Llanview, Pennsylvania? What's in it for him?",
        "John: Damned if I know.",
        "Bo: There's got to be more to it than that. It's like I just told Nora in there -- guys like Ramsey, they tend to trip themselves up sooner or later. Now, when that happens, I need you in the department, okay? Antonio, Talia, too, but I need you.",
        "John: Yeah, well, it may have happened already. I may be able to bring someone in that can testify against Ramsey.",
        "Todd: Somebody who? You better not mean who I think you mean.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Hey, Eddie.",
        "Antonio: What's he got you doing with that box?",
        "Eddie: Ramsey's confused me with a sanitation worker.",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah? Well, why don't you let me go through it because I think one of my files might be in there and then I'll throw it back to you when I find it.",
        "Eddie: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: All right?",
        "Talia: Thanks. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Antonio: Cover me.",
        "Talia: Hmm.",

        "Jessica: Ah, no. It might be about Bree.",
        "Nash: Oh!",
        "Jessica: Hello? Oh, hi, Dad -- what's up? Oh, God.",
        "Nash: What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Wow. Where did that come from?",
        "Gigi: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: No, it was like you were --",
        "Gigi: It was a simple question.",
        "Rex: Well, I -- I wish I had a simple answer for you. I'm still trying to put it together, what it was like, what it -- what it is like finding my father after all these years. I'm still kind of all over the map with it.",
        "Gigi: How so?",
        "Rex: Well, when something that you've wanted for so long, something that you've dreamed about, is suddenly there, is real, you -- you go through all these feelings.",
        "Gigi: Like what?",
        "Rex: Uh -- well, you -- you get an incredible sense of -- of a rush, of -- of elation, joy, wonder, awe. And the really weird thing is you just sort of experience the reverse of it, too, and feel let down.",
        "Gigi: Disappointed?",
        "Rex: No -- no, not disappointed. Uh-uh, it just changes things. But I'm still curious as to why you're so interested.",
        "Gigi: Because it's -- it's interesting. Most people would want to know what it's like. There are talk shows about what you're going through.",
        "Rex: You and Charlie get along, don't you?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Rex: You have an argument or anything?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Rex: Are you sure?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I'm sure. Besides, I -- I hardly know the man. I mean, he came into the diner, he was always charming, really sweet to Shane. Speaking of my son, I should get back to him -- never mind pool. He can do an hour of homework.",
        "Rex: Okay. I'll let myself out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Gigi Morasco -- is that who you meant?",
        "Bo: What difference does that make to you, Manning?",
        "Todd: Listen, John, I just passed up the chance of a lifetime, putting your psychopath sister behind bars. And you know why, don't you? Now, look, you want Ramsey out on his ass -- that's fine by me, but not on my back. You understand?",
        "Bo: Manning, Ramsey tried to set you up for attempted murder and now you want to just let him slide?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm over that. Well, okay -- good luck getting Ramsey out. I'm sure a guy like that has plenty of dirt.",
        "John: Listen, everything on this guy's been wiped clean and at a high level. There are contacts that can pull water out of a stone -- they couldn't get anything on him and they probably won't.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's too bad. Oh, well -- not my problem.",
        "Bo: Ramsey's got Manning scared. See why I need you back at the department?",
        "John: I'll think about it.",
        "Bo: Well, don't let me down, John, all right? Look at me -- jeez. This is not about me. It's about the people in this town.",
        "John: Look, I said I'll think about it --",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "John: For you.",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: Ah!",
        "Bo: Hey, Clint. What's up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Court is adjourned.",
        "Michael: What just happened?",
        "Judy: An educated guess? I think the D.A. made a recommendation.",
        "Michael: Nora?",
        "Nora: Yes?",
        "Michael: I don't even know how to thank you.",
        "Nora: Well, you don't thank me -- you thank the judge.",
        "Michael: No, no, no. You could've pressed for more charges against Marcie but you didn't.",
        "Nora: She didn't get off scot-free. She got two years probation, community service. Oh.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I think we can handle that.",
        "Nora: Yes, and you're not allowed to adopt a kid during that time.",
        "Michael: I -- you know, we'll be able to be together, you know, and plan for the future, figure things out? And Marcie will be home with me.",
        "Judy: I strongly recommend you take this deal.",
        "Michael: Uh -- yeah. Judy, thank you so much for everything. Okay. Honey? Let's go home.",
        "Judy: You put your neck on the line, Nora.",
        "Nora: Yeah. Oh, well, like I told Michael, that was the judge.",
        "Judy: Still, the mayor had a lot of pressure on you for this case. New police commissioner won't be happy about it. First day on the job, the man has a D.A. sweetening the defense of a high-profile case.",
        "Nora: Justice was served -- that's all that matters.",
        "Judy: For what it's worth, I hope you keep your job.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nora: Oh. Hi there. I just got your message and I got so anxious to talk to you, I didn't even listen to it -- ha! So, what's going on? Oh, Clint, oh, my God. I'm coming over there right now.",
        "Nora: Hey, Bo, have you heard from Clint?",
        "Bo: Yeah, I just talked to him. I'm going over there.",
        "Nora: Any idea what's going on?",
        "Bo: He wouldn't go into any specifics, but this doesn't sound good.",
        "Nora: Well, I'm going with you.",

        "Nash: What'd your dad want?",
        "Jessica: I have to go to B.E.",
        "Nash: Why?",
        "Jessica: I don't have time to explain now, I'll just tell you later. Can you pick Bree up from Mom's?",
        "Nash: Yes, of course I can.",
        "Jessica: Ugh! Just when things were starting to feel right, huh?",
        "Nash: Hey, it's all right. As long as we have each other and Bree, everything is all right.",
        "Jessica: Bye.",
        "Nash: Bye.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nash: Nash Brennan. No, no, no, no, that's not possible. Yeah, but the guy I just talked to told me the loan was approved. Well, check again. Okay, look, I'm going to have to speak with your supervisor. Well, oh -- there's -- you have no supervisor? Look, you cannot take a loan away from me that was just promised to me -- no, no, no, that's not cool! Put someone on the phone who makes some sense! Damn it, come on! Hello? Smart move, Brennan, pissing off the one person who can help you out.",
        "Nash: Yeah, hi, it's me. I'd like to take you up on your deal -- let's meet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What a day, huh? Heck, you only got probation and I got reinstated at the hospital.",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Michael: For God's sake, Marcie, put them down now! Put those down now! It's over, all right? Do you hear me? It is over -- this misery, this self-pity, these damn silences where you go off into some strange dark place where nobody can reach you -- no more, okay? You have to snap out of this, Marcie, because I'm not going to stand around and watch you feel sorry for yourself!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Then let's make the deal, today. I don't care what it costs -- just get it done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Yeah, we're good, let's go.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Antonio: Hey. Talk to Bo?",
        "John: Yeah, I talked to him.",
        "Ramsey: Carter! Carter, get these boxes out of here! What are you doing here, John? And that's police property and you are not a cop and definitely will not be as long as I'm around.",
        "John: You know what your problem is -- I mean, beyond the obvious?",
        "Ramsey: Hmm?",
        "John: Overconfidence. Tell me something -- do you ever get tired of being wrong? I'm here, Ramsey. I'm not going away.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Michael: Are you going to run away again? Where are you going to go?",
        "Nash: You are going to sell me back my shares to the vineyard.",
        "John: Now that Ramsey's running the place --",
        "Gigi: I know what I'm doing, John.",
        "Nora: I think someone's out to get you guys and it's probably someone you know."
