        "Gigi: So you think there might be a job available?",
        "Markko: I wouldn't know. Uh -- we do get pretty busy, though, especially at lunchtime.",
        "Gigi: Is the owner around?",
        "Markko: Carlotta is out. She should be back pretty soon if you want to hang out.",

        "Gigi: I'm -- looking for a job.",
        "Markko: Hey, Cris? I'm sorry to bug you at home. I'm just wondering -- are you coming in anytime soon? Because I'm getting really weeded here -- that's not even the word. Uh -- \"abrumado, abrumado.\" Anyway, I'll try calling you at Capricorn. I'll see you soon -- I hope. Whew.",

        "[Sarah sighs]",
        "Sarah: Good thing one of us doesn't have a roommate.",
        "Cristian: Hmm. I kind of miss it.",
        "Sarah: You hated it when I was here.",
        "Cristian: Come to think of it --",
        "Sarah: Hey. You're not supposed to agree with me.",
        "Cristian: Would you let me finish?",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "Cristian: I was going to say if you lived here now, then we'd probably never get out of bed.",
        "Sarah: And that's a problem because?",
        "[Sarah laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: They were supposed to be delivered in Bogota last week.",
        "Jared: Never mind, never mind.",
        "Natalie: Honduras?",
        "Jared: Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to run an oil company without any offices.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I'll hold.",
        "Jared: Yeah, I'll hold.",
        "Clint: Natalie? Get me the number of this account, would you?",
        "Natalie: Right. Yeah, I'm still here.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Clint: Hi -- Bo, Nora.",
        "Nora: Hi. What can we do?",
        "Clint: I didn't expect you to be coming over here.",
        "Nora: Well, I'm not leaving, so tell me what I need to do.",
        "Bo: Clint -- hey, what's going on?",
        "Clint: The Colombia project -- I think it's being sabotaged.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh. Why is this thing so damn slow?",
        "Jessica: What's going on?",
        "Natalie: Jess, thank God you're here.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, Dad called me. He sounded really upset.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, yeah, there is this huge, huge problem with the project down in South America and if we have to shut down construction, our stock price will plummet.",
        "Jessica: And Grandpa will roll over in his grave.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, everybody said that about Jared when he came to work here, and now, it looks like he might be the one saving the company.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Natalie: Hey, Phyllis? Can you get these over to my dad?",
        "Phyllis: Sure.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. Yeah, yeah. Actually, Jared was the one who cut through all the crap and figured out that there was a problem if we did not act immediately.",
        "Jessica: Good for him.",
        "Natalie: No snarky remark?",
        "Jessica: Well, no. He saved my life, Natalie. I mean, Nash and I are both looking at him in a whole new light. How could I not be eternally grateful to him, right?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, yeah, I am, too -- I mean, for saving my sister's life.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. How's it going with you two working together?",
        "Natalie: It's fine. I'm over him, okay? I have to be. It's just --",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Natalie: Okay. At the ball, he said the weirdest thing to me. He -- he said something like, well -- that maybe we could be together. We both know that we can't be together.",
        "Jared: What if there was a way?",
        "Jessica: And what did he mean?",
        "Natalie: I wish I knew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: It's over -- do you hear me? The misery, the self-pity, those damned silences where you go off into some strange dark place where nobody can reach you? Okay, you need to snap out of this, Marcie, because I'm not going to stand around and watch you feel sorry for yourself -- not anymore.",
        "Marcie: You -- you give me those photos, Michael. Give me those photos of Tommy!",
        "Michael: These are pictures of Sam!",
        "Marcie: Don't you rip them up!",
        "Michael: His name's Sam!",
        "Marcie: No! No, they are not!",
        "Michael: He's Todd's son, he's not our son!",
        "Marcie: Tommy! He's Tommy!",
        "Michael: Where are you going to go, Marcie? Are you going to run away again? Where are you going to go? Don't you understand that no matter where you go, Tommy will never be there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: What are you doing here, John? And that's police property and you're not a cop and won't be as long as I'm around.",
        "John: You know what your problem is, Ramsey -- I mean, beyond the obvious?",
        "Ramsey: Hmm.",
        "John: Overconfidence. Tell me something -- do you ever get tired of being wrong? I'm here, Ramsey, and I'm not going away.",
        "Ramsey: Where'd you get that, gumball machine?",
        "John: Same place you got yours, for what it's worth.",
        "Ramsey: Whoever's responsible for this is fired.",
        "John: Promise?",
        "Ramsey: Who reinstated John McBain? What?",
        "John: I guess you're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay, well, there's nothing overtly illegal here but, hey, that -- that's a dummy corporation right there. And so is that one. You know what? If you want my amateur opinion, I think someone's out to get you guys and it's probably someone you know or they'd be more out in the open with it.",
        "Bo: Virgil Webster.",
        "Clint: Virgil Webster was one of Pa's closest friends.",
        "Bo: But do you remember what Pa always said -- keep your friends close, keep your enemies even closer? Does old Virgil have holdings near this construction site?",
        "Clint: Yeah, he does.",
        "Nora: Is Virgil Webster -- is that the guy, that big gun that we met down in -- at Asa's ranch that summer?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Yeah, he talked a big game. I got a really bad vibe from him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, are you telling me that Jared was coming on to you.",
        "Natalie: No. Definitely not.",
        "Jessica: Well, then what was he talking about?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I just told you, okay? He didn't -- he didn't -- he never told me what was going on.",
        "Jessica: Oh, because he got sidetracked saving my life?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but you know what? He's had plenty of other chances to tell me and -- and you know what? Ever since Allison went over that balcony, he's been acting differently.",
        "Jessica: Different how?",
        "Natalie: Treating me like --",
        "Jessica: He's your uncle? Good. No?",
        "Natalie: Well --",
        "Jared: Hey, I'm having some problems with the server. Do you think you can pull up those start-up figures for me? Hey, Jess.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Jared: How you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm fine and -- you seem good. You're back at work.",
        "Jared: Yeah, yeah -- you know, a little sore but other than that -- and how about that crazy lady that tried to kill you?",
        "Jessica: Well, she's in a coma and she's probably never going to wake up. And as much as I don't wish that horrible fate on anybody, I just -- you know, I don't care. I mean, I -- I don't want to believe her lies anymore and I'm just trying to get on with my life. You know, I have Nash and Bree and we're really happy and, you know, everything's going our way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Well, thank you so much for meeting me on such short notice.",
        "Man: I'm glad you decided to reconsider our offer.",
        "Nash: Hey, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You're applying for a job, here?",
        "Gigi: Why not? I am a waitress.",
        "Rex: No, I -- I just meant that you're serious about staying in Llanview?",
        "Gigi: I told you I was -- nothing against Texas.",
        "Rex: Well, they say everything's bigger down there.",
        "Gigi: Eh, bigger isn't everything -- trust me. Plus, I like the idea of raising Shane here -- four seasons, the snow and all like we grew up. I didn't realize how much I missed it until I came back north.",
        "Rex: Oh, I bet Shane loves living in that mansion, right?",
        "Gigi: What's not to love -- movies on demand, game room, and a maid whose name isn't \"mom.\" But everybody's fantasy has got to end sometime.",
        "Rex: What do you mean?",
        "Gigi: Well, we're moving out as soon as I can get together a security deposit.",
        "Rex: Well, you know, a higher-end restaurant would -- would bring in bigger tips. I -- I know this club --",
        "Gigi: No, I can't work nights. I have to be home when Shane gets back from school.",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "Gigi: Plus, I need health benefits and in the restaurant business, those are pretty rare.",
        "Rex: Well, does it have to be waitressing? I remember you took all these business courses in high school. Weren't you, like, southern Michigan's fastest typist?",
        "Gigi: In the under-16 category, first runner-up -- ahem. But I never actually worked in an office -- I could never find a desk job in Paris that paid better than the Bon-Jour. Plus, I walked away with cash every day and you kind of get used to that.",
        "Rex: I know Carlotta -- I could put in a word for you if you --",
        "Gigi: No, thanks.",
        "Rex: Oh, I -- wouldn't hurt.",
        "Gigi: I said no. Never needed your help before and I sure as hell don't need it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Tommy became our son the moment that we adopted him, Michael. Biology doesn't change that, okay? Nothing can change that!",
        "Michael: But the courts just handed him over to his biological father -- Todd. We have to find a way to get on with our lives, Marcie. I am trying to do that, but I need to know if I'm going to be able to do it with you or without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: I never told anyone you could be reinstated.",
        "John: Is that your signature? Came in a few hours ago, signed, sealed, delivered.",
        "Ramsey: No, the only thing I signed was -- a bunch of requisition forms.",
        "John: Hmm. Incompetence starts at the top. You know, the former commissioner -- he never would've signed anything without reading it first.",
        "Ramsey: Hmm, well, this can be undone very easily. Now you can give me your badge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Sarah: Mine or yours?",
        "Cristian: Mine's off.",
        "Sarah: Oh. Sorry. Guess I forgot to turn it off.",
        "Cristian: You're not going to answer it, are you?",
        "Sarah: No, I'm going to turn it off. Oh -- it's my grandfather.",
        "Cristian: All right. Go get it -- I mean, family first, right?",
        "Sarah: Thank you. Hello?",
        "Clint: Sarah, did I catch you in the middle of something?",
        "Sarah: Um -- huh -- sort of.",
        "Clint: Well, I need you to come down to B.E. right away.",
        "Sarah: Right now?",
        "Clint: Right now.",
        "Sarah: Is -- is there a problem?",
        "Clint: Emergency board meeting.",
        "Sarah: Okay, I'll be right there. I so should not have answered that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Jessica, I think it's really incredible that, you know \u0096",
        "Phyllis: Jared?",
        "Jared: Yeah?",
        "Phyllis: I have Adam Cohen on line two for you.",
        "Jared: Again? Uh -- excuse me, ladies.",
        "Natalie: It's ironic, isn't it? How you figured out that you're wrong about Jared now that nothing can happen between the two of us?",
        "Jessica: Well, how is it really going, you two working together?",
        "Natalie: It's fine, it's no big deal -- so how are you doing? Really, how are you doing? Is Nash still mad at you?",
        "Jessica: No, no, he's not mad at me anymore. He's finally forgiven me for the whole Allison fiasco.",
        "Natalie: That's great. I'm not so sure that I've forgiven him yet for having you committed to St. Ann's, by the way.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Natalie, you know he did that because he loves me.",
        "Natalie: Isn't that why he does everything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Well, your offer -- it sounds incredible.",
        "Man: I've had my eye on your vineyard for a long time.",
        "Nash: And your investors -- they really take no interest as to the specifics of how I'm going to run my business?",
        "Man: As long as you turn a profit, it's all about the bottom line. And if you want to buy us out again in five years, no problem.",
        "Nash: Well, that's exactly what I wanted to hear. Just one more question.",
        "Man: Go ahead.",
        "Nash: Why does your offer sound too good to be true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Natalie: Get anywhere with Mr. Cohen?",
        "Jared: Maybe. Listen, can I dock my P.D.A. on your work station and download your contacts?",
        "Natalie: Sure.",
        "Jessica: Well, um, I'm going to go and find Dad, tell him that I'm here and start reading like a crazy person so I'm well-versed when I have to vote.",
        "[P.D.A. beeps]",
        "Jared: Here.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. You realize that you have zero contacts in your address book?",
        "Jared: Yes -- I lost them all when the server went down.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "Jared: Well, I'm going to go get you those notes on the conversation I had with the distributors.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- Jared?",
        "Jared: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: Your P.D.A.",
        "Jared: Right.",
        "[Jared taps desk]",
        "Jared: Thank you.",
        "Natalie: Is everything okay?",
        "Jared: Yeah, besides the fact that the company's about to tank? Uh-huh.",
        "Natalie: I meant between the two of us.",
        "Jared: Yeah, I think we're working well together -- don't you?",
        "Natalie: Sure.",
        "Jared: Cool. Thanks for the info. Natalie --",
        "Natalie: I don't -- I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Jared: I don't, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We just came from a courtroom where you got community service for kidnapping a child and holding a good friend hostage at good point. Do you know what that is?",
        "Marcie: It's a travesty.",
        "Michael: It is a miracle! We were all prepared for you to go to jail! This is everything I could've hoped for.",
        "Marcie: Everything?",
        "Michael: This is everything I could've hoped for. I wanted to come back here and to celebrate, to thank God that we don't have to be separated. We can have a wonderful life together.",
        "Marcie: A life without Tommy? How is that possible, Michael?",
        "Michael: We had a life before Tommy, right? And as I recall, it was a pretty darn good one.",
        "Marcie: Yes, but, Michael, everything has --",
        "Michael: You made a decision to run away with Todd's son, okay? You've been given a second chance, but are you grateful for your freedom? Are you happy that we can still be together? No, you are sad, you are miserable, just like you have been ever since you got back here -- you know, like you're at a funeral. I've got good news for you, Marcie -- nobody died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You can't have it. Badge must remain on my person at all times while I'm on duty, Sir.",
        "Ramsey: Well, I'm relieving you of your duty.",
        "John: My duty is to lock up guys like you whose gross negligence cost an innocent woman her life.",
        "Ramsey: That death was an accident.",
        "John: No, it wasn't.",
        "Ramsey: Oh, oh. Oh, okay. Well, I could lock you up. Or I could open up the Miles Laurence case, lock up Cole for that shooting, too -- what about it?",
        "John: This is a police department, Ramsey. There's certain procedure we follow around here.",
        "Ramsey: Because you always walk the straight and narrow.",
        "John: Watch me.",
        "[Ramsey chuckles]",
        "Ramsey: Huh.",
        "Officer: Lieutenant -- are you really back?",
        "John: Yeah, thanks, Lin. News travel fast.",
        "Ofc. Lin: Yeah. A bunch of guys were getting ready to turn in their resignation but if you're our supervisor again -- hallelujah.",
        "John: Hey, you just miss me at the Monday night poker games.",
        "Ofc. Lin: You still owe me a five spot.",
        "John: Yeah, check's in the mail.",
        "Ramsey: You \u0096",
        "Ofc. Lin: It's Lin, Sir.",
        "Ramsey: Didn't I ask you for the file case on Allison Perkins?",
        "John: No trouble remembering her name.",
        "Ramsey: It's my case -- although whoever broke her out of St. Ann's came under the former commissioner.",
        "John: But her swan dive off that balcony kind of -- kind of stole the limelight from you, didn't it, Ramsey?",
        "Ramsey: The file?",
        "Ofc. Lin: Maybe you asked someone else.",
        "Ramsey: Go away.",
        "John: Well, by the look on your face, I can tell you talked to I.A. So, you're stuck with me until you can find due process to get me out of here, which will never happen.",
        "Ramsey: Well, we'll see. In the meantime, I want you right here 24/7. And those will be your working hours.",
        "John: Dish it out, Ramsey. Whatever you got, I can handle it.",
        "[Ramsey chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Did I say you couldn't take care of yourself? I was there when you beat up Danny Ruggles in sixth grade.",
        "Gigi: Don't you dare tell Shane about that -- I'll never hear the end of it.",
        "Rex: I won't say a word about you to anyone in town -- how's that?",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jump down your throat. I just hate feeling like I'm depending on Viki, or anyone else for that matter, to take care of Shane and me.",
        "Rex: Which is why I thought you'd go back to Texas where you had a life and a job, there was no Ramsey.",
        "Gigi: Are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "Rex: Never. So, how'd you wind up in Texas -- is that where Shane's dad's from?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Rex: Uh -- so, you were stationed there?",
        "Gigi: Ever heard of any landlocked naval bases, Balsom? No wonder you're not making any money as a P.I.",
        "Rex: I'm not playing detective here. I've got 10 years to catch up on. I can't believe you're a mom.",
        "Gigi: Hard to believe I ever wasn't. Shane's the best thing I ever did. Of course, I can only take credit for half of his genes.",
        "Rex: But you raised him -- he's terrific.",
        "Gigi: You hardly know him. But you're right -- he is terrific.",
        "Rex: Look, I know you had a lot of friends in Texas that you could count on to lend you a hand. So, if I offer to baby-sit Shane, it is not because I don't think you can't take care of yourself. Besides, I'm always looking for an excuse to play video games.",
        "Gigi: I know.",
        "Rex: I just want you to know that you have a friend in Llanview that you can count on -- this time. Hey, I'm good with kids since I still pretty much am one.",
        "Gigi: I noticed -- ahem. And Shane really likes you, so thank you. But I don't want to piss off your fianc\u00e9e any more than I already have.",
        "Rex: No, you haven't pissed --",
        "[Phone rings]",
