        "John: Okay, how about this? Did you ever see Allison when it wasn't your purpose to visit Jessica?",
        "Natalie: What do you mean?",
        "John: You're a bright girl. I think you know exactly what I'm asking.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- whew -- gosh -- um -- I got to think about it. Um --",
        "John: I knew it. So when was it, Natalie? When exactly did you see Allison Perkins?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Yes or no? Did you help Allison Perkins escape?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't care how soft the market is, we're not talking about a hovel. It's a penthouse. That's fine. Whatever it takes to unload it. All right.",
        "Dorian: Are you planning on selling your penthouse?",
        "Todd: Yeah, Dorian, you want to buy it?",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "Todd: You can give it a fancy French name for all I care.",
        "Dorian: Huh -- I hope you're not planning to move into La Boulaie permanently, and -- why does my house look like Waikiki?",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: No, don't worry about it. Your -- your precious home is not going Hawaiian. I am -- and so are Blair and the kids. We're all moving there. We are dumping this town and dumping you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hawaii?",
        "Blair: Yeah. He's already started packing.",
        "Viki: So that he can buy a newspaper chain?",
        "Blair: In Maui -- so he claims.",
        "Viki: But why?",
        "Blair: I don't --",
        "Viki: I mean, \"The Sun\" is doing so well. It's lucrative and, oddly enough, influential.",
        "Blair: Well, he says that he wants a new challenge. But I can't think of any reason that would take him that far away from Llanview.",
        "Viki: This doesn't make any sense, you know.",
        "Blair: I know. That's why I want you to talk to him. You talk some sense into him. You're the only person who can, Viki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: How much longer are you going to be there?",
        "Sarah: It could be all night.",
        "Nora: Oh, what about these?",
        "Sarah: Everyone's kind of in panic mode. I'm really trying to get into it, you know, get a fix on what's going on. You did encourage me to.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I'm starting to regret it. I miss you like crazy.",
        "Sarah: I miss you, too.",
        "Clint: Hey, listen, you better come up with some answers, all right?",
        "Sarah: Uh -- Cris, I better call you back. My grandpa's going ballistic.",
        "Clint: What the hell -- listen, I know that Virgil Webster is behind this slowdown, all right? So you tell that conniving son of a --",
        "Bo: I'll talk to you later.",
        "Clint: You tell Mr. Webster to back off or there's going to be hell to pay.",
        "[Lindsay knocks on door]",
        "Lindsay: Hi.",
        "Bo: Hey, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Huh. Uh -- everything okay?",
        "Bo: Well, we're working on it, you know.",
        "Lindsay: I'm sorry to barge in. It's just that you left this at home.",
        "Bo: Oh, and I needed this, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Huh.",
        "Bo: You're a lifesaver. Thank you.",
        "Jared: All right, I got some figures. It's a per-hour cost of the breakdown.",
        "Clint: Good God.",
        "Bo: Do you have the start-up figures?",
        "Clint: Natalie was supposed to be getting those for us. Jared, any idea where she is?",
        "Jared: Uh \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, last time I saw Allison -- well, it's -- it's kind of blurred, you know? It was definitely a -- a while ago, wasn't pleasant at all. I think I blocked it out of my memory.",
        "John: No, you didn't.",
        "Natalie: I beg your pardon?",
        "John: Give me a little credit here, all right? I've always known when you were hiding something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How can you ask me that? Help Allison escape from St. Ann's after all that she's put my family through?",
        "Antonio: We have a witness who saw two young women dressed as nuns help Allison escape from St. Ann's. Now, that witness is going to be able to identify those two young women -- not to mention the other person who can testify.",
        "Jessica: What? Who?",
        "Antonio: Allison, when she wakes up.",
        "Jessica: If she wakes up. And until that happens, you really have no proof, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm sorry, I got to take this.",
        "Nash: Excuse me. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Viki: No, you didn't. She had a phone call to make.",
        "Nash: Oh. I just wanted to thank you for taking care of Bree.",
        "Viki: Are you kidding? My pleasure. I was happy to do it.",
        "Nash: Where is she?",
        "Viki: She's at my house with Lois.",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Viki: I actually put her to bed because she was very tired and fell asleep. And if you don't mind, she could spend the night, you know, and you could pick her up tomorrow?",
        "Nash: Yeah, are you sure?",
        "Viki: Yeah, I'm positive, and then I can have breakfast with her.",
        "Nash: Fantastic. Then I will pick her up after breakfast.",
        "Viki: Good, good. How's Jess?",
        "Nash: She's doing good, trying to put this whole Allison thing behind her.",
        "Viki: Yeah, the sooner, the better on that.",
        "Nash: Yeah. And I am going to do my best to protect her better in the future, make sure this never happens. Uh -- excuse me. The gentleman I'm here to meet just -- just turned up. Hey. Thanks for meeting me on such short notice.",
        "Man: I was surprised to get your call. I assume you've reached an agreement with Mr. Buchanan?",
        "Nash: Yes, my partner came around a lot easier than I thought -- soon to be ex-partner.",
        "Man: Excellent. As discussed, the backers are going to give you the money to buy him out. All we need is his signature, and it's a done deal.",
        "Nash: I'm on it.",
        "Man: We're looking forward to working with you.",
        "Nash: Oh, you won't regret it. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Thanks again for bringing this, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, it's the least I could do. But, hey, you get back to work because I can see things are pretty hectic.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, this Columbia project is turning into a scheduling nightmare.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, go -- go do what you have to do.",
        "Bo: Okay. I'll see you later.",
        "Lindsay: All right. Oh, Bo --",
        "Bo: Hmm?",
        "Lindsay: Um -- is there anything I can do?",
        "Bo: Not that I can think of offhand.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I'm going to hang around for a little while in case you think of something. And here's what I'm really good at -- phone, filing, and just about anything else.",
        "Bo: All right, then I'll let you know.",
        "Lindsay: Okay.",
        "Nora: Busy, Lindsay, very busy.",
        "Lindsay: With what? This isn't exactly district attorney jurisdiction, is it?",
        "Nora: The legal counsel for B.E. is out of the country so I'm helping Clint and Bo avoid an urgent crisis. And since all you're capable of is faking the occasional nervous breakdown, you should probably go.",
        "Lindsay: Wow. Look at those frown lines. Hmm. They just keep getting deeper and deeper. I guess that's the price that you have to pay for being bitter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Whew. Getting a pretty bad feeling here.",
        "Jared: Yeah. If we don't get this Columbia project up and running by midnight, B.E.'s on course to take a major hit.",
        "Sarah: How did this happen?",
        "Jared: Well, it's simple, really -- sabotage. Ever since Asa died, the sharks have been circling. His enemies want to take this place apart piece by piece, and if we don't stop him, there's going to be nothing left. It's the family legacy we're talking about.",
        "Sarah: We Buchanans got to stick together, right?",
        "Jared: Right.",
        "Clint: Well, why are you confusing the issue? It seems very simple to me. I -- what? Never mind, I'll figure it out myself. These incompetent people -- how do they manage to keep their jobs?",
        "Nora: Clint, honey, maybe you should think about just cutting your losses.",
        "Clint: Are you out of your mind? I'm not going to let these bastards get what they want.",
        "Nora: All I meant was that maybe --",
        "Clint: I don't care what you meant, Nora. I am not going to back off, all right now, where is everybody? I need Jessica and Natalie. Jared, I need those numbers.",
        "Jared: Oh -- uh -- I'll find them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You're hoping Allison doesn't come out of that coma.",
        "Jessica: As long as she doesn't come after my family, I could care less one way or another.",
        "Antonio: But you'd obviously prefer that she not be able to offer any proof of what happened that night.",
        "Jessica: I prefer to be safe, okay? The woman tried to kill me!",
        "Antonio: Which is why whoever helped her escape committed a serious crime. And if that was you, Jessica -- if you had anything at all to do with it, your uncle is not going to be able to help you! Lee Ramsey is commissioner, and he is out for blood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: This is serious, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Then stop wasting time and go find those nuns.",
        "John: Don't do this to me.",
        "Natalie: What am I doing? I'm not the one who has to be badgered her",
        "John: Who's badgering you?",
        "Natalie: You know what? You -- you want me to be guilty. That's -- that's what this is.",
        "John: Look, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Natalie: Are you enjoying yourself, John?",
        "John: Did you break this woman out of St. Ann's?",
        "Jared: What's going on in here?",
        "Natalie: I've told you everything I know.",
        "John: No -- you've told me nothing but a pack of lies.",
        "Jared: Hey! Leave her alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, hey. I want the jet on standby -- yeah, Maui. We go when I say we go. All right.",
        "Dorian: Whoo-hoo! You cannot be serious about this.",
        "Todd: No, I'm serious. In fact, I better start packing.",
        "Dorian: But -- wait, wait, wait. Todd, have -- have -- ahem -- have Blair and the children agreed to it?",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. We're on our way, Dorian, and that's all you need to know.",
        "Dorian: But they must be horrified -- especially Starr, having to leave her friends, Langston and -- and Cole. But she'll be devastated.",
        "Todd: She'll make new friends.",
        "Dorian: How can you be so shallow? Why, Langston is more like a -- a sister to her than a friend. And Cole -- well, for heaven's sake, she's in love with that boy.",
        "Todd: I don't want to hear that, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute, Todd. If you think that I am going to be happy having this big, huge house all to myself with just me and Langston, well, you're wrong. I like having you here.",
        "Todd: No kidding -- me?",
        "Dorian: No, not you --",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Dorian: But it has been bearable.",
        "Todd: Not for me. I can't wait to get the hell out of this place.",
        "Dorian: But why Hawaii? It's so far away. And, Todd, what will you do there?",
        "Todd: Same thing you do here, only with a Hawaiian shirt on.",
        "Dorian: Oh, stop it. There is much more to this than you're letting on. Now, you're going to tell me what it is, Todd, and I mean right this minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Have you told Todd that you don't want to move?",
        "Blair: Not yet. But Starr made it very clear how unhappy she was. I mean, she's freaking out.",
        "Viki: Okay, I don't get this. Todd's family means everything to him. So why would he want to uproot you all like this? I mean, why would he want to do something that makes all of you so unhappy?",
        "Blair: Well, I think that's the problem.",
        "Viki: What do you mean?",
        "Blair: Well, because we do mean everything to Todd.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Blair: I think he wants to protect us.",
        "Viki: From what?",
        "Blair: The new police commissioner, Lee Ramsey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Ms. Allison Perkins. What happened to you? You were once hell on wheels, turning people's lives upside down -- Viki Davidson, the Buchanan twins. Your file reads like a crime novel. What I wouldn't give to get a look inside that brain-dead head of yours.",
        "Michael: What are you doing in here?",
        "Ramsey: Doctor. You're back at work -- I'm not surprised. Your transgressions were small compared to your kidnapper wife.",
        "Michael: I need to check on the patient.",
        "Ramsey: Doctor, I've had a rough start here as commissioner. Among other things, you d your wife getting away with what you did, this lady stealing thunder at the ball --",
        "Michael: What the hell is the matter with you? This woman's lying here on the verge of death, and you're worried about your thunder being stolen?",
        "Ramsey: What I worry about is finding out who broke her out of St. Ann's. How long is she going to be like this?",
        "Michael: Maybe forever.",
        "Ramsey: That's bad. Well, there's more than one way to get answers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: What do you want from her, huh?",
        "John: Oh, I want lots of things from her, but none of it is your business.",
        "Natalie: Okay, Jared, can handle this.",
        "Jared: You leave her alone, you understand me?",
        "John: This is my job. All right? You don't want to get charged with hindering a police investigation.",
        "Jared: What, you think just because you went to bed with her, you can yell at her now? Is that your M.O.?",
        "John: I'm not sure what that means, but I'm losing my patience. I think you should shut your face.",
        "Jared: You're just a bully with a badge, you know that? Now, you get out of here before I escort you out of here.",
        "John: Bring it on, tough guy.",
        "Natalie: Okay, guys, please. Stop. It's all right, Jared.",
        "Jared: No, it's not all right. Who does this punk think he is? Is this how you treat someone that you once cared about?",
        "Natalie: Okay -- I'm serious.",
        "John: Get him out of here.",
        "Natalie: I'm serious, I'm serious. I need you to calm down, okay?",
        "Jared: I'm not leaving you alone with that guy.",
        "Natalie: Yes, you are. John's not going to hurt me. I'm fine. In fact, why don't you go down and take these postconstruction reports to my dad, okay? I have them right here. I'm fine, Jared.",
        "Jared: Call me if you need me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You can't come to dinner, dinner comes to you.",
        "Sarah: That is so sweet.",
        "Cristian: You can take a break, can't you?",
        "Sarah: Not for long. What about you? You're not going to get in trouble for leaving the diner?",
        "Cristian: I'm the boss' son.",
        "Sarah: Ooh.",
        "Cristian: But I can think of a few ways to make trouble for you.",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "[Fax machine whirs]",
        "Sarah: Maybe this isn't the best place to have -- dinner. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Where were you on February 7 between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?",
        "Jessica: I'm not sure.",
        "Antonio: All right, so you don't have an alibi?",
        "Jessica: Who said that?",
        "Antonio: You just did, Jessica. You said you weren't sure where you were.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'm not sure. Do you remember where you were every minute of every day? Well, I was probably with Bree -- which reminds me, I have to call her before she goes to sleep.",
        "Antonio: The call can wait.",
        "Jessica: No, it can't. She'll be asleep.",
        "Antonio: Jessica, don't do this.",
        "Jessica: Don't do what, care about my daughter? Well, you like to call Jamie and say good night -- which reminds me, where is she? Is she with Carlotta?",
        "Antonio: No.",
        "Jessica: Well, is she with your new friend? Talia, right?",
        "Antonio: You just don't get it, do you?",
        "Jessica: Well, you're dating again. I think that's great and she seems really nice.",
        "Antonio: That's not what I meant. You just don't get that what you're doing only makes you look guilty. My advice? Get yourself a lawyer.",
        "Jessica: I don't need a lawyer. Allison Perkins put my family through hell and she would've killed me if Jared hadn't have been there.",
        "Antonio: And maybe a judge and jury will take that into consideration.",
        "Jessica: It sounds like you're building up a case against me.",
        "Antonio: Damn it, Jess. If those police sketches come back looking like you or if Allison wakes up from her coma and IDs you, you can be looking at a long stretch in Statesville prison!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: What does this have to do with Ramsey?",
        "Blair: It has everything to do with Ramsey.",
        "Viki: Why? Is he threatening Todd or you?",
        "Blair: I just can't think of any other reason why Todd would want to move so far away.",
        "Viki: Yeah, because it's unlike him to want to run away.",
        "Blair: Yeah. It's more like him to say he wanted to kill Ramsey, but see, Todd has changed. He told me that now he feels like he's wanted and he's needed and does not want to do anything that's going to pull him away from his family.",
        "Viki: So he chooses to solve this by running away from the threat -- I mean, far away.",
        "Blair: That's why I really need you to talk to him. Talk some sense into him. Oh, I don't know -- well, maybe he'll convince you that he is right. Maybe he does need to move his family far away from that psycho Ramsey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There you go.",
        "Dorian: What's that for?",
        "Todd: Room and board.",
        "Dorian: Oh, Todd -- I don't want your money, I want you to come to your senses.",
        "Todd: Hmm. Aloha, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Wait! You are not going to Hawaii or anyplace else, not with Blair and the children. You want to go by yourself? Fine, go! But you're not taking Blair and the kids away from here, do you understand me? I will talk to her -- because you probably bullied her into it and I won't allow it!",
        "Todd: You'll not only allow it, you'll give us your blessing. You understand? Now, you stay the hell away from me and out of our business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Hey, I was just about to leave. I wanted to see how everything's going.",
        "Bo: Not sure it could get any worse.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Bo: Oh, excuse me.",
        "Lindsay: Oh.",
        "Bo: Huh -- hello? I'm going to have to run it by Clint.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I think it's a blessing in disguise that Bo is here to help save the family business.",
        "Nora: Trying to make yourself feel better, Lindsay? Bo lost his job because of you and your manipulations, but by all means, go ahead -- put a positive spin on it.",
        "Lindsay: Did it ever occur to you at he may very well thrive being at Buchanan Enterprises?",
        "Nora: And if you believe that, you don't know Bo at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Where is everybody?",
        "Sarah: I don't know. I just got this from accounting.",
        "Clint: Have you seen Jared? I sent him out to find Natalie and he disappears. Now we have three Buchanans missing in action.",
        "Sarah: Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Are you trying to scare me? Is that what you're doing?",
        "Antonio: I'm only doing my job.",
        "Jessica: Well, you're harassing me, Antonio. You keep on asking me the same question over and over.",
        "Antonio: Because I need answers! Now, a dangerous woman -- a convicted felon -- escaped from a mental institution. And it's my responsibility to find out how that happened!",
        "Jessica: And it's your distinct pleasure to intimidate me while you find that out, huh? Is it because I hurt you? Is that what this is about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: All right, just sign on the dotted line, you're a wealthy man.",
        "Jared: Yeah, save the sales pitch. I already told you I'd do it.",
        "Nash: Yes, you did, and I'm grateful.",
        "Jared: Well, I didn't do it for you; I did it for Jessica and the family. Whew, done.",
        "Nash: Great.",
