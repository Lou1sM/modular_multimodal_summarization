        "Brody: I didn't think this place had a liquor license.",
        "Roxy: That's why I didn't ask for a glass. You going to arrest me?",
        "Brody: I'd rather join you.",
        "Roxy: So you want a seat or a shot?",
        "Brody: How about both?",
        "Roxy: What are you trying to drown? Isn't Jessica getting better?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Whoa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: This is not happening.",
        "Ford: No?",
        "Langston: No. Because you think we're gonna end up in bed together, but forget it. Seriously.",
        "Ford: So wait. Last night--",
        "Langston: Was just a huge mistake, okay? And if I had known that you lied your way into my apartment, I wouldn't have even let you through the door.",
        "Ford: Lie is a little harsh for what I was doing.",
        "Langston: I would never risk what I have with Markko for sex with you. I should be at my mother's.",
        "Ford: Fine, then. Go.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Ford: You're a good girl. You've got your mother, your boyfriend, all your rules. Everything is all nice and neat. Don't you want to see what it's like to be free, to explore your wild side?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andrew: I'm afraid I have some bad news.",
        "Dorian: What is it? Oh! Is it Cassie? What's happened to her? Where's Cassie?!",
        "Dorian: It's Mitch Laurence, isn't it? He found a way, even from prison. He found a way!",
        "Andrew: I just got the call.",
        "Dorian: Tell me, Andrew! Is Cassie dead? Is it her plane? Did it go down?",
        "Cassie: As soon as we get the details, we'll call mother.",
        "Dorian: Oh!",
        "Blair: How are you?",
        "Dorian: Sweetheart! Oh, goodness, are you all right?",
        "Cassie: Yes, I am okay.",
        "Dorian: You scared me.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. I hope that this is the end of Dorian's freaking out.",
        "Starr: No kidding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Hannah: I got your message that you couldn't come out to work, so I came here.",
        "Cole: Okay. Come on in. How'd you even find me?",
        "Hannah: The class contact list. Is this okay? I really don't want to get behind on the project.",
        "Cole: No, no. It's fine.",
        "Hannah: Why are you in quarantine anyway?",
        "Cole: It's not exactly that, but--",
        "[Hope crying]",
        "Hannah: Is that a baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I'm not afraid of my wild side, but there's wild and then there's stupid, and you were just a stupid mistake. I should have known as soon as you took your shirt off.",
        "Ford: You didn't seem to mind last night.",
        "Langston: Please. It was incredibly cheesy.",
        "Ford: It was, but it worked. You wanted me, Langston.",
        "Langston: I was frustrated with my writing project. I was just procrastinating.",
        "Ford: Really? It seemed to me that you wanted to make love to me to forget about your writing.",
        "Langston: Okay, first of all, it would not be making love, because I don't love you, so get that through your thick skull. I love my boyfriend, and you're just a bad distraction, but that's done.",
        "Ford: Because you've found the one guy you're gonna spend the rest of your life with. That's sweet. No, seriously, it's a fairy tale.",
        "Langston: It's real. I love Markko.",
        "Ford: Sure you do, but you hide behind him, and that's a shame.",
        "Langston: Oh, because you can't get in my pants?",
        "Ford: No, because you'll miss your own life.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Ford: You've cut yourself off from a world of experience, all in the name of love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Whoa. Whoa, Jess, what was that?",
        "Jessica: Well, that's how I feel. Do you remember high school?",
        "Cristian: Uh, yeah, I guess.",
        "Jessica: Because it's the last thing that I remember.",
        "Cristian: What do you mean, it's the last thing you remember? What happened?",
        "Jessica: Well, this guy, he gave me these shock treatments, and then all this time went by, and I don't remember any of it.",
        "Cristian: Wow. High school?",
        "Jessica: I know it's not right, but I really, really wish that it was.",
        "Cristian: Jess, it's 13 years later.",
        "Jessica: I know, and this guy told me that I'm in love with him. Brody?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah, I know him. He's a really good guy.",
        "Jessica: And then he dropped by all these pictures because I guess he thought that it would help me care, at least remember that I cared, but the only person I recognize, the only person I love, is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Oh, my God. Ha ha ho! Allison Perkins. So nice to see you on your feet again.",
        "Allison: Nice to be at your service again.",
        "Mitch: You were my first and my most loyal.",
        "Allison: That's all I want, messenger--to fulfill your mission. I have good news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Cassie, Cassie, Cassie. Just let me look at you.",
        "Cassie: I promise you I'm fine.",
        "Dorian: Oh! Andrew, Andrew, you scared me to death. You know that Mitch Laurence said that he would hurt one of my girls, and when you said there was bad news--",
        "Andrew: I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Don't be mad. Don't be mad at Andrew.",
        "Dorian: Okay. How can I get mad at anybody? I've got all my girls here! All of them. Yeah, and Langston is on her way.",
        "Cassie: But someone else isn't.",
        "Dorian: What do you mean?",
        "Cassie: Mother, I have some really bad news. There's been a death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I could use some good news. Tell me my daughter has recovered.",
        "Allison: Jessica is still in the hospital. She's recovering from her surgery.",
        "Mitch: Have her memories returned?",
        "Allison: That's harder to know for sure.",
        "Mitch: Does she remember me? Allison, I trust you haven't forgotten how much I hated when people lie to me.",
        "Allison: Jessica doesn't remember you. All her recent memories are gone.",
        "Mitch: That is not good news.",
        "Allison: But that's not what I came to tell you. A Cramer woman is dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, no! Is it Langston?",
        "Starr: Did something happen to her?",
        "Dorian: Is it?",
        "Cassie: No, mother, it isn't Langston.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You've obviously never been in love, have you? It's not about missing out on life.",
        "Ford: It's certainly safe.",
        "Langston: I wouldn't say that either.",
        "Ford: Come on. Markko would never hurt you.",
        "Langston: No, he wouldn't.",
        "Ford: That's the thing. You'll always know exactly what you're gonna get with him. I mean, I bet you guys can even finish each other's sentences.",
        "Langston: We know each other really well.",
        "Ford: But doesn't it bother you that you're already like an old married couple?",
        "Langston: That is not us.",
        "Ford: No? I mean, don't you want to explore? Don't you want to get out of your comfort zone?",
        "Langston: I do that all the time. You obviously don't know me if you think I'm all--",
        "Ford: Repressed, tied down, safe? Langston, I'm telling you what I see. Now, I can feel a real spirit inside you, a wild, adventurous soul, but you've put her in this cage, and it breaks my heart. Like, every time I kiss you--",
        "Langston: Forget that.",
        "Ford: No, I can't, okay? That first party, I could feel you were dying to break free.",
        "Langston: Well, it's not gonna happen.",
        "Ford: All right, then instead of having an 18th birthday, you should have a funeral.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Who is it? Who's dead?",
        "Cassie: I'm so sorry, Mother. It's your sister.",
        "Blair: Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I guess my question is, why?",
        "Langston: Why what?",
        "Ford: Was it your parents?",
        "Langston: Don't talk about them.",
        "Ford: No, no, no. Did they make you scared?",
        "Langston: No. My parents were never afraid of anything in their lives. You think I don't know about life on the edge? They lived it.",
        "Ford: They left you behind.",
        "Langston: They didn't want to, okay? It was just the way it had to be. And besides, that has nothing to do with--",
        "Ford: With why you feel safer at home or why you're scared to be left?",
        "Langston: Guess I never thought about it like that. I always took care of myself, so when they were gone, I just kept on going like nothing had changed.",
        "Ford: What do you mean?",
        "Langston: I mean, I stayed in the house. I signed the checks in my parents' name. I kept the house together, went to school.",
        "Ford: You lived completely alone?",
        "Langston: It was easier than you'd think.",
        "Ford: What was the hardest part?",
        "Langston: Dinner. I mean, I had enough money, and I found a market that would deliver, but, um, I had no idea what to buy. I ordered a whole bunch of stuff the first time, but then I realized it was just me, so I, uh, called up the soup kitchen the next day, and they came and took everything, and after that, I'd just get take-out after school every day. The cabinets stayed empty. I think that's probably why I love Dorian's kitchen almost as much as I loved Starr at first. It was always full and noisy. There was always people, food, smells, talking, yelling. I would have stayed in that kitchen for a whole year if I could have.",
        "Ford: But you fell through the cracks.",
        "Langston: I almost did, till Dorian figured out what I was doing. I don't know where I'd be without her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Sorry about that.",
        "Hannah: It's okay. Are you a manny?",
        "Cole: No, not a manny, a dad.",
        "Hannah: Stop. You have a kid?",
        "Cole: She's 16 months old. Her name is Hope.",
        "Hannah: That's amazing. Is her mother the high-school girl I met?",
        "Cole: Starr? Yeah.",
        "Hannah: Are you two married?",
        "Cole: Not yet, but she lives here with me. We're raising Hope together.",
        "Hannah: That's intense.",
        "Cole: Oh, yeah, some days, but mostly it's just life. She had a thing with her family, so--and Hope wasn't feeling well, so I just stayed here to watch her.",
        "Hannah: Wow. So no hanging out at the union or practicing keg stands on the quad, huh?",
        "Cole: Not my thing, no. What?",
        "Hannah: Do you ever feel like you're missing out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Wow, Jess, you must be so scared.",
        "Jessica: It's more lonely.",
        "Cristian: Do you feel trapped?",
        "Jessica: Only when people talk to me. The rest of the time, I'm waiting for us to go out on a date or thinking about what I'm gonna study in school.",
        "Cristian: Does anyone look older to you? I know I look older.",
        "Jessica: No. I mean, I knew you the second I saw you. You look just like I thought you would look.",
        "Cristian: You thought of me as an old man?",
        "Jessica: I think about us being together forever, so yes, I see your face.",
        "Cristian: Well, what about you? Have you seen yourself?",
        "Jessica: Brody brought over a video, and I look really different.",
        "Cristian: Come on, Jess. You're a beautiful woman.",
        "Jessica: Well, my parents still look the same. I think that's kind of crazy, but a lot has changed. My grandfather died.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah. Not too long ago.",
        "Jessica: I didn't get to say good-bye. I mean, I know I went to his funeral, but--",
        "Cristian: Asa knew you loved him.",
        "Jessica: You always know what to say.",
        "Cristian: But you didn't always think that.",
        "Jessica: You're perfect for me--the love of my life. You said that.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, Jess, but that was a long time ago.",
        "Jessica: Well, the love of your life doesn't change. I mean, it can't. It's for your life. Don't you still love me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Let me tell you, man. I wish I was lucky enough to forget Mitch Laurence.",
        "Brody: You think Jessica's lucky?",
        "Roxy: Hell, yes, for losing Mitch and Nash and the baby dying and all them people that take over her? Yeah, I think she'll be a whole lot happier without that. You know, but not happier forgetting you. Listen, you two can beat Mitch. You can be better than that.",
        "Brody: So can you.",
        "Roxy: You got to fight for your girl, and believe me, you're in her head, and you're still in her heart. It'll all shake down, and she'll come back to you.",
        "Brody: That's what Natalie and Charlie say.",
        "Roxy: And they're right. You'll get Jessica back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Um, yes, you were the love of my life, Jess, and I thought we'd be together forever, but you know, a lot has changed since then.",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Cristian: All right, what has your family told you?",
        "Jessica: That I had a husband and that I have a little girl, and I guess there were boyfriends like that Brody guy.",
        "Cristian: That's true.",
        "Jessica: We were so in love, Cris. How come we're not still together? I mean, how did we break up?",
        "Cristian: Someone from my past showed up.",
        "Jessica: Who?",
        "Cristian: Roseanne.",
        "Jessica: I don't remember her. Did you cheat on me with her?",
        "Cristian: No.",
        "Jessica: Well, then what happened?",
        "Cristian: You cheated on me.",
        "Jessica: No. Seriously? How could I do that?",
        "Cristian: I don't know. You felt threatened, I guess.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God, Cristian. I'm so sorry. You must hate me.",
        "Cristian: Jess, it's okay, it's okay. Listen, we're friends.",
        "Jessica: Friends?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, we're great friends, and you know what? Sometimes that's usually better than a lot of relationships.",
        "Jessica: So are you single?",
        "Cristian: No. No, I'm not single. I have a girlfriend.",
        "Jessica: Well, who is it, this Roseanna girl?",
        "Cristian: No. No. Her name is Layla.",
        "Jessica: Well, is it serious? Do you love her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I can't imagine how lost you must have felt.",
        "Langston: Neither could I, until later. I mean, when you're in it, you're just in it doing whatever you can to keep up.",
        "Ford: You know what? You should write that down exactly like you told me. It'll make you feel good.",
        "Langston: Maybe.",
        "Ford: The way it went down for you. Your life changed just like that.",
        "Langston: My parents died just like that.",
        "Ford: Do you, uh--do you think they died happy?",
        "Langston: I'm sure of it. They were doing what they loved.",
        "Ford: And you're their daughter. That's why you're here. You got scared into this safe place, and that makes sense, but you can't live there forever. That's not who you are, and that's why you're here.",
        "Langston: I came here to tell you to back off.",
        "Ford: No. That's a phone call. You came here because you wanted to break free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Yeah, I always wonder what it would be like to sleep past 7 A.M., you know, party all night.",
        "Hannah: You think you'll ever find out?",
        "Cole: Yeah, you know, when Hope's grown up.",
        "Hannah: Wow. Wow.",
        "Cole: Why? Is it really that strange?",
        "Hannah: No, it's just--I mean, I don't know anyone our age who's so settled and responsible. I mean, did you plan this?",
        "Cole: Hell, no.",
        "Hannah: Did you ever consider not having the baby or adoption?",
        "Cole: Yeah. Starr wanted a friend of ours to adopt her, but I always wanted to keep her.",
        "Hannah: You were in high school.",
        "Cole: She's my kid.",
        "Hannah: Sorry for being so nosy. You should be our sociology project.",
        "Cole: No. Let's just stick with environmental justice for inner cities.",
        "Hannah: Sure. Um, I looked up some programs that we should include.",
        "Cole: Great.",
        "Hannah: I wanted to be you and Starr--have a life like this.",
        "[Hope crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cassie: No. It isn't Addie. I'm sorry. I got the call just now in the car. The clinic tried to reach you, and they had my number as an emergency back-up.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no. No, this--no.",
        "Cassie: I'm so sorry, Kelly. It's your mom.",
        "Dorian: Melinda.",
        "Cassie: She died last night.",
        "Kelly: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I have to go.",
        "Ford: Do you want to be one of those people that wakes up at 40 and ruins everybody's life because you suddenly want to act like a teenager? You're young now. This is your time. If you go, won't you wonder what we could have had? I will. Don't you want to know? Don't you want to live?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm trying to teach a toddler how to blow her nose. That's living the dream?",
        "Hannah: I didn't think about the nose part, but yeah. When I was in high school, I had a boyfriend. He was it, the one. He got accepted to Iowa State, and I wanted to come here. We tried to do the long-distance thing, and then at Christmas, he broke up with me.",
        "Cole: Oh, that's a bummer.",
        "Hannah: He wanted to be free.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Starr and I broke up for a while, and it was hell.",
        "Hannah: Actually, it's the best thing that ever happened to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: This is so sad.",
        "Blair: Yes. It is, sweetheart, and I know how Kelly feels when I thought it was mama.",
        "Starr: Did you call Grandma?",
        "Blair: I got her voice mail, and I wasn't gonna leave a message like this over the phone.",
        "Starr: Just look at Aunt Dorian.",
        "Blair: You know, where is Langston?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andrew: I'm so sorry for your loss. Would you like me to make the arrangements?",
        "Kelly: I have no idea what my mom wanted.",
        "Andrew: Of course. Let me make some calls, and we'll see what we can do.",
        "Dorian: Andrew, that's very nice of you.",
        "Kelly: How did she die?",
        "Cassie: She had a massive coronary in her sleep. They said it was painless. A nurse found her this morning.",
        "Kelly: This isn't happening. I was on my way, you know?",
        "Adriana: Mother?",
        "Dorian: Melinda didn't have a heart condition.",
        "Adriana: Are you sure? She might not have told you.",
        "Dorian: No. She might not have told me, but I got medical reports every month. She was in perfect health.",
        "Adriana: So, what are you saying? What do you think happened to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: How did Melinda die?",
        "Allison: Natural causes, of course.",
        "Mitch: Hmm. Well, this will send Dorian a message. God is always watching, and he will act if someone crosses me.",
        "Allison: They should all know that by now.",
        "Mitch: Yes. Well, some people are slow to learn. I have another task for you, my angel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Brody, you headed to the station?",
        "Brody: Uh, I'm going to the hospital.",
        "Layla: I hope Jessica is doing better.",
        "Brody: Well, maybe Cristian can help.",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Brody: Cristian is visiting Jessica right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Layla and I are-- we're pretty new.",
        "Jessica: So, it's not serious.",
        "Cristian: Well, you know, I want to try to get it right this time. Layla, she's great. She's funny. She's fun. She's beautiful. She makes me want to get it right, and--yeah, yeah--I do love her.",
        "Jessica: That's nice. I'm really happy for you.",
        "Cristian: Thanks. What?",
        "Jessica: I'm trying really hard to be an adult right now, but I just feel like crying.",
        "Cristian: Um, I'm sorry, Jess.",
        "Jessica: I just said that I was happy for you because it was the grownup thing to say, but I'm just so mad.",
        "Cristian: Mad at who?",
        "Jessica: At myself. How could I have cheated on you? I ruined it. I ruined us.",
        "Cristian: No. I mean, yes, but look. Listen. We were kids. It was bound to happen.",
        "Jessica: Was it? Cristian, if I didn't cheat on you, would we still be together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I'm sorry. I thought you knew Cristian was visiting Jessica.",
        "Layla: No. I didn't, but it's fine. They're old friends.",
        "Brody: Well, I think he's only there because she called him and asked him to come.",
        "Layla: Really? Well, why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I haven't thought about that in so long.",
        "Jessica: You never wondered?",
        "Cristian: Oh, could we have been together all these years?",
        "Jessica: Because I can't imagine being with anyone else.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but I don't know if we'd still be a couple, Jess.",
        "Jessica: You're sure?",
        "Cristian: We were babies. First love never lasts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: This from Markko? Be right here, okay?",
        "Langston: Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I got to go. I'm training for a new job.",
        "Jessica: Well, don't you work for your mom at the diner now?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, sometimes, but, you know, it's different now. It's called Buenos Dias.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: It's like everything in Jessica's life stopped. She's still in high school.",
        "Layla: So, wait. Does Jessica remember you? She doesn't remember she's in love with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, what's your job?",
        "Cristian: I'm gonna teach art.",
        "Jessica: You're still an artist?",
        "Cristian: Yes. That's something else that hasn't changed.",
        "Jessica: Oh, that's so great. You're so talented, and I knew that you just had to keep on painting, no matter what.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. I have. It's meant a lot of day jobs to fill in the gaps, but, you know, I've sold some paintings.",
        "Jessica: I knew it. Didn't I tell you? I knew it. You just had to believe and keep on painting.",
        "Cristian: You did. You were my first fan besides my mom, of course.",
        "Jessica: You held on to your dream.",
        "Cristian: I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: This Jessica doesn't love me. She doesn't even like me very much.",
        "Layla: So, if Jessica is stuck in high school, does she still think she's in love with Cristian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, where are you going to be working?",
        "Cristian: Llanview High.",
        "Jessica: And I still feel like a student.",
        "Cristian: Jess, listen. Hang in there. There's a lot of people here that are gonna take care of you. Don't you give up, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I don't know what Jessica thinks right now.",
        "Layla: So, what do the doctors say?",
        "Brody: Oh, they don't know how it works, Layla, what will bring Jessica back, if anything.",
        "Layla: Brody, if that woman doesn't remember you, then she'll just fall in love with you all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Take care of yourself, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Cristian: And, you know, one day, it's gonna click, you'll get your memories back, and you'll catch up.",
        "Jessica: I guess that'll be good.",
        "Cristian: Sure, it would. Look, Jess. You have a lot now. You have your family. You have your little girl. You got Brody. He's a good guy, and he really loves you. See you.",
        "Jessica: See you.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I love you, Cris.",

        "Ford: You are smoking hot. You know that, right?",
        "[Langston chuckles]",
        "Ford: Was it as good for you as it was for me?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Langston: Someone is really trying to find me. What if it's Markko?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Mom, I don't know why Langston isn't texting me back. Do you think something happened to her?",
        "Blair: I'm sure Langston is just fine.",
        "Starr: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Blair: Look at Dorian. She does not need anything to upset her any more today. What she needs is all of her girls around her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I was actually supposed to see my mom last month. Zane was sick, so I cancelled. I had a ticket out of here tonight. One day, and I would've been there, and I don't know how she can be dead right now. I don't remember if I told her I loved her. The last time I was on the phone, Zane was pitching a fit, and I said I had to go and get off fast. I don't remember.",
        "Dorian: Your mother loved you very much. Why, she bragged and bragged about you. She told everybody what a wonderful daughter she had.",
        "Kelly: That wasn't good enough.",
        "Dorian: Kelly, she loved you, honey. She loved you the same way that I love all of my girls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, my God.",
        "Ford: What?",
        "Langston: My mother needs me. Her sister died.",
        "Ford: Oh, Lang, I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: No. I shouldn't be here. She needed me, and-- I shouldn't be here. I should be there.",
        "Ford: No, no, no. Hey, hey, you didn't do anything wrong. You're not married. You didn't hurt anybody. It's okay. Don't forget this.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Ford: Ha ha ha! Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: When I was with Jason, I was stuck in high school. I wasn't growing or meeting new people.",
        "Cole: Well, is it really different now?",
        "Hannah: 180. I have so many new friends. I'm gonna travel over my breaks.",
        "Cole: That's good. That's working out for you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Cole: Excuse me.",
        "Hannah: Oh.",
        "Cole: Hey, baby, what's up?",
        "Starr: Really bad news.",
        "Cole: What, is it Mitch Laurence again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Do you understand?",
        "Allison: I know exactly what to do. I'll take care of it.",
        "Mitch: Mm, as you always do with every task I give you. I could always count on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Layla: Hey.",
        "Cristian: I guess they wanted you back at the cop shop.",
        "Layla: Yeah. I'm picking up lunch.",
        "Cristian: I just had the strangest hour ever.",
        "Layla: Really?",
        "Cristian: Yes. Jess called, and I went to see her.",
        "Layla: Brody told me.",
        "Cristian: Did he tell you what happened? It's the craziest thing. As far as she remembers, we're still a couple.",
        "Layla: Yeah. That's tough. What'd you do?",
        "Cristian: Well, I tried to be nice, but I told her that we're over, that we'd been over for a long time, and that I have a girlfriend that makes me very happy.",
        "Layla: How'd she take that?",
        "Cristian: Hard, but I think she understood. It was a long time ago. There's nothing left between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: For a minute, I thought that my grandma had died. My mom did, too.",
        "Cole: She must've been freaked.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Well, what do you need? Do you want me to grab Hope and come over?",
        "Starr: Oh, no. It's so cold outside.",
        "Cole: Look. I'll bundle her up. She'll be fine. Now, you need your family together.",
        "Starr: Of course I do, but I don't want to spread her germs, either. No. We're really okay. All the Cramers are hanging together.",
        "Cole: You always do.",
        "Starr: So, how's our little princess doing?",
        "Cole: Fussy but okay. Hey, call me if you need me.",
        "Starr: Okay. I will.",
        "Cole: Hey, I love you.",
        "Starr: I love you, too.",
        "Cole: Okay. Sorry. Uh, okay. Inner city green projects. Why don't we compare those two in New York City with--",
        "[Hope crying]",
        "Cole: I'm sorry again. She's probably thirsty.",
        "Hannah: You sure you don't want to learn keg stands? Might be a little easier.",
        "Cole: You know, you are probably right, but I like this life.",
        "Hannah: I can see that, but the next time we need to work, let's meet at my dorm. My roommate is always at her boyfriend's.",
        "[Crying continues]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston, where were you?",
        "Dorian: Oh, Langston!",
        "Langston: I'm so sorry. I should've been here. I am so sorry about your sister.",
        "Dorian: Ohh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Hey, Markko, how about some service?",
        "[Taps counter]",
        "Markko: Get in line.",
        "Ford: Oh, man, come on. I just had a killer workout. I'm starving.",
        "Markko: Yeah? What, strength training, cardio?",
        "Ford: Both, new routine. It's so good, it's sick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: It's hard to lose someone you love.",
        "Dorian: And you know that better than anybody. That's your-- that's your cousin Kelly. I'm so sorry you have to meet her under these circumstances.",
        "Blair: You know, Kelly, before mama got better, she needed a lot of attending to, just like your mother did, and anyhow, it just seemed like, no matter what I did, it just never was enough, but it was. You did right by your mother, sweetheart. You did. You did right by her.",
        "Kelly: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Kelly: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Mm...",
        "Andrew: I made some calls. How you holding up?",
        "Dorian: Whether or not my sister Melinda died of a heart attack, it was most definitely not of natural causes. Mitch was behind it, and we all have to be on our guard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I'm not through with you, Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: There's not enough hooch in the whole wide world to take the edge off of Mitch Laurence.",
