        "Marty: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: And I only hope that you can grant me another chance to earn your forgiveness. While I get to know my daughter again, I would very much like to get to know you as well.",
        "Starr: What -- Aunt Dorian!",
        "Dorian: Langston, are you all right? Oh, I can't believe this man got to you. Thank heavens I got here when I did.",
        "Lola: Oh, my God, Papi, can you hear me? Papi? You killed him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hey, Carmen, have you seen my mom?",
        "Carmen: I think she just left.",
        "Cristian: Okay, thanks.",
        "Cristian: Layla, how's it going?",
        "Layla: Fine.",
        "Cristian: Guess you're not going to ask me how I'm doing.",
        "Layla: I already know. You're the biggest jackass on the planet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Hi, Gigi. I thought you were out running errands.",
        "Gigi: That's what I'm doing. What are you doing?",
        "Stacy: Me? Oh, I was just checking up on that waitressing job.",
        "Gigi: You applied for it?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I told you that before. You didn't forget, did you?",
        "Gigi: No, no, it's just I think Carlotta did.",
        "Stacy: What do you mean?",
        "Gigi: I came in here to, you know, put in a good word for you, and the funniest thing, she said she never got your application.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: [Whispers] What was that?",
        "Rex: [Whispers] What was what?",
        "Natalie: I thought you said we were just borrowing DVDs from the hospital.",
        "Rex: I tried. They said something about breaching hospital security.",
        "Natalie: This isn't breaching hospital security?",
        "Rex: Not if we don't get caught.",
        "Natalie: This is where the hospital stores the video surveillance?",
        "Rex: With any luck, it'll tell us what Jessica was doing here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You are such a good girl.",
        "Jessica: Hi, Mom.",
        "Viki: Hi, honey. I think we got more food on her than in her.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Jessica: How's my sweet girl?",
        "Viki: She's extremely well fed. She just ate this whole container of yams.",
        "Jessica: You're kidding me. I just had her try those the other day.",
        "Viki: Well, obviously, your technique worked.",
        "Jessica: I don't know about that.",
        "Viki: I do. Honey, you're a very, very good mother.",
        "Jessica: Thank you, but I know you're just saying that because of how Natalie's been treating me since I got home from St. Ann's.",
        "Viki: No, no, I'm saying it because it's true, okay? And Natalie will come around.",
        "Jessica: Actually, she's making an effort.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jessica was Tess the night she came here. At least, I'm pretty sure she was.",
        "Rex: If we can find her on the DVD, we might be able to figure out what she was doing.",
        "Natalie: The night Chloe was born.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Blair: Well, I was thinking about taking a shower until you barged in.",
        "John: The paper, Blair, what were you thinking?",
        "Blair: This? I'm just calling it like I see it.",
        "John: How'd they get the photo?",
        "Blair: I took it with my cell phone at the crime scene with you and Marty there. I took it on the sly. Now does that answer all your questions?",
        "John: Why would you do that? Why would you sell Marty out to a piece of crap tabloid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What are you doing in my room?",
        "Marty: Cole --",
        "Cole: What are you doing here?",
        "Marty: I -- I was released from jail this morning. I'm moving back in.",
        "Cole: And the first thing you do is go through my stuff?",
        "Marty: Your phone was ringing.",
        "Cole: So what, now that you live here, you thought you could answer it?",
        "Marty: No, I didn't.",
        "Cole: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Marty: I -- I saw the letter from your school.",
        "Cole: And you read it?",
        "Marty: It was addressed to me, and it says you're flunking. Cole; well, it's too bad you weren't here to open it yourself. You were too busy with your friend Wes.",
        "Marty: Cole, I know, I should have been there for you. I know that.",
        "Cole: Nice try.",
        "Marty: Cole --",
        "Cole: Get the hell out of my room!",
        "Marty: Not until you tell me what you're doing with all these pills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Just get his feet above his heart. I'm a doctor.",
        "Lola: Is he going to be all right?",
        "Dorian: Believe me, if I wanted to kill your father, he'd be dead.",
        "Starr: I don't think you did him any favors.",
        "Dorian: Equal and reactive.",
        "Langston: What does that \u0096",
        "Dorian: Okay, why is everybody looking at me like I did something wrong? I was merely trying to prevent this man from absconding with my daughter again.",
        "Langston: My uncle was apologizing, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: And you believed him?",
        "Langston: Why shouldn't I?",
        "Dorian: Because he was conning you the same way he's been conning you since the moment he laid eyes on -- never mind. Did you call the police?",
        "Langston: Police? What?",
        "Dorian: He -- he's an escaped felon.",
        "Lola: Stop it. My father didn't do anything.",
        "[Ray moans]",
        "Lola: Papi, are you all right?",
        "Ray: Never better.",
        "Ray: Dr. Lord has every reason not to trust me.",
        "Dorian: Good, great to hear somebody agrees with my opinion.",
        "Ray: Not to mention your taste in weapons. It's amazing, Austrian crystal? That's very impressive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: So Carlotta didn't get my application?",
        "Gigi: That's what she said.",
        "Stacy: Hmm, I filled one out.",
        "Gigi: Oh, I wonder why she doesn't have it then?",
        "Stacy: Maybe she lost it?",
        "Gigi: Huh. Oh, excuse me, my sister is interested in waitressing here. Waitress: Oh, I'll get you an application.",
        "Stacy: I mean, I really don't want to keep you.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. Got to make sure this one doesn't get lost, too.",
        "Stacy: Gigi, did I do something wrong?",
        "Gigi: Like what?",
        "Stacy: I don't know. Does this have to do with Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: There we go.",
        "Natalie: Wow, you're really good at this.",
        "Rex: Thanks, just don't tell Gigi. I promised her I wouldn't do anything to get arrested -- at least until the honeymoon.",
        "Natalie: Okay, I swear, this is the last time. I just need to find out why Tess came here and then left before she got a doctor to take care of her or Chloe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, I have to tell you that since the day you came home from St. Ann's, I have never worried about you with your girls.",
        "Jessica: I did.",
        "Viki: I know you did, and it's understandable.",
        "Jessica: But I finally feel like I'm earning your faith in me.",
        "Viki: I'm just very, very happy you're feeling better.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, you know, I -- I'm going to miss Nash forever, but I finally feel like I'm getting back to myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What do you think I'm doing with all the pills?",
        "Marty: These are Schedule II narcotics, Cole. They're dangerous.",
        "Cole: Thank you, Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "Marty: You could kill yourself with this stuff.",
        "Cole: Now, why so serious? I thought all you like to do is party.",
        "Marty: How long have you been taking them?",
        "Cole: Anything is better than being with me, right? Hmm? The son you don't remember? You wanted to get away from me so bad, you hopped on the back of a complete stranger's motorcycle.",
        "Marty: No, I didn't know what else to do. I didn't know you.",
        "Cole: But now you do, and you still could care less.",
        "Marty: No, that's not true.",
        "Cole: You left orders that I couldn't visit you in jail. You can take your fake mother act and go straight to hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I said what I said because everything was true. Marty was in Wes' room, she was covered in his blood, and she was begging you not to call the cops.",
        "John: So you decide you're going to go to the newspaper, you were going to call \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Blair: I wanted to make sure the dangerous woman was off the streets, John.",
        "John: If you did this to get back at me -- if I find out you did this to get back at me --",
        "Blair: You think I did this because you're friends with Marty?",
        "John: Why else would you do it?",
        "Blair: I've got a lot of reasons, John, but you don't want to hear them.",
        "Blair: You know, I didn't do this because I'm jealous or I'm not doing this to get revenge on you.",
        "John: Why did you do it?",
        "Blair: Because I don't want you to be the next one to get a knife in your chest, John. I want Marty locked away where she can't hurt anybody.",
        "John: So Manning, he's out there walking around free, but Marty, she should be locked up.",
        "Blair: Todd has nothing to do with you and me.",
        "John: Neither does she.",
        "Blair: Oh, sure she does. If she were in jail --",
        "John: What?",
        "Blair: Then we could be together.",
        "John: So you just want her out of the picture.",
        "Blair: No, John, I want us to be together without her getting in the way all the time, but you don't want to hear that.",
        "Marty: Just answer my question.",
        "Cole: How long are you back for this time, Mom? And what's it got to do with Todd?",
        "Marty: He's not important now.",
        "Cole: You mean, you don't want to hurt him or put him in jail?",
        "Marty: No, I want to talk about you. When did you start using these?",
        "Cole: I don't know. Maybe it was when my baby died or when Todd walked away from all charges against him or when I finally figured out that no matter how bad I felt for you, you didn't give a damn about me.",
        "Marty: That's not true.",
        "Cole: Look, I spent -- I spent a whole year, a whole year wishing you would come back, and then you do. God, I was so stupid!",
        "Marty: No, no, you weren't stupid. Honey, when I got back and I saw your face for the first time and I realized you were mine, it was incredible.",
        "Cole: Then what happened, hmm? What happened next? You know, I brought out the photo albums. I tried to remind you that I'm your son, but you just ran off to your room. You just ran off to your room so you didn't have to deal with me. But you couldn't stop there. No, you had to go further. You had to move in with a guy you didn't even know just to get away from me. So I don't know, Mom, maybe that's why I started using -- because my own mom can't even look me in the face!",
        "Marty: I'm so sorry.",
        "[Cole scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: Are you sure you're okay? Do you need some ice?",
        "Ray: I'm fine. The only thing Dr. Lord did was try to be a parent to my niece, and that is something that I did not do when my sister and her husband died.",
        "Langston: It's okay. I understand now.",
        "Ray: I'm grateful that you do.",
        "Dorian: Oh, come on, are we forgetting that this man is a convicted murderer?",
        "Ray: Not anymore, I'm not.",
        "Dorian: Pardon me?",
        "Ray: I've been cleared of all charges. I came here to tell Lola that I'm a free man.",
        "Dorian: Bravo! That means you and Lola can go back to Colombia for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: And now your new wife's been deported. Why's that? Oh, right, because she framed her old husband for murder.",
        "Cristian: So that's why I'm the biggest jackass on the planet?",
        "Layla: No, that's why you're a moron. You're the biggest jackass on the planet because you dumped your old girlfriend for --",
        "Cristian: All right, that's enough, that's enough.",
        "Layla: You're still defending her.",
        "Cristian: You can't make me feel any worse than I already do, okay, Layla?",
        "Layla: You know, Cristian, I thought you were one of the good ones. So did Sarah.",
        "Cristian: Do you know how to reach her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You think this is about Rex?",
        "Stacy: Well, I just figured, you know, when you walked in on us earlier --",
        "Gigi: Oh, you mean, when you were helping him stretch his back out?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, you just looked kind of --",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Stacy: Mad?",
        "[Gigi scoffs]",
        "Gigi: What you saw was worry because he's been going through a tough time the last few days.",
        "Stacy: Like what?",
        "Gigi: I can't really talk about it, but that's why his back was stiff and you helped him stretch.",
        "Stacy: So that didn't bother you?",
        "Gigi: You're my sister. He's my boyfriend. I'm glad you two hit it off.",
        "Stacy: Are you sure?",
        "Gigi: I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Stacy: Well, I'm finished.",
        "Gigi: Perfect. Could you make sure Carlotta or Noelle gets this, because her other one got lost.",
        "Waitress: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Thanks.",
        "Rex: Okay, let's see, September, October -- oh, here's November.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, check the 10th between 9:00 and 10:00 P.M.",
        "Rex: Take your pick.",
        "Natalie: All of those? My God, we'll be here all night.",
        "Rex: All right, well, maybe not. They're labeled according to location.",
        "Natalie: Well, that doesn't help. I have no idea where she went.",
        "Rex: Okay, you said she parked in the east wing garage, right?",
        "Natalie: So?",
        "Rex: So she must have come and gone through that entrance. We'll start with that one.",
        "Natalie: I knew I came to the right guy.",
        "Man's voice: Hold it right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I think I may need to give her another bath.",
        "Viki: Oh, why? Did we miss something?",
        "Jessica: I think she's hiding yams behind her ear. She's sneaky, just like her dad.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. I know how hard it is for you still without Nash.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I miss him so much. I wake up and he's not there, and it still knocks the wind out of me.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I know the feeling.",
        "Jessica: But every time I hold Bree and Chloe, you know, I feel close to him. I know that he's a part of them.",
        "Viki: Everything's going to work out, you know. I know it is.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Viki: Well, now, that could be opportunity knocking.",
        "Jessica: Well, all I know is things just have to get better from here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What are you doing here?",
        "Rex: Weren't you in my house the other day with my girlfriend's sister?",
        "Oliver: Yes -- yes, I was.",
        "Rex: Well, I thought you were a cop in Cherryvale.",
        "Oliver: I was, uh -- cutbacks.",
        "Rex: So, you're new to hospital security.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but I still know that you two aren't supposed to be in here.",
        "Natalie: It's my fault, actually. I really needed to use the restroom.",
        "Oliver: Oh, and it didn't occur to you while you were breaking in that this isn't the restroom?",
        "Natalie: Actually, we came in here because we were hoping someone in here would tell us where the restroom is.",
        "Oliver: But that door was locked.",
        "Rex: Well, maybe it was supposed to be locked --",
        "Oliver: No, no, I'm the one who locked it.",
        "Natalie: Well somebody must have unlocked it because the door was wide open when we got here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Gigi, come on in. How are you?",
        "Gigi: Good, I'm good.",
        "Viki: Okay, what's up?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. I just wanted to see how you're doing.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Gigi: No, not really. I need a Paris, Texas coffee talk.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, what's bothering you, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I get it. Since Vanessa turned out to be a lying, manipulative bitch, now you want Sarah back.",
        "Cristian: No, that's not it.",
        "Layla: What is it with you guys around here?",
        "Cristian: What the hell are you talking about, Layla?",
        "Layla: Some new babe wiggles her hips in front of you, and you forget about the one you already have.",
        "Cristian: Not every guy's like that.",
        "Layla: Oh, right, let's see. Vince did it to me and some guy I barely knew. Don't forget about Rex.",
        "Cristian: Oh, so now you're comparing me to Rex.",
        "Layla: You think what he did to Adriana is any worse than what you did to Sarah?",
        "Cristian: Look, I just want to talk to her, okay? As you know, things ended really bad. I have some things that I want to say to her.",
        "Layla: Do what you need to do.",
        "Cristian: Thank you.",
        "Stacy: I love your bag. I have the same one at home but it's a knock off.",
        "Layla: So is mine.",
        "Stacy: Get out.",
        "Layla: I'm not crazy enough to spend $600 on the real deal when it looks just like this.",
        "Stacy: Uh-uh, me, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: My daughter has come to like this place very much. And since she has grown so close to her cousin, I think it would be cruel to separate them.",
        "Langston: Wait, does this mean what I think it means?",
        "Ray: It means I'm going to make a fresh start right here.",
        "Lola: Thank you, Papi. We can really stay?",
        "Ray: We'll try to make Llanview our home, okay?",
        "Langston: I was hoping you'd say that.",
        "Ray: Necesitamos familia, Langston.",
        "Dorian: So, girls, isn't it time for you to get ready for your dance?",
        "Langston: Oh, yeah -- Lola, I have the perfect earrings that you can wear tonight.",
        "Lola: You'll really lend them to me?",
        "Langston: Well, if you lose them, I know where you live.",
        "Lola: Okay, come on, let's go.",
        "Starr: Wait, Langston, what earrings are you talking about?",
        "Langston: The gold ones.",
        "Dorian: So it's just you and me, Mr. Montez.",
        "Ray: Why do you look at me like that?",
        "Dorian: Because I don't believe for one minute that you're an innocent man.",
        "Lola: Why don't you come with us?",
        "Starr: I said no.",
        "Langston: Come on, it's going to be a lot of fun. And if you don't go, I'm going to spend the whole night worrying about you.",
        "Starr: You know sooner or later she's going to start guilting you like that, too.",
        "Lola: She's right, though. You'll have a good time.",
        "Langston: And if Cole does show up, isn't there a little part of you who really wants to see him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I know I haven't been any kind of mother to you.",
        "Cole: You think?",
        "Marty: But that's why I'm here today, so we can start over.",
        "Cole: Okay, I thought it was because your boyfriend died. I mean, where else are you going to stay, right?",
        "Marty: Wes's death has nothing to do with this.",
        "Cole: You know, I -- I would have believed that before the other night.",
        "Marty: What happened the other night?",
        "Cole: I got my acceptance letter to L.U.",
        "Marty: That's great. Congratulations.",
        "Cole: I ran over to Angel Square hotel. I mean, I had this crazy idea that you'd want to know.",
        "Marty: Of course I would want to know, but why didn't you tell me?",
        "Cole: You were arguing.",
