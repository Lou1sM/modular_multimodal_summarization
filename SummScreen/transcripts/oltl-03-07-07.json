        "John: You also killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Miles, you don't need to buy everyone at the bar a drink.",
        "Miles: Why not? I'm rich now -- thanks to Spencer. And judging from everybody's smiles, I think I'm making some friends.",
        "Marty: No, no, no, you are not making friends, you are buying friends.",
        "Miles: Hmm -- um -- and that would be a problem --",
        "Marty: Because, Miles, they're not real friends.",

        "Bo: John -- what -- no, wait, John asked you to do that?",

        "David: You seriously think I killed Spencer?",
        "John: You don't seem real surprised to hear that your brother's dead -- or that I'm alive, now that I think about it.",
        "David: You look fantastic, by the way. I always say a little chemical peel never hurts now and again. John, I know exactly what's going on in Llanview. I have access to Internet and email. A person can stay pretty well informed all the way down here in paradise.",
        "John: Yeah, you've done some traveling since you left Llanview.",
        "David: You should be a detective or something.",
        "John: Not in the mood, Vickers.",
        "David: Shocking.",
        "John: You know, I never thought I'd say this to you, but keep talking.",
        "David: When I left Llanview, I only had enough money for a bus ticket to Miami, where I stowed away on what turned out to be a discount cruise ship to an island in the French Caribbean whose name I can't even pronounce.",
        "John: Oh, Boy.",
        "David: But let me tell you -- when I was on that ship I started what I thought was the beginning of a beautiful relationship with a Cantonese runway model with a titanium hip who, after paying for most of my drinks and all of my food, had the temerity to call me a gold digger, which I found so insulting I stole what was left of her money and Bought myself a first-class ticket to my new home, here, in paradise, where, apparently, I fit right in because the locals have adopted me as one of their own -- they've even nicknamed me, affectionately, \"Blanco Stupido. \"",
        "John: Vickers, you need to focus here. You're in this up to your eyeballs.",
        "David: Wow -- I thought you were a pill in Thailand. John, why don't you take off your jacket, let me order us some Pina Coladas -- which, if you can run faster than the waiter, are free. Sigh",

        "Miles: Then I -- then I've offended you in some way or something.",
        "Marty: No. No, Miles, listen to me. I can't be your friend and your doctor at the same time.",
        "Miles: Oh. So when I was at the hospital, the doctors -- they didn't want to play cards with me. And I thought it was because they were afraid they were going to beat me, or I was going to beat them. I'm just kidding -- anyway, I know all that stuff.",
        "Marty: Ok, so you understand why you and I can't socialize?",
        "Miles: Yeah. It's ok, because you're fired.",
        "Marty: No, no, no, no, no. I -- I'm not suggesting that you quit therapy.",
        "Miles: Buzz kill.",
        "Marty: That would be me.",
        "Miles: Besides, can we just -- we need a drink and we'll worry about that stuff later. Hmm?",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "Miles: I'm going to get you another bottle of wine.",
        "Marty: No, no, no. Two is my limit.",
        "Miles: You're going to -- you're going to stay and finish this with me?",
        "Marty: Yes, yes, and then I am going home. And don't even say it.",
        "Miles: Hmm!",
        "Marty: I am a single mother I have a full-time job that kicks my butt on a daily basis.",
        "Miles: Oh. No, I get it. I get it. Um --",
        "Marty: Ah.",
        "Miles: But -- I may need some advice on the way --",
        "Marty: Yes -- ok, um -- this is a very important rule that I must now impart to you.",
        "Miles: Hmm?",
        "Marty: Never mix, never fear. Now, that means --",
        "Miles: You drink your liquor straight.",
        "Marty: No. It means you stick with what you started and you won't get sick.",
        "Miles: Hmm. I need another beer. Can I have another beer, please?",
        "Marty: Even if you drink the same thing, you still can get sick or at least you're going to have a really bad hangover.",
        "Miles: That can be my new experience for tomorrow.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So what made you decide to go with beer?",

        "Miles: It is to me.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Well, you know, beer can hit you pretty hard, too, and if you don't have any experience like you don't, you know, before you know it, you are going to be on that floor.",

        "Antonio: Oh. It's hitting you now?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, and I guess with everything, I was so worried about the two of you, I didn't stop to realize that somebody set that fire intentionally and -- it happened to your club and I'm -- it's scaring the hell out of me.",

        "John: don't.",
        "Waiter: Yes, sir.",
        "David: You are so intent on finding Spencer's killer, you're resorting to the usual suspect, which is exactly what you did when you were looking for your father's murderer. I probably shouldn't have brought that up.",
        "John: No. And you shouldn't come back to Llanview, either.",

        "Marty: Oh, no, no, no. You did that all by yourself.",

        "Evangeline: No. No, he swears he was just trying to cheer me up, you know? Private lunch at the penthouse catered with Waiters and -- and then there was the massage.",
        "Layla: You let him massage you?",
        "Evangeline: No! No, he hired a masseuse.",
        "Layla: Oh. He pulled out all the stops.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, it was kind of over the top.",
        "Layla: But you liked it.",
        "Evangeline: Well, he was -- he was really genuine.",
        "Layla: It's awfully hard to resist.",
        "Evangeline: But I did. I mean, I did, and everything was fine and then Starr shows up and --",
        "Layla: Oh, my god. Starr didn't think that you --",
        "Evangeline: Well, yeah. I think she thought that -- that Todd was cheating on Blair with me.",

        "Bo: But you thought he did, and that's why you covered for him.",
        "Natalie: I know, but it was a knee-jerk reaction and then I realized that John couldn't have, and he wouldn't throw suspicion off of himself by accusing his own brother.",
        "Bo: That's a good point, but I asked him about that. He said he didn't have enough hard evidence to connect Michael to the murder.",
        "Natalie: Well, he really didn't -- I mean, just that those fibers could have come from Michael, but they didn't, so they were insignificant.",
        "Bo: That's not the point. What you did was wrong, and John covered for you. That's just as bad if not worse.",
        "Natalie: I know, but we wanted to tell you.",

You're needling Cristian, you're playing with Evangeline's vulnerabilities even though you know that Cristian doesn't like it, and when, you know, you go away, you're there to pick up the pieces and -- she still loves Cristian. That's the bottom line.",
        "Todd: Right, but she doesn't exactly hate me.",
        "Jessica: Well, she's confused. She's had a lot to deal with and I know you guys have helped each other through rough times and she might care about you on some level, but she still loves Cristian and you are just wrong for her.",
        "Todd: Really? Why?",
        "Jessica: Because you still love Blair.",
        "Todd: Blair's out of the picture.",
