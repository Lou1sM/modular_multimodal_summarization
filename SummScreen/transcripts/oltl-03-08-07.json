        "Marty: Jessica?",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Marty: Hi.",
        "Jessica: Do you have a minute?",
        "Marty: Yes, come in. Oh, what's wrong?",
        "Jessica: I told Nash that I loved him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I went down to Capricorn. The whole place is a crime scene, but I talked to the cops. They let me in long enough to get these. The insurance papers you wanted. Something wrong?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, you and I need to get something straight between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Don't you ever do that to me again.",
        "John: You never want to do it again?",
        "Natalie: No. You know what I mean. Don't ever leave town without telling me where you're going or how long you'll be gone.",
        "John: I promise. You know, things are going to be different. I know I said that before, but I mean it this time. You make my world better. And I'm not going to let anything come between us, never again.",
        "Natalie: Um -- I'm coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: This is absolutely absurd! How is anybody expected to get a decent night's sleep in this filth hole? I demand to see my lawyer.",
        "John: You aren't going to need one.",
        "Dorian: Oh, wonderful. May I hope that you have finally apprehended Spencer Truman's real killer?",
        "John: It looks that way.",
        "Dorian: David --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: So you and your -- you and your mom are house hunting, huh?",
        "Matthew: On the computer mostly.",
        "Bo: You having any luck?",
        "Matthew: Some are ok, but not like the old house. And, I mean, even if we did find one, we wouldn't have anything to put in it.",
        "Bo: No, you know what? You will have something. I'll tell you, son, you have the most important thing to put in your house, and that's love. That can turn any house into a home.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Bo: Ah, you know what? That sounded just as corny to me as it sounded to you, but it's the truth. I'm telling you. Matthew, you got to trust me.",
        "Matthew: Thanks for trying to cheer me up.",
        "Bo: I'll tell you what, I'll just stop by later and I'll try to cheer you up in person, ok?",
        "Matthew: Sure.",
        "Bo: You just -- you hang in there, son. All right.",
        "Lindsay: Hey.",
        "Bo: Lindsay .",
        "Lindsay: Hi.",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "Lindsay: I was just dropping off some artwork I donated for the police auction and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.",
        "Bo: Well, hi.",
        "Lindsay: Matthew went through a rough time. I couldn't help but overhear.",
        "Bo: He grew up in that house, the only house he's ever known. I think he's having a hard time, and sometimes things that you lose -- you just can't get them back.",
        "Lindsay: Sometimes you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hmm. Hey, kiddo. Listen to this one. \"Four bedrooms with a pool, a game room with pool table. \"",
        "Matthew: It's kind of far from school.",
        "Nora: Did I mention it has a pool table?",
        "Nora: Ok, all right. Oh, here's one. Ok. \"Country charmer. Needs a little T. L. C. \" --",
        "Matthew: Mom, that's code for a small shack that's falling apart.",
        "Nora: All right, you're getting a little too good at this. This one. \"Palatial dream home, former model, desirable subdivision. \"",
        "Matthew: \"Mc Mansion with no yard\"?",
        "Nora: Sweetie, we can't have everything.",
        "Matthew: We used to.",
        "Nora: I know. I miss our house, too, but we have to find something. We cannot live here forever.",
        "Asa: Hogwash! Hogwash. There is no reason why you two cannot live here.",
        "Nora: Asa, there's a whole list of reasons, and the very top reason is I'm your son's ex-wife.",
        "Asa: Then you go and leave Matthew here.",
        "Nora: Very funny.",
        "Asa: I'm not joking.",
        "Matthew: Thanks, Grandpa, but I think my mom needs me.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Asa: There's a new computer in the guestroom on the third floor. I wonder if that would change your mind.",
        "Matthew: I don't think so, but can I go check it out?",
        "Asa: It is yours, Matthew.",
        "Nora: Asa, I want to thank you for everything you've done for Matthew and me.",
        "Asa: This place used to be crawling with family. Felt like the old days for a second -- having Matthew running around.",
        "Nora: Well, you'll -- you'll be stuck with us for a while longer. I can't buy a house until I get my insurance check, and they seem to be dragging their feet. God knows I've called them so many times, I've memorized the policy number.",
        "Asa: Did you happen to read the fine print?",
        "Nora: Did you happen to remember I'm a lawyer?",
        "Asa: And if you remember, I'm a businessman. A loophole can be the size of a pinprick. And if there is one, the customer will fall right through it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: All right, so what -- what are you doing here?",
        "Vincent: I stopped by the police station. They say you didn't come in today.",
        "Natalie: What'd you want?",
        "Vincent: I came by to see if you were ok this morning.",
        "Natalie: Don't know. I was asleep.",
        "Vincent: Natalie, the day's half over. You depressed?",
        "Natalie: Did you come over here to give me more unwanted advice?",
        "Vincent: Nope. Just breakfast. Hey, coffee's probably half cold by now, but it's the thought that counts, right?",
        "Natalie: Honestly, I don't even think that coffee, or muffins, are going to help me with this one.",
        "Vincent: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Thanks.",
        "Vincent: What happened?",
        "Natalie: Well, I tried to take control of my life, and now it's more out of control than ever.",
        "Vincent: What did you do?",
        "Natalie: I told my Uncle Bo about that thing that I did.",
        "Vincent: Oh, that thing that you told John that he didn't like? That may cause you to lose your job and your man?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I already lost one -- so far. I was kicked out of the forensics program and I'm lucky to keep my desk job.",
        "Vincent: Well, that's not right.",
        "Natalie: You don't even know what I did.",
        "Vincent: No, but I know you. And I know that you're more than some simple desk flunky. And anyone who can't see that is a damn fool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: David, you came all the way here to get me out of jail?",
        "David: You could say that.",
        "John: Mc Carthy?",
        "Ofc. Mc Carthy: Sir --",
        "John: You're free to go.",
        "David: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank you, thank you! Oh. I hope sincerely that you have finally found Spencer's real killer. But may I say, I hope he gets off scot-free, because that man is my hero. David, darling, let's go home. I need a hot shower before these clothes crawl off my body.",
        "David: You don't understand.",
        "John: Step inside, Vickers.",
        "Dorian: What? Wait a minute -- what's going on here?",
        "John: He's under arrest for the murder of Spencer Truman.",
        "Dorian: Why, that's absurd!",
        "David: Dorian --",
        "Dorian: Don't say another word until we get you a lawyer.",
        "John: Oh, it's a little late for that.",
        "David: I did it, Dorian. I killed Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: My insurance covers fire, including arson. I just can't wait till they stop dragging their feet, I can get a check, find something, and move on with our life.",
        "Asa: I got to admit, I'm -- I'm getting a little sick of the sight of you.",
        "Nora: Fine, Asa, we'll move out tonight.",
        "Asa: No. No, no, not -- not you. I mean, those clothes. Rene\u00e9's clothes -- they -- they just don't look right on you.",
        "Nora: Oh -- oh, thank you, Mr. Blackwell.",
        "Asa: Who?",
        "Nora: For goodness sake -- they're Rene\u00e9's clothes. Very kind of her. If you remember, my house burned down to the ground with everything I know in it, and I haven't really had much of a chance to go shopping.",
        "Maid: Your packages have arrived, Mr. Buchanan.",
        "Asa: Oh, just in time.",
        "Maid: Shall I bring in the rest?",
        "Asa: No, let's -- let her try these.",
        "Nora: What is this?",
        "Asa: Well, no Buchanan woman -- even an ex-Buchanan woman -- should have hand- me-downs. So I asked Ren\u00e9e to send over some duds from the fancy schmancy store in The Palace.",
        "Nora: Asa, you -- you really -- you just -- you shouldn't have. I'm so glad you did. I don't know what Matthew and I would do without you. I really don't.",
        "Asa: Oh, you'd do just fine. Let me tell you something. You are the toughest woman I know.",
        "Matthew: Mom, why are you crying? Is everything ok?",
        "Nora: Oh, I'm not crying. I'm not crying at all. Everything's great. Everything's just -- it's just perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Coffee?",
        "Lindsay: Oh, no, thank you. But maybe you could tell me what it is -- what's the thing with the cop and the doughnuts? What --",
        "Bo: I don't know.",
        "Lindsay: Things -- that's what we were talking about.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Lindsay: Yes, books and -- and clothes and -- and you know, sometimes, even relationships. You lose them and you get ne w ones.",
        "Bo: What do you do? You just go to a -- a relationship store?",
        "Lindsay: Wouldn't that be great?",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Lindsay: \"I'll have a new relationship, over easy, please, to go. \" Right? That's a good one. No, you don't -- well, you can start over. And sometimes you get really lucky, and you get a second chance with an old friend.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Yeah. Ahem.",
        "Lindsay: The only thing -- the only thing that you can't replace is a life.",
        "Talia: Excuse me, Commissioner.",
        "Bo: Yes, Talia, what is it?",
        "Talia: I need to speak to you about the arson case.",
        "Lindsay: Oh. Uh -- I'm going to get out of your way.",
        "Bo: All right. Well, you know what? If you have time, you can stick around. We'll continue this conversation.",
        "Lindsay: Ok, I'll be in the squad room.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "Talia: Here's the report on the Capricorn fire. That looks like the same guy who set the other ones.",
        "Bo: Any hard evidence?",
        "Talia: Like fingerprints? No, nothing like that, but --",
        "Bo: But what?",
        "Talia: I'm not an expert or anything, sir, but when I was with NYPD, I have -- I had some experience with sifting through debris, and --",
        "Bo: Well, Talia, I -- I'm aware of your experiences in New York.",
        "Talia: Ok. Well, maybe the techs -- you know, they can miss things. Maybe they just need a fresh set of eyes, or a more personal approach.",
        "Bo: Didn't we talk about bringing a personal kind of a thing into an investigation?",
        "Talia: Sir, with all due respect, one of our own almost just got killed. I --",
        "Bo: You're right. What are you thinking?",
        "Talia: I go back to Capricorn, take a look around. I me , maybe the arson squad missed something.",
        "Bo: I say go for it. I'll clear it with the fire department.",
        "Talia: Um -- ahem -- I want this guy. Not just because Antonio's my friend, but I can't stand to think about the fact that that guy got so close to making Jamie an orphan -- sir.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I'm curious. I still never found out how you and Jessica got stuck inside that storage room to begin with.",
        "Nash: Remember you sent me to get those glasses?",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Nash: All right. Well, I went down to the storage room, Jessica was there. I didn't know the door would stick behind me so we couldn't get out.",
        "Antonio: And why was Jessica there?",
        "Nash: I don't know.",
        "Antonio: You know, your honesty and your loyalty mean a lot to me.",
        "Nash: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Antonio: All right. So I'm hoping that -- that you're truthful now, because there's something I need to ask you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: But how did it even get to that point, sweetie? I mean, the last time you and I talked, you were determined to keep your distance from him.",
        "Jessica: That's what I said, but --",
        "Marty: Easier said than done?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. A couple nights before that, Nash and I were alone together at the loft, and we almost made love. And then Cristian overheard Nash telling Layla the whole story.",
        "Marty: Cristian?",
        "Jessica: Yeah -- the worst person on earth to find out about this, so I had to tell him how much I love Antonio and that it would never happen again.",
        "Marty: But it did.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, it sure did. The night of the fire, Cristian and I had a fight in the storage room, and he stormed off, and I -- I was just upset, so I just sat there, because I didn't want to go back t o the party, but I couldn't go home, and then -- Nash showed up, and I -- I kissed him. But I broke it off immediately. I swear, I broke it off. And I tried to leave, but the door was stuck, and then the fire started and --",
        "Marty: Oh, Jessica --",
        "Jessica: I just didn't want him to die without knowing how I really felt about him, you know?",
        "Marty: So it's true? You really do love Nash?",
        "Jessica: Well, I guess it is, you know, because that's what I wanted to say and do in my dying moments. Oh, what am I going to do? I love Antonio. He is my husband. But I love Nash. And he wants a life with me now.",
        "Marty: Jess, the only thing that matters is, what do you want? I'm going to ask you some questions.",
        "Jessica: Ok, go ahead.",
        "Marty: Ok. So you say that you love Antonio, right?",
        "Jessica: Of course I do. I love him with all my heart. He's everything that I've ever wanted in a man.",
        "Marty: Ok, and how about your feelings for Nash?",
        "Jessica: He drives me crazy. He makes me nuts. Nobody makes me angrier than he does.",
        "Marty: Ok. So let me ask you this. When you are physically with Nash, do you still feel connected to your feelings for him?",
        "Jessica: Do you mean, am I having Tess' feelings and not my own?",
        "Marty: Are you?",
        "Jessica: I wish. I wish. I mean -- this isn't D. I. D. believe it or not, I -- things were less complicated before I was integrated. I mean, back then, I loved Antonio, Tess loved Nash. But now -- now that I've gotten to know Nash -- me, Jessica -- and I've been able to see him through my eyes, feel for him with my heart, it --",
        "Marty: And are you sure of these feelings?",
        "Jessica: Yes. I wish I wasn't, but it's not like I'm two personalities with two separate sets of feelings, you know? I'm -- I'm one woman in love with two men. I don't know what to do about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: What do you want to know, Antonio?",
        "Antonio: I was hoping maybe you could give me some clues.",
        "Nash: The fire? I -- I was in the storage room already when the fire started.",
        "Antonio: With Jessica?",
        "Nash: Yeah. So I suppose neither of us know anything.",
        "Antonio: I see. But you went to go get the glasses in the storage room before the fire started, so you and Jessica must have been stuck in there for quite a while. What -- what were you guys doing that whole time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: You say you did something wrong for the right reasons, right? The way I see it, you're getting the raw deal.",
        "Natalie: Not much I can do about it.",
        "Vincent: Sure there is. You can tell them to take that desk job and stick it!",
        "Natalie: Ok, ok, I get it, but I don't think that's going to go over too big with my Uncle Bo.",
        "Vincent: Fine. Don't. Stay chained to that desk answering the phones -- for people who ain't even half of who you are, Nat. Is that who you are? Is that what you want?",
        "Natalie: And I really loved forensics. And I was good at it, too.",
        "Vincent: You're damn straight.",
        "Natalie: You know, it made me feel a part of something.",
        "Vincent: A part of John's",
        "Natalie: That is not the only reason.",
        "Vincent: Nat, no disrespect. But if that's what you want, it's cool with me. Ok? But I'm here to tell you that you don't need anyone to put you under their wing. You could fly just fine on your own.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I just crash-landed.",
        "Vincent: Can't you get John to get you back on this?",
        "Natalie: He doesn't know about it.",
        "Vincent: You haven't talked?",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Vincent: Call him.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, that's pretty hard to do when I don't even know where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: It's impossible. David did not kill Spencer Truman. I mean, he wasn't even in Llanview at the time.",
        "John: We have video of him on the night of the murder, entering the hospital and outside Blair's room.",
        "Dorian: I don't understand.",
        "David: Dorian, I was there.",
        "Dorian: That doesn't matter. I mean, he is not a -- a killer. Unless of course, he walked in on Spencer just as Spencer was about to rape Blair.",
        "David: Dorian, don't do this, please.",
        "Dorian: And even if he did do it, you should give him a medal, because he avenged your father's death, and he saved Blair's life.",
        "John: He didn't stick around for Blair. He made a run for it.",
        "Dorian: He wouldn't do that, not to one of my girls.",
        "David: Frankly, if it's between your girls and my freedom, it's no contest.",
        "Dorian: I dot believe you. And if you're the kind of law enforcement officer I think you are, you're not going to believe him, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: These clothes and everything, really -- it's too much, Asa.",
        "Asa: You're family, Nora. Family means everything to me.",
        "Nora: Thank you, Asa. Excuse me. David Vickers? Truman's murder.",
        "Asa: That's justice for you.",
        "Matthew: We'll see you, grandpa.",
        "Nora: Did you have another nightmare last night?",
        "Matthew: Yep.",
        "Nora: What was it this time?",
        "Matthew: The same. There was a fire. I'm on one side and everyone I know is on the other.",
        "Nora: Oh, man, it makes me so mad this creep has got you scared.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I'll be ok.",
        "Nora: You bet you will be, because your dad's going to get him and your mom's going to put him away.",
        "Matthew: What if it's too late?",
        "Nora: What do you mean? You mean if he starts some more fires?",
        "Matthew: No, I mean if he finds us and does it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, Lindsay . You know what? You were right -- what you were saying about what can and can't be replaced. I just -- I don't think that I've gotten that through to -- to Matthew yet.",
        "Lindsay: Well, that makes sense when you think about how small their worlds are. I mean, come on. For a kid, what -- it's home, school, sports field, mom, dad. You take a piece of that away and it feels like their little world is ending.",
        "Bo: Yeah. And you know what? He has been through more than any kid should ever have to go through.",

        "Bo: Well, yeah. You're Jen's mom.",
        "Lindsay: He really loved her.",
        "Bo: Yeah, and I think that's what's really -- really hard for him right now, because the movies that she made for him - - the videotapes -- they were destroyed in the fire.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, my God.",
        "Bo: So I think he's afraid that he's losing that connection that he had with Jen.",
        "Lindsay: I didn't even think about that. Are they still living at Asa's?",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah. They are, you know, house hunting right now. But at least they have a roof over their heads. I'd like to do more for them, but you know, the way things are with Nora and me --",
        "Lindsay: You are the best father anyone could ever ask for, ever.",
        "Bo: Well, thank you, Lindsay . I try, but, you know, it's sure nice to hear, and sometimes I think I need to hear.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, good. Could I be the one to tell you? Can I? Can I? Ok, I'm being downright silly now. I'm going to go and let you get back to work.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "Lindsay: Um -- take care.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Lindsay: Ok?",
        "Bo: See you later.",
        "Lindsay: Right.",
        "Bo: Mick?",
        "Mick: Yes, sir.",
        "Bo: Hey, did you finish running the arsonist's M. O. through the system?",
        "Mick: Yeah, but it came up empty.",
        "Bo: All right, stay on it, ok? And let's -- let's broaden the search. Let's not just limit ourselves to the tri-state area. Let's go national. Because this guy is good. I think he's been at it for a while. I don't think Llanview is his first stop.",

        "Natalie: We don't even talk when we're in the same room. I shouldn't be talking to you about this.",
        "Vincent: It's no secret that you and John have your issues.",
        "Natalie: I understand, but I shouldn't be talking about them with someone else.",
        "Vincent: I'm not sure that -- how do you know John doesn't do things behind your back?",
        "Natalie: You know, don't do this to me.",
        "Vincent: Do what?",
        "Natalie: Get me to talk like this, and you know, I don't even do this with my own friends.",
        "Vincent: Then you need better friends.",
        "Natalie: Or not. Look, just don't, ok?",
        "Vincent: Don't what, Natalie?",
        "Natalie: Don't get me to open up, all right?",
        "Vincent: You know, Nat, I'm sorry, ok? I thought that's what you wanted. I'll just leave.",
        "Natalie: Vincent, wait. Sorry, I just -- I'm all over the place. I'm kind of crazy right now, you know? It's like one minute, John goes out of town, doesn't tell me where he's going, and then he calls me and tells me that he misses me and that he wants to talk to me when he gets home, and --",
        "Vincent: And?",
        "Natalie: And now he probably won't want to talk to me, because of what I did. He might lose his job.",
        "Vincent: What the hell did you do, Nat?",
        "Natalie: I really screwed up big time, if you can believe that.",
        "Vincent: I probably can.",
        "Natalie: Well, you, yeah, probably.",
        "Vincent: Nat, so what? So what, McBain loses his job. He can get another job, but he cannot get another woman like you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, women who destroy your career are pretty hard to come by these days.",
        "Vincent: Maybe John needs to know what it feels like to be a little hungry.",
        "Natalie: You ever been hungry?",
        "Vincent: For sure. I mean, I haven't felt it in a while, but after this Cristian mess and the -- and these fires, maybe I need to be reminded of what that feels like. Make some changes. Hmm.",

        "Dorian: I would like to have a few moments alone with David, please.",
        "John: Suit yourself. If you need me, I'll be filing Vickers' signed confession.",

        "Marty: You're hurting now by not telling him.",
        "Jessica: Well, I just keep on wishing and hoping that these feelings for Nash will just go away.",
        "Marty: Jess, look, Nash knows that you love Antonio, right? And if this keeps up, it's not going to be long before Antonio figures out about Nash. He loves you, Jess. He's going to sense that something's wrong and he's going to figure it out, if he hasn't already.",
        "Jessica: Oh, God.",
        "Marty: Look, you need to talk to him before he finds out some other way.",

        "Nash: Yeah, we were in there for about five minutes. I don't know -- maybe more, maybe less. I don't remember.",

        "Nora: And when you find out what's happening with my insurance check, would you mind sharing it with me? My whole life is on hold. Oh, god. If you're here looking for Clint, he's not here.",
        "Lindsay: Actually, I'm here looking for you.",
        "Nora: Why?",
        "Lindsay: Well, I heard you lost everything in the fire, and I thought there might be something you need -- household items or clothes.",

        "Lindsay: Yes, I did. I brought something that I thought would make you feel a little better.",
        "Nora: What is it?",
        "Lindsay: Well, take a look. I had some copies of Jen's pictures made. And, oh, I had some videos transferred to DVD of hers. I know it's not, you know, exactly what you lost in the fire, but I thought it would be something.",
        "Matthew: Thank you so much, Mrs. Rappaport.",

        "Matthew: I'm going to go -- go look at them right now.",

        "Talia: I'm talking about where I was when I got hit in the head. I found footprints. And you know, the impressions are really faint, but from what I could tell, the wear pattern -- it was really unusual. I had pictures sent over to the lab for analysis. And dirt samples were taken to find traces of the accelerant, so --",
