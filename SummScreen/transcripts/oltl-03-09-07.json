        "Miles sits in a booth in the Palace Hotel dining room. Todd comes in, on the cell phone, and is very happy. When he join Viki, she wonders what is up with him. Todd tells Viki that today is Evangeline's birthday, and he had purchased her something really expensive. Blair stops by the table, and lets Todd know that she hopes that Evangeline is worth the trouble. Evangeline signs for a box at the police station. When she reads the tag, she sees it is from Todd. Evangeline is more than a little surprised when she sees it is a beautiful necklace. John has arrived back from his trip, and he lets Natalie know that David had killed Spencer. Asa talks to David in jail about his killing of Spencer. Asa tells David that he had spared the whole world. Antonio questions Nash if he wants to have an affair with Jessica. Jessica has a major dilemma -- she is in love with two men. Marty lets her know that she has to decide who she wants. Natalie wonders how John had put all this together. John promises to make it up to her. John gets a call on his cell phone. He searches through a drawer to find some papers, and finds something interesting. Blair continues to blast Todd for buying Evangeline an expensive present. Blair stops by Miles' table, and she offers to buy him a drink. Todd keeps looking at his cell phone, and Viki questions him if he is expecting a call. Evangeline hurries, and shuts the lid on the box just as Dorian walks up. Dorian asks Evangeline to have her office drop the charges against David. Asa questions David as to how he will get out of this. David can't get over how easy it is for Asa to pay to have a man killed. Nash hee-haws around and really doesn't answer Antonio's question if he is having an affair with Jessica. Jessica admits that she needs Marty's help. Marty tells Jessica to write down on a piece of paper who she really thinks of spending the rest of her life with. Jessica slowly writes down the name, and then folds it, and puts it in an envelope. Miles finds out from Blair about the hatred that she feels for Marty. Miles remembers Marty taking him home, and about him kissing her. Miles gets up to leave, telling Blair that he has something to do .Evangeline refuses to drop the charges against David. Asa questions David as to how many he had stabbed Spencer with the scissors. Nash tries to lead Antonio to believe that he cannot stand Jessica. John tells Natalie that he missed her. They begin to kiss, and he leads her to the bed.",
        "Miles leaves Blair to go to see Marty. Evangeline walks into the Palace dining room, and catches the eye of Blair, who becomes very upset when she sees the necklace that Evangeline is wearing. Evangeline walks over to Todd's table where Viki wishes her a Happy Birthday before departing. Todd is happy that Evangeline is wearing the necklace. Evangeline tells Todd that she cannot accept the necklace. After their lovemaking, Natalie confesses to John that she had told Bo about what she had done, concealing evidence. This statement leads to a big argument between John and Natalie. Miles speaks briefly to Jessica outside of Marty's door. Marty invites him in to her office. Miles proceeds to apologize to her for the kiss, but she thinks that it was just funny. Jessica sees Nash outside in the corridor, and she tells him that they need to go somewhere and talk."

        "Todd: So everything's all set? Guy's on his way? All right, you're a good man. Thanks.",
        "Viki: What's that all about?",
        "Todd: What's what all about?",
        "Viki: Well, the phone call and that really rather strange look on your face, sometimes called a smile.",
        "Todd: Oh, well, today is Evangeline Williamson's birthday and I got her a little something.",
        "Viki: Ah. How little?",
        "Todd: Uh -- it's a little huge and -- a little expensive.",
        "Blair: Really? Well, I certainly hope she's worth it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Just sign here, please.",
        "Evangeline: Uh -- ok. Thank you. Thank you, I guess.",
        "Evangeline: Todd. Oh. Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I didn't know you were coming back so soon.",
        "John: Obviously not.",
        "Natalie: No, what I mean is yesterday, you said you were going on some secret case and you didn't know when you'd be back. I just figured you'd be a while.",
        "John: Oh.",
        "Natalie: You're not upset about finding me with Vincent, are you?",
        "John: You're a big girl now, Natalie. I'm not going to tell you who to see or how to spend your time.",
        "Natalie: Ok, well, I guess -- I guess it's good for us if you get upset still. But there's nothing to be upset about. So, can you tell me where you went?",
        "John: Think I found Truman's killer.",
        "Natalie: Really? Who was it?",
        "John: David Vickers.",
        "Natalie: David killed him?",
        "John: He confessed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You've got the money, right? I mean, most people would come up with a cash flow excuse when I said that they needed to bring $10.5 million.",
        "Asa: I'm not one of those. You know, I had you pegged as a mama's Boy, but you proved what you're made of. That cockroach brother of yours needed to be exterminated. You saved the whole world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Are you having an affair with my wife?",
        "Nash: No, I'm not.",
        "Antonio: That actually sounded genuine.",
        "Nash: Well, it is.",
        "Antonio: Next question -- do you want to have an affair with Jessica?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I really have to do this, don't I? I have to choose between Antonio or Nash.",
        "Marty: Well, it isn't healthy for you to go around with these feelings of guilt.",
        "Jessica: I know, and I -- I am -- I feel awful. But the tricky thing is, I'm married to Antonio, but I have a child with Nash.",
        "Marty: Ok, so what's tricky -- your feelings of love or your feelings of obligation?",
        "Jessica: I love them Both, Marty.",
        "Marty: Well, you're going to have to choose which one you love more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Wow -- David killed his own brother. There goes the theory that blood's thicker than water.",
        "John: Whoever said that probably wasn't related to Truman.",
        "Natalie: So how'd you put this together? Professional elimination. Then all I had to do was track Vickers down.",
        "Natalie: And he confessed, just like that?",
        "John: Well, I used my powers of persuasion.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. Something tells me I don't want to know.",
        "John: I'm very charming when I want to be.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "John: Only thing is I -- I think this is all over. That's all that matters.",
        "Natalie: I just can't believe it. I mean, I should've known that it would've been someone like David.",
        "John: Instead of someone like me?",
        "Natalie: Oh, come on, John. It's not like I came up with that on my own. You had motive for days.",
        "John: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- did I just hear you say I was right about something?",
        "John: Yeah, you heard me say that, you know? I said I wanted to kill the guy, I -- you know, I tried a couple of times and it makes sense that you thought that I might've done it.",
        "Natalie: Well, I, you know, I think I'm -- I think I'm in a little shock here.",
        "John: I can imagine. I'll -- I'll make it up to you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah? How?",
        "John: Hmm. I got this. Timing.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "John: It's the -- it's the station. All right, look, don't go anywhere. Yeah, McBain. Yeah -- no, I have it right here. Uh -- yeah. No, I haven't finished my report yet. No, I'll be in later. I understand. All right, listen. I'll take care of that when I come in. Tell him everything's under control. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Stalker doesn't quite suit you, Blair.",
        "Viki: Todd, don't do that.",
        "Blair: It's all right, Viki. I started it.",
        "Todd: I guess you did.",
        "Viki: So, are you meeting somebody here?",
        "Blair: Yeah, Dorian, but for some reason, she stood me up.",
        "Todd: Oh. Sorry we missed her.",
        "Blair: So you're giving presents to Evangeline to blow her socks off. What happened to the old-fashioned way, Todd?",
        "Todd: Well, what do you care?",
        "Blair: I don't.",
        "Viki: How are you, Blair?",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm fine, Viki -- nothing an adult beverage won't help. Of course, I knew you'd drive me to drinking sooner or later. Miles?",
        "Miles: Hey, Blair. Hello.",
        "Blair: Ah. Hi. You look like you could use a -- a friend. Can I buy you a drink?",
        "Miles: Hmm. No.",
        "Viki: It really wouldn't kill you to be a little kinder to Blair.",
        "Todd: She's the one who ended it.",
        "Viki: But, obviously that wasn't an easy decision for her.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, I didn't get a choice, did I? So -- and I think I have the right to move on with my life.",
        "Viki: Are you expecting a call?",
        "Todd: Yeah -- Evangeline. Uh -- if the delivery guy did his job, she just got her present.",
        "Viki: I mean, is there something wrong? You're really obsessing about this present.",
        "Todd: No, I could just -- just see her. I think she's going to go crazy.",
        "Viki: I guess it was pretty extravagant, huh?",
        "Todd: Well, you know, she's been going through a tough time and I wanted to get her something that made her feel special.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Evangeline, I've been looking all over for you.",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Dorian: Ooh -- jewelry!",
        "Evangeline: Oh, no, hi, hi. Dorian, what can I do for you?",
        "Dorian: Nora's secretary told me that you are assisting her in David Vickers' murder case.",
        "Evangeline: Yes. Yes, I am.",
        "Dorian: What are you planning to do with him?",
        "Evangeline: Why don't you ask Nora?",
        "Dorian: Because I have always found her to be intractable, whereas I have found you to be intelligent -- forthright and quite reasonable.",
        "Evangeline: Uh -- thank you. Is there a question in there somewhere, Dorian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What would it take to get your department to drop murder charges against David?",
        "Asa: How -- how do you -- how do you plan on getting out of this?",
        "David: I'm not sure.",
        "Asa: How about you tell them that you stopped Spencer from trying to kill Blair?",
        "David: Well, that's true. I could do that.",
        "Asa: You know, Vickers, I kind of wish you'd held off a little bit, let, you know, Spencer finish his job.",
        "Asa: Oh, what the hell. What do I want -- you can't have everything, can you?",
        "David: Wow, this really is easy for you, isn't it, Asa? You paid to have a man killed and you're ok with that.",
        "Asa: You bet your damn life I am. The horrible things he did to my family, and waltzing around, having the gall to -- to say that I'm his father?",
        "David: Spencer didn't say those things without reason. Our mother led him to believe that it was the truth.",
        "Asa: Well, it was a bunch of bull. And what the hell is your mother talking about me on her death bed anyway?",
        "David: She was in love with you, Asa! You broke her heart.",
        "Asa: Well, that's all over. You and me, we got a deal. Well make sure you keep your big mouth shut. They all know you killed Spencer, but nobody's ever going to find out why.",
        "David: No, they won't. You were smart to hire me to kill Spencer, by the way, because if I had found out that someone else had done it, well, I'd have to seek revenge on them, wouldn't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You think I want to have an affair with Jessica?",
        "Antonio: I'm asking. You said to come out and ask, I'm asking. And given that I've gone out of my way to be decent to you, I expect you to be honest.",
        "Nash: You know -- having an affair with a married woman, Antonio, isn't exactly my idea of a good time.",
        "Antonio: Well, not in my book. But something's changed between you and Jess -- that's pretty damned obvious.",
        "Nash: I didn't want to have to say anything to you. But a relationship with Jessica is about the last thing in this world I'd want.",
        "Antonio: Yeah?",
        "Nash: Yeah. I can barely stand to be in the same room as her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I don't know which one I love more.",
        "Marty: You really don't?",
        "Jessica: Sometimes, you know, I know it's Antonio, but other times, I -- I just -- I don't know and I need your help because there's no one else I can talk to about this.",
        "Marty: Ok, ok. I'm going to make a suggestion. Now, you might not like it.",
        "Jessica: No, I trust you. I'll do whatever you ask.",
        "Marty: Ok. I want you to write down, without thinking, on this piece of paper, without weighing both sides, the name of the man you want to be with -- not the man you think you should be with, but the man that you see yourself spending the rest of your life with. Ok? Now, you don't have to show me what you write down at all, but you'll have your answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: There you go.",
        "Blair: Do not drink that.",
        "Miles: Why not?",
        "Blair: Because a man in your condition right now -- he needs carbs, carbs. Bring him a yogurt shake -- whole milk, vanilla yogurt, peanut butter, wheat germ, and honey. Also, tell the chef to make him a Cramer melt.",
        "Waiter: Cramer melt?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. He'll know exactly what I'm talking about. He's been making it for me for years. It's basically a tuna melt with jalapeno, horseradish, and tabasco. Miles, I know it sounds terrible, but if you can hold it down, I'm telling you, it works. And then take that back to the bartender, add a shot and a half of vodka, and bring it back to me. Thank you.",
        "Waiter: You've got it.",
        "Blair: All right. Trust me -- it works, really.",
        "Miles: Yeah, if I don't die first.",
        "Blair: Boy, you must've really tied one on.",
        "Miles: Well, it was the first time I've ever been drunk.",
        "Blair: Oh, it's your first hangover.",
        "Miles: Hmm.",
        "Blair: No, no fast moves here. You're just lucky that I'm here for you.",
        "Miles: Whew. Is the honey and the jalapenos really necessary?",
        "Blair: Essential. Over at Mrs. Davidson's table?",
        "Blair: Because that man she's sitting with is my ex-husband.",
        "Miles: Yeah, I don't think he likes me.",
        "Blair: He hates you. Why I'm sitting here.",
        "Miles: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Look at Blair over there with circus boy.",
        "Viki: You know, for somebody's who washed his hands of his protective of her.",
        "Todd: Well, she is the mother of my kids and I -- I certainly don't want to see the Laurence family do to -- do to her what they did Natalie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: You wouldn't be bribing me to drop the charges against David, would you?",
        "Dorian: \"Bribing\" -- bribery? Excuse me, I -- I -- I don't believe anybody here said anything about bribery. No, I just want to see justice done.",
        "Evangeline: Well, David confessed to killing his brother. There will be charges brought against him.",
        "Dorian: David is not going to be able to stand going back to prison again.",
        "Evangeline: David stabbed his brother to death with a pair of scissors and then he went and drank pina coladas on a beach. He's tougher than you think.",
        "Dorian: The DAs office has changed you, and not for the better.",
        "Evangeline: Dorian, David broke the law. Spencer Truman was reprehensible, but David took a man's life, and I'm sorry -- he's not going to get off with a slap on the wrist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa: Tell me -- how many times, how many times you get him with the scissors?",
        "David: I lost count.",
        "Asa: It must've surprised the hell out of old Spencer to find out his maker is his own brother.",
        "David: Well, I'm sure the irony wasn't lost on him.",
        "Asa: He underestimated you, Vickers. I didn't.",
        "David: About the money \u0096",
        "Asa: You'll get the money when you get out of here and keep your mouth shut. How can -- how can such a pretty boy be so tough?",
        "David: Not as tough as you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You don't like Jess?",
        "Nash: Can't stand her.",
        "Antonio: All right. You did a good job of pretending.",
        "Nash: Not really. Hey, you remember when she was trying to talk you out of giving me the job at Capricorn?",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: She's been a little unpredictable since her integration --",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: A little intense.",
        "Nash: \"Intense\"? She has been a major pain in my lower region --",
        "Antonio: Oh, come on --",
        "Nash: All the time, relentlessly. All right, look, Jessica -- Jessica dislikes me as much as I dislike her.",
        "Antonio: So why didn't you say something?",
        "Nash: I guess I didn't want to speak poorly of your wife in front of you.",
        "Antonio: Oh, come on, Nash. You could've at least said not to throw you together. I mean, come on. I -- I just suggested that you go stay with her and the kids to help take care of them.",
        "Nash: Yeah, it wasn't one of your brighter ideas. Look, look, Jessica is Bree's mother and I am doing the best I can to get along with her, all right?",
        "Antonio: You know, Jess -- Jess is an amazing woman. I'm just -- just sorry that you haven't seen her best side.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: I've just been working so much, I've taken for granted that she's recovered.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I look at Jessica, I see Tess and Jessica knows that, she resents that. Come on, you must've noticed she's in my face a lot.",
        "Antonio: Oh, you know, Jess hasn't always been this way. I mean, come on, she's always -- almost always been too nice. You know, maybe she's trying to find a happy medium. Wait a second -- you haven't seen Tess, have you?",
        "Nash: No.",
        "Antonio: I'm serious because, you know, Jess might be trying to push you away because she's afraid of Tess coming back.",
        "Nash: No. Whatever's going on with Jessica is 100% pure Jessica. Tess doesn't factor at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Ok, so why do I have to write it down again?",
        "Marty: Well, ok. So sometimes when you say something out loud to somebody else, you might censor yourself. When you write it down, even to yourself, you tend to be more honest.",
        "Jessica: It's just -- it's complicated.",
        "Marty: Well, it's painful. But it's actually very simple.",
        "Jessica: But what it means, Marty --",
        "Marty: Write down a name. Jess, you can do it, ok? I will give you an envelope, we will take it, we will seal it, we will put it in the envelope and put it away. And hopefully, you know, when you're ready, you can open the envelope and you can act on what you've written down.",
        "Jessica: But that means that I'm going to have to hurt somebody and I'm going to have to lose somebody.",
        "Marty: Is it any worse than the way you're living your life right now?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I really don't, I don't know.",
        "Marty: Jessica, tell yourself who you choose, and then -- and then just see how you feel about it after.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hmm, and then the room started spinning round and round.",
        "Miles: Right, all of a sudden.",
        "Blair: Well, eventually you'll develop this, like, internal clock like -\"beep, beep, beep, beep, slow down, stop drinking, stop drinking!\"",
        "Miles: I hope so. Blair? You probably shouldn't drink alone, either. Hmm, I wasn't alone.",
        "Blair: Really? Did she get as drunk as you did?",
        "Miles: No. She only had one glass of wine -- civilized, like in the movies. Your friend Marty Saybrooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Ok, so what would be the appropriate reaction to seeing the mother of your kids becoming familiar with Mitch Laurence's brother, and who also thinks that Spencer is God?",
        "Viki: Blair could change her mind about what she wants",
        "Todd: One second. So what do you think? Oh, you love it, don't you? I'm at The Palace.",
        "Evangeline: I'm going to be there in a couple of minutes, ok?",
        "Todd: Ok. She loves it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What the hell were you guys arguing about last night in the hallway?",
        "Nash: You should ask your wife.",
        "Antonio: No, I did. I did. She said that you were still reacting to -- to almost dying in the fire.",
        "Nash: Huh. No, that's not quite it. She was angry at me for not having gotten her out of there, because if I had, then you wouldn't have gotten hurt, princess.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. That doesn't sound like Jess.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I know. You see what I'm talking about? She's all over me all the time, anything I do. We try to cooperate because of Bree, but we just can't stand each other, all right?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, I get it.",
        "Nash: You do?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, uh -- before when you were with Jessica and you didn't see Tess you could handle it, but now when you see Jessica, it's not quite as clear, is it?",
        "Nash: No. It's not too clear. It's not clear at all, Antonio.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Uh -- You know, just because I choose one doesn't automatically mean that I'm going to stop having feelings for the other one.",
        "Marty: No. No, you're right, but sometimes when you commit to something even in your head, the situation gets clearer. Write down the name of the person you love most, ok? And see if the person that you love heart and soul is the person that you choose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So you were really boozing it up with Marty Saybrooke last night, huh?",
        "Miles: Huh. Well, I was the only one Boozing. She was trying to talk sense into me so I wouldn't buy a round for everybody in the bar.",
        "Blair: Ah, that's just so Marty -- all sweet and noble, thinking of other people.",
        "Miles: Oh. How do you know her?",
        "Blair: Oh, I think we should save that for another day when you're not nursing a hangover.",
        "Miles: Hmm. Small town, I guess everybody knows everybody.",
        "Blair: Yeah, unfortunately.",
        "Miles: You know, I grew up alone, so -- because of the way I looked. I'm hoping that changes in Llanview.",
        "Blair: You planning on sticking around?",
        "Miles: Yeah. I have a niece here in town -- Jessica Vega?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Miles: She's my only family.",
        "Blair: She's a good person.",
        "Miles: Yeah. And Marty Saybrooke's my friend and hopefully maybe you, too.",
        "Blair: You know, Miles, if you're going to stick around Llanview, I think you need to watch who you become friends with.",
        "Miles: Hmm. I -- why -- why do you dislike Marty?",
        "Blair: Did I say that?",
        "Miles: Well, you didn't have to. I was there in the office when you stormed in with her son. I mean, she's always been so nice to me.",
        "Blair: Sure.",
        "Miles: And I have this vague memory of her helping me up the stairs into my room last night.",
        "Blair: You didn't have pass out, did you?",
        "Blair: What happened?",
        "Miles: Oh, no.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Miles: I have to go.",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "Miles: Oh, I did something last night, something that's not cool.",
        "Blair: Oh -- don't worry about Marty. I'm sure she won't hold it against you. In fact, you probably gave her something that she liked --",
        "Miles: Oh.",
        "Blair: Another reason to suffer.",
        "Miles: I hope not.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Miles: Thanks for the sandwich. It made my stomach feel a lot better.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So, how do you feel?",
        "Jessica: The same. Except I know what I have to do now.",
        "Marty: Well, that's good. I was hoping -- I was hoping for that.",
        "Jessica: But you were right. Saying it to yourself is one thing, but saying it out loud is a whole different story.",
        "Marty: Well, you have the truth now, so you need to start living it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Look, you wanted to know if I'm having an affair with Jessica, and I'm not. All right? My daughter, Bree, would be an orphan right now if you hadn't gotten us out of that fire. I owe you.",
        "Antonio: All right. So there's nothing going on between you and Jess.",
        "Nash: Nothing good. I'll see you around, all right?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I'll see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ok. Ok, I know you want to say something.",
        "Natalie: I -- I think I know why Bo wants to see you.",
        "John: Oh, yeah?",
        "Natalie: I told him that I tampered with the evidence because I thought you killed Spencer and I was trying to protect you.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "Natalie: It's just that it accidentally came out that you knew.",
        "John: What? What?",
        "Natalie: John, I'm sorry. I wanted to wait for you, but I didn't know where you were going or when you were coming back here.",
        "John: Oh, son of a --",
        "Natalie: And I didn't -- I didn't know how much it Bothered me to keep it from Bo. I -- I didn't mean to bring you into it. It just slipped out and then he was all over it.",
        "John: I wasn't just trying to cover for you, I was protecting Mike!",
        "Natalie: Right, until you knew that he killed Spencer and --",
        "John: You promised you weren't going to do this ever again! You promised!",
        "Natalie: It's on me, all right? I'll make sure Bo knows that.",
        "John: Why couldn't you just wait till I got back, huh? We could have talked to him together.",
        "Natalie: Because the way things were between us, I wasn't so sure that you were coming back.",
        "John: Oh, what'd you think I was going to do, just skip town?",
        "Natalie: Well, I never know what you're going to do anymore.",
        "John: Hey, lady, I have never walked out on my responsibilities, never!",
        "Natalie: Oh, really? So that's what I am to you? I thought I was your girlfriend.",
        "John: Oh, semantics, you know? What am I supposed to tell Bo now, huh?",
        "Natalie: You'll be fine. All right? He -- he knows that the only problem that you have is me, and Bo fixed that. He -- he kicked me out of the forensics program, and -- I still have my desk job, but I'm sure I'm probably going to lose that, too, so in terms of your life at the LPD, I'm no longer an issue.",
        "John: After everything that's happened, I can't believe you did this again.",
        "Natalie: I don't know what you're so worried about, John. I mean, you cracked the Truman case. You got David Vickers to confess. They'll probably decorate you. It's not like you're going to be stuck behind some desk.",
        "John: He could have fired you.",
        "Natalie: He will. I mean, come on, Bo's my uncle. He just didn't want to destroy my life all at once.",
        "John: We had this handled. Why the rush to tell Bo, huh?",
        "Natalie: Because Vincent thought that it would make me feel better.",
        "John: Who? Vincent? You talked about my life with him? With that scum?",
        "Natalie: Look, I didn't give him any details, all right? He was just trying to be a good friend to me.",
        "John: How do I end up in these messes, huh? Hey, you know what? Fine. Do whatever the hell you want, all right? Just don't talk about my life with him, you understand?",
        "Natalie: You know who I really want to talk to? I want to talk to --",
        "John: No -- you know what you want? You know what you want? You want some guy that's going to take on everything you're dishing and not give it back to you. That's what you want. Guess what, Natalie -- that'll never be me, ever!",

        "Nigel: The sun's not over the yardarm yet, sir.",

        "Asa: One of these days, I'm going to pension you off.",
        "Nigel: Well, before I go, I'll make you tonics and bitters with lime.",
        "Asa: Oh, goody.",
        "Nigel: One question, sir.",

        "Dorian: Thank you. He's very polite.",
        "David: Yeah, we bonded when Spencer was in here. He's actually talked about bringing me a cake with a file in it.",
        "Dorian: David, I am getting you the best attorney that money can buy. When you killed Spencer, you were saving Blair's life, so how can that be a crime?",
        "David: You know, I do seem to recall that the penal code states that any action taken on behalf of a Cramer is legal. Encouraged, even.",
        "Dorian: See? You haven't lost your sense of humor -- good. Now I know we're going to get you out of this, for sure.",
        "David: Don't do that.",

        "Miles: Really? I heard you were caught in the fire at Capricorn.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, just a little smoke inhalation. Actually, Antonio -- the poor guy -- he's still at the hospital.",
        "Miles: He was a hero.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, he's always been mine. Anyways, I'm sorry that, you know, your first night out at a club was a total disaster.",
        "Miles: Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, since then, I've had a few firsts that turned out to be disasters, too.",

        "Miles: I hope I didn't offend you. Because I enjoy spending time with you.",
        "Marty: Oh. Well, thank you.",
        "Miles: I mean, you're the only person in town who gave Spencer the benefit of the doubt --",
        "Marty: No, no, I -- huh -- I rendered a professional opinion about Spencer, ok? We were not friendly. The man held me hostage and threatened to kill me.",
        "Miles: Yeah. You know what? I'm blowing this. I didn't come here to speak about Spencer. My memory of last night's pretty patchy. But one of the patches I do remember is kissing you. And I'm -- I'm sorry.",

        "Nash: You seem upset.",
        "Jessica: I am. I'm -- really upset, actually. Um -- um -- I -- I think that we should go somewhere and talk in private, seriously about a few things.",
        "Nash: I just talked to Antonio. I'm pretty sure he's on to us.",
        "Jessica: Oh, that's great. That's just -- it's perfect. What have we done?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: I'm referring to the fact that you could have hired some anonymous hit man to do your dirty work, as you have so many times in the past. Why turn to the victim's own brother?",
        "Asa: Oh, that. That was a test.",
        "Nigel: Of what, sir?",
