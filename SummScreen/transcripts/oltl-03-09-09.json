        "Shane: Sorry.",
        "Gigi: It's better that you remember now than have an attack in the middle of the night. We'll be home in a minute. We'll run in, we'll say hi to Rex and Stacy, we'll grab the inhaler, and run out.",

        "Rex: You did? Well, it wasn't like that exactly.",

        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Starr: Cole? It's Starr. You know what? Fine. Ignore my calls. Just let it roll to voicemail. I know you don't want to hear what I have to say, but you're going to have to hear it. Okay, you are completely out of control. What the hell were you thinking? You ratted out Mr. Joplin because you saw us kissing and you outed him because he used to do drugs when you can't stop doing them? I just hope you're happy now. You got back at me and you might have cost Mr. Joplin his job. I -- I just want you to know that I don't care about what happens to you anymore.",

        "Lola: Papi gave me extra. He wanted me to make sure I had a good time tonight.",
        "Markko: You know what? I'll just have Carlotta take it out of my check. So, pretty crazy what happened at the dance, huh?",
        "Langston: You mean Cole freaking out and attacking Mr. J.?",

        "Todd: What are you doing here?",
        "Dorian: I called Bo on the way over here. Bo, arrest him. He stabbed Blair.",
        "Todd: That's a lie. She's lying.",
        "Dorian: I found Blair lying bleeding and unconscious on her bathroom floor. And when I looked up, there he was. Thank heaven that the boys are in Savannah with their grandmother and Cass\u00ede and they did not have to see their father try and murder their mother.",

        "Gigi: I'm fine, but he can't breathe.",
        "John: Okay. Hey, all right, listen -- I'm at the scene of an MVC. It's two cars, at least two victims. I'm not sure how many more. At least one with respiratory distress. Listen, I've got these guys. Go see if the people in the other car need any help. Hey, what happened?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. This car started coming at me, head on. I couldn't get out of the way. He needs an inhaler and we can't get out of the car.",
        "Marty: Cole??",
        "Gigi: I can't get out. My damned seatbelt is jammed. Shane's having an asthma attack and we don't have his inhaler. He can't breathe without it.",
        "[Shane gasping for air]",
        "Gigi: We were on our way back to the house to go get it. Oh God, John, he's getting worse.",
        "John: Okay, listen to me. Help is coming, Gigi, all right? You've got to try to stay calm. Try to keep Shane calm, all right? The ambulance will be here any minute.",
        "Gigi: Do you hear that, baby? The ambulance is coming, okay? They're going to help you. So please just hang in there. Can you do that for me, baby?",
        "John: Hey, Shane, you okay there, buddy? You hang in there, all right?",
        "Gigi: It'll be okay, okay?",
        "John: Gigi, do me a favor. Pop the trunk, all right? See if you can pop the trunk.",
        "[Shane gasping]",
        "Gigi: It won't open.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Am I sure my relationship with Gigi is the real thing? She and Shane, they're my world, Stacy.",
        "Stacy: I was just testing, that's all. Got to look out for my sis, you know. I guess I was just wondering, you know, why you married Adriana in the first place. Sorry, off-switch malfunction again.",
        "Rex: It's a fair question.",
        "Stacy: Hey, but it's none of my business. I mean, what do I know about relationships? My last one totally flamed out.",
        "Rex: What happened?",
        "Stacy: I expected this guy to just fill this big old hole I had in my heart, and that's impossible because the only one who can do that's the one who put it there in the first place. Right?",
        "Rex: Well, I don't know. You know, I mean, you find someone new, you move on.",
        "Stacy: How can you do that when you can't get past your first love?",

        "Marty: Come here. Can I give you a cuddle? My beautiful boy.",
        "[Cole gasping]",
        "Cole: I can't move. Am I going to die?",
        "Marty: Not a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You were told to go home, Starr.",
        "Starr: I know, I -- I had to see how you were. What did Ms. Dickinson say? I mean, are they going to punish you? Did you tell them that the kiss was my idea?",
        "Schuyler: I've been suspended from teaching indefinitely, without pay. The board of Ed is launching an investigation into my past drug use, and I've been required to give an account of every private moment I've ever had with you. That's how I'm doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I was looking for Blair and, uh -- I went into her bedroom. And there she was, lying on the floor in the bathroom. And the shower was still running and Dorian was there. She was going nuts.",
        "Joe: What were you doing there?",
        "Todd: Who the hell are you? Where's Vega?",
        "Talia: Antonio is out of town on assignment, okay? This guy's my temporary partner. Isn't there a restraining order against you? Aren't you supposed to stay away from that house?",
        "Bo: Manning? Why were you there?",
        "Todd: I went to talk to Blair about something. You know, you guys can't keep me out of there.",
        "Bo: Well, the restraining order says you stay away from Blair, too.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bo: Buchanan. What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "ER Nurse: Blood pressure's still 70 over 40.",
        "Michael: She's still losing too much blood. Get me some gauze. I want those IVs full open.",
        "ER Nurse: BP's rising, 85 over 50.",
        "ER Doctor: Lungs seem clear.",
        "Michael: We need more gauze.",
        "ER Nurse: Pulse down, 130 to 120.",
        "Michael: Okay, all right --",
        "ER Nurse: BP's 110 over 70.",
        "Michael: That's good enough for the OR.",
        "Michael: Yeah, this is Dr. McBain. Tell them Blair Cramer's on her way up as soon as we get some films. And alert the blood bank that we're going to need six more units of packed cells.",
        "Dorian: Honey, please hang in. You listen to me, Blair. Listen, honey, and listen very carefully. You're going to come through this. Do you hear me? And you are going to be there to raise those three beautiful children. Nobody and nothing is ever going to harm you again. And nobody and nothing is going to take you away from us. You hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Sahid? There's a big accident out on Route 3, multi-car. Gigi Morasco was involved in that. She had her son Shane with her. Now, that's Balsom's son. Now, I don't know how bad it is.",
        "Talia: Okay, well, go. We'll stay. We'll make sure that Manning doesn't cause any trouble.",
        "Bo: I want you to lean on Manning, see what you can find out about Blair, all right?",
        "Talia: Okay, sir. I'll keep you posted.",
        "Bo: Thank you. Hey, Nora, it's Bo. Look, I know I said I was going to pick up Matthew, but we have a job situation. I'm going to have to take care of it. So can you pick him up, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: John, are you getting anywhere? Because I don't think --",
        "John: Hang on.",
        "Gigi: Thank God. Oh, baby, you're getting out of here. You're going to be okay.",
        "John: Take it easy, I've got you. I've got you.",
        "[Shane gasping]",
        "John: I'll get you next, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Don't worry about me. Just take care of my baby.",
        "Cole: Mom, am I okay?",
        "Marty: Yes. You will be. I'm here now and I'm going to make sure of it.",
        "[Cole gasping rapidly]",
        "Cole: Mom, I can't -- it hurts. I'm going to die.",
        "Marty: No, no. Listen to me. You are not going to die.",
        "Cole: Oh God, oh God.",
        "Marty: Try not to move, try not to move.",
        "Cole: My legs hurt so bad.",
        "Marty: Okay, listen to me. Son, you are my son. You are my son, and I'm here. And I'm going to take care of you. Stick with me, you hear me?",
        "Marty: [Screaming] John! John! Help me save my son!",
        "[Marty screaming]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Some first loves are harder to get over, especially those love at first sight ones.",
        "Rex: Well, I hate to break it to you, Stacy. But the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy -- it's the same as love at first sight. Or else there wouldn't be a me and Gigi, or a Shane. Or you sitting here drinking a beer with me.",
        "Rex: What's in this stuff?",
        "Stacy: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Either this is a really strong brew or I'm --",
        "Stacy: You're what?",
        "Rex: I don't know -- wasted.",
        "Stacy: Well, I think it's probably just hitting you more because you've had a lot of stress lately. But it's okay. You go ahead. You drink up. So why aren't you and Gigi married?",
        "Rex: Uh, we're going to. We're just waiting.",
        "Stacy: For what? For your divorce to be final?",
        "Rex: We just want to make sure everything is okay. We've got Shane. We've got some money issues to deal with.",
        "Stacy: Or it's something else?",
        "Rex: Like what else?",
        "Stacy: Maybe you're afraid of screwing it up like you did with Adriana.",
        "Rex: That's -- no, no. That's not it.",
        "Stacy: Or maybe she's the wrong girl and you know it.",
        "Rex: What did you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I can't believe they're going to do this. I got you into so much trouble. I am so, so sorry.",
        "Schuyler: Starr, it's not you, it's not Cole.",
        "Starr: But if Cole hadn't have come at you like that, if he wasn't as messed up as he was --",
        "Schuyler: I did this. I let you into my life. They were right to suspend me. I have nobody to blame but myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You shouldn't jump to any conclusions. We don't know what really happened between Starr and Mr. J.",
        "Markko: Uh, yeah, we do. She told Mrs. Dickinson she kissed him.",
        "Langston: Okay, but we weren't there.",
        "Markko: So you think Starr was lying?",
        "Langston: I don't know. I just think there's more to it.",
        "Lola: Like she wasn't thinking clearly.",
        "Langston: Exactly. Starr feels close to Mr. J. because of what happened with their parents and maybe he just took advantage of that.",
        "Markko: Then why wouldn't she say that?",
        "Langston: To protect him, making a pass at a student? Dickinson would have to call the police.",
        "Markko: Well, forget about the police. What if she calls Starr's dad?",
        "Langston: Remember when he threatened to turn you into carne asada?",
        "Markko: Better hide the cutlery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: So your ex-wife, whom you were arguing with earlier, gets a knife in her back but you had nothing to do with it. Have I got that right?",
        "Todd: What I just don't understand is why am I getting the third degree here? I mean, the person that supposedly found Blair was her aunt. Why aren't you questioning Dorian?",
        "Joe: Her aunt didn't have a restraining order on her.",
        "Todd: Where did you get this guy?",
        "Talia: Dr. Lord did not stab Blair.",
        "Todd: Neither did I.",
        "Joe: All right, don't take another step.",
        "ER Nurse: Dr. McBain, there's a problem with OR 1.",
        "Talia: Blair, Blair? Can you tell me who did this to you?",
        "Dorian: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Michael: She's coding, give me a defib, quick!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: John!",
        "John: I'm right here, Marty. Hang on, hang on, Cole.",
        "Gigi: He's having -- he needs an inhaler.",
        "EMT: We've got one, ma'am.",
        "Bo: Marty? He's okay, Marty. He's okay. His legs were pinned underneath the car.",
        "EMT: We have to do a head-to-toe survey, okay?",
        "Marty: Are you all right?",
        "EMT: Ma'am, you need to move back.",
        "Marty: I'm not going anywhere, he's my son.",
        "Bo: I'm going to check on Gigi and Shane.",
        "Marty: Honey, it's your mother. I'm here, I love you so much. I love you. I'm not going anywhere, never again. Never again. Do you hear me? Stay with me. Stay with me, I love you",
        "Marty: Now, Cole, okay, they're taking care of you. You'll be fine, just fine.",
        "Bo: Are you okay?",
        "Gigi: We are now. How's Cole?",
        "Bo: I think his mother just saved his life.",
        "Cole: Mom? Is that really you? You're not dead?",
        "Marty: No, no. No, honey, I'm right here.",
        "Cole: Don't go. Don't leave. Where are you?",
        "Marty: No, no, no, honey. Honey, stay with me, stay awake. Cole, stay awake! Cole, stay with me! Can you hear me? Cole? I don't think he's breathing.",
        "John: What's going on -- he's bleeding out?",
        "Marty: I don't think is from the crash. I think he just OD'd!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: It was bound to come out eventually -- that I was into drugs.",
        "Starr: But it was because of me and it was because I told Cole.",
        "Schuyler: No, I should've been upfront with the school board. And -- I shouldn't have told a student.",
        "Starr: Wait a second -- I'm not just a student. I'm your friend.",
        "Schuyler: I'm not supposed to be your friend, Starr.",
        "Starr: But you've helped me through so much. I was a total mess.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, you were a total mess and that's a perfect reason for why I needed to maintain boundaries. The reason that kiss happened was because I didn't.",
        "Starr: There is a connection between us -- you can't just say that there isn't.",
        "Schuyler: Well, if there is, then I shouldn't be a teacher.",
        "Starr: You felt something, too, Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: My name is Mr. Joplin. I'm your teacher, not your friend, and if you're looking for something more, then you and I can never be in the same place alone ever again.",

        "[Alarm beeps]",
        "Doctor: We have a normal sinus rhythm.",
        "Michael: All right, that's as good as we're going to get. Somebody hold that elevator; tell them we're coming upstairs. Let's go.",
        "Nurse: Go.",
        "Todd: I just want to see her.",
        "Joe: You're not getting near her.",
        "Talia: Lucky for you she crashed before she ID'd you as her assailant.",
        "Todd: What is this -- you're already convicting me?",
        "Talia: No, I'll leave that up to the judge and jury. Come on.",
        "Todd: No, get your hands off me.",
        "Talia: I'm taking you downtown with Joe to get your full statement.",
        "Todd: Well, you're going to have to shoot me first then.",

        "EMT: It's shallow but it's non-responsive.",
        "John: You think he took something?",
        "Marty: I'm sure of it -- I'm a doctor. Central line, that's great because we need it right now. I don't know what he's got in him, but his pupils are pinpoint so we need to push in some naloxone.",
        "Marty: Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go. Come on, come on, stay with me. Stay with me, Cole. Come on, come on back to me. Come on, here we go.",

        "Rex: You were a kid -- how would you know that?",

        "Rex: Well, I guess I was a nice guy, sometimes.",
        "Stacy: No, you were -- you are, you're the best. Just kind of a coincidence that you ended up with Gigi when I was the one who met you first. How are you feeling?",

All right, they're going to -- they're going to pass what's called an NG tube and they're going to pass it down through your nose and into your stomach, okay? They're just going to flush out those pills, honey. Okay?",
