        "Marty does not have a chance to get around to telling John that she is pregnant. And she overhears him talking to Oliver about whether Oliver is ready to be a father. Oliver has mixed feelings about whether he wants to claim Sierra as his daughter if the test results confirm that she is. Clint tells Kim that he will not marry her nor raise the baby with her unless she signs the pre-nup. At first, she hasn't a clue what to do. But Stacy's ghost tells her she must find a way to sign it so she can raise Stacy's baby. Allison Perkins is spying upon both Bree and Shane and takes both of their pictures to give to Mitch."

        "Eli: All right, guys, we are good to go. My assistant is drawing up the petition for full custody of your niece Sierra Rose. Just gonna swing by the office, pick up the documents, file them with the court before the deadline. So, we'll speak soon.",
        "Rex: You okay about this?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Rex: I meant what I said. You're doing the right thing, Morasco.",
        "Gigi: I know. I will be a better parent to Sierra Rose than Schuyler ever could be. Even if I have to be both mommy and dad to that baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: You don't want me to destroy the DNA results?",
        "Oliver: I went to the hospital earlier and I saw her.",
        "Kyle: Sierra?",
        "Oliver: She's getting stronger every minute.",
        "Kyle: Baby's a fighter, just like somebody else I know.",
        "Oliver: I just want her to be all right.",
        "Kyle: She had the surgery, so there's a really good chance--",
        "Oliver: No, it's more than that, you know? I did everything I could to protect that baby when Stacy was carrying her. I mean, even before I knew if she could be--",
        "Kyle: Could be yours? So, you're--you're saying you're ready to find out whether or not you're Sierra's father?",
        "Oliver: Give it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So, if you want Stacy's baby to be raised as a Buchanan, sign the pre- nup so we can get married and get the ball rolling. Of course, I wouldn't want you to sign anything without reading it first. Then you can have a lawyer look it over if you wish, but I'm telling you, this is the final draft. There's no negotiating. I think it's a pretty good deal, if I do say so myself. So, miss Andrews, it's all up to you. I'll be getting back to you.",
        "[Kim sighs]",
        "Kim: \"Whereas the parties are about to contract marriage--\" what does that mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Look at that.",
        "Carlotta: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Cris'll love it.",
        "Carlotta: Beautiful, huh?",
        "Layla: Yes. I just stopped by lhs to bring him his lunch, but mostly I wanted to wish him luck on his first day of school.",
        "Carlotta: He doesn't need any more luck. I tell you, I am so happy with the way things have turned out for my son. I mean, he's got a brand-new, great teaching career and a beautiful woman who cares about him.",
        "Layla: Hmm. Make that two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: And remember, I want a paper on your favorite artist by Friday. Jess?",
        "Jessica: Yes, Mr. Vega?",
        "Cristian: Class is dismissed.",
        "Jessica: I know. I was hoping that you can give me something for extra credit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hi, Bree.",
        "Bree: Do you know where my mommy is?",
        "Natalie: Um, yes. She's upstairs resting, sweetheart.",
        "Viki: Tell you what. Let's go in your tent, okay, and I'm gonna get your coloring book. Here we go. And I want you to color me a really pretty picture, and then you show it to me, okay? There you go. So. Where were you just now, hmm?",
        "Natalie: Right here.",
        "Viki: Really. You were a million miles away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, I would love to stay but I gotta do some laundry.",
        "John: What was that all about? Something you want to tell me? Does...this have to do with you not feeling well?",
        "Marty: You know, as a matter of fact, it does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Whatever the DNA test says, I'll deal with it.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, well, there's nothing to deal with if it says I'm not the father of Stacy's baby.",
        "Kyle: I'm just saying if you are...I'm not going anywhere. I'll support whatever decision you make, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: I--I need to get some air.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Thanks.",
        "Busboy: Need anything else?",
        "Stacy's voice: You are such a dog.",
        "Busboy: Ma'am, do you need anything else?",
        "Stacy's voice: Stop mentally undressing every good-looking guy you see.",
        "Kim: What can I say? It's been a really long time since I've had sex.",
        "Stacy's voice: Yeah, you and me both. Look, just don't get distracted, okay? You still have to sign that form so you can marry Clint and raise my little girl.",
        "Kim: Sign it? I can barely read it!",
        "Stacy's voice: It's a pre-nup. It just says, \"Blah, blah, blah, you get zilch if you divorce Clint.\"",
        "Kim: Zilch? As in nothing? Does it really say that?",
        "Stacy's voice: Probably. Just stay married to the guy and you'll never have to find that out.",
        "Kim: Oh, yeah, right. After the \"I do's\", we'll just live happily ever after.",
        "Stacy's voice: Why not?",
        "Kim: Are you serious? Name one couple you know that's stayed together forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: Okay. Let me get this straight. Jessica thinks Cristian is still her boyfriend?",
        "Layla: For her, it's like no time has passed since high school. She hasn't even graduated yet. In her mind, she's still a teenager. And in her heart, she and Cristian are still star-crossed lovers.",
        "Carlotta: How heartbreaking for her.",
        "Layla: Oh, no, Jessica's not heartbroken. More like on a mission to get her boyfriend back.",
        "Carlotta: Does Cristian know this?",
        "Layla: Cristian's handling it. She showed up at our apartment and he made it clear to her that we are together now. I don't think she'll be making any more surprise visits.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Jessica, I just gave out my first assignment. There is no extra credit.",
        "Jessica: Too bad.",
        "Cristian: Look, you gotta understand that I'm a teacher here now and I am not going to...fraternize with my students.",
        "Jessica: I'm just trying to get caught up with everything.",
        "Cristian: You're sure that's all it is?",
        "Jessica: You know, all of the other students are okay with me being here. The only person that isn't is you.",
        "Cristian: You know, I need to work on my lesson plan for tomorrow, so you probably should go home now.",
        "Jessica: I should get working on my assignment. A page on my favorite artist. Hmm. Shouldn't be too hard to come up with 200 words on Cristian Vega.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I was--I was just daydreaming.",
        "Viki: Ah. I heard that John McBain has been reinstated at the police station. Hmm.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, and he was--he was here earlier. He wanted to ask Jess some questions about the shooting.",
        "Viki: Oh. Is that all he wanted?",
        "Bree: I dropped bunny and I want her to go in my tent.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Well, I'll--I'll go get her for you.",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Viki: Hello?",
        "Cristian: Hi, Viki. This is Cristian. I was wondering if we could meet. I need to talk to you.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Natalie: Ooh.",
        "Roxy: I gotta talk to you pronto.",
        "Viki: What's up? Hello.",
        "Roxy: Hey, Vik, I'd love to chit-chat, but I got to talk to my kid. I mean, our kid.",
        "Viki: Yes. Honey, do me--",
        "Roxy: In private.",
        "Viki: Do me a favor. I have to go out. Would you please stay with Bree while I'm gone?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, of course. Is everything okay?",
        "Viki: Yep.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Roxy: Anybody else here?",
        "Natalie: Uh, no. It's just me and Bree. What is the emergency, Rox?",
        "Roxy: What's up with you and Johnny McBain?",
        "Natalie: Me and John? Nothing.",
        "Roxy: That's not what I hear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Uh. I'm okay. I just-- it--um--Roxy saw what I had in the pharmacy bag, so she figured out.",
        "John: What? You're not feeling well?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: Oh, wait. I--I almost forgot. This--this might help. Chicken soup as promised.",
        "Marty: Thank you. That was thoughtful.",
        "John: No, I just--I stopped by the diner on the way back from Llanfair.",
        "Marty: Llanfair?",
        "John: Yeah. I needed to talk to Jessica about the shooting and...I saw Natalie. She told me that Jessica was still a little out of it. She was resting.",
        "Marty: Did she?",
        "John: Marty--",
        "Marty: No, you know what? I don't want to talk about Natalie. I don't. You said you want--you know, you want to see where our relationship could go, and so do I. But that also made me realize that there's a lot I don't know about you.",
        "John: You know everything that's fit to print.",
        "Marty: Yeah. But I--I mean, we've never really even talked about what we want. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. I have no idea what you honestly see for us in the future.",
        "John: Is this...things like marriage? Family?",
        "Marty: Yes. Yeah. Exactly like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I thought you said I've been drinking too much coffee.",
        "Rex: It's tea. Variety's the spice of life, right? But it will keep you on your feet long enough to ensure that Schuyler never gets his hands on that baby in there.",
        "Gigi: You really unloaded on him earlier.",
        "Rex: Yeah, well, right now, that jerk is front of an ethics committee to answer charges about stealing a drug that he might've used on Stacy. He has no business raising a kid. What?",
        "Gigi: Don't get me wrong. I am totally grateful to you for being here.",
        "Rex: But?",
        "Gigi: Are you sure you want to be in the middle of this mess? I mean, it could get ugly and personal.",
        "Shane: Surprise.",
        "Gigi: Shane.",
        "Shane: Don't be mad. I made Moe bring me here after school.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no, no, I'm not mad. It must be hard for you with me here around the clock, and your dad, too.",
        "Shane: I'm fine. I just wanted to see my new sister. Cousin. I can't get used to that. All this time, I thought I was gonna be a brother.",
        "Gigi: You might still get that chance. I want to adopt Aunt Stacy's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy's voice: If this is the only way you're gonna get custody of my baby, then sign the pre-nup. You can figure a way out of it later.",
        "Kim: We're not exactly legal eagles... but one just flew in.",
        "Stacy's voice: Go get him, tiger.",
        "Kim: You're a hotshot lawyer, right?",
        "Eli: Huh. Sure.",
        "Kim: Oh. Great. So, you can translate this? Can you tell me what it means?",
        "Eli: Can you afford my hourly rate?",
        "Kim: Depends. Can you afford mine?",
        "Eli: Ha ha ha ha. Do I need to refer you to section 5902 of the penal code?",
        "Kim: Would you relax? I'm just gonna sit next to you. Let the whole joint think you could bag a girl like me. That's gotta be worth at least what you make an hour, right?",
        "Eli: Sounds very tempting, but...",
        "Kim: Oh, come on. Just use your powers for something good.",
        "Eli: Fine. Fine. I suppose I could take a quick look while I wait for my order.",
        "Kim: Thatta boy!",
        "Eli: Ah. Pre-nuptial agreement. Congrats. You're marrying Clint Buchanan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Thanks for coming, both of you. You guys probably didn't realize I was teaching here since you sent Jessica back to school.",
        "Viki: Excuse me?",
        "Cristian: What? You guys don't know?",
        "Clint: Know what?",
        "Cristian: Jessica's enrolled here at the high school.",
        "Clint: Our daughter graduated about a decade ago.",
        "Viki: I know, but remember, as far as Jessie's concerned, she's still in high school.",
        "Cristian: She wants to finish her senior year, and I-- I need you to talk her out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I have to get a new frame for this because Jessica smashed the one it was in.",
        "Carlotta: Smashed it?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm, during her surprise visit to our apartment. I guess she threw a hissy-fit once she realized Cristian and I were living together. How crazy is that?",
        "Carlotta: Jessica can only remember being a teenager. Remember what those days were like.",
        "Layla: Yeah. That's why I told Cristian maybe we should keep a low profile for a while, but he said he didn't want to hide it. Cristian told me he has no intention of sacrificing our relationship because Jessica's in a time warp. Jessica may be stuck in the past, but... Cristian's future is with me.",
        "Jessica: You must be Layla. I recognize you from your picture. So nice to meet you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What exactly did you hear and from whom?",
        "Roxy: I know that you helped Johnny escape outta jail and I know that the man in black helped you warm up after the car that you were driving blew up.",
        "Natalie: Yes, we were looking for Jessica before Mitch could hurt her.",
        "Roxy: Okay, well, that was then and this is now and I got eyes, and I see the looks between the two of you when you're in the same room.",
        "Natalie: Roxy, what do you want? Why are you here?",
        "Roxy: Listen, you're my kid, and I love you, and I raised you, and I got certain rights, and I got the right to tell you when you're doing something wrong.",
        "Natalie: Excuse me?",
        "Roxy: Look, leave Johnny Mac alone. He's with Marty now, okay?",
        "Natalie: Where is this coming from?",
        "Roxy: All I'm saying is just leave him alone. You don't want to be a homewrecker.",
        "Natalie: Ha ha! A homewrecker? I mean, Roxy, it's not like John and Marty are married with kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You're right. You know, it's not really fair of me to talk about...moving forward and not be...completely open with you.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Marty: Oh.",
        "John: It's probably just Roxy again. You know, when you ignore her, she just goes away.",
        "Oliver: Hey, John. You home?",
        "Marty: You better go ahead. Go ahead. It's okay.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: Okay. One minute.",
        "Oliver: Hey, I'm sorry to bother you at home. I really need some advice. Ah, is this a bad time?",
        "John: We were right in the middle of something.",
        "Marty: You know what, John, it's okay. It's all right. I've gotta get dressed for work and we can finish up later.",
        "John: You sure?",
        "Marty: Yeah. Hey, Fish.",
        "John: What's on your mind, Fish?",
        "Oliver: What would you do if you found out you were gonna be a father?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: What I don't understand is how could the principal even allow Jessica to enroll here.",
        "Cristian: Well, he said something about Todd giving a big donation to the arts program, so I'm sure he's afraid Todd'll take it back if we don't accept Jess as a student.",
        "Viki: Jessie's supposed to be at home resting.",
        "Clint: So, she just sneaked out?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Obviously, she knew we weren't going to approve. I'm not sure just exactly what's best for Jessie now.",
        "Cristian: Right, but you see, the situation for me, it's getting a little tricky.",
        "Viki: I know. She thinks you're still together.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, and she's pretty insistent.",
        "Clint: How did she know that you're teaching here?",
        "Cristian: I told her. Before I knew what she was feeling.",
        "Viki: I'm sorry, Cristian. I know it puts you in a very awkward position.",
        "Clint: How long can our little girl continue to live in a cocoon?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: Jessica. Oh, it's so nice to see you.",
        "Jessica: I still can't get over the remodeling of this place. It looks great.",
        "Carlotta: Charlie redid it for your mother. The Thanksgiving before last. He wanted to recreate that diner where they met in Texas when your mother was working as a waitress.",
        "Jessica: My mother was a waitress? Wow. Oh, don't mind me. I'm still getting over the fact that they canceled \"Boy meets World.\" Ha ha ha. Can I have my usual? Root beer and fries.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, of course. I'll be right back.",
        "Layla: I should get home.",
        "Jessica: No, wait. Share my fries with me? I'd really like to get to know you. At least we know we have one thing in common.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Pretty standard pre-nup. You get a small lump sum if the marriage dissolves within a year, and a little more for each year the marriage continues.",
        "Stacy's voice: Look, I know he's your type, but concentrate. That agreement didn't sound so bad.",
        "Eli: Mm. There is an infidelity clause.",
        "Kim: Sorry, what?",
        "Eli: An infidelity clause. Infidelity is--",
        "Kim: Yeah, I know what it means. What exactly does the clause say?",
        "Eli: Well, should you ever be unfaithful to Mr. Buchanan, you wind up with absolutely nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: I don't get it. I thought you were mad at Schuyler for lying that Dad was the father of Stacy's baby. But now you want to raise her with him?",
        "Gigi: No. Not with him, instead of him. As my own child. But I know this decision affects you, too.",
        "Shane: So, you've already decided?",
        "Rex: Well, nothing's final, yet, buddy. Your mom wants your little cousin to have a great, loving home, and you know what they say--if you want something done right...",
        "Shane: You gotta do it yourself.",
        "Gigi: Honey, okay. If everything turns out the way I hope, Sierra Rose will be sharing your home, too, and I need you to be honest about how you feel about that.",
        "Shane: Well, I was expecting her to come home with us anyway. Well, with Dad, when we thought he was the dad. So, I'm cool with it. But what about Dad?",
        "Rex: What about me?",
        "Shane: Well...no offense, Mom, Aunt Stacy sucked in a lot of ways. You know, you hated her most of the time. You hate Schuyler, too. So, how are you gonna feel about a baby that's half Aunt Stacy and half Schuyler living with me and Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Why? Are you gonna be a father?",
        "Oliver: No. Maybe. You know, I'm not sure. You see, there's--there's this baby and--and she could be mine.",
        "John: You and Kyle in line to adopt?",
        "Oliver: Well, we've talked about the possibility of raising this child.",
        "John: I think...a kid would be lucky to have you as a parent.",
        "Oliver: Okay, but what if some people don't have what it takes to be a parent?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I know that John and Marty don't have kids. Who ever said that they had kids?",
        "Natalie: Okay. So, we're agreed. I'm not a homewrecker.",
        "Roxy: Good. Because this would be absolutely the worst time for you to make a play for Johnny.",
        "Natalie: Ha ha! I'm not making a play on anybody. And who knew that you were a card-carrying member of the fidelity police?",
        "Roxy: Well, just because I love the uniform don't mean that I'm no cop. Just leave Johnny and Marty alone, okay?",
        "Natalie: Since when did you become their protector?",
        "Roxy: Since I found out that John and Marty were gonna--",
        "Natalie: John and Marty were gonna what? What? Rox, have you got something you need to tell me? Just tell me already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, there's some people who shouldn't be parents, for a lot of reasons, but you're not one of those people. You're gonna be a really good dad. But you know, the decision to have a kid, it's not just yours. You're with someone.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, Kyle's fine with the idea of us raising a kid.",
        "John: That's good, because, you know, it's important for both people to be on the same page.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but what if one of those people isn't sure they're ready to be a parent?",
        "John: Assuming that there's a choice, then he probably shouldn't have the kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Shane, I can look past who Sierra's biological parents are and see her for who she is.",
        "Shane: Who's that?",
        "Rex: An innocent child who will hopefully be your sister.",
        "Shane: You're pretty cool, Dad.",
        "Rex: Well, people don't hate me because Mitch Laurence is my biological father, do they?",
        "Gigi: No. Hey, are you ready to see Sierra?",
        "Shane: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So if I cheat on Clint, he gets to throw me out with nothing but the clothes on my back?",
        "Eli: Well, unless, of course, those clothes were purchased by Mr. Buchanan, in which case, you don't get those, either. I must say, whoever drew up this agreement is good. It's ironclad. No loopholes. No exceptions. Good luck to you.",
        "Kim: Thanks for your help.",
        "Eli: Sure.",
        "[Kim sighs]",
        "Kim: But I really like Clint.",
        "Stacy's voice: But are you willing to give up a chance to sleep with any other guy for the rest of your life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I told Jess that I wasn't interested. I mean, you know I'll always care for Jess, and I want her to get better, but--",
        "Viki: It's all right, we know. You don't have to explain.",
        "Clint: No. We're glad that you're being honest with our daughter, because things are complicated enough with her not remembering her daughter and even the man she fell in love with.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. You know, I saw Brody at the hospital, too.",
        "Viki: Oh, God, poor Brody.",
        "Clint: Yeah, he's not handling this well at all.",
        "Viki: I don't think any of us are. Seeing Jessie stuck in the past like this? It's very disconcerting.",
        "Cristian: So are you going to get her to withdrawal from school?",
        "Viki: I'm going to be honest with you, Cristian. I'm not sure exactly how to handle the situation.",
        "Clint: Yeah, we're going to need help to figure this one out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: We do have a lot in common. I know you don't remember me, but we're actually pretty friendly.",
        "Jessica: We are?",
        "Layla: Yeah. I work at the P.D. with your boyfriend, Brody.",
        "Jessica: Oh, he's not my boyfriend.",
        "Layla: Yes, he is, you just don't remember.",
        "Jessica: I am so sorry about this picture frame. I'm so clumsy. But I think that this should cover it.",
        "Layla: Hey, I don't need your money. I can replace the frame, and the picture, too, if I have to. I have tons of pictures of Cristian and me.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Well, that means we have something else in common, too. So do I.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Listen, all I got to tell you is, you got a lot of split ends, so you should come by the salon and I'll hook you up.",
        "Natalie: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! I don't--",
        "Roxy: Well, then maybe you should get a manicure, you know, because we're giving a special today. You get the left hand done, you get the right hand half price.",
        "Natalie: Roxy, you come tearing in here talking about John and Marty are about to do something. What? What, Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Spending more time. They're spending much more time together, so you shouldn't ingest any more time or energy with someone who's stuck on somebody else.",
        "Natalie: Okay. You've got a bizarre way of protecting me, but I--",
        "Bree: Aunt Natty, this is for you.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Oh, this is so beautiful, sweetheart. Mmm, you know what I smell? I smell cookies in the kitchen. Who wants to go get some?",
        "Bree: I do.",
        "Natalie: Okay, I'll be there in one second.",
        "Roxy: You're really great with kids. Too bad you're not the one with the baby.",
        "Natalie: Oh, honey, no, it's okay. You can say whatever you want to say about Stacy, after what she did. Poor Rex. I mean, how is he dealing with that?",
        "Roxy: With what?",
        "Natalie: Well, going from thinking that he was fathering a child with Stacy and then finding out he was actually the guy who stole his girlfriend.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. Well, you know better than I would. You know, Shane told me that Rex is over at the hospital with Gigi while she's looking after the kid.",
        "Natalie: Oh, really? Does that mean that Rex and Gigi are getting back together?",
        "Roxy: Well, they're getting a little closer. You know, a baby has a way of bonding people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm the last person on the planet that should be handing out advice on kids. It seems to me you're not exactly sure what you want.",

        "Marty: Sure, hold on. I'll be right there. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You know, part of me thinks I should step up to the plate. You know, take responsibility for this life--",
        "Marty: I'm sorry. I--I don't mean to interrupt, but I've got to go.",
        "John: Okay. You sure you're all right?",
        "Marty: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just Viki--Viki needs to talk to me.",
        "John: Okay. Look, what we were talking about before--",
        "Marty: It can wait.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Marty: Bye.",
        "Oliver: Um, I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time with this.",
        "John: No, listen, Fish, I think it's--I think it's natural to have doubts when you're thinking about raising a family. You know, my brother, Mike, when he first became a father, when Tommy came into his life, he told me he was completely unprepared. But then, somewhere in there, he ended up realizing he had what it took to be a really good dad.",
        "Oliver: So--so you think it'll just come to me?",
        "John: Only you know if that's inside you, Fish. You're the only one that...can even know if this is what you really want. And I think when you can answer those questions for yourself, you'll know what to do.",

        "Shane: Was I that small?",
        "Gigi: Almost.",

        "Layla: I know you have a lot of pictures of you and Cristian. You use to be together. But if you think you're getting together now--",
        "Jessica: Wow. I didn't say that. Insecure much?",
        "Layla: I'm not the one smashing pictures, sweetheart.",
        "Jessica: Well, I offered to pay for it.",
        "Layla: And I said I don't want you to pay--",
        "Carlotta: Cristian!",
        "Jessica: We were just talking about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy's voice: Not bad. But he could never give you everything you've ever wanted. Not like Clint Buchanan can. Just sign the papers.",
        "Marty: I agree that Jessica going back to high school may be problematic for some people, including Cristian. But it may be right where Jessica needs to be right now.",
        "Clint: You know, it seems to me like we're holding her back. I mean, we want Jessica to remember that she's an adult, don't we?",
        "Marty: Of course. But we don't even know if the source of her memory loss is the E.C.T. or some other physical trauma, or if it's even neurological at all.",
        "Viki: Does that make a difference?",
        "Marty: Whatever the cause, Jessica feels safe where she is. Maybe emotionally, she's not ready to deal with the fact that Mitch tried to rape her. I mean, theoretically, she's still a virgin now. All the milestones of adulthood are ahead of her. Her whole life has yet to unfold.",
        "Viki: So what you're saying is that by going back to high school, she's essentially just retaking the journey?",
        "Marty: Right, it might stimulate her brain to recover some of what's lost.",
        "Clint: And if it doesn't?",
        "Marty: Jessica thinks she missed out on life. Right now, it's critical for her to experience everything that she feels she was cheated out of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: So, how was your first day in high school?",
        "Both: Great.",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, it's not like I really ever left high school.",
        "Layla: Excuse me?",
        "Jessica: Oh, I'm finishing up my senior year. Isn't that right, teach?",
        "[Jessica giggles]",

        "Stacy's voice: It was your idea to marry a rich guy, Kim.",
        "Kim: I know that.",
        "Stacy's voice: You were done with meaningless sex with guys who could barely afford a night in a roach motel.",
        "Kim: Well, maybe I exaggerated a little.",
        "[Stacy sighs]",
        "Stacy's voice: I'm asking a lot asking you to raise my daughter.",
        "Kim: I said I'd do it.",
        "Stacy's voice: And it's the best way, too. In a stable marriage with a guy who can afford to fight for custody.",
        "Kim: I know, I know, it's just forever is a really long time.",
        "Stacy's voice: I know. But I'm not actually here, so I can't force you to do anything you don't want to do. If you don't want to go through with it, then somebody else will just raise Sierra.",

        "Allison: I'm a nurse's aide. I take pictures of the babies for their parents. Which one's yours?",

        "Allison: Aren't you precious?",
        "Shane: But that's my baby cousin--sister. Huh. That one's my baby sister.",
        "Allison: Oh, cute. I can see the family resemblance. Tell me something here. You just stand like this, and I'll take a picture of you and your baby sister together.",
        "Shane: How will I get the picture?",
        "Allison: You can give me your email address. Okay, perfect. Say \"heed the messenger.\"",
        "Shane: What?",
        "Allison: Just something my family says. \"Cheese\" will be fine.",
        "Shane: Cheese.",

        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Layla: Let me get this right. You're Jessica's teacher?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, the principal allowed her to stay in school.",
        "Carlotta: Ay, dios mio. Oh.",
        "Cristian: But look, I told her that our relationship was going to be, you know, strictly a teacher-student relationship. And she swore to me that all she wanted to do was finish high school.",
        "Layla: She can swear all she wants, but Jessica is looking for more than an education.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I'm--I'm going to need some more time.",
        "Kyle: Before you look at the results?",
        "Oliver: No, I'm not saying that I ever want to find out the results of the D.N.A. test, but I'm not saying that I won't, either. I--I just need more time to think.",
        "Kyle: Okay.",
        "Oliver: But I need you to do me a favor. I need you to put this someplace safe so that if and when I ever want to know if I'm the father, I can find out.",
        "Kyle: Okay. So for now, we wait.",
        "Oliver: Look, if you can't do this, I--",
        "Kyle: I never said that. Okay? But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I was nervous about you putting off another big decision. But I love you. And I trust that in time, you'll get to where you need to be to know the truth. I can wait for that as long as it takes.",
        "Oliver: Whew.",

        "Eli: That is great news.",
        "Rex: So you better move fast on this custody thing.",
        "Eli: Well, I just came from court. The papers are filed, and I am prepping the case. I'll be ready to fight for you as soon as we get a date.",

        "Marty: Well, she may be enjoying the few hours of freedom like any teenager would.",
        "Viki: Oh, brother.",
        "Marty: I know. I should probably get going.",
        "Viki: Why? Are you sure?",
        "Marty: Yes. I don't want her to think I'm checking up on her, and I want her to keep trusting me as a friend, and not start avoiding me as a psychiatrist.",
