        "Blair: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Bad time?",
        "Blair: No, no, no, no. Come on in.",
        "Cristian: I'm sorry I didn't call first, but -- uh -- well, I wanted to tell you in person before you hear it from someone else.",
        "Blair: Uh -- is something wrong?",
        "Cristian: Well, I -- I wouldn't exactly call it that, but I'm afraid you're going to have to start looking for another job.",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "Cristian: Antonio lost everything he has, including Capricorn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: And you're okay with the terms of the settlement? Okay. Antonio, I -- you know, I have enormous respect for the way you've handled this. It can't be easy.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nora: Come in! Yeah. I certainly will, and I'll talk to you soon. Okay, bye. That was Antonio.",
        "John: Yeah, he -- he told me what happened.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. That's a little shocking -- losing your inheritance plus some.",
        "John: I guess you got to admire him for not fighting it.",
        "Nora: Yeah, whatever. What can I do for you?",
        "John: Well, it's a case I'm working -- City Hall employees cooking the books.",
        "Nora: Really?",
        "John: I don't know if there's enough to prosecute -- yeah.",
        "Nora: How? Oh, I'd like to take a look at that.",
        "John: All right. I talked to Cole this morning.",
        "Nora: Oh, you did? How did it go?",
        "John: Okay. I think I got through to him about Starr, not cause any more trouble for himself.",
        "Nora: Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I talked to him about it, too, but he really looks up to you -- you know that, right?",
        "John: Yeah, well, the kid's important to me, you know? Call me any time that you -- he needs some help.",
        "Nora: You got it. I owe you one.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "John: Well, I might be taking you up on that one now that I have Commissioner Ramsey to deal with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, where are you moving to?",
        "Charlie: Oh, I'm going to have to find a place, but until then I'll just stay at a motel or something.",
        "Jessica: Well, where did you live when you first moved to Llanview?",
        "Charlie: Well, I was at your mom's friend, Dorian's.",
        "Jessica: Huh. Her \"friend\"?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Lowell: Viki. You're looking well.",
        "Viki: Thank you, Mayor. So are you. Dorian, enjoy your lunch.",
        "Dorian: So as I was saying, the progress on my latest project is, oh, at best, disappointing.",
        "Mayor Lowell: My advice -- patience. Progress has been made.",
        "Dorian: Not fast enough for me.",
        "Ramsey: Well, well, well, this is fortuitous -- I was just about to call you, Mayor. Doctor. There is much to discuss.",
        "Mayor Lowell: As always.",
        "Ramsey: Yes. Ah, do you mind if I join you -- unless you two would rather be alone?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Uh -- no, that's fine -- unless Dorian objects?",
        "Dorian: Not at all. Please.",
        "Ramsey: Thank you. How have you been, Dr. Lord?",
        "Mayor Lowell: You two know each other?",
        "[Ramsey laughs]",
        "Dorian: Well, actually, the commissioner once searched my house. Of course, that was back when he was Agent Ramsey. Now, normally, something like that could seem like a violation. However, the commissioner was so considerate, so polite, that it was almost painless.",
        "Ramsey: Oh, you're too kind. The fact is I was less than gracious but I hope we can get past that, let bygones be bygones.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If I discover Cole has even walked past your lunch table, I'm going to send him to prison.",
        "Starr: For what? What, are you going to tell the police that he raped me when he didn't? I'm going to tell them that he didn't do anything to me.",
        "Todd: Oh, no, no, no. Who's talking about rape? No, he shot Miles Laurence. He shot him in the chest with a gun, almost killed him. And you have to stay away from Cole now, all right? Because if you don't, I'm going to send him to prison.",
        "Starr: No, you -- you wouldn't do that.",
        "Todd: Wouldn't I? We both know he was down there on that wharf. He had a gun, he pulled the trigger.",
        "Starr: It was an accident! It was -- I -- I meant to say that it was a mistake, that anybody would think that Cole was -- could be capable of doing something like that.",
        "Todd: Well, Ramsey was down there. I don't think it would take much to get him to testify.",
        "Starr: Why are you doing this, Dad? Haven't you hurt Cole enough? Why can't you just leave him alone?",
        "Todd: If you do, I will. You have a big decision to make, now, don't you? Is seeing Cole more important to you than his freedom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: It's okay, come on in.",
        "Marcie: No, really, I don't -- I'm not really sure I'm ready for this, Mike, okay?",
        "Michael: No, you cannot cut yourself off from the world forever.",
        "Marcie: Okay. He just looked at me.",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Marcie: He was staring at me, Michael.",
        "Michael: Nobody is staring at you.",
        "Marcie: Fine. Fine.",
        "Gigi: Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Gigi: Did you get any of my messages?",
        "Marcie: Um -- well, I -- I really don't understand why you'd want to talk to me.",
        "Gigi: What? How can you say that? You're my friend.",
        "Marcie: But you're living with Viki and, you know, you were friends with Viki before you were friends with me, and now after everything I did to her --",
        "Gigi: Viki has forgiven you and so have I. Marcie, I've been worried about you.",
        "Marcie: Really?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Don't you believe me?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, and it actually feels really good because I think most people think of me as this monster who stole Todd Manning's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Uh, I'm not so sure I can help you with Ramsey. He's been all over my case recently.",
        "John: Well, you know, if it helps, you're not alone.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I heard you two have some issues.",
        "John: No issues, we just hate each other.",
        "Nora: I love the fact that Bo slipped your reinstatement in before he left office.",
        "John: Yeah -- Bo at his best.",
        "Nora: It's his last act as commissioner.",
        "John: Ramsey wants me out of there but he can't, not without cause.",
        "Nora: Well, don't give him cause -- you know he's going to provoke you, right?",
        "John: Yeah, I've been trying to keep my eyes out for the traps.",
        "Nora: Okay, good. Keep your eye on him -- seriously. He screwed up once; he's going to do it again.",
        "John: When he screws up, people get killed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Doctor, I hope you understand why we had to search you.",
        "Dorian: Yes, of course. I believe it was right after Miles Laurence was shot.",
        "Ramsey: Yes, we were looking for the suspect -- Cole Thornhart.",
        "Dorian: And the young man was cleared.",
        "Ramsey: Eventually -- technically. But I apologize again for disturbing your home. It must be one of Llanview's finest properties.",
        "Dorian: Yes, indeed, it is. In fact, it has been featured in many old design and architecture magazines, mm-hmm.",
        "Ramsey: Llanview home of the year?",
        "Dorian: Runner-up -- several times.",
        "Ramsey: \"Runner-up\"? Cats and kittens. It should've been a winner hands down.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: I couldn't agree with you more. Would you gentlemen excuse me just a minute? Thank you.",
        "Viki: No, no, no, you finish whatever you were doing and we'll have lunch another time. Okay, bye.",
        "Dorian: Stood up? Oh! Not by Charlie, I hope?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Exactly what's so funny about your mother and Dorian being friends?",
        "Jessica: Well, my mother actually used the word \"friend\" to describe her relationship with Dorian?",
        "Charlie: Uh -- well, you know, no, come to think about it, she --",
        "[Jessica laughs]",
        "Charlie: She didn't say it, but I think it was Dorian who said they were such good friends.",
        "Jessica: How did you meet Dorian?",
        "Charlie: Well, I just -- you know, we crossed paths when I was looking for my son.",
        "Jessica: Oh, because of the Rex connection? Yeah, I heard he's your son.",
        "Charlie: Well, yeah, basically. But so you're saying that they're not really friends?",
        "Jessica: You know, if my mother didn't get into this with you, I really shouldn't, either. Honey --",
        "Charlie: Jess, sorry, but somebody better get into with me because if Dorian's been lying to me, I want to know about it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Wait a minute, you can't have Cole thrown in jail for shooting Miles Laurence -- the case was already closed.",
        "Todd: Oh, they can reopen the case in a minute.",
        "Starr: If Miles didn't press charges before, he won't now.",
        "Todd: It doesn't matter. All they need in a case like this is evidence and a witness. Actually, Cole would be in jail already, you know, if McBain hadn't lied to get him off. But, you know, that's not going to wash if the authorities know that I overheard your boyfriend fess up to the crime.",
        "Starr: You didn't hear anything. And he didn't confess to me.",
        "Todd: Ramsey doesn't know that. And he wouldn't care. And, frankly, neither do I.",
        "Starr: You wouldn't do something like that to me.",
        "Todd: Oh, but I'd do it to Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Goodness, Bree loves Lois -- she's giving her a snack.",
        "Charlie: Now, let me get this straight -- did Dorian lie to me?",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I guess it's common knowledge in Llanview anyway. Dorian and my mother are a lot of things, but friends is not one of them.",
        "Charlie: Well, then why would Dorian tell me that they were?",
        "Jessica: You don't know Dorian very well, do you?",
        "Charlie: I guess not.",
        "Jessica: Okay, well, just as it's not a coincidence that your last name is Balsom, it's not a coincidence that Dorian's last name is Lord.",
        "Charlie: I'm -- I'm not following this.",
        "Jessica: Okay, she married my grandfather.",
        "Charlie: Viki's father?",
        "Jessica: Yes. And I guess that's when the rivalry between Dorian and my mother began.",
        "Charlie: Well, so what are you saying -- that they hate each other?",
        "Jessica: With a vengeance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Dorian, it's none of your business but I'm lunching with my editor.",
        "Dorian: Oh, still hoping for a Pulitzer prize? Sorry, but \"The Banner\" will never be \"The Washington Post.\" Does your new beau read your newspaper or are you two no longer an item?",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie and I are just fine, thank you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm so glad to hear it. You know, you really lucked out finding a man like Charlie. How long was it when you weren't involved with anyone? I even thought that you had totally given up -- especially after the way that Clint rejected you.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, you can relate to that, can't you? Did you give up?",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: I hope you appreciate Charlie for the kind of man he is. I certainly did while he was living with me. Oh, you really get to know a man when he is living under the same roof.",
        "Viki: Do you?",
        "Dorian: Yes, mm-hmm. But when I found out that the two of you had something special between you, I just took myself right out of the equation.",
        "Viki: Did you?",
        "Dorian: Yes, I decided it was better if Charlie and I remained just friends.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: Though I suppose after you filled him in on our past history -- your version -- I've probably lost Charlie's friendship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Wow. Antonio must be devastated.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, and he had all these plans to help my mom, too.",
        "Blair: Well, I can see why he doesn't want to, you know, go into a big old legal battle with those people but -- you say he doesn't want the Santi money anyway?",
        "Cristian: Bottom line, my brother is a man of principle, so --",
        "Blair: What are you going to do? What are you going to do for money?",
        "Cristian: I don't know, we'll see. I mean, if we can find someone to buy the club, then maybe I won't have to worry about it. But who knows?",
        "Blair: Well, it's a really bad market.",
        "Cristian: Do you know anyone who might be interested?",
        "Blair: You know what? I'll try to think of somebody.",
        "Cristian: Thanks. Oh -- and tell Dorian, too. Tell her about it.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "Blair: Seems to me like it's a, you know, pretty good investment.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah, it is, especially with Sarah. It's amazing how many hot bands she's brought in the club. I mean, I really think it's put the club back on people's radar.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah, I think it's because Sarah's on your radar and it's making you really happy.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, she is. We have a great time. She's a feisty one, though. She's always bragging about beating me in this video game boxing game I have.",
        "Blair: Oh, wait, let me see. Beating you, boxing -- God, it's got to kill you with all those muscles and being a professional and everything?",
        "Cristian: Believe me, she doesn't let me forget about it.",
        "Blair: Well, I wouldn't, either!",
        "Cristian: How about you? Seems like things between you and Todd are good. No one's being kicked out of the house yet -- that's like a record, no?",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: Blair?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Cristian: I know that look. You okay?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it's just -- um -- just kid stuff. But I don't hear any door-slamming or screaming, so maybe it's being worked out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, you can't do this. You can't have Cole arrested.",
        "Todd: Well, you leave me no choice, do you, after what you got yourself into last night? That is never going to happen again. For the next two years, you do exactly what I say.",
        "Starr: I can't believe this. I'm going to tell Mom and she won't let this happen.",
        "Todd: Starr! Look at me. Look at me!",
        "Starr: Get off of me.",
        "Todd: You know me, don't you? And you know when something's this important to me, this big, I do whatever it takes to get it done. No one can stop me -- not you, not your mom. Now, someday you'll realize I'm doing this because I love you.",
        "Starr: The only thing I realize is that you hate me. You hate me so much that you want to ruin my life.",
        "Todd: I'm trying to save your life.",
        "Starr: By throwing Cole in jail -- the person that I love most in this world? You might as well kill him!",
        "Todd: The thought has crossed my mind.",
        "Starr: You know what? For the first time in my life, I know what everybody -- I understand what everybody thinks about you. They think that you're a psycho. And for years I believed that they were wrong, I defended you. Now I know exactly what they were talking about. You are that bad person. You are that rapist!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: But why -- why wouldn't Viki have told me about this?",
        "Jessica: That Dorian and her are bitter enemies? Well, because she's too classy for her own good sometimes. I mean, she knew that you and Dorian were close and I guess she just didn't want to prejudice you against her.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but they do still dislike each other?",
        "Jessica: Yes, they do, they hate each other. I mean, their grievances go on for decades.",
        "Charlie: And what are they, these grievances? What happened?",
        "Jessica: You know, if my mother didn't want to get into it with you, I really shouldn't, either.",
        "Charlie: Look, you told me that it was common knowledge. Come on.",
        "Jessica: Okay, I guess you're going to find out eventually. The short list?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Dorian tried to take this house away from my mother, she had an affair with my brother -- um -- she got my mother kidnapped.",
        "Charlie: She what?",
        "Jessica: She tries to insult and undermine my mother every chance she gets -- it's her life's ambition, in fact.",
        "Charlie: Okay, I don't get it. I mean, what kind of game is Dorian playing here, telling me that she and Viki are old friends and --",
        "Jessica: I don't know. But P.S. -- Dorian kind of has a history going after the men in my mother's life and if she doesn't get them, she kind of tries to destroy them.",
        "Charlie: Oh, gee -- okay, I got to go.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no, I've upset you, I'm sorry. I -- I should've have said anything, I'm sorry.",
        "Charlie: It's okay!",
        "Jessica: I hope my mother's not upset with me over this.",
        "Charlie: Oh, don't worry about it; I will take full responsibility for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: All right, I love you. Bye.",
        "Marcie: So how's Shane doing?",
        "Gigi: Okay. He's been a little needy lately, what with the move and all. He gets real upset if I'm not totally focused on him. These working moms with a bunch of kids -- I don't know how they do it.",
        "Marcie: Ah.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry. I should not be going on like this.",
        "Marcie: It's fine, really --",
        "Gigi: No, it isn't. I was being insensitive -- complaining about Shane being needy and you guys -- I can't even imagine what you're going through right now without Tommy. I know how much you loved him.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. I wish Todd understood that.",
        "Gigi: Well, he's a creep. I can't believe he's Viki's brother -- and that he made you out to be the villain.",
        "Marcie: I hate to break it to you but I actually think most people think of me that way.",
        "Gigi: No, not me. I know you're a good person and you're a wonderful mom. You were a wonderful mom to Tommy.",
        "Michael: Okay, you see? There you go.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Michael: You have me, Gigi, Lindsay, Roxy, Rex, John, of course -- nobody else matters.",
        "Woman: I'm sorry to interrupt but aren't you Marcie McBain, the one who's been in the news?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Ramsey had to pull a lot of strings to land the commissioner's job.",
        "John: Don't you need friends to do that?",
        "Nora: Yeah, one would think, only I don't know anyone who can stand being in the same room with him.",
        "John: He's got to be working some other angle.",
        "Nora: Well, he was in the F.B.I. for years -- maybe he learned how to maneuver through the political bureaucracy.",
        "John: Yeah, well, he knows how to work the system. Just look what he's gotten away with so far -- knowing he caused that van to crash that killed Marty. And how he wants me to call him \"boss --\" never.",
        "Nora: I'm sorry, John.",
        "John: You know, when the F.B.I. got rid of Ramsey, I thought I was done with him, too, but he's got someone covering for him -- the same person who put him in charge of the police department.",
        "Nora: You don't think that's Mayor Lowell?",
        "John: I think Lowell is someone else's lackey.",
        "Nora: Well, then who else could it be? The only person crazy enough to want Ramsey in charge is Todd Manning, only Todd Manning hates Ramsey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Mom! Everything is awful, okay? It is even worse than I thought it was!",
        "Blair: Look -- um -- yeah, I'll talk to you later. Starr, what is so awful?",
        "Starr: The things that he said to me and the way he just treated me -- I will never speak to him ever again, okay -- never!",
        "Blair: Okay, okay. I will go talk to your father. You all right to stay here by yourself? Are you okay?",
        "Starr: I guess so. Just go -- please?",
        "Blair: What did you just say to her?",
        "Todd: Stay out of this.",
        "Blair: Don't tell me to stay out of it. It's my daughter and she's hurting, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yes, Cole Thornhart hurt her, not me.",
        "Blair: Stop --",
        "Todd: And I'm going to make sure he doesn't hurt her again -- or any girl, for that matter.",
        "Blair: You stop making this about what you did to Marty.",
        "Todd: I am not making it about that! It's about him -- what he has done to me and my daughter! And I'm going to make sure he pays! That's it -- him and McBain!",
        "Blair: Oh, let it go!",
        "Todd: No, McBain assaulted me in my own home. He's going away.",

        "Cristian: Not a problem. What did you want to talk to me about?",
        "Jessica: Actually, I just want to run something by you.",
        "Cristian: Okay. Shoot.",
        "Jessica: Well, it's about Nash's winery -- I haven't even run it by him yet but I'm sure he'd be onboard.",
        "Cristian: I don't get it. Why -- why would you want to talk to me about it?",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm sure you don't know, but Nash found the money to buy out Jared and he has a new backer for the vineyard, and he also has enough money to launch a whole new line of wines.",
        "Cristian: Cool.",
        "Jessica: And, as you know, advertising is essential. I mean, how many times has somebody picked up a bottle of wine just by the way the label looks?",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah, people do that all the time at Capricorn. If they don't know wine, they usually go for the nicer-looking bottle.",
        "Jessica: Exactly.",
        "Cristian: So is -- is that why you wanted to talk to me about this -- because of my experience as a bartender?",
        "Jessica: No, because of your artistic talents. I was hoping that you'd design all of the labels for the new line of wines and be in charge of the graphic designs for the advertising.",
        "Cristian: Oh, okay, I get it. But, no, Jess, forget about it but thanks anyway, huh?",
        "Jessica: What's your problem?",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on, Jess, you know me. I'm not going to take your charity.",

        "Dorian: You are the soul of discretion. It's so admirable, though I have to tell you I truly am happy that you and Charlie have found each other.",
        "Viki: Are you? We, that just warms the cockles of my heart.",
        "Dorian: Good, because when I saw the way you were clinging to Charlie at the \"Go Red\" ball -- well, I wouldn't be surprised if you roped him into marrying you.",

        "Blair: Well, it's -- uh -- it's not great.",
        "Charlie: Okay, well, I won't keep you, then. Do you know when she's going to be back?",
        "Blair: No -- is everything all right? I mean, you guys are still friends, aren't you?",
        "Charlie: Uh -- yeah. Why wouldn't we be?",
        "Blair: Well, there's no reason really except that you did move in with Viki and I think maybe it caused a little like, you know, friction between the two of you maybe?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, yeah, because, I mean, you'd think it would because Viki and Dorian aren't all that close.",
        "Blair: Oh, I think that's sugarcoating it, like, by a cup and a half.",
        "Charlie: Huh.",
        "Blair: I -- um -- I would invite you in but I need to speak to my daughter right now.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, that's okay.",
        "Blair: I'll tell Dorian that you stopped by.",
        "Charlie: Okay.",
        "Blair: But you know, if it's an emergency, she said that she was having a meeting maybe over at The Palace, some kind of business meeting -- or you can try her cell phone.",
        "Charlie: Okay. Well, thank you, Blair.",
        "Blair: Okay. Bye. Take care, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Bye.",

        "Todd: Fancy you here. Can one of you girls tell me why you're protecting a known rapist?",
        "Nora: Well, that's rich coming from you. What, you don't know the definition of rape? No rape was committed, Todd.",
        "John: Get out of here, Manning.",
        "Todd: What are you going to do, John? Are you -- are you going to assault me again?",
        "John: Maybe.",
        "Todd: No, I don't think so. I'll be brief. I just want to make sure you guys understand that if Cole Thornhart goes anywhere near my daughter, I'm going to make him pay dearly.",
        "Nora: Really? You're lucky that I'm not pressing assault charges against you.",
        "Todd: For what? I was just protecting my daughter. If you want to talk about assault, ask John about it. He assaulted me last night. I have lots of witnesses who saw it -- certainly enough to make sure you're never a cop again.",

        "Marcie: Well, that's wonderful, that's great! I mean, Carter was a great kid -- very, very bright, very bright.",
        "Gigi: Well, it must be a pattern with you, Marcie. My -- my son's a lot younger than yours but she got him to be a reader, too.",
        "Elaine: Oh, really? That's great. Well, I'll let you get back to your lunch. I just wanted to say thank you.",

And if one of their parents tried to take them away from me -- well, honestly, I don't know what I'd do. So -- um -- I wish you the best of luck.",

        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Marcie: You know, Gigi, I was thinking -- it sounded like you were going to be busy later and I also don't think Shane wanted to stay at that after-school program so if you wouldn't mind, I -- could I pick him up after school?",
