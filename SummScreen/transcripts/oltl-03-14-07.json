        "Blair: Miles Laurence, please. He's -- oh, no. Did -- did he say where he was going? No, no, no, I don't want his voicemail. I want to give him the message in person. I'm going to give you the message, miles, and Todd will get the message loud and clear, too, that I am so over him.",
        "Miles: Um -- actually, there is something I want to ask you.",
        "Marty: What is it?",
        "Miles: Well, I realize I'm doing this backwards, considering we've already shared my first kiss. Do you want to go out with me on my first date?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Adriana, surprise -- whoa! Whoa. Whoa?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Can we talk?",
        "Cristian: I'm busy.",
        "Evangeline: Everybody seems to have what they need here, Cristian. This came in the mail for me today. It's -- no return address, but I recognize the handwriting. Can I tell you how excited I was when I got this?",
        "Cristian: Why would you be so excited to get something from me? When you got a gazillion-dollar necklace from Manning?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Viki!",
        "Viki: Hey -- take it easy -- I'm right here! What's up?",
        "Todd: I need your help with something.",
        "Viki: With what? Is everything all right?",
        "Todd: Oh, everything's great. Evangeline and I are going away together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Mom? All right, coast is clear.",
        "Starr: Are you sure?",
        "Cole: Yeah, she's at work. Wait right here -- I'll get my ski stuff.",
        "Starr: Hurry up. I don't want her to walk in on us.",
        "Cole: Relax.",
        "Starr: Cole, we have the worst luck. What if she walks in and sees me here?",
        "Cole: She sees patients during the afternoon. She won't be back for a while. Hmm -- mom must've moved my stuff out here.",
        "Starr: Cole, is this your dad?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: You look a lot like him. Such a nice face.",
        "Cole: Huh.",
        "Starr: Hmm. So, what's your cover story for when you come home tonight?",
        "Cole: I don't know -- I'll think of something. Hey, wait a minute -- I just realized.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Cole: Those permission forms for this thing -- how are we going to get them signed?",
        "Starr: Oh, don't worry about it. It's a piece of cake.",
        "Cole: What do you mean?",
        "Starr: Just get me a copy of your mom's signature and I'll take care of the rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Are you asking me out?",
        "Miles: Yes. Now, I -- they have this thing called the winter festival up at Llantano Mountain. Do you know about that?",
        "Marty: Yeah, yeah. I've heard of it.",
        "Miles: Well, see, they have all the things that I want to try out -- skiing, snowboarding, ice skating. The ad said \"fun is guaranteed,\" so that -- that sold me.",
        "Marty: You know, miles, I think it is great that you want to try new things, absolutely.",
        "Miles: So is that a yes? Is it -- is it a date?",
        "Marty: I'm flattered that you are asking me out. I -- I know how hard it must've been for you, but I can't go out with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: The necklace was a birthday present from Todd, but I didn't take it.",
        "Cristian: Look, I got -- I got work to do, Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: You could've done this in person, Cristian. No note? No nothing?",
        "Cristian: What else is there to say? I don't want your key anymore, and I figured you'd want it back as soon as possible. Someone else might need it.",
        "Evangeline: You mailed this because it hurts you to see me. I know it hurts me to see you, because all I want to do right now is -- is jump over this counter and be with you, Cristian. It's the same for you, I know it is. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you. Please, can't we -- can't we get back what we had?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Evangeline is going away with you?",
        "Todd: Shocked?",
        "Viki: Well, it's too soon! She just split up with Cristian. She's got a broken heart.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's why she needs this.",
        "Viki: No! She's not ready to jump into something new like this. Nobody -- you know what? She's very cautious. I'm surprised she said yes.",
        "Todd: Well, she doesn't exactly know about it yet.",
        "Viki: Ha-ha -- she doesn't know. What are you going to do, kidnap her?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Do you have any -- you have any duct tape? No, I'm going to take her to this thing up in Llantano Mountain.",
        "Viki: The winter festival -- oh, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yeah, she needs to go a little crazy, you know?",
        "Viki: Well, you're certainly the guy for that.",
        "Todd: She needs to loosen up a little bit, and I just want to make sure every detail's in place before I ask her.",
        "Viki: But that's a little premature, don't you think?",
        "Todd: No. \"Preemptive\" is more like it. We're just going to have a nice time snowboarding and then I'm going to surprise her with the -- the nicest room at the lodge.",
        "Viki: Oh. Well, you've got it all worked out, down to the best hotel room. What do you need me for?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no, no. I know what you're thinking, and of course, you're partially right. I mean, I am a flesh-and-blood man and -- and she's absolutely beautiful. And, yeah, I'm very attracted to her, but I'm not going to let that -- our friendship is too precious. She's the best friend I ever had and I've never had anyone like that in my life.",
        "Viki: Then don't ruin it by overwhelming her with this -- this manning nonsense.",
        "Todd: I want her to have some fun. She deserves to have a little fun, that's all.",
        "Viki: The problem is, your idea of fun is really weird.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, that's what's great about Evangeline -- she likes that I'm weird. My intentions are purely innocent, purely platonic, I promise.",
        "Viki: Ok, ok, I get the picture. But where does Blair fit in to all of this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: Hey, Rex . How's it going?",
        "Adriana: Hey. I'm so glad to see you.",
        "Rex: Uh -- I'd forgotten you were doing your fitting with Tate today. That is what I walked in on, right -- a fitting?",
        "Adriana: Of course it is, silly. And I am so excited about it.",
        "Tate: We all are.",
        "Rex: Down, boy.",
        "Adriana: No, seriously. Getting Tate to model for us was a major break. It's the only reason the ad agency took us on at all.",
        "Layla: Hey, guys. Rex .",
        "Adriana: Did you get everything?",
        "Layla: And more in the car. Llantano Mountain -- is this a dream come true, or what?",
        "Adriana: Ah, totally is. We got permission to shoot in the lodge and it is the perfect location. Hmm. Oh, Tate, we're done. You could put your pants on.",
        "Tate: Thanks.",
        "Adriana: You're cool with me doing this, right?",
        "Rex: No, why wouldn't I be?",
        "Adriana: Oh, god, look at the time. Guys, we got to get our butts in gear.",
        "Layla: I'm going to put this stuff in my suitcase.",
        "Tate: Here, I'll help.",
        "Layla: Oh, it's ok.",
        "Tate: Oh, no, no, no. I'm -- I traveled with the team for a few years. I'm an expert at fitting large pieces of stuff into small pieces of luggage.",
        "Layla: Ok, good. Don't be horrified by the condition of my room.",
        "Adriana: Am I being annoying?",
        "Rex: What? How?",
        "Adriana: Well, I'm just -- I know I'm really excited and I might be a little distracted.",
        "Rex: No, you have a right to be excited. This is big stuff.",
        "Adriana: It is, isn't it? I mean, this is really important, Rex . This could be huge for Layla and me.",
        "Rex: This is an important day for us, too -- you and me.",
        "Adriana: It is? What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Happy anniversary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: We've been over this before, Evangeline, and the answer's still the same. This -- this can't work.",
        "Evangeline: You're giving up?",
        "Cristian: You have feelings for another man. How -- why the hell would I stick around?",
        "Evangeline: I never said I had feelings for Todd.",
        "Cristian: Look, I don't care what you said. I see what's going on, and I'm not going to play that game. I'm not going to be competing for your attention with anyone, much less Todd Manning, I don't have his power or money.",
        "Evangeline: Is that what you think I want? Power and money and anything else?",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on. You sure seemed to enjoy showing off those rocks around your --",
        "Evangeline: I wasn't showing off, Cristian. How come you can't understand this?",
        "Cristian: What is there to understand?",
        "Evangeline: That I love you! I love you, Cristian -- only you.",
        "Cristian: Ok, then prove it. Tell me you won't see Todd Manning again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Blair's got nothing to do with any of this.",
        "Viki: Oh, Todd. This is all about Blair. Come on, Evangeline is a distraction for you right -- just as you are for her -- a distraction from Cristian.",
        "Todd: I don't need to hear any of this stuff right now.",
        "Viki: Yes, honey, you do. You do. You're trying too hard to get over Blair by rushing into a new relationship.",
        "Todd: What relationship? I just got through saying the relationship I have with Evangeline is purely friendly. We're friends now, we've been friends for a long time. That's \u0096",
        "Viki: You're grateful to her because she stood by you when you were on trial for murder.",
        "Todd: Right, and Blair didn't. That's -- that's what my relationship with Blair is like, and I -- and I don't blame her. I understand why she didn't stand by me. My -- my past came back to haunt me, so -- but you see, that's -- that's what's so -- I don't know. It's so easy with Evangeline because we don't have that kind of baggage.",
        "Viki: If Blair were to walk in here right now and tell you she wanted you back, what would that do to your relationship with Evangeline?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I -- I'm sorry. I -- I should've realized that a woman like you wouldn't want to go out with a guy that's inexperienced like me.",
        "Marty: Oh. No, no, Miles. That -- that isn't it at all. Look, you are -- you are charming and handsome and -- you know, any woman would be proud to go out with you. It's just -- look, I lost my husband not that long ago, and I'm just not ready to date. And -- and even if I was, I couldn't date you. You're a patient -- it would be unethical.",
        "Miles: I see. But we can be friends, can't we?",
        "Marty: Actually, no. I -- I can't have a close relationship with anybody I am seeing professionally.",
        "Miles: What if I fired you?",
        "Marty: After you worked so hard to get me to take you on?",
        "Miles: Well, I mean, this is all new to me. I think I'd be more comfortable with a male psychiatrist.",
        "Marty: Ok.",
        "Miles: No, really. I mean it -- I mean, to learn about women and --",
        "Marty: Well, I can help you with that.",
        "Miles: No, you can't help me with everything.",
        "Miles: I mean, the gory details, as they say.",
        "Marty: Oh, well, you see, that's where your friends come in, not the doctors.",
        "Miles: Well, see, see? I'm learning something new every day. Now, I mean it, Marty. I've only seen you once. I'd prefer to have you as a friend than a therapist.",
        "Marty: Well, um, in that case, let's be friends.",
        "Miles: Great. You're fired.",
        "Marty: Great. You know, I really hope you do go up to the mountain.",
        "Miles: You know, I don't know. I don't think it'd be much fun being alone.",
        "Marty: Well, you know, I really don't think you should miss out on, you know, a chance to do something new -- add a first to your list. Um -- and, actually, I, too, have a cancellation this afternoon so, now that we have redefined our relationship, I would be happy to go with you as a friend.",
        "Miles: That's great.",
        "Miles: Do you ski?",
        "Marty: Hey, I was practically raised in them. I can teach you.",
        "Miles: Really?",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm. So I will go home and get my gear and then meet you back here in a little while.",
        "Miles: I -- I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to it.",
        "Marty: Great. Not now, Blair.",
        "Blair: Hey, Miles.",
        "Miles: Hi.",
        "Blair: How would you like to go on your first date -- with me?",
        "Miles: So you want to have a date with me?",
        "Blair: Well, I just asked you, didn't I? There's this thing going up on Llantano Mountain. It's called the winter festival later, and --",
        "Miles: Yeah, I'm -- I'm going to that.",
        "Blair: You are? Well, great! We can go together.",
        "Miles: Well, I -- no, I -- I'm sorry, I -- I can't go with you.",
        "Blair: Miles, yes, you can. Come on, it'll be fun. Besides, you know, I'm a pretty good skier and I could teach you to ski.",
        "Miles: Oh, I'm sure you could. And I'm flattered that you want to go out with me, but I have to ask -- why?",
        "Blair: Why? Well, why not? We're both single and, I don't know about you, but I feel like we kind of Bonded over your hangover.",
        "Miles: Oh, no, there's no question.",
        "Blair: Besides, I like you and you're nice. And I am not used to nice and I think that would be a really good thing for me, too, so say yes.",
        "Miles: The thing is --",
        "Blair: It would mean so much to me. I could help you, you could help me and -- come on. Wouldn't you want to spend just a little bit more time with me, too?",
        "Miles: Well, yes.",
        "Blair: Oh, good! Perfect -- it's a date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I happen to be an excellent forger. It's one of my many talents.",
        "Cole: Let me see. Wow -- that is amazing.",
        "Starr: Well, your mom has a very easy signature. I could do it in my sleep. So, give me the form. I think I'm ready to sign it.",
        "Cole: All right, go for it. I'll go look for my snowboard.",
        "Starr: Ok. Cole?",
        "Marty: Cole? Cole, honey, are you here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: I'll say it a million times -- Todd Manning is no threat to you.",
        "Cristian: He's a threat to the whole damn world.",
        "Evangeline: I don't expect you to like him, but you two can co-exist on the same planet if you would just accept the fact that you are the only man that I want.",
        "Cristian: Ok, then stop seeing him. Cut him out of your life.",
        "Evangeline: You don't -- you don't trust me anymore.",
        "Cristian: Well, I think you've already proven that I can't.",
        "Evangeline: You're being so stubborn.",
        "Cristian: This is what I need, Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: What I need is that you can still trust me.",
        "Cristian: Then prove it, then earn it. Earn it!",
        "Evangeline: I don't know what to say to you. I don't know what to say to you.",
        "Cristian: \"Goodbye,\" \"it's over,\" \"move on\"? You already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Uh -- if Blair walked in the door and said she wanted me back, I think that I'd still stay friends with Evangeline. That's it, period. We're friends, that's what we're going to be know why I'm justifying myself to you. I came here to ask you for some ski equipment.",
        "Viki: Why? You have your own ski equipment. What happened to it?",
        "Todd: Well, I did. I tossed it when I found Blair and Spencer together at the cabin. All I have are these -- these gloves and \u0096",
        "Viki: Well, well, well, well, well. Looks exactly like the necklace you gave Evangeline.",
        "Todd: Yeah. She wasn't quite ready to wear it.",
        "Viki: She's not ready to wear her. Why do you think she's going to go away with you on some winter adventure?",
        "Todd: Am I on trial here?",
        "Viki: Todd? Look, I know that you're working very hard to put Blair behind you and I know that you genuinely care about Evangeline.",
        "Todd: Yes, genuinely.",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Todd: Absolutely, so please back off.",
        "Viki: No, you have to back off. You're doing too much, too soon. You're trying too hard. Somebody's going to get hurt.",

        "Adriana: Rex , this isn't our anniversary. We started going out a year ago February.",
        "Rex: I know, but, uh, this is the anniversary of the day we spent in New York together.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Rex: So, it's the anniversary of the moment I knew I was in love with you.",
        "Adriana: And when I thought that I might lose you, that's when I knew I was in love with you. And it all happened in the Big Apple, huh?",
        "Rex: One year ago today. Happy Anniversary.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Rex , oh, they're beautiful.",
        "Rex: You know, I had the idea there could be some nude modeling going on here today.",
        "Adriana: You did?",
        "Rex: Only I thought it would be a private session between you and me.",
        "Adriana: Well, it will be if you're patient.",
        "Rex: No, can't be patient. Afraid not -- quite the opposite, in fact.",
        "Adriana: Well, then, come up to Llantano Mountain with us.",
        "Rex: Gee, I don't know if I can. Adriana, I do have a life, you know.",
        "Adriana: Please?",
        "Rex: Ok.",
        "Adriana: I knew I could talk you into it.",
        "Rex: How long is the shoot?",
        "Adriana: A couple of hours, but then you and I can spend the night together, celebrating.",
        "Layla: Better get packing, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: I love you.",
        "Rex: I love you, too.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Tate: Oh.",
        "Rex: Well, it's really great this -- this all worked out.",
        "Tate: Yeah, yeah. I'm glad the girls asked me. Should be fun.",
        "Rex: So, how does your wife feel about you posing in shorts?",
        "Tate: I'm not married.",
        "Rex: Girlfriend?",
        "Tate: Not as of yet, no.",
        "Rex: Oh -- surprised. I figure a guy like you could get any girl he wants.",
        "Tate: Why are you giving me the third degree about my love life? Are you afraid that I'm making a play for Adriana?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I came here for some ski crap, not a lecture.",
        "Viki: Hey. Unfortunately, if you want one, you get the other, but the lecture's free.",
        "Todd: Hmm. All right, fine. I didn't want to because I just spent a million dollars on a necklace nobody wanted, so I'll just buy it up there.",
        "Viki: Hey. Ok, I understand your feelings for Evangeline are friendly now.",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Viki: Ok? What if it turns into something more while you're up there? I don't want you to be hurt again. Besides, when you get hurt, you hurt other people and it's really time to break that pattern.",
        "Todd: Maybe that's what I'm doing. Maybe Blair is the negative pattern and I'm going to walk away from it. Viki: But you're doing exactly the opposite, because Blair is still the center of your life and you're still the center of her life.",
        "Todd: Hey, Viki? Viki: Hmm?",
        "Todd: Do you have any ski equipment I can borrow?",
        "Viki: Hmm. Yeah, Kevin and Joey's stuff is up in the attic. Help yourself. It's cold up there. Yeah.",
        "Todd: You know, for once, instead of assuming I'm doing something wrong, why don't you entertain the possibility that, for once, I'm doing something right?",
        "Viki: Todd, when are you ever, ever going to learn anything?",

        "Marty: Cole, hi. Hi, honey, it's mom. I was just calling to let you know I got home early, but I will actually be heading back out and I'll be home later tonight, so I won't be able to have dinner with you, sweetie, but there is some lasagna in the refrigerator and I am going to leave you some money here on the coffee table if you want to get yourself some pizza, and I'll call you later, ok?

        "Miles: I -- I know you won't.",
        "Blair: It -- look, it'll be fun. And I know that I could use it and it's got to be tough for you, being new in town and all.",

        "Blair: Well, it's not a problem unless you make it a problem, and the only problem I can see right now is that you're not being spontaneous. Come on. You're not going to disappoint me, are you?",

        "Cole: Or who you're with.",
        "Starr: Exactly. Look, I would tell you to come in with me. My aunt Viki's cool, but if she tells my dad that you were here with me --",
        "Cole: No, that's all right. I'll wait out here.",
        "Starr: Are you sure?",

        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Starr: And, actually, my -- a friend of mine who is -- who is a guy, he's going, too, and he doesn't have any gear. I was wondering if he could borrow something old of Joey or Kevin's?",
        "Viki: Oh, darling. Yes, absolutely. I wish I'd known earlier because I don't know what's left. Um -- you know what? It's really cold up there. Let me go get a wrap and I'll go up with you. Ok, I'll be right back.",

        "Tate: Yeah, that's not my style. Look, Adriana's great. I mean, what guy wouldn't think she's hot, right? But I respect other people's relationships. I would never get in your way.",
        "Rex: Uh -- I'm sure you wouldn't because you're such a decent guy.",
        "Tate: And you'd have to be, too, for her to be going out with you, right? She seems pretty crazy about you.",

        "Layla: Yeah. We're shooting an exposed ad today up on Llantano Mountain, and we decided we wanted some behind-the-scene footage for our personal portfolio, but the ad agency won't give us a still photographer, so we just thought --",
        "Cristian: You're trying to get my mind off your sister?",
        "Layla: No. No. You're an amazing photographer and my friend, and I think you're the perfect person for the job.",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Layla: Ok, fine, I admit it -- it wouldn't hurt for you to get Evangeline out of your head, just for a little while.",

        "Miles: You know, I -- I really -- I don't have the right stuff. Maybe --",
        "Marty: No, don't worry about it. I threw some of the stuff in the trunk that belonged to my husband. I didn't have the heart to get rid of it. I hope you will put it to good use.",
        "Miles: Look, um, I -- I thought you should know, we're not going to be the only ones there.",

        "Adriana: I got it, guys. Don't worry.",
        "Layla: What you just said -- how you won't be able to get over Evangeline? Cris, it's all the more reason to take the job.",
