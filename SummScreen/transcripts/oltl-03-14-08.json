        "Langston: Oh, you startled me.",
        "Markko: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: No, it's okay. I was just trying to call Cole, but I just got his voicemail.",
        "Markko: He's probably on his way. So, you can sneak Starr out of the back gate of your house, right?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I'm -- I'm pretty sure.",
        "Markko: Okay.",
        "Langston: I'm glad you thought of this -- the perfect place for them to meet.",
        "Markko: It's romantic, huh? The moon, the water.",
        "Langston: Yeah -- romantic.",
        "Cole: Guys, what's going on?",
        "Markko: Dude, we figured out a way for you to see Starr. Langston's going to bring her here.",
        "Cole: No, she can't, not here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Deadline was yesterday. I can't print what hasn't been written.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Starr gasps]",
        "Shaun: Hello, Miss Manning. Where are we headed?",
        "Starr: \"We\"?",
        "Shaun: I'm your bodyguard, Shaun. Wherever you go, I go.",
        "Starr: Oh, well, how cozy, as if my life wasn't perfect enough.",
        "Blair: Where were you going?",
        "Starr: Nowhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh. Charlie, you're back.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I -- I just wanted to get my bag. I mean, I was headed out to the motel earlier today and Jessica came by and I got a little -- you know, distracted.",
        "Viki: I know. Um -- I talked to Jessie. Look, uh -- I'm sorry. I -- I -- I should've told you about my real relationship with Dorian.",
        "Charlie: Hey, I'm sure you had your reasons.",
        "Viki: Well, yes, I did. You see, I -- Charlie, I didn't think it was important. Dorian is a difficult woman at best and always has been, and frankly, I don't want to deal with negative things in my life anymore, you know? And as long as she doesn't hurt you, it's not important how I feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So what's wrong? I mean, you're doing exactly what you want to do, the family's finally starting to treat you like family. This is exactly what you wanted.",
        "Jared: It is. I'm great, actually. I do have pretty much everything I ever wanted.",
        "Natalie: \"Pretty much\"?",
        "Jared: Well --",
        "Rex: Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Natalie: Hey, what's up?",
        "Rex: Uh -- I have that background info Bo asked me for, but I can't find him.",
        "Jared: Oh, I'll take it. Great.",
        "Rex: He also mentioned he has another job for me.",
        "Jared: Oh, right -- he spoke with me about that, too. You know, let me see if I can't find the info pack for you. I'll be right back.",
        "Natalie: What's in the bag?",
        "Rex: Oh -- for Shane. We were playing this video game based on this comic book -- thought he'd get a kick out of it. What?",
        "Natalie: I -- I don't know. I was just wondering, you know, you've been spending an awful lot of time with Gigi and her kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: So I guess it's done, right?",
        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Gigi: If we're going for slimy and gross, yep. I think we've achieved our goal.",
        "Shane: Awesome -- so I can go play that game Rex got me.",
        "Gigi: Whoa, whoa, hold it. It was very nice of Rex to give you that game, but I don't want you bothering him for stuff every time you see him, okay?",
        "Shane: I'm not bothering him, Mom. He wants to give me things.",
        "Gigi: Shane? When Rex was here, I heard him ask you when your birthday is.",
        "Shane: Then you walked in and I never got to tell him.",
        "Gigi: And you never will, understand? You're not to tell anyone when your birthday is -- especially not Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If you'd like to make a phone call, Shaun has a cell phone and a list of approved callers. Just play by the rules and he'll keep his distance.",
        "Starr: I didn't do anything wrong, so why are you punishing me? Why are you keeping me in prison?",
        "Todd: Hmm. Yeah. She knows why.",
        "Blair: Yeah, we all know why, Todd, because you don't let us forget it.",
        "Todd: I'm trying to keep her safe. I would assume you'd like the same thing.",
        "Blair: Oh -- two more years of tension like this -- I don't think so. But I don't want my daughter to leave here at 18 and not speak to me again.",
        "Todd: No, that's not going to happen.",
        "Blair: If you keep this up, it will.",
        "Todd: Well, if by \"this,\" you mean protecting our daughter, then yeah, I'll keep it up forever.",
        "Blair: Starr said you threatened to put Cole in prison.",
        "Todd: That's right.",
        "Blair: Even after she told you that nothing happened, you're going to press charges against that boy for rape?",
        "Todd: Oh, no, not rape. I'm going to press charges against that boy for shooting Miles Laurence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Um, I don't get it. Dude, this is totally going to work. You can see Starr and no one will know.",
        "Miles: What are you doing?",
        "Markko: Like Langston said -- it's the perfect place. It's kind of romantic, too.",
        "Langston: Oh, wait, it's cold out here. My fingers are freezing.",
        "Markko: Well, where are your gloves, freak?",
        "Langston: You know, I -- I think I left them at the diner. Do you think you could go get them for me?",
        "Markko: Ugh. All right, it's only a few blocks away. I'll be right back. Don't go away.",
        "Langston: All right, we'll be right here. Don't worry. This is it, isn't it? This is where you shot Miles?",
        "Cole: My mom had just died and -- I wish I could forget it, but I can't. I can't, I never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Why shouldn't I tell people when my birthday is?",
        "Gigi: Because -- if they know when your birthday is, then -- then they might think that they have to give you loads of gifts and that would make me feel bad.",
        "Shane: \"Loads of gifts?\" You really think they would?",
        "Gigi: Shane Morasco, you are not to tell anyone about your birthday -- do you hear me?",
        "Shane: But I don't see why it has to be a big secret, especially since you told me you hate secrets.",
        "Gigi: I do, but sometimes you have no choice but to keep them. Lois, let me help you.",
        "Lois: Oh, thank you, dear.",
        "Gigi: Whoa, it's heavy. Is this for Viki?",
        "Lois: No, it's for you -- see?",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God -- our stuff!",
        "Shane: Noelle must've finally sent our boxes from Texas.",
        "Lois: And there's a lot more still outside.",
        "Gigi: Oh, that's great. Here -- be careful because this one feels like it got a little beat up. Hold the bottom --",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "Shane: What are these? Ooh -- pictures.",
        "Gigi: Shane, give me those.",
        "Shane: Mom, look how young you were here. Are there any pictures of my dad?",
        "Gigi: No, no. Just -- just give them to me, okay?",
        "Shane: Mom, look at this, quick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So what if see Shane a lot -- or Gigi? What's it to you?",
        "Natalie: Okay, all right. I guess I pushed a button.",
        "Jared: Sorry, the info you needed isn't compiled yet. Be ready first thing in the morning -- is that okay?",
        "Rex: No problem. I guess I'll be on my way -- unless Nattie wants to malign my character some more.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God -- I am not maligning you, Mr. Paranoid. I pry because I care.",
        "Rex: Care less, okay?",
        "Natalie: Speaking of prying, you were about to tell me what's missing in your life, so let's hear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So that's why I did not correct your misinformation.",
        "Charlie: Well, no, no. Viki, look, Dorian clearly lied to me. She presented herself as being your good friend -- I'm just sorry that I fell for it.",
        "Viki: Oh, don't beat yourself up about that. She is very, very good at fooling people.",
        "Charlie: Okay, well, I saw her and I had it out with her and she now knows that she shouldn't even try to interfere with us or our relationship.",
        "Viki: Did you really?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Oh, good for you! Oh, you know what? With Dorian, it -- it's all about information. You know, she never gets very far unless she has a secret to exploit, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You know what, Shane? Give it back to me.",
        "Shane: Your hair is all poofy, and that dress looks really weird.",
        "Gigi: I said give it back.",
        "Shane: Okay. Here. I'll go look for the other ones. Here's one of you and Rex, too. Look.",
        "Gigi: I don't need to look at them, Shane. I've seen them a million times.",
        "Viki: Whoa -- what happened?",
        "Shane: How come there aren't any pictures of my dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I've been meaning to thank you about saying yes to being Rex's dad. You really saved my butt, you know?",
        "Charlie: Well, no, I'm glad to do it. I mean, he's a great kid.",
        "Roxy: You seem, like, a little famisht. That's slang Germanic for \"not being so crazy about the idea anymore\"?",
        "Charlie: Well, no, it's just that sometimes I don't think that it's quite fair to Rex.",
        "Roxy: Why not? It's not like it's a lie. It's more like an adoption. You got to see it that way -- that you're gonna give him the family that he never had. But I got a good question for you, Charlie. Why'd you say yes so quickly? What's in it for you? What are you after, Charlie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Nothing's missing from my life, actually. Everything's great.",
        "Natalie: That's not what you said earlier.",
        "Renee: Hello, dear heart.",
        "Natalie: Renee! Oh, Nigel, thank you so much for coming.",
        "Renee: Oh, you don't need to thank us. Um -- we just would like to help.",
        "Nigel: In any way we can.",
        "Natalie: Well, we really appreciate it. Dad just wants us to ask you a few questions about Grandpa's old friends, rivals.",
        "Renee: Clint said that he was hoping that he might get some kind of insight into who is behind this attack on B.E.",
        "Natalie: Exactly.",
        "Renee: Jared, darling.",
        "[Renee chuckles]",
        "Renee: I've missed you.",
        "Jared: Missed me? Well, I haven't gone anywhere.",
        "Renee: Well, you're never at home. But it's so wonderful -- Asa's three sons and his beautiful granddaughter all doing whatever you can to strengthen B.E. Asa would be so proud and -- I'm just thrilled.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Cole was the one who fired the gun that night.",
        "Blair: No -- no. John told me that John was the one --",
        "Todd: No, it turns out John is a liar. You surprised? He was trying to protect Cole. If he hadn't protected Cole, Cole would be in jail now. And Starr and he wouldn't have been alone together in that house that night.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? I -- I don't believe any of that, Todd.",
        "Todd: Well, you can believe this -- it's never going to happen again.",
        "Blair: If Starr thinks that she's responsible for sending her boyfriend to prison, Todd, she's never going to forgive herself.",
        "Todd: Then she'd better stay away from him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I understand why it would be weird for you to be here, but you have to remember, it was an accident. You didn't mean to shoot Miles.",
        "Cole: No, I wasn't even man enough to admit what I did. And I let John cover for me.",
        "Langston: He didn't want you to ruin your life. You had just lost your mom; you were out of your mind with grief. You have to let it go, Cole, especially since no charges were filed and Miles is okay. You have to think about your future.",
        "Markko: I couldn't find your gloves, but I got these bad boys out of the lost- and-found.",
        "Langston: They're fine, thank you.",
        "Markko: Sure. So, are you going to go along with our plan, or what? I mean, I think it's worth it to see Starr, don't you?",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's worth it. Whew.",
        "Langston: I'll go get her.",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "Langston: Be right back.",
        "Markko: Hey -- be careful.",
        "Langston: Okay, I will. Bye.",
        "Cole: Whew. This better work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You know, I really don't want to talk to you right now.",
        "Blair: And I respect that. You don't have to talk to me -- but you can listen. I know how powerful and special first love is. I also know how much it hurts and how painful it is when it ends.",
        "Starr: \"When it ends\"? Cole and I -- we haven't ended things. Dad is just keeping us apart.",
        "Blair: I don't, you know, agree with what your daddy's done lately. But, Starr, you know, I do agree that you are way too young to be having sex.",
        "Starr: I told you that we didn't have sex. How many times do I need to tell you that?",
        "Blair: You love Cole, right? What -- what does that mean to you?",
        "Starr: You know what it means.",
        "Blair: No, no, I just -- I want to hear it from you, your own words. Tell me.",
        "Starr: It means that I want him to be happy, that I want to share everything with him, that I want to be there for him if he has any problems. Cole lost both of his parents and now -- I'm the only person that he has left. Do you think Cole only loves me because he lost his mom?",
        "Blair: No, no, no, I don't. I think Cole is going through a terrible, terrible time, and I know that you want to help him.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, then I don't understand what you're trying to say. What's your point?",
        "Blair: What I'm trying to say is that sometimes, Starr, when we love someone, sometimes we have to think about what is best for them and not what we think is best for us.",
        "Starr: I'm not a selfish person. I'm not a selfish person, okay?",
        "Blair: Starr, I know that you're not. I know you're not selfish. That's why I really want you to hear what I have to say. Just listen to me. Your father is taking that threat to send Cole to prison very seriously, sweetie. And I want you to think long and hard what that would do to Cole. Do you love him enough to let him go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I haven't seen her since -- well, that night.",
        "Markko: That must've been the worst night ever.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it was supposed to be the best. You know, and then Mr. Manning showed up screaming that I raped his daughter. I mean, I -- how could he think that? I would never hurt Starr.",
        "Markko: Well, look, you don't have to answer this, but why did he think that -- that you and Starr --",
        "Cole: Well, we were in bed.",
        "Markko: When he found you?",
        "Cole: Yeah, we thought it was our last night together.",
        "Markko: Well, you -- listen, you don't have to explain it to me. I mean, it makes sense you would want to take it to the next level.",
        "Cole: No -- see, no. It wasn't about taking it to the next level, or even saying goodbye. It was because we both love each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Starr: Mom, I really don't want to talk right now, okay?",
        "Langston: Starr, it's me. Cole's waiting for you at the docks.",
        "Starr: What? Are you kidding me?",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Starr: Okay, let's go.",
        "Langston: Okay, I'll get your coat.",
        "Starr: Okay, please just be careful, okay, Langston? Make sure nobody sees you.",
        "Langston: Okay.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, you never told me what happened when you went down to the police station to press charges against John.",
        "Todd: Changed my mind about that.",
        "Blair: Did you see Ramsey?",
        "Todd: No. The only thing you need to know, Blair, is I'm protecting my family. See you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Shane, I've already explained to you, honey -- the photos of your dad were lost.",
        "Lois: I'll go get the groceries. I left them outside.",
        "Viki: Do you need a hand, Lois? Lois: Oh, no, thanks, Mrs. Davidson, I can manage.",
        "Shane: You don't even have one of my dad? I just want to know what he looks like.",
        "Gigi: Well, you can't, I'm sorry. Now, can we just drop it, okay?",
        "Shane: Okay. You don't have to get mad.",
        "Viki: Well, isn't it nice that you have all your things, that all your boxes arrived from Texas?",
        "Gigi: Yes, I'm very happy.",
        "Viki: And Llanview will start to seem more like home now.",
        "Shane: See this? That's Mom and Rex. Doesn't her hair look funny?",
        "Viki: Oh -- would you look at that -- how cute are you two?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Gigi: Shane, help me clean up the mess, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: In the Asian market, then, is there anyone that you can think of that may have caused Grandpa any trouble?",
        "Nigel: I do recall several heated phone calls between Mr. Buchanan and Harris York about six months before his passing.",
        "Jared: Do you remember what was said?",
        "Nigel: I only heard Mr. Buchanan's side of the conversation, of course, and it mostly consisted of vulgarities frankly.",
        "Natalie: Renee? You okay?",
        "Renee: Oh, yes, I'm fine. I just -- I don't know, being here I thought might be too soon but actually it makes me feel closer to Asa.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Why don't we take a little break? You want to go for a little walk?",
        "Renee: Oh, I would love that -- to see any changes? Thank you, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Absolutely. I won't be long.",
        "Jared: Take your time.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Jared: Nigel, shall we keep going?",
        "Nigel: As you wish, Jared.",
        "Jared: All right. Okay.",
        "Nigel: You seem quite at home here.",
        "Jared: Do I? Well, I got what I thought I wanted.",
        "Nigel: What are you saying? Has something changed?",
        "Jared: Yeah, it's -- it's just something happened that I never expected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I don't want your money. I don't want anything from you or from Rex.",
        "Roxy: Well, I just want to know -- why are you going along with this so easily? And why are you treating my son like such a mensch?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Charlie: Because you told me that you wanted me to. You told me that it was a matter of life and death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hi, Viki. I hope it's not a bad time.",
        "Viki: Nope.",
        "Rex: I brought something for Shane and I also want to talk to my dad about that Sixers' game.",
        "Viki: Oh, great. Well, they're all around somewhere. I know Gigi and Shane were in the kitchen last time I looked. He's going to be really happy to see you.",
        "Rex: Great kid, huh?",
        "Vik: Yes, he is and it's very nice of you to take such an interest in him.",
        "Rex: Hey, it's nice for me, too.",
        "Viki: Yes, right, because he's -- he's the son of your old friend, right?",
        "Rex: Gigi and I were good buds -- hung out, made each other laugh. That was about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So you're telling me you did this just because I asked you to, just purely out of the goodness of your heart?",
        "Charlie: Well, Roxy, I don't know why you can't just accept what I told you.",
        "Roxy: Because it doesn't add up to me, it doesn't make any sense. Why are you putting on this act?",
        "Rex: What act? \u0091",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Are you thinking of ending this charade, telling the family you're not a Buchanan? Because if that's the case, it has to be handled properly. I still feel strongly that no one needs to know the real truth -- that David Vickers is Asa's son. I can help you leave town, Jared.",
        "Jared: I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up my life as a Buchanan.",
        "Nigel: But you're obviously having regrets.",
        "Jared: Yes, I am, I admit that.",
        "Nigel: Is it Natalie?",
        "Jared: No. I wish things could be different between Natalie and I, but they can't, okay?",

        "Rex: What were you guys talking about when we came in? Something about Charlie putting on an act?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. You know, I was saying that I think Llanview needs a little bit more culture. Like maybe we should have our own theater, and call ourselves \"The Llanview Players.\" And we could do a lot of one acts. Or maybe some full lengths.",
        "Charlie: Roxy -- what we were talking about -- and obviously, Roxy's a little worried about hurting your feelings, Rex -- is simply that, although I thoroughly enjoy our time together, I sometimes do feel a little awkward in my role as your father.",
        "Rex: Well, I hope I haven't made you feel awkward. Maybe I've been a little over the top about it.",
        "Charlie: No, no, you haven't at all. I just -- I mean, I just don't want to let you down.",

        "Langston: You know, I'll distract the guard. I'll figure something out. Just go meet Cole and Markko at the docks and I'll get there as soon as I can, okay?",

        "Langston: Yeah. Cole and Markko are meeting us there, pier 27.",
