        "Matthew and his parents are worried about what they do with his prognosis of a spinal cord injury that could leave him permanently paralyzed. Rex and Gigi are similarly worried about Shane's diagnosis of having leukemia, needing chemo and bone marrow transplants. Roxy goes to find Rex's bio father and secrets gets a sample from him. Unknown to her, Stacy is spying upon her and finds out that Rex's father is not dead and that Roxy is keeping a secret from her son. While she's out, Starr goes to talk to Schuyler and informs him that she's just found out that her baby could not have died from Rh disease, his mother was not negligent in finding it out and it was not his mother's fault. He investigates the situation but knows he cannot have any more contact with Starr. Brody and Jessica are together and start kissing. But they conclude that they should just stay friends for now. Natalie and Jessica are aware that it's probable that Jessica's baby died instead of Starr's and one of Jessica's alters switched the babies."

        "Schuyler: Starr --",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Schuyler: You can't -- you can't be here.",
        "Starr: Look, I need a friend, okay?",
        "Schuyler: What is -- is it your mom? Did something happen?",
        "Starr: No, she's still the same. She's still unconscious.",
        "Schuyler: Well, maybe you would feel better if you sat next to her.",
        "Starr: I can't. They only allow one visitor at a time, and right now my Aunt Dorian is there, and everyone is too busy to listen about my problems.",
        "Schuyler: Is it Cole?",
        "Starr: No. Well, kind of. It's about -- it's about our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: And the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again",
        "Jared: Sweetheart, you've been singing that same for, like, fifteen minutes, now.",
        "Natalie: She really likes it.",
        "Jared: I'm a little worried about you.",
        "Natalie: Don't be.",
        "Jared: Oh, that's easy.",
        "Natalie: I'm fine.",
        "Jared: No, you're not. Look, you love this baby more than life itself.",
        "Natalie: So do you.",
        "Jared: We're both scared we are going to lose her.",
        "Natalie: She's not Jessica's daughter. I mean, Jared, if you want to worry about somebody, worry about Chloe.",
        "[Chloe cries]",
        "Natalie: Worry about my family. What is this going to do to them, to find out this beautiful baby girl is Starr's and we have to give her back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: What is it? What's wrong with me?",
        "Bo: We were just talking to Dr. Shinseki about your tests.",
        "Matthew: Did you find out why I can't move my legs?",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah we did.",
        "Matthew: It's not temporary, is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Did you take me here to see Matthew? Is he okay? Can I see him?",
        "Gigi: Maybe later.",
        "Shane: Am I in trouble?",
        "Rex: Why would you think that?",
        "Shane: I don't know. Mom has that look.",
        "Gigi: What look?",
        "Shane: Like when I broke your DVD player. So, what did I do this time?",
        "Rex: Nothing. You didn't do anything.",
        "Shane: Then, what's wrong?",
        "Rex: When you were in the hospital last night, the doctors ran some tests.",
        "Shane: Yeah, the nurse said they give them to everyone. Just in case.",
        "Rex: Yeah, they do. When they got the test results back, they found something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: First of all, I don't want to be here. We perfectly clear on that? I could go for the rest of my life without looking at your ugly mug. But Shane is in big trouble, so I got to do what I got to do. And so do you. There's no way you're weaseling out on this. Stacy Grandson? Isn't Rex's father supposed to be dead?",
        "Roxy: You listen, and you listen good. Shane's got leukemia. I think he's going to be fine. The doctors are giving him chemo, and they're testing everybody for a bone marrow transplant. Gigi, her skanky sister, Rex, and even old Roxy. Don't think I forgot about you. Because even though Rex thinks you're dead, that doesn't mean you can't be of some help. [Laughing] What am I thinking? You give a damn about your grandson? Even if you weren't more than a potted houseplant? After everything you did to me, and to everybody else, you owe me. And I'm here to collect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: I have leukemia?",
        "Gigi: It's when your body makes too many white blood cells.",
        "Shane: I know what it is.",
        "Rex: You do?",
        "Shane: Yeah, Nick's dad had it. It's cancer, right?",
        "Gigi: Of the blood. Yeah, that's what Michael said.",
        "Shane: So did you guys have it?",
        "Rex: No, we didn't.",
        "Shane: Nick said his dad had it because other people in his family had leukemia.",
        "Gigi: I don't know about that.",
        "Shane: So, no one else in our family had it?",
        "Rex: Not -- not that we know of.",
        "Shane: Then why did I get it? What did I do wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Shinseki: The impact to your skull caused a dislocation of your vertebrae, which in turn, caused the trauma to your spinal cord. That's why you can't move your legs. But it could have been a lot worse. If the dislocation was any higher, if the cord had been severed, you'd be looking at a much more limited future.",
        "Matthew: What's more limited than being paralyzed? Because that's what I am, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I -- I have to go. I have to and pick up --",
        "Brody: I have to pack --",
        "Jessica: Yeah, if you need any help redecorating --",
        "Brody: That probably won't happen, but if I decide to put up some curtains --",
        "Jessica: Curtains. I'm great with curtains. Okay?",
        "Brody: Thanks for helping me get a deal on the place.",
        "Jessica: You know, Roxy is a little odd, but --",
        "Brody: I just got out of St. Ann's. I can handle odd.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, I'll see you later. Bye.",
        "Brody: Bye.",
        "Brody: Jess, wait.",
        "Brody and Jessica: We need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know, I really thought that Jess was getting better, but if Bess is keeping this secret from her, she's not fully integrated. She's just a house of cards.",
        "Jared: And if we start trying to tell her what we think happened --",
        "Natalie: The cards come tumbling down, and God only knows what's left of my sister.",
        "Jared: Or what she is going to do. Jess is tough, almost as tough as you.",
        "Natalie: You are telling me. She gave birth all alone, and then drove herself to the hospital so she didn't have to face what we are facing now.",
        "Jared: She is going to have to face it eventually, right?",
        "Natalie: I don't know what to do.",
        "Jared: I know what we can't do. We can't just say, \"Hey guess what, Jessica, we got a little hunch that Bess switched Chloe and Hope, so you might want to get ready to bring your daughter back to Starr, now.\"",
        "Natalie: What are you saying? That we should just keep this quiet?",
        "Jared: No. I'm saying we need proof.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So this is your place, huh?",
        "Schuyler: Okay, Starr, we can't do this right now.",
        "Starr: We're not doing anything.",
        "Schuyler: You're standing in my room.",
        "Starr: What, you think the vice principal is standing outside your door?",
        "Schuyler: No, it doesn't have to be her. It could be anyone, anyone who knows us, anyone who knows what happened.",
        "Starr: Oh, come on. We are just talking.",
        "Schuyler: That is not what it looks like to the school board. They're going to see you and me, alone together, in a hotel room, Starr.",
        "Starr: Okay, wait, so we can't even see each other again?",
        "Schuyler: No. No we can't.",
        "Starr: Why not? I need someone to talk to.",
        "Schuyler: About your baby?",
        "Starr: Yes.",
        "Schuyler: Well, that's your personal business, Starr, not mine.",
        "Starr: We both know that is not true.",
        "Schuyler: You know what, I -- I made a mistake. I made a mistake when I told you about what my mother wrote in the letter, and I think that from now on, it would be best if you confided in somebody a little more appropriate.",
        "Starr: You don't understand. What we found out wasn't just about my baby. It was about you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I can't believe I did that. I don't know what I was thinking. I wasn't thinking.",
        "Jessica: So this is talking?",
        "Brody: I had no right to do that. Not without making sure it was all right with you first.",
        "Jessica: Brody, what were you going to do? Were you going to submit a written request? It's not the Navy, and I don't know if you noticed, but that kiss was mutual.",
        "Brody: Actually, I did notice that.",
        "Jessica: Good.",
        "Brody: And I know it's not the Navy. I never got like this in the Navy.",
        "Jessica: Like what?",
        "Brody: Flustered.",
        "Jessica: Never?",
        "Brody: I would take lead scout on Patrol, no problem. I'd drop behind enemy lines, it's all part of the job. But this --",
        "Jessica: Not part of the job.",
        "Brody: All of sudden, I'm alone with you, and I don't know which way is up.",
        "Jessica: I feel the same way.",
        "Brody: So, what do we do now?",
        "Jessica: Well, you and I have had enough therapy to be able to talk this through.",
        "Brody: I can't pretend something didn't happen. Not when I know it did.",
        "Jessica: You're right. We have to face this head on. We should get through this, so we should start.",
        "Brody: Right.",
        "Jessica: You first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What we do know for sure, is that Bess was at the hospital at the same time Starr's baby was born.",
        "Jared: Yes, but now we know that Starr's baby didn't die from whatever the autopsy claims she died from.",
        "Natalie: Hmm, so we need to prove that Bess brought Jessica's baby to the hospital --",
        "Jared: And left with Starr's.",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] the only way we will be able to do that is with DNA evidence.",
        "Jared: At least we have experience.",
        "Natalie: Well, it shouldn't be too hard to get hair from Jessica that we compare to Chloe's.",
        "Jared: But that's only going to prove that Chloe is not Jessica's. We still don't know where Jessica's real baby is.",
        "Natalie: I have a sick feeling that she is buried at St. James cemetery.",
        "Jared: Okay, well how do we find Chloe's mother?",
        "Natalie: The first thing we do is compare Chloe's DNA to Starr's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: What does your baby have to do with me?",
        "Starr: It's more about your mom.",
        "Schuyler: Starr --",
        "Starr: I found out hope didn't die from Rh disease.",
        "Schuyler: What is that supposed to mean? What, my mom lied?",
        "Starr: No, it's what the autopsy said.",
        "Schuyler: So the pathologist was wrong.",
        "Starr: Has to be.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, how do you even know this in the first place?",
        "Starr: Cole and I found out that we are both Rh negative.",
        "Schuyler: That means your blood is compatible.",
        "Starr: Right. So hope couldn't have died from Rh disease. And your mom blamed herself because she didn't test Cole while I was pregnant. But the thing is, is that it wouldn't make a difference.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so what you're saying, is that my mom may not have been responsible for Hope's death.",
        "Starr: Right.",
        "Schuyler: So she killed herself for nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: If it wasn't for Shane, I would never darken your doorstep again. Hopefully, Shane is not going to need your bone marrow, or anything else you got. I was tested this morning, but the results haven't come back yet. It's kind of like the lottery. You've got to be in it to win it. So don't be a wuss, because it ain't going to hurt you, although, I would really like it if it did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You think you did something wrong? That's why you got leukemia?",
        "Gigi: Shane, you don't get leukemia because you broke the DVD player.",
        "Shane: What if I did something worse than that?",
        "Gigi: What did you do?",
        "Shane: Nothing, never mind.",
        "Rex: Shane, you can tell us. Shane, whatever it is, we can handle it.",
        "Shane: Maybe it's because it took me so long for me to get used to you being my dad. Maybe it's because I tried not to like you for so long.",
        "Gigi: Shane, no, no. Shane, look at me. You don't get leukemia because -- you don't get leukemia as a punishment. Just as many good people get it as bad people do.",
        "Shane: How do you know?",
        "Gigi: Because I know you, and you have it, and you're the best kid in the whole world. We all had to get used to being a family.",
        "Shane: I guess.",
        "Rex: And now, we are one and we are going to get through this.",
        "Shane: I already have asthma. Why did I have to get leukemia, too?",
        "Rex: Because you had bad luck. But that ends right now. It is just going to be good luck from here on out, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Don't think I'm getting my jollies from doing this. It's really hard to believe that I've done more than that with you. But at least I got Rex out of the deal, and Shane, and they're worth it, because I wouldn't trade them for the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Shinseki: I know you'll probably want to go over all of this in greater detail.",
        "Nora: You know, Dr. Shinseki, can we just -- can we have a moment?",
        "Dr. Shinseki: Of course.",
        "Nora: Thank you.",
        "Nora: Hey buddy. Hey, you. We need to have a man to mom talk, okay? I know this seems like it's really, really bad. But this is not the end of the world.",
        "Matthew: I guess you weren't listening.",
        "Nora: He's -- listen, Dr. Shinseki is a really good doctor. But he's not the only one. I mean, right now, your Uncle Clint is out there calling every high- priced specialist in the world.",
        "Matthew: They can help me?",
        "Nora: Sweetie, your spinal cord wasn't severed. That's really good news. And I just bet one of those geniuses is going to do exactly what he needs to do for you to get the fullest use of your legs.",
        "Matthew: But they can't help me walk.",
        "Nora: Sweetie, they are making advances in this area every single day.",
        "Matthew: But can they fix my legs?",
        "Nora: You're going to have a full and productive life. I promise you that.",
        "Matthew: Just tell me. Am I going to be like this for the rest of my life? Just please, be straight with me. Am I going to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair?",
        "Bo: Worst-case scenario. Yeah.",
        "Nora: Hey kiddie, do you want to play some hearts?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Nora: How about some gin rummy? I knew I had a pack of cards somewhere in here.",
        "Matthew: You don't have to entertain me like I'm a little kid. Just please go away.",
        "Bo: Son, where are we going to go?",
        "Matthew: Please.",
        "Nora: Matthew, honey, don't shut us out.",
        "Matthew: I'm not trying to shut you out. I just -- I just need to be by myself.",
        "Nora: Well, I got news for you kiddo. We are all in this together.",
        "Bo: Your mom is right.",
        "Nora: And, we're going to stay here. We're not going anywhere, because we have a lot of work to do.",
        "Matthew: No we don't.",
        "Bo: Come on, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: This is the way it's going to be from now on. There is nothing you can do about it.",
        "Nora: That is not true.",
        "Matthew: Yes it is. I did this to myself, and now I have to live with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: So, how do we get a sample of Starr's DNA without anybody finding out?",
        "Natalie: You know, we were planning on going to La Boulaie to help out, because of what happened to Blair.",
        "Jared: So we just swipe some DNA while we are popping in the tuna casserole? Sweetie, Dorian has probably got that place on Defcon 5 after what happened with Blair.",
        "Natalie: Okay, but I'm Starr's cousin, and as much as Dorian doesn't like me, there's no reason for her to be suspicious of me.",
        "Jared: What if Starr is not there?",
        "Natalie: I'll excuse myself to the powder room, I'll sneak into Starr's room, and steal some hair from her brush.",
        "Jared: You taught Rex everything he knows, didn't you?",
        "Natalie: And then we'll be able to compare the hair to Chloe, and then once and for all, we'll know this beautiful baby here is Jessica's or Starr's.",
        "Jared: Well, that takes care of everything, except --",
        "Natalie: Except proving the baby that Starr buried is Jessica's.",
        "Jared: Yeah, we need to get that baby's DNA.",
        "Natalie: Well, I'm not going to have that poor baby exhumed.",
        "Jared: We don't have to. Do you remember what Marcie said?",
        "Natalie: About the baby's DNA?",
        "Jared: About the baby's hair. Starr keeps it inside of a locket.",
        "Natalie: That she never takes off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm so sorry. I thought that if I told you Hope's death wasn't because of your mom, it would make you feel better.",
        "Schuyler: I do. I do, I guess. I mean, I never stopped believing that she was good doctor.",
        "Starr: Look, she was. When she heard it was Rh disease, she couldn't believe it, because she knew it was so uncommon for first babies.",
        "Schuyler: She just assumed from the report that Cole was Rh positive. I mean, if she just checked -- you know, if she checked.",
        "Starr: She would still be here. Look, this isn't making you feel any better, is it?",
        "Schuyler: I don't know.",
        "Starr: Okay, look at it this way. At least you were right. Your mom was a really good doctor.",
        "Schuyler: Thank you. Thank you, that means a lot to me. But now, all I have are just more and more questions, and it's --",
        "Starr: Believe me, so do I.",
        "Schuyler: You know what I want? I just -- all I want is for my mom, and your baby, to have peace, finally.",
        "Starr: Me too.",
        "Schuyler: But that's not going to happen until we find out how your baby died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You've been a really good friend to me.",
        "Jessica: So have you.",
        "Brody: I haven't done anything.",
        "Jessica: Yes, you have. Yes, you have. Every other person in my life, every other relationship is complicated. You know, they don't trust me and I don't blame them. I have to prove to them that I'm not crazy or something. But, with you --",
        "Brody: It's simple.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, and we made it complicated. I've hurt everyone in my life, and I don't want to do the same to you.",
        "Brody: That kiss was a mistake. You think so, too, don't you?",
        "Shane: So, if I'm sick, how come I don't feel bad?",
        "Rex: Michael told us it's pretty normal for leukemia to sneak up on people.",
        "Shane: Then how do you know that you're sick?",
        "Gigi: Blood tests, mainly. When Michael described the symptoms, it started to make sense. Remember how you had to stay home for a few days after New Year's?",
        "Shane: I was too tired to play galactic invaders.",
        "Rex: I thought I won fair and square.",
        "Shane: That was because I have leukemia?",
        "Rex: And, do you remember when you got that big bruise when we played touch football on Thanksgiving?",
        "Gigi: The one you kept showing Bobby?",
        "Shane: He said he had never gotten one that big before.",
        "Gigi: Michael said that was because of the leukemia, too.",
        "Shane: So, that's how it started for me?",
        "Rex: We think so, buddy.",
        "Shane: So, what happens when I get really sick? Nick's dad died of leukemia. Am I going to die, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: That wasn't so hard, was it? Well, maybe it was for you. You're not very big on doing the right thing, so maybe the first time would sting a lot. But, our grandson needs help, and you're going to help him whether you want to or not. I'm going to the hospital. I would tell you to say a prayer for him, but who the hell am I kidding? You know, a long time ago, the big guy upstairs threw you out. So, do us all a favor, stay here and stay dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy Okay. Well, that wasn't weird at all. Why is Roxy keeping Rex's father such a big secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm with you 100%.",
        "Brody: Do you think the kiss was a mistake?",
        "Jessica: Well, I feel something for you, definitely more than friendship.",
        "Brody: Me, too.",
        "Jessica: If I wasn't fresh out of St. Ann's, and trying to convince two little girls --",
        "Brody: Look, I have a lot to figure out, too. I don't even have a job or anything else.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm here for curtains.",
        "Brody: I wish you were here for all of it. But that wouldn't be fair. I mean, if it was more than I could handle --",
        "Jessica: You can handle more than you think.",
        "Brody: I know I'm getting better. But I also know I shot Rex, and he's --",
        "Jessica: Like a brother to my sister, I know.",
        "Brody: Right. I don't want to hurt you, either, or screw up things for you and your family.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I've done enough of that myself.",

        "Schuyler: What about your Aunt Dorian? She's a doctor.",
        "Starr: Oh, please, she's in full-blown crisis mode. My dad is in jail again, and all the bad things keep happening to me at the same exact time. Why? I just feel -- I feel so alone.",

        "Matthew: Yeah, but I was the loser who actually thought Becca liked me. And I was the one who, at the dance, everyone was laughing at. And I wanted to get out of there so bad, but I got into the car with someone who I knew was high, and was stupid enough not to wear my seatbelt.",
