        "Starr: So, you never told me what your musical was about, and congratulations on finishing it. See? You never thought that you would, and here you are, already starting auditions.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: So, what's it about?",
        "Langston: You know, girl meets boy, that kind of thing.",
        "Starr: Yeah. Which girl? What boy?",
        "Langston: I think it's gonna have to depend on casting. Isn't that your sister?",
        "Starr: Oh. Dani, don't you have class?",
        "Dani: So?",
        "Starr: So, why aren't you there?",
        "Dani: Because I'm the bad daughter, remember?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I know you love it at Warwick, Zane. You could still go there, just maybe as a day student. You know, hang on. That's my other line. Let me get rid of it. Oh.",
        "[Beep beep]",
        "Kelly: Sorry. Your mom is a popular gal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Fine. Don't take my calls. I'm gonna leave message number 5, I think. I read \"Raising Zane\" today, and I loved it, and I want you to come work for me. I'm gonna sweeten the deal. I want to top off my last offer with 100 grand. Oh, you don't remember what my last offer was. Well, I guess you're gonna have to call me back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Why do I want you to come back home to live with me? Because I love you and I miss you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I need to head over to the high school.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: They want me to sign some papers for Starr.",
        "Dorian: If you see Langston, would you ask her to call me? I keep leaving her messages. Of course, she texts me back. I should be glad that she's alive and well, but, really, I'd like to hear her voice, see her face. She is, after all, my daughter.",
        "Blair: Oh, she certainly is.",
        "Dorian: And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Blair: It means she's in way over her head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: And fade out.",
        "Cole: What, are you done?",
        "Markko: Yeah. This treatment is gonna rock Ford's world.",
        "[Cole laughs]",
        "Cole: Ford? Since when do you try to impress him?",
        "Markko: We're not buddies or anything, but he does know what he's talking about, at least enough to know that he could never dream up anything half as serious as what I got here.",
        "Cole: Showing the man up, right?",
        "Markko: By any means possible.",
        "Cole: Okay.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Okay.",
        "[Langston sighs]",

        "Destiny: Mr. Vega. Are you okay?",
        "Cristian: Uh, yeah. Yeah. What do you need, Destiny?",
        "Destiny: Your eyes on my project. I've been looking at the thing so long, I can't even see it anymore.",
        "Cristian: Okay. Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You'll see, Cristian. All you need is a little stroll down memory lane, and you'll remember why we need to be together.",
        "Todd: Hey. How are you? Aah! Geez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dani, who says you're the bad daughter?",
        "Dani: Everybody. Haven't you heard? I'm detention Dani, the girl most likely to be expelled.",
        "Starr: Well, the skipping class isn't going to exactly improve your odds.",
        "Dani: Exactly. It'll guarantee it.",
        "Starr: So, you want to be expelled.",
        "Dani: I want Todd to have to pony up another mil or two.",
        "Starr: My dad doesn't care about money.",
        "Dani: Oh, he will once he doesn't have any left. I figure it'll cost him 30 million to get me into the college of my choice and at least double that to keep me in there.",
        "Starr: You're forgetting that you're not his only child, Dani.",
        "Dani: Oh, don't worry. I'll leave a little for you and Hope and our brothers. A little.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait.",
        "Jessica: Hey, get the hell out of here. What are you doing here?",
        "Todd: I'm your Uncle Todd.",
        "Jessica: I remember my Uncle Todd, and you don't look anything like him.",
        "Todd: All right. Hold on. Wait. Just wait a second.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Todd: Ah. Look at that. That's a picture.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's me, but if that's you, where's your scar, and what happened to your hair?",
        "Todd: I had plastic surgery. Well, forget it. It's a long story. Suffice to say, a lot has changed since you were in high school.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You're late.",
        "Dani: It's a still life. It's not like it's going anywhere.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Cristian: Just grab a pad and sit down, Danielle.",
        "Dani: Hey, teach, looks like someone is passing notes in class. Let's see who it is.",
        "Cristian: Put it on my desk.",
        "Dani: \"Dear Jessie -- \" uh-oh. Looks like the world's oldest senior is in big trouble.",
        "Cristian: Danielle --",
        "Dani: \"Meet me by the ball field.\" Wonder what they do there. \"Love, Cris\"? Mr. Vega, are you dating Jessica Buchanan? That's just wrong. I mean, isn't she your student?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: The only thing that this picture proves, that we're in the same place at the same time.",
        "Todd: All right. Here. Look at this -- my driver's license.",
        "Jessica: Oh, please. Any high schooler with half a brain can get a fake I.D.",
        "Todd: Would any high schooler save your life? Do you remember C.J. and the whole thing with Marty? You were in a car crash, and I saved you from plummeting to your death.",
        "Jessica: You could've read about that.",
        "Todd: How about that time when you slobbered all over my silk shirt because you didn't make editor of the school paper? You remember that I offered to T.P. the other girl's house and then you were so upset that I took you home and I made you chocolate milk with cheerios, which was your favorite?",
        "Jessica: Uncle Todd?",
        "Todd: Yeah, now and forever.",
        "[Sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone beeping]",
        "Kelly: How many messages, Todd? 4? 5?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I knew that boy was too good to be true.",
        "Blair: If you're talking about Markko, I don't think he's the issue here, Dorian, and listen. I normally wouldn't say anything, but I really think that you should know --",
        "Dorian: No. Don't say anything. Don't tell me another --",
        "Blair: Why not?",
        "Dorian: Because if I want to do things differently, I have to stop making the same mistakes.",
        "Blair: But you are her mother, and she really needs you right now.",
        "Dorian: Yes. She needs me to respect her opinions, her wishes, and if she wishes to move out, live someplace else, that is her decision. Hi, Kelly. I wont say anything unless, of course, she asks for my opinion, but as long as she is safe, then I am not going to interfere.",
        "Blair: Uh --",
        "[Kelly and Blair laugh]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Wha -- oh, you're kidding me.",
        "Cole: All right. What is it?",
        "Markko: These aren't my storyboards. This is Langston's -- looks like the script to her musical. We must've grabbed each other's folders this morning.",
        "Markko: Man, do you mind dropping by the high school on the way back to L.U. I've got to find Lang and trade her these for my storyboards. I really need them for class.",
        "Cole: Uh, no. You go ahead. You know, my seminar was cancelled, so I'm meeting Hannah here.",
        "Markko: Hannah the hottie?",
        "Cole: Oh, come on, not you, too.",
        "Markko: The walls have ears, my friend, and Starr, when she gets going --",
        "Cole: Yeah. She's pretty vocal on the subject, but it's okay. You know, Hannah is cool.",
        "Markko: All right, if you say so. I'm just saying, if Langston caught me partnering up with someone who looked like Hannah \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Hannah, did we have an appointment?",
        "Hannah: Now I need an appointment?",
        "Ford: Well, this is my office. I'm working.",
        "Hannah: Ford, we need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Oh, my God! Are you sexting?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: This is none of your business, Danielle. Think you need to focus on yourself and your class work, which you haven't started; your homework, which I haven't seen; and your attitude, which is getting you nowhere. Now, look. I know you've had it rough, so I'm gonna cut you some slack. There's still time to pull up your grade, and this goes for all of you. You sign up to help me work on the sets for the spring musical, you can pull your grade up one whole point, so if you have a B-plus, you work hard, you get yourself an \"A.\"",
        "Destiny: And if you've got a C\"?",
        "Cristian: If you've got a B-minus, you can pull it up to a B-plus. Come on, guys. I'm taking names. It'll be fun. You know, this was written by one of your seniors here at Llanview High -- Langston Wilde.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You know, it's not what you think.",
        "Starr: So, Markko didn't just send you a picture of his naked self.",
        "Langston: Markko? Oh.",
        "Starr: Look. I know how much Markko loves his cameras. Remember, he took that video of you guys --",
        "Langston: Yes.",
        "Starr: But his parents saw it. Do you remember how embarrassing that was? And when you send a picture like that on the internet, then it's out there for good, and you can't take it back, and it could end up on some site.",
        "Langston: I know. I know. I'm sorry. I've just been really tense lately.",
        "Starr: Well, yeah. You're in school. Markko is in school. It's hard to find time. Cole and I barely get time alone, and when we do, we're either too tired or Hope wakes up.",
        "Langston: So, you understand?",
        "Starr: Yeah. Of course I understand.",
        "Langston: Then you'll cover for me. I have to get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You know what? This isn't a good time.",
        "Hannah: It never is. You ignore my calls, my texts, my e-mails.",
        "Ford: Hannah, do you really want to have this conversation?",
        "Hannah: I think you owe me that much. I mean, we slept together.",
        "Ford: Yeah. We did, and we had a great time, but that's all it was.",
        "Hannah: Not to me.",
        "Ford: All right. Look. I thought we understood each other. I never promised you anything. You want a boyfriend? You have to look someplace else. I'm done. \"Where are u?\"",
        "[Typing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So, you're skipping school to hook up with Markko?",
        "Langston: No! No. Of course not. That's not gonna happen, but you're right. I can't have these pictures flying around, so I need to go over there and make sure that it doesn't happen again. It's just too much with class and practice and --",
        "Starr: And sign-ups. Langston, you have sign-ups for the musical.",
        "Langston: Look. All you have to do would be taking down names and numbers. If they have questions, I'll call them back. Look. I know everybody who's coming today, so it's not gonna be a problem. It's just, I have to take care of this right now, or I'm gonna lose it. I can't think. I can't sleep.",
        "Starr: Okay, okay, okay. Langston, I'll cover for you.",
        "Langston: You're the best.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Anyone? There's gonna be some serious power tools, tons of wood, paints, canvases. I mean, you could really let your creativity rip. What about you, Matthew? I heard you missed a lot of class earlier this year. This is a good way to make it up. You don't want to have to repeat art, do you?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Cristian: What about you, Destiny? Don't you want to pull your grade up?",
        "Destiny: I'd like to, but I've got a conflict.",
        "[Bell rings]",
        "Cristian: Come on, guys. Do your art teacher a favor.",
        "Destiny: Maybe next time.",
        "Cristian: Hold up, Danielle. We need to talk about your behavior.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Sorry about that.",
        "Todd: It's all right. I'll survive. So, where's Viki?",
        "Jessica: She's in London. She took my -- she took Bree to go and visit her cousins.",
        "Todd: She went to London without consulting me?",
        "Jessica: Apparently. Why? What's your problem?",
        "Todd: Thank you. My problem is that my daughter won't speak to me.",
        "Jessica: I saw Starr after class. She didn't say you two were fighting.",
        "Todd: What class?",
        "Jessica: High school. I re-enrolled.",
        "Todd: Why?",
        "Jessica: Because I don't remember graduating.",
        "Todd: Wow, Mitch really did a number on you, didn't he? Anyway, Starr is not the problem. Dani is.",
        "Jessica: Who's Dani?",
        "Todd: Danielle, my other daughter with T\u00e9a.",
        "Jessica: Danielle Rayburn is your daughter?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I know. That's what I thought. Anyway, yes. She's at the same high school, so if you see her in the hall, put in a good word for me. Oh, and if you see your friend Kelly, tell her to quit stalling and come work for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Listen. I'm serious. There will be no more interfering.",
        "Kelly: Oh, that's good. You want to put that in writing, Dorian?",
        "Blair: Oh, you sign it, I'm gonna frame it. Ha ha ha!",
        "Dorian: All right. That just proves I do need to change.",
        "Kelly: Hear, hear.",
        "Blair: Yeah. 100 bucks says you can't make it till happy hour.",
        "Kelly: Okay. 200.",
        "Blair: Oh, snap.",
        "Dorian: I beg your pardon?",
        "Kelly: Dorian, the day you stop meddling is the day I stop buying shoes that hurt my feet. It's just who we are.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. You'll see.",
        "Kelly: Next time. I have to catch a plane.",
        "Blair: Wait. What, you're leaving?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I got to get back to London.",
        "Dorian: Over my dead body.",
        "Kelly: D'oh!",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah!",
        "Kelly: Got you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It'll be a snap. Just talk me up to them.",
        "Jessica: To your daughter and -- I'm sorry. Why do you want me to talk to Kelly?",
        "Todd: She's my future most important employee.",
        "Jessica: Right. Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: Now, be sympathetic with your uncle. He's dying.",
        "Jessica: Well, have you tried talking to them?",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah. I've tried talking to them, leaving them messages, buying expensive gifts.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's smothering them.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Jessica: Oh, why don't you give them some room?",
        "Todd: Well, because they'll get away then.",
        "Jessica: Well, if you give them half a chance, maybe they'll come back.",
        "Todd: Oh, no, no. That kind of thing only works if you're nice. If you're like me, it's full-court press, or it's nothing. See, you can't give them a chance to think. If they think, then they realize they can't stand you, and then they'll never come back.",
        "Jessica: So, you've been working on your self-esteem.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I bring a lot to the party, but what I actually need is a spokeswoman like you to sell me.",
        "Jessica: Achhh --",
        "Todd: Well, you can tell them that you feel bad for me because I was so hurt and you offered to fix things.",
        "Jessica: I offered to lose my best friend and to get detention Dani upset with me?",
        "Todd: Detention Dani?",
        "Jessica: Well, she gets in a lot of trouble.",
        "Todd: Yeah. That's because of me. You see that? I need to get through to her.",
        "Jessica: Well, you need to get through to me first.",
        "Todd: Well, what do you want?",
        "Jessica: Cristian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Why are you cutting class?",
        "Dani: Because I don't feel like art today, okay?",
        "Cristian: No. It's not okay. You can't just waltz in here whenever you feel like it and disrupt the students. It's unfair to them, and it's disrespectful to me. Look. You don't feel like art? Just don't show up to class.",
        "Dani: Fine. Are we done?",
        "Cristian: I'll see you in detention.",
        "Dani: I can't. I promised Matthew.",
        "Cristian: And I promised the drama club. It looks like we'll both have to change our plans.",
        "Dani: You're just doing this because I outed you and Jessica Buchanan.",
        "Cristian: Do you hear yourself? You sound like Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, dear, you're going after Cristian again?",
        "Jessica: Hello? Still in high school.",
        "Todd: I have to tell you this because you're my niece. Cristian was a mistake. Now, you've been given a free pass here. You can correct all those bad calls, so why don't you go find yourself a really nice guy, someone your actual age?",
        "Jessica: Hey, you're not listening to me. I love him.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but he loves, uh -- what's her name? Evangeline's sister?",
        "Jessica: Who's Evangeline?",
        "Todd: Oh, oh, Jessica, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but, you know, you're a lot of work right now.",
        "Jessica: Are you talking about Layla? Because that's never gonna last. All I have to do is remind him of how it used to be.",
        "Todd: Isn't there a part of you that realizes that's a mistake? He's moved on, and so have you, and once you remember, you know, Nash and all those --",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, no, but that's just it. I have remembered. I remembered how much Cris and I meant to each other, how special that we were, and once he remembers that, he'll come back to me. I know he will.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I wouldn't count on it, sweetie.",
        "Jessica: No, but I gave him this box of mementos of stuff that we had when we were together, like pictures and notes and drawings that he did, and I saw his face when he opened it, and he still feels something for me.",
        "Todd: Well -- ha ha! I just think you can do better.",
        "Jessica: Why do you hate Cristian?",
        "Todd: Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because he used to hang with Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Kelly, I forbid you to go back to London.",
        "Blair: Oh, well, I think that sounds a lot like meddling to me. Look. If she wants to go back home, let her go home.",
        "Dorian: This is her home.",
        "Blair: Kelly, don't let the door hit you on your way out.",
        "Kelly: Thanks, Blair.",
        "Blair: You know what? I would pretend that I was gonna miss you, but I don't think I would be able to pull that one off, and besides, I need to head over to the high school. I got to sign some papers for Starr.",
        "Dorian: Give Starr my love.",
        "Blair: I will. Kelly, if I don't see you before you leave --",
        "Dorian: Oh, you will see her. Yes, indeed. You can count on that. Kelly, you can't leave. You just got here.",
        "Kelly: My son needs me, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: He's in boarding school. Ooh, at the end of the term, we'll send for him.",
        "Kelly: My life is in London.",
        "Dorian: London is so over. I mean, your life is here -- your home, your family, connections. Why, you can relaunch yourself.",
        "Kelly: As your prot\u00e9g\u00e9? Now, Dorian, you admit it. The only reason you want me here is because none of your Cramer girls need you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Took you long enough. Come on in.",
        "[Ford clucks tongue]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Name, your number, and your e-mail.",
        "Markko: Where's Langston?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, Hannah, it's me -- Cole. I'm at the diner. Call me if you want me to order you something, okay? I'm here. All right. Bye.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Langston: Oh, okay. Okay. You have class.",
        "Ford: Hey, we have plenty of time.",
        "Langston: All right, so let's talk.",
        "Ford: Is that why you came here, to talk?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, Hannah, it's me again. Did I get the times mixed up? Because I thought it was today at the diner. Um, anyway, well, just give me a call and let me know, okay? All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I thought she was meeting up with you.",

        "Starr: Actually, I don't really know, but the last one she wrote was amazing. She's a really great writer.",

        "Dorian: Absolutely. I mean, look what you did with the \"Sun.\" It was a must- read when you were there. Why, you beat Todd Manning at his own game.",

Why don't you forget the past, forget that your life since high school ever happened, that you didn't date this string of losers, which happened, and that you never fell for Cris?",
        "Jessica: But I don't want to forget about Cris, okay? I love him, and so what? So time marches on. So what? It doesn't change the fact that I was his first love and he was mine. So he has a girlfriend now. Big deal. What am I supposed to do with all these feelings? Am I just supposed to pretend that I don't have them? Am I just supposed to pretend that they're not real? I can't do that. I love him, and I have this family and daughter that I don't remember. All I remember is how I feel about Cris. He's all I have. I can't let him go.",

        "Blair: No. No, but it could be dangerous. You know, first loves, well, they're a bitch. So are seconds, thirds. That's why I stay as far away from Todd Manning as I possibly can.",

        "Blair: Well, come on. You're the teacher. Just be professional and keep your distance.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but how? She throws herself at me, and then the little pictures and the little notes, I can't help thinking about how it was, not that I want to go back there.",
