        "Roxy: So when is Adriana coming back from Paris?",
        "Rex: A week, give or take.",
        "Roxy: Well, she better come back quick, or else that Gigi girl is going to be moving in real quick for the give-and-take.",
        "Rex: Roxy, have I not told you, like, a thousand times Gigi and I are friends?",
        "Roxy: Okay, well, is that why Gigi is saving all those photos of you and her from back in the day?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Hey!",
        "Gigi: Hi.",
        "Marcie: Come on in.",
        "Gigi: Are you sure this is okay?",
        "Marcie: Oh, please, it's totally fine. Are you kidding me? There is no one else I would rather spend the day with.",
        "Shane: I could've stayed at Llanfair, but Lois had the day off.",
        "Gigi: Anyway, he's not really sick; he just has a little sore throat. I just didn't want to risk sending him to school, you know?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Shane: Mom, can I play that video game Rex got me?",
        "Gigi: Shane, we have discussed this -- no video games on school days. But you can read the comic he gave you because at least that's reading.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Marcie: You know, I -- I still think it's really weird that you knew Rex in high school. But I think it's great that you're friends with him. Yeah, I'm really good friends with him and -- and Adriana. Have you met her yet?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Gigi: A few times.",
        "Marcie: Did they, um, tell you or mention if they set a wedding date yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Antonio, you look exhausted.",
        "Antonio: I stayed up all night it didn't help thinking about Jamie's future. You know, with the inheritance gone and --",
        "Talia: So -- so Jamie won't have everything handed to her. So she'll have to work one day and, you know, make it on her own. Why is that such a bad thing, Antonio? Your little girl is loved so much, there's -- there's nothing more important than that.",
        "Antonio: You're right.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Talia: Hi.",
        "John: Ramsey here? I still want to know why he put us on that assignment last night. What'd he say when you asked him?",
        "Antonio: I didn't.",
        "John: Why not?",
        "Ramsey: \"Why not\" what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Next time, leave your damn post and do your job.",
        "Blair: Who was that?",
        "Todd: Idiot security company reporting a trespasser. Was Cole here last night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Starr, talk to me.",
        "Starr: There's nothing to talk about, Langston.",
        "Langston: Starr, look at me! Why did you do that last night? That stuff you wrote to Cole -- I know you didn't mean it.",
        "Starr: I wrote what I had to write.",
        "Langston: But not what you feel.",
        "Starr: It doesn't matter, Langston.",
        "Langston: Of course it matters! You broke Cole's heart! He was so desperate to see you, he risked everything for you! Starr, he came here last night.",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "Langston: What do you mean, you \"know\"?",
        "Starr: I heard him, Langston, I heard him calling for me.",
        "Langston: You heard him and you didn't even answer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: \"I think it's better if we don't see each other anymore.\"",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Jared: What's up, bro? You want to go for a run?",
        "Cole: No, thanks.",
        "Jared: Trouble? Is it you and Starr?",
        "Cole: There is no \"me and Starr.\"",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jared: Oh -- uh -- hang on one second, I got to -- I got to take this. Hello?",
        "Natalie: It's me.",
        "Jared: You're already at the office?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I just wanted to get a report written up from that meeting last night for Dad and Uncle Bo.",
        "Jared: With Renee and Nigel? Wow, some memory -- I didn't see you taking any notes.",
        "Natalie: I didn't need to, I recorded it.",
        "Jared: Really?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, Grandpa always said taking notes is a waste of time. Anytime you want to remember a meeting, the best thing to do is record it. That way, you got everything there -- what they said, how they said it -- and I got to tell you, he is so right. I mean, you'll never believe how much you hear when you actually hit \"play\" -- stuff you never would've remembered.",
        "Nigel: Are you thinking of ending this charade -- telling the family you're not a Buchanan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Exactly how cozy were the two of you back in the day?",
        "Rex: Roxy, it was a high school thing. We -- we went to the movies, did each other's homework, cracked each other up occasionally -- no big deal.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, maybe not to you.",
        "Rex: To either of us.",
        "Roxy: Would a woman save all those photos of the two of you if it were no big deal?",
        "Rex: Roxy, can we drop this, please?",
        "Roxy: So, just how old is her son, exactly?",
        "Rex: He's 9 -- and I'm not his father.",
        "Roxy: You quite sure of that?",
        "Rex: Yes, I'm sure. His dad was a Navy Seal, died in combat.",
        "Roxy: Well, that's a real tragedy. So where are all those pictures of him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Are you sure you're okay with this? I feel bad about leaving you with a sick kid.",
        "Marcie: Gigi -- Gigi, not only am I okay with it, but there is nothing else that I'd rather do than spend the day with Shane.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Marcie: It's a really sweet picture, isn't it? Rex was Tommy's godfather.",
        "Gigi: Rex looks really happy there holding him.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Shane: Mom has tons of pictures of Rex, too.",
        "Gigi: His ears have poles on them. Shane, go to sleep.",
        "Marcie: I -- uh -- I -- I know that you knew Rex back in high school, but I didn't realize that --",
        "Shane: He was her boyfriend.",
        "Gigi: He -- Shane! He was -- he was not. Um -- you know that, Shane. We were just friends. It was high school, it was nothing.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gigi: Um -- honey, I'm leaving now, so I want you to feel better, okay? I love you.",
        "Shane: Love you, too.",
        "Gigi: Thanks again, this is such a big help.",
        "[Marcie giggles]",
        "Marcie: Don't you dare thank me, okay? It's totally my pleasure. You make sure you have everything?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: All right, all right, well, come on --",
        "Gigi: Bye, I'll call you.",
        "Marcie: Don't worry; he's going to be fine.",
        "Gigi: I'll call you on my lunch break.",
        "Marcie: Okay. Get out, go to work.",
        "Gigi: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Exactly how much of yesterday's meeting did you record?",
        "Natalie: Um, all of it -- and then some.",
        "Jared: What does that mean?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I kind of forgot to turn the darn thing off. Remember when Renee and I went for that little tour?",
        "Jared: You mean when Nigel and me were left alone?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you guys were still in the room.",
        "Jared: How far have you gotten listening and -- and writing your report?",
        "Natalie: I guess about middle of the meeting.",
        "Jared: Um -- you know what? Can -- can you -- can you stop that for just a second and -- and do me a huge favor? I -- I downloaded some files in the boardroom computer and -- you know, stuff for the -- the oil consortium in Dubai -- and I really need them printed out.",
        "Natalie: Now?",
        "Jared: Yeah, I need it ASAP. I'm -- I'm running a little late, and -- and I was supposed to get on it first thing. I'll owe you big. Please?",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Natalie: Fine.",
        "Jared: Thank you. Natalie recorded everything on tape -- including our conversation.",
        "Nigel: So Natalie knows?",
        "Jared: She -- she won't if I get down there quickly. Um -- ahem -- Cole, I -- I hate to bail, dude, but I -- I got to go to the office. We'll kick it later? Keep your eye on him, okay? I -- good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole and me -- our relationship has been nothing but trouble from the very beginning, and what's the point of that, you know? Life is just too short.",
        "Langston: But you love him, Starr. How can you just give up?",
        "Starr: Conversation over, Langston.",
        "Langston: You love him, Starr. Tell me I'm wrong. Look me right in the eyes and say, \"I don't love Cole.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Why would Cole come here last night? Why would he risk doing that?",
        "Todd: The security company said they heard someone yelling near the back of the house.",
        "Blair: And they didn't hunt him down?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Stupid company you hired there, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Well, it's -- it's a big property. I guess I'm going to have to hire more guards.",
        "Blair: No, no, no, you don't need to do that. Starr said that she's going to stay away from Cole, all right?",
        "Todd: Yeah, but I don't trust him to stay away from her. Of course.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't tell me you're talking about moving us maybe to Alaska this time?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, we'll move back to the penthouse. Yeah, we'll move back to the penthouse, it's a fortress there. 24-hour doorman and surveillance cameras everywhere -- Cole couldn't touch her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Actually, we were just wondering about the small-time assignment last night. Busting amateur bootleggers -- why waste detective man-hours on a case like that?",
        "Ramsey: Did we waste your precious time, officer? Was your job beneath you?",
        "John: Any uniform could've made that bust and you know it. There's important cases we could be working on. I don't know what the hell you're pulling, but there won't be any more cases like that. You understand?",
        "Ramsey: Do you feel that way, Detective Vega? Speak up if you do.",
        "Ramsey: Detective Vega doesn't seem to share your discontent for this job, John. I suggest you follow his lead -- keep your mouth shut and do your job.",
        "John: Hey, what was that? I know you were upset as I was about what went down last night.",
        "Antonio: Nothing to gain by going off on the commissioner.",
        "John: Oh, now he's the commissioner?",
        "Antonio: It's what he is, you might as well get used to it.",
        "John: Where's this coming from, huh? This guy doesn't have any respect for you; he doesn't have any respect for any of us. He just wants to push us all around. What are you going to do, just sit there and take it? I know you hate this as much as I do --",
        "Antonio: Don't tell me how I feel!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Get out of my way, Langston.",
        "Langston: I want you to tell me straight up that you don't love Cole.",
        "Starr: I can't love Cole. Okay? He needs to think that I am completely over him, because if he doesn't -- if he doesn't, he's going to know that I love him with all of my heart, and then he's not going to give up. He's never going to give up, and then things are going to be worse for him than they already are.",
        "Langston: How did it come to this? What did your dad threaten to do?",
        "Starr: I just want it to stop. Okay, Langston? The sooner I'm over Cole, the better it'll be for the both of us.",
        "Langston: How can you ever be over him? Just yesterday you were going on and on about how much you love him, how you'd do anything to see him or be with him.",
        "Starr: Sometimes when you love someone and you really love them, you have to do what's best for them -- even when it means giving them up.",
        "Langston: That doesn't sound like you, Starr.",
        "Starr: It is me. It's who I am now; it's who I have to be.",
        "Langston: How can your dad do this?",
        "Starr: It's done, and it's over.",
        "Langston: What your dad's doing to you, it's -- it's abuse, and he shouldn't get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Sure, Todd, why don't you get the penthouse back -- forget that somebody else already owns it.",
        "Todd: I'll buy it back.",
        "Blair: And what if the new owners don't want to give it back to you?",
        "Todd: I'll just make them an offer. Listen, this is real estate. It'll be the quickest --",
        "Starr: Just getting my laptop.",
        "Todd: Good morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Of course Gigi has pictures of Shane's dad. Why would you think otherwise?",
        "Roxy: You know, it's a funny thing -- I was talking to Lois, and she told me that the kid was asking about those pictures, and Gigi said that they were lost.",
        "Rex: When did you become friends with Lois?",
        "Roxy: I do her hair. She's a real good client of mine.",
        "Rex: And she just happened to mention Shane's dad?",
        "Roxy: Well, I kind of put the squeeze on her.",
        "Rex: No. You?",
        "Roxy: Me, yes. I think I have a right to know certain things about my son.",
        "Rex: We're not talking about me, Roxy, we're talking about Gigi Morasco. And no, you have no business prying into her life -- which, by the way, is not a walk in the park, okay? She's raising a kid on her own, busting her butt to support them. The woman deserves respect, okay?",
        "Roxy: And don't I?",
        "Rex: We're not talking about you, either!",
        "Roxy: Okay, listen, I gave you to Aunt Corinne because I loved you and I wanted the best for you. You know, it's not easy having a kid in this world and feeling like a deadbeat!",
        "Rex: Of course not. And since I said something that you took offense to, that has nothing to do with you, I'm sorry. You came through for me in a way you could. You -- you did your best, and I couldn't ask for more. You're the best.",
        "Roxy: And I hope you feel like that forever. Please tell me that you will, please?",
        "Rex: Yes, I will! Rox, you're cutting off my circulation.",
        "Roxy: It's just because I love you to death! Listen, baby, I'm going to leave this here, and I just would like you to consider A.C. as a location, okay?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: I'll consider it.",
        "Roxy: Good thing that Shane kid isn't yours, because I think it would put a little damper on your honeymoon with Princess Adriana.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Oh, no, did you -- did you need me here earlier?",
        "Natalie: No, you're right on time.",
        "Gigi: Oh, I could've done that for you.",
        "Natalie: No, it's okay, Jared needed it right away. So, did you see Rex last night?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: I saw that comic book that he got for Shane.",
        "Gigi: That was sweet of him. I wish he hadn't -- I mean, he shouldn't have done that.",
        "Natalie: Why not?",
        "Gigi: Well, he doesn't owe Shane anything.",
        "Natalie: Rex likes him, he connects with Shane.",
        "Gigi: How can you tell?",
        "Natalie: Oh, well, I mean, it's kind of obvious. Rex grew up without a father, also, so he gets Shane.",
        "Gigi: So -- uh -- what -- what do you need me to do today? What can I do for you?",
        "Natalie: Um -- actually, I have been sitting here transcribing a recorded meeting that Jared and I had last night, so maybe you -- I don't know, I've got some other things to do.",
        "Gigi: You want me to take over?",
        "Natalie: Love it. Love it, love it. It's pretty simple. You should get this -- you play, stop --",
        "Gigi: I got -- yes, exactly.",
        "Natalie: Great, I really appreciate it, thank you.",
        "Gigi: No problem.",
        "Nigel's voice: I do recall several heated phone calls between Mr. Buchanan and Harris York, about six months before his passing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Whew.",
        "Natalie: What, did you jog here?",
        "Jared: Yeah -- uh -- I have a change of clothes in the office. Did you print out those files for me?",
        "Natalie: Yes. It's in my office.",
        "Jared: Oh, cool, thank you. I just didn't want Bo and Clint to think I was slacking off, especially after yesterday -- being late with that report.",
        "Natalie: No worries, it's -- it's all taken care of. Again, it's in my office. I -- I've got a meeting to catch with my dad, so --",
        "Jared: Okay, thank you. Whew.",
        "Jared's voice: I got what I thought I wanted.",
        "Nigel's voice: Something change?",
        "Jared: Gigi.",
        "Nigel's voice: Something unexpected just happened? What does that mean, exactly?",
        "Jared: Can you shut that off for me?",
        "[Tape stops]",
        "Jared: Thank you.",
        "Gigi: What can I do for you, Mr. Buchanan?",
        "Jared: Jared.",
        "Gigi: I got to get used to that first-name thing around here.",
        "Jared: Right. Um -- why -- why are you typing that up? That's a private conversation.",
        "Gigi: Natalie asked me to transcribe all of it.",
        "Jared: Oh, okay. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't -- I didn't mean to come down on you.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no, don't worry about it.",
        "Jared: Um -- oh, you know what? Uh -- you know, Rex needs to get this, like, ASAP. Um, would you mind running it down to him? I know he needs to get working on it right away, you know, sooner-the-better type thing, so --",
        "Gigi: Sure.",
        "Jared: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Okay, guys, there have been a lot of changes around here lately and there's been a lot of tension, but let's not take it out on each other, please.",
        "John: I don't get it. You just suddenly decide to start kissing up to this guy Ramsey --",
        "Antonio: What would you like me to do, John? Push back, get fired? That's what he wants, don't you get it? He baits people. That's what he does, all right? So you want to give him reason to hand you walking papers, you go right ahead. Just don't pull me down with you.",
        "John: You got it. I'll do what I have to do to keep my sanity. You just keep sucking up.",
        "Antonio: There's such a thing as a middle ground.",
        "John: Not with this guy! He will sucker-punch you and ---",
        "Antonio: If you need to be the big shot, you go right ahead, all right, but -- maybe you can afford it, but I can't, not anymore. I need this job. I got a daughter to support, and no safety net. Want to go after Ramsey? You go right ahead, but you're on your own.",
        "John: Get back to work!",
        "Talia: Antonio, I just --",
        "Antonio: I'm fine. I -- I just need a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, you call yourself an attorney? You know, you're an idiot, I'll do it myself. The lawyer's an idiot.",
        "Blair: Really? Because he can't get your penthouse back because you already sold it to somebody and they've signed a million legal papers -- is that what it is?",
        "Todd: Hey, Sam. Did you hear dad lose it on the phone like that? You're used to that, all right?",
        "Blair: I'm going to take care of a few things. Why don't you watch your son instead of trying to get the penthouse back?",
        "Todd: See? You're all right, I can do that to you. It's no big deal, you're all right. Let me tell you something. One of these days, I'm going to tell you the story of us -- how I fought for you, how I refused to give up on you. You'll really love me then, boy.",
        "[Todd sighs]",
        "Todd: You and your brother and sister just mean everything to me. If I lost you again, I think it would kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Fell asleep after all, huh? Feeling better?",
        "Shane: A little.",
        "Marcie: Yeah? Come here; let me feel your head. Mm-hmm, fever's down.",
        "Shane: I don't get it -- Rex and Tommy?",
        "Marcie: Well -- uh -- Tommy was Rex's godson. I'm sure your mom told you that Tommy is with his dad now. He's Sam -- I -- well, his name is -- is Sam now.",
        "Shane: My dad was a hero in the Navy Seals. My mom told you that, right?",
        "Marcie: No, you did. Don't you remember -- the first day we met in Paris.",
        "Shane: He saved lives and everything, but I don't even know what he looks like.",
        "Marcie: That's too bad.",
        "Shane: You know what I don't get? Why does my mom have so many pictures of Rex but none of my dad?",

        "Antonio: About before, I'm sorry.",
        "Talia: You were frustrated. You know, I understand. You're not in a position to stand up to Ramsey.",
        "Antonio: Now you agree with John? You think I'm a suck-up, too?",
        "Talia: I didn't say that. That's -- I didn't say that. John has had a really long, awful history with Ramsey. His girlfriend died and he thinks that Ramsey's responsible. You can't blame him --",
        "Antonio: Look, Talia, I get it, all right, I get it. Everything out of John McBain's mouth is justified. I'm sorry. I'm just on overload.",
        "Talia: Don't worry about it.",
        "Antonio: I got a daughter to support, you know? And John -- he can fight any battle he wants against Ramsey, I -- I can't.",
        "Talia: Do you want to talk about this later? I mean, could we meet up for a drink?",

        "Gigi: Jared wanted me to get them to you right away, so ASAP, I guess.",
        "Rex: He didn't say anything else about it?",
        "Gigi: Nope, but Natalie did.",
        "Rex: What, what did she say?",
        "Gigi: I'm not going to stand out here and explain while you're dripping wet in a towel -- which, by the way, is about to fall off.",
        "Rex: Ahem. Uh -- make yourself at home. I'll be right back.",
        "Gigi: It's hard to keep secrets, especially when you're a kid. Hard to keep them -- harder to live with them.",
        "Rex: Okay. What'd you have to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why are you at my desk, and where's Gigi?",

        "Jared: Yeah, no, I will in a minute um -- do you want me to type these notes up for you?",
        "Natalie: No, I got it covered. I really -- actually, I have to go over the recording and make sure Gigi didn't miss anything.",
        "Jared: Oh, she -- she didn't, it's all -- it's all there. If it was in the recording, it's in the notes.",
        "Natalie: Jared?",
        "Jared: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: I'm type-A -- got to do this stuff for myself, okay?",

        "Cole: No -- no, no one even knew I was there.",
        "John: Ah. What am I going to do with you, huh? Huh. Don't you know manning can cause a lot of trouble for you? For now, you need to stay away from Starr.",
        "Cole: That's not going to be a problem. Starr wrote it, Langston gave it to me last night. Starr doesn't want anything to do with me anymore.",

        "Starr: Where are \"we\" off to? Come on, can't you just, like, not go with me, just this one place? Just this one? No? Oh, great, let's hit the road.",

        "Ramsey: No, I have other things in mind for Officer Sahid, but I can see you're upset. You want your girlfriend close by, don't you?",
        "Antonio: No, she's just -- I was just saying that, you know, she's, uh, well suited for this.",

        "Marcie: Okay. What is it? You know, can I be a little honest with you right now? I -- I am a -- a little surprised that you're here.",
        "Starr: I understand that. I mean, I -- before everything happened with my dad and Sam, I was really close with you and Dr. McBain. You were my favorite teacher, and I used to baby-sit for Tommy all the time, if you remember.",

        "Gigi: Besides, those recordings of Asa's meetings will help, too.",
        "Rex: Definitely. Sometimes I just need a few words, a sentence. I'm really good with subtext -- it's not what people say, it's what they don't say? Bo's always telling me I have a sixth sense about it.",
        "Gigi: So, Rex -- um -- I've been meaning to -- I need to tell you something. If I don't, you'll probably find out anyway. It's -- it's just that you and Shane have gotten so close lately, and -- um -- he's really crazy about you. Kind of like how you feel about Charlie -- this instant connection? And obviously that's because Charlie's your dad, and it's a weird coincidence, because then you and I ran into each other in Texas, and now we're living in the same town, and it's just -- it is -- um -- it's making me wonder -- it's making me wonder if this isn't one of those -- um -- meant-to-be things. What I mean is Shane's dad is not who -- it's not who Shane thinks he is.",
        "Gigi: I -- um -- I lied to you, Rex. I -- lied to both you and Shane, and I -- I can't -- I can't do it anymore. So I have to tell you -- I have to tell you that Shane is your son, you are Shane's father. Oh, God, I'm sorry.",
