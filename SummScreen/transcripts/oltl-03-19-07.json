        "Starr: Hi.",
        "Cole: Hey. Sleep ok?",
        "Starr: Yeah, you?",

        "Starr: No. I don't. I mean, I -- I do, but --",
        "Cole: Yeah. I know what you mean.",
        "Starr: It was just so incredible, to be able to sleep in the same bed with you. I never did that with another boy before.",
        "Starr: Hmm, you're nice and warm.",
        "Cole: You're nice and -- hot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Miles: Yeah. I've never had so much fun in my life -- or been with better company.",
        "Marty: Oh. But you didn't even get a chance to, you know, ski or ice-skate or snowboard.",
        "Miles: Yeah. I did have one new experience. I broke up a fight -- or tried to.",
        "Marty: Well, you saved Cristian and Todd from killing each other.",
        "Miles: Yeah, or they were going to kill me.",
        "Marty: Well, you know, getting stranded in an ice storm -- not everybody has that pleasure.",
        "Miles: Well, it has been for me. Hey, what do you say we hit the slopes finally? Let's take one of those sleigh rides they've been advertising.",
        "Marty: You know, I would. I would love to. It's just, you know, some of us have to work --",
        "Miles: Yeah. Well, I've never had a job, and now I don't need one. Advantage of the rich, I guess.",
        "Marty: Well, consider yourself fortunate.",
        "Miles: Well, you don't like what you do?",
        "Marty: Oh, no, no, no, it's -- it's not that. It's just -- you know, I just wish I had more time to spend with my son. And if I don't get ready, I won't be seeing him soon, so I am going to go get that shower.",
        "Miles: Ok.",
        "Marty: Or not.",
        "Miles: Why not?",
        "Marty: Hmm, because Blair is still up there, and -- you know, nobody needs that grief this early in the morning. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm not sorry we slept together last night.",
        "Blair: Good. Cause it was great.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, great it was.",
        "Blair: Yeah. You know why? Because neither one of us really give a damn about the other person.",
        "Cristian: Well, I don't -- I -- I don't know if I'd put it that way.",
        "Blair: No, what -- what I mean is that we don't \"love\" each other.",
        "Cristian: No, we don't \"love\" each other, no.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and we probably never will.",
        "Cristian: Probably not.",
        "Blair: So, it's a good thing, you know?",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Blair: Yeah. We got back at Todd and Evangeline for making love.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. I can't believe she did that.",
        "Blair: Well, that's because you still love her.",
        "Cristian: What, you don't still love Todd?",
        "Blair: I dumped him.",
        "Cristian: And I dumped Evangeline. Doesn't mean I don't love her.",

        "Cristian: Oh, really?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",

        "Evangeline: I'm glad I didn't have to sleep alone last night.",
        "Todd: Oh, come on. It hasn't been that long since you and Cristian split up.",
        "Evangeline: It feels like it. I guess it's because I miss him.",
        "Todd: I hope he had to sleep in his car last night.",
        "Evangeline: Stop it. You don't mean that. Yes, you do. You do mean that. Well, I have to admit, the way he's been treating me, I kind of hope he had a rough night.",
        "Todd: There's my girl.",
        "Evangeline: \"Your girl\"?",
        "Todd: Well, my -- \"my platonic friend\" doesn't quite have a ring to it, I don't think.",
        "Evangeline: I think it sounds good.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Evangeline: There is one thing.",
        "Todd: What's that?",
        "Evangeline: I still love Cristian, and -- stop it. Listen, if by some miracle, we end up finding our way back together, I don't want you bitching and moaning about it.",
        "Todd: That's not going to happen.",
        "Evangeline: Good.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. I mean, you guys aren't getting back together.",
        "Evangeline: You don't know that.",
        "Todd: Oh, really? Ok. His last name's Vega, isn't it?",
        "Evangeline: Yes.",
        "Todd: Well, that means he's macho to a fault. So how do you think he's going to react when he finds out you and I slept together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Sorry, but my dream's kind of personal.",
        "Tate: Hmm. I hear you. Mine, too.",
        "Rex: Me -- I had a nightmare. I was in angel square and a -- a bus drove by with a picture of me on it -- in my boxers.",
        "Adriana: You just want me to tell you how hot you looked.",
        "Rex: Did I?",
        "Adriana: Smokin'.",
        "Tate: So, hey, why don't we go get some food and see what's happening with the storm?",
        "Rex: Yeah, you -- go ahead. We'll stay here and straighten up, maybe get a new fire started.",
        "Tate: Ok. Then I'll bring you something back.",
        "Rex: Oh, does that guy not have a clue, or what?",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Rex: Come on, let's get this fire started before he comes back.",
        "Adriana: Rex, what if someone walks in on us?",
        "Rex: Oh, like Mr. Baseball? Who cares? It's our anniversary.",
        "Adriana: I know. Hmm.",
        "Rex: Look, if the -- if the door opens, we'll pretend we're asleep and start to snore.",
        "Adriana: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Whew.",
        "Starr: Well, I could get used to this.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Not having to worry about getting caught.",
        "Cole: You really think Britney's not going to say anything?",
        "Starr: I doubt that. She wanted you. I got you. I have a hard time thinking that she would just let something like that go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Not only are both Starr's parents and Cole's mom here, but Cole and Starr spent the night together in a room. No, Amber, how would I know besides, it doesn't matter if they actually did it or not. Their parents are going to freak when they find out. And I'm going to make sure they do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You and exposed are a match made in heaven. With our shorts, your body, we can't miss.",
        "Tate: Um -- how long have you Adriana for?",
        "Layla: Hmm -- not that long, really. She needed an apartment and so did I, and we became roommates.",
        "Tate: Well, you might need a new one soon. Well, it's just that the guy is head over heels.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You know what? I'm going to call my son and let him know I will be home this afternoon.",

        "Cole: Ok, mom. See you then.",
        "Starr: That's my phone. It's my mom. Hey, mom.",
        "Blair: Hey, baby, I just wanted to make sure you got my message about the snowstorm up here",
        "Starr: Yeah, I -- I know.",
        "Blair: We got stuck here, but it hasn't been bad. I've kept myself busy but I know that you' re okay at Dorian's. Is everything ok?",
        "Starr: Yeah. Um --",
        "Blair: How's Jack?",
        "Starr: He's fine.",
        "Blair: Ok, can you put Aunt Dorian on for me?",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian's not here right now.",

        "Blair: Well, you and jack stay in and I'll be home soon, all right?",

        "Starr: Dad?",
        "Todd: Expecting somebody else?",
        "Starr: No -- um -- I just -- no, I'm sorry, I was on the other line with mom. She was telling me what's going on.",

        "Starr: That you were stuck up on Llantano Mountain, and that you weren't going to be home till later.",
        "Todd: You keeping out of trouble?",
        "Starr: Yes. Uh -- well, I -- I got to go. I'll talk to you later, ok? Bye. Hey, sorry about that. That was dad.",
        "Blair: Listen, sweetie, you watch after your little brother, all right? Actually, maybe you should go outside and help him build a snowman, and I'll be home soon.",
        "Starr: Talk to you later, bye. Whew. Cole, we need to get back to Llanview before our parents do.",
        "Cole: Yeah, we -- we can try, but the guy at the desk said that the bus is not going out for another two hours.",
        "Cole: Listen, it'll be ok. We'll just lay low up here until it's time, and then we'll have Langston run interference for us so that our parents don't see us.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and hope that Britney doesn't rat us out.",
        "Cole: Listen, Britney had a chance to bust us and she didn't.",
        "Starr: It doesn't mean that she won't, Cole. We have to watch our backs and our fronts. My mom told me not to go out. What if she gets home before us?",
        "Cole: We'll make some excuse. It'll be ok. Because they're parents.",
        "Starr: You know, my pare are completely paranoid.",
        "Cole: Let's not spend the last two hours talking about our parents.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and last night was even better, even though we didn't do anything.",

        "Miles: Hey, I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: Oh, no, miles I'm not mad at you. It's just -- you know, Blair and I have history.",
        "Miles: Hmm. I should have thought of that. I --",
        "Marty: Well, you know what? I think you are really sweet.",
        "Miles: Thank you.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm. Well, this girl is going to go freshen up a little. Hmm.",
        "Miles: I'll take care of these.",
        "Marty: Thanks.",
        "Rex: I told you nobody was going to walk in on us.",
        "Adriana: I love you.",
        "Rex: I love you, too. You know, I'd say we should get a room, but they don't have any.",
        "Adriana: Hmm. Yeah. I'm going to go find a shower. Oh -- um -- which rooms are which?",
        "Rex: Uh -- I think the girls are in 423, the guys are in 432. I'm going to grab the gear from the shoot, grab a shower myself, and then I will meet you back down here.",
        "Adriana: See you then.",
        "Rex: Oh.",
        "Miles: Thanks. Hey -- excuse me. I didn't -- I don't think I've met you be-- before.",

        "Miles: Hmm.",
        "Rex: Um -- don't worry, I'm not going to lay it into you. I know what it's like to try to outrun a bad reputation.",

        "Rex: Nice to meet you, Miles.",
        "Miles: Hey, I don't mean to be presumptuous, but your girlfriend's really beautiful.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and don't even think about hitting on her.",
        "Miles: No, I -- I wouldn't. I wouldn't. That's -- that's not what I'm saying. I -- I think you two seem like you're really in love.",
        "Rex: That's right.",
        "Miles: How do you do that? How do you make somebody fall in love with you?",
        "Rex: Got somebody in mind?",
        "Miles: Well, no, I was just wondering. Um -- I'm not that experienced.",
        "Rex: Well, you ever hear the expression \"chemistry\"?",
        "Miles: Yeah, sure.",
        "Rex: Well, that's what it is. If there's no chemistry between the two of you, it's never going to happen. You can't just get a girl to fall in love with you. They just do.",
        "Miles: Oh, so it's out of my control?",
        "Rex: Well, not entirely. You can let her see the best side of you -- assuming there is one. You can go the traditional route -- flowers, candy, midnight serenades.",
        "Miles: Oh, but I don't -- I don't sing.",
        "Rex: It doesn't matter. It's the thought that counts.",
        "Miles: Not with me. ---",
        "Miles: Lighten up -- ok.",
        "Rex: Step into my office.",
        "Miles: Yeah. All right.",

        "Cristian: But you know, maybe if you and Todd were still together...",
        "Blair: What do I have to do to prove that I am not in love with Todd anymore? Do I have to-- to sleep with everybody in this town to prove it? I am sorry, I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Cristian: It actually is an honor to be the first guy you sleep with to get over Todd.",
        "Blair: Oh --",
        "Cristian: It's a real good honor.",
        "Blair: Oh, thank you. I really --",

        "Miles: All right. Ahem. You look beautiful.",
        "Marty: Oh -- thanks. It must be that hotel shampoo.",
        "Miles: Hmm.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "Miles: You want a cup of coffee?",
        "Marty: Actually, not only is that necessary, it's imperative.",
        "Miles: All right, I'll be back.",
        "Marty: Ok.",
        "Britney: Yeah, you'll never guess what happened. No, I just found out that Cole Thornhart and Starr Manning are here and they spent the night together.",
        "Marty: Wait -- what did you just say?",
        "Britney: Oh, my gosh. Dr. Saybrooke, I didn't -- I'll call you right back. I didn't know you were here.",
        "Miles: What's going on?",
        "Marty: Um -- my son lied to me and he is here with someone he's not even supposed to be seeing. Where is he?",

        "Cristian: So you're not going to get on me about it?",
        "Layla: Listen, we're friends, right? It's not like I want Vange with Todd, either, but you know how she feels about Blair. Cristian, you have to tell Vange what you did.",
        "Cristian: Look, I -- ok, yeah. Thanks. You're my buddy.",
        "Evangeline: I knew it. Damn it, Layla. How could you do this to me?",
        "Adriana: Hey, girls --",
        "Cristian: Look, Evangeline, you don't understand.",
        "Evangeline: I understand perfectly. You slept with my boyfriend. You slept with my sister, knowing ho hurt me?",
        "Cristian: It's not --",
        "Evangeline: Don't even try! Don't even try!",
        "Cristian: It's not what it looks like --",
        "Evangeline: No! I get that you're upset about what happened, what you think is going on between Todd and me, but to do something like this to me, and, Layla -- I thought you had changed.",
