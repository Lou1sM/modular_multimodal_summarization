    "Recap": [
        "At Buenos Dias, Viki and Charlie are hosting a bone marrow donor drive for Shane. Behind the scenes, Roxy is secretly providing the DNA of Rex's biological father to the lab for testing without telling anybody. Stacy is spying upon her and goes to \"Strike a deal\" with the lab technician where he tells Roxy that her \"mysterious friend\" is a match and in order for her to save her grandson's life, she must provide the name of the donor. Stacy wants to blackmail her. In Shane's hospital room, both he and Rex get their hair shaved so they look like father and son. Natalie and Jared seem to know that Tess or Bess went into the hospital to switch Jessica's dead baby for Starr's healthy baby. But they know they better not breathe a word of it to anybody until it's proven and that there's no easy way to drop the bombshell upon the parties involved after proving it."

        "Markko: I didn't think you'd be back so soon. How's Starr doing? Oh, Langston -- oh, you're driving me crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How's your mom?",
        "Starr: Nothing's changed. Aunt Dorian is in there with her now.",
        "Langston: Maybe you should take a break.",
        "Starr: I don't want a break. What I want to do is talk to her, but I -- I can't. I don't even know if she can hear me. I just keeping begging her not to die. Langston, she -- she's got to wake up.",
        "Langston: I know. If something doesn't go right for you pretty soon, I'm just going to lose it.",
        "Starr: I just need her really bad right now because I know she would be able to help me figure out how Hope died.",
        "Langston: I thought you already knew.",
        "Starr: I didn't tell you?",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Starr: Oh, my God. I've been so tired I don't even remember who I told and who I haven't.",
        "Langston: What are you talking about?",
        "Starr: Marcie found out that Cole's Rh factor is the same as mine, so Hope couldn't have died from Rh disease.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Where are the samples?",
        "Jared: Right here.",
        "Natalie: Both of them?",
        "Jared: Yes. But Chloe's fingernails are so little, I hope they work.",
        "Natalie: I think they will. I'm sure they will. And you were a genius to get Jessica's hair out of her brush.",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Natalie: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Jared: That we don't even need this test? Because we already know that Chloe isn't Jessica's baby? Yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey, sweet girl. You want to go get something to eat with your mama?",

        "Shane: Hey, they have the space channel here -- cool.",
        "Rex: What, what, Shane?",
        "Gigi: Are you okay, sweetie?",
        "Shane: Yeah. Why did you guys stay here all night?",
        "Gigi: Because we love you.",
        "Shane: I'm not a baby.",
        "Rex: You had your first chemo yesterday and we were afraid you'd feel sick.",
        "Shane: I'm fine.",
        "Roxy: Yo, big guy!",
        "Gigi: Whoa!",
        "Roxy: You need a bigger appetite because look what I got for you. I got eggs and waffles, and everybody's favorite, creamed chipped beef. Look at this. What do you think?",
        "Shane: You know -- you know how I said I was fine?",
        "Gigi: Oh.",
        "Rex: Way to go, Rox.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Here you go. So, more coffee?",
        "Oliver: Yes, Ms. Davidson, you're working here now?",
        "Viki: Helping out for a good cause, right along with Charlie Banks.",
        "Charlie: Thank you all for showing up for Shane. Here is the drill, you follow these instructions, don't be gentle. You really want to rub the inside of your cheeks with the swabs. You get two swabs for upper, two for lower. That's it, any questions?",
        "Viki: Thank you so much for getting tested. You know, I've been through this with one of my own children, and I can tell you, it means the world.",
        "Oliver: I'm just hoping I'm the one that can help the kid out.",
        "Viki: You're a good man, Oliver Fish. Don't forget to help yourself to the buffet before the food's all gone.",
        "Charlie: Okay, who's next?",
        "Stacy: I'm Stacy Morasco. I'm Gigi's sister, Shane's aunt.",
        "Viki: Well, hello. I'm Victoria Davidson. I'm a friend of Gigi's. She's told me a great deal about you.",
        "Stacy: I'll bet she has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How you feeling?",
        "Gigi: Are you okay, baby?",
        "Shane: Don't worry, I won't hurl again. I can still smell that food.",
        "Roxy: Sorry, kiddo. Next time it will be T\u00e9a and toast.",
        "Rex: You want to go for a walk?",
        "Gigi: The doctor said you will get weak if you stay in the bed too much.",
        "Shane: Okay. Do you want to come with me, Grandma?",
        "Roxy: You got it. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Yeah, Gigi's not exactly my biggest fan right now.",
        "Viki: Well, relationships between sisters can be difficult, but it's good that you're here now.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, a family member has a much better chance of being a donor. So, how is Gigi holding up?",
        "Stacy: Good, I guess.",
        "Viki: You guess?",
        "Stacy: Well, she and I got into an argument just before she found out about Shane, so I've just been giving her space. She has enough on her plate right now.",
        "Viki: She certainly does.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm sure she'll be happy to know that you're getting tested.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, and with any luck, I'll be a match. I was supposed to do it yesterday at the hospital but something came up, so \u0096",
        "Roxy: That wasn't so hard, was it? Well, maybe it was for you. You're not very big on doing the right thing, so maybe the first time would sting a lot. But our grandson needs help, and you're going to help him whether you want to or not.",
        "Stacy: Better late than never, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Brody, hi. I'm so sorry to hear about Shane. How did you find out?",
        "Brody: I went over to Gigi's to let her know I'm out of St. Ann's. He's just a kid.",
        "Jessica: I wish you would have called me. I understand why you didn't.",
        "Brody: I wanted to call you, but I stopped myself. So, you're here getting tested?",
        "Jessica: Uh, I -- I don't think I can be a donor.",
        "Brody: Why not?",
        "Jessica: Well, one of the things that Tess did to me was give me hepatitis C.",
        "Brody: Oh, man.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I know. I'm in remission, thank God. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life making up for all the bad things that Tess did to other people, including me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: We are really going through with this, aren't we?",
        "Natalie: Jared, we have to.",
        "Jared: Yeah, I just wish we weren't the ones that had to figure this out.",
        "Natalie: But we did. We did and we know that Jessica's baby died. We know that.",
        "Jared: It is horrible to think what she put herself through, driving to the hospital with her dead baby beside her?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, Jessica didn't go through that. Bess made sure of it, and then she swapped that poor baby for Starr's healthy one.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Jared: Hey",
        "Natalie: Hi, Marcie, Michael.",
        "Marcie: Are you guys visiting Matthew or Shane?",
        "Jared: Uh -- both, yeah.",
        "Natalie: And we're getting tested -- for Shane. You know, we went to the cafe, the donor drive, but they were packed so we came here --",
        "Marcie: Oh, really? We're actually on our way over there now, but Michael and I were just trying to get to the bottom of what I told you about yesterday.",
        "Jared: Starr's baby?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: They checked Cole's blood three times and it's confirmed -- Hope could not have died from Rh disease.",
        "Michael: I was just saying to Marcie, maybe -- maybe Cole's not the father.",
        "Marcie: Of course he's the father, Michael. You know Starr better than that.",
        "Michael: Okay, there's no other scientific explanation, all right? Nothing else makes any sense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: If Hope didn't die from Rh, then what happened?",
        "Starr: Michael and Marcie are trying to find out.",
        "Langston: I'm so sorry, Starr. I don't even know what to say.",
        "Starr: Nobody does. Look, didn't Aunt Viki say that you can swab me?",
        "Langston: She was blown away that you'd even want to do it.",
        "Starr: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Langston: Starr, your mom's in critical condition. Most people wouldn't even think about being a bone marrow donor at a time like that.",
        "Starr: It saved my life when I was little, Langston. You have to pay it forward, no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Oh, Langston.",
        "Lola: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay, who's up next?",
        "Cristian: I'm next.",
        "Layla: Hello? I was here first.",
        "Cristian: Seriously. I mean, you want to get into a fight about who gets to get their cheeks swabbed next?",
        "Layla: Yeah, you cut in front of me.",
        "Cristian: I didn't see you, Layla.",
        "Layla: Oh, because you were too busy scoping the room looking for a stand-in for Vanessa? Oh, and then you can blame my comatose sister for sleeping with her, too.",
        "Cristian: You didn't hear a word I said last night, did you?",
        "Layla: Maybe I would, if you said something worth remembering.",
        "Cristian: You know, look. I know you think every man in the world has let you down, but did you ever think that maybe, maybe they left you because you're a bitch?",
        "Oliver: Stacy? I'm really sorry about your nephew.",
        "Layla: So, this is the chick you dumped me for?",
        "Oliver: Well, I wouldn't put it that way.",
        "Layla: Your new friend introduced herself to me a few days ago. So when you reached out to me, what was that? Were you trying to size up your competition?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Child: Kick it back. What are you in for?",
        "Shane: Huh?",
        "Child: Your diagnosis.",
        "Shane: Oh, leukemia. You?",
        "Child: Lymphoma. You got a name?",
        "Shane: Shane. What's yours?",
        "Child: Frankie, short for \"Francesca.\" You thought I was a boy, right? It's the hair. You'll lose yours soon. I got to go.",
        "Shane: Okay. See you later.",
        "Child: Sure.",
        "Shane: Am I going to look like her?",
        "Roxy: Hey, listen up.",
        "Gigi: Honey, are you sure about this?",
        "Shane: Positive. I don't want to wait for it to happen. I just want it to be done. It's okay, Dad. You've got to embrace the bull, right, Gram?",
        "Roxy: Right. And you know, I'll bet once you get that bone marrow, your hair is going to grow back better than ever.",
        "Shane: If I get the new bone marrow.",
        "Gigi: Don't talk like that. We will find a match. Viki and Charlie are rounding up hundreds of people to get tested.",
        "Rex: And there's a worldwide registry. Michael said that there was a guy in the US who was a match with a guy in Germany.",
        "Shane: Yeah, but isn't it better if they're related to me?",
        "Gigi: Well, sure -- I mean, that's why we all got tested.",
        "Shane: I wish I had a bigger family.",
        "Gigi: Don't you worry. We are going to dig up every Morasco and Balsom we can find.",
        "Rex: What a search that's going to be.",
        "Roxy: You know what's worse -- dealing with deadbeat relatives, if one of them's a match.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Look, I didn't know that you and, um --",
        "Oliver: Oliver.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, sorry -- that you guys were hooking up. So, the only reason why I came up to you was because I knew you were friends with Rex's ex and I had heard he was a player so I just -- I wanted to look out for my sister, you know? Okay, I better get back to the hospital, all right?",
        "Viki: Stacy? If you see Gigi, please tell her that she and Shane are in our prayers.",
        "Stacy: I will. She's a lucky girl. She's got great friends like you and Shane and -- Rex.",
        "Charlie: It's lucky Gigi's sister showed up when she did.",
        "Viki: Yeah, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex, Gigi, and Roxy: Five, four, three, two, one --",
        "Roxy: Blastoff!",
        "[Clippers whirring]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: [Choking] Ow! Do you know what you are doing?",
        "Langston: Dude, I'm totally qualified. I got my training from a nurse, okay? See, there's that smile.",
        "Starr: I don't know how you do it. No matter what's going on, you always make me laugh.",
        "Langston: So have you seen Cole?",
        "Starr: I don't even know where he is. Probably better off I don't. If I were to see him, I'd probably end up blurting out everything about Hope.",
        "Langston: Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing.",
        "Starr: Talking about how Hope died? How could that be good for either of us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: There is only one other possible explanation, that the pathologist was wrong.",
        "Natalie: How do you find out?",
        "Michael: By exhuming the body. And I don't want to put Marcie, or Starr, or Cole, or anybody through that, so --",
        "Marcie: Look, Michael, it's not like any of this is going to bring Hope back, so can we please just let her rest in peace, please?",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Marcie: Please? We better get over to the cafe. I -- when Gigi called and told me, I promised her that we would help, so --",
        "Natalie: Oh, no, go, go. I'm sorry, we didn't mean to keep you.",
        "Marcie: No, you didn't -- you didn't keep us, really. Thank you again for listening.",
        "Natalie: Of course.",
        "Marcie: Okay, see you soon. Bye.",
        "Michael: See you.",
        "Natalie: Oh, God, that poor woman.",
        "Jared: I can't believe we were standing here holding the answer to what they're so desperately looking for.",
        "Natalie: And knowing that it will bring hope back.",
        "Jared: Proving Chloe isn't Jessica's baby is one thing, we still got to prove that she's Starr's, and we've got to get DNA from Starr without getting her hopes up.",
        "Natalie: We can do it.",
        "Jared: I hope so because we got to do the right thing for Chloe, and Marcie -- and Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Here.",
        "Starr: What's this?",
        "Langston: Stuff -- just some clothes, toothbrush, shampoo, lavender soap --",
        "Starr: Hospital soap gets you clean, but it sucks in every way else.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Thank you so much. You're the best.",
        "Langston: Do you need me to stay?",
        "Starr: No, I'm all right. John and Aunt Dorian are here. I just want to take a quick shower and get back to my mom.",
        "Langston: Okay. Call me or text me if you need anything, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay, I will. Langston: Bye.",
        "Starr: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Clippers whirring]",
        "Roxy: You are so rocking that look.",
        "Rex: Just like Bruce Willis.",
        "Gigi: Or Vin Diesel.",
        "Roxy: Or Kojak.",
        "Shane: Who?",
        "Roxy: Oh, the ladies loved him back in the day.",
        "Shane: Okay, you guys are making me nervous. Wow.",
        "Roxy: What do you think, kiddo?",
        "Shane: I don't look like Dad anymore.",
        "Rex: [Sighs]",
        "Roxy: Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Rex: There is nothing I wouldn't do for my son.",
        "[Clippers whirring]",
        "Rex: This is something I need to do myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How long before we get the results back?",
        "Kyle: I'll shoot for a quick turnaround, but Shane Morasco's donor drive might hold things up a little bit. I'll do my best.",
        "Jared: We appreciate it.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's that. No turning back now.",
        "Jared: Whatever the results are, we're going to have to live with it, and so will Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: What a turnout.",
        "Viki: It's wonderful. People are coming out in droves.",
        "Marcie: Well, I just hope there's a match for Shane somewhere in there.",
        "Cristian: Hey, guys.",
        "Viki: Hey, Cristian.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Viki: Thanks so much for getting tested. And please thank Carlotta for this incredible buffet.",
        "Cristian: I will, I will. She's at church right now making a novena for Shane.",
        "Viki: That's nice.",
        "Cristian: I'll see you guys.",
        "Marcie: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Can I ask you something?",
        "Oliver: Okay.",
        "Layla: Did you really break it off with me because of Stacy? Or was it because I acted like a bitch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: Please don't be mad.",
        "Markko: You can't just sneak up and kiss me.",
        "Lola: I know. I'm sorry, Markko. I don't know what I was thinking.",
        "Markko: Langston is your cousin.",
        "Lola: I shouldn't be having a mad crush on her boyfriend, but I can't help it. Promise me you won't say anything to Langston.",
        "Markko: I promised that after the last time you kissed me.",
        "Lola: And I did something for you, too. I didn't tell Langston how much you liked it, or how much you like what I just did, too.",
        "Langston: Am I interrupting something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So, this is Chloe.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm, we just dropped her big sister off at preschool. Chloe, this is Brody, Mommy's friend. [Whispering to Chloe] Do you want that?",
        "Brody: Nice to meet you, Chloe. Oh -- you're just as gorgeous as your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Starr, hi.",
        "Starr: Hey.",
        "Natalie: How's your mom doing?",
        "Starr: The same.",
        "Jared: I'm sorry.",
        "Natalie: Is there anything we can do?",
        "Starr: I don't think there's anything to do, but thanks.",
        "Natalie: Just let us know, okay?",
        "Starr: I will. Right now I'm just going to go take a quick shower, but thanks for stopping by.",
        "Natalie: Would you like me to hold your locket for you while you take a shower?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hello, my darling Chloe! Hiya, honey.",
        "Jessica: Mom, you know Brody Lovett, right?",
        "Viki: It's very nice to see you again, Brody.",
        "Brody: Thank you so much for everything you're doing for Gigi and Shane.",
        "Viki: Oh, please, I wish there were more I could do. And I want to thank you for being such a good friend to Jessie when you were both at St. Ann's.",
        "Brody: Oh, she kept me going. If it wasn't for her, I might still be in there. Well, I should get my test done. It looks like they're finishing up.",
        "Viki: Okay. You seem to be very fond of him.",
        "Jessica: Uh, yeah, Brody is the nicest guy I've met since -- since Nash.",
        "Viki: But?",
        "Jessica: But, we're two barely recovered crazies.",
        "Viki: Jessica.",
        "Jessica: We are. We are, Mom. So we've decided to remain friends, and that's it.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Marcie: How's the little one doing?",
        "Jessica: She's great. Michael, I was wondering -- can I be tested to be a donor?",
        "Michael: I'm sorry, no. It's just -- that's not possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Busy day, huh?",
        "Kyle: Yeah. Got a stack of tests this high, all for Shane Morasco.",
        "Stacy: Hmm, that's great for him; it's a bummer for you. Look, you wouldn't mind getting to mine first, would you? Shane's my nephew, I could be the one. I tried to do it yesterday, but I guess I just got waylaid.",
        "Kyle: \"Waylaid\"? Is that so?",
        "Stacy: It is. So, do me first. Ring me with the results.",
        "Kyle: Exotic dancer -- didn't know you ladies had business cards.",
        "Stacy: Well, when you're as good as me --",
        "Kyle: Really?",
        "Stacy: You know, it's too bad you don't have a pole in here. I'm a genius.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Why do they always have to take my blood?",
        "Gigi: I guess it's to see if the chemo is working.",
        "Shane: You're leaving?",
        "Roxy: [Imitating Arnold Schwarzenegger]: I'll be back. You can count on it. Bye.",
        "Gigi: [Screaming] Balsom!",
        "Shane: Dad?",
        "Gigi: [Screams] Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, dude, do you want to make my day or my year? Tell me I'm a match for my grandson. The name is Roxanne Balsom. Come on, do you want to check it out?",
        "Kyle: I'm a little swamped right now. Okay, when'd you get tested?",
        "Roxy: Yesterday. Come on; tell me I'm a winner.",
        "Kyle: I'm sorry.",
        "Roxy: Well, what about my friend? The one named John Doe",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So I can't help Shane or anyone else.",
        "Marcie: I wouldn't beat myself up about it.",
        "Michael: No, she's right.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Jessica: A transplant saved my life. I just wanted to be able to give something back, you know?",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I'm quite sure that you will be able to help Shane in other ways, okay?",
        "Jessica: Right.",
        "Viki: Honey, one of the hardest things about dealing with D.I.D. is coping with the messes that you don't even remember making. And Tess left you with an awful lot to deal with. But you fought back, sweetheart, and you have become a wonderful mother to Bree and to Chloe.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Viki: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It has a lock of Hope's hair in it, so I always take it off before I go in the shower. I wouldn't want to get it wet. If I lost it, I don't know what I would do, so thank you so much.",
        "Natalie: It'll be safe. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Excuse me. Can I hold your pretty little girl?",
        "Jessica: Of course you can. She's got a case of the hiccups.",
        "Marcie: Oh, you do?",
        "Viki: Oh, my goodness, she's so beautiful, isn't she?",
        "Marcie: Yes, she is.",
        "Jessica: I know. Sometimes I feel like I don't really deserve her.",
        "Marcie: Of course you do.",
        "Viki: She's right. Listen -- you are you now, okay? Tess is gone, and she can't hurt you or anyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Let's do this. Starr's not going to be gone long. She's in a hurry to get back to Blair. I just wish she hadn't taken her bag or I would have pulled the old hairbrush trick again and gotten some DNA.",
        "Natalie: I just can't believe this locket fell into our hands.",
        "Natalie: Jared.",
        "Jared: Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Natalie: It's just we're so close, you know? What if we do get the proof? Is Tess going to come back because Jess can't handle the fact that Chloe's not her baby?",
        "Jared: If she asks you to go in the basement, say no.",
        "Natalie: You know, that's still not funny.",
        "Jared: I know.",
        "Natalie: If the truth comes out, we could lose Chloe -- and Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Okay, I have to run back.",
        "Marcie: Oh, well, see you later?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: Markko and I were just talking about that boy Shane. It's so sad that he's sick.",
        "Markko: I need to talk to Langston -- alone.",
        "Lola: I'll see you at home, right?",
        "Langston: Sure.",
        "Lola: This girl is so much fun to live with. She's like the sister I always wanted. I'd die if anyone did anything to make her unhappy.",
        "Langston: Okay, now I know something's wrong between you and Lola. What is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Did you try the pancakes? They're great.",
        "Brody: Uh, not yet. I owe you an apology, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: For what?",
        "Brody: The AA meeting last summer -- the stuff I said.",
        "Charlie: Well, that's one of the 12 steps -- admitting the exact nature of wrongs.",
        "Brody: I -- I was only at that meeting to get Gigi off my back about drinking when I had Shane in the car. And I shouldn't have spilled my guts like that. I said all that stuff about Shane not being my son, and trying to keep Rex from finding out. I put you in a tough position, and I'm sorry.",
        "Charlie: Hey, no need to apologize. You doing okay now?",
        "Brody: Getting there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: This feels great. Do you think we look good?",
        "Shane: I think we look like eggheads.",
        "Rex: Nah. If we do, I'm digging it.",
        "Shane: Thanks, dad.",
        "[Clippers whirring]",
        "Shane and Rex: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, you know, you're killing me. Is John Doe a match or what?",
        "Kyle: What's John Doe's real name?",
        "Roxy: Like I told you yesterday, he likes to do things on the QT.",
        "Kyle: That's a shame. Um, we're going to need to know who he is.",
        "Roxy: Why?",
        "Kyle: Because your friend, John Doe, is a match.",
        "Roxy: John Doe is a match? That sucker is a match?",
        "Kyle: Sure is -- every marker. Looks like Mr. Doe's bone marrow is going to save your grandson's life. Now, I just need to know what his actual name is.",
        "Roxy: Well, if the bone marrow fits, why don't they just take it?",
        "Kyle: Yeah. There's protocol to follow, um, like checking a patient's medical history.",
        "Roxy: Well, don't people get organs and other stuff from stiffs that they don't know?",
        "Kyle: Yeah, okay. Shane Morasco's parents, family -- they don't need to know who the donor is, but we do.",
        "Roxy: Wait a second -- no can do. No, no, my son needs to know. My son will do anything to find out who saved his son.",
        "Kyle: Okay, listen. Do -- do you want to save your grandson's life or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Layla, I really liked you, but you were so not into me -- at least that's what I got if I was reading the signals right.",
        "Layla: But we were starting something, weren't we?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but you seemed so on-the-fence. And then I met Stacy, and I have never had anyone come on to me like that. It felt -- it felt great, and so I went with it.",
        "Layla: Okay, so it had nothing to do with me acting like a bitch?",
        "Oliver: No -- no, not at all. I, uh, I have to get back to work.",
        "Layla: All right, see you later, Fish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I've never held a kid this small.",
        "Jessica: Not even Shane?",
        "Brody: I was in the service when he was born. I didn't get to meet him until last year.",
        "Jessica: You okay?",
        "Brody: It's killing me that Shane's sick. You know, and just seeing Gigi yesterday, I felt so bad for her. I think she was afraid I'd lose it when I found out.",
        "Jessica: I've been on the receiving end of that look.",
        "Brody: I know.",
        "Jessica: You know, when people all around you are afraid you're going to lose it, you start worrying that you're going to lose it, too.",
        "Brody: Exactly. But I kept it together. I'll do whatever I can for them. But Shane's not my son, and now I get why I needed to pretend that he was, you know, why I spent so much time holding onto a kid who was never mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Jessica is holding onto a baby that isn't hers.",
        "Natalie: We're not 100% sure about that.",
        "Jared: Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Jared, I know.",
        "Jared: Marcie and Starr have no idea Hope is alive. They deserve to know that, don't they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Mom, no way do I want you to be bald.",
        "Gigi: You sure? Because I'm totally fine with it.",
        "Shane: It would kind of freak me out.",
        "Rex: Me, too, but nice of you to offer.",
        "Gigi: Well, if you change your mind, it's hair today, gone tomorrow. How lucky am I? I have the two most handsome boys in the whole world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You don't understand. John Doe doesn't go under this name for nothing. He's a very, very private person.",
        "Kyle: Does he value his privacy more than saving someone's life?",
        "Roxy: No -- uh, yeah. I don't know. I got to think about this.",
        "Roxy: What are you staring at?",
        "Stacy: I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry that you weren't a match.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, it's too bad.",
        "Stacy: But it's not a problem, right -- since that friend of yours can save Shane's life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: There you go.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Natalie: You bet. And I hope your mom comes around soon.",
        "Starr: I do, too. I should really be getting back to her.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Starr: It was so sweet of you guys to wait around for me, just to watch my locket and to keep it safe. It's all I have left of Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I should get going.",
        "Jessica: Oh, okay. Hi, you know.",
        "Brody: I'm really glad I ran into you.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Uh, you know, maybe we could run into each other some time on purpose.",
        "Brody: Meaning?",
        "Jessica: Meaning -- we're friends, right? Maybe, uh, you can call me some time.",
        "Brody: So you think we made the right decision, to just be friends?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You might want to bag this up, too.",
        "Natalie: Is that Starr's toothbrush?",
        "Jared: I grabbed it while you two were talking. We bring that to the lab, we have everything we need to prove that Jessica's baby belongs to Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Yeah, we made the right decision to stay friends. Anyways, I was reminded today that I, uh, come with a lot of baggage.",
        "Brody: Yeah, me, too. Okay, all right, I'm going to go.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Brody: Bye, baby. All right. Bye, Jessie.",
        "Jessica: Um --",
        "Brody: Uh, yeah, okay.",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Brody: See you.",
        "Marcie: Seems like you and Brody are, uh --",
        "Jessica: Are just friends.",
        "Marcie: Okay, whatever you say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Cristian? Cristian, wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Are you sure everything's okay? I mean, you and that Lola were acting all weird when I walked in. Were you guys fighting?",
        "Markko: No.",
        "Langston: Are you sure? You can tell me.",
        "Markko: Everything's fine, okay?",
        "Langston: Okay.",
        "Markko: Hey.",
        "Markko: I love you, Langston.",
        "Langston: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Stop ignoring me. Why are you acting like a jerk? All right, that's it. We're going to have it out -- right here, right now.",
        "Cristian: Wait, Layla, don't close it --",
        "Layla: You are not going anywhere.",
        "Cristian: Neither are you. Not even a pushy broad like yourself can open that door from the inside.",
        "Cristian: That's right. We're trapped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Now why do I get the feeling that you don't really like Gigi's sister very much?",
        "Viki: Stacy? I just met her.",
        "Charlie: Viki, I could tell you didn't like her the minute she walked in here.",
        "Viki: Gigi and I actually had a little chat about her sister the other day. And let's just say that we both have sisters that we don't trust.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: What friend?",
        "Stacy: You know -- your friend, the one that can save Shane's life.",
        "Roxy: I don't know what the hell you're talking about.",
        "Stacy: Seriously, Roxy? I think you do.",
        "Michael: Good news. Shane is responding really well to the chemotherapy. Ahem.",
        "Rex: There's something else, Michael? What is it?",
        "Michael: We're going to need to find another bone marrow donor sooner than expected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Let's not play games, Roxy. I know your dirty little secret.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Marty: I want to hire you to represent my son, Cole.",
        "Cristian: If you hate me so much, then why do you care what I think about you?",
        "Gigi: God wouldn't just take him away, would he?",
        "John: I think the killer's leaving us a message."
