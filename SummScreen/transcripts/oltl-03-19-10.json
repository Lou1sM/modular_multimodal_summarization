        "Kelly: I'm looking forward to working with you, Todd, especially since I'm getting so well compensated for it.",
        "Blair: Are you kidding me? You want this job like you want to watch paint dry, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Actually, I just want to drive you up the wall it's drying on.",
        "Todd: Thanks, Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Glad you guys could come on such short notice. There's something I want to run past you before the custody hearing.",
        "Rex: Look, I don't want a repeat of what happened at the hospital, okay? Gigi was supposed to walk out of there with Sierra. She was set up with temporary custody.",
        "Eli: Which I won for her. Unfortunately, T\u00e9a came.",
        "Rex: Outmaneuvered you, and now Schuy has the baby?",
        "Gigi: Rex.",
        "Eli: I'm doing everything I can.",
        "Rex: Well, maybe that's not good enough. If T\u00e9a's playing dirty, you've gotta play dirtier.",
        "Eli: Oh, I plan to. I'm gonna need you and Gigi to play dirty, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Oh. Sorry. Not again. Uhh.",
        "T\u00e9a: Better the bottle than the baby. Let me clean this off.",
        "Schuyler: I can do that. I can--I'll get it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ooh. If you can find the sink.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I know. It's gotten a little out of hand.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha. Relax. I got it.",
        "Schuyler: Okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi, little girl. Hi, little boy. Is Rachel here?",
        "Schuyler: She had an emergency at the treatment center. I'm still kind of getting the multitasking thing down.",
        "T\u00e9a: You are doing great. Just take things one at a time, okay?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, great's not good enough. I mean, this baby's the most important thing that's ever happened to me. I mean, if I don't get permanent custody...just tell me it's gonna happen, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm afraid I can't guarantee that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Pop music playing]",
        "Natalie: I--I didn't know you were gonna be here. If I'd known, I wouldn't have come.",
        "John: Don't worry about it.",
        "Natalie: I said I wasn't gonna get in between you and Marty. I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Check out the commissioner and the D.A. getting down.",
        "Brody: Who knew they could do that?",
        "Layla: I wish Cris were here. We'd give them a run for their money.",
        "Brody: I believe it. Where is he tonight? He's missing a hell of a party.",
        "Layla: I have no idea. But wherever he is, Jessica probably followed him there.",
        "Jessica: You remember that, don't you? Our first kiss. We can have it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Why do you need us to help you? Don't you already have enough evidence to make Sky look like an unfit father?",
        "Eli: Well, the Ethics Committee cleared Schuyler of stealing that oxytocin from the hospital.",
        "Gigi: But he did it.",
        "Eli: The court doesn't know that.",
        "Rex: Well, it will once Gigi and I swear on a stack of bibles what Schuyler told us. The guy was planning to induce labor in Stacy early to fool me to make it look like that I was the kid's father.",
        "Eli: Well, we do have several witnesses who will swear that Schuyler repeatedly denied paternity of his daughter. And it's on record that he's a recovering addict.",
        "Rex: Okay. So we can work that angle. Who knows what kind of stuff Schuyler pulled while he was snorting his way through sin city?",
        "Eli: All right, well, that's in the past. We've gotta prove that Schuyler is an unfit parent in the present.",
        "Gigi: So, how do we do that?",
        "Eli: We let Schuyler do it for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Gigi's lawyer what?",
        "T\u00e9a: Eli petitioned the court for a home visit from Children's Services.",
        "Schuyler: A home visit? A home visit? Here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, yeah. A social worker's gonna come to observe you with the baby, inspect Sierra's environment, make sure it's safe.",
        "Schuyler: T\u00e9a, oh, my God. When?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um...well...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: I don't think Schuyler's apartment or his parenting skills are gonna pass muster with Children's Services' strict guidelines. Do you?",
        "Rex: This is good. But is it a slam-dunk? I do not want Gigi to have to watch him take Sierra Rose away again.",
        "Eli: I understand, but Schuyler is the father. Gigi, you're only the aunt. This isn't a slam-dunk.",
        "Gigi: Then how do we make it one?",
        "Eli: If you want this baby, you two have to be willing to do whatever it takes, no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Okay, what's the matter, Blair? You jealous?",
        "Blair: Jealous? I rejected you, remember?",
        "Todd: For Eli? You were never serious about him.",
        "Blair: You think you stuck it to me by signing that contract? Well, what you did, you stuck it to yourself, because guess what, Kelly? You're now stuck working for that jerk. Joke's on you, flea. Ooh!",
        "Kelly: Satisfied?",
        "Todd: With what?",
        "Kelly: Blair still cares about you, and I still know how to press her buttons. Mission accomplished.",
        "Todd: Wait, no, no. No, no, no.",
        "Kelly: Show is over. You don't actually think I want this job, do you?",
        "Todd: Like you've got anything else to do.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I am gonna book another flight to London. That's where I was headed before you had me dragged here, remember?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I don't think so.",
        "Kelly: Really. Why not?",
        "Todd: This is your signature, is it not?",
        "Kelly: So?",
        "Todd: So...I own you now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Jessica, I can't do this.",
        "Jessica: But you want to. I know you felt something when you remembered kissing me in high school.",
        "Cristian: Things were different then.",
        "Jessica: No, no, they're not. You are still the same boy that I fell in love with right here in this gym.",
        "Cristian: You keep saying that.",
        "Jessica: And you believe it. I know that you do. You know that we were good together. Why are you fighting it? Can't you just admit that you feel something for me?",
        "Cristian: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You need to start dancing, boss. This party is all about your baby. Can I have a beer?",
        "John: Who else knows?",
        "Roxy: Heads up, everybody! There's a mama in the house. Hip-hip, hooray!",
        "Brody: Congrats, Marty.",
        "Nora: Mazel tov.",
        "Layla: Somebody get this woman a soda so we can get to toasting.",
        "Roxy: Nothing like a little bambino to bring out the best in everybody. What's the matter with you? How come you're not excited about a baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Whoa. Children's Services is sending someone tonight?",
        "T\u00e9a: Apparently.",
        "Schuyler: With no notice? They can do that?",
        "T\u00e9a: It's a spot check. That's the point.",
        "Schuyler: How am I supposed to pass a social worker's inspection, T\u00e9a? I'm flying by the seat of my pants here.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what? I have to admit when I first got the call, I was worried.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. You didn't do anything to stop it, apparently.",
        "T\u00e9a: And seeing you now, I'm relieved.",
        "Schuyler: Are you serious? Have you seen this place?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. Schuyler, you're a new parent. They expect something of a mess.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, what about complete chaos?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. Whoever they send over will see what I see. That you're wonderful with your daughter. Hi.",
        "Schuyler: That's gonna be good enough for the judge?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, you handle the social worker. I'll handle whatever else Eli throws at us, okay?",
        "Schuyler: Okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. I think you're gonna be able to keep her. I really do.",
        "Schuyler: What about Gigi?",
        "T\u00e9a: What about Gigi?",
        "Schuyler: I mean, how can I take away the one thing she wants most?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I would do anything for Sierra Rose.",
        "Eli: Glad to hear that.",
        "Gigi: That baby's my family. She's all I've got left of my sister, and I promised Stacy I would take care of her.",
        "Eli: And you will.",
        "Gigi: I have to. I don't trust Schuyler to do it. Not after everything he's done to endanger her.",
        "Rex: Eli, just tell us what to do and we'll do it. Say the word.",
        "Eli: Two words, actually. Get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: We are so thrilled for you and John.",
        "Marty: Oh, thank you.",
        "Bo: You guys are gonna have a heck of a kid.",
        "Layla: Here's your soda, mama.",
        "Marty: Thank you. So much for keeping it quiet.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Marty. It's all my fault.",
        "Layla: Did I put my foot in it?",
        "Brody: Don't worry about it.",
        "Layla: You're right. I have bigger things to worry about.",
        "Brody: We both do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Of course I feel something for you, Jess. But it's nostalgia for me. It's not the here and now like it is for you.",
        "Jessica: Don't say that.",
        "Cristian: It's true. And I'm sorry...",
        "Jessica: Why are you doing this? Why are you trashing everything between us?",
        "Cristian: I'm not. I told you. I remember what it was like. I thought nothing could come between us. I thought we'd be together always, forever.",
        "Jessica: And we can be. We said we were forever.",
        "Cristian: We were teenagers, Jess. I was sure that I'd love you forever.",
        "Jessica: And you still can. Why can't you just forget everything that happened...",
        "Cristian: Jessica, please.",
        "Jessica: Be like me. Be with me. Make us the here and now.",
        "Cristian: Do you really think that would work? If I just pretend everything else never happened?",
        "Jessica: Why not? All of the complicated stuff that came between us, everything that broke us up. You can just let it go. We can just--it can just be you and me. Things can be so much more simpler. Isn't there a part of you that wants that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Next round's on me.",
        "Layla: Oh, I'll drink to that. And here's to hoping Jessica remembers you soon. And stays away from Cris.",
        "Brody: I'll drink to that.",
        "[Clink]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So, where's that man-killer of yours?",
        "Oliver: Uh, he had a shift at the hospital.",
        "Roxy: He is such a great guy.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, he is.",
        "Roxy: No, I really mean that. I mean, I love the two of you, but you scored big time, flounder.",
        "Oliver: Trust me, I know.",
        "Roxy: Did you know that he's the one who broke the news to me about Stacy's baby not being my grandkid?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, he told me.",
        "Roxy: He could've lost his medical license, but he didn't want me to worry. Now everybody knows the truth. I just can't believe that the baby daddy is that creep Schuyler.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I know Gigi's supposed to be, like, the bad guy or whatever.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no, no. In this case, she is the bad guy.",
        "Schuyler: I don't see her that way. I mean, I love her.",
        "T\u00e9a: She's trying to take your child away from you.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, because I lied. I lied over and over and over again. My lies tore us apart.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I told a lot of lies myself. About my own daughter. I kept her from her father and I lost the man I love.",
        "Schuyler: So, he left you because you lied?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um, at first, but then he forgave me.",
        "Schuyler: Well, that's good. So it all worked out.",
        "T\u00e9a: My daughter couldn't accept him. I had to break up with him. I, um, I had no other choice. It was the only way I could salvage my relationship with my daughter.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. You're talking about Todd Manning, for one.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know how you feel about him, but I love him, Schuyler, and I can't stop.",
        "Schuyler: So, how do you deal? You miss him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You two are gonna need some time to think about this, so just call me as soon as you can.",
        "Gigi: So, you're serious. You think Rex and I should get married.",
        "Eli: Oh, absolutely. It's gonna go that much further toward proving that your home is that much more fit than Schuyler's. See, a married blood-aunt will trump a deeply flawed single father any day.",
        "Gigi: Um, I raised Shane all by myself. I mean, he turned out just fine.",
        "Eli: It's all about strategy. You said you didn't want a repeat of what happened at the hospital. This way we kill two birds with one stone. Look. You broke up with Schuyler over your belief that Rex was your sister's baby's father. T\u00e9a's bound to bring that up in the hearing.",
        "Gigi: So?",
        "Eli: So, it could appear that you hold a grudge against this baby.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Rex: Are you kidding?",
        "Eli: I'm just trying to tell you what the judge will see. So why not make it look like all is forgiven?",
        "Rex: By getting married.",
        "Eli: Look, you said you wanted a slam-dunk. I'm trying to give you one. Now, I know you guys need some time to think. Don't take too much time. The hearing's tomorrow. Call me when you've made a decision.",
        "Rex: Yeah. All right.",
        "Gigi: Thanks.",
        "Eli: Good night.",
        "Blair: Mm!",
        "Eli: Hmm-hmm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: It doesn't matter if I miss him. I had to make a choice. I had to choose between Todd and my daughter and I chose my daughter.",
        "Schuyler: I mean, you don't think you can have both?",
        "T\u00e9a: Nah. It was over between us. There were too many lies to get past. You know, it wasn't-- it wasn't--it wasn't good anymore between us. I suspect it wasn't any good between you and Gigi anymore, either.",
        "Schuyler: I don't know.",
        "T\u00e9a: The thing you have to ask yourself, Schuyler, is... how much does this little girl mean to you?",
        "Schuyler: Everything. Everything. She means everything to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: More than Gigi?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I was talking to Roxy about the baby, and I said something and then she said something and then--and then Nora and Layla walked in and they heard, and I'm really sorry. I didn't--I didn't mean-- I didn't mean for that to happen.",
        "Marty: Like you didn't mean to tell John I was pregnant before I did?",
        "Natalie: Yes, exactly like that.",
        "John: This one's on me.",
        "Natalie: I'm gonna leave the two of you alone.",
        "John: Look, um... Bo asked me what was going on and I can't lie to him. A couple of the guys overheard us when I was talking about the baby.",
        "Marty: I haven't even told Cole yet and now there's a whole bar full of people celebrating.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I thought you were gonna fight for your lady.",
        "Brody: I've tried. Nothing's worked. Plus, I've been told to back off.",
        "Layla: By who? Jessica's parents? I thought they liked you.",
        "Brody: No. Marty. She's treating Jessica. She says I need to give her space, that Jessica's mind needs to be where it is so she doesn't have to deal with what Mitch Laurence tried to do to her. Part of me wonders maybe if Jessica could remember that, if she'd remember everything else.",
        "Layla: What would happen if you told her about Mitch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I can't let everything else go, Jessica. This is my life.",
        "Jessica: We'll make a new one.",
        "Cristian: I'm with Layla now. You don't know what we've been through. How long it took me to convince her to trust me.",
        "Jessica: Convince her? What-- you had to beg?",
        "Cristian: We both have been through some stuff. It's not easy for either of us to be in a relationship. But you know what? We have each other. And she means a lot to me. And I don't want to mess that up.",
        "Jessica: So, you're really choosing Layla?",
        "Cristian: Yes, I am.",
        "Cristian: Jess, listen to me. Look, I--I know this hurts right now. But eventually, you'll heal. And what we had will be a part of your past. Just like it's a part of mine. You have a great future. You still have a lot of living to do. And you have Brody. And he's a really great guy and he loves you. Jess.",
        "[Jessica crying]",
        "Cristian: He loves you in the here and now. He loves you.",

        "Kelly: You own me? You don't seriously think I want to work for you.",
        "Todd: You signed a contract saying you did.",
        "Kelly: That was for show. We both wanted to stick it to Blair.",
        "Todd: No. I didn't. Well, maybe I did a little bit, but mostly I just want you to work for me. So, you're gonna honor this contract... or I'm gonna sue you for every nickel you have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. I needed that.",
        "Eli: Yeah. I kinda got that feeling.",
        "Blair: Ahh. You're never gonna believe what Todd pulled on me today. He offered my cousin a contract to go work for him at \"The Sun.\"",
        "Eli: And that's--that's bad, I guess.",
        "Blair: Yeah. It's Kelly and I hate her. He only did it to get to me and then he accused me of being jealous.",
        "Eli: Oh, but you're not jealous, are you?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Eli: No. You just ran all the way over here to see me, not because you wanted to forget about Todd. Just--",
        "Blair: Is there a problem here?",
        "Eli: You know, after the last time we hooked up, Blair, I thought we were done with this.",
        "Blair: This--what?",
        "Eli: This. This coming to see me to forget Todd. I was obviously wrong.",
        "Blair: I can't tell you about my day? What is it you want from me, Eli?",
        "Eli: I want you to come see me to see me. I don't want it to be about Todd. I'm tired of that guy. Until you can do that, don't show up at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Go ahead. Sue me.",
        "Todd: I will. And I'll do you one better.",
        "Kelly: Who are you calling?",
        "Todd: Yeah, put me through to \"The London Star today,\" will you? Just a little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between colleagues. I thought they might be interested in a story about the London branch of the Buchanan family.",
        "Kelly: Excuse me?",
        "Todd: Hi there. It's Todd Manning from \"The Sun.\" Give me the editor's desk, please. Zane knows who his father is, right?",
        "Kelly: What the hell do you think you're doing, Todd?",
        "Todd: I'm gonna tell all of England that you slept with Kevin's son.",
        "Kelly: You wouldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Excuse me, Elijah. I thought that you were having some fun here, too.",
        "Eli: Oh, yeah, Blair, it's a blast. It's a real party being your go-to guy every time you're upset about Todd.",
        "Blair: That's what you think I'm doing?",
        "Eli: I know it. I want more.",
        "Blair: Well, I don't. And you just lost the best thing you ever had.",

        "Schuyler: I hate hurting Gigi.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, she has no problem hurting you. And if you let your guard down even for a second in that courtroom, Gigi will snatch that baby away from you, and Rex and Gigi will bring up this little girl, not you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Do I need to go pick up Shane, or are Moe and Noelle going to--",
        "Gigi: No, they just said call when we're ready, and they'll bring him home.",
        "Rex: Right. Morasco--",
        "Gigi: I can't do this.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: Go inside and sit around while Schuy has Stacy's baby.",
