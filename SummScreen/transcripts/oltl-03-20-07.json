        "Natalie: Yep, no worries. I could do this in my sleep.",
        "Bo: I've been thinking about it, Natalie, and I'm not going to ask for your resignation. You can keep this desk job as long as you like.",
        "Natalie: That's very generous of you, Uncle Bo, but I don't know -- filing police reports just isn't really what I imagined doing with my life.",
        "Bo: All right. You just take all the time you need and I'm going to figure it out, ok?",
        "Natalie: I already know what I want. I just doubt I'll ever get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Ok. How are you? Are you in any pain?",
        "Antonio: No, it's not so bad.",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Antonio: I have my keys in here somewhere.",
        "Jessica: Oh, let me get them. Let me get them. It's ok.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. Thanks, Jess.",
        "Jessica: What are wives for?",
        "Antonio: No, seriously. You've been with me every step of the way. I'm sorry that I -- that I was suspicious of you and Nash.",
        "Jessica: No, I'm sorry that I -- I didn't tell you how we felt about each other. We can't stand one another. Um -- how can I make sure that you don't worry about that again?",
        "Antonio: Why don't you let me take care of Nash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Huh.",
        "Nash: Hey. What's going on?",
        "Vincent: I heard you were reopening.",
        "Nash: Yeah, a couple of hours. Get you a drink?",
        "Vincent: Cool. Wow, I'm impressed. Got the place up and running so soon.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, most of the fire was contained out back -- not much damage out here at all.",
        "Vincent: Lucky.",
        "Nash: In a way. I mean, Capricorn is still standing, but the arsonist managed to burn a lot of other things around here down to the ground.",
        "Vincent: Mm-hmm.",

        "Viki: Clint! Oh, hi. Well, this is a surprise -- come in.",
        "Clint: Thanks. I was hoping to catch you at home.",
        "Viki: Yeah. You look like you're all dressed up. We don't have a date, do we?",

        "Nora: I need to borrow a gun.",
        "Bo: Huh?",
        "Nora: Any gun will do, preferably lethal and loaded. I have an insurance agent to murder.",
        "Bo: What happened?",
        "Nora: They refused to pay my claim.",
        "Bo: What -- yeah, but your policy covers arson, doesn't it?",
        "Nora: Arson cases that have been solved. According to their brilliant investigators, they aren't liable for anything until it's proven that I didn't set fire to my own house.",
        "Bo: But what happened to \"innocent until proven guilty\"?",
        "Nora: Apparently, that doesn't apply to insurance companies.",
        "Bo: Do you need somebody to vouch for you?",
        "Nora: Oh, they'll probably just accuse you of being in on it. They have the audacity to accuse me of burning down my house with my son in it? I need the gun.",
        "Bo: That's crazy.",
        "Nora: It's criminal. I have no house and no money to buy a new one.",

        "Marcie: Uh -- 10 minutes. Want to wait?",

        "Marcie: Great. Then you can take this quiz with me.",
        "Michael: Quiz? What quiz?",

        "Dorian: She's in labor.",
        "Roxy: I was close, huh?",
        "Dorian: You are going to use topcoat, aren't you?",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. You know, I'm -- I'm just a little nervous because the last time I had a highfalutin client like you, the circus was in town.",
        "Dorian: Oh. I can see why.",
        "Roxy: I'm sorry about this place. I know it looks a little schlocky. I think I should've desisted on more pink, you know?",
        "Dorian: Pink -- yes, pink. More pink would've made all the difference.",
        "Roxy: Well, how about if I offer you a free bikini wax -- what do you say?",
        "Dorian: Oh. Another time, perhaps. I -- I have to get ready for a date tonight.",

        "Dorian: Huh. Roxy, it's just a date.",
        "Roxy: Hey, I can see by the way your cheeks are turning red, I think it's more than just another date.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So you have a date with Dorian. Hmm, it was nice knowing you.",
        "Clint: I didn't mean to open with that -- it just came out.",
        "Viki: Well, it was honest. So, where are you going?",
        "Clint: Just going out to dinner.",
        "Viki: Oh. Better get a move on because you do not want to keep her waiting.",
        "Clint: Hmm --",
        "Viki: Something else?",
        "Clint: Viki, I didn't come here to push this in your face.",
        "Viki: Hey, come on. At least I know where I stand.",
        "Clint: I -- I just think it's best that everything be out in the open and, you know, with our relationship I -",
        "Viki: Clint --",
        "Clint: I just thought you should know... What? We're friends, right? We're good friends. We're the parents of great kids -- that's it, for the moment, hmm? Ok, you're jealous. Now, the question is, are you jealous because I'm going out with another woman or are you jealous because I'm going out with Dorian Lord?",

        "Natalie: You got home really late last night.",
        "John: Same thing -- heavy caseload. You avoiding me, huh?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. You, too? Since that fight.",
        "John: What do you say we put a stop to that?",
        "Natalie: What, avoiding each other?",
        "John: That, the fighting, all of it.",
        "Natalie: You have any idea how we're going to be able to do that? you disappear for good.",
        "John: Well, I'm not exactly the go-to guy for relationship advice, especially when I'm -- I'm a big part of the problem, which I am.",
        "Natalie: Well, I mean, that's something huge, you admitting it.",
        "John: I never said I was perfect.",
        "Natalie: True -- the disclaimer read loud and clear. Hmm.",

        "Nora: I know, I know, I know. It's just it's -- you know, it -- it's just lately, it's just been, you know, one thing after another and --",
        "Bo: Is living at Asa's making it harder for you?",
        "Nora: No, no, they're absolutely fabulous. They're wonderful, really, they are. It's just, you know, after all that time lost in the hospital and I just got my life back on track and now I'm, yep, coming off the rails again!",
        "Bo: Well, it's not forever.",
        "Nora: I know, I know it's not. I got it. I get it. I'll stop with the self- pity now, I really will. I mean, because after all, Matthew and I are ok, right, you know? Matthew and I are fine. We're fine and that's -- that's all that should matter.",
        "Bo: Yeah, come in.",
        "Talia: Sorry to interrupt, sir.",
        "Bo: That's all right, no problem.",
        "Talia: Forensics came back on the shoe print they found at Capricorn.",
        "Bo: Size-12 sneaker.",
        "Talia: We have a brand, too -- Cougars. A new imprint, though. Some line put out by a popular rap artist. It's a limited edition.",
        "Nora: Well, that is a lucky break. There can't be too many of those in Llanview.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Listen, why don't you call the U.S. distributor, see where they're sold.",
        "Talia: I -- I already took care of that, and there's only one place in Llanview that sells them. It's at Logan's, and they special-ordered one pair, size 12, three months ago.",

        "Vincent: That's a good sign -- humor.",
        "Nash: Good sign.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. I mean, here I am thinking you're burying yourself into your work to get over your woman problems, but if you can crack a joke, that's --",
        "Nash: Does it look like I'm smiling?",
        "Vincent: It's a process, Nash. You can't expect to wake up one morning and be over this woman. It's not like a cold.",
        "Nash: Oh. She is much more than a cold. It's terminal.",
        "Vincent: So what are you going to do about it? You going to let this woman kill you or you going to go do something about it?",

        "Antonio: Look, if you can't stand being near each other, then you need to steer clear.",
        "Jessica: Steer clear -- yeah. Um, what about Bree?",
        "Antonio: I will be the go-between when Bree's concerned and that way, you don't have to think about Nash and you can get on with your life. I mean, it's an easy fix, Jess. If you don't want to be with him, you don't have to.",
        "Jessica: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Antonio: So you agree with me, then?",
        "Jessica: I think that we should stop talking and you should go inside and get off your feet. That's what I think.",
        "Antonio: It's a good thing -- Carlotta and",

        "Jamie: I missed you, Papi.",
        "Antonio: Yucky, and I missed you. I can't think of a better way to lift my spirits than to be here with all my girls. Hmm. Come here and give me a hug.",

        "Viki: Ok. I am not jealous. I am not jealous you're going out with Dorian Lord, I'm not jealous you're going out -- sorry!",
        "Clint: I wasn't trying to make you jealous.",
        "Viki: So why are you here?",
        "Clint: Because I didn't want you to hear it from somebody else.",
        "Viki: Why not? Who cares?",
        "Clint: I think that you care.",
        "Viki: No, I don't care. It's your life, it's your decision.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I know that, and I'm just trying to keep you in the loop -- that's all.",
        "Viki: But I don't want to be in the loop. It's none of my business. Clint, you can do whatever -- you can get -- do -- you can go out with anyone you want to.",
        "Clint: Oh. Then I shouldn't be worrying about you?",
        "Viki: No. Why would -- why are we even having this discussion?",
        "Clint: Talk about mixed signals.",
        "Viki: What does that mean?",
        "Clint: Where was this laissez faire attitude of yours a few months ago, huh?",
        "Viki: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Clint: When you couldn't wait to find out what was going on between me and Dorian, and then you tell me what you thought about it.",
        "Viki: Ok, ok. Here, let -- let me put this very succinctly, ok? You have a free pass. You go out with Dorian, you go out with anybody you want to -- you won't hear a word about it from me.",

        "Dorian: Oh!",
        "Roxy: Clint Buchanan? Viki must be plotzing with jealousy.",
        "Dorian: Viki has no right to plotz about anything. They're no longer married.",
        "Roxy: Well, according to my kid Natalie, Viki is working her mojo on the Clintster, and he's got a soft spot for that kind of hoodoo.",
        "Dorian: Huh -- trust me, Roxy. I've got this situation well in hand.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I'm sure you do. But, Dorian, if you need a leg up, I know this little old blind lady on Esther street and she sells potions out of a grocery cart.",
        "Dorian: Do you think my nails are dry yet?",
        "Roxy: Oh, let me put that -- that spray --",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes.",
        "Roxy: That quicky, quicky no-sticky dry.",
        "Dorian: Wait, wait --",
        "Roxy: Listen, if you don't like the idea of the potions, what about hypnotism? Nigel -- you know, Asa's butler? Well, he and I were hypnotized by accident a couple of years ago.",
        "Marcie: \"Does he have a tell? Does he scratch his nose or cover his mouth when you ask him uncomfortable questions?\" What idiot would be that obvious? Oh, wait -- this is my favorite. \"Is he fidgety?\" I mean, it's so dumb.",
        "Michael: Huh, totally.",
        "Marcie: You know, as if anyone doesn't know this stuff instinctively.",
        "Michael: Huh.",
        "Marcie: You know, I should write the editor a letter and tell her that, you know, she insults people's intelligence with stuff like this.",
        "Michael: How much longer, Marce?",
        "Marcie: \"If you answered yes to any of these questions, your man is a liar and you better run because your relationship is on fire.\"",

        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Rox! You want to tell me if I'm done?",
        "Roxy: Sure thing, honey! Hey, I just love walk-in traffic, and if you guys are looking for a haircut, no credit cards because my credit card machine is busted. Just checks and cash.",
        "Man: That's cool. We're down with that, too.",
        "Dorian: Oh, dear.",
        "Man: Come on.",
        "Dorian: Wh-- what? How dare you!",
        "Man: You shut the hell up or we'll take your gold fillings.",
        "Dorian: Look, they are going to hunt you down! They're going to find you.",
        "Roxy: Look, you know, you got to forgive my friend because she's got roulette's syndrome and she just can't shut shut her mouth.",

        "Marcie: What my wedding ring. No this is my wedding ring.",

        "Vincent: Yeah. You still didn't answer my question -- what are you going to do, Nash? Are you going to let this girl kill you? Or are you going to stand up and take some action?",
        "Nash: There's no point.",
        "Vincent: Come on, Nash. You said you love her.",
        "Nash: Look, it doesn't matter what I do. This woman is not going to leave her husband. She made her choice. She chose the family she's already got -- the guy and the kids and the ready-made life, blended family, whatever they call it. With me, I'm all she gets -- no in-laws and cousins and aunts. She chose her husband. She didn't choose me.",

        "Nora: You know, this is more than enough to bring Jones in on a thorough debrief.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but aren't you just a little bit skeptical? I mean, at first, Jones' property -- it's -- it's torched, all the physical evidence points to Cristian Vega, and now all of a sudden, Cristian's brother -- he's targeted. All the evidence points right back to Jones.",
        "Talia: Well, it shores up the theory that he's just out to settle some score with, you know, Antonio and Cristian.",
        "Nora: Look, it's a lead, and even if it leads nowhere, it's all we have right now.",
        "Bo: Yeah. You up to this?",
        "Talia: Absolutely.",
        "Bo: All right, bring him in, shake him down, see what comes loose.",

        "Nora: Nice work, Talia, following up that footprint.",
        "Talia: Well, we still haven't found our man yet.",

        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Vincent: You're the one with the problem.",
        "Nash: Oh, I'm fine.",
        "Vincent: If you're so sure that there's nothing doing between you and this woman, maybe you should leave her alone. Because your mouth is saying it's over, but your eyes are saying something else altogether.",
        "Vincent: Hello?",
        "Talia: This is officer Sahid. I need you to come down to the station, Mr. Jones, right away.",
        "Vincent: Not another fire?",
        "Talia: No. We just uncovered some new evidence. We need you to take a look at it. It's a visual, so we can't do it over the phone.",
        "Vincent: You sure you just don't want to see my pretty face?",
        "Talia: Yeah, you pegged me, Jones. It's all a ruse because I so enjoy your company.",

        "Viki: Well, of course it is. You asked the woman out on a date, you feel guilty.",
        "Clint: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not how it happened. I did not ask her out. She asked me.",
        "Viki: Whatever! The point is, you're going out with her, right? And for some bizarre reason, you feel im-- impelled to inform me of that fact.",
        "Clint: I wanted to be sure --",

        "Viki: Now, you had better answer that, because it's probably Dorian wondering where you are.",
        "Clint: It's Dorian. Yes, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Clint, I am so sorry, but I have to change our plans a bit.",

        "Nora: Oh, it was lovely.",
        "Viki: If you need anything at all, please let me know.",
        "Nora: Oh, God -- we're not needing for anything. -- Asa has completely showered Matthew with candy and video games and horses and small European countries. Oh, God. And Ren\u00ef\u00bf\u00bde -- she keeps buying me clothes. Every time I go back there, there's a new jacket or sweater or shoes, and -- I may have arrived with nothing, but when I leave there, it's going to be with a caravan of moving vans.",
        "Viki: It's getting to you, isn't it -- living with them?",
        "Nora: Oh, God. You're the second person that said that to me today. You know, they're wonderful. They really are. It's -- I'm very difficult to live with, Viki.",

        "Nora: I am. I'm just so used to it being just Matthew and me, you know? And then -- I really like my own space.",
        "Viki: Well, you get used to that, don't you?",
        "Nora: Yeah, I do. I just crave a night on the couch with a pint of ice cream and my fuzzy slippers.",

        "Nora: Are you kidding? I wouldn't want to disillusion him about me after all these years.",
        "Viki: You couldn't possibly do that. He adores you.",
        "Nora: He has been wonderful. He really has been. He's like a father to me, if you want to know the truth, and he's just -- and Clint -- he's such a gentleman. When Asa gets a little overbearing, Clint will just step in and gallantly shift the focus over to him.",
        "Viki: Oh. How does he do that?",
        "Nora: Oh, well, this morning, it was starting, and all Clint had to do was say Dorian's name, and that did it -- bam!",
        "Viki: Isn't that strange? Just before you arrived, Clint was here. That's what we talked about -- Dorian.",
        "Nora: Um -- you -- you know that they're sort of seeing each other, right?",

        "John: Yeah, that's it. Obviously, you're not going to tell me anything. And truth be told, I have a dinner I sort of need to get to.",

        "John: Are you coming or not?",

        "John: What's going on? About dinner? I don't know -- it usually involves someone putting a plate in front of you. Natalie and I are going to go to a place that does that.",
        "Michael: Yeah, and then you eat, and you do it every single night.",
        "John: All right -- I guess we got to get a few things out in the open -- how's that?",

        "Viki: Yeah. It's ugly, isn't it?",
        "Nora: No, not really. No, thank you. Ugly? Ugly is finding out your husband's using you as a beard. Ugly is a year worth of bedpans. Jealousy, piece of cake, because you can do something about it.",
        "Viki: Like what?",
        "Nora: Well -- do you want Clint?",
        "Viki: He deserves a hell of a lot better than Dorian.",
        "Nora: But the question was, do you want Clint? Because if you do, you're going to have to take off your gloves and knock her back to the stone age. You're going to have to fight for him.",

        "Vincent: Well, Officer Sahid thinks that I'm the one who set the fires at Capricorn.",
        "Natalie: That's crazy.",
        "Talia: Well, we may have evidence that suggests otherwise.",
        "Natalie: Evidence? Oh. Like the evidence you found at Cristian's that made Cris look guilty for, what, two seconds?",
        "Talia: I know you're close to Cristian and Vincent, but that does not change the fact that both of them --",
        "Natalie: I don't want to hear it. If you're going to go after Vincent, you're going to have to go through me first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Well, I don't know where that came from. Because between me and Natalie, it's hard enough for me to say these things once. I don't want to rehearse it now.",
        "Michael: You still love her, John?",
        "John: Things aren't so clear to me, mike.",
        "Michael: That's a bad sign, brother.",
        "John: Look, it seems like all we do these days is fight, you know? Ever since I got out of the hospital, we got that damn ring hanging over us like the sword of Damocles or something. It's like -- it's like our relationship jumped forward, we -- we skipped a step, and now nothing's been right since.",
        "Michael: It's not the ring, John. It's you.",
        "John: Either way, Mike, we're not connected, you know? And all I know is I don't like someone dominating every aspect of my life.",
        "Michael: She's taking care of you, John. Now, it's not her fault that you make it a humanly impossible task.",
        "John: And doesn't that tell you something?",
        "Michael: Yes. It tells me that you're a royal pain in the ass.",
        "John: Yeah. And don't you think Natalie deserves better?",
        "Michael: No. I think that Natalie deserves the best possible John.",
        "John: Are you reading those books again? Are you reading chick magazines?",
        "Michael: Hey, I --",
        "John: Son of a --",
        "Michael: I am doing what I have to, to make my marriage work, ok? And it's -- it's not easy, John, not even for me. And the big question is, are you willing to do what it takes to see this thing through with Natalie? You know, because if you're not, I think you're right, John. You should do the right thing and -- and let her go before you really hurt the poor girl.",
