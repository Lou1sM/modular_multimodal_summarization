        "Viki tells Carlotta she can fill in for her and wait tables while Carlotta picks up Jamie. Everybody is surprised to see Viki playing such a role. She is ok to be seen by everybody she knows, that is, except for Dorian. At the B.E. office, Lindsay overhears Bo and Clint's conversation and she reminds Clint she can make herself useful with files she got from Honeycutt. Charlie tells Jared they have to discuss their long overdue issues. Jared is getting along really well with Gigi. They find they have a lot in common with their family situations. And they end up kissing. It clearly brings up feelings for both Rex and for Natalie. Dorian is obviously scheming to keep Adriana in Paris and prevent her from marrying Rex."

        "Singer: Life has you broken down",
        "Viki: Hi, Charlie. How was the interview?",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm still cooling my heels here waiting. Look, I hope I'm not holding you up. You know, if you -- if you want to head home --",
        "Viki: No, no, no, no. I've got plenty to do while I wait. It's kind of lonely at home anyway.",
        "Charlie: I know what you mean -- I missed you last night.",
        "Viki: Hmm, I missed you, too.",
        "Charlie: I'll be there soon as I can.",
        "Viki: Okay, I'll be here.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, sweetheart. You just put your head down on the pillow and rest, okay, and I'll be there soon. Besito.",
        "Viki: Hey, Carlotta. Everything all right?",
        "Carlotta: Jamie's sick.",
        "Viki: Oh, dear. Well, it's not serious, though, right?",
        "Carlotta: Oh, I don't think so, but she's running a fever and Antonio got a few hours overtime at the station and she's staying with a friend and I don't really want her to stay there if she could be contagious.",
        "Viki: Well, I can pick her up for you.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, that's very kind of you but I don't want you to be there, either, and get sick and get whatever she has. No, I'll -- I'll call Markko and see if he can come in and cover.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Carlotta: Excuse me a second and I'll take your order.",
        "Viki: Sure, take your time.",
        "Singer: That's the way it seems that love",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Charlie was with Jared?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, at the Palace, right? They were sitting at a table talking and it looked pretty intense.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Bye.",
        "Jessica: Hey!",
        "Nash: Hey! What are you doing here?",
        "Jessica: Well, I -- I don't know. I -- I filed my story early and I -- I just -- I wanted to see what Cristian had.",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Jessica: That's okay, isn't it?",
        "Nash: Yeah, sure. I wanted the vineyard to be a family business, so --",
        "Jessica: Yeah, we're all in this together, huh?",
        "Nash: Sure are. Huh.",
        "Sarah: Hey, Cris, they're here. Hey!",
        "Nash: Sarah, hi. We're a little early.",
        "Sarah: Hey, no problem. Come on in.",
        "Nash: Great.",
        "Sarah: Uh -- Cris will be down in a second. Can I get you guys something?",
        "Cristian: Hey, guys. I got a couple of sketches here for you.",
        "Nash: Good.",
        "Cristian: I don't know -- don't know if it'll work, but --",
        "Jessica: Wow. Cristian, those are awesome -- aren't they?",
        "Nash: Not really what I was looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: All right, I'm not going to get into all of this with you again, all right? Go ahead, badmouth Lindsay if that's what stokes your fire, but I'm not going to waste my time. Okay? Clint, I'm going to use your shower. I don't want to go back to the gym.",
        "Nora: Bo? I'm sorry. I really am. I do not want Lindsay to be an issue between us, especially now that we're all working together so well, and I certainly don't want Lindsay to be an issue between you and Clint just because he and I agree on how we feel.",
        "Clint: Nora? I never said that I agreed with you on everything.",
        "Nora: Oh? Oh. I'm sorry, I -- I just assumed. Oh. So, you think Lindsay's changed, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey. Did you find Gigi?",
        "Rex: Oh, yeah.",
        "Jared: Ah.",
        "Gigi: That -- never should've happened.",
        "Jared: You're right. That was completely inappropriate on my part. Um -- I'm truly sorry and I hope you accept my apology.",
        "Gigi: And just so you know, I don't usually kiss people I barely know, let alone my boss. Huh. Well, my last boss was Moe and you never met him, but --",
        "Jared: Whoa. I'm -- I'm not your boss, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Uh, yeah, you are.",
        "Jared: Well, I -- I'm just not used to being called that. Look, uh -- I don't want you to think that I was trying to take advantage of you and -- and -- and to be completely upfront, I was --",
        "Gigi: I got it -- me, neither.",
        "Jared: Okay.",
        "Gigi: Let's just forget any of that ever happened.",
        "Jared: Yeah. It's already forgotten.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Could you give this to Gigi for me?",
        "Natalie: Rex, you're upset.",
        "Rex: No, I'm not. I'm just not going to interrupt -- ahem -- a moment for a stupid scarf and I got to go, so if you could take care of returning this for me --",
        "Natalie: Okay, come on, all right? This is me you're talking to here.",
        "Rex: What, you think I'm jealous?",
        "Natalie: Kind of looks that way to me.",
        "Rex: What, of Gigi? The girl I dated, like a -- like a decade ago? Are you kidding? I'm getting married today, to the love of my life.",
        "Natalie: I know. I know.",
        "Rex: Could -- could it be you're -- what's the term? -- Projecting?",
        "Natalie: Me? You think I'm jealous? Oh.",
        "Rex: Not out of the question.",
        "Natalie: Yeah -- no, actually, really it is. It is out of the question, Rex, because Jared's my uncle, all right, and you know what? If Jared and Gigi have chemistry, then I'm happy for him -- them.",
        "Rex: Why? It's not like they're registering for china. What are you so happy about?",
        "Natalie: That Jared's moving on, and obviously Gigi's not hung up on you if she's making out with random bosses in the boardroom.",
        "Rex: No, of course not, but could we not categorize it that way?",
        "Natalie: What? Why?",
        "Rex: That -- that she's making out with -- with \"random bosses in the boardroom.\" You make it sound like she's easy and she is so not -- besides which, I'm sure Jared is the one who kissed her which is really kind of sleazy if you think about it because she's -- she's only been here, like, five seconds and he's already hitting on her.",
        "Natalie: Okay, but you don't know that that's the way it happened.",
        "Rex: I know Gigi and I know that she would not plant a kiss on a guy she barely knows. So, I think you need to let her know Uncle Jared is a serial heartbreaker before she gets hurt the same way you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Nora, all I'm saying is that losing a child, accidentally killing the man that she loved, and then spending time at St. Ann's twice -- how could that not change a person on some fundamental level?",
        "Nora: Wow, I didn't -- I didn't realize that Lindsay had gotten to both of you -- again.",
        "Bo: Excuse me.",
        "Clint: Bo, what are you doing? You don't even have a change of clothes.",
        "Bo: I'm having a suit sent up from the health club and Phyllis will bring it in.",
        "Clint: Bo, there's something I need to talk to you about before you take the shower.",
        "Bo: God, what is it now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What were you looking for?",
        "Nash: Something not so spare.",
        "Cristian: I was going for classy.",
        "Nash: It says cheap to me.",
        "Cristian: Fine. I got others.",
        "Nash: Great.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm sure one of them will be perfect.",
        "Cristian: There you go.",
        "Nash: Too busy.",
        "Cristian: You know, I think maybe you hired the wrong guy.",
        "Nash: Maybe we did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: No luck, huh?",
        "Carlotta: No.",
        "Viki: How about if I fill in for you?",
        "Carlotta: Viki, I couldn't ask you to do that.",
        "Viki: You're not asking -- I offered. Come on, it's between meals, it's all pretty dead. Truthfully, I would enjoy it.",
        "Carlotta: Are you sure?",
        "Viki: Absolutely. Please, Carlotta. You'd be doing me a favor.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, that is so kind. You're an angel.",
        "Viki: Good.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Carlotta: Oh, well, at least -- here. Here, put this on so you can cover your beautiful outfit and, well -- well, you know what to do. Thanks.",
        "Viki: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well, when I didn't hear from you for a day, I was worried.",
        "Adriana: Well, I was busy.",
        "Dorian: So, I -- I -- I was upset that you didn't answer the phone in your room or your cell, so in mid panic, I called the manager of the hotel who told me that the concierge had seen you get in a taxi to go to the airport.",
        "Adriana: Well, I'm sorry that you were panicked.",
        "Dorian: So why didn't you call me? Wasn't I going to be invited to the wedding?",
        "[Adriana sighs]",
        "Adriana: Like you would be interested in a boring ceremony at the justice of the peace with a man that you don't want me to marry.",
        "Dorian: Don't put words in my mouth. Just answer this one question -- what's the big rush?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm very excited to see Adriana -- my future mother-in-law, not so much.",
        "Natalie: Dorian's there?",
        "Rex: Yeah, she popped in -- lucky us. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left in the first place.",
        "Natalie: What the hell are you doing here? Go home and get that toxic woman out of your apartment. And then call me, let me know what time to be at the courthouse and if I can bring anything.",
        "Rex: Just you there. See you soon.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I -- I really need this job. And I -- I can't afford to have any trouble at work especially since I'm new and everything, so I -- I would really appreciate it if you didn't say anything about this to anyone.",
        "Jared: Like I said -- forgotten.",
        "Gigi: You know, I know that it was just a pity kiss.",
        "Jared: What -- no. Gigi, I don't pity you, okay? I admire you. Like I said, I think -- I think Shane is a lucky kid.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, he might feel lucky right now living in a big mansion and all, but none of that is real.",
        "Jared: Well, you know, sometimes at Shane's age, the best things in life aren't real because the things that are --",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Jared: Nothing.",
        "Gigi: I know you grew up without your dad in your life.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: And you didn't find out who he was till you were a grown man and he was gone. Can I ask you a really personal question?",
        "Jared: Yeah, you can ask.",
        "Gigi: When you found out the truth, did you hate your mom for not telling you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I was just thinking that -- well, do you think it's se to allow Ramsey to have access to B.E. files? I mean, it's not too late to change your mind.",
        "Bo: Well, yes, in fact it is. Nora brought that search warrant -- do you remember?",
        "Nora: I promised to keep a very close eye on anyone who gets the information and -- unless you don't trust me, Clint.",
        "Bo: Excuse me.",
        "[Phone beeps]",
        "Bo: Oh -- excuse me again. No -- excuse me for the last time.",
        "Clint: Well, is everything okay?",
        "Bo: Yeah, fine -- it's going to be fine. Could you turn off the water for me?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Bo: And I'm sorry, all right?",
        "Clint: No, no problem.",
        "Bo: No, that's okay. Thank you.",
        "Nora: I didn't mean to start an argument, Clint.",
        "Clint: I know that.",
        "Nora: And I didn't mean to put you on the spot earlier.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Listen, don't you have to go to Natalie's office, get the rest of these files?",
        "Nora: Oh -- okay. Trying to get rid of me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: My mom was the best. I could never hate my mom. I'm not saying she didn't have her own problems, but --",
        "Gigi: Who doesn't?",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: So, did you grow up thinking some other guy was your dad?",
        "Jared: Yeah. And he had problems, too.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I -- I don't mean to be nosy. I hate when people ask me questions like that. It -- I just talk a lot when I'm nervous.",
        "Jared: Gigi, that's okay.",
        "Gigi: Oh -- you know, I'm going to get these copies down to Natalie. Do you need me to do anything for you?",
        "Jared: Yeah -- stop worrying. It's going to be okay.",
        "Gigi: Thank you for talking to me and for caring.",
        "Jared: You don't got to thank me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: tea?",
        "Dorian: Yes, thank you. I have spoken to, well, certain, very prominent people about your wedding including -- including Mayor Lowell. It's going to be humiliating having invited him to the wedding of the year that's not going to happen.",
        "Adriana: As if you wouldn't be thrilled if it got called off.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that is not true, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Look, it's not like you could've told him to save the date -- we didn't even set one.",
        "Dorian: Please, let me plan the wedding of your dreams. I assure you, the second marriage is never the same.",
        "Adriana: \"The second marriage\"?",
        "Dorian: Oh, when I said that, I -- I --",
        "Adriana: I know what you meant, Mom, and frankly, it makes me sick. I am not you -- I don't plan on walking down the aisle six times.",
        "Dorian: The courthouse doesn't have an aisle.",
        "[Adriana sighs]",
        "Adriana: Mother, you had better just bite your tongue and get used to the idea that Rex is going to be your son-in-law for the rest of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Whew.",
        "Viki: I'll be right back to take your order. Here's a menu.",
        "Rex: Thanks, I'm just getting a couple of takeout coff-- Viki?",
        "Viki: Hi, Rex. How are you?",
        "Rex: Honestly, a little weirded out.",
        "Viki: What, by this? Oh, come on, I'm just doing Carlotta a favor -- she's taking care of her granddaughter. Besides, I was going to meet Charlie here, so I thought I'd pitch in. Would you like more coffee?",
        "Rex: Now, I wonder why they told Gigi they had no jobs here if they're so short-staffed.",
        "Viki: I have no idea but actually, it's working out very well for Gigi at B.E. thanks to you, and thank you also for taking care of that other matter.",
        "Rex: I appreciate your hiring me.",
        "Viki: Anytime. So you and Adriana any closer to setting a wedding date, hmm?",
        "Rex: Maybe today.",
        "Viki: Are you kidding? Today?",
        "Rex: Adriana got a chance to come home for, like, a day and she wants to tie the knot before she goes back to Paris.",
        "Viki: Oh, that's awesome. Congratulations.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Viki: Why didn't Natalie tell me?",
        "Rex: Oh, I just told her a few minutes ago.",
        "Viki: Ah -- well, that would explain it. You said you wanted two coffees to go, right?",
        "Rex: Please.",
        "Viki: Okey-dokey. So how is she?",
        "Rex: Natalie?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Rex: You -- you live with her, don't you?",
        "Viki: Yeah, but, you know, she works very long hours and I think that's mostly to avoid her mother.",
        "Rex: You two not getting along?",
        "Viki: Black?",
        "Rex: Both -- yeah.",
        "Viki: Yeah, actually we get along fine, but you know Natalie -- she's very protective, she's very stubborn, and I think right now she's a little upset with me.",
        "Rex: Does this have something to do with that thing with her and Charlie?",
        "Viki: She told you about that?",
        "Rex: She asked me to investigate him and I said no way.",
        "Viki: She asked you to investigate Charlie?",
        "Rex: Well, yeah -- wait, wait. Before you freak out, I don't think it has anything to do with Charlie. I think she's still kind of a mess over the whole Jared thing.",
        "Viki: Well, that's no excuse -- to go behind my back to investigate Charlie?",
        "Rex: I think she's petrified that a skeleton's going to pop out of someone else's closet and bite them in the butt again.",
        "Viki: Huh.",
        "Rex: Yeah, it's a really mixed metaphor --",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Rex: You know what I mean.",
        "Viki: I do know what you mean. Here's your coffee -- nope, it's on me. Happy wedding.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Viki: Uh -- oh. Oh.",
        "[Viki dials]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Charlie: Well, hello.",
        "Viki: Hey, Charlie, how was the interview? Did I catch you in the middle of it?",
        "Charlie: No, I'm still sitting here waiting. It's a good thing I really need this job or else I would've walked out.",
        "Viki: Well, I don't know who you're interviewing with, but I can tell you one thing -- the people over at B.E., they're very good.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, I'll have to take your word for that. So what's up?",
        "Viki: Well, turns out I'm going to be tied up here a little longer than I thought.",
        "Charlie: Well, same here. So, I guess that'll work out just fine -- I tell you what. Why don't I call you as soon as I'm done and then maybe we can meet up tonight for dinner?",
        "Viki: I would like that. Good luck, okay? You know what? I think they can use a few more good people like you over there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Nora, I don't want to get rid of you, but what I do want is to get out of this building and spend some time together.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Clint: So I just have to wrap up a couple of things and then, well, why don't we go get some comfort food at the diner?",
        "Nora: My, you're a big spender.",
        "Clint: Anytime.",
        "Nora: All right.",
        "Clint: So, I'll talk to you in a few minutes.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Clint: You can come out now.",
        "Clint: What is it about this place that turns women into drowned rats?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You, my friend, need to take professional criticism less personally. I'm running a business here. I thought I was pretty clear as to what I wanted. Now, if you can't deliver it, that's not my fault that --",
        "Sarah: Hey, what about this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Rex came by. He said you left this at his place.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. He came all the way over here? I wonder why he just didn't give it to me himself. Huh.",
        "Natalie: He said something came up.",
        "Gigi: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Gigi --",
        "Gigi: Hmm?",
        "Natalie: Are you okay?",
        "Gigi: Me? Yeah, why?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. You're just acting a little nervous.",
        "Gigi: I am?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Maybe something's on your mind?",
        "Gigi: Always, huh -- believe it or not.",
        "Natalie: Like what?",
        "Gigi: I -- I guess what happened in the boardroom.",
        "Natalie: I think we should talk about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Charlie? What -- what are you doing here?",
        "Charlie: Don't worry, no one's around. Anyway, I've got a legitimate reason for being here. I had a job interview in the building.",
        "Jared: With B.E.?",
        "Charlie: Mm-hmm, contractor.",
        "Jared: Well, how'd it go?",
        "Charlie: Quickly.",
        "Jared: Well, I mean, you did save a Buchanan's life. That's got to score a couple points, right?",
        "Charlie: Huh. Well, I'm not really very interested in scoring points with the Buchanans but I got to admit, this place is pretty impressive.",
        "Jared: Yeah, no kidding, huh?",
        "Charlie: Hmm. So everything's still going okay?",
        "Jared: Yeah, yeah. No.",
        "Jared: I nearly got caught on tape admitting that I wasn't really a Buchanan, and -- and Natalie almost heard it.",
        "Charlie: Well --ell, so maybe we shouldn't be talking here?",
        "Jared: No, you know what? It's -- it's fine. The recording got erased, so --",
        "Charlie: Oh. So crisis averted. Shouldn't you feel relieved?",
        "Jared: Yeah, you know -- when I thought the truth was about to come out, in a weird way, that's when I felt relieved.",
