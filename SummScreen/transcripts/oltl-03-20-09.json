        "Stacy is eavesdropping and spying on Roxy as she gathers the DNA from Rex's mysterious biological father and gives it to the lab technician telling him that it's from an anonymous \"John Doe\" whom she wants nobody to know the identity of. She confronts Roxy about knowing her secret and threatens to tell Rex if Roxy does not do what she wants. Gigi and Rex are very worried about Shane. But he tells her he believes in miracles with how they reunited after all these years, randomly in Paris, TX. Alone she prays for a miracle. Stacy appears and tells her sister that her wish has been granted. She is the right candidate for the bone marrow transplant. Marty tells Tea she wants her to represent Cole. She has seen Tea in action and although she hates her guts, she believes an unscrupulous lawyer like Tea is what her son needs to prevent him from going to prison and having his life ruined. Tea asks Marty if she's ready for a fight with Nora after Matthew may be paralyzed for life due to Cole's negligence and if she's willing to sacrifice ever being friends with Nora again. Marty tells Tea her son's future is all she cares about now. John and Officer Fish investigate the stabbings. John asks Marty to observe the evidence with him. She identifies the frat house where she was stabbed. Things don't look good for Todd and his new lawyer is not as good as Tea. Cristian and Layla get locked in the freezer room together and are forced to talk and admit what is going on in their minds."

        "[Layla groans]",
        "Layla: We're stuck in here?",
        "Cristian: There's no handle on the inside.",
        "Layla: What are we supposed to do now?",
        "Cristian: Wait until somebody finds us, I guess.",
        "Layla: Help! Somebody get me out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ah, so the odds makers are picking the Phillies to win the World Series again. You know, if their pitching stays healthy, I think they can do it. What do you think?",
        "Sam: No.",
        "John: Yeah, they could probably use another left-handed bat. We can have hope, though, right? Hey, how's Blair?",
        "Addie: It's looking better.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Addie: The resident said the swelling around her brain had gone down enough so that they could take her off the medicine that put her in the coma in the first place.",
        "John: Thank God.",
        "Addie: But it'll be some time before she comes out of it.",
        "John: Can I see her?",
        "Addie: It's still a little crowded in there. Dorian and Starr and Jack haven't come out yet.",
        "John: Of course, okay.",
        "Addie: Thanks for looking and taking care of Sam.",
        "John: Oh, no problem. He's a -- he's a good kid.",
        "Addie: I know. You've been so good to all of us. I almost hate to ask you for something else.",
        "John: Name it.",
        "Addie: Find the person who did this to my daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're too late, sweetheart. I don't need you anymore.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Get over yourself, Todd. I'm not here for you.",
        "Marty: Actually, she's here for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How is he?",
        "Gigi: Sleeping. He should be out for a while.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Gigi: This is getting to be a regular hangout for you?",
        "Rex: I don't know what else to do.",
        "Gigi: I know. If Shane doesn't get a donor soon... his immune system is wiped out.",
        "Rex: Hey. Did you hear how many people showed up for Viki and Charlie's donor drive? Michael is checking the national registry on the hour. There's got to be somebody out there, right?",
        "Gigi: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Let's not play games, Roxy. I know your dirty little secret.",
        "Roxy: What dirty little secret?",
        "Stacy: I heard you talking to the lab techie about the bone marrow match. It's your anonymous friend, John Doe. Oh, and honey, I know who \"John Doe\" really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm still trying to get the hang of this whole prayer thing. Bo said there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
        "Gigi: You really think that it'll work?",
        "Rex: You don't?",
        "Gigi: I tried it myself last night, and this morning, Michael tells us that Shane needs the transplant, and soon. If he dies --",
        "Rex: He is not going to die. It's not going to happen.",
        "Gigi: It does happen, Rex. There are a lot of kids --",
        "Rex: Not ours. Not ours. Now, we need to stay positive, Morasco.",
        "Gigi: I want to.",
        "Rex: And you are. In front of Shane, anyway.",
        "Gigi: You really believe that it's all going to turn out all right?",
        "Rex: I have to believe that.",
        "Gigi: I used to be strong. When I knew there were answers. When all it took was an inhaler to fix things, I could work overtime and pay for it and put a happy face on. But this -- Rex, I don't -- I don't know how to pretty this up.",
        "Rex: You just don't give up hope.",
        "Gigi: I won't, but... hope alone is not going to do it. We need a real live person to save Shane's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So if you know who John Doe is, then you know it's me.",
        "Stacy: Now, why would Shane's grandma call herself \"John Doe\"?",
        "Roxy: Uh, because I want to be like, uh, that guy who does a lot of good things for people and never takes any credit.",
        "Stacy: Uh-huh. Roxy the philanthropist.",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Don't you think I'm capable of doing good things just like everybody else?",
        "Stacy: Without taking credit for it? No. Nice try, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: It's true, I swear.",
        "Stacy: Listen, you're full of it, okay? I know the truth. I know everything.",
        "Roxy: Everything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I heard Cole was in an accident. Is he all right?",
        "Marty: What did you say to him the night of the accident? I know he went to your house. What did you do to him?",
        "Morgan: Todd, I've got some more forms for you to sign.",
        "T\u00e9a: Let's talk over here.",
        "Marty: Please.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're the last person I ever thought I'd hear from.",
        "Marty: The last person I ever wanted to call was Todd's lawyer.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd's former lawyer.",
        "Marty: Defending a guilty man get old?",
        "T\u00e9a: It was time to put some distance between Todd and me.",
        "Marty: I wish I'd been able to do that before. But, then again, you know what happened. You made me say it all on the stand.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: What is this about, Marty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Morgan: As soon as they sign your release papers, you are a free man.",
        "Todd: Good. Then we can concentrate on getting me custody of my kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Addie, I'm not a cop anymore.",
        "Addie: I know. You always seem so strong and in charge. That's why I liked the idea of Blair and you. You saw her through everything Todd did to Starr and her boyfriend. You're still here.",
        "John: I'll do whatever I can for Blair.",
        "Addie: Then go home.",
        "John: Home?",
        "Addie: Blair is going to want to see you when she comes out of this coma, and -- I don't know how to break this to you...you really need a shower.",
        "John: I stink.",
        "[Addie laughs]",
        "John: It's not good, is it? Okay, you're right. I got it.",
        "Addie: I'll call -- I'll call you the second she comes out of it, or if there's any change at all.",
        "John: All right. Well, you know what? I'm going to be right back.",
        "Addie: I wouldn't expect anything less.",
        "John: See you, bud.",
        "John: Hey, Fish.",
        "Oliver: Lieutenant -- I mean, John. I'm really sorry to hear about Blair Cramer. How's she doing?",
        "John: Well, it's looking better. Thanks for asking.",
        "Oliver: You like anybody for this?",
        "John: I was just saying to someone, I'm not a cop anymore.",
        "Oliver: That hasn't really stopped you before.",
        "John: It's a good point. All right, I'm taking a look at it, but keep it quiet.",
        "Oliver: Don't I always?",
        "John: You headed to work?",
        "Oliver: No. I am trading in this uniform for my old one at the LPD.",
        "John: No kidding. They hired you back?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Detective Vega's on special assignment. They're short staffed, so they put me back on duty -- temporarily, at least.",
        "John: Good. That's real good.",
        "Oliver: Should I be getting worried about that look in your eye?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Help! Is somebody out there?",
        "Cristian: This thing's like a vault. No one can hear you.",
        "Layla: Okay. Got it.",
        "Cristian: And that's not going to work either.",
        "Layla: This is your fault.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, right, my fault.",
        "Layla: You walked away from me when I was trying to talk to you.",
        "Cristian: I'm not the idiot that slammed the door shut.",
        "Layla: How are we going to get out of here?",
        "Cristian: Layla, just chill, all right?",
        "Layla: That's not even remotely funny.",
        "Cristian: One of the waitresses knew I was coming in here to find something. I'm sure she'll figure out I haven't come back.",
        "[Layla sighs]",
        "Cristian: Eventually.",
        "Layla: Eventually? I'll freeze to death in here.",
        "Cristian: Really? You could get colder?",
        "Layla: I guess I'll have to die a mean old bitch who sprays men-repellent everywhere I go. Isn't that what you think I am?",
        "Cristian: I never said \"old.\"",
        "Layla: For your information, Oliver Fish assured me that I am a fine person.",
        "Cristian: Well, what else is he going to say? Isn't he the last guy that dumped you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Look, I -- I hate to get you in any hot water on your first day back, Fish.",
        "Oliver: Just tell me what you want me to do.",
        "John: I need to get a look at the evidence taken from the Lee Halpern murder scene.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: We need to get on this while Blair is still in a coma.",
        "Morgan: I got it.",
        "Todd: You know, I'm not saying she's not a good mother. It's --",
        "Morgan: But she's unable to care for the children now. I get it.",
        "Todd: And I don't want Dorian Lord raising my kids.",
        "Morgan: Look, you've still got some hoops to jump through, Todd. It's not going to be easy.",
        "Todd: All right. You know what, Morgan? If you're not the man for this job, I can find someone --",
        "Morgan: Now, look, Todd, calm down. I already got things rolling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: John, I can't remove evidence from the evidence room. If it was anything else --",
        "John: I understand. All I need is the list of everything that was found at the scene.",
        "Oliver: What are you looking for?",
        "John: Anything that connects Halpern to Granger and then Blair's stabbing.",
        "Oliver: What, you think there's, like, a serial stabber?",
        "John: I don't know yet. I need to look at the list.",
        "Oliver: I'm assuming that you've already linked Granger with Ms. Cramer? You know what? The less I know, the better.",
        "John: Come on, Fish. Can you help me out here?",
        "Oliver: It would be a lot easier if I knew what I was looking for.",
        "John: If I get a look at the list, I'll know what I'm looking for.",
        "Oliver: Can you at least tell me why?",
        "John: I think the killer is leaving us a message.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: First, let me make myself clear. I think you're vicious, heartless, and unscrupulous, and you don't give a damn about right or wrong.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't hold back. Tell me what you really feel --",
        "Marty: But I need your help. I want to hire you to represent my son, Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I can't stand waiting. I want to do something. Praying doesn't feel like doing something.",
        "Rex: Didn't you used to go to church back in Michigan?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, every Sunday. I used to believe in faith and hope, charity. Then I got pregnant, and you left before I could tell you, and my father kicked me to the curb, so that kind of felt like God turned his back on me and Shane. And if we were going to get by, it had to be up to us.",
        "Rex: I get that. I never even went to church, but recently in this past year, I'm starting to believe in miracles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: What is this \"everything\" that you think you know?",
        "Stacy: Well, let's see. You know, I could jerk you around or I could tell you that I know John Doe is the patient in room 302 at the Boulez long-term care facility.",
        "Roxy: Boulet -- Boulet -- I don't know no place like that.",
        "Stacy: Hmm. Yeah, you do. It's the place you keep sneaking off to.",
        "Roxy: And just how would you know this?",
        "Stacy: I followed you, actually into the room. I hid behind the curtain. I heard you babbling about how you lied to Rex about his father being dead, and how \"our grandson's in trouble.\" And then you did the swab for the bone marrow test.",
        "Roxy: That's funny. I didn't see you there.",
        "Stacy: Well, yeah, that was kind of the point, you know? I sort of hid when you left. And I was curious who this mysterious person was, so I got a good look of \"John Doe\" for myself.",
        "Roxy: So then you know?",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, Roxy, I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Fish assured me that I am not the ice princess from hell that you seem to think I am.",
        "Cristian: So why'd he dump you?",
        "Layla: He fell under the spell of some trashy blonde, and I know he regretted the way he treated me.",
        "[Cristian laughs]",
        "Layla: What's so funny?",
        "Cristian: You really think he's going to tell you to your face that you're the kind of woman every guy runs screaming from?",
        "Layla: Why not? You did. I'm freezing in here.",
        "Cristian: That's why they call it a freezer. Fish was just being nice.",
        "[Layla laughs]",
        "Layla: What do you know about being nice? Especially after the way you treated Sarah? And I can't believe you went to Evangeline's bedside for absolution.",
        "Cristian: Let me ask you something. If you hate me so much, then why do you care what I think about you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: \"John, we may be over, but the memories won't die. Didn't want you to worry I'd blackmail you with it.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Morgan: This restraining order against you expired.",
        "Todd: It did?",
        "Morgan: Well, somebody needed to renew it, go to court to get permission to, and your ex is out of commission. Nobody acted in her stead.",
        "Todd: Does that mean I can see my kids?",
        "Morgan: Nobody can stop you, but... I'd hold off if I were you.",
        "Todd: Oh. Now, why would I do that?",
        "Morgan: So Blair's family doesn't try to renew the order of protection before we get you custody. The element of surprise is a very effective weapon in cases like this.",
        "Todd: How long before I can spring the surprise?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I'm sure you heard what happened with Cole.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know he's being held on a dui and reckless endangerment, and that Nora bumped the charges from a misdemeanor to a felony --",
        "Marty: Because her son, Matthew, was a passenger in Cole's car and is now paralyzed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, boy.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Cole's 18 now, and we just heard that he would be -- he'd be tried as an adult, which means he could spend years in prison if convicted. And he's already been through so much. He just got accepted to college. Things were starting to look up for him, and then... He made a mistake. He made a terrible mistake.",
        "T\u00e9a: Marty, there are a lot of other lawyers in town. Why me?",
        "Marty: Because anyone who can get Todd Manning off scot-free for what he did to me and what he tried to do to his daughter and his grandchild -- that's who I need for Cole.",
        "T\u00e9a: Vicious, heartless, unscrupulous person that I am.",
        "Marty: I can put that aside, because whatever it takes, I'll do it to save my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: We can't just hope for a miracle, and poof! Shane's all better. I'm a realist, Balsom. I've had to be.",
        "Rex: I know --",
        "Gigi: We just have to look harder for a donor, and we should look for another oncologist, too. I read online about people who have their own bone marrow harvested. It could be dangerous, but if it could save Shane's life --",
        "Rex: We'll do anything, even pray for a miracle.",
        "Gigi: But --",
        "Rex: I'm not talking about hocus-pocus miracles. I just know stuff happens and they make other things happen. Like us.",
        "Gigi: You saying we're a miracle?",
        "Rex: What were the odds of me walking into a diner in Texas, looking for somebody that we both knew, and you just happened to be working there that hour? Marcie could've picked any place on earth, but she chose Paris, Texas. We could've just missed each other. Your shift could've been over. It could've been a weekend. But that didn't happen, Morasco. The stars were lined up, and I have to believe that that was for a reason, and that reason is our son.",
        "Gigi: So, what, we're supposed to just... Leave it all in the hands of fate? Or God?",
        "Rex: No. We'll do everything humanly possible. But we have to believe that Shane is going to beat this. We have to believe, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: I'm scared, Rex.",
        "Rex: Me, too. I'm scared as hell.",
        "Gigi: But you're right. God wouldn't just take him away, would he? I can't believe that.",
        "Rex: There's no other way to believe.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: And if that isn't faith, I don't know what is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: John Doe didn't look so scary just lying there totally out of it.",
        "Roxy: Well, you don't know the whole story.",
        "Stacy: You're right, I didn't, which is why I looked up John's real name on the internet.",
        "Roxy: Why -- why would you do that?",
        "Stacy: Oh, isn't it obvious? Oh, you tried so hard trying to keep a lid on it.",
        "Roxy: I had a damn good reason.",
        "Stacy: You can say that again. Old Johnny had some history. I could see why you wouldn't want Rex knowing he was related.",
        "Roxy: Okay, Stacy. So now you know why I want to keep it zipped about \"who Rex's daddy is\" thing.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I know why you don't want to tell him, but there's no reason why I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I wish I could be more like you.",
        "Rex: Bald?",
        "Gigi: Buy into this whole faith thing. I want to. I want a miracle. I want to be able to go back to Shane's room and find him a full head of hair and a body that's free of cancer. But I know that's not going to happen.",
        "Rex: But a donor could pop up at any time --",
        "Gigi: I hate depending on people! It's always just been Shane and me. Why does he need a donor in the first place? If there's a God, why did he give leukemia to a good kid like Shane, huh? Why would he put him through that? And then just make it go away if we pray?",
        "Rex: I don't know. I'm still new at this myself. I just -- I know stuff happens, stuff that we can't control. But we can control how we deal with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Why would you want to tell Rex what you know? Why would you be so mean?",
        "Stacy: You started it, Roxy. You were on my case since the first time we met. You shouldn't have called me a stripper. You shouldn't have got in my way.",
        "Roxy: In your way? Not exactly. I was right. You're after your sister's guy.",
        "Stacy: I've loved Rex since before Gigi even saw him.",
        "Roxy: You wanted to get rid of me. You said that Rex needed space after I told him about his father. He never said that, did he? He never said anything about his father, about needing space. He never said squat, did he?",
        "Stacy: You know, I always happen to be in the right place at the right time. Just like at the clinic.",
        "Roxy: \"Happen,\" my ass. You set me up. You followed me. I ought to crack your --",
        "Stacy: Don't even think about it, Roxy!",
        "Roxy: Oh!",
        "Stacy: I'm tougher than you, and a hell of a lot younger. Oh, and meaner, too.",
        "Roxy: Listen, you can't tell him that you saw me at the facility. You want to hurt me? Fine. You want to hurt me? Okay, go ahead, take your best shot, but Rex cannot find out. It'll kill him to know that monster's blood is running through his veins.",
        "Stacy: You know, it's interesting, this whole maternal thing, coming from the woman who dumped him on his aunt, who wasn't even his aunt, and you knew it.",
        "Roxy: I had to save Rex from that creep. You don't know how many people will get hurt if they find out.",
        "Stacy: Well, you know what? They're going to find out sooner or later. John Doe's a match for Shane, so you're going to have to tell someone unless you want your grandson to die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I wish it was me.",
        "Rex: Gigi --",
        "Gigi: I do. If I was the one who had leukemia, I could -- I could deal with the chemo, being sick... the pain.",
        "Rex: I know.",
        "Gigi: If the worst happened, I'd know that Shane wouldn't be alone. He'd have you. I can handle that so much better than this.",
        "Rex: We're all stuck with it.",
        "[Gigi sobs]",

        "Gigi: I need you, too.",
        "Rex: We can do this. We are a miracle, and as long as we're together, we can make miracles happen.",

        "Todd: That's good. My kids need me right now. They've been without parents since Blair got stabbed.",
        "Morgan: Well, that's why I moved for a prompt court date. Our best shot, Todd, is an end run. Just settle this before anyone contesting the case even has a chance to act. What, you got a problem with that?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, it's fine.",
        "Morgan: What's with the look?",
        "Todd: It's just -- can't help but wonder what my old lawyer would do.",

        "T\u00e9a: This is a first -- being trashed and hired in the same breath.",

        "John: Hey, come on in.",
        "Oliver: Here you go.",
        "John: I didn't ask you to lift anything for me.",
        "Oliver: No, I didn't. I photographed all the evidence that you wanted from the Halpern case with my cell phone, and then I printed it up from my own computer at home during lunch.",
        "John: You didn't. Fish, I owe you.",
        "Oliver: Hey, it's all in the name of justice, right? Anyway, I got to get back to the P.D. I don't want to be late from lunch on my first day back.",
        "John: Of course, come on.",
        "Oliver: Hey, John, I hope you find what you're looking for.",

        "Marty: So you'll take the case?",
        "T\u00e9a: If I do, I'd have to pull out the heavy artillery in order to win it.",
        "Marty: I know.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're okay with that, hurting your friend, Cole's guardian?",
        "Marty: I know. But my son is downstairs in a jail cell, and I can't let him go to prison.",
        "T\u00e9a: You got yourself a lawyer.",

        "Cristian: It's busy out there. She's probably working her ass off.",
        "Layla: And you know what? I don't care what you think about me. Because I know that I'm not mean or cold, but I really am freezing. And I don't know how much more of this I can take, which is great news for you, because you'll be done with the entire Williamson family after that.",
        "Cristian: Here, take this. Take it.",
        "Layla: Thank you.",
        "Cristian: Anything to keep you from complaining.",
        "Cristian: You know, I wasn't looking for forgiveness when I went to see Evangeline. I just thought... She knew me, better than anybody. And she'd have a better take with everything that's going on.",
        "Layla: She hasn't had a take on anything in a long time. And what went down was you dumped a great girl for a conniving slut. And now you're just as lonely as I am, which you deserve.",
        "Cristian: You really think I'm the lowest scum on earth, don't you?",
        "Layla: Why do you care what I think of you?",

        "John: Come on in.",

        "John: Better. She isn't out of the woods yet, but everyone's very hopeful.",
        "Marty: Good, that's good.",
        "John: Cole?",
        "Marty: Well, he spent the night in jail. He's probably dealing with withdrawal from those pills.",
        "John: You need help getting him a lawyer or anything?",
        "Marty: No, no, I figured that out already.",
        "John: How you holding up during all this?",
        "Marty: I'm fine. Why'd you call me here? You said it was important.",
        "John: Yeah. You were pretty close with Lee Halpern, right?",
        "Marty: For a while, I guess.",
        "John: I wanted to ask you a question about her. You know, when they found her body, she was wearing earrings, but not just a matching pair. She was wearing a third one. I was -- I was just wondering if that was something you remember her doing a lot.",
        "Marty: No, not that I remember.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "John: Take a look at something.",
        "Marty: K for Ketring?",
        "John: Yeah, I thought about that. But you see, you look a little closer, see this third hole?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: Looks kind of raw, like it'd just been pierced maybe. I don't know too much about that, but what do you think?",
        "Marty: Well -- I don't know. No, I don't remember that at all. It wasn't really her style.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Marty: What do you think this is about?",
        "John: You're probably better off not knowing --",
        "Marty: Uh, no, no, no. That woman helped Todd keep me captive, and you called me here about something, and I want to know what's going on.",

        "Roxy: I'm not going to let my grandson die. What kind of person do you think I am? Wait, don't answer that. I know what I got to do. I got to suck it up, and I got to tell Rex.",
        "Stacy: Are you sure you really want to do that?",
        "Roxy: No, I don't want to do that.",
        "[Stacy chuckles]",
        "Stacy: You were a mess last time I told you Rex didn't want to see you after the last lie you told him about his dad. Can you imagine how he'll react when you tell him the real deal? He will hate you, Roxy, for the rest of his life.",
        "Roxy: Well, if I don't tell him, then you're going to tell him, and I can't let that happen. So I got to tell him, because maybe I could put a spin on it and get him on my side.",
        "Stacy: Oh, is that right?",
        "Roxy: No, it's not right at all. I don't want to do that. I'm going to lose my kid!",
        "Stacy: Just relax, okay? I won't tell him.",
        "Roxy: You won't?",
        "Stacy: You won't, either.",

        "Cristian: If you're thinking we're going to get naked --",
        "Layla: Oh, please. Get your mind out of your pants for once. Gosh. This will at least keep our hands warm.",

        "Marty: The letter D?",
        "John: Yeah. This letter \"A\" was added to the tattoo on Wes' arm. The killer put it there after he stabbed him. Now the letter K. I'm thinking that the same person did all three, and this is his signature.",

        "Marty: Not the order they were attacked.",
        "John: The order they were found in, but the order they were attacked would be k-a-d, which is not the beginning of any word I can think of.",

No, no, not me. Shane. Please. He's just a little boy. The worst thing he ever did in his whole life was swipe a candy bar from the drugstore. I made him go back and pay for it out of his allowance. I know that you can't -- you can't save everybody. And I know that you can't answer every mother's prayers. But I'm just asking you if you will please save Shane's life. I'll do anything.
