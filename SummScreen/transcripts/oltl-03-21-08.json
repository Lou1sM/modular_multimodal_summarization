        "Layla: Did you guys finally set a date?",
        "Adriana: Are you free May 9?",
        "Layla: Really?",

        "Marcie: What the heck is this? Please do not tell me you got fired from B.E. already.",
        "Gigi: No! Viki and I are just helping Carlotta out.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Huh.",
        "Gigi: Where's Shane?",
        "Marcie: Oh, he's sleeping. Michael's with him.",
        "Gigi: I hate to keep imposing. Michael will call me as soon as he wakes up, right?",
        "Marcie: Definitely, definitely. So come on -- tell me, how is the big second day on the job?",
        "Gigi: Oh, you know -- made copies, answered emails, faxed a bunch of stuff, spilled coffee, kissed the boss.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Marcie: All in a day's work, I guess. Oh, you're not kidding. Oh, my God, you're not kidding? You kissed Clint Buchanan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So, times must be tough at \"The Banner.\"",
        "Viki: Oh, yes, had to sell it -- what a shame, huh? But fortunately, Carlotta gave me a job. And now, I've got these two great tippers at my table -- lucky girl am I! Mr. Mayor, a menu?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You don't get it, do you? It wasn't an accident.",
        "Charlie: What? No -- look, your mother told me that --",
        "Jared: Oh, Mom -- Mom was scared to death, because you walked out on her and someone else took your place. And then she did and said whatever he told her to.",
        "Charlie: Okay, so you're telling me that she lied?",
        "Jared: She had to! He beat her! He beat all of us.",
        "Charlie: Oh, my God. Look, I didn't know.",
        "Jared: You didn't care. All you cared about was where your next bottle was coming from.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Starr, get down here!",
        "Todd: Yeah, I thought I told you and McBain to keep Cole away from my daughter.",
        "Nora: Hello to you, too, Todd.",
        "Todd: If you can't control your ward of the court, I will.",
        "Nora: And if you can't control your compulsion to threaten me, I'll sue. What do you want?",
        "Todd: Starr was at Marcie McBain's today probably arranging a meeting with Cole. Right?",
        "Nora: I don't know. You should ask Starr -- and spare me any more of your paranoid rants.",
        "Todd: If Cole so much as I.M.s Starr --",
        "Nora: Goodbye, Todd.",
        "Blair: Was that you yelling?",
        "Todd: Starr, get your butt down here!",
        "Blair: What is wrong?",
        "Todd: Well, first, I found Ramsey at the penthouse.",
        "Blair: Yeah?",
        "Todd: He's purchased it. Secondly, I found out Starr was at Marcie McBain's along with John McBain.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Yeah, and I know exactly what they were up to.",
        "Starr: You don't know anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You know, there's not much point in going to group if you're not going to say anything.",
        "Cole: What's the point?",
        "Langston: Cole, you need to talk. I mean, maybe it'd be easier if I wasn't there.",
        "Cole: Now, listen, all of us at group -- we have one horrible thing in common, right? Now, Starr and I -- we have a totally different horrible thing in common, so Starr's the only one I want to talk to about this. And even if she wanted to see me, I can't.",
        "Markko: Yeah, you can. I know how to make it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Two months isn't enough time to plan.",
        "Adriana: Actually, we were planning to elope, but then Rex talked me into May.",
        "Rex: So she can have the wedding of her dreams.",
        "Adriana: So we can have the wedding of our dreams.",
        "Layla: Which is totally doable in two months.",
        "Adriana: Which is why we should be talking dresses ASAP.",
        "Layla: Yes.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Layla: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Rex: All right, I know you guys have work to do and I really should get some of this stuff done.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: I'll get out of your hair.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm. I'll call you when we're finished.",
        "Rex: Great. Love you.",
        "Adriana: Love you, too. Bye.",
        "Layla: Why were you in such a hurry to get rid of him? Do you have to show me your wedding dress pictures or something?",
        "Adriana: No. I want to talk about Gigi Morasco.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I did not kiss Clint Buchanan.",
        "Marcie: Bo?",
        "Gigi: No!",
        "Marcie: Natalie?",
        "Gigi: It was Jared, okay?",
        "Marcie: Ah, Jared? The new Buchanan -- look at you!",
        "Gigi: Well, he's not exactly a new Buchanan, he just didn't know he was one until recently.",
        "Marcie: And?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and we said we'd forget it, keep it to ourselves. Me and my big mouth.",
        "Marcie: Well, I'm not going to tell anybody. I mean, obviously, it wasn't forgettable.",
        "Gigi: It didn't mean anything. I was just upset and he was there, and -- I barely even know him.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm, and you'd like to get to know him better, wouldn't you?",
        "Gigi: He's my boss, Marcie!",
        "Marcie: And?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I must say, Viki, you really zip those zingers out almost as well as you sling the old hash.",
        "Viki: Now, how do you think Carlotta would feel if she knew that you were demeaning her very honorable profession?",
        "Mayor Lowell: I -- I don't think Dr. Lord intended that. Did you?",
        "Dorian: Of course not. But do seem to have hit a sore spot.",
        "Viki: Oh, no, Dorian, you'd have to dig a lot deeper than that. So, you going to eat or gloat? Because I have customers.",
        "Mayor Lowell: I'll have the special.",
        "Viki: Good.",
        "Dorian: Just some black coffee for me. Thank you.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You are hardly one to frequent diners, Dorian. If you moved our meeting from The Palace to this joint with the intent of humiliating Viki, I'd say it backfired, wouldn't you?",
        "Charlie: If you really want to hurt Viki so badly, why don't you just get it over with? Just tell her what Jared and I have done to her family.",
        "Dorian: No, Viki's right. There are lots worse things than waitressing -- much worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd, come on. You think our daughter's going to set up a little secret rendezvous with Cole with --",
        "Todd: I'm asking her the question.",
        "Blair: John and Marcie there?",
        "Todd: I promised you, if you didn't stay away from him, I was going to send him to jail. Well, I'm making good on my promise right now.",
        "Starr: Dad, don't! You can't!",
        "Blair: Okay, stop, you two. Stop. Starr, you want to explain what you were doing over there at Marcie's? And I know that you like Mrs. McBain. She was one of your favorite teachers and you baby-sat for her, but can you just tell us what was going on?",
        "Todd: All right, I'm calling the cops.",
        "Starr: Dad, don't. Dad, please, stop it! I'll tell you the truth, okay? You want to hear it? I didn't go over to Mrs. McBain's for Cole, all right? I went there because of Sam.",
        "Todd: Sam?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I wanted her to take him away from you because Marcie should raise Sam, not you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: So, I come home from Paris to surprise Rex, and guess who I find here.",
        "Layla: Gigi?",
        "Adriana: None other.",
        "Layla: Well, maybe they were just --",
        "Adriana: Working? Yeah, that's what Rex said and I believe him.",
        "Layla: Then what's the problem?",
        "Adriana: When I walked in, Gigi was crying and telling Rex that she was so sorry.",
        "Layla: For what?",
        "Adriana: You got me. Rex had his headphones on. He was completely oblivious to the whole thing.",
        "Layla: Well, did you talk to Rex about it?",
        "Adriana: No, because then my mother showed up.",
        "Layla: And then I showed up.",
        "Adriana: And I don't want to sound like a jealous fianc\u00e9e. I know. I am one.",
        "Layla: Not that you have any reason to be. But you need to find out what in the world is Gigi so sorry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I hear Charlie was at B.E. today.",
        "Viki: Yeah, he was interviewing for the contracting job. You didn't pull any strings for that, did you?",
        "Clint: He got that interview on his own merits. I mean, if he wasn't qualified, he wouldn't even have gotten in the door.",
        "Viki: Good. And I'm sure that it will go very well because Charlie has a way with people. I'll be right back with your refill.",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Mayor Lowell: I assume you wanted to meet with me for some reason other than to watch Viki Davidson wait tables.",
        "Dorian: I need to find out why our project has stalled.",
        "Mayor Lowell: It's not, at all. Attempt number two is in progress as we speak.",
        "Dorian: What happened the first time?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Factors beyond my control.",
        "Dorian: You know, I invested a great deal of money in this endeavor under the premise that you were completely in control.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Perhaps if you could tell me what it is you hope to gain in the end --",
        "Dorian: You don't need to know. You just need to get results.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay, you're right. I was a drunk, and alcohol was all that I -- I thought about but I swear to God, if I had any idea that this was happening, that that's what he was doing to you and Jimmy --",
        "Jared: Just stop. Stop it.",
        "Charlie: No -- what I'm saying is that it was me, Jared. I'm to blame. It's not your fault what happened to Jimmy!",
        "Jared: Stop! Please.",
        "Charlie: You -- you were just a kid, and you were a good kid and you didn't do anything wrong!",
        "Jared: Yes, I did! I did everything wrong. I was his big brother. I should've protected him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So how are we going to break Starr out?",
        "Markko: We're not. We're going to bring Cole to her, tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: We know that you don't think Sam belongs over at the McBains'.",
        "Starr: Uh -- yes, I do. It's bad enough you wrecked my life. You're not going to do it to my little brother.",
        "Todd: All right, what'd you say to Marcie?",
        "Starr: I told her the truth. I said that would be miserable growing up here, that you hurt people, and that Marcie's the only one who can save him.",
        "Blair: Okay, and you just happened to say this all when John McBain was there? You had to tell Marcie that?",
        "Starr: Well, Mrs. McBain got upset and then she called him, after I told her --",
        "Blair: After what? After --",
        "Starr: Look, I mean, she just started to ask me a lot of questions and --",
        "Todd: What exactly did you tell her, Starr?",
        "Starr: Marcie asked me if you hit Sam, and I said yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: You know, maybe -- maybe it was nothing. Maybe she was just crying because -- she felt sad.",
        "Layla: Hmm. Yeah, right.",
        "Adriana: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Look, why don't you go talk to her, just get it out in the open?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, like when I asked her about Shane and she was so wonderfully honest and straightforward?",
        "Layla: You don't still think Gigi might be lying about Shane being Rex's son?",
        "Adriana: No. Look, even if Rex isn't Shane's father, Gigi seems more than happy to let him get really, really close to the kid -- you know, buying him gifts and playing stupid video games, and -- ugh. Tell me I'm crazy, that I'm being a nervous bride.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Adriana: Oh. Jean-Pierre. Now what? Well, what fitting? No, look -- look, my partner Layla can be there. Okay, look, we've got it covered. Stop worrying. Goodbye.",
        "Layla: What, he doesn't want me to come in your place?",
        "Adriana: No, it's not that. I -- I don't understand how everything suddenly got moved up -- to May! I mean, it's like he's deliberately trying to ruin my wedding.",
        "Layla: He doesn't even know about your wedding, does he? It's not even like you sent out the save-the-dates for May 9.",
        "Adriana: No, I -- I didn't tell anyone but my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: There you go, big spender -- black coffee. And, Mr. Mayor, for you, ropa vieja.",
        "Dorian: You do realize that means \"old clothes\"?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Yeah. It may not sound appetizing, but it smells delicioso.",
        "Gigi: Here, Viki, this tip's for you.",
        "Viki: Oh, thanks, Geege.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Oh, hey, Gigi. Do you think I should order Shane's ice cream now? Because I -- I think he's probably going to wake up soon.",
        "Gigi: Well, you said Michael would call when he does.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, that's true.",
        "Rex: Shane's asleep, this early?",
        "Marcie: Oh, he's sick, he's sick.",
        "Rex: Asthma again?",
        "Gigi: Rex, he has a cold.",
        "Rex: Okay.",
        "Marcie: He's -- he's doing much better. You know, he's a sweetheart. I mean, he hardly ever complains.",
        "Rex: Great kid.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. You -- I think the feelings are mutual because all he ever does is talk about you, actually. \"Rex this, Rex that --\" it's kind of like you hung the moon or something. I really don't get it.",
        "Gigi: I'm going to see if Viki needs my help.",
        "Rex: Gigi, how's -- how's the new job going? How was work today?",
        "Gigi: Fine, great. Everyone's been really great.",
        "Rex: Yeah. They're all being really friendly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Markko, I already tried that, remember? I didn't get to see Starr and almost got caught.",
        "Markko: No, listen. Starr's dad won't be home tonight. There's this fundraiser over at the Love Center that's sponsored by \"The Sun.\" Mr. and Mrs. Manning have to go, right, Lang?",
        "Langston: Yeah, but the guards, they'll still be there.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Markko: No, but I figured out they patrol in, like --",
        "Cole: Hello?",
        "Nora: Hey, Cole, how was your session?",
        "Cole: It was fine.",
        "Nora: Wonderful. Listen, I need to talk to you. Could you come down to the diner now?",
        "Cole: Now's not a good time.",
        "Nora: Too bad.",
        "Cole: Can't we talk tomorrow?",
        "Nora: I'm sorry, Cole. I'm playing the guardian card here. It's really important.",
        "Cole: All right, fine, fine. I'll -- I'll meet you there. I got to go. I have to meet Nora at the diner.",
        "Markko: Okay, we'll be here.",
        "Cole: All right.",
        "Langston: It's so great of you to do this.",
        "Markko: I just hope it works. Hey, listen, Langston, promise me you'll be really careful, okay?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I promise.",
        "Markko: This plan won't work without you, but I'd never forgive myself if Todd found out and something happened to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, you know that I would actually never hurt one of my kids. So --",
        "Starr: You hit Cole.",
        "Todd: Because of what he did to you.",
        "Starr: All he did was love me, but you obviously don't know what love is or else you wouldn't be hurting me like this.",
        "Blair: Okay, okay. Starr, we know you're upset. But you also know that your father has never hit Sam and you lied -- to a police officer!",
        "Starr: It's what my father would do!",
        "Blair: Starr!",
        "Starr: But you know what? I'm not like you, so I ended up telling them the truth.",
        "Blair: Oh, thank God!",
        "Starr: Poor Mrs. McBain. She was the last person that I wanted to hurt.",
        "Todd: Starr --",
        "Blair: Okay -- Todd --",
        "[Starr walks away]",
        "Blair: I know that you want to protect her and so do I, but I don't think this is -- this is a good way of doing it.",
        "Todd: I could've kept them apart if I had gotten the penthouse back --",
        "Blair: Are we back to that?",
        "Todd: Everywhere I turn, that son of a bitch Ramsey's in my face.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Todd: I'm not going to sit around and take it anymore. You know that \"new Todd,\" \"new and improved Todd\" that never makes waves? He's history.",
        "Blair: I think he's been history a long time.",
        "Todd: Not happy about that, eh?",
        "Blair: If we're going to make this marriage work, I don't want that old Todd back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: How the hell were you supposed to protect him? Now, look, your mother called me that day and she told me that he just -- he just ran out into the middle of the street in front of that truck.",
        "Jared: Yeah, and she just never told you why?",
        "Charlie: Well -- well, she said you boys were just playing in the front yard.",
        "Jared: Yeah. We were in the yard. We were in the yard to get away from him because he was inside screaming at Mom and Jimmy begged me to make it stop. But I couldn't. I didn't know what to do. So I -- I just hung on to him and I talked to him about baseball -- baseball -- or anything I could to drown out the yelling. And then the doors swung open and there he was screaming at us -- at me and Jimmy. \"Get in the house!\" We knew we were getting hit! And I could take it. I was fine. But I looked at him and -- and I could tell it was too much. He could not go back in that house. He was terrified. So I -- I just hung on to him. I hung on to him, Dad. But I couldn't, and he just --",
        "Jared: He ran into the street.",
        "Charlie: Oh, my God.",
        "Jared: Yeah. I should've hung on to him.",
        "Charlie: Well, Jared, you were 9 years old.",
        "Jared: I was his big brother! I should've protected him!",
        "Charlie: I was your father. I should've protected you both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Okay, so what's going on?",
        "Nora: I just got a call from Todd tonight.",
        "Cole: About me?",
        "Nora: You didn't try and see Starr tonight, did you, at the McBains'?",
        "Cole: No, why? Did somebody say I did?",
        "Nora: Well, Todd, as you well know, is paranoid and dangerous so I think for your safety as well as for Starr's, you should continue to steer clear.",
        "Cole: I understand.",
        "Nora: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Clint: Cole? I'd like to talk to you for a minute because Nora tells me that you're interested in engineering.",
        "Cole: Yeah, maybe. I think I -- oh -- oh, well -- I'm sorry, yes. I would, yes.",
        "Clint: Okay, that's a yes. Um, well, at B.E., we have an internship program and it could be turned into a work-study thing which pays a bit more than minimum wage throughout the summer. Now, if you're interested in that kind of thing, tomorrow morning just apply at Human Resources.",
        "Cole: Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Is that it?",
        "Nora: Well, yes, that's it -- for now, yes. You can go back to doing whatever it was that you were doing and don't forget your curfew.",
        "Cole: I won't.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Cole: Bye.",
        "Nora: Good night.",
        "Nora: You don't have an internship at B.E., do you?",
        "Clint: I just thought Cole could use something to think about other than Starr.",
        "Nora: God bless you.",

        "Langston: Right, and Dorian just called me to let me know she's going to be at Adriana's making wedding plans, so that should take half the night. You two should be able to have some good quality time alone.",
