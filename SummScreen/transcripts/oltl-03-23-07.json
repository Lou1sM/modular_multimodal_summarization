        "Antonio: What is it?",
        "Talia: I'm not sure. It looks like some sort of military medal. You think it's Matthew's? Bo's?",
        "Antonio: I don't know. Describe it. I can't see it very well from here.",
        "Talia: I don't -- there's some sort of an inscription on it.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, what does it say?",
        "Talia: I'm not sure. Ugh!",
        "Antonio: Talia, talk to me. What's going on? Talia? Talia, what's going on in there? Talk to me.",
        "Antonio: What's going on? Officer Sahid, report. Damn it, Talia, talk to me.",

        "Nurse: Thank you, Dr. McBain.",
        "Marcie: Hey.",
        "Michael: Marcie? Where's Tommy? Is he -- is he ok?",
        "Marcie: He's fine. He's fine. He's with Lindsay. I think she just needed a Tommy fix. I think she's been missing Jen.",
        "Michael: Oh. So, you get a little time to yourself and you decide to come down to the ER and hang out?",
        "Marcie: I'm worried about you. You know, I think you might have come back to work too soon, Michael, after what happened at Roxy's.",
        "Michael: Marcie, I'm fine. Dr. Milbauer checked me out. I have no concussion. I'm good to go. And I'm telling you, Marcie, if I see those guys --",
        "Marcie: Michael, will you please -- please just let the police handle it, ok? I mean, when I think about how much worse it could have been, I just start freaking out and --",
        "Michael: No, don't worry, ok? I got a thick skull. I can take a lot.",
        "Marcie: That's not funny.",
        "Michael: It's a little funny.",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Michael: I'm sorry, ok? The point is, I'm fine, truly.",
        "Marcie: You know, it could have been a lot worse. It could have totally gone the other way, Michael. What if something happened to you? What if something happened to me?",
        "Michael: Well, it didn't.",
        "Marcie: But what if it did? Then what happens to Tommy?",
        "Michael: Marcie, nothing is going to happen to us. But -- but if it did -- which -- which it won't -- Rex and Natalie will take care good care of Tommy, ok? That's why we picked them to be the Godparents.",
        "Marcie: No, I know that. But what if something happens to us before we tell Tommy that he's adopted? What do we do then?",
        "Michael: Do we really have to talk about this?",
        "Marcie: Yes, yes, we have to talk about this, Michael, because I cannot think of anything else, ok? It's driving me crazy.",
        "Michael: Well, I'm really sorry, but I -- I can't do anything about it right now, Marcie. I'm in the middle of a --",
        "Marcie: I wrote a letter. I wrote a letter. It explains everything.",
        "Michael: You really think this is necessary?",
        "Marcie: Heave questions, Michael, about his biological mother and father, and this letter explains everything.",
        "Michael: Rip it up. Do it now. Rip it up, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: No! I am not going to rip this letter up, Michael. I want to know why you freak out every time I bring up Tommy's adoption.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: I only wanted you. I only wanted you.",
        "Cristian: And I wanted you.",
        "Evangeline: And now, we have no one.",
        "Cristian: You made a choice.",
        "Evangeline: No. You did.",
        "Cristian: Oh. If making me the bad guy makes you feel better than copping to your feelings for Manning, then go ahead. Go ahead.",
        "Todd: What's going on?",
        "Evangeline: You want to tell him, or should I?",
        "Cristian: Doesn't matter to me. Go ahead. Make his day.",
        "Todd: Tell me what?",
        "Evangeline: Nothing. Forget it.",
        "Cristian: Oh, wait. It was not nothing. It was something. Tell him.",
        "Evangeline: No. No, Cristian.",
        "Todd: What are you talking about?",
        "Cristian: I'm talking about what really happened at the ski lodge.",

        "Clint: Get down! Both of you, get down.",
        "John: Oh, got him!",
        "Marty: Miles!",
        "Natalie: John, John!",
        "Clint: No, get on the floor!",
        "John: Is everybody ok?",
        "Clint: Yeah, I got his gun, John.",
        "Viki: Yes, I think we're fine.",
        "Dorian: Speak for yourself. Blair?",
        "Blair: I'm fine. Really.",
        "Dorian: Blair! Blair? Let me see. Oh.",
        "Blair: Oh --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Officer Sahid, report. Are you ok?",
        "Talia: Ah! Antonio, I've got the perp!",
        "Antonio: Talia, I can't see anything. Tell me what's happening.",
        "Talia: You move, I shoot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I did not freak out.",
        "Marcie: \"Rip it up\"? \"Right now\"? You don't think you were overreacting just a little?",
        "Michael: We know everything we need to know about Tommy's birthparents. Rex showed us the paperwork.",
        "Marcie: I am talking about what if, for some reason, we're not around? Don't you think Tommy deserves to know that his mother suffered from a mental illness?",
        "Michael: Why?",
        "Marcie: Because he could inherit it. Why do you think?",
        "Michael: I think that Tommy's fine.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, he's fine. He's fine now, but he's Bound to be curious, Michael. We are his parents, and that means we have an obligation to explain absolutely everything we possibly can to him about his biological mother and father.",
        "Michael: Absolutely everything?",
        "Marcie: Yes.",
        "Michael: Well, what do we really know about these people, Marcie? No, we don't even know their names, ok? They chose to remain anonymous. So why do we have to tell him anything?",
        "Marcie: Because maybe they'll change their minds, Michael",
        "Marcie: Maybe they'll want to know what happened to their son.",
        "Michael: Marcie, why do you have to go down this road? Look, it's -- it's not going to make Tommy any happier. It's not going to make his life any better.",
        "Marcie: That's debatable. I want to know why you freak out every single time I ask you about Tommy's adoption.",
        "Michael: Because I don't like to think of Tommy as adopted. He's ours, Marcie. That's all that matters.",
        "Marcie: I know that.",
        "Michael: So, when I'm reminded that we are not Tommy's birthparents, I get a little upset.",
        "Marcie: Are you sure? Are you sure that's all that's bothering you?",
        "Michael: Isn't that enough?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: How is she?",
        "Dorian: I see an entrance and an exit. I think it's an in-and-out wound.",
        "John: The ambulance is only a few minutes out. Yell if you need anything.",
        "Dorian: Hang on, Blair. Can you\ufffd open your eyes for me? Blair? Blair, open your eyes.",
        "Clint: That should hold them till backup arrives.",
        "John: Thanks for the assist, Clint. I couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I haven't roped a steer in a while, but I guess you never forget.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Hold -- hold still, ok? I just -- I need to clean this cut.",
        "Miles: Is Blair going to be ok?",
        "Marty: I don't know. I hope so. I think the bleeding's stopped, so I'm going to -- I'm going to get you a Band-Aid.",
        "Miles: No, that's not important. Help Blair.",
        "Marty: Look, Dorian's with her and she's a doctor, ok? And I don't think she would take help from me anyway.",
        "Miles: Why not?",
        "Marty: Long story.",
        "Miles: Yeah, I know. You keep referring to it.",
        "Marty: It's just not something I like to talk about, ok?",
        "Miles: Ok.",
        "Marty: No, maybe next time, we can, you know, get the rabbit.",
        "Miles: Crazy night. I guess I got more of what I'm asking for. More life experiences.",
        "Marty: Ah. Huh. These life experiences include getting held up at gunpoint? I don't think that's what you're looking for.",
        "Miles: No, but I could get used to some others.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, where -- where is the ambulance? Ok, you said that five minutes ago. We need it now. We have a woman shot here.",
        "Viki: Blair, can you hear me, honey?",
        "Dorian: Viki, would you please stay out of this? And I mean that.",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "Dorian: Hey.",
        "Blair: What happened?",
        "Dorian: I will answer that for her. You fainted, honey.",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "Dorian: Because you walked in on a robbery in progress. The gun went off.",
        "Blair: I was shot?",
        "Dorian: Shh, shh, shh. Yes.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Dorian: I'm afraid so. Can I have some more clean napkins here?",
        "Natalie: I'm on it.",
        "Dorian: Thank you.",
        "Viki: An ambulance is on its way.",
        "Dorian: Well, thank you for that information, Viki. Now, I will allow you to be helpful, thank you.",
        "Blair: Dorian, just --",
        "Dorian: Shh, shh, shh, darling. I'm sorry, I'll rein it in. Look, press down on the wound like that, ok?",
        "Blair: Easy. Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Yes, and if the napkin fills with any more blood, you call me right away. Excuse me, Marty.",
        "Marty: Yeah, is there anything I can do?",
        "Dorian: Yes, absolutely. This may sound a little strange, but do you happen to have any antibiotics, alcohol? Towelettes on you?",
        "Marty: No, but I can get some vodka from the bar. I'm sure that would help.",
        "Blair: You? Over my dead body!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So what really happened at the ski lodge?",
        "Evangeline: Don't. Don't do this.",
        "Cristian: I -- what happened was, I was pissed off. I was really pissed off. But I didn't want to wait till morning to head back to town. So --",
        "Todd: So?",
        "Cristian: So I went up to Layla's room to tell her that I was leaving, but when I got up to her room --",
        "Todd: You decided a warm body was better than a cold car?",
        "Cristian: Something like that.",
        "Todd: Tell me something I don't know.",
        "Cristian: Well, give me a second, I will.",
        "Evangeline: Just stop it, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: I didn't sleep with Layla, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry. I guess sometimes I just still worry that someone's going to take Tommy away from us, you know? I get nightmares.",
        "Michael: Honey --",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Michael: I will never let that happen.",
        "Marcie: You promise? Hmm?",
        "Michael: Rip up that letter. Marcie, do it. We're -- we're going to get old together, you and me, ok? And Tommy's going to push us around in our wheelchairs. He's -- he's going to wipe the drool off our chins.",
        "Marcie: Oh, God, I hope he just puts us in a nursing home.",
        "Michael: Relax, honey. Relax, ok? I don't like to see you so worked up.",
        "Marcie: I don't know what's gotten into me lately. I just -- I -- I just seem to worry about all the terrible things that might happen, instead of what's --",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, stop. It's bad for you. It's bad for Tommy. And God forbid, something terrible ever happened to you and me, Tommy has an army of people to take care of him.",
        "Marcie: He does, doesn't he? He has us.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: And he has Lindsay and my dad and my brothers and your soon, Aunt Natalie.",
        "Michael: Maybe.",
        "Marcie: What? What -- what -- what do you mean, maybe? I mean, I just assumed John's doing pretty well. I thought he was going to propose.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I'm -- I'm not so sure that's going to happen.",
        "Marcie: Did John talk to you? I mean, did he change his mind?",
        "Michael: Well, John and Natalie have been having problems since the accident. You know, John seems, at least to me, that he could -- he could go either way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Read them their rights, and then book them.",

        "Marty: Sure.",
        "John: You look a little shaken up.",
        "Marty: No, I -- I'm fine. You know, getting used to being held up at gunpoint.",
        "John: Not funny.",
        "Marty: No, why don't you check on Blair? She's the one who got hurt. Look, John, I'm -- I don't mean to be rude. I just -- you saved the day. Thanks.",
        "John: Just doing my job.",
        "Natalie: Hey. How can I help?",
        "John: They'll need your statement, but if you want to get out of here, I'll tell them to get it from you later.",
        "Natalie: No, if you're sticking around, I'm sticking around.",
        "John: I won't have a lot of time for you.",
        "Natalie: That's ok, it doesn't matter. Look, we were in the middle of something, and you didn't get to say your piece.",
        "John: It can wait.",
        "Natalie: No. I have waited for a really long time, and I don't want to put my life on hold anymore. Our life.",

        "Evangeline: Leave it alone.",
        "Cristian: You see, there's more. There's a lot more.",
        "Todd: No, I'm not interested. And you're obviously upsetting Evangeline, so I don't want to hear any more.",
        "Cristian: Wait a minute, wait a minute -- it's got nothing to do with Evangeline.",
        "Todd: But I'm not interested in your sex life, see.",
        "Cristian: Well, in this case, I think you will.",
        "Todd: Evangeline, what are you guys talking about? You're talking around it all.",
        "Cristian: Definitely. Bingo.",
        "Evangeline: Enough. Enough! Why are you doing this? You're not the man I was in love with.",
        "Todd: \"Was in love with\"? Is the romance over?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Turn around, slowly. Keep your hands where I can see them. Hands in the air! Stand up slowly. Slowly! Ah! Son of a --",
        "Antonio: Ugh. Talia? Bunny? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I -- I got it right here. All right, I'll drop it off on the way down. And listen, thanks again for taking them, ok? With any luck, Bree should sleep till her mother gets home. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: That was quite a little stunt you pulled.",
        "Miles: Yeah, I -- I figured I would drop the watch, and then he would go for it and then I would go for him.",
        "John: You're lucky he didn't kill you.",
        "Miles: I didn't think about that.",
        "John: Obviously, you weren't thinking at all.",
        "Marty: Look, don't listen to him, ok? You were very brave.",
        "Miles: No, he's right. I was stupid. The guy knocked me out. I could have been killed if Detective McBain didn't stop him.",
        "Marty: No, you -- you distracted him, which gave him an opening. So you know, Miles, you're a hero.",
        "Miles: Thanks.",
        "Marty: Well, I was scared out of my mind watching you go after that guy.",
        "Miles: You were?",

        "John: Hey, I -- I told you this might go late.",
        "Natalie: I can wait. You were pretty tough on Miles, though, don't you think?",
        "John: You might not be saying that if we were zipping him up in a body bag right now.",
        "Natalie: Ok, he tried, and it all worked out ok. Sometimes, you have to let this go.",
        "John: The perps dropped the stolen goods during the fight. They all need to be collected and bagged.",
        "Natalie: Wish I could help, but I'm an ex-forensics tech now.",
        "John: Whose fault is that?",
        "Natalie: Hmm. My, aren't we cranky?",
        "John: Look, I just -- you know, we were supposed to be having a quiet dinner together.",
        "Natalie: You know, you were pretty sexy taking out those bad guys.",
        "John: I screwed up. I should have got to the gun sooner. Blair got hit because of me.",
        "Natalie: Oh, John, that is a stretch, even for you. You're the hero, once again. I forgot how good you were at it.",
        "John: Well, you did pretty good yourself. You kept your cool.",
        "Natalie: Go be the hero. I can wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Police, freeze!",
        "Antonio: It's Antonio.",
        "Talia: What are you doing here?",
        "Antonio: I heard a scuffle over the mike. You didn't respond. The screen went dark. What happened?",
        "Talia: The arsonist clocked me.",
        "Antonio: I'll call an ambulance.",
        "Talia: I'm fine. What about you? You're supposed to be recuperating. What about your kids?",
        "Antonio: They're at a Antonio's.",
        "Talia: Why didn't you just call for backup?",
        "Antonio: Because I didn't know what the situation was. I was afraid you might be with the perp, and if I came in here with sirens blaring, he might do something desperate.",
        "Talia: He was pretty desperate.",
        "Antonio: You sure it was our guy?",
        "Talia: Yeah, it was him. He threw dirt in my face, and I got disoriented for a second, but I lost him.",
        "Antonio: All right, I'll call it in.",
        "Talia: No, I -- I already did. There are a couple units circling the neighborhood looking for him, but he's probably long gone by now.",
        "Antonio: All that matters is that you're ok.",
        "Talia: You're worried about me, Detective?",
        "Antonio: Actually, I'm worried about the expensive equipment you were wearing. Where is it?",
        "Talia: It broke during the scuffle. I think the arsonist kicked it in. I'm sorry.",
        "Antonio: It's not your fault.",
        "Talia: I had him by the leg. I had him.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, and we'll get him.",
        "Talia: What if somebody gets killed before we do?",
        "Antonio: All we can do is the job.",
        "Talia: 24/7.",
        "Antonio: Good. Now, just do me a favor. Don't let your emotions get in the way.",
        "Talia: Huh.",
        "Antonio: What's so funny?",
        "Talia: You are funny. Oh -- hey, how many times have you let your emotions get in the way of a case?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, as fun as this is, I'd prefer to spend the evening with you, and you only, Evangeline. You up for it?",
        "Evangeline: Give me and Cristian a minute.",

        "Evangeline: No.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, if you slept with Blair to hurt me, congratulations. You succeeded. But if Blair slept with you to hurt Todd, it is not your business to tell him.",
        "Cristian: I don't know why you like to protect this guy.",
        "Evangeline: Just walk away, Cristian. Don't make things worse than they are.",
        "Cristian: I'm not trying to make things worse, I'm trying to make them better -- for you.",
        "Evangeline: And how does that work?",
        "Cristian: Well, I just don't think you're seeing things clearly. Because, you see, when Todd finds out that I slept with Blair, he's going to go nuts. And then you'll realize what everybody else in this town already knows. He's in love with her. You're just a rebound, that's all.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you for the compliment.",
        "Cristian: Hey, I'm just trying to help you out here, you know? You don't want to dig yourself in deeper.",
        "Evangeline: Mm-hmm. If you tell him that you slept with Blair, he'll kill you. You think that won't hurt me?",

        "Marcie: Yes.",
        "Michael: You and me? Because that's all I care about, you know? I mean, maybe it's selfish, but I don't care, so long as we're good.",
        "Marcie: We're good, I promise. Now, you're sure you're ok? No blurred vision, no nausea, no --",
        "Michael: Hmm.",
        "Marcie: Faintness? Any of that?",
        "Michael: I might need some medicine. Mmm, better. But I think I need to adjust the dosage.",
        "Marcie: Really?",
        "Michael: Perfect.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Well, anytime you need to feel better, you just let me know. So will I see you at home?",
        "Michael: Yes, you will see me at home.",
        "Marcie: You know I will. You think you actually might be able to leave when your shift is over?",
        "Michael: You know, I'm going to try. Honestly. It's been pretty quiet here tonight, so it looks good.",
        "Marcie: Try very, very hard.",
        "Michael: What do we got, guys?",
        "EMT: Gunshot.",
        "Dorian: It's an in-and-out wound, but I think she's getting a bit shocky.",

        "Evangeline: I still love you, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Well, that's not what you said a little while ago.",
        "Evangeline: I was angry. I miss the old Cristian.",
        "Cristian: And I miss the old Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: I haven't changed. I still care about you.",
        "Cristian: And I still care about you. I just -- I just don't see a future for us anymore. It doesn't mean I want to see you hurt.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, well, I feel the same way.",
        "Cristian: You know, I slept with Blair to stop hurting, not to hurt you.",
        "Evangeline: But you did hurt me. And if you tell him, you will hurt Todd, and I don't want to see him hurt.",
        "Cristian: He doesn't care about you, Evangeline, not the way you do for him.",
        "Evangeline: You know nothing about my relationship with Todd. All you do is assume and all you see is what you want to see to make it easier for you to hate me",

        "Dorian: No, no, no, no. The kids are fine. It's Blair. She's had an accident.",
        "Todd: Uh -- I got to go to the hospital. Something happened with Blair.",

        "Dorian: He hung up on me, but I -- I do believe he's coming over.",
        "Michael: X-rays showed that there was no major damage to any of your arteries. Exit and entry wounds are clean. So you suffered no major damage.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Thank God.",
        "Michael: Yeah. We'll put you on a course of antibiotics, but -- and painkillers, as well, but I don't see any reason why you can't go home tomorrow.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Dorian: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Well, looks like you wasted a whole evening for nothing.",
        "Dorian: What are you talking about?",
        "Blair: I'm talking about your big date with Clint. I ruined it. I'm sorry. Robbers ruined it. Well, actually, it was ruined way before they arrived.",

        "Clint: For what?",
        "Viki: Well, for what you did at the restaurant, you know, when you tackled that other gunman, you know. We're all very grateful, that's all. Thank you.",
        "Clint: Oh -- it was more stupid than anything else. I just got so damn angry the way he threatened Dorian.",
        "Viki: Right, Dorian.",
        "Clint: You want to talk about it?",
        "Viki: You mean, my crashing your dinner date?",
        "Clint: Hmm, and insisting that I ditch Dorian for you.",
        "Viki: Guess I kind of surprised you, didn't I?",
        "Clint: That's putting it mildly, Viki.",
        "Viki: Well, I -- I don't normally burst into restaurants demanding that the father of my children ditch his dinner date.",
        "Clint: No. So why the sudden impulse?",
        "Viki: I told you.",
        "Clint: I think I need to hear it again.",
        "Viki: Because I would like to see you, exclusively. And I think I need to know what you think. Officer: We identified all the stolen property, except for this. Looks like someone's about to propose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Antonio: That can't be good.",
        "Talia: Yeah, they say you don't play by the rules. Apparently, you lost your badge a couple of times. You even got sent to anger management.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Well, that's true. It wasn't smart, and it won't happen again.",
        "Talia: Yeah, right.",
        "Antonio: Don't use my past as an excuse for your actions, Officer.",
        "Talia: What? \"Do as I say, not as I do\"?",
        "Antonio: Do you want to avoid a lot of grief in the future?",
        "Talia: They also said you weren't afraid of anything.",
        "Antonio: Well, they're a bunch of liars.",
        "Talia: Well, you risked your life to come make sure I was ok.",
        "Antonio: Mm-hmm.",
        "Talia: You're not even supposed to be here.",
        "Antonio: That makes me a cop, not a hero.",
        "Talia: I think it makes you both.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. How come you think you know so much about me, and I know practically nothing about you?",
        "Talia: There's not much to tell.",
        "Antonio: Right. Well, Officer Sahid, whenever you're ready, you let me know.",
        "Talia: Look, this isn't getting us any closer to finding the arsonist.",
        "Antonio: No, it isn't. You got a description?",
        "Talia: No, his face was completely covered. His hat was covering his hair.",
        "Antonio: Mm-hmm. What about height? Weight?",
        "Talia: 6-ish. Maybe 170, 180. All I noticed were his shoes. They were black, low heel, generic.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. Race?",
        "Talia: He was all bundled up. Gloves on his hands, a scarf around his neck. He could have been from mars for all I know.",
        "Antonio: Well, let's hope not. What about the medal you found?",
        "Talia: It's gone. He must have taken it when he knocked me out.",
        "Antonio: Which means he didn't plant it for us to find it. He messed up.",
        "Talia: So if he dropped it when he set the fire --",
        "Antonio: He came back for it. Because it was too important for him to risk us finding it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marty: Look, I don't mean to be a pain, but I just noticed that my wallet is missing.",
        "John: It's in evidence. I logged it in myself.",
        "Marty: No, no. That doesn't make any sense, because the robbers never even got to it.",
        "John: You must have given it to them, or they took it. You might not remember.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God. When I came in and someone bumped into me, they must have taken it then, and -- huh. You know, I thought I was smarter than that. I thought I would have noticed.",
        "John: It happens.",
        "Marty: You know, is there any way that I can get something out of it? I have some pictures there of Patrick, my husband, and they're my only copies. They're just kind of really important to me.",
        "John: I understand. Everything needs to be catalogued and photographed. But, as soon as I can.",
        "Marty: Thanks.",
        "Miles: Are -- are we free to go?",
        "John: Of course. Thanks for sticking around. It was a big help.",
        "Miles: Sorry the way the date ended.",
        "Marty: Oh, Miles, it wasn't a date.",
        "Miles: Well, what do you call it, then?",
        "Marty: We were just two friends who went out to dinner. I -- look, I know you want more from me, ok? But this is all I can give you.",
        "Miles: That's no problem. You can't have too many friends.",
        "Marty: Great.",
        "John: Do me a favor, Decker, I need Dr. Saybrooke's wallet.",
        "Officer Decker: It's right here.",
        "John: Thanks.",

        "Todd: Viki, hey. What happened with Blair? Is she all right?",
        "Viki: Oh -uh, yes. There was a robbery attempt at the palace, and she was hit by a stray bullet, but we have every --",
        "Todd: Shot?",
        "Viki: We have every reason to believe she's going to be fine. It was up here.",
        "Todd: Ok. That's good. Well, I want to see her.",
        "Clint: Well, Michael's examining her right now.",
        "Todd: In here?",

        "Todd: I'm sorry, are you a doctor?",
        "Evangeline: Great.",
        "Cristian: You can't just barge in there. It could upset her. It might not be good for her.",

        "Todd: So what's the deal, Cristian? You got the hots for my wife again?",
        "Cristian: You mean your ex-wife.",
        "Todd: How is she?",
        "Michael: Well, luckily, the bullet passed right through without doing any major damage. She's going to make a full recovery.",
        "Viki: Well, that's good.",
        "Clint: When can she go home?",
        "Michael: Well, I'd like to keep her overnight for observation. So, sometime tomorrow.",
        "Todd: I think I should see her now, if that's ok.",
        "Michael: Tomorrow. She needs to rest. Well, if you have any more questions, you have my pager number.",
        "Dorian: Thank you, Michael.",
        "Clint: Dorian -- you look like you could use a rest, too.",
        "Dorian: I am a bit exhausted.",
        "Clint: You know, as it turned out, Viki and I took separate cars over here, so I could take you home, if that's ok.",
        "Dorian: Clint, that's more than ok.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm very glad that Blair's going to be ok.",
        "Todd: Yeah, me, too.",

        "Todd: Hmm -- no, but I think -- I think we're ok.",
        "Viki: Good. And are you ok?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm fine. No permanent damage, anyway.",
        "Viki: Great. Well, if you need me, you call, ok?",
        "Evangeline: Todd, you should just go home. You don't want Starr finding out about her mother on television.",
        "Todd: Oh, well, Starr's not allowed to watch television after the ski lodge escapade. Now, I'm curious about your interest in my wife.",
        "Cristian: Ahem --",
        "Evangeline: She was shot. Any decent human being would be concerned.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I've spent enough time with this, you're right.",
        "Cristian: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute -- Michael said no visitors, so you can't go in there.",
        "Todd: Don't you have something better to do? I mean, aren't you busy playing tit for tat with Evangeline by sleeping with her sister?",
        "Cristian: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Todd: No?",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, just leave it alone, leave it alone.",
        "Todd: Why don't you just cop up, man? To get revenge on her, right?",
        "Blair: Todd, would you leave him alone? It's not his fault that we slept together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I wish I could tell you what it looked like.",
        "Antonio: Maybe you could. Close your eyes. That's an order, Officer. Now picture where you found it. Pick it up. What does it look like?",
        "Talia: I told you, there's, like, an inscription on it. Text. Some sort of symbol. It's covered in soot.",
        "Antonio: Ok. Focus. What does it say? Come on, what do the words say?",
        "Talia: I'm sorry. Every time I get a picture of it, the perp hits me in the head and it just goes black. I'm sorry.",
        "Antonio: Ok. Try and remember, ok? In case the footage we recorded is a bit cloudy.",
        "Talia: I'll try.",
        "Antonio: Maybe you'll remember.",
        "Talia: Ok.",

        "Michael: Yeah. I'm on duty. I -- heard what happened at The Palace.",
        "John: How's Blair?",
        "Michael: Well, actually, that's why I'm calling. No, she's going to be fine. The bullet passed right through without doing any major damage, so I think she should recover fully.",
        "John: That's good.",
        "Michael: How about yourself?",
        "John: Not a scratch.",
        "Michael: Oh. Well, that's good, but that -- that's not what I meant. I was referring to you and Natalie.",
        "John: I -- I really didn't get a chance to talk to her yet.",
        "Michael: Do you know what you're going to say?",
        "John: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Michael: Good news or bad news?",
        "John: That's between me and her, Mike. I got to go. Natalie, we got to --",
        "Natalie: John, listen. You know, when -- when you brought me here tonight, I thought you were going to break up with me, but -- were you going to ask me to marry you? Because the answer is yes.",
