        "Destiny: What's Dani doing here?",
        "Dani: You didn't get anyone to join up for crew, huh?",
        "Cristian: Not true.",
        "Darren: Ow!",
        "Cristian: Darren?",
        "Darren: Oh, I'm okay, Mr. Vega. Just hammered my hand.",
        "Dani: That's your crew? What's the matter? Couldn't get your little girlfriend to sign up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So what are you up to?",
        "Natalie: I'm just doing my taxes.",
        "Jessica: I thought Dad handled all that stuff for us at B.E.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, I like to do it myself. I use Turbotax, so it's really easy.",
        "Jessica: What's Turbotax?",
        "Natalie: It's this really great tax software program that automatically double-checks my returns, so I'm good to go.",
        "Jessica: How nice for you.",
        "Natalie: Is there something wrong?",
        "Jessica: I was just wondering, does it bother you?",
        "Natalie: Does what bother me?",
        "Jessica: Stealing someone's boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hi, Starr.",
        "Starr: Marty, John?",
        "Marty: Is this a bad time?",
        "Starr: No, I just--come on in. I just thought you were Cole.",
        "Marty: Okay. Oh, he's not here?",
        "Starr: No, he pulled an all-nighter at the library, so...",
        "Cole: Starr, I am so sorry.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Cole: What's going on? Is everything okay?",
        "John: Better than okay.",
        "Marty: We're having a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You're here.",
        "Rex: Where else would I be?",
        "Gigi: I figured you probably came to your senses.",
        "Rex: Cut out on you?",
        "Gigi: I wouldn't blame you. Especially after I acted like a complete nut job last night asking you to marry me.",
        "Rex: I didn't think it was that crazy. You're doing whatever you can to win. I understand that. I would do the same thing.",
        "Gigi: I'm just so scared, because right now, Schuyler's holding all the cards.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: [Gasps] Sierra?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Oh... too early. Need...coffee. Need a vodka.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Sierra? Sierra, sweetie? Sweetie, I'm--I'm so sorry. I don't know what\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Just what the doctor ordered. Hair of the frog that kissed you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Roxy: What the hell...",
        "Woman: Back here.",
        "Roxy: Come back later! We're closed!",
        "Allison: But I can't wait that long! I got big plans, and I really need to get my hair did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, I'll bite. Why don't you tell me what you have heard?",
        "Jessica: That you're a troublemaker. It's just all part of your M.O.",
        "Natalie: I have an M.O.?",
        "Jessica: That's why you came to Llanview in the first place.",
        "Natalie: Jess, that was a really, really long time ago.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, when you pretended to be my friend just to punish my mother.",
        "Natalie: Our mother.",
        "Jessica: And then you crashed Grandpa's funeral.",
        "Natalie: Okay. I've definitely made some mistakes.",
        "Jessica: And was it a mistake when you stole someone's boyfriend?",
        "Natalie: What exactly has Marty told you?",
        "Jessica: Marty?",
        "Natalie: Because I've backed off, okay? I am leaving John and her alone.",
        "Jessica: I'm not talking about John. I'm talking about Cristian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Jessica's not my girlfriend.",
        "Dani: But you've got feelings for her, right?",
        "Cristian: Yes...no. I mean, yes, of course. I care about her. She's my friend, but I have a girlfriend. And...this is inappropriate.",
        "Dani: So what? What, we can't talk about anything but Monet's use of light?",
        "Cristian: Sure we can. You know what? Join the crew. We can talk about so many things.",
        "Dani: Thanks, but I'm not that hard up for gossip. Besides, I've got better things to do.",
        "Cristian: Like what?",
        "Dani: I'm gonna try out.",
        "Cristian: I thought you said musicals were for losers.",
        "Dani: Yeah, well, this one's about my sister, Starr. She's not so bad, so I figure the play can't be, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Oh, my God! This is so great!",
        "Marty: Yes!",
        "Cole: Come here. Hey, this is awesome. Congratulations, guys.",
        "Marty: Thanks. Yeah, we--we tried calling you last night and wanted to rush over and give you the good news.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'm sorry. My cell phone was on silent. I was doing an all-nighter with my soc partner. I'm really sorry I missed your call.",
        "Marty: Oh, no, don't be, don't be. It gave me an excuse to tell you in person.",
        "Cole: And I still can't believe it. I always wanted a little brother.",
        "Marty: There you go.",
        "Cole: And now, Hope's going to have a little aunt or uncle.",
        "Starr: Yeah. So, are you keeping it to the family, or spreading the word?",
        "Marty: Oh, it's... it's spreading on its own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm not stealing anyone, and I certainly didn't steal Cristian from you.",
        "Jessica: Why can't you just be straight with me, Natalie? I saw the wedding photos, okay? Cristian told me everything.",
        "Natalie: And did he also tell you about Seth, the guy that you were with when Cristian and I were together?",
        "Jessica: Well, who was Cristian with? Because I'm sure you must have stolen him from someone.",
        "Natalie: The point is, he wasn't with you.",
        "Jessica: Well, so what? You're my twin sister and he was my first love. How could you marry him?",
        "Natalie: I married him because I loved him, and Cristian loved me. Look, I--I understand this is very hard for you to wrap your head around right now. This was a lifetime ago, and Cris and I were very respectful of your feelings, and you gave us your blessing.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, maybe I was okay with it then, but I'm not okay with it now. And I'm sure Marty's not going to be okay with you making a play for John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Do not count yourself out yet. We're going to do everything we can to make the judge see that Sierra Rose belongs with you--the way Stacy wanted it.",
        "Gigi: You're really staying?",
        "Rex: I've got your back all the way. Until you get custody of Sierra, for as long as you need. Trust me, Schuyler's got nothing on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Sierra? Sierra, are you here? Sierra?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: Here it is.",
        "Roxy: Allison Perkins...I thought you were--",
        "Allison: Beautiful? Talented? Sweet and wholesome?",
        "Roxy: Crazy?",
        "Allison: I get that a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: The messenger needs the baby.",
        "Schuyler: What is the messenger... Mitch Laurence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I'm calling the police.",
        "Allison: I wouldn't do that if I were you.",
        "Roxy: I don't care what you say; I'm turning your bony ass in ASAP.",
        "Allison: Oh, Roxanne, haven't you heard the saying, \"For every action, there is a significantly greater and infinitely more devastating reaction\"? For example, you rat me out, I rat you out.",
        "Roxy: You ain't got nothing on me.",
        "Allison: Wrong answer. I do. Don't you remember what happened when Rex was born?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You are rather confident this morning. Which is strange, considering the holes in your case.",
        "T\u00e9a: And what holes would those be?",
        "Eli: Well, there's Schuyler's refusal to let the social worker in when she stopped by for her little visit.",
        "T\u00e9a: Schuyler said it went swimmingly.",
        "Eli: Then why haven't I received the report? Unless maybe you intercepted it after your client blew it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. I can't wait to hear you run that theory by the judge. I'm especially going to enjoy presenting my own theory--that you were too busy servicing Blair that you lost track of your own lackey.",
        "Eli: Hey.",
        "Gigi: What was that?",
        "Eli: Nothing. Let's get settled. The judge is going to be here soon. By the way, T\u00e9a--",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah?",
        "Eli: Where is Schuyler? Or have you lost track of your client?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Allison: Oh, what a cutie. Why, this little munchkin could give the Olsen twins a run for their money. That is, if she lives long enough. [Snickers] Don't worry. She'll be fine. Just don't do anything stupid like call the cops or tell anyone what's up. Keep quiet, wait for instructions, and maybe little Sierra Rose will end up with a 3-picture deal. Say buh-bye. Buh-bye.",
        "[Keys jingle in lock]",
        "Rachel: Whoa, oh! Whoa! What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: You do remember what happened, don't you Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Yeah, you helped me deliver Rex at the cabin.",
        "Allison: What next?",
        "Roxy: He was sick, so he went to the hospital, and he got all fixed up.",
        "Allison: It was awful. I could still hear him crying.",
        "[Sierra cries]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Look, I'd love to stay. I just have to get to school. I promised Langston that I would help her out with auditions.",
        "Cole: Okay. Well, I'll walk you out.",
        "Marty: You know, this is going to be you and me pretty soon. Uh-huh.",
        "John: Uh-huh.",
        "Marty: So I guess in the meantime--whoosh--we need to make a few decisions. Like where are we going to live?",
        "Cole: Hey, you let Langston know that I demand final approval for Cole- casting, okay?",
        "Starr: Sure.",
        "Cole: Look, I know I should have called.",
        "Starr: Were you in Hannah's dorm room last night?",
        "Cole: Well, why--why would you think I was there?",
        "Starr: Well, when we ordered pizzas, the delivery girl--you know, Karen--she said that she saw you at the dorm room, and when we talked, you said that you were at the library.",
        "Cole: Okay, Hannah and I were studying. Come on, you know Karen. She's a total stoner. Who knows what she saw?",
        "Starr: That's what Markko said.",
        "Cole: Well, Markko's right.",
        "Starr: Okay. I'll talk to you later. Got to go.",
        "John: You know, I know where we could live. Right here.",
        "Marty: Excuse me?",
        "John: Yeah, look, they got all the kid furniture already. There's 4 babysitters in place.",
        "Marty: [Laughs] Yeah, as tempting as that sounds...",
        "John: What, you don't want to split the rent 6 ways?",
        "[Marty laughs]",
        "John: I got a few ideas.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I thought you might. I thought you might. But I'm going to have to hear them later, because I have to go.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Cole: Hey, John, you can hang out here. We can catch up, talk baby.",
        "Marty: [Gasps] That sounds like an excellent idea. Here you go.",
        "John: No, no, you sure you don't need a ride?",
        "Marty: Here you go.",
        "John: No, what? What?",
        "Marty: No, I'm going to catch a cab, and I'm going to see you, and you, and you later.",
        "John: Here you go, back to your dad.",
        "Cole: No, you keep her.",
        "John: No, I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Cole: Oh, you're doing just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I told you, I am not making a play for John.",
        "Jessica: So you say.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Tell Marty whatever you want. I really don't care.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, like you care about anything.",
        "Natalie: Believe it or not, Jess, I care about you.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Natalie: Yes, really. Of course.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, how come you didn't mention to me that you married the one guy that I love, huh?",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry. You know what? You're right. I was wrong for that. I was going to tell you. I just--honestly, Jess, I didn't know how you were going to react. I--I can't imagine how hard all of this must be for you, but you need to realize that this is hard for me, too. I mean, I know not knowing me is no big loss for you, but... for me, all of a sudden, I lost my sister, my best friend. Okay? So, I'd like to make things right, but I want my sister back. I just don't know what to do.",
        "Jessica: Well, maybe there is something you could do.",
        "Natalie: Okay, name it.",
        "Jessica: Help me get Cristian back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Oh...",
        "Cole: How are you doing over there?",
        "John: Ugh...I think I'd have more luck defusing a bomb. Speaking of which...oof!",
        "Cole: Yeah, you'll get the hang of it. Yeah, just, like, right in there. There you go.",
        "John: Ah. [Sighs] I tell you, Cole, if I end up being half as good a parent as you and Starr, I'll be okay.",
        "Cole: Uh-uh, I think we're pretty average. I mean, we have problems just like everyone else.",
        "John: You've overcome a lot. I mean, more than most. And I think if anybody can make it, it's you guys.",
        "Cole: I hope so. I'm kind of--I'm kind of keeping something from Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Everyone, if I could have your attention--my name is Mr. G. I'm head of the drama department. Most of you know me already, but I see a few new faces out there. But this spring, we're staging an original work by a senior here, Langston Wilde. And if that doesn't impress you enough, she's also student directing. Langston?",
        "Dani: Thanks for saving me a seat.",
        "Destiny: Are you here to lend your support?",
        "Dani: Oh, no, I just came to hear Matthew tear up some Maroon Five.",
        "Matthew: Except you have to wait. The guys' audition isn't until after lunch.",
        "Langston: ...Based on things that happened to me--",
        "Dani: Hey, I bet you get to play Cole. Oh, what if I got Starr? Wouldn't it be so cool?",
        "Matthew: You're auditioning, too?",
        "Dani: Well, I thought I'd maybe give it a whirl.",
        "Matthew: That's so brave. I mean, since you're new and everything.",
        "Langston: ...Their love takes a while.",
        "Destiny: You know what would be a good part for you, Dani? Langston.",
        "Langston: ...Wondering if the couples will get together or not.",
        "Mr. G.: Okay, let's get started. First up, Destiny Evans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: Mr. Vega, I think I have a splinter.",
        "Cristian: Oh. You know what, Darren? We got to break for audition, anyway, so why don't you go see the nurse?",
        "Darren: Thanks, Mr. Vega.",
        "Cristian: Let me ask you something, just out of curiosity. Have you ever done any construction before?",
        "Darren: Oh, no. I only joined because I heard that older chick might audition. You know, the crazy blonde one. She's pretty hot, don't you think?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, she's pretty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Well, you're my sister. You say you want to be friends again, so help me out.",
        "Natalie: With Cristian?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. He won't listen to me. He just gets all stupid and mature whenever I remind him what we meant to one another.",
        "Natalie: You really think that Cristian's going to listen to me?",
        "Jessica: Well, yeah. Maybe if it comes from someone that he's known for a little while, someone who only wants the best for me, then maybe he'll listen to me when I tell him that we're supposed to be together.",
        "Natalie: What about Brody?",
        "Jessica: Ugh! What about Brody?",
        "Natalie: He loves you.",
        "Jessica: Well, I don't love him. I love Cristian, okay, and I want him back, so please?",
        "Natalie: Jess, honey, I'm--I'm sorry, but I can't. I mean, I don't feel comfortable messing around in Cristian's relationship.",
        "Jessica: But you feel comfortable messing around in John's?",
        "Natalie: I already told you.",
        "Jessica: What, that you're backing off? Right, so it means that you were there before. And what happens if you try to go after John again, huh?",
        "Natalie: Like I said before, I am not going after John, I am not trying to take John away from Marty, and especially not now that she's pregnant. [Sighs]",

        "Judge: Be seated. Let's proceed. Mr. Clarke?",
        "Eli: Well, nothing would make me happier than to begin, Your Honor, but it appears Ms. Delgado's client--that would be the current guardian of the child in question--doesn't believe this matter to be important enough to warrant his presence.",
        "Judge: Ms. Delgado, where is Mr. Joplin?",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, this is very unlike him.",

        "Schuyler: I'm sorry, Rachel. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't--I didn't mean to. Are you okay?",
        "Rachel: I'm fine, but what the hell is wrong with you? Are you sick?",
        "Schuyler: No. No, I just--I...thought you were someone else.",
        "Rachel: Who?",
        "Schuyler: It doesn't matter. Look, did you see anything last night?",
        "Rachel: Like what?",
        "Schuyler: Anything--anything at all. Anything suspicious or odd. Strangers?",
        "Rachel: No, I was at the treatment center all night. I got a call from a friend. My ex-boyfriend, actually.",
        "Schuyler: That was the emergency?",
        "Rachel: Unfortunately, yeah. He was working the program, but...anyway, I'm going to go to Chicago for a little while and help him get set back into rehab. I just came home to shower and pack.",
        "Schuyler: Yes. No, that's good. That's--that's a good idea.",

        "Roxy: What the hell you talking about?",
        "Allison: I thought you'd never ask. Ta da! Say goo goo gah gah, Rox. Never mind her. She's been drinking.",
        "Roxy: Is that a baby?",
        "Allison: No, Roxanne, it's a meatloaf. Of course it's a baby. Isn't she precious? Aw. Aw. Aw, I could eat her up.",

        "Natalie: Sure. Oh, and I--I hope maybe we can talk again soon.",
        "Jessica: Right. Whatever. So is John doing backflips, too?",
        "Marty: John doesn't really do backflips, but you know, he's actually pretty excited.",

        "John: Can't you tell Starr what you just told me?",

        "Cole: Yeah. And I--I don't know what to do.",
        "John: Well, look, Starr's a smart girl, you know, and I think she'll understand that you're keeping quiet for the sake of your friend. As long as it's not something more complicated.",
        "Cole: It's not. Look, I--I love Starr more than anything. But if I thought for one second that I did have feelings for this girl, I would deal with it head- on and come clean with Starr.",
