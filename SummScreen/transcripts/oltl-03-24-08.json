        "Rex: Gigi needs someone she can count on, someone who won't let her down.",
        "Jared: Oh, like you did?",
        "Rex: Someone who could be a good dad to Shane, who won't let him down.",
        "Jared: We're not dating, okay?",
        "Rex: I've seen plenty of guys like you in my work -- a user. It starts here and then it goes straight downhill. First, you flatter the woman like hell, then you get her to fall in love with you, then you turn on her. Whoo! You feel angry and -- and all that tension turns to hostility until finally you're -- you're beating her, you're hurting her, yore doing God knows --",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "Rex: Come on, this is fun. Help me up.",
        "Natalie: What is going on?",
        "Charlie: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Break it up! Back off. Now -- are you okay?",
        "Rex: Yeah!",
        "Viki: What on earth happened?",
        "Rex: Jared was hitting on Gigi. He's her boss, it's wrong.",
        "Gigi: Jared didn't hit on me, we kissed each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Is that my P.D.A.?",
        "Adriana: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Don't you get righteous with me, you selfish bitch!",
        "Dorian: Ah. What is going on here?",
        "Adriana: I can't believe that this is happening again, just when I tell myself that you've learned your lesson, that you would never do anything so hurtful, so manipulative, so stupid!",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute! That is quite enough -- don't you dare talk to me that way!",
        "Adriana: I will talk to you any way I damn please, because as of right now, you are no longer my mother!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Now, we need to reach out to Angel Square community leaders and let them know we're on their side, and work with them to help them reduce the conditions that lead to gang violence. We need decreased poverty, increased high school retention rates.",
        "Ramsey: So what are we, community services now? A community meeting maybe -- press covers those -- and if we're going to get the headlines that we need to grab, we need something sexier than holding hands. No, I want 10 more ideas by tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Talia: So if a perp walks up to you and puts a gun in your face, you don't even flinch -- get your doughnut off my shoulder.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Talia: But if a cat walks in front of you, you freak out --",
        "John: All right, let's get one thing straight --",
        "Talia: Little kitty.",
        "John: It wasn't just one cat -- it wasn't just a little kitty, there was many cats.",
        "Talia: Yes, it was.",
        "John: There was one there that had fangs, one of them had claws. It was very frightening.",
        "Ramsey: You're dismissed.",
        "Talia: You should've seen your face when it rubbed up against your leg and purred. I thought you were going to start crying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Wait -- Cole's coming here tonight?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Langston, this is not good. My dad's going to kill him.",
        "Langston: Your dad will never know -- no one will. Markko figured it all out. All we have to do is wait till the guards aren't looking --",
        "Starr: The guards? Well, what if the guards catch them?",
        "Langston: They won't.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Langston: Look, it's too late to stop it now, okay? The guys are probably already on the grounds and they said they were turning their cell phones off -- not like we have cell phones to call them with anyway.",
        "Starr: Langston, this is a really bad idea.",
        "Langston: Don't you want to see Cole?",
        "Starr: Of course I do. But I'm really scared what my dad will do if he finds out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, Todd, we really have to go to this party.",
        "Todd: No, we don't.",
        "Blair: Yes, we do. I'm sorry, I know --",
        "Todd: The party's -- I'm not leaving Starr by herself.",
        "Blair: Well, I -- we need to go. Oh, we -- we need to make an appearance, Todd.",
        "Todd: I'll have Coleman write a check -- that's what they want anyway.",
        "Blair: Hide!",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: Well, I was just thinking since, you know, we have the night all to ourselves, now you could take me upstairs and see what I got underneath this dress.",
        "Todd: Ooh, I like the way you think.",
        "Blair: I --",
        "[Cole bumps door]",
        "Todd: What was that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It was animal control.",
        "Talia: Mm-hmm?",
        "John: \"27 demon-possessed albino rabid cats taken from the premises.\" I don't know what you're laughing about -- it's 27.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ramsey: Yeah? Oh, your friends Sahid and McBain seem to be getting along swimmingly.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I got another idea for Angel Square.",
        "Ramsey: Mm-hmm?",
        "Antonio: We install surveillance cameras in public areas.",
        "Ramsey: Nah, they're too expensive.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, but it's effective.",
        "Ramsey: And infringing upon the civil liberties of all the good people of Angel Square. How's your daughter? I heard the desk sergeant take a message from, I believe, the pediatrician.",
        "Antonio: She's got a little bug, that's all.",
        "Ramsey: Well, if you want to take some time off to be with her --",
        "Antonio: No, she's with her grandfather, but thanks for the concern.",
        "Ramsey: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I just -- I think I have a nose for crime.",
        "John: Hmm. All I could smell was kitty litter.",
        "Talia: That's gross.",
        "John: It was.",
        "[Talia chuckles]",
        "John: But, you know, I just wanted to say you did -- you did good. You did.",
        "Talia: Oh. Stop it, John. Your extravagant praises are going to make me blush.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: You know, all those years I didn't know you were my mother, I didn't know how lucky I was.",
        "Dorian: What have I done to deserve this?",
        "Adriana: You were the one who sent me to Paris, weren't you? You know, why am I even asking? You're just going to lie about it. 200 phone calls to Jean- Pierre starting before I even heard of the man!",
        "Dorian: Okay, I made a few phone calls in order to further your career. You ended up with an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris. I mean, come on -- if that makes me a horrible mother, so be it.",
        "Adriana: You made me think that I was invited there because they liked my designs, because they were appreciative of -- of my talents.",
        "Dorian: Honey, they did like your designs and you are talented.",
        "Adriana: But it was all about keeping me and Rex apart, because you can't stand that we're actually getting married this time.",
        "Dorian: I gave you my blessing.",
        "Adriana: You are a curse on my life! Last time you tried to break us up, you nearly got me killed!",
        "Dorian: And do you know how hard I've been trying to atone for that?",
        "Adriana: Am I even real to you? Do you even see me, or am I just a means for you to try to live your life over? Do you want me to make all the same mistakes you did so I end up exactly like you -- alone and miserable and bitter?",
        "Dorian: I only want the best for you.",
        "Adriana: Good, great. Since the very best thing for me is to have you out of my life, I want you to go -- now! And do not ever come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: It was one kiss. We both knew it shouldn't have happened and decided to forget about it. It's no big deal.",
        "Jared: Until he made it one -- why?",
        "Natalie: Jared, could I talk to you over here, please?",
        "Viki: Okay, I'd like to suggest everyone go to neutral corners, please.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I think that's an excellent idea. Now, what the hell was that all about?",
        "Rex: You know how much Gigi needs her job at B.E. What -- what is she supposed to do when her jerk of a boss comes on to her?",
        "Charlie: Well, he's not a jerk.",
        "Rex: You don't even know Jared.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Rex: Why are you taking his side?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I suggest if you want to pick on somebody, it better not be my little brother.",
        "Jared: Well, your little brother needs to mind his own damn business, and I wasn't taking advantage of Gigi. It was a sweet, innocent little kiss.",
        "Natalie: Really, because it didn't look so innocent to me.",
        "Viki: Geege, maybe you should just go be with Shane. Uh -- I think Carlotta will be back in a minute.",
        "Gigi: I can at least stay and help you clean up. I'm so sorry.",
        "Viki: Hey, you weren't the one throwing the punch. But, you know, if Jared acted inappropriately --",
        "Gigi: He wasn't. The kiss was mutual, like I said -- no big deal.",
        "Marcie: \"No big deal\"? Gigi, Rex sure made it a big deal. I -- I don't understand why he would go off like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I know I heard something.",
        "Blair: No, you didn't.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Todd: No, look. See, this is why I wanted to come back. Look at this.",
        "Blair: You know, that -- that's -- that was Langston. She wanted to get some fresh air earlier and I told her before she went upstairs she was to lock the door, but you know, she's a teenager and she forgot, I guess.",
        "Todd: \"Forgot\" -- I don't think so.",
        "Blair: Well, you know, Cole obviously isn't here. He is not that bright.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, he isn't. He's a complete idiot.",
        "Blair: Todd, no one's here, so why don't you come take me upstairs, big boy?",
        "Todd: I'd like to have a drink first. You want a drink with me? Here. Let's toast our daughter's future without Cole.",
        "Blair: Todd, it's not that simple.",
        "Todd: I think it is. She's a beautiful, smart, talented young woman. There will be plenty of guys out there for her. I mean, it's not as if Cole was some big catch, anyway. Out of sight, out of mind -- give her a couple of weeks, she'll forget all about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Hey, Langston? I -- I think the guard is moving.",
        "Langston: Come on. We should go downstairs.",
        "Starr: Wait, so -- Cole's really coming, right?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Come on, big boy. Take me upstairs.",
        "Todd: You know what let's do?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Let's have sex on Dorian's couch.",
        "Blair: Uh, you know what? Wait, wait, wait, no. That's okay, right? It'll be all right. I just -- I got something to tell you.",
        "Todd: What is up with you?",
        "Blair: Well, I -- I just kind of did something today. I bought something that I don't think you're going to be too happy with me about.",
        "Todd: Oh -- what, another lizard for Starr or something?",
        "Blair: No, no, no, no.",
        "Todd: Well, all right, do I need to sit down?",
        "Blair: I bought Capricorn.",
        "Todd: You bought Capricorn?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: Are you kidding me?",
        "Blair: No, I -- it -- Antonio said he needed to get rid of it fast and it seemed like a really good investment.",
        "Todd: No, no, no -- undo it. I -- I'm -- I refuse to have the hassle of running a club.",
        "Blair: No, you're not going to have to \"hassle\" with anything, Todd, because, see, I bought it -- I bought it with my money, not yours.",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Blair: And Cristian's going to manage it and I'm going to sing whenever I want, and --",
        "Todd: Is that a fact? So it's about Cristian, is it?",
        "Blair: It's a sweet deal -- don't be silly. Now take me upstairs.",
        "[Starr gasps]",
        "Starr: Oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Look, I am not taking Jared's side but it's just that since that night that I saved his life, I have gotten to know him a little bit better and he -- he doesn't seem like a very bad guy.",
        "Rex: Fine. You're crazy about him, I get it.",
        "Charlie: No, but I would like to know why you goaded him into a fight.",
        "Rex: He hit me!",
        "Charlie: Okay, look, last few months, I've gotten to know Gigi a little bit better and she's a great gal, and I'm just wondering -- are you jealous? Is that's what's going on?",
        "Rex: Jealous?",
        "[Rex scoffs]",
        "Rex: Gigi and I went to, like, a sock hop together. I'm engaged to Adriana. I'm marrying the woman of my dreams, which is what I came here to tell you about. We set a date -- May 9.",
        "Charlie: Oh, well, that -- that's great, yeah.",
        "Rex: You're free, right?",
        "Charlie: Absolutely, definitely. I'll be there, yeah.",
        "Rex: I -- I know it might be awkward with Roxy there and all, t I promise to keep her away from the beer and champagne, at least till after the ceremony.",
        "Charlie: No, Roxy and I get along just fine now. Congratulations, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I didn't realize half the world saw me kissing Gigi -- or cared.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Oh, I don't care, but you can't tell me that a five-minute kiss was just an accident.",
        "Jared: I didn't say it was an accident -- I said it was a mistake.",
        "Natalie: Well, it damn well better be a mistake. B.E. has a strict sexual harassment policy.",
        "Jared: Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard Gigi yourself -- it was consensual.",
        "Natalie: Right, and she could've been afraid for her job. You know, you are in a position of power?",
        "Jared: Wow, you make it sound like kissing me is torture.",
        "Natalie: Maybe it was -- for her, I mean, if she felt like she was forced into it. She is a single mother who might do anything to hang on to her job.",
        "Jared: I don't think she was thinking about her job, believe me.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I believe you. But it shouldn't have happened.",
        "Jared: I agree with you, and so does Gigi, and I really don't know what the big deal is.",
        "Natalie: Huh -- you wouldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex still sees me as that geeky kid with glasses and braces. A bunch of kids were picking on me one time, he beat the crap out of them -- just the kind of guy he is.",
        "Layla: Nice. Hmm.",
        "Gigi: I mean, he put it all on the line for you, right, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: He sure did.",
        "Gigi: Oh. I thought he had finally gotten the idea that I can take care myself. Of course, he never saw me slap down a gropey trucker at the Bon-Jour.",
        "Viki: No, but I did, and I'm afraid of you.",
        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Viki: Let's go back to work.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Wait, Adriana. I want you to ask yourself one question -- why are you so angry?",
        "Adriana: Are you kidding me?",
        "Dorian: Well, your -- your trip to Paris was a big success and -- and the time away prompted you to finally set a wedding date. The separation made your relationship with Rex even stronger. Am I not accurate?",
        "Adriana: This isn't about how things turned out. This is about what you tried to do.",
        "Dorian: If time away from each other could harm your relationship, then isn't it better you found it out before the wedding?",
        "Adriana: This wasn't just about the time apart! You pulled me away at a time when Rex and I really, really needed to be together!",
        "Dorian: Why? Tell me -- are you worried about that girl, Gigi, who calls herself \"Gee-Hee\"?",
        "Adriana: \"Gigi\" -- Gigi was Rex's high school girlfriend. They weren't -- do you know what? I'm not going to get into that with you. How many times do I have to ask you to leave? I meant what I said -- I don't want you in my life.",
        "Dorian: But you really need your mother if you and Rex are having problems.",
        "Adriana: We're not! And not only do I not need you, I need you gone. So don't even think about coming to the wedding, and there will be a wedding. Do not email me; do not show up at my doorstep. Do not call me your daughter ever again.",
        "Dorian: Okay, Adriana, if you are upset with Rex, please --",
        "Adriana: No -- Rex -- no, you! I upset with you. Do I have to literally throw you out of my life? Fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: John?",
        "Ramsey: Close the door. I want to talk to you for a minute about your job performance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: How's it going with the task force?",
        "Antonio: Slowly.",
        "Talia: I'm sorry you're stuck working with Ramsey. I don't think I could do that.",
        "Antonio: Sure you could. I -- I think you're capable of getting along with anyone.",
        "Talia: What's wrong?",
        "Antonio: Huh. What was that all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: Sorry I was gone so long.",
        "Viki: Oh, don't worry about it. How's Jamie?",
        "Carlotta: Ah, her fever's down, doctor says she has a virus. She was asleep before we even got to R.J.'s",
        "Viki: Isn't that good!",
        "Carlotta: Yeah. Oh, gosh, look at all these customers.",
        "Viki: Yeah -- oh! I want you to meet -- Gigi Morasco, Carlotta Vega.",
        "Gigi: Hi.",
        "Carlotta: Pleasure.",
        "Viki: Gigi is waitress extraordinaire and all-around sensational human being.",
        "Gigi: Oh, please. Viki's letting me stay at her house, so this was no trouble at all.",
        "Carlotta: I remember Cristian telling me you applied for a job here and he turned you away. I have to do something for you.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. All right. Well, your tortilla soup smells so good and I do have a sick kid at home -- well, at Marcie's home right now.",
        "Carlotta: You, too?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, it must be going around.",
        "Carlotta: Hmm, hmm. Well, then, please, honey. Please take as much as you want.",
        "Gigi: Thank you. It was nice meeting you.",
        "Carlotta: Nice meeting you.",
        "Viki: I want you to meet somebody.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, this must be the famous Charlie",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Carlotta: Pleasure. Carlotta Vega.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, of the famous flan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Charlie Balsom.",
        "Carlotta: Uh -- and, Charlie, since it was my fault that you guys had to delay your date, I insist that you have dinner on the house.",
        "Viki: Thank you, we would love to do that, thank you.",
        "Carlotta: Have a seat and I will get the menus if you don't know them all by heart already.",
        "Viki: Oh, thanks.",
        "Rex: Well, have a nice date. I'm going to go say something to Jared. Don't worry -- you won't have to worry about jumping into the middle of a fight again. I'll be civil.",
        "Charlie: Good.",
        "Rex: See you at the Sixers' game.",
        "Charlie: Okay. Yep.",
        "Viki: Seems you learn more about your son every day, huh?",
        "Charlie: Oh, I sure do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Just wanted to say that if I was wrong about what happened earlier -- sorry.",
        "Jared: Well, I understand how you might have had the wrong idea. I wish it hadn't happened, but --",
        "Natalie: And you know what? It's not going to happen again, right? So why don't we just move on, shall we?",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "Layla: You sure have been busy today.",
        "Gigi: You want to run and tell Adriana all about it?",
        "Layla: Excuse me?",
        "Gigi: I know you called her in Paris just to tell her you saw Rex and me together at Capricorn. He was just trying to help me get a job, not that it's any of your business. Why would you want to upset your friend over nothing?",
        "Layla: So, nothing's going on between you and Rex, or between you and Jared? So everything is \"nothing\" -- got it, Gigi. Hmm. Bye, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: You know, Layla usually is a really nice person.",
        "Gigi: I'm sure. She just hasn't been very nice to me. She's not going to run straight to Adriana and tell her how Rex was defending my honor with Jared, is she?",
        "Marcie: No, look, your honor does not need defending, okay? Layla knows Adriana has nothing to worry about. She's getting married in a few weeks and I'm sure she's happier than she's ever been in her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, Adriana, what's so terrible? Uh -- so what? Maybe -- maybe you weren't anticipating a trip to Paris, but -- but, I mean, your -- your career is now flourishing and you have a brilliant future ahead of you and you are going to be marrying the man you love. Huh -- what's there to be upset about? Oh. I see you, so you might as well look at me. Don't have the nerve to look me in the face? I'll tell you something -- someday when you and Rex finally do have children of your own, you'll understand the depth of a mother's love. Yes. I would do anything for you -- absolutely anything.",
        "Dorian: You know, even if you hate me, I will always love you -- always.",

        "Langston: We're just going in the living room.",
        "Blair: You know, I don't think that's such a good idea. Why don't the two of you head back up to Starr's room, okay? You know, it's -- it's late.",
        "Starr: It's not late at all and we actually still have a lot of homework left to do.",
        "Blair: Well, then you could do it up in Starr's room.",
        "Todd: Actually, she doesn't have to be sequestered to her room. That's all right.",
        "Starr: Aw, thank you.",
        "Blair: Well, I want to talk to you, Starr, okay?",
        "Todd: Well, I would like to talk to you. I know that you're loath to finish this conversation, but I'd like to continue it with you -- now.",
        "Blair: Well, um --",
        "Todd: Now.",
        "Blair: Okay, all right.",
        "Langston: What was that all about? You think she knows?",
        "Starr: No, there's no way that she knows. She wouldn't have gone upstairs. Langston, what is she doing back here? What if they caught Cole? What if he's here already?",
        "Langston: Well, go check.",

        "Viki: Well, job interviews are stressful. I had fun.",

        "Talia: Were we talking too loudly for you? Is -- is that the problem, Antonio?",
        "Antonio: You know, Officer Sahid, this isn't Cherryvale. You quit, then you unquit, then you left, and then you came back. My advice is that you make up your mind what you want, and then start taking your job seriously.",
        "Talia: Huh.",
        "Ramsey: I send you on a robbery investigation, you come back with kittens.",
        "[Ramsey laughs]",
        "John: What, you don't like cats? We got a good image from the convenience store surveillance camera. We I.D.'d the perp, and there's a couple uniforms out picking him up right now.",

        "Ramsey: She got potential, long as you keep things professional.",
        "John: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Ramsey: When emotions get involved, people get killed. I shouldn't have to tell you that, but I don't think you've learned that lesson yet.",
        "John: I'm not getting into it with you about Caitlin again.",
        "Ramsey: I'm not talking about Caitlin, John. I'm talking about Marty Saybrooke. Now, you can blame me, you can blame the system, you can blame everybody else. The fact is, both those ladies hooked up with you and both wound up dead, John. That's the kiss of death.",

        "Starr: I am now.",
        "Cole: I should've never left you over at Langston's house that night.",
        "Starr: Cole, you had to. My dad almost killed you. Does that hurt?",
        "Cole: Shh. Not as much as not being able to see you.",
        "Starr: Look, about what I wrote in that letter, I was -- I was just afraid of what my dad would do to you, okay? I didn't mean a word of it -- you know that, right?",

        "Talia: Thanks, I read the handbook. John and I were just joking around. I don't see what the big deal is.",
        "Antonio: Never mind.",
        "John: You know, I'm just here to protect and serve the people of this town -- mostly from guys like you. So I'll work with you, but I'm not going to listen to any more of your personal crap.",
        "Ramsey: You work for me. And you will take as much personal crap as I choose to dish out. You make one mistake, your badge is mine -- this time, for good.",

        "Cole: And John knows that, too. He said that he would protect me. Anyhow, the case is closed.",
        "Blair: That was way before Lee Ramsey became police commissioner, and he saw the whole thing. If Todd gives him enough ammunition to reopen the case, he would be happy to do that and I'm not saying this to scare you, I'm saying it because you need to know what you are up against.",

        "Jared: No, no. God, of course not. I -- I just know that you didn't want anyone to know, so \u0096",
        "Gigi: And now, pretty much everyone I've met in this town has gotten the blow- by-blow. So yeah, things are going to be a little awkward at work for a while. Oh, well.",
        "Jared: Yeah. Well, with me, too, if that's any consolation.",

        "Dorian: I will apologize to Rex. I'll even sign off on Roxy's concept for the wedding -- you know, the gambling casino, the champagne spewing out of fountains, poker chips as favors.",
        "Adriana: What you will do, since you're so good at controlling other people's lives, is make sure nothing stops this wedding from taking place.",
        "Dorian: I don't understand.",
        "Adriana: I think you do. If I don't marry Rex, I'll never speak to you again.",
        "Dorian: But what if Rex's feelings change -- or yours, for that matter? I have no control over that.",
        "Adriana: Well, they better not change. If Rex and I don't get married on May 9, I will leave for Paris and never come back. Who knows? Maybe I'll marry Jean-Pierre. He's certainly made his interest known.",
        "Dorian: Jean-Pierre?",

        "Adriana: Not yet.",
        "Dorian: You would -- you would get involved with a sycophant like Jean-Pierre just to spite me?",
        "Adriana: If I lose Rex, I don't care who I wind up with. At least Jean-Pierre could distract me from my broken heart, but I don't need to worry about that, do I, Mom? Because you're going to make sure of it.",

        "Blair: We're all on her side, Todd. And I know that you think it's like \"out of sight, out of mind.\" But what if it's \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\"? Please, do not push her. You might push her away forever.",

        "Langston: So -- so what are you going to do?",
        "Starr: You know what? I'm going to see him tonight because I can't imagine not being able to hold him or to kiss him. I can't imagine -- I -- I would die if my dad hurt him. But I would die if I had to say goodbye to him.",

        "Layla: No -- Gigi.",
        "Dorian: Gigi?",
        "Layla: Yeah. I guess Jared kissed Gigi at work and Rex thought he was taking advantage of her, and -- you know what? I'm really sorry, and I don't want to cause any more problems between you and Rex. It's just, girl, I just thought you should know.",
