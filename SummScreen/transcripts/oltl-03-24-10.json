        "Schuyler reveals to Tea that Alison Perkins kidnapped Sierra Rose and warned him not to call the police. Tea says they have to call the police because Allison probably killed the social worker she was impersonating. She tells him that as an officer of the court, it is her duty to report a crime but he talks her out of it. After the custody hearing has been postponed at Schuyler's request, Gigi tells Rex that confronting Schuyler will not help her get custody of Sierra Rose. Kimberly arrives and tells them that the hearing is a waste of time because Stacy said she wanted Kim to raise her child. When Gigi tells her that she doesn't have a chance, she informs them that the high-power lawyers that her new husband Clint Buchanan hired have a different opinion. Dorian runs into Kimberly at the courthouse and is shocked to discover that Kimberly and Clint are married. Rex goes to the police station and tells Bo to stop Clint and Kimberly from pursuing custody of Stacy's baby. Gigi goes to Schuyler's apartment.",
        "Todd overhears Kelley asking about tracing a call. She reveals that a man called her about her mother's death. Todd hires a private detective to look into it. Dorian goes to the Sun and expresses her disapproval of Kelly working with Todd. Jessica continues to pursue Cristian. He continues to keep her at arms length. Brody asks Cristian to keep an eye on Jessica because Alison Perkins is out. Bo and John discuss Alison Perkins' escape. Bo tells John that he thinks Alison is awaiting instructions from Mitch Laurence. Bo notices that Roxy went to visit Mitch twice in one day, so he asks the guard to identity the visitor from a picture. He doesn't quite recognize Roxy or Alison. When he sees a picture of Alison's face with Roxy's hair superimposed, he confirms her as the visitor. Alison is at Foxy Roxy's Salon with a gun when Natalie goes there to see Roxy. Roxy suggests that Natalie come back another time but Natalie refuses. Natalie finds Sierra Rose and demands to know whose baby she is. Roxy says she is babysitting. Natalie notices the baby blanket has \"Sierra Rose\" embroidered on it and figures out that it is Schuyler's daughter. Roxy tells Natalie to leave, but Natalie picks up the phone to call Bo. Alison pulls her gun on Natalie and tells her it is great to see her again for the last time."

        "Kelly: No. I told you that number did not come up. Isn't there any way to trace it? Never mind. Forget it.",
        "Todd: What was that about?",
        "Kelly: None of your business.",
        "Todd: Oh, I'm sorry. This is my newspaper, and you're on the clock, so that makes it my business.",
        "Kelly: Some guy called me the other day and wanted to talk about my mother's death.",
        "Todd: What about it?",
        "Kelly: Never found out. He heard someone coming and hung up.",
        "Todd: But I thought your mom died of a heart attack.",
        "Kelly: That's not what Dorian thinks. She's positive that Mitch Laurence was behind it.",
        "Todd: Wasn't he in Statesville?",
        "Kelly: He's never had any trouble finding people to do his dirty work. Why should this time be different?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "John: What's up, Bo?",
        "Bo: Allison Perkins.",
        "John: One of my all-time favorite psychos.",
        "Bo: Huh. Remember the coma that she was supposedly in?",
        "John: Mm-hmm?",
        "Bo: Seems it wasn't as bad as we thought that it was.",
        "John: She escaped?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Now I got to call Natalie and Jess, too. I mean, everything that this woman has put them through, we can't take any chances.",
        "John: You know, Allison Perkins was threatening to expose some sort of big secret. Never found out what it was.",
        "Bo: Yeah, something to do with the family. But at least now, we get a chance to question her, soon as we find out where the hell she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You said Phillips, right?",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Jessica: Anything I can do?",
        "Cristian: That's okay. Thanks. I got it covered. Jessica. Oh. Looks like you have a stage crew of one.",
        "Cristian: I put the word out for volunteers.",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, can I be the first?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, wait. I don't think we should go running over to Schuyler's. It'll be just like when you went over there by yourself, and I don't think another fight is going to help me get custody.",
        "Rex: But if he's taking off with the baby--",
        "Gigi: I know I said that, but the more I think about it, I don't think he would do that, not before the case is settled. Right now, he still has a chance of keeping her.",
        "Rex: Unless he knows there's a reason the judge would rule against him and he's afraid of it coming out in court.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Schuyler. Oh, my God, kidnapping?",
        "Schuyler: I shouldn't have told you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that what was going on when you--you wouldn't open the door? There was someone here?",
        "Schuyler: She came, and she took her, and there was nothing--there was nothing I could do.",
        "T\u00e9a: Who, Schuyler? Who took Sierra?",
        "Schuyler: She warned me, okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. I don't care what she said. If you do not tell me, you will never see her again. Who did this?",
        "Schuyler: Her name is Allison Perkins, and I have no idea where she took my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Roxy, where is that coming from?",
        "Roxy: What that? I don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Natalie: The baby. What else?",
        "Roxy: Honey, I told you, we're not even open. I'm just doing a favor for an old client. So we'll talk tomorrow, okay?",
        "Natalie: No, we're gonna talk now. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Oh, I'm glad Viki's out of the country. I left messages for Natalie and Jessica both.",
        "John: How long ago did Allison escape?",
        "Bo: A few weeks.",
        "John: Weeks. Wasn't the hospital supposed to contact us if she so much as flinched?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, I guess when their so-called \"maximum security\" failed, they all started trying to cover their asses. But, uh, somebody let it slip.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Come in.",
        "Brody: We got a call to come in for a briefing?",
        "John: Yeah. We got a mental patient on the loose.",
        "Brody: Who?",
        "Bo: Allison Perkins.",
        "Brody: Mitch Laurence's Allison Perkins?",
        "Bo: Afraid so.",
        "Brody: Is Jessica okay?",
        "Bo: Far as I know. I put in a call to her and Natalie, too. You know, they need to know just in case Allison tries to make contact.",
        "Brody: Do we know if she's armed?",
        "John: She had enough time. So I think we can assume the answer is yes, armed and dangerous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Roxy, where is the baby, and why are you pretending it doesn't exist?",
        "Roxy: I'm not pretending about nothing.",
        "Natalie: You're not?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Why would I be pretending?",
        "[Natalie gasps]",
        "Roxy: I wouldn't be pretending about nothing. You know that.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry, you little sweetie. Oh. Is that better? You don't seem surprised.",
        "Roxy: Oh, I didn't realize you meant that baby. Cute kid, huh? You know, someday, maybe I'll make her a blonde.",
        "Natalie: Roxy, whose is she? Who does this baby belong to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Maybe Schuyler really did have babysitter problems. It's happened to me enough times.",
        "Rex: Why are you defending him, Morasco?",
        "Gigi: I'm just trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Rex: The guy is fighting you for custody.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and he could win. Let's face it; the judge could rule that Sierra has to stay with her father.",
        "Kim: No freaking way. Why aren't you in the courtroom?",
        "Gigi: Schuyler couldn't make it. The hearing has been postponed for 24 hours.",
        "Kim: Just as well. It would have been a big waste of time.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Kim: Because I'm the one who's gonna be raising Stacy's baby.",
        "Gigi: Ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: She injected me with...something.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you lost consciousness?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. That's when she took Sierra. God, I got to--I have to get her back. I got to get her back.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. Did Allison Perkins say anything, anything at all, that could have indicated where they were headed?",
        "Schuyler: I don't--I don't know. I don't remember most of what she said. Most of it was-was pretty crazy! I mean, she was trying to tell me that Sierra was connected to Mitch Laurence-",
        "T\u00e9a: How?",
        "Schuyler: I don't know.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. We have to call Bo.",
        "Schuyler: No, wait! Stop. Stop. Stop. Look, look, look, look.",
        "Allison: Oh, what a cutie. Yeah. Why, this little munchkin could give the Olsen twins a run for their money. Yeah. That is, if she lives long enough. Ha ha ha! Oh, don't worry. She's gonna be fine. Dad, as long as you don't call the cops or do anything stupid like tell someone what's up.",
        "Schuyler: She said she would call me back with further instructions. Please, don't. Please?",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, Schuyler, when Allison took Jessica and Natalie, it was years before Viki even knew she had another daughter. Is that how long you want to wait to see your daughter again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Look, Jess. I appreciate the offer, don't get me wrong, but I don't think it's a good idea for us to work together outside the classroom.",
        "Jessica: But I was kind of depending on this to put on my list of activities for on my college application.",
        "Cristian: If you're serious about college, I don't think they'll get too hung up on your extracurricular activities.",
        "Jessica: Huh. Well, I wonder how my Uncle Todd's gonna feel when he finds out that you're refusing me as a volunteer.",
        "Cristian: Because of his donations to the arts program?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. It would be a shame if he took back all that money.",
        "Cristian: So, what, are you gonna blackmail me now?",
        "Jessica: No, Mr. Vega. I just want you to admit that you are afraid to be alone with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Problem is, the call came from an unavailable number.",
        "Todd: It was probably just someone trying to sell you something.",
        "Kelly: No, this was not a telemarketer. This guy wanted to talk about my mother's death. I mean, why would he hang up if he heard someone coming?",
        "Todd: Oh...well, it is illegal to harass the family members of someone who has died.",
        "Kelly: Nope. There has to be more to it than that.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Or maybe you're just paranoid. Living with Dorian will do that to someone.",
        "Kelly: I didn't even tell Dorian about this.",
        "Dorian: Well, she found out about it, anyway. And I'm here to do something about it.",
        "Kelly: Did you get a call?",
        "Dorian: No, Blair told me.",
        "Kelly: He called Blair?",
        "Dorian: Blair was right here when it happened.",
        "Kelly: What exactly are you talking about?",
        "Dorian: This! The insanity of you taking a job here. What are you talking about?",
        "Kelly: I guess I was hoping you'd be glad I was staying around.",
        "Dorian: Sweetheart, of course. I'm absolutely thrilled and so grateful that you're not going back to London. I just wish you didn't have to forfeit so much of your self-respect.",
        "Todd: She's not forfeiting anything. I made her a sweet deal.",
        "Dorian: Well, no matter what it is, it's not worth it. If she cares anything about her family, she'll walk away from it.",
        "Todd: I don't think so. Kelly made this decision of her own free will.",
        "Kelly: Kelly can speak for herself, thank you very much.",
        "Dorian: Excellent. You've come to your senses. Tell you what, I'll buy you lunch to celebrate.",
        "Kelly: I'm not leaving, Dorian. I work here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm not afraid to be alone with you, Jess, but every time that happens, you end up in tears.",
        "Jessica: Okay. I understand that I've had a hard time adjusting, but I know that you have a life now and some of it went on without me. I get that.",
        "Cristian: You do?",
        "Jessica: Well, the Natalie thing was a little bit of a shock, but we talked about it.",
        "Jessica's voice: Does it bother you?",
        "Natalie: Does what bother me?",
        "Jessica: Stealing someone's boyfriend.",
        "Jessica: And I feel a lot better that it's out in the open.",
        "Jessica: Maybe there is something you can do.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Name it.",
        "Jessica: Help me get Cristian back.",
        "Jessica: Well, you keep telling me that I have to move on.",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Jessica: All I'm asking for is a chance to show you that I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You're not raising my sister's baby.",
        "Kim: Think again. Guess who filed these papers.",
        "Rex: On what grounds?",
        "Kim: On the grounds that it's what Stacy wanted. She told me so. She told you, too, Rex, remember?",
        "Rex: Uh, maybe she mentioned it once--",
        "Gigi: You don't have a prayer, Kim. I'm a blood relative. So is Schuyler. And you--you are nothing where Sierra is concerned.",
        "Kim: My legal team has a different take on it.",
        "Gigi: Legal team?",
        "Kim: Granderson, Granderson, and Moore.",
        "Rex: Yeah, right.",
        "Kim: They're representing me, moron. Get used to it. My husband's actually meeting with them right now.",
        "Gigi: Your what?",
        "Kim: Wow. You two really do need to get out more. Like the bling? Courtesy of Clint Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I don't think this is like what happened to Jessica and Natalie. I think Allison wants something.",
        "T\u00e9a: What, like a ransom?",
        "Schuyler: Well, yeah, what else?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I don't know. But if she wants money, you don't have any. You are in way over your head here. What's this?",
        "Schuyler: Social worker's I.D. That's who Allison pretended to be. That's how she got in here.",
        "T\u00e9a: But what happened to the real Melanie Pacifico?",
        "Schuyler: I don't want to know.",
        "T\u00e9a: Schuyler, this woman could be lying dead somewhere! We have to call the police!",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah, and so Allison will freak out and hurt my daughter? I can't do that, T\u00e9a.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: She belongs to a client of mine. I'm babysitting. You know, I need a couple of bucks.",
        "Natalie: Okay. So why didn't you just say that from the beginning? Why'd you have to lie about it?",
        "Roxy: Well, you know, I'm not supposed to have kids here. You know...ahem. There's a lot of chemicals in here and stuff, so I'm trying to keep things on the lowdown.",
        "Natalie: Right. So these chemicals--why don't I smell them? Roxy, what is going on here? And you might as well tell me the truth because you know I'm gonna find out, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Did Jessica get back to you?",
        "Bo: No. That was Fish. He was patrolling out by Llanfair, so I asked him to swing by, check things out.",
        "Brody: Let's make sure Natalie's okay. Jessica's probably still at school.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Brody: What's that?",
        "Bo: This is everything recovered from Allison Perkins after she was apprehended.",
        "John: Is that the, uh, disc that's supposed to bust everything wide open?",
        "Bo: That's what she claimed. You know, maybe this has a message from Laurence on it.",
        "John: The big announcement that he's back from the grave?",
        "Bo: Yeah, or that he's Rex Balsom's father. You know, that would have an impact on the family, too.",
        "John: No reason to deliver it now, right?",
        "Bo: So now she's waiting for more instructions.",
        "John: Yeah, if she remembers what happened. Any chance the coma scrambled her brains?",
        "Bo: Wouldn't matter where Allison's concerned, you know? I mean, she thinks that Mitch is the only reason for her to live.",
        "John: Hmm. So we assume that he's still pulling her strings?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, she wouldn't make a move without him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What's going on here, Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Okay, kiddo. You're right. You know, I'm trying to get rid of you, and I'm sorry. But, uh, I'll make it up to you.",
        "Natalie: Honey, I don't want an apology. I want to know why you lied.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Is this your vision for your future? Working under the thumb of this unethical, morally bankrupt man?",
        "Kelly: I am not under anyone's thumb, including yours.",
        "Dorian: Oh! I see. The best defense is an offense? Kelly. Honey, I'm just trying to do what your mother would want.",
        "Kelly: My mother would want me to work hard and take care of myself, both of which I can do right here at \"The Sun.\"",
        "Dorian: There are other jobs.",
        "Kelly: I like this one.",
        "Todd: And we like having you on our team.",
        "Dorian: Oh, spare us, please. We both know exactly why you want Kelly to work for you, and it has nothing to do with her value to your team.",
        "Todd: What's it about, then?",
        "Dorian: You're trying to make Blair crazy, and what better way than to offer Blair's old job to her cousin? Not that you aren't eminently qualified, darling.",
        "Kelly: Well, you don't have to tell me that, Dorian. My blog, which you find so amusing, has more hits every day than this paper can sell in a week. No offense.",
        "Todd: None taken.",
        "Kelly: This is business, Dorian.",
        "Todd: Yes, and I'm a businessman, Dorian. I don't hire people to piss off ex- wives.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please.",
        "Todd: No, no. Look. She's smart. She's...she's talented. Worth every cent I'm paying her.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I see. And is this an example of your collaboration? \"Morasco fiasco! Who'll get stripper's kid?\" Wow! Whew. That's class.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You married Clint Buchanan?",
        "Kim: Clint gets how much Stacy meant to me, and we're both gonna make sure that Sierra has the life her mother always wanted for her.",
        "Gigi: With you?",
        "Kim: I was her best friend.",
        "Gigi: That does not make you a mother.",
        "Kim: Oh, I can learn. Clint and I are gonna make sure that she has everything a child could possibly want.",
        "Gigi: So you think money is the only thing that will make a kid happy?",
        "Rex: No, but it's the only thing Kim needs. Sierra Rose is your ticket, huh? You go to Clint. \"Aw, how am I gonna raise this poor child?\" Bam! Suddenly, there's a ring on your finger.",
        "Kim: Okay, think whatever you want. The judge knows what's gonna be best for little Sierra: A home with two parents who can give her a hell of a lot more than she's got right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, tell me, what is the story with this baby, Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Well, um, sorry. I mean, I didn't mean to lie to you. It's just that I thought, um...you really want to know? I thought maybe you shouldn't be around a little bundle of joy because of Marty expecting and everything.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Really? You thought that it would be hard for me?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, and I don't want to rub sauce into old wounds.",
        "Natalie: Ooh, that's really sweet, Rox, but I'm okay.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, we're not gonna push it, you know, because another couple of minutes, and you get all gushy inside when you--with that little nugget. So I think you better skedaddle.",
        "Natalie: I'm okay, honestly. I'm fine. I'm not jealous about the baby. Honestly, when John and I were together, I didn't really think much of having kids. I just figured he'd be too busy chasing the bad guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Keeping track of Laurence's visitors since he got to Statesville.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Dorian Lord, Roxanne Balsom, Brody Lovett...you went to see Laurence?",
        "Brody: I did, once.",
        "John: About what?",
        "Brody: What he did to Jessica.",
        "Bo: Did you get anything out of him?",
        "Brody: Nothing except more of his mind games.",
        "Bo: Ah.",
        "Brody: You don't have to say it. I know.",
        "Bo: You know, I don't see Allison's name on here.",
        "John: She's not. I'm having the surveillance tapes sent over. Maybe they'll tell us more.",
        "Brody: Like what?",
        "Bo: Allison's very familiar with Statesville.",
        "John: She was a prisoner there several years ago.",
        "Bo: Yeah, and her father used to be the warden, so she practically grew up there.",
        "Brody: She'd know how to get around their security.",
        "John: Yeah. Maybe she found a way to communicate with Laurence that we haven't thought of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You're my attorney, T\u00e9a. You're not supposed to call the cops without my permission.",
        "T\u00e9a: Attorney-client privilege only applies to your custody case. This is a kidnapping.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Okay. Can we just--can we hold off just a little longer?",
        "T\u00e9a: I am an officer of the court. This is a crime. It is my duty to report it. I'm obliged to report it.",
        "Schuyler: Ohh.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Uh, Commissioner Bo Buchanan, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: All right, we know that Allison tried to pass herself off as a nurse, as a nurse's aide. She posed as Niki Smith.",
        "John: Yeah. We're dealing with a real master of disguise here.",
        "Brody: Usually as a way to gain access to Jessica.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but luckily, everybody in Jess' life knows what Allison looks like.",
        "Brody: Everyone at the high school?",
        "Bo: Check over there, see if they have a picture of Allison. If they don't, then you give them one.",
        "Brody: I'm on it.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Bo: Buchanan. Yeah. Fish, did you see Natalie or Jessica? All right. Make sure that she knows to keep you posted. Okay. No, I'm sure that if Allison tried to contact Nat or Jess, that we'd know about it. Thanks, Fish.",
        "John: No sign of them at Llanfair?",
        "Bo: No. No, you--Brody was right. Jessica's at school. Lois says that--that Natalie left this morning. She's out running errands.",
        "John: No one's talked to her since?",
        "Bo: It's only been an hour or so.",
        "John: Uh-huh. Her phone's still turned off. Hey. Uh, Natalie, it's John. Um, call me as soon as you can. It's about Allison Perkins.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know, with John, work always came first, which I completely understood, and I guess that's why I thought that we were--what am I doing? What am I doing? Oh, my God. I can't believe I'm rehashing this. John is going to be a father. He's about to have a baby. I mean, he's in a completely different universe.",
        "Roxy: Oh, you know, you're so right. You can't keep on beating a dead hearse. And what's done can't be undone. Listen, baby. I got to get back to my customers.",
        "Natalie: What's wrong, baby? It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Roxy: You know, she probably dropped her binky. No, no, it's okay. You know, I'll find it, and then I'll plug her up again.",
        "Natalie: Ooh, goodness! Goodness. Is that better? Where did you get those beautiful blue eyes? Huh? You're like Hollywood material, you know that? Yes, you are. What's her name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You don't have to prove anything to me, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Well, you seem to think that I can't handle working with you, and I know that I can. So let's put it to the test.",
        "Cristian: Or we could just play it safe and stay out of each other's way.",
        "Jessica: You don't think it's safe to be alone with me?",
        "Cristian: I don't want to lead you on.",
        "Jessica: Cristian, you're not listening. I'm up to speed now. I understand that you're with Layla, and I'm going out with someone else, too.",
        "Cristian: You're--with who?",
        "Jessica: Brody. He asked me out on a date. I was moping around feeling sorry for myself, and he showed up, and we hung out for a little while.",
        "Brody: Ooh! Not sore and not a loser. That ties us up, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, you don't get a point for stating the obvious.",
        "Brody: No, just for outplaying you.",
        "Jessica: Big deal. I can make that shot in my sleep. It was really fun. You know, Brody's way cooler than I thought he was, and we talked for a really long time.",
        "Brody: Oh! Look at that. Too bad, Jess. Looks like we got to go on that date.",
        "Jessica: So I decided to give him a chance.",
        "Cristian: Glad to hear that.",
        "Jessica: So can we please go back to normal now? You know, before you were my boyfriend, you were my friend, right?",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Jessica: And I could really use a friend right now, Cristian, and I would really love to help with the play. So why don't you just let me?",

        "Gigi: Your hotshot legal team?",
        "Kim: My decorator. I'll see you in the courtroom. Donatelli, ciao.",
        "Gigi: Tell me I am dreaming. Tell me that piece of trash did not just buy herself a baby with Clint Buchanan's money.",
        "Rex: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Gigi: How do you know?",
        "Rex: I'm gonna make sure of it.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I would not like to continue to hold. Tell the commissioner it's T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "Schuyler: Can--can we at least find out what Allison wants before the cops show up with guns and make her do God knows what? I'm begging you here. I'm begging you.",
        "Bo: Buchanan.",
        "Schuyler: T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a, what if it was your daughter? Would you take the chance of her getting hurt?",
        "Bo: Hello, T\u00e9a. You there?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, yes. Yes, I'm here, Bo. I...I had a question, and, um...and someone else just answered it. Thank you very much.",
        "Schuyler: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I just hope to hell we don't live to regret this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So you talked to one of the guards about Dorian and Roxy?",
        "Brody: Yeah, a guy named Richard Evans. He I.D.'d both of them from photos.",
        "John: Let me see this sign-in sheet again. Yeah, that's strange. Roxanne Balsom came 3 times.",
        "Brody: Twice on the same day, February 26.",
        "John: Yeah. You know, that's just--it's weird, especially when you look at the times, you know? It's like she--she left and then came right back.",
        "Brody: Yeah, right after the guards' shift change.",
        "John: Yeah. I think we need to figure out why Roxy had so much business with Mitch Laurence.",
        "Brody: Hey, you mind if I head out for a little while first? There's something I need to check on.",
        "John: Yeah? You got another lead?",
        "Brody: Jessica.",
        "John: I thought you called the high school.",
        "Brody: Yeah. They said she attended classes.",
        "John: You're worried.",
        "Brody: Figured I could go over there, let her know what's going on.",
        "John: Go on, get out of here. I'll call you if I need anything.",

        "Roxy: Uh...her name is Angel. It's cute, huh?",
        "Natalie: Sure fits. You know, looking into her beautiful eyes, I just have to wonder how Jessica could look at Bree and not remember holding her like this.",
        "Roxy: She's still running empty in the memory department?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Got into a big fight because of it.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, I would love to hear all about this, but I--",
        "Natalie: Did you know, she found out that I was married to Cris, and then she lost it, and then she accused me of being a boyfriend-stealer--first hers and now Marty's.",
        "Roxy: Wow! She really said that?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, and it got me really upset. That's why I came to talk to you.",
        "Roxy: To talk to me? Why talk to me? You should be working it out with her.",
        "Natalie: She won't listen.",
        "Roxy: Well, you know, you don't know till you try, right? So, you know, you got to do that. You got to go home. You got to go home right now. And I'm not taking no for an answer.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Okay. I just got to set you down, little sweetie. Yes. Watch your head. Watch your head. Oh! Goodness. Get you all warm there. What's this?",

        "Dorian: \"Custody squabble over budding striplette Sierra Rose\"? Honestly, is this the way to write about an innocent baby?",
        "Todd: Dorian, don't you have anything better to do than deprive you niece of the best job she's ever had?",
        "Kelly: Dorian, I'd like to get back to work.",
        "Dorian: Fine. I have work of my own that I need to do. There you go, dear. I'll see you at home for dinner. Perhaps by then, you will have come to your senses.",
        "Kelly: Dorian, I am right where I want to be.",
        "Dorian: Oil and water do not mix. You are the kindest, dearest person in the world. You don't have a mean bone in your body. But Todd...is Todd.",
        "Kelly: Is it so unthinkable to her that I might actually know what I'm doing?",
        "Todd: Oh, I think you know what you're doing, all right. I notice you didn't tell her about that call you got.",
        "Kelly: Why give her something else to get hysterical about? Especially if there's no way to find out where that call came from.",
        "Todd: I wouldn't give up just yet.",
        "Todd: Just do what you have to do. I don't care. How much did I pay her last time? Double it. Okay.",
        "Kelly: I'm not sure what good a P.I. is gonna be if that call can't be traced.",
        "Todd: Sometimes you just have to know the right people.",

        "Kelly: Why are you doing this for me?",
        "Todd: Uh... well, I just don't want you distracted by personal issues right now when we have so much work to do. So are you ready to kick some butt or what?",
        "Kelly: Oh, I thought you'd never ask.",

        "Kim: Why?",
        "Kim: I don't owe you any answers. I don't owe you a damn thing.",
        "Gigi: Maybe not, but you owe that baby, and you're gonna come up short, Kim, because you're a lot of things, but one thing you're not is mommy material.",
        "Kim: I made a promise to Stacy.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, but you're not her sister, though, are you? That would be me.",
        "Kim: Okay. You can call yourself whatever you want, but when Stacy was alive, I was more of a sister to her than you ever were. I am gonna give that baby a fantastic life.",
        "Gigi: You mean you're gonna give her a bank account.",
        "Kim: It pays the bills, and after all that time in the hospital, that kid's got bills up the wazoo. You gonna swing that on your waitress salary? Ha! Schuyler can't even pay for med school. My God, if you two really care about little Sierra, then you'll give her to people who can treat her right, and that's Mr. and Mrs. Clint Buchanan.",

        "Brody: Actually, I'm here to talk to Cristian. Is there somewhere we can talk?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Yeah, sure. Let's go over here. Look. Jessica showed up to volunteer for the stage crew. I told her I didn't think it was a good idea.",
        "Brody: No, no, actually, it's a great idea.",
        "Cristian: What do you mean?",
        "Brody: Allison Perkins escaped from the hospital.",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Brody: Yeah. I don't want to tell Jessica because it might trigger memories of Mitch and what he tried to do to her.",
        "Cristian: But you want to make sure Allison doesn't try anything?",
        "Brody: Right, and I'm gonna be tied up with the search. I've got a call out to Marty, but in the meantime, if you can stick close to Jessica and keep an eye on her, I'd appreciate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So, Sal, Monday through Friday, you have the shift after Richard Evans, right? Yeah. Now, a woman named Roxanne Balsom visited Mitch Laurence on the afternoon of February 26 twice. Susan, do you have the photo of Ms. Balsom?",
        "Susan: Sure thing.",
        "John: I want you to look at this picture. Is that the woman you saw, Sal?",
        "Sal: Yeah, but, uh...",
        "John: You're not sure?",
        "Sal: It's probably the woman I saw, but she... she looked different.",
        "John: Susan, different picture, please.",
        "Susan: Okay.",
        "John: Sal, have a look. Is that the woman?",

        "Natalie: \"Sierra Rose.\" I know that name from somewhere. [Gasp] Oh! Oh, is this--is this Schuyler and Stacy's baby?",
        "Roxy: Are you serious? Why would I be babysitting that kid?",
        "Natalie: Explain to me why a baby named Angel has a blanket that says \"Sierra Rose.\"",
        "Roxy: Because Angel is her nickname. I mean, Sierra Rose is her real name, but it's not the same Sierra Rose that you were thinking of.",
        "Natalie: Roxy, cut the crap. We both know that it's near impossible that there would be another child with that same name.",
        "Roxy: Okay. Well, uh, you know, Schuyler had a problem, and I'm helping him baby-sit.",
        "Natalie: Schuyler knows how much you hate him. There is absolutely no way--",
        "Roxy: Oh, Natalie, would you just get the hell out of here? It's a long story, but it's nothing to worry about, and I will explain, but later. I promise.",
        "Natalie: All right. You don't want to talk to me, that's fine. Maybe you could just talk to Uncle Bo!",
        "Allison: Put the phone away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, \"Morasco fiasco,\" that's genius, right? But do you have any suggestions on the art? Because I'm just not sure about that.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. This is disgusting.",
        "Todd: You didn't seem to think so when Dorian was here.",
        "Kelly: Well, that's because it wasn't her business. This is our business. And starting now, our business is going to change...for the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I'm doing what you want, girlfriend. Me and my new hubby are gonna get your baby everything her little heart desires, and I don't even have to mention Schuyler's name. Nobody has to know he's not the daddy. That would just open up a whole nother can of worms with our friend Fish. No, Clint's gonna be Sierra's new daddy, and Fish will be out of the picture, just like you wanted. I really miss you, Stace. If I live to be a million, I'll never have another friend like you.",
        "Dorian: And where is James? I'm the mayor of this town. I should not be wandering around, um, on my own. Make sure that doesn't happen again. Bye. Excuse me. I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.",
        "Kim: Heh! Kimberly.",
        "Dorian: Kimberly. I just want to say that I am very sorry about your friend.",
        "Kim: Thanks. That's nice.",
        "Dorian: You can call me Mayor Lord. As mayor, it's part of my job to feel your pain.",
        "Kim: I didn't know that. I got to go. Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute. Just sit still. Oh, wow! Pardon me. Heh! But it's just, uh, I really did think that I had gotten rid of all the illegal vendors in Angel Square. Though I've got to say, that is one heck of a knockoff.",
        "Kim: What are you calling a knockoff? This is the real thing.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha ha! Oh, really? Do you have any idea how much the real thing would cost you?",
        "Kim: Clint Buchanan doesn't care what things cost. He just cares that his wife is happy. And, honey, let me tell you, I am as happy as happy gets.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me? Did you say that you are married to Clint?",

        "Cristian: Yeah. Yeah, sure.",
        "Brody: Okay. Thanks, man. I got to get back to work. I'll call you soon about that date.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Bye.",

        "Brody: Bye.",
        "Jessica: So what was that all about? You stealing cars again?",
        "Cristian: There has been some vandalism outside the high school. Brody just wanted me to keep an eye out. Listen, about the stage crew, if you're still interested, I could use the help.",
        "Jessica: Definitely. Just get me a paintbrush, and I'm all yours.",
        "Cristian: Okay. It's--I need to measure it.",

        "Sal: That's her. That's the woman I signed in.",
