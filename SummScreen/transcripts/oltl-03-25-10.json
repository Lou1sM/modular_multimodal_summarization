        "Allison holds Natalie and Roxy at gunpoint so that they do not tell John that she has escaped. She has baby Sierra with her although they cannot figure out what she'd want with her now that they know she is not related to Mitch. Starr is able to put two and two together and figure out that Langston's big secret is that she's sleeping with Ford. And Markko is ready to do the same. Schuyler and Tea do not know what to do after Allison has taken baby Sierra or what to tell Rex and Gigi."

        "Starr: Mom, school today was awesome. Wait until you see Langston's musical. I know I gave her a hard time, but when you see it, you're going to die!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, hurry up and get dressed. We are lucky somebody hasn't caught us already.",
        "Ford: You know you love it, knowing someone might walk in at any moment.",
        "Langston: Ugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Yeah, it'll be nice to see Cole. I mean, I feel like we've barely spent any time together and had time to relax.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, stranger.",
        "Cole: Dude, you live with me.",
        "Markko: Yeah, I wouldn't know it. Seems like all you have time for lately is working on your sociology project.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's been kind of intense.",
        "Markko: Yeah, which part, the work, or having Hannah as a partner?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: This is disgusting.",
        "Todd: You didn't seem to think so when Dorian was here.",
        "Kelly: Well, that's because it wasn't her business. This is our business. Starting now, our business is going to change--for the better. How would you feel if some rag labeled Cole a druggie, even though he's not using anymore? Okay, bad example. What if some editor called Starr a tramp for getting pregnant in high school?",
        "Todd: This has nothing to do with my daughter, it has to do with my precious front page.",
        "Kelly: Forget about your front page, Todd. You're a father. Don't you have any compassion for what Sierra's father is going through?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gigi knocks on door]",
        "T\u00e9a: What if it's Allison Perkins? Maybe you should answer the door. What are we going to do, hide out in here, huh?",
        "[Knock]",
        "Gigi: Schuyler? Schuyler, are you there? I want to see Sierra Rose. Schuyler, are you in there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So now, Clint and Kim are trying to get custody of Stacy's baby.",
        "Bo: Kim was at the hearing?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Luckily, it was postponed, but she has convinced herself that Stacy would have wanted her to raise her baby in case something ever happened to her--that she'd make a better mother than Gigi.",
        "Bo: And Clint's helping her?",
        "Rex: Oh, he's hired this top-gun law firm to help them get custody. I--I need you to stop them, Bo.",
        "Bo: Sorry, Balsom, but this is bad news.",
        "Rex: Yeah, tell me about it. Fighting Schuyler's bad enough.",
        "Bo: Well, I got something worse.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Bo: Allison Perkins is on the run. And everything that she does, she does for your old man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: That's it. Allison found her way to Lawrence. She disguised herself as Roxy.",
        "Guard: I guess I screwed up. How dangerous is this Perkins woman?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Allison? How is this possible?",
        "Allison: It is.",
        "Natalie: You were in a coma.",
        "Allison: I woke up. And today is the first day of the rest of my life. But it might be the last day of yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What are you trying to say? Hannah's my project partner.",
        "Markko: Yeah, and she's a pretty girl and you've been spending a lot of time with her.",
        "Cole: So?",
        "Markko: Nothing. Forget I said anything.",
        "Cole: I'm with Starr. I mean, we have a kid together.",
        "Markko: I know, I know. It was a stupid thing to say. I'm just--I've been paranoid lately.",
        "Cole: Why?",
        "Markko: Because this weird thing happened with Langston.",
        "Cole: Weird like how?",
        "Markko: I found her in Ford's office.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Excuse me. I'm looking for a friend of Markko's, Cole Thornhart. We were supposed to meet.",
        "Waitress: In the back with Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: And then on her way to L.U., Langston lost a button on her shirt, so she ducked into Ford's office to fix it. But after she left, I found her button right there in Ford's office.",
        "Cole: Okay, so what are you saying?",
        "Markko: It's just--I don't know.",
        "Cole: Okay, so you found Langston's button in Ford's office. So what? I mean, what are you-- wait a second. You don't think there's something going on between Langston and Ford, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Come on, you know you liked the danger, the thrill of doing it right here.",
        "Langston: No, I didn't, I hated it, and it's not happening again.",
        "Ford: That's what you said last time, in my office, but that didn't stop you from taking off your clothes--",
        "Langston: Okay, you know what? You are leaving right now. Come on.",
        "Ford: Okay.",
        "[Ford chuckles]",
        "[Langston gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I think we should leave me and my family out of this.",
        "Kelly: Oh. So they're off-limits?",
        "Todd: This is business.",
        "Kelly: I'm just trying to make you see that these are real people you're slamming here. That's an innocent baby.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I sell papers, Kelly. I don't do blogs, I don't do...texts or twits, or whatever people are doing now. I sell papers. Trash sells papers. Compassion doesn't.",
        "Kelly: You want to talk trash? I can talk trash. I've looked into your sales. They are what I would call trash. \"The Sun\" is barely hanging on by its fingernails.",
        "Todd: I like living on the edge.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, but don't you think it's time to try something other than this sensationalist crap? Something true, something real, something people can relate to? Isn't that why you hired me?",
        "Todd: No, I hired you to piss off my ex-wife.",
        "Kelly: Okay. Keep telling yourself that.",
        "Todd: Okay, well, if you know me so well, why did I hire you?",
        "Kelly: The daughter you had with T\u00e9a thinks you're a monster. You've tried to impress her, you've tried to--I don't know--buy her love. It hasn't worked.",
        "Todd: So hiring you...",
        "Kelly: Was a cry for help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I can't-- I can't see Gigi. I can't--",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, are you just going to keep her out there?",
        "Schuyler: Well, what if she finds out Sierra's been kidnapped? She's going to call the cops.",
        "T\u00e9a: Schuyler--Schuyler--",
        "Gigi: Schuyler!",
        "Schuyler: T\u00e9a--T\u00e9a, you know she will. You know she will, and when that happens, Allison is going to kill Sierra. I need--I need your help.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, are you there? Rachel, are you there? Did Schuy--did Schuyler run away with Sierra? Is that why you're not answering? Just tell me, please.",
        "Schuyler: No, no, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. I'm--I'm here.",
        "Gigi: Then let me in!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Natalie still hasn't turned on her phone. Yeah, this Perkins woman-- she's dangerous. Attempted murder, kidnapping, blackmail.",
        "Guard: I didn't know.",
        "John: Hey, Natalie, when you get this, call me. Look, she's obviously cooked something up with Laurence. Maybe it has something to do with his daughter or son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Is someone keeping an eye on Jessica?",
        "Bo: Yeah, but we're still trying to locate Natalie.",
        "Rex: \"Trying\"? She's just as much a target for Allison as Jessica.",
        "Bo: It's okay, Balsom. John's on it.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Before Allison went into that coma, she was trying to tell her and Jessica something--some secret. Was it that I'm Mitch's son?",
        "Bo: It could have been. But then again, it could have been something more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Think, Sal. Did you overhear any of their conversation? Anything that might tell us what Allison was up to with Laurence?",
        "Sal: I thought it was Roxanne Balsom. I heard she's harmless, so I didn't pay much attention.",
        "Oliver: No, wait. Why would Allison disguise herself as Roxy in the first place? Is there some kind of connection there, something to that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What does she want?",
        "Allison: You're asking that blowup doll?",
        "Natalie: Allison, why--why--why did you come here? Why--why to Roxy's? Are you trying to pick up where you left off a couple of years ago, when you had that secret about me and my family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Last time Allison showed up, Roxy got jumpy. She was afraid of whatever it was Allison had to say.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but Allison never got the chance to say it, because Jared ended up stepping in and putting Allison in that coma, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: I did have a secret, but Jared interfered. But the messenger took good care of him, didn't he? Mitch shot him for me. And now, I'm paying him back, with interest. Ha ha.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Roxy could be the key to finding out more about Allison. And she may know where Natalie is, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Allison, does paying back Mitch have something to do with Schuyler's baby? Is that why you have her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm not leaving until I see my sister's baby. Schuyler, I know you hear me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What does Sierra have to do with this? She's--she's not related to Mitch.",
        "Allison: You're as dense as that dingbat who raised you.",
        "Natalie: Hey, she's not Rex's daughter, okay? So that means that she is not Mitch's grandchild.",
        "Allison: Guess again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We ramped up security at Statesville. Laurence can't even think about escaping.",
        "Rex: So he won't, right?",
        "Bo: But that doesn't mean that things are safe for you.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Could this have come at a worse time?",
        "Bo: I know. A tough time for you. You got a lot on your mind. Gigi's custody battle. Clint, his new wife trying to get the baby.",
        "Rex: Why not throw my psycho father in the mix, too, right?",
        "Bo: I want you to be very careful until we find Allison.",
        "Rex: Yeah, okay.",
        "Bo: Okay, anybody that you love--you know, Gigi, Shane--you keep them close to you.",
        "Oliver: Oh, sorry.",
        "Bo: It's okay, it's okay. Any word?",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "Bo: We're going to get this whole thing under control, Balsom.",
        "Rex: Hey, I am just glad that Stacy's baby is off Mitch's radar, okay? That's the one good thing that came out of Schuyler being Sierra's father instead of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What's wrong?",
        "Schuyler: What do you mean?",
        "Gigi: You didn't show up in court today. I thought...I was scared to death that you took off with Sierra.",
        "Schuyler: Come on, Gigi, you know me. You know I would never do something like that.",
        "Gigi: No, I don't know you at all, and people do crazy things when they feel threatened.",
        "Schuyler: Like your friend Marcie?",
        "Gigi: Her back was against a wall, so she ran.",
        "Schuyler: Hmm. Well, I didn't run.",
        "Gigi: Why didn't you show up in court?",
        "Schuyler: Because my sitter cancelled. That's it. That's all.",
        "Gigi: Huh. I spent months not knowing that every word out of your mouth to me was a lie, and I can't help think that you're lying to me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't use Dani to try to manipulate me. I did you a solid by putting that P.I. on that mystery call you got last night about your mom.",
        "Kelly: And I'm very grateful, but that has nothing to do with my job here.",
        "Todd: Well, you got the call on company time, didn't you?",
        "Kelly: Stop trying to change the subject. This is a story about a father who is trying to do right by his child.",
        "Todd: The father's a drug addict.",
        "Kelly: Used to be. Just like you used to be a lot of things you aren't anymore. Isn't that what you want Dani to know?",
        "Todd: Why do you keep bringing up my kid? That has nothing to do with what we're--",
        "Kelly: Because Schuyler made a mistake. He turned his life around. He redeemed himself for his daughter's sake, just like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hey, you're back.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I'm back.",
        "Langston: Um, Markko is at work at the Buenos Dias, so you can find him there.",
        "Ford: Okay. Thanks. Hmm.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. The place is such a mess. I let it get totally out of control when I was working on the musical.",
        "Starr: Lang?",
        "Langston: Yeah?",
        "Starr: What was Ford doing here?",
        "Langston: Looking for Markko.",
        "Starr: For what?",
        "Langston: I don't know. Some project, probably.",
        "Starr: Well, why didn't he just call him? Why did he have to come see him in person?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: No, Langston's not stepping out on me, I'm just--I'm letting my imagination run wild over some button.",
        "Cole: You can trust Langston.",
        "Markko: I know. I do.",
        "Cole: But Ford? I wouldn't trust the guy as far as I can throw him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So you're taking Joplin's side on this story?",
        "Kelly: This is a news story. We're not supposed to take sides.",
        "Todd: Please...",
        "Kelly: Yeah, we're supposed to report. And right now, we don't know enough.",
        "Todd: Oh, we know plenty. Check this out. So, this drug addict, Schuyler Joplin, hooked up with Gigi Morasco's stripper sister and they had a baby together.",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: And apparently, he let Rex Balsom think it was his.",
        "Kelly: Every outlet has those facts. What sets us apart?",
        "Todd: Our take on it.",
        "Kelly: Take away the trash. What's our take?",
        "Todd: You can't take away the trash. That's my point. Trash is everything.",
        "Kelly: We dig deeper. We dig deeper. We try, we look for more. What made Schuyler turn around? Was it Stacy's death, or was it something else? I need to know these things to write a fair article.",
        "Todd: You want to interview him, don't you?",
        "Kelly: A novel concept for a newspaper, but yes. Yes. I'm going to talk to Schuyler Joplin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I have to see the baby. I need to make sure she's okay.",
        "Schuyler: Gi--Gigi, she's sleep--",
        "Gigi: Where is she?",
        "Schuyler: She's sleeping. She's in the back.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry, Gigi, but as Schuyler's lawyer, I can't allow you to see the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Allison, what are you talking about? How is this baby Mitch's grandchild?",
        "Allison: That's for me to know and you to find out.",
        "Roxy: She even said the baby was related to me.",
        "Natalie: Okay, Allison, listen. Mitch knows that this baby is not Rex's, so you're not doing him any favors by kidnapping her. So why don't you just let me take the baby back to Schuyler and--",
        "Allison: Natalie, you can't trick me.",
        "Natalie: I'm not trying to trick you, I just want to get this baby back home to her father, okay?",
        "Allison: The messenger wants this child.",
        "Natalie: Why?",
        "[Rattling]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: This won't take long. I'll see you later.",
        "Todd: No, I'm coming with you.",
        "Kelly: Uh, no. This is a one-person job.",
        "Todd: Normally, I would agree with you, but drug addicts can be slippery. And I want to make sure that Joplin doesn't snow you like he has everyone else.",
        "Kelly: Don't you think you owe it to Schuyler to just give him a fair shake?",
        "Todd: What for?",
        "Kelly: Oh, I don't know. Didn't you, like, blackmail his mother so you could steal your daughter's baby and raise it with your girlfriend?",
        "Todd: Oh. You really--you really know a lot for someone's who's been out of town because she banged her husband's son.",
        "Kelly: Like you said, this is business. I'm going to do my job. Don't get in my way.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Kelly: Hello?",
        "Man's voice: Kelly Cramer?",
        "Kelly: It's you again. You were telling me something about my mother's death. What is it?",
        "Man's voice: She was murdered.",
        "[Click]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I have no idea why Ford came here looking for Markko, so you'll have to ask him. Okay?",
        "Starr: Okay. Fine.",
        "Langston: And we have to start talking about casting for the musical.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah. Mr. G said that he left it to you.",
        "Langston: Yeah, well, he makes the final decisions, but he said he wanted my input, and trust me, I definitely have some ideas. So... or I could just stare at the floor. What are you even looking at?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Wait, you're the one that talked me out of being jealous about Ford, and now you're saying, what?",
        "Cole: I thought you couldn't stand the guy, anyway?",
        "Markko: Yeah, I got over it. Why do you think Ford's after Langston?",
        "Cole: Look, I'm just saying, the guy is a dog. Look, I wouldn't put it past him to try and get Langston into bed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Ah, it's Johnny! I got to let him in.",
        "Allison: You handle him.",
        "Natalie: Handle him? Nobody handles John.",
        "Allison: You better. Or I'll have to spill mommy dearest's guts all over these mirrors. And there's no telling what I'll do to that kid.",
        "Natalie: No, no, if Mitch wants her, you can't hurt her.",
        "Allison: Ha ha ha. Get rid of him, and don't try anything stupid, or I'll put a bullet in him and you, too. And I promise you, he'll never see it coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Shane's safe. Moe's waiting at the front door of the school to pick him up.",
        "Bo: Good, good. What's the update?",
        "Oliver: Well, John just found out that Allison impersonated Roxy to get in to see Mitch.",
        "Bo: Well, that's something new. What did the guard say?",
        "Oliver: No, the guard on duty didn't hear any of the conversation.",
        "Bo: Well, what about the other guards?",
        "Oliver: We're looking into it.",
        "Rex: Look, we don't need them.",
        "Bo: Balsom--",
        "Rex: Look, Bo, I hate it, but I'm Mitch's son. Jessica and I are the only two people in this world that bastard cares about. Maybe I can find something out.",
        "Bo: What are you talking about?",
        "Rex: Let me see my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So, T\u00e9a runs your life now?",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, you shouldn't be here, Gigi. Schuyler won temporary custody of Sierra Rose. This visit is entirely inappropriate.",
        "Gigi: I'm not talking to you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, listen, Gigi. You're jeopardizing your own chance of custody by being here. Do you think the judge will like the idea of you barging in here, demanding to see the baby?",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, you said I could see her whenever I wanted.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm afraid it wasn't Schuyler's place to tell you that.",
        "Gigi: Okay, forget your lawyer. Forget the court. Forget all this. It's just you and me and this little baby. I'm the closest thing she has to a mother. Please, let me hold her. Before this hearing begins, I want to tell her that I love her, and that Stacy did, too. I owe--I owe it to Stacy. I owe it to myself. And you owe it to me, too, Schuyler. Please, if you ever loved me, you'll just--you'll just let me hold her.",
        "Schuyler: I do love you. I would love nothing more than to be able to put that baby in your arms right now.",
        "Gigi: Okay, then do it.",
        "Schuyler: I can't.",
        "Gigi: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Be quiet for your Roxy.",
        "Natalie: Hey, bad time for a trim.",
        "John: I was thinking about going blond. Where's Roxy?",
        "Natalie: Um...she's not here. You know, I stopped by a little while ago, and she's been AWOL. Not even answering her cell.",
        "John: Neither were you. Did something happen?",
        "Natalie: It's dead. I keep forgetting to charge it.",
        "John: That's it?",

        "John: Not anymore. She escaped the institution.",
        "Natalie: And no one warned us?",
        "John: Well, they tried to cover their asses by not telling anyone. Brody caught up with Jessica. She's okay.",
        "Natalie: Thank God. The last thing she needs to be dealing with is that lunatic.",
        "John: You, too.",
        "Natalie: \"Too\"? Why would you think that Allison would come here?",
        "John: Well, she disguised herself as Roxy to gain access to Mitch Laurence, and I don't think that's a coincidence.",
        "Natalie: Uh, what do you mean?",
        "John: Well, Roxy may know something, or maybe she's in on it, and...at least I thought she could help me find you. So, you haven't seen Allison Perkins?",

        "Gigi: I didn't think it was possible for you to hurt me any more than you already have, but you keep surprising me. Congratulations.",
        "Schuyler: The last thing that I want to do is hurt you. I just--I have--I have to protect this baby, okay?",
        "Gigi: Protect her? From me? You spent months insisting she was Rex's. Were you protecting her then?",

        "Rex: Not even to get in good with me?",
        "Bo: It doesn't matter who you are. Don't try to make a decent father out of this guy. We're talking about Mitch Laurence. And DNA does not make a man a good father. Stepping up-- that's what makes a man a good father.",

        "John: Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. All I know is, the last time she was on the loose, she roped in you and Jessica.",

        "Natalie: I'm--I'm--I'm fine. You know, don't--don't worry about me. Just focus on tracking down Allison.",

        "Natalie: You want me to leave?",
        "John: I just don't want you to get hurt. I know your mom's over visiting your brothers in London, right? It might be a nice time to take a visit. One less target for Allison, one less target for Mitch Laurence.",

        "Langston: Okay. Well, what if Ford had seen it? I mean, I can't imagine what he would have thought.",
        "Starr: Ford would have thought that you were having sex with your boyfriend. It's not some big scandal, Lang.",

It's actually been pretty hard on me, and I think it's been hard on you, too. I run into you and... and I feel something... I shouldn't. I try to avoid you, but I want to see you. And I don't want to come in between you and Marty making this family, but I think that if I stayed, that I would. I mean, not on purpose. I don't want to be that person, John. So I think if I--I leave, it's...it's better. I mean, one less target for Allison, like you said, and your... your life would be easier. Your job, your relationship with Marty. So it's great.",
