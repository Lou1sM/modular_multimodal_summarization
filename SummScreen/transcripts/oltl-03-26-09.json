        "Matthew and his parents are able to make peace with the fact that he will temporarily be in a wheelchair. Matthew convinces his mother to go easy on Cole. She surprises the court by telling him that the prosecution is offering Cole a suspended sentence where he's on probation under the condition that he checks into an in patient drug and alcoholic treatment facility. But, right before his trial, his drug dealer finds him and persuades him to buy and use more drugs. At the end of the trial, he meets with a counselor who demands that he gets tested before she can admit him. When Stacy is threatening to expose Roxy's secret about Rex's father being the bone marrow donor and Gigi is at her desperate mercy to get the bone marrow in order to save Shane's life, it appears a miracle has come out of nowhere. Michael informs them that he's found a donor whom they've never heard of all the way in Australia. At that point both Roxy and Gigi are ready to defy Stacy. But Michael later finds out that the transplant cannot happen. Starr and Langston talk about her feelings for Schuyler and the fact that she can see that his ex girlfriend is currently staying with him. Stacy admits to Schuyler that her nephew needs bone marrow. But he has no clue just what she is doing to her sister and to Shane's family because she keeps that part a secret."

        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I still don't think he's too thrilled with me taking it.",
        "Marty: Well, he has his issues with you.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's not what I meant.",
        "Marty: Cole thinks he deserves to be punished for what happened to Matthew.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, we'll just have to convince him otherwise.",

        "Bo: All right Matthew.",
        "Nora: You're doing great, sweetheart.",
        "Matthew: That's it. I can't do it anymore.",
        "Physical therapist: Why don't we take a break?",
        "Nora: Thanks. Okay.",
        "Bo: Good workout.",
        "Matthew: Thanks.",
        "Nora: So, well, actually this is perfect timing, because I have got to get to the court.",
        "Matthew: For Cole's arraignment?",
        "Nora: Uh, yeah, for Cole's arraignment.",
        "Matthew: Go easy on him, okay? He's hurting, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: You'll be okay.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Asher: Excuse me, Officer?",
        "Officer: What is it?",
        "Asher: I'm Cole's peer counselor at Llanview high. Would it be all right if I talked to him just for a couple minutes? I think he could really use the support.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hey.",
        "Langston: I really wish I could be there today for you and your mom.",
        "Starr: And get caught in the crossfire?",
        "Langston: You really think it's going to be that bad?",
        "Starr: You've obviously never seen my parents in the middle of a custody battle.",
        "Langston: Are you sure you don't want to go to school today?",
        "Starr: Are you serious?",
        "Langston: Well, it might be better than having to deal with your crazy father.",
        "Starr: And deal with all of the crazy students making fun of me and Schuyler instead? No, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Okay, I know I used to have some pants and shirts. I had shirts, too. I know I had shirts. Just give me a towel, one towel. My kingdom for a towel.",
        "Stacy: I think I got the last one.",
        "Schuyler: Uh -- yeah, I was going to take a shower.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, we might be out of hot water, too. Sorry.",
        "Schuyler: It's okay. No, it's okay. Cold water is probably good about now.",
        "Stacy: Look, I -- I promise I won't be your houseguest from hell much longer.",
        "Schuyler: No, no, no, it's okay. Like I said, you can stay as long as you need to.",
        "Stacy: And I appreciate it, but I've got everything under control. I'll be out of your hair before you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: Listen, kid, attitude is everything.",
        "Rex: I'm sorry; I thought this was Shane Morasco's room.",
        "Roxanne: A little respect, huh? Don't you know a rock star when you see one?",
        "Shane: Grandma said we could experiment for when my hair grows back. Awesome, right?",
        "Rex: To -- totally. Although, I think it might be a little while before you need all of that hairspray.",
        "Shane: Maybe not that long.",
        "Rex: Why, what do you mean?",
        "Shane: I got a donor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You know I'll do whatever you want me to do. Anything to get Shane cured. But, why couldn't you have just asked me to go to church three times a day or bust my butt in a soup kitchen? Is this how you work? I mean, to have my son -- do I have to let go of Rex and let my evil bitch sister have him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What? It's not like you haven't seen it all before.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, that's when I was your boyfriend. Now I'm your roommate.",
        "Stacy: Not much longer.",
        "Schuyler: Stacy, I told you, you can stay as long as you want. Just -- can we, like, work out a bathroom schedule or something?",
        "Stacy: Why bother?",
        "Schuyler: I don't know, maybe because I want hot water someday.",
        "Stacy: Well, pretty soon I'll have my own place. Okay, you can turn around.",
        "Schuyler: By the way, I thought Gigi was, like, running you out of town on a rail.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, well, that's the last thing she wants now.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, I know there's an explanation, go.",
        "Stacy: I am the last piece to the puzzle. Without me, her carefully constructed life falls to pieces. Come to think of it, it's not much better with me, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Did Michael come in this morning?",
        "Shane: Not yet.",
        "Rex: Well then, how do you know we found a donor? Did somebody talk to your mom?",
        "Shane: She's off praying.",
        "Roxanne: Yeah, it's kind of good to put a word in with the big guy upstairs, you know?",
        "Rex: Why do I get the feeling you're not telling me something?",
        "Roxanne: I think we should play money honey. I call the flip-flop.",
        "Rex: What's going on?",
        "Shane: You might as well tell him.",
        "Rex: Yeah, do that.",
        "Roxanne: I kind of told Shane that he's getting a donor today.",
        "Shane: Isn't that great?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You probably have a good reason for not liking your sister.",
        "Stacy: Thank you.",
        "Schuyler: But I don't understand. Why don't you just make an effort to stay away from her?",
        "Stacy: Sort of how you stay away from your job?",
        "Schuyler: Whoa, what does my job have to do with this?",
        "Stacy: I don't know. You tell me, teacher. How come you're not at work?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So what are they saying about me now? Is it worse than when I was pregnant?",
        "Langston: Well, you want the truth?",
        "Starr: Don't I always?",
        "Langston: I'd say that you, Mr. Joplin, Cole, Matthew pretty much have a four- way tie for the most buzz.",
        "Starr: Matthew? Those kids are still making fun of him? I swear, I am going to go over there and kick all of their asses.",
        "Langston: I knew there was a reason I missed you.",
        "Starr: Well, I can't stand that they're talking smack about Matthew. I'm not going to let them.",
        "Langston: And what about Cole?",
        "Starr: What about him?",
        "Langston: Starr, this is me.",
        "Starr: I don't want to talk about Cole. I can't believe he is in jail.",
        "Langston: Yeah, I know. Me, neither.",
        "Starr: He has to blame himself for Matthew being paralyzed.",
        "Langston: But it's not just his fault, is it? We're all to blame.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asher: Thanks very much.",
        "Asher: You look like hell, man.",
        "Cole: Try spending the night in jail, see how you look.",
        "Asher: At least you can walk. Is it true that Buchanan can't pee by himself -- ?",
        "Cole: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Asher: I know everything sucks.",
        "Cole: So, what? You'd like my shoulder to cry on, or something?",
        "Asher: It's what I said, isn't it?",
        "Cole: That's bull. You're just afraid I'm going to rat you out.",
        "Asher: That's what you think of me.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Don't worry about it, sweetheart. I'm not taking anyone down with me, okay?",
        "Asher: Thanks. I knew you'd pull through for me, just like I always pull through for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Do you have any idea what you're going to do about Cole?",
        "Nora: Um, I honestly don't know.",
        "Bo: You know, I think Matthew's worried.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, he's a better person than I am.",
        "Bo: Yeah. You know, part of me would like to see Cole pay, too.",
        "Nora: This isn't revenge. You know, this is about making sure that he doesn't hurt himself or anyone else, again.",
        "Bo: No, no. It's your call, you know. And I trust your judgment.",
        "Nora: Well, thank you.",
        "Bo: But just keep in mind what Matthew just said.",
        "Nora: [Sighs] Matthew isn't thinking straight. He's so busy blaming himself for everything that's happened. But I will take that under advisement.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "Nora: Bye.",
        "Bo: Bye.",
        "Bo: What do you say, son? Are you ready for some more stretches?",
        "Physical therapist: Actually, we got something else for Matt to try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Put it away.",
        "Asher: What do you mean? He's not paying attention.",
        "Cole: I'm off that stuff, okay?",
        "Asher: So that's why you look like that. You quit cold turkey.",
        "Cole: You can tell?",
        "Asher: Hey, kudos, man. But you've got to come down gradually.",
        "Cole: It's not like I had much choice. I've been in jail.",
        "Asher: That's why I'm here. You think the judge is going to believe you did it just one time when you're in there doing your best imitation of a coffee grinder? Just take it so you have the option.",
        "Asher: See you later.",
        "Nora: Who was that?",
        "Cole: No one. How is Matthew?",
        "Nora: He has a physical therapist now.",
        "Cole: Is he okay?",
        "Nora: Well, he's more worried about you than himself. So what's that tell you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: It's not motorized?",
        "Physical therapist: Matthew doesn't need a motorized wheelchair.",
        "Bo: Ah, well [Clears throat] What do you say, son? You want to give it a try?",
        "Matthew: Hell no. Get that thing out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What the hell made you think it was a good idea to tell Shane we found a donor?",
        "Roxanne: I just want to save my grandkid.",
        "Stacy: I'll take care of that.",
        "Roxanne: Just what are you going to do?",
        "Stacy: We'll say that I'm the match.",
        "Roxanne: All I did was tell him that I kind of had a feeling, you know, like I was telling you.",
        "Rex: You are not going to get my kid's hopes up again. Okay? Not about this. You got it?",
        "Roxanne: Okay, okay. It's the first time and last time I do it, scout's honor. What are you doing?",
        "Rex: I'm going to tell Shane the truth.",
        "Roxanne: No, no, no, please don't do that. You want to crush the hope that he's got like a little bug? Let me go to the lab and let me check, okay? Please, Rex, please. You won't regret it. Good. See you.",
        "Gigi: What's up with your mom?",
        "Rex: You won't believe it.",
        "Gigi: Try me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I'm suspended, okay? I'm suspended. I'm suspended, and there's an investigation pending, and I can't go back to work until I'm cleared.",
        "Stacy: Wait, you're not using again, right?",
        "Schuyler: No, no, Stacy, I'm not using.",
        "Stacy: Because you can tell me.",
        "Schuyler: I'm not using, okay? I haven't touched that stuff in a long time.",
        "Stacy: Okay, sorry. I was just worried.",
        "Schuyler: That's okay, that's okay.",
        "Stacy: Well, if it's not drugs, then what is it? You didn't get all extracurricular with a student or anything, did you? Oh, my God. You did. You slept with a student, didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: We could have stopped Cole from getting in that car.",
        "Starr: We tried.",
        "Langston: Well, we should have tried harder. We should have told someone.",
        "Starr: Like who? His mom? When Cole wants to do something, he's going to do it.",
        "Langston: So we could have taken his keys. We could've, I don't know, let the air out of his tires. If only he hadn't --",
        "Starr: If only he hadn't what?",
        "Langston: [Sighs] Nothing.",
        "Starr: If only he hadn't caught me and Schuyler kissing? That's what you were going to say, right? This is all my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I had this dream last night that my mom and I were back in Ireland with the guys that took us hostage.",
        "Nora: It's not unusual for an accident to trigger the memory of another accident.",
        "Cole: Only it was me this time stuck in a van, not her. And everything started to burn. I wasn't scared, though. Because I knew it was better that way. Because if I was stuck in the van, it means I couldn't come home, right? That means I couldn't hurt Starr or Matthew or you.",
        "Marty: I'm sorry. Should Cole have his attorney present here?",
        "Cole: No, everything's fine.",
        "Marty: Nora?",
        "Nora: Your son really needs you.",
        "Marty: Are -- are you feeling okay?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Marty: Are you sure, because after quitting drugs like that, it's normal to have feelings of withdrawal.",
        "Cole: I didn't do enough for that, so --",
        "Marty: Yeah?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Marty: What do you need? What can I get you?",
        "Cole: Water.",
        "Marty: Water? Okay. Okay, I'll get you some water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I'm not touching that thing.",
        "Bo: Maybe you can give us a minute or two.",
        "Bo: What's the problem?",
        "Matthew: I told you.",
        "Bo: But this is just temporary.",
        "Matthew: No, it's not, Dad. It's forever. The minute I get into one of those chairs, I'll never get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole and Matthew might be okay if I hadn't have kissed Mr. J. He wouldn't have gotten into the car, and he wouldn't have gotten high because of me.",
        "Langston: It was Cole's decision to get behind the wheel, not yours. He would tell you the same thing if you gave him the chance.",
        "Starr: I can't do that.",
        "Langston: And why not?",
        "Starr: Because if I do, it might give him the wrong idea.",
        "Langston: And what would that be?",
        "Starr: That I can be there for him, and I can't. Not in the way he wants me to be.",
        "Langston: But what's stopping you?",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Langston: I mean, I know that Cole was mad at you because you lied for your father, but now you guys really need each other. So why aren't you trying to work on things? And don't say Mr. Joplin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I didn't sleep with a student.",
        "Stacy: So then, why are you suspended?",
        "Schuyler: Because they're accusing me of inappropriate contact with a student. Everybody just got the wrong idea.",
        "Stacy: So you did have inappropriate contact.",
        "Schuyler: No, it was completely innocent. I mean, it was big misunderstanding.",
        "Stacy: Wait. That's whose gloves I found. She was in here.",
        "Schuyler: Um, well, okay. Don't get the wrong idea. I mean, she has a small crush on me.",
        "Stacy: And you don't think she's going to do something about it?",
        "Schuyler: No, no, because I made it perfectly clear that, you know, I'm unavailable. And besides, I happen to live with an ex-girlfriend who wouldn't mind pretending that she is still in love with me, right? Please, please God?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, yeah, of course. Anything for you, Schuy.",
        "Schuyler: Thank you.",
        "Stacy: I'm still worried, though. I really think this girl might be a bigger problem than you're making it out to be.",
        "Schuyler: I got to shower.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Stacy: Are you expecting anyone?",
        "[Knocking continues]",
        "Stacy: Okay, fine. [Yelling] I'm coming.",
        "[Knocking continues]",
        "Roxanne: What the hell happened to our deal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Balsom, we need to talk.",
        "Michael: Hey, you guys, we got Shane's blood work back.",
        "Rex: How are his numbers?",
        "Michael: Well, the chemo is doing its job, which means the symptoms are going to get worse, okay? But that's a good thing.",
        "Gigi: Except the better the chemo works, the worse he needs a transplant, right?",
        "Michael: Basically. So, it's a good thing he's going to get one.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Michael: We found a donor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Tell me in what universe it makes sense for a high school student to date her teacher? Come on, I would love to hear it.",
        "Starr: Okay, could you please be serious about this?",
        "Langston: See, that's your problem.",
        "Starr: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Langston: Are you sure you're not mistaking a crush for real feelings?",
        "Starr: They are real feelings.",
        "Langston: Maybe for you. What about Mr. J?",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Look, we shouldn't be seen together.",
        "Roxanne: And just who the hell is seeing us?",
        "Stacy: I'll talk to you later, Roxy.",
        "Roxanne: No way! I told my grandson I would get some help for him.",
        "Stacy: And I told you I'd help him.",
        "Roxanne: Well, then get to the hospital and ask someone to suck out your bones, okay?",
        "Stacy: It's not that easy!",
        "Roxanne: All right -- I'll spell it out for you. All you have to do is say that you're a match and let you-know-who do all the work.",
        "Stacy: I know what I'm supposed to do, thank you.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, you know what you're supposed to do? Then you better do it because I'm not going to wait any longer, and if you don't, I'm going to tell Rex and Gigi everything.",
        "Stacy: And blow your dirty little secret? Because that's what they'll find out if you don't stick to the plan.",
        "Roxanne: You know, baby, you got an ice box for a heart. Don't you even care about Shane?",
        "Stacy: You should ask Gigi that question. She's the one who's holding things up, not me.",
        "Roxanne: Well, I'm not waiting too much longer. You don't mess with me, Morasco.",
        "[Door opens, slams]",
        "Schuyler: Um -- why is my landlady threatening you?",
        "[Stacy sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You found a bone marrow donor for Shane?",
        "Michael: A woman from Australia just showed up on the international registry.",
        "Rex: And we can use her?",
        "Michael: Um, you know what -- she's not an ideal match, but she's pretty good.",
        "Gigi: \"Pretty good\" is -- is good enough for us.",
        "Rex: We'll take it! Yeah.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Gigi: Yeah!",
        "Michael: Oh. I'm going to start scheduling the transplant.",
        "Rex: Okay, can we tell Shane?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, can we?",
        "Michael: Ah -- sure, yeah. Give him the good news.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Michael: This -- this is the best part of my job.",

        "Rex: Oh, it's going to be awesome!",
        "Shane: Hey! Maybe you should keep it down. This is a hospital, you know?",
        "Rex: Well, maybe you should keep it down.",
        "Shane: What?",
        "Rex: We have a donor.",
        "Shane: Really?",
        "Gigi: Yes, really!",

He -- he was -- he was like the little brother that I always wanted. I mean -- ah. The -- you know, the kid, he -- he's smart. He's brave, he -- he never -- he never hurt a single soul in his whole life. Matthew Buchanan is, uh -- he's all the things that I'm not. You know, if I could trade places with Matthew, then -- no.
