    "Recap": [
        "Dorian and Ray are growing closer after he's helped her with the idea to have Tea represent Blair in the custody suit without Todd knowing and surprise the court by having John announce that he will be Blair's husband and father to her kids. Gigi and Rex get the devastating new that the bone marrow donor whom they thought would save Shane's life cannot. At that point, Gigi finds she has no choice except to beg to Stacy and comply with whatever Stacy wants. Natalie and Jared still do now know how to drop the bombshell that Jessica's baby died and that Chloe is really Starr Manning's baby. Cole is ready to check into the drug treatment facility. But he must get tested before it can happen. At that point, he hasn't a clue what to do since the drug dealer recently sold him more that he consumed only an hour earlier. When he goes the bathroom, the dealer knows that Cole needs his \"help\"."

        "Brody: So you palm the ball like this, all right? And take your aim, and you're going to let the ball fall right off your fingers, ok?",
        "Brody: Don't go there, man.",
        "Natalie: I wonder why jess wanted to talk to us here instead of at home.",
        "Jared: Maybe it's something that she didn't want your mom to hear.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, or maybe she found out that we were asking questions about the day Chloe was born.",
        "Jared: She wouldn't bust us over a breakfast burrito. Would she?",
        "Natalie: I Hope not. I mean, because I really don't know how in the world I'm going to be able to tell her that we found out for sure that Bess switched her dead baby with Starr's healthy one.",
        "Jared: You ever wish that construction guy had given her wallet to somebody else?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. So we wouldn't have put the pieces together to find out Starr's mourning a baby that's still alive. I wish to hell I didn't know any of this.",
        "Jared: But we do know.",
        "Natalie: I know, and we've got to make it right somehow, because every time I see that look on Marcie's face when she talks about Hope, I --",
        "Jared: Oh, God. You're not going to believe who just walked in, and who she's holding.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "Jessica: Hey! Everybody's here. Sometimes a plan just comes together, huh? What's wrong?",

        "Dorian: Good morning, you two.",
        "John: Good morning.",
        "Dorian: John, can I get you a cup of coffee? An early lunch? A chateau in the Loire Valley?",
        "John: No, that's not necessary.",
        "Dorian: You must be kidding. After everything you agreed to do for our family.",
        "John: I just hope it works.",
        "Dorian: It has to work. I can't believe that Todd Manning is going straight to court this morning to try and get custody of the children when Blair can't even stand, let alone stand up for herself.",
        "John: I believe it.",
        "Dorian: But this time, we are going to beat him at his own game. And the beauty part is, he's not even going to see it coming.",

        "Lauren: Welcome to life in drug rehab, Cole.",
        "Marty: Oh, you don't have to test him. He went right from the hospital to jail to the court. He's clean.",
        "Lauren: Regular tests are a given. The men's room's around the corner. I'll be right outside the door.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: Oh, what are you doing here?",
        "Todd: How's Cole?",
        "Marty: He's fine. Or he will be.",
        "Todd: How are you?",
        "Marty: I'm not here to make small talk with you. I'm here for my child.",
        "Todd: Then we have something in common.",

        "Cole: This is weird.",
        "Lauren: It's a fact of life now. Get used to it.",
        "Starr: Cole?",
        "Cole: It's okay if I go talk to her?",
        "Cole: What are you doing here?",
        "Starr: My dad's trying to get custody of my brothers and me.",
        "Cole: You kidding?",
        "Starr: I wish I was. He's saying that my mom's too messed up to parent us. Like he isn't.",
        "Cole: How is your mom?",
        "Starr: She's awake. I can actually talk to her. She's still in ICU. Were you at court?",
        "Cole: Yeah. I don't have to go to jail, just a drug treatment program. So instead of a warden, I have this, and her.",
        "Starr: That's great.",
        "Cole: I get to walk, and Matthew never will.",
        "Starr: You didn't mean for anything bad to happen to Matthew --",
        "Cole: Starr, you -- you can cut the sympathy, okay? I played the message from the night of the dance. I know how you really feel about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What are you talking about? Shane's bone marrow donor can't fall through. You told me it was all set.",
        "Michael: I thought it was, but then the donor went in for preliminary testing and she discovered she was pregnant.",
        "Rex: And that makes a difference?",
        "Michael: No, it's not safe for her to be a donor until she's had the baby, seven months from now.",
        "Rex: Shane doesn't have seven months. Now what are we going to do?",
        "Michael: We go back to square one and try to find another match.",

        "Stacy: How can you not need my bone marrow?",
        "Gigi: We found another donor.",
        "Stacy: Oh, you did? Who?",
        "Gigi: The point is we don't need you. Shane is going to be all right. So you can take your bone marrow and your little plot to get Rex and shove 'em.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I was really upset when I left you that message.",
        "Cole: Well, I was upset when I caught Joplin's tongue in your mouth. Now, I didn't send you a message saying, \"I don't care what happens to you anymore.\"",
        "Starr: No, you just swallowed pills.",
        "Cole: So how is Mr. Joplin?",
        "Starr: He got suspended. He's going before the school board today.",
        "Cole: Good.",
        "Starr: Cole.",
        "Cole: What -- what he did was wrong, Starr.",
        "Starr: No, what I did was wrong. I kissed him.",
        "Cole: Is that supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Lauren: Cole.",
        "Cole: I'm glad about your mom.",
        "Starr: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What I said in that message, I did not mean. I care about you, and I always will.",

        "Todd: Yeah. Yeah, Blair won't let me see them. Now she's laid up.",
        "Marty: Well, an incapacitated woman is always a golden opportunity for you, isn't it?",
        "Todd: Well, I don't want my kids being raised by Dorian, so -- how did you know I was suing for custody?",
        "Marty: Blair's lawyer told me.",
        "Todd: Since when do you talk to Blair's lawyer?",
        "Marty: She's inside. Why don't you ask her?",

        "T\u00e9a: This isn't personal.",
        "Todd: You've decided you hate me so much that you would keep me from my kids.",

        "John: Okay, buddy, I've got to get going. Don't be too much trouble for your Aunt Dorian, okay?",
        "Dorian: Did you hear that?",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: John, are you going straight to the court?",
        "John: Yeah, I am.",
        "Dorian: I wonder if you'd please call me as soon as there's any news, because, well, I'm going to want to call Blair right away with good news.",
        "John: Of course. I'll stay in touch.",
        "Dorian: Thank you. I just have to tell you, I'm -- I'm -- I'm amazed... That you're doing this. It -- it's just not you.",
        "John: Well, it's not about me. It's about Blair and the kids. And I don't want to see this guy taken from another home he's come to love. All right, buddy. I'll see you later, okay? Go with your Aunt Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Thank you.",

        "Rex: We have been through the international registries. We were running out of hope when we found that Australian lady. Now, what are the odds that we'll find another donor in time?",
        "Michael: New people sign up every day, Rex.",
        "Rex: Shane is in there right now thinking this is going to be over soon. I told him that he could be playing little league this summer. What the hell do I tell him now?",
        "Michael: That we are not giving up hope.",
        "Rex: Gigi -- she's over the moon. How do I tell her there's no one to save Shane?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: So you'd rather use the bone marrow from some stranger rather than Shane's aunt?",
        "Gigi: The stranger is a decent human being who signed up to donate bone marrow. Shane's aunt is a blackmailer who's willing to let him die. Ever hear of good triumphing over evil? Well, that's what happened today. God heard my prayers. My boy's going to be okay, and I don't have to walk away from Rex in order to save him. It's not like you ever had a chance with him anyway. You had to drug him before he'd let you touch him.",
        "Stacy: That's not true.",
        "Gigi: Shut up, Stacy. I'm so sick of your lies. There's no reason for you to stay in Llanview now, so why don't you just go back to Vegas and forget you ever saw me?",
        "Stacy: We're sisters.",
        "Gigi: You are no sister of mine. So go. Go get back on the pole. And honey, no matter what you call yourself, you're a stripper. Oh, and don't use my name anymore. I don't want anything to do with you ever again.",

        "Gigi: Hi, Balsom.",
        "Rex: Where are you?",
        "Gigi: I'm on my way back to the hospital. Shane asked for Thai food. I think that's a good sign, don't you? So I'll pick it up and then we can celebrate.",
        "Rex: Gigi --",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: I've -- I've got some bad news.",

        "Dorian: These are desperate times which require desperate measures.",
        "Ray: Oh, no, no, please don't take my comment as an insult. I admire you.",
        "Dorian: You do?",
        "Ray: Deeply. Deeply. I have seen you with Blair, and I know she's like a daughter to you.",
        "Dorian: Yes, she is.",
        "Ray: I, too, have a daughter. Going to extremes to protect our children -- to me, that's a very attractive quality.",

        "Jessica: Can you believe that I have two kids and I cannot hold a baby and fold the stroller at the same time? So thank goodness Marcie came along.",
        "Marcie: Please, I'm the lucky one. I got to hold this little girl for a little bit, right?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: But I have to give you back. I do -- I have to get going. I have to pick up take-out and bring it to Michael at the hospital.",
        "Jessica: Oh, okay. Is he helping you figure out what happened?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. I just told Jessica we know Hope didn't die from Rh disease.",
        "Jessica: Anyways, I hope you find peace of mind somehow.",

        "Asher: Dude.",
        "Cole: You're still here?",
        "Asher: Had to find out what happened to my best customer. Drug testing, huh? That's a bummer.",
        "Cole: And now I'm going to flunk. Nora's going to find out and send me to jail.",
        "Asher: No, man, you've got to learn to think outside the box.",
        "Cole: What are you talking about?",
        "Asher: I don't use the stuff. I just sell it. Hand it over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't hate you. I -- I -- I like to take cases that I know I can win.",
        "Todd: I have everything going for me in this case. Everything's in my favor. The order of protection has expired. Blair's better, but who knows when she's going to back on her feet?",
        "T\u00e9a: Who says I don't like a challenge, hmm? Besides, you know, if memory serves, I've won difficult cases before. I got you off, didn't I?",

        "Marty: Hi.",
        "John: Hi.",
        "Marty: You're not going to believe it, but at the last minute, Nora cut a deal with Cole.",
        "John: He got off?",
        "Marty: Well, conditionally. He still has to complete a drug treatment program, but he's not going to jail, unless he uses again.",
        "John: Well, that ought to wake him up.. Now that he's got you in his corner.",
        "Marty: Hey, I heard Blair regained consciousness.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Oh, that's great. That is -- that is great. Was she able to remember anything that happened to her?",
        "John: No. No, she can't I.D. the guy. Last thing she remembers is him taking her hand. That's probably when he put the cut-out underneath her fingernail.",
        "Marty: I can't stop thinking about that.",
        "John: Well, I should've kept my mouth shut.",
        "Marty: No -- no, you shouldn't. The letters \"k-a-d\" were found on each stabbing victim? No, I -- I needed to know that. That's the fraternity where I was raped, and you did the right thing by telling me. I'm involved with this somehow.",
        "John: I --",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "John: Hi.",

        "Rex: Michael says we have to start over.",
        "Gigi: Shane doesn't have time for that.",

        "Dorian: Did you ever find out how Lola's mother really died?",
        "Ray: That's not so easy to talk about. Perhaps we can save that for another time.",
        "Dorian: I really appreciated the way you stood up to Todd Manning when he showed up here yesterday. And I'm in your debt for suggesting T\u00e9a Delgado as Blair's attorney.",
        "Ray: Are you sufficiently in my debt to tell me about this plan that you and T\u00e9a have cooked up?",

        "Dr. Levin: Brody, given your history with Gigi and Shane Morasco, are you worried about getting too close to this woman's children? What if things don't work out with her?",

        "Natalie: Well, with Matthew and Blair, you know, still in the hospital, I just think it's going to be really hard to get all the family together.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'd like to try. This family has been through so much this past year -- so much heartache, so much pain. But what came out of it was this beautiful little girl. And can you think of a better way to express hope? And I really want you guys to be behind this because I want you guys to be Chloe's godparents.",

        "Todd: Sure. When my ex-wife was first awarded custody of our kids, I was told by the court that if I did certain things, then I would have a shot at joint custody. And I have done those things. As a matter of fact, I have a certificate right here from an anger management course that I completed. I also have a bill from a shrink that I've been seeing. And I hope you'll agree that these documents will prove that I'm no longer legally barred from seeing my kids. Also, both my sons have expressed interest to me personally that they would like to live with me again.",
        "Starr: Yeah, right.",
        "Todd: That's true, Your Honor. And Blair is -- that's my ex-wife, Blair -- she's in the hospital currently, and no one knows when she's going to recover and when she's going to be able to take care of the children again. And... I believe that my children, right now, need stability in their lives. And I don't think they're going to get that living with their fruitcake Aunt Dorian.",

        "Shane: Why?",
        "Rex: Well, who's better at names than you, right?",
        "Shane: Really?",
        "Rex: Totally.",
        "Shane: Okay. Look what I did while you were gone. Chemo boy was running out of ways to stop Lou Chemia, so he went to the person he gets his secret powers from. That's him.",
        "Rex: That looks like \u0096",
        "Shane: It's you, Dad. I named him T-Rex. I guess I am pretty good at names.",

        "Ray: Yeah, I don't blame you. I don't, and I'm glad to say that we're not so much strangers now.",

        "Brody: I kissed her when she didn't see it coming -- scared her a little bit, I think. After that, we decided it was better to just be friends.",

        "Brody: I'm not, and I don't think she is either.",

And I realize now that when Nash was taken from me, I just -- I had to put the blame on someone, and you guys were easy. But, Natalie -- Natalie, I love you, okay? And Jared, you're going to be my brother-in-law. And we're going to be family. And what better way to make peace between the three of us than to make you someone special in my child's life?

But if she can't be there for her children right now because she's incapacitated, isn't the next best choice their own flesh and blood? I mean, as you can see, I fulfilled the obligations to the court, and I think I deserve that chance. Judge: Ms. Delgado, what do you have to say to this?",
