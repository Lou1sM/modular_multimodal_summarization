        "John: Natalie told you?",
        "Bo: No, it's all over the squad room. You know, everybody's really proud of you.",
        "John: For what?",
        "Bo: For single-handedly busting up that robbery at the palace.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Bo: What'd you think I was talking about?",

        "Natalie: Hey, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Hi, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: What you got there?",
        "Jessica: Ah, just a to-do list.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. By the look of your face, it seems the fate of the world depends on it.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no. No, I'm -- what's going on with you? Why did I have to meet you down here right away?",
        "Natalie: Hmm, you know, same old same old -- armed robbery, dodging some bullets, getting engaged.",
        "Jessica: What, what? Oh, my God, let me see!",
        "Natalie: No, no, no, no. It's -- we got interrupted by the robbers.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Natalie: But John is going to ask me to marry him. We're finally getting married!",
        "Jessica: Oh, congratulations!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Music, definitely need music. And a charger -- oh, yeah, that's right. Here we go. All right. Charger, shoes, extra shoes, and then we need something to eat, something to drink, and then we --",
        "Starr: No, no, no -- Cole?",
        "Cole: What, am I forgetting something?",
        "Starr: Yeah -- your mind.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Starr: There's no way we're blowing town like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hey -- new company policy. You take a bullet, you get an automatic day off.",
        "Blair: It's just a flesh wound. Besides, I have to rehearse.",
        "Cristian: Rehearse?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cristian: Blair, you took a bullet to your arm.",
        "Blair: Well, then, I'll just start a new trend -- I'll be a one-armed singer.",
        "Cristian: Oh, right, that's funny.",
        "Blair: What are you doing here anyway? Shouldn't you be off painting some masterpieces?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, right. Well, Nash quit, so I'm covering for Antonio until he finds a new replacement.",
        "Blair: Ha. Good, because I could be in the market for some more artwork.",
        "Cristian: Well, I'm not much of an artist anymore, but I could be in the market for a new muse.",
        "Blair: Maybe I'll audition. Or not. I mean, you know, you can't just go off looking for inspiration like that. I mean, what -- what do I know? I'm -- I'm not an artist.",
        "Cristian: Oh -- well, hey, I wouldn't sell yourself short. You are pretty talented.",
        "Blair: Ok, Cristian. How long do you think we can continue this conversation without thinking about sex -- more importantly, without acting on it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Can I get you something?",
        "Evangeline: No, thanks. I won't be staying long.",
        "Todd: Ok, tell me what's wrong and I'll make it right.",
        "Evangeline: Nothing's wrong. I was just in the area and I thought I'd stop by.",
        "Todd: since when do you just stop by?",
        "Evangeline: There's always a first.",
        "Todd: You're about as good a liar as I am an honest, God-fearing citizen. Ah, spill it. Or I'll spill it for you if you want.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, you think you know, do you?",
        "Todd: I think I could make a pretty good guess. I want to hear it from you.",
        "Evangeline: Todd? [Evangeline sighs] Huh. You are a lot of things, but intuitive is not what pops into my mind when I think about you.",
        "Todd: You're not giving me a chance.",
        "Evangeline: You don't have your finger on my pulse the way you think you do.",
        "Todd: You wish I had my finger on your pulse.",
        "Evangeline: so you're the expert on me?",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm.",
        "Evangeline: Then why am I here?",
        "Todd: Give me a second. Let me take a gander at you. Yeah. You dress pretty normally, uh, but you got a shifty look in your eyes. Yeah, you got a shifty look in your eyes. Yeah. It's none about business because you wouldn't be hemming and hawing all over the place.",
        "Evangeline: I'm not hemming and hawing.",
        "Todd: You don't even have a finger on your own pulse, which means only one thing -- I got away with it.",
        "Evangeline: Got away with what?",
        "Todd: Nothing. Ah! I got you, didn't I? I got you.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, my God.",
        "Todd: Uh-oh.",
        "Evangeline: Oh.",
        "Todd: You've lost your sense of humor, and that's not you. so this is big, this is really big -- and obviously having something to do with me because you didn't come here to ask my advice.",
        "Evangeline: How do you know that?",
        "Todd: Who asks for my advice except my kids? So, it's something about you and me. Is Cristian taking you back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm not sure. But isn't there a law about a boss and employee having this kind of conversation?",
        "Blair: Oh, am I making any unwelcome sexual advances here?",
        "Cristian: Well, I don't think there's anything that's unwelcome --",
        "Blair: And I don't recall requesting any sexual favors, and am I interfering with your work performance?",
        "Cristian: Well, no, no, not really. I mean, I might have to start over with these receipts, but other than that, I'm --",
        "Blair: Oh, see? No sexual harassment here, but I do think it might be the other way around, see? I think maybe the boss might be hitting on the employee.",
        "Cristian: You think I'm hitting on you?",
        "Blair: Oop -- you're not? Oh, well, then no problem. I just want to have a very good working relationship with my boss. so, Cristian, what I think we need to do is maybe talk about our little adventure up on top of the mountain. Might be a good start.",
        "Cristian: I think you're right -- it could be a good start, but it happens. We don't have to go play-by-play, do we?",
        "Blair: Was it fun?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, it was -- it was great. It was --",
        "Blair: It was fun --",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Fun.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. It was fun.",
        "Blair: And we are going to make sure that it never happens again, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Dr. Crosby should be here any minute.",
        "Talia: shouldn't I be, like, chanting or meditating or something?",
        "Antonio: I know hypnosis sounds scary.",
        "Talia: Well, it's not getting hit upside the head by a firebug.",
        "Antonio: No, but it is about letting go, which could be difficult for people like you and me.",
        "Talia: speak for yourself.",
        "Antonio: I've seen Dr. Crosby in action. He -- he'll have everything under control.",
        "Talia: Then there's nothing to worry about.",
        "Antonio: No, but if -- if there still is, we can forget it.",
        "Talia: No. Just make sure he stays on point, ok? I don't -- I don't want any secrets from when I was 12 coming out.",
        "Antonio: No, it'll just be about the medal you saw in Nora's basement -- nothing else.",
        "Talia: I really didn't meet Louis Vasco behind the bowling alley like my mom thought, in case it comes out.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Got it.",
        "Talia: I really want this to work. I just don't want to mess up again.",
        "Antonio: Well, you're doing great, Talia. And you'll do great with this. If you registered anything about that medal, Dr. Crosby will get it out of you.",
        "Talia: Hopefully we'll get this guy before he hurts someone again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: so the perps have been arraigned?",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, and considering their priors and the fact that Blair got shot, they're going away for a long time.",
        "John: As they should.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Whatever it was that you thought that I was talking about, it's not really job-related, huh?",
        "John: No.",
        "Bo: No, ok. Well, it seems to have you distracted. Distracted is dangerous.",
        "John: I know.",
        "Bo: Ok, so whatever it is, just take care of it. Ok.",
        "John: Ok. Hey, Bo?",
        "Bo: Hmm?",
        "John: You're going to hear this sooner or later, so you might as well hear it from me. Natalie thinks we're getting engaged.",
        "Bo: Oh -- well, no offense, but I've seen happier faces at audits. Uh -- you having a change of heart?",
        "John: No. No, I'm -- and I'm -- it's not that I'm having second thoughts. I'm not even having first thoughts. The thing is, I was -- I hadn't planned on proposing to Natalie.",
        "Bo: What are we talking about? How did Natalie get an idea like that?",
        "John: It just kind of happened.",
        "Bo: Just one of those things, huh?",
        "John: Yeah -- the robbery.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "John: When they cleaned us out, they got the ring.",
        "Bo: And Natalie saw it.",
        "John: Yeah, and you know, so, you know, she assumed that -- you know?",
        "Bo: Yeah -- what were you doing with the ring, though?",
        "John: Bo, I wanted to put it in the safe here at work and then I kind of forgot I had it with me, all right? I asked Natalie to dinner because I thought we needed to talk, you know, to sort of figure out where we stood. Whole thing got messed up.",
        "Bo: What are you going to do to fix it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You're right -- that was a lame idea.",
        "Starr: Cole --",
        "Cole: I mean, there's no way we'd get away with it.",
        "Starr: You don't understand!",
        "Cole: Run away -- like we're 10 or something. What the hell was I thinking?",
        "Starr: Cole, you were thinking the same thing that I am -- that our parents are so wrapped up in their own crap that they can't realize that we're nothing like them.",
        "Cole: Ok, so what do we do then?",
        "Starr: Well, we shouldn't be paying for something that happened forever ago.",
        "Cole: I know, and my mom's freaking out that -- that your dad's going to come after me or something.",
        "Starr: My dad thinks that you're going to do the same --",
        "Cole: That he did to my mom?",
        "Starr: But you won't.",
        "Cole: I know. But how do we get them to back off? I mean, as of next week, I'm off to military school if I don't get out of here. so what am I supposed to do, Starr -- just accept it?",
        "Starr: No, you can't.",
        "Cole: Ok, well, then, do you have any other ideas, because I'm coming up empty here.",
        "Starr: Cole, I'm with you on this, ok? We have to send the message to our parents that we're not messing around, but we have to do this right, which means not packing every little thing -- like this. Look, trust me on this -- I know what I'm talking about. In order for this to work out, we have to travel light.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Look, Blair, I --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Cristian: I don't think you were looking for love on that mountain any more than I was. Like you said, it was -- it was convenient. It was nice.",
        "Blair: Well, I did -- well, you might be able to say that.",
        "Cristian: And it was fun.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I said that, didn't I?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, you did. And, um -- and I think we kind of helped each other out, a lot.",
        "Blair: Well, I think there's another term for it.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I know, I know. I just didn't want to say it aloud.",
        "Blair: Hmm. We're a pair, aren't we?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, well, at least we know where we're coming from.",
        "Blair: Both just trying to be distracted from Todd and Evangeline.",
        "Cristian: And we blew it -- bigtime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: No. Cristian is not taking me back, and even if he did, too much has been said and too much has been done that can't be undone. No, it wouldn't be the same.",
        "Todd: Ok, then what is it? Are you sick? You're not dying, are you?",
        "Evangeline: No, no. It's nothing like that.",
        "Todd: Then what is it? Not about your sister or anything?",
        "Evangeline: No, no. She forgave me, thank God.",
        "Todd: Well, it wasn't your fault you thought she slept with Cristian. He should've been a man about it and owned up to the truth.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, what, like Blair? She didn't tell you, either.",
        "Todd: Ahem. I didn't think she was sleeping with my sister. Of course, Blair has slept with everyone else in town, so why not Viki?",
        "Evangeline: This isn't funny, Todd.",
        "Todd: Ok, I'm not laughing. But you got to admit, Blair and Cristian are pretty different. At least Blair knows who she is -- Cristian thinks he's better than everyone --",
        "Evangeline: Can we just stop? Can you not -- can you just please not talk about Cristian?",
        "Todd: Well, what would you like to talk about? Ok. How about why you came here so hot and bothered?",
        "Evangeline: I am not hot and bothered.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you are.",
        "Evangeline: I'm not hot and bothered.",
        "Todd: Then I'm going back to trashing Cristian. Let me think here. A priest, a rabbi, and a Mexican boxer --",
        "Evangeline: That's it.",
        "Todd: Hey, hold on.",
        "Evangeline: No, don't touch me, please?",
        "Todd: Talk to me.",
        "Evangeline: All right.",
        "Todd: Ok, lay it on me.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. First off, I don't want to ever hear you say another negative word about Cristian -- you got it?",
        "Todd: Well, we're not going to be drinking buddies or anything.",
        "Evangeline: I don't care. Not one more negative word about him.",
        "Todd: You want a contract or something?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. That would work.",
        "Todd: Ok. Let me play nice with caveman.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, my God, why are you making this so hard? You make everything so hard -- my God, I hate you! I hate you! I hate this, I hate this! I hate feeling this way, I hate it. I don't get it, I don't understand this. What is it? I hate it! Cristian and I were totally happy, everything was perfect, and everything got messed up and I don't understand how it happened, but I think it was you. You messed it up and I hate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Dr. Crosby's helped a lot of people here, Talia.",
        "Talia: Just don't make me cluck like a chicken while I'm under.",
        "Ed: No, well, we don't do that, really -- bark like a dog, maybe.",
        "Talia: Hmm -- funny.",
        "Ed: Let's have a seat.",
        "Antonio: It'll be ok. I'll be here the whole time.",
        "Talia: Do your thing, doc.",
        "Ed: Ok. I want you to think of a favorite place -- a vacation spot, maybe somewhere you like to go now. And take yourself there. Really put yourself right in it. I'm going to count to five -- one, two, three, four, five. Raise your hand if you feel relaxed -- good. Now, Talia, I want you to remember when you were last at Nora Hanen's house -- why were you there?",
        "Talia: Detective Vega and I thought that maybe the arsonist left something behind that got overlooked.",
        "Ed: And did you find anything?",
        "Talia: No, not at first. I was ready to give up and Antonio -- he was looking through a web cam -- told me to follow the water on the floor to the drain.",
        "Ed: And that's when you found something?",
        "Talia: Yes. I got it.",
        "Ed: What does it look like?",
        "Talia: It's a silver medallion, it's round. It's about the size of a silver dollar. There's an engraving -- oh, words and a -- a design, maybe both.",
        "Ed: Can you make out what it is?",
        "Talia: It's covered in soot and ash.",
        "Antonio: she said she started to clean it off.",
        "Talia: I was.",
        "Ed: Can you make out anything on the engraving?",
        "Talia: The dirt, it -- it's coming off. I can -- I can see. I can --",
        "Ed: What, Talia? What can you see?",
        "Talia: someone else is here. It's him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm guessing ritual suicide is right out.",
        "Bo: You're in a tough spot -- I don't envy you.",
        "John: You don't think I'm a complete bastard? Natalie is your niece.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, and you're my friend, you know? I'm concerned about both of you. You have no ideas at all what to do?",
        "John: Bo, every fix I come up with is worse than the one before. I -- I should just come clean right away.",
        "Bo: I think whatever you do, it's going to break Natalie's heart -- unless you decide to go through with the engagement. Any chance you could work things out?",
        "John: I don't know. I know I can't -- can't just keep her hanging like this, you know? And I can't lie to her -- I care about her too much.",
        "Bo: Yeah, too much, but not enough.",
        "John: It's not just me. You know, whether Natalie wants to admit it or not, neither one of us is ready for marriage.",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: John and I are getting married. Oh, gosh. You know, I just thought -- I thought our relationship was going nowhere. I mean, you saw John, the way he was acting when the night first started. I don't think I would've believed him when he popped the question. That's how badly things had been going lately.",
        "Jessica: But you guys are ok now, right?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, we're more than ok.",
        "Jessica: Well, good. I'm glad that you worked it out.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I don't know about that, but at least we're trying.",
        "Jessica: Ok. Well, keep doing that because marriage doesn't solve anything. If there were problems there before, they're -- they're still going to be there, even worse.",
        "Natalie: Jess, are you and Antonio having problems?",
        "Jessica: No, no. Just getting used to married life, you know?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I'm sure it doesn't help having a third party around.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, Nash is an issue.",
        "Natalie: Is he ever going to get over Tess? I mean, what is his problem?",
        "Jessica: It's not Tess, Natalie. She's not even in the equation.",
        "Natalie: Ok, what's going on?",
        "Jessica: Nash and I are --",
        "Natalie: Yeah? Jess, you and Nash are what?",
        "Jessica: We're -- having trouble figuring out how to relate to one another.",
        "Natalie: You mean Nash is having trouble figuring it out?",
        "Jessica: No, me, too.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Give it some time. Sometimes men need that. I mean, look at John. Sometimes, waiting is the only thing that'll do it.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, you and John are different than Nash and me.",
        "Natalie: I was talking about Antonio.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Anyway, things will happen the way they're supposed to -- I know you want that.",
        "Jessica: More than anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ed: I want you to tell me what happened when you realized that someone was with you in Nora Hanen's basement.",
        "Talia: It all happened so fast. He got the drop on me. I fell. He thought I was out. John! I went to apprehend him, but he got away. Oh!",
        "Ed: Can you describe him? Any detail at all?",
        "Talia: His face -- it was too dark. I -- I -- he was covered in a mask. I couldn't see. [Talia sighs]",
        "Ed: Ok, let's get back to the medal. You said that you were cleaning it so that you could read an inscription.",
        "Talia: Right.",
        "Ed: Well, could you make that out clearly?",
        "Talia: There is a -- a bird on it.",
        "Ed: Any particular kind of bird?",
        "Talia: It looked like a dove, I think. Wing was curved. It took up most of the middle of the piece.",
        "Ed: Anything else?",
        "Talia: Words -- written like in a circle.",
        "Ed: Can you make out what they are?",
        "Talia: Under the curved wing, there's -- there's a P -- U, T, U -- S.",
        "Ed: Is that all?",
        "Talia: I can't tell if it's a word or part of a word.",
        "Ed: Are there any other distinctive marks?",
        "Talia: Not that I can see. That's when he comes in.",
        "Ed: Ok, Talia, that's all we're going to do for now. I'm going to count to five again and then clap, and when I do, you'll be back here with us. One, two, three, four, five.",
        "Talia: How'd it go?",
        "Antonio: Well, you tell us, ok? That look familiar to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Well, our big problem isn't getting what we want, it's what we need, and that's money.",

        "Starr: Cole, it's not going to be enough. We'll have to raid my account, too, and we'll need help, fast. We should probably go soon while our parents are at work. This way we have lead time.",
        "Cole: You really have done this before.",
        "Starr: Yeah -- I have, when I was younger and stupid. I really didn't think it through.",
        "Cole: Well, what do you mean? Like what?",
        "Starr: I didn't think what it would be like to leave my family and friends. I thought that I could just ditch them and it wouldn't affect me, but it didn't work out that way.",
        "Cole: so are you saying you don't want to do this?",
        "Starr: No, I'm saying that I know how to play it now. We can't run away and act like it'll be forever. If we do that, then we'll end up on the streets, and that's a lot worse than military school.",
        "Cole: Ok, then why are we doing this?",
        "Starr: Because, Cole, we -- we have to show our parents that we're serious and that they can't control us. Once we're away for a while, we'll get in touch with them and we'll tell them that if they want us back, that they're going to have to do it our way.",
        "Cole: I hate making you do this.",
        "Starr: You're not. Our parents are. It's their fault that they can't understand that we love each other.",
        "Cole: I do, Starr. I do love you.",

        "Blair: No, you told Todd that you were the one that started it, and we both know that that's not the way it was.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, still, I -- I didn't want to screw things up for you and Todd.",
        "Blair: You didn't screw up anything that wasn't already damaged.",

        "Blair: And that would be a good thing.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. This might work.",
