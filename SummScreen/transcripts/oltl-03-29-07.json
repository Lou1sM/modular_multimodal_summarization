        "Bo: So what do you say, bud? Hot chocolate?",
        "Matthew: Starr drinks coffee.",
        "Bo: She does? Well, that's Starr. I don't think you're ready for coffee yet, huh, honey?",
        "Paige: Yeah, it'll -- it'll stunt your growth.",
        "Matthew: Definitely not, then. The girls in my grade are starting to wear high heels.",
        "Paige: They are? Well, you're not short.",
        "Matthew: It's relative, Paige.",
        "Bo: Did you just say --",
        "Paige: You are growing up so fast.",
        "Bo: Oh. Hot chocolate, then, huh?",
        "Paige: Yeah, I'm in.",
        "Matthew: Me, too, double the whipped cream.",
        "Paige: Oh, me, too.",
        "Bo: All right. You grab us a seat, I'll be right back.",
        "Matthew: Right here?",
        "Paige: Yeah, good, good. I'm surprised Nora let you out on a school night -- she's usually so strict.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, she thinks I'm cooped up at Asa's.",
        "Paige: Are you?",
        "Matthew: Not exactly. It's just -- it's just not our house, and we can't kick back, you know?",
        "Paige: Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. It must be hard to get your schoolwork done and all of that when you -- when you feel so displaced.",
        "Matthew: I'm doing fine, but my mom -- she's not doing too good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I didn't hear you right.",
        "John: You did.",
        "Natalie: Don't do this to me.",
        "Natalie: You weren't planning on what, John?",
        "John: I wasn't planning on proposing to you.",
        "Natalie: Wow. Natalie makes a big ass out of herself again, huh?",
        "John: No. Don't you do this to yourself -- I'm the ass here. I should've stepped up.",
        "Natalie: Well, you said \"last night\" -- I mean, that's what you just said. You just mean that you weren't ready yet, right? John, did you mean that you weren't ready to propose to me last night, or did you mean that you're not planning to propose to me at all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Where's Langston? Cole, she should be here by now.",
        "Cole: It's ok, don't worry. Are you sure you want to go through with this?",
        "Starr: Absolutely, Cole. I want to be with you.",
        "Cole: I was hoping you would say that.",
        "Starr: Our parents are going to have a hard time keeping us apart when we're not here. Maybe they'll learn to back off.",
        "Cole: Maybe. But who knows how they'll react to anything?",
        "Starr: They don't have a lot of choices -- either let us be together or they let us go.",
        "Cole: You're really willing to take it that far? I mean, are you willing to go away with me forever?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: You wanted something?",
        "Talia: I appreciate you coming in.",
        "Vincent: And what if I hadn't?",
        "Talia: Didn't you bring your lawyer with you?",
        "Vincent: If I see it getting to the point that I may need a lawyer, I'll give him a call. Now, what's up?",
        "Talia: Sit. Please sit. This mean anything to you?",
        "Vincent: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamie: Will come to the zoo with us, Mommy?",
        "Jessica: That's the first time you called me \"mommy. \"",
        "Jamie: I want you to be my mommy.",
        "Jessica: Well, sweetie, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it to the zoo.",
        "Antonio: Honey, why don't you find some crayons and draw us a picture. Well, uh, that was a little unexpected.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, it really was. I mean, I'm -- it was really sweet, but it was kind of a surprise.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, it was a surprise. But I guess --",
        "Jessica: Oh, here, let me help.",
        "Antonio: Oh, thank you, thanks. I guess it's kind of natural, I mean, for her to feel that way. You know, you have been kind of like a mother to her for a really long time.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Antonio: You don't have a problem with her calling you \"mommy, \" do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Are you really ready to go through with this? I mean, because you might wind up leaving your family for good.",
        "Starr: I wonder what it's like in Florida or New York right now.",
        "Cole: Ok. I get it -- you're avoiding the question. Even though you and your parents have been having a lot of trouble, I don't want to be the one responsible for taking you away from them. I th - they're still your family, and I know how much you love them.",
        "Starr: See, this is what I mean -- you always care about me and my family. What about -- what about you and your happiness?",
        "Cole: It's a big deal.",
        "Starr: I know, but it'll work out.",
        "Cole: And if it ? I mean, what if it just makes matters worse?",
        "Starr: Cole, if my parents are so stupid, they can't trust me to make the right decision, they won't let me live my own life. And if they make me choose, I choose you.",
        "Langston: Ahem. Sorry to break the moment.",
        "Starr: Thank you for coming.",
        "Langston: No prob. I hit the max on the ATM.",
        "Starr: You're the best.",
        "Langston: And here's the bracelet I borrowed. I wanted to give it back just in case I didn't get another chance.",
        "Starr: Langston, you'll get another chance -- when our parents beg us to come back and promise to leave us alone.",
        "Langston: You really think that's going to happen?",
        "Cole: Hey, if Starr thinks it's going to happen, then so do I.",
        "Langston: That's what I'm praying for.",
        "Cole: Hey, can I ask you one more favor?",
        "Langston: Sure.",
        "Cole: I wrote a letter to my mom, and I was wondering if you could mail it for me so that it will have a Llanview postmark on it? And this way, by the time she gets it, we'll be long gone.",
        "Langston: Of course I will.",
        "Cole: Thanks. Thanks for everything. Ok, this is not cool. I -- I know I put it in here.",
        "Starr: Well, then it has to be in there.",
        "Cole: But it's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Excuse me, excuse me, I need to file a missing person's report. My son -- he's run away.",
        "Officer: Have you got a picture of him?",
        "Marty: Yes. Um -- oh, God, it's -- um -- it's in my other wallet. It's here at the station -- it's evidence in the robbery that happened at the palace -- but you have his picture -- he's on probation.",
        "Officer: Then we can run a description of him through the national crime information center.",
        "Marty: No, no, that will take too long, and I need to find him now!",
        "Officer: That's procedure, ma'am.",
        "Marty: Well, look, is Commissioner Buchanan in?",
        "Officer: I'm afraid not.",
        "Marty: Well, how about Detective McBain?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Honestly?",
        "Natalie: That'd be nice.",
        "John: The way we've been to each other lately, I'm not seeing marriage.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, I'm such a freakin' idiot. What the hell have I done? I -- I told people. I told Jessica -- she's -- she probably already told Antonio-- I told my parents! God, what was I thinking? No, wait a minute -- how could I not think that you were going to ask me to marry you? I mean, John, why were you carrying around that ring in your pocket? Why did you take me out to dinner at the palace? Why did you tell me that you loved me?",
        "John: Because I do.",
        "Natalie: I waited so long to hear you say that. Ok. Ok. I mean, I always knew that you weren't the marrying type, and I -- I can accept that -- it's not like I have a choice. So -- so you don't need the paper. Then neither do I. I mean, we both know that we love each other, right, so -- or am I just making a fool out of myself again? I need to know, John. You love me, right? But you just don't want to spend the rest of your life with me? Do you even want to spend tomorrow with me? Is that -- is that why you brought me to the palace? You were going to break up with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, yes, I do think that it's a problem that Jamie's calling me \"Mommy.\" The biggest reason is that Keri loved her very much, and I don't want Jamie to forget that she had a real mommy.",
        "Antonio: Valid. Excuse me. I got a question for you. Do you know -- do you know where your real mommy is?",
        "Jamie: She's in heaven.",
        "Antonio: That's right. That's right, she's in heaven. And you're never going to forget her -- right? And you know that Jessica isn't your real mommy, right?",
        "Jamie: But I want to call her \"mommy. \"",
        "Antonio: Thank you, sweetheart. She's pretty incredible, isn't she?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Yeah, she really is. And I love her like a daughter, but, I mean, this isn't a little step.",
        "Antonio: I know, but it is a step that'll bond us closer together as a family.",
        "Jessica: Of course it will, and that's what I want more than anything else in the world. I mean, I see how committed you are to this family, to Jamie and to Bree, and of course I want this more than anything. But I want to make sure it's something that you really want.",
        "Antonio: I have absolutely no problem with it. I just want to make sure it's what you want, too. It is, isn't it?",
        "Marty's voice: I want you to write down the name of the man you want to be with -- not the man you think you should, but the man that you see yourself spending the rest of your life with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: What is it?",
        "Vincent: It's pure -- putus. It's Latin for pure. Now I know I surprised you with that one. You're thinking where did a man like me learn Latin?",
        "Talia: Is this your medallion?",
        "Vincent: You think I'm pure?",
        "Talia: Have you seen anything like this before?",
        "Vincent: Think it's the arsonist's?",
        "Talia: Are you not going to answer any of my questions?",
        "Vincent: It's not mine. Never was. How about that?",
        "Talia: Ok, well, do you see anything else in the drawing?",
        "Vincent: A dove. Which means peace. But you knew that. Purity and peace. Wow, a pure and peaceful arsonist. It's kind of ironic, huh? But also familiar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Ok, I know I put it in here.",
        "Starr: Ok, well, maybe it fell out when we were running over here.",
        "Cole: Yeah, that must be what happened. Hopefully, someone will find it and stick it in the mailbox.",
        "Langston: Are you guys going to be ok? I mean, where are you going to go? No, don't tell me. I don't want to break when your parents and the cops start torturing me.",
        "Starr: I hate putting you in this position.",
        "Cole: Yeah, especially if you have to talk to the cops.",
        "Langston: \"Starr and Cole ran away? I had no idea. I didn't even know they liked each other. I don't even know who they are. \" Don't worry, guys. I've got you covered all the way.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "Langston: Remember freshman English? It's just like \"Romeo and Juliet, \" and I'm nurse what's-her-face helping the young lovers. Except this isn't going to end in a tragedy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, when I was in the hospital, I had a lot of time to think about things, you know. How things could be different.",
        "Natalie: How could you not?",
        "John: In a strange way, it was almost easier being in that bed, wrapped up in all those bandages. It was kind of like I was invisible. And I felt like maybe I could start my whole life over again. But I was wrong. That's what last night was about. I wanted to explain to you who I am, and for better or worse, who I will always be. But I never got the chance.",
        "Natalie: Ok, you've got your chance now.",
        "John: Hey, look, can we take this someplace else? We have a lot to talk about.",
        "Natalie: You know what? I've changed my mind. I don't -- you don't have to give long speeches, and there's no interruptions. I just want a one-word answer. Are you breaking up with me, yes or no?",
        "Marty: John, thank God you're here. Look, I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I know how much you love her.",
        "Jessica: I'm only concerned with what's best for her. And having her call me \"Mommy\" is not the same thing as having one of our friends' kids call me \"aunt Jessica, \" you know?",
        "Antonio: No, it's not.",
        "Jessica: No. And what about RJ?",
        "Antonio: What about him?",
        "Jessica: Are you kidding me? Do you really think that he's not going to have a problem with the fact that I'm replacing his daughter as \"mommy\"?",
        "Antonio: Ok, you got a point. RJ's probably going to have some issues, yeah. But it's his granddaughter and he loves her, and he's going to support and understand whatever she decides to call you, honey. I mean -- Ok. Ahem. Since you brought up the issue of RJ, I suppose we ought to also talk about Nash.",
        "Jessica: Why? What does Nash have to do with any of this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: There he is.",
        "Bo: There you go.",
        "Paige: Oh, yay! Thank you.",
        "Bo: That ought to warm you up. Mmm.",
        "Paige: Wow.",
        "Bo: The coffee hits the spot.",
        "Paige: Coffee? At this time of night?",
        "Bo: Yeah, I think I deserve it, you know? Plus, I got a little more work to do before I hit the sack.",
        "Paige: Matthew was just telling me that he's -- he's worried about Nora.",
        "Bo: Still?",
        "Matthew: She's just stressed like when Mr. Colson got arrested. Do you think she could get sick again?",
        "Paige: Well, I'm not going to lie to you. It's possible, but I think her doctors are watching out for her, and she's going to be just fine as long as she takes her medications.",
        "Matthew: She does. We have a thing where she takes them in front of me in the morning so I don't worry.",
        "Paige: Ah, great.",
        "Bo: But I know that you still are worried, aren't you?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Bo: And I also know that there's nothing that Paige and I could say that would make you stop worrying.",
        "Matthew: Probably not.",
        "Bo: You see, son, it's just all part of loving someone. You -- you're always looking out for them, you're praying that you never lose them. You know, you're scared for them. That's -- that's the way it is with you. You know, with both of you. I mean, I just -- I love you two like crazy, and I guess, unfortunately, that just -- being scared comes with the territory.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Matthew: There's Starr's dad. Can I go say hi to him?",
        "Bo: Yeah, sure.",
        "Paige: That was a pretty grown-up conversation.",
        "Bo: I meant what I just said. I don't want to lose you, Paige.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "'Langston: One unidentifiable jacket.",
        "Starr: Hmm. Perfect.",
        "Langston: Is your name on it?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I have some papers of mine in there.",
        "Langston: Good. Oh, I have something for you. It's a pay-as-you-go. 10 hours of untraceable talk time.",
        "Starr: It's very cool.",
        "Langston: I want updates. I don't care where you are, you call me and you tell me how you are, and I'll let you know how your parents are doing.",
        "Starr: I love you so much, Langston.",
        "Cole: You know, I wish I had a friend as good as you.",
        "Starr: I'm going to miss you so much.",
        "Langston: Not for long, I hope.",
        "Starr: Me, too.",
        "Langston: As soon as your parents find out that you're gone, they're going to freak. They'll wake up, you'll see.",
        "Cole: Starr, we -- we better get going.",
        "Starr: Oh, you're my best friend.",
        "Langston: You're mine.",
        "Starr: Thank you so much for everything.",
        "Langston: Don't worry about it.",
        "Cole: Starr, come on, we got to go. Come on.",
        "Starr: Ok. I'll be back.",
        "Langston: I know.",

        "Natalie: If you don't mind, we're in the middle of a --",
        "Marty: I'm sorry, but this can't wait, ok? I didn't know what else to do!",
        "John: What is it?",
        "Marty: My son has run away with Starr Manning, and I -- I talked to an officer downstairs. He said I had to follow procedure, and I don't have time, ok? Because I need to get to him before Todd finds out that they're even missing, because I -- I don't know what he will do if he finds him before I do.",
        "John: Have a seat. I'll be right back. Please.",
        "Natalie: Oh -- oh.",
        "John: I'm sorry, I really am, but I got to take care we will talk about everything later. Everything, ok?",
        "Natalie: You can't give me an answer now?",
        "John: We'll talk later, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Whatever you say.",
        "John: How long's he been gone?",
        "Marty: Well, I saw him this afternoon, so sometime this evening.",
        "John: Has he ever run away before?",
        "Marty: No, we've always been really close, especially since Patrick died.",
        "John: Has he been getting in any more trouble at school?",
        "Marty: He's been sneaking around and lying.",
        "John: With Starr?",
        "Marty: Yeah, mm-hmm. The two of them -- they are just completely out of control.",
        "John: Ok, slow down. What do you mean by \"out of control\"?",
        "Marty: I mean they can't seem to keep away from each other, ok? And then you just throw Todd into the mix. Everything is just -- [Marty sighs]' It's just been an explosive situation.",
        "John: Yeah, manning does have a way of igniting things.",
        "Marty: And then I think I made a mistake by enrolling him in military school, but I thought he needed -- you know, a male figure in his life, but I -- I just don't think I should have.",
        "John: Ok, now, look, it's not the time to be coming down on yourself, lady, all right? Why -- why don't you just try to tell me what you know.",
        "Marty: Ok. I found this in the apartment. It has a stamp on it, so I don't think he meant for me to see it right now. He was probably going to mail it to me and I would -- I would find it later.",
        "John: Cole wrote that? What does it say?",
        "Marty: It says, \"I'm sorry, mom, but you've given me no choice but to run away and be with Starr. And you can't just send me to military school just to keep me away from her, and I guess you know that now. I know you love me. But you don't seem to respect me or my ability to make choices, and that's why I can't stay here in Llanview. So try to understand. If -- if someone had tried to keep you and dad apart, you'd know exactly how I feel. Take care yourself, and I love you, and -- and I hope we can be together again someday. Cole. \"",
        "John: Does he have any money?",
        "Marty: I don't know. Maybe enough to get a burger.",
        "John: Well, then he probably have enough to get them both out of town. Is there any particular place he likes to hang out?",
        "Marty: I don't know.",
        "John: Well, what does he like to do during the day?",
        "Marty: I don't know. Oh, I am just some kind of wonderful mother, aren't I? I don't even know what my son likes to do.",
        "John: Hey, look, I'll -- I'll give the patrol cars a heads-up to keep their eyes out for them, all right?",
        "Marty: Thank you, John.",
        "John: Yeah, well, you can thank me when you get your son back. Just stay here. No darts.",

        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Starr: You scared the crap out of me.",
        "Cole: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.",
        "Starr: No, it's ok. I'm just super paranoid right now.",
        "Cole: Starr, you have nothing to worry about. No one but Langston even knows we're gone.",
        "Starr: I know, but I just want to get on a bus and get out of here. Did you get the tickets?",
        "Cole: Yeah, yeah. They were pretty cheap, actually. And they're going to get us a lot farther than we thought we could go.",
        "Starr: Ok, good. And we still have the money that Langston gave us, so we should be ok.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Where are we going?",
        "Cole: We're going to Cleveland. Ok, I know -- I know it's not very romantic or anything, but it does have the rock and roll hall of fame. And, of course, Lebron James.",

        "Cole: Hey, listen, it's a big city, all right? We can blend in, and no one will ever find us. Plus, it's, like, 435 miles away from Llanview.",
        "Starr: No, that's -- that's perfect. We'll be halfway there before our parents even figure out that we're gone.",
        "Cole: Whew. So what do you think your dad would do if he knew I was with you right now?",
        "Starr: I don't think that you want to know. But I'll tell you one thing. With the threat of never seeing me again, he's going to hug you and welcome you into the family. No, really, believe me. He's going to be so happy to have me back that he'll gladly take back any threats that he's ever made against you. He's not a bad man. Really. It just takes a special kind of person to figure him out.",

        "Talia: I don't know. I didn't get that good of a look at the arsonist, but I got enough to know -- I don't think he was African-American. Our Mr. Jones was right when he said I knew he wasn't the arsonist. But I'm still not sold on the fact that his fingers weren't in the pie. You know what I'm saying?",

        "John: I don't know. You know, why would she leave her jacket behind? It's cold -- especially if you were going to run away. I mean, she's a pretty sophisticated kid. I'm starting to believe maybe she -- she left the Jacket behind to make us think they left town. You know what? Find out if there's any patrols near the bus station. P. A.",
