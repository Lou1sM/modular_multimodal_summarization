        "Starr: You have to choose.",
        "Langston: I can't.",
        "Starr: Well, you can't keep cheating on Markko. It's not fair and I'm not going to let you do that.",
        "Langston: No--Starr, you can't tell him.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? He deserves to know--",
        "Langston: Starr, please. I mean, I'm begging you, please don't say anything to him. I know that you love him but you're my best friend. I need you to keep this a secret for me until I figure out what I'm gonna do. Don't say anything to him. Promise me. Promise me that you won't tell him.",
        "Markko: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Roxy didn't take a flight. She's not at any of the bus stations or train stations.",
        "Marty: She's probably upstairs or downstairs doing laundry. She's got--",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marty: Those towels...",
        "John: Marty? Marty, what-- hey, hey, hey, all right. Easy. Easy. Marty. Marty. Are you with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Natalie: Schuyler! Schuyler, open up, it's Natalie. It's important! Your daughter's life is at stake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Here. Might help you relax.",
        "Gigi: Thanks. But I don't think I'll be able to relax until I know Sierra's okay.",
        "Rex: Schuyler said she was sleeping.",
        "Gigi: I know. I just wanted to see my sister's baby, just wanted to make sure she was okay.",
        "Rex: If T\u00e9a hadn't been there, I'm sure Schuyler would've let you.",
        "Gigi: That's what's so weird. I don't think he would have. He wasn't being himself. He was really guarded, like he was hiding something.",
        "Rex: You're not still worried he would take off with Sierra, are you?",
        "Gigi: I didn't get the feeling he was thinking about running.",
        "Rex: Do you think he's using again?",
        "Gigi: No. He wouldn't do that to his daughter.",
        "Rex: Then what?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. Ugh. I don't know. But something else is going on here, something that he did not want me to know about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Uhh.",
        "Mitch: I assume our transport is waiting at the ambulance bay?",
        "Schuyler: No, you're not going anywhere. Not until I get my daughter back.",
        "Mitch: If I'm not out of here on schedule, your daughter will die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: Hey, open up!",
        "Kelly: All right, standing out here banging and shouting isn't helping anything.",
        "Todd: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Guard: This door has been secured from the inside.",
        "Todd: Then unlock it from the outside.",
        "Guard: I'm getting the warden on the horn.",
        "Bo: Excuse me, Officer. Commissioner Buchanan. LPD. I wanted to speak with Mitch Laurence but I understand he's having chest pains?",
        "Todd: Oh, no. They weren't believable at all.",
        "Bo: What are you two doing here?",
        "Todd: None of your business.",
        "Kelly: Questioning Mitch about my mother's death.",
        "Bo: Look, I don't have to tell you. The guy is dangerous. Allison Perkins, she's on the loose--",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah? That nut job?",
        "Bo: That's the one. As I understand it, she's been visiting Mitch Laurence right here in prison. Now, could you please open the door?",
        "Guard: Commissioner, I was just calling the warden.",
        "Todd: He can't. We're locked out.",
        "Kelly: And Mitch is in there with Schuyler Joplin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Schuyler Joplin?",
        "Allison: He's supposed to break Mitch out of prison, but now here you are getting in the way.",
        "Kyle: Why would he do that?",
        "Allison: You are all so dim. Dim dim dim. Schuyler Joplin will do as he's told... because of this. Because I have something he wants.",
        "Kyle: Roxy? That's Sierra. What the hell are you doing with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I think you've got this a little backwards. If you don't get your psycho girlfriend to get down here and give me my daughter back safe and sound, you're the one who's gonna die.",
        "Mitch: Am I?",
        "Schuyler: Call her. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Starr and I were just talking about who we were gonna cast for the musical, and I guess it got kind of carried away.",
        "Markko: That's all it was?",
        "Starr: Yeah, that's what we were fighting about.",
        "Markko: Everyone's so tense today. Here. At the Buenos Dias.",
        "Langston: Did something happen at work?",
        "Markko: Nothing big. Just this run-in with Ford.",
        "Langston: Really? About what?",
        "Markko: About whether or not you're sleeping with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Oh, my God. What happened?",
        "John: She was overheated. She felt better, then she just collapsed.",
        "Oliver: Is she breathing?",
        "John: Her pulse is strong, but she needs a doctor.",
        "Oliver: We can put her in my patrol car.",
        "John: No. I don't want to move her. Not with the baby. Yeah, I need an ambulance to the Angel Square Hotel. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Please, Schuyler, tell me you did not change your number.",
        "T\u00e9a: Natalie, what are you doing here?",
        "Natalie: I really--I need to talk to Schuyler. It's urgent.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, if it's about the custody hearing--",
        "Natalie: No. No. It's not. It's Roxy. You know, I've been looking for her all day and I can't find her, so, I just thought maybe Schuyler would know where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: So, once Mitch gets what he wants, he'll give the baby back to Schuyler, right?",
        "Allison: That's up to the messenger.",
        "Kyle: Why would Mitch want to keep the baby? Roxy, Roxy, what did she say to you? What did you do to her?",
        "Allison: I simply told her the truth.",
        "Kyle: Okay, so, if all this is happening because Mitch thinks that Schuyler is Sierra's father, then you should know there's a good chance he's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Where do you think Schuyler could be hiding? Think he's got some sort of eleventh-hour legal maneuver?",
        "Gigi: Maybe. I don't know. But whatever it is, it seemed like part of him wanted to tell me about it.",
        "Rex: Maybe T\u00e9a wouldn't let him?",
        "Gigi: It was more than that. It was almost like...it seemed like he was scared.",
        "Rex: Well, yeah. The guy didn't bother to show up in court this morning. He knows that this could be his last night with his daughter. Ever.",
        "Gigi: There was something else. He said he needed to protect Sierra, to keep her safe.",
        "Rex: From you?",
        "Gigi: No, I don't think so. I can't explain it. But I got the feeling he wasn't talking about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: If you want to play chicken with me, boy, you're in way over your head. Allison has her instructions. If you fail to break me out of here--",
        "Schuyler: If that bitch hurts my daughter...",
        "Mitch: But you won't take that chance, will you?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Bo: Laurence! Open up. Bo Buchanan.",
        "Schuyler: I need you to back off, Commissioner. This is something I have to do. You stay the hell away or Mitch Laurence is a dead man.",
        "Warden: Commissioner.",
        "Bo: Warden. Seems we have a situation here.",
        "Warden: I understand a prisoner is holding one of our medical volunteers hostage.",
        "Bo: No, it looks like it's the other way around.",
        "Schuyler: You're right. I won't take any chances with my daughter's life.",
        "Mitch: Good. Then we can drop this charade.",
        "Schuyler: You know, the thing is, Mitch, I'm betting that Allison wouldn't take any chances with the messenger's life, either. I mean, she may have her orders, but there's no way in hell she's gonna let you die.",
        "Mitch: Oh, haven't you heard? I don't do death. It's not my time.",
        "[Mitch grunts]",
        "Schuyler: Your time is about to run out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Viki sighs]",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Viki: Hello? Hello? Look, I'm sorry. I can't hear you.",
        "Dorian: I said, \"Hello, Viki.\"",
        "Viki: Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: About whether or not I was what?!",
        "Markko: Yeah, I was in the kitchen and I could hear this argument, and it was getting pretty intense, so I came out and that's when Hannah accused Ford of sleeping with you.",
        "Starr: Hannah? You mean, Cole's sociology partner?",
        "Markko: Yeah, apparently they used to have a thing.",
        "Langston: They who? Hannah and Ford?",
        "Markko: Hannah said that Ford slept with her and then dumped her for you.",
        "Langston: Well, what did Ford say?",
        "Ford: Just that he and Hannah got together a few times. But then he moved on and so she went all stalker and made the whole thing up.",
        "Starr: Looks like she has some issues to deal with.",
        "Markko: Look, I don't know what went down between Ford and Hannah. All I know is that she was really convinced that Ford was sleeping with you. I mean, where would she even get an idea like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Geeg, I know it's hard to deal with right now, but I think you just need to let go of all this stuff with Schuyler and Sierra.",
        "Gigi: Let it go? What are you talking about?",
        "Rex: Just for now. Look at it this way--by this time tomorrow, we'll have already gone back to court, and Sierra will be home with you, where she belongs.",
        "Gigi: I can't count on that. If Schuyler wins permanent custody--",
        "Schuyler: He won't.",
        "Gigi: But if he does, I have to be prepared for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Dorian? Is that-- is that you?",
        "Dorian: Yes. Were you expecting someone else?",
        "Viki: Um...no. No. I'm just kind of surprised to hear from you. At this hour.",
        "Dorian: Glad to hear you're acclimated to London time.",
        "Viki: Why are you calling? Is there something wrong?",
        "Dorian: You're damn straight there's something wrong. I suggest that you give Charlie a second chance, and what do you do? You--you jump on the next plane to London.",
        "Viki: Dorian, I am traveling with my granddaughter to give Jessica some space.",
        "Dorian: And don't forget the 3,000 miles you've put between you and your husband.",
        "Viki: This has nothing to do with him.",
        "Dorian: Do you honestly expect me to believe that? What's wrong with you, Viki? Did you want to spend the rest of your life alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: What are you babbling about?",
        "Kyle: I'm saying there's a good possibility that Schuyler isn't Sierra's father.",
        "Allison: Oh. You think Rex is. Honey, that's old news. Sierra Rose is definitely Schuyler Joplin's daughter.",
        "Kyle: Why? Because Schuyler said so? Because Stacy Morasco said so? You know that Schuyler isn't the only one Stacy tried to sleep with when she lost Rex's baby. She made the rounds.",
        "Allison: I am well aware that the infant's mother was a harlot.",
        "Kyle: She even tried to seduce me into getting her pregnant.",
        "Allison: Ha! So, what you're saying is, the harlot asked a homosexual to sire her replacement offspring?",
        "Kyle: You want to give the messenger Schuyler's baby, right? What if Sierra isn't his baby at all?",
        "Allison: I know what you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Why would Schuyler know where Roxy is?",
        "Natalie: Um... he used to live at her hotel, so I thought, maybe, I don't know. I don't-- I don't know.",
        "T\u00e9a: Natalie, are you all right?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "T\u00e9a: Seem a little agitated.",
        "Natalie: No, I just--I really-- I really need to speak to Schuyler.",
        "T\u00e9a: Does this have anything to do with Allison Perkins being on the loose?",
        "Natalie: You know about Allison?",
        "T\u00e9a: I was just down at the police station and Bo was talking about her. You're not worried about Schuyler, are you?",
        "Natalie: No. No, of course not. Why would I be?",
        "T\u00e9a: Tell you what--why don't we go find the super, get into his apartment and just check up on him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey. Marty. Open your eyes, sweetie. Open your eyes. Hey.",
        "Marty: What happened?",
        "John: No, no, no. Don't do that. Listen to me. Listen to me. You passed out.",
        "Marty: How long?",
        "John: Couple of minutes. All right? I didn't want to move you until I knew what was wrong.",
        "Marty: The baby?",
        "John: I called 911. They'll be here any minute. Hey. Go get Kyle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: You're playing mind games with me. You're messing with my head! I respect that. But it won't work. Ah, no. No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Kyle: I'm not messing with you, Allison. There's a good possibility Schuyler isn't--",
        "Allison: Okay. I'll bite. If Schuyler isn't the father, who is?",
        "Oliver: Kyle?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Oliver: Kyle, it's Oliver. Let me in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Warden: Schuyler Joplin isn't even on the schedule for today. He must have appropriated someone else's medical clearance.",
        "Bo: Well, if he went out of his way to be here, he must have a score to settle. Now, either one of the two of you, do you know what he wants?",
        "Todd: No, but what difference does it make? I say we let Joplin kill the son of a bitch so we can go home.",
        "Kelly: I've been researching his custody case for \"The Sun,\" and I never found any connection between Schuyler or Laurence.",
        "Bo: As far as we know, there isn't one.",
        "Todd: I have a novel idea. Why don't you ask him?",
        "Bo: You know what, Manning? I think that's a great idea, and I'm gonna do that. Right after you two get out of here.",
        "Kelly: I can't. Bo, please. Not until I find out if Mitch murdered my mother.",
        "Bo: Look, Kelly, I know you want answers, all right? But--",
        "Kelly: I mean it. I'm not going until I get what I came for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: What was in that syringe?",
        "Schuyler: You know what? I'm glad you asked. What's in that syringe is a slow- acting pharmaceutical that will stop your heart for real in about... ooh. Tick tock.",
        "Mitch: You're bluffing.",
        "Schuyler: Am I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Where the hell is that ambulance?",
        "Marty: It's okay. You said they'd be here soon.",
        "John: Look at me--I'm supposed to be keeping you calm.",
        "Marty: Ha. We'll just take turns, okay? Whoo.",
        "[Exhaling]",
        "Marty: What's wrong? What is it?",
        "John: Nothing. Nothing. Everything's fine.",
        "Marty: I wouldn't have passed out if everything was fine.",
        "John: Hey. Listen to me. Everything's okay.",
        "Marty: John--",
        "John: Just stay still.",
        "Marty: My God, something's wrong with the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Why would Hannah think Ford and I were...I mean, are you really asking me that?",
        "Markko: I'm just trying to figure out what gave her that impression.",
        "Langston: Well, I don't know. Maybe she saw Ford say hi to me and then assumed that we were--",
        "Markko: She said something about how Ford takes girls to his office to...you know.",
        "Langston: Well, maybe she saw me there waiting for you.",
        "Markko: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you were there the other day.",
        "Langston: Yeah, so it's like Ford said. She got jealous and made the whole thing up.",
        "Markko: I'm not so sure Hannah's lying.",
        "Langston: You think I'm sleeping with Ford?",
        "Markko: No. No-no-no. Of course not.",
        "Langston: Then what are you saying?",
        "Markko: Just that it was pretty obvious that Ford really messed her up.",
        "Langston: Well, even if he did--",
        "Markko: That's no excuse for Hannah to drag you into it.",
        "Langston: Thank you.",
        "Markko: Just do me a favor? Steer clear of Ford.",
        "Langston: Markko, there's nothing going on--",
        "Markko: I know, I know, but the guy's bad news. It's like everywhere he goes, there's all this crazy drama.",
        "Langston: Too bad it couldn't help out with the David Vickers reality show.",
        "Markko: Yeah. Well, just steer clear of him, okay?",
        "Langston: Hey, you want to go catch a movie?",
        "Markko: Maybe later. I'm gonna go shower. I'm all sweaty from work.",
        "Langston: Okay.",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. Can you believe Hannah would say something like that?",
        "Starr: Why not? It's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I wish Bo would've agreed to let me talk to Mitch.",
        "Gigi: No, you don't.",
        "Rex: What if I could find out what he and Allison are up to?",
        "Gigi: That's why we have Bo and the police and everyone else who isn't his offspring--so you can stay away from Mitch Laurence.",
        "Rex: I guess.",
        "Gigi: You called Moe and Noelle to check on Shane, didn't you?",
        "Rex: Shane's safe. Besides, I don't think Allison would go after him.",
        "Gigi: Shane is Mitch's grandson.",
        "Rex: Yeah, but he's too old. He wouldn't be able to mold him in his image. Dear old dad likes to start out early... with babies.",
        "Gigi: Which is why I thank God Sierra isn't related to that maniac.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, thank you. Schuyler?",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you so much. Super: You really his lawyer?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I really am. Natalie?",
        "Natalie: Schuyler's not here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you sure?",
        "Natalie: I have to go.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why, Natalie? What is wrong? You said you had something to tell Schuyler. I am his lawyer. Whatever you have to tell him you can tell me.",
        "Natalie: I can't.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why not?",
        "Natalie: If I tell you...",
        "T\u00e9a: What? Look, you said you had to look for Roxy. Does that have anything to do with Allison?",
        "Natalie: What do you know about Allison?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, what do you know about Allison? Any connection between Allison and Schuyler, anything at all that could help him and his little girl.",
        "Natalie: Okay. She was kidnapped. Allison took her. She--she has Schuyler's little girl.",
        "T\u00e9a: How do you know? Did you see them?",
        "Natalie: I don't know what she's gonna do.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, Natalie, listen to me very carefully. You have to tell me everything you know.",

        "Bo: You two stay out here. You interfere, you're gone.",
        "Kelly: Bo.",
        "Bo: Backup on the way?",
        "Warden: Yes, sir.",
        "Bo: Let's keep Schuyler occupied.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Bo: Schuyler! Talk to me. Why are you doing this? What do you want?",
        "Schuyler: Uh, uh, it's okay, Commissioner. Got it covered. How you doing over there? Feel it yet? Huh? The old ticker winding down?",
        "Mitch: If I die, you will never get your daughter back.",
        "Schuyler: No, you're not gonna die. You're not gonna die because you're gonna call Allison and you're gonna tell her to get down here with my daughter. And when I have my child safe and sound... I'll give you the antidote.",
        "Mitch: You have an antidote?",
        "Schuyler: Yes, sir. Yes, I do. Safe and secure. And I will give it to you and it will save you. But you're running out of time, you sick son of a bitch. Call her. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Heaven knows you are not perfect, and you can't forgive Charlie for one mistake? I don't need to go into details, do I? Viki? Viki, are you there?",
        "Viki: Yes, Dorian. I'm still here. I just don't see how my marriage is any of your business.",
        "Dorian: Well, of course not. You fled the country.",
        "Viki: I did not flee.",
