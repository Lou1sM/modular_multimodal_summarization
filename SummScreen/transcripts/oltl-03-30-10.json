        "Roxy is ready to drop a bombshell on Rex and Natalie that she just found out from Allison Perkins. She confesses that although throughout Rex's life, she believed that she conceived him with Mitch, he is not the child of either of theirs. While Allison is in the infirmary room with Mitch, Schuyler, and the baby, she reveals to them that Schuyler is Mitch's son and not Rex and that would make Sierra Mitch's granddaughter. Yet, Oliver opens the envelope with the DNA results from the hospital and learns that Sierra is his child. So he's determined to save her. Jessica wants to get Cristian back."

        "John: Hang on, Marty.",
        "Marty: Page Dr. Morrison.",
        "John: Your O.B.? As soon as we get you settled. How are you?",
        "Marty: I'm fine. It's the baby I'm worried about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: See? I told you we could work together.",
        "Cristian: And I'm very grateful for your help, Jessica. So, what do you think?",
        "Jessica: Looks great. Really great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Thank you very much.",
        "Kim: Good news?",
        "Clint: Allison Perkins has been found. That's all the desk sergeant would tell me, but that means that the girls are safe.",
        "Kim: Thank God, right?",
        "Clint: Right.",
        "Kim: Oh, good.",
        "Clint: So, how are things with your little girl?",
        "Kim: Sierra Rose? Well, I just spoke with that lawyer that you hired and she said the baby's as good as ours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Sierra Rose is mine? She's my daughter?",
        "Kyle: Congratulations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Allison has Sierra Rose?",
        "Roxy: She grabbed the baby from Schuyler. She broke into the hair haven--I walked in on her. And I tried to talk her into giving back the baby--the right baby.",
        "Rex: What do you mean, \"The right baby\"? What is she talking about?",
        "Natalie: Well, when I walked in, Allison had pulled out a gun.",
        "Roxy: She took the baby and I tried to stop her. Rex, I didn't know. I swear.",
        "Rex: You didn't know what?",
        "Roxy: I didn't know that you weren't--",
        "Natalie: Rox, you're bleeding.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. She tied me up.",
        "Natalie: Allison tied you up?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, me and Kyle. And then she took the baby.",
        "Rex: Where?",
        "Natalie: How did you get loose?",
        "Roxy: Fish. Fish came and he called Bo. Fish was right on the case.",
        "Rex: So, where is the baby? Roxy?",
        "Roxy: I lost him.",
        "Rex: No--Sierra Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You let Allison Perkins take a baby in there with Joplin and Laurence?",
        "Warden: She was armed.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but now instead of having one hostage, we have two.",
        "Warden: Hey. I didn't see another solution.",
        "Bo: Do you have blueprints for this building?",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Warden: They're in my office.",
        "Bo: Yeah, Balsom?",
        "Rex: Roxy just told me that Allison has Stacy's baby.",
        "Bo: They're here at Statesville.",
        "Rex: Statesville?",
        "Bo: Some kind of a scheme with Laurence.",
        "Rex: I'm on my way.",
        "Bo: No, no, no, no. You stay right there. You'd just be getting in the way. They're isolated and Perkins has no way of getting out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: I'm not handing over your baby until you administer the antidote.",
        "Schuyler: I'm sorry, but it doesn't work like that. You give me Sierra Rose and then I'll take care of your little pal here. And just so you know, I have no problem letting him die.",
        "Allison: Isn't that funny? Same goes for her. So, it looks like we have a stalemate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hey! Watch it.",
        "Jessica: You watch it.",
        "Cristian: You did not just do that. You know you're asking for it.",
        "Jessica: What are you gonna do? [Gasps] [Laughs] No, stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Where the hell's this doctor?",
        "Marty: She'll be here.",
        "Dr. Morrison: Sorry--I had a C-section. Twins. So, what's going on?",
        "Marty: I got a little overheated and--",
        "John: She got dizzy, and she passed out and she's bleeding-- spotting-- whatever you want to call it.",
        "Dr. Morrison: John, how about you wait outside so I can examine the patient?",
        "Marty: No, it's okay, it's okay. Why don't you call the station, let them know, and I'll be fine, okay?",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Marty: Okay. It's okay. [Exhales]",
        "Marty: He's scared.",
        "Dr. Morrison: Of course he is. So, let's see what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Bo: John, where the hell are you?",
        "John: The hospital. Something's--something's going on with Marty. We're in the E.R.",
        "Bo: Is she okay?",
        "John: Don't know yet. I-- I did get a call from Natalie. It might have something to do with Allison.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, we found Allison. She's locked in the Statesville infirmary with Laurence and Schuyler Joplin and his baby. Don't ask. Anyway, they can't get out, so there's no need for you to come down here.",
        "John: Bo, you gotta get in there before--",
        "Bo: Look, I'm on it. I've got our people here, so there's nothing else that you could really do. Look, you stay there, take care of Marty and the baby. They're the ones that need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Ahh. Is the baby all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: No windows, no doors, other than that one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Whoa, I thought you said the baby was important to Mitch. You're not gonna hurt her.",
        "Allison: But then I'm crazy, so who knows what I'd do to get what I want? Isn't that right, Mitch?",
        "Mitch: Her loyalty knows no bounds.",
        "Allison: See? You willing to risk your own flesh and blood?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I always knew that it was possible that I could've fathered Stacy's child, but I just...I convinced myself that she wasn't mine. And that's not true, I know. If I convinced myself, I would've thrown this away, but I didn't because-- I don't know. I guess I always knew.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, you haven't been sleeping very well lately.",
        "Oliver: And then once this custody fight started, I'd wake up thinking about where she was gonna end up, and then when you told me that Allison Perkins had kidnapped her, I just-- I don't know, Kyle. I just suddenly felt...God, I can't even describe it. Like, I'm a cop and I'm used to feeling responsible and saving people and taking care of them, and I just...this felt...",
        "Kyle: Paternal?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Yeah, paternal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Allison, think. Think. The police are right outside this door. If you hurt my daughter--",
        "Allison: They'll send me back to St. Ann's.",
        "Schuyler: You can't hurt her. She's helpless.",
        "Allison: No, she isn't. She has her big, strong daddy here to protect her. And all he has to do is give Mitch the antidote.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, and then what? You're trapped.",
        "Allison: The messenger will find a way.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, not if-- not if he dies, he won't. Now, you give me back my daughter before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm gonna call Gigi, let her know what's going on.",
        "Natalie: Rex, wait a minute, because you know what? Gigi can't do anything. This is just gonna drive her crazy.",
        "Roxy: There's nothing worse than worrying about a baby. And I oughta know.",
        "Natalie: What--what do you mean, Rox?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Give the child to Schuyler. She means nothing to me.",
        "Allison: Oh, but you're wrong, Mitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: [Cries] I'm sorry. I didn't know.",
        "Rex: You didn't know what?",
        "Natalie: Hey, Roxy. I know that you're worried about Sierra Rose because Allison has her, but don't worry--Uncle Bo is there and he's not gonna let one bad thing happen to that baby.",
        "Roxy: I'm not worried about her.",
        "Allison: This baby means the world to you.",
        "Rex: So, why are you so upset?",
        "Roxy: Allison told me something. Something about you and me, Rexy.",
        "Natalie: Allison's crazy, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: I know that, but this time she was telling the truth. And now I gotta tell you. [Crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Morrison: John?",
        "Marty: Baby's all right. Huh.",
        "John: Baby's all right?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: Good. That's good. I didn't call Cole.",
        "Marty: No, no, no. We can call him later and--I promise. I promise to be good from now on, okay? Take better care of myself.",
        "Dr. Morrison: You both need to take care of yourselves-- you've got a baby coming. And trust me, they're a lotta work. But there is something we need to talk about. There's something else going on. Marty, you didn't just collapse because you were overtired. There is a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: She's mine. I should have known.",
        "Kyle: Hey. Don't beat yourself up, okay?",
        "Oliver: It's just gonna affect so many people. Gigi, who's suing for custody, Schuyler, who thinks that she's his. I could've avoided all of that if I had just stepped up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So, I ran into Gigi at the courthouse. She was trying to act cool, but I could tell she was totally nervous--especially when Rex admitted that Stacy's always wanted me to raise her kid.",
        "Clint: He's gonna have to testify to that, you know.",
        "Kim: Yeah. Yeah, I told the lawyer. Anyways--and Schuyler is not even a threat, not when they find out that he's an addict and a thief and a liar.",
        "[Clint chuckles]",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Clint: You. You're funny.",
        "Kim: Whatever it takes-- that's my motto.",
        "Clint: I can see that.",
        "Kim: You sure you're up for this?",
        "Clint: Ahh. Why? Do you mean that when Sierra Rose is 16, I'll be 116?",
        "Kim: No, you're gonna be the same handsome mogul you are right now. I mean, are you sure you're ready to raise another kid? It's a lot of work and you're done. You sure you wanna start all over again?",
        "Clint: Done? You're never done-- not if you love your kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Layla.",
        "Layla: I came by to pick up my boyfriend. I knew he was working late with his students.",
        "Jessica: Oh, I was the only one that volunteered.",
        "Layla: Really?",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Cristian: I gotta--I gotta take this. What's going on?",
        "Brody: We found Allison Perkins. Jess is safe--you're off duty. Hey--and thanks, buddy.",
        "Cristian: No problem. Jess, thanks for your help, but I think we should pack for the day. We're done.",
        "Jessica: Okay. I'll go get cleaned up.",
        "Cristian: Okay. I know what you're thinking, but I promise you there's a perfectly good explanation.",
        "Layla: I can't wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Commissioner, I got here as fast as I could.",
        "Bo: Been briefed?",
        "Brody: My C.O. brought me up to speed.",
        "Bo: Good, good. This is Officer Lovett, former Navy Seal.",
        "Warden: You've been trained in hostage negotiations?",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. But there's no negotiating with Allison Perkins. She's a psychopath, so...we've gotta figure another way to get those people out of there safely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: I don't have time to indulge you, Allison. Stacy was a whore. She lied. Sierra is not Rex's child.",
        "Allison: No, she's not. That's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You don't understand. I was trying to protect you.",
        "Natalie: You were.",
        "Roxy: No, you don't have any idea.",
        "Rex: Look. I understand why you didn't tell me about Mitch Laurence. I get it.",
        "Roxy: No, you don't get it!",
        "Natalie: Roxy, if Mitch was my dad, I wouldn't wanna know, either.",
        "Roxy: But that's just it. I thought I was protecting you, but I wasn't. Leah didn't tell you this, but she lied to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: We all know Rex isn't the father of this baby. But Sierra Rose is your granddaughter just the same.",
        "Mitch: You're not making sense.",
        "Schuyler: You see him? Look at his color, Allison. His heart is failing.",
        "Allison: So, give him the antidote.",
        "Schuyler: Not until you hand over my daughter.",
        "Allison: Don't do this, Schuyler. Don't let him die. You'll never forgive yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: All this time, I was afraid--of nothing. Because she lied. Mitch Laurence is not your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Huh Allison, why would I care whether Mitch Laurence lives or dies?",
        "Allison: Because he's your father.",
        "Schuyler: You are out of your mind. This bastard is not my father.",
        "Allison: [Chuckles] Did you know your father?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah--he left when I was a kid. I saw pictures. My mother used to talk about him. He was not Mitch Laurence.",
        "Mitch: I have never known a-- what--Leah Joplin.",
        "Allison: No, you never knew Leah Joplin. But that doesn't matter, because she wasn't Schuyler's mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Roxy, I'm not up for playing \"who's your daddy?\" Today.",
        "Roxy: And I don't blame you.",
        "Rex: It was bad enough finding out that psycho is my father.",
        "Roxy: He is not your father. I swear to you--Mitch Laurence is not your father.",
        "Rex: You swore up and down he was.",
        "Roxy: I know. I thought he was, but I was wrong, and all these years, I've been trying to keep something from you that wasn't true. Mitch Laurence is not your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: Allison, enough. Just get the antidote.",
        "Allison: Of course, messenger. Schuyler won't let his daddy die. But let me start from the beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Roxy, are you saying that you didn't have sex with Mitch Laurence?",
        "Roxy: Oh, I had sex with Mitch, all right. Sonofabitch made me pregnant.",
        "Rex: Then I don't understand.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, if Mitch got you pregnant, then that means Mitch is Rex's father.",
        "Roxy: Oh, he's the father. I carried his kid for 9 months, 9 long months, and Allison Perkins checked up on me every day to make sure that I was taking care of the messenger's little brat.",
        "Rex: Okay. It's okay.",
        "Roxy: No, it's not okay! It's not okay and it's never gonna be okay, because I hated that kid. I hated what was inside of me. And I wanted to love it. [Sniffles]",
        "Roxy: And I pretended that Mitch wasn't the father, but Allison was always around to remind me. And she used to leave, and I used to take a drink. And that's probably why he was sick.",
        "Natalie: Who?",
        "Roxy: The baby. Because of all the drinking. I didn't tell you-- that's why he almost didn't make it.",
        "Allison: Nurse! Nurse! Where's Dr. Perkins?",
        "Nurse: Dr. Perkins?",
        "Allison: The obstetrician. I need her. It's an emergency.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: My sister was a doctor. She was our only hope for saving the baby.",
        "Roxy: No.",
        "Allison: Roxy, you're about to pass out. You just had a baby. Go lie down.",
        "Roxy: But the baby--",
        "Allison: I'll take care of him. Go lie down in that cubicle and keep your mouth shut.",
        "Woman: Allison?",
        "Allison: Thank God. What took you so long?",
        "Woman: You asked for Dr. Perkins. We haven't seen each other in such a long time. Allison, I was married. It's Dr. Joplin now.",
        "Allison: My sister tried her best.",
        "Dr. Joplin: Allison, I'm sorry. There's nothing more I can do.",
        "Allison: What are you saying? Is he going to die?",
        "Dr. Joplin: If his heart gives out before the drugs kick in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I waited in that cubicle, waiting to hear news about my son. Wondering if he'd live. Praying that he'd die. I know it's wrong. I didn't want any kid of Mitch Laurence's to be roaming the earth. I wanted my own kid dead.",
        "Rex: Look, Roxy, I understand.",
        "Roxy: No, you don't understand. You don't understand at all. It was just the beginning. It got worse.",
        "Natalie: Roxy, we know what happens next, but I don't think either one of us blames you. We know that you did the best that you could and that you loved us.",
        "Roxy: Of course I love you. No matter who you are and how you got here, you'll always be my kids.",
        "Natalie: We know that.",
        "Roxy: So, I think you deserve to hear the truth.",
        "Rex: Rox, I understand how you felt. It wasn't me you didn't want. It was Mitch.",
        "Roxy: No, I love you. I love you so much, and you'll always be my Rexy. And after you hear what I tell you, if you don't want to be around me, I'll understand that. But I should've known that someone so smart and so handsome and so funny could never ever be his son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What's wrong?",
        "Dr. Morrison: Marty, do you have a history of high blood pressure? It's not here in your chart.",
        "Marty: No. No, my blood pressure has always been normal. Why? Has it spiked?",
        "Dr. Morrison: That's probably why you got dizzy.",
        "John: Is this because she's pregnant or--",
        "Dr. Morrison: In patients with normal blood pressure, a spike like this is often associated with the pregnancy, and P.I.H. is a serious problem. It's also called toxemia, pre-eclampsia",
        "John: In English, Doc.",
        "Marty: She just means that because of the pregnancy, my blood pressure has spiked, and the high blood pressure is-- well, it's dangerous to both me and the baby.",
        "Dr. Morrison: This is a high-risk pregnancy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: So, the only reason why you were here alone with Jessica is because Brody asked you to keep an eye on her?",
        "Cristian: And that was just him on the phone telling me it was okay to cut her loose. Listen, I told her I didn't think it was a good idea for her to be on the set crew.",
        "Layla: Only you had to let her join because of Brody.",
        "Cristian: Right, but I'm gonna get other kids to sign up, and she's going out with Brody, anyway.",
        "Layla: They're dating?",
        "Cristian: That's the plan. So you don't have to worry. I mean, yes, I'm gonna see Jessica at school, but you're the one I come home to.",
        "Layla: Sorry. Not into paint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: You know, I don't know a thing about babies. You're gonna have to teach me. I mean, you're a whiz at this parenting thing. Look how your kids turned out.",
        "Clint: Oh, that reminds me. I've got a present for you.",
        "Kim: A present?",
        "Clint: A present. Close your eyes.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Clint: Open your eyes.",
        "Kim: A book. Great. I'll read it.",
        "Clint: Yes. I want you to read it while you are wearing this.",
        "Kim: Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.",
        "Clint: Yes. Let's put it on.",
        "Kim: Why? What is this for?",
        "Clint: Well, I like to see you smile...",
        "Kim: Ha!",
        "Clint: And for your information, I'm officially done with work today.",
        "Kim: Well, then why don't you and me go have a little fun?",
        "Clint: I don't know.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Clint: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Hold that naughty thought, would you? Hi, Jessie.",
        "Jessica: Hey, Dad. Can you pick me up from school? I missed the bus.",
        "Clint: Sure, honey. I'll be right there. Yeah. I have to go pick up my daughter.",
        "Kim: Are you kidding?",
        "Clint: No.",
        "Kim: Okay. Hurry back.",
        "Clint: I think I will.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "[Kim sighs]",
        "Kim: God, I did it, Stace. Got the life I always wanted-- beyond-decent guy, lots of money, and now your kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Oh, I'm a father.",
        "Kyle: Of a gorgeous little girl.",
        "Oliver: And now she's in trouble because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: It's been a while.",
        "Bo: Yeah, it's been too long. Should've heard something by now.",

        "Schuyler: You're telling me that my mother was your sister, that you're my aunt? I don't think so.",
        "Allison: It's true nonetheless.",
        "Mitch: Did the baby die? Did my son die?",
        "Allison: Patience, messenger. I'm getting to that. Your son's heart was failing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I wanted him to die. I did because that's the only way that Mitch would ever leave me alone. He's such an evil son of a bitch, and I knew he was gonna start taking things out on me, and--worse than that, Natty--I knew he might hurt you, and I could never let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: I couldn't tell the messenger his son was a pathetic, sickly specimen, that he died. He was expecting the chosen one, a strong, vibrant heir to carry on his work.",
        "Mitch: But the baby, my son, you said his heart--",
        "Allison: Was failing, yes, but then fate stepped in and solved the problem.",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Nurse's voice: It's such a shame.",
        "Second nurse's voice: I know-- a beautiful, healthy little boy just abandoned.",
        "Nurse's voice: At least the mother, whoever she is, left him here. Could've been so much worse.",
        "Second nurse's voice: That case last summer when the mother dumped her kid--",
        "Nurse's voice: In the trash. I remember. At least your mommy left you here.",
        "Allison's voice: Oh, my baby. I'm so sorry. I made a mistake. Oh, honey, sweetie, baby, darling, oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, I love him so much, I don't want to give him up.",
        "Allison: They believed me. It was almost too easy. Then I realized it was God's will. I needed a healthy baby, and he gave me one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I waited for what seemed like forever. And then Allison finally came back.",
        "Roxy: Is he okay?",
        "Allison: He's perfectly fine.",
        "Roxy: I thought it was gonna be a miracle... but it wasn't. [Sighs]",

        "John: Are you saying this pregnancy puts Marty's health at risk?",
        "Dr. Morrison: Not necessarily. These are warning signs, but Marty is gonna have to come in a lot more frequently for checkups...",
        "Marty: Well, I'm here all the time, anyway.",
        "Dr. Morrison: And you are going to need to cut back on your workload. I told you, Marty. You need more rest. You need a full 8 hours every night and a nap every afternoon.",
        "Marty: A nap?",
        "John: Type \"A,\" Doc.",
        "Dr. Morrison: Aren't we all?",
        "Marty: Okay. Well, at least you're not telling me I've got to go on bed rest. You're not putting me on bed rest, are you?",
        "John: What is bed rest?",
        "Dr. Morrison: Occasionally, a mother is literally put to bed for the duration of the pregnancy.",
        "John: In the hospital?",
        "Dr. Morrison: It could come to that. Right now, I would like to admit Marty overnight for observation just to be safe.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "John: And she's gonna do the nap thing, and she's gonna cut back on her workload, right? You're gonna cut back--",
        "Marty: I will do whatever it takes for the sake of this baby. You both know that.",
        "Dr. Morrison: And if you have any symptoms, anything at all, you are to call me right away.",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Dr. Morrison: And now I need to check on your blood work and get you admitted. I'll be right back.",
        "Marty: Okay. Thanks. Whew.",
        "John: Easy. It's going to be okay.",
        "Marty: Ah, yeah. Okay. Well, it's a little more than you bargained for. I'm sorry.",
        "John: Hey, you're the one that's got to take the naps, you know? I figure I got it easy.",
        "Marty: Yeah. It would be naps.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Marty: How about you, though, huh? You were a little rocky when you walked in here.",
        "John: I want this kid.",
        "Marty: I can see that.",
        "John: You know, the thought that we might lose this chance just made it real, you know?",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm. I do know. Sometimes it just takes something like this to make you realize how important someone is to you.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitch: And you passed this foundling off as my son?",
        "Allison: I thought it was God's plan.",
        "Mitch: You lied to me.",
        "Allison: But I made up for it in so many ways.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay. None of this-- none of this makes any sense. If his biological child died, how is Sierra his grandchild, Allison? How am I his son?",
        "Allison: It was all up to Roxy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: This isn't my baby.",
        "Allison: Of course it is.",
        "Roxy: No. My baby had a little mole over there.",
        "Allison: No. That was just a little piece of dirt. The nurses cleaned it off. Isn't he beautiful? Mitch will be so pleased.",
        "Roxy: I bought it, all right. I let Allison convince me that the baby that she put in my arms was the baby that I gave birth to.",
        "Allison: You need to take this baby over to Statesville so Mitch can see his beautiful new son. He's expecting you.",
        "Roxy: Aren't you coming, Allison?",
        "Allison: I need to stay and thank my sister for saving this baby's life. Oh, and don't mention any of this to Mitch. Just say he's perfect and that I'll be by later. Now go on. We don't want to make him angry.",
        "Roxy: So, I left the hospital with a kid that wasn't mine.",
        "Rex: So, wait a minute. The baby you took to Mitch--",
        "Roxy: It was you. Somebody left you at the hospital, and we don't know who. And Allison took you from the nurses, and she put you in my arms, and I just bought it. And Allison convinced me because I was so scared of Mitch that I just sucked it up. So then I took you to the prison to see Mitch, and I made sure that he looked at you. And I never looked back.",
        "Natalie: So, all this time, you believed--",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. Oh, I believed it. Yeah. Allison convinced me, but that wasn't the truth, because Mitch isn't your father. And I'm not your mother. [Sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: Roxy never knew the truth. She thought the baby I handed her, the baby she raised, was Mitch's son. She still doesn't know what happened next.",
        "Schuyler: Please tell me somebody at this hospital stepped in.",
        "Allison: My sister, in ways you never imagined.",
        "Allison: Leah, my God, is that--",
        "Leah: Yes. The child you left with me. His heart held up, and his drugs kicked in. He's gonna be fine. Where's the mother? We've got to tell her the great news.",
        "Allison: Roxy was already on her way to the prison with the other baby. I couldn't get to her in time. I had no choice. There was no turning back. Besides, his real child was sickly. He was better off with the healthy baby.",
        "Schuyler: So, what happened to the sick one?",
        "Leah: Where's the mother?",
        "Allison: You're looking at her.",
        "Leah: What do you mean?",
        "Allison: It's my baby. I gave birth to him.",
        "Leah: Allison, I had no idea. Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Allison: I thought he was a goner.",
        "Leah: No. He's a beautiful boy, and he's gonna be fine. Here. What is the matter?",
        "Allison: You know me. I'm not really the maternal type.",
        "Leah: What do you mean?",
        "Allison: I don't want him.",
        "Leah: What?",
        "Allison: He'd be better off with somebody else.",
        "Leah: Oh, Allison. Think about what you're saying. A baby is a precious gift. And for people like me who are unable to have children of their own, the idea of giving it away is just-- it's inconceivable. Are you sure this is what you want?",
        "Allison: Leah, I need you to do me another favor.",
        "Allison: That's how Leah Joplin became the mother of your biological child, Mitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Well, you know, we're gonna get you to bed at a decent hour, and you're gonna start taking naps.",
        "Marty: And any sign of dizziness, I'll come in. Don't forget, I'm a doctor.",
        "John: Yeah. My brother is a doctor. They make the worst patients.",
        "Marty: Don't you think it's maybe the McBains who make the worst patients?",
        "John: Oh, I see how you are. Don't forget, I'm the one who wanted to call the ambulance in the first place.",
        "Marty: Yeah, but now that we've ascertained the problem, we're okay.",
        "John: Well, we still got a problem. The problem is you.",
        "Marty: Me?",
        "John: Yes, you. You're too smart for your own good, and you're stubborn, you know? And how are you going to get to the hospital if you're dizzy. You can't drive.",
        "Marty: I'll call a cab.",
        "John: No. You're moving in with me.",
        "Marty: Just like that?",
        "John: Just like that. This is about our kid, our future, you and me. I want you with me. I'm driving from now on.",
        "Marty: Ha ha! Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, I got to go. My ride's here, but I'll see you tomorrow, right, after school?",
        "Cristian: Right, and by tomorrow, more kids will have signed up, so we'll have a full crew.",
        "Jessica: Great. Bye, Layla.",
        "Layla: Bye, Jessica.",
        "Cristian: See? She's better.",
        "Layla: I hope so.",

        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Jessica: Thanks so much for picking me up from school.",
        "Clint: Sure. Anytime. So how was your day?",

        "Oliver: Commissioner, they told me down at the station. Allison Perkins is here?",
        "Bo: Yeah. She's locked in the infirmary with Mitch Laurence, Schuyler Joplin, and the baby.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but the baby--",
        "Brody: Yeah, you're right. There is a way in.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm. Warden, that material that I asked you about, we're gonna need it. We're going on.",
        "Oliver: Commissioner, request permission to lead the unit.",
        "Brody: I think we've got that covered, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry. It's got to be me. I'm that baby's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: So you're telling me that your sister, a trained doctor, just took your word for it that you had given birth and took the baby, no questions asked?",
        "Allison: She wanted you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, you took the baby that you thought was yours to the prison.",
        "Roxy: I took him to Statesville to see Mitch. Wait. He's got to see this.",
        "Guard: Ma'am, you can't be here.",
        "Roxy: But he's got to see him, and then I'll go.",
        "Mitch: Is that my son? We can't be together, son, not yet, but I will come for you one day, and you and I will do great things, I promise. You will be a king among men.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: So you're saying I was the sick kid--the one your sister raised?",
        "Allison: Schuyler, you know who raised you--Leah Joplin, which makes Mitch your father. This is your son, Mitch, and his daughter is your grandchild.",
        "Leah's voice: How can I thank you, Allison?",

        "Roxy: Mitch never knew that you weren't his. Neither did I.",
        "Natalie: And you believe Allison Perkins?",
        "Roxy: Deep down inside, I knew it wasn't the same baby, but I let her convince me, but it wasn't the truth because my own baby died. All right. That's it. That's all I know.",
        "Rex: So, if this is true--",
        "Roxy: It is true. I don't want it to be true. I want you to be my son, but you're not.",
