        "Nora: When I was Matthew's age, I had an elaborate plan to run off to New York City and become a Rockette.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, I could see that.",
        "Nora: Eh -- too short and not a good enough dancer.",
        "Bo: Oh, come on, that's not true.",
        "Nora: Oh, God, Bo, do you remember that time -- oh, my God, look out, Bo! Bo, Bo!",
        "[Tires screech]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hmm, let's see. You've got a guard on her 24 hours a day, you took away her cell phone, her internet. Now you want to homeschool her? Yeah, I think that would be probably torture for any teenager.",
        "Todd: Well, I don't want it this way. It's just that, you know, when I think about what happened I -- I just can't get that image out of my head.",
        "Blair: Well, it's a good thing you got there when you did. Otherwise, it could've been a lot worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Langston: Can I borrow your Chem book?",
        "Starr: I've got it. I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: I -- I thought you said that nothing happened between you and Cole.",
        "Starr: I lied.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Are you serious? You're going to stay away from Starr? What did Lieutenant McBain say to you?",
        "Cole: Well, he told me if I want to do what's best for Starr, that I will end it between the two of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Do you think you could step on it?",
        "Clint: Why don't I just run us right off the road while I'm at it?",
        "Lindsay: Well, Clint, you're only going 15 miles an hour. We could walk there faster than this.",
        "Clint: If you want to walk, I'll stop the car.",
        "Lindsay: I don't want to walk, especially not in this storm.",
        "Clint: The higher up we go, the worse it's going to get, which is why I am driving slowly.",
        "Lindsay: Which is why we are never going to get there.",
        "Clint: For God's sakes, would you just relax? Stop worrying.",
        "Lindsay: You practically shove Bo and Nora in a car together and you want me not to worry?",
        "Clint: Are Bo and Nora going to fall in love all over again simply because they're in the same car?",
        "Lindsay: Could you not raise your voice at me?",
        "Clint: Well, I don't understand your anxiety about all this. Nora and Bo alone for a couple of hours -- so what? What's going to happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Bo: Are you okay?",
        "Nora: Um -- yeah, I think so. I think so. What about you? Are you okay?",
        "Bo: Ah. I'm bruised.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Bo: No, I'm kidding. I'm all right, I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Nora: Oh. That was a lucky deer -- I didn't know you had such fast reflexes.",
        "Bo: Yeah, not so lucky for us, though. I'll get outside and check the damage. There's a tree growing right outside my window.",
        "Nora: Oh. I -- I -- I could check mine. Ah. It's --",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Nora: Oh, boy. We're stuck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I still can't get through to my mom or my dad.",
        "Nigel: I'm afraid the landlines are down, as well.",
        "Matthew: I hope they're all right -- driving in this storm?",
        "Nigel: I'm sure they are, Matthew. And hopefully, ms. Natalie and Mr. Jared are faring well.",
        "Matthew: They'll be all right. They can take care of themselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Oh. What is wrong with you? Why would you do that?",
        "Jared: I -- I did it because I have something to tell you and there is nothing that's going to stop me this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, you and Cole -- you actually -- that night that your dad walked in? But, you said that -- you swore that nothing happened between the two of you.",
        "Starr: What was I supposed to say? Langston, my dad was a psycho that night. He would've killed Cole if my mom didn't come in on time and he definitely would've killed him if he knew the truth -- about what really happened.",
        "Langston: But Cole never said anything, either.",
        "Starr: Well, because he's not like that. That's one thing that I love about him is that he wouldn't talk about something that important or something that's just between the two of us.",
        "Langston: Okay, I -- I get why you didn't tell your parents, but why didn't you tell me?",
        "Starr: I don't know, okay? I'm just -- I'm really freaked out right now over it.",
        "Langston: So, do you think you're really pregnant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: My God -- how could it have been worse? Seeing what he was doing to my daughter, I just -- I cannot describe what that did to me.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Blair: Well, what I mean is, is if you had gotten there maybe a little later, they may have been making love. I mean, that's what they were planning on doing, that's what they intended.",
        "Todd: All right, so what's your solution? How can I make her realize that I'm doing this to -- to show how much I love her? How am I going to get through to her?",
        "Blair: You can get through to her, Todd -- if anybody can, you can. You know you and Starr have a very, very special connection -- you always have.",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Blair: And, yeah, I admit it's -- it's going through a rough time, but you can get that back. You can fix this relationship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: If you and Viki were driving up to the lodge together, just the two of you, Nora would run out of the courtroom in the middle of a murder trial to yank you out of that car.",
        "Clint: No, no --",
        "Lindsay: Yes, she would.",
        "Clint: No -- nice try, but Nora is not you. Her mind does not work like yours and neither does mine.",
        "Lindsay: And if you still had lingering feelings for Viki?",
        "Clint: I don't have lingering feelings for Viki.",
        "Lindsay: And you two were married how many times, and you broke up and got back together how many times, and you have how many children together?",
        "Clint: Lindsay, try and understand this, all right? Viki and I are mature, sane people. We could actually be in the same automobile for two hours without feeling compelled to tear each other's clothes off.",
        "Lindsay: But you would feel compelled to talk, would you not?",
        "Clint: I expect that we would, yeah, about things that actually mean something as opposed to this.",
        "Lindsay: Ah, so you would have a meaningful conversation. And then, of course, that would segue right into wonderful old memories, and before you know it --",
        "Clint: \"Before you know it\" what?",
        "Lindsay: Before you know it, you are walking down memory lane and we both know where that leads.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh. We slid pretty far down that hill. I don't even -- I can't even see the road.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, it means if anybody's up there on the road, then they can't see us down here. But we got the old GPS, so it's just a matter of time before somebody finds us.",
        "Nora: Yeah. In the meantime, we'll just try not to freeze to death.",
        "Bo: Ah. Well, you need me to warm you up?",
        "Nora: Oh -- no, it's okay. Thanks. I'm going to try the back door. That's what I'm going to try, you know, since these front ones are blocked by all these lovely trees.",
        "Bo: Open the back ones.",
        "Nora: Well --",
        "Bo: You know, those windows -- they only go halfway down.",
        "Nora: Are you implying I'm not going to fit?",
        "Bo: No, no. I'm just -- what I meant was give it a shot. Good luck.",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why do you keep doing this to me, Jared? Don't you get it? It -- it disgusts me, it makes me feel ashamed of myself.",
        "Jared: That is why you need to hear me out, okay?",
        "Natalie: No, I've heard enough. I got to -- I had to -- I got to get out of here.",
        "Jared: Okay, you're not going anywhere, not in the middle of this storm.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, you know what? I think I'd rather freeze than be stuck here alone with you.",
        "Jared: Not until you listen to me.",
        "Natalie: Let go of me. What, you want to tell me that you have more feelings for me?",
        "Jared: Will you just let me talk, please?",
        "Natalie: No, I've heard enough! For God's sake, Jared, you're my uncle!",
        "Jared: No, I'm not!",
        "Natalie: What did you just say?",
        "Jared: I'm not your uncle. That's what I'm trying to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: You're really going to end it with Starr -- for good?",
        "Cole: Well, of course I don't want to. But John made me realize how hard it'd be on Starr if her dad realized we were still seeing each other.",
        "Markko: He already beat you up. What, are you afraid he's going to put you in jail for what he says you did to Starr?",
        "Cole: No, not for that.",
        "Markko: Then what?",
        "Cole: I don't care if Starr's dad comes in right now and beats the crap out of me. I can't live like this anymore.",
        "Blair: He could do worse than that, Cole.",
        "Cole: Like what? What, kill me?",
        "Starr: No, Cole. What my mom is trying to say is that he could throw you in jail for a really long time.",
        "Cole: For what? Raping you? He can't because I didn't do it.",
        "Starr: Cole, no -- for shooting Miles Laurence.",
        "Cole: All right, listen, it'd be bad for a lot of reasons, all right? Now, I -- I don't want to give her up, but there's no other way. And as soon as she accepts that we can't be together, then she can finally start living her life again -- without me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, you and Cole, you -- you actually --",
        "Starr: Langston, could you please stop acting so shocked?",
        "Langston: Well, I -- I'm sorry but I just -- I can't believe you actually had sex.",
        "Starr: We made love -- it's different.",
        "Langston: Well, what was it like?",
        "Starr: It was -- it was between me and Cole and I don't want to talk about it right now.",
        "Langston: Wait -- was that the only time that you and Cole were ever together like that? I'm just saying --",
        "Starr: You're just saying what?",
        "Langston: Starr, the chances of getting pregnant after just one time- it's extremely unlikely.",
        "Starr: But it's not impossible.",
        "Langston: Well, did you use protection?",
        "Starr: Okay, look. I know that I should have, okay, and not just because I could get pregnant but also because of diseases and stuff like that, but -- I know all of that, Langston. I just -- I thought that it was going to be the last time that I was ever going to see him.",
        "Langston: Well, how do you feel?",
        "Starr: Not so good -- especially in the mornings. I thought maybe it was because of stress. Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.",
        "Langston: Starr, how could you be going through this and not tell anyone?",
        "Starr: Because no one can know about it, Langston. No one can know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So you think I should just cave -- is that it? That's your solution?",
        "Blair: No, Todd. Just bend a little. You can talk to Starr -- I mean, really talk to her and really listen.",
        "Todd: I do really talk to her, I do really listen. She just shuts me out.",
        "Blair: No, you really talk at her.",
        "Todd: Well, the last time we talked, I -- I tried to explain to her why homeschooling was good for her.",
        "Blair: Good for her?",
        "Todd: Yes. Yes -- of course. It's for her own good.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, it -- she's isolated, completely alone, away from her friends, how could that be good for her? Why can't you see that?",
        "Todd: See, now, the way you describe it, it makes seem like I'm being harsh.",
        "Blair: Yeah, you're being harsh and you're being cruel. It's worse than that. I mean, it -- you do this, Todd -- you always go over the top when somebody defies you and you don't like what's going on, you just bully your way through this. Well, you can't do this now. You've got to pull back. You've got to do it before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Are we almost there?",
        "Clint: Another 45 minutes at least. And if it gets any icier, they're going to close this road.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, great. That would be a great excuse for Bo and Nora to spend the night in some seedy motel together.",
        "Clint: Oh, here we go.",
        "Lindsay: It would be the old \"there was only one room and one bed available\" routine.",
        "Clint: Put a sock in it, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: I know human nature as do you.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah. Well, then your assumption should apply to us. Now, if we were to get stuck, we'd check into a motel and we'd make mad, passionate love all night long.",
        "Lindsay: No.",
        "Clint: Why not?",
        "Lindsay: Because we --",
        "Clint: No -- whoa.",
        "Lindsay: Don't have feelings for each other still.",
        "Clint: And I'm telling you for the last time, neither do Bo and Nora.",
        "Lindsay: They have a child together. Now, that's the tie that binds -- you ought to know that.",
        "[Clint chuckles]",
        "Clint: I'm begging you, turn on the radio, get some loud music. That'll hit the spot.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, look. Look -- you see? There's a light -- you see it? Up ahead?",
        "Clint: Ruby's Diner, yeah -- Ruby's Diner.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, Clint, can we stop? Can we stop there, please? If the road is closed up to the mountains, Bo and Nora might be in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Nora: Both back doors are stuck. They're trapped by those stupid trees.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, it could've been a whole lot worse. We could've had one of those stupid trees in here with us.",
        "Nora: It could be a whole lot better.",
        "Bo: Uh-huh.",
        "Nora: We could be up at the lodge, sitting in front of a cozy, warm fire, eating dinner --",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Nora: One of those fabulous meals prepared by Nigel. Hmm. I'm hungry.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "[Nora gasps]",
        "Nora: Oh, my God!",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: I completely forgot!",
        "Bo: Forgot what?",
        "Nora: Nigel -- he packed us some snacks to take on the road. And --",
        "[Nora gasps]",
        "Nora: And, look -- we're not even going to freeze to death because he brought blankets.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, this is great.",
        "Nora: Ah.",
        "Bo: Where's the food?",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Eureka.",
        "Bo: No, that's bread.",
        "Nora: It's a start.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: And -- mmm -- brie.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Nora: Mmm, mmm, yum. Oh -- vino.",
        "Bo: Well, look, I can't drink. I'm driving.",
        "Nora: I hate to rain on your parade, but if we get out of here, you're not driving. Here we go.",
        "Bo: Well, then, let's pop open the wine.",
        "Nora: Yeah. This is the only libation we've got -- we might as well drink and enjoy ourselves.",
        "Bo: Yep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Are you so sick and -- and turned on by this perverted idea that you would actually lie to me?",
        "Jared: No, I am not lying to you -- not anymore.",
        "Natalie: I can't even look at you. I can't -- I can't believe that I let Nigel take Matthew and leave us here alone.",
        "Jared: Yeah -- Natalie, please! Will you just listen to me? The lie is that I was your uncle. I'm not. I never -- was. I never -- I never could be.",
        "Natalie: Get your hand off me.",
        "Jared: Natalie, I'm just plain old Jared Banks. I'm a fraud. I'm pretending to be someone I'm not. And I can't pretend anymore.",
        "Jared: This is getting old. I -- I -- I mean, first you smack me because I kiss you. That I understand, but now you smack me for telling you the truth? Don't you get it, Natalie? We can be together now without -- without guilt and there's no weirdness.",
        "Natalie: What planet are you living on, Jared? I mean, there were DNA tests run -- remember? I mean, Nigel read the letter that my grandfather had.",
        "Jared: I know, I know, I know, I know -- identifying me as Asa's son. It's not true. Okay? And ask Nigel -- he'll back me up on this.",
        "Natalie: Boy, that's rich -- bring Nigel into this? Come on -- that man would never lie to our family. Not in a million years would he hurt us.",
        "Jared: Not intentionally, but he didn't have any other choice.",
        "Natalie: Oh, what, did you threaten him?",
        "Jared: I didn't have to. He had other reasons.",
        "Natalie: Like what? Like Grandpa's real long-lost son is an ax murderer?",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: No, but according to Nigel, almost that bad.",
        "Natalie: Well, who could be -- who could be bad enough that Nigel would go along with this scam?",
        "Jared: David Vickers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I don't see Bo and Nora.",
        "Clint: Matthew.",
        "Matthew: Uncle Clint. Where's my mom and dad?",
        "Lindsay: You haven't heard from them?",
        "Matthew: No, the phones are down, so even if they tried to call me, they couldn't.",
        "Clint: Nigel, what are you two doing here and not at the lodge?",
        "Nigel: Mr. Matthew accompanied me for supplies. We just made it down the mountain when, oh --",
        "Matthew: When the ice started pounding the car. And then it started snowing. I mean, isn't this weird this time of year?",
        "Clint: Yeah, it is weird, Matthew, but it happens.",
        "Nigel: It seems the authorities have closed the roads, so I thought it best to wait here until the storm lets up.",
        "Matthew: But I don't get it -- why aren't they with you guys?",
        "Lindsay: Well, your Uncle Clint had the brilliant idea of them driving up here, just the two of them together.",
        "Nigel: I suppose they could've gotten through if they left Llanview early enough.",
        "Lindsay: Maybe we should call the lodge and check on them.",
        "Clint: Well, we've already tried that, and if you'd pay attention, Matthew just told us the phones are down.",
        "Nigel: Yes, I'm afraid all communications are cut off on the mountain. As far as I know, only Miss Natalie and Mr. Jared are up there.",
        "Lindsay: Nigel, where did they close the road?",
        "Nigel: Just a few miles up.",
        "Lindsay: Is there anywhere to stop between here and there?",
        "Nigel: Nothing but a barren stretch.",
        "Matthew: No. No, no, no. That old motel -- remember?",
        "Clint: Matthew? Your mom and dad are fine, wherever they are.",
        "Lindsay: Yes, I'm sure they're very, very fine.",
        "Matthew: Why do you say it like that? You -- you think they're not?",
        "Clint: No, no, that's not what Lindsay meant, not at all.",
        "Matthew: You know, I'm going to go try to call them -- maybe another part of the diner --",
        "Clint: Oh, that's a good idea. What is the matter with you? Why are you trying to scare the kid?",
        "Lindsay: Did you hear what he said? There's a motel between here and there.",
        "Clint: Lindsay, now let's just stop this nonsense.",
        "Lindsay: Your imagination isn't running wild?",
        "Clint: No, it's not. My only concern is that they're driving safely in this storm. Other than that, I have complete faith in Nora -- and in Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You know what I'd love right now?",
        "Bo: Hmm?",
        "Nora: A Rodi's cheeseburger -- with bacon -- oh, fried onion rings, lots of ketchup. Hmm.",
        "Bo: Do you want some more brie?",
        "Nora: Yeah, that'll do in a pinch.",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Bo: You know what? I don't know how you do it, you eat all those cheeseburgers, French fries, and everything and you still stay in good shape.",
        "Nora: Well, it gets harder as I get older, but I think it's good genes.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Good thing Matthew got those good genes. I think he got his best genes from you.",
        "Nora: Oh, back at you.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Bo: Oh -- huh.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Nora: What's so funny?",
        "Bo: Hmm. I was just thinking about the time we got snowed in in the house. I think it was the blizzard of 1996, I think -- you remember that?",
        "Nora: Hmm, oh, hmm. We had, like, three feet of snow.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Bo: God, boy, you made some dinner that night, didn't you?",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Bo: You used everything in the kitchen.",
        "Nora: That was truly fine dining -- potato chips, leftover pizza --",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Nora: Cookies --",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: Apples?",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Nora: Hmm. Hmm.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but then we just popped open the old bottle of wine again --",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Sat there in front of the fire and listened to Benny Goodman.",
        "Nora: Mmm -- a little bit more. Benny Goodman -- God, it sounds like we're 100 years old.",
        "Bo: No.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Bo: No, we like swing music, that's all.",
        "Nora: We sure do. We sure do. Isn't it funny -- the only two in Llanview I think that do and we found each other. How did we find each other?",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Nora: Is this GPS even working?",
        "Bo: Ah, I don't know. Somebody's going to find us, and soon.",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Starr wants nothing to do with me right now, Blair. She won't talk to me. Even if she did, I -- I don't think she'd believe anything I said.",
        "Blair: Well, maybe she would if you sounded reasonable.",
        "Todd: No, but she just won't buy it. She'll say I don't trust her.",
        "Blair: Well, maybe that's the big question. Do you trust Starr?",
        "Todd: Not when it comes to Thornhart -- no, I don't. Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You plan on keeping this a secret? How?",
        "Starr: Look, I don't even know if there's a secret to keep, okay, and I won't, not until I take this.",
        "Langston: Okay, but what -- what if it comes up pink or positive test? I -- do you even have a plan?",
        "Starr: I will -- if it turns out. I'm going to think of something, okay?",
        "Langston: How did you even get the test anyway? Wasn't Shaun with you?",
        "Starr: I had Shaun take me to the drugstore and I snuck it in between two magazines while he was on the phone with my dad.",
        "Langston: Starr, if you're pregnant, you're going to have to make a decision.",
        "Starr: I know. And, um -- I really just want to be alone for this, okay? Please?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How long -- I should say how did you find out? I mean, about David?",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: Back at the ranch in Texas, for the reading of Asa's will.",
        "Natalie: At the ranch? You mean, when we --",
        "Jared: Yes. When we acknowledged our feelings for each other.",
        "Natalie: Oh. I see. So you realized that you had feelings for me. And you knew that if you went along with this scam, you wouldn't be able to be with me.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: So you chose money over me?",
        "Jared: No, no! No, it was not like that. It was never about the money, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Really? If it wasn't about the money, then what in God's name was it about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Well, no one thought we could do it. No one thought we had a chance of winning. Hmm.",
        "Bo: Well, we showed them.",
        "Nora: We sure did. Yeah.",
        "[Swing music plays]",
        "[Whistles]",
        "Nora: Wow. I remember it so vividly. And sure, the winning and there was -- that was sort of silly. Great TV set, though.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. Big.",
        "Nora: But when we won, I don't know -- I just -- it made me feel like --",
        "Bo: What? Made you feel like what?",
        "Nora: Like we could have it all. And we did. For a little while.",
        "Bo: Uh-huh.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Lindsay: Oh! Oh, thank God we found you! Are you all right?",
        "Nora: Well -- well, I'm fine. Are you fine?",
        "Clint: We'll get you out of there in a minute.",

        "Renee: Cole, I didn't know you were here.",
        "Cole: Oh, hi, Mrs. Buchanan.",
        "Renee: Markko, always nice to see you.",
        "Markko: You, too. Oh, may I get you anything?",
        "Renee: As a matter of fact, I came in to get some takeout for Cole and me. We're the only ones up at the mansion, now that everybody else is up at the lodge I thought that you might like food from here better than from The Palace.",
        "Cole: No, ma'am, I don't mind eating at the mansion.",
        "Renee: I just thought this would be more fun. As a matter of fact, why don't we just stay here? Markko, would you get us a couple of menus?",
        "Markko: Sure, be right back.",
        "Renee: Thanks. I am -- I'm so glad that you and I get to spend some time together, just the two of us.",
        "Cole: Me, too.",
        "Renee: How's it going? Is Todd Manning still giving you a hard time?",
        "Cole: Mr. Manning won. He broke up me and Starr, and nothing can change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, I -- I completely agree with you that Starr and Cole have moved too fast on this. But the way you wanted to put the brakes on here, it's not working. I think you're going to have to, you know, change your approach.",
        "Todd: To what?",
        "Blair: Well, I think maybe you should try having a civil conversation with her. Calmly. You take your cues from her and really listen to her. I mean, because whatever you guys are talking about now, it's certainly not working. And if you can't make this happen, then I'm going to have to. I mean, she's my daughter, and I should have a say in her education and I should have a say in all the other aspects of her life. And I've kind of let it go up to here, Todd. But you can't make these unilateral decisions about her education or anything else without talking to me first, okay?",
        "Todd: Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Todd: Should I go up and talk to her right now? Hmm. I'll go talk to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Nothing about a storm on the weather report. 30% chance of precipitation, partly cloudy -- what happened to that? Aren't we supposed to be heading into spring?",
        "Bo: You know, it's a good thing you got ahold of Jessica and Sarah and you told them not to come.",
        "Lindsay: It's really dangerous driving out there. It's a lucky thing Clint and I were able to cut those tree branches away and get you two out of that car. You're being uncharacteristically quiet, Nora.",
        "Nora: Hmm? Oh, uh -- just being in the country like this makes me mellow. Makes me feel close to nature.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah, I know what you mean. Soothes the soul to get out of the city and away from the hustle and bustle.",
        "Nora: Is that why you decided to tag along this weekend? To soothe your soul?",
        "Lindsay: I didn't decide anything, Nora. Bo is my court-appointed guardian, and I felt like I didn't have any choice. I -- I didn't think it was right for me to be alone for the weekend.",
        "Bo: Oh, man, Lindsay, I'm sorry.",
        "Lindsay: That's all right.",
        "Bo: No, no, it totally slipped my mind. You know, I've been preoccupied -- all this Buchanan business, you know?",
        "Lindsay: Yeah, well, we're together now and that's all that Matters.",
        "Clint: You know, now that the roads are clear, Nigel and Matthew are probably halfway up the mountain.",
        "Lindsay: It's a great idea for us to go up to the lodge, Clint. I predict that we're going to have a really good time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So let's hear it, Jared. Why did you toss me aside if it wasn't for the Buchanan money?",
        "Jared: Well, it's hard to explain.",
        "Natalie: Try.",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: Look, I've followed the life of your grandfather for a long time now, and --",
        "Natalie: I know. His book, your bible -- got it.",
        "Jared: Yes, and -- and I always wanted to meet Asa Buchanan. I wanted to be like him. And then being at the ranch with his family, and seeing what that was all about -- I just -- I wanted to be a part of it.",
        "Natalie: Well, you could have. I mean, maybe with me.",
        "Jared: You -- you are what I didn't plan on, Natalie! When I first came to Llanview, I didn't -- I didn't plan on falling for you.",
        "Natalie: Wait a second, I thought you came to Llanview to get back at Tess for putting you in prison.",
        "Jared: I did. Pretending to be Asa's son -- that wasn't the initial plan. It just sort of fell into my lap, and when it did, I -- I took advantage of it.",
        "Natalie: To put it mildly.",
        "Jared: Look, I - I have hated watching you hurt by this.",
        "Natalie: Not enough to stop doing it.",
        "Jared: No, I didn't think I had a chance to be with you. I didn't think I deserved you.",
        "Natalie: You don't.",
        "Jared: I can't get over you, Natalie. Okay? I've tried. And as much as I try, I can't get you out of my system. I've never felt this way about anyone in my life. I don't -- I didn't think I could feel this way. And the more time that went on, the harder it got, the more my emotions grew. And I tried to tell you. I did -- I -- I did at -- at the ball. I tried to tell you on Valentine's Day. And then -- and then that crazy lady with the gun came and --",
        "Natalie: And you saved Jessica's life.",
        "Jared: Yes! And that's when your family started treating me and accepting me like one of them. I never had that before. And it felt good. Okay? But being with you feels better. And I'd give all that up to be with you.",
        "Natalie: You really mean everything you said?",
        "Jared: More than anything I have ever said in the world. I want to be with you, Natalie. And I hope you want to be with me. Please tell me you don't hate me. Please tell me that you understand.",
        "Natalie: I do. I understand perfectly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: It just breaks my heart. You've had so many losses in the last few months. First your beloved mother, and now this terrible situation with Starr.",
        "Cole: I don't know what I'm going to do without her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, I'm almost done with work. What are you up to?",
        "Langston: You know -- you know, I can't really talk right now.",
        "Markko: Why not? Everything okay?",
        "Langston: Yeah, everything's -- everything's great.",
        "Markko: Why don't I believe that? Is it Starr?",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Langston: You know, I -- I don't really want to get into it right now.",
        "Markko: Okay. Well, Cole is here. Is there something I should tell him?",
        "Langston: No! Um -- no, because there's nothing to tell. Um -- things are just, you know, how they are around here. So, um, I'll call you later?",
        "Markko: Yeah. Okay.",

        "Langston: Oh.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Blair: Is everything all right?",
        "Langston: Yeah, yeah. You just startled me. I was just going to go upstairs to bed, --",
        "Blair: Um -- you can go up, but don't stop by Starr's room, because her dad just went up to have a talk with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Todd: Starr?",
        "Starr: Oh, my God -- the box.",
        "Starr: Dad, do I not get any privacy in here anymore?",
        "Todd: We both know why I took the knob off that door, Starr. And I did knock, didn't I? You didn't answer. Everything all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Langston -- um -- do you got a minute?",
        "Langston: Me?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I was just hoping that maybe we could have a talk, you know, while Starr's talking to her dad.",
        "Langston: Uh -- sure.",
        "Blair: Great. Great, great, great. I -- I wanted to know if -- have you talked to Starr today?",
        "Langston: Yeah, but we -- we always talk.",
        "Blair: Did she say anything about this homeschooling thing? Was she upset about it?",
        "Langston: Yeah, she really is. Um, is that it? I should really get back upstairs.",
        "Blair: Is everything all right? Something bothering you? Is it about Starr? Look, Langston, if it is, you need to tell me what's going on.",

        "Starr: Like what, you're going to give me my life back -- let me be with who I want to be with?",
        "Todd: Well, if by that you mean Cole, then you know the answer to that. But -- but I don't want you hating me anymore. You're my daughter. It kills me that we're not getting along. You'll understand that someday when you have your own kids. Of course, I know that feels like a million years away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: My God, you do understand.",
        "Natalie: I understand that you are the most disgusting human being that I have ever met in my entire life, and I have met some pretty disgusting people, but you are the worst of the worst!",
        "Jared: I just told you how I feel about you.",
        "Natalie: And that's supposed to make up for you ripping off my family?",
        "Jared: Whoa, I have never taken a dime from B.E. For every hour I've clocked, I've given two. I care about that company, okay, and I care about the Buchanans.",
        "Natalie: And I'm supposed to believe a word that comes out of your mouth? The -- the man who scammed me into believing that he was \"dear old Uncle Jared,\" and made me think that there was something between us before you started this whole stupid thing?",
        "Jared: There was something between us, Natalie, and there still is. Look, I get why you're angry, okay? Of course. But I know you still have feelings for me.",
