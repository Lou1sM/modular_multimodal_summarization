        "Kim: What the hell are you doing here, David? Kevin get sick of you bumming off him? He kick you out?",
        "David: It's not bumming when it's family. It's mooching.",
        "Kim: Whatever. Your genes carry no weight around here. Clint's not gonna give you the time of day, much less a dime.",
        "David: I'm not here for Clint. I'm here for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Hey.",
        "Langston: Are you alone?",
        "Ford: Not anymore.",
        "Langston: I didn't come here for that.",
        "Ford: All right. How about this?",
        "Langston: No, I'm serious. Cut it out. I told Markko that I was going over to Dorian's to pick up some sheet music, so I can't talk for long, but we need to talk.",
        "Ford: About what?",
        "Langston: Starr knows that I've been cheating on Markko with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Every time Ford touched me, every time he told me he cared about me, it was all lies to get me to have sex with him.",
        "Cole: Look, the guy is a low life. I mean, no one should be able to get away with using people like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Commissioner, request permission to leave the unit.",
        "Brody: I think we've got that covered, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry. It's got to be me. I'm that baby's father. So what's the plan? How are we gonna get my daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: Schuyler, you know who raised you -- Leah Joplin, which means Mitch is your father. This is your son, Mitch, and his daughter is your grandchild. Now that you know the truth, you can finally be one big, happy family. Minus Roxy, of course.",
        "[Baby fusses]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So if you're not my mother, Mitch Laurence isn't my father. Who am I?",
        "Roxy: I don't know. I wish I could tell you, but I don't know who your parents are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: This can't be. I can't -- I can't be Mitch \u0096",
        "Allison: You are. Roxy --",
        "Schuyler: Is not my mother, and this freak, no way!",
        "Allison: Yes way. Now. Be a good boy and don't murder your daddy. Give Mitch the antidote.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying. Now get out or I'll call security and they'll throw you out.",
        "David: This is my ancestral home. You can't do that.",
        "Kim: Oh, yes, I can. Or haven't you heard. I'm Mrs. Clint Buchanan now.",
        "David: Hmm. Get your kicks in while you can. You ain't gonna be queen bee for long.",
        "Kim: Oh, get over yourself, Vickers. I'm the one who's in charge now, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.",
        "David: Actually, there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So you gonna tell me what happened at school today?",
        "Jessica: Like what?",
        "Clint: Like what happened to make it so good.",
        "Jessica: Well --",
        "Cristian: You did not just do that. You know you're asking for it.",
        "Jessica: What are you gonna do? Oh! Ha ha! Don't! Stop! Stop!",
        "Jessica: I learned how to paint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Finally. You know, I thought this day would never end. All I wanted to do was come home and take a load off. And be with you, of course. I'm telling you, high school kids are no joke.",
        "Layla: All of them or one in particular?",
        "Cristian: Layla, I made it clear to Jessica that we didn't have a future, and I think she got it.",
        "Layla: I hope so because I don't want to have to give a high school senior a beat down, but I will if I have to. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I am having the best time building sets for the musical. Who knew I'd be a shop geek, huh?",
        "Clint: Yeah. Well, I'm not surprised.",
        "Jessica: Oh?",
        "Clint: Mm-hmm. You've always had an artistic eye.",
        "Jessica: Clearly you've had way too much ice cream.",
        "Clint: I'm serious. In fact, I still have that clay giraffe that you made in fifth grade.",
        "Jessica: That was a horse.",
        "Clint: Oh.",
        "Jessica: Well, luckily I have a better art teacher this time around.",
        "Clint: Would that be Cristian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Maybe I should do something to get back at Ford.",
        "Cole: No, that's a bad idea. You just need to stay away from Ford.",
        "Hannah: Well, he tells everyone I'm crazy and trashes my reputation. Why shouldn't I trash his right back?",
        "Starr: Trash what? Am I interrupting?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: How did Starr find out we were sleeping together?",
        "Langston: Do you really need to ask me that?",
        "Ford: You told her?",
        "Langston: Well, I kind of didn't have a choice once she found the condom wrapper on the floor.",
        "Ford: And you couldn't have lied and said it was Markko's?",
        "Langston: She's not an idiot. You had just left. I was all flustered, and my clothes were all messed up.",
        "Ford: Okay, all right, okay.",
        "Langston: And she totally went off on me, said that I was making a huge mistake by sleeping --",
        "Ford: Okay, she'll keep quiet, right?",
        "Langston: I don't know! But I begged her not to say anything at least until I can figure things out.",
        "Ford: Okay. All right. So we're good?",
        "Langston: No, we're not good. Everything's out of control. I mean, Starr knows. Markko almost found out because that Hannah chick's been going around telling everyone. Yeah, Hannah, the girl you were supposedly sleeping with at the same time you were sleeping with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Now, I heard right. Sierra Rose is your daughter?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, and I know that you have a lot of questions. I actually just found out today myself, but I have a DNA test to prove it.",
        "Bo: No, not necessary Fish. Really. It's okay. Congratulations.",
        "Oliver: Thanks, boss.",
        "Bo: All right, now I need you to step back and stay out of our way.",
        "Oliver: What? No. That's my kid in there.",
        "Bo: No. Look, you can't be involved. I need my guys thinking clearly, and there's no father who can do that when his kid's life is at stake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: He's dying. Give him the antidote.",
        "Schuyler: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I don't know who your parents are. I just know that they abandoned you at the hospital.",
        "Rex: But who? Who left me?",
        "Roxy: I don't know. Allison convinced me that the baby that she gave me was the baby that I gave birth to.",
        "Natalie: The one that was sick.",
        "Roxy: I was so desperate to believe that I could never hurt my little baby boy, that Allison was telling the truth, that her sister managed to save him. And I convinced myself. But I knew the baby was different 'cause the baby I gave birth to had a little mole on his face and the baby that Allison gave me, which was you, there was no mole on his face, so I knew you weren't mine. I knew you weren't my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: No? Give him the antidote. You can't let Mitch die.",
        "Schuyler: Why not? It means nothing to me.",
        "Allison: Is Sierra Rose nothing to you, too? Let's find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I really hope the two of you don't come to blows. I would hate to see you have to go in front of the principal.",
        "Layla: You know, this isn't exactly a joke to me.",
        "Cristian: Huh. I'm sorry. I just find it surreal that my girlfriend from a million years ago thinks she's a teenager and is still in love with me and my grown-up girlfriend is jealous.",
        "Layla: Nice. Rub it in.",
        "Cristian: I wasn't trying to rub it in.",
        "Layla: Look, I'm not exactly proud of the fact that I'm jealous of your relationship with your mentally impaired ex.",
        "Cristian: Layla, there is no reason for you to feel threatened, okay? You are my girlfriend, end of story. Now, what do you say we let go of today and start working on getting tonight off the ground?",
        "Layla: Uh, baby, as soon as you wash off this paint.",
        "Cristian: But it would go a lot faster if you helped me.",
        "Layla: Let me just stick these clothes in the wash.",
        "Cristian: Then you'll dry me?",
        "Layla: Yes.",
        "Cristian: All right. Deal.",
        "Layla: Ha. Thank you.",
        "Layla: Whew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay, yeah, Cristian and I are working together to build sets. He needed my help. I couldn't let him do it all by himself.",
        "Clint: It's just the two of you?",
        "Jessica: What's wrong with that?",
        "Clint: Well, I find it kind of odd, that's all.",
        "Jessica: Why?",
        "Clint: Well, I thought this was gonna be a great big musical. They only have two people working on the sets?",
        "Jessica: No one else was interested. What's the big deal?",
        "Clint: I didn't say it was a big deal.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but you're thinking that it's a big deal. You know, why is it so weird that I'm spending time with Cris, but it's not weird for you to marry a girl that's young enough to be my sister?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You didn't actually think that I'd stand by while you frittered away my inheritance, did you?",
        "Kim: I don't think about you period. Why would I? Girl scouts are more intimidating.",
        "David: They have their moments. You think I wanted to buy 45 boxes of cookies?",
        "Kim: Do your worst. I'm ready for you.",
        "David: I doubt it.",
        "Kim: Hands off!",
        "David: Kim, you are what we in the trade call a jvgd -- junior varsity gold digger. It's a technical term, not a compliment. You're probably riding high on your latest score, thinking nothing can bring you down.",
        "Kim: That's 'cause nothing can.",
        "David: You're thinking, where should I buy my next diamond-encrusted toe ring when you should be thinking how will a vgd -- varsity gold digger -- like David Vickers Buchanan take that toe ring away from me.",
        "Kim: I'd love to see you try.",
        "David: Watch and learn, jv. Watch and learn.",
        "Kim: What could you possibly do to me? Ha!",
        "David: It's not so much about what I'm going to do to you as it is what you are going to do to Clint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: No, you weren't interrupting anything. Cole was just letting me vent.",
        "Starr: Because I could always comes back if --",
        "Hannah: No, no. Stay. It's out of my system now, and actually I should be getting back to my dorm now anyway.",
        "Cole: You sure?",
        "Hannah: Yeah. I've leaned on you enough. Sorry for monopolizing your boyfriend. I'll see you guys later.",
        "Cole: Hannah -- she's had a rough time. She just -- she just needs a friend.",
        "Starr: I suppose everybody does.",
        "Cole: Is, um, is something wrong?",
        "Langston: I'm begging you, just keep this between the two of us. You said you were my best friend.",
        "Starr: I won't tell Cole, but only for now.",
        "Starr: Do you ever think that there's a good reason to keep a secret from somebody you love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Don't listen to Hannah. She's got zero credibility.",
        "Langston: Says who?",
        "Ford: Mmm. Listen, for months she's been telling anybody who will listen that I'm her boyfriend.",
        "Langston: And you're not?",
        "Ford: No!",
        "Langston: So you didn't sleep with her? You did? Oh!",
        "Ford: Listen, I don't get close to people very easily, okay? But I'm not a monk either, so yeah, Hannah and I used to get together, but that was before I got with you. Listen, it was just sex.",
        "Langston: Really? Did you give her a key to your office, too?",
        "Ford: Why are you trying to start a fight with me?",
        "Langston: I'm not trying to start a f -- I just -- I want you to tell me the truth.",
        "Ford: Okay, I -- I didn't take her to the prom. She didn't meet my parents. We just let off a little steam together, that's all.",
        "Langston: Well, Hannah seems to think it was more.",
        "Ford: Which is why I put a stop to it. She was getting the wrong idea. Look, I could never be with a girl like that.",
        "Langston: What, smart, pretty?",
        "Ford: Not you.",
        "Langston: So it's over?",
        "Ford: It was over the second I thought I had a chance with you. I would have told you about her, but I didn't think you'd want to know. Who cares who I used to sleep with, right? I mean, you sleep with Markko.",
        "Langston: Well, doesn't that bother you?",
        "Ford: Yeah, well, I knew that going in.",
        "Langston: Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be that way.",
        "Ford: What are you saying? Are you gonna break up with Markko?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Look --",
        "Brody: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bo: Hey, warden, those supplies, did you get those for us?",
        "Warden: Everything you need.",
        "Oliver: What are you gonna do?",
        "Bo: We're ready to go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Allison, put the gun down.",
        "Allison: Give Mitch the antidote!",
        "Schuyler: And what if I don't?",
        "Allison: It's bye-bye Sierra Rose.",
        "Schuyler: You're really gonna hurt an innocent child?",
        "Allison: There will be other babies. There's only one Mitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, look, Mitch has gotten Allison to lie before, so you know what? Maybe Allison's lying about this. You know, I think what we need to do is we need to go get a DNA test A.S.A.P.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you're right. This could just be some huge fake out to get us to drop our guards, to make us think we're safe from Mitch.",
        "Roxy: Listen, I think we should do the test, but I got to say, in my heart of hearts, I think that Allison is telling the truth. I think I just pushed it out of my brain so much, but I knew it wasn't the same baby 'cause my baby died. My baby died in the hospital, and I never had a chance to say good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: How can you want to save this psychopath? You already betrayed him. You let him think Rex was his son. Do you have any idea what he'll do to you if he lives?",
        "Allison: I deserve what I get. The messenger has to live on. Nothing else matters, not you, not that baby.",
        "Schuyler: No! Okay, okay, stop, stop! Stop it! I will -- I will give him the antidote.",
        "Allison: That's a good answer.",
        "Schuyler: But listen, I'm gonna need something from you in return.",
        "Allison: What?",
        "Schuyler: I want the baby and I want the gun, and I want them first.",
        "Allison: Maybe I'll shoot you and take what I need.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah? Not if there's none left.",
        "[Allison gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What happened to joining me?",
        "Layla: I got distracted.",
        "Cristian: What do you have there?",
        "Layla: A love letter you wrote to Jessica.",
        "Cristian: I wrote that in high school.",
        "Layla: You said you told Jessica you moved on.",
        "Cristian: I have.",
        "Layla: Then why are you carrying this around with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So you heard about Kimberly?",
        "Jessica: Oh, that's all the staff at Mom's house are talking about, and thanks for telling me, by the way.",
        "Clint: Well, you had a lot on your plate.",
        "Jessica: You didn't think I could handle it?",
        "Clint: No, no, it's not that. Jess, I'm sorry. It was wrong to keep it from you.",
        "Jessica: Then why did you?",
        "Clint: Because I didn't think that you would approve. I mean, Natalie sure as hell didn't.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm not Natalie. I don't even know that girl.",
        "Clint: Honey, she's your sister.",
        "Jessica: So everybody keeps on telling me, but we're not talking about her, okay? We're talking about Kim, your wife.",
        "Clint: Yes. And how do you feel about my wife?",
        "Jessica: Kim wouldn't be my first choice for you. You know I always wanted you and Mom to get back together.",
        "Clint: Oh, that's a bit more than a long shot now.",
        "Jessica: Well, that I do remember, but I'd settle for you two being happy.",
        "Clint: Do you mean that, honey?",
        "Jessica: Of course I do. I love you, Daddy. And if Kim makes you happy --",
        "Clint: She does. In fact, your old man is positively gleeful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: If you think I'm gonna hurt a single hair on Clint's head and mess up what I've got going here, you got another thing coming. I'm not just some midlife crisis. The two of us are like this. David: I think you're using one too many fingers.",
        "Kim: Clint married me for me after everybody and their dog told him he was making a mistake.",
        "David: He was blinded by sex.",
        "Kim: Is that what you think? Well, guess what. We didn't have sex until after the wedding. Yeah, that's right. Clint didn't even pressure me. He was totally cool with waiting.",
        "David: Nice move, jv. And of course waiting was fine by you.",
        "Kim: You might not believe me, but I like Clint. He's exciting and sexy and smart \u0096",
        "David: Wait. Exciting, sexy, and smart? You're describing me. The word to describe Clint is rich.",
        "Kim: And nobody pushes him around, just like me. Your uncle is exactly the guy I've been looking for, and FYI, the toe ring's not a toe ring; it's a ring ring for Sierra Rose, the little girl we're going to be raising together.",
        "David: Sierra Rose? Was she born in a desert?",
        "Kim: That's it! Get out!",
        "David: Ow! Let go! Listen to me, you're divorcing Clint, and you're gonna do it tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What, you think I'm keeping a secret from you?",
        "Starr: No. I was just asking.",
        "Cole: This is about the thing with the pizza girl from the other night, isn't it, the one who says she saw me at the dorms.",
        "Starr: What? What are you talking about?",
        "Cole: I can't do this anymore, Starr. I'm sorry. Look. I lied to you, okay? I was at the dorms. I was in Hannah's room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Are you gonna break up with Markko?",
        "Langston: Do you think I should?",
        "Ford: It's your decision.",
        "Langston: Well, Starr told me I should break up with you.",
        "Ford: Oh, forget about Starr. Look. She's a nice girl, but she's made some pretty questionable life choices.",
        "Langston: What does that mean?",
        "Ford: Well, just that she doesn't have all the answers. She doesn't know the first thing about us.",
        "Langston: She's my best friend.",
        "Ford: I know. I know, but this is about you and me, okay? This is nobody's business but ours.",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Hannah: Ford, open up. Ford, I know you're in there. Open the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I didn't want to tell you what that skeev Allison said, and I didn't want to tell you, either, because, Rex, then you'd know that I wasn't your mother. Just couldn't do it. All these years, I've kept from you who you really are, and I just didn't want to do it anymore. It's kind of crazy, huh? All these years, I kept the truth about who Mitch was when it wasn't even the truth at all.",
        "[Roxy sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Say good-bye.",

        "Oliver: I need to get in there.",
        "Bo: Stand by, S.W.A.T. Go on my command. Looks like we're going with plan \"b,\" right through that door.",
        "Allison: Here. Take her.",
        "Schuyler: Hi, baby.",
        "Allison: Give me the syringe.",
        "Schuyler: How are you, little girl?",
        "Allison: The syringe, Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: All right. All right.",
        "Mitch: I look forward to our reunion, son.",
        "Schuyler: Die.",
        "Allison: No!",
        "Allison: Just a little further. No. No. Mitch needs me. You can't. He's dying. He can't die.",
        "Bo: Medic!",
        "Schuyler: It's okay. It's okay, Sierra. I know. Daddy has got you. I'm never gonna let anything happen to you again, okay?",

        "Cole: No. No, no. No way, Starr. I would never do that to you, okay?",
        "Starr: Then why would you lie to me?",
        "Cole: I promised Hannah I wouldn't tell anyone.",
        "Starr: About what?",
        "Cole: Look. The reason why I was in her room, the reason why I lied to you was because Hannah O.D.'d.",

        "Hannah: Oh, yeah? Which one? Langston?",
        "Ford: I work here, Hannah. What is your problem?",
        "Hannah: Stop telling lies about me.",
        "Ford: Everything I said about you is true.",
        "Hannah: No, it's not, and you know it. You're messing up my life. You're screwing with my reputation.",
        "Ford: Like you're screwing with mine?",
        "Hannah: You called me a stalker.",
        "Ford: That's what you are, Hannah. This is textbook stalker behavior.",
        "Hannah: I'll go to the dean if I have to.",
        "Ford: Thomas will side with me, especially after he hears that you're spreading lies about an innocent high-school student. Okay. Now look. I'm sorry that this got so out of hand. You're a nice girl. You deserve a nice guy. It's just not me.",

        "David: All right. Time to pack your bags.",
        "Kim: Security!",
        "David: You know, you really need to focus, J.V. You've got until Clint comes home to dream up some reason about why you're divorcing him.",
        "Kim: Get it through your thick skull. I have worked way too hard to win this ring on my finger. I'm not just gonna rush out of here with my tail between my legs because Clint's bastard nephew tells me to.",

        "Clint: You know, this is another chance for me. It means a lot to have your support, which is kind of hard to come by these days.",

        "Clint: Well, honey, everybody wants to see you get well.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm just doing what I have to do, and, you know, I kind of feel like it's a do-over for me, too, even though I don't remember doing it the first time, but, you know, I feel like maybe this time around, I can avoid making some of the mistakes I made the first time.",

        "Layla: What for?",
        "Cristian: It was when she was making a play for me. I don't know. Maybe she wanted to jog my memory, take me back to that time.",
        "Layla: Well, did she?",
        "Cristian: No. I put it in my bag, and I forgot about it. Are we cool?",
        "Layla: Yeah. We're cool. You know what? Thank you for being straight up with me about what happened. I didn't mean to make a federal case out of it.",

        "Rex: Yeah.",

        "Natalie: Don't say that.",
        "Roxy: Rex, you're much better off not having me for a mother, and you, too, because you're fair and you're kind and you're generous, just like Viki.",
        "Natalie: Rox, you're the one who raised me.",
        "Roxy: Baby, I wish I could tell you who your mother is. She must be pretty terrific to have a great kid like you because I was such a rotten mother. I never acted like I loved either one of you kids.",

        "Roxy: I didn't mean to put you on the spot or nothing.",
        "Rex: It's okay. I have something to say.",
        "Rex: I would be lying if I said that I wasn't confused, upset, and a little pissed off right now. I've spent the last few years wondering who my father was, and now it turns out I don't know who my mother is, either, so does it matter to me that you're not my biological mother? Yeah. Yeah. It matters a lot, but it's like Natty said. It doesn't change how I feel about you now. You're just as much my mother as Natalie is my sister.",

        "Jessica: You don't think he's a little intense?",
        "Clint: Well, that intensity is what drove him to protect you on more than one occasion, and, you know, if that's what we're calling it, I, for one, am very, very grateful. I'll stop now because I know I'm overselling it, but nevertheless, I would like to know how things work out.",
        "Jessica: Well, I will fill you in, but I don't want you to get your hopes up because I'm not sure Brody is the right guy for me.",

        "Kim: Oh, you're bluffing. You can't prove a thing.",
        "David: I'm afraid there's more.",
        "Kim: So I made up my resume -- everybody does it -- and maybe I never had that interview with Jared, but who cares? Clint knows about everything I did, and -- guess what -- he doesn't give a rat's ass.",

        "Cole: No, no. It's not like that. She wasn't doing anything hard. She just took a few too many sleeping pills.",

        "Cole: I don't know. That's what I'm worried about.",

        "Cole: That's why I've been spending so much time with her, to make sure she's okay. I think she just needs someone to talk to.",

        "Cole: She's a mess. I should've never kept this from you, all right, but she was so embarrassed about it, and she made me promise not to say anything.",
