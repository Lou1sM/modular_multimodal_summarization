        "David: A real game changer, isn't it? So here's the new plan. You divorce Clint, now.",
        "Kim: How did you find this?",
        "David: Well, I knew where to dig. Did a good job, though, keeping it hidden.",
        "Kim: Not good enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Wow. This is your idea of a simple home cooked meal?",
        "Blair: Well, it's my home, and somebody cooked it. And we get to have the place to ourselves.",
        "Eli: It's really nice.",
        "Blair: Do you like it?",
        "Eli: How do you plan on keeping warm out here?",
        "Blair: Well, I figure this heater's going to kick in soon. Well, what did you think?",
        "Eli: Oh, I don't know. I thought maybe after dinner...I've missed you.",
        "Blair: I missed you. And after dinner...mmm. Mmm.",
        "Dorian: Somebody better tell me what's going on here, because I'm sure as heck going to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I thought somebody was going to come back here. They promised us an update.",
        "Todd: There must not be any news.",
        "Kelly: Huh, or it's really bad news.",
        "Todd: Kelly, you might not get that chance to talk to Mitch about your mom.",
        "Kelly: Okay, don't say that.",
        "Todd: It's a small price. If there's any justice in the world, Mitch Laurence is dying a slow, painful death right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: What are you waiting for? He's dying. Schuyler Joplin gave him a drug that will kill him. That's the antidote. Use it or he'll die!",
        "Brody: Will he?",
        "Bo: Brody...",
        "Brody: I can't think of one reason to save this bastard's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Look, Sierra isn't your daughter.",
        "Schuyler: Not my...don't.",
        "Oliver: She isn't.",
        "Schuyler: Don't. Everybody's insane today. Stop saying that.",
        "Oliver: It's true.",
        "Schuyler: Like hell it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Rex, you're still my brother. Nothing changes that.",
        "Rex: Yeah, except that I'm not.",
        "Natalie: What, because you're not blood? We've known that for a long time, and that's never mattered before. You are still the same guy that you were before Roxy came in here.",
        "Rex: And who was that guy? Just some mutt Roxy dragged home?",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Rex: Allison tells her that I'm her baby and then--and she just takes her word? Who does that?",
        "Natalie: Roxy. You know, honestly, I'm glad that she decided to leave when she did. I think you needed some space.",
        "Rex: Nothing's the same.",
        "Natalie: I know it feels that way, but you're not alone. You still have me, and you have Shane.",
        "Rex: I can't take this to Shane.",
        "Natalie: No, of course not, but you've got to talk to Gigi.",
        "Rex: And tell her what? That I'm a stranger? \"Nothing you thought about me was true\"?",
        "[Fast footsteps]",
        "Gigi: My God, Rex. I just heard the news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, I have something important to tell you, too.",
        "Cole: Yeah?",
        "Starr: I tried not to, just like you did with Hannah's O.D., but I can't.",
        "Cole: Okay, what's the deal? Is it worse than Hannah's thing?",
        "Langston: I slept with him, all right? You happy?",
        "Cole: Starr? Tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: David, this is old news.",
        "David: I think Clint will find it ripped-from-the-headlines.",
        "Kim: No, no. I'm not this person now.",
        "David: Can we take that chance?",
        "Kim: This is not who I am anymore.",
        "David: Oh, come on. You think a ring and a \"Mrs.\" In front of your name changes anything? Oh. There you go. Now you got me.",
        "Kim: You can't show this to Clint. It'll kill him.",
        "David: I made copies. Did I make copies? I meant to make--I did. I made copies.",
        "Kim: What do you want, David?",
        "David: Was I not clear on this earlier? Just leave, Kim. Pack a bag. File for divorce from far, far away, and forget about ever being a Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I thought you had plans, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: I did and I do. Counselor, so good to see you again.",
        "Eli: Lovely to see you, too, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Do you mind my asking you what your intentions are?",
        "Eli: My intentions?",
        "Blair: His intentions are to have dinner with me tonight.",
        "Dorian: Ah, yes, it always does begin with dinner, doesn't it?",
        "Blair: What is your problem with Elijah? As I recall, he kept you from sharing a jail cell with Mitch Laurence.",
        "Dorian: Professionally, he is above reproach.",
        "Eli: Oh, well, thank you, but personally?",
        "Dorian: Personally, your brother held my niece at gunpoint and nearly got her killed.",
        "Blair: Ugh!",
        "Eli: Oh, I remember, but I am not my brother.",
        "Dorian: I need something more than that.",
        "Blair: What more do you need?",
        "Dorian: What--huh--makes you worthy to date my niece?",
        "Blair: Okay, what happened to not meddling?",
        "Dorian: I'm not meddling. That's--",
        "Blair: You are so meddling. You are meddling.",
        "Dorian: It's a perfectly reasonable question.",
        "Blair: The only thing that you need to know about this very handsome man is his last name is not Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: You can't leave this room, ma'am.",
        "Kelly: I understand.",
        "Todd: Yeah, man. Why are you leaving?",
        "Kelly: Don't help, Todd, okay?",
        "Todd: The place is on lockdown, anyway, right?",
        "Kelly: You must know something. Did something happen in the infirmary? Did someone get hurt?",
        "Guard: We don't know. A former inmate, Allison Perkins, showed up with a baby.",
        "Kelly: So she's in the middle of this now? There's a baby in there?",
        "Guard: Just stay inside, ma'am. I'll let you know when you're free to go.",
        "Kelly: Okay. What is Allison doing with a baby?",
        "Todd: Well, Allison is Mitch's zombie. And...and if he asks Allison to bring him a baby, then she's going to bring him a baby.",
        "Kelly: And if he asked her to kill Melinda Cramer, would she do it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: The messenger can't die! His work isn't done!",
        "Brody: What's left, Mitch? You already tried to rape your own daughter. You fried her brain, took away years of her life. What else do you have planned for her?",
        "Allison: Give him the drug!",
        "Brody: What else would you do to the rest of this town? I can stop him right now. I don't have to do a thing.",
        "Warden: I cannot stand here and let a prisoner die--not in my house.",
        "Bo: All right. Brody...",
        "Brody: Plenty of people in this town who would love to dance on your grave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Okay, I think I've got it straight.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Dorian: He is not his brother and he is not Todd Manning, but who is he?",
        "Eli: Well, I would be happy to procure my resume.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Blair: No, you are not going--wow, I hear the doorbell. Wow, you should maybe run along and get that.",
        "Dorian: Wow, we'll just let Matilda get it.",
        "Blair: No, I let Matilda have the night off so we could have some privacy.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: I see. Eli, I'm going to keep my eye on you. If you hurt my niece, you're going to have me to answer to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Huh.",
        "[Markko rings doorbell]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Promise me this will stay between us.",
        "Cole: Sure.",
        "Starr: No, not \"sure.\" Really. Because you're going to want to tell someone, but you can't. Okay?",
        "Cole: Okay.",
        "Starr: You promise?",
        "Cole: I promise. Look, Starr, you're scaring me. Is--is there something wrong with you?",
        "Starr: No, it's not me.",
        "[Footsteps approach]",
        "Starr: It's about Langston.",
        "Langston: Starr? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You know?",
        "Gigi: It's all over the news.",
        "Natalie: Gigi, what are you talking about?",
        "Gigi: The prison. There's a standoff. Schuyler is holding Mitch hostage, and I just heard that Allison Perkins showed up with a baby. That has to be Sierra.",
        "Rex: It is.",
        "Gigi: Okay, you know about this? Guys!",
        "Natalie: Gigi, there's something else.",
        "Rex: I talked to Bo. He's at the prison and--",
        "Gigi: Okay, come on, let's go, Rex! We need to make sure the baby's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Fish, just stop. Stop. It's enough.",
        "Oliver: Look, I know that it's a lot to take in.",
        "Schuyler: You know what? I--Mitch Laurence is my father now. And Roxy apparently is my mother.",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Yeah, that was my day. Everything I ever knew about myself is up for grabs, except her. She's it, man. She's the one thing, the one true thing, the only thing that matters. And I--I--I need you to back off, because I'm not in a mood to play games right now.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, neither am I.",
        "Schuyler: Well, whatever it is you think, you're wrong.",
        "Oliver: Listen, I'm not trying to hurt you or make your life harder.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, then don't--then don't. Stop.",
        "Oliver: I know how much you love this baby. That's why I have to tell you sooner than later. I should have done this a long time ago.",
        "Schuyler: Fish, you're not doing anything.",
        "Oliver: Yes. I'm trying to fix a mistake. I'm sorry, Schuyler, but you're not Sierra's father. I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You know what? I bet Allison was involved. Mitch can't go anywhere, but with her in the picture...",
        "Todd: Fantastic. Mystery solved. Let's go.",
        "Kelly: No. No, not until I look her in the eye.",
        "Todd: Oh, come on, really?",
        "Kelly: I want Allison to look me in the eye and tell me how my mother died.",
        "Todd: Kelly, Allison is two bricks short of a load, man. She's--she's a cup and a saucer short. And she's loosely packed, to say the least. You're not going to get anything from her that you could believe.",
        "Kelly: Well, you know what? I know when someone is telling me the truth or not. I can tell what's real or not.",
        "Todd: Yeah--Kelly, I'm telling you--",
        "Kelly: Todd, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to go home and pretend nothing's wrong?",
        "Todd: Yeah, but that could be the case.",
        "Kelly: Two calls! From some guy who sounded very scared, like he was putting his life on the line to speak up. He called and told me my mother was murdered. I have to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so you slept with Stacy. That doesn't make you Sierra's father.",
        "Oliver: Right, because she could have slept with a lot of people?",
        "Schuyler: Yes.",
        "Oliver: Yes, and that's what I thought. I kept telling myself it could be anybody's kid.",
        "Schuyler: Well, yeah, 'cause that's true.",
        "Oliver: So I had a D.N.A. test. Sierra's my daughter, Schuyler. I can prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: The baby was fine when I saw her.",
        "Gigi: You saw her?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Allison took her to Foxy Roxy's. I walked in on them.",
        "Gigi: Well, how long ago was that? Anything could have happened by now.",
        "Rex: Morasco, just take it--",
        "Gigi: Don't tell me to calm down and not worry. She's a baby. You have to watch out for her every minute. What kind of mom would just sit home and not know that her baby was okay? Rex, I have to know--",
        "Rex: Bo is watching out for her. He will not let anything happen to her, okay? I trust him.",
        "Gigi: Okay, but--",
        "Rex: If we go there, we will just be in the way. And that's if they let us in. I'm sure the place is locked down.",
        "Gigi: They did say that on the news.",
        "Rex: Okay. So we'll wait. Bo will call us the minute there's news.",
        "Gigi: Maybe you're right.",
        "Rex: Sure I am.",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "Natalie: Um, Gigi, there's something more that Rex needs to tell you.",
        "Rex: Natty?",
        "Natalie: Tell her. You need to.",
        "Rex: I'm okay.",
        "Natalie: No, he's not.",
        "Gigi: Rex? What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: You're murdering him!",
        "Bo: Shut up!",
        "Allison: You're murdering him!",
        "Bo: Shut up!",
        "Allison: Heavenly father, your messenger is in danger. Please, God, save your messenger. Save him.",
        "Bo: She...Brody, what are you doing?",
        "Brody: How many times have we all said it? How many people have tried to kill this monster and he always comes back? We have him.",
        "Allison: He's never done anything wrong, Lord.",
        "Brody: I don't have to do anything. I can just let him die.",
        "Bo: That's not you.",
        "Brody: He killed Jared. He left your niece a widow. He hurt Jessica more than anyone has ever done before.",
        "Bo: I know. That's him.",
        "Allison: I know you love him. Please save him.",
        "Bo: But if you let him die, who are you?",
        "Allison: Mitch stopped breathing!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole and I were just talking.",
        "Langston: Seriously?",
        "Starr: Yeah. Seriously.",
        "Langston: Starr, can I talk to you, alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dorian grumbles behind door]",
        "Dorian: What is your problem? Markko, I thought your parents raised you better than that.",
        "Markko: I'm sorry, Dr. Lord, I just expected someone to answer sooner. Is Langston upstairs?",
        "Dorian: No.",
        "Markko: Well, she came by to pick up her sheet music.",
        "Dorian: No, she's not here.",
        "Markko: Maybe you just didn't see her.",
        "Dorian: Langston is not in this house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Starr: You're making this really awkward.",
        "Langston: Oh, yeah? How awkward would it be for you to tell Cole about my personal life? You promised me you wouldn't tell him about Ford.",
        "Starr: I can't do this. I love Cole, I trust him, and he trusts me.",
        "Langston: That has nothing to do with this.",
        "Starr: He just told me something that he had to keep secret for Hannah, because he felt like it would be lying to me if he didn't tell me. That's exactly how I feel.",
        "Langston: Okay, except you don't know anybody else who knows Hannah, so you couldn't blab her secret even if you wanted to.",
        "Waitress: Coming through!",
        "Langston: Starr, you promised me that you'd keep quiet. Okay, Cole's known Hannah, what, a month? Two? She's just his study buddy. I'm your best friend.",
        "Starr: It doesn't make it any easier.",
        "Langston: Starr, please.",
        "Starr: You can't ask me to do this. You can lie to your boyfriend, but you can't ask me to lie to mine.",

        "Blair: Look, I'm sorry. Dorian was supposed to be going out.",
        "Eli: It's okay.",
        "Blair: She's a little protective.",
        "Eli: That's completely understandable. But, Blair, if you're more comfortable, we could go to a restaurant.",
        "Blair: Oh, you think that's going to stop her?",
        "Eli: Well, it might throw her off our trail for a little bit.",
        "Blair: Actually, Dorian is part of the package with me. What's that? Second thoughts?",
        "Eli: Oh, no, no, not at all. I was just trying to imagine. If Dorian is this protective with her niece, what she must be like with her own daughters...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Look, I know it's asking a lot, but if you tell Cole, he's going to tell Markko.",
        "Starr: Cole would keep quiet if I asked him to.",
        "Langston: No, you know he's going to say something. He'll have to. Do you really want Markko to find out from Cole?",
        "Starr: I want this all to be a bad dream.",
        "Langston: Oh, look, will you just at least give me the chance to tell Markko myself? Is that fair?",
        "Starr: Are you going to tell Markko?",
        "Langston: Now is not the best time.",
        "Starr: What does that even mean? Is that even you talking? Why are you doing something like this? You are so much better than that. Ford is a creep. You should just break up with him.",
        "Langston: You don't know him.",
        "Starr: I know that he had a thing with Hannah. That's really true.",
        "Langston: Yeah, I know.",
        "Starr: You do? How?",
        "Langston: He told me. I went to see him.",
        "Starr: I thought you were supposed to hang out with Markko tonight.",
        "Langston: Okay, I had to know.",
        "Starr: So you just left? What did you tell Markko?",
        "Langston: That I went to Dorian's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I haven't seen Langston all day long.",
        "Markko: Well, maybe she came in through the kitchen.",
        "Dorian: No, I would have seen her.",
        "Markko: She told me she was going to be here.",
        "Dorian: She did? When?",
        "Markko: Not that long ago, but she should have been here by now.",
        "Dorian: So in other words, she's--she's missing?",
        "Markko: Well, no, no, I--",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, no. She is not--",
        "Markko: I don't think so.",
        "Dorian: Where she told you that she would be. Therefore, she is missing.",
        "Markko: Okay, maybe we just got our signals crossed.",
        "Dorian: Or maybe Mitch Laurence sent somebody.",
        "Markko: No, Dorian...okay, you don't think that--",
        "Dorian: Oh, whoa--he couldn't do something like that? Not from behind prison bars? Ha.",
        "Markko: What are you doing?",
        "Dorian: I'm looking for my cell phone. I'm going to call the police.",
        "Markko: No--no, no, wait. Look, we probably just got confused. Let me call Langston first, okay? We'll--we'll clear this up.",

        "Kim: I can't leave Clint.",
        "David: Well, that's not in question. You're leaving. The question is, how do you want to go? You want to leave on your own accord, or do you want to be thrown out? Asa left Nigel some pointy-toed cowboy boots. I bet he'd put 'em on if he got to kick your ass across the moat.",
        "Kim: Why are you doing this?",
        "David: I'm the good guy here. I'm protecting my family.",

        "David: That's right. It's always about sex--uh, money.",
        "Kim: There's got to be a way we can live together.",
