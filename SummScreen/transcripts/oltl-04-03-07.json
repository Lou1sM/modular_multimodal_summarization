        "Layla: Oh, come on, Rex. Even you have to admit, he's booty-licious.",
        "Rex: Do I have to?",
        "Layla: I guess we're not really aiming for guys, but women are going to want their men to look just like him in our line. Who wouldn't?",
        "Rex: Adriana?",
        "Layla: You've really got a problem with Tate, don't you?",
        "Rex: Me, who -- why would I?",
        "Tate: Whoa! The Tate cleans up good. Place looks great --",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",

        "Bo: Come in, Nora. Thanks for coming on short notice.",
        "Nora: Looks like a meeting of the arson busters.",
        "Bo: Right.",
        "Nora: I'm looking for some good news here. Please tell me you caught the bastard who burned my house down.",
        "Bo: Not yet.",
        "Nora: Got a lead?",
        "Talia: Well, first of all, we know Vincent Jones had nothing to do with it.",
        "Nora: How?",
        "Antonio: We were able to determine motive.",
        "Nora: Which is?",
        "Antonio: The connection between Jones, me, Cristian, and you.",
        "Nora: And that is?",
        "Bo: These were hate crimes, from a member of a group called \"One Pure People.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hey. Hey. Glad I caught you. I'm just leaving for the hospital board meeting.",
        "Todd: Hey, so am I. Thought I'd give you a lift.",
        "Viki: You drove all the way out here to pick me up?",
        "Todd: Is there something wrong with wanting to spend time with you? Uh-huh. I'm going to dog you till you spit it out, so spit it out.",
        "Viki: I'm fine. Ok, if you must know, Clint dumped me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: If what's-her-name has forgotten her key yet again -- whew.",
        "Clint: Hello.",
        "Dorian: Clint.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Hi, yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "John: Look, about last night --",
        "Natalie: It shouldn't have happened.",
        "John: Maybe not.",
        "Natalie: But I'm not going to say that I'm sorry that it did.",
        "John: Me, neither.",
        "Natalie: It doesn't change anything. I still think that we should end things. You're not going to try and stop me, are you?",
        "John: You were right. We need space.",
        "Natalie: That's the polite way of saying that it's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So the cowpoke dumped you. I didn't know you guys had been going out long enough for you to qualify for being dumped.",
        "Viki: Well, we haven't, not really. Well -- I mean, we've had a few dates, that's all. But then, you know, the thing is at Christmas he came to me and he said, oh, he wanted to explore other possibilities with me and, you know, do things together and experience new things.",
        "Todd: Like getting along?",
        "Viki: Oh, shut up.",
        "Todd: Uh -- so you said yes, but he jerked you around anyway.",
        "Viki: No, I said no, and then I changed my mind, so I sort of jerked him around.",
        "Todd: But really, what you wanted was to explore these -- these new possibilities, whatever the hell that means, with him.",
        "Viki: Yes, yes. I didn't -- you know, it took me a while to realize it, that's all.",
        "Todd: Yeah. That's a family trait, isn't it?",
        "Viki: The thing is, you know, I went to Clint and I told him exactly how I felt and what I wanted.",
        "Todd: Which was?",
        "Viki: Well, to be together with him again.",
        "Todd: Well, you know, I'm more interested in the -- the \"dumped\" part. Get to that.",
        "Viki: The thing is I didn't think we could do that until we dated exclusively -- just each other, you know?",
        "Todd: Who else have you been dating?",
        "Viki: Nobody. He's been seeing Dorian.",
        "Todd: Oh, jeez. Well, they deserve each other.",
        "Viki: Yes, they do now because, you see, what I did was I went and told Clint all of this at the palace restaurant while he and Dorian were on a date.",
        "Todd: Oh. You're kidding.",
        "Viki: Oh, it's not funny -- I wish I were. No, and then the robbery and Blair got shot and nothing was resolved, but then afterwards, Clint came over here and said to me, \"oh, no, you don't really want to be with me. You just don't want me to be with Dorian.\" How dare that man \"presume\" to know what I think or how I feel? Anyway, it's over.",
        "Todd: Before it had a chance to start.",
        "Viki: Yes, yes.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry -- that sucks.",
        "Viki: Yes, you could say that -- \"that sucks.\"",

        "Dorian: You should've called first. I wasn't expecting company.",
        "Clint: Are you on your way out?",
        "Dorian: No, just got back in. Went to the hospital to see Blair.",
        "Clint: Well, how's she doing?",
        "Dorian: Much better, thank you. Nice outfit. What you been up to?",
        "Clint: I've been doing a lot of thinking. Last night, I swiped one of Pa's good bottles of bourbon and I went out to the stable to try to drink myself into a decision of what it is I want.",
        "Dorian: So did you make a decision?",
        "Clint: Unfortunately, no.",
        "Dorian: Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, I know it's over. You know, I'm not second-guessing myself, changing my mind.",
        "John: I understand.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. I know because you feel the same way I do, don't you?",
        "Natalie: I wanted this to work, John.",
        "John: Me, too.",
        "Natalie: Just -- you know, there's nothing left to say.",
        "John: Said most of it last night. It's not like we're never going to see each other again.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I mean, we'll -- we'll still be friends.",
        "John: Yeah. You think we can?",
        "Natalie: I'd like to.",
        "John: So do I. Well, no reason to say goodbye, then, right?",
        "Natalie: No, I mean, not really. There's -- we're not really saying goodbye. I better go.",
        "Natalie: So I'll call you unless they make me take a vow of silence at the convent.",
        "John: You know, a vow of silence sounds pretty good to me. Maybe I should join a monastery.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. I don't see you as the monk type -- you know, the whole hair thing and vow of chastity. Sorry, I guess I shouldn't have brought that up. Hmm.",
        "John: It's ok.",
        "Natalie: So, I'm probably just going to go back to my mom's and stay there till I figure out what I'm going to do next -- not that I ever officially lived here anyway.",
        "John: Stop. This was your home, too.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Felt like it sometimes. So I'll see you at work.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Hey, you two going away? Some nice, quiet time -- that's what you crazy kids really need.",

        "Adriana: Can we just please keep this professional, Tate?",
        "Tate: What? I was talking about all these pictures of my better self you have plastered all over the place. But you do look pretty hot yourself. The model, underwear model -- I mean, designer.",
        "Layla: So that's why you're not running the Tate Harmon fan club anymore.",
        "Rex: I thought he was a good ballplayer.",
        "Layla: And now you just think he's a player.",
        "Rex: Adriana's hip to the game, I'm not worried.",
        "Layla: Why do you look worried? Adriana's totally into you. Stop!-- it's twisted and boring. Forget it. Just believe in let's finish setting up.",
        "Rex: Ok.",
        "Tate: I didn't mean to embarrass you, but I can't help it -- it's true.",
        "Adriana: I -- I just don't want to hear it, okay?",
        "Tate: Ouch.",
        "Adriana: Oh, all right, ok.",
        "Tate: Why not? Does it make you jealous?",
        "Adriana: Could you please stop? We have a lot of work to do before all of your adoring fans show up.",
        "Tate: Oh, right, yeah. Well, I hope they're not all over me like those two the other night or I just might have to kiss you again.",
        "Adriana: Don't even think about trying it. This girl's a mean kick-boxer from way back.",
        "Tate: Really?",
        "Adriana: Yeah.",
        "Tate: It's ok. I know you're just saying that because Rex is here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So you're telling me that all these arson cases are racially motivated by some white supremacist?",
        "Bo: Or a group of them.",
        "Antonio: We haven't been able to determine if they were done by an individual or different members of the same group.",
        "Nora: Vincent Jones is African American --",
        "Antonio: Cristian and I are Hispanic --",
        "Nora: And I'm Jewish.",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Bo: And you have a biracial daughter, Nora.",
        "Nora: That son of a bitch. Tell me everything you know about this group.",
        "Antonio: Talia broke the case.",
        "Talia: The video footage that we have of the medallion I found in your basement, it wasn't clear enough.",
        "Nora: I know all of that already, go on.",
        "Antonio: Talia was hypnotized, so we -- we wanted to see if she could remember anything else about it.",
        "Talia: I did. There was a dove and some writing.",
        "Evangeline: \"Unus putus populus\" -- like Bo said, \"one pure people.\"",
        "Antonio: It's what they call themselves.",
        "Nora: So what do you know about this group?",
        "Antonio: Only that they operate deep underground. They have no affiliations and their MO Is intimidation, fear, and violence to get what they want.",
        "Nora: Racial purity?",
        "Bo: It seems so. And now, one or more of them is trying to achieve that goal right here in Llanview.",
        "Nora: What are we doing to catch this -- these people? Bo: Right now, we don't have much to go on. Oh, there's got to be something. I mean, this group has got to be registered or have a membership list or some sort of web presence.",
        "Antonio: Nothing.",
        "Nora: Nothing?",
        "Antonio: At least so far. Officer Sahid is doing a good job of hunting down whatever we find on the search engine.",
        "Nora: Ok, so what are we saying here -- that we're looking for more than one person and we got squat?",
        "Talia: Well, there hasn't been another fire in a while, and --",
        "Nora: And what? And we're waiting until there is one, waiting until someone else loses everything they have, waiting till someone else gets caught in -- in flames here, waiting until someone else gets burned to death like Jones' guy, Ted? Like Matthew and I were supposed to, Jess? Yeah -- there's already been one murder. How many will it take?",
        "Bo: Nora, you know we're doing everything we can.",
        "Nora: It's not good enough, Bo. I lost everything I have because somebody didn't like who and I am. I want this bastard caught! And if I have to crack heads in the meantime, so be it.",
        "Evangeline: -- let me handle it.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Don't let her crack too many heads. Nora's right. We've got to stop this guy before somebody else dies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So what made you want to go back for thirds of Clint?",
        "Viki: Maybe I don't want him to be with Dorian. Oh, you know what? If he -- if he wants that witch, he can have her.",
        "Todd: You're not going to fight for him?",
        "Viki: Throw myself at somebody who doesn't want me -- are you insane?",
        "Todd: Good! Great! You're better than that, aren't you? You're better off without him anyway -- you always were.",
        "Viki: Why are you in such a good mood today?",
        "Todd: I don't know. Life is really good right now. You know, what can I say?",
        "Viki: Because of what?",
        "Todd: Well, Starr broke up with her druggy boyfriend, and Blair and I are finally over.",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah -- how many times have I heard that?",
        "Todd: No, she and Cristian really sealed the deal this time.",
        "Viki: Well, what's Cristian got to do with it?",
        "Todd: Oh, you didn't hear? She and Cristian decided to -- to keep each other warm up on Llantano Mountain.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Todd: I know -- it's disgusting, isn't it? Anyway, I'm moving on -- so should you.",
        "Viki: Well, I don't have a choice, do I?",
        "Todd: You know, you think too much. You should just act, do, move.",
        "Viki: We got to go to the hospital and that board meeting. You know what? When we get there, I'm going to eat a Danish.",
        "Todd: Yes! Danish -- doughnuts!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So after a whole night of drinking and talking to the horses in the stables, you still could not come to a decision?",
        "Clint: No, what I meant was that I didn't drink. I realized that this was a decision that I had to make stone-cold sober. So I ditched the bourbon, I saddled up a horse, and I went out riding and I was thinking and I was thinking out loud and I said, \"so, Clint, what are you going to do now that you've told Viki you don't have a future with her?\"",
        "Dorian: Whoa.",
        "Clint: That's it? That's your only reaction? \"Whoa\"?",
        "Dorian: What do you expect me to say, Clint? You tell me that you've told Viki that the two of you don't have a future together. Fine. What difference does that make to me?",
        "Clint: Dorian, it's got everything to do with you. I spent all of last night, I've spent the better part of a year, trying to figure out what it is that I want, and what I want --\ufffd what I want is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So where are you going? The islands, I hope -- great time of year for it, hot and steamy. Where you going, on the love boat? Oh, wait a second. Oh, wait a second, I got it. Ok, folks, your secret is safe with me, and you're going to have a shower when you get back home.",
        "Natalie: Roxy, stop, please.",
        "Roxy: What did I say?",
        "Natalie: We're not going anywhere together. I'm moving out.",
        "John: Yeah, it's true.",
        "Roxy: You no-good, dirty son of a bitch.",
        "John: Oh! Wow!",
        "Natalie: What the hell did you do that for? Are you ok?",
        "Roxy: Well, I can certainly fix that. That's what you get for breaking my baby's heart!",
        "Natalie: He didn't do anything, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: He dumps you, and then you go to the mat for him?",
        "Natalie: John didn't break up with me. I did it.",
        "Roxy: Well, last I heard, he was going to pop the question. Natalie: Yeah, well, I was wrong. Well, how do you get confused about something like that?",
        "Natalie: It's a long story.",
        "Roxy: I'll bet it is. So what do you have to say for yourself?",
        "John: I think Natalie said it all.",
        "Roxy: So there's no \"happily ever after\" in this deck of cards, huh?",
        "Natalie: Not for us, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: We'll be open in a few minutes, ladies! I got to say, they're scary- looking.",
        "Adriana: You think I'm not falling all over you because Rex is here?",
        "Tate: Jealous boyfriend.",
        "Adriana: That's got nothing to do with it.",
        "Tate: So you're saying he doesn't care?",
        "Adriana: He has nothing to be jealous about.",
        "Tate: That's because you're bending over backwards not giving him a reason.",
        "Adriana: You just get off on this, don't you? Trying to make me squirm? Seeing how I'll react?",
        "Tate: The truth? Yeah.",
        "Adriana: Why?",
        "Tate: Well, I haven't exactly made it a secret how I feel about you.",
        "Adriana: I am in love with Rex, ok? Nothing is going to happen between you and me.",
        "Tate: Mm-hmm.",
        "Adriana: I'm seri-- I'm serious, ok? Nothing, nothing. No flirting, no wondering what would happen if I weren't with Rex, ok?",

        "Woman: I want the red dressy things. Second woman: Oh, so cute. La lad well, I guess there really aren't any men. Welcome to EXPOSED and our very own spokesmodel, major league baseball superstar Tate Harmon.",
        "Tate: All right, who's catching the first pitch here?",
        "Rex: What was that all about with you and the home run king?",
        "Adriana: Nothing. Just some last-minute business.",
        "Rex: Ok, cool.",
        "Adriana: You don't believe me, do you?",
        "Rex: Did I say that? Adriana: No, but you look like it.",

        "Nora: I want these people stopped.",
        "Evangeline: I know, honey. I know this scares you, but you are not the only victim here, ok? I mean, I was the one who recognized that dove from the medallion.",
        "Nora: My God, did something happen to you?",
        "Evangeline: Look, it was a long time ago. A couple of families, including mine, moved into this -- this neighborhood. It was an all-white neighborhood, and somebody from on the side of our house in the middle of night...I was sleeping or something and --and -- and just thinking that -- that there was nothing but a pane of glass between me and whoever -- anyway, they -- they made calls, they sent threatening letters.",
        "Nora: You must have been terrified.",
        "Evangeline: Anyway, they were saying, it was someone we knew, you know? -- one of my friends...I don't know. But my parents -- my mom and dad -- they weren't backing down. Even though we felt like we were being watched all the time, they re not going to back down, and I just kept thinking, we're not hurting anybody, you know? This doesn't make any sense.",
        "Nora: It never makes sense. Blind hate doesn't make any sense. They could come after you again, you know that?",
        "Evangeline: Oh -- don't think it hasn't occurred to me.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Indeed. Clint: And I don't want to repeat any mistakes that I have made by going into something...",
        "Clint: Yeah, as far as you're concerned, Dorian, to say that there's bad blood between our families would be underestimating it by a mile. You know, you are equal parts amazing, mysterious, alluring. You're also frustrating, exasperating, manipulative, self-absorbed, self-righteous --",
        "Dorian: Thank you. I get the point.",
        "Clint: Again, I'm all of those things myself.",
        "Dorian: We have a lot in common.",
        "Clint: Yeah, maybe too much, huh? You know, I'm surprised that you're still interested in me, considering the way I've treated you lately.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me. Who said I was still interested?",
        "Clint: Well, you were, you know, in recent days.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. Things change. I am mercurial.",
        "Clint: Mercurial -- I forgot about that one.\ufffd I need to ask you a question.",
        "Dorian: Ask away.",
        "Clint: After everything that we've been through, Dorian, down through the years, and recently -- the awful, the -- the not so bad, the -- the kind of good -- would -- would you ever consider giving us a second chance?",
