        "Ramsey is obviously scheming something in regard to his three officers. And Antonio is furious at Talia and John for being so friendly to each other and disrespecting him. And it looks like Ramsey wants to set John up to look like he is keeping drugs in his possession so that Antonio can have the chance to bust him. Viki asks Dorian why she is so unrealistically friendly, all of a sudden toward her daughter marrying Rex, knowing that she was totally against it from the start. She knows Dorian is up to something. After Jared has revealed to Natalie that he lied about being a Buchanan, she does not tell the others. But she is furious at him. She doesn't want to forgive him nor \"take advantage\" of the fact that they are not related. Charlie is also very worried about what will happen when Viki finds out he and Jared lied. At that cabin, Nora and Lindsay argue and obsess about the Buchanan brothers as usual. The group leaves the cabin after Clint gets a call that they have to tend to business back at the office."

        "Ramsey: Where's McBain?",
        "Officer: I just saw him down at the diner -- with Sahid.",
        "Ramsey: All right, Officer, here's your assignment for today. Pick your man to work with.",
        "Officer: Look, just so you know, McBain and your girl were looking pretty friendly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Ramsey even said we make a good team. There's no reason why we shouldn't work together.",
        "John: Oh, I can think of one -- Antonio.",
        "Talia: Well, if Antonio doesn't trust me, that's his problem. It shouldn't matter who I work with.",
        "John: Hey, look, I know this has been rough for you. Look, I -- I have to get back to the station. Thank you, ma'am.",
        "Roxy: Hey, babe, how's it hanging? Whoa.",
        "Roxy: Looks like Johnny McB's got trouble with a capital T.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: Yeah, you got it. I'll be right down.",

        "Talia: Carlotta. Hi. I -- I didn't see you come in.",
        "Carlotta: I know -- but I saw you. Excuse me.",
        "Roxy: I haven't thought about Jumbo Malino in years.",
        "Charlie: Huh -- he was quite a character.",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Man, I can't believe that you know him. How long did you say you lived in Atlantic City?",
        "Charlie: Well, really, just a short time, but I guess Jumbo made an impression on me.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. He used to throw one hell of a party, man.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I get a headache just thinking about those parties. You know something -- where the hell is Dorian?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, she better get here quick. You know, we got a couple of weeks till this wedding. We got to nail down those plans.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Roxy: Oh, go ahead. Take it, take it. Hey, listen, I got to floss my teeth before I eat.",
        "Charlie: Ah -- hello.",
        "Jared: Uh, yeah, it's me. Can -- can we talk?",
        "Charlie: Well, for a minute, yeah.",
        "Jared: Okay, I wanted to call you earlier, but I can't get a cell phone signal up here.",
        "Charlie: Well, you're up at the Buchanan lodge, right?",
        "Jared: Yeah, and, um, I wanted to tell you that -- that Natalie knows the truth.",
        "Charlie: Whoa, slow down a minute here. What -- knows the truth about what?",
        "Jared: Yeah, she knows I'm not a Buchanan.",
        "Charlie: How did she find out?",
        "Jared: Well --",
        "Natalie: Who are you talking to?",
        "Jared: Did you get all that?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I got it. Call me later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: It's got to come from me. I have to be the one to tell her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, excuses, excuses -- I'm sick to death of them. Am I going to have to take over this project myself? Good. Then do it! Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: That was Phyllis from headquarters.",
        "Natalie: Oh.",
        "Jared: I think we accomplished a lot this morning. It was a very productive meeting.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, it was a relief for me that Dad and Uncle Bo were getting along again.",
        "Jared: Yeah, yeah, yeah, except that you never once looked in my direction.",
        "Natalie: I guess it's because you told me everything I need to hear. That's enough.",
        "Jared: Hmm.",
        "Natalie: Now I'm getting back to work.",
        "Jared: Natalie? Can I ask you something?",
        "Natalie: If it's business related.",
        "Jared: Yeah, it is -- in a way. I just need to know exactly how long you plan to keep my secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What the hell are you doing in my office?",
        "Ramsey: Looking for you. I have a new case for you, maybe more challenging than the previous ones.",
        "John: Oh, really? More challenging than stolen tricycles?",
        "Ramsey: Well, we'll see. I want you to do a drug buy at the warehouse down by the river.",
        "John: That was Ortiz's case.",
        "Ramsey: Now it's yours.",
        "John: I don't know the setup.",
        "Ramsey: Well, now, there's a printout on your desk -- read it.",
        "John: You know, Ramsey, you and I should have a little talk.",
        "Ramsey: Why? What would we \"have a little talk\" about?",
        "John: Only one thing -- the real reason you took this job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: When's it going down?",
        "Officer: About an hour from now, warehouse district.",
        "Antonio: All right.",
        "Talia: You told your mother, didn't you?",
        "Antonio: What are you talking about?",
        "Talia: Carlotta -- I just saw her and she was pretty nasty to me. Why?",
        "Antonio: Oh. Oh, well, you know, maybe you and John should think about having your little intimate conversations somewhere else other than my mother's diner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Swing music plays]",
        "Lindsay: Oh, that music is so loud.",
        "Nora: Working in here, Lindsay.",
        "[Music stops]",
        "Nora: Hey -- hey! Put the music back on, please.",
        "Lindsay: Well, being up in the country hasn't mellowed you at all, has it?",
        "Nora: Put the music back on, please.",
        "[Lindsay sighs]",
        "Lindsay: Yes, ma'am!",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Lindsay: At least Bo and Clint ought to be getting back from their hike soon, and Matthew. They did take Matthew with them, didn't they?",
        "Nora: That was the idea.",
        "Lindsay: Nigel's gone shopping. Kind of quiet around here -- except for that awful music.",
        "Nora: Okay -- you know what? I'm going to be the grownup here. Go ahead -- you go put on whatever music you want. No, really -- go put on whatever song you'd like. As long as it shuts you up, I don't care. Go ahead, put on a theme song to an old TV show, or whatever it is -- I don't care. I just have a lot to do -- work to do, so please don't bother me.",
        "[Music stops]",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "[New age music plays]",
        "Lindsay: So, Bo and Clint seem to be really pleased with what they've accomplished this morning. It's nice to see the two of them working so well together.",
        "Nora: Yeah, so you keep saying ad nauseam.",
        "Lindsay: Well, forgive me for repeating myself and trying to make civil conversation.",
        "Nora: Okay, Lindsay, what happened to \"please don't bother me\"?",
        "Lindsay: You know what the truth is, Nora? Everything is bothering you. Clint working so closely with Bo bothers you, me living with Bo bothers you, me being up at the lodge with Bo bothers you. You're conflicted feelings with Bo bothers you. Everything is bothering you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Let's see -- when am I going to tell everybody your secret? I don't know -- I guess when I feel like it.",
        "Jared: Look, I realize that you're upset with me.",
        "Natalie: Oh, come now, Uncle Jared. Why in the world would I be upset -- because you played me for a fool? Because you're not who you claim to be?",
        "Jared: I was in the beginning -- sort of. Look, I was more than willing to tell everyone the truth last night, but you stopped me. Why?",
        "Natalie: And as I explained to you last night, I'm not going to tell everybody this secret while B.E. is still under attack, okay? The last thing we need right now is a scandal being thrown in our faces, especially one like \"grandpa's long-lost son is a total fraud\"? I mean, the press will have a field day with it, not to mention the shareholders will just react negatively. I don't even know what else!",
        "Jared: So, in other words, you're not going to answer my question about telling people?",
        "Natalie: You're right -- I'm not. In fact, I'd rather see you sweat it out, constantly wondering at which strategic moment am I going to pull the plug.",
        "Clint: Who's my daughter pulling the plug on now?",
        "Jared: Uh \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: No, you just name the charity.",
        "Viki: Well, that's very kind of you.",
        "Carlotta: No, you and Gigi were a great help that night filling in, I didn't know what I would've done without you, and I know you won't take the money, so I just want to donate your salary and tips.",
        "Viki: Okay. Then make it the Angel Square Fund.",
        "Carlotta: Thanks, Viki.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, Charlie? You look a little ferblunjit.",
        "Charlie: Yeah --",
        "Roxy: Oh, that's like you've seen a ghost or something.",
        "Charlie: No, no. I'm -- I'm fine.",
        "Roxy: Oh, really? Can't fool me, because we got a kid together. The phone call -- it was bad news, wasn't it?",
        "Viki: Charlie? You have bad news?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: I have no time or interest in chatting about my career with you.",
        "John: Yeah, you know, I didn't really think you would, but I thought it was only fair to put you on notice.",
        "Ramsey: About what?",
        "John: About the fact that you're not fooling anyone. I know you're hiding something.",
        "Ramsey: You read over that printout carefully -- I wouldn't want you to mess this up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Chalk one up for Ramsey.",
        "Antonio: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Talia: You know what it means. He's getting exactly what he wants.",
        "Antonio: Oh, really? Well, it looks to me like you're getting exactly what you want, Talia.",
        "Talia: What do I want?",
        "Antonio: Working with John.",
        "Talia: I am doing my job.",
        "Antonio: Oh, right. Okay, well, you know what? You could've walked away from the assignment, but you chose not to.",
        "Talia: I should've known Ramsey was going to tell you a bunch of crap. You know, don't you see what he's doing?",
        "Ramsey: Vega, Sahid, we're moving out.",
        "Antonio: Well, looks like you're going to have to work with me now, too.",
        "Talia: Ugh.",
        "Antonio: Think you can handle it?",
        "John: You're going?",
        "Ramsey: I can get my hands dirty to make sure the troops are holding up their end. Let's go. Let's go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki, I'm glad you're here. I need to talk to you.",
        "Roxy: What am I, chopped herring? We got a wedding to plan.",
        "Viki: I'm very sorry. I really didn't mean to --",
        "Charlie: No, no, no, it's okay.",
        "Dorian: Why, Viki. I'm surprised to see you out of your waitress' uniform -- or have you added wedding planner to your already eclectic resume?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay. You know what? Here, take this pen. Take the pen. Take the paper. Take the paper -- I want you to write something down. Just jot it down and then I want you to commit it to memory because we will not have this discussion again, okay? Write this down -- write it. \"Nora does not have conflicting feelings about Bo and Clint.\" There.",
        "Lindsay: Okay, maybe I used the wrong term --",
        "Nora: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Lindsay: I'm not a psychologist.",
        "Nora: This is no -- there's no term here. I do not have a problem with Bo and Clint working together. I think it's wonderful, I think it's fabulous, I think it's grand.",
        "Lindsay: Okay, I get it. You think that Bo and Clint working together is grand!",
        "Nora: Yes!",
        "Lindsay: But that does not negate the fact that you are uncomfortable being up here with the both of them, and you want to know what I think? I think it's making your head spin!",
        "Nora: Oh, Lindsay, no, no, no. See, you're making my head spin. I didn't even want to have this conversation, but I'm afraid if I don't, you'll go and have it with Bo and -- and that I do not want happening because it'll just push his blood pressure right through the roof, so here it is -- you ready? Bo and I are friends. We share a child, we respect each other. That's it -- end of story.",
        "Lindsay: It just kills me that you think I'm so clueless. You think I haven't noticed that you and Bo have been looking at each other and the way you've been looking?",
        "Nora: What are you talking --",
        "Lindsay: It was all last night and this morning, too.",
        "Nora: What looks are you talking about?",
        "Lindsay: Well, the flirty ones.",
        "Nora: \"Flirty\"?",
        "Lindsay: Yeah. It's -- the two of you alone in that car with all that wine and the blankets, it's like you've developed a brand-new crush on each other.",
        "Nora: Oh, for God's sake, you act like we planned the whole thing. It was a car accident, Lindsay. We were lucky we weren't killed. We were waiting for someone to find us.",
        "Lindsay: Well, you know what they say -- there are no accidents.",
        "Nora: You're right. Bo planned the whole thing. It took him years to train that deer to jump out in front of us just like that. Oh, for God's sake -- you know what the real question is here? You know what the real poser is? Why do you have such an obsession about Bo and me? Do you want us to get back together -- is that what this is all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I was just discussing with Jared the -- the facilities managers. Some of them aren't pulling their weight.",
        "Clint: Well, stop discussing it. Pull the plug, get rid of them.",
        "Matthew: \"Facility managers\"? What do they do?",
        "Bo: Well, Buchanan Enterprises has many different subsidiaries and they have buildings, supplies, and things like that that need people to manage them.",
        "Clint: Yeah, if they're working for Buchanan Enterprises, they got to get high marks. If they don't do their best, they get replaced.",
        "Matthew: Sometimes I do my best in school but I don't always get A's. Would you fire me, Uncle Clint?",
        "[Clint chuckles]",
        "Clint: No, of course not.",
        "Bo: Son, you know, as long as our employees are working hard and they're loyal, they'll -- there will always be a place for them with B.E. -- right, Clint?",
        "Clint: That's right. When Jared first came to B.E., we had our doubts about him, but then he -- he proved himself to be a hard worker. He certainly knows the business. He knows how to close a good deal.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but he stinks at foosball.",
        "Jared: Ah, thanks!",
        "Natalie: He's not that bad.",
        "Matthew: Bet I could take you again, two out of three.",
        "Jared: Sure, maybe later. I have work to do.",
        "Matthew: Oh -- oh, yeah.",
        "Bo: Well, you know what? It can probably wait for a while -- go ahead.",
        "Matthew: Come on.",
        "Jared: Let's do it.",
        "Clint: You know, I'm glad that we got this moment alone because your Uncle Bo and I, we've been wondering if everything's okay between you and Jared.",
        "Natalie: Yeah -- why wouldn't it be?",
        "Bo: Well, we picked up on a little friction earlier and most of it was on your part, so is there something we should know?",
        "Clint: Are you keeping something from us, Natalie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[New age music plays]",
        "Lindsay: No, I don't wish you and Bo would get back together. Do you think I would wish that for Bo after the hell you put him through? I wouldn't wish you on any man.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, at least I don't go around killing them.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah -- no, you just have the bad judgment to marry a killer, the one that murdered my daughter.",
        "Nora: You stop bringing that --",
        "[Matthew and Jared talk]",
        "Matthew: Yeah, that's why I'm going to kick your -- Mom? Uh -- yeah, we didn't know you guys were in here.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, we're just in here having a -- having a little chat.",
        "Matthew: Well, me and Jared were just going to play a video game, but it could wait.",
        "Nora: No, no, no, no, no, no! You help yourself to the room. I'm going to go and get some fresh air.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Matthew: What's up with the music?",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "[Music off]",
        "Matthew: Oh, here's a swing C.D. Did you put this up here, Mom?",
        "Nora: I sure did.",
        "[Swing music plays]",
        "Lindsay: I didn't know you liked that music, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: Are you kidding me -- Count Basie and Duke Ellington? They're, like, geniuses. My mom and dad love swing -- so do I.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: It's called having good taste. Bye, guys.",
        "Lindsay: See you, fellas.",
        "Matthew: Whew. Yeah. So, why don't I look for that game? Whoa, check this out -- old photo albums. Want to look at them?",
        "Jared: Ah -- maybe later.",
        "Matthew: Bet you're bummed because you're not in them.",
        "Jared: No, actually, that doesn't bother me.",
        "Matthew: Well, it bothers me. You're a Buchanan -- you should be in them. Well, uh, I brought a camera, so why don't I take some pictures of you while we're here?",
        "Jared: Cool. Come on, let's -- let's find that game.",
        "Matthew: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What -- what would be going on with me and Jared? I mean, I don't agree with him all the time -- so what?",
        "Clint: Well, you seem to be disagreeing with him even though the rest of the room, and yourself included, knew that he was right.",
        "Natalie: You know, I think that's a little bit of a distortion of the truth, don't you think so, Uncle Bo?",
        "Bo: Actually, I don't think so.",
        "Clint: You were being hostile for no apparent reason, which leads me to suspect that you are feeling threatened by your Uncle Jared?",
        "Natalie: \"Threatened\"? That's ridiculous.",
        "Bo: Hey, Natalie, Natalie? Come on, wait a minute. I understand that he took over some of your responsibilities at B.E.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, and you know what? I was all on board for the responsibilities he took over.",
        "Clint: You know, the thing that bugs me is that you don't want to give him credit when he does something good. Now, he's been an asset to B.E., you know? He's exceeded all my expectations, not to mention that he saved your sister's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, you know what? That's just great. He's a hero. You know what? We should all just be really thankful that he's in our lives, okay? Why -- why don't we just throw a freakin' parade for him?",
        "Clint: Well, that's ironic that when all my doubts about Jared being a Buchanan have been erased, you're more cynical about him than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, Dorian, that was a very good idea. Since Viki is the classiest person here, I think she should help us with this wedding.",
        "Dorian: Huh. Excuse me. Roxy, I am the mother of the bride. It's up to me to decide who will plan and who will attend the wedding.",
        "Roxy: Well, I'm the mother of the groom and I think I should have my say, and I say that Viki helps us. Viki, you are bringing Charlie to the shindig, aren't you?",
        "Charlie: Oh, sure, I'll be there.",
        "Roxy: Good, and -- and talk to Jessica and Nash, okay, about the vineyard because I want to get a discount, like a 75%, maybe you can noodle them a little bit.",
        "Viki: Well, I -- uh -- I'll try.",
        "Roxy: Okay, everybody, sit down.",
        "Viki: You know what, Roxy? I don't think Dorian is comfortable with this. I'm going to --",
        "Dorian: I'm fine.",
        "Roxy: See? She's fine. Okay, everybody sit down. Come on. Come on, sit. Sit down; we got lots of plans to make. Come on, everybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: All right, Vega, you and Sahid stay here, I take the rear. Eddie, you come with me. Now, John will need time. Nobody moves until we get a signal. All right? We got to know from this guy to know he's got the goods. Here -- better get it all back.",
        "John: Anything else I should know? Did Ortiz say anything?",
        "Antonio: Only what was in the file.",
        "John: Okay",
        "Antonio: Be careful.",
        "Man: Stop right there. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "John: I came for that. I brought your cash.",
        "Man: You're not Besaro.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Okay. So the guys pay for the privilege of dancing with the bride. And the chicks -- they pay for the privilege of dancing with the groom.",
        "Adriana: They pay?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, like a buck, two bucks. You know, actually, it probably should be about $5 because of deflation and everything like that. Okay, so once the bride gets some money, she has these pins in her bra. And she takes them and she pins all the money going down. So that way, they got a lot of money, and they'll be able to go on their honeymoon, because God knows we're not going to pay for that.",
        "Dorian: Oh, heaven help us.",
        "Viki: You know, Rox, maybe we should allow Rex and Adriana to make those kinds of decisions, you know, and while we're here, we can focus on the menu. Okay?",
        "Roxy: I don't know exactly what we're going to serve, but I think we found our caterer. Whoa. I want to go talk to Carlotta about this. Because these cheese things -- they're a little slice of heaven.",
        "Dorian: Oh -- ahem.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Charlie: Whoa -- ahem. Oh, this is work. I'm going to have to take this. Um -- excuse me.",
        "Dorian: Well, it's a really wonderful thing that you did -- getting Charlie a job at B.E.",
        "Viki: I had absolutely nothing to do with it.",
        "Dorian: Oh, come, now.",
        "Viki: I didn't. Charlie's a very independent man. He would never stand for my pulling strings for him. He got that job completely on his own.",
        "Dorian: Ah. Well, then, I think it's really wonderful the way that Charlie has been putting down roots here in Llanview. And now, he's going to be attending his son's wedding. Oh, yes, indeed. Charlie's really turned his life around.",
        "Viki: Speaking of weddings -- why are you suddenly so good and hot for the idea?",
        "Dorian: Oh. Well, my daughter is going to be getting married. Why wouldn't I be thrilled?",
        "Viki: Because you don't like Rex. And you don't approve of Rex and Adriana as a couple, and you never will.",

        "Natalie: Wow. Talk about presidential candidates flip-flopping, they got nothing on you, Dad.",
        "Clint: Natalie, what does that mean? What are you talking about?",
        "Natalie: I just don't understand the sudden adoration for Jared. I mean, wasn't he the one that you wanted to throw out of your house because you were so disgusted and creeped out by him? And now all of a sudden, you're enamored by him. I mean, like, you're his biggest fan -- you know, maybe you don't need me to work at B.E. anymore, because you've got your \"genius\" little brother working there.",
        "Clint: Natalie -- Natalie, that is not what we're talking -- Natalie? What's with her?",
        "Lindsay: Is she all right?",
        "Bo: We don't really know what the problem is.",
        "Lindsay: Well, how was your hike?",
        "Bo: That was great. Yeah, that was invigorating.",
        "Nora: I thought I heard yelling. Is everything all right?",
        "Clint: Yeah, everything is just fine. You get your work done?",
        "Nora: Oh -- no, not much of it, really.",
        "Lindsay: Well, it's really a shame you have to do so much work here in such a gorgeous place, on a beautiful day. Don't you ever take a break?",
        "Nora: No, no, no. I'm just a boring workaholic stick-in-the-mud.",

        "Nora: Thank you.",

        "Jared: You got some mad skills, my friend.",

        "Jared: Me? No. I've never played this game before.",
        "Matthew: You mean you didn't have this game when you were my age?",
        "Jared: Well, actually, my bro-- no, no, I didn't. I didn't have any video games. Ahem.",
        "Matthew: It's like complete opposite of me. I have, like, way too many.",
        "Jared: Why do you say it like that?",
        "Matthew: Well, you know, guys always dog me about having everything because I'm a Buchanan. I mean, I'm lucky. I know that. You feel lucky, too, you know, since you're a Buchanan?",
        "Jared: Yeah, when I'm kicking it with you and the rest of the family, I feel very, very lucky to be a Buchanan. It's almost exactly what I dreamed it would be. Nearly perfect.",

        "Man: Wait. I need to count it.",
        "John: All right. I need to see you brought the good stuff.",
        "Man: I still don't trust you. Besaro didn't say nothing about somebody different showing up. So I'm thinking I'll just take the money and the drugs and go.",
        "John: So that's how it's going to be? You know, like I said, my people won't be happy, but it's not my cash.",

        "Antonio: Let's just do this, okay?",
        "Ramsey: Sahid seemed very concerned about you. If she knew your history with women, she'd be very concerned about herself.",

        "Dorian: You know nothing at all about me. You only assume, or arrogantly presume to know the workings of my mind. You're way off base.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Viki: So you've had a complete change of heart about Rex? You think it's positively wonderful and he is so worthy of your daughter's hand?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. Though I do admit, finding out that Charlie is his father helped me see the light. Because as you yourself have said, Charlie is a very caring and compassionate and honest man.",
        "Viki: Where are you going with this, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Charlie: Is everything okay?",
        "Dorian: Everything is wonderful. It's been divine to have this chance to catch up with Viki. And I was just telling her how I thought you were such a wonderful, caring, compassionate, honest man. And that I'm sure you passed those traits along to your son, Rex.",
