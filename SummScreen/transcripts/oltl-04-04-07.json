        "Langston: I so don't want to study for that Algebra test. Maybe if I put off studying, the test won't actually happen. After all, why do I need to pass algebra? After high school, I plan to become a stripper. Cole Thornhart?",

        "Todd: Really? Why?",
        "Evangeline: It's easy to pay for a meal, especially for you, but to actually make one, --That's kind of special.",
        "Todd: Even if it's peanut butter and jelly?",
        "Evangeline: You bet.",
        "Todd: Well, it won't be peanut butter and jelly. I have no idea what it's going to be, but it won't be peanut butter and jelly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You can come in.",
        "Miles: You sure?",
        "Marty: Yeah, I don't bite.",
        "Miles: Do you want me to throw those flowers away?",
        "Marty: It was a really sweet thing to bring them.",
        "Miles: But you don't forgive me for forcing myself on you?",

        "Cole: Starr, talk to me.",
        "Starr: No, I can't.",
        "Cole: There are no teachers around, and the Britney squad's not here. Why didn't you take my call?",
        "Starr: Because my dad checks. He tried to kill you if he tries again, he'll make sure this time.",
        "Cole: He's really done a number on you hasn't he?",
        "Starr: Cole, we broke up.",
        "Cole: Not because we wanted to.",
        "Starr: We're still over. Cole, I meant what I said -- that I would never see you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Why didn't you tell me Tate wants to go out with you?",
        "Adriana: Because it wasn't a big deal.",
        "Rex: Oh -- yeah, right. The guy's only poaching my girlfriend.",
        "Adriana: I knew you'd get all he-man on me. It's been handled, rex.",
        "Rex: How? You agreed to dinner and a movie?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Tate: She's taken, Layla.",
        "Layla: Do you have a code for that?",
        "Tate: You think I'm a creep?",
        "Layla: You keep saying \"Adriana's taken, \" but the subtext is \"not for long. \"",
        "Tate: Look, Layla, there's only two things in life that last forever -- death and taxes. Everything else is fair game.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Huh. I would rather not talk about that.",
        "Miles: Sorry. Must've been hard to forget it.",
        "Marty: For the longest time, that's all anyone would talk about, and for my well-being, I had to put it behind me.",
        "Miles: But -- but you didn't. The way you reacted to me --",
        "Marty: Miles, what you did was inappropriate, regardless of me being raped.",
        "Miles: But the rape -- it made it worse.",
        "Marty: Could we stop talking about the rape, ok? It -- it didn't define me. My life didn't end because I was raped. I -- I got married, I have a wonderful son. I have a job that I love.",
        "Miles: I -- it's -- you -- you don't want to be known by just that, that terrible thing that happened to you, I know.",
        "Marty: Yes, exactly.",
        "Miles: It's not the same, but in the sanitarium, everyone saw the monster's face.",
        "Marty: And they thought you were a monster on the inside, as well.",
        "Miles: Is that what it's like for you?",
        "Marty: At first.",
        "Miles: But you fought against it?",
        "Marty: Yes, like you are doing now.",
        "Miles: It's not easy.",
        "Marty: Miles, you were just -- you were still learning about how to fit in and I can't imagine how scary it would be.",
        "Miles: Losing you -- as a friend -- would make it much worse.",
        "Marty: You won't. Ok? You -- you're a good person, Miles. You -- you did something wrong and you tried to correct it, like -- like with these.",
        "Miles: And now I know why Spencer hated Todd so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Ok, any -- any particular likes or dislikes?",
        "Evangeline: Uh -- no. No.",
        "Todd: You don't sound so sure. I don't want to make you Brussels sprouts or something and have you spit them out in my napkins. What's your fantasy meal?",
        "Evangeline: Oh -- that. Forget it. Forget it, this is stupid.",
        "Todd: No, I'm -- no. I want to know. What is it?",
        "Evangeline: Ok, ok. Uh -- the first time I went to New York, my Uncle Carl took us to this really wonderful place. It was a Creole restaurant and, well, he knew the owners because he used to live in new Orleans and he played all the clubs there, so he told us we could order whatever we wanted, and Layla, who had no imagination at all at the time, ordered a burger and fries.",
        "Todd: Huh. Not you, though.",
        "Evangeline: No, no. I started with Oysters Rockefeller.",
        "Todd: Ha!",
        "Evangeline: And -- oh, then, coq au vin and --",
        "Todd: Oh, jeez.",
        "Evangeline: And then, I think the grand finale was bananas foster.",
        "Todd: Mmm. That sounds great.",
        "Evangeline: It was, it was more than great. It was -- magical. No -- no. Forget it. No, I can't ask you to make that for me.",
        "Todd: Why?",
        "Evangeline: Where would you start, Todd? You can't boil water.",
        "Todd: I'd start in my kitchen with the ingredients.",
        "Evangeline: No, no. I love -- I love peanut butter and jelly.",
        "Todd: I don't like peanut butter and jelly at all.",
        "Evangeline: You're crazy. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Your feelings can't just disappear overnight.",
        "Starr: This is not about my feelings, Cole.",
        "Cole: You can't let your dad run your life.",
        "Starr: My dad almost killed you! Being stopped by Detective McBain and your mom did not scare him straight.",
        "Cole: Let me worry about him, ok?",
        "Starr: You have a death wish?",
        "Cole: Do you still love me?",
        "Starr: That's not the point.",
        "Cole: That is the point. That is everything. Do you still love me?",
        "Starr: Cole, I -- Cole, if -- if you love me, then you'll stop this, please.",
        "Cole: Say you don't love me, right now, and I'll walk -- I'll walk away, and I'll never bug you again.",
        "Starr: I don't love you.",
        "Cole: You're lying.",
        "Starr: If you don't stop this, I'll have to report you.",
        "Cole: Ok, now I know you're lying.",
        "Starr: Try me. Your mom will send you to military school if my dad kill you first.",
        "Cole: You're crazy.",
        "Starr: No, you're crazy if you don't think that I'll do that!",
        "Cole: Do what you have to do, Starr. At least I'm the one that's not lying to myself.",
        "Starr: Cole --",
        "Langston: Starr? Let him go. Just let him go.",
        "Starr: It's so hard.",
        "Langston: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Where do you get off asking me a question like that?",
        "Rex: I'm -- I'm just saying if the situation was reversed and there was some hot babe falling all over me, I'd be eating it up.",
        "Adriana: Would you go out with her?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Adriana: But you would be flattered?",
        "Rex: Absolutely.",
        "Adriana: And you would know that it was totally harmless?",
        "Rex: Totally.",
        "Adriana: Then I accept your apology.",
        "Rex: Huh?",
        "Adriana: Well, the one you were about to give me -- for thinking that I would ever do anything to hurt you. How many times do I need to say I love you?",
        "Rex: I don't think the number's been invented. I'm sorry.",
        "Adriana: I already told you, apology accepted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You're right. Nothing's forever, but Adriana and Rex have a good shot.",
        "Tate: Hmm. The odds are against them.",
        "Layla: You're depressing.",
        "Tate: No, I'm realistic. How many people do you know who thought they'd found true love only to have it blow up in their face?",
        "Layla: That won't happen to those two.",
        "Tate: Yeah? You got a crystal ball?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Look, Spencer's hatred of Todd has nothing to do with me.",
        "Miles: Then why did he hate him so much?",
        "Marty: Because he was in love with Blair, and she loves Todd.",
        "Miles: How could she love a --",
        "Marty: A rapist?",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Marty: The heart's not logical.",
        "Miles: Must be painful for you to see Todd get a second chance?",
        "Marty: I believe Todd regrets what he did to me. And I don't think he will ever hurt another woman that way, but the pain that drove him to rape -- it still drives him.",
        "Miles: So he finds other ways to hurt women?",
        "Marty: Look, I -- I'm not making any excuses for him, but he -- he grew up with a very controlling, angry father.",
        "Miles: \"Biology is not destiny. \" Isn't that what they say?",
        "Marty: For you, it's true. But for Todd -- I mean, you didn't grow up with an abusive father, he did. The man he thought was his biological father scarred him for life, and so in order to control his world, to control his environment, he -- he has this need to control women and, you know, Blair I think has finally had enough of it, but Starr's young and I think she's a little afraid of him.",
        "Miles: Will he hurt her?",
        "Marty: Physically, no. No, never, but emotionally? For as long as she lets him.",
        "Miles: Wow, that's too bad. But it makes sense, I guess, from what Spencer told me.",
        "Marty: Spencer talked to you about Todd and -- and his family while he was treating you?",
        "Miles: No, he didn't tell me in the sanitarium. He told me -- after he had died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know, when John told me that he loved me, I thought that was enough. You know, I thought -- I thought we were going to live happily ever after just because he said those words.",
        "Viki: unfortunately, it's only in romance novels that loving someone is enough. The writers always conveniently omit the hard work and the lack of communication and the arguments.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. You just described my relationship with John.",
        "Viki: Is that why you broke up with him?",
        "Natalie: Huh. Remember how I told you that he was going to propose?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm. You were very happy.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, I jumped to the wrong conclusions like a moron. You know, when he gave the ring to those robbers, I couldn't believe it. I thought that's why we were at the palace, that he was -- he was finally going to do it. Everything was finally going to happen.",
        "Viki: Well, that's a logical conclusion.",
        "Natalie: Not really. -- Hadn't been getting along at all. Why would I think that John wants to get married? I mean, I was in total denial. And then I pretty much put the words in his mouth and he just couldn't say no.",
        "Viki: Well, that sounds like John.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I steam-rolled over him.",
        "Viki: That does sound like you.",
        "Natalie: Mom, I practically grabbed the ring and stuck it on my finger -- thank God I didn't. Oh. You know, God. I thought -- I thought after the accident, things were going to be different, and they -- they were, they were. Just brought out the worst in us. I mean, we were, like, the match made in hell.",
        "Viki: No. No, darling. No. No, you did love each other. You did not imagine that.",
        "Natalie: Do you think that if John hadn't been in that accident, that we'd be married by now?",
        "Viki: Well, I don't know, but it really matter because you can't change the past. Hey. You just have to take care of yourself now. You need to figure out what you need and -- and deal with that, ok? You have to look after yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, Mike. You think mom and dad would still be together -- you know, if the old man made it?",
        "Michael: No, I never really thought about it. But, yeah. Yeah, I do. I mean, they were crazy about each other. You're obsessing, John.",
        "John: What -- \"obsessing\"? I'm not obsessing.",
        "Michael: You and Natalie are not mom and dad. All right? You're too alike.",
        "John: Yeah -- pigheaded, always think we know better.",
        "Michael: Yeah. You know, mom used to tell me that her and dad couldn't wait to get home and talk to each other, you know? That -- that even after being apart for 12 hours, they'd talk like they'd been away from one another for 12 years.",
        "John: Is that the way it is with you and Marcie?",
        "Michael: Well, you know Marcie, you know? Five minutes away from her, she talks as if you've been gone for 15 years.",
        "John: Yeah, she can talk.",
        "Michael: But, yeah. Yeah, it is that way, you know. When I'm not with Marcie, I -- I think about her constantly, her and Tommy.",
        "John: How'd you know she was it?",
        "Michael: I don't know. I just looked at her and I knew.",
        "John: No doubts?",
        "Michael: None.",
        "John: Whew.",
        "Michael: Oh, and then Tommy came along and completed the circle, you know? He made us a -- a real family. So if that ever came out that --",
        "John: If what ever came out?",
        "Rex: Tommy's father is Todd Manning.",

        "John: I got to the scene on time, I guess.",
        "Michael: Nice. You arrest them?",

        "John: Yeah, they got enough problems with all the history between their parents.",

        "John: Yeah, it probably occurred to them, you know? To -- I don't know. I don't know how you do that. You can control all that anger when -- when someone's threatening the life of your own child.",
