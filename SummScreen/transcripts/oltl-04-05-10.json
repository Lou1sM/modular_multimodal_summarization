        "Kelly: To solve a murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hey, it's me. So who made those calls to Kelly Cramer? You know, I didn't hire you to make excuses. I hired you to find out why someone's saying her mother was murdered. Okay, I'm listening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Okay, all right, that's it. Why am I trying to get answers from a crazy person? I've had it, and Rex has had it, too. He's never gonna be the same after the things you said!",
        "Allison: You told him?",
        "Roxy: Of course I told him. I told him he wasn't my son, and I told him that the kid that I had with Mitch didn't make it, that my baby died.",
        "Allison: Except he didn't.",
        "Roxy: What are you talking about? You told me my baby died. You told me that you replaced him with a kid that you found at the hospital.",
        "Allison: That's all true. I replaced your son with that baby Rex. But as it turns out, your real son, the baby you gave birth to, survived. He's alive.",

        "Natalie: And what are you studying, biology?",

        "Natalie: Jess, I have told you now 20,000 times, Cris and I are divorced.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I still can't believe you married my boyfriend.",
        "Natalie: And I also told you that you guys weren't together. Look, that is not me. I don't steal.",
        "Jessica: Tell that to Marty Saybrooke.",

        "Natalie: And I think it's maybe a little inappropriate for you to be giving her rides and privately tutoring her.",

        "Natalie: Okay, and does Layla know you're here? I'll take that as a no.",

        "Destiny: Bartender. He used to be a teacher, but now he's a doctor.",
        "Dani: You're kidding, right?",
        "Destiny: He's in med school. He's on my brother's rotation.",
        "Matthew: So tomorrow's the big day, huh?",
        "Dani: Why? What's going on?",
        "Matthew: They're posting the cast list. Langston's musical.",
        "Dani: Oh, right, right. I forgot all about that. Well, unlike some people, my life doesn't revolve around some stupid school play.",
        "Destiny: Good. Then you won't mind being stuck in the chorus.",
        "Dani: What are you talking about?",

        "Rex: Well, I was sure they'd be here.",
        "Nora: Okay, so run this by me again. Now, Allison Perkins somehow got her hands on Schuyler Joplin's daughter?",
        "Rex: Only she's not Schuyler Joplin's. She's Oliver Fish's.",
        "Nora: I thought he was gay.",
        "Rex: Yeah, apparently he's open-minded. Or he was.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Ahem. It's a long story. Bottom line is, Allison brought the baby to Schuyler at Statesville. By now, she and Mitch, they're both in custody, but then Fish shows up with a DNA test. He took custody of the baby.",
        "Nora: Oh, wow. Poor Schuyler.",
        "Rex: Yeah, well, poor Schuyler took Allison's gun.",
        "Bo: No. We don't know that for sure.",
        "Rex: Mitch doesn't have it. Allison doesn't have it. Who could have taken it?",
        "Nora: Wait a minute. What does Schuyler need a gun for? He's a doctor.",
        "Rex: He's a sore loser is what he is.",
        "Nora: You think he'd use the gun to get the baby?",
        "Rex: Not the baby.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. You're looking for Gigi. You think he has Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What are you gonna do, shoot me?",
        "Schuyler: No.",
        "Gigi: You're waving a gun around, telling me you're not gonna let me leave.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, I would--I would never hurt you. Why would you say that?",
        "Gigi: Then put the gun down.",
        "Schuyler: I c--I can't.",
        "Gigi: Why not?",
        "Schuyler: Because you're not listening! I need to talk to you. I need to make you understand. Why do you think I brought you here, Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Okay, okay. Calm down.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so you're not gonna leave? Are you gonna leave?",
        "Gigi: No, I'm not gonna leave. Schuyler, I understand what you're going through, okay? You thought Sierra was yours only to find out that Stacy lied to you. I've been there. It's just the worst feeling in the world. You've lost everything that's important to you.",
        "Schuyler: Yes, yes, yes! Exactly! Stacy ruined everything.",
        "Gigi: But Stacy's dead. She drowned.",
        "Schuyler: I know, I know, and I'm sorry about that, I really am, but she destroyed my life. She ruined everything.",
        "Gigi: She was a very unhappy person.",
        "Schuyler: Yes, but she doesn't have to win. Gigi, don't you see, I may have lost Sierra Rose, but we--we have a second chance. Everything that we had, we can get that back because... we belong together.",

        "Todd: Okay, here's what I want you to--",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm gonna have to call you back. Thanks.",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you doing here?",
        "Todd: On a story.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. Right.",
        "Todd: What are you doing here? Where's Dani?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, she's with Nora and Matthew. Um, have you seen my client, Schuyler Joplin?",

        "Roxy: You're out of your mind.",
        "Allison: Your son, your real son is alive.",
        "Roxy: It's not enough that I thought Rex was mine but he wasn't and I took out so much hate on him because I thought he was Mitch Laurence's son or that I never got to bury the kid that I lost?",
        "Allison: But you didn't lose him! He's alive!",
        "Roxy: I don't have to listen to this.",
        "Allison: Roxy, this may be the last time I ever get to tell you the truth.",
        "Roxy: You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you on the ass.",
        "Allison: Don't you want to know where I was when you took that baby to see Mitch?",
        "Roxy: You went to thank your sister.",
        "Allison: And instead of finding her crying over a little corpse, she was all smiles. The baby was still alive. She saved him.",
        "Roxy: Are you saying this just to torture me?",
        "Allison: No, Roxy. I swear, the baby you gave birth to who was so sick, who we took to the hospital, Mitch's child, lived. He's alive, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: So what happened to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I mean, you came here to think about what you really wanted, and...you called me.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, but, Schuyler--",
        "Schuyler: Okay, no, no. I know. Hear me out. Things weren't working out with Rex, okay?",
        "Gigi: Because Stacy--",
        "Schuyler: No, no. No, that's not true. You were having problem with Rex for a while.",
        "Gigi: Only because Stacy--",
        "Schuyler: Stop it! Stop it! Stop blaming everything on Stacy! Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. I didn't mean to yell. I'm sorry. I'm just--I'm trying--okay. Okay. Ha! Think about when you called me, okay? You had a choice. You wanted to see me. I came over. We spent the night together. We made love.",
        "Gigi: 'Cause you lied to me.",
        "Schuyler: No! No, that--that's not true. We--we loved each other. Okay, yeah, I didn't tell you a few things about your sister, but haven't you ever lied to someone because you loved them so much you would say anything to make them stay?",
        "Gigi: You know I have. I lied to Shane about Rex. I lied to Rex to save Shane's life.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, all right, okay! So how is this any different?",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, I'm not saying it's different. It just--it was a mistake, okay? Terrible things happened because I lied to Rex.",
        "Schuyler: Ah, ah, yes, and Rex forgave you. So why--why can't you forgive me?",
        "Gigi: It's not that I don't forgive you--",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so what is the problem, then? Gigi, you forgive me and we love each other--",
        "Gigi: You keep saying that, Schuyler, but whatever it is we felt was based on a lie!",
        "Schuyler: No, it was not. No. It was real. What we had, it was real, and I am gonna prove it to you, Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I come home, and you're sitting here with your teacher.",
        "Jessica: Oh, please, this is not about that. You know, you may have moved on from my boyfriend--",
        "Cristian: Jessica, come on.",
        "Jessica: Fine. Ex-boyfriend. But you are still hung up on Marty's boyfriend, and now that she's pregnant with his kid, you know you have no chance with him, and you're taking that out on me and Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Okay, that's enough, that's enough. Look, can you get me a soda?",
        "Jessica: Me?",
        "Cristian: Please?",
        "Jessica: Ahh...",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry. I know that her head's all confused and she's lost all these years of her life, but I swear, Cristian, if you had not gotten her out of this room, I was gonna rearrange her face. And I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you.",
        "Cristian: It's okay. So what's going on? Was Jess right? Is it John McBain?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Please.",
        "Kelly: You know that Mitch was threatening Dorian's family.",
        "John: Uh, yeah. That's why she fired Bo.",
        "Kelly: She took that threat pretty seriously.",
        "John: Well, I wish she would have come to us.",
        "Kelly: That's why I'm here, John. Mitch threatens the Cramer girls, and then my mother dies. It appears to be a heart attack, only she's never had any heart problems. Then I start getting phone calls from someone who is insisting that she was murdered.",
        "John: Did the caller identify himself?",
        "Kelly: Nope. Nope. Keeps getting cut off. Or at least it feels that way. The calls are rushed. He's whispering, and then he hangs up quickly. Look, I assume that because Mitch was locked up, it had to have been one of his followers, so I talked to Allison Perkins.",
        "John: She denies it.",
        "Kelly: Actually, no. Allison claims she went to the clinic intending to murder my mother, only she was already dead.",
        "John: What?",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's-- that's what she told me. She was going to go after Cassie, but then she decided that my mother was an easier target, so she flew to California. She went all the way to the sanitarium and found out she was dead. Now, I know that she's crazy.",
        "John: Well, I wouldn't trust her.",
        "Kelly: That's just it, John. I mean, why go there? Why plan a murder? Why admit to that? I have to say that I believed her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Allison: Couldn't very well go running over to Statesville and tell Mitch the baby you brought him was a fake, so I gave your kid to my sister.",
        "Roxy: What?",
        "Allison: Why not? She'd give him a good life, a better life than you'd give him, and she couldn't have kids of her own, and she wanted him. You had two kids. What are you complaining about?",
        "Roxy: So he's alive and he's with your sister. And where is she?",
        "Allison: In Llanview Cemetery, I think, unless she was cremated.",
        "Roxy: So she's dead?",
        "Allison: She blew her brains out. Couldn't stand the guilt. What a waste. Eight years of medical school and boom! I guess that makes me the sane one. Ha ha!",
        "Roxy: Allison, Allison, so where is my son? Is he dead?",
        "Allison: See, that's your problem, Rox. You just don't listen. He's alive!",
        "Roxy: So where is he?",
        "Allison: He was just here a minute ago.",
        "Roxy: Here in Statesville?",
        "Allison: Yeah. You just missed him.",
        "Roxy: So he's in prison?",
        "Allison: Not yet. Although you never know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: And Schuyler took Mitch Laurence hostage.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: How?",
        "Todd: I don't know. From what I hear, Allison Perkins was the one with the gun, but they were all holed up in the infirmary for about an hour, and then it was over just like that. They hauled Allison and Mitch out of there.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, what about Schuyler Joplin?",
        "Todd: I don't know.",
        "T\u00e9a: And what about the baby?",
        "Todd: I don't know that either.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ahh.",
        "Todd: Oh, excuse me. You wouldn't happen to know what happened to that baby that Allison Perkins had here, would you?",
        "Guard: Uh, the baby was taken to safety by a cop.",
        "T\u00e9a: Who?",
        "Guard: Officer Fish.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, and what about Schuyler Joplin?",
        "Guard: As far as I know, he's still on the loose, armed and dangerous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Ah.",
        "Schuyler: You're afraid of me?",
        "Gigi: You're pointing a gun at me. Schuyler, what are you doing?",
        "Schuyler: You don't remember? I mean, this is--this is where it happened. This is where we made love.",
        "Gigi: Don't do this.",
        "Schuyler: What? Gigi, it was the best night of my life. I mean, you chose me. You called me, and I came over, and we drank and we laughed and we ate and we talked, and I kissed you, and you kissed me back, and you wanted me. And we made love, and I have never felt so close to another human being in my life, and I know you wanted it, too, Gigi. That doesn't go away. A connection like that doesn't go away.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, you're a counselor. You're--you're a doctor. You've got to see that this is a little weird.",
        "Schuyler: What? Wanting to talk?",
        "Gigi: Tricking me into coming up here, holding a gun on me and expecting me to somehow, I don't know, go back in time. Schuyler, I can't pretend like I don't know what you've done, and if you think I'm gonna have sex with you just so you can feel better about yourself, you can forget it. It's not gonna happen.",
        "Schuyler: It's not about the sex, Gigi! It's about who we were! It's about what we can get back if you just give it a shot. We loved each other. I'm not about to give that up without a fight.",
        "[Schuyler sighs]",
        "Gigi: What are you doing?",
        "Schuyler: I'm building a fire.",
        "Gigi: Please don't. Schuyler--",
        "Schuyler: Shh, shh! There's no point in talking. We've done that. Now I'm gonna show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I walked Natalie down to her car. I could not have been gone longer than 10 minutes. When I got back, Gigi had disappeared, only her wallet was still there. Her purse, her phone. She never goes anywhere without a phone.",
        "Nora: So what? You're thinking that he forced her to leave with him? I mean, was there any signs of a struggle?",
        "Rex: No. So either she was drugged--though I don't think there was time for that--or she maybe thought something was wrong with Shane or Sierra Rose.",
        "Nora: Is Shane okay?",
        "Bo: Oh, he's fine.",
        "Nora: Okay. Well, then, maybe you're thinking that he persuaded her to leave somehow?",
        "Rex: We got to find them before he does something crazy. We got to get a move on.",
        "Bo: Where else would they have gone?",
        "Nora: Well, they probably went someplace that would mean something to the two of them.",
        "Rex: Viki's cabin. It's where they--they slept together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, please take me home. I don't want to be here.",
        "Schuyler: Why? Wh--we were so happy here.",
        "Gigi: You're right, we were, and I know you're upset.",
        "Schuyler: No. I'm not. I'm not anymore.",
        "Gigi: You found out...",
        "Schuyler: Not anymore.",
        "Gigi: Your daughter isn't yours, and that has to be--",
        "Schuyler: Okay, I don't want to talk about that anymore. I don't want to talk at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Cristian: Because she's pregnant, and they're together.",
        "Natalie: So it would seem. And that's great, you know. I'm happy for them. I am. You know, I mean, that's great that they're having...a kid. I mean, not that I really ever thought that John would be a father, or end up with Marty, for that matter, but what do I know?",
        "Cristian: It bothers you.",
        "Natalie: No. Yeah. Yeah, I guess it does a little. Ahh. But it just seems so selfish, you know, not to wish them well. You're right. Jess is right. Oh, my God, I am so jealous!",

John and I ended up in this cabin all by ourselves, and I was a little out of it be--the point is, I kissed him. But he kissed me back, and, Cristian, I--I can't get this out of my head. It's all I think about. And I know. I know he's with Marty, and I know that they're going to have a kid, and... I just--I can't--I can't stop wondering what would have happened if Marty didn't get pregnant. Does that make me terrible?",
