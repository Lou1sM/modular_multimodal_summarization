        "Dorian: Let us have that table in the corner. It's so much more private and cozy.",
        "Maitre D': Of course, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Maitre D': Enjoy your dinner.",
        "Dorian: Ah.",
        "Clint: Thanks.",
        "Dorian: Clint?",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Dorian: I can still feel it -- your lips on mine, beating of our hearts together.",
        "Clint: We had a wonderful afternoon.",
        "Dorian: Oh, oh! Made my day. Oh no.",
        "Clint: What? Well, let's just go ahead and order our dinner.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. The ubiquitous Viki.",
        "Clint: Who has every right to be here, same as us.",
        "Dorian: Indeed, she does. In fact, why don't we go over there?",
        "Clint: No, I don't think so --",
        "Dorian: Yes!",
        "Clint: No, no --",
        "Dorian: Let's say hello to her. It's only polite. Why, hello, Viki. Are you dining alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: You and John broke up. How are you dealing with that?",
        "Natalie: I -- go ahead and say it, Vincent. You didn't think that John and I were right for each other to begin with.",
        "Vincent: I only said that I think you could do better than him.",
        "Natalie: Really? And how the hell would you know that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I thought you left.",
        "Antonio: I ran into Nora on my way out.",
        "Nora: I have something that I need to say and I needed to say it to both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: One of these has to be a lie. God, is this kid dead or alive?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Does it sting?",
        "Cristian: It's not a big deal. I'm ok.",
        "Blair: Of course it's a big deal. I just smashed a bottle over your head, Cristian. Nash, where's the ice?",
        "Nash: Right here.",
        "Blair: Ok. Maybe we should call an ambulance.",
        "Cristian: No, I'm not going to the hospital --",
        "Blair: Oh, come on.",
        "Cristian: And I sure as hell don't need anything from him.",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Blair: Just put this on your head.",
        "Cristian: You got your paycheck, right?",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cristian: So nothing else is keeping you here, right? So why don't you go?",
        "Nash: See, that is fine. That bottle was no match for that dense head.",
        "Blair: Here, here, at least put this on there because you don't want it to swell.",
        "Cristian: I'm fine, really.",
        "Blair: No, you're -- just keep it on there. Stop the bleeding.",
        "Evangeline: Were you in a fight, Cristian? Or is this foreplay?",
        "Blair: Uh -- no, but the night is still young.",
        "Cristian: I just had an accident, that's all.",
        "Evangeline: Are you ok?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I'm ok. What are you doing here?",
        "Evangeline: I came here because layla said this was your night off.",
        "Cristian: So if you knew that I was here, you wouldn't have come?",
        "Evangeline: Look, I don't want trouble. I just -- I need a drink.",
        "Cristian: You look upset.",
        "Evangeline: It has nothing to do with you.",
        "Cristian: Let me guess -- Todd, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: How about you let me buy you another drink since you spilled your first drink all over those adoption papers?",
        "Jessica: It was an accident, Nash.",
        "Nash: Didn't say that it wasn't, but you didn't answer my question -- if you're so sure that you're going to adopt Jamie, how come Antonio has signed up but you haven't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Right through the heart, you jerk. Now for the grand prize -- just a little lower. Oh. [Rex sighs]How long have you been standing there?",
        "Bo: I didn't want to interrupt the intense conversation you were having with yourself.",
        "Rex: I was practicing.",
        "Bo: Hmm. For what?",
        "Rex: Oh, I guess you'd call him -- my nemesis.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, well, well -- Dorian and Clint.",
        "Clint: Viki.",
        "Viki: No, I'm not dining alone, Dorian. I'm meeting someone for dinner.",
        "Dorian: A date -- oh, how nice. And, you know, people go around saying that it's so difficult for women of a certain age to meet single men.",
        "Douglas: Sorry to have kept you waiting. I had some last-minute business to attend to.",
        "Viki: Oh, not a problem at all. Douglas, this is Dorian Lord and Clint Buchanan. Douglas Kline -- he's a new member of the hospital board.",
        "Dorian: I know you. Douglas Kline -- Kline Industries.",
        "Douglas: A pleasure.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. Are you and Viki on a committee together?",
        "Viki: No. No, we actually just met today, and he invited me to have dinner with him.",
        "Douglas: Clint Buchanan? Hmm, Buchanan Enterprises.",
        "Clint: Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you.",
        "Douglas: Yes, it is.",
        "Viki: Enjoy your meal.",
        "Clint: You do the same. Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Hey, Nat, you can't allow this breakup to send you into some deep, dark hole. You know, there is a fleet of men out there that would be happy to be with you. And this self-pity thing -- I'm telling you, it doesn't look good on you.",
        "Natalie: I'm so glad I ran into you.",
        "Vincent: Ah -- see? All right, you're going to be just fine. You're a strong person, Nat, come on.",
        "Natalie: That I am.",
        "Vincent: Oh. So, you want to talk about it?",
        "Natalie: With you?",
        "Vincent: Hey -- all right. How about we have two cups of coffee and we talk about everything and anything but John McBain?",
        "Natalie: Like what -- religion and politics?",
        "Vincent: Well, that sounds good to me. Come on, let's have a seat. Hey, Shaun?",
        "Shaun: What's up?",
        "Vincent: Why don't you take the rest of the night off.",
        "Shaun: You sure?",
        "Vincent: Yeah. But before you go, would you get me two cups of coffee?",
        "Shaun: No problem.",
        "Natalie: Get them yourself.",
        "Vincent: Ok. I will.",
        "Shaun: Have a good night, boss.",
        "Vincent: Hey, Shaun, you be good.",
        "Shaun: See you in the morning.",
        "Vincent: In the morning. So?",
        "Natalie: Going to get those coffees? Good.",
        "Vincent: Two cups of coffee, coming right up.",
        "Natalie: Go get them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, of course. Why didn't I figure it out before?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Blair's voice: I can't get to the phone right now, but leave a message and I will call you back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, I think the bleeding has stopped, but we should probably put a band-aid on that.",
        "Cristian: There's -- there are band-aids behind the bar.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Cristian: So what did Todd do to you?",
        "Evangeline: My life isn't your business anymore, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: You're right. Forget it.",
        "Evangeline: I'm so tired of everybody bashing Todd.",
        "Blair: Oh -- why would anybody want to bash poor Todd? He's self-centered, belligerent, vindictive. You should probably give Todd a break. Cristian, is that better? Here you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong. Whether or not I adopt Jamie has absolutely nothing to do with you.",
        "Nash: Maybe -- but it has everything to do with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Did you see that? The way he kept holding on to my hand?",
        "Clint: What are you talking about?",
        "Dorian: Was giving me the eye. I know his type -- he's a letch, yes, he is. He is a card-carrying letch with a capital L. Uh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Douglas: So -- do I sense some tension between you and Ken?",
        "Viki: Oh, it -- it's Clint. Uh -- and, yes, you probably did. He's my ex- husband.",
        "Douglas: Oh -- ahem. And you want to remind him of what he's missing? Well, I can definitely help you with that. You don't mind if I enjoy myself in the process, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: If this is going to be another lecture about how bad Officer Sahid and I are handling the arson case, then, Nora, that's probably the last thing we need to hear right now.",
        "Nora: Of course it is, which is why I'm here to apologize for having been so hard on you earlier. I realize you both want to have a suspect in custody as much as I do, so I had no right to accuse you of --",
        "Talia: Of slacking?",
        "Nora: Of not working hard enough. I lost my temper, I was unprofessional and insensitive.",
        "Antonio: I understand.",
        "Nora: Thank you.",
        "Talia: I understand, too. I know you've been under a lot of stress.",
        "Nora: Officer Sahid? This is a very difficult time. This isn't just a case -- it's personal. I lost my house, everything, and I almost lost my son. Many people have been hurt. And unless we get this guy and the group that he works for and put a stop to them, more innocent people are going to suffer, or worse, be killed.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Talia: L.P.D., Sahid speaking. Got it. Ok. There's been another fire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: There is no \"us,\" Nash.",
        "Nash: Liar.",
        "Jessica: How come every time we see each other, we end up having the same pointless conversation?",
        "Nash: And we're going to keep having the same pointless conversation until you admit that you are crazy and madly in love with me.",
        "Jessica: What about your promise to stay away from me?",
        "Nash: What about your promise?",
        "Jessica: I'm trying!",
        "Nash: What's the point? I love you. I love you, and I want you and me and our daughter to be together. It's inevitable, you know that.",
        "Jessica: It's never going to happen, Nash.",
        "Nash: Why not? Oh, right -- because you're married to Antonio and you don't want to leave him -- why? Because you don't want to hurt him -- well, you know what? He is a grown man. He can take care of himself, and the last thing that that proud grown man needs is his woman to stay with him out of pity.",
        "Jessica: I -- I can't talk about this anymore.",
        "Nash: Don't you think that he's going to wonder why you're dragging your feet on the contract?",
        "Jessica: He already asked me, and I told him exactly why I haven't signed the adoption papers yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm on to you, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Oh? On to me in what way, Clint?",
        "Clint: You are trying to tell me that that guy's putting the moves on Viki to see if I will get up and run over there and try and rescue her.",
        "Dorian: No, I'm not.",
        "Clint: I'm right, I'm right. I'm right, and don't you even try to deny it.",
        "Dorian: Even if you were right, it's not going to change the fact that that guy is going to try and get Viki into bed tonight.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, you know, we both know that she can take care of herself, so we don't even need to discuss this. The thing is, I am here with you -- my choice, your choice, our choice. Now, if we're going to have a grown-up relationship that's honest and respectful, there are going to have to be some ground rules.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: No, no, you're -- you're mistaken, no. Uh -- I'm certainly not trying to make my ex-husband jealous.",
        "Douglas: Hmm.",
        "Viki: I think I'm way beyond playing juvenile games like that, and I expect so is he.",
        "Douglas: So you're here with me because you want -- ah. I like that.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm -- I'm here with you because you invited me. So --",
        "Douglas: So, how about a bottle of champagne?",
        "Viki: Not for me, thank you, no.",
        "Douglas: Afraid?",
        "Viki: \"Afraid\"? Afraid of champagne? No, uh -- fine, fine. I'll have a glass of champagne.",
        "Douglas: Or maybe more than that. Waiter? Your best champagne, please.",
        "\ufffdWaiter: Sure.",
        "Douglas: Magnum.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Now, when you say \"nemesis,\" I take it that you're talking about this guy Tate Harmon?",
        "Rex: Yeah -- \"The Tate.\"",
        "Bo: The what?",
        "Rex: Oh, that's how he refers himself -- in the third person. Not all the time, just enough to be annoying.",
        "Bo: No, no, I think that'd only take about one time.",
        "Rex: Tell me about it.",
        "Bo: Yeah. So this guy is still after Adriana?",
        "Rex: Let's put it this way -- think I should get a voodoo doll?",
        "Bo: Well, you know, as police commissioner, I'm really not at liberty to recommend any kind of method of --",
        "Rex: Tate destruction?",
        "Bo: Right.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Look at the guy, Bo.",
        "Bo: Well, you know something? That -- that picture, it's all -- you know, it's -- it's all been doctored up.",
        "Rex: Yeah, which means that Adriana spent a couple of uninterrupted hours looking at his you-know-what making tiny little brushstrokes.",
        "Bo: Uh -- Balsom? Is there something that you'd like to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Heavy on the milk, no sugar.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Vincent: You're welcome.",
        "Natalie: No, good company.",
        "Vincent: Well, I will be the judge of that.",
        "Natalie: What I mean is that, with the way I'm feeling, I just don't think I could be adorable.",
        "Vincent: But you're managing.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, ok.",
        "Vincent: So what happened between you and John? What was the last straw?",
        "Natalie: I thought we weren't going to talk about him.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, but now I'm thinking that you need to talk about it. How do you expect to move on and get your feelings out without talking about it?",
        "Natalie: I don't know what there is to talk about. We love each other, but we're just too different to co-exist.",
        "Vincent: Ah -- irreconcilable differences.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Vincent: So did you break up with him, or did he break up with you? You broke up with him. Good for you. That's all right.",
        "Natalie: I don't know what difference it makes. I mean, we know we're not right for each other. We both know it.",
        "Vincent: Hmm. You're sorry?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm hurt, pissed -- all of the above.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. It's probably going to be really hard for you to go to work and see him every day.",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm, thanks for reminding me. Yeah, I'm dreading it.",
        "Vincent: How about if I had him iced?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: This building that's on fire -- do we know anything about it?",
        "Talia: Other than it's a residence, according to dispatch, the F.D. and three units are on the scene.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God -- arson again.",
        "Talia: It's too soon to say that. I want to go down there.",
        "Antonio: Round up the other units, start a canvass. With any luck, somebody saw something.",
        "Talia: Ok, will do. I'll call you as soon as I get there.",
        "Antonio: Ok, good. Son of a bitch. [Antonio sighs] This is Detective Vega. I want all units on the scene at 4910 King Street. Everybody reports to Officer sahid. Recognize that address?",
        "Nora: No, but I know the neighborhood.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Me, too. Our arsonist struck again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Cristian, I was hoping that you could check out my set list.",
        "Cristian: Sure. Excuse me.",
        "Blair: What do you think?",
        "Cristian: Well, I think this song right here is one of your best.",
        "Blair: Oh, you're sweet!",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on -- you know it. And I think that you should probably announce it after your second set. That way, the crowd will stick around for the third.",
        "Blair: Oh, you're a smart boss.",
        "Cristian: You're the artist. I'm just going with my gut.",
        "Blair: Ok. It's a good idea.",
        "Todd: Hey, Cristian, get lost. I got to talk to you.",
        "Blair: Ah. The sooner I listen, the sooner he leaves.",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Blair: Ok -- what is it?",
        "Todd: Oh, something came up. I'm not going to be able to take -- hey. I'm so sorry about dinner. I actually called you a couple of times, but I'm sure it was too late. I have a good excuse -- I have really good news, at least I hope it's good news. But I have to leave for a couple of days, so I'm not going to be able to take care of the kids like I said I would.",
        "Blair: You're leaving town?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I have evidence that my son is alive and information about where he might be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You told Antonio you didn't sign the papers pourquoi?",
        "Jessica: Because we're making it a family celebration.",
        "Nash: Oh, that's a good one -- I mean, even though you and I both know that it's a lie. The real reason you didn't sign those papers is because by doing so, you'd fully committing yourself to Antonio and his family when really, you and I both know that you're in love with me, but you're doing the right thing, because the last thing you should do right now is drag Antonio's daughter into all of this.",
        "Jessica: Why do you keep on doing this? Why do you keep on doing this? How many times do I have to tell you -- I love Antonio, I'm staying with him, that's my decision, and there's nothing that you can do to change my mind.",
        "Nash: Oh, are you sure of that?",
        "Cristian: Get away from her. Get out or I'll throw you out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, that was lovely.",
        "Douglas: More?",
        "Viki: No, no, thank you, no. Actually, that was rather foolish of me. I shouldn't have done that. No, I'm finished, thank you.",
        "Douglas: I can't drink all of this by myself.",
        "Viki: Well, I'll join you with some water.",
        "Douglas: Water?",
        "Viki: Sparkling water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You're not eating. Is your filet mignon tres saignant?",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Dorian: Too rare.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, no, no. It's fine. I just don't like being ignored.",
        "Dorian: Oh? And how have you been ignored?",
        "Clint: Well, you ignored what I was saying.",
        "Dorian: Ok, Clint. Would you have rather that I was more confrontational?",
        "Clint: Damn straight. If you don't like what I'm saying, you just come out and tell me.",
        "Dorian: Ok, I really didn't enjoy the fact that you practically presented me with a list of requirements for our relationship.",
        "Clint: No, I didn't have a list of requirements or rules or anything per se. I -- I just thought that, you know, you could avoid an awful lot of grief by keeping away from certain subjects.",
        "Dorian: Ah, such as?",
        "Clint: Viki, and my family.",
        "Dorian: Oh. And will they do the same for me?",
        "Clint: Oh, not likely, but then again, that's their business. I'm just saying that I want you to stay out of trouble. And try, just for a change of pace, to turn the other cheek.",
        "Dorian: Ooh. And what would be in it for me?",
        "Clint: Well, you would know that you'd be doing it for me, and that I'd appreciate it an awful lot.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'd be doing it for you? Oh, in that case, I will try. I really will.",
        "Clint: Well, I can't ask for anything more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, isn't this nice?",
        "Douglas: You see what happens when you lower your prohibitions?",
        "Viki: I don't know what that means.",

        "Nora: Thank God.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. It was an older couple. They were pretty shaken up.",
        "Nora: No. Shaken up is when you lose your luggage flying home, not when your house burns down around you, or you almost lose a loved one in the flames.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, I know, Nora. My -- I almost lost my wife.",
        "Nora: Get him. Go get the bastard and bring him to me, and I promise you, I will put him away.",

        "Jessica: Ok, ok, ok. Calm down. Look at me. Look at me. Nash is the father of my baby, Cristian, and I'm not going to apologize to you every time you see us talking to one another, ok, so just calm down.",
        "Cristian: Look, Jessica, I'm not stupid. I know the two of you were not just talking about the weather, or your daughter.",
        "Jessica: It's none of your damn business what we're talking about, Cristian. Ok?",
        "Cristian: I'm watching you.",
        "Nash: You sure that was such a good idea, pushing him like that?",

        "Todd: No, miles was really hesitant to give it to me. He felt he had no choice.",
        "Blair: What -- who cares about his motivation, Todd? You know, Spencer has been trying to hurt you, and that's all he's ever tried to do.",
        "Evangeline: What exactly are we talking about here?",
        "Blair: It's a bunch of numbers.",
        "Todd: I had to break them.",

        "Todd: Yeah. Those first three, area code. The last five, zip code.",
        "Blair: Just a bunch of numbers to make you crazy, Todd.",
        "Evangeline: No, no, no. That zip code -- it's in Chicago.",
        "Todd: Yeah, and the area code's Chicago, so I think the baby's in Chicago.",

        "Bo: Who? Women.",
        "Rex: Huh?",
        "Bo: Oh, look, I don't claim to any kind of knowledge with this kind of thing, but obviously, Adriana thinks enough of you to hire you to sell her stuff.",

        "Rex: Yeah, no, I should -- yeah, I should hope not. Thanks for that.",
        "Bo: Look, I want you to relax, Balsom, because whatever you decide that you're going to do, you make up your mind to do it and you do it. The only thing you have to worry about with Adriana is not doing too much and screwing it up.",

        "Natalie: Hmm. Well, loving John McBain was a lot of work.",

        "Dorian: Oh, really? Is that why you were begging him to take you back, right here in this very restaurant just a few nights ago, smack in the middle of his date with me?",

That every time I see you, you turn my world upside down, and the second that I get a little bit of peace of mind, you show up again and confuse everything. And you won't leave. You just won't leave.
