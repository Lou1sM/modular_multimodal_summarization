        "Rex: What do you mean you have no choice? Is somebody pressuring you?",
        "Gigi: You, you -- you're pressuring me.",
        "Rex: Yeah, because I love you. You're the mother of my child. I want to marry you.",
        "Gigi: But I can't. I'm sorry. It's -- it's over. Please just accept it.",
        "Roxy: Accept what?",
        "Gigi: We broke up.",
        "Roxy: Why?",
        "Rex: Don't look at me.",
        "Gigi: It's complicated.",
        "Rex: Actually, it's pretty simple. She slept with Brody.",
        "Roxy: I can't believe it. That's impossible.",
        "Kyle: Stacy, you're not a match for Shane. I did the test myself.",
        "Stacy: No offense, I was afraid it might not be accurate, so I had the test done somewhere else.",
        "Kyle: No, the mix-up with the Buchanan's -- that was the computer, not me.",
        "Stacy: But you can understand why I would be so concerned, right?",
        "Kyle: No. The point is I know my results are accurate, okay? I don't want to give the family false hope. If you want, I can run the test again --",
        "Stacy: No, no, no, no. I can't do that.",
        "Charlie: Oh, hey son. Viki and Jessica brought Bree over to preschool. They asked me to look after Chloe. Man, these things are great. I wish we had them when you were a kid. Aw, isn't that that little music box you gave her? She just loves that. That baby has really brought a lot of joy into this house.",
        "Jared: Don't say that.",
        "Charlie: Why not?",
        "Natalie: Are you at peace, baby? How can you be? You don't even have the right name on your headstone.",
        "Marcie: Natalie?",
        "Oliver: You were right. Rosen was released, like, three months ago, but not from Statesville. He had been transferred to downstate a few years ago.",
        "John: Maximum security.",
        "Oliver: Apparently, he hadn't been a good boy.",
        "Marty: What's he been doing?",
        "Oliver: Trying to get good credit. He bought a bus ticket to llanview the last week of January. He used a new credit card.",
        "Marty: So he's been here two months.",
        "John: Long enough to be responsible for the murders.",
        "Marty: But if Zach was in prison, he wouldn't even know lee or Wes. Why would he go after them?",
        "John: I want to know every move that Rosen has made since he hit town.",
        "Marty: Yeah, like where he is right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Zach.",
        "Zach: Hey buddy. Long time, no see. I like the new face. Who did the work?",
        "Todd: What, did you break out?",
        "Zach: Nope. Unlike you, I served my full sentence. Oh, not to worry. Time flies when you're having fun. But you knew about that, didn't you? See, I've been keeping tabs on you just like you've been keeping tabs on me.",
        "Todd: What do you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Put -- put your top on.",
        "Starr: Why? Why?",
        "Schuyler: Oh hey, whoa. Starr, do I have to call your parents?",
        "Starr: What? My mom is in the hospital. My dad doesn't have custody anymore. He has no say in what I do.",
        "Schuyler: I am not having sex with you.",
        "Starr: Well, you want to, right? I really think -- I think you do.",
        "Schuyler: You're just a kid.",
        "Starr: You have no idea, okay? I have been through more this year than people go through in their entire lifetime. It grows someone up. Go ahead. Tell me that you don't want me and I'll leave.",
        "Cole: Mr. J., Open up.",
        "Starr: It's Cole.",
        "Cole: Mr. J.?",
        "Schuyler: Did he follow you?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Schuyler: Well how does he know you're here?",
        "Starr: I don't know. He doesn't.",
        "Cole: Open the damn door.",
        "Schuyler: Shhh.",
        "Starr: Okay --",
        "Cole: I know you're in there. I can see the lights on.",
        "Starr: You know what? Maybe he'll just go away.",
        "Cole: If you don't open the door, I'm going to kick it in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Look, all I know is that Rosen was released. He hung out for a little while, maybe putting some money together, and then he came here. What he did when he got here --",
        "John: Check every motel, boarding house, trailer park in Llanview, all right? He's going to need a place to crash, and he probably doesn't have a lot of money.",
        "Oliver: And what about his family?",
        "John: Well, they apparently turned their back on him when he got sent up. They moved away.",
        "Marty: You really think he's the killer?",
        "John: Let's think about it. He gets out of prison. He buys a bus ticket to Llanview. Suddenly, we've got three victims, each one tagged with a letter from his old fraternity.",
        "Marty: Okay, but explain this to me. Why would he go after people he doesn't know? Why not go after me? It was my testimony that put him in prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: It seems like just yesterday, huh? You, me, and Powell raising hell at Kappa Alpha Delta. Those were the days.",
        "Todd: You think?",
        "Zach: Oh, we were young, Todd. We had our whole lives ahead of us. I was going to be a doctor, you were going to make that first million by the time you were 30. And look at that, your dream came true. Mine not so much. Oh hey, hey. I just want to talk to you. It's been a long time. And the truth is, you know, I've had my fill of security guards, and prison cells, and strip searches, cold showers, and bad food --",
        "Todd: I asked you what you want.",
        "Zach: You know prison teaches you, Todd? Patience. That and the ability to do whatever it takes to survive. You see, Powell had the luxury of going crazy. I mean, he always was a fifth short of a case, that guy. And you did your good works in prison and walked. But I spent the best years of my life behind bars. And now I need your help, buddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Okay, then just give me the name of the tech at the facility. What was it? Llanview scan?",
        "Stacy: [Laughs] Don't worry. I'm not going to get you in trouble for blowing the test.",
        "Kyle: Okay, I did not blow the test.",
        "Stacy: Ooh, ooh. They told me to stay hydrated. I've got to run to the ladies' room. Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Okay, Gigi. You and me, ladies' room, right now.",
        "Gigi: Just leave it alone.",
        "Roxy: And let you walk out on the best thing that ever happened to you? Not a chance. Not when that little boy of yours is lying in his room, sick as a dog.",
        "Gigi: He's going to get better.",
        "Roxy: How? Little miss outback backed out.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, Roxy. We should have told you right away. We found another donor.",
        "Roxy: All right. That's what I want to hear. Who is it?",
        "Stacy: Me. I'm the donor.",
        "Roxy: Oh, I see. So this is your doing.",
        "Stacy: That's right. I'm going to save Shane's life.",
        "Stacy: It's a miracle I'm a match. Thank God that I was here. Can you imagine if I was in Vegas?",
        "Roxy: Right where you belong.",
        "Rex: Roxy.",
        "Stacy: It's okay. We don't have to get along. We just have to understand, I would do anything for my family. Anything.",
        "Rex: So, I've been going over what needs to happen. Now, you have to be admitted, they have to do all kinds of tests, I need to set you up with Shane's doctor --",
        "Stacy: Oh no, I can take care of all of that. You got enough on your plate. So is Shane thrilled?",
        "Rex: He's been sleeping. We haven't told him yet. Well let's go tell him. Come on.",
        "Gigi: He's my son.",
        "Rex: He's our son. And you may want to cut me out of your life, but I'm still Shane's father.",
        "Rex: Thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing this for Shane.",
        "Stacy: I would do anything for that little boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Do you want coffee?",
        "Charlie: Okay, sure. Come on, what's going on?",
        "Jared: What do you mean?",
        "Charlie: Something has got you all tied up in a knot at a time in your life when you should be feeling pretty happy. You know you can trust me.",
        "Jared: Okay. Dad, what if you knew something that could change a whole lot of people's lives.",
        "Charlie: What are you saying -- you've got another secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: What are you doing here?",
        "Natalie: I just came by to see the baby and say a prayer for her.",
        "Marcie: Oh, thank you.",
        "Natalie: Are those yours? Did you leave those here?",
        "Marcie: Oh, yeah. I used to come every day. Now it's more like once a week.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: No, it's not your fault. I mean, everybody keeps telling me it's going to get better. And it has, in a way. I used to have this same dream every night that Hope hadn't died. She was healthy and she was happy and we were together. Then I wake up, of course, and I have to face another day without her. And I still do have that same dream, but at least it's not every night anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Well, maybe we should put a detail on her.",
        "Marty: I'm not going to do anything stupid, but I don't want a cop following me around. I've got a son in rehab. I don't want to upset him anymore than he already is. And like I told John, if Zach wanted me dead, he had the perfect opportunity. When he killed Wes, I was lying right next to him.",
        "John: I don't think you're the target.",
        "Marty: And we don't even know if it's Zach, right? He's just the -- what do you guys call it?",
        "John: He's a person of interest. It seems to me that whoever is responsible is trying to send a message to anyone around you.",
        "Marty: What kind of message? And to who? I mean, I knew all the victims, but so did Todd, right? Lee worked for him, Wes was his rival, so to speak, and Blair is his ex-wife --",
        "Oliver: And now she's John's wife.",
        "John: Yeah, thanks Fish. Look, Manning's the one that instigated the rape, right? He was the ringleader. And when he goes to jail he finds religion and supposedly he saves you from a crash.",
        "Marty: Yeah, the governor pardoned him and commuted his sentence.",
        "John: Okay, all of this could have made Rosen very, very unhappy.",
        "Marty: So, what, Todd's on the list now? Do we warn him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It's not like you took the rap for me. I did my time, too.",
        "Zach: Oh, how much time? A minute and a half? You got yourself pardoned and walked out of there without one thought for me.",
        "Todd: I see. So it's my fault that you didn't get pardoned?",
        "Zach: It's your fault I got convicted. I didn't want to rape that girl. You were the one who wanted to get even with her.",
        "Todd: Right, I held a gun to your head.",
        "Zach: [Scoffs] Powell and me, we would have done anything you said back then. You were the top dog, the alpha male, the big football hero. I was going to be a doctor, man. But I did what you said and I took the hit. And now, I need a break, man. And I have to say, you owe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: If you don't open the door I swear I'll kick it in.",
        "Schuyler: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What the hell is going on?",
        "Cole: Where is she? Where is she?",
        "Schuyler: You are supposed to be at rehab.",
        "Cole: You son of a bitch, you swore there was nothing going on.",
        "Schuyler: All right, I don't know what's gotten you all riled up, Cole, but I was taking a shower.",
        "Cole: I answered your phone at the center. It was Starr. She thought I was you.",
        "Schuyler: Look, Cole, I don't know what to tell you.",
        "Cole: Yeah? Are you sleeping with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Anyone connected to Rosen should be notified. Have you had a chance to check the frat yet?",
        "Oliver: Not yet. I'm -- I'm a Kappa Delt. I rushed the year they got their charter back so we really tried to improve its image. What I'm trying to say is that not all guys there are like Rosen. I actually ran into a Kappa Delt this morning and he's actually in med school now.",
        "Marty: Rosen was pre-med.",
        "John: Look, Fish, our only interest in the frat is the part it plays in this case.",
        "Marty: And if -- if Zach is the killer, then maybe he's done, right? Three letters, three victims. He's probably long gone. Wishful thinking, I know.",
        "John: From our experience, freaks who kill and leave letters on people, they're never really done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What is it you want from me, Zach?",
        "Zach: Oh, I haven't figured that out. Not yet, anyway. So, how's Marty?",
        "Todd: Marty?",
        "Zach: Marty Saybrooke? The girl who got us sent up? I hear you kept in touch. You holed up with her in a mansion you bought with all the money you inherited. Talk about memory lane. Oh, that must have been something. Marty not remembering who you were. I can't believe you still have a thing for Marty Saybrooke. Well, you really ought to get over that, because all of her friends seem to be getting stabbed. Let's see, there's her nurse, and then that biker boy, and then your ex-wife -- well she can't really be classified as a friend. She's more of a rival, right? Well, that is if she recovers.",
        "Todd: You seem to know all about this.",
        "Zach: Just what I read in the papers. Is it true that the cops think you did it?",
        "Todd: Is that the reason you're here?",
        "Zach: What? To help my old buddy in his time of need?",
        "Todd: Did you kill those people, Zach? Lee and Wes? Did you stab my wife?",
        "Zach: Uh, ex-wife.",
        "Todd: I asked you a question.",
        "Zach: And you know the answer to that, Todd. We both do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I'm not sleeping with Starr, Cole, and I never have.",
        "Cole: But if it happened it would be her fault, right? Like the kiss? Like the kiss? Because she just threw herself at you, right?",
        "Schuyler: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is this? What is this right now? All this anger. You're going through withdrawal, Cole, and I say we call your counselor.",
        "Cole: Hey, no, no, no. You don't make this about me. I know you've been seeing her.",
        "Schuyler: Cole, I'm living with someone right now. I'm not involved with Starr.",
        "Cole: It wouldn't be the first time someone cheated.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, I don't want to offend you because I know how much you care about Starr, and she's a great kid, she really is a great kid, but she's just a kid. I'm not interested.",
        "Cole: Starr turns to you because she thinks you'll understand.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, I do understand.",
        "Cole: No you don't! You don't understand! You -- you used her. You used her. You used her need to talk to somebody, anybody but me. I couldn't help her, so she turned to you and you took advantage. You -- you and your mom ruined our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You dream about Starr's baby still being alive?",
        "Marcie: Sometimes. I know that she's gone, Natalie. I do, and I'm learning to live with that. But yeah, I still get up on some days and I think she's going to be in that crib. And on those days, Michael has been just wonderful.",
        "Natalie: Michael? He's back? You two --",
        "Marcie: We're together. It's funny, you know, all those plans I had to adopt Starr's baby, and it drove us apart. Losing her brought us back together again.",
        "Natalie: You know, Marcie, I'm really glad that something good happened for you out of all of this.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well then I realized that I'm really very lucky, you know? I'm healthy. I have a wonderful husband. I have great friends. I still have a good life.",
        "Natalie: That's great.",
        "Marcie: When I saw Jessica the other day, it made me think about how much she must be going through the same things.",
        "Natalie: What do you mean?",
        "Marcie: Well, she's trying to accept the loss of her husband and I imagine that Chloe and Bree are doing for her what Michael has done for me. When I saw her with that baby -- just having that child, it has just brought her back to life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Do that again. I'll tell Rex just who you got stashed in that clinic.",
        "Roxy: You're blackmailing Gigi. You're forcing her to break my son's heart.",
        "Stacy: Oh, he'll survive. I'll make sure of that.",
        "Roxy: So just what did you tell her? That you would donate your bone marrow if she gave Rex the boot?",
        "Roxy: Wow, I'm surprised. I thought that peroxide had eaten through your brain.",
        "Roxy: You are such an evil bitch.",
        "Stacy: And you are a coward. None of this would have happened if you had the guts to tell Rex the truth.",
        "Roxy: I was afraid to hurt him. Apparently you're not afraid to hurt anyone. You don't care about anybody.",
        "Stacy: Gigi has got her kid, that's all she really cares about anyway.",
        "Roxy: You know, I think you're the one that's stupid. They're a family, and you think that you can separate them, but you're not going to stop them from loving each other.",
        "Stacy: We'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, remember we agreed not to tell him that we've broken up until after he's had the transplant.",
        "Rex: No problem. I'll just pretend you didn't cheat on me and that you don't want out. I'm doing this for Shane, not you. Hey, champ!",
        "Gigi: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Shane: You can drop the act. I know.",
        "Shane: Aunt Stacy told me.",
        "Gigi: Told you what?",
        "Shane: The bone marrow lady from Australia bagged, so there's no match.",
        "Gigi: Stacy told you that?",
        "Shane: It's not her fault. I made her tell me. But I'm glad she did. At least someone treats me like I have a brain.",
        "Gigi: It's true, honey. The lady from Australia can't do it, but guess what? We found somebody else.",
        "Shane: There's another match? Really?",
        "Rex: 100%.",
        "Shane: But what if this one bags, too?",
        "Rex: Not going to happen. This person is right here in Llanview.",
        "Shane: Well, who is it?",
        "Rex: You won't believe it -- your Aunt Stacy.",
        "Shane: Aunt Stacy's a match?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and she's not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Okay, I got it now. I see why you were dragging your heels. You were just waiting for Gigi to give Rex his walking papers.",
        "Stacy: I told you I'd come forward in time, and I did.",
        "Roxy: You're not even a match. Unfortunately, that lowlife that I happen to have a son with is.",
        "Stacy: And I'm happy to play along with this as long as you keep your mouth shut.",
        "Roxy: How could you do this to your own sister?",
        "Stacy: How could she do what she did to me? I was in love with Rex and she took him from me.",
        "Roxy: Rex doesn't even know you're alive.",
        "Stacy: That's just because he's worried about Shane. Once he's on the mend, he'll have nothing to do but concentrate on showing me how grateful he is.",
        "Roxy: And you would settle for that?",
        "Stacy: Oh, he'll fall in love with me. Just watch.",
        "Roxy: Hey, listen, genius. How you are going to make that bone marrow look like it came out of you?",
        "Kyle: Stacy, I'm glad I found you. I have the results from your swab right here. I'm sorry, there's no way you're a match. But your friend, John Doe -- he was a perfect match, but he never came forward. And now you're trying to come across like you're a match, and you're not. Is there something you guys want to tell me?",
        "Stacy: You're about to help us save my nephew's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Look, you know, the last time you tried to keep a secret, things did not go very well. I mean, Jessica lost Nash, the Buchanans lost their company, I lost Viki.",
        "Jared: Look, Dad, calm down, okay? This is nothing like that.",
        "Charlie: Well --",
        "Jared: For starters, it's not even my secret.",
        "Charlie: Well, then, what is the problem?",
        "Jared: If it got out, it could do a lot of damage.",
        "Charlie: What, are we back to Nash?",
        "Jared: No, no, no, that was different. That was for my own selfish reasons. This is -- look, there's got to be situations that it's better to keep your mouth shut.",
        "Charlie: What kind of situations?",
        "Jared: You know what I mean.",
        "Charlie: What? You mean like if you know that somebody's cheating on their spouse, you might as well stay out of it? I mean, is that what you're talking about? You know about somebody who's catting around?",
        "Jared: No, no, no, no. This is a whole other ballpark.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Jess seems better.",
        "Natalie: She is. There's going to be a christening. She asked Jared and me to be the godparents.",
        "Marcie: That's great! You know you were the best godmother in the world to Tommy.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: I saw him the other day. Oh, God, he's gotten so big. He talks in sentences, full sentences. When I gave him back, all he could say was \"mama.\"",
        "Natalie: I know that time was really hard for you.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, it was. I guess it seems I'm just not meant to be a mother. So, are you going to do it?",
        "Natalie: Do what?",
        "Marcie: Be Chloe's godmother.",
        "Natalie: Oh, you know, I don't know. Jared and me, we're just talking about it. You know, it's just a tough situation with everything that happened last summer.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well, I know that you'd be wonderful, and I know that you would always do right by that child.",
        "Natalie: I'm sure trying to.",

        "Schuyler: Look, Cole, I've got to tell you, man. I've only been teaching for a couple of years, and I've never encountered a situation like this. And maybe -- maybe my guilt over my mother about not doing what I could to help her -- maybe I'm letting myself get too involved in Starr's grief. Okay, fine, but I promise you, I have never slept with her, and I never will.",
        "Cole: Don't make me tell you this again. You stay away from Starr.",
        "Starr: I heard what you said. What you said to Cole about me? You're lying. I feel it and you feel it. There's no point in denying it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Look, son, I don't know what's eating you, and I don't want to know. But you've got to make a decision here, because until you do, this thing's going to be tearing you apart.",
        "Jared: How do I make that decision?",
        "[Charlie laughs]",
        "Charlie: We both know that I was never a role model for good decision making most of my life, so -- all I can tell you is what the program says. Keep it simple. Do the greatest good for the greatest number of people.",

        "Charlie: Duty calls.",

        "Starr: No.",
        "Schuyler: No, grief over my mother, grief over your baby -- we share grief.",
        "Starr: No, it's more than that. That's why you hid me, to protect me.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, do you want Cole to see you like this, with your pants unzipped and your shirt off?",
        "Starr: No, please stop. Cole cannot be a part of this. Cole has to get over it. He has to.",
        "Schuyler: I can't believe he answered my cell phone. What are you calling me for, Starr? What are you thinking?",
        "Starr: No, I had to see you. I had to see you.",
        "Schuyler: Well, you can't. You can't see me, I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: Why not? I think about you. I think about you all the time. And you -- you have feelings for me, right? I know that you do.",
        "Schuyler: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I misled you. There's nothing between us. There can't be. I care about you as a student. I care about you as a friend. But you and I can never be involved. We're not going to be involved.",
        "Starr: Look, I know that this all started because your mom was my doctor, but it's more than that. And I know that you were my teacher and I was your student, and that was wrong. I completely agree. But now, you're not working there anymore.",
        "Schuyler: Starr, do you know what happens when a grown man hooks up with a young, teenaged girl who used to be his student?",
        "Starr: I would really like to find out.",
        "Schuyler: No, no! That's wrong. She loses -- she's a loser.",
        "Starr: But you would never do something like that to me, right? Right?",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay, you've got to face reality, all right? I'm living with someone that I care very much about and I don't want you.",

        "John: You okay?",
        "Marty: I don't really know. My past is what's driving all this, only I'm the only one not getting hurt.",
        "John: Oh, I think you've been hurt.",
        "Marty: What exactly would you say Zach Rosen's motive would be?",
        "John: It's possible he's trying to set Manning up. Rosen did hard time. Manning got off easy. If Rosen thinks he can frame Todd for multiple murders --",
        "Marty: He'll go away for a long time. But you don't believe that, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Murdering people I don't even know -- well, that's a one-way ticket back to prison. Why would I do that?",
        "Todd: Maybe you're crazy.",
        "Zach: No, that's Powell.",
        "Todd: Why don't you just tell me what you want, Zach? I really don't have time for this.",
        "Zach: Hey, did I mention that when I was released, I had nothing but the clothes they issued me? Oh, they found me a job washing dishes, but the pay fell just a little short of what I would have made as a doctor. And in these tough economic times, minimum wage jobs just don't pay the bills, Todd. So I figured my good old buddy would want to help a friend.",
        "Todd: How much?",
        "Zach: I was thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 million",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You're right, I'm not the match -- I'm just claiming to be the one to save Shane's life. Look, Shane's parents hate the person we know as John Doe. They would never allow that person to donate.",
        "Kyle: So they'd just rather watch their son die?",
        "Stacy: My sister's an optimist. She'd be insisting that another donor would come along until it was too late for Shane.",
        "Kyle: That's crazy.",
        "Roxy: If you really knew John Doe, you'd get it.",
        "Stacy: So you see why it makes it easier for us to say I'm the donor.",
        "Kyle: Okay, people donate anonymously all the time. I mean, we could just say that this John Doe likes his privacy.",
        "Roxy: So you can do that?",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I'm sure we could work something out.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, that might work if it weren't for the fact that Shane's father is a private eye, a good one. He would insist on finding out who this donor was. You don't want to delay Shane's treatment, do you?",
        "[Kyle sighs]",
        "Kyle: No. Of course not.",
        "Stacy: So you're going to help us?",
        "Kyle: Help you how?",
        "Stacy: Go to the clinic where John Doe's resting. Do whatever you have to do to get his bone marrow. I'll be admitted and then you can just say the bone marrow came from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I don't like to nail things down too soon. You miss things when you do that.",
        "Marty: But Rosen's your prime suspect.",
        "John: The department thinks so and they're on it now. Me, I have to go pick up Sam at preschool.",
        "Marty: Ah, I forgot you're a daddy now.",
        "John: You know what? Do me a favor. Keep your eyes open. I know you don't remember him.",
        "Marty: No, I remember what he looks like. I've read all the news articles about the trial.",
        "John: It's been a long time. You may not have changed, but he has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: So why don't we go over to the bank?",
        "Todd: Why don't you just go to hell? I'm giving you nothing. You were convicted. You served your time. And that's it -- you're done. Me, I may have gotten out early, but if you think I haven't paid for what we did, you're wrong. I'm still paying. So don't come here looking for pity or guilt or whatever it is you think you're going to find. I owe you nothing! Now you get the hell out of here before I do have you thrown out.",
        "Zach: Whatever you say, Todd, like always.",
        "Zach: This isn't over, Manning.",

        "Natalie: So I ran into Marcie, and she's doing a lot better. She and Michael got back together.",
        "Jared: Oh, that's great.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I think that she's made peace with losing the baby.",
        "Jared: And if Jessica loses Chloe now, she might not survive.",
        "Natalie: She could fall apart, literally.",
        "Jared: And Bree would lose her mother.",
        "Jared: What is the greatest good for the greatest number of people?",
        "Natalie: I just keep thinking, you know, Starr was too young to have a baby. She was giving her up for adoption, and now that Marcie seems to be making peace with her loss --",
        "Jared: So we do nothing?",
        "Natalie: Jared, what good would it do, to tell the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: None of this would have happened if you hadn't died. I would give anything for you to be alive, and for Starr to be happy. I think -- I think that's why she's -- you know, at least we would have had a chance, but now we don't. It's gone too far.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You're studying to be a doctor, right? You'll have to take that oath, \"first, do no harm.\"",
        "Kyle: You've been watching too many doctor shows.",
        "Roxy: You know, that kid in there could die.",
        "Stacy: You want that on your conscience?",

        "Shane: That's so sick. Aunt Stacy's a match. She has to be the coolest person on the whole planet, and she's doing this for me.",

        "Kyle: This patient, whoever he is -- he's going to need a full work-up. It's not enough that he's just a match.",
        "Roxy: So work him up.",
        "Stacy: Do whatever you have to. Just save my nephew.",
        "Kyle: Okay, if he's a good candidate, and if he's a match, because I have to retest him -- I'll do it.",
        "Roxy: You will?",
        "Kyle: But nobody can know.",
        "Stacy: Don't worry. It'll be our little secret.",
        "Kyle: All right, I guess you better take me to meet this John Doe.",
