        "Dorian wants to deny her interest in Ray and have him believe that she prefers David when she's afraid that maybe he prefers Tea. David calls and asks her to see his new commercial. She has Ray watch it assuming they'll see an impressive presentation. But David shows that he's a spokesman for a hemorrhoid commercial. When Ray sees that she's humiliated as well as hurt that it's more important to David than she is, he surprises her by appearing sensitive and he kisses her. Stacy knows she has to make everybody believe that she is donating her own bone marrow for Shane. So she goes with Michael to the exam room. But he tells her all of the things she has to undergo in order to donate the bone marrow. And she is afraid. Yet, she has the fantasy about winning Rex over. Rex and Gigi are having serious problems when he overhears her talking to Brody and being very gracious. He asks her why she is so angry at Stacy having no clue what Stacy did. Matthew comes home and is not ok with the welcoming party now that he's confined to a wheelchair. His friend, Destiny asks her brother Shawn (Dorian's' body guard) to come with her to Matthew's party. But he reveals he has some issues with Matthew's family."

        "Clint: I tried talking with her.",
        "Viki: And how did that go?",
        "Clint: She's still shutting me out of the Matthew situation and I don't know why.",
        "Charlie: The place looks great.",
        "Clint: I hope the party is the right idea.",
        "Renee: Oh, Clint, Matthew will love it.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I'm with Renee. It's really very nice.",
        "Clint: It's all I could think of to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: It's so good to see both of you. Mr. Buchanan will be delighted you could make it.",
        "Jared: Thank you. Is everyone here already?",
        "Nigel: Everyone except the guest of honor.",
        "Natalie: I didn't see Jessica's car.",
        "Nigel: Oh, she had a prior engagement. But she assured me she would be here. Why don't you go ahead and join the others in the living room? I need to check on the corn dogs.",
        "Jared: Corn dogs, yeah.",
        "Nigel: Matthew's favorite food.",
        "Jared: Why are you checking on Jessica?",
        "Natalie: I'm not checking up on her. I was just, you know, making sure she's okay. I guess that's checking up on her.",
        "Jared: But why? We did decide that we shouldn't tell Jess that her baby's dead, right? Tell me you haven't changed your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey, honey, did you have a good time, huh? Look, your baby sister's conked out. You know what? You were a rock star on that balance beam. And your mommy got to work out some of her frustrations.",
        "Brody: Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Brody, hi.",
        "Brody: Got the girls lifting already?",
        "Jessica: Uh, it's a gym class for moms and kids.",
        "Brody: Can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Jessica: Actually we have to be somewhere.",
        "Brody: This won't take long. I want to explain what's going on between me and Gigi Morasco.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: I can't believe it. I'm going to be okay. Everything's cool.",
        "Gigi: Yup, everything's cool.",
        "Shane: Okay, what's going on?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Gigi: Come in.",
        "Stacy: Hey, Shane. Did you hear the good news?",
        "Shane: Mom and Dad just told me.",
        "Stacy: It's pretty awesome we have matching bone marrow, right?",
        "Shane: It's better than awesome. You're going to save my life.",
        "Stacy: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I'm still not sure I should be doing this.",
        "Roxy: What are you talking about?",
        "Kyle: You never told me this patient was in a long-term care facility or even if they're healthy enough for this procedure.",
        "Roxy: Believe me, this one can take it. You told me that you were going to help me.",
        "Kyle: You really want me to pass this guy's bone marrow off as your friend Stacy Morasco?",
        "Roxy: Stacy Morasco is no friend. And neither is this John Doe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't want to spend the rest of my life watching my sister raise a baby that isn't hers.",
        "Jared: Isn't that better than watching her bury a baby that is?",
        "Natalie: What about Chloe? Growing up and never knowing who she really is -- I know what that's like.",
        "Jared: She gets a mother who loves her. Isn't that what you wanted?",
        "Natalie: I wanted the truth.",
        "Jared: Only because you found out about the lie.",
        "Natalie: So could Chloe.",
        "Jared: How? We're the only people that know the truth.",
        "Natalie: Secrets never seem to stay secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You don't owe me any explanation.",
        "Brody: No, I want to explain. Listen, when you told me you wanted to be more than friends --",
        "Jessica: Can we just forget about that, please?",
        "Brody: It's the best news that I've heard in years.",
        "Jessica: I don't understand.",
        "Brody: I was on my way to tell you the same thing.",
        "Jessica: Wait. What?",
        "Brody: I even talked it out with Dr. Levin. You know, he said it was all right for me to think about being with someone. And I want to do that -- with you. I'm crazy about you, so to speak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Corn dog, sir?",
        "Clint: Uh, no thank you, Nigel. But they look perfect.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart. Jessie told me that she asked you and Jared to be godparents to Chloe.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, she did.",
        "Viki: I think it's wonderful. I'm so happy that you two have forgiven each other.",
        "Natalie: She's my sister, and I love her. But we haven't accepted yet.",
        "Viki: Why not? Renee: Pssst, they're here.",

        "Destiny: It's lunch.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Darling -- you're coming home.",
        "David: It's not that. My heart may still be in Llanview, but the rest of me is out here in LA.",
        "Dorian: Then how am I going to see you?",
        "David: I booked a national commercial. It airs in a few minutes.",
        "Dorian: Why, that's fantastic.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: So why didn't you tell me?",
        "David: I wanted it to be a surprise. I know how you love surprises.",
        "Dorian: So what will you be advertising? Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait, don't tell me. You look wonderful in a tuxedo, so you'll be standing beside an expensive hybrid car and demonstrating all that horsepower.",
        "David: Oh, you'll know soon enough. It's coming on in just a couple of minutes.",
        "Dorian: I'll turn on the TV right now.",
        "David: Oh, and pop some champagne. I've got some right here. It will almost be as if we're together again.",
        "Dorian: Sounds wonderful. But I hope you know that in my heart we are always together. Grand bisou. A bientot, cherie.",
        "Ray: Was that good news?",
        "Dorian: Oh, wonderful news, wonderful. My husband is going to be on television. His acting career is skyrocketing.",
        "Ray: Wow. What show will he be on?",
        "Dorian: Why don't you watch it with me? You can see for yourself how marvelous he is.",
        "Ray: Okay, now is that you playing the married woman? Or is that you asking me on a date?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So you were on your way to tell me you were crazy about me and you ran into Gigi?",
        "Brody: I know it's hard to believe but I -- I --",
        "Jessica: What? And you just thought you'd give her one more chance?",
        "Brody: This isn't about Gigi and me. This is all about Shane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: We'll be just like blood brothers.",
        "Stacy: We'll be even cooler than that.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you'll be marrow siblings.",
        "[Stacy giggles]",
        "Stacy: Hey, I'm sorry it took so long for me to get all my test results straightened out.",
        "Gigi: Better late than never.",
        "Rex: It's all good now.",
        "Stacy: You're right. It is all good now.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rex: Come in.",
        "Michael: Hey, did I hear somebody in here's looking to get rid of some bone marrow?",
        "Shane: That would be my Aunt Stacy.",
        "Michael: All right. So, Aunt Stacy, are you ready to get started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: This John Doe is some piece of work.",
        "Roxy: You don't know the half of it.",
        "Kyle: I mean, your grandson's parents would really refuse this guy's bone marrow?",
        "Roxy: What, am I speaking spumoni here?",
        "Kyle: It's just -- I mean, if the bone marrow's going to save their son's life, who cares where it comes from?",
        "Roxy: My son does. He doesn't even know this John Doe is alive, and hopefully he never will.",
        "Kyle: What's your relationship to John Doe?",
        "Roxy: What do you need to know that for?",
        "Kyle: Are you even authorized to make this decision? Because if you're not, I'm not going to do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What do you mean? Get what started?",
        "Michael: I've got an exam room with your name written all over it.",
        "Gigi: You're going to do the transplant now?",
        "Michael: No, I need to give Stacy a series of injections first, but --",
        "Rex: This will get the ball rolling.",
        "Michael: Yeah, and the sooner the better. So if you'll come with me.",
        "Stacy: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Gigi cheated on Rex because her son's sick? And you just went along with this?",
        "Brody: I know it sounds crazy.",
        "Jessica: You know, it doesn't. It doesn't. It's none of my business.",
        "Brody: Yes, it is. And I wish I could tell you everything, but I promised Gigi.",
        "Jessica: I understand.",
        "Brody: I don't know how you could. Jessica --",
        "Jessica: Maybe -- it's better nothing happened between the two of us. You know, that way no one gets hurt. Time to go, Bree.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I can't get the injections done now.",
        "Michael: Why not?",
        "Stacy: Well, you see, it's just that I have an appointment at another hospital, so --",
        "Rex: Why do you want to do that?",
        "Michael: Everything's all set up here.",
        "Stacy: No, you don't understand. I can't have it done here.",
        "Gigi: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So you want to know my relationship to John Doe.",
        "Kyle: Usually only a family member can authorize a procedure like this.",
        "Roxy: I'm the closest thing that pig has to a living relative.",
        "Kyle: So you have power of attorney then?",
        "Roxy: Honey, I got power of Roxy. I make the decisions. Come on, we're taking all day on this.",
        "Kyle: You know I'm not extracting anything, right?",
        "Roxy: What?",
        "Kyle: I'm just retesting him and prepping him for the procedure.",
        "Roxy: All right, well go. Do whatever you need to do. But when you get what you need, say it belongs to that slut Stacy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Look, I can't have the injections done here. I don't have health insurance. I haven't been working, you know.",
        "Rex: Do not worry about the money. I will find a way to pay for it.",
        "Michael: Actually, a lot of people who tested for Shane made donations, so --",
        "Gigi: You mean to pay for his medical bills?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Rex: People we don't even know?",
        "Michael: Yeah. So you don't have to worry about it. Money's not going to be an issue.",
        "Shane: Hey, if there's any left over, can I get a new Z-box game?",
        "Gigi and Rex: [Together] No.",
        "Michael: So, Aunt Stacy, what do you say we get this show on the road?",
        "Shane: Yeah, let's do this.",
        "[Stacy sighs]",
        "Gigi: Can you wait a minute, Michael?",
        "Michael: Absolutely. But is everything all right?",
        "Gigi: I need to talk to my sister in the hallway, alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You really enjoy flattering yourself, don't you?",
        "Ray: It was a simple question.",
        "Dorian: All right, then I'll give you a simple answer. No. I'm not asking you out on a date. I just want you to observe for yourself how colossal my husband's talent is.",
        "Ray: Ah, well, I'm glad we cleared that up.",
        "Dorian: Of course if you have other things to do -- T\u00e9a, perhaps?",
        "Ray: Actually, T\u00e9a is working.",
        "Dorian: Whatever. I know that you need her to get over the pain of my rejection.",
        "Ray: Who's flattering herself now?",
        "Dorian: And who is strutting around here like a peacock? I love my husband. And when you see his commercial, you will see why I adore that handsome, exciting, talented man.",
        "Ray: When you put it that way, Dr. Buchanan, how can I resist? Besides, I think it's time for me to judge for myself that this man is truly worthy of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: What's going on? Dad, Mom?",
        "Nora: It's a party.",
        "Renee: We've all missed you so much, darling. Welcome home.",
        "Natalie: Welcome home, Matthew.",
        "Viki: Welcome home, sweetheart.",
        "Matthew: Nobody told me we were doing this.",
        "Bo: Well, we didn't know anything about it.",
        "Nora: But isn't this great? I mean, look, everybody's here. Oh, look. Oh, my goodness, pigs-in-a-blanket, corn dogs, pizza. They're all your favorites.",
        "Clint: Matthew, I wanted to make sure that you had a first-rate welcome.",
        "Nora: Mm. That's really wonderful. Thank you, Uncle Clint, Renee.",
        "Clint: We're Buchanans. No matter what happens, we stick together. We're family.",
        "Matthew: I'm sorry, Uncle Clint. I don't really want to see anyone right now.",
        "Natalie: Dad, I think you did a really nice thing.",
        "Clint: Well, thank you, darling. But I think all I did was make things worse.",
        "Natalie: It's just a very sad, terrible situation.",
        "Jessica: Hello.",
        "[All greet each other]",
        "Viki: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Jessica: Oh, thank you. Hi, Mom. I was so afraid we were going to be late. Is Matthew here?",
        "Viki: Yes. Yeah, he is here. I'm afraid this homecoming's not going very well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Sorry I dissed Uncle Clint.",
        "Nora: Oh, honey, he'll get over it.",
        "Matthew: I'm just not ready for parties and stuff. I mean, maybe once I get used to the wheelchair and being like this.",
        "Bo: Well, whenever you are ready...",
        "Matthew: I just don't want people to feel sorry for me.",
        "Nora: Oh, honey, they're just loving you, that's all. They just love you.",
        "Matthew: Did you see the looks on their faces, how pathetic they thought I was?",
        "Bo: They didn't think you were pathetic.",
        "Matthew: I mean, I don't blame them. I would think that, too. The only one who hasn't gone soft on me so far is Destiny.",
        "Nora: Was that the little girl that came to visit you in the hospital?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but after that one visit she never came back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Where did you get such a good right?",
        "Destiny: My big brother.",
        "Shaun: I thought I told you never to use it on me.",
        "Destiny: Maybe next time I ask you for help you won't blow me off.",
        "Shaun: What are you talking about?",
        "Destiny: I told you about my friend. He's paralyzed, remember?",
        "Shaun: How am I supposed to help a paralyzed kid, Destiny?",
        "Destiny: You can't, but we both know who can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Well, this is very exciting.",
        "Dorian: Yes. Yes, it is. You're going to see how innately sophisticated my husband is.",
        "Ray: But you see, now this -- I don't like this. You want to know how the story will be, but no. They make you break -- they make you wait until the commercial --",
        "Dorian: Shh, shh. Oh, I knew he'd be in a tuxedo.",
        "David: Not too shabby, eh? But it's nothing special for me. I'm out on the town every night of the week. Tonight it's a movie premiere, and I'm seated next to a couple of people named Brad and Angelina. But I can't go. Why not? Because of this. Oh! That's right, my friends. I can't sit down. Like many of you, I have known the painful agony of hemorrhoids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You're going back on our deal?",
        "Stacy: What? No.",
        "Gigi: You better not, because I kept up my end. I lied to the man I love. I pretended to sleep with someone else. I told him it was over. All so you would give your bone marrow to my son.",
        "Stacy: And I will. I promise you.",
        "Gigi: When?",
        "Stacy: Look, okay -- I just can't do it today. I'm not ready.",
        "Gigi: Stacy, do you think I was ready to break up with Rex? Believe me, that hurt me a hell of a lot more than those needles will hurt you. Rex and I are through. That's what you wanted, right?",
        "Stacy: Yes.",
        "Gigi: So what the hell is the problem?",
        "Gigi: What is going on? Why won't you let Michael give you the shot?",
        "Stacy: Look, I want to, okay? It's just I hate needles.",
        "Gigi: I don't give a damn!",
        "Stacy: You don't care that I'm scared?",
        "Gigi: Do you know how many needles Shane has taken? Spinal taps, things like that?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I know.",
        "Gigi: I promised God that I would give up anything if he'd end all that for Shane, and for some reason, he sent me you who made me give up the love of my life. You made a deal, and so you are going to go through with this whether you like it or not.",
        "Rex: Everything okay out here?",
        "Stacy: Everything's fine.",
        "Rex: Sure?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I just -- I'm a little nervous about the shots.",
        "Rex: Yeah. I never liked those, either. I really appreciate you doing this.",
        "Stacy: Oh. Well, great.",
        "Rex: I know we've had our problems. But I am very grateful to you, Stacy.",
        "Stacy: Must've been God's will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jess? Want a corn dog?",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Natalie: Something wrong?",
        "Jessica: No, it's silly.",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Natalie: You can talk to me.",
        "Jessica: I know, thank you. I know.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I don't even know why I'm so upset about it. I wanted -- I wanted to start something with Brody Lovett.",
        "Natalie: That's huge, that's great!",
        "Jessica: Yeah, yeah -- except he didn't want to start something with me.",
        "Natalie: Is that what he said?",
        "Jessica: He didn't have to say anything. He's sleeping with someone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Don't worry; it'll be over before you know it.",
        "Rex: Stacy's really scared.",
        "Gigi: She should be. She hates needles.",
        "Rex: Well, she wants to help Shane.",
        "Gigi: She wants something, all right.",
        "Rex: How can you still be mad at her?",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Rex: You can say what you want about me. I don't want to hear anything else about Stacy. Gigi, she's saving our kid's life!",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Gigi: Brody?",
        "Brody: Hey, Geeg. How you doing?",
        "Gigi: I'm okay, I guess.",
        "Brody: Well, I've been worried about you. Your sister -- is she doing what she said she'd do? Is she going to save Shane?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You're actually kind of lucky because we don't have to extract actual bone marrow.",
        "Stacy: So what do you transplant?",
        "Michael: Just your stem cells. Those will help Shane's immune system rebuild itself.",
        "Stacy: And that's it?",

        "Kyle: All right. I need to give the patient a series of shots of a drug called filgastrim.",
        "Roxy: I don't care if it's anti-freeze -- just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: There are some side effects which include flu-like symptoms, headache, nausea, and pretty severe bone pain. Sounds like a lot of fun, I know.",
        "Stacy: Then what happens?",
        "Michael: After we get your stem cells to the right level, then we collect the blood.",
        "Stacy: Okay. That's it?",
        "Michael: That's it, but that's kind of the tricky part.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Harvesting the stem cells is what's dangerous.",
        "Roxy: I don't care -- just as long as you plant those stems in Shane, I don't care how dangerous it is for this creep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We can't find a suitable arm vein. We have to run a central line, which is a narrow tube right below the clavicle and in through the throat. And if neither of those works, then we'll go in through the femoral artery.",
        "Stacy: Where is that?",
        "Michael: It's right in your thigh.",
        "Stacy: Oh.",

        "David: That was me before -- before Have-a-Seat. One swipe with the wipe and you'll never be afraid to be glued to your chair again. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a movie premiere to get to. But first, I need to -- Have-a-Seat. Control your 'rhoid rage with have-a-seat. One swipe with the wipe and you'll be sitting on top of the world. Have-a-Seat -- treatment and cure.",

        "David: Are you joining me for a champagne toast?",
        "Dorian: It would be so much more of a celebration -- if you were here. So, darling, why don't you come home and let's celebrate together?",
        "David: Dorian, I can't come home now. I have what they call \"heat.\"",
        "Dorian: As I recall, you always did have heat.",
        "David: No, not -- not like that. Dorian? They signed me to a spokesperson contract. You're talking to the new face of have-a-seat.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Well, that's wonderful, but surely your new employers would be happy to fly you home at their own expense.",

        "Clint: Yeah. And I told myself I was doing this for you and bo and Matthew to make you feel a little better, but that's -- that's a lie, that's not true. I did it for myself because I feel so damn helpless.",

        "Gigi: It's not like that.",
        "Rex: Stacy is in there right now getting shots even though she's scared to death of needles, and all you could do is think about Brody!",
        "Gigi: You don't understand --",
        "Rex: Oh, no, you got that right! See, I thought I knew you. I thought you would do anything for Shane, but instead, Stacy's the one who's really coming through.",

        "Stacy: Maybe you can remember you don't want Rex to know who's really saving his son's life.",
        "Roxy: So you forced Gigi to break up with Rex?",
        "Stacy: Why do you care?",
        "Roxy: You broke my baby's heart. So whatever's in those needles, I hope it kills you and makes you fat.",

        "Ray: Why would I do that?",
        "[Dorian scoffs]",
        "Dorian: Because David's commercial is humiliating. Even more humiliating is the fact that he finds it more important than he does me.",

        "Dorian: And since when did my happiness become so important to you?",

        "Michael: We weren't having much luck before, but -- I'll tell you what. Why don't I just give you a few minutes to really think about it. Okay?",
