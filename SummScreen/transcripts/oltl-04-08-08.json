        "Todd goes to see Ramsey and tells him he knows the reason why Gigi is staying in Llanview is because Ramsay is threatening her. And he tells Ramsay that he and Gigi might team up to bring him down. At Capricorn, Cristian is worried about Sarah in Napa alone with Nash, without him. Jessica has the same concern. Jared is hoping he can win Natalie over. But she tells him no way. Antonio is angry at Talia and it looks like he and his new partner want to set John up to get in trouble. Langston knows she cannot tell either Cole or Markko that Starr is pregnant."

        "Nash: How's it going, Cristian?",
        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "Sarah: Hey, Cris! I'm so sorry you're home in the nasty Llanview weather!",
        "Cristian: Is that Sarah?",
        "Nash: Yeah. So, did you get my notes regarding the artwork?",
        "Cristian: You were clear.",
        "Nash: Well, if you got any questions, shoot.",
        "Cristian: I do have one -- what are you doing in Sarah's room?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey -- let's get Uncle Jared to join us.",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Ah, great -- where should we sit?",
        "Layla: Look, I know I'm not your type, but can you at least pretend to be up for this?",
        "Talia: I'm sorry. I'm just -- it's been a really long day.",
        "Layla: Which is the reason we needed to get out. Vince is off somewhere collecting art, and you're not with Antonio tonight. Maybe you will be. What on earth is going on between you two?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Why would you say things could get worse between me and Starr? Sit down. And don't give me that garbage about her dad putting me in jail, you meant something else.",
        "[Cole taps table]",
        "Cole: Quit stalling!",
        "Langston: I can't tell you.",
        "Cole: That means there's something to tell?",
        "Langston: No, it --",
        "Cole: Langston, if you don't tell me what's going on with Starr, I'm just going to go find out for myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Layla: Hey, John.",
        "John: Hey, how you been?",
        "Layla: Good. I'll be right back, Talia.",
        "Talia: Antonio's over there with Eddie.",
        "John: Right now?",
        "Talia: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: Yeah, they'll probably be partnered together now -- after what went down today.",
        "Talia: What was up with Ramsey having you searched? Is he trying to frame you?",
        "John: He wants me out of the way. Obviously, he'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Hello? Everything okay here?",
        "Woman: Fine, Sir. Oh -- and such a beautiful day.",
        "Ramsey: Yeah.",
        "Woman: Watching the sunset from upstairs was breathtaking.",
        "Ramsey: Wow. Yeah, that's why I bought the place -- the views.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ramsey: They call from downstairs about a delivery?",
        "Woman: No.",
        "Ramsey: All right, you go back upstairs.",
        "Ramsey: Come in.",
        "Todd: You screwed up this time, Ramsey.",

        "[Music plays]",
        "Nash: I'm not in Sarah's room.",
        "Cristian: But that's the room I called. The front desk said they were connecting me to Sarah Roberts.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- no, they're -- the -- the hotel screwed up, and -- and they put us in the same suite with two bedrooms.",
        "Sarah: Give me the phone!",
        "Cristian: You mean you're sharing the place?",
        "Nash: Well, it was either that or the manger. I mean, what with the wine convention and everything, you know --",
        "[Sarah taps Nash's arm]",
        "Sarah: Hey -- babe, hey. Listen, this suite -- it's like an apartment -- it's enormous, huge! There's, like, a -- a living room and a kitchenette. I mean, I swear, you could put 10 people in here, and they would not even bump into each other. Hello?",
        "Cristian: I'm here.",
        "Sarah: No, you're not, but I wish you were. I miss you, Cris.",
        "Cristian: Sounds like you're having a good time, though.",
        "[Sarah sighs]",
        "Sarah: I guess that's what a wine tasting will do to you -- and some very expensive bubbly.",
        "Cristian: Champagne, too?",
        "Sarah: To celebrate all the very lucrative hiccups we made today --",
        "[Sarah laughs]",
        "Sarah: Hookups. Did I just say \"hiccups\"?",
        "Cristian: Yes, you did. Listen, sorry to interrupt, but -- and I wouldn't have called your room, but I've been calling your cell phone, and all I get is voicemail.",
        "Sarah: Oh, God, I completely forgot to turn my phone on after we got back. Where the hell is my phone anyway? Oh, crap!",
        "Nash: Oops.",
        "Sarah: Ah --",
        "Cristian: Are you okay?",
        "Sarah: Yeah -- except for me just spilling some very expensive champagne.",
        "Nash: Plenty more where that came from.",
        "Sarah: No, no, not for me. Dude, no, I -- I'm already excediated my limit -- excee-- exceeded my limit. Did I just say \"excediated\"?",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sarah: Is that even a word?",
        "Nash: Uh-uh.",
        "Sarah: It should be.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Sarah: Definitely.",
        "Cristian: I'll let you go.",
        "Sarah: Oh, honey, I'm sorry! I completely forgot you were still here.",
        "Cristian: Bye, Sarah.",
        "Sarah: Bonne nuit, mon cheri. That's the -- the only French I remember from today. Ooh -- that, and arrivederci.",
        "Nash: Everything cool?",
        "Sarah: Super cool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What's going on between you and Jared? Why don't you want him joining us?",
        "Natalie: Nothing. Nothing's going on between me and Jared. It's just that we've been working so much together, I think the last thing he needs is to hang out with me.",
        "Jared: Wrong. I can't think of anybody I want to hang out with more.",
        "Jessica: Hey, Unkie Jared!",
        "Jared: Hello.",
        "Jessica: So, I heard you guys got a lot of work done up at the lodge.",
        "Jared: We did.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, sorry I couldn't join you, but Natalie said I didn't miss a thing, hmm?",
        "Jared: She said that, huh?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Singer: Standing right in front of me",
        "Cristian: Jess, can I talk to you for a sec?",
        "Jessica: Sure. Okay, excuse me, guys.",
        "Jared: Aah.",
        "Natalie: Why are you sitting here?",
        "Jared: Well, Jessica invited me; I didn't want to be rude.",
        "Natalie: Like you usually are?",
        "Jared: God, you're hot when you're angry.",
        "Natalie: Stay away from me.",
        "Jared: But how can I? I mean, we work together, we run in the same circles, and, well, we're family.",
        "Natalie: Oh, that we're definitely not, and we never will be -- and if you don't want the rest of the world to know that, you need to step off.",
        "Jared: But I do want the rest of the world to know that -- and you know exactly why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Singer: My days and nights",
        "Layla: Hey, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Layla, hey. Uh -- Eddie.",
        "Layla: Hi, Eddie. So, Antonio, uh, I haven't seen you around much lately, and that's kind of odd since you are dating my roomie.",
        "Eddie: Yeah, Vega, what's up with that?",
        "[Antonio sighs]",
        "Antonio: What do you want, Layla?",
        "Layla: Nothing -- I came to be friendly.",
        "Antonio: Really? No, you -- you came to be nosy.",
        "Layla: Uh -- excuse me?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, wanted to know what I'm doing here at Capricorn, right, because I lost my money and you think I can't afford it. Certainly not here at Capricorn -- a club I used to own.",
        "Layla: Why are you trying to tell me what I think? I came over here to be friendly.",
        "Antonio: All right, fine, fine, all right? But just so you know, my life's not been put on hold just because I lost my inheritance. I got a lot to be grateful for -- like an open tab.",
        "Layla: Huh -- as well as an amazing woman who's head over heels about you.",
        "Singer: I'm gonna say I think I'm gonna do 'cause you're the love of my life",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: So you found --",
        "John: Cocaine -- in my pocket, right before you guys came back into the warehouse.",
        "Talia: Whoa.",
        "John: Yeah. I put it in the briefcase with the rest of the stuff.",
        "Talia: You think Ramsey planted it on you?",
        "John: Yeah. I caught him in my office earlier in the day, said he was going to give me a printout on the case.",
        "Talia: That man wants you out of the way.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I actually like what you've done with this place, Ramsey.",
        "Ramsey: Thank you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I really like it. Enjoy it while it lasts, it's going to be mine again soon.",
        "Ramsey: Is that why you're here -- to make an offer to buy the place?",
        "Todd: No, I wanted to tell you about seeing this mutual friend of ours.",
        "Ramsey: You don't have any friends.",
        "Todd: That's true. That's true. It's one thing we have in common -- actually, there are two things we have in common. We both like to threaten people. That's why I'm here -- I want to make a nice, friendly threat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You can't just go barging over there; you're going to make things worse.",
        "Cole: All right, then tell me what's going on.",
        "Langston: Fine. Starr -- she's just not feeling that great right now.",
        "Cole: No? Well, what's wrong? Is she sick?",
        "Langston: No. She's just really stressed out about everything.",
        "Cole: \"Stressed out\"? Langston, you're getting all bent out of shape because she's stressed out? Who isn't?",
        "Langston: Cole, I shouldn't have even told you that much, okay? I promised her I wouldn't even say anything about her to you. She's afraid that you're just going to get into more trouble with her dad.",
        "Markko: Hey, Starr's right, man.",
        "Langston: Hey.",
        "Markko: What Mr. Manning saw -- his daughter naked in bed with some guy -- I mean, even a normal dad would go nuts.",
        "Cole: Starr's dad is far from normal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: You may be enjoying whatever this is, but I'm not, so good night.",
        "Todd: Gigi Morasco. I didn't even know she was in town -- till tonight. It turns out she's living with my sister.",
        "Ramsey: Interesting.",
        "Todd: Very interesting, very interesting. You know, it's curious to me. Why would some truck-stop cafe waitress who originally came to town to help out a friend still be here -- especially after some psychopath threatened her and her son and then became police commissioner?",
        "[Todd snickers]",
        "Ramsey: Is there a point to this?",
        "Todd: Yeah, there is. I understand why Gigi and her son are a threat to you, but what I don't get is, why would you allow them to be out in town, on the loose, where they could blab that this guy -- who's now the top cop in Llanview -- put a gun to their head? Unless what you're really trying to do is kind of keep them, you know, reined in so you can wield your power over them, so you can make sure that their mouths are shut -- kind of a -- kind of a \"friends close, enemies closer\" type deal.",
        "Ramsey: Are you done spouting clich\u00e9s?",
        "Todd: I just think, Ramsey, it's a big mistake -- having her around.",
        "Ramsey: She getting on your nerves?",
        "Todd: You know what? I kind of like her. And she's my insurance, and I'm hers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Really? Want to shout it from the rooftops, send out mass emails and fliers, huh?",
        "Jared: I'd have done all that.",
        "Natalie: Must've really liked your two years in prison, because that's exactly where you would've ended up had I not stopped you from telling the entire world that you're a scheming lowlife instead of a Buchanan.",
        "Jared: You know I can actually feel the heat emanating off of you right now?",
        "Natalie: That's because you're too close. You better watch out -- everybody in here's going to think you're a perv cozying up to your niece.",
        "Jared: See, I don't care what anyone else in here thinks; I only care what you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Here you go.",
        "Jessica: Thank you. So you called Sarah?",
        "Cristian: And Nash answered. Look, Jess, I'm telling you this not for you to get the wrong idea. I just thought it -- it's something that you should know.",
        "Jessica: Well, why would I get the wrong idea? I mean, they were probably just working.",
        "Cristian: Wine tasting.",
        "Jessica: Together?",
        "Cristian: That's right. But I guess that's what they call \"work.\"",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Cristian: Anyway, apparently, there was some kind of a mix-up with the hotel, so Sarah and Nash are sharing the same suite.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. It's two-bedroom -- \"it's huge,\" according to Sarah.",
        "Jessica: Oh -- well, because that's weird. I -- I called earlier, and I thought I heard a woman's voice in the room, and Nash told me it was just the TV.",
        "Cristian: Maybe it was. Why would he lie?",
        "Jessica: Well, he wouldn't. I just don't know why he wouldn't tell me that they were sharing a suite.",
        "Cristian: Well, maybe he thinks it's not a big deal. It isn't a big deal, right?",
        "Jessica: Hmm -- are you asking me or are you telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I know Ramsey wants you out, but it can't just be because of the history you have with the guy.",
        "John: Yeah, there's definitely something more, something he doesn't want us to know.",
        "Talia: Do you have any idea what it is?",
        "John: I'm working on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Aah.",
        "[Antonio sighs]",
        "Eddie: So did the commish assign Sahid and McBain to go out tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Did you talk to him tonight?",
        "Talia: No, not yet.",
        "Layla: Hi, guys.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Talia: Hello.",
        "Layla: Um, Talia, I know it's none of my business, but when did that ever stop me?",
        "Talia: What?",
        "Layla: Shouldn't you be at least paying a little bit of attention to Antonio? Have you even said hi to him tonight?",
        "Talia: I'll go do that right now.",
        "Layla: Good. Why are you messing with your friend's girlfriend? What's your problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: Hey, Talia, great to see you out of uniform.",
        "Talia: Hello, Antonio.",
        "Singer: Feels so right",
        "Sarah: So if you're a vintner, how does vintning work, exactly?",
        "Nash: Oh, very complicated process. First, you pick the grapes --",
        "Sarah: Uh-huh?",
        "Nash: And then you stomp them.",
        "Sarah: You do not!",
        "Nash: How drunk are you?",
        "Sarah: I am completely sober, mister, and I resent that apparition --",
        "Nash: Hmm?",
        "Sarah: Accusation.",
        "Nash: More?",
        "Sarah: Why not?",
        "Nash: All right.",
        "[Sarah giggles]",
        "Sarah: But the real question --",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm?",
        "Sarah: I forgot.",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Sarah: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! I remember, I remember. So how did you get into the wine business anyway? I mean, Pennsylvania is not exactly the capital of the world for wine.",
        "Nash: Hmm. I actually had a place right here in Napa before I went out to Llanview -- something I dreamed about for a long time.",
        "Sarah: And your dream came true?",
        "Nash: Yes, I suppose it did. It just -- it's always fascinated me. You -- you take this shriveled-up, old, dying root and you put it in the ground, and you nurture it and you take care of it, and it grows into this amazing thing. Something so -- so wonderful, it -- it hits all five of your senses, something that can give such -- such unbelievable pleasure.",
        "Sarah: I thought we were talking about wine here.",
        "Nash: Yes. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm a geek about that stuff. Call me \"geek,\" call me \"geek.\"",
        "Sarah: Oh, no, no, no, you're not a geek.",
        "Nash: Hmm?",
        "Sarah: I completely understand where you're coming from. I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I don't have a problem with Sarah and Nash's relationship. What am I saying -- they don't even have a relationship, they're just working together. I'm fine with it, I'm fine. I just hope you are, too.",
        "Jessica: Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Cristian: I don't know -- you just seemed a little -- you were on edge the last time you came to pick up my sketches.",
        "Jessica: Cristian, I wasn't on edge because Sarah and Nash are in Napa together. I -- you know -- yes, yes, I am envious. You know, they're in the sun, they're drinking wine, and -- I don't know -- Nash and I made nice memories when we were in Napa.",
        "Cristian: You wish you could've gone, huh?",
        "Jessica: Don't you?",
        "Cristian: Sure -- of course I'd like to be with Sarah.",
        "Jessica: How about this -- I buy the manager a drink?",
        "Cristian: Only if you let me get the next round.",
        "Jessica: Ooh.",
        "Cristian: I'm telling you, the bartender here makes the best virgin mai tai ever.",
        "Jessica: Sounds great. Why should we let Nash and Sarah have all the fun, huh?",
        "Cristian: That's --",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I already told you -- there won't be anything --",
        "Jared: Anything happening between us. Yes, I remember you mentioning that -- and then you came on to me over a video game.",
        "Natalie: I did not come on to you.",
        "Jared: Well, then what do you call it?",
        "Natalie: Inflicting unbearable pain.",
        "Jared: Oh, you're into torture?",
        "Natalie: You're so clueless.",
        "Jared: I do know one thing -- you have it for me bad. I can see it in your eyes, and I can feel it in that heat that's still coming off that -- body.",
        "Natalie: What you're seeing is rage and hatred.",
        "Jared: There's a fine line between that and passion and desire.",
        "Natalie: Well, that is a line I definitely will not be crossing after what you did to my family.",
        "Jared: What's this really about, Natalie? Are you never going to forgive me because I chose the Buchanans over you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I don't know what you heard, but you heard wrong.",
        "Layla: I only know what I've heard from Talia. And you got to know that Antonio doesn't trust you. You come in here, and you talk up Talia right in front of him? What's going on, John? You know, I thought you were a pretty decent guy when you dated my sister, but, then again, you did dump her for Natalie. So I shouldn't really be surprised that you would go after your friend's girlfriend.",
        "John: I'm not going to talk about this with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I came here with Layla. She, uh, thought it would be a good idea for us to go out tonight.",
        "Antonio: Good, I'm glad. I'm happy for you guys.",
        "Talia: Are -- are you okay being here?",
        "Antonio: Sure -- why wouldn't I be?",
        "Talia: I know how much Capricorn meant to you, how hard it must've been for you to have to give it up.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. Well -- um -- such is life, right? Sometimes you have things for a little while, and then you lose them -- I'm used to it.",
        "Eddie: That's telling her.",
        "Talia: You're an idiot, Eddie. Go away.",
        "Antonio: Ahem.",
        "Eddie: I'll be over here if you need me.",
        "Talia: You don't have to lose anything else. You know how much I care about you.",
        "John: Antonio?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Did Gigi Morasco tell you I threatened her?",
        "Todd: No, you got her too scared to talk.",
        "Ramsey: Hmm. Well, she didn't say anything about me because there's nothing to say. Now, from what I understand, she found a job here and is staying for the sake of her son.",
        "Todd: Oh, Lee. Well, I just wanted to let you know that if you harm me or my family, Gigi's going to nail you. And if you harm her or her son, I'm going to nail you. Okay? I'll let myself out.",
        "Woman: Everything all right, Sir?",
        "Ramsey: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr is the most important person in my life. She made me feel like I wasn't alone.",
        "Markko: Well, you still got us, man.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I know, but I don't have her. And -- and now I feel like I did when my mom -- I feel like there's something missing. Why'd her dad have to mess everything up? Why'd he have to come up with that stupid idea to move to Hawaii? Why'd we have to go to your house that night?",
        "Langston: Are you sorry you did?",
