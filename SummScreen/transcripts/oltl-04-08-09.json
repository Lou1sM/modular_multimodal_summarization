        "Todd: Yeah, like I said, I saw Rosen. He came to my office and tried to guilt me into bankrolling him because he's on the streets now.",
        "Oliver: Well, what did you do?",
        "Todd: I told him to get lost.",
        "Talia: Well, how did he react? Did he threaten you or anything like that?",
        "Todd: Oh, you guys think maybe he -- he's the one who knifed Blair.",

        "Blair: Come in.",
        "Guard: There's someone here to see you, Mrs. McBain.",
        "Blair: Who is it, Andy?",
        "Marty: May I come in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Starr, I've been looking for you everywhere. You blew off school. You haven't answered your phone. Where have you been?",
        "Starr: I went to see Schuyler.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding?",
        "Starr: But, don't worry. Cole showed up and messed up everything.",

        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: Busted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: We are investigating Rosen as a possible suspect in the stabbings. But seeing as the first victim we found was here in your house with a knife from your kitchen, you're on that list, too.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, and just a heads up, I'd watch my back if I were you.",
        "[Todd laughs]",
        "Todd: Well, instead of warning me about him, why don't you find the son of a bitch before he stabs someone else in the back? Here you go, I don't need that. I know what he looks like.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Talia: That was productive.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, what a jerk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Wait a minute. Is this my daughter? My beautiful Rachel? No, wait, she lives in Chicago and has no time to come home for a visit.",
        "Rachel: Okay, okay, I'm here.",
        "Nora: Oh, I'm so glad to see you. I can't tell you how much I've missed you.",
        "Rachel: I've missed you, too. And phone calls and e-mails just aren't enough. I had no idea how hard it's been for you since Matthew's accident.",
        "Nora: Well, that was the plan. I didn't want to worry you.",
        "Hank: So I did, instead.",
        "Rachel: And I'm glad that Dad did.",
        "Nora: What did you do, just up and leave Chicago, your job, the guy you're seeing, just to be with me?",
        "Rachel: Yeah, right now, there is nowhere else I would rather be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Jack Manning, you give me that phone.",
        "Jack: Aunt Dorian, aren't you married to David Vickers?",
        "Dorian: David Vickers-Buchanan.",
        "Jack: Who cares what his name is? He's still you're husband. And what you're doing with Mr. Montez, isn't that called cheating?",
        "Dorian: Give me that phone.",
        "Jack: And that's called abuse. I bet you have Uncle David's number on speed dial. Oh, there it is. Now all I've got to do is press send, and he sees you swapping spit with your little new boyfriend.",
        "Ray: Give her the phone, man. Give her the phone.",
        "Jack: Hey, senor, this is between me and her, comprende?",
        "Dorian: Jack, you give me the phone this instant.",
        "Jack: Sure, as soon as you get your lawyers to get rid of John McBain so I can go live with my dad.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Wait a second, you showed up at Mr. J's place?",
        "Starr: I had to see him. I had to let him know how I feel about him.",
        "Langston: I thought you were going to try and get over this little crush you had on him.",
        "Starr: This is not a crush, Langston.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Schuyler sighs]",
        "Starr's voice: \"Dear Schuyler, maybe you can't admit it, but what we have is real.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, you're saying you're, like, falling for this guy?",
        "Starr: I even told my mom about Schuyler.",
        "Langston: Including the fact that he's a teacher? And she was just, what, okay with that?",
        "Starr: She said that if I was into someone I should go for it. Just like she did with John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hope you like tulips.",
        "Blair: Who doesn't like tulips?",
        "Marty: How are you feeling?",
        "Blair: Well, the physical therapy is a bitch, and I still hurt like hell.",
        "Marty: But other than that?",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, I'm still here. Luckier than your friend Wes and Lee Halpern. So, Marty, what made you decide to visit?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, I want to report a break-in. The Highway 5 motel, room seven. It's in progress, get someone over here quick.",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Cole: Manning, open the door. Manning!",
        "Todd: Oh, God, not you again. What is it this time?",
        "Cole: Shut up. I have something to say, and you're going to listen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Gee, Hank, I don't know whether to kiss you or to sock you.",
        "Hank: Well, can I make a suggestion?",
        "Nora: No, you may not. I didn't want to worry Rachel.",
        "Rachel: Like I wasn't anyway. My little brother is paralyzed. I was freaking out. I would have come sooner if you didn't keep insisting that I didn't have to.",
        "Nora: Well, you had that big job you were doing.",
        "Rachel: I took a hiatus. I explained the situation, and everybody's okay with me taking some time off.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. So you're here for how long?",
        "Rachel: As long as it takes. Now that Matthew's home from the hospital, the hard part starts. Let me help you, okay?",
        "Nora: Oh, for God's sake, you know what? You already have. Oh, hey, Clint had a party. Come on in, come on in. Everyone's here and they'll love to see you. Hey, oh. Well, I guess everyone fled the scene when they found out Matthew wasn't really into it. Corndog, Hank?",
        "Hank: No, thank you. Look, I'll go and see how he and Bo are doing.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Hank: All right.",
        "Rachel: Matthew wasn't up for much of a party, huh?",
        "Nora: No, no, no, he wasn't. And, you know, Clint didn't know. He just -- I wish he'd just run the idea by me first.",
        "Rachel: Well, he was just trying to help. We all are.",
        "Nora: Well, there's nothing anyone can do. Matthew's so depressed.",
        "Rachel: And you aren't?",
        "Nora: Oh, no, I'm not going to go there. I have got to keep things, you know, together for Matthew. If I fall apart --",
        "Rachel: The world will still survive. Do us all a favor, especially yourself, deal with what you're going through and then you can help Matthew.",
        "[Nora groans]",
        "Nora: Oh, there's just so much to deal with.",
        "Rachel: I know, not only is your son paralyzed, but the kid you took in and raised as your own is responsible for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know what, kid? If you're here to go off on me about your mom, save it. Get over it, man, and please leave.",
        "Cole: I'm -- I'm not going anywhere, not -- not until you hear this.",
        "Todd: Boy, you're really w-w-w-wasted, aren't you? Aren't you supposed to be in rehab?",
        "Cole: This has nothing to do with me or my mom.",
        "Todd: Well, whatever it is --",
        "Cole: No, you know -- shh! You've been too busy feeling sorry for yourself because my mom won't forgive you for raping her again, that you don't even know what's going on with Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr's voice: \"From the minute you talked to me that first time, when you told me to stay after class, I felt it. I think you did, too. We belong together.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hold up. You mom told you to go for Mr. J?",
        "Starr: Okay, so I didn't tell her that he was my teacher. What does that matter?",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? It totally matters.",
        "Starr: Who cares if he is my teacher? All that matters is how we feel about each other.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Langston: Okay, so?",
        "Starr: So I went to go see him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr's voice: \"You called me a child today, and I guess it was a little crazy for me to start taking off my clothes.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You took your clothes off in front of him?",
        "Starr: To prove that I am not a child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr's voice: \"I have lost a child, so how can I be one? I know you think we can't be together because you're older than me and you're my teacher, and that's what makes you hold back from me. But I saw the way you looked at me when I was standing in front of you without my top on. It was just for a second, but I saw it.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: He looked at you? You mean, like, he wanted you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Boot McPain so I can go live with my dad, or Uncle David sees this kiss.",
        "Dorian: Is this the way that you respect the wishes of your mother? Your mother, who is recuperating in a hospital. And, yet, she loves you so much that she made sure that you would be taken care of by a wonderful man -- John McBain. Your father has a corrupting influence on you. He's the one who put you up to this, and I want you to put that phone down now.",
        "Jack: Deal or no deal, Aunt Dorian? I go live with my dad or Uncle David sees you frenching your hot tamale.",
        "Ray: Actually, Jack, don't listen to her.",
        "Dorian: What? What are you doing?",
        "Ray: No, it's okay. Let him send the picture to your husband. Let him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I wanted to wait until you were feeling better till I came to see you.",
        "Blair: So I wouldn't have a setback?",
        "Marty: Blair, I'm sorry. If I hadn't called John that night, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't be like this.",
        "Blair: And if he hadn't gone running to you -- yeah, I didn't want him to go, but he went anyway.",
        "Marty: I wish he hadn't.",
        "Blair: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Marty: But I just wanted to come here and tell you that it's never going to happen again.",
        "Blair: You bet your ass it won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Go on, boy, send the picture. But understand, the instant you do, you make an enemy of me. Now, I have survived years in a Colombian prison, little man. I could tell you many stories. But I will tell you just one. Like you, a cell mate of mine once tried to blackmail me. He did not live to tell the tale. If it weren't for his dental records, no one would have ever known whose body it was in the prison incinerator. Comprende, senor? So, give me the phone right now.",
        "Jack: I don't want to end up like that guy in the incinerator. But John McBain will never be my dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Surprise.",
        "Oliver: John.",
        "Talia: What are you doing here? We're here on a b&e call.",
        "John: I know, I called it in.",
        "Oliver: Wait, did you see who did it?",
        "John: It was me, you idiots. I broke and I entered.",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Talia: What the hell, John?",
        "John: What do you mean, \"What the hell?\" This is Zach Rosen's room, all right? I thought I'd have a little look around.",
        "Oliver: Well, why wouldn't you just let us know you found where Rosen was staying? Why would you break in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I heard you got married. Congratulations.",
        "Blair: It wasn't much of a ceremony. You know, the bride just came out of a coma. But the family was here. I think John and I look happy in the photos.",
        "Marty: It was very nice of him to step up. You know, so you could keep your children.",
        "Blair: Well, there was more to it than that. More than just the custody.",
        "Marty: Of course. Um... So, have you -- have you been able to remember anything about what happened to you? Who did this to you?",
        "Blair: I remember stepping into the shower. I remember feeling like I had been hit really hard in the back with a baseball bat. And there was all kinds of blood in the shower. I couldn't breathe -- felt like I couldn't breathe, and then I passed out.",
        "Marty: It must have been terrible.",
        "Blair: So, why don't you tell me why you're so interested in what I remember?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: We could have gotten a warrant to search the place. Why would you break in?",
        "Talia: Fish, we didn't have enough probable for a warrant. John knew that.",
        "Oliver: So, he broke in so we could investigate and the door would already be open.",
        "Talia: Anything that we could connect to the stabbings would be in plain sight and would give us grounds for a warrant. You better work fast before Rosen gets back.",
        "Oliver: All right, what did you find that we can use?",
        "Talia: By the way, we just came from Todd's house and, apparently, Rosen went by to his office. I guess he was trying to hit him up for some financial assistance, but Todd just threw him out.",
        "Talia: Wow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't know what you're talking about. Is something wrong with Starr? She seemed --",
        "Cole: Nothing is wrong with Starr. The problem is the teacher that's trying to get in her pants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Schuyler did not want to be looking at me like that, but he -- he definitely was.",
        "Langston: Starr, he's a guy. You took your sweater off.",
        "Starr: No, I'm not imagining this. I really think that something would have happened.",
        "Langston: Like sex?",
        "Starr: No, like something. If Cole hadn't have come and been banging on the door, screaming that he was going to break through the door -- I hid, and Schuyler got rid of him.",
        "Langston: So, Cole never actually knew that you were there?",
        "Starr: No, but he ruined everything. Then, once he left, Schuyler kicked me out of his house. He just can't admit that he is so into me.",
        "Langston: You think he really is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr's voice: \"I'm sorry you got in trouble because of me. I want you to get your job back, and I'll do whatever I can to help you. And when you do, I'll pretend like there's nothing between us, and we'll both know that there is. And after next year, I'll graduate and we'll be free to be with each other. I'll wait for you, I promise. Please, please, wait for me, Schuyler. Tell me you'll wait for me. All my love, Starr.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, you're going to wait for Mr. J.?",
        "Starr: Go ahead, call me stupid. Say that I need a reality check. Just say that I'm just like every other little high school girl having a crush on her teacher. Go ahead, say it.",
        "Langston: Starr, don't you know by now that I'm always on your side, no matter what?",
        "Starr: So you think that I'm right? I should wait for Mr. J.?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Cole: What I just said. This teacher is going after her.",
        "Todd: No, no, that's not possible. She would have said something to me.",
        "Cole: To you?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Cole: To you? She hates you, Todd.",
        "Todd: Why are you telling me this?",
        "Cole: It's because I'm worried about her. And if you care at all about her, you should be, too.",
        "Todd: Oh, of course I care about her. I love her.",
        "Cole: Then listen to what I'm telling you and do something about it.",
        "Todd: Now, how do you know this teacher is going after her?",
        "Cole: Because I saw them kissing.",
        "Todd: You saw a teacher kissing Starr? Are you positive this wasn't a drug- induced -- ?",
        "Cole: Look, I know what I saw! And there's more to it. I just came from the guy's place at Angel Square. He swore there was nothing going on between them. But when I got there, he looked like he'd just pulled his pants on. He said he just got out of the shower, though.",
        "Todd: And you think he was lying?",
        "Cole: I know he was lying, because I stayed in the hallway for a while. I saw your daughter, Starr, leave his room. Looked like she had just put her clothes on, too. Now do you believe me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I think maybe waiting for Mr. J isn't the best idea, but it's definitely way better than doing things like showing up at his place and taking your clothes off.",
        "Starr: I left him a letter. I said that I would wait for him. But I haven't gotten a call yet.",
        "Langston: Okay. Waiting for him is one thing, but expecting a call --",
        "Starr: Langston, I love him. You know what that's like.",
        "Langston: Yes, I do. And so do you. Because what Cole and you had was real.",
        "Starr: No, this is real, too.",
        "Langston: Starr, I don't want you to get hurt. Okay? And if you spend the next year of your life waiting for Joplin, you and Cole will never get back together. But maybe that's just your way of dealing with losing him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Who is this teacher?",
        "Cole: Mr. J. Schuyler Joplin.",
        "Todd: Joplin.",
        "Cole: Yep. And you can find him at the Angel Square Hotel.",
        "Todd: You lying to me?",
        "Cole: I'm not --",
        "Todd: Are you lying to me?",
        "Cole: No, I'm not lying to you.",
        "Todd: Lock up when you leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Now apologize to your aunt. Don't make her wait.",
        "Jack: Aunt Dorian, I'm sorry.",
        "Dorian: That's much better. Thank you, Jack.",
        "Dorian: He won't listen to reason, but he responds to threats of violence. He's his father's son.",
        "Ray: He's in a world of trouble. His mother was almost killed, he doesn't know what his father will do next. His father has obviously poisoned him against John McBain.",
        "Dorian: I don't think he'll ever accept John as his stepfather.",
        "Ray: He has reason to be angry. But it's good that you don't give in to him. I admire you for that.",
        "Dorian: Back at you. I really hate the idea of Todd getting his claws into that boy.",
        "Ray: And you will do anything to protect your family. Maybe this isn't right. I don't know. But your husband will not find out about it this way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Jack, what's wrong with you?",
        "Langston: What happened?",
        "Jack: Your uncle is a horse's butt.",
        "Langston: Wait, whoa. Jack, hey!",
        "Starr: Wait a minute! Jack.",
        "Langston: What was that all about?",
        "Starr: He's probably just upset because he can't see my dad. Oh, my God. Oh, no.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: Oh, no.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: It's a letter from school to my mom. It's probably about what happened with me and Schuyler.",
        "Langston: Well, what are you going to do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: \"Dear Starr -- \"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I don't like to admit this, but every time I look at Matthew, I go straight to Cole and what he did to my son.",
        "Rachel: Why wouldn't you?",
        "Nora: I try to turn it off. I want to. I just can't. Because I think I just need someone to blame besides myself. Cole was living in this house when he started using drugs, and I didn't see it. With my experience, and God knows I've had some experience, I didn't read the signs. And Matthew saw that he was on drugs, but he still got into the car with Cole. Because he loves Cole. He looks at him as a brother. He trusts him. He wants to be like him. He doesn't even blame Cole for what's going on. He doesn't hate him. How does he do that? How does he do -- because you know what? I wanted to nail Cole to the wall. Maximum sentence. That's what I was gunning for. I wanted to lock Cole up for as long as the law would allow. But I didn't.",
        "Rachel: And why didn't you?",
        "Nora: Honey, why do you think? Because I thought about you when you were using drugs. And I know that all I wanted was for you to get help, not punishment.",
        "Rachel: Well, is Cole getting treatment?",
        "Nora: Yep. He's going to a rehab center.",
        "Rachel: And how's he doing? Has he stopped using?",
        "Nora: Oh, well, I certainly hope so. I mean, the treatment center does random drug testing. I mean, if he fails, he's going to prison.",
        "Rachel: Unfortunately, that won't necessarily stop him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Do I know you?",
        "Zach: I don't know. Do you?",
        "Zach: I'm an old friend of your mother's.",
        "Cole: I don't remember you.",
        "Zach: Oh, you weren't even born when she put me in Statesville.",
        "Cole: Zach Rosen. You were there. You raped my mom.",
        "Zach: Good guess.",
        "Cole: I remember your face from when you were on trial. I memorized your face, Powell Lord's -- you almost ruined my mom's life.",
        "Zach: Oh, yeah? Well, she did ruin mine, the bitch.",
        "Cole: Son of a -- !",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I remember when I was using, I kept thinking I can stop whenever I want. And I would make a plan. One week from Monday. That's it, that's the end. And Monday would come. And I'd be like, \"not today.\"",
        "Nora: Well, that was just a really difficult time for you.",
        "Rachel: And for everybody who cared about me. God, when I think about the people that I hurt -- you and dad more than anything. And the look of disappointment in your faces. That made me want to get high.",
        "Nora: Okay, well you stopped.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, luckily before I ran a car off the road and put somebody in a wheelchair.",
        "Nora: Well, Cole swears that this has gotten through to him.",
        "Rachel: Uh-huh.",
        "Nora: You don't believe him?",
        "Rachel: Kids that I work with in Chicago have done way worse than Cole did. That doesn't stop them.",
        "Nora: Well, he'd better stop; he's got to get his act together here.",
        "Rachel: Sometimes you can't. That is what I'm trying to say to you. Even if you want to, the addiction, it's just so hard to fight.",
        "Nora: Well, he -- God, he has to. He has to do this. I can't sit on him. I've got to focus on Matthew, and Matthew right now needs more help than I can give him.",
        "Rachel: And that is why I am here.",
        "Nora: You shouldn't have come. But I'm so glad you did.",
        "Rachel: And you have Dad, and Bo and Clint.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Rachel: Are you and Clint okay?",
        "Nora: What? Oh. We're just having a little trouble talking to each other right about now. No, it's worse than that. I don't know. And Matthew moving back in to the house, I don't know how it's going to play itself out.",
        "Rachel: It's like they say in recovery, one step at a time.",

        "Marty: There's a killer out there, and whoever it is has already killed two people. One of them was my good friend. I want them caught.",
        "Blair: Before they come after you?",
        "Marty: No. They already had their chance with me.",
        "Blair: Right. Right, right, right. You already said that you were passed out beside Wes when he was stabbed.",
        "Marty: Blair, I know what you told the police, but it wasn't me.",
        "Blair: What are you even here for? I mean, unless you're here just to cover your own behind. Do you know something? Hmm? Marty. What do you know?",
        "Marty: I think I better let John answer that.",

        "Talia: Yeah, I need a warrant.",
        "Oliver: Mrs. McBain has security at the hospital, so he won't be able to get to her again.",
        "John: Especially if you bring him in. And you got enough here to drag him in for questioning.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, based on the information you got because you broke in. How are we supposed to explain that?",
        "John: Fish, didn't you learn anything?",
        "Talia: Fish, it's fine. We've got it covered.",
        "Oliver: But I still think that it's --",
        "John: Listen to me. Rosen's duffel's here with all his stuff in it. I promise you he's coming back.",
        "Talia: All right, and we'll be waiting for him. They're faxing a warrant over to the office here. John, you can't be here when Rosen gets back.",
        "John: Right. Hey, do me a favor and watch your backs, all right? This guy's been here awhile, he's only now letting himself be known. All right, he's either desperate or getting bolder or both. Be careful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Knock yourself out, kid. Looks like I could do whatever I want to you.",

        "Marty: You're more worried about that than --",
        "Blair: I'm not worried, Marty. But you've been obviously talking to my husband, and it's about me.",
        "Marty: It wasn't personal, it was about the case.",
        "Blair: Look, you know what? I'm tired, okay? I'm tired, I need to get my strength back so I can be with my --",
        "Marty: Husband, yes, I know.",
        "Marty: I really am glad you're going to get better. I mean that. Oh, and about that interview you gave before you were stabbed. You know, the one where you called my a psychotic killer? No hard feelings.",

        "Starr: \"Dear Ms. Cramer, this is to inform you that we are fully cooperating with the authorities on an investigation into Schuyler Joplin's behavior and have suspended him from his duties as a teacher at Llanview High School. Repeated attempts have been made to reach you with no success. Because of this, we believe it is our duty to send a copy to the non-custodial parent, Starr's father, as well.\" Oh, my gosh. My dad's going to kill Schuyler.",
        "Langston: Uh, yeah.",
        "Starr: He beat the crap out of Cole when he found us in bed together.",
        "Langston: And Cole wasn't even your teacher.",
        "Starr: No, you don't understand. I need to find him before he sees this letter.",
        "Langston: No -- okay, I'm going with you.",
        "Starr: You're not going with me. You really can't be in the middle of this. I have to do this myself. I need to find my dad before he goes psycho on Schuyler.",
        "Langston: Wait, Starr.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: Good luck.",

        "Dorian: Not just Jack. But when David said he wasn't going to come home, you knew --",
        "Ray: Well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that you need more than your husband is giving you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, so what was that? A mercy kiss?",
        "Ray: I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Your niece is like a daughter to you. She's in the hospital. Her children's lives are in chaos. Even a woman as strong as you deserves the support of the man she loves.",
        "Ray: That's the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hi.",

        "Marty: Fine. She's fine. Very much the Blair we know and love. How about you? Figure anything else out?",
        "John: We found where Zach Rosen's been holed up. He wasn't there, but he's definitely up to something.",

        "John: And I think it's only a matter of time before he finds you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Then Marty moved out, of course. I don't know how she's going to see Cole through this. She's got enough problems of her own. She's connected to some of these stabbings that have been going on lately. How's Matthew?",

        "Nora: Trying to get him into a baseball game -- last year at this time, he was playing baseball.",

        "Nora: Oh, Hank. How do you ever get used to something like this?",
        "Rachel: Mom, you always want to make everything okay right away. Sometimes you just can't do that. That is why I am going to be here as long as you need.",
        "Nora: Thank you both for reminding me of the family that we used to be. A family who could get through anything.",

        "John: Rosen's been keeping this big stack of newspapers about you and Todd and Blair. It's like an obsession.",
        "Marty: So you were right about him.",
        "John: Blair's not the only one who needs extra security. I think you need a detail, too. I don't know what this guy's up to, but it's like it's a fixation for him. He's focused on you and Manning and anyone connected with the two of you.",
