        "Adriana: What's going on, Tate?",
        "Tate: Well, there's this thing. I guess you could call it a lifelong dream, but it's finally happening.",
        "Rex: They're naming a stadium after you?",
        "Tate: I used to ask myself, when I was playing, is there life after baseball? And one thing kept coming into my head. Sportscasting. I got an offer from channel 7.",
        "Adriana: \"Llanview Live\"?",
        "Tate: They want me to take over for Buck Phillips.",
        "Rex: What happened to buck? You feed him to the sharks?",

        "Adriana: That is great news! I'm so happy for you! But --",
        "Tate: Oh, don't worry, I'm way ahead of you. More exposure for Tate Harmon means more sales for exposed. It's a good thing for both of us.",

        "Rex: What the hell do you think you're doing, Harmon?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: What do you mean, I'm not coming? We settled this last night.",
        "Todd: You settled it.",
        "Evangeline: You agreed.",
        "Todd: I changed my mind.",
        "Evangeline: Change it back.",
        "Todd: No. No. This is my deal. I have to do it my way.",
        "Evangeline: Todd, you need me to be there to make sure you don't do something stupid.",
        "Todd: This is Spencer Truman we're talking about. You know, it could be a wild-goose chase. But at worst, he could be brush me off once and for all.",
        "Evangeline: That's why I'm coming.",
        "Todd: No, no. Evangeline, will you please let me do the right thing for once in my life?",
        "Layla: From what I hear, your definition of \"right\" is a little shady.",
        "Todd: Hey -- I can't let anything happen to you.",
        "Evangeline: I can handle myself.",
        "Todd: No. If you got hurt, I don't know what I'd do. I couldn't -- besides which, you are the assistant D.A., so you'd be putting your career at risk, right? You know I'm right about that.",
        "Layla: Don't look at me. I'm on his side this time.",
        "Evangeline: Todd, I appreciate your concern for me and for my career and the D.A.'S office, but I'm going to be ok. I know Chicago. I have connections there. Legitimate legal connections. I won't be compromised.",
        "Layla: Vange, will you just let it go? He does not want you to go, so don't go.",
        "Evangeline: Stay out of",
        "Layla: No! You're going to get yourself hurt -- either by someone in Chicago or by him.",
        "Evangeline: Ok, I'm going. He needs me there.",
        "Layla: For what? Bait?",
        "Evangeline: Layla, why are you even in the conversation? This is none of your business. Can you just stay out of this?",
        "Layla: Oh, you're going to let somebody like him turn you against your own sister?",
        "Todd: Forget it, you're not coming, Evangeline. I already put my kid in harm's way, I won't do the same to you. I was pretty nervous, apprehensive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: It kills me to see you hurt like this, Starr. I'm sorry. But what you did -- it was right, and I'm proud of you.",
        "Starr: Well, I'm glad for you, because I feel like crap.",
        "Blair: Oh, baby. It's hard to put other people, you know, ahead of you, especially when you really, really want to be with a boy you like.",
        "Starr: Mom, I don't like him, I love him. Is that so hard to understand?",
        "Blair: Starr --",
        "Starr: I love him!",
        "Blair: And I know that it hurts. Someday, it won't hurt as much, really.",
        "Starr: Like it doesn't hurt with you and dad anymore?",
        "Blair: Well, it's different that --",
        "Starr: It's not different. I love Cole! And right now, I -- God, I hate dad.",
        "Blair: You do not hate your father. You know that.",
        "Starr: I know, but I don't think I'll ever feel the same way about him again.",
        "Blair: I understand. Yeah, I understand. You know, maybe we should just go easy on your dad right now. He's going through a hard time. He needs our support.",
        "Starr: Why, what happened?",
        "Blair: You know the son that he had with Margaret Cochran? Well, he got a tip that maybe that baby is still alive after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It might be Spencer just jerking my chain, but I have to follow up on it. I can't give up on my son if there's a chance I can get him back.",
        "Layla: Well, I hope you find him alive and well. But I appreciate you keeping my sister out of it. Ok?",
        "Evangeline: Layla --",
        "Layla: You heard Todd. It's a dead issue. I got to go. Let's have dinner.",
        "Todd: Well, I guess I should go, too. I don't want to miss the plane.",
        "Evangeline: You're not going anywhere, not without me.",

        "Marcie: Yeah. Well, I think we're blessed. You know? At least that's the only explanation I have for it.",
        "[Tommy babbles]",
        "Michael: Yeah. It does seem like God had something to do with him ending up with us, you know?",
        "Marcie: Hmm, yeah.",
        "Michael: You know, we would be better for him than his natural parents.",
        "Marcie: Oh, he was meant to be with us. You know, I pray every day that nothing ever happens to change that.",
        "Carlotta: Would it be all right if I came to the hearing today?",
        "Jessica: I think it's closed.",
        "Antonio: Oh, actually, it's not. And I think it would be great for both our families to be there. I mean, if you can.",
        "Carlotta: You can definitely count on me.",
        "Antonio: What about your mom and dad?",
        "Jessica: I think they're pretty busy.",

        "Carlotta: Are you sure? You seem -- I hope you don't mind my saying -- a little nervous.",
        "Jessica: Well, I -- this is a really big deal, you know? I'm going to be legally Jamie's new mommy, and I just -- I -- I just hope I'm good enough, you know?",
        "Antonio: Of course you are, honey, you're perfect.",
        "Jessica: I just -- I just don't want anything to -- to screw up the adoption or anything.",
        "Antonio: Huh. Like what?",
        "Jessica: You're right, I'm being silly. I'm going to go and check in on my mom and my dad, so I'll see you two later, ok?",
        "Antonio: Ok.",

        "Clint: Yes, in your mind maybe.",
        "Nash: Well, and in Jessica's mind, too.",
        "Clint: Oh, Nash, this has got to stop. It's not good for anybody.",
        "Nash: Do you love your daughter?",
        "Clint: What kind of a question is that?",
        "Nash: Yes, of course you love your daughter, I know that. Then help her.",

        "Nash: I don't think that's possible.",
        "Clint: Oh, gosh, now you're really pushing it.",
        "Nash: All right, look, I -- I know you think that I'm deluded, but I am not. I need you to help me make Jessica realize that once again she's rushing into something too soon and for all the wrong reasons.",
        "Clint: I'm supposed to accept your word on this and go disrupt my daughter's family?",
        "Nash: Yes. Just listen to me. Because if I'm right, things are only going to get worse, and they're pretty bad. And Jamie -- I mean -- Jamie doesn't deserve this. Look, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. But if I'm right -- please. Would you just talk to her, Clint?",

        "Tate: Well, I'm glad we got that all worked out.",
        "Rex: No, we didn't. Stay away from my girlfriend, or you won't be able to model or do anything else. Got it?",
        "Tate: Sure, Rex. But I got to tell you, anybody who gets this bent out of shape over some guy looking at his girlfriend can't be too secure. And to be honest with you, I can see where you'd be concerned. Ooh!",

        "Adriana: Unless you started it.",
        "Rex: Are you sure about this? Todd has a solid lead on his kid?",
        "Layla: That's what he's saying, anyway. He's leaving for Chicago as we speak right now, and I just hope Vange doesn't talk him back into letting her go along with him.",
        "Rex: Ok, he's at Evangeline's place?",
        "Layla: He was. I don't know what time his plane leaves.",
        "Rex: Ok, can you stay here until Tate leaves?",
        "Layla: Sure. Why?",
        "Rex: I -- I don't trust that guy with Adriana.",
        "Layla: Ok, I get that, but why do you have to leave all of a sudden?",
        "Rex: I need to see Todd before he gets on that plane.",

        "Blair: Well, I think he's got his hopes up, but -- well, we both know that he'll be completely devastated if he finds out that baby's dead again. But you know your dad. He's determined, and he's going to do what he's got to do.",
        "Starr: I don't think he should do it alone. What? Come on.",

        "Todd: And what are you going to do when your back's against the wall, and you have to just act? You'll have to choose between your career and my son. I don't want you to have to make that choice. And I'm sure as hell not going to make you choose between life and death.",

        "Antonio: Thanks, Mami, but I'm a little too wound up to eat.",
        "Carlotta: And I know why.",
        "Antonio: Because my daughter's getting the mother she loves, has wanted her whole life?",
        "Carlotta: Because Jessica is not as enthusiastic as she should be.",

        "Carlotta: So there's really no reason for her to be nervous. Excited, yes, but nervous?",
        "Antonio: Mami, it -- it's a big deal. It's a huge commitment.",
        "Carlotta: Are you going to tell me? Look, you may have been my nephew by birth, but you are and you always will be my son. When I made that decision to take you, to care for you, there was never any doubt that I was doing the right thing or that I wanted it more than anything.",

        "Blair: Well, maybe, maybe not, but he is going to take Evangeline with him because she pushed for it, and she kind of hinted that she would go to the police if he didn't.",

        "Starr: I used to like her.",
        "Blair: Well, she's not my favorite person anymore, but we should just forget about it, ok? The most important thing here is you may have a little brother out there that's alive, and that's great.",

        "Blair: I hope not.",

        "Starr: He says that, mom, but you know that he needs you.",
        "Blair: Well, what I need you to do is head out the door to school, ok? Here you go. And, Starr you did the right thing with Cole, and I know that it's hard. But it'll get better, all right?",
        "Starr: Go help dad. I know that you're worried about him.",

        "Blair: Were you eavesdropping?",
        "Jack: Just listening.",

        "Rex: No -- she came home, she was upset. I happened to be there. It was more about you going away with Todd than anything else.",
        "Todd: She's not going away with me. It's too dangerous.",
        "Rex: Well, then why are you going?",
        "Todd: Because I got to check it out.",

        "Todd: Spencer Truman.",
        "Rex: Spencer's dead. How could he tell you anything?",
        "Todd: It was in a letter Spencer mailed to Miles Laurence. Spencer's just trying to stick the knife in me a little deeper.",

        "Todd: I -- I can't hear that my son might be alive and just sit on it.",
        "Rex: I think it's a mistake, I really do. You went through hell when I gave you that death certificate telling you your son died.",

        "Todd: No. But I got to give it a shot.",
        "Rex: Then let me go to Chicago for you. I'm trained at this, I know how to track down a lead.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. Thank you, but no. I'm going to do it on my own.",

        "Blair: No matter who your father ends up with, no matter how many children he decides to have, one thing's not going to change, and that is he's always going to be your father, and he's always going to be your family. Your daddy loves you and Starr more than anything in this whole, wide world -- you got it?",
        "Jack: What about the other baby, if he's alive?",
        "Blair: Well, if that other baby is alive, then I'm sure your going to love that baby. But you know what? It doesn't mean that he's going to love you any less -- you got that?",

        "Tate: Yeah, thanks, but apparently Rex doesn't think so.",
        "Adriana: I don't think that's what Rex was upset about but I'll talk to him.",
        "Tate: Yeah, and I'll make sure I'm very careful about what I say to him. I had no idea the guy was so insecure.",
        "Layla: Rex? No, no way.",
        "Adriana: He's not insecure. He just -- well, he knows that you would make a play for me if I wasn't with him.",
        "Tate: Wait a second. You -- you told him I said that?",
        "Adriana: Of course I did. We don't have any secrets from each other.",
        "Tate: Well, no wonder the guy tried to beat the crap out of me. Although, I got to say, if it was me, I'd be flattered -- you know, that other guys think my girl's so hot.",
        "Adriana: Thank you, but Rex isn't like that.",
        "Tate: I get it. Anyway, I will let you know what the P.R. director from the TV station says about my cross-pollinating duties.",
        "Layla: Ugh. Ew.",

        "Nash: I don't have a dad. If I did have a dad, I would've talked to my dad, but I don't, all right? I needed someone to talk to!",
        "Jessica: This isn't talking, Nash. You're gathering your allies, and there's no way you're ever going to get my father against me!",
        "Nash: I'm not against you! How can I be against you? I love you, all right? And so I'm trying to find someone else who loves you to make you face the truth.",
        "Jessica: The truth is I love my husband and I love his daughter. I love her enough to adopt her and call her my own.",
        "Nash: I never said that you don't love her, and I know that she thinks of you as a mother.",
        "Jessica: And after today, I will be -- end of story.",
        "Nash: And you still prefer to do what looks like the right thing to do instead of the right thing to do.",
        "Jessica: What's right, Nash? You tell me. Would it be right for me to leave my husband and his daughter and come back to you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Why does Rex care if Todd's looking for his son?",
        "Adriana: Because Rex worked for Todd as a P.I. and he's probably just curious what he missed.",
        "Layla: That's -- that's got to be so hard to think your son is dead and -- and then to be told maybe not. I mean, I'm no fan of Todd's, but I almost feel sorry for him.",
