        "Dorian: Don't you have homework to do?",
        "Langston: I already finished it. Now, will you please explain to me what's going on in this picture?",
        "Dorian: It's not what it looks like.",
        "Langston: Well, it looks like you're making out with my uncle. So, um --",
        "Dorian: I want to talk to you about school. I just do not feel that the classes you're taking -- that they're challenging enough.",
        "Langston: You picked them out yourself.",
        "Dorian: Things can change.",
        "Langston: No kidding. So, what changed between you wanting my uncle dead and this kiss?",

        "Lola: You're my papi. You are supposed to say that.",

        "Lola: I just -- I just want to make sure.",
        "Ray: For what? The arroz con pollo?",

        "T\u00e9a: No. I am absolutely not all right.",
        "Viki: What happened?",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm assuming you haven't spoken to your impossible brother?",

        "Todd: \"Dear Starr -- \"",
        "Todd: \"I got your letter and feel bad about what happened between us, too.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, just -- just listen to me.",
        "Todd: What do you know? Cole was telling the truth about you.",
        "Schuyler: Cole? No. Whatever that kid told you is not true.",
        "Todd: You little pervert.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad? Dad, are you here?",
        "Zach: Twinkle, twinkle, little Starr.",
        "Starr: What did you just call me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Zach Rosen -- after all this time.",
        "John: Judging by the stash we found in his room, he's still living in the past.",
        "Marty: And you think he killed lee and Wes and attacked Blair?",
        "John: Well, we have to act as if he did. It's the only way to protect you and Blair.",
        "Marty: For how long?",
        "John: Until we find him, until we get the answers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: What are you doing here? How do you know my name?",
        "Zach: Oh, I'm a friend of your dad's.",
        "Starr: And where is he?",
        "Zach: Oh, he had to go out for a little while. Don't worry, he'll be right back.",
        "Starr: So he knows that you're here?",
        "Zach: Oh, yeah, yeah. He trusts me. We go way back. I'm practically like a brother.",
        "Starr: You do look a little familiar. What's your name?",
        "Zach: It's Carl, Carl swift. It's very nice to meet you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: Do you have any specials today?",
        "Markko: They're inside the menu.",
        "Lola: The last time I was here, I had the rabo encendido. I love things spicy.",
        "Markko: Can I get you something to drink?",
        "Ray: Coffee, thanks.",
        "Lola: I'm fine with water. Wait till you try it, it's so good.",
        "Ray: What was that?",
        "Lola: The food's great here.",
        "Ray: Is something going on with you and your cousin's boyfriend? Has something happened between you two?",
        "Lola: Yes, and if I have anything to say about that, it will happen again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Are you having an affair with my uncle?",
        "Dorian: Since when did you start speaking to me that way?",
        "Langston: Since when did you stop wanting my uncle dead?",
        "Dorian: He's living under the same roof. I tolerate him because I know that you want to have a relationship with him. That's all. Are you forgetting that I am a married woman?",
        "Langston: Only because you found out David is a Buchanan.",
        "Dorian: But that does not mean that David isn't a wonderful man.",
        "Langston: Who does hemorrhoid cream commercials. Yeah, Moe saw it on TV.",
        "Dorian: David is now a working actor, and that is not all glitz and glamour. It takes a lot of hard work.",
        "Langston: Which he does in L.A., and you're bored.",
        "Dorian: I'm nothing of the sort.",
        "Langston: Then why are you kissing a guy you're not even into?",
        "Dorian: I would never kiss a guy I wasn't into.",
        "Langston: Oh, so it was a real kiss? Hmm. Wait, someone caught you guys.",
        "Dorian: It was Jack, that little beast.",
        "Langston: Jack?",
        "Dorian: Yes, and there's nothing funny about it. Oh, no. He was trying to blackmail me, threatened to send this picture to David.",
        "Langston: Whoa, whoa. That's something Todd would do.",
        "Dorian: Exactly. Jack is a chip off the old block.",
        "Langston: You don't think that's what he'll be like when he grows up, do you?",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: Somewhere, there's a 10-year-old little girl happily riding her bicycle or playing with her dolls, and she's got no idea what she's in for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: He has really outdone himself this time.",
        "Viki: Well, that's a tall order.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, this is a new one, even for Todd. Trust me.",
        "Viki: Good, you warned me. What happened?",
        "T\u00e9a: He asked me to go back to the judge and to tell her that Blair and John's marriage was strictly an arrangement.",
        "Viki: So that he could get custody of his children.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Never mind that I'm representing Blair, and if I admit that I helped perpetrate a fraud upon the court, I risk disbarment. Hey, what's a little professional ruination between friends?",
        "Viki: Okay. That's awful.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I haven't gotten to the best part yet. Do you want to know what he offered in return for this little favor?",
        "Viki: Okay, what?",
        "T\u00e9a: He offered to give himself to me.",
        "Viki: Give himself? As in --",
        "T\u00e9a: In the biblical sense, yes. Where's the milk, in the fridge?",
        "Viki: Yes, it is. Hey, you're right. That's a new one.",
        "T\u00e9a: I thought I knew the dimensions of this man's ego, but does he actually think that I would really throw my career away just for the chance to hop in the sack with him? Not that there's any guarantee he would even go through with it. I mean, do I look that vulnerable? Do I look that desperate?",
        "T\u00e9a: What? I do? You don't think it's a crazy offer, Viki?",
        "Viki: Oh, it was definitely a crazy offer. Just when I think Todd can't surprise me any more, he pulls a new rabbit out of the hat.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, what then?",
        "Viki: I don't want you to take this the wrong way, okay? T\u00e9a, you were married to him, and you told me yourself that you're falling in love with him again.",
        "T\u00e9a: So, what are you saying, Viki?",
        "Viki: I think maybe the reason you are so upset over the -- ahem -- admittedly horrendous nature of this offer is because you might actually be willing to take him up on it if it gave you the chance to have something real with Todd again.",
        "T\u00e9a: Put me out of my misery now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Whoa, whoa -- you got the wrong idea. Nothing happened between me and Starr.",
        "Todd: Why are you writing her love letters, then?",
        "Schuyler: That's -- that's not a love letter.",
        "Todd: Is it homework?",
        "Schuyler: Okay, no, you're right, you're right. I'm a teacher, she's a student. But that's why I made it very clear to her that nothing is going to happen between us.",
        "Todd: Oh, you're blaming her for this?",
        "Schuyler: No, I'm not -- I'm not blaming Starr. That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Todd: Give me one reason why I shouldn't snap your neck right now.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, how about the fact that you killed my mother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay, thanks. Let me know if he shows up. Fish has a detail waiting at Rosen's motel room.",
        "Marty: Are they going to arrest him?",
        "John: Well, they don't have enough to take him in for questioning, but at least it gets him off the streets.",
        "Marty: When do they expect him back?",
        "John: So far there's no sign of him.",
        "Marty: But once they have him in custody, they'll let him go.",
        "John: Not unless we're sure he's the one who stabbed Blair.",
        "Marty: You know, for a guy in an arranged marriage, you're a very caring husband.",
        "John: You see what you're missing? Hey, look, I think I'm going to talk to the department, all right, and have them assign a guard to you.",
        "John: All right, then, at least I'm taking you back to your hotel.",
        "Marty: You don't have to do that.",
        "John: Yes, yeah, I do. It's the only way I can make sure you're safe until someone tells me they've picked up Rosen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It's nice to meet you, too, Carl.",
        "Zach: I've heard a lot about you. I know how much you mean to your dad.",
        "Starr: He said that he would be right back?",
        "Zach: Yeah, he had something important to do.",
        "Starr: Did he say what it was?",
        "Zach: Sorry, but you can hang out and wait for him if you want.",
        "Starr: Oh, no, no, no. I actually didn't come to see him. Have you seen his mail anywhere?",
        "Zach: Yeah, I think it's over here. Let me get that for you. It's all right.",
        "Starr: Wait, are you sure?",
        "Zach: Yeah, no problem. Here you go.",
        "Starr: Thanks. I just need to find something before my dad does.",
        "Zach: What, you're afraid you'll get in trouble?",
        "Starr: Oh, not just me. Oh, it's right here, and he didn't open it. That's good. You're going to tell him that I took this, aren't you?",
        "Zach: Hey, that is none of my business, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay, thank you. Because he sees me as his little girl still, and I'm not, because I've had to grow up.",
        "Zach: Well, anyone can see that, Starr. Anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I can get home on my own. And I keep telling you, Zach had his chance when he stabbed Wes. That is, if it is Zach.",
        "John: You know, who knows how this guy's mind works, all right? He did time on the inside, and he thinks you put him there. Look, I'm not trying to upset you; I'm just trying to get through to you. And I'm not taking any chances that this guy is finished with either you or Blair.",
        "Marty: I came here to see Blair.",
        "John: Why?",
        "Marty: Because I wanted to apologize to her. She might not have been attacked if you hadn't left her to come see me.",
        "John: Yeah, she remembers that.",
        "Marty: Oh, I know. She made it very clear it wasn't going to happen again, and then she waved the ring that you put on her finger.",
        "John: Yeah, well, she's tough. But you know, now she has security and probably half the hospital looking out for her, so it's your safety I'm worried about. Come on. I mean, are you really going to fight me on this?",
        "Marty: Can I ask you a question? Did part of you marry Blair just to screw Todd over?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I killed your mom? No. Your mom killed herself.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, because you blackmailed her. You blackmailed her. You had her so upset that she thought she was responsible for Starr's baby's death. That's why she died. That's why she died. She was -- she was protecting me, she didn't -- she didn't want anyone to find out that I was stealing drugs from the hospital because, yeah, yeah, I'm an addict.",
        "Todd: And a pervert. Quite a double threat.",
        "Schuyler: Hey, you know something? You know something? I've done a lot of things in my life that I'm not proud of, but at least I'm honest about them. And I never laid a finger on your daughter.",
        "Todd: But, you led her on, didn't you? This proves it.",
        "Schuyler: You think everyone is as much a liar as you?",
        "Todd: You know, Schuyler, even if I don't kill you now -- and we'll see -- you're going to go to prison. Do you know what they do to pedophiles in prison?",
        "Schuyler: You know what? I never touched your daughter! I never crossed that line. Excuse me.",
        "Todd: No, excuse me! \"You never crossed that line,\" is that what you said? Well, that's good to know. Which line is that, exactly?",
        "Schuyler: Which -- what -- what do you care, Manning? What do you care? You left all those lines in the dust a long time ago when you forced my mother to help you steal your daughter's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Wait, let me guess -- your dad's giving you a hard time about some boy.",
        "Starr: It used to be about a boy, but now it's about this older guy.",
        "Zach: A man.",
        "Starr: Nothing has happened. It's just that if my dad thought something had, or if he knew that I wanted it -- you know what? You shouldn't have to hear any of this. You don't even know me.",
        "Zach: You're right, I don't. But when I look at you, I don't see a child.",
        "Starr: You don't? How old do you think I look?",
        "Zach: Like a woman. Like a beautiful young woman -- which is why your father is so upset.",
        "Starr: What do you mean?",
        "Zach: You know, you're daddy's little girl. He doesn't want to share you with anyone else.",
        "Starr: So you think that that's it?",
        "Zach: Oh, I know it, especially with his history.",
        "Starr: What are you saying?",
        "Zach: You know, his issues with women are different than most guys, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Ugh. What is wrong with me?",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. There's nothing wrong with you. You think you are the first person who ever fell in love with somebody who wasn't good for them?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, me and the women who troll for husbands on death row.",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a, what Todd is asking is --",
        "T\u00e9a: Is not worth it.",
        "Viki: No. To sacrifice your career, something you've worked for your whole life, just for the chance to --",
        "T\u00e9a: His insults really are a work of art, aren't they?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: And yet, I just can't walk away from him.",
        "Viki: Maybe you're not sure that you want to.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, Viki, I have told myself a million times that Todd is a manipulative narcissist who will do whatever he needs to to get what he wants.",
        "Viki: Well, that's your head. What about your heart?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, when he made the offer, as offensive as it was, it made me remember when we were together. Todd was still a manipulative narcissist, but when we were together, I felt so alive. I miss that feeling, Viki.",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, is he a good kisser?",
        "Dorian: Langston, please.",
        "Langston: I bet he is.",
        "Dorian: It wasn't like that.",
        "Langston: You're really upset about this.",
        "Dorian: Well, of course I'm upset.",
        "Langston: Okay, so, how did it happen?",
        "Dorian: I don't know. It just sort of happened. Why am I even discussing this with you?",
        "Langston: Oh, so, what? Do we only have an open and honest relationship when it comes to discussing my issues? You think I'm too young to understand?",
        "Dorian: I just don't think it's appropriate.",
        "Langston: Well, neither is you making out with my uncle while you're still married. Okay, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. But, come on, who else do you have to talk about this with?",
        "Dorian: Yes, it's true. I would normally talk to Blair, but she's got a lot going on right now.",
        "Langston: Which is why I'm happy to fill in. So spill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Two orders of arroz con pollo.",
        "Lola: This looks delicious.",
        "Markko: Can I get you anything else?",
        "Ray: Not right now, thanks.",
        "Lola: Maybe later.",
        "Lola: What?",
        "Ray: You see how uncomfortable he is?",
        "Lola: He's just shy.",
        "Ray: Lola, Markko is your cousin's boyfriend. She cares about him very much.",
        "Lola: I'm not doing anything, papi.",
        "Ray: I have eyes, mija.",
        "Lola: It just happened, okay? You remember what abuela used to say? \"Lo que corazon desea lo desea.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Le coeur desire ce qu'il desire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Sometimes, the heart just wants what it wants. You know?",
        "T\u00e9a: Tell me, Viki, how do I stop my heart from wanting him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So you're going to make excuses for your mother? I think she probably offed herself because she found out you like to swim in the kiddie pool.",
        "Schuyler: That is not what happened.",
        "Todd: I think so. This proves it.",
        "Schuyler: You got a thing for letters, don't you? You like letters so much? You like letters? I got a letter for you. It's from my mother.",
        "Todd: Oh, really? What does she say? \"I'm sorry, Schuyler. I was such a lousy mom.\"",
        "Schuyler: All right, all right. You want to do this? You want to do this? You blackmailed my mother. You forced her to lie to your daughter. You let Starr go on thinking that her baby was dead while you wanted to raise it with some woman who didn't even know who you were. And then the plan was let your daughter keep on mourning and grieving forever while you took advantage of a woman you raped all over again. Is that about right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You really think I'd marry Blair just to get back at Manning?",
        "Marty: Well, you had to know it wouldn't make him happy.",
        "John: I really don't care what he thinks. It was about Blair and her kids being a priority to her.",
        "Marty: I know.",
        "John: I mean, it's not really a conventional marriage.",
        "Marty: Well, I'm the last person to say what conventional is.",
        "John: I did what I had to do. I got no regrets. Maybe one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: So, careful what you wish for, right, Manning? I'm mean, Starr's baby ended up dead anyway, so, whoops.",
        "Todd: Because of your mom.",
        "Schuyler: You know what, my mom had nothing to do with it.",
        "Todd: I see. Then why'd you burn the letter? Yeah, Starr told me. Apparently, she doesn't like you as much as you thought.",
        "Schuyler: Well, you know what? My mother protected me; the least I could do is return the favor.",
        "Todd: Oh, I see. So, this is your idea of an eye for an eye. You thought I killed your mom, and so you went after my daughter.",
        "Schuyler: I'm not going after your daughter.",
        "Todd: No, no, it's okay. I -- I understand. I see it very clearly now. When she walked into your classroom, you must have thought you won the lottery, huh? But can I tell you something? Nobody hurts my daughter and lives to tell about it. Nobody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So, how do you know my dad, again?",
        "Zach: Oh, from when we were young.",
        "Starr: How young?",
        "Zach: Not much older than you. That's when he started having problems with women. Boy, if he had known you back then --",
        "Starr: Why are you saying all of these things?",
        "Zach: What? I thought you wanted to know what I thought of you. You're beautiful, a beautiful woman.",
        "Starr: You know what; I am going to go now.",
        "Zach: Don't you want to prove to your father you're not a little girl?",
        "Starr: Who are you?",
        "Cole: Starr, get away from him. He's Zach Rosen. He raped my mom.",
        "Starr: Cole, what happened to you?",
        "Cole: Come on, we're going now. Come on.",
        "Starr: What did he do to you?",
        "Cole: Just keep walking!",
        "Starr: Are you all right?",
        "Cole: I'm fine, I've got you. He can't hurt us, all right?",
        "Starr: Are you sure?",
        "Cole: Walk, fast --",
        "Zach: Not so fast!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Marty: Sure.",
        "John: Hey, do me a favor -- sit tight, don't go anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You think that I would go after your daughter to get revenge on you? That's -- ooh, that's sick. That's -- that's really sick. That's so sick, only you could think of that.",
        "Todd: Why else would you give a girl her age the time of day?",
        "Schuyler: Because she was hurting, because she needed somebody to talk to.",
        "Todd: Man, don't tell me that she asked for this! Don't say that to me!",
        "Schuyler: Okay, all right. Okay, I confided in her, all right? I confided in her way too much, and that part was inappropriate, and you know what? You're right -- I take responsibility for that.",
        "Todd: Oh, you do? Oh, well, then great. It's -- problem solved.",
        "Schuyler: Nothing happened!",
        "Todd: Okay. I just want you to answer my question, please. Why did Cole tell me that he saw Starr leaving this apartment?",
        "[Schuyler sighs]",
        "Todd: And it looked like she was putting her clothes back on, in a hurry? And he also said it looked like you were doing the same thing.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Okay. She came to see me --",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm?",
        "Schuyler: And I made it very clear that it was not going to happen.",
        "Todd: Right. Like you did at the dance? Yeah. Cole told me about that, too.",
        "Schuyler: She kissed me, you know. But -- but I stopped it. And I got put on leave by the Board of Ed because of it.",
        "Todd: Well, Schuyler, if you think that's the worst thing that's going to happen to you for molesting my daughter, you're dreaming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: Daddy left his safe wide open!",
        "[Starr screams]",
        "Zach: Look what I found in it!",
        "Cole: Calm down -- all right, all right.",
        "Zach: I'd thank him, but -- let's just say he owed me.",
        "Cole: Okay, look, dude, just let us go, okay?",
        "Zach: Oh, let you go?",
        "Cole: Look, we have nothing against you, all right?",
        "Zach: Really? You just told your girlfriend that I raped your mother, and you've got no problem with me?",
        "Cole: Look, look, that was -- that was a long time ago. Everything's cool, all right?",
        "Zach: Right, and the minute you drive away, you call the cops. Do you think I'm stupid?",
        "Starr: Look, what do you want?",
        "Zach: Everything your entitled ass of a father got that I didn't -- now, move it!",
        "Starr: Okay, okay. Um -- we can help you. We can ask my dad for help.",
        "Zach: No, I already tried that and he told me to go to hell, so now we have to do this the hard way.",
        "Starr: But we can ask him again, please!",
        "Zach: I'm done asking your father for anything. I want you to explain something to me -- how come he got a pardon and I got to rot in prison? How come he gets rich, gets a family, and I get nothing? I don't have money or a big house in the woods -- or a beautiful daughter.",
        "Starr: And what do you want now?",
        "Zach: All of it.",

        "Ray: Markko told you he feels something for you?",
        "Lola: He didn't have to.",
        "Ray: But you told him how you feel about him, huh? Maybe you -- you showed him? And that he reminded you of his devotion to his girlfriend, your cousin?",
        "Lola: He wants me. Why else would he not tell Langston about what happened?",
        "Ray: Maybe because he doesn't want her to find out about her cousin's betrayal of her. Lola, you have always been a -- a good girl. Don't -- don't you see how wrong this is?",
        "Lola: Is it any more wrong than what you're doing with Dorian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I wish I had an explanation. I don't quite understand it myself. When your uncle started kissing me --",
        "Langston: You can't fight chemistry. I do have a boyfriend -- remember?",
        "Dorian: I hated your uncle, when he first came here and he wanted to take you away from us?",
        "Langston: But now you're kissing him?",
        "Dorian: It was a mistake.",
        "Langston: You don't really think that.",
        "Dorian: And how do you know?",
        "Langston: Simple -- you'd delete it if you didn't want to remember it.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Dorian: I was -- um -- kind of wondering. What would've happened if, uh, Jack had sent that picture to David.",
        "Langston: Well, that's easy -- there are two distinct probabilities. I mean, \"A\" -- he could rush home to fix things with his beautiful wife.",
        "Dorian: And \"B\"?",
        "Langston: He could tell you to go to hell. So I guess it really depends on which one of those two things you want him to do.",
        "Dorian: You really think you're smart, don't you?",
        "Langston: I'm a chip off the old block, too.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Langston: Look, whatever you decide, I just want you to be happy -- like I am with Markko.",
        "Dorian: Whew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: We're talking about you, not me. You begged me to stay here -- so I did, to give you some stability, yes, but also so that you could have a chance to become close to your family.",
        "Lola: What am I supposed to say?",
        "Ray: You can tell me my decision was not foolish, that you will not set your sights on the one boy who will break your cousin's heart.",
        "Lola: Fine.",
        "Ray: You'll stop?",
        "Lola: I said \"fine,\" didn't I? What else can I do?",
        "Ray: You can go into the kitchen right now and tell that boy that you're sorry, that from now on, you will leave him alone.",
        "Lola: Are you going to do that with Dorian?",
        "Ray: That is a completely different situation.",
        "Lola: How so?",
        "Ray: The two of them, they don't -- they don't even -- she allows him to live in California, doesn't even see him. How much could she really love him?",
        "Lola: She loves him enough to marry him.",
        "Ray: Whoa.",
        "Ray: I expect you to make a clean break with Markko. I'm not asking -- I'm telling you. Do it right now.",

        "Lola: I have to tell you something.",

        "Viki: My advice for -- ahem -- getting over someone is -- well, it's not very original, but it's tried and true.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'll take whatever you got.",
        "Viki: I think the best way to get over someone is to find someone new.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ah.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "T\u00e9a: You're right -- it is tried and true.",

        "T\u00e9a: I went out with Ray Montez.",
        "Viki: Did you? And?",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, people were wrong about him. He is a very sweet man -- and he's handsome, and he's available.",
        "Viki: And you feel nothing for him.",
        "T\u00e9a: Unfortunately, Viki, any man who shows the slightest interest in me I find vaguely repulsive.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "T\u00e9a: I mean, I am in love with a man who will only be with me if I compromise myself professionally by screwing up his ex-wife's custody agreement.",
        "Viki: It's a small comfort, but he has done worse.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thanks, Viki.",
        "Viki: What -- for what?",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not like I have a mother or sisters I can talk to. I really appreciate your friendship.",
        "Viki: Well, come on -- you were my sister-in-law. And I completely understand the problems of caring about Todd. I -- I still love him, even though I'm unbelievably angry with him for what he did to Jessica and Natalie.",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't imagine how that must've hurt you, Viki.",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah. Oh, it really did. But I'm still his sister. And unfortunately, I know all too well what he went through as a child. And so, I am drawn to him, you know, just as -- as you are, as someone who still --",
        "T\u00e9a: Wants him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I didn't molest your daughter, Manning. She let herself in here -- in the same way that you did, by the way. And you want to know why? Because she didn't have anyone to turn to. Her baby just died, her boyfriend's all messed up on drugs, and her -- well, we know what daddy's up to, don't we? We know what he did.",
        "Todd: And he could do a lot more. Did Starr tell you what I did to Cole when I found him in bed with her? He was lucky to walk the next day.",
        "Schuyler: Huh -- and you wonder why Starr is so messed up about men?",
        "Todd: And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Schuyler: Well, \"what is that supposed\" -- you did this to her. You're the one responsible for her falling in love with all the wrong guys and, yeah, she's been lucky. She's been really lucky so far, but who knows? Next guy might -- might come along and completely take advantage of her, you know, but that's going to be your fault, you sick son of a bitch!",

        "John: Excuse me. It's -- it's Cole. Yeah?",
        "Cole: All right, listen, Rosen. We get it -- you hate Todd, all right, but there's no point in keeping me and Starr hostage, especially here. What -- what happens when Todd comes home?",

        "Markko: What?",
        "Lola: I told papi that -- that I would change, that I would stop doing this and let you go.",
        "Markko: Well, good. That's -- that's good. That's really great, Lola, because Langston really cares about you.",
