        "Todd: Oh, great. It's Mr. Sunshine.",
        "Blair: John! It's always good to see you. Is this business or social?",
        "John: Actually, I'm here to see Kelly.",

        "Cole: Dude, how'd you know?",
        "Markko: These are for Langston.",
        "Cole: Ah. Peace offering?",
        "Markko: We made peace last night.",
        "Cole: So you're cool?",
        "Markko: Never better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Starr, no, I'm--I'm not breaking up with Ford. I'm breaking up with Markko.",
        "Starr: You can't be serious.",
        "Langston: Well, you're the one who said it--I have to end it.",
        "Starr: With Ford, not Markko!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: The court has noted Ms. Delgado's plea, but I would like to hear from her client. Mr. Joplin, do you plead not guilty by reason of insanity?",
        "Roxy: Go for it, Schuy.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm early for another hearing. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Schuyler: Wait. Gigi? I can't do this without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You got nerves of steel.",
        "Matthew: No, I just have to keep calm for my mom. My dad would want that.",
        "Rex: See, that's a Buchanan talking--always doing the right thing. I'd make a lousy Buchanan.",
        "Matthew: Not according to my dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: No, no, no, it's not a problem. I just wanted to make sure that you knew. Yeah, I'll make sure to let you know if we know anything, okay? Love you, too.",
        "Jessica: Mom?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. She's thinking about cutting her trip short and coming home.",
        "Jessica: What happens if Uncle Bo doesn't wake up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Nora: Bo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So what happened? I thought you and Langston were on the outs.",
        "Markko: Nope, we're good.",
        "Cole: So you thinking that she was someplace else--",
        "Markko: I was just all up in my head. Look. When you really care about somebody, you can drive yourself nuts thinking all kinds of crazy stuff when it's really not that at all. But thanks to you, I came back down to earth, so I owe you one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You can't break up with Markko.",
        "Langston: It was your idea!",
        "Starr: That's not true.",
        "Langston: You said, I have to choose.",
        "Starr: Not choosing Ford!",
        "Langston: Okay, look. Just because you don't like him doesn't mean--",
        "Starr: It's not even about that. It's that you're thinking about breaking up with someone who loves you for someone who can't even have a relationship with you.",
        "Langston: You don't know that.",
        "Starr: He is a player, Langston. He has a ton of girlfriends.",
        "Langston: Okay. Well, all I know is how I feel, and I--I can't give that up. I won't.",
        "Starr: What about when you lose everything? Because that's exactly what's gonna happen to you.",
        "Langston: What are you saying, Starr? If I break up with Markko, you won't be my friend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Have you heard from Matthew?",
        "Danielle: No. You?",
        "Destiny: Not a word.",
        "Danielle: Well, isn't your brother treating Mr. Buchanan?",
        "Destiny: And he won't tell me a thing. Doctor-patient confidentiality is so annoying. I'm Matthew's best friend.",
        "Danielle: Yeah, and I'm his--his friend, too. I mean, he needs us, right?",
        "Destiny: And they won't even let us in the waiting room of the ICU. What kind of rule is that?",
        "Danielle: The kind of rule that needs breaking.",
        "Destiny: I mean, it's not like we want to operate or anything. We just want to be there for Matthew.",
        "Danielle: So, you in?",
        "Destiny: We're breaking into the ICU?",
        "Danielle: Hell, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Eight years of medical school so they won't tell you what they don't know, which is pretty much everything.",
        "Matthew: Do you think this is what it was like for my dad when I was in surgery?",
        "Clint: Oh, no. It was worse. I mean, not as if I was there--I was stuck here in Llanview--but when it's your own kid? Oh, my God.",
        "Matthew: I think it's worse when it's your dad. I mean, no offense. A kid is young. But a dad...he could--",
        "Clint: Matthew, not gonna happen. Do you understand me?",
        "Matthew: Yes, sir.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Hey, Natalie. Jessica. How are you holding up?",
        "Jessica: Fine, thanks. Um, Dad just came back. I want to go find out if he--if he found out anything.",
        "Brody: Heh!",
        "Natalie: Brody, don't take it personally. She's 17 in her head.",
        "Brody: Oh, yeah. She doesn't remember you, doesn't remember me...and one of the few people she does remember is in the ICU.",
        "Natalie: Well, I hope something snaps her out of this soon.",
        "Brody: Well, it kind of looked like the two of you were making a little progress.",
        "Natalie: Heh! It'll fade. Soon as Uncle Bo gets out of the woods, then...she'll hate my guts again.",
        "Brody: Well, this has to change soon. I mean, it can't go on forever.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I hope not, because I just don't know if we're ever gonna have a decent relationship.",
        "Brody: You're her sister. She has to stay close to you. If she doesn't recover, I'll have lost her for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I should have called the union. They could have hooked me up with a pro bono attorney.",
        "Kyle: Oh, well, he's just a little preoccupied right now. You'll get used to it.",
        "Oliver: Will you stop assuming that we're gonna get custody?",
        "Kyle: Of course you're gonna get custody, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: How? I have no money for an attorney, no way to persuade a family court judge that I should keep her.",
        "Kyle: Ohh. Well, you are her father, and you're a police officer, and I think you're forgetting that your boyfriend's a saint.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, well, they're not gonna really care about that. She has an aunt who wants her who's a mother and has a kid and knows what she's doing. If I were the judge, I'd give her to Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: With all due respect, Your Honor, I came in by mistake. I don't think I should be here.",
        "Schuyler: No, Gigi, you really need to hear this because if it weren't for you, I couldn't do it.",
        "Judge: Mr. Joplin, your plea.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Uh, sorry. I'm guilty as charged.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey, bro.",
        "Rex: Hey.",
        "Natalie: \"Hey, sis.\" Somebody's got to remember who I am.",
        "Rex: She doesn't know what she's missing. You're the best sister in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Greg? Greg?",
        "Rex: Hey, what happened?",
        "Nora: Greg?",
        "Greg: Yes. What is it?",
        "Nora: He's awake.",
        "Clint: Nora, what's going on?",
        "Greg: Give me one second, please.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Clint: What's happening?",
        "Nora: Your brother's awake. Your father's awake. He's awake. Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You'd do that? You'd really give up on me?",
        "Starr: No. No, never. You're--you're like a sister, Langston. There's nothing you could ever do that would change that. You know that, right?",
        "Langston: It just seems like you're mad at me or--",
        "Starr: I'm not mad at you. I'm worried about you because you breaking up with Markko is gonna change everything.",
        "Langston: I know, but that's the thing. I can't keep doing it.",
        "Starr: Have you really thought it through?",
        "Langston: That's all I've been doing.",
        "Starr: Thinking about Ford?",
        "Langston: And Markko.",
        "Starr: And Cole?",
        "Langston: Cole?",
        "Starr: Markko's best friend, you know, my boyfriend?",
        "Langston: I know who he is.",
        "Starr: If you think that the 4 of us are gonna be able to hang out after you break up with Markko...life as we know it, it's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So how exactly did I bring you back down to earth?",
        "Markko: You told me to stop being so paranoid, to talk to the girl, which I did--not easy, by the way.",
        "Cole: Well, it gets easier.",
        "Markko: Yeah, I hope so. Anyway, I, uh, told her how much I was worried about her and how I felt, and it worked.",
        "Cole: So you guys are good?",
        "Markko: Better than ever.",
        "Cole: Wow. That's a first.",
        "Markko: What do you mean?",
        "Cole: Well, I'm not exactly the king of advice.",
        "Markko: Well, what about that girl, um, Hannah? You were holding her hand.",
        "Cole: I was not holding her hand.",
        "Markko: All right, you know what I mean. She seems like she's been doing a lot better since you got involved.",
        "Cole: All right. Look. I'm not involved, and as far as \"better\" goes, we'll see if she can give up on that jackass Ford and move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, I don't think Marty would appreciate you here sniffing around these Cramer women instead of taking care of her and John Jr.",
        "Elijah: Congratulations, by the way. Having a baby, it's a wonderful thing.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, like you'd know.",
        "Blair: Yes, congratulations. I'm happy for the both of you, John.",
        "Todd: Pbbt!",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Todd: If you believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you.",
        "Elijah: Well, if you'll all excuse me, I have to get ready for court.",
        "Blair: John, it's always great to see you. And, Todd, do not make me call security.",
        "John: You have a minute to talk?",
        "Kelly: Sure. Todd?",
        "Todd: Oh, no--yeah. Don't mind me.",
        "Kelly: Is this about my mom's death?",
        "John: I got a lead. I'm gonna check it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So when you're saying that he's awake, are we talking his eyes opening up or--",
        "Nora: Yes, yes, his eyes opened--",
        "Matthew: Is he talking?",
        "Nora: No, he's--he's got that thing in his mouth, so he can't talk, really, or anything, but he opened his eyes and looked right at me.",
        "Natalie: Does he know who you are?",
        "Nora: Yeah! When he opened his eyes, he reached out his hand--",
        "Jessica: Is he in any pain?",
        "Nora: I don't--I don't know. I don't think so. I think he's on pain meds. I don't know.",
        "Rex: Hey, how is he?",
        "Matthew: Is he talking?",
        "Greg: The good news is he's awake and stable. In fact, he's breathing on his own. I was able to take him off the respirator.",
        "Nora: Oh, that's wonderful.",
        "Matthew: Can I see him?",
        "Rex: Is he gonna be okay?",
        "Greg: He's lost a lot of blood, and he's just come through a major surgery. I mean, there's still a risk of infection.",
        "Clint: Look. Is he gonna pull through? Yes or no?",
        "Greg: Barring any unforeseen complications, I expect Bo to make a full recovery.",
        "Matthew: Yes!",
        "Natalie: See? I told you so.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you did, sis.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Judge, you can't listen to him. He's non compos mentis--",
        "T\u00e9a: Judge Thompson, if I might have a moment to confer with my client, please--",
        "Assistant D.A.: Her client made his wishes very clear, Your Honor.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but he doesn't know what he's saying.",
        "Schuyler: Yes, I do, Your Honor. Hey, I do. I think my...lawyer truly believes that I'm crazy or that I was, that I would have to be to do the things that I've done. And...you know, she's half-right. I've done some pretty unforgivable things. I denied my own daughter--I put her life on the line just because I was trying to impress somebody, to make her love me. And, uh, yeah, I--I lost myself a little bit. I lost my perspective. I lost my judgment. I lost everything that I worked for since I put the drugs down. But I knew what I was doing, Your Honor. I just...thought that it would be worth the risk. And, uh...yeah. I was wrong, and I deserve to be punished.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I thought you said you weren't sure you were gonna get involved. Did you speak to the authorities in California?",
        "John: Mm-hmm. We're in touch. I got this lead, and I want to follow up on it.",
        "Todd: Oh, we don't need your lead. I got my own lead.",
        "John: About the calls to Kelly coming from inside the institution? Hey, look. Why don't you do us all a favor and just leave this to professionals?",
        "Todd: The last time this professional was in charge, you got cozy with Natalie, Jessica got shot, and some stripper fell through some ice.",
        "Kelly: Okay. Todd, I'm really thankful for all the help you have given me, but John is better equipped and much less likely to get himself arrested, okay?",
        "Todd: Well--well, let me tell you, he's not exactly well liked among legal circles.",
        "Kelly: Okay. You are? What's next?",
        "John: What's next is I've got interviews scheduled with the staff at the institution. I'm flying out today.",
        "Kelly: Great. I'll go with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Here. Why don't you tell her what you just told me? Go ahead. Tell her-- tell her--tell her. Tell her that we can't possibly win custody, you know? That it's no use, that we might as well just give up and go home because we're not possibly gonna win custody.",
        "Oliver: I can't do that.",
        "Kyle: No. No, you can't. Look. Okay. I get that you're scared. Who's not scared? This little girl eats 5 times a day, and I can't even boil an egg.",
        "Oliver: Heh heh heh!",
        "Kyle: I live in a hotel, Oliver. There's no kitchen. I was up all night last night just trying to figure out where to get her breakfast.",
        "Oliver: Breakfast? We can pick her up some more formula at the grocery store.",
        "Kyle: See? You're a natural at this. You're good at it. You feed her, and I'll dress her. Then we just have to figure out how we're gonna get her home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Mr. Joplin, I need to make sure you understand the consequences of a guilty plea. There will be no trial. Once you admit guilt, you will be sentenced, and the charges you face carry significant prison time.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I realize that, Your Honor.",
        "Judge: Very well, then. I'll accept your plea of guilty as charged. You'll be remanded until such time as sentencing can be rendered.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, given Mr. Joplin's extraordinary degree of cooperation, I am requesting that he be allowed to remain at liberty until sentencing so that he be allowed to finalize his affairs.",
        "Schuyler: T\u00e9a, it's--it's okay. Ha! Uh, there's nothing I can't do from prison. So, you know, send me to Statesville.",
        "Roxy: I don't think you know what you're doing. Judge, do you think that we could have more time? I would like to get to know my son a little bit better before I got to say good-bye.",
        "Schuyler: Roxy, I can't. I can't go home knowing Bo Buchanan's in the hospital because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Can I go see my dad?",
        "Greg: Sure. For a few moments, okay? But, please, just one at a time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hi, son.",
        "Matthew: Does it hurt?",
        "Bo: Oh...if it didn't hurt after being shot and cut open, I mean, hell. How are you doing?",
        "Matthew: Me? Fine.",
        "Bo: You don't look so hot.",
        "Matthew: It just reminds me of when I was in the hospital.",
        "Bo: That was scary.",
        "Matthew: Yeah?",
        "Bo: It was the worst.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, well, Uncle Clint said...",
        "Bo: What did he say?",
        "Matthew: He said that when it's your kid in the hospital, it's the worst thing. But I think this is worse.",
        "Bo: I'm glad that he was there for you.",
        "Matthew: Well, I was mostly with Mom. I'm trying to keep her from, you know--",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. Just going after every living thing within a 5-mile radius. Ohh!",
        "Matthew: Dad?",
        "Bo: Ah, it's--it's okay. Only hurts when I laugh.",
        "Matthew: Dad?",
        "Bo: Hmm?",
        "Matthew: I'm really glad you're okay.",
        "Bo: Me, too, buddy. Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: So, why do I have to be the candy striper, again?",
        "Danielle: Because I look more like Matthew's long-lost cousin.",
        "Destiny: And I look more like his actual sister?",
        "Danielle: Oh, my God, you're right. Okay, you'll be the long-lost cousin, and I'll be the candy striper.",
        "Destiny: Why don't we just have him paged? \"Matthew Buchanan, come to the front desk.\"",
        "Danielle: Now, that's genius.",
        "Destiny: Glad we can agree on something.",
        "Danielle: Look. I'm really sorry for being such a bitch. It's just this stupid play. I mean, come on, who needs it? Our friendship is way more important.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Danielle: It's Matthew! Matthew?",
        "Matthew: Hey. I've got great news. My dad's awake. He's gonna be okay.",
        "Danielle: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Mr. G.: Girls?",
        "Danielle: Oh, sorry. Sorry. We just got some really great news.",
        "Mr. G.: Oh, it can't be better than what I've got here.",
        "Matthew: Dani?",
        "Danielle: Oh. Matthew? Oh, my God, I'm so happy for you. Can I call you back?",
        "Matthew: Ah, yeah, sure.",
        "Danielle: Okay, great. Sorry, Mr. G.",
        "Destiny: Is that the cast list?",
        "Mr. G.: It most certainly is.",
        "Danielle: Are we in it?",
        "Destiny: Of course we're in it. I'm Starr, and you're--",
        "Mr. G.: No, hang on. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I believe you're, uh...oh, here it is. Congratulations, Langston.",
        "Destiny: Langston?",
        "Mr. G.: And, Danielle, you'll be playing Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Well, I'm glad you guys worked it out because it was, uh--it was getting a little tense at home.",
        "Markko: Yeah. Sorry about that, but it's all good now. And all it took was a little honest communication. Who knew?",
        "Langston: You don't think that I'd do anything to keep us all friends?",
        "Starr: So work it out with Markko.",
        "Langston: I've tried, but it just doesn't change. He's either planning out my life or looking at me with those puppy-dog eyes and...I just--I can't take it anymore. It's not fair to him. He deserves to be with somebody who will appreciate him, not some girl who feels sorry for him and then turns around and cheats on him. No, I have to end this so that we can both start over.",
        "Starr: So that's it? You're really breaking up with him?",
        "Langston: Don't look at me like that. I love Markko, I do. He's the best. I just don't want to be his girlfriend anymore. And I--I just wish that there was a way to do that without breaking his heart.",

        "Bo: Do I look that bad, Balsom?",
        "Rex: No. It's just, that bullet was meant for me.",
        "Bo: There's always next time.",
        "Rex: I need you in one piece. Do you understand me?",
        "Bo: What, are you mad at me?",
        "Rex: Yes, I'm furious. You die, and I'm lost. So I'm better off taking the bullet, okay? So next time, how about I get shot and you feel like an idiot? Deal?",
        "Bo: How about next time, nobody gets shot and we all go out for a beer?",
        "Rex: That's fine by me...because this--this does not work for me. I don't want to see you in this bed again.",
        "Bo: That's because you love me.",
        "Rex: Not at--not at the moment.",
        "Natalie: Hey, Dad.",
        "Rex: I'll see you later.",
        "Bo: Can't wait.",
