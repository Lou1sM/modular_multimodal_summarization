        "Marty: Natalie? Hi.",
        "Natalie: Marty. Good workout?",
        "Marty: So-so. You know, just getting back in the swing of things.",
        "Natalie: Right. Good luck with that.",
        "Marty: Actually, look, I'm glad I ran into you, ok? I wanted to say I was sorry, you know, about what happened with John.",
        "Natalie: Well, Marty, chit-chatting about a workout that you don't need, fine and dandy -- huh -- but talking about my breakup with John -- not going to happen.",
        "Marty: You broke up with John?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Shouldn't you be in school, kid?",
        "Cole: I got a free period. You have a minute?",
        "John: Just as long as you're not here to talk about Manning, because I'm about to put that one to bed.",
        "Cole: Huh. Weird -- two police reports with my name on it.",
        "John: Don't make it a third. What can I do for you?",
        "Cole: I was wondering if you were serious about writing me that letter of recommendation so that I could play sports again.",
        "John: Yeah, I guess I was.",
        "Cole: Cool.",
        "John: Before I write any letter, there's something you got to do for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: No sign of Cole. You're safe.",
        "Starr: Ok. Four down, one more to go.",
        "Langston: Want to hit the girls' bathroom?",
        "Starr: Langston --",
        "Langston: Hide out till the bell rings?",
        "Starr: I feel freak-out coming on.",
        "Langston: Ok, ok, ok. 10 seconds -- go.",
        "Starr: Ok, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him! I hate this, I hate this, I hate this, I hate this! Give me -- [Starr screams]",
        "Langston: Ok. Ok, time.",
        "Starr: Why do I keep freaking out over this?",
        "Langston: Don't be such an overachiever. You and Cole, like, just broke up.",
        "Britney: Excuse me? Starr and Cole broke up?",
        "Starr: Yeah, and I bet that just makes your life, doesn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: What's wrong? Something wrong?",
        "Rex: It's -- Adriana -- we had a fight earlier.",
        "Marcie: Oh. I'm sorry. Was it serious?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Rex: It --",
        "Marcie: Oh, excuse me. I have to get this.",
        "Michael: No, that's fine. That's fine, honey.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: It's Tommy, isn't it? Somebody's connected him to Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Flight attendant: Sir, there's another passenger a few rows back who's willing to switch with you.",
        "Man: Perfect. Thanks.",
        "Todd: Jeez. What the hell?",
        "Blair: Hi, Todd.",
        "Todd: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Blair: The same thing you are. I'm going to help you find your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Admit it, Jessica, you chose duty over desire when you chose Antonio over me.",
        "Jessica: You sure of that?",
        "Nash: Yeah, I'm sure of that, and you chose wrong.",
        "Jessica: Well, then if you're really convinced of it, then why are we even having this conversation?",
        "Nash: Because I want to hear you admit it.",
        "Jessica: Well --",
        "Nash: I want to hear you admit that you wish to God that you'd chosen me over him.",
        "Jessica: Well, what if I said that? What would it change?",
        "Nash: You saying it's true?",
        "Jessica: Who cares what I wish, or what you wish happened, or what anybody wishes? You know, I -- I made a choice, and my choice was Antonio, so --",
        "Nash: Admit you made a mistake, and we can fix it.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: \"Yeah.\"",
        "Nash: We'll go to Antonio. We'll tell him that we love each other, because we do, that we want to raise our daughter together.",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Nash: Yes. Jessica, think about what our life would be like together. It would be beautiful. You could keep on writing, I'd run the vineyard, and Bree -- I'd build you a studio to do your work in. It would be beautiful.",
        "Jessica: Nash --",
        "Nash: Jessica, if you can't do it here in Llanview, we'll go somewhere else. All right? We could go to -- we could go to California. Mexico, Canada.",
        "Jessica: Canada?",
        "Nash: Yes, Canada. We could go to the moon, as long as we're together.",
        "Jessica: I can't.",
        "Nash: You can. All you have to do is admit that you chose wrong, and you can stop living a lie.",
        "Jessica: It's not a lie.",
        "Nash: It's not a lie? Being married to one man, and being in love with another one is living a lie. Every second that you are married to him, you are living a lie, and you're not just lying to Antonio. You're lying to me, you're lying to your family, you're lying to everybody, and you can't do that.",
        "Jessica: Nash, you're making things worse for me.",
        "Nash: How could things be any worse? I mean, this isn't a life. Denying your own feelings. Dying piece by piece every day. You want to know what would change if you admitted you chose wrong? Everything. And not just for you, but for everybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Natalie, John didn't run to me with the news of your breakup. You need to know that. And I'm truly sorry.",
        "Natalie: Anyway, so what were you saying that you were sorry about before?",
        "Marty: Oh, because the other day, I could tell I interrupted a serious conversation between the two of you. I know it was bad timing, but my son was missing and I was desperate.",
        "Natalie: Right. Right, and John would help. Of course he would help. I'm glad your son's doing better, by the way.",
        "Marty: Thank God we got to him in time.",
        "Natalie: Good. Well, I guess I'd better go start my workout.",
        "Miles: Marty? Why didn't you tell me what Todd did to your son?",
        "Marty: Why would I?",
        "Miles: You're right. We don't have that kind of relationship. But I have another reason to hate Todd Manning.",
        "Marty: No, please, just don't. My history with Todd is long and complex. You don't have a relationship with him yet.",
        "Miles: I care about you.",
        "Marty: I don't need you to fight my battles.",
        "Miles: There is that letter I told you about from Spencer.",
        "Marty: What about it?",
        "Miles: Part of it was about Todd. I just -- I hope I did the right thing by telling him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Did I ask you to come to Chicago with me?",
        "Blair: Where's your new girlfriend, Evangeline? Did you put her back in coach?",
        "Todd: No, she understood that I wanted to do this on my own. She's got class.",
        "Blair: Huh. Good for her. She can keep it. I got kids.",
        "Todd: What the hell does that have to do with you playing hooker -- or hooky or whatever you call it?",
        "Blair: Your son is Jack and Starr's half brother.",
        "Todd: Fine, so when I find him, they'll meet him.",
        "Blair: Todd, what if it's a trap set by Spencer?",
        "Todd: What if it is?",
        "Blair: Well, you're going to need backup.",
        "Todd: What are you going to do, sleep with anyone who looks suspicious? Huh.",
        "Blair: I'm not joking.",
        "Todd: You know, you don't even know Chicago. Evangeline did know Chicago, and I turned her down.",
        "Blair: Oh, Evangeline -- who cares? Big deal. So what?",
        "Todd: So I don't want or need you here. Get off the plane.",
        "Blair: I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Tell me, Rex. I need to know. Is somebody close to finding out Todd's connection to my son?",
        "Marcie: That was Principal Wexler. I told her that I would definitely direct the musical, and she wants me to go and meet with her and talk about things, you know. And then I have the study hall.",
        "Michael: Oh, that's great, honey.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Are you ok, heading home with Tommy?",
        "Michael: Yeah, not a problem.",
        "Marcie: You sure? Oh, good. Look, Rex, don't worry about the fight, you know? I'm sure it'll just -- it'll all blow over.",
        "Rex: The fight?",
        "Marcie: The one between you and Adriana. We were just --",
        "Rex: Oh, that -- growing pains. Just need to ride it out.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye.",
        "Michael: Bye, mama.",
        "Marcie: Bye.",
        "Michael: Tell me everything that happened, Rex.",
        "Rex: Ok, something came up.",
        "Michael: Yeah, what?",
        "Rex: Calm down. It's not a big deal.",
        "Michael: Well, what is it? Spit it out, Rex.",
        "Rex: Miles Laurence.",
        "Michael: Spencer's heir? He knows?",
        "Rex: Not quite.",
        "Michael: Well, then, what?",
        "Rex: Miles delivered a message from Truman to Todd, something about a clue about Todd's kid.",
        "Michael: Oh. My God. I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Rex: No, no -- relax. The clue's obviously bogus.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Rex: For one, it sent Todd flying to Chicago.",
        "Michael: Chicago?",
        "Rex: Hundreds of Miles away from you.",
        "Michael: Todd isn't going to find anything about you. He's going to find nothing -- nothing about you in Chicago. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What do you want me to do?",
        "John: Well, for starters, don't ever challenge a guy twice your size again.",
        "Cole: Huh. Got it.",
        "John: Good.",
        "Cole: I guess being benched from team sports has gotten me a little stir crazy.",
        "John: Well --",
        "Cole: Yeah, I know. I know, it was my fault for taking the steroids. But I'm clean now, you know. And I don't know what it is -- if I'm not running or -- or catching something, or hitting something really hard, it's like I can't think straight.",
        "John: Got to have those endorphins.",
        "Cole: Excuse me?",
        "John: Endorphins -- the chemicals your brain produces when you push yourself physically, you know? It makes you feel good. Runner's high, that kind of thing.",
        "Cole: Oh, but, see, it's more than that, you know, because when I'm on that field, I know exactly who I am. I don't have to think or talk --",
        "John: You don't have to explain yourself.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's win or lose, period.",
        "John: You only have to worry about you.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and, you know, if you get hurt, who cares? You figure out what's wrong, and then you fix it.",
        "John: It's kind of like being a cop, you know? The rules are pretty clear. The line gets blurred once in a while, but there's a pretty strong sense of what's right and what's wrong. Every question has an answer.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "John: So, this recommendation -- is there anything specific that your principal wants?",
        "Cole: Um -- yeah. It's -- it's more like a -- \"Cole's a saint and will never screw up again\" kind of thing.",
        "John: Uh-huh.",
        "Cole: No, I'm kidding. I was kidding. I mean, I don't expect you to lay it on that thick. You don't really even know me that well.",
        "John: Yeah, I don't really see sainthood, not yet, anyway.",
        "Cole: You know what I mean, you know? The school just wants to see that I get what's important.",
        "John: So what's important?",
        "Cole: You know, not cheating, sportsmanship.",
        "John: Come on, now.",
        "Cole: All right, you know what? The only thing important to me right now is Starr Manning. I mean, how am I supposed to get over her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Anything that knocks you down makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. So Cole dumping you definitely makes my day.",
        "Langston: F.Y.I., Starr's the one that ditched Cole, not the other way around.",
        "Britney: Oh, in your dreams.",
        "Starr: You know what, Britney? I don't care what you think. Because whatever happened between me and Cole is none of your business.",
        "Britney: Um -- wrong. Cole Thornhart is always my business.",
        "Langston: Go ahead. Keep trying. Watching Cole give you the smack down's become a real spectator sport.",
        "Britney: Ooh, so much pent-up passion. Starr, you should really help your little girlfriend and give her what she needs, and maybe I'll give Cole what he needs.",
        "Starr: You bitch!",
        "Britney: Excuse me.",
        "Marcie: All right, all right, ladies. What is going on here?",
        "Langston: Nothing, we're just practicing the great debate of 1860. History project.",
        "Marcie: Hmm, fancy that.",
        "Britney: Yeah, things really got heated up back in the olden days.",
        "Marcie: By all means, carry on.",
        "Starr: No, the debate is over.",
        "Britney: Well, anytime you want to practice, Starr, just call me.",
        "Marcie: Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Langston: We're cool.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Girl: What did I miss?",
        "Britney: Well, Cole is finally free, and I'm going to get him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Truman just wanted to send Todd on a wild-goose chase. Todd isn't going to find anything about his kid in Chicago, because he's right here with you.",
        "Michael: Tommy is not Todd's son, ok? He's my son. He's mine and Marcie's.",
        "Rex: Keep your voice down.",
        "Michael: What is Todd going to find out about my son in Chicago, Rex?",
        "Rex: All right, the couple who originally adopted Tommy --",
        "Michael: The ones who died in the tornado?",
        "Rex: The adoption agency they used was in Chicago.",
        "Michael: Wait a second, Rex. You told me that the lawyer -- the adoption lawyer -- was from Llanview.",
        "Rex: The lawyer, not the agency.",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Rex: But I'm sure Spencer just wanted to muddy the trail so that Todd and Margaret would never have a prayer of finding their kid.",
        "Michael: Well, you know, out-of-state adoptions are very common. Parents do it all the time. So -- I mean, if he's on the right track, how hard can it be for him to find the records?",
        "Rex: Ok, yeah, ok -- if any records still exist, they're sealed by law. Todd can't touch them.",
        "Michael: Why not? You did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If you don't mind, I'm going to go look for my kid -- my kid, not yours.",
        "Blair: The one that I said that I would promise to help raise.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, you're off the hook. You've been off the hook since you destroyed the relationship.",
        "Blair: He's not just your son, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yes, he's Starr and Jack's brother. We went over that already.",
        "Blair: Our children lost another brother. Our son. For some reason, I just feel connected to your child with Margaret.",
        "Todd: Get over it.",
        "Blair: It's living proof that -- that everything that we suffered wasn't for nothing.",
        "Todd: This is why I didn't want anyone to come with me. I don't need you filling me full of hope like this.",
        "Pilot: Flight crew, we are clear for takeoff.",
        "Todd: Oh, man --",
        "Blair: Here. Todd, hold my hand. Todd, hold my hand.",
        "Todd: Empty seats?",
        "Blair: You know, I don't like to fly like -- please hold my hand.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's too bad, Blair.",
        "Blair: Come on, Todd, I can't help this. Please?",
        "Todd: Get off the plane, then.",
        "Blair: Just come on.",
        "Todd: No, you should have popped one of your little pink pills, I guess.",
        "Blair: Oh -- I can't breathe. Oh --",
        "Flight attendant: Ma'am?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Flight attendant: I'm going to have to ask you to sit up straight during takeoff.",
        "Blair: Oh. Really? Come on! Hold my hand!",
        "Todd: Jeez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: The reason I was so conflicted about the letter was I didn't know if I should help someone as awful as Todd Manning.",
        "Marty: I see.",
        "Miles: But it contained information about a child.",
        "Marty: Todd's child? The one that Spencer said he killed?",
        "Miles: I can't believe he did something so horrible but the child could be alive.",
        "Marty: Wait -- is that what the letter said?",
        "Miles: Yeah, among other things.",
        "Marty: If that's true, it -- that's incredible.",
        "Miles: Yeah. I didn't want to betray Spencer's confidence, but a child is so innocent.",
        "Marty: Children need their parents.",
        "Miles: Even if the parents are as evil as Todd?",
        "Marty: You can't play God, Miles.",
        "Miles: I know. What you said the other day really helped me. It was the fact that you had the faith that I would do the right thing.",
        "Marty: Well, it sounds like you did, despite your feelings for Todd. I'm impressed. I got to go, so I'll see you around.",
        "Miles: I hope so. Mile",
        "Natalie: Hey, Miles, how's it going with Marty?",
        "Miles: It's not.",
        "Natalie: Well, I'm sorry. Hmm. I guess sometimes no matter how hard we want something, it's just not meant to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm going to let you in on a little secret, kid. You love someone, you don't ever get over them. You try to move on, and that's the difference.",
        "Cole: Yeah? How's that moving-on thing going with Natalie?",
        "John: How about none of your damn business?",
        "Cole: Sorry, that was a really crappy thing to say.",
        "John: Forget about it, all right? You came for a letter of recommendation, not Dr. Phil.",
        "Cole: No, I'm the one that brought up Starr. You see, the thing is, it seemed like we were doing everything together. You know, we were hanging out between classes, visiting her mom at the hospital. She was even helping me with biology. Homework.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "Cole: But even when we weren't together, you know, we'd be talking on the phone, or -- or texting. And when we weren't doing that, I'd be thinking about her.",
        "John: And now, you feel like you've been cutoff.",
        "Cole: How do I get her out of my head?",
        "John: You went from 60 to zero in two seconds flat.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Cole: Huh.",
        "[Phone stops ringing]",
        "Cole: Everyone calls me but her. Let me ask you something. How do you move on from someone that you -- you can't get over? You know, I don't know how to be that guy.",
        "John: Nobody's that guy. You do it because you have to.",
        "Cole: Ok, but how?",
        "John: Be one of the boys. You be a man, you know? You stand up, you do your job, you do your school, you do your sports, all right? You immerse yourself in anything you can.",
        "Cole: Been there, done that.",
        "John: Do it again, and do more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: That's not funny.",
        "Britney: Yeah, it's not funny.",
        "Marcie: Ok, everybody, settle down. I'm sorry to interrupt your study period, but I have a very exciting announcement to make. Actually, don't settle down, because I want you guys to get excited about this now, as your faculty advisor for this year's spring musical, I am beyond thrilled to announce that this year, we will be mounting a full-sized production of \"Oklahoma\"! Isn't that great? Well, I will be posting the audition sheets later today, but I wanted to give you guys a head start. So here you go, Amy. Just pass it around. Now, as you know -- and maybe some of you don't know -- the school musical is an opportunity to uncover your thespian talents. Yes? Yes, Britney?",
        "Britney: Well, I hear that Starr has a lot of lesbian talents, so I'm sure she'd love to sign up.",
        "Langston: You know what? She's such a little --",
        "Marcie: The word is \"thespian,\" not lesbian, and that was pretty lame. Now, what I was trying to say, before I was rudely interrupted, is that working in the theater is just -- it's fantastic. You know? You get to learn songs, and you get to learn dances! Oh, and the opening-night jitters -- there's nothing like it. There's the highs and the lows. There's nothing in the world like theater. It's just -- it's just an amazing opportunity. So, come on, how about it? Let's see who signed -- up.",

        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I made my decision.",
        "Nash: You made your decision. Well, now I got to make mine. Now, I -- I've tried this your way. I've tried staying away from you. I -- I quit a job that I liked so that I wouldn't have to see you around. I -- I made arrangements so that I could drop off and pick up our daughter without you having to see me.",
        "Jessica: We both --",
        "Nash: I take the long road into town from my cottage so that I won't have to risk the chance of me driving by you on the street. You're everywhere. You're in my daughter's face, you're in my dreams, and when I see you, I want you.",
        "Jessica: Don't say these things. Nash: Huh. I am no gentleman. That's -- I'm a pretty awful friend. Let's face it, when it comes to you, I have no shame. Hey, this feeling, it -- it'll pass.",
        "Nash: No. No, it won't, not as long as there is any chance of me bumping into you at a restaurant or in a park or you bumping me with your elbow or breathing on my neck. It won't pass. This is not something that time will help. The only thing that's going to make this better is if I put as much distance between us as possible.",

Nobody? Well, what about you, Langston, or you, Britney? I mean, you two really seem to enjoy acting. You were re- enacting the great debate of 1860 with enormous passion earlier.",

        "Marty: No, do you really want to destroy your future, and for what?",
