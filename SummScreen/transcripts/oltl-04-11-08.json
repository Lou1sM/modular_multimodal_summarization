        "Cole is getting very frustrated by the fact that Starr is obviously keeping a secret from him. And he blames it all on Todd Manning. Adriana is very unsettled about Rex's \"relationship\" with Shane. Todd wants to \"strike a deal\" with Gigi where they can cover each other's backs and go after Ramsay together. But she doesn't trust him. Rex is still always near Gigi and very protective of both her and Shane. Dorian tells Layla there is nothing to worry about. But Layla is concerned and realizes that Dorian obviously cannot fail to see the \"deception\" involving Rex and Gigi. Marcie and Michael are having problems. But Marcie is very enthusiastic about Rex and Adriana's wedding. She is also really friendly to both Gigi and Shane. Little does she know what is up. Ramsay is acting really nice to Antonio while John and Talia have good reason not to trust him. And Ramsay \"arranges\" for Antonio and his new partner to catch John and Talia in bed together at a motel."

        "Dorian: And no doubt about it -- we're going to bring hair and makeup people form out of town, because everybody we've got here in Llanview -- well, forget it. I'm so sorry, Rex.",
        "Rex: Oh, don't worry, I -- I know you weren't talking about Roxy. I know you didn't want her doing hair and makeup at her own son's wedding. I totally spaced. I got to meet Marcie and Michael at the diner. I'll see you.",
        "Dorian: Wait, wait! Rex, hello? This is your wedding we're planning.",
        "Rex: Sorry, ladies, there's too much estrogen in the room for me. I'll be gone all day, probably most of the night. Got a lot of legwork to do on a case. Feel free to stay. Help yourself to whatever's in the fridge. There's beer and olives -- look, I'll -- I'll see you.",
        "Dorian: But --",

        "Langston: Starr -- what are you going to do?",
        "Cole: Huh? Pretty brave fellow to fight me.",
        "Markko: Yah! Oh -- what? That was cheating.",
        "Langston: Right, dude. You're so ready to be a father.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Everything was going perfectly for Adriana. And then Gigi showed up in town with that child in tow.",
        "Layla: Rex isn't going back to his old girlfriend. Not after everything he's been through to be with Adriana.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Really? And just what has poor Rex been through?",
        "Layla: Well, you.",
        "Dorian: What? I'm sorry, but nobody is more committed than I am to seeing those two walk down the aisle, without incident.",
        "Layla: Well, I'm getting that, but I have to wonder why.",
        "Dorian: Because I love her. And I want her to get what she wants.",
        "Layla: Hmm. And suddenly that matters to you?",
        "Dorian: Where is this coming from, Layla? Why -- Adriana's made it very clear that Rex is the only man who can make her happy. Heavens knows why, but --",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Layla: I didn't think you had the guts to get back to the henhouse.",

        "Markko: You know, Missy Rickerd broke her ankle. Maybe you could try out for a spot on the girls' team.",

        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Langston: Hi.",
        "Cole: Where's Starr?",
        "Langston: She stormed off.",
        "Cole: Why, because she saw me?",
        "Langston: Maybe it's because her life sucks right now and you guys are acting like 8-year-olds.",
        "Cole: Langston?",
        "Langston: Not now, Cole, okay?",
        "Cole: Great.",

        "Marcie: So how are things going at the hospital?",
        "Michael: Well, it's the same. It's absolute chaos from the second I get there until the second I log out.",
        "Marcie: I think that sounds great.",
        "Michael: Why?",
        "Marcie: Well --",
        "Michael: Are you feeling a little bored, or --",
        "Marcie: No, I don't know that I would call it bored. I -- I can't focus. You know?",

        "Michael: There he is.",
        "Marcie: Oh, hey, Rex.",
        "Rex: Marcie -- sorry I'm late. I would have been here sooner, but Layla and Dorian were talking about pew flowers -- bows, flowers -- you know, it's --",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Marcie: You must be really excited, Rex.",
        "Rex: May 13.",
        "Marcie: Wow.",
        "Rex: Yeah, we just need to get the whole attendant thing nailed down. Oh, and my sources tell me that Adriana is going to ask you to be one of her bridesmaids.",
        "Marcie: I can't wait.",
        "Rex: She already asked Natalie and Layla, of course. Bo is my best man.",
        "Marcie: Well, wow, that's great.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I feel good about that. And Antonio's a groomsman. Which I'm fine with, but apparently, that sort of thing's normal for the -- the bride to get her brother on her husband's team.",
        "Michael: So what did you want to see us for?",
        "Rex: Oh. I thought I was being clear. I guess not, I'm sorry. I would like you to be one of my groomsmen, Michael.",

        "Gigi: A present? For me, from you?",

        "Gigi: Hmm.",
        "Todd: Don't get excited.",
        "Gigi: I don't want anything from you.",
        "Todd: Yes, I know. You're all \"single mom, hear me roar\" crap, right? Ahem. But you do need me.",
        "Gigi: Is that your gift? Your help?",
        "Todd: No, it's a document that I have signed, and I would like you to do likewise.",
        "Gigi: Well, sure. That'll happen.",
        "Todd: Here you go. Give it a read. You'll like what I've done. I have documented every single illegal act that Ramsey has committed. Sign it. And just make sure that you find a notary somewhere in the building, and make it all legit.",
        "Gigi: Are you high? I am not signing anything you wrote.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but look -- listen. Everything that Ramsey has pulled is in there. So if you sign it, I sign it, we back each other up, it's like an insurance policy. So if he comes after me, you go to the cops, he comes after you, I do the same.",
        "Gigi: If he comes after me, my son's an orphan.",
        "Todd: But if he's in jail, he can't touch your son.",
        "Gigi: I am not lining up with you. Ramsey could get wind of it, and he'd go after Shane, and I am not letting that happen -- not again.",
        "Todd: You didn't get very far in school, did you, Gigi? Okay, I'll start over and I'll speak a little slower. If Ramsey thinks he has power over us -- just thinks it -- he actually does. You get it?",
        "Gigi: How does this help me? This is just a piece of paper that only you and I know about. You can't be serious. You're going to tell him?",
        "Todd: I already did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Michael, what do you mean, you can't do it?",
        "Rex: Dude, I'm the one who's supposed to get cold feet.",
        "Michael: Rex, I really appreciate you asking me to stand up for you at your wedding, but I'm working all kinds of hours at the hospital.",
        "Marcie: Well, honey, you can -- you know, you can ask for one night off.",
        "Michael: No, I was just reinstated, and can't ask for any favors.",
        "Marcie: Well, then if you get scheduled to work that one night, can't you just ask --",
        "Michael: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: Someone to switch with you?",
        "Michael: I don't want to commit to being in a wedding if I think that there's a chance that I can't be there. I'm really sorry.",
        "Rex: No problem. No, I understand. Thank you.",
        "Michael: All right, I have to get back to the hospital.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael: Um -- I'll probably -- I won't be home till really late.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Rex: You want to tell me what that was all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Hmm, did Rex say where he was going?",
        "Dorian: He said he had a meeting.",
        "Layla: With Michael and Marcie, and that he had to work late tonight.",
        "Adriana: And that's all he told you?",
        "Layla: He was kind of anxious to get out of here. Too many wedding details.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Adriana: Really?",
        "Layla: Uh-huh.",
        "Adriana: You know something.",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Adriana: Come on.",
        "Layla: It's nothing.",
        "Adriana: What's \"nothing\"?",
        "Layla: I don't think it's a big deal, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Layla?",
        "Layla: You know Jocelyn, the buyer at the new boutique on River Street?",
        "Adriana: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Well, she's got a daughter.",
        "Adriana: And?",
        "Layla: And I bumped into her today. And she told me she dropped her kid off this morning at school and she saw Rex there.",
        "Adriana: Come again?",
        "Layla: She went up to him, introduced herself, and told him that she knows you through me.",
        "Adriana: Rex was dropping Shane off at school with Gigi, wasn't he?",
        "Layla: No, no. Rex and Shane were alone. He told her he was doing a favor for a friend.",
        "Adriana: Beautiful. Can one of you explain to me why it is that Rex cannot stay away from Gigi's kid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You told Ramsey I signed off on something I just found out about five minutes ago?",
        "Todd: It's a brilliant idea, Gigi. You're protected now.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm in good shape now. I swear on my life, Todd --",
        "Todd: Ramsey now knows --",
        "Gigi: If something happens to my son --",
        "Todd: That if -- if something happens to your son, if something happens to one of us, the other blows the whistle.",
        "Gigi: Oh, really? Well, what happens when Ramsey decides to take us both out at the same time, hmm?",
        "Todd: It's taken care of. I've thought of everything. I'm a genius. Okay? He's neutralized. You and your kid are safe. A thank-you would be nice now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Yeah, okay. You sure that's his name? Perfect. All right. I'll call you back. Commissioner?",
        "Ramsey: My office, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Eddie: The commissioner's been looking for you both. Did he find you?",
        "John: No, he must have changed his mind.",
        "Eddie: Or maybe he thought you were busy doing something else.",
        "Talia: You got something to say to me, just say it, Eddie.",
        "John: Let it go.",
        "Talia: No. I'm tired of this guy's asinine little comments. I mean, what is this, the second grade? Excuse me.",
        "John: You know, I would -- I'd watch my back with her if I were you.",
        "Eddie: You would, huh?",
        "John: Yeah. We both know in a fight, she'd kick your ass.",
        "[Officers laugh]",
        "Eddie: Shut up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I got a new line on o of the dealer's contacts. He could take us straight to the supplier. I could make the collar tonight.",
        "Ramsey: No, farm it out. I've got another assignment for you and Eddie.",
        "Antonio: You do?",
        "Ramsey: I'm still working on the particulars. I'll let you know. That's all.",
        "Talia: You were just in with Ramsey?",
        "Antonio: You saw me come out of his office.",
        "Talia: Huh. What did he want?",
        "Antonio: I was briefing him on the case I was working on.",
        "Talia: The one I was on?",
        "Antonio: Apparently.",
        "Talia: But that case is dead. He just pulled me and John both off of it.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, obviously, it's still open.",
        "Talia: Okay, do you think maybe you could look at me when you talk to me? This isn't working. This --",
        "Antonio: \"This\" being?",
        "Talia: I have something that you need to hear, from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Rex --",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Marcie: Things have been really hard between Michael and me since got back to Llanview.",
        "Rex: When you got the light sentence, I was hoping things could start getting back to normal.",
        "Marcie: What's \"normal,\" Rex -- what's \"normal\" is Michael, me, and Tommy.",
        "Rex: Listen, I -- I understand that, but you and Michael were so much in love before you knew that Tommy even existed.",
        "Marcie: We still love each other. Rex, we do, okay? We -- oh, God -- look, we lied to each other, okay? About so many things. And now that everything is over, it's just -- well, it's sinking in.",
        "Rex: Yeah, that was my fault.",
        "Marcie: How?",
        "Rex: I told Michael not to tell you about Todd being Tommy's father.",
        "Marcie: Oh, Rex, please -- I'm over that, okay?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: You think Michael knows that?",
        "Marcie: We used to talk about everything.",
        "Rex: Hmm.",
        "Marcie: Anything that happened to me, Michael was the first person I wanted to talk to, but now -- you know? I mean, that was when we -- when we trusted each other, and when we thought we had this big, bright future.",
        "Rex: Marcie, you can still have that.",
        "Marcie: Just not the same future. Look, let's talk about happy things, can we, please? Like let's talk about your wedding. Right?",
        "Rex: I can't. I -- I got to go. I have to work over at B.E.",
        "Marcie: Oh.",
        "Rex: I can give you a ride home, if you want.",
        "Marcie: No, I can't. I'm meeting Shane.",
        "Rex: Really?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Rex: Gigi okay?",
        "Marcie: Oh, yeah, she's fine. She's just working late, and she knows that I like spending time with Shane.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I had to take Shane into school because she had to go into work early.",
        "Marcie: Oh.",
        "Rex: Why is she putting in so many hours?",
        "Marcie: It's a good job. She wants to do well for Shane.",
        "Rex: Good she has us to back her up.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. I think it's great, you know, that you two don't have any \"stuff\" left over that might get in the way of your being friends.",
        "Rex: Yeah, it's great. You take care of yourself.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Rex: And don't give up.",
        "Marcie: Thanks, Rex.",
        "Rex: Tell Shane I said hi.",
        "Marcie: I will.",
        "Marcie: Hello, Langston.",
        "Langston: Mrs. McBain?",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Langston: Hi.",
        "Marcie: Are -- are you waiting for Starr?",
        "Langston: I'm supposed to. I -- I don't know where she is.",
        "Marcie: Okay, well -- um -- you know, maybe when you see her, you can tell her something for me. Uh -- I think she owes me an apology.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Darling, don't overreact. Rex dropped the kid off at school as a favor to an old friend.",
        "Adriana: Why does he have to be in their lives?",
        "Layla: It could be totally innocent.",
        "Adriana: Gigi is working Rex. I know she is.",
        "Dorian: How can she work him? You are marrying him. She knows that.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Layla: Uh -- this is Michelle. It's about your dress. Excuse me. Hey, Michelle, what's up?",
        "Adriana: We might have to put my dress on hold.",
        "Dorian: Honestly, I -- I don't know why Layla upset you like that.",
        "Adriana: What was she supposed to do? Keep quiet about Rex taking care of Gigi's kid?",
        "[Adriana sighs]",
        "Dorian: Why are you so worried about a girl that Rex hasn't given a thought to in years?",
        "Adriana: Because she's here, with a kid who needs a daddy.",
        "Dorian: Is that why you came back from Paris without notice? Because you were hoping to catch Rex with Gigi?",
        "Adriana: He's not \"with\" Gigi. At least he better not be.",
        "Layla: Oh, Michelle said the dress is spectacular.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Adriana: Rex was so anxious to leave that he forgot his phone? I'm going to go find him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Thank you -- for getting me knee-deep in this mess.",
        "Todd: No, that honor goes to your nut-job friend Marcie for kidnapping my son.",
        "Gigi: I am not getting into it with you about Marcie right now.",
        "Todd: Come on, you're mother. She had kept me from my son for months -- illegally. You know that's not right.",
        "Gigi: She thought she was doing what was right for Tommy.",
        "Todd: \"Sam\"! That's his name! He's not her kid, he's my kid. Always been my kid.",
        "Gigi: Just so you know, when I found out what she was doing in Texas with Tommy, I was upset about it, and I told her so.",
        "Todd: But you still helped hide her, didn't you? And here I am, helping you and your kid! Why the hell am I bothering with you?",
        "Rex: What the hell is going on?",
        "Todd: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What do you want to say?",
        "Talia: I -- um --",
        "Antonio: What? What is it, Sahid? Spit it out.",
        "Talia: I saw Jamie this morning. I went to the diner to get some coffee, and she was there with your mom.",
        "Antonio: What happened?",
        "Talia: She asked me when I was coming by the loft. The thing is, I was -- I was teaching her how to braid her hair, and I was just wondering if --",
        "Antonio: I don't think so, Sahid.",
        "Talia: Okay, I -- you know, I didn't promise her anything. Uh -- just thought you might want to know in case she mentioned it.",
        "Antonio: I'll call my mother at the diner before she puts her to bed. If she mentions it, I'll -- I'll let her know.",
        "Talia: You -- you're working a double?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, why?",
        "Talia: Um -- fine. I mean, no reason. No reason.",
        "John: You okay? Hey.",

        "Ramsey: Yeah?",
        "John: I got your memo about reviewing my case files before I close them.",

        "Antonio: Usually, yeah.",
        "Ramsey: You're lucky to have family to help you that way. A father needs somebody -- he needs to know who's taking care of his child. So, listen, I've firmed up your assignment for you and Eddie tonight.",

        "Langston: Are you sure?",
        "Marcie: No. But if I was thinking about myself, Tommy and I would still be on the run. When you have a kid, you have to stop thinking about what you want and start thinking about what they need, and I don't want Tommy to be the rope in a tug of war anymore.
