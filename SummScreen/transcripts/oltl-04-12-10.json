        "At the custody hearing, Gigi tells the judge she does not plan to fight Oliver and Kyle for custody and believes that they should have the right to raise Oliver's daughter. At that point, the judge rules in their favor. Langston is ready to admit to Markko that she is breaking up with him. But she never gets a chance when he is ready to plan a big date and Dorian comes by and tells her how lucky she is to have Markko. Meanwhile, Ford has forgotten all about Langston and is sleeping with the pizza girl. Starr reveals to Cole that they have broken up and he is very disenchanted. Destiny is disappointed to have gotten the role of Langston instead of Starr in the musical. And Matthew is similarly disappointed to get the role of Markko instead of Cole. Dani gets Starr and a new boy gets Cole. Bo proposes to Nora. At first she says no, but he convinces her to take the leap of faith. Brody is trying to get back what he had with Jessica, but she is still clearly disinterested in him."

        "Markko: So pick a film, and I'll get the lights.",
        "Langston: No, Markko. I need to talk to you.",
        "Markko: What? What's up?",
        "Langston: Lately, I've...I've been laying awake at night, thinking about...",
        "Markko: Lang, hey. Whoa. You're freezing.",
        "Langston: Am I?",
        "Markko: Yeah, and you look a little pale, even for you. Sit down. I'll get you a blanket.",
        "Langston: No, don't.",
        "Markko: And some hot tea.",
        "Langston: No, Markko, stop being so nice to me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: Glad you came back for more. You ordered a large?",
        "Ford: Yeah, I did, because your last delivery was delicious--just the way I like it.",

        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Cristian: Hey, beautiful. What's up?",
        "Layla: There was this huge cheer at the station when we heard Bo had pulled through. All these tough cops crying. They were so happy.",
        "Cristian: Bo's family must be so relieved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You've owed me that date for a while.",
        "Jessica: Now? You want me to go out with you now?",
        "Brody: Well, not this minute. Tonight.",
        "Jessica: It didn't count. I mean, it was a game. We were playing around, right?",
        "Brody: Yeah, we've played. I won. What time should I pick you up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I can't believe I'm playing Markko.",
        "Dani: Yeah, right. You should have been Cole.",
        "Matthew: I guess we'll be scene partners, then.",
        "Destiny: No offense, but this still sucks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Nora...I just asked you to marry me.",
        "Nora: Yeah. I think it's the drugs talking.",
        "Bo: No, it's just me. It's the guy who loves you.",
        "Nora: You've only been awake for about an hour.",
        "Bo: I'm through wasting time. Do you love me?",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. You know I do.",
        "Bo: Then marry me. Say yes, Red.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Henson: I understand the parties are all present.",
        "Eli: Yes, they are, Your Honor.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ready to proceed, Your Honor.",
        "Judge Henson: Good. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to establish custody of the minor child Sierra Rose Morasco. We'll begin with the plaintiff.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor.",
        "Judge Henson: Ms. Delgado?",
        "T\u00e9a: My client, Schuyler Joplin, has instructed me to withdraw his objection to the suit.",
        "Judge Henson: Why the turnaround?",
        "T\u00e9a: It's come to light that Schuyler Joplin is not the baby's biological father.",
        "Judge Henson: Do we know who is?",
        "Oliver: I am, Your Honor. Sierra's my daughter.",
        "Judge Henson: Who are you?",
        "Oliver: Oliver Fish, Your Honor.",
        "Judge Henson: And I assume this is the little girl in question?",
        "Oliver: Yes. I just found out that Sierra is my daughter.",
        "Judge Henson: And what makes you think you're the father?",
        "Oliver: I have a DNA test, Your Honor.",
        "Judge Henson: Bailiff. Where's your lawyer?",
        "Oliver: I didn't have time to get one. I just found out, like I said, and we needed a crib and diapers and everything, and Sierra needed a lot of rest. She's had a pretty intense few days. I don't know if you've read the papers. And I didn't want to leave her side, even for a second, you know? So, no, I don't--I don't have one, but I can get one if I need to, and I stopped by today. I filed to have the birth certificate officially changed, listing me as the father.",
        "Judge Henson: So the child has been living with you.",
        "Oliver: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Judge Henson: Were you aware of this?",
        "Eli: We were made aware yesterday that the baby was staying with Officer Fish temporarily. However, that does not change our position regarding custody at all.",
        "Judge Henson: Are you looking for full custody of this baby?",
        "Oliver: She's my child.",
        "Judge Henson: But are you prepared for this? Fatherhood?",
        "Oliver: Yes, Your Honor. I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Bo: Okay? I mean, is that okay, is that a yes?",
        "Nora: No, that's an aha. I get it. You got shot.",
        "Bo: Yeah. I almost died.",
        "Nora: Oh, don't say that. Don't say that.",
        "Bo: It's true.",
        "Nora: I know.",
        "Bo: And you should be nice to me.",
        "Nora: Ha ha ha!",
        "Bo: You should grant me my every wish.",
        "Nora: You don't have to do this, you know.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: Propose. You're gonna be fine. Didn't you hear Greg? You're gonna live for a long time.",
        "Bo: I hope so.",
        "Nora: Well, you will, and you're not running out of time.",
        "Bo: We are all running out of time. I just got the big reminder of that. We're not gonna live forever, Red.",
        "Nora: Well, this is romantic.",
        "Bo: What do you want? Flowers or candy or--",
        "Nora: No, no, no.",
        "Bo: Do you know what I kept thinking about after I got shot?",
        "Nora: Uh, to breathe and not to bleed.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, there was all that, but all I could think of, when I could think, was, \"If I die now, I'm gonna be really pissed.\"",
        "Nora: Well, just for the record, I would have been pissed, too.",
        "Bo: No, no, but I would have been mad at myself for not marrying you when I had the chance. That would have been my biggest regret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: This is just--you know, it's really bad taste. My Uncle Bo nearly died. This is hardly the time that you and I should be talking about dating.",
        "Brody: Your Uncle Bo is gonna make it, and I guarantee if you asked him, he'd tell you to go.",
        "Jessica: I know, I know. Everybody loves you. Whoopie doo.",
        "Brody: You want to find out why?",
        "Jessica: Oh, no. I was supposed to be at school, like, an hour ago to paint the set, so I have to go. Bye.",
        "Brody: You're gonna have to do a lot better than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: This is beyond wrong.",
        "Dani: Look, if you have a problem with casting, you should take it to Mr. G.",
        "Destiny: I know where to take it, after I get a mochachino to calm me down.",
        "Matthew: Looks like Destiny's not too happy to work with me.",
        "Dani: Oh, I doubt it. She just didn't want to play Langston.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Stop being so nice to you? Is that what you just said?",
        "Langston: No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound so--",
        "Markko: Crazy?",
        "Langston: Harsh.",
        "Markko: Look, you sit down; let me make you feel better.",
        "Langston: Oh, Markko, no. I need to talk about this. It's been eating at me for days, weeks.",
        "Markko: Keeping you awake, yeah. You said, and I noticed.",
        "Langston: No, it's--it's tough, Markko. It's really hard stuff.",
        "Markko: Then let me help you.",
        "Langston: You can't. This is my problem. It's all on me.",
        "Markko: What?",
        "Langston: Lately I've been thinking about my future and how things are gonna be.",
        "Markko: Oh, I know where this goes.",
        "Langston: You do?",
        "Markko: You think I didn't lay awake and worry, too? It'll be easier than you think.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Markko: College. You think it's the future, that it's this totally different world, and it is, but it's manageable, and you are so smart. You're gonna do great.",
        "Langston: I'm not worried about college, Markko.",
        "Markko: Then what?",
        "Langston: Like I said, I have been thinking a lot about--",
        "Dorian: Bonjour! Oh, I thought you'd be at school. Am I interrupting anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Markko was just here, telling me what a great time he and Langston had last night.",
        "Starr: I know. She said.",
        "Cole: No, they worked things out. They're good.",
        "Starr: And Markko told her how much he loves her and how he wouldn't be able to live without her? I heard.",
        "Cole: So she's breaking up with him. That makes no sense. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey. Dr. Lord, we were just in the middle of something.",
        "Dorian: Don't worry. I'll be gone in a jiffy. I just wanted to drop these off for you. Un, deux, trois, quatre.",
        "Langston: What are those?",
        "Dorian: Tickets to the show tonight at Ultraviolet.",
        "Markko: No way! That's been sold out for weeks.",
        "Dorian: I know. Just one of the many perks of being mayor. The two of you have been working so hard, I thought you could use a break.",
        "Langston: You really shouldn't have.",
        "Dorian: And the extra pair--how about for Starr and Cole? I'll even volunteer to baby-sit.",
        "Langston: They'll love that.",
        "Dorian: And what about you, dear?",
        "Langston: That's a really nice gesture, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Markko, I think I need to talk to my daughter alone. Do you mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What's going on with Langston?",
        "Starr: It's not just Markko. There's more to it.",
        "Cole: Well, I'd hope so, but what?",
        "Destiny: Dream killer.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Destiny: You wanted to give your sister a break. I respect that, but not with my part.",
        "Starr: No clue.",
        "Destiny: You convinced Mr. G to cast Danielle as you in the musical instead of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Will you be okay working with Destiny?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. She'll get over this.",
        "Dani: I'm sorry you're not playing Cole.",
        "Matthew: Well, who is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Sounds good, babe. Okay. I'll see you soon. Love you. Hey, I heard Bo's gonna make it.",
        "Jessica: I know. We were so worried. We thought we were gonna lose him.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I'm glad it's good news. Brody.",
        "Jessica: What are you doing here?",
        "Brody: You didn't think I'd let you off the hook that easily, did you?",
        "Cristian: What's up?",
        "Brody: Oh, Jessica owes me a date, and she's trying to weasel out of it.",
        "Jessica: I'm not weaseling, I'm working. We have to get this entire set painted by tonight.",
        "Cristian: You know what, Jess? We have to let the base coat dry first before we can move on.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah, and I was about to take off for the night anyway. You're free. You guys have a good time.",
        "Brody: See you later, Cris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Henson: Are you married, Mr. Fish?",
        "Oliver: Uh, I'm gay, Your Honor, but I have a partner, and we are fully committed to one another, and he's with me 100% on this.",
        "Judge Henson: Are you his partner?",
        "Kyle: Yes, Your Honor. Kyle Lewis.",
        "Judge Henson: And you fully support your partner's desire to raise his child?",
        "Kyle: Absolutely. We're both really excited about it.",
        "Judge Henson: This baby got off to a rough start. She was born in a cabin.",
        "Eli: Yes, Your Honor. My client delivered her sister's baby, and she saved her baby's life.",
        "Judge Henson: She had a heart condition that required surgery. She's got some hefty medical bills.",
        "Oliver: I have medical insurance. I am a police officer, and I have a pretty good plan, and we'll have a doctor right at home.",
        "Kyle: I--I graduate from medical school soon.",
        "Judge Henson: So you're in med school full-time, and you're a police officer full-time.",
        "Oliver: Your Honor, I know it'll be a challenge, but we can do it. I swear to you, this baby will have everything that she needs, especially--especially love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I love you, Bo Buchanan. We are together. We're committed. Nothing's gonna change that.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Nora: Do you?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Okay. Then why?",
        "Bo: So our son can say that his parents are married.",
        "Nora: Ha ha ha! Come on. You don't really think Matthew cares about that.",
        "Bo: I do. I'm old-fashioned, you know? I want a wedding. I want a cake and flowers. I want dancing, you know? It's been a while since we've done any dancing. Maybe we could get Little Richard again. We could have a good old- fashioned rock and roll wedding.",
        "Nora: You're really serious about this.",
        "Bo: Yeah. And you know what? We could get married on our anniversary. How perfect would that be? June 1. Aw, come on, Red. Come on. You got to do it. Come on. Say yes.",
        "Nora: I can't.",
        "Bo: You can't marry me? I--",
        "Nora: Come on. We talked about this, Bo.",
        "Bo: Not that I remember.",
        "Nora: Okay, you might have been asleep. How about we didn't want to hurt anyone? No more collateral damage.",
        "Bo: Like...",
        "Nora: Clint.",
        "Bo: Clint is remarried. For Pete's sake.",
        "Nora: To an ex-pole dancer Kim. That's not--that's a rebound. That's not moving on. That's not healing.",
        "Bo: So that's why you have to wait, so that Clint will heal?",
        "Nora: He was here all night, on the other side of that door. He sat there. He was here all night.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Nora: And that's a great start. And then he came in here and he said the most beautiful things to you, Bo. He still loves you.",
        "Bo: So...",
        "Nora: So he doesn't feel that way about me. I mean, we're barely speaking right now, and if you and I got married, I'd be afraid that he would back off again.",
        "Bo: This isn't about Clint.",
        "Nora: I don't--I don't want to be--you to lose all the ground that you have gained.",
        "Bo: Ah, bull.",
        "Nora: What are you--excuse me?",
        "Bo: That's a load of bull.",
        "Nora: I'm trying to be sensitive here. I'm trying to--",
        "Bo: You're trying to be safe here. You're scared that if we get married again, that it won't work out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I don't know, Adriana. I apologized. I taped that love note back together and gave it to Cris, and then I asked him where he was. Turned out he was with Jessica. Yeah. That's right. He gave her a ride home and helped her with her homework. Maybe I'm overreacting. I'm just so scared that I might make another mistake, and--",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: How about I pick you up in an hour?",
        "Jessica: We were gonna try to call my mother in London tonight, and it could be a while.",
        "Brody: I'll wait.",
        "Jessica: But it's a school night, so--",
        "Brody: I'll have you home by midnight.",
        "Jessica: Can't you take a hint? I don't want to go out with you, okay?",
        "Brody: Not okay. I won a date fair and square.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, hardly fair.",
        "Brody: What? You are the one who tried to hustle me. But forget it.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Brody: Yeah. If you're gonna be such a pain, I'll give you a chance to get out of it.",

        "Starr: Oh, my God.",
        "Destiny: You didn't think a sister could play you.",
        "Starr: Wait a minute.",
        "Destiny: Or you just wanted your own sister.",
        "Starr: I had nothing to do with the casting of the musical.",
        "Destiny: Right. It's only your story.",
        "Starr: I did not cast Dani! I had nothing to do with it. Really.",
        "Destiny: You swear?",
        "Cole: It's Starr. She doesn't lie, okay?",
        "Destiny: No, she doesn't.",
        "Starr: Did you get cast?",
        "Destiny: As Langston. I really wanted the lead, ever since I...wanted someone else.",
        "Starr: What about Matthew? Did he get cast?",
        "Destiny: He's Markko.",
        "Starr: Okay. So see? You guys get to work with each other.",
        "Destiny: Over it.",
        "Starr: Really?",
        "Destiny: Sort of. I mean, I don't think the show will bring us together like it did for the real Markko and Langston.",
        "Starr: Well, I'm sorry.",
        "Destiny: No, I am. I shouldn't have busted on you.",
        "Starr: Forget about it.",
        "Destiny: Later.",
        "Cole: Bye, Destiny. Nice chatting with you. Remind me never to get on her bad side.",
        "Starr: Thanks for sticking up for me.",
        "Cole: Well, I mean, all right, you don't lie, you know? I mean, you may be wrong about some things. There's no way that Langston is breaking up with Markko.",
        "Starr: I wish I was. We have to get ready for it.",
        "Cole: But why?",
        "Starr: She had a thing with Ford.",

        "Cole: What, they were sleeping together? Since when?",
        "Starr: A while now.",

        "Langston: Dorian, this really isn't a good time. Markko and I were just--",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes, yes. Something was going on. In fact, the two of you have had a difficult time of it this winter, haven't you?",
        "Langston: I should really talk about that with Markko.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but before you do, just understand this. It's only a rough patch. These things happen. This, too, shall pass.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, thank you for your advice.",
        "Dorian: Here's your hat. What's your hurry?",
        "Langston: Dorian, this really isn't helping, okay?",
        "Dorian: I know I can't solve it for you, but I just--I beg of you, darling, think, think about what is going on.",
        "Langston: I've been thinking about it, okay? Look, I promise I will call you later, all right?",
        "Dorian: All right. That's fine. I'm going. Darling...I wonder if you have any idea how wonderful, really wonderful Markko is.",

        "Judge Henson: The question is, Ms. Morasco, do you now wish to sue Oliver Fish for custody?",
        "Elijah: Your Honor, my client is the baby's aunt, and as I noted before, she delivered the child and has never left her side until the court order mistakenly gave custody to Schuyler Joplin. Meanwhile, as you noted, these two gentlemen, one a full-time police officer, the other a full-time medical student, had no expectations of and made no plans for ever having a baby. Now they want custody of a child who's already suffered a life-threatening illness. This is hardly ideal. These two well-meaning men are simply not ready to be parents. Gigi Morasco is already a mother. She's raised her son well. She's a wonderful--",
        "Gigi: Stop. I don't want you to do this.",
        "Elijah: Hey, Gigi, hold up.",
        "Judge Henson: Ms. Morasco?",
        "Gigi: What Mr. Clark is saying, it's true, but it's not. I mean, yeah, I'm a mom, and I've tried to be good at it, but I--I didn't plan it, and I had to work full-time, too. I still do. Who doesn't? Um, last year, our son Shane had leukemia, and we almost lost him. No parent is ever ready for that. You just hold on for dear life, be there every minute, and pray your kid makes it. I mean, it's a crapshoot being a parent. You don't know any day what's going to happen. You just love them to pieces and do whatever it takes because to your child, you're it. Your Honor, I love my niece, and I'd do anything to take care of her. That's what I promised my sister. But she's Oliver's kid, and it's obvious he loves her, too. He's here today without a lawyer because he wouldn't leave her alone after a crisis. He'll be a great dad. My sister didn't make too many appropriate choices in her life, but she really lucked out with Oliver; so did my niece. Sierra belongs with you.",
        "Judge Henson: Looks like we're done here. As there is no challenge filed against his claim, this court recognizes Oliver Fish as the sole surviving parent and grants him full custody of the minor child Sierra Rose. Court adjourned.",
