        "Todd: I thought I was supposed to have Wi-Fi service the minute I walked into the room. [Knock on door] Just get it hooked up. Oh, God, this is getting really old.",
        "Blair: Oh, gee, Todd, I'm so sorry. I didn't know opening the door would exhaust you.",
        "Todd: Oh, we should've gotten adjoining rooms.",
        "Blair: Are you out of your mind? It's bad enough to be in the same city as you. I couldn't stand being next to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: A little seafood Maki, California Roll -- you like Yellowtail, right?",
        "Adriana: I like it all. If I don't have sushi at least once a week, serious withdrawals.",
        "Tate: Well, maybe I'll make it for you sometime.",
        "Adriana: You'll what?",
        "Tate: Sushi -- I can roll my own.",
        "Adriana: I'm sure you can.",
        "Tate: I'm serious. I spent a season in Japan when I was starting out. I learned it there.",
        "Adriana: I would think that that would take a delicate touch.",
        "Tate: Oh, you can't picture me finding my way around sticky rice and seaweed because I'm a jock, right?",
        "Adriana: It does seem a little out of character.",
        "Tate: That's why I learned it -- so I can surprise people, keep them guessing.",
        "Rex: Mind telling me what the hell's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Whew! It is really coming down out there.",
        "John: Yeah, no sign of it stopping, either.",
        "Marty: Thanks for the ride.",
        "John: Yeah, sure. I wasn't going to leave you to sleep in a dead car in the parking lot. When was the last time you got that wreck tuned up anyway?",
        "Marty: I don't remember.",
        "John: Yeah, I didn't think so.",
        "Marty: You know, I'll call a -- a tow truck first thing in the morning and have them come get it. Oh.",
        "John: Well, you know, you might want to try it again before you do that, you know, see if it turns over or -- you know, maybe I could stop by Rodi's and try it for you.",
        "Marty: I mean, it didn't start tonight. Why -- why do you think it would start in the morning?",
        "John: Well, you know, tomorrow's a new day. You know, things change. You never know what might happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey, Billy? Um, I saw Mac earlier, and he said that John left out through the back. I went out there and no one was there. Have you seen him?",
        "Billy: Yeah, he was with some woman.",
        "Natalie: Really? Do you know who?",
        "Billy: No, just someone he was shooting darts with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: You want to talk about it?",
        "Bo: Hi, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Hey.",
        "Bo: I didn't even see you. Sorry.",
        "Lindsay: Is there something wrong?",
        "Bo: Actually, yeah, there is. Paige is going to take a job with doctors without borders in Bhutan. So she's leaving Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Mind if I join you?",
        "Paige: If I didn't know better, I would say you followed me here.",
        "Nora: Actually, I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You want to get some coffee?",
        "Antonio: No. I don't trust myself with a cup of scalding coffee right now.",
        "Cristian: Look, Antonio, I know you're pissed --",
        "Antonio: That doesn't even describe it, Cristian. I want to know what you know about Jessica and I want to know right now!",
        "Cristian: First of all, I didn't say I knew anything, all right, you did. Now, look, I get it, man -- you want to beat on something. Believe me, I understand, it's been a bad day. But getting all crazy is not going to help Jamie.",
        "Antonio: Then maybe you can suggest what will. Because the look on her face --",
        "Cristian: She's a big kid, Antonio, she's going to be fine.",
        "Antonio: This whole thing meant so much to her. And we all made such a big deal about it -- especially Jessica, and then for her to cancel last-minute, I -- I just don't understand how Jessica could hurt Jamie like that. You know, and then for her to run out of the hearing in the rain, in the state she's in? I mean, what the hell is going on with her, Cristian? What do you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Jessica, are you all right?",
        "Jessica: No, I'm not all right!",
        "Nash: What are you doing here?",
        "Jessica: I had to get out of -- I couldn't breathe, I was suffocating, I couldn't --",
        "Nash: Out of where? What's wrong? What happened?",
        "Jessica: The adoption hearing! I couldn't go through with it! I couldn't get the words out of my mouth, it was awful! What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were leaving.",
        "Nash: Oh, I am leaving. I saw you get out of your truck. Come on, let me get you out of here.",
        "Jessica: No! I can't go back. Don't you understand? Everything you said was right. My whole life is a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thanks for the towel, but I -- I should get going.",
        "Marty: No, you shouldn't. You're soaking wet, John. Here, let me take your coat and I'll hang it up. It'll dry faster.",
        "John: You don't have to do that.",
        "Marty: Give me your coat.",
        "John: No, forget it.",
        "Marty: Now.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "Marty: Thank you.",
        "John: Yeah. Everyone's bossy in this town. I've been to other towns before, they don't boss you around like this. People are -- oh.",
        "Marty: Did you say something?",
        "John: Me? No.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Hmm. You're the kind of guy who doesn't like to be fussed over, aren't you?",
        "John: Nope.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Let me see your hands.",
        "John: Why?",
        "Marty: Because I want to buy you some Christmas gloves. Let me see your hands. Never had a manicure, have you?",
        "John: No, never.",
        "Marty: You're the kind of guy who can take care of himself.",
        "John: Yeah, that's probably true.",
        "Marty: Or you think you are.",
        "John: What the hell's that supposed to mean?",
        "Marty: How about I make us some coffee while we wait?",
        "John: You don't have to go to any trouble, honestly.",
        "Marty: No, no, I know -- oh, it is no trouble at all, really. I'll be right back.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "[Marty imitates John]",
        "John: I heard that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey, Uncle Bo, Lindsay.",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "Natalie: Have you seen my sister?",
        "Lindsay: Jessica? No. Why?",
        "Bo: What's going on?",
        "Natalie: Um -- ok. You know, she was going to adopt Jamie, we were all at the hearing, and then all of the sudden she changed her mind and left the courtroom.",
        "Bo: Where'd she go?",
        "Natalie: Who knows? She took off in her car.",
        "Lindsay: Well, this isn't a good night to be driving around in this weather.",
        "Bo: Yeah, Antonio's probably looking for her.",
        "Natalie: No, yeah, he -- he probably is. You know, she probably just wants to be alone, but I know it's a long shot. If you hear from her --",
        "Bo: I'll let you know right away.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Bo: But, Nat, try not to worry, ok? Because Jess, Jess is a mom now. She's not going to take any unnecessary chances.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Maybe the old Jessica. The new and improved, I'm not so sure.",
        "Bo: Well, I -- I don't think she's changed that much.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. You know what? I think I'm just going to hang out here and maybe have a drink, wait till this storm blows over.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, I think that's a better idea.",
        "Natalie: Uncle Bo, have you -- have you seen John?",
        "Bo: No. No, I haven't.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Ok, see you guys.",
        "Lindsay: Ok, see you later. God, I hope that Jessica's all right.",
        "Bo: I think maybe I should call Antonio.",
        "Lindsay: Bo, wait a minute. Wouldn't he call if things weren't ok?",
        "Bo: You're probably right.",
        "Lindsay: All right, so, what can I do to lighten your mood?",
        "Bo: Oh, Lindsay. I'm not even sure that's possible.",
        "Lindsay: Bo, if you want to vent about Paige, it's ok.",
        "Bo: No, no, that's all right. I don't really want to talk about her.",
        "Lindsay: Well, then, why don't I just keep you company?",
        "Bo: That I would like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Thank you.",
        "Nora: You're welcome.",
        "Paige: So you want to tell me why you followed me here?",
        "Nora: Sure. I wanted to convince you not to leave Llanview. I think it's a mistake and I think you're incredibly selfish to even consider it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Answer me. If you know anything -- look, Cris, I don't care how you found out or how long you've known. But there's a lot at stake here. Just tell me the truth. Is there something I need to know about my wife?",
        "Cristian: Just that I'm worried about her, Antonio, but, you know, right now, I'm more worried about you.",
        "Antonio: Look, don't be. I should be home right now, with Jessica and my family celebrating this adoption. Instead, I'm sitting here with you worried sick about my daughter while Jessica's out driving in the rain!",
        "Cristian: Relax. Relax, ok? Jamie's with Mami, she's fine, and you've told the patrols to keep an eye out for Jessica, so what more can you do for Jessica? And besides, she's a grown woman. She's probably holed up somewhere trying to sort things out.",
        "Antonio: Try her again on her cell phone.",
        "Cristian: You've called her a dozen times, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, and a dozen times I've gotten her voicemail.",
        "Cristian: She doesn't want to talk to you, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, obviously not. And if she does, when she does, she will call. Even her mother told me to leave her alone, not to pressure her.",
        "Cristian: I guess it's not going to do any good. She's made up her mind. She doesn't want to adopt Jamie.",
        "Antonio: No, she just needs a little time to think about it.",
        "Cristian: Nothing's going to change it, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: You know, you say that with such -- conviction.",
        "Cristian: Because it's true.",
        "Antonio: Tell me what you know, Cristian -- now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Come on, you're acting crazy.",
        "Jessica: I have been acting crazy! I've been denying the truth, and the truth is my marriage isn't working! It never has been working! I've been trying to convince myself that it's fine, and it's not fine! I even thought it was until I realized I was driving you away! And you were right about the adoption. Adopting Jamie is just me taking one step farther away from you, and I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. I -- I can't lose you. I don't want to be without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: What is your problem, Rex?",
        "Rex: Finding the two of you on the floor together doesn't warm my heart. What can I say?",
        "Adriana: We're having a bite to eat. That is all.",
        "Rex: I thought you were taking Layla and Adriana out to dinner.",
        "Adriana: Layla wanted to have a break from work and catch a movie.",
        "Tate: And with the rain coming down the way it is, we decided to order in. Have a tuna roll, dude.",
        "Rex: No, thanks. Not really into sushi. Actually, I just came by to get an extra battery for my computer and then I am going.",
        "Tate: You know what? I got to go, too. It's getting late. I have my first sports report at 11:00.",
        "Adriana: Oh, you didn't tell me that you're starting tonight.",
        "Tate: Yeah, it's my big debut, and the Tate is never late. But, first, however, I have to read my tea bag fortune.",
        "Rex: Your what?",
        "Tate: This restaurant has fortunes on the tea bag labels. \"Embrace the challenge and you will win the prize.\"",
        "Rex: Deep.",
        "Tate: Do you believe in fortunes?",
        "Rex: Ahem, excuse me, but didn't the Tate say he had to get going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If you don't want to be here, why the hell did you sneak on a plane just to be with me?",
        "Blair: I'm not here just to be with you, Todd. I'm here to help you find your son.",
        "Todd: Hmm, sorry. Slip of the tongue.",
        "Blair: And there will be no slipping of the tongue or anything else for that matter.",
        "Todd: Oh, God, don't worry about that. Just the mere thought of it --",
        "Blair: What? Finish the sentence.",
        "Todd: I just have absolutely no desire to have you in bed, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Blair: You think I'm worried? Like I can't handle myself with you? Oh, God, don't flatter yourself, please.",
        "Todd: God, you know, if this is the way it's going to be --",
        "Blair: You know, I'm here, Todd.",
        "Todd: Get on a plane --",
        "Blair: To help you find your son -- that's it, and to protect you, because I don't want to see you get hurt -- unless I'm the one doing the hurting -- shut up!",
        "Todd: I've a question for you. If you had snuck on the plane and found Evangeline there, what would you have done then? Or did you somehow know that she wouldn't be there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Good coffee.",
        "Marty: Yeah, it's actually one of my indulgences. I grind the beans myself, fresh.",
        "John: Yeah, I understand the brewing process.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "John: Personally, I like instant.",
        "Marty: That is a tragedy.",
        "John: Well, it's better than the stuff we get at the station. You think my jacket's dry yet?",
        "Marty: No, uh-uh.",
        "John: How much longer do you think it'll be?",
        "Marty: Well, it's leather. I mean, it could take hours to dry. You might have to spend the night here.",
        "John: Hey, look, my jacket, it doesn't have to be completely dry.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Gotcha.",
        "John: Yeah, I didn't know you had a sense of humor.",
        "Marty: I didn't know you had one, either.",
        "John: Yeah, it's kind of dry.",
        "Marty: Hmm, unlike your clothing.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Marty: Hmm. That was bad.",
        "John: Hmm. Look, I think I'll just take my jacket and then go on home and change.",
        "Marty: Ok. I will get it for you.",
        "John: Thank you. Look -- thanks for the coffee.",
        "Marty: You're welcome. I had fun tonight.",
        "John: Yeah. Especially the -- the dart lesson was good.",
        "Marty: Yeah, and the fact that you didn't have to arrest me for involuntary manslaughter. The bartender's backside.",
        "John: Right. Huh.",
        "Marty: John, um, thanks for your help with Cole and for, you know, letting me put things in perspective.",
        "John: Good night.",
        "Marty: Night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: No, Rex is right. I got to get going, but I want Adriana to answer the question first.",
        "Adriana: That was a serious question? I mean, how can anyone believe that tea bags can predict the future?",
        "Rex: Actually, I happen to depend solely on fortune cookies to guide me through life. How else would I know not to kiss an elephant on the lips? Got that in a fortune once. Swear on my life.",
        "Tate: Yeah, well, you can be cynical about it, but I like what I just read.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Well, good luck tonight.",
        "Tate: Well, thanks, but the Tate makes his own luck. Don't forget -- news at 11:00.",
        "Adriana: I'll be watching. I'm sure you're going to do great.",
        "Tate: Yeah. This is the beginning of a whole new career for me.",
        "Rex: Look out, Bob Costas.",
        "Tate: Good one.",
        "Adriana: Rex, you have got to relax around him.",
        "Rex: I'm relaxed! I just hate the guy, that's all.",
        "Adriana: Well, it's no fun for me because I have to work with the guy.",
        "Rex: Yeah, ok, ok, well, I'll try to see the good in him.",
        "Adriana: How about -- how about just not freak out every time you see us together. How's that? Is that ok?",
        "Rex: Well, guess what -- I won't even know that you and Tate are together for a while since I'm out of town for a few days.",
        "Adriana: What? Why? Is this about Todd's baby?",
        "Rex: Yeah. He's in Chicago. I booked the next flight out.",
        "Adriana: Tonight? In this storm?",
        "Rex: Have to. I talked to miles, tried to get him to tell me something about the clue he gave Todd, but he didn't spill.",
        "Adriana: None of this makes sense. I mean, Spencer practically bent over backwards to convince Todd that his baby was dead.",
        "Rex: Yeah -- that's not what happened.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: I'm convinced Spencer never wanted Todd to find his kid.",
        "Adriana: Then why would he tell Miles anything about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I didn't know whether Evangeline would be on the plane with you or not, Todd. But I knew you would try to talk her out of it.",
        "Todd: That's right, because this might be dangerous, and I want her safe.",
        "Blair: Hmm. That may have been what you told her.",
        "Todd: Oh, but that couldn't be the real reason, could it, Blair?",
        "Blair: You don't want anyone here that's going to make you go by the book, because I know you, Todd. You find your son, you're going to take him right then and there, nothing and no one's going to stop you.",
        "Todd: Well, that part's true, yeah.",
        "Blair: So why are we wasting time here? Why don't we go out looking for your son?",
        "Todd: All right, let's do it. You're on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Miles: Hi.",
        "Marty: Miles. Uh -- hi.",
        "Miles: Yeah, I hope it's not too late. I should've called.",
        "Marty: No, no, it's ok. Um -- what did you want?",
        "Miles: I'd like to come in if I may.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I know you said you don't want to talk about Paige, but can I just say that I think she's a damn fool to leave a wonderful man like you and a terrific kid like Matthew.",
        "Bo: Well, there's just no stopping her.",
        "Lindsay: You know what I keep forgetting is that, well, she lost a son. Maybe she just needs to get away from the memories.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but I think that there are other reasons, too.",
        "Lindsay: Well, see, that's the part that I just -- I just don't get that, ok? I -- I think if you love someone, you don't run away. It doesn't matter. I mean, whatever you're going through, you let them -- you let them help you. You let them comfort you. It seems to me that you would need that person even more, no?",
        "Bo: Well, maybe she thinks she just doesn't need my help.",
        "Lindsay: Well, that's just plain crazy, because there's nobody else that's more generous and more giving than you are. I can't think of another person that I'd want around me if I was going through a hard time -- no better friend.",
        "Bo: Look at us, Lindsay. After everything we've been through, here we are.",
        "Lindsay: I know. Look at us -- we're bonding. [Lindsay chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: You have no right to judge me, Nora.",
        "Nora: Oh -- no -- yes, I do. This affects my son. Matthew loves you, Paige, and he assumes because he's young and innocent and naive that you're in this for the long haul with him and his dad. And now, for no reason other than some selfish need to go and -- and save the world rather than stay here and face reality, you're ready to pack them both in.",
        "Paige: That is so unfair. I am facing reality -- I'm not selfish!",
        "Nora: Oh, really? What would you call it? Taking off will have a profound effect on my son who has lost so much already and I deeply resent the fact that you haven't even considered him.",
        "Paige: Of course I have considered him. I feel terrible about it -- it is breaking my heart!",
        "Nora: Paige, I'm not asking you to give up your life for my son. Ok? And I know part of the reason why you're leaving has to do with the loss of your son. I -- I don't mean to be callous to that or any other reason that you'd want to leave. But I think it's time you started being honest with yourself about what it is that you really want, and realizing that maybe it's all right here in Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I know that the last thing that Jessica wants to do is hurt you, or Jamie.",
        "Antonio: Then why did she? Why did she break Jamie's heart? Why did she decide not to adopt my little girl?",
        "Cristian: Well, look, Antonio, she obviously has a lot to sort out.",
        "Antonio: When? And why didn't she sort it out before? This is about a child's life. This is about our marriage!",
        "Cristian: I know, I know. Sit down, Antonio -- relax. Sit down, come on. Sit. Look, I'm sorry, ok? You know, maybe -- maybe things will change now that Nash is leaving.",
        "Antonio: What? Why didn't I know anything about this?",
        "Cristian: Well, I just found out about this myself.",
        "Antonio: My God. Wait, did she run -- did she run out of there looking for Nash? I mean, is -- is that where she is right now --",
        "Cristian: No.",
        "Antonio: Trying to find him?",
        "Cristian: No.",
        "Antonio: Well, how do you know, Cristian? And how can you be so sure?",
        "Cristian: Because she told me that she was the one that pushed Nash out of her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I left because you said we couldn't be together.",
        "Jessica: I know, I know, and I was wrong! I was wrong about everything and you were right! You were right about the adoption! It was just a desperate attempt to save our marriage and you were right -- you were right that I shouldn't bring an innocent child into my messed-up life and you were right that I shouldn't tell Antonio that he was the only man that I loved because -- because I love you, too! And I know, I know, I know I've said it before. I know, but -- but it's different this time because -- because I want to be with you. I need to be with you. And when you left, I didn't know what to do.",
        "Nash: I'm here. I'm right here.",
        "Jessica: Please don't ever leave me again.",
        "Nash: I'll never leave. I promise.",

        "Lindsay: Which I wasn't.",
        "Bo: What? Then how did you know what I was going to say?",
        "Lindsay: Because if you think that I meant -- oh, no, no, no. Been there, done that.",
        "Bo: Uh-huh.",
        "Lindsay: Right?",
        "Bo: Definitely.",
        "Lindsay: Um -- I just really wanted you to know I'm glad we're friends again, and that if you need me, I'm here for you in whatever way, even if it's just to have a couple of beers and some small talk.",
        "Bo: You know what? I just might take you up on that.",
        "Paige: Hi.",
        "Bo: Paige. How'd you find me?",
        "Paige: Well, I happen to know that this is where you come after a -- an especially stressful day. Hi, Lindsay.",

        "Rex: Look, I don't have all the answers -- hell, I don't have any of the answers. All I know is that miles gave Todd some info on his kid that's taken him to Chicago and that's where the adoption agency is.",
        "Adriana: The one where Tommy's adoptive parents got him from.",
        "Rex: And, as you know, I promised Michael that I would never let Todd find out he and Marcie have Todd's kid. I'm off to Chicago to keep that promise.",
        "Adriana: But what can you do?",
        "Rex: No idea. I'm hoping something will come to me.",
        "Adriana: Well, what are you going to tell Todd while you're there?",
        "Rex: That I do know -- I'm going to tell him that I want to help him.",
        "Adriana: Oh, but you'll be doing exactly the opposite.",
        "Rex: Want to come with me?",
        "Adriana: I wish I could, but I have a lot of work to do.",
        "Rex: I understand.",
        "Adriana: But you're going to call me 10 times a day, right, at least and let me know what's going on?",
        "Rex: Of course.",
        "Adriana: And you're going to be careful?",
        "Rex: Am I ever not?",
        "Adriana: Wait. Do you have to leave right now?",
        "Rex: Well -- I mean, the flight got delayed because of the storm, but -- I should be at the airport in an hour -- oh, an hour or so.",
        "Adriana: But it only takes 20 minutes to get to the airport, right? Maybe a half-hour in the storm, and if you leave here at 10:30, then you'll make your flight with plenty of time to spare and -- and that gives us practically a whole hour.",
        "Rex: I love it when you talk math.",

        "Marty: Come on in. It's just -- you know, it's getting late and I was getting ready to go to bed.",
        "Miles: Oh, I won't stay long. I just wanted to thank you for your encouragement to do the right thing. Todd, the -- the clue from Spencer?",
        "Marty: Oh, yeah. But you already thanked me, so I think maybe you're using this as an excuse? Did you just want to come by and see me?",
        "Miles: Well -- you must've dropped this.",
        "Marty: Oh. It must be John's.",
        "Miles: What was he doing here? Are -- are you two dating now or --",
        "Marty: No. No, Miles. Um -- like I said, I'm -- I'm not ready to date anyone. It's just -- we're friends.",
        "Miles: Like you and I -- we're still friends, aren't we?",
        "Marty: We are.",
        "Miles: Good, I'm glad. And like I was saying, your advice -- telling me to help Todd out -- just, it made me feel so good about myself. I honestly hope he finds his kid.",

        "Todd: Welfare agencies --",
        "Blair: It could take forever.",
        "Todd: I don't have forever, do I?",
        "Blair: Well, what if it's a setup? What if Spencer used Miles to send you on this wild-goose chase?",
        "Todd: Well, then somebody's going to pay, and it's going to be Miles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What changed your mind?",
        "Paige: You and Matthew, and a very convincing argument by Nora. She made me realize that I -- I can't possibly leave the two most important people in my whole life.",
        "Bo: This is great news. This is the best -- come on, we're going to celebrate.",
        "Paige: Wait, wait, wait.",

        "Miles: Hi, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Hello. Well, of course, it's worth it. A good old-fashioned Rodi's burger to cheer a person up.",
        "Miles: Ah, not that I need cheering up.",
        "Natalie: No?",
        "Miles: Uh-uh. No, I did something for somebody and I'm feeling pretty great about it.",

        "Natalie: Hmm. Tell me about it.",
        "Miles: Yeah. But in this case, I have no doubt I did the noble thing -- no doubt at all.",

        "Blair: Ok, here is a list of all the doctors, hospitals, lawyers in the 60651 zip code. But there is only one adoption agency.",
        "Todd: Well, that must be the one, then.",
        "Blair: Well, not necessarily.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it's a logical place to start, isn't it?",
        "Blair: What are you doing?",
        "Todd: I'm going to call them, see if we can get an appointment for an application for an adoption.",
        "Todd: Oh, man -- they're closed till Monday.",

        "Antonio: Did Jessica tell you why she wanted Nash to leave?",
        "Cristian: Because Nash was playing with her emotions, messing with her head.",
        "Antonio: Maybe Nash just hates seeing Jessica happy because she looks so much like Tess. I -- and may-- you know, help me out here, Cris, please.",
        "Cristian: I think we already know the real reason, Antonio. You just don't want to know it. Nash is in love with Jess, not Tess. And he's been doing everything he can to get Jess to love him back.",

        "Tate: Hi, this is Tate Harmon, looking forward to being with you every night, giving you the scores, the highlights, and of course, the Tate's opinion on all the plays and the players. You know, folks, in sports as in life, you've got to give it all you've got or, as a wise man once told me, \"embrace the challenge and you'll win the prize.\" That's pretty good advice in my book, and all I can really add to that is this -- once you have your eyes on that prize, never give up until it's yours, in sports and in life. Back to you, Jeff.",

        "Miles: I told Todd Manning his son might still be alive.",
        "Natalie: Is that true?",
        "Miles: I'm not sure. Spencer gave me a clue in a letter and I passed it on to Todd.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Well, if it came from Spencer, it's probably a lie.",
        "Miles: Could be, but Marty told me I did the right thing anyway by giving it to Todd.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I agree with Marty -- you did.",
        "Miles: It didn't take long for John to move on, did it?",

        "Nora: Is that a problem for you?",
        "Lindsay: I just can't figure out what your motivation could be. I mean, I know how possessive you are of Matthew.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Lindsay: And I can only imagine how threatened you must be by Paige's relationship with your son.",
        "Nora: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See, I only care about Matthew's happiness, and Bo's, and if Bo's happy, then that's good for my son -- get it? But if my convincing Paige to stay in Llanview screwed up your plans, well, that's only an added bonus.",
        "Lindsay: You don't know what the hell you're talking about.",

        "Blair: So what do you think -- we're just going to walk into an adoption agency and say, \"you know, we'd like to adopt a child, and by the way, have you seen his son?\" I mean, come on -- that's not going to work. And no court in this country is going to give us access to their records without proof. We're better off coming up with a better plan here.",
        "Todd: Fine -- do you have one?",
        "Blair: Yeah -- bribery.",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Blair: I'm sure there's some poor sap out there that makes minimum wage that would take a couple of thousand bucks and give us access to the records.",
        "Todd: No, that's the hard way.",
        "Blair: Oh. And what's the easy way, Todd?",
        "Todd: The place is closed, so we break in -- tonight.",
