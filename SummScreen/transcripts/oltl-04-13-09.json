        "Natalie: Are we doing the right thing here?",
        "Jared: Cohabitating? Yes.",
        "Natalie: No, being Chloe's godparents, knowing that she's really Starr's?",
        "Jared: Sweetheart, you got to stop with this. You're going to drive yourself crazy.",
        "Natalie: I know, but we've got to stand up on that altar tomorrow and look right in that minister's eyes and tell him that we're these moral people all the while keeping this lie going?",
        "Jared: Okay, well, why didn't you tell Jessica yesterday when you had made up your mind to do it?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I mean -- I was going to, but then she broke up with Brody and --",
        "Jared: All right, well maybe we need to risk it, Brody or no Brody. Maybe you can't live with yourself until you tell Jessica the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Look, I didn't even know about you and Brody.",
        "Jessica: This is a conversation you should be having with Brody.",
        "Gigi: I'm telling you, Jessica, nothing happened.",
        "Jessica: Gigi, I'm not judging, I'm really not, but sleeping with someone, that's not nothing. At least not nothing to me.",
        "Gigi: To me, too. That's why I can't let you go on thinking that Brody cheated on you when he didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What was -- what was that?",
        "Schuyler: I don't know. Something I've wanted to do for a while, I guess.",
        "Stacy: I can't do this.",
        "Schuyler: Why? Why, because of Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Brody can't cheat on me. We weren't dating.",
        "Gigi: But you care about each other.",
        "Jessica: And Rex cares about you, and when he walked into that room, he was pretty clear what he saw in there.",
        "Gigi: Rex doesn't know the whole story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zach: All right. Come on in, close the door, and lock it. Now!",
        "[Starr whimpering]",
        "Todd: It's all right, sweetie. I'm closing the door",
        "Zach: Lock the door!",
        "Todd: I'm locking it.",
        "Todd: I'm unarmed. You got my gun there.",
        "Zach: Yeah, I do, don't I?",
        "Todd: Starr, you all right? Hey, Zach, why don't we lose the gag? She doesn't need it.",
        "Zach: You don't like how I'm treating your daughter, Manning?",
        "Todd: Okay, okay, you're calling the shots, Zach. For sure, nobody is going to make a move without your say-so. But would you mind taking your hands off of her?",
        "Zach: Oh, what's wrong? You're not having fun yet?",
        "Todd: Why don't you just let her go?",
        "Zach: I saw pictures of this place in the paper. You and Marty's getaway. Real romantic. Todd's big do-over.",
        "Todd: You let her go; you and I will settle this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Great, Manning. Now there's two hostages instead of one.",
        "Cole: How can you ask me to leave? Starr is upstairs with a creep holding a gun to her. The same creep -- Mom, you don't understand. I love her.",
        "Marty: I know you do. But it is not safe in this house.",
        "Cole: Mom, I'm not leaving.",
        "Marty: Okay, then I'm not leaving, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You just let her go and we'll settle this, you and me.",
        "Zach: Oh yeah, we can't do this without her, Todd. We're having a nostalgic moment here. You know, you, me, locked in an upstairs bedroom with an innocent young girl here. We all know what happens next.",
        "Todd: And what the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "Zach: Do I have to spell it out?",
        "Todd: You think you're going to rape my daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So you weren't in bed with Brody?",
        "Gigi: I was. I just really can't go into details --",
        "Jessica: I don't want to know. I don't want to know. The truth is, I don't want to know how you ended up in bed with Brody. It's none of my business. Whatever it was for you, it was a wake-up call for me. I cannot afford to complicate my life right now. Especially with somebody who is not sure what he wants.",
        "Gigi: But he is sure, Jessica. He really cares about you.",
        "Jessica: Well he's got a hell of a way of showing it.",
        "Gigi: I know how it looks, but you just have to believe me.",
        "Jessica: Why? Why do I have to believe you, Gigi? I mean, you're lying to Rex, you're over here trying to push Brody and me together when he's the reason that you broke up with Rex in the first place. None of this makes any sense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So how's my favorite grandson?",
        "Shane: I'm your only grandson.",
        "Roxy: Who's counting? Ta-da! Latest hair dos and don'ts. See, your hair is going to grow back sooner than you know, so I figured you needed a little heads up.",
        "Shane: Heads up, that's a good one.",
        "Roxy: Don't get smart with me. You know, I'm slightly a bit older than you are. So how are you doing, honey?",
        "Shane: Good. Even since I found out Aunt Stacy's the match, I've been feeling a lot better.",
        "Roxy: Oh, this one's got rock star written all over it.",
        "Shane: They'd kick me out of school.",
        "Roxy: Not the piercings, just the hair.",
        "Shane: Isn't it awesome that Aunt Stacy is giving me her bone marrow? She can do magic tricks. Did you know that?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, maybe she'll make herself disappear.",
        "Shane: Grandma, no one can disappear.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, that's too bad.",
        "Shane: I know whoever it was, but now that it's my Aunt Stacy doing this for me, I don't know how I can ever repay her.",
        "Roxy: You don't owe that conniving bitch anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You know I finally have the chance at really being happy.",
        "Schuyler: With Rex?",
        "Stacy: Yes, with Rex. I told you he and Gigi broke up.",
        "Schuyler: And he's just going to come running to you?",
        "Stacy: Maybe not right away.",
        "Schuyler: Well, how -- how long? How long are we talking about, Stace? Are we talking a week? A month? A year? Two years? What?",
        "Stacy: I don't know how long.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, that's right. You don't know. You don't know because it's not real. Because it's a fantasy. And because you deserve so much better than that.",
        "Stacy: Look, sky, I appreciate what you're doing, okay? I really do, but Rex is what I want.",
        "Schuyler: How can you -- how do you know that, Stace? How can you possibly know that? You don't even know who this guy is.",
        "Stacy: How can you say that? I've been seeing Rex every day for months.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, and in all that time, has he really looked at you? I mean, has he really, really looked at you? Stacy, you know how I feel about you, and I'm real, and I'm right here. Just -- just come back to me. Please come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What the hell is going on up there?",
        "Marty: We have to let John handle this. What happened?",
        "Cole: What do you mean?",
        "Marty: You told me you loved Starr.",
        "Cole: Yes, well, I tried to hate her for lying for her dad, for helping him get away with everything he did to you, what he was going to do with our baby -- but it doesn't matter. I mean -- nothing changed, not really.",
        "Marty: When you really love someone, they're always a part of you.",
        "Cole: I don't think Starr would agree with you.",
        "Marty: What do you mean?",
        "Cole: It doesn't matter. Starr just needs to come down from that room.",
        "Zach: See that?",
        "[Starr whimpering]",
        "Zach: See how she looks at you? Because she knows that when you're in the room that daddy's in charge.",
        "Todd: Just let her go.",
        "Zach: He was always like that, the ringleader. It was his idea to rape Marty. Did he tell you that? He got us to do it. And back then, I was stupid enough to go along with him. But no more, man.",
        "Todd: Zach, you don't want to go to prison, do you? You know, there's a way out of this. Just let her go.",
        "Zach: I don't think so, Manning. This time, we're going to do it my way.",
        "Todd: What are you talking about, Zach? This is all you. You said you wanted money, I'm giving you money. You wanted a way out of here, I'm giving you that. I agreed to all your terms. But you cannot expect to hurt my daughter and get a fresh start.",
        "Zach: I don't want to hurt her. I want to hurt you, Todd. I'm just going to use her to do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: This is -- this is crazy. This is -- I have to get up there.",
        "Marty: No. No, talk to me, talk to me. What were you and Starr doing here anyway?",
        "Cole: We weren't here together. I got here first. I came here to talk to Manning.",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "Cole: Not -- not about you. I probably shouldn't have been here at all. But if I hadn't, who knows what that guy would have done to her.",
        "Marty: Are you okay?",
        "Cole: How can I be okay? That whack job has Starr locked up in that room.",
        "Marty: Okay, try and calm down.",
        "Cole: Did you hear something?",
        "Marty: Somebody's coming.",
        "Cole: Go, go.",
        "Marty: I'm not going anywhere without you. John, John, oh my God.",
        "Cole: Is Starr okay?",
        "John: Yeah. Look, Rosen has got her locked in. Manning's in with them.",
        "Marty: Let's call the police.",
        "Cole: No, no. Rosen said no cops.",
        "John: I think Cole is right. We don't want to set this guy off.",
        "Cole: Well, can you -- can you hear what's going on?",
        "John: No. But look, if we're going to get them out of there, I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You think you can use Starr to hurt me, huh?",
        "Rosen: She's your daughter.",
        "Todd: I don't know. According to her mother, she is. I played along for a while, you know? But she turned on me. What's that phrase? An ungrateful child is --",
        "Zach: Sharper than a serpent's tooth.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's it.",
        "Zach: Is that you, honey? Did you sting your daddy?",
        "Todd: Yeah, she stung me right where it counts.",
        "Zach: The wallet?",
        "Todd: Yeah, and a little further north, too. She's someone else's daughter now. You probably didn't hear it, did you, Zach? Blair remarried. A guy named John McBain --",
        "Zach: Yeah, I -- I read the wife remarried.",
        "Todd: Little Starr here, she made her choice. So, you know how I feel about betrayal, right? Do you know? Zero tolerance. So, if you think you can hurt me by --",
        "Zach: Don't you worry, Todd.",
        "Todd: Why not? I mean, I'm just telling you, I don't care about the kid. Do what you will. But you might as well let her go and then you and I can settle this once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: There it is. All the evidence we put together to prove that Chloe -- well, that she isn't Jessica's.",
        "Natalie: The parking stub --",
        "Jared: Which establishes that Bess was at the hospital the day that Starr had her baby.",
        "Natalie: Right. We've got the DVD security tape that shows Bess coming into the hospital with one baby and leaving with another.",
        "Jared: And the DNA test which proves that Jessica isn't the biological mother of Chloe, but Starr is.",
        "Natalie: Well, we have all the truth now. Does that mean that we have to do something about it?",
        "Jared: You know what? Look, first things first. We need to get a safe-deposit box because we can't just keep stashing this stuff in your purse or in the trunk of my car or --",
        "Natalie: There's another alternative. We can destroy all the evidence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex and I -- we have to split up. You and Brody don't.",
        "Jessica: Why? Why do you and Rex have to split up?",
        "Gigi: Because -- okay, if I tell you, you have to swear not to tell anyone, especially Rex.",
        "Jessica: Fine.",
        "Gigi: Okay. We had just found out about Shane, that he was going to need bone marrow from somebody and we couldn't find a donor and my son was dying. I couldn't talk to Rex because of my sister.",
        "Rex: Whoa, I cannot believe you are going to blame Stacy. You know, she's saving our kid's life.",
        "Gigi: What are you doing here?",
        "Rex: Like you care.",
        "Jessica: He was here just getting Shane's comic.",
        "Rex: Yeah. What are you doing here?",
        "Gigi: Is Shane okay?",
        "Rex: He will be, because of Stacy.",
        "Gigi: Okay, look. I know you're mad at me, but when it comes to Shane, can we just --",
        "Rex: I will put up with anything for his sake.",
        "Gigi: And I won't? I would sacrifice my life for him. I already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Just let her go and we can settle this.",
        "Starr: [Muffled] Let me go!",
        "Todd: Yeah, like you care.",
        "Zach: Oh boy, you two should really take this on the road.",
        "Todd: I'm just trying to give you what you want, Zach, what you really want.",
        "Zach: Relax, Todd. I'm not going to rape your daughter.",
        "Todd: Well, that's a wise move. Just let her go. We'll make a deal.",
        "Zach: You know what? I've got a better idea. Since you don't give a damn about her, why don't I just kill her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Is there another way into bedroom other than the door in the hall?",
        "Marty: Other than the window?",
        "John: Hey, you okay? You with us?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "John: All right. There's a forced air vent in the hallway that I noticed. Marty, do you know if there's a duct that connects it to that room?",
        "Marty: I have no idea. Todd had a blueprint drawn up last fall. He wanted the house in New Mexico to look like this one.",
        "John: Where?",
        "Marty: I think he kept them both in here somewhere.",
        "John: Here, these?",
        "Marty: Yes. We need to find the ductwork. I think this is it.",
        "Marty: Oh my God. Because if you are right and Zach's our guy, Todd and Starr are upstairs with a serial killer.",
        "John: Yeah, as long as Manning doesn't screw it up.",
        "Marty: I don't think he'd do anything to hurt Starr.",
        "John: I got it.",
        "Cole: John, I'm coming with you.",
        "John: No, listen to me. Stay here. Protect your mom, all right? If I'm not back down in 15 minutes, you call the station, you ask for Officer Sahid. She'll know what to do. Can you handle that?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "John: Okay, good man.",
        "Marty: Be careful.",
        "John: I will.",
        "Marty: John won't let anything happen to Starr. What's that?",
        "Cole: It's -- it's Starr's. It must have come off her neck when Zach grabbed her. She keeps a lock of our baby's hair in it. She wears it all the time.",
        "Marty: She's going to be okay.",
        "Cole: I forget, you know, that she has her own stuff. I got so mad at her.",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "Cole: So, I came her to tell her dad about this guy she's hung up on.",
        "Marty: Cole, I'm sorry. I didn't realize Starr had somebody else.",
        "Cole: He, uh -- he was her teacher. His name is Schuyler Joplin. He's, like, 10 years older than she is.",
        "Marty: Wait a minute. Joplin, isn't he the one that's your drug counselor at the center? Is that why you wanted to get rid of him?",
        "Cole: Yeah. He claims that there's nothing going on between them, but I went to go see him today after I left you and I saw Starr leaving his place.",
        "Marty: And that's what you wanted to tell Todd?",
        "Cole: Yeah, that his daughter is in way over her head.",
        "Marty: But he wasn't here.",
        "Cole: No, he was here and I told him what happened. Then he took off.",
        "Marty: To go after Joplin?",
        "Cole: Yeah. I probably shouldn't have told him what happened, but I didn't know what else to do. Or maybe I just wanted him to kill the guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: We can start over. We can get out of here. We can go wherever we want.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, what about your little high school honey?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, she'll be better off with me out of the picture altogether. I mean, she's a lonely kid with a crush on a teacher. She's not you. Stacy -- Stacy, we can leave Vegas behind and everything that happened there, okay? We're not a part of that scene anymore. I'm clean. We can go wherever we want. You can go back to school. You can start up a dance company. You can be a teacher. You and I are really, really good together. It's just everything else --",
        "Stacy: And how do you know it won't change back?",
        "Schuyler: I don't. You have to work for it. I mean, life isn't a fantasy, but it can be just as sweet.",
        "Stacy: You know, it really sounds good, but I can't leave Llanview, not now. Fate sent me here to be with Rex.",
        "Schuyler: How do you know fate didn't send you here to be with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Okay, we destroy the evidence. Then we can't prove anything and Chloe is never going to know who her real parents are.",
        "Natalie: But you and I will always know.",
        "Jared: That's right. Because evidence or no evidence, you are going to keep driving yourself crazy.",
        "Natalie: You're right. I mean, it's taking over my life. But can you tell Jessica? Can you tell her that her baby is dead? Can you tell her that she has to give Chloe back to Starr? Neither can I. It is the bottom line, we just have to accept it and we have to destroy the evidence because I can't keep going on like this.",
        "Jared: You're sure? Because we make a decision, we stick to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I cannot believe you are trying to snow Jessica.",
        "Jessica: It's okay.",
        "Gigi: I'm not trying to snow anybody.",
        "Rex: Did you have sex with Brody Lovett, yes or no?",
        "Gigi: I can't -- I can't change how you feel, Rex. You and me, we need to be apart.",
        "Rex: Huh, okay, translation -- they had sex. Why she's trying to make Lovett out as some kind of hero now is --",
        "Gigi: Jessica and Brody's situation is totally different.",
        "Rex: So she is supposed to be okay with Lovett cheating on her and busting us up?",
        "Jessica: Guys --",
        "Rex: What do you think, Gigi? You could just do whatever you want, to hell with anyone else?",
        "Jessica: Would you guys mind taking this somewhere else?",
        "Rex: There's no need. Sorry, Jess.",
        "Jessica: It's okay.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, too. Because I honestly did not mean to drag you into this. You just have to understand that my son was dying and I couldn't lose him. I hope you never have to know what that's like. I hope you never, ever have to face the thought of losing your child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Grandma, Aunt Stacy is saving my life.",
        "Roxy: Have you ever been to Vegas, kid?",
        "Shane: No.",
        "Roxy: Then you don't know what you're talking about.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Kyle: Ms. Balsom?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Got to go, kid. What's up?",
        "Kyle: I've been over at the clinic giving your friend the next round of injections --",
        "Roxy: No friend of mine. So how long is it going to be before that John Doe bone marrow goes into my grandson?",
        "Kyle: Okay, can we stop playing games? John Doe has a real name and we both know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I understand you wanting to protect Starr from this teacher.",
        "Cole: I just don't want to see her get hurt anymore than she already has been.",
        "Marty: Of course not.",
        "Cole: You know, the truth is it really doesn't matter what Starr does or who she does it with. It's not going to change the way I feel about her. I love her.",
        "Marty: Maybe after all this is over, you guys can --",
        "Cole: No, Mom, no. No, I really screwed up. She's not going to take me back.",
        "Marty: You don't know that.",
        "Cole: Yes, yes I do. But it doesn't matter, as long as she comes out of this okay. I would leave town and never see her again if I thought it would make her come down these stairs in one piece.",
        "Marty: I know, I know.",
        "Cole: No, you don't. How could you possibly know how it feels to have the person you love trapped with some killer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You lay a hand on her --",
        "Zach: And you'll what? Step in front of my gun?",
        "Todd: You son of a bitch --",

        "[Starr squeals]",
        "Zach: Oh, I could look you in the eye, pal. But you'd only suffer a minute or two. I did hard time for you, man.",
        "Todd: Well, that's what I don't get, Zach, because you know you're going to go back to jail after this.",
        "Zach: Oh, not necessarily.",
        "Todd: Oh, no? You're going to escape, are you? With me dead and four witnesses?",

        "Zach: What options?",
        "Todd: What I'm telling you is that there are doors open, Shorty.",
        "Zach: Shorty?",
        "Todd: Yeah, but you're not going to take those doors, are you, Zach? You don't have the guts.",

        "Kyle: And you're sure the family wouldn't allow Shane to accept the bone marrow if they knew?",
        "Roxy: I'm sure they wouldn't want me within one block of him if they knew. I love that kid.",

It's just -- look, what we had before in Vegas -- look, I know we had our problems, but it was exciting. And it was romantic. That's what I like about Rex. It's like I don't know what's going to happen next.",

        "Rex: Hey, I get the idea.",
        "Shane: What does she mean by \"conniving\"? Why does grandma hate Aunt Stacy?",
        "Rex: Uh, Grandma Roxy hates everyone until she gets to know them. But tomorrow, after the transplant, and you're feeling better, she's going to be Aunt Stacy's best friend. So don't you worry, everything is cool between your grandma and Aunt Stacy.",
