        "Starr tells Langston that she believes she has no choice except for abortion. And as soon as they go downstairs, they observe that Cole has come by to confront Todd. And Todd tells Cole if he ever comes near Starr again, he will die. Starr then concludes that there is no way she can reveal to anybody that she is pregnant with Cole's baby. After Antonio catches John and Talia in the motel room in bed, he believes what Ramsey tells him. Ramsey apologizes for setting him up to catch them. But he tells him he felt he had to let Antonio see it for himself so he doesn't spend any more time being deceived. Adriana is having Dorian investigate Shane's \"real father\" but it's pretty obvious he is probably Rex. Adriana is very concerned about Rex's relationship with Gigi and with Shane."

        "Todd: Close the door. It's a pretty stupid move coming here, you know.",
        "Cole: Do you love your daughter? Because if you love your daughter, you really suck at showing it. Do you even care that you're ruining her life?",

        "Starr: Well, I'm seriously thinking about all of my options.",
        "Langston: An abortion?",
        "Starr: Langston, I'm 16. The best thing I could do for this baby is to not be its mother.",
        "Langston: Uh -- look, I'm sorry. It's just, I -- it's --",
        "Starr: It's impossible, Langston. All of this is impossible, and I have no idea what to do about it.",

        "Layla: You're not backing off of Rex and Gigi, are you? You just went underground.",
        "Dorian: I'm just doing some checking.",
        "Layla: On Gigi?",
        "Dorian: No -- on the man she says is her child's father. Well, turns out she isn't just talking. There really is such a man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You really loved Shane's father.",
        "Gigi: I still do.",
        "Rex: He's been gone a long time, though. Maybe it's time to rethink your dream. I mean, you can still have a family. It's just going to look a little different.",
        "Gigi: Maybe it doesn't have to.",
        "Rex: What are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Oh -- could you tell me where I could find Gigi Morasco's desk?",
        "Woman: I could, but she's not at her desk. I saw her in the boardroom with some blond guy.",
        "Adriana: Spiky hair, really cute?",
        "Woman: That'd be him.",
        "Adriana: Hmm. Thanks.",

        "Gigi: Remember truth or dare?",
        "Rex: You always took the dare.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and you always asked for the truth.",

        "Antonio: Ah!",
        "Talia: Please, both of you!",

        "Rex: Boxers or briefs -- I'll never tell.",
        "Gigi: Is everything a joke to you?",
        "Rex: Hey, truth or dare's no joke. That's how I ended up with that team's mascot parrot thing tattooed on my rear end.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God!",
        "[Gigi laughs]",
        "Gigi: That's right! Yeah, well, I hope you haven't gained any weight down there or that thing could look like a crow by now.",
        "Rex: That thing hasn't changed. Ask Adriana.",
        "Gigi: I don't think so.",
        "Rex: Seriously, what is this?",
        "Gigi: You said that I would always take the dare instead of the truth. Well, I'm older now, so I'm switching sides.",
        "Rex: What's the truth, Morasco?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: You're sure?",
        "Dorian: My investigator assures me that there really was a Brody Lovett. Yes, he's not just a figment of Gigi's imagination -- he really was Shane's father and he was a Navy Seal.",
        "Adriana: Do you know how he died?",
        "Dorian: No.",
        "Adriana: Do you know what kind of mission he was on, why Shane thinks he's a hero?",
        "Dorian: I don't know. He was in special ops, so his files are classified, but I'm not going to accept that. You and I are going to find out everything we need to know about Shane Morasco's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: It's about Shane.",
        "Adriana: There you are!",

        "Adriana: Hmm. Oh, surprised?",
        "Rex: Big-time. How'd you know I was here?",
        "Adriana: Simple -- Gigi's here, and these days you seem to always be where Gigi is.",

        "Langston: Look, Starr, I'm not judging you about this. It's just you've never mentioned it before.",
        "Starr: Langston, we both know that I have two options -- it's either I have this baby in eight months or -- or I don't.",
        "Langston: All right, well, just find out everything you can about having an abortion and -- and think about how you're going to feel afterwards.",
        "Starr: Langston? Come on, if I have this baby, that means that my parents find out. And my dad will kill Cole.",
        "Langston: Look, I -- I know he said that before, but he really wouldn't do that, would he?",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? Come on, he beat up Cole when we tried to run away together, he beat him up when he found us in bed. If he finds out that I'm pregnant, I wouldn't be surprised at anything that he would do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Shaun, take a break.",
        "Cole: I didn't come here to fight you. I just want to talk to you about Starr.",
        "Todd: So I'm ruining her life, am I?",
        "Cole: That's right.",
        "Todd: She tell you that? Did you do the one thing I told you not to do, Cole? Have you contacted my daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Stop!",
        "Eddie: Should I get in there, Commissioner? It looks like they're beating the crap out of each other. Sahid's screaming, Sir.",
        "Ramsey: Well, I'm sure this is very upsetting for her but I -- I think it's better if Vega and McBain work this out.",
        "Antonio: Hmm!",
        "John: Ah! Ah!",
        "Talia: Stop, stop, stop!",

        "Eddie: Oh, man.",
        "John: Come on, man. What do you say we don't do this anymore?",
        "Talia: I'm so sorry.",
        "Antonio: Sorry about what? That you did it or that I caught the two of you?",
        "Talia: If you would just calm down, I --",
        "Antonio: Ramsey was right! He was right about you all along, wasn't he, McBain?",
        "John: Leave Ramsey out of this.",
        "Antonio: He said not to trust you, and he was right! You take what you want and you don't care about anyone else! You're perfect for each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm always with Gigi -- what's that supposed to mean?",

        "Rex: I hope not.",

        "Rex: Right.",
        "Adriana: Right.",
        "Rex: Hmm.",
        "Adriana: But now, I'm back and you know what they say about all work and no play? I was going to wait for you at home but then I found your cell phone, so I decided to come hunt you down.",
        "Rex: I didn't realize I left it home.",
        "Adriana: Well, maybe you were preoccupied. Hmm.",
        "Gigi: Well, I have to get back to work.",
        "Rex: I'll see you, okay?",
        "Gigi: Sure.",
        "Adriana: A Bient\u00f4t.",

        "Rex: Ah, Clint sent me a text, like, an hour ago. I need to see him.",
        "Adriana: Now?",
        "Rex: It's my job, honey.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Rex: But, listen, you go home, you slip into something minimal, and I'll be home soon.",
        "Adriana: Okay.",
        "Rex: Deal?",
        "Adriana: Deal. Hurry home.",

        "Marcie: You have become quite the writer.",
        "Shane: My mom told me you wrote a book.",
        "Marcie: Uh -- yeah, I did. It was a while ago, though.",
        "Markko: It was a great book.",
        "Marcie: You read it?",
        "Markko: Yeah. I was, like, \"Whoa. This was written by a high school English teacher -- and a mom.\" Oh, wow, I'm sorry.",
        "Marcie: No, it's fine. I was a teacher and a mom. It's fine.",
        "Markko: Hey, those drawings are tight, Shane.",
        "Shane: Is \"tight\" a good thing?",
        "Markko: Yeah, man. It reminds me of some of the stuff I'm reading in this graphic novel right now.",
        "Shane: What's a graphic novel?",
        "Markko: Oh, a graphic novel -- well, I've got one in my backpack. You can check it out if you want.",
        "Marcie: Whoa, wait, wait -- wait a minute. Is it age-appropriate?",
        "Markko: Yes, of course, Mrs. McBain.",
        "Marcie: Okay, okay.",
        "Markko: Come on.",
        "Shane: Cool.",
        "Marcie: You're back.",
        "Michael: Surprise. I'm glad I caught you. I have a half-hour break.",
        "Marcie: And you wanted to spend it with me?",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Michael: It has been unbelievable since I got there. Two car wrecks, one with a fatality, a drug overdose that was dumped at the door by his friends, an abandoned baby that was this close to hypothermia. I don't know why I just told you that.",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry.",
        "Michael: But --",
        "Marcie: I'm so sorry. That must've been really hard for you to deal with, you know?",
        "Michael: No, I just, you know -- I just, I'm -- I can't -- I can't let myself think about it -- well, at least not yet.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. What happened -- with the baby?",
        "Michael: He was a newborn. You don't want to know the details. It was probably a terrified teenage mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You know, there's another problem with this whole abortion thing.",
        "Starr: Aside from the obvious?",
        "Langston: Yeah -- you're underage. You can't get an abortion without your mom or dad signing off on it.",
        "Starr: I can in New Jersey.",
        "Langston: Wow -- you checked? Well, how are you going to get there? I mean, Shaun's on your trail 24/7.",
        "Starr: Okay, is this your way of helping me out?",
        "Langston: This is my way of being realistic.",
        "Starr: Well, I have the realism part covered, okay? I just -- I really need your help. I mean, you made everybody think that you had parents this whole time when you didn't.",
        "Langston: Why would you --",
        "Starr: I -- it's just that you're really good at lying and making plans, and this is what I need right now -- I need a plan.",
        "Langston: All right, well, you can't tell your parents.",
        "Starr: So there's really no good way out of this?",
        "Langston: Well, there are, but your options just suck.",
        "Starr: No, I'll do anything, okay? I'll risk anything to make sure that my dad doesn't find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I asked you a question. Have you been speaking to Starr?",
        "Cole: No, because she's too freaked out because of you.",
        "Todd: Hmm. So -- huh. So after what I saw, after what you did to her, you are blameless in this? Is that it?",
        "Cole: We didn't think we were ever going to see each other again, all right? And you decide to move to Hawaii the next day, not even giving Starr a vote.",
        "Todd: So this is my fault?",
        "Cole: Well, we were there because of you.",
        "Todd: Yeah. It's always someone else's fault, isn't it? The first time you tried to rape Starr, it was what -- 'roid rage. Now, it's me, I --",
        "Cole: Hey, listen, I love Starr.",
        "Todd: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You can't talk to me about love. You're just a little creep. You wanted sex from my daughter. And I think about it and I just want to break every bone in your body.",
        "[Todd sighs]",
        "Todd: And the only reason you're still standing here is because I got there soon enough to stop you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You think I'm a terrible person, don't you, Langston?",
        "Langston: Of course not, Starr, but, I mean, I'm just trying to read all this so I can understand it better.",
        "Starr: What's there to understand? You go into the clinic and you're pregnant and you leave and you're not.",
        "Langston: Oh. I know that you don't think for one minute that it's that simple.",
        "Starr: You're right -- I don't. But I can't think about that because if I think about that, then I'm going to go out of my mind.",
        "Langston: You have to think about this. This is a major decision you have to live with for the rest of your life. You can't change it.",
        "Starr: I know that, Langston. Okay? I wouldn't even have to be thinking about this if I wasn't so stupid.",
        "Langston: Starr, you're not stupid.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I am. I was stupid for having sex with Cole and Cole was stupid for having sex with me. I mean, how many lectures have we had on safe sex? When you do have sex, you should use protection. Oh, my gosh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Why aren't you with Rex?",
        "Adriana: Because you and I nee to have a little chat.",
        "Gigi: About what?",
        "Adriana: About the fact that as soon as I leave town, you're all over Rex like a cheap suit. If you're trying to turn my fianc\u00e9 into Shane's new daddy, you're messing with the wrong lady.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Ramsey said you did the same thing to him!",
        "John: Ramsey's a liar.",
        "Antonio: You know what? I don't -- I don't know why I give a damn about you. But fair warning -- every woman that this guy has hooked up with has ended up dead or damaged! I'm done with you -- with the both of you.",
        "Eddie: You look like hell.",
        "Antonio: Shut up, Eddie. Get me the hell out of here.",
        "[Car starts]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: So, it was Adriana's idea for you to look into Gigi's past and this guy she said was Shane's father?",
        "Dorian: It was a mutual decision.",
        "Layla: If Gigi wanted Rex, wouldn't she be trying to convince him that he is Shane's dad?",
        "Dorian: But the more Gigi denies, the more Rex is interested.",
        "Layla: But now that you know the father was real, doesn't that mean the game's over?",
        "Dorian: Something doesn't add up.",
        "Layla: How so?",
        "Dorian: Look, all I know is that I want Adriana to be happy and at peace on her wedding day. Well, it's the most important day of a woman's life.",
        "Layla: Gigi isn't competition for Adriana.",
        "Dorian: And I intend to make sure it stays that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I have raised Shane all by myself for his entire life.",
        "Adriana: Maybe you got tired of it. Maybe you saw Rex and thought of the good old days.",
        "Gigi: We were kids! Did you fly all the way back from Paris for this?",
        "Adriana: I fight for what I love, and I love Rex.",
        "Gigi: My God, Adriana. We were having a conversation in a boardroom, not a motel room.",
        "Adriana: Huh. Well, of course -- I know that could never happen.",
        "Gigi: No, it never would. In case you haven't noticed, Rex loves you, too.",
        "Adriana: I know he does.",
        "Gigi: In fact, he keeps telling me how lucky he is to have you and you know what? I'm just -- I'm not the type to horn in on something like that.",
        "Adriana: Well, maybe you're not. But what I walked in on looked pretty intense.",
        "Gigi: Rex and I have history, but it's ancient history.",
        "Adriana: Why were you talking about Shane?",
        "Gigi: I always talk about Shane. He's my son, he's my life.",
        "Adriana: Rex took Shane to school this morning -- did you set that up?",
        "Gigi: Oh. I I had to be at work early. Rex offered and Shane likes Rex.",
        "Adriana: I ran into Shane and Marcie before I came here. Shane was talking about what a hero his dad was. He was even writing stories about him.",
        "Gigi: You talked to Shane about his father? Why would you do that, Adriana?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I wanted Cole to make love to me because I thought that I was never going to see him again. But I knew -- I knew in the back of my mind that it was the wrong thing to do, that it was stupid, but I didn't listen. Please, Langston? You have to promise me that you will never make the mistake that I did.",
        "Langston: I promise, okay? Did you finish eating yet?",
        "Starr: No. Oh. You know what would go really good with this?",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: A jelly doughnut.",
        "Langston: Huh. Okay, if you want to keep the fact that you're pregnant a secret, you got to keep these cravings between you and me.",
        "Starr: That is a craving, isn't it?",
        "Langston: Yeah. You're still hungry, aren't you?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I'm starving.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, let's just go downstairs and we'll try and get you something that you like, okay?",
        "Starr: You really have no idea how much it means to me to have you around, do you?",
        "Langston: You have no idea how much it means to me to feel like we're a family. Come on. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Okay, I know you don't believe me, but I do love Starr. And --",
        "Todd: Stop right there.",
        "Cole: What you walked in on was two people in love who thought they were never going to see each other again.",
        "Todd: You're a punk -- just a punk. You don't know the first thing about love.",
        "Cole: Well, I know more than you know.",
        "Todd: Wow. You're really begging for it, aren't you?",
        "Cole: I would never do to Starr what you have. You know, she's not afraid of you. She's just afraid of what you'll do to me. I can only imagine the things that she's said to you since you did this to her.",
        "Todd: I don't really care what she says to me -- I'm never going to let you near her again.",
        "Cole: Yeah? What if you can't do that?",
        "Todd: Oh, I can do it right now. Didn't I tell you that I will see you dead before I let you near my daughter?",
        "Langston: Cole's here.",
        "Starr: My dad's threatening to kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I was at the diner looking for Rex, and Shane was there with Marcie.",
        "Gigi: And you quizzed my kid about his father?",
        "Adriana: No. Shane was showing Marcie something he had drawn, and it was about his father. I didn't quiz anybody.",
        "Gigi: I wish you would just stay away from both of us.",
        "Adriana: Me, too, but I can't. Because you're Rex's friend, and Rex is my fianc\u00e9. Actually, it was sweet to see how much Shane thinks of his father. I mean, how many kids draw comic books where their dad's the superhero?",
        "Gigi: He -- he made a comic book up about his father?",
        "Adriana: A superhero who saves the world.",
        "Gigi: Well -- Shane's father was the kind of guy that everyone took to. Everyone loved him. Me, most of all.",
        "Adriana: It sure would be a disappointment to Shane if he found out his father wasn't the hero he's been told he was.",
        "Gigi: Excuse me?",
        "Adriana: I just mean, Shane has such a strong image of his father in his mind. How could anyone live up to that?",
        "Gigi: Well, Shane's father didn't live, period.",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry. If Shane had to live with that, I think it's really great that you gave him an image of his father that could never get tarnished. I'll let you get back to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Shane, how's it going?",
        "Shane: Good. Thanks for helping me with my math homework the other night.",
        "Michael: No problem.",
        "Shane: Oh, I looked up Mike Landino on the internet.",
        "Michael: Yeah?",
        "Marcie: How do you know who Mike Landino is?",
        "Shane: Dr. McBain gave me his rookie card.",
        "Marcie: You did?",
        "Michael: Why not?",
        "Marcie: Well, Michael, I thought that you were saving that for --",
        "Michael: I was, but I decided to give it to Shane.",
        "Shane: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",

        "Marcie: This -- this was on my summer reading list that I gave you.",
        "Markko: How do you think I found out about it?",
        "Marcie: I just thought that you would throw it out. You know, and forget everything that I taught you as soon as you knew I wasn't coming back to school.",
        "Markko: What? No way.",
        "Shane: It's a graphic novel. You know what that is?",
        "Michael: Mm-hmm. Marcie taught me about them, too.",
        "Shane: I wrote a comic book about my dad.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, he did.",
        "Shane: But I think I can make it into one of these.",
        "Michael: You made a comic book about your father?",
        "Marcie: He did, it's great.",
        "Shane: I made him a superhero. Well, he was a Navy Seal, and they all are heroes.",
        "Michael: My dad was a cop. He was a hero to me, too. All right. Oh -- I need to go back to the hospital. So I will see you guys later. See you. I will call you. I'll probably be late.",
        "Marcie: Okay. Markko, could you come here with Shane for a second? I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Markko: Yeah, sure.",
        "Marcie: Mike, you were going to give that baseball card to Tommy.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I can't do that now, so I thought I'd give it to a kid who doesn't have a dad to hand him down anything.",
        "Marcie: It was really sweet.",
        "Michael: I was hanging on to my dad's police cap for Tommy, too, and -- well, I think I'll give it to John.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Then maybe he'll be able to give it to his kid one day.",

        "John: I'm okay. How about you?",
        "Talia: I'm -- I'm fine. Well -- ahem -- come here.",
        "John: It couldn't have been easy for you.",

        "Ramsey: That's not a problem. I'll be there and I'll have the money. I'm just hoping this time, it works. I don't want to be disappointed again. Been a little too much of that. I'll be in touch. What?",
        "Antonio: You set me up.",
        "Ramsey: What?",
        "Antonio: You wanted me to see John and Talia in bed together! You wanted to rub my face in it! Well, you going to say something?",

        "Cole: You can't keep Starr and me apart forever.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, I can. I mean, shooting Miles Laurence should give you 10 to 15 years, minimum.",
        "Cole: You can't keep holding that over my head, either.",
        "Todd: Really? I just have to call Lee Ramsey. Then you're booked, done. And John McBain won't be able to get you out of it this time.",
        "Cole: All right, listen, I know you hate me, that you wish I would just disappear, but you're not that cruel.",
        "Todd: Cruel? No, it's serving justice. And keeping you away from my daughter. It's kind of a two-for-one deal for me. And don't you think that people who shoot other people and take advantage of minors should suffer?",
        "Cole: You think I haven't suffered?",
        "Todd: What happened to your little mom -- poor little mom -- total separate issue.",
        "Cole: That's what this is about, isn't it? What you did to my mom?",
        "Todd: How do you figure?",
        "Cole: Because you raped her. And now, she's dead.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Cole: So you can't make it up to her. Hey, does it -- does it make you feel better, telling yourself that I'm no better than you are? Huh? Let me tell you something. I would never do to Starr what you did to my mom. Because I am nothing like you!",

If you don't stay away from my daughter, your life is going to be absolutely worthless. Are we clear, you little bastard? Now I'd like you to leave my house. Okay? If you come anywhere near me or my wife, or my daughter, I'm going to end you -- I am going to end you. Because you are going to be dead, or in prison. Now, you get the hell out of here!",
        "Todd: Don't say another word. Don't say another word.",

        "Starr: Well, yeah. Did you hear my dad?",
        "Langston: Yes, I heard him.",
        "Starr: Do you understand why I have to do this? Now do you see why this is my only choice?",

        "Marcie: Well, are you kidding? It's no problem. No problem. So what happened in your day? Hmm? Come on. Come on, don't you know by now that there's nothing you can't tell me?",
        "Gigi: I don't want to dish to you about one of your friends.",

        "Marcie: I think that she is stressed about the wedding.",
        "Gigi: I'm sure. But when I first met her, I thought no wonder Rex loves her. She's beautiful, smart, and sweet. Now I think she's beautiful, smart, and a bitch. What's up with that?",

        "Adriana: Hi. Mom and Layla were just telling me that they have to go.",
        "Rex: Did you make a stop on your way here?",
        "Adriana: What?",
        "Rex: Well, I thought you'd beat me by 20 minutes, but I saw you race up here as I pulled in.",
        "Adriana: Right. I went to go pick up some wine.",
        "Dorian: And it's being delivered, and that's why you don't have it with you?",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm. Mom, Layla, I know you have things to do, so you don't have to stay here and entertain me and Rex.",

        "Antonio: You wanted me to see John and Talia in bed together?",
        "Ramsey: Well, now, I didn't like doing it like that, but I knew you had to see it with your own eyes.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, you could have given me a heads-up!",
        "Ramsey: Would you have believed me if I told you Sahid and McBain were sneaking around behind your back? See, I didn't think so. But you have to know the kind of man John McBain really is, and you had to see that for yourself.",
        "Antonio: Do you have any idea what that felt like for me?",
        "Ramsey: Yes, yes, I do. And I'm sorry about the sting aspect. But I'm not sorry you know the truth. Now, don't be too hard on Sahid. She just fell victim to McBain's pouty stuff. Not that he's not going to screw her over like every other woman he's ever been with. But she's a good cop, and I don't want this -- this thing with McBain to jeopardize her. Okay? So I'm sorry again about what I did, but I'm not sorry you know.",
        "Antonio: Thanks.",
        "Ramsey: Okay.",
        "Antonio: I guess. Look, I -- I know you hate McBain, and I know you want everyone else to hate him, too, but I -- I needed to know the truth.",
        "Ramsey: Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Now, one more thing. You think you can work with the two of them? Because I can't change their status here yet.",
        "Antonio: I can handle it.",
        "Antonio: Not a word.",
        "Talia: We need to talk.",
        "Antonio: The time for talking was before you started sleeping with John. Now, I'm going to go have a drink. And then I'm going to go pick up my daughter. In the meantime, I want you to stop by the loft and I want you to take out anything and everything that belongs to you. And I mean everything.",

        "Adriana: Wow, I wish you hadn't have done that.",

        "Rex: You lost me.",

        "Gigi: Well, maybe she and I need to stay out of each other's way.",
        "Marcie: Hmm.",
