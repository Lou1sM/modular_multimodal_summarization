        "Langston: Hey. How many times are you going to read that thing?",
        "Starr: I -- I just keep thinking that I'm missing something.",
        "Langston: Does that mean you changed your mind about the abortion?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, where have you been?",
        "Cole: I had some stuff to do.",
        "Markko: Well, it better be important. Coach is benching you this Saturday at the scrimmage because you missed practice yesterday. I mean, I tried to cover for --",
        "Cole: Yeah, I don't care about a stupid scrimmage, all right? I went to see Starr's dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I decided that there was no way that I could go through with this unless I was 100% positive.",
        "Langston: Good.",
        "Starr: And -- and I don't know how to keep this secret from my parents.",
        "Langston: Exactly.",
        "Starr: And plus, even though I'm 16, I can still go through with this, right? It doesn't mean I can't do it.",
        "Langston: Right, so you're going to have the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I don't see what this article has to do with us.",
        "Nora: We had dinner together last night, and you knew this was coming out this morning and you didn't tell me about it. I mean, did you think I wouldn't see it?",
        "Clint: It's \"The Sun.\" Nobody pays attention to \"The Sun.\"",
        "Nora: I mean, I -- I understand your wanting to downplay it because certainly it's not something you're particularly proud of.",
        "Clint: Well, I'm not ashamed, Nora. But evidently, you think I should be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So you had no idea that Todd was running this piece?",
        "Jessica: No! No, I would've said something to him, but you know, with all of these anonymous sources and lack of detail, I -- I think he made this up. This doesn't sound like Dad or Uncle Bo.",
        "Natalie: It's definitely not Uncle Bo.",
        "Jessica: Are -- are you saying this is true? That Dad actually screwed with these men's lives because, what -- they were a business threat?",
        "Natalie: I'm afraid so.",
        "Jessica: All right -- has he lost his mind?",
        "Natalie: Maybe.",
        "Jessica: Okay, I got to go talk to him.",
        "Natalie: Wait. You know, we've already -- we've all tried -- oh, except Jared here --",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Because he -- well, he thinks what Dad did was just swell -- well, because he thinks that lying and blackmail and doing whatever it takes to get ahead is okay.",
        "Jared: See, your father wasn't trying to get ahead -- he was trying to protect the company. These guys were going to ruin us. Would you rather he just roll over, play dead, and let them take the company -- your inheritance and Bree's future?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Natalie: Hello? Hey, how are you?",
        "[Jared whispers]",
        "Natalie: No. No, I definitely didn't hear that. I mean, I'm sure it's just squad room gossip. Yeah, but we just saw John and Talia together at -- they were just -- get out of here. A motel room?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Close the door, will you? Now, I'm not usually a back patter, but I just have to tell you again -- your future's looking very bright here. I'm going to throw a couple of more important cases your way.",
        "Antonio: I'll do my best.",
        "Ramsey: I know you will, and I realize the two of us have a common goal -- getting rid of John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Fellas.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Cristian: What the hell happened to you?",
        "[John sighs]",
        "Cristian: Hope the other guy got the worst end of it.",
        "John: No, you don't. The other guy was your brother.",
        "Cristian: Well, what did you guys fight about? I mean, I heard -- I heard some stuff about you moving in on Talia, but --",
        "John: He found us together.",
        "Cristian: Where?",
        "John: A motel room.",
        "Cristian: What? You took my brother's girlfriend to a motel room? You son of a bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I'm a professional. If I have to work with these people, then so be it.",
        "Ramsey: Even though the whole department knows she cheated on you with that guy? Well, maybe you can handle it but I don't trust the rest of them to. First time I saw you and Sahid, you looked like such a happy couple. That's why I relaxed the fraternization policy.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, then maybe you should've stuck with it.",
        "[Ramsey sighs]",
        "Ramsey: Huh, what's her problem? You're not rich enough anymore?",
        "Antonio: Ah, she doesn't care about that.",
        "Ramsey: Well, maybe she doesn't understand what it's like to be a single parent knowing somebody else's life depends on you towing the line.",
        "Antonio: Right, right. Well, well, you know obviously I don't know what she's thinking.",
        "Ramsey: Well, you do your job. You don't argue, you follow the rules. John McBain couldn't figure that out in a million years. You hang in there, Leon.",
        "Antonio: No problem.",
        "Talia: Antonio, I'd like to talk to you. Please don't -- please don't walk away from me this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: No, no, thanks for -- thanks for telling me. So, listen, why don't you call me and let me know when you want to do lunch next week, okay? Thanks, bye.",
        "Jessica: Who was that?",
        "Natalie: Ahem -- it was just a friend of mine from the police station. She was telling me how Antonio found John and Talia at a motel together.",
        "Jessica: Oh, God, you're kidding me.",
        "Jared: I'm not sure why you guys are so surprised. I mean, we saw them at Capricorn the other night. They sure looked like they were ready to get a room then.",
        "Jessica: You know, I -- had heard that Antonio thought that this relationship with Talia was really special, and now he has to go to work with her every day and everybody at work knows about it. Oh, my God.",
        "Natalie: I know, and this does not seem like John, you know? There's got to be more to this story.",
        "Jared: Okay, you know, we have a lot of work to do here, so if you guys could wait till after hours to gossip about each other's exes' love lives --",
        "Natalie: Bite me.",
        "Jessica: You know what -- you know what I find funny about this whole thing?",
        "Jared: Hmm?",
        "Jessica: Um -- my mother, Uncle Bo, and I were wondering how my dad dug up that dirt to get that guy to back off. So, you come in, saying it was a smart business move, and I was wondering -- maybe you're behind it, Jared.",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: No, but if I had been, you'd owe me a big thank-you, and -- come on, we're all familiar with Asa's will. Stock price goes up, you get your inheritance, it goes down, you and your kid are out of luck. And you might need the cash to prop up Nash's vineyards, so --",
        "Natalie: Well, that sounds like sour grapes to me.",
        "Jared: Funny.",
        "Jessica: Jared, are you regretting selling off your interest?",
        "Jared: Oh -- uh, no, actually. I -- I sold at exactly the right time.",
        "Jessica: Why the hell would you say that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So you are proud of what you did?",
        "Clint: I'm proud of the company that my father built. And I'm proud to be a Buchanan. And being a Buchanan, certain responsibilities come along with that and I'm not going to shrink from them.",
        "Nora: I don't know why, but I think I would've felt better if you'd just stated it for what it is -- money and power.",
        "Clint: That's so far from the truth. I did this solely for the family.",
        "Nora: You threatened them? You -- you blackmailed these men in the name of all your family who you love because you love them so much?",
        "Clint: You don't even know what I did.",
        "Nora: No, I don't, Clint. Would I feel better if I knew the details?",
        "Clint: I can't talk about the details on advice from the legal department.",
        "Nora: So, in other words, you don't really want me to know how low you were willing to go?",
        "Clint: Two different men came after this company in ways that they don't teach in business school. Now, I had to react with business in kind.",
        "Nora: Okay. But there were alternatives -- you could've gone to the S.E.C. You didn't have to handle it like a back-alley swindler!",
        "Clint: Nora, they made the first move. Believe me; we did what we had to do.",
        "Nora: Who's \"we\"? Who is the \"we\"? I know Bo wasn't involved. Bo would never --",
        "Clint: Hey, Nora, I'm not Bo! And I have the suspicion that that's really what this is about, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I was afraid that's where you were. And then, I thought, \"No, no, no. He wouldn't be crazy enough to actually go see Starr's dad.\"",
        "Cole: No, I just wanted to talk to him, try to get him to understand how much I love Starr and how much he's hurting her.",
        "Markko: And how'd that work out for you?",
        "Cole: It didn't. He hates me more than ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I really think you're making the right decision.",
        "Starr: I know I am. I'm going to go through with it.",
        "Langston: The pregnancy?",
        "Starr: No, the abortion.",
        "Langston: But you just said that you --",
        "Starr: Langston, I don't have a choice. I mean, you see the way my dad treats Cole and he doesn't even think that we've had sex. Imagine if he knew that I was pregnant.",
        "Langston: But your dad loves you. You don't think he'd see you through this?",
        "Starr: Langston, he doesn't care about me -- not really. If he did, he wouldn't be treating Cole this way.",
        "Langston: Starr, he's just trying to protect you.",
        "Starr: Look, you said that you were going to help me. If you've changed your mind, you need to let me know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: No, I -- I'm just saying I think you should give Starr's dad some space and maybe he'll find somebody else to make miserable.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'll be dead by then.",
        "Markko: He let Starr come back to school -- right?",
        "Cole: With a bodyguard, all right? And he told Shaun last night if I came anywhere near Starr to call him.",
        "Markko: I would not want that guy to beat me up.",
        "Cole: Well, I'm not afraid. I just don't want to make things worse for Starr -- or go to jail.",
        "Markko: He can't put you in jail. Look, if he told you that, he was just trying to --",
        "Cole: Mr. Manning has a lot of power in this town. And believe me, Starr and I know that he would use it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Look, Langston, you have to promise me that once this whole thing is done and over with, only you and I can know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Things are going great with the vineyard now and it's the funniest thing, you know, because everything fell into place after you let Nash buy you out.",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah, I --",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Jared: Heard about Nash's big plans, but big plans mean big money, big money means big risk.",
        "Natalie: Okay, excuse me, but were you not the one who said that we can't talk about nonbusiness things in my office, and I don't know -- is Nash's vineyard B.E. business?",
        "Jared: Okay, fine. I won't worry about you or your future. And if you want to give me more grief about taking care of you, then go for it.",
        "Natalie: Could you try to find out who Todd's sources are and maybe try to get them to stop printing this crap, or at least let you know first?",
        "Jessica: Yes. I don't know why everybody in our family has to be so crazy.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I wish I knew.",
        "Jessica: Anyways, I got to go. Nash is coming home today.",
        "Jared: Ooh.",
        "Natalie: Oh, well, then get out of here.",
        "Jessica: Okay. See you later, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Bye.",
        "Jared: Bye-bye.",
        "Natalie: Okay, so -- I think we need to call P.R., try to see if they can maybe spin this article somehow.",
        "Jared: Give it up, sparks.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Jared: Pretending you're not dying to get out of here and ask John McBain what's going on.",
        "Natalie: I don't care.",
        "Jared: Really? Could've fooled me.",
        "Natalie: And what would you do if I told you that I care about John? Would that make you jealous, Uncle Jared?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, I'm -- I'm so sorry, Clint. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. It -- I really didn't. I'm sorry.",
        "Clint: It's okay. Anyway, you're right. Bo doesn't approve, but then again, he's always been a by-the-book kind of guy. That's why he divorced you.",
        "Nora: Oh, oh -- okay. That felt like a cheap shot.",
        "Clint: Well, it wasn't meant to be. Nora, I know how much you respect the law, but I also know that you make allowances for certain situations just like I do.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Clint: And I'm sorry if you felt that I was attacking you.",
        "Nora: And I'm sorry, I -- I didn't come in here to attack you. I'm sorry, Clint.",
        "Clint: I need you to understand something. I'm the eldest son. When Pa died, I became head of the family. I'm also the one who spent all that time in the trenches with Pa.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Now you're right when you say that Bo would never do what I did, but Pa would have.",
        "Nora: Yeah, yeah. I -- I know.",
        "Clint: You loved Asa.",
        "Nora: I sure did.",
        "Clint: So I think you know what he wanted me to do. Nora, you saw firsthand what Webster was doing to Buchanan Enterprises. We were hemorrhaging money. I had to stop it.",
        "Nora: Couldn't you have just come to me? Couldn't you have --",
        "Clint: There wasn't --",
        "Nora: Let me do something for you?",
        "Clint: There wasn't time to go through the proper channels -- he was sitting here in this office! What did you want me to do -- let him steamroll us? And if your answer is yes, what about the rest of the family? If this company were to go down, what would I say to the family? What would I say to Matthew? This company is their future and this company and their future meant everything to Asa.",
        "Nora: I know.",
        "Clint: Why do you think he set up his will the way he did -- because he wanted us to fight for this company.",
        "Nora: Did he want us to fight dirty, though?",
        "Clint: I think he wanted us to fight in the manner that he would have. And -- and that's all I did. Was Asa a horrible person?",
        "Nora: Sometimes.",
        "Clint: So what am I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Unless this has something to do with work, we have nothing to talk about.",
        "Talia: We -- we have to find a way to work together, okay? But you haven't spoken to me in days, even before you broke up with me -- that is, assuming \"I'm done\" meant you were done with me. Right? And those are the only two words you've been able to say to me. So the way I understood it, I was free to do whatever the hell I wanted to with whomever I wanted to do it with.",
        "Antonio: Whatever works.",
        "Talia: I'm just explaining.",
        "Antonio: What are you trying to explain, Sahid? I caught you -- in bed at a motel with John. Did I hallucinate?",
        "Talia: No.",
        "Antonio: Then there's nothing else I need to know.",
        "Talia: God, I am tired of looking at your back, Antonio. Do you know how many times you've walked away from me when I'm just -- I was just trying to be with you? Well, if you're trying to drive me away, congratulations. You finally did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ah, come on. I don't want to fight with you, Cris.",
        "Cristian: Why'd you come to my family's business?",
        "John: I was hungry. I knew where my mouth was going to be.",
        "Cristian: You move in on Natalie when she's with me, and now you do the same thing to my brother. I think you need to be taught a lesson, John.",
        "John: Oh, yeah? Well, you know, I'm pretty tired, but if you want to take it outside --",
        "Cristian: Hey, damn right I do.",
        "Bo: Hey, no, whoa, whoa. What's going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Do you want to go on like this forever?",
        "Natalie: What exactly do you want me to do, Jared -- turn you in so you can go to jail? Because believe me, nothing would make me happier but I do care about my family, but I would do it just to get you out of my face.",
        "Jared: You want me out of your face? Fine. I'll go back to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You're not a horrible man, Clint. It's just that I was -- I was starting to have very strong feelings for you.",
        "Clint: I hope you understand the pressure that I'm under and the responsibilities that I have.",
        "Nora: I want you to understand I have them, too. Clint, I'm the district attorney.",
        "Clint: I swear to God I didn't do anything illegal.",
        "Nora: Okay. Good. Because I wouldn't want to have to throw the book at you.",
        "Clint: Huh. And you'd do it, too, if it came to that?",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Nora, you keep me honest.",
        "Nora: Clint Buchanan, you were honest long before I ever met you.",
        "Clint: You're still not convinced?",
        "Nora: Of what?",
        "Clint: That I did the right thing.",
        "Nora: What you did may not have been illegal, but it -- it still feels a little oily.",
        "Clint: Well, I'm not going to apologize to you or to anybody else. If I had to do it over again, I would to protect the integrity of this company.",
        "Nora: \"Integrity\"? I'm sorry -- that's just a very interesting choice of words.",
        "Clint: I'm the same man I was, the same man who kissed you down at the ranch.",
        "Nora: Well, maybe I just didn't know who you were.",
        "Clint: You did, and you do.",
        "Nora: Well, you've got a lot of work -- I'll let you get back to it.",
        "Clint: Nora? Are we okay?",
        "Nora: Oh, I'll see you at home, Clint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: This guy screwed over my brother. He took Talia into a motel room.",
        "John: Is this really any of your business?",
        "Cristian: My business -- of course it's my business.",
        "Bo: No, no, wait, wait -- hold it! Hey, Cris, do me a favor, okay? Just go somewhere, cool off, please? I mean, you don't want to tear this place up -- I'm begging you. Just -- can you take a walk? Thanks. Okay, what is really going on here? Do you -- do you expect me to believe this? You and Antonio are friends.",
        "John: Ramsey has turned Antonio into somebody I don't even recognize anymore, Bo.",
        "Bo: Oh, give me a break. Antonio's under a lot of stress right now. He lost his club and a lot of money --",
        "John: You know what he is? He's under Ramsey's thumb.",
        "Bo: And this is your story and, what, you're sticking to it?",
        "John: It's the truth.",
        "Bo: If you say so.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Huh -- jeez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You climb into bed with my friend, and I'm the problem?",
        "Talia: I wasn't blaming you. I was just telling you --",
        "Antonio: I knew there was something going on which is why I couldn't even look at you, Sahid.",
        "Talia: Well, you were wrong.",
        "Antonio: Yeah?",
        "Talia: Yes.",
        "Antonio: That little -- that little act, that little shy, insecure thing that you had going on, that was just to -- to bring me in, right? Just to -- to take advantage, to use me --",
        "Talia: What?",
        "Antonio: As a steppingstone, wasn't it? You going to work through the rest of the department now, Sahid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Oh, hey, hey. We've got that standup meeting with coach before lunch. We should go.",
        "Starr: You know, once I turn 18, my dad won't be in complete control of me and although two years seems like a long way away, Cole and I will be together then.",
        "Langston: Starr, when are you going to tell him?",
        "Starr: I'm not.",
        "Langston: So you're going to lie to him forever?",
        "Starr: Langston, I can't even be in the same room as him. I'm not allowed. How can I tell him something like this?",
        "Langston: Okay. So what happens two years from now when you guys are back together, planning your future? How do you keep something like this --",
        "Starr: This is my life, Langston, not yours, okay?",
        "Langston: I know that, Starr, but it's Cole's baby, too. I mean, don't you think he deserves to know about this before you follow through with it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hi. Um -- I'm Jessica Buchanan Brennan and --",
        "Eddie: I know. I -- I would never forget a face like that. Eddie Barton.",
        "Jessica: Hello. I'm looking for Antonio Vega?",
        "Eddie: Oh. I'll track him down for you.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Talia: Hi.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Talia: Can I help you?",
        "Jessica: No, you can't. I'm looking for Antonio.",
        "Talia: Police business?",
        "Jessica: Do I have to run it by you?",

        "Jessica: Good news travels fast.",
        "Talia: Great.",
        "Eddie: Hey. I'm sorry I couldn't find Vega. Poor guy just -- just can't seem to get lucky around here.",
        "Ramsey: Barton!",
        "Talia: Eddie --",
        "Jessica: Do you have any idea how much Antonio cared for you?",
        "Talia: Okay, cut the crap, Jessica. After what you did to him, how dare you sit in judgment of me.",

        "Starr: You're trying really hard to talk me out of this, Langston, aren't you?",
        "Langston: Starr, I just want you to be 100% sure. I mean, what if next week your dad decides that you and Cole can see each other again?",
        "Starr: Oh -- then that'll be great! Then we can get married and we can raise our child together. Langston, I'm 16 and he's 17. I get cranky when I have to baby-sit Sam and Jack.",
        "Langston: Huh -- but you love Cole.",
        "Starr: You're right -- I do love him. That's why how can I bring a baby in this world and tell him that the reason why his daddy is in jail is because of him?",
        "Langston: You really think your dad would go through with that?",
        "Starr: Yes, I do. I didn't think it before, but now I'm completely sure.",
        "Langston: Oh, what -- what about adoption?",
        "Starr: Adoption? Then my dad still finds out that I'm pregnant and Cole gets killed or thrown in jail. There is no happy ending to this, Langston! Now, I have been forced to make an awful decision and I need you to back me up on this.",
        "Langston: All right, I will. Come here.",
        "Starr: Oh.",

        "Clint: Even though she thinks the acquisition was handled badly?",
        "Jared: Look, if you could've done things any differently, obviously you would have. I mean, I was there and I watched you try like hell.",
        "Clint: Yeah. You know, Bo and Natalie -- and Nora -- they're unindoctrinated in the ways of business.",
        "Jared: Yeah. Bottom line is Cobb was trying to put this company out of business. What were you supposed to do -- go into couples therapy with the guy?",
        "Clint: I'm sorry that Asa never got the opportunity to know you. He would've been proud.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You okay? You're upset about last night, right? Heard me and your dad arguing? Listen, I'm sorry. I know I told you I was going to give it up, but I just couldn't do it.",
        "Starr: Thank you for trying, but my dad's never going to budge about us.",
        "Cole: I don't care how long it takes -- I'm going to wait for you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "Starr: Still?",
        "Cole: Yeah, still. I love you so much.",

        "Bo: Matthew's speech was great. I wanted to punch some other kid's dad right in the face, though, over that article in \"The Sun.\"",
        "Clint: No wonder Nora was upset.",
        "Bo: She was upset before that.",
        "Clint: Well, I tell you what -- I ruined a perfectly good evening by not telling her about the article.",
        "Bo: Was she able to change your mind at all, about any of this?",
        "Clint: If you're looking for contrition, you came to the wrong place. Are you here to work or to resign?",

        "Cristian: I hear you.",
        "Nora: What happened to you?",
        "Cristian: Not to me. Antonio found John McBain in a motel room with Talia.",
        "Nora: Oh, uh -- that doesn't sound like John to me.",
        "Cristian: It does to me. I'll be right back with your shake.",

        "Cole: Yeah, just weights today.",
        "Nora: Oh. You know, when I'm upset, I could probably just eat everything on this menu obviously. You kind of lose your appetite, don't you?",
        "Cole: Just when things are really, really bad.",

        "Talia: You were married to Antonio and you screwed around on him. It's no wonder he never trusted what we had.",
        "Jessica: So you sleeping with John was my fault? Or was it Antonio's fault?",
        "Talia: I couldn't even smile at John without Antonio losing it.",
        "Jessica: Huh.",
        "Talia: And I realize he was under a lot of pressure. He had to work with Ramsey, he lost his inheritance -- I get it, but he didn't have to take it all out on me.",
        "Jessica: Okay -- Talia? You cheated on Antonio, okay? You did it.",
        "Talia: You know, it's so awesome. You know, if you had been this loyal to him when you were married to him, maybe he wouldn't have ever met me.",

        "Natalie: Yeah, I heard. And I know you, John, and don't you tell me that I'm wrong -- look at your face. I -- I know that it's only been a few months since Marty died, but do you need someone to talk to?",

        "Clint: You tell me.",
        "Bo: We are going to butt heads.",
        "Clint: What else is new?",
        "Bo: But I think our styles could complement each other. I just hope that you don't have to resort to anything like this again.",
        "Clint: I hope that, too. But I can't make any guarantees.",
        "Bo: Me, neither.",

        "Ramsey: Well, finding out your ex-husband and his brother, your new boyfriend, aren't exactly squeaky-clean after all?",
        "Nora: Are you starting this conversation just to annoy me or do you actually have business with the district attorney's office?",
        "Ramsey: Yeah -- no, not today. I just need your assurance that you will put your person feelings aside and be able to prosecute to the full extent of the law.",
        "Nora: I always do.",
        "Ramsey: Well, there might be a little conflict of interest this time around. You've been putting so much time in over there, you could be on the payroll. I understand you even went to the B.E. corporate retreat.",
        "Nora: I may not agree with the methods, but I have been assured that what happened over at B.E. was well within the confines of the law.",
        "Ramsey: And who gave you these assurances -- your new boyfriend, Clint?",
        "Nora: My onion rings are getting cold.",
        "Ramsey: Right.",

        "Starr: Langston, he said that he loves me and that he still wants to be with me and -- we're going to be together forever. I don't care what anybody says, my -- my mom, my dad, or Aunt Dorian. I'm not going to lose him.",
