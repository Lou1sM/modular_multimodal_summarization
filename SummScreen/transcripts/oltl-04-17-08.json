        "Starr is ready to take a bus to Atlantic City to have the abortion. And she has a plan to have Langston wearing a \"Starr wig\" so that everybody will think she is Starr. But there plan is not likely to work when both Marco and Cole see Langston at school dressed as Starr, know that Starr is gone and ask what is going on. Antonio is very suspicious of not only John but of Nash. He warns Cristian and Jessica both that Nash takes women from their men. Nash and Sara return from their trip to Napa and return to their respective partners. But they clearly look like they might be more than business associates. Natalie confronts Sara for going off with Nash. And it looks like she might be avoiding dealing with her feelings regarding Jared."

        "Nash: Now, I'm thinking as soon as we get back to Llanview, we should start planning a series of smaller wine tastings and events to celebrate the rollout of the label.",
        "Sarah: Nash --",
        "Nash: Sarah --",
        "Sarah: Huh -- I think you're forgetting something.",
        "Nash: What am I forgetting? A raise -- done.",
        "Sarah: Huh. Um -- we're on our way home. And once we get home, I have to go back to my full-time job -- and my boyfriend's the boss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hey, Blair.",
        "Blair: Hey. I just stopped off at Capricorn and picked up this schedule that Sarah did.",
        "Cristian: Yeah?",
        "Blair: Yeah -- she's nowhere to be found, and I need a decoder ring to figure this out.",
        "Cristian: Well, you knew she was out of town, right?",
        "Blair: Yeah, but I thought she'd be back by now. What'd she do, run off with Nash?",
        "Cristian: Hey, come on, Blair, Sarah wouldn't do that.",
        "Blair: That was a joke, Cristian. Man, I hit a nerve, huh?",
        "Cristian: Nope, I'm nerve-free.",
        "Blair: Are you worried?",
        "Cristian: I'm not jealous.",
        "Blair: \"Worried, worried,\" is what I was going to say, because look at your face -- it's what you look -- you look worried.",

        "Markko: Don't turn around.",
        "Cole: What, is it Starr?",

        "Markko: What? Dude, coach will kill you.",
        "Cole: Well, he better jump in line.",
        "Markko: Okay, this is crazy. You can't keep sitting here thinking about Starr and the mess with her psycho old man.",
        "Cole: Markko, there's -- there's something else wrong with Starr, it's written all over her face.",

        "Todd: So how is she?",
        "Shaun: She's upstairs.",
        "Todd: Well, I didn't ask you where she was, I asked you how she is.",
        "Shaun: She doesn't tell me how she is, all right?",
        "Todd: What about school? How's she doing in school?",
        "Shaun: I have to wait out in the parking lot. I don't know how she is, you know, when she's in school.",
        "Todd: When she leaves school, is she -- you know, is she with friends, is she laughing?",
        "Shaun: I can't remember the last time I heard your daughter laugh.",
        "Todd: But she's never with Cole, right?",
        "Shaun: No, not when I'm around. No. The only person she talks to is Langston. Those two always got their heads together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So you want me to be you?",
        "Starr: Langston, it's the only way I can get out of the house without Shaun noticing.",
        "Langston: And -- and what about your parents?",
        "Starr: They're out working -- they're not going to be home until late.",
        "Langston: So you want me to be you long enough for you to get out of the house, go all the way to Jersey --",
        "Starr: And get an abortion, yes.",
        "Langston: You can't do that by yourself.",
        "Starr: I'm going to have to because you have to stay and pretend to be me.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, even so, how are you going to get home after they do that to you?",
        "Starr: I guess I'm going to have to be okay.",
        "Langston: I -- I hate this.",
        "Starr: Well, I hate it, too.",

        "John: I have to go.",
        "Jared: Great idea, because I need Natalie to talk to me about Caracas.",

        "Natalie: No, wait. I need to talk to John.",

        "Natalie: Alone. I'll be done in three minutes, and then you can have all the Caracas numbers you want.",
        "Natalie: What the hell was that?",
        "John: Uncle Jared is really protective.",
        "Natalie: I mean you. You're so tight with Talia -- why did you almost kiss me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm just really sorry things didn't work out between you and Talia.",
        "Antonio: Seems like I don't have very good judgment when it comes to women.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, there's always going to be a part of me that will love you.",
        "Antonio: Ha. Like, this is what I mean right now.",
        "Jessica: And you deserve somebody special, somebody who's going to love --",
        "Antonio: I don't need a pep talk, not from you.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Okay. Okay, I guess you're right. It a little too early for me to weigh in about your personal life, huh?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, now that you have, maybe I -- maybe I can weigh in on yours.",
        "Jessica: Mine?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, John and Talia -- they started working together not too long ago, and then shortly after that they -- uh -- they were together.",
        "Jessica: What does that have to do with me?",
        "Antonio: I know that Nash has spent the last few days in Napa with my brother's girlfriend -- working.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Don't you think that you have more to offer the world than just booking bands for Capricorn?",
        "Sarah: I'm good at it, and I like it -- and I like working with Cristian.",
        "Nash: And that's enough?",
        "Sarah: Listen, big shot, you have a pretty cool winery and I really want it to succeed, but I do not think you can exactly afford to pay me any more than I'm making at my day job.",
        "Nash: Me and my winery are on the way up. Can you say the same thing about Capricorn?",
        "Sarah: With me booking the talent?",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sarah: Yes, I can.",
        "Nash: Fine. But still, you're working for somebody else. You could be working for yourself. You should start your own company, an events-planning company or something --",
        "[Sarah laughs]",
        "Nash: I think it could take off.",
        "Sarah: I threw a couple good parties, now I'm starting my own company?",
        "Nash: You could. I think you're a risk-taker.",
        "Sarah: Like you?",
        "Nash: Like me.",

        "Starr: It -- it's not my hair, but it's pretty close.",
        "Langston: Uh, yeah -- if your hair was synthetic.",
        "Starr: Okay, Langston, I am trying here, please. Okay, now, look, I have this outfit, and everybody knows that it's my favorite -- even the hat, right? I mean, this isn't all perfect, but it'll work.",
        "Langston: All right, well -- but we have to think about this.",
        "Starr: We don't have time to think, Langston. The clinic only has late hours every other Thursday, and I'll go crazy if I have to wait another two weeks.",
        "Langston: Okay, okay.",
        "Starr: Now, look, Shaun knows me in this outfit, and as long as you don't get too close, it should work.",
        "Langston: Okay, but Shaun's always outside the front gate. I mean, how are you going to get past him?",
        "Starr: I have another secret weapon. Now, wait here and try on the wig.",
        "Langston: Wait, what -- fine. This is crazy.",
        "Langston: This is your secret weapon -- Jack? We're screwed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Markko, Starr is not telling me everything.",
        "Markko: Dude, Starr's not telling you anything -- that's the deal. I mean, she's, like, a prisoner in her own home, she has a bodyguard, and her dad threatens to kill you every time he sees you. If she looks sad, that's why.",
        "Cole: I know Starr, there's something else.",
        "Markko: Shoot, she saw us, dude, she's coming right here. Let's go, let's go.",
        "Blair: Hey, guys.",
        "Markko: Hey, Mrs. Manning, hi.",
        "Blair: Hi. Hi, Cole. Markko, would you mind if I had a few words with Cole, please?",
        "Markko: Um -- sure.",
        "Cole: Is something wrong? Is Starr okay?",
        "Blair: How about I go first? You really want to go to prison?",
        "Cole: No, I do not want to go to prison.",
        "Blair: Could've fooled me.",
        "Cole: I went over to your house to see Mr. Manning, not Starr.",
        "Blair: And you thought this was going to work for you how?",
        "Cole: To ask Mr. Manning to lay off of Starr.",
        "Blair: Hmm. See, I heard that you told Todd that it was ruining his daughter's life.",
        "Cole: Well, he is.",
        "Blair: You getting up in Todd's face only made it worse for the two of you, not better.",
        "Cole: Do you know how miserable I am?",
        "Blair: Yes, Cole, I do, and I'm sorry. Listen to me. For the time being, do what Todd says, okay? Play by his rules. Maybe -- just maybe -- things will ease up a little bit. Otherwise, I can probably make a -- a definite promise to you -- you will not ever see Starr again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay, Jack, we want to play a little game with you.",
        "Jack: You never want to do anything with me.",
        "Starr: Well, now we do.",
        "Jack: I am not dressing up like a girl.",
        "Starr: No, no, no, you're not, I promise.",
        "Jack: I was on level six in my game, and I'm going back.",
        "Starr: Um -- sure, fine. Jack, you can go, but then I'm going to tell Dad who dented his car with their skateboard.",
        "Jack: That is not fair!",
        "Starr: Life isn't fair.",
        "Langston: Okay, you know, Starr, maybe the less people involved, the better.",
        "Starr: I know what I'm doing. Get back in here and shut the door. Okay. Now, Jack, when I tell you to, you are going to get your bat and your ball, and go to the back door, okay?",
        "Jack: This is a dumb game, Starr.",
        "Starr: No, no, no -- and then when I tell you to, you're going to get Shaun to go and help you find your ball.",
        "Jack: Oh! I get it. You're trying to sneak out to see Cole.",
        "Starr: Well, it's something like that.",
        "Jack: And we'll get in trouble if we get caught.",
        "Starr: Then don't get caught.",
        "Jack: You so owe me.",
        "Starr: I know I do, and now I'm going to go and get you when I'm ready, okay?",
        "Jack: Uh-huh.",
        "Starr: Thank you so much. Okay.",
        "Langston: The old \"lost your ball\" trick?",
        "Starr: Langston --",
        "Langston: What makes you think that Jack's not going to sing like a canary when he gets caught?",
        "Starr: Because he's a Manning and he knows how to lie. Please, we don't have that much time now. Could you go get me something of yours so that I can wear it? You're with me on this, right?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I'm with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Antonio, Nash and Sarah are not having an affair in Napa.",
        "Antonio: Okay. Last time I remember Nash being in Napa, he was -- he was with Tess, right? A pretty blond who likes to party, right? And -- and he's there now with Sarah -- another pretty blond who likes to party.",
        "Jessica: Okay, is this payback? Well, now I'm going to have to tell you something that you probably don't want to hear, but Nash and I -- we're really happy. We're really happy together, okay?",
        "[Antonio chuckles]",
        "Antonio: So were we.",
        "Jessica: Okay, well, I'm going to go because he's coming in today.",
        "Antonio: Okay.",
        "Jessica: I'm -- I'm sorry that -- that you felt like you needed to say those things to me.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I guess I don't blame you.",
        "Talia: We have to speak -- whether you want to or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What I did before was a mistake.",
        "Natalie: You almost kiss me, and that's all you can say?",
        "John: Okay, I should go.",
        "Natalie: John, come on! You -- you sleep with Talia in a motel room, you get caught by Antonio, you get into a fistfight. A day later, you show up at my office out of the blue and you come on to me?",
        "John: Like I said, I guess it was a mistake.",
        "Natalie: You suck at lying. What's with you?",
        "John: I'll explain someday. None of this is about you.",
        "Natalie: John --",
        "John: You look pretty.",
        "Natalie: Wait!",
        "Jared: What the hell was that about?",
        "Natalie: Well, whatever it was is none of your damn business.",
        "Jared: Okay, that creep was coming on to you five minutes after he was caught sleeping with another man's girl.",
        "Natalie: Again, your business why?",
        "Jared: You really want me to answer that?",
        "Natalie: I want you to not get involved in my personal life.",
        "Jared: He wanted to kiss you.",
        "Natalie: And so what if he did? You going to defend my honor, \"Uncle Jared\"?",
        "Jared: Stop calling me that.",
        "Natalie: I have work to do -- apparently. So why don't you go take a cold shower?",
        "Jared: Do you have any idea what it did to me to watch you with John McBain just now? Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I'm sorry for getting physical with you -- you know, for pushing you in front of --",
        "Antonio: No, no, no. Look, there's no need to apologize.",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Antonio: I had it coming. I shouldn't have said what I said, especially here in front of everyone. Look, from now on, we don't talk unless we have to, and -- and we don't have to talk about anything but work now.",
        "Talia: Okay. Um, but --",
        "Antonio: No buts. That's it.",
        "John: Are you okay? What did he say to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Oh, my God, I have, like, a million messages.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Sarah: Natalie -- not very happy with me. Natalie again. Natalie. Uh, I think I better get to B.E. before they disown me.",
        "Nash: Uh-huh.",
        "Sarah: Oh, nice -- my new boss, Blair, apparently doesn't like the way I make the schedule.",
        "Nash: Well, welcome home, huh?",
        "Sarah: Do you have a lot of messages?",
        "Nash: I'm meeting Jessica at the diner.",
        "Sarah: Cool.",
        "Nash: So I guess this is where we say our goodbyes. Goodbye.",
        "Sarah: You can't get rid of me that easily, Brennan. We're still going to work together in the future, I hope.",
        "Nash: I hope -- you did a great job, I owe you.",
        "Sarah: And I owe you for giving me a chance to work on the west coast.",
        "Nash: Well, I hope that if I ever have to work on the west coast again, you will allow me to ask you to help me again.",

        "Cristian: Thanks. You hear from Nash?",
        "Jessica: Yes -- their plane just landed.",

        "Blair: Yes and no.",
        "Cole: Okay, I love Starr. How is that wrong?",
        "Blair: It's not wrong, Cole. I know you love her. But we're her parents and we love her, too, and I don't agree with Todd's methods -- but you and Starr came so close to going way too far, and you're too young.",
        "Cole: We didn't think we were ever going to see each other again.",
        "Blair: You can justify this any way you want to, but let me tell you this -- Todd does not care. If you don't listen to what he says, he will make sure that you go to prison. You hear me? If you don't play by his rules, you're still not going to see Starr.",

        "Starr: Well, you'll be there for me when it's all over. Now, Langston, you're the only person in the world that knows that I'm pregnant and that I'm about to not be. Anyway -- um -- here. You're going to take my car, you're going to drive to school, and then you're going to go in there. Shaun will probably follow you, and he'll wait outside for you, but I told him that I had drama club tonight, so --",
        "Langston: Yeah, I'll just go to the library, it'll probably be empty.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and, um, Cole and Markko don't have any practice, so they shouldn't be there.",

        "Starr: You know what? I -- I already wrote down the address and the phone number just in case.",
        "Langston: Oh, wow, you thought of everything.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I had to. Langston, I'll never forget that you did this for me. Yeah, when -- when you hear Jack yell for Shaun, then you just run out the front door, okay?",
