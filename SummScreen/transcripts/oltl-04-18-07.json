        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "Blair: This is it. Hurry, Todd!",
        "Michael: Come on, Rex, call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I finally got Tommy down for the count.",
        "Michael: Good. Good.",
        "Marcie: Who you calling?",
        "Michael: Calling?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: A patient. I was -- I was checking on a patient.",
        "Marcie: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm sorry it's so late. I was driving by on my way home, I saw the light on -- I lost a little notebook tonight --",
        "Marty: Oh, yeah, no, I -- I found it. It must've fallen out of your pocket.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Marty: Yeah, come on in.",
        "John: That's good -- I thought maybe I lost it on the way to Rodi's. You know, between the -- the drinking and the darts, I -- I wasn't paying much attention.",
        "Marty: Here.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I didn't read it -- you know, secrets are safe.",
        "John: No secrets, just case notes and bad handwriting. Thanks again.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cole: Hey, John, wait. Why don't you stay and toast my dad with us?",
        "Dorian: You know, after everything that happened in the hearing room today, I really think it's a great idea that we're going to look for Jessica.",
        "Viki: Are you that worried about her, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Hmm, absolutely.",
        "Viki: Really? Well, in that case, don't you think it would've made a lot more sense to take your own car and go looking for her? Because that way, we could've covered twice as much ground.",
        "Dorian: But I have no idea where to look for her.",
        "Viki: No, of course you don't, because you are not her mother.",
        "Dorian: Duh -- tell me something I don't know, Viki.",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint --",
        "Dorian: I'm not her mother.",
        "Viki: I think I know where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Here we go, here we go -- push, push, push, push, push -- home sweet home, kiddo. Huh? What do you think? We could start getting used to it. Yes, we can, because you, me, and your mommy are going to live here forever -- starting now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You sure you want to bear your soul to me right now? Me first. You in an accident? Were you hurt?",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Antonio: Did you lose your cell phone? Your memory? Did you forget where you lived?",
        "Jessica: Of course not.",
        "Antonio: Then why didn't you call?",
        "Jessica: I screwed up, and I'm sorry.",
        "Antonio: That's not good enough.",
        "Jessica: How's Jamie?",
        "Antonio: She's at my mother's -- I don't want her to overhear us.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, I know that you're really angry --",
        "Antonio: You think this is angry?",
        "Jessica: Antonio --",
        "Antonio: Do you have any idea what you did to Jamie? She finally started calling you \"Mommy,\" and then you tell everybody that you don't want her to be your daughter -- while she sat there!",
        "Jessica: That's not what I meant to happen at all.",
        "Antonio: Do we speak the same language, you and I? Because what does \"I don't want to adopt Jamie\" mean in yours?",
        "Jessica: Don't do this, ok? Can we just talk about this --",
        "Antonio: She's 5, Jessica! 5! You ran out of that hearing room, and you left my daughter upset and confused, and you want me to be calm?",
        "Jessica: I know, I know. That's not what I -- I --",
        "Antonio: What -- \"how I handle it\"? Do you even know me? Because I sure as hell don't know you. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: It is way past your bedtime, isn't it? I know -- it's ok. I think your mommy will understand, because today is a special day. Yeah, it is. You know, I almost left you today. I did. But somebody was looking out for us. Somebody wants us to be together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: What makes you think Jessica is with Nash?",
        "Viki: I -- I think that her behavior at the hearing today had a lot to do with him.",
        "Dorian: Is there something going on between the two of them?",
        "Viki: I don't know. But I know that she's extremely confused about something, and my best guess is that it's Nash.",
        "Clint: Yeah, here I thought it was all one-sided.",
        "Viki: What are you talking about?",
        "Clint: Nash -- he's got feelings for Jessica.",
        "Viki: Yes, I know that, but has he talked to you about it?",
        "Clint: Yeah, he has. The man's honest to a fault, and he told me that he's fallen in love with Jessie.",
        "Dorian: And does she reciprocate his feelings?",
        "Clint: I don't know. Viki, has she confided in you?",
        "Viki: She's very worried about Tess' influence and Tess' feelings.",
        "Clint: Well, you know, if you think Jessica's at Nash's, I can get there in 10 or 15 minutes.",
        "Viki: Well, go, go.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Dorian: Maybe we should call first.",
        "Clint: Why? Would it be awkward not to call?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. I mean -- Jessica was so very upset at the hearing, and if Viki's right and she's gone to cry in Nash's arms, then, yeah, sure. Maybe it -- it would be a bit awkward if we --",
        "Viki: Well, obviously, we're going to knock first.",
        "Clint: You know, I'm afraid that if we do call, that Nash is going to lie to protect Jessie.",
        "Viki: Or himself.",
        "Clint: Viki, we are not talking about a kidnapping here, you know -- Jessie left the court of her own free will. If she's with Nash, it's because she wants to be with Nash.",
        "Viki: But that's assuming she's rational, Clint. And what she did at the hearing today -- what she did to little Jamie, to hurt her like that -- that was awful! And I personally don't think she's capable of doing anything like that unless she's under some sort of enormous pressure.",
        "Dorian: That's true. You know, sometimes excessive emotion can lead people to do things with -- without any reason whatsoever, especially if they are highly passionate people. Of course, it's been so long for you, Viki, you probably don't remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: That rather dense-looking loaf on the table wouldn't happen to be soda bread, would it?",
        "Cole: Yeah, my mom made it.",
        "John: Ah.",
        "Marty: Eat at your own risk.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Cole: She's a little insecure about her cooking.",
        "Marty: Uh, yes, Cole, thank you for that. I -- I appreciate it. Let me take your coat -- I'm sure it's still wet -- I'll hang it back up.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "Marty: Ok?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "John: Hard as a rock. So, is there any other Thornhart birthday traditions I need to know about?",
        "Cole: Well, we sing and, um, read poems. I guess it's kind of weird, huh?",
        "John: Not unless you end up wearing a skirt.",
        "Cole: Huh.",
        "John: Any poems in particular?",
        "Marty: Actually, just one -- well, it was more a prayer than a poem.",
        "Cole: Yeah, my dad said it was an Irish blessing.",
        "John: Oh. Did it go something like \"may the road rise up to meet you, may the wind be always at your back, may the sun shine warmly on your face, the rain fall softly on your fields, and until we meet again, may god hold you in the palm of his hand\"?",
        "Marty: Yeah, that was Patrick's favorite. How did you --",
        "John: It was my dad's favorite, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Is he ok?",
        "Michael: Who?",
        "Marcie: Your patient?",
        "Michael: You know, I -- I didn't get a chance to find out. Um -- so you got Tommy to sleep, huh?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, poor kid. I hate when he cries like that, it just hurts my heart.",
        "Michael: Yeah. He's probably having a nightmare.",
        "Marcie: About what? That kid has it made. He has the perfect life, just like we do. Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I thought you said that you were good at this.",
        "Todd: Turn the light on it.",
        "Blair: All right. You know, if we don't get this open really soon, we're out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I promise you, Marcie, I'm going to make sure that you and Tommy never have another nightmare.",
        "Marcie: That's easier said than done.",
        "Michael: You want me to go check on him?",
        "Marcie: No. It's fine. You worry about your patient, I'll worry about our son.",
        "Blair: Todd, what if the cleaning crew comes?",
        "[Noise]",
        "Todd: What was that?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Michael: Come on, Rex, pick up.",
        "Blair: You want me to check? Nothing. Todd, what if the attorney didn't bring your son to this adoption agency?",
        "Todd: Then we check out adoption lawyers.",
        "Blair: That could take months.",
        "Todd: Then go home.",
        "Blair: You know what? You're Jack and Starr's father. Now, they need you.",
        "Todd: I got it, I got it, I got it.",
        "Blair: Ok. Ok. Rex: Damn. It's me.",
        "Michael: Rex, where are you?",
        "Rex: And don't call my cell again. You almost busted me.",
        "Michael: Did you find Blair and Todd?",
        "Rex: They just broke into an adoption office.",
        "Michael: What do they know about Tommy?",
        "Rex: Nothing yet. But if his papers are filed in that office, it's only a matter of time.",
        "Michael: Oh, no.",
        "Marcie: Michael, what's wrong?",
        "Marty: Well, first, we start with his favorite wine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: White wine? You sure he was Irish?",
        "[Marty chuckles]",
        "Cole: Then, we make a toast. To dad.",
        "Marty: To Patrick.",
        "John: Patrick.",
        "Cole: You know, when my dad was alive, we would do this for all of our birthdays.",
        "Marty: Yes. You liked it especially, because you got to stay up past midnight.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Yeah, dad thought it was really important for family to be the first ones to wish you a happy birthday.",
        "John: Yeah, well, sounds like a good family tradition.",
        "Marty: Yes, Patrick was big on traditions.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Cole: Yeah. He even said that -- that traditions start at the same time as the Irish.",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Yeah, he had so many stories and poems.",
        "Marty: Yes, and the minute you turned 13, you were always embarrassed to hear them.",
        "Cole: Mom --",
        "Marty: I'm sorry.",
        "John: Well, if it's any consolation, I know the feeling.",
        "Cole: Seriously?",
        "John: Oh, yeah. My old man -- he'd start telling these stories, you know, and the minute he did, mike and I would just pretend to pass out. I mean, just full-blown snoring.",
        "Marty: Sound familiar?",
        "Cole: Did he get mad?",
        "John: No, no. He just went right on talking, you know? Nothing could stop him.",
        "Cole: Yeah, that's exactly what my dad did. He never got mad. He said that one day, I would appreciate them. I just wish I hadn't been such a jerk to him now.",
        "Marty: Oh, sweetie, you weren't.",
        "John: You know, Cole, when you're young, it's hard to appreciate your dad. Especially when he's dragging you by the ear into Sunday mass.",
        "Cole: So you're catholic?",
        "John: Yeah, it's been a while. But yeah. You?",
        "Cole: Yeah, my dad was.",
        "John: Hey, you know that -- that part of mass when they -- they ask you to show a sign of peace? You know that part? I remember my dad, instead of shaking hands, he would -- he would kiss mike and me on the cheek.",
        "Cole: In front of everyone?",
        "John: Everyone, you know, right -- it was very embarrassing for a 10-year-old. And then I remember one Sunday, I just said \"forget about it. That's it, no more kissing, no more man-kissing.\"",
        "Cole: What did he -- what did he do?",
        "John: He shook my hand.",
        "Cole: Just for that day, or --",
        "John: For the rest of his days.",
        "Marty: You miss those kisses?",
        "John: I miss him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's still me, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Then you kept this part well-hidden. Or do you blame Tess?",
        "Jessica: No, she has nothing to do with this.",
        "Antonio: She would never be this cruel.",
        "Jessica: I got scared, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: When did you stop loving Jamie?",
        "Jessica: Never. I never --",
        "Antonio: But you rejected her.",
        "Jessica: That's not what I wanted.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, that's the way she sees it. She thinks you don't want her! And you don't!",
        "Jessica: No. Something happened and --",
        "Antonio: Yeah, and you couldn't talk to me about it?",
        "Jessica: No! Everything just came at me at once, and I couldn't think!",
        "Antonio: No, don't you use your emotional problems as an excuse for bad behavior!",
        "Jessica: Ok -- adoption is a really big responsibility, and I just didn't want to make a mistake.",
        "Antonio: How is adopting my daughter a mistake?",
        "Jessica: She deserves better than me.",
        "Antonio: So, what, this is -- this is about your low self-esteem?",
        "Jessica: No, it's about doing the right thing!",
        "Antonio: Yeah? And what is that, Jess? What is that? Because right now, it's about keeping you as far away from my daughter as possible!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You better hope nobody shows up. I'm not bailing your ass out of jail.",
        "Blair: You'll be locked up right with me.",
        "Todd: Well, I'm a fast runner.",
        "Blair: I am not taking the fall alone.",
        "Todd: Well, I'm not going down.",
        "Blair: You would desert me, wouldn't you? What would you tell our kids?",
        "Todd: \"Yeah, sorry. Mommy had to go to jail because\" you wouldn't shut up.",
        "Blair: Oh. If you told me that I'd be looking for Margaret's kid right now --",
        "Todd: Forget Margaret. Forget Spencer. We're talking about finding my kid -- my kid, if he's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey, little squeaky boy, huh? You've gotten a new tooth, big guy?",
        "Marcie: Oh, well, I put that teething salve on his gums. Hopefully, it'll work.",
        "Michael: Yeah? You want to give him to me?",
        "Marcie: No, I thought you had to go to work.",
        "Michael: For what?",
        "Marcie: Your patient. I mean, it sounded like he was in trouble.",
        "Michael: Well, you know, he -- he is -- he is getting worse, but the attending is taking care of him, so I -- I'm pretty much covered.",
        "Marcie: You're lying. Michael, you're lying to me. Again. You know --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thanks for inviting me. You know, I don't get to do a lot of stuff like this, and it was a nice change.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it was cool hearing about your dad. Kind of sounds like mine.",
        "John: Well, then we're both lucky. Well, I should get going. I got to work in the morning. Actually, in a few hours.",
        "Cole: Yeah -- I just wish you hadn't have told my mom about the guy beating the hell out of me at Rourke's.",
        "John: Yeah, it kind of slipped out, but you know moms -- they have radar for that kind of thing.",
        "[Phone beeps]",
        "Cole: Hmm, don't I know it.",
        "John: All right, well, look, I'll -- I'll see you around.",
        "Cole: All right.",
        "John: Good night.",
        "Marty: Good night, John.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Cole: Drinking? Dart-playing? That's not what you told me.",
        "Marty: That was after we talked, when my car wouldn't start.",
        "Cole: Mom, were you on a date with detective McBain?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nash: Mommy's here. Ok. Ok. All right.",
        "Viki: Were you expecting someone else, Nash?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You don't want me to see Jamie anymore?",
        "Antonio: I think it's best you maintain a little distance.",
        "Jessica: But I -- I love her. I love her.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, you have a funny way of showing it.",
        "Jessica: Antonio -- please, I -- I really want her to be in my life, no matter what -- what happens.",
        "Antonio: No matter what?",
        "Jessica: Antonio --",
        "Antonio: What does that -- what, did you refuse to adopt her because you don't want to be married to me anymore? Because if that's true, then this discussion is over.",
        "Jessica: Antonio --",
        "Antonio: What, Jess? What is it? Or is it \"who\"?",
        "Jessica: Why do you say \"who\"?",
        "Antonio: Because you turned your back on our family. Did one of us scare you so much that you had to run away?",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Antonio: Then what, Jess?",
        "Jessica: It's complicated.",
        "Antonio: Then start talking.",
        "Jessica: After I left, I just -- I just drove around and hated myself. All I could do was picture her little face in my head, how devastated she was.",
        "Antonio: Your point?",
        "Jessica: I was selfish!",
        "Antonio: Yes. Yes, you were. You think that's going to make my daughter feel better?",
        "Jessica: If I could just talk to her --",
        "Antonio: Forget it. Do you love Jamie as much as you love Bree?",
        "Jessica: That's a terrible question.",
        "Antonio: But a fair one, considering your behavior.",
        "Jessica: Yes, of course I do! I love them both equally.",
        "Antonio: And you think what you did is called love?",
        "Jessica: No! Well -- I -- adopting a child is a really big responsibility.",
        "Antonio: Because if you do love her as much as you say you do --",
        "Jessica: Just let me explain.",
        "Antonio: Will it help me understand what you did! That's not good enough!",
        "Jessica: Antonio, I can only tell you the truth! I can only tell you how I felt today standing in front of that judge! And then after, I --",
        "Antonio: After what?",
        "Jessica: After, I just -- I just drove around, and the whole thing, I just replayed it around and around in my head, and then -- something changed.",

        "Nash: Adoption hearing?",
        "Clint: Jessica was supposed to adopt Antonio's daughter today, but when the moment came, she couldn't do it. She ran out and nobody has seen her since.",
        "Nash: Well, she's not here. Oh, go ahead -- search the place.",
        "Viki: Did you have anything to do with Jessica's decision?",
        "Nash: I don't know. I wasn't there.",
        "Clint: Nash, you asked me to help convince Jessica that this adoption was a mistake.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: Really?",
        "Nash: Yeah, but you said that you wouldn't, and Jessica asked me to step aside, so I did.",
        "Viki: Why did you bring it up in the first place?",
        "Nash: That's between me and Jessica, isn't it?",
        "Clint: Not anymore, now that's she's gone. Nash, she's out there and she could be in trouble.",
        "Nash: I know that Jessica loves Jamie very much. It's just that adoption -- it's so very permanent, isn't it?",
        "Dorian: More so than marriage, apparently.",

        "Marty: Well, it sounds like it.",
        "Cole: Listen, you know, even if you did want to date, it's cool. One of us should have a social life.",

        "Todd: Spencer's dead. He doesn't know whether he's jerking my chain or not.",

He didn't care whether he was dead or alive -- all he cared about was knowing that it was making you crazy, and indeed, what if this does turn out to be some kind of wild-goose chase?
