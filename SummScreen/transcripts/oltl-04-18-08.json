        "Dorian: If you insist on going to Niles, Michigan, unfortunately you have to fly into Fort Wayne, Indiana, and then drive the rest of the way.",
        "Layla: I don't know why you have to do this. Gigi's ex is dead -- what's the point of digging him up?",
        "Adriana: I told you --",
        "Layla: Gigi keeps saying this Brody Lovett is her son's father, not Rex.",
        "Adriana: And everything Gigi says is a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You need me to do something?",
        "Jared: Oh, Gigi -- um, Clint needs this delivered to Rex Balsom right away.",
        "Gigi: I'll call for a messenger.",
        "Jared: Oh, no, there's a lot of sensitive stuff in there. He wants you to do it personally.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Oh, thanks for making time for me. Can I get another cup of coffee? It's been crazy at B.E., huh?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you don't know how crazy.",
        "Jared's voice: Do you really want to go back to John? Or did you let him get that close to prove to yourself that maybe, just maybe there's someone else waiting for you in the future?",
        "Natalie: So, what's up?",
        "Rex: Thanks. Talk Roxy out of the dove dedication at my wedding.",
        "Natalie: Oh, but it's so romantic with all the doves going up at the same time.",
        "Rex: Not if the doves just had Mexican food right before the ceremony.",
        "Natalie: Well, you're really going to hurt Roxy's feelings.",
        "Rex: Sorry, but I don't want Adriana to even hear about it. She's freaking out enough about this wedding.",
        "Natalie: Problems?",
        "Rex: I'm sure it's just stress -- flying back and forth to Paris, trying to plan the wedding and the marriage. I just -- I just feel like -- like I don't know Adriana anymore.",
        "Natalie: Kind of a bad time for this to happen, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Langston, what's going on?",
        "Langston: I already told you --",
        "Cole: Yeah, you told me that you and Starr are messing around pretending to be each other? But you don't look like you're messing around -- you look scared. Something bad has happened.",
        "Langston: No, really. Nothing bad has happened, okay?",
        "Cole: Okay, you know what? If you don't tell me, I'm just going to go find out for myself.",
        "Langston: No -- Cole, don't.",
        "Cole: Okay, then tell me what's going on?",
        "Langston: I can't! I can't, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Receptionist: Can I help you?",
        "Starr: Um -- yeah, hi. My name is Starr Manning and I have an appointment. I'm here to have an abortion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: That's pretty harsh -- calling Gigi an out-and-out liar?",
        "Dorian: And there is a difference between covering something up and an out- and-out lie.",
        "Adriana: Huh -- if anyone would know. Look, I'm not going to let Gigi spring any surprises on Rex and me before the wedding.",
        "Dorian: Darling, what makes you so sure she will?",
        "Adriana: I've walked in on her and Rex two different times and both times, she looked like she was working up to tell Rex something heavy.",
        "Dorian: But that doesn't mean that she was going to tell him that her son is Rex's.",
        "Adriana: What else could it be? I'm not going to take any chances on her sabotaging my wedding.",
        "Dorian: Honey, even if it turns out that Gigi's son is Rex's child, are you so insecure that you're afraid you're going to lose him because of it?",
        "Adriana: It's not about me. It's about Gigi taking advantage of Rex.",
        "Layla: Okay, so if you're right and that's what Gigi was going to tell Rex, why hasn't she gone ahead and done it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Can't Rex just come pick this stuff up?",
        "Jared: Well, we need you to work with Rex, you know, in case he has any questions. If he comes around here too often, the wrong people might be tipped off.",
        "Gigi: What about Phyllis? She has way more experience with the company than I do.",
        "Jared: You really don't want to do this, do you?",
        "Gigi: I just -- I need to get home to my son.",
        "Shane: Mom, guess what. Mrs. Davidson and Charlie are taking me to the Phillies' game tonight!",
        "Viki: Uh -- no, no, we came to ask your permission to see if he could go.",
        "Charlie: Shane -- when we picked Shane up at school, he showed us the A that he got on his comic book.",
        "Gigi: You did, you got an A?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and I figure something like that deserves a little reward.",
        "Shane: So can I go?",
        "Gigi: Huh. How can I say no? Here, let me see what the teacher said. \"Excellent artwork, exciting story, original characters.\" Great job. All right!",
        "Viki: Shane said that the main character is based on his father.",
        "Jared: That's really cool, Shane -- to think your father's a hero.",
        "Shane: He was a hero. That's how he died, and he always will be a hero to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm sure the old Adriana will be back after the wedding.",
        "Natalie: Okay, and is this new Adriana that bad? Rex?",
        "Rex: It's nothing.",
        "Natalie: Okay, what did she do?",
        "Rex: Oh. I wanted her to ask Marcie to be a bridesmaid and she refused.",
        "Natalie: Okay, you're kidding -- wow.",
        "Rex: She said that she didn't want to put any pressure on Marcie because she didn't want her being up there in front of all those people, you know, after everything that happened with Tommy.",
        "Natalie: Right. No -- okay, that makes sense.",
        "Rex: Except when I brought it up to Marcie, she seemed pretty stoked about it.",
        "Natalie: That's not good. I mean, did you tell Adriana that?",
        "Rex: Yeah! She just shot it down. I'm sure she knows how Marcie would feel better than I do -- or thinks she does. I mean, Dorian --",
        "Natalie: Whoa, whoa. Adriana could be turning into her mother now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Langston, what is going on?",
        "Langston: Oh. I dressed up as Starr so that Shaun would follow me and not her.",
        "Cole: Why?",
        "Langston: Because she's sick of him.",
        "Cole: Yeah -- how long do you think it's going to be before Shaun figures out what's going on here? Starr's dad is going to go psycho again -- or has that already happened?",
        "Langston: No! Just drop it, okay?",
        "Cole: Langston, I could tell Starr was upset when she took off today. Something bad has happened.",
        "Langston: No, really, nothing bad has happened.",
        "Cole: Oh, my God. It all makes sense. I know what's going on with Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Receptionist: Sign in, then fill out these forms.",
        "Starr: Okay. Oh. Oh, my gosh -- I'm sorry.",
        "Woman: It's okay. Did those demonstrators outside scare you?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Woman: If you're sure about your decision, that's all that matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Come on, I'll show you how to make copies of your comic book on the color copier.",
        "Viki: Ooh! Well said.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'll meet you back here, okay?",
        "Viki: Oh, okay.",
        "Charlie: So, you -- you working in Natalie's office a lot now?",
        "Jared: Yeah, well, they're remodeling mine.",
        "Charlie: How's that going? I mean, working with Natalie now that she knows what you did?",
        "Jared: I'm getting this isn't just fatherly concern, so make your point. Ahem.",
        "Charlie: Come on, I saw the way you two looked at each other on Valentine's Day and that was before she knew that you weren't her uncle, so unless she's made a complete 180\u2011degree turn, I'm just saying that you better be careful.",
        "Jared: Why? Because I might get what I wished for that night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You really think that Adriana could be turning into Dorian? Rex?",
        "Rex: I'm probably just overreacting. I've got a lot of stuff going on, too.",
        "Natalie: Like what?",
        "Rex: Gigi.",
        "Natalie: Something happened with Gigi?",
        "Rex: No -- Gigi happened. Adriana's not exactly cool about it.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Well, Rex, how do you expect her to feel? You know, your hot high school honey shows up in town out of the blue -- single, available, right before the wedding.",
        "Rex: Gigi and I are friends, that's all.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Did you make that crystal clear with Adriana? Rex?",
        "Rex: You think she'll be upset that I invited her to the wedding?",
        "Natalie: You did not.",
        "Rex: And her son?",
        "Natalie: Rex, why would you do that?",
        "Rex: I would like at least a few people on my side on the church.",
        "Natalie: Okay, that's reserved for friends, family -- not ex-lovers.",
        "Rex: Are you staying away from any of yours?",
        "Natalie: That's different. Anyway, you're right -- I mean, Adriana's probably under a lot of stress. She couldn't be turning into Dorian. Or could she? I got to go. Ahem.",
        "Rex: Okay. Bye.",
        "Natalie: Bye.",
        "Rex: See ya.",
        "Rex: Oh, boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Look, I'm not saying that Rex definitely is Shane's father.",
        "Dorian: Then what is it that Gigi is lying about?",
        "Adriana: Well, that's what we have to find out.",
        "Layla: I'm still not getting this.",
        "Dorian: Of course -- she could always say that Shane is Rex's son even if he isn't.",
        "Adriana: Exactly.",
        "Layla: But she hasn't. She keeps saying Rex is not Shane's father.",
        "Adriana: And when she says it, she sounds like she's hiding something.",
        "Dorian: You know, maybe her real problem is that she's fabricated this story about another man, she's made him a war hero, and she has her son not only believing it but cherishing it.",
        "Adriana: And now, she knows that Rex is going to be off the market soon, that he loves me and he's marrying me.",
        "Dorian: Hmm -- but if she tries something, she risks alienating not only Rex with the truth but her son, as well.",
        "Adriana: And she ends up losing both.",
        "Layla: Wow. I'm not going to even try to figure that out, just as long as you two understand each other.",
        "Dorian: Perfectly -- the acorn does not fall --",
        "Adriana: Look, we just need to get to the bottom of this.",
        "Layla: And how are we going to do that? Show up at this Brody Lovett's house and ask them if their dead son is Gigi Morasco's son's father?",
        "Adriana: No. We tell them the truth -- we're Gigi's friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How could you possibly know?",
        "Cole: Langston, it doesn't take a genius. You know, she's been upset for a while, you've been saying that she hasn't been feeling that great. I -- I just wish I would've known. I would've gone with her.",
        "Langston: She wanted to do it by herself.",
        "Cole: Why? If I would've ran away with her, then at least we could -- we could be together.",
        "Langston: You think she ran away?",
        "Cole: Yeah -- yeah, didn't she? Well, if she didn't run away, then -- then what is it? Langston, please tell me what's going on. Please let me help Starr.",
        "Markko: Langston, just tell us. You know you want to.",
        "Langston: Oh, she's going to kill me.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Langston: Here -- that's where Starr is.",
        "Cole: Atlantic City? Why did she go there?",
        "Langston: Just get there, fast, okay? Go! Oh. I hope Starr doesn't kill me for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: No, I have to do this. I don't have another choice.",
        "Woman: I know what that's like.",
        "Nurse: Sheila?",
        "Sheila: I'm ready. You'll be okay.",
        "Nurse: Wait here. We'll start your prep in a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Jared, do you really think that you and Natalie have a future once this whole mess comes out in the open?",
        "Jared: Well, aren't you hoping to have one with Viki?",
        "Charlie: Yes, but I admit that once she finds out that I've been lying to her and that I helped you scam the Buchanans, it might be over.",
        "Jared: Look, I wasn't trying to scam the Buchanans, not -- not really. I wanted to be one of them.",
        "Charlie: Well, I don't think they're going to see it that way.",
        "Jared: Well, I don't care as long as Natalie does.",
        "Charlie: Even if it means you go -- go back to prison?",
        "Jared: Won't be forever, and then Natalie and I can start fresh.",
        "Charlie: And do you think that's really what she wants?",
        "Jared: Well, it's worth trying.",
        "Viki: Well, we'd probably better go because we still have to meet with Roxy and we want to get to the stadium in time for the first pitch.",
        "Gigi: Have a good time tonight and limit -- one hotdog only.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Gigi: Ah, yes -- one, and no beer.",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "Gigi: And not too many peanuts.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Gigi: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Viki: See you later, bye.",
        "Charlie: Come on.",
        "Gigi: Bye. So I guess I'm going to go get this stuff over to Rex's now.",
        "Jared: Cool, thank you.",
        "Gigi: Hey, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "Natalie: You're still here?",
        "Jared: You didn't think you were going to get rid of me that easily, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Look, I -- I will be out of here in a minute. I just want to download some stuff.",
        "Natalie: Couldn't download some stuff before they turned off your electricity?",
        "Jared: Well, sure, but then I wouldn't be here to see your beautiful smile.",
        "Natalie: You are so full of it. You know what? You better be careful, Uncky -- what you say around here when you're talking to your niece.",
        "Jared: I can be as discreet as you are.",
        "Natalie: I don't want to be discreet, or anything else with you.",
        "Jared: You are keeping my secret for me",
        "Natalie: Ahem -- I'm not keeping it for you. I'm doing it to --",
        "Jared: Protect the family -- yes, I know, but you're covering for a con man and you're keeping me out of jail. So, are you really just doing it to protect the family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Okay, so we're going to tell this Brody Lovett's family that we're friends of the girl you just called a liar?",
        "Adriana: Why not? They're not going to know the difference. Just follow my lead.",
        "Layla: I just hope it's not off a cliff.",
        "Adriana: Trust me, okay? I know how to get things out of people. Like mother, like daughter. Hi, honey!",
        "Rex: Oh, hi. I was just hoping all the wedding planning would be over -- that I'm not really, really interested in.",
        "Adriana: It is over and I'm all yours.",
        "Dorian: And I'm on my way to meet your lovely mother. Oh, she never runs out of creative ideas.",
        "Rex: Okay, if she says anything about birds, nix it right away.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Don't worry about that. Bye-bye, darling.",
        "Adriana: Bye.",
        "Dorian: Layla?",
        "Adriana: Hmm?",
        "Dorian: Good luck.",
        "Rex: Good luck with what?",
        "Adriana: Layla and I are going on a business trip.",
        "Rex: Oh. When?",
        "Adriana: Tonight.",
        "Rex: I thought you said you were all mine.",
        "Adriana: I'm not going to be gone long.",
        "Rex: You just came back from Paris!",
        "Adriana: I -- I know, but it's a major new buyer, Rex, and I just want to get it nailed down before the wedding. I wouldn't do it if it wasn't really important for our future.",
        "Rex: Us? I thought you said it was business.",
        "Adriana: Well, what's good for business is good for us, right? Hey, where were you?",
        "Rex: With Nattie.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Rex: Oh, she said to tell you props on the bridesmaids' dresses.",
        "Adriana: I'm so happy that Natalie's going to be part of the bridal party. I got to get a few more things packed. Be right back.",
        "Rex: Is my wedding turning into some kind of business promotion?",
        "Layla: Sorry. This won't happen again.",
        "Rex: Well, I hope not because this is our wedding, not a P.R. event for Exposed.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rex: Morasco. What are you doing here?",
        "Gigi: Clint and Jared wanted me to bring this stuff over to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, Roxy and Dorian aren't even here yet.",
        "Shane: Are we going to be late for the game?",
        "Charlie: Look, I promise you that all this wedding talk will be wrapped up by the time you've finished eating the burger that you're going to order with this money that I'm giving you right now, okay?",
        "Shane: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Viki: I don't think that Dorian's going to be too pleased to s me here.",
        "Charlie: Do I look like I care?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Viki: You and Jared were having a little chat when I went to copy room. What did you two talk about?",
        "Charlie: Basically about what a lucky guy I am.",
        "Viki: You know that I really didn't like Jared at all when I first met him -- I mean, really not at all. But I think I misjudged him. I -- I think he's okay and he comes from good stock.",
        "Charlie: What do you mean?",
        "Viki: Well, he's a Buchanan. And they have their detractors, but I think basically they are pretty decent at heart, at least his sons are. And he seems to be a Buchanan through and through. What's wrong?",
        "Charlie: What? Nothing, nothing, nothing.",
        "Viki: Hmm. You know, the last time we were here, I thought that you were proposing to me. I am still mortified.",
        "Charlie: Well, don't be, because you just seem to have a gift for knowing what's going on in my heart.",
        "Dorian: Oh, my goodness. Viki, what a pleasant surprise.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: I had no idea you'd be joining us -- again.",
        "Viki: Okay, if you want me to leave --",
        "Charlie: No, I'd like you to stay.",
        "Dorian: Yes, please. I'm sure you have some marvelous suggestions for my daughter's wedding.",
        "Viki: Hmm, I'm not going to say a word, no -- except one. I -- I had a thought. I think it would be fun if the mother of the bride parachuted into the wedding.",
        "Roxy: Far out. I didn't know you were into sky-diving, Dorian. All right, sit, everybody. Come on! We got to get this show on the road! Come on, sit down!",
        "Shane: Charlie, I ordered a burger. You want anything?",
        "Charlie: No, I'm going to wait till we get to the game.",
        "Viki: Dorian, I don't believe you've met Shane Morasco. This is Gigi's son. This is Dr. Dorian Lord.",
        "Dorian: Nice to meet you, young man.",
        "Shane: Hi. We're sitting at Mrs. Davidson's suite for the Phillies' game tonight.",
        "Roxy: Hey, Vik -- what about those luxury suites? I hear that they're stocked with all the hooch that you can mooch. Yeah, I say we have the wedding at a Phillies' game, huh? What do you think?",
        "Dorian: Roxy --",
        "Roxy: Oh, you know, Rex is just crazy about baseball.",
        "Shane: That would be so cool!",
        "Dorian: Wait, wait -- we have been all through this.",
        "Roxy: So where are we going with this shindig?",
        "Dorian: I just talked to Renee and we can have the wedding and the reception at The Palace.",
        "Shane: Is it fancy there? Because my mom's wondering what to wear.",
        "Dorian: Your mother is coming to the wedding?",
        "Shane: I am, too. Rex invited both of us.",
        "Dorian: He did? Hmm. How nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: All right. I told Shaun Starr was still with the drama club, but he saw a whole bunch of kids leaving. I mean, he's going to find out pretty soon.",
        "Langston: How am I supposed to get out of here without him realizing I'm not Starr?",
        "Markko: Well -- well, even if he does, I mean, Cole's got a big head start on him.",
        "Langston: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this.",
        "Markko: Well, it's -- Starr's like your sister. She told you to keep quiet - I get that.",
        "Langston: She shouldn't be alone right now. I'm glad I told Cole where she is -- even if she hates me.",
        "Markko: All right. I'm going to go back outside, talk up Shaun some more. Man, that guy could talk about the Sixers forever. And you, sneak out of here, jump into Starr's car, and get out.",
        "Langston: He'll see me and follow.",
        "Markko: Well, go to the diner. He has to stay in his spot near the door, right? Just keep your back turned to him.",
        "Langston: What if this doesn't work?",
        "Markko: I'll make sure it does. When you get out of here, I'll meet you there.",
