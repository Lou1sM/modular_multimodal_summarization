        "Starr: I'll always be your biggest fan and don't you ever doubt that in times of laughter times of tears you just reach out and I'll be here saying \"together we can take on the world\" oh, yeah together we can do anything if we just believe together you and me I'm -- I'm sorry, I -- I can't do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: Isn't this thing supposed to come equipped with a bottle of champagne or something around here?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, it is, but I put the champagne in the trunk while you were talking to the driver.",
        "Tate: Why?",
        "Adriana: Because it's a little early, don't you think? And I didn't want you getting smashed on the way there and making an ass of yourself on \"The View.\"",
        "Tate: Oh. You don't trust me very much, do you?",
        "Adriana: Not as far as I can throw this limo. I got to call Rex. Where's my phone? Ugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Adriana, where are you, girl? I just got out of my meeting, and I think we're going to be able to work with that company. I want to hear all about \"the view,\" so take notes, and don't let Tate talk about himself the entire time. We really need this free publicity. All right, lady, I'll see you later. Bye.",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Layla: Hey.",
        "Evangeline: Who's going to be on \"The View\"?",
        "Layla: Tate Harmon, and hopefully he'll talk about modeling for our company.",
        "Evangeline: That's great.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm. Straighten out your back.",
        "Evangeline: Layla, will you not give me advice? Aren't you the one who told me that yoga's not supposed to be a competitive sport?",
        "Layla: Well, get off of Todd and I will.",
        "Evangeline: Ok, I mean this in the nicest possible way, but, really, butt out.",
        "Layla: Fine, it's your life, but I don't understand why any sane person would want to spend any time with that whack job. I mean, there are so many other deserving specimens out there.",
        "Evangeline: Like who?",
        "Layla: Like -- 180 pounds of solid, sensitive, \"treat you like a queen\" muscle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Bo: Well, I got some bad news. Our lead didn't pan out.",
        "Nora: Oh, God. I keep telling myself, you know, that we're really lucky that Matthew and I got out alive, but, God, we lost everything. We lost -- and I'm not just talking about the valuables that -- Rachel's baby book, my photo albums of Matthew, my wedding albums -- not that the last one was any great shakes, but -- you know? Get these people, will you?",
        "Bo: \"People\" -- jeez. These are terrorists, you know? They're able to crawl right back underground whenever they want to.",
        "Nora: I thought the whole point of a hate crime was to be able to take responsibility for it. I mean, since when do white supremacists keep quiet?",
        "Bo: Since now, I guess. I don't know.",
        "Nora: I spoke to Vincent Jones' bodyguard's grandfather.",
        "Bo: I know -- I did, too. You know, he and his wife were lucky to make it out alive.",
        "Nora: Well, I got to give him the same old same old, you know? \"We're doing everything we can.\"",
        "Bo: I think it's time we try a new approach.",
        "Nora: You got one?",
        "Bo: Yeah, I'm working on something. You know, we may be out of leads, but at least we're not out of options.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I'm sorry to call you in on your day off. I just figured you'd want to be here -- not because it's just, you know, your case, I --",
        "Antonio: No, you made the right call.",
        "Talia: Ok.",
        "Antonio: This isn't just any case, this is about my family and friends, and so long as these jerks are out there, they're all in danger.",
        "Talia: How is Jamie this morning?",
        "Antonio: She's upset. How else is she going to be?",
        "Talia: Well, you're a great father and you're going to make everything ok for her, I'm sure.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, I'm not so sure that's going to be so easy. So where do we stand?",
        "Talia: Vincent Jones is on his way in with Shaun.",
        "Antonio: And I left word for Cristian.",
        "Talia: What about Jessica?",
        "Antonio: What about her?",
        "Talia: Well, she's your wife, she was a victim, too. Don't you think she -- she should be a part of this?",
        "Antonio: No. I don't want her here.",
        "Talia: Something's wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I don't know how I'm going to tell Antonio about this.",
        "Nash: I still think I should go with you.",
        "Jessica: No, it'll make things worse.",
        "Nash: I'll be waiting.",
        "Jessica: I know -- it's the only thing that makes this bearable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: But -- but, Starr, you were doing so great.",
        "Marcie: Starr? Starr, look, I've already heard you sing -- you were great, ok? If you want to start over, you can --",
        "Britney: Wait, excuse me, Mrs. McBain, but I don't think it's fair for Starr to get special treatment. I mean, she's had just as much time to prepare as the rest of us.",
        "Marcie: Thank you very much, Britney --",
        "Britney: Yeah, but if she can't get through the audition, what's she going to do when the place is full of people?",
        "Marcie: This is a high school musical, Britney, it's not a Broadway show. Ok? Look, why don't you sit down, catch your breath, and I'll give you another chance later if you want to, ok?",
        "Starr: That sounds good, thank you.",
        "Marcie: Good. Cole Thornhart.",
        "Starr: Cole's trying out?",
        "Marcie: Yes. I've encouraged as many guys as I can find -- we need the men.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry, but if -- if Cole's auditioning, I can't be in the show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I was so sure I put my cell phone in my purse.",
        "Tate: Well, I was kind of rushing you.",
        "Adriana: Can I borrow yours?",
        "Tate: Uh -- I think it's dead and I didn't bring my charger. I'm sorry.",
        "Adriana: I bet the driver has one. Excuse me?",
        "Tate: I would not bother him if I were you.",
        "Adriana: Really? Why?",
        "Tate: He said something about being awake for 22 hours, so --",
        "Adriana: Oh. Is he going to be ok?",
        "Tate: I'm sure he'll be fine. I just -- you know, get us into New York, and there's plenty of phones there you can use.",
        "Adriana: You're right. I'm kind of a cell phone addict. Well, we're on the turnpike. How long do you think before we get to New York?",
        "Tate: A couple hours.",
        "Adriana: We should've brought a movie or something. What are we going to do to kill the time?",
        "Tate: I don't know -- two smart people like us, I'm sure we'll think of something.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Cristian and I aren't on the best of terms right now.",
        "Layla: Things could change.",
        "Evangeline: Can you please not talk about Todd in front of him?",
        "Layla: Forget about Todd. He doesn't want anything to do with you -- as a friend or anything else.",
        "Evangeline: He's looking for his son.",
        "Layla: He doesn't want your help, Vange. Don't you get that? Cristian looks lonely over there. All you have to tell him is how much of a mistake you made.",
        "Evangeline: Not going to happen.",
        "Layla: Uh, what happened to my sister -- the liberated woman who wouldn't let any man use her as a consolation prize?",
        "Evangeline: Can you just knock it off, please?",
        "Layla: He's on his way over here.",
        "Cristian: What's going on? Is -- is this class closed?",
        "Layla: No. It's wide open, isn't it, Vange? Why don't you find a spot and put your mat down?",
        "Cristian: You ok with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hi, sweetie. How'd you get here? Where's your dad?",
        "Nash: Maybe someone should call Antonio.",
        "Carlotta: Jamie? Oh, hello.",
        "Antonio: Look, nothing's wrong, ok? I just don't see any reason to include Jessica.",
        "Talia: She's married to you. She and Nash almost died in the fire at your club, and she suffered because these people were going after you.",
        "Antonio: I don't see your point, Officer Sahid.",
        "Talia: From a public relations standpoint, I don't think it's a bad idea to show the commissioner's own niece as one of the victims.",
        "Antonio: I don't even know where Jessica is.",
        "Talia: Oh. Ok, fine. I -- it's just a thought. Gentlemen. The Commissioner's been expecting you.",
        "Nora: That's a long shot.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but it's a shot, which is more than we've got right now.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Come on.",
        "Nora: Hi. Hello, Vincent, Shaun. Mr. Wynn, District Attorney Hanen.",
        "Mr. Wynn: Nice to see you again.",
        "Nora: Nice to see you.",
        "Bo: How's your wife doing, Mr. Wynn?",
        "Mr. Wynn: Doctor tells me she's going to be just fine.",
        "Shaun: She's tough.",
        "Bo: I know that you've had to deal with this \"one pure people\" group before, right?",
        "Mr. Wynn: Yes, sir, I have.",
        "Vincent: The question is, what are you going to do about it?",
        "Bo: We're going to put them in prison with your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Where's Antonio?",
        "Carlotta: He had to go to the police station. He asked me to bring Jamie here and stay with her. He didn't think you'd be here. Why don't you go to your room for a little while and play, mija, and I'll come in right after I talk with Jess, ok?",
        "Jessica: Carlotta, look, I know that you're very busy, and I'm home --",
        "Carlotta: I'd rather stay. You can leave now.",
        "Jessica: Look, Carlotta, Nash and I were discussing Bree's visitation schedule.",
        "Carlotta: Forgive me, but I think that that can wait. There are much more pressing matters to deal with right now.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I forgive you, but it seems to me that this is Jessica's place, as well, and she should have some say as to who stays or goes.",
        "Carlotta: This is also my son's home -- and Jamie's -- and, frankly, after what happened yesterday, I don't think that those kind of decisions are entirely up to Jessica anymore. Antonio asked me to bring Jamie here and to take care of her, and I think it would be much easier for her if you left.",
        "Nash: You know what? You got a point.",
        "Jessica: Nash --",
        "Nash: Let's call Antonio, get him over here. We'll explain everything and see what he wants to be done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: I cooperated with you even when I was considered a suspect. I put you together with Shaun and his grandfather, and look what happened, commissioner. What else do you want?",
        "Mr. Wynn: Oh, settle down, son. Let the man say his peace. I'd like to hear what the commissioner has to say.",
        "Bo: Mr. Jones, I know that you've suffered -- so have most of the people in this room.",
        "Vincent: Yeah -- and those O.P.P. types keep staying one step ahead of this damn police station.",
        "Bo: That's why I think we should try a new tactic.",
        "Mr. Wynn: How you going to do that?",
        "Bo: The mayor's office asked us to keep our theory that these are hate crimes out of the press.",
        "Vincent: Why?",
        "Bo: Because he doesn't want to spark any racial tension.",
        "Vincent: He doesn't want to spark any racial tension?",
        "Mr. Wynn: Let the man finish, Vincent.",
        "Bo: I think that the mayor is wrong in this case. I want to hold a press conference, I want to tell the people the truth, and I'd like all of you to be there with me.",
        "Nora: You see, if we stand up there together, we can rally the public. They can see all the different kinds of people that this group is targeting.",
        "Bo: If, by putting a face on the victims, just might put a face on the perpetrators. Maybe somebody they know -- maybe they're sick of what these people stand for, and they'll give them up. Or maybe this group will try to retaliate, and we will be ready for them.",
        "Vincent: Commissioner, are you talking about baiting them with our lives? Haven't we all suffered enough already?",
        "Shaun: We have. But who's next?",
        "Bo: I'll provide you all with police protection, but I can't deny that there is a risk involved.",
        "Nora: Listen, it beats sitting around waiting for the next incident --",
        "Vincent: Hmm.",
        "Nora: But that's just my opinion.",
        "Shaun: Maybe he's right, brother -- think about Ted. It's just a matter of time before somebody else dies.",
        "Bo: I'm going to hold this press conference no matter what, but it'll really have teeth if all of you were standing there with me. So what do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, by all means, set yourself up -- whatever.",
        "Layla: Dude, I didn't know you were into yoga.",
        "Cristian: I wasn't --",
        "Evangeline: He's not. I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
        "Cristian: Evangeline took me to one of her yoga classes after one of my fights.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm?",
        "Cristian: She thought it would be good for my shoulder, and she was right.",
        "Evangeline: It helped?",
        "Cristian: I just said you were right, didn't I?",
        "Evangeline: Ok, well, great. I'm glad it helped.",
        "Cristian: I didn't think I'd be running into you. I -- I figured you'd be working.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I took the day off. I had plans to go out of town and -- and they fell through.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah? Where were you going?",
        "Evangeline: Chicago.",
        "Cristian: With Todd?",
        "Evangeline: How do you know that?",
        "Cristian: Blair told me. She called me to tell me she was going with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Ok, Mrs. McBain, if Starr doesn't want to audition, then let her leave.",
        "Langston: Have you heard her sing, you moron?",
        "Britney: Yeah, but she said what she needs are more guys.",
        "Henry: Don't get yourself kicked out -- she's not as good as you anyway.",
        "Britney: Henry, shut up!",
        "Henry: Sorry.",
        "Cole: Hey, that would be crazy for Starr to quit the play.",
        "Starr: Quit what, Cole? I didn't even get a part yet.",
        "Marcie: With a voice like that, you're going to get a part if you want it.",
        "Cole: And do you know how awesome you sound? You can't take yourself out of the running. You know, I didn't even want to audition for this, but Mrs. McBain blackmailed me.",
        "Marcie: It's not blackmail, it's quid pro quo -- big difference.",
        "Cole: Ok, you know, she told me that I had to audition or she wouldn't write me a letter of recommendation so I could play sports again. I don't even want to be in this freaking show, and I definitely don't want to cause trouble for you again.",
        "Starr: Look, I didn't want to audition, either, but I had to because Lang-- wait, Langston, you knew that Cole signed up on that audition sheet, and you signed my name anyway. Are you happy now?",
        "Starr: Langston, you are so dead.",
        "Langston: I'm sorry.",
        "Britney: Ok, I don't think it's right for Starr to bring all of her little personal problems into auditions. I mean, we're all trying to concentrate.",
        "Cole: Look, there is no problem. I'm just not going to audition.",
        "Starr: Cole, if you don't audition, then you can't play baseball, so I'm just going to leave. Just forget that you ever saw me.",
        "Marcie: No, no, no -- ok, ok --",
        "Starr: No, really --",
        "Marcie: Calm down. Ok, everybody, please, just -- just calm down. Look, if you don't want to audition and you don't decide to stick around, that's fine, ok, it's your decision. And you are -- you're free to go, and I will still write you a letter of recommendation.",
        "Cole: Seriously?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Scram.",
        "Cole: Oh, thank you. And, listen, you're not going to be sorry about this. Trust me, Starr is the one with the talent. You're going to be great.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: Ok! Crisis averted, right? Let's move on. Um -- Britney Jennings.",
        "Britney: Yeah, sorry -- if Cole isn't auditioning, neither am I.",
        "Amber: We're so out of here.",
        "Henry: Oh -- right. I mean, I have PSATs to study for.",

        "Tate: Whoa.",
        "Adriana: You'd better be ready with an answer.",
        "Tate: \"Well, at first I couldn't believe it, and then I was very angry. You know, I was not even 30 years old, and I felt like my life was over.\"",
        "Adriana: That was good.",
        "Tate: And then I'll do a clever little segue about how modeling underwear changed my life.",
        "Adriana: And you better be ready for them to ask you about your love life.",
        "Tate: I don't think they're going to ask me about that.",
        "Adriana: Have you ever seen \"The View\"?",
        "Tate: I can't say that I have -- I'm a late sleeper. Besides, the Tate never discusses his love life.",
        "Adriana: All right, \"that\" has to stop.",
        "Tate: What does?",
        "Adriana: You know -- the whole talking about yourself in the third person. You try that on \"The View,\" and those ladies will eat you alive.",

        "Vincent: I am not afraid to stand up to these people. But I don't want anything else to happen to Mr. Wynn or anybody else.",
        "Bo: Vincent, I understand exactly how you feel -- Nora and I have a son that we're worried about.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, but if you get these O.P. people turned up, no telling what the hell they'll do next.",
        "Shaun: It's too late to worry about that.",
        "Mr. Wynn: Oh, we get them turned up just by being who we are.",
        "Shaun: Maybe we can make that work for us.",
        "Mr. Wynn: Turn and face them. Take back the power.",
        "Bo: Antonio?",
        "Antonio: The way I see it, we don't have a choice. I don't want my daughter growing up afraid of anything, and I certainly don't want her growing up ashamed of who she is. I want her to be proud and I want her to be strong. Until she's old enough to fight her own battles, then I'm just going to have to stand up for her.",
        "Talia: Count me in, too, commissioner. Nothing gets me madder than this kind of ignorance.",
        "Mr. Wynn: It's up to you, Vincent. We do this together, or not at all.",
        "Vincent: You know I'm down for the cause.",
        "Mr. Wynn: Let's do it.",
        "Vincent: Hey, Commissioner, when's this press conference?",
        "Bo: Well, it's all set up, so let's go have our say.",

        "Jessica: I'm fine. I'll walk you out.",
        "Nash: Ok.",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Nash: Sorry I made things worse. I just didn't want you to have to go through that alone.",
        "Jessica: It's ok -- I'm not worried about me, I'm worried about Jamie.",
        "Nash: You think she saw us kissing?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. God, I don't know, I hope not. I've hurt her so much.",
        "Nash: Look, it's better than if you'd gone through with the adoption, right? Hey -- hey? She would've been brought up in a house full of secrets and lies, and no kid should be brought up like that. All right?",
        "Jessica: I guess, yeah.",
        "Nash: Everything's going to be ok.",
        "Jessica: Well, I would like to believe that, but, um, there's no easy way out of this situation. I mean, everyone's going to get hurt.",
        "Carlotta: Oh -- come on, let's go over and have a seat. Just sit by me, with bunny, and we'll have a little talk, and then maybe after we talk, you'll have a little appetite for that sandwich? Oh. Oh, honey, I know you're sad, but remember what Papi promised you -- we will work this through together.",
        "Jamie: I saw Jessica and Nash. ,",
        "Carlotta: What did you see, sweetheart? Can you tell your abuela what you saw?",
        "Jessica: Nash is gone.",
        "Carlotta: Good. I'm glad.",
        "Jessica: And I think it's time that you go, as well.",
        "Carlotta: Jamie is not herself. She hasn't eaten a thing today yet. Antonio asked me to take care --",
        "Jessica: I realize that, but Antonio didn't know that I was going to be home and available to look after Jamie.",
        "Carlotta: And can you do that?",
        "Jessica: Absolutely. Look, what happened yesterday was awful. And that's why I need a second, a moment with Jamie, to apologize to her and ask her to forgive me. Can you understand that?",
        "Carlotta: Sweetheart, I'm going to go now for a little while, but I'll be back. And Papi will be back, too, ok? I love you.",
        "Carlotta: Do not hurt my granddaughter again.",

        "Nora: Will you please talk some sense into your son?",
        "Bo: Why aren't you in school? Matthew: I didn't have school. It was a teachers' conference. So Mom called me and asked me to tape the press conference, and I asked her what it was about.",
        "Nora: And I told him. And then Mr. Big Shot got Asa's driver to bring him down here.",
        "Bo: Well, I don't have a problem with him being here. Matthew: See?",
        "Nora: Will you just tell him the rest? Matthew: I want to be up on stage with everybody else.",
        "Bo: Why? Matthew: Because my mom's Jewish, which means I'm half Jewish, and those people burned her house down because they don't want to live with people like me and Mom. And I don't like that, and I want them to know it.",
        "Bo: Makes sense.",
        "Nora: Bo? Matthew: I don't want you to stand up there all alone.",
        "Nora: I won't be alone.",
        "Bo: Nora, he's part of this, whether we like it or not.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, Dad.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Nora: You are very pushy. I don't know where you get it from. But I'll be proud to have you standing beside me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: You know, I'm pretty sure I can handle those ladies.",
        "Adriana: Really? Well, maybe the Tate should have a conversation with the Donald.",
        "Tate: But I'm cute and cuddly. Why would they go after me?",
        "Adriana: Because they know their audience loves to see them do that. And it's a dead giveaway, by the way.",
        "Tate: What is?",
        "Adriana: The whole \"The Tate\" thing. You do it when you're nervous, or when you're trying to put on a show. Listen, if you start in with the whole \"the Tate\" this and \"the Tate\" that when they start asking you about dating, and when you want to get married, those women are going to know that you have something to hide.",
        "Tate: Well, they're just going to be disappointed.",
        "Adriana: Why is that?",
        "Tate: Nothing.",
        "Adriana: I don't buy that.",
        "Tate: Look, there's nothing to hide, ok, because there's nothing to say about the subject. I don't date, I am not seeing anyone, and I have never, ever been in love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: It totally makes sense that Blair would go to Chicago with Todd. I mean, he's looking for his son, and they have children together.",
        "Layla: You know, I better go change into my yoga clothes.",
        "Cristian: You seemed surprised when I said Blair went with Todd.",
        "Evangeline: I'm not talking about Todd with you, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Right. Good point. But his name somehow always comes up, doesn't it?",
        "Evangeline: Look, it's really no big deal. I mean, the trip -- actually, Todd got some information that led him to believe that his son might actually be alive in Chicago, and I didn't think he should chase down that lead by himself.",
        "Cristian: What happened?",
        "Evangeline: Well, I mean, he changed his mind -- he said he didn't want me to go with him. I mean, when you think about it, why take your friend when you can go with the woman you love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Britney, just call me --",
        "Marcie: Hold it, hold it! Do you really do whatever Britney tells you to do?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Marcie: So, you're all ok with being the reason that there will be no high school musical this spring?",
        "Henry: Oh --",
        "Britney: Oh, but -- but you have Starr, and I mean, she's so good, she can be the farmers and the cowboys.",
        "[Students laugh]",
        "Marcie: Oh, knock it off. I said knock it off!",
        "Britney: Oh, no, it'll be very avant-garde. Amber, Henry, come on.",
        "Marcie: Nobody is going anywhere until I say so.",
        "Starr: Thanks for nothing, Langston.",
        "Langston: Britney's leaving because you showed her up.",
        "Starr: It still should have been my decision!",
        "Langston: I'm sorry!",
        "Cole: All right, all right, listen, we're going to have to do something, or Britney's going to cause trouble for Mrs. McBain. God, I can't believe I screwed up things again.",
        "Starr: Cole, what are you talking about?",
        "Cole: Well, up to now, I was just the guy that cost the football team the championship. Now I'm the guy that ruined the school play.",
        "Starr: Cole, you didn't do that.",
        "Langston: Britney did.",
        "Starr: You know what, guys? Maybe there's a way to fix this.",
        "Cole: Yeah? How?",
        "Starr: Well, Britney said that she's not auditioning because you can't, right?",
        "Cole: Well, I can't audition because of you. Or can I?",

        "Cristian: Well, like what?",
        "Evangeline: Oh, come on, Cristian, I know you have some smart comment about how Todd bailed on me.",
        "Cristian: Look, I don't know what's going on with Todd and Blair. I -- I can never really get them. But if you're hurting because of it, then I truly am sorry.",
        "Layla: Uh -- guys, there was a notice in the ladies' locker room. This class was canceled, so we'll have to go get our Zen someplace else. Hello? Did I miss something?",
        "Cristian: Yeah -- I'm going to go hit the weights. I'll see you. Bye.",
        "Layla: What's going on?",
        "Evangeline: Oh, I just -- well, I -- I found out why Todd didn't want me to go with him to Chicago.",
        "Layla: Ok. Why?",
        "Evangeline: Because I'm not Blair.",
        "Cristian: I just got a message. Bo's in Angel Square giving a press conference about the arson case.",
        "Evangeline: You need to be there.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I know. You want to come with me?",
        "Evangeline: Uh -- well, I -- I have to change. Can we meet you over there?",
        "Cristian: Ok, sure. See you later.",
        "Layla: Maybe we should skip the press conference and go get some comfort food.",
        "Evangeline: I can't. I can't even think about food right now.",
        "Layla: Todd is out of your life, girl, and that's a good thing. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Evangeline: Whew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I'd like to thank you all for showing up today, especially on such short notice. I picked this place because Angel Square has always been Llanview's Center of Diversity, and I think it's the perfect place to say what I have to say today. I know that you all must be aware of the number of instances of arson that have happened in the past few months. Well, today, I can tell you with certainty that these fires are the work of a white supremacist group that's been targeting minorities all over Llanview. This group likes to refer to itself as \"one pure people.\" And before I take any of your questions, I'd like to say something directly to them. Llanview is not afraid of you. These people that are standing with me today -- they're all people who have lost someone or something because of your hatred, because of your ignorance, and your cowardice. But we are not broken, and we will not back away from this fight. We are friends, we are grandfathers, and -- and husbands, grandsons, fathers, moms, sons -- we are all proud members of all races and of all religions, and we refuse to be your victims. You see, we are Llanview.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: And we won't take this lying down.",
        "Adriana: You've really never, ever been in love with anybody?",
        "Tate: It's not a big deal. I just -- you know, it hasn't happened for me, and I never made it a priority.",
        "Adriana: Why not?",
        "Tate: My whole life was baseball. And when that ended, I had to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. So you know, there was never a right time for me to get involved.",
        "Adriana: But you're open to the possibility, right? I mean, you could luck out.",
        "Tate: Yeah -- I don't know about that. All the good ones are taken. And the ones that look good -- well, they just want the Tate.",
        "Adriana: You just said a little bit ago that the Tate was all there was. Did you change your mind?",
        "Tate: Well, even if there was something, who would be interested in him? Behind the show is just another average guy.",
        "Adriana: You couldn't be more wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Jamie, I love you so much. I love you more than anything else in the world. And that is never, ever, ever going to change. Do you understand that? Ok. I am so sorry about what happened in court yesterday. And I know it was scary for you, because it sure did scare me. And I want you to know that you didn't do anything wrong. Nothing at all. It was not your fault at all. Because I know that sometimes, little girls think that things that happen are their fault, and it's just not true. You are the most wonderful, amazing, lovable little girl in the whole wide world. And I did a horrible thing. I know I hurt you. And I hope that you can forgive me for my horrible mistake.",
        "Jamie: You mean kissing Nash? Was that the mistake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: That's very generous of you, Adriana, but I'm afraid there's less to me than meets the eye.",
        "Adriana: Tate, you're charming and funny and spontaneous, and not to mention, you look hot in your underwear. Lose the act. Let the real guy show. He's a lot more interesting than the Tate.",
        "Tate: You really think so?",
        "Adriana: You got me hooked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Well, I think it would be ok if we both auditioned.",
        "Cole: You do?",
        "Starr: Look, if our parents flip out, we'll tell them that we go to school together. We have the right to be in the same activities.",
        "Cole: Yeah, you think your dad would buy that?",
        "Starr: Look, I don't care, Cole. I don't want to put you in the mess with Britney.",
        "Cole: You sure about this?",
        "Starr: Not really, but -- Cole, I can't live with the alternative.",
        "Marcie: So you're all fine with just following Britney out of here like a bunch of sheep?",
        "Amber: Works for me.",
        "[Giggles]",
        "Cole: I changed my mind.",
        "Britney: You did?",
        "Cole: Yeah, and I'm sure you'll all -- all live to regret it, but I'll sing for you.",
        "Marcie: Thank you.",
        "Britney: Oh. Well, if Cole can audition, I guess we all can. I'm really glad we stood up for you.",
        "Marcie: Just so you know, that letter of recommendation that you wanted -- it is totally in the bag.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, thank Starr, because if she hadn't have told me it was ok, I wouldn't have done it.",
        "Marcie: So how is this whole thing going to play out with your parents?",
        "Starr: I don't even know where they are.",
        "Marcie: What? Why not?",
        "Starr: They've taken off to go find my dad's kid that he had with Margaret Cochran.",
        "Marcie: Really? But -- I mean, maybe I was mistaken, but I thought that he had died.",
        "Starr: Oh, no, we all thought that, but it seems like we were wrong.",
        "Marcie: Oh, well, that's great. Well, Starr, that's great. You know, maybe they'll find him. You know, I mean, no kid should be taken away from parents like yours. They're so loving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Oh -- I don't feel so good.",
        "Layla: Um -- just how sick are you?",
        "Evangeline: I'll let you know when I figure out how late I am.",
        "Layla: Oh, my God.",
        "Bo: Hey, Cris.",
        "Cristian: Hey, guys. I guess I missed it, huh?",
        "Bo: Oh, I wish you had been here sooner. Yeah, you did.",
        "Cristian: Damn, I'm sorry. Matthew: Do you think those people were watching?",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, I think they saw it.",
        "Matthew: What do you think's going to happen?",
        "Bo: I think that they're going to be real mad.",
        "Nora: Yeah? Well, so is the rest of Llanview now. And maybe -- just maybe -- somebody in that group has a conscience. Maybe somebody saw us all standing up there and realized what they were doing was wrong. And maybe that person will have the guts to stand up, like you did today.",
        "Bo: Come here, little man. Huh-huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I guess I got here too late.",
        "Talia: Yes. It's all over.",
        "Cristian: Have you seen my brother?",
        "Talia: No, he left right after. He said he wanted to check on Jamie.",
        "Cristian: Well, is something wrong?",
        "Talia: I don't know. If I see him, I'll tell him you're looking for him, though.",
        "Cristian: Ok. Thanks. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So you saw Nash and I kissing, huh? Well, that must have been pretty confusing.",
        "Jamie: You were kissing Nash like you kiss Papi.",
        "Jessica: Wow, nothing gets by you, huh? Ok. I screwed up. I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Jamie: Are you sorry?",
        "Antonio: Hi, baby. My mom left?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I asked her to give me a moment alone with Jamie.",
        "Antonio: You feeling any better?",
        "Jamie: Jessica's sorry about the court and the kissing.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Tate: Ladies and gentlemen, this is my Adriana.",
        "Todd: I really want to talk to you.",
        "Evangeline: I have some important things to talk to you about, too.",
        "Nash: I might leave town. But if I do, it won't be alone.",
        "Antonio: She said she was sorry about kissing somebody? Who?"
