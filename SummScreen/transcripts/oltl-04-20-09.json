        "Charlie and Viki talk about where their relationship is going. And she invites him to live with her at Llanfair. The stabber is still on the loose. John, Fish and Marty discover that he's murdered Talia. Yet they still haven't a clue who he is. The mayor is on the warpath and ready to nail John for the murder. Fish and Marty urge John to run, but he does not resist arrest. When it looks as though everything has gone well for Shane after the bone marrow transplant, Roxy encourages Gigi to tell Rex what Stacy did and realize that they are no longer at her desperate mercy. But right when she's ready to do that, Shane has a fatal reaction to the treatment. At that point, Stacy reminds Gigi that she still needs her. Schuyler knows that Stacy is up to no good and notices that she may not have donated her own blood for that transfusion."

        "Gigi: Not now.",
        "Roxy: You snooze, you lose. That sister, princess bitch from hell -- I'm sure she's right down the hall; she's getting ready for her close-up. She's going to sashay up to Rex and I'm sure she's going to lay it on real thick how she saved your son.",
        "Gigi: She is saving him. Without her blood --",
        "Roxy: Hey, it isn't Stacy's blood that's saving him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: What was that?",
        "Stacy: I -- I was just throwing out a tissue.",
        "Schuyler: It's not a trashcan, Stace. It's for medical waste -- used syringes, things like that.",
        "Stacy: Oh, my bad. Do I look as wiped as I feel? Oh, I need to make myself look human again. Whoo.",
        "Schuyler: You sure that's all you were tossing in there?",
        "Stacy: Why don't you put your hand in there and find out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: This was a good day, wasn't it?",
        "Charlie: What?",
        "Viki: Well, Shane had his transplant today, which means now he has a chance.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Charlie: Yeah, that's great.",
        "Viki: I must say, I kind of wish his aunt Stacy had not been the donor, but she was. And the important thing, of course, is that now there is hope for Shane, right? And we got to celebrate Chloe today. I thought it was a lovely service, didn't you?",
        "Charlie: Very nice.",
        "Viki: Jared and Natalie seemed genuinely pleased that Jessie asked them to be godparents. And Jessica was so happy, thank God. You know, the whole family gathered for a joyous occasion which I'm sorry to say is something of a change.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well it's been a pretty rough time for everyone.",
        "Viki: I have to wonder if that's why Nora didn't come. You know, her difficult times are only just beginning.",
        "Charlie: What happened to Matthew shouldn't happen to any kid.",
        "Viki: No. Clint was really, really upset that she didn't come. He seems to feel that she would rather spend her days with Bo right now.",
        "Charlie: And is that why Clint was all over you?",
        "Viki: Excuse me?",
        "Charlie: Well, he was. And you were pretty much letting it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Dr. Saybrooke, I, uh, wasn't expecting to find you here.",
        "Marty: What is it? Is something wrong?",
        "Oliver: Do you happen to know where John McBain is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: John McBain would not kill two people and then stab the woman that he just married.",
        "Nora: I know. I get that. But the knife that was found under the floorboards of Zach Rosen's motel room had Blair's blood on it and John's partial print.",
        "Bo: But he wouldn't plant evidence trying to frame Rosen. That's not the way John operates.",
        "Nora: Okay, so what do we do with this? Mayor Lowell, you are back. How nice.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Your people haven't picked up John McBain yet.",
        "Bo: They're on it.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Well let's hope you waited long enough for McBain to make his escape.",
        "Bo: Are you saying what I think you are?",
        "Mayor Lowell: I know that cops protect each other. If he's not brought in here within the next hour --",
        "Bo: I said he will be here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Talia?",
        "John: Fish, over here!",
        "Oliver: Oh my God. Oh my God.",
        "John: I'm sorry.",
        "Oliver: Well, are -- are you sure?",
        "John: She was dead before I pulled her out of the water.",
        "Oliver: Oh, come on. There's nothing you can do?",
        "John: I just found her face-down in the pool, man.",
        "Oliver: She was -- she was looking for you. I shouldn't have left her alone.",
        "John: Hey, Fish, whoever did this may still be on the grounds. Why don't you check the perimeter?",
        "Oliver: Okay.",
        "Marty: John? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, what happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What do you mean it isn't really Stacy's blood?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, why don't you just leave the details to me, all right, genius? I'll make a copy of this and I'll change John Doe to Stacy Morasco. How hard could that be? It will look like I'm the match. So all you have to do is zip your lips. We'll keep the real donor's identity between us and Rex will never find out about your secret.",
        "Roxy: Well, you know, it isn't just, you know, Stacy's blood that's saving him. It's you and Rex and the love that you got for your kid, that you got for each other. See, he's got a mom and dad. I mean, he's got a family, so his life is worth fighting for.",
        "Gigi: He'll still have us. We'll still love him.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but you won't be together if your sister has her way.",
        "Gigi: I made a promise.",
        "Roxy: To your trashy sister? No, baby. That don't count.",
        "Gigi: I made a promise to God. I said that if he'd save my son, I would give up anything.",
        "Roxy: What kind of God would want you to give away the man you love? I mean, you know, baby, I'm no church lady or nothing like that, but what is God if it's not about love? And why would he try to take that away?",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "Gigi: Maybe you're right.",
        "Roxy: So you'll tell Rex what your sister's been doing?",
        "Gigi: As soon as I get a chance.",
        "Roxy: You go, girl. You blow that bitch right out of the water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Go ahead. Stick your unprotected hand in there. See if you can find what it is you think I'm hiding. Oh, are you afraid you are going to catch something? That might be worth it, though, right? Because you could catch me doing something sleazy.",
        "Schuyler: [Scoffs] Stop it.",
        "Stacy: No, you stop it. You're not my mother. You're my roommate.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well you're overreacting. What up with that?",
        "Stacy: Because you keep trying to protect me from myself.",
        "Schuyler: And you don't think you need it?",
        "Stacy: Look, I just saved my nephew's life. I have a conscience.",
        "Schuyler: Do you have a conscience, Stace?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Anything?",
        "Oliver: No, nothing. The security guard didn't see anything, either. What is that?",
        "John: Rosen's ring.",
        "Oliver: Rosen is in lockup and that ring was in the evidence room.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Oliver: John, I -- I have to ask this -- did you do this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So we made it through transplant day?",
        "Michael: So far.",
        "Rex: You hear that Shane? This is day zero and counting. Nothing but plus days from here on out.",
        "Gigi: So when does engraftment start, again?",
        "Michael: Probably around day 14-plus.",
        "Rex: When the mighty cells will be storming the castle.",
        "Roxy: And they know how to get there?",
        "Michael: They don't need a map. And I will be monitoring the situation from initiation, to engraftment, see how you're progressing --",
        "Shane: And it's going to work, right?",
        "Michael: You know, I do not have my crystal ball. So, I cannot see into the future and I can't be sure about anything, okay? But we have done absolutely everything that we were supposed to do, okay? And that always gives the patient the best chance possible.",
        "Roxy: Well, I did shell out $50 to Madame Delphina and she has a crystal ball and she says you're looking great. Also, she told me I'm going to win back that $50 at the track the next time I go.",
        "Gigi: Shane, there is also this thing called the power of positive thinking and I got to tell you, I am feeling pretty positive right now. I think everything is going to work out for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Okay, I see what this is about. You want to get with me and I turned you down.",
        "Schuyler: No.",
        "Stacy: That's why you brought me the flowers, but Rex was here.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay. Sorry. I didn't want it to go like this.",
        "Stacy: Then get off my case.",
        "Schuyler: Why? What? So you can keep pulling the crap that you're pulling?",
        "Stacy: Oh, if I'm so awful, then why do you keep hanging around?",
        "Schuyler: Because you just spent hours having your blood filtered so you can have them injected into your nephew, okay? I thought maybe -- maybe you could use some support.",
        "Stacy: I have support.",
        "Schuyler: From your sister's boyfriend.",
        "Stacy: Ex-boyfriend. They broke up.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, oh. I wonder why. You're already doing a little number on him, aren't you?",
        "Stacy: I just want him to know I'd do anything for his son.",
        "Schuyler: Why? Why? So he'll come to you out of gratitude? Out of obligation? Oh, you saved his kid so he owes you? Because if that's the case, Stacy, that doesn't make him your boyfriend. It makes him your bitch. Isn't that about right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Are you asking me if I did this?",
        "Oliver: No, I -- what I'm saying -- look, they found a knife in the floorboards of Rosen's motel room. It had Blair's blood on it and a partial print.",
        "John: Did they find a match?",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "John: Whose? Who stabbed Blair?",
        "Oliver: Well, according to the lab reports, John, you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I guess I felt close to Clint today, but that doesn't mean I was encouraging him. Charlie, he was not all over me. Come on, we share children. We were celebrating the christening of our grandchild.",
        "Charlie: Okay, fine. But who picks up Bree at preschool when Jess is busy with the baby? Hmm? And who comes over and helps them with dinner when you're unavailable because you're working late? I'll give you a clue, it isn't Clint. It's good old Charlie. And today, I felt like I was there to hold the coats.",
        "Viki: I'm sorry you felt that way. Boy, you're really very angry with me, aren't you?",
        "Charlie: When I kept quiet about Jared not being a Buchanan, and that started a whole snowball that rolled all they way till Nash was killed, you just walked away from me.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I don't really like to think about those times, but what does that have to do with now?",
        "Charlie: Because I spent the next several months trying to earn your forgiveness, trying to get you back. And thank God I finally did, but I got to say, I think something got changed between us.",
        "Viki: What got changed, Charlie?",
        "Charlie: Back at the old Bon-Jour, it was just Viki and Charlie. A waitress living in one room and a contractor with a drinking problem. Equals.",
        "Viki: And now?",
        "Charlie: Well, the simple fact of the matter is now I always feel like I got my hat in my hand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, I think your hair is growing back already.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Shane: When it does, I want spikes. Not a Mohawk and not a faux-hawk, either.",
        "Roxy: Okay, whatever you want. You know, baby, I would do anything for you. You know that. Just like your mom would.",
        "Rex: Hey, what am I here, chopped liver? I shaved my head.",
        "Gigi: How are you doing?",
        "Shane: I'm sort of sleepy.",
        "Gigi: Are you okay? Do you need anything? Are you comfortable?",
        "Shane: I'm fine.",
        "Rex: You are amazing, that's what you are. You've been so brave and tough through this whole situation. You are going to have to come up with another comic book, like, \"Shane Invincible\" or \"Shane Everlasting.\"",
        "Shane: I know. How about this? The fusion force, where chemo Boy and Super Stacy fuse into one ginormous superpower to blast Lou Kemia into smithereens.",
        "Roxy: You know, like I was telling your mom, you know, it's not just Stacy who is doing this. It's the super love power that's doing its work. Right, Gigi?",
        "Shane: I want to make a comic book for Aunt Stacy, anyway. Where is she?",
        "Roxy: Well, she's probably resting, so, uh, I'll go find her. And I'm going to tell her when I see her that she should just kind of not rush things at all. Give you some time together, like a family.",
        "Roxy: [Sighs] Stacy.",
        "Rex: How about we let you get some rest.",
        "Shane: You guys will be here when I wake up?",
        "Gigi: We're not going anywhere, Shane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Like Rex could be ever be someone's bitch.",
        "Schuyler: Well, how do you explain it then, Stacy?",
        "Stacy: He cares about me. What? He does.",
        "Schuyler: Because you saved his son.",
        "Stacy: Well, that's start.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, well, you need a reality check then.",
        "Stacy: From you?",
        "Schuyler: From somebody. From somebody. Because you're in Stacyland where everything goes according to plan, you do whatever you want, and you'll do whatever it takes to get --",
        "Stacy: Shut up!",
        "Schuyler: I know what you're capable of.",
        "Stacy: Shut the hell up, Schuy!",
        "Schuyler: Or what? What? You going to do something crazy? You going to do something crazy like trade you blood for a dude?",
        "Stacy: You know what? I saved my nephew's life. And you know what? It doesn't matter how I'm doing it, I'm doing it, okay?",
        "Schuyler: Oh, okay. Fine, fine.",
        "Roxy: Hey, how you doing, donor girl?",
        "Stacy: I'm fine. My friend here was just leaving.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, how about I get you some food, cupcake?",
        "Stacy: What do you want?",
        "Roxy: Well, Shane got his transfusion; he got everything that he needed.",
        "Stacy: Good. I hope he gets better now.",
        "Roxy: [Scoffs] That's really nice of you. That's the same kid that you would have let drop dead because his mom wouldn't give his dad over to you.",
        "Stacy: Point, please?",
        "Roxy: The point being that you got no hold over Gigi. It is gone. You lost your leverage.",
        "Stacy: Are you sure you know what that means?",
        "Roxy: Baby, I'm a lot smarter than I look, and you are totally busted. Shane is going to live and there's nothing keeping Gigi from telling Rex the ugly truth about you.",
        "Stacy: Ha. She's not going to do that.",
        "Roxy: Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Oliver: The print on the knife that stabbed Blair -- it was identified as yours, John.",
        "Marty: Oh, come on. You don't believe that John stabbed Blair or Talia.",
        "Oliver: No, I don't. But you know what? It doesn't really matter what I believe, okay? Somebody tipped off the mayor and now he wants your head on a plate. Talia and I -- we were supposed to bring you in for questioning. That's why we were here.",
        "John: Call it in.",
        "Oliver: John, a murdered cop -- half the force will be over here.",
        "John: Do it, Fish. Call it in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I don't know who your tipsters are. They don't run my office.",
        "Mayor Lowell: No, my office runs your office.",
        "Officer: Commissioner, it's Fish on line two.",
        "Bo: Thanks. All right, Fish, what do you got? Did you find McBain?",
        "Oliver: Uh, I did, Commissioner. He's here at Dr. Lord's with Dr. Saybrooke, and, uh --",
        "Bo: \"Uh\" what? Fish?",
        "Oliver: There's a problem, sir.",
        "Bo: What problem?",
        "Oliver: We -- we have an officer down, sir.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Bo, what's wrong?",
        "Mayor Lowell: McBain pull something?",
        "Nora: Oh, God.",
        "Bo: Uh, it's -- it's Talia Sahid. Talia was attacked.",
        "Nora: What? Attacked how?",
        "Bo: She was stabbed.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. Is she all right?",
        "Bo: She's -- she's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Bo's coming over himself. He's with the mayor, John.",
        "John: I don't care about the mayor.",
        "Oliver: Well, he's out to get you, okay? He's not going to care that you've been set up.",
        "Marty: He's right. You were at the police station. They're going to say you stole the ring. They're going to say you're the killer.",
        "Oliver: Would you just go, please? John, get out of here when you still can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie. Our days in Paris, Texas -- it was time out of time. Charlie, I have a complicated life. It gets overwhelming at times and I warned you about that.",
        "Charlie: Well you didn't seem too overwhelmed today. You seemed downright comfy with Clint's arm around your waist.",
        "Viki: But I am. I'm comfy with Bo's arm around my waist. I used to be comfortable with Asa's arm around my waist, especially when he stopped pinching. That's just how they are.",
        "Charlie: Okay, I guess I'm just being unreasonable.",
        "Viki: When you brought me here last Thanksgiving and you showed me this place, I realized that there wasn't another man in the whole world who would do something like that for me. I am with you.",
        "Charlie: Really? Then why aren't we living together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: [Slurring] Just to let you know, it's done, you rotten piece of garbage. Our grandson now has your blood running through his veins. God help him, but I just know he's going to be okay. Coming here, looking at you totally makes me sick. But I got what I needed, and I never have to look at your ugly mug again.",
        "[Roxy choking]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Rex: About what?",
        "Gigi: In private. I have to tell you something.",
        "Rex: Well, we told Shane we'd be here, so --",
        "Gigi: We'll just be right outside the room. He can see us through the window. Please? I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't really important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Going somewhere?",
        "Stacy: Going to see my nephew, of course.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah? Are you sure you should be up and about so soon?",
        "Stacy: You know what? It's not like you care about me.",
        "Schuyler: Wow, that's not true. I just think maybe you should give the kid some space with his mom and dad. He just got transfused, okay?",
        "Stacy: With my blood, okay? I have the right, so just let me go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, what do you want? Tell me so I can get back in to Shane.",
        "Gigi: I can hardly believe that he's going to be all right. Can you? I mean, after thinking the worst --",
        "Rex: I know. I don't want Shane to know it but I've never been more scared in my life.",
        "Gigi: I know, me too. But it's going to be okay, now. I know it is.",
        "Rex: Yeah, as far as leukemia is concerned. I still don't know how to tell him about us.",
        "Gigi: Maybe -- maybe we --",
        "Rex: Maybe we what?",
        "Gigi: Rex, I know I said that I could never trust you again after what happened with Stacy and --",
        "Rex: Yeah?",
        "Gigi: But now with this whole thing with Shane, now that he's got the transfusion and I know he's going to get better --",
        "Rex: Just say it, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Rex, it's about Stacy.",
        "Shane: Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad!",
        "Gigi: Honey! What -- what's wrong?",
        "Shane: My stomach really hurts.",
        "Gigi: Okay, baby. I'm going to get Michael.",
        "Rex: Uh.",
        "Michael: Shane? What's going on, buddy? What's wrong?",
        "Shane: My stomach, it's killing me.",
        "Michael: Your stomach? Okay.",
        "Rex: Mike, what is it?",
        "Gigi: Is he rejecting the transplant?",
        "[Shane groaning]",
        "Michael: Give me a CBC, and I want to check his ABG's. Shane, does your stomach hurt, or do you feel nauseous?",
        "Shane: My stomach still hurts. I'm cold, too.",
        "Michael: Okay, well, we can take care of that.",
        "Gigi: Let me bundle you up.",
        "Rex: Okay, is this the, um, you know, the what do you call it?",
        "Gigi: The graft versus host disease?",
        "Michael: We won't know until we can get a look at his blood.",
        "Gigi: I thought you had him on antibiotics.",
        "Michael: Well, sometimes that's not enough, if he's running a fever. I want to bump up his meds and make sure that nothing takes hold. We're going to take care of that stomachache, all right, buddy? We'll check for fluid overload, too.",
        "Rex: What's that?",
        "Michael: Sometimes the kidneys can't help the high volume of fluid being introduced intravenously, so --",
        "Rex: Mike -- whatever is going on with my son right now, you can fix it, right? Tell me my son's going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Coughing]",
        "Roxy: Get your hands off me, you crazy old --",
        "Nurse: What's wrong?",
        "Roxy: That maniac attacked me.",
        "[Roxy gasps]",
        "Nurse: That's impossible.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, tell that to my throat.",
        "Nurse: How much of this have you had?",
        "Roxy: Look, I just had a couple of swigs, I --",
        "[Roxy gulps]",
        "Roxy: Because my grandson's beating leukemia, so I'm celebrating.",
        "Nurse: You reek of alcohol.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, that's because I spilled it on me when I was in the death grip. Listen, honey, I'm not drunk. I get plastered a lot, and if I were drunk, believe me, I would know it. I'm not even close. This freak tried to kill me. You should look at the monitor if you don't believe me. It's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Why aren't we living together? We've never discussed it, Charlie. I assumed that you were happy with the way things are.",
        "Charlie: Oh, what, you think I'm crazy about living in the Angel Square Hotel?",
        "Viki: I didn't say that.",
        "Charlie: Look, Viki, I've spent most of my life an outsider, a failure -- a drunk. But now I'm sober, living one day at a time, and now my son talks to me about his problems. Calls me up and says, \"Hey, Dad, you want to watch the game tonight?\" And I'm starting a business, and I want to put roots down here in Llanview. And I would like to put those roots down with you.",
        "Viki: I guess I've been a little gun shy, that's all. I didn't want to move too fast. I didn't want to screw things up. Although it seems that things are being screwed up anyway.",
        "Charlie: I want to live with you, Viki. I want to wake up with you beside me every morning for the rest of my life. I don't want you to agree to that just because you think I got all bent out of shape about Clint.",
        "Viki: Well, I want that, too, and it's not because you got angry.",
        "Charlie: Really?",
        "Viki: Yeah, really. Let's go over to Angel Square and get your stuff tonight.",
        "Charlie: Tonight?",
        "Viki: Something wrong with that?",
        "Charlie: Well, it's just that we don't have a place.",
        "Viki: Of course we do.",
        "Charlie: Are you thinking of us living together at Llanfair?",
        "Viki: Charlie, it's my home. I would like it to be our home. I'd like to share it with you. What's the problem?",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Listen, I know it's scary, and every little thing is going to make you jump out of your skin. Things are going to happen, okay? There's going to be good days, and there are going to be bad days, but we are on it. Anything that's possible to be done, we're doing it.",
        "Gigi: This pain, and the fever, it's all of a sudden. It's out of nowhere.",
        "Michael: It can happen that way, okay? The main thing right now is that we just manage his pain, we keep the fever down, and figure out if there's any infection.",
        "Rex: Okay, but after that last big jolt of chemo, any little bug he catches could be fatal.",
        "Michael: No, don't -- just don't. Just don't go there, all right, man?",
        "Michael: Shane, are you feeling any better?",
        "Shane: It still hurts.",
        "Michael: Yeah? It's going to go down, I promise.",
        "Stacy: Why don't you take a five, Gigi?",
        "Gigi: I'm not leaving Shane.",
        "Stacy: You know what? You think it's good for Shane to see how scared you are right now? He's already freaked out enough as it is. Come on. You going to be okay?",
        "Gigi: I will, as soon as Shane is okay.",
        "Stacy: What happened in there, anyway?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. He was asleep, and then he woke up crying because his stomach hurt, and his temperature's going up, and Michael's talking an infection, and an infection could kill him, and I don't know why this is happening!",
        "Stacy: You know, I'm not pretending to know the way God works, but when I walked up, it sounded to me like you were about to break your solemn promise to him.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Stacy: You were going to tell Rex the truth, weren't you? I saw you, so you can't deny it. You were going to tell Rex that you broke up with him so that I would give Shane my stem cells. Man, it would be a shame if he needed another transplant and I wasn't here to give it to him. See what happens when you mess with God? If Shane died, it would be your fault.",

        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Nora: Antonio -- we have to tell Antonio.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You said Officer Sahid was stabbed at Dorian Lord's house.",
        "Bo: That's right.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Isn't that where John McBain moved after he married Blair Cramer?",
        "Bo: What about it?",
        "Mayor Lowell: And you -- you sent officer Sahid there to bring McBain back?",
        "Bo: Yes, I sent her there. Her and her partner, to find McBain.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Why are we standing here? Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What are you waiting for, John? Would you get out of here, while you still can?",
        "John: Fish, you've got to do your job.",
        "Marty: Don't worry about that. The police are on their way.",
        "Oliver: No, they're not going to give him a fair shot. Talia said so herself. You made the mayor look stupid when you broke into Todd Manning's house and found Dr. Saybrooke there. Hey, the mayor doesn't care who did this to Talia. He's going to hang it on you.",
        "Marty: Listen to him, please. They're going to say you did this. They're going to say -- your prints are probably on that knife, too.",
        "Oliver: And you're not going to be able to find who did this from the inside of a jail cell.",
        "Marty: John, please, listen to him. I'm begging you. Please, go save yourself.",
        "[Siren sounds]",
        "Mayor Lowell: Where is he? Where's McBain? Where's McBain?",
        "John: Right here, Mayor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I guess I was just hoping that I could -- I could build us a house, maybe out in the woods somewhere.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Charlie: I mean, I just don't know how to live at Llanfair.",
        "Viki: Why not?",
        "Charlie: Because it's so big. There are servants.",
        "Viki: Yeah, there are servants. The thing is, I don't think of them as servants. I think of them as, you know, the people who run the house. George is in charge of the garden, Lois in the kitchen, you know.",
        "Charlie: Okay, see, that's the thing. I think of Lois as a friend. I don't know how to walk down to the kitchen in the morning and say, \"Lois, I'll have two eggs over easy.\"",
        "Viki: I don't think she would mind if you made your own breakfast.",
        "Charlie: Okay, maybe, and George is a whole 'nother deal. I mean, I bought a few flats of annuals to put in the garden, a few extras, and he's still not speaking to me.",
        "Viki: So you want to feel like you're the boss?",
        "Charlie: I just want to feel like I'm home.",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie. I don't know what else to say to you, except that for me, home is wherever you are.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Charlie: Well -- I think you found the exact right way to say it.",

        "Nurse: This patient's condition is unchanged.",
        "Roxy: Hey, look at these marks. They didn't get there by themselves.",
        "Nurse: I don't know how it happened.",
        "Roxy: What do you think, I took my own hands and I put them around my neck? That didn't happen. I swear on my grandson's life. This freak over here is not as out of it as everybody seems to think that he is.",
        "Nurse: It can happen that patients in this condition experience an occasional muscle spasm, an involuntary movement that might be construed --",
        "Roxy: It's not involuntary, I'm telling you.",
        "Nurse: I don't care what you're telling me! Visiting hours are over. I'm asking you to leave. This time, why don't you not come back?",
        "Roxy: All right, I'm out of here. But I got three words for you. Watch your freaking back.",

        "Gigi: God knows that I love my son.",
        "Stacy: And you promised God that you would do anything, whatever it took, if he would save Shane's life.",
        "Gigi: But why would God want me to give up Rex? God is about love.",
        "Stacy: And I love Rex.",
        "Gigi: Well, he doesn't love you.",

        "Gigi: It's not love, Stacy.",
        "Stacy: Well, it can be, and it will be, because God meant it to be.",
        "Gigi: I don't think God works that way.",
        "Stacy: Who knows how God works anyway? All I know is that you've been backtracking on a promise you made him, and now, all of a sudden, Shane's really sick. So what do you take from that?",
        "Gigi: I don't know.",
        "[Stacy scoffs]",
        "Stacy: I can't believe you would play with your son's life like that, just to keep a guy.",
        "Gigi: Well, isn't that what you were doing? You were ready to let Shane die so you could have Rex.",
        "Stacy: But I didn't. I stuck to my end of the deal. I wasn't like you. You better go to confession, honey. Make a serious act of contrition. You lied to God. You spit in his face, and he is mad.",
        "Rex: Hey, Stacy, everything okay out here?",
        "Gigi: How's Shane?",
        "Rex: He's feeling better.",
        "Stacy: See, Gigi? I told you he'd be okay. I just knew he'd make it through this one, too.",

        "Charlie: Is it okay if I bring my Stevie Wonder CDs?",
        "Viki: Sure, but it's not necessary. I have everything the man ever recorded.",
        "Charlie: You do?",
        "Viki: No, Charlie, I don't. I was joking. Besides, at Llanfair, we groove on Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians.",
        "Charlie: Okay, okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Viki: If you're uncomfortable living there, we could always have that house in the woods.",
        "Charlie: Hey, as long as you want me to be with you, I'm okay.",
        "Viki: I'm all yours -- signed, sealed, delivered. I'm right here.",

        "Roxy: What kind of scare?",
        "Stacy: They thought Shane's body was rejecting the transplant, but the crisis is over. Everything's going the way it's supposed to.",
