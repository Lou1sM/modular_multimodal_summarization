        "Rex: This couldn't wait till morning?",
        "Roxy: Do you think that you and Adriana are the only lovey-doveys that are getting married in Llanview on that particular day? Some riffraff is going to snag all your monkey suits if you don't sign this pronto -- like tonight.",

        "Langston: Oh, great, Markko -- you may as well just broadcast to Shaun and the entire world that something's up.",
        "Markko: I don't even know what's up. Langston, whatever secret you're keeping for Starr, it's not a secret anymore -- now that you sent Cole for her. So you might as well tell me what's going on, because it's hard to help you when I've got no clue what's really going on.",

        "Rex: You -- you don't really think Gigi and Adriana would fight over me?",
        "Roxy: Sure they would -- you're a prize, and they both know it, and so does Dorian.",
        "Rex: Dorian?",
        "Roxy: Yeah.",
        "Rex: You're kidding me -- and Gigi moved on from me in, like -- in, like, two weeks -- 10 years ago.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, you should've seen the look on Dorian's face when Gigi's kid said that both of them were invited to the wedding.",
        "Rex: That's because Dorian thinks she needs to know everything about the guest list, like, yesterday.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, I think she's entitled to get a headcount. And can I ask you something -- what the hell is wrong with you? You invite your ex and her kid without even asking Adriana first?",
        "Rex: Because I knew she wouldn't mind.",
        "Roxy: So it never occurred to you to mention that to Adriana?",
        "Rex: I -- I have, like -- like, five people on my side of the aisle, Roxy. Gigi and I are friends, and as usual, you're making something out of nothing.",
        "Roxy: I am? Well, it's something interesting, because Adriana came in and interrupted this meeting that I was having with Dorian, and she looked very, very worried.",
        "Rex: It's not Gigi.",
        "Roxy: Listen, don't --",
        "Rex: Love you --",
        "Roxy: You do anything to upset that sweet, rich -- sweet, really sweet woman of yours.",

        "Gigi: You want to throw me out? Well, I'm not losing my job because you don't think I should be talking to your fianc\u00e9.",
        "Adriana: You know, every time I leave the room, I find you talking to Rex.",
        "Gigi: That's not true.",
        "Adriana: How'd you get yourself invited to the wedding?",
        "Gigi: He just asked me out of the blue, Adriana -- I don't know.",
        "Adriana: Oh, that \"alone and vulnerable\" shtick is really working out for you -- you're living with Viki, working for the Buchanans, getting Marcie to baby-sit for you every time you need a little \"me time.\"",
        "Gigi: Rex is marrying you, he wants you -- what are you so damn insecure about?",
        "Adriana: I know Rex loves me as much as I love him, but I don't trust you.",
        "Gigi: What do you think I'm going to do, jump him? You don't have to worry about me!",
        "Adriana: I'll make sure I don't.",

        "Todd: That's a first.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Blair: You know, I was afraid that we couldn't fix this stuff with Starr, but I think it's going to be okay.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I think so, too.",
        "Blair: You know, I think she and Cole actually understand the situation, so maybe you could get the bodyguard to back off and she could have kind of a semi-normal life now.",
        "Todd: Is that why you let me have my way with you -- so you can work on me about Starr?",
        "Blair: Sweetie, I think that we can trust her that she's not going to get into any more trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Look, I'm sorry that I can't tell you, but I shouldn't have even told Cole where Starr was.",
        "Markko: Well, I don't know because you won't tell me, but you probably ended up helping her.",
        "Langston: I hope so.",
        "Markko: Look, I just -- I just want to know I don't have to worry about you.",
        "Langston: Why should you worry about me?",
        "Markko: Uh -- because last time we tried to cover for Starr, Mr. Manning wanted to kill us both.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, Dorian's not going to let anything happen to me or you.",
        "Markko: Didn't you say she's going out of town for a couple days?",
        "Langston: I'll be fine, don't worry, okay? Mr. Manning's not going to know what happened.",
        "Markko: I just hope that bodyguard keeps reading his paper -- it's a good thing he's such a sports nut.",
        "Langston: Look, I'm sorry I got you all mixed up in this, okay?",
        "Markko: Starr is my friend, too. Whatever she's doing, I just hope she's okay.",

        "Cole: Starr, I'm here!",
        "Receptionist: You got to leave now, or I'll have you arrested!",
        "Cole: Starr! Please, that is my girlfriend, all right? Can't you just go back there and tell her that I'm here?",
        "Receptionist: We've had people coming in here pretending to be relatives.",
        "Cole: I'm not pretending.",
        "Receptionist: People try and come and terrify our clients.",
        "Cole: I don't want to do that, all right, I -- I love her. Why can't you guys just help me out here?",
        "Receptionist: I'm calling 911.",

        "Sarah: Hey. The usual?",
        "Talia: No. I think I'm going to try something different like the, what -- house special?",
        "John: Make it two.",
        "Talia: Yeah. How was Napa?",
        "Sarah: Great.",

        "Sarah: So, a lot has happened in a couple of days.",
        "Talia: For you?",
        "Sarah: For you. Talia, John -- I -- I don't think that it was the best idea bringing John here.",
        "Talia: Right, we didn't know Antonio was going to be here.",
        "Sarah: But Cristian works here. He's here all the time.",
        "Talia: Well, Antonio broke up with me. I know that's probably not the way you heard it, but he did.",
        "Sarah: Look, Cristian isn't going to kick you guys out or anything, but you might want to think about going someplace else.",
        "Talia: We work with Antonio all day. If he can deal with it, I think you and Cristian can.",
        "Sarah: I'll be right back with your drinks. Have a great night.",
        "John: Somehow, I doubt the sincerity of that.",
        "Talia: Yeah, you don't have to live with her.",
        "John: Hey -- you sure you're okay with this?",
        "Talia: There's no going back now -- not that I want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Think I'd want to be with someone like that? I'm just glad I now know what she's really about. McBain can have her.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but he doesn't have to have her in your face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: What's going on is I'm a little upset with Gigi. I offered to lend her one of my dresses for the wedding and she turned me down.",
        "Rex: You did?",
        "Gigi: Oh, yeah -- flat.",
        "Adriana: She said she didn't want to impose, but we're having a formal wedding and I didn't want it to break Gigi's bank.",
        "Rex: You really should think about taking a dress, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Did you really mean it? I can take whatever I want?",
        "Adriana: Of course -- except my wedding dress.",
        "[Adriana and Rex chuckles]",
        "Rex: Great. Sounds like a plan.",
        "Adriana: Great! Well, why don't you two hurry up and get your work done and then you and I can talk dresses.",
        "Rex: Uh -- we're almost done.",
        "Adriana: Great. I'm just going to be, you know, over here doing some stuff. Don't mind me.",
        "Gigi: Oh, don't worry, we won't. Hmm.",

        "Todd: I thought I persuaded you to stay.",
        "Blair: I was tempted.",
        "Todd: But don't you own this place? Can't you set your own hours? How about no hours, zero hours?",
        "Blair: You know, I didn't --",
        "Todd: Never go in.",
        "Blair: Buy the place to let somebody else run it.",
        "Todd: But, you know, my last story's filed and Starr's gone and the boys are asleep. Let's do it, come on.",
        "Blair: You're just bored, that's all.",
        "Todd: No, I'm not. It's just --",
        "Blair: Duh, duh. You know what it is? I've got an idea.",
        "Todd: What's that?",
        "Blair: Why don't you take this rare opportunity to spend some one-on-one quality time with your daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How did you find me?",
        "Cole: It doesn't matter -- no one else knows, all right?",
        "Starr: Cole, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Cole: Well, I'm sorry you had to go through this alone. See, I knew something was wrong.",
        "Starr: I wanted to tell you, Cole. I really -- I really did. I just didn't want my dad to find out and -- please don't hate me for not telling you. Oh, Cole.",
        "Cole: Hey, I love you. I always will.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Cole: Am I too late? I'm not?",
        "Starr: Um -- I was just about to get an ultrasound. Will you wait out here for me? Thank you. Oh.",
        "Cole: Hey, wait.",

        "Gigi: Jared said if you have any more questions, just call Clint.",

        "Gigi: Hmm.",
        "Rex: Oh -- now I don't feel so bad I didn't get a chance to stop by after school to play catch with him. Oh -- yeah, Charlie told me he's going to Grandparents' Day at Shane's school, too?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Rex: That's really nice. He didn't mention the game to me.",
        "Gigi: Well, it was kind of last-minute. Shane got an A on his comic book project at school and Viki and Charlie wanted to reward him.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, I saw his comic book project, the -- the one where his dad is the superhero, right?",
        "Gigi: When did you see it?",
        "Adriana: Oh, I ran into him and Marcie. It's so sweet how proud Shane is of his dad -- you know, a man he's never met.",
        "Gigi: Well, I'm going to have to get back.",
        "Rex: Thanks, Gigi. Take care.",
        "Adriana: Did I say something wrong? I guess Gigi's still in love with Shane's father.",
        "Rex: Maybe she just doesn't want to talk about him.",
        "Adriana: How about we don't talk about Gigi anymore? How about we don't talk about anything?",

        "Antonio: Hey, Blair.",
        "Cristian: Great.",
        "Blair: Well, great of Sarah to cover for Vanessa, but you know what? I didn't budget for any break and whose paycheck am I going to put it on?",
        "Sarah: I heard that.",
        "Blair: Well, how lovely of you to grace us with your presence, Ms. Sarah.",
        "Sarah: Hey, if you'd rather I not fill in for Vanessa, I can leave. I'm sorry. I'm a little jetlagged.",
        "Blair: That's -- that's okay. I didn't mean for us to get off on the wrong foot. I'm very happy that you are covering for Vanessa. I'm very grateful. You are a tough act to follow, though.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, some people don't think so.",

        "Gigi: That's okay. Shane's at the Phillies' game with Viki and Charlie -- remember?",
        "Jared: Right, right, yeah, so I -- I hear you and Shane knew Charlie from Texas? Is that right?",
        "Gigi: Yes. We met him about the same time Viki did. He and Shane got along right from the start -- hmm. It was the first time that Shane's ever had anything like a dad in his life.",
        "Jared: Well, that's great.",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jared: Uh -- ahem. So did Rex understand all the info you brought him?",

        "Cole: Well, you made that decision pretty fast.",
        "Starr: Cole, this whole pregnancy thing -- it goes by really fast. I've already had morning sickness and I'm so tired all the time I can't even see straight and my body is changing in all these weird ways.",
        "Cole: All that already?",
        "Starr: Look, Cole, my mom's going to be able to find out and then she's going to tell my dad and then my dad is going to try to kill you. What are you thinking?",
        "Cole: Well, my mom said that having a baby is a woman's decision, and now it's happening to you.",
        "Starr: But?",
