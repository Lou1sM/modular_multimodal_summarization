Langston, Markko and Dorian all tell Lola she is a disgrace for attempting to seduce Markko. Cole has a drug counseling session with Rachel Gannon (Nora's daughter). She is ready to work with him and he trusts her. But right then, Lola enters the office to tell her she happens to know that Markko helped Cole falsify his drug test.

        "Marty: Nora.",
        "Nora: Just give me a second, will you?",
        "Marty: Well, what is this? You're not seriously charging John with Talia Sahid's murder, are you?",

        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: What's up?",
        "Bo: Please, sit down. I wanted to talk to you about this myself. Uh -- we've been able to keep it out of the press so far, but I don't know how long that's going to last.",
        "Cristian: Did something happen to Antonio?",
        "Bo: No. No, it's not Antonio, it's -- it's Talia. I'm sorry, Cristian. She was murdered last night at Dorian Lord's house.",

        "Dorian: Oh --",
        "Langston: I'm fine.",
        "Dorian: Oh. What is half of Llanview's police department doing outside?",
        "Langston: Well -- Markko stayed here last night.",
        "Markko: On the couch.",
        "Langston: Because you and Starr were staying at the hospital.",
        "Markko: And -- and we were both pretty upset about what happened.",
        "Dorian: What happened? What has been going on here?",
        "Ray: A woman was stabbed to death here last night, a police officer.",

        "Rachel: Hi, Cole. I'm Rachel, your new drug counselor.",
        "Cole: Hi.",
        "Rachel: And I understand your previous counselor removed himself from your case because of personal history with you.",
        "Cole: It was more like he got personal with someone else.",
        "Rachel: Do you have a problem with honesty?",
        "Cole: What? No.",
        "Rachel: Good, because for this to work, we have to be totally open and honest with each other. I'll start -- my full name is Rachel Gannon. I'm Nora Hanen's daughter and Matthew Buchanan's sister.",
        "Cole: I paralyzed your brother, and now I'm supposed to believe that you're on my side?",

        "Todd: You wouldn't happen to know Bo's password, would you?",
        "Viki: Todd, we need to talk.",
        "Todd: Probably not interested in the L.P.D. over at that dinosaur you guys call a newspaper, huh?",
        "Viki: What do you call \"The Sun\"?",
        "Todd: Uh, it's a contemporary information resource.",
        "Viki: I see.",
        "Todd: No, you don't, but you will soon enough. Oh, which reminds me -- check this out. It's pretty nice, huh?",
        "Viki: Fabulous.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it's the paper. Apparently people are interested in continuity. If they want to keep up on the times, they can log on to the new e-zine. You guys still printing \"The Banner\" on a Guttenberg press?",
        "Viki: Are you done with the lame jokes?",
        "Todd: Okay. What do you want?",
        "Viki: I want you to stop what you're doing to T\u00e9a Delgado.",

        "T\u00e9a: I'll do my best to convince her. She's pretty worried about you.",

        "[John sighs]",
        "John: There's nothing to tell.",
        "T\u00e9a: Then may I suggest you find something? Because the police have a very compelling case, and it winds up with you going down for murder.",

        "Layla: Okay. So if one shoe was under the bed, that means the other is \u0096",

        "Layla: Hey, it's me. I know you were working graveyard, but remember I told you I had a meeting with a really important buyer and you said that you promised you'd be home in time to walk the dog? Talia, if I am late because of you, I will absolutely kill you.",

        "Cristian: Talia's dead?",
        "Bo: I'm sorry, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: What, um -- how?",
        "Bo: I sent her there. I sent her to Dorian's. She was killed in the line of duty.",
        "Cristian: Does Antonio know?",
        "Bo: Yeah. He's on his way here now. See, I thought, though, that maybe you could talk to some people that -- that were close to Talia before this gets out in the media.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Do you honestly believe John would kill a woman he considers his friend?",
        "Nora: I never said that. Look, there is enough evidence that we had to charge him, and you heard what the mayor said -- we have to treat this like any other case.",
        "Marty: So you're going to try a man that you know is innocent?",
        "Nora: Sometimes bad things happen to innocent people.",
        "Marty: Nora, I'm -- I'm sorry. No, I -- please, tell me. How is Matthew doing?",
        "Nora: Not so good. He doesn't want anyone to see him in a wheelchair and he won't even talk to me or -- or Bo about it.",

        "Marty: Rachel?",

        "Cole: How -- how are you supposed to help me? I mean, you hate me, right?",
        "Rachel: How could I hate you? I don't know you.",
        "Cole: Well, you know what I did.",
        "Rachel: You hurt people you love by doing drugs, just like everyone else in this facility.",
        "Cole: They didn't almost kill someone.",
        "Rachel: You don't know that. Everyone has a story. I know I do. I'm a recovering addict, and now I help addicts recover.",
        "Cole: I'm not an addict.",
        "Rachel: Labels aren't important right now. What's important is that I think I can help you.",
        "Cole: Yeah? What -- what about your mom and Matthew?",
        "Rachel: This is between the two of us. I've got no problems working with you if you've got no problems working with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm not doing anything to T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "Viki: Please, will you stop with the innocent routine? It's not like I don't know you. You want T\u00e9a to tell the judge that Blair's marriage to John is a fraud.",
        "Todd: It is a fraud.",
        "Viki: And if T\u00e9a complies and you get custody of your children, you will agree to have a relationship with her?",
        "Todd: What do you give the defense attorney who's already got everything?",
        "Viki: Okay, that's disgusting.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: All right. What else did she tell you? Did she tell you she's in love with me?",
        "Viki: Well, as I recall, we discussed the size of your ego.",
        "Todd: What are you, her mother?",
        "Viki: She grew up without a mother, much as you did. And she has spent her whole life looking for something solid and stable.",
        "Todd: Well, then she's -- she's barking up the wrong publisher, isn't she?",
        "Viki: Maybe she could quit if you would leave her alone.",
        "Todd: Listen, I'm not messing with T\u00e9a's heart. She doesn't have a heart.",
        "Viki: Of course she does. For some unknown reason, she still has room in it for you. Don't use that to get back at John McBain.",
        "Todd: Well, he did take my kids.",
        "Viki: No, he didn't take your kids -- you lost your kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Not only do they have you for the murder of Talia Sahid, they have your partial print on the weapon used to stab Blair.",
        "Zach: What? That means they have to let me go!",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that --",
        "John: Yeah, Zach Rosen.",
        "Zach: You made everyone think I did it, and then you go out and gut someone when I'm locked up? Smart move.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "John: You want to know what the difference is? The difference is I didn't do anything to anybody.",
        "Zach: Me, either. I'm innocent.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ah. There's the small matter of assault with a deadly weapon, Zach.",
        "Zach: You looking for a new client?",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckling] Oh.",
        "Zach: Sorry, sweetheart -- I'm taken.",
        "T\u00e9a: I wish it were Zach. It was his ring they found on Talia's finger.",
        "John: Yeah, which I supposedly stole from the evidence room.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you had the opportunity and you were found with the body.",
        "John: Listen, I was trying to pull her out of the water because I thought I could save her.",
        "T\u00e9a: I understand that, but there were no witnesses.",
        "John: What do I get out of killing Talia? They don't have any motive.",
        "T\u00e9a: Actually, John, I'm afraid they do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Why would anybody kill that very attractive young police officer? And what was she doing here anyway?",
        "Ray: No one has told us anything.",
        "[Dorian scoffs]",
        "Dorian: John will know. Where is he?",
        "Langston: Well, I heard one of the cops say that he was at the police station.",
        "Dorian: It just occurred to me that two people have been stabbed since you came to live under this roof, Mr. Montes.",
        "Lola: He -- he was out to dinner with me.",
        "Ray: Lola and I decided to give Moe the night off since we were the only people at home.",
        "Dorian: Thank goodness Addie and the boys were at that amusement park. Did she say when she'd be back?",
        "Langston: Later today, I think.",
        "Dorian: I was going to go to LA. -- to be with David. Now, of course, I won't go because, well, with this lunatic on the loose -- oh.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Thank heaven you two girls weren't here.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Dorian: What's wrong?",
        "Langston: My cousin tried to steal my boyfriend -- that's what's wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: It's okay if you want a different counselor.",
        "Cole: I didn't say that.",
        "Rachel: But you're not sure. So I should help you make an informed decision. Here's what you need to know about me -- I grew up in Chicago, I love cats, and I have three rules.",
        "Cole: What are they?",
        "Rachel: I told you the first one -- total honesty. Two, total commitment. If we're both in the room, we both do the work. Maybe other people in your life have cut you slack, but I won't.",
        "Cole: And the third?",
        "Rachel: Follow the first two. So, what's it going to be? Are we in this together, or not?",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Cole: If I say no, they're just going to send me another counselor, right?",
        "Rachel: Yep.",
        "Cole: And the more counselors I have, the longer this is going to take.",
        "Rachel: True.",
        "Cole: Then, yes -- we're in this together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Thanks, Bo.",
        "Bo: I don't think I can hold the press off much longer.",
        "Nora: Oh, can't you just make a statement and not say anything about John?",
        "Bo: Yeah, but not without another suspect in custody.",
        "Marty: I -- I was there when this happened. How come I didn't see anything?",
        "Bo: Maybe somebody else did, you know? We just started canvassing the area.",
        "Nora: You know, someone will turn up. I -- I'm sure of it. I just don't see myself prosecuting John McBain.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Why the hell not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So now you're T\u00e9a's new best friend?",
        "Viki: I'm here out of concern for you as much as T\u00e9a.",
        "Todd: Really? Doesn't seem like it to me.",
        "Viki: You know, after everything that's happened, everything you've done, everything you've lost, is this really the man you want to be?",
        "Todd: I don't know. Why are my options? I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm trying to be there for my kids -- oh, but that's right. I can't see my kids, can I?",
        "Viki: There's got to be a better way to reverse that situation than to ensnare T\u00e9a in your web.",
        "Todd: Ensnare her in my web?",
        "Viki: Don't ask her for help anymore, not like this.",
        "Todd: Well, Viki, if you're here to defend T\u00e9a's honor, you're a bit late.",
        "Viki: What are you saying?",
        "Todd: I'm saying that --",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: We spent the night in the web, and it was T\u00e9a doing the ensnaring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You were a cop, John. You know how these cases are made.",
        "John: So what's my motive?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you broke out of prison and nearly killed Todd trying to save Marty, right?",
        "John: So, what, I'm -- I'm killing anyone that might hurt her? Lee, Wes?",
        "T\u00e9a: And Blair.",
        "John: I was with Marty when Blair was stabbed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Can anyone corroborate that? They'll say Marty was covering for you.",
        "John: How was Talia a threat to Marty?",
        "T\u00e9a: A smart D.A. can make it fit.",
        "John: Well, then it's a good thing Nora knows I didn't do this.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. If the mayor is pressuring her to make her case --",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: She won't be able to. I'm being framed -- and not by him.",
        "T\u00e9a: You have a theory?",
        "John: Yeah. You said the killer's trying to protect Marty, right? Well, I know someone that thought he was doing that, probably be real happy to see me out of the way.",
        "T\u00e9a: You mean Todd.",
        "John: You know, Talia was my friend and now I'm being accused of killing her.",
        "T\u00e9a: So maybe it was Todd.",
        "John: I don't know. What was he doing at Dorian's?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, he hated you for taking his kids away from him.",
        "John: So, what, you're saying he was there to kill me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Then Talia found him before he found you.",
        "John: I guess it's possible.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckling] Oh. It's not only possible, it's plausible.",
        "John: You know, you almost sound like you want Manning to be guilty.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm just trying to come up with an alternative theory of the crime -- part of my job, John.",
        "John: So how did you go from being his number one defender to wanting to see him fry?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So T\u00e9a manipulated you into having sex -- is that what you're saying?",
        "Todd: Your euphemism, not mine.",
        "Viki: And trading Blair's children for a night with you -- that was her idea?",
        "Todd: Oh, no, that was all me.",
        "Viki: Don't you see the power you still have over her? She deserves a lot better than to be hurt by you again.",
        "Todd: Hurt by me? Oh, no, no, no. She turned on me.",
        "Viki: She did?",
        "Todd: Absolutely. She had no intention of going to the judge.",
        "Viki: Oh!",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "Viki: You mean --",
        "Todd: Yes. She got me to sleep with her and then didn't hold up her end of the bargain.",
        "Viki: Ha.",
        "Todd: What do you think of her now?",
        "Viki: I think that's awesome. Good for her.",
        "Todd: God, I don't believe you. You'd take her side in this?",
        "Viki: Oh, she doesn't need me on her side. The playing field has been leveled.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Todd: Well, it's never going to happen again, I can tell you that.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's right. I don't care what she does. She can walk in here and give me a pouty look or wear a tight skirt or talk to me in that breathy voice -- I don't care.",
        "Viki: Oh, me think someone doth protest a little too much.",
        "Todd: Jeez. Is that the way you talk in your newspaper because I can tell why circulation is down.",
        "Viki: So T\u00e9a's not the only one with feelings?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Lola's been after Markko since the minute she got here.",
        "Dorian: How dare you, young lady!",
        "Lola: I didn't do anything!",
        "Dorian: We took you in as a guest --",
        "Markko: Oh, that is so not true!",
        "Ray: Hey, hey, please, let's just -- let's just talk to each other.",
        "Dorian: What's there to talk about? It is absolutely wrong to go after someone who's already spoken for.",
        "Lola: I didn't do that!",
        "Dorian: Oh? Then why do Markko and Langston both say you did?",
        "Ray: Lola didn't mean to do anything wrong, Dorian.",
        "Langston: Oh -- oh, so kissing Markko, rubbing herself all over him -- that's not wrong? Uh -- yeah!",
        "Lola: Okay, I liked Markko. But once I found out that he wanted to be with Langston, I totally backed off.",
        "Markko: Oh, yeah, right.",
        "Dorian: We took this girl into my house, she was our guest, and this is how she repays us?",
        "Ray: It's not a crime to make a mistake.",
        "Lola: Papi, I swear I did what you told me to do at the Buenos Dias Cafe. I swear.",
        "Dorian: And what was that, may I ask?",
        "Lola: I went into the kitchen and I told Markko that I didn't want to come in between him and Langston and that I valued my family too much to do that.",
        "Langston: Oh, my -- she's pathological!",
        "Dorian: Huh, clearly.",
        "Ray: No, no, that is exactly what I asked Lola to do. That -- that's exactly what I asked her to do. And she did that -- right, Markko? She did that.",
        "Markko: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. She did come into the kitchen, she told me she promised her dad she'd forget about me. And then she tried to make out with me.",

        "Cristian: Can I come in?",
        "Layla: Sarah doesn't live here anymore -- remember? After you dumped her, she moved out.",
        "Cristian: I have to tell you something.",
        "Layla: Look, I don't have any time to trade insults with you. I'm going to be late for a meeting because I have to walk C.V. You want to know why I changed his name to C.V. for \"Cristian Vega\"? Because all he does is ruin things.",
        "Cristian: Layla, listen --",
        "Layla: Gee -- no funny comeback? \"Wow, Layla. No wonder the only man you can get is a dog.\"",
