        "John suspects Natalie of pushing Marty down the stairs and Tea suspects Todd. Starr assures Cole that she will never let her father come between them. Langston is in a hotel room with Ford. Knowing that the room is registered to a well-known film director Alfonso Del Toro that he would love to meet, Markko pays the bellhop to let him take up the room service order. Langston goes to answer the door in her underwear, but modesty takes over so Ford answers the door instead. After Markko leaves, Langston yells at Ford and storms out.",
        "Nate and Dani get to know each other. Destiny wonders if Matthew is jealous of Nate. He says he isn't happy about Dani and Nate's kissing scenes in the play. Destiny reminds him that Dani will also have to see Matthew kissing Destiny in their scenes as Markko and Langston so they can make Dani jealous. He says it won't work because Dani already knows nothing is going to happen between them. Destiny concludes that Matthew thinks something is going to happen between Dani and Nate."

        "Natalie: John, I'm really sorry about your baby.",
        "John: Are you really?",
        "Natalie: Of course I am. Why would you even ask me that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Talk to me, Todd. We may not have much time.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: Did you push Marty Saybrooke down the stairs?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: \"Don't pretend you don't know what you did, Dad. Don't pretend it wasn't your fault. You put me in the hospital, put my boyfriend in the hospital. You crashed your car with my 2-year-old brother sitting in the front seat.\" Geez. \"I almost lost my baby! What kind of a father does those things?\" Good question. You're such a jerk, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I went to see my father.",
        "Cole: How'd that go?",
        "Starr: Who knows?",
        "Cole: Did you tell him to stay out of our lives?",
        "Starr: No, and I never will. What?",
        "Cole: That's exactly what Todd said, too. He said you always forgive him no matter what he does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Langston: Oh, no. Please. Let Se\u00f1ora del Toro get it.",
        "Ford: Ha ha! Uh, don't forget to sign your name...Alicia.",
        "Langston: Oh, don't worry. I'll make it a big dramatic scrawl nobody can read.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Markko: Alfonso. No, no, no. Mr. Del Toro. Oh, Senor, huge fan. Yeah, I'm a filmmaker, too. No. No. God, I'm an idiot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You're giving up?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Cole: Starr, if you give your dad that kind of power--",
        "Starr: I'm not giving him anything! You want me to tell him to stay out of our lives?",
        "Cole: Yes!",
        "Starr: Why? Do you think that that would work? Has it ever worked, Cole? Me telling him that would be like waving a red cape in front of him, okay? My dad's never gonna leave us alone.",
        "Cole: So he runs our lives?",
        "Starr: Those aren't our only 2 choices, okay? I told him off.",
        "Cole: What good does that do?",
        "Starr: I told him that I love you and that he can't talk to me about you and some girl, okay? He backed down.",
        "Cole: Really?",
        "Starr: Sort of.",
        "Cole: Starr, he won't give up. He's gonna make you choose between him and me.",

        "T\u00e9a: You really don't know what happened to Marty?",
        "Todd: No. What happened to Marty?",
        "T\u00e9a: She fell down the stairs at the hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Wasn't the...wasn't the baby in the way?",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "John: Marty told me what you said... that we'd be together if it wasn't for her getting pregnant.",
        "Natalie: God, John.",
        "John: Do you believe that? The only reason I'm with Marty is because of the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Special delivery. Mom's magic cookies. She and I made a double batch for your dad.",
        "Matthew: Thanks.",
        "Destiny: Where is he?",
        "Matthew: He's in physical therapy. My mom went with him to make sure he didn't push it.",
        "Destiny: So he's better, I mean, since he's on his feet and everything?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, he's getting there. He's got a goal now.",
        "Destiny: Oh, yeah?",
        "Matthew: He and my mom are getting married.",
        "Destiny: For real? That's good. Right?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it's great. I'm gonna be the best man.",
        "Destiny: Congratulations. It'll be a fun wedding. Your family knows how to do it.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, we get enough practice.",
        "Destiny: I liked the last one, once Miss Dorian was done with her drama. It was a fun time.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it was.",
        "Destiny: So are you gonna ask Dani to this wedding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: \"I almost lost my baby. I almost lost my baby! What kind of a father does that?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Langston: I can't open the door looking like this. Starr's sister lives here. What if she sees me?",
        "Ford: Just let the waiter in. Nobody will ever know you're here.",
        "Markko: I promise you, your steak is as well done as \"sangre de amores perros.\" That was a brilliant, brilliant film, and I sound like a total suck up. I hate me. Ah, okay. Mr. Del Toro, I'm just... Ford?",
        "Ford: Markko. What are you doing here?",
        "Markko: That's my question.",
        "Ford: This isn't what it looks like.",
        "Markko: Oh, sure it is. I know exactly what you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I won't do it. He can't make me choose. I told my dad he wouldn't like the consequences if he tried to force me.",
        "Cole: What does that mean?",
        "Starr: The truth? I don't even know. It sounds bad, right?",
        "Cole: I guess. I just don't want him to put you in that position.",
        "Starr: You can't change what he's going to do and he can't change the fact that I love you.",
        "Cole: Yeah, Starr, and I love you, too, all right? But I can't lie. Your dad is the hardest part of this relationship for me.",
        "Starr: Okay, and for me, too, because I do. I love him, but I know that he's never gonna make it easy and we're just gonna have to be the grownups here.",
        "Cole: Because Todd won't?",
        "Starr: Well, you definitely can't count on it. Hey, you know, I had rehearsals today and it made me realize that nothing can be worse than what we've already lived through. And we survived together. And you just have to know that my dad can't break this up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Is it serious?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know. I do know that she's in the emergency room and apparently she's pregnant...I think with John's baby. Did you know that, Todd?",
        "Todd: How did she manage to fall down some stairs? She doesn't seem clumsy to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, she doesn't seem clumsy.",
        "Todd: Probably just tripped over her own self-righteousness.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's not what she's saying happened. She's saying someone pushed her.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah? Who?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know, Todd. That's why I'm asking you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, okay? I know that you care about Marty--",
        "John: Did you tell Marty that we'd be together if it wasn't for the baby?",
        "Natalie: No, I didn't tell her. Brody and I were having a conversation and she overheard it.",
        "John: And then the two of you got into it.",
        "Natalie: I'm not proud of what I did.",
        "John: What happened?",
        "Natalie: It got ugly. You know how I get when my back's up against the wall.",
        "John: Yeah, I know.",
        "Natalie: And I--I said some things. I said some awful things that I shouldn't have said. And then Marty said some things. I mean, I felt horrible about it the second it was over. Just, you know how it is when you get into a fight. Words come out of your mouth that you just--you don't mean them.",
        "John: You wish the baby was gone?",
        "Natalie: No. No, I never, never said that. What I said... is that I wondered what might have been had Marty not gotten pregnant, but I never wished that your baby was dead. And I am really sorry that Marty lost the baby.",
        "John: Marty didn't lose the baby. She says she was pushed.",
        "Natalie: So Marty's sure that she was pushed?",
        "John: Yeah, she's pretty clear about what happened.",
        "Natalie: Did she see the person who pushed her?",
        "John: No.",
        "Natalie: Well, then, how does she know?",
        "John: She heard someone come into the stairwell behind her, and then she felt a shove from behind.",
        "Natalie: Oh.",
        "John: When I found Marty at the bottom of the stairs, I looked up and I saw you standing there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: That's great. So Marty gets tossed down a flight of stairs, and I'm the first suspect.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, you are.",
        "Todd: That's perfect.",
        "T\u00e9a: You were there. I saw you, remember? You and Marty had just gotten in a big fight.",
        "Todd: Yeah, so what?",
        "T\u00e9a: So what? So this is the first time in all the years I've known you, Todd, that you ever told me that you wanted Marty dead. So she takes a header down some stairs, I'm gonna have a few questions.",
        "Todd: You think I did it, don't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't say that.",
        "Todd: You don't have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Hey, Nate.",
        "Nate: Hey.",
        "Dani: How did you find me?",
        "Nate: Contact sheet for the play.",
        "Dani: What are you doing here?",
        "Nate: I need to rehearse with a person. Working by myself alone in a room doesn't cut it.",
        "Dani: Tell me about it. I just spent the last half-hour yelling at myself in the mirror.",
        "Nate: Whoa. Maybe you should yell at me instead.",
        "Dani: Oh, no, well, those were all the other scenes with the dad.",
        "Nate: Oh. Can I come in?",
        "Dani: Right. Sorry. Way rude. Yeah. Come in. Welcome to my generic substitute for a home.",
        "Nate: So this isn't where you live?",
        "Dani: Well, it is for now. But no, we're just sort of new to town.",
        "Nate: Me, too. Where are you from?",
        "Dani: Tahiti, but my last school was in London.",
        "Nate: Lots of good theater there.",
        "Dani: Not like I saw any of it. I got so many demerits, I was about to be on lockdown.",
        "Nate: Ooh, that's brutal.",
        "Dani: Oh, like you can't believe. I busted out.",
        "Nate: Literally?",
        "Dani: Yeah, literally. With Matthew. We escaped together.",
        "Nate: Then it is true.",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Nate: He really is your boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: These cookies look good.",
        "Destiny: Try one.",
        "Matthew: They're for my dad.",
        "Destiny: It's a double batch. There's plenty. And like my mom says, it'll cure what ails you.",
        "Matthew: I'm not sick.",
        "Destiny: Well, something's bugging you.",
        "Matthew: Nah.",
        "Destiny: I saw you at rehearsal.",
        "Matthew: I'm just freaking out because I don't know my lines.",
        "Destiny: And they're written on Nate Salinger's forehead. That's where you're staring the whole time.",
        "Matthew: Okay, I was just trying to remember my blocking, and he just always seemed to get in the way.",
        "Destiny: Looked to me like he was always next to Dani. Are you jealous of Nate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Del Toro isn't here, is he? And you're using his room.",
        "Ford: Well, it was already paid for.",
        "Markko: Is he coming at all?",
        "Ford: Sure. He'll be here to teach the seminar tomorrow, no problem. But what's the deal? You working here now, too?",
        "Markko: No, just one night only. I was in the restaurant talking to the owner about booking a hotel room for prom night and I overheard the maitre d' taking the order, and I paid off the bellboy to let me bring it up.",
        "Ford: Trying to get some face time in with the man, huh?",
        "Markko: I figured it couldn't hurt. Maybe get him to take a look at my reel.",
        "Ford: Listen, I'm taking del Toro around tomorrow. Maybe I can arrange for a couple minutes.",
        "Markko: Could you do that?",
        "Ford: Yeah, I can try. I mean, I can at least put in a good word for you.",
        "Markko: Oh, thanks, man.",
        "Ford: Why don't you--why don't you come on in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You want me to trust your dad? Seriously?",
        "Starr: No, I want you to trust that whatever he tries won't work.",
        "Cole: Starr, the guy hates me. He'll use whatever he can. He'll make stuff up if he has to, like that thing with Hannah.",
        "Starr: I didn't believe that.",
        "Cole: This time.",
        "Starr: Or ever!",
        "Cole: Okay, but promise me. Promise me that you know that I don't want anyone but you.",
        "Starr: I know that. Why wouldn't I know that?",
        "Cole: I don't know. It's just like there's, like, something in the air or something. Like the thing with Langston just made me think. All right, and then your dad in your ear telling you not to trust me.",
        "Starr: Okay, that's just the way that he is. You cannot let him get to you. I promise I won't let him get to me. Okay? We can handle whatever he throws at us, okay? Okay?",
        "Cole: Yeah, okay.",
        "Starr: Believe in us, Cole.",
        "Cole: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, I never said I thought you had pushed--",
        "Todd: Then what are you saying?",
        "T\u00e9a: Marty down the stairs. I am asking you.",
        "Todd: Really? I can't tell the difference.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, maybe you need to listen more closely.",
        "Todd: You do. You do think I did this, don't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I do suspect you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Aw, man, I'm starving. Why don't you come on in and set it up since you're playing bellboy?",
        "Markko: Yeah, you need help with this spread. You must be eating for 3, man.",
        "Ford: Yeah, worked up quite an appetite.",
        "Markko: Well, wait till you see what the lobsters run. Or is this on LU's tab, too?",
        "Ford: Well, del Toro is known for his appetites. It's all part of his plan. The school was happy to spring for it.",
        "Markko: Whatever. It's your business.",
        "Ford: Hey, you know, I hear del Toro tips big, too.",
        "Markko: Great. Well, add it to the bill and it'll go to the real bellboy. Are you seriously gonna eat all this food?",
        "Ford: Not by myself.",
        "Markko: You have someone here.",
        "Ford: Why, nothing gets by you, does it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Ha ha! Mmm. Where's Markko?",
        "Cole: Gone.",
        "Starr: Yeah? Till when?",
        "Cole: About an hour.",
        "Starr: Really?",
        "Cole: Langston?",
        "Starr: She's supposed to be working on the musical with Mr. G until late. What about Hope? Oh!",
        "Cole: Asleep.",
        "Starr: Yeah?",
        "Cole: Down for the count.",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh! So we're actually alone? Wow!",
        "Cole: Real quick.",
        "Starr: We don't know the next time this is gonna happen.",
        "Cole: I love you, Starr Manning.",
        "Starr: I love you, Cole Thornhart. Ha ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Okay, I'm not happy about how much Dani and Nate are gonna be kissing.",
        "Destiny: They do a lot more than that.",
        "Matthew: Thanks for the help.",
        "Destiny: I'm just saying you better get used to it. I mean, it'll be hard for Dani, too.",
        "Matthew: Working with that pretentiously tall actor.",
        "Destiny: She'll have to watch you and me kissing. Langston and Markko have some scenes where they can't keep their hands off each other.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Destiny: And we're gonna have to practice. You just get ready. I'm gonna make Miss Dani jealous.",
        "Matthew: No, we won't.",
        "Destiny: Why not?",
        "Matthew: Because she knows that we're just friends. Nothing's gonna happen between us.",
        "Destiny: But you think something's gonna happen between Nate and Dani.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Did Matthew say he was my boyfriend?",
        "Nate: He said you were kind of together.",
        "Dani: Oh, well, yeah, I guess that's--I mean, yeah, we're together. We're really close.",
        "Nate: Seems like a decent guy.",
        "Dani: Oh, he is. I like him a lot.",
        "Nate: Sounds like you're good friends.",
        "Dani: Well, I mean, it's kind of more. I sound so lame. It's just I don't get the whole boyfriend/girlfriend thing.",
        "Nate: It's an outdated concept.",
        "Dani: Is that it? I just figured I had, like, the worst role models ever. I mean, I know it works for some people, but--",
        "Nate: But not for your friends?",
        "Dani: No, my parents. I spent my whole life thinking that everything was all perfect, and then last year it just blows up. My mom didn't really love my dad, and he wasn't even my dad. And now there's this other guy who supposedly she's madly in love with, only he's psycho Todd Manning. So how, right? How do you love someone like that?",
        "[Opens pop can]",
        "Nate: I guess it just happens.",
        "Dani: Yeah, well, I can't see it, so basically I have no idea what love looks like. But you probably didn't want to know absolutely every embarrassing detail about me. Sorry.",
        "Nate: My parents are a nightmare, too.",
        "Dani: Worse than my dad?",
        "Nate: Truth? No. I mean, my father's bad, but he's nothing like Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You really think I would toss a pregnant woman down a flight of stairs?",
        "T\u00e9a: You did the same exact thing to your own pregnant daughter.",
        "Todd: That was an accident.",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe this thing with Marty was an accident, too.",
        "Todd: Get the hell out of my office.",
        "T\u00e9a: No.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry. No?",
        "T\u00e9a: Who exactly do you think you're tossing out of here?",
        "Todd: My miserable ex-wife, that's who. Who obviously doesn't believe in me anymore, who probably poisons my own daughter against me!",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine! Not true, but fine. Throw her out. But you need your lawyer. And last I checked, that was still me. So if you want to stay ahead of this thing, you got to let me help you.",
        "Todd: Help me? Why do I need help?",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha! I know what you're capable of, Todd. Okay? I know what you did to Marty in the past, and I saw the state you were in at the hospital.",
        "Todd: Yeah, Cole is cheating on my daughter. What state do you think I ought to be in?",
        "T\u00e9a: Angry!",
        "Todd: That's right! And I blew off some steam with Marty. That's it!",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you sure? Because if that baby dies, then the person who pushed Marty will be accused of murder. So tell your lawyer, Todd, in confidence. Did you push Marty down the stairs?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Yes, I was at the top of the stairs when you found Marty.",
        "John: Great. I don't know how long Marty had been there. Do you know how long you were there?",
        "Natalie: Couple of seconds. I just walked out the door.",
        "John: Did you see anyone?",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "John: What about outside Marty's office? Marty told me she saw you outside her office.",
        "Natalie: That's right.",
        "John: Now I'm trying to put together a timeline here. You want to help me out?",
        "Natalie: You don't need help. You've already got this figured out. This is your good cop routine.",
        "John: No, this is no routine.",
        "Natalie: Say it. Stop with the leading questions. We both know exactly what you think.",
        "John: Yeah, what's that?",
        "Natalie: Just say it, John. I blamed Marty's pregnancy for losing you. And then a few hours later, Marty's baby is dead. So stop wasting time. Just ask me the question. Ask me if I pushed Marty down the stairs.",
        "John: Okay. Did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What are you thinking?",
        "Starr: English lit final.",
        "Cole: Sociology paper.",
        "Starr: We are so boring.",

        "Cole: This doesn't sound good.",
        "Starr: I know that we live together and that we're boring parents, but will you take me to my senior prom?",
        "Cole: I would love to.",
        "Starr: You would? Hey, I promise, no cheesy limos or anything, okay? We're just going to have a nice, normal night.",
        "Cole: Well, our first one didn't happen because your dad wouldn't let it.",
        "Starr: Okay, which is not going to happen again.",
        "Cole: Mm-hmm. And the last one we thought our baby was dead.",
        "Starr: It would be a very big accomplishment if we had a normal night.",

        "Dani: Oh, um, I don't know. I guess we could just make it up.",
        "Nate: So maybe your cheek? It's classic.",
        "Dani: Yeah, or maybe the forehead.",
        "Nate: Yeah, but then I block your face. If I use my upstage hand, that works.",
        "Dani: Yeah.",

        "Markko: Yeah, it was. Best night of my life. You know, I want to make this year even better for her.",

        "Natalie: Yes. Yes, I have. In fact, this morning I got into a really stupid argument and said some horrible things that I felt really bad about, so I decided to drive all the way over here to the hospital to make it right. That's what I was doing here. I tried to talk to Marty. She shoved past me, and the next time I found her, she was lying at the bottom of the stairs. I didn't come here to fight, John. I came here to apologize.",

There is a difference! There's a huge difference of saying mean things sometimes and pushing a pregnant woman down a flight of stairs so I could get with some guy! So you want some answers? Here are the answers. I came to the hospital so I could tell Marty that I was sorry. She blew me off, I followed her, and the next time I saw her, she was lying at the bottom of the stairs.",
