        "Tate: No.",
        "Adriana: Not even a tiny bit?",
        "Tate: It's a nationally televised show. I would be lying if I said not at all.",
        "Adriana: You're going to do great. I know it.",
        "Tate: Well, thanks. Still, I feel like I can use a little something for luck, you know?",
        "Adriana: Sorry, I didn't know I was supposed to bring a rabbit's foot or four- leaf clover.",
        "Tate: Yeah. No, I was thinking something more along these lines.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Yo, Adriana, update, since you haven't called me back. I'm heading down to the front desk to make sure that Blair and Todd checked out and haven't found out anything. Creek, no paddle for life as we know it if they find out that Todd's son is Tommy McBain. Hopefully, they're halfway back to Llanview by now. Call me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I tell you, I'm not leaving here empty-handed.",
        "Blair: Well, I don't think we have a choice here. The adoption agency -- they're not going to let you look at the records.",
        "Todd: I'm not just going to roll over because the legal system doesn't want to help me.",
        "Blair: What are you planning?",
        "Todd: I don't know yet. But I've never let the law stop me before. And this time, it's my son we're talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: When you say \"late,\" you mean, like, for an appointment, right?",
        "Evangeline: You know exactly what I mean, Layla. I'm late. I think I might be pregnant.",
        "Layla: If you -- who? Todd? Oh -- God -- or -- or Cristian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I asked you a question. What are you doing here?",
        "Nash: I'm standing here staring at your ugly mug. What are you doing here?",
        "Cristian: Very funny, smart-ass.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: I thought you were leaving town and not coming back.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I was, but hit a bump in the road. Plans changed.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah?",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cristian: What plans are those?",
        "Nash: Well, I might leave town. I might. But let's put it this way -- if I do, it won't be alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Sweetie, do you mind going and playing in your room for a second while me and your daddy, talk? Ok?",
        "Antonio: No. Jamie, stay. You said that you -- that Jessica said she was sorry for leaving the courtroom? Yeah? And that she said she was sorry about kissing somebody? What did you mean by that, honey? Who was she kissing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Cole Thornhart, you are up next. But give me a minute, because I need to make sure that the karaoke machine is cued up, ok?",
        "Cole: You sure about this?",
        "Starr: Cole -- it's not like we're going to fall in love again.",
        "Cole: Ok --",
        "Starr: It would be like we're in the same class.",
        "Cole: Ok, ok, let's just say hypothetically that we both happen to land the lead part and had to fall in love.",
        "Starr: Whatever -- you know what? Anyway, it -- it wouldn't matter.",
        "Langston: Britney, leave them alone.",
        "Britney: Or what, Leonard? You going to scratch my eyes out?",
        "Langston: No, I'm going to tell Ms. McBain how you bought your last two essays off the internet.",
        "Britney: Fine. Let them talk. It's as close as they're going to get anyway.",
        "Cole: Starr, you're totally going to get the lead part. I mean, you have a killer voice.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? I sucked at the audition. I'd be lucky to get in the chorus. But you're going to get a great part.",
        "Cole: How do you know that? You've never heard me sing.",
        "Starr: Yes, I have.",
        "Cole: When?",
        "Starr: After school, before we were going out -- um -- you were sitting on the wall near the field, and you were listening to your mp3.",
        "Cole: And I -- and I was singing? Like, out loud?",
        "Starr: Yeah, kind of really loud.",
        "Cole: Oh.",
        "Starr: No, it was -- it was really good. You were awesome, and good luck.",
        "Marcie: Starr Manning, you don't need to stick around, ok? I -- I have seen everything from you that I need to see.",
        "Starr: Was I really that bad?",
        "Marcie: No, you weren't bad. You were amazing. Are you kidding? Starr, you sent chills up my spine. You really can sing. Now come on, get out of here.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: You're welcome. Are you ready, Cole?",
        "Cole: Yes, ma'am.",

        "Starr: You did all this to get me and Cole back together.",
        "Langston: So?",
        "Starr: Langston, you know that we're not supposed to be together.",
        "Langston: One day, you'll bow down and thank me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Did you enjoy your night in jail so much you asked for an extended stay?",
        "Todd: No, that's not going to happen.",
        "Blair: We're getting kicked out of Chicago, Todd. I mean, this town is huge, and we are getting kicked out.",
        "Todd: Then I'll have someone else get the files.",
        "Blair: Oh, now, that's -- that's a great idea. Have somebody else do it, they'll get arrested. They'll turn you in for doing it. That -- that's brilliant.",
        "Todd: No one's going to get caught here.",
        "Blair: Really? You sound sure of yourself, Todd. You know, something could go wrong, and you will be the one that gets arrested, and not only will you lose your chance to look for the son that you lost, you are going to lose jack and Starr because you'll be off at Riker's Island.",
        "Todd: Hmm. Joliet.",
        "Blair: The point I am making is that the adoption agency has closed the records. The adoptive parents have rights, Todd, and those rights don't include anyone, including the biological father, to know who they are.",
        "Todd: That's why they invented lawyers.",
        "Layla: Vange, you have to tell me. Who's the dad?",
        "Evangeline: What?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Evangeline: Hello?",
        "Todd: Hey, Evangeline, I'm glad I caught you.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, hey. How's everything going in Chicago?",
        "Todd: Ah, it sucks. I found an adoption agency, but they won't let me see their records. They gave me some lame reason about adoptive parents' rights.",
        "Evangeline: Well, the law's fairly nebulous about that. It depends on the particular state.",
        "Todd: You know, it doesn't seem to me that it should matter how nebulous it is or what state you're in. My -- my son was kidnapped. And as far as I know, that's -- that's a crime in every state. There's got to be some way to get those records opened.",
        "Evangeline: I'll look into it for you.",
        "Todd: Ok, good. Hey, I really want to -- I really want to talk to you when I get back.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. I have some important things to talk to you about, too. What?",
        "Layla: Todd -- it's Todd's baby.",
        "Evangeline: Layla, will you stop jumping to conclusions? My God -- the important thing I want to talk to Todd about is why he didn't just tell me he's going to Chicago with Blair. I mean, he should have been honest with me about that.",
        "Layla: So the baby -- it's --",
        "Evangeline: If I am pregnant, the baby would be Cristian's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm guessing you mean you're not leaving without your daughter, which means we're stuck with you here in Llanview.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: But hear me when I say this, man. If you stay here, your life's going to be a living hell, because Antonio's on to you. I told him what's going on.",
        "Nash: Did you, now?",
        "Cristian: Yes, I did. I told him you had the hots for Jessica, and I got this close to telling him how far you've gone.",
        "Nash: How fait go?",
        "Cristian: Come on, Nash. I heard you telling Layla how you feel about Jessica.",
        "Nash: Is that a crime?",
        "Cristian: Well, maybe not a crime, but when you're talking about another guy's wife, you could be facing something like the death penalty.",
        "Nash: Oh, I -- yea no. I don't think Antonio will kill me.",
        "Cristian: Don't forget, Nash, I know what you and Jessica were doing in that storage room the night of the fire. And if Antonio and I hadn't been interrupted, I would have told him everything.",
        "Nash: Well, aren't you just a know-it-all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jamie: I know you love me, and Jessica loves Bree.",
        "Antonio: Right. So you think because Jessica kisses and hugs Bree and treats her differently, that she loves her more than she loves you?",
        "Jamie: I don't know.",
        "Jessica: Jamie -- you love your dad, and you love your grandpa and your grandma, and you love Bree, right? You can love more than one person at the same time. Ok?",
        "Antonio: Honey? Come here, sit down. Look, I -- I know it's been a rough couple of days. Well, you know, you can ask me anything, anything at all, and -- and I will give you an honest answer, all right? I mean, you can talk to me about your feelings, and -- you can just -- you can ask me anything, all right? I'm your man. [Phone rings] It's Bo, and I have to talk to him, ok? I'm going to step outside for a second, all right? And then I'm going to come back in and you and I are going to finish this conversation. All right? Ok.",
        "[Ring]",
        "Jessica: Are you ok, Jamie?",
        "Jamie: Jessica, do you love Nash more than you love Papi?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I think you should've went for the rabbit's foot.",
        "Tate: Oh, no. We all have different good-luck charms, and that was mine. This is a big deal for me, Adriana.",
        "Woman: Stand by, Mr. Harmon, you're almost up.",
        "[\"The View\" theme plays]",
        "Joy: Our next guest is a former major league pitcher.",
        "Elisabeth: He probably had a great career ahead of him if it hadn't have been for a shoulder injury.",
        "Joy: He might still have a great career ahead of him. Have you seen him in his underwear?",
        "Elisabeth: No -- obviously, you have.",
        "Joy: Oh, my God. You mean to tell me they do nothing for -- [Cheers] Look at this. That does nothing?",
        "Elisabeth: I'll leave that up to the audience -- ladies?",
        "Joy: Ok. [Cheers and applause] Well, the audience sure likes it.",
        "Elisabeth: Well, guess what -- it's your lucky day, ladies, because he is here in the flesh.",
        "Joy: Ok, then! Bring out the flesh.",
        "Elisabeth: Here he is. Please welcome Tate Harmon.",
        "Adriana: Tate, I really --",
        "Woman: You're on.",
        "Tate: Thank you. Well, I guess there's only time one last good-luck kiss, huh?",
        "Adriana: Go. Go!",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Joy: Maybe -- maybe he's back there stripping.",
        "Elisabeth: Joy? I'm sure that's not the case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Um -- I don't know any show tunes, so is it ok if I just sing a song I like?",
        "Marc: Yeah, of course.",
        "Cole: And I don't really know the lyrics too well, so --",
        "Marcie: It's fine. Whenever you're ready.",
        "Cole: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Cole: The time has come and it's just right we know how we feel inside let's accept our jaded house believe love is here to set us free and sometimes you just need to say yeah no matter how the rest portray, yeah but fields don't feed me rivers, no, man and a promise made that can't be broken we'll make 'em stare at us with envy make 'em sink with jealousy make 'em swear they can't be true make 'em want to be me and you we'll make 'em want to be me and you is that enough?",
        "Marcie: Yes, it's plenty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It is possible to love more than one person at the same time, right? Well, I love your daddy. I really do. I really do. He is a wonderful man. You know what? You're really, really lucky to have a daddy like him. He's wonderful. And you know what, sweetie? He's really, really lucky to have an amazing daughter like you. And I love you so much. Do you want to go in your room and play for a little bit? Ok. Bye, sweetie.",
        "Antonio: Where's Jamie?",
        "Jessica: Um -- I just asked her to go into her room and play for a little bit. Antonio, I was just letting her know how special she was.",
        "Antonio: Oh. All right. How special do you think she felt when you told her you couldn't adopt her?",
        "Jessica: You know, sooner or later, you're going to have to listen to what I have to say, because it's really important.",
        "Antonio: Oh. Oh, you have an explanation for breaking her heart? Huh. Well, I'd love to hear it. Go ahead. Go ahead, the floor is all yours.",
        "Jessica: Jamie already lost one mother, and I couldn't bear to put her through that again. So I couldn't adopt her now only to leave her later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm not giving up.",
        "Blair: Todd, what if it's Spencer, you know -- playing another one of his sick games with you?",
        "Todd: Oh, he's getting to me from the grave, is that it?",
        "Blair: Yeah. What if he is? I mean, what if he sent you on this wild-goose chase to Chicago to an adoption agency that's not going to give you the information that you need? You're not going to find anything out, knowing that it would make you crazy, and it has. It has made you completely --",
        "Todd: I don't think you want me to find him.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: I think you're still pissed at me. I think you still blame me for losing the son we were supposed to have together.",
        "Blair: How can you say that to me? I came here to help you, Todd. And no matter what has happened between us, I never thought that you deserved to lose your son.",
        "Todd: That's what it seemed like to me.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? You're wrong. I got on that plane to be with you, to help you, because I wanted to see this through to the end, and if you think that I came to Chicago to knock your knees out from under you, then you can go straight to hell.",
        "Todd: So can you. I'm going downstairs to wait for the car.",
        "Blair: Fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Adriana, me again. Todd paid his bill and has a car coming for him, so obviously, he hasn't found out anything yet.",
        "Todd: Hey. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Tate: Hi.",
        "Elisabeth: How are you?",
        "Joy: Tate -- Tate! I don't know -- you know, I have to tell you, you don't know how many women you've disappointed coming out here fully dressed like that.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Tate: Oh! Sorry, ladies, but I'm saving myself up for the next shoot.",
        "Joy: Yeah. Audience: Oh.",
        "Joy: Oh.",
        "Elisabeth: Oh.",
        "Joy: But you know what? We go right for the jugular on this show, so -- are you seeing anybody?",
        "Tate: That depends on what you mean by \"seeing.\"",
        "Joy: Well --",
        "Elisabeth: Is there someone special in your life?",

        "Todd: I told you I didn't want you here.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you sure did.",
        "Todd: And you said you were so convinced that my son was dead.",
        "Rex: That's what I said because that's what I believe. The death certificate is real.",
        "Blair: Ok, Rex, I'm going to ask you again -- what are you doing here?",
        "Rex: Look, I came here to help Todd.",
        "Blair: Oh, none of this makes any sense.",
        "Todd: Not making sense is Rex's forte.",
        "Rex: Just listen. If there is even the tiniest chance that your son is still alive, I would not be able to live with myself knowing that I screwed things up. I came to Chicago out for myself. Maybe miles was telling the truth. Maybe he wasn't. Maybe he just thought he was telling the truth. I'm here to find out.",
        "Todd: And what did you find out?",
        "Rex: Nothing. I -- I just got here. Have you found out anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: How can you be so sure it's not Todd's?",
        "Evangeline: You figure it out.",
        "Layla: You didn't do it with him?",
        "Evangeline: Give the girl a prize.",
        "Layla: Oh, thank you. Girl, come here. Come here. That is such a relief, because you know how I feel about you and Todd together. It just would not be right. So it's Cristian's?",
        "Evangeline: Yes.",
        "Layla: You haven't been with him in a long time. How long has it been since you had your period?",
        "Evangeline: I mean, you know, I'm really irregular. So I haven't really though about it until now, and I'm -- I'm starting to get worried.",
        "Layla: I know my sister, and my sister is always careful.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I am always careful. But there was this one time --",
        "Layla: Girl, all it takes is one time.",
        "Evangeline: I know. And afterwards -- I mean, Cristian and I were so in love that we weren't even scared. We were, like, laying there dreaming about what it would be like to have a baby together. But we weren't ready then, and we sure as hell aren't ready now.",
        "Layla: So? What are you going to do about it?",
        "Evangeline: I don't know.",
        "Layla: Come here. I do. Why don't you let your little sister give you some advice, for on? Vange, you have to tell him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I may not know it all, but I do know that you and Jess have been sneaking around behind my brother's back.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Now we're done with the sneaking around. We're not going to do that anymore.",
        "Cristian: Go because if I ever find o that the two of you are hiding anything from my brother, I'm going to go straight to him and tell him.",
        "Nash: You don't got to do that.",
        "Cristian: Don't mess with me, Nash.",
        "Nash: You don't have to do that, because Jessica is telling him now.",
        "Cristian: What is Jessica telling him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I ran out of the adoption hearing so I -- I wouldn't hurt her even more down the road.",
        "Antonio: Oh. You know, I -- I keep hearing that, but it's -- it's just not making any sense. So you said you abandoned Jamie for her own sake? You know, I -- I -- I don't think she understands that, and frankly, I don't, either.",
        "Jessica: Ok, then please listen, and I will explain.",
        "Antonio: Sure. Sure -- go ahead and explain to me how you're so sure that you're going to leave my daughter.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, I --",
        "Antonio: What -- what is it, honey? Is -- I mean, is it Tess? Are you afraid that she's going to come back out, you're going to run away, and you're going to leave Jamie without a mother?",
        "Jessica: No, she has nothing to do with this. Well, maybe -- I guess she does, but I --",
        "Antonio: Damn it, Jessica, I am -- you know what? It has been a long couple of days, and I have been as patient as I can possibly be. But right now, I need you to look me in the eye and tell me what the hell is going on.",
