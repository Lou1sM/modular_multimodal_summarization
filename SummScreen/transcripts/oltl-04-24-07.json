        "Todd: Ms. Bromley, the only thing I have of this kid is a blanket. That's it. I have never seen him. I was told that he drowned, actually, so I don't know how I could ever prove to you that I'm his father. Do you?",
        "Ms. Bromley: I don't know.",

        "Ms. Bromley: You were adopted?",
        "Blair: Well, not -- I actually wasn't that lucky. I just went from foster home to foster home. The Gerber Agency never actually placed me.",
        "Ms. Bromley: Gerber?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ms. Bromley: They were the most disreputable agency I've ever come across.",
        "Blair: Well, then you know what I'm talking about. They didn't care about us, no matter how neglected or abused we were.",
        "Ms. Bromley: You poor thing. You'll be glad to know a federal investigation closed them down years ago.",
        "Blair: Well, good. Good. Then no other child can suffer because of them. That's great.",
        "Ms. Bromley: That's why I'm so careful about our children.",
        "Blair: Ms. Bromley, a child placed in their own home with their parents that both love them and want them -- that's the best place for a child, and Todd here -- it's killing him not to know where his son is, a son that was taken from him. That was wrong. Wrong. And you know what? We can make it right. Please, Ms. Bromley -- please, just -- will you help us?",

        "Michael: She needs another line. Get me that 16 gauge.",
        "Paige: what's going on?",
        "Michael: A car accident. Unconscious. Possible severe head trauma.",
        "Paige: Any sign of edema?",
        "Michael: She has a contusion here, and swelling here. Get trauma one ready.",
        "Antonio: What is wrong with her? What is wrong?",
        "Michael: She is going to be ok, Antonio. I promise you. We need to move her, now.",
        "Paige: Let's go.",
        "Jessica: No, I'm sorry, Antonio, you have to stay.",

        "Tate: How mad are you?",
        "Adriana: Tate, if it was just you doing cartwheels around the stage like a nut job, that would have been bad enough, but it wasn't just you! You paraded me around on national television like I was your trophy girlfriend!",
        "Tate: So why didn't you just tell people the truth?",
        "Adriana: Don't even try blaming this on me. I am not the one that just put us on the front page of \"The Sun\" tomorrow.",
        "Tate: And is that such a bad thing?",
        "Adriana: Yes! Yes, it is. When I have a boyfriend, it is.",
        "Tate: Well, just think of all the free publicity exposed is going to get out of this.",
        "Adriana: So that's what this was? It was a publicity stunt?",
        "Tate: Call Layla right now. I bet you can't even get through because the phone lines are jammed with people wanting your underwear.",
        "Adriana: Either you really don't care about me at all, or you're lying through your bleached teeth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I have your attention? Look, before you guys leave, I just -- I want to say thank you for coming out, you know? For giving it your all. I really appreciate it. You guys have so much talent, and I -- I just think it's going to be a shame, you know, that the rest of the school's not going to be able to see it, so -- well, that's it. That's all I wanted to say. Thanks. Unless -- you know, unless you think you're capable of rising to the occasion. I mean, that is, if you are up to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ms. Bromley: You seem like a good person, Ms. Cramer. I perform a lot of background checks. I can tell.",
        "Blair: Oh. Well, thank you, and -- and we appreciate your concern for the children.",
        "Ms. Bromley: And you understand why I must be sure Mr. Manning is the child's father.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no -- we understand, I understand. You do, too, don't you, Todd?",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah -- so now that we got that out of the way, where the hell is my kid?",

        "Antonio: How did this happen? How the hell did this happen? How could I let something like this happen to my little girl?",
        "Cristian: You didn't have anything to do with this.",
        "Antonio: I'm supposed to protect her, damn it. What if she --",
        "Jessica: No, don't. Don't. Don't do that, ok? She's strong. She's strong, just like you, and she's going to be ok. We have to start believing that.",
        "Carlotta: Antonio --",
        "Cristian: Mami, I'm glad you're here.",
        "Carlotta: Oh. Jamie's been in an accident?",
        "Antonio: She was hit by a car.",

        "Cristian: It was an accident, R.J.",
        "R.J.: No, listen, listen. Spilled milk is an accident. Jamie in the emergency room fighting for her life is the fault of an adult. Who was with her?",
        "Antonio: Nobody. No-- nobody was with her.",
        "R.J.: Why the hell not?",
        "Antonio: I don't know.",

        "R.J.: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Carlotta: Everybody, stop it! Now, Jamie needs us to be united. She doesn't need us fighting against one another.",
        "R.J.: Vega, if my granddaughter doesn't walk out of here on her own, the way god made her, it is on your head.",
        "Jessica: It's not Antonio's fault. If you want to blame someone, blame me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Have you and Natalie had a falling-out of some sort?",
        "Vincent: Oh, no, no. Natalie and I are still tight. It's just I've been working on a new project, and we haven't crossed paths like we normally do.",
        "Viki: I see.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. And I know that she's going through something really tough right now in the whole breakup with John.",

        "Adriana: Oh -- he's going to hear about it, Tate! God, how could you do this to me? I'm leaving.",
        "Tate: Wait, wait, wait. Adriana, just -- just hear me out, please? Ok? Look, they asked me how I felt, ok? And all I thought about was the -- the limo ride here and how you told me to be myself. Be myself, and be real. I'm not blaming you, I'm just trying to explain why I did it. Everything I did, and said, was real, Adriana, as real as it gets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Ms. Cramer, you have a phone call. It's an emergency.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Oh. Are you calling us losers?",
        "Marcie: No. But we suffered a setback, and you guys are just ready to throw the towel in.",
        "Amber: What?",
        "Marcie: Look, the school board made a decision, right? They decided to take the money we were going to use for the musical and put it somewhere else, and you guys are just ready to give in.",
        "Langston: There's nothing else we can do.",
        "Marcie: You know, I'm disappointed in you, Langston. I never pegged you as someone who would just give up that easily.",
        "Starr: Wait, Mrs. McBain, that's not fair. That's not what she meant.",
        "Langston: I'm not a quitter, I'm just not a follower like some of these other sheep around here.",
        "Marcie: Well, that sounds to me like that is exactly what you guys are doing. You're just giving up.",
        "Amber: So what? Who cares?",
        "Marcie: Exactly, right? Welcome to generation apathy.",
        "Britney: Oh -- oh, my god. Suddenly, I really want to do a musical.",
        "Starr: Look, Mrs. McBain, you ripping into us isn't exactly inspiring. I'm sorry.",
        "Marcie: Well, I'm just telling it like it is, Starr. When life gives you lemons, what do you do? Do you make lemonade, or do you just suck lemons? Look at all of you. You know, you're so busy acting blas\u00e9 that you're not having any fun. You're bright, you're talented, and it makes me sad to see how apathetic you all are. I mean, where's your fight? I, for one -- I would love to prove the school board wrong. How about you? You know, they think kids don't need art, and drama, and music. But think about your life for one day without music. What would that be like? It would be all algebra and calculus from here on out.",
        "Cole: Ah, kill me now.",
        "Britney: Well, what else are we going to do about it? You said it's a done deal.",
        "Marcie: Britney Jennings is powerless? Less work for me. I already have my national bestseller. Really, you know, just gives me time to write the next one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, I knew it. You got to want something, right? So name your price, Mrs. Bromley. How much does my son cost?",
        "Ms. Bromley: I am no baby broker, sir. I was going to say that I -- I didn't bring the child's file with me.",
        "Todd: Oh. So why did you show up? You just like screwing with our minds?",
        "Ms. Bromley: I think perhaps I was a little hasty in my judgment. A background check on you --",
        "Blair: No, no -- you know what? There's no need for that. It'd take way too much time. And you know, the longer the child is away from the father, the harder it is to -- to reunite them. Todd, we're visiting in this town, and this lovely lady here is doing us a very big favor, so why don't we just show her a little respect, ok?",
        "Ms. Bromley: Ms. Cramer, I appreciate your manners.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: Ms. Bromley, would you mind telling me why you didn't bring the files, please?",
        "Ms. Bromley: Mr. Gray is in his office. I couldn't very well retrieve the files while he was sitting there, could I?",
        "Blair: Oh, we understand that it's putting you in a terrible position, but how quickly do you think that you can get the files for us?",
        "Ms. Bromley: Well, sometime today.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Ms. Bromley: I'll go now. That is, if Mr. Manning has no more insults to hurl.",
        "Blair: No, he doesn't. Let me show you out.",
        "Ms. Bromley: Oh -- I have something from my personal files. I keep snapshots of all our children. It's not much, but it's something.",
        "Blair: Thank you. You want to see your son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: If you need to take it out on someone, R.J., then take it out on me, because I started this whole thing.",
        "Nash: Jessica, don't. Just -- playing the blame game isn't going to help anyone here, all right?",
        "R.J.: You have no say in anything that's going on here.",
        "Cristian: All right, all right, let's just relax. Just try to relax. Can we just -- pray or something?",
        "Carlotta: It's the best thing we can do.",
        "Antonio: How's my daughter?",
        "Paige: Jamie has pulled through. She's stable for now.",
        "Antonio: Oh, thank god.",
        "Michael: Well, she's not exactly out of the woods just yet.",
        "Antonio: What does that mean?",
        "Michael: Well, when dealing with head trauma, a lot of times the fluid that surrounds the brain is not strong enough to absorb --",
        "Antonio: Brain? She's got brain damage?",
        "Michael: No, at least not right now.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, thank God.",
        "Michael: Now, we're going to be observing her very closely tonight, but I think it's safe to say she's going to pull through.",
        "Antonio: I want to be with her.",
        "Michael: The nurses are making sure that she's comfortable. As soon as they say it's ok, you can see your daughter.",
        "Antonio: Thank you.",
        "Carlotta: Thank you, doctor. Well, we're going to be here for a while, so I'm going to go get us something in the cafeteria, ok?",
        "Antonio: All right. Gracias, Mami.",
        "Carlotta: De nada.",
        "Nash: I'm going to call the sitter and check on Bree. But I'd like to stick around if that's ok.",
        "Cristian: You've done enough -- time to leave.",

        "Rex: Enough. Look, if you wanted to break up with me, you could've just told it to my face. You didn't have to broadcast it on national TV.",
        "Adriana: You don't understand.",
        "Rex: No, no -- yeah, no! Brr -- I totally get it! You want the Tate.",
        "Adriana: No, I don't!",
        "Rex: Oh, then -- then what was all that jumping up and down about, huh, like some freakin' monkey on Prozac? Huh?",
        "Adriana: It was Tate, it was totally Tate. I had no idea he was going to do that.",
        "Rex: So, you're not breaking up with me?",
        "Adriana: I love you, Rex. I want you. I don't want to lose you because E.",
        "Tate: Let me talk to him.",
        "Rex: Whoa, wait -- he's there now?",
        "Adriana: I don't think he really wants to talk to you, Tate.",
        "Tate: I just -- I want to have my say, please?",
        "Rex: No -- yeah, yeah. No, put him on. I have some choice words to say to him, too.",
        "Adriana: It's your funeral.",

        "Langston: Mrs. McBain, wait. Now we all feel terrible.",
        "Marcie: Don't. Look, the money they're paying me to do this school play, I couldn't afford a bus trip across town.",
        "Starr: Look, we get it, ok? There's a reason to this musical, but what are we supposed to do about it?",
        "Cole: Yeah, if there's no money to put the show on, then --",
        "Marcie: Well, you have jobs, right? Seriously.",
        "Starr: Well, I babysit for you sometimes.",
        "Marcie: Ok, but what about the rest of you guys? None of you have ever had to work -- or raise money?",
        "Britney: We donate money. We don't collect it. That's tacky.",
        "Marcie: I cannot believe how easy you have all had it.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but it's not even about the money. Even if we had enough, we don't have the rights.",
        "Henry: We don't need rights if we do it on our own. We could write our own show.",
        "Britney: That's -- that's a good idea, Henry.",
        "Cole: Yeah, but can anyone here write? I mean, come on.",
        "Starr: Langston can.",
        "Langston: Forget it. I don't do writing.",
        "Starr: You do, too. She writes great poetry which would be good for songs.",
        "Marcie: Langston? Hand it over.",

        "Todd: You want a drink?",
        "Blair: Well, I don't want you to drink alone. Sure, thanks.",
        "Blair: What are we drinking to?",
        "Todd: Adoption agencies.",
        "Blair: Good ones, I hope. Cheers. You going to look at this picture?",
        "Todd: Soon.",
        "Blair: Do you want me to look at it in case Spencer -- you know, has done something to it?",
        "Todd: So when you were talking to Mrs. Bromley about those foster homes, were they all like that? Were they all that bad?",
        "Blair: Some were worse than others, you know? Huh. One foster mom said I was like damaged goods, you know -- I had a crazy mom, rape child.",
        "Todd: They'd say these kind of things to you?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. Say it so much that sometimes you started to believe it.",
        "Todd: Well, you turned out ok.",
        "Blair: Compared to what?",
        "Todd: Me.",
        "Blair: Are -- are you trying to say that you're better off not being",
        "Todd: Well, not if the parents you got are making you worse. I mean, what if the people who adopted my son are turning him into -- me?",
        "Blair: Well, we're just going to have to wait and see who adopted your son and how he turned out.",
        "Todd: What's changed?",
        "Blair: What are you talking about?",
        "Todd: Well, you're talking about him like he's alive. I thought you said this was all a big trick played by Spencer.",
        "Blair: Well, it might be. But the more and more time goes by, I think we both know that your son is alive. I mean, I can feel that, you can feel that, and if he's out there, we'll find him.",
        "Todd: That's what I'm afraid of.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: You know, what if I don't know him when I see him? What if I don't even know my own son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Well, what do you think? Is Langston's stuff awesome, or what?",
        "Marcie: I think there's some really great stuff here, definitely. What do you guys think? I think there's lots of potential.",
        "Cole: Ok, so we're really going to do this?",
        "Starr: If Langston says it's ok.",
        "Langston: Oh, my stuff isn't performance-ready.",
        "Britney: Oh, please, give it up -- you're loving the attention.",
        "Langston: Not everyone's an attention junky like you, Brit.",
        "Starr: Ok, Langston, look, this could be fun.",
        "Langston: That's easy for you to say -- it's not your name in the title.",
        "Cole: Langston, everyone's name is going to be on the program.",
        "Langston: So, it's up to me? I'm the stopper?",
        "Marcie: Well, the thing is we need your ok, you know, even if we're not going to pay for it.",

        "Vincent: Natalie and I, we're -- we're good friends.",
        "Viki: Yes, that's exactly what she said. I guess I just find the friendship -- odd.",
        "Vincent: \"Odd\"?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Vincent: Why would it be odd, Mrs. Davidson? It wouldn't be the fact that I'm black and she's white?",
        "Viki: No, of course not. That's preposterous.",
        "Vincent: Well, I apologize. You just never know these days, especially with this maniac running around town spreading hate. You know, he's burning down the homes of good people.",
        "Viki: Yes, I know. And actually, I had hoped that I would never, ever again see anything like that in my lifetime because it's sickening.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, well, some people are stupid.",
        "Viki: We agree on that. I know you lost a friend in the fire -- I'm truly sorry.",
        "Vincent: Well, I appreciate it. And I can understand why you would think Natalie and our friendship is \"odd.\"",
        "Viki: Hmm.",
        "Vincent: But tell you the truth, Mrs. Davidson, we have a lot more in common than you think. You see, I'm from AC and I grew up running the streets, and we both kind of had to work our way towards respectability, you know? My thing was running with the football. And Natalie -- well, her thing -- you know, she had to overcome a lot with Roxy. From what I've heard, it was no walk in the park from what she told me.",
        "Viki: Yes, and I'd give anything I could to have changed that.",
        "Vincent: Oh, no, don't say that, Mrs. Davidson. Natalie is who she is because of what she went through growing up. And she is a fine human being. I mean, she's a great person, not to say that your daughter's not beautiful.",
        "Viki: It's all right. Thank you, I understand.",
        "Vincent: And -- and I'm just calling it like I see it, you know? She's not ready for any man right now, you know? And she's still hurting over John -- we both know that. And if she was to get involved with anyone right now, it would just be a rebound situation.",
        "Viki: Well, frankly, I think she's handling it a lot better than I thought she would.",
        "Vincent: I'm happy she kicked McBain to the curb. The man wasn't healthy for her, ok? She was all wrapped up in him and she forgot all about her own stuff.",
        "Viki: What stuff is that?",
        "Vincent: Her future. This girl's got big dreams. You know -- big dreams. She may not know what they are right now, but I'll tell you -- when she figures them out, sky's the limit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: Look, Rex --",
        "Rex: Uh-uh! The Tate's not doing the talking now -- the Rex is, and you're behind the pitch, man.",
        "Tate: Yeah, how do you figure that?",
        "Rex: You may have money and a rep and a baseball bat --",
        "Tate: Well, that sounds like a 3-0 count to me.",
        "Rex: Yeah, but I've got the edge -- you know why? I know you, and how you like to play dress-up.",
        "Tate: What?",
        "Rex: Oh, don't tell the Rex the Tate forgot about those pictures I have of you in women's lingerie?",
        "Tate: Huh. I seriously have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Rex: Maybe it's because I haven't doctored those pictures yet and slipped them under \"The Sun's\" door. See, that's what happens when you become a PI -- you get trained to create things that will fool even your blind grandmother.",
        "Tate: Hold on a second.",
        "Rex: Stay away from my girlfriend -- got it? Or you'll be modeling more than men's boxers. Now put Adriana back on!",
        "Adriana: What did you say to him?",
        "Rex: Oh, never mind. I love you and I'll see you soon, ok? Turn your cell phone on, huh?",
        "Adriana: It is. I forgot it at home.",
        "Rex: That explains a lot.",
        "Adriana: I love you, too. I'll see you back home.",
        "Tate: Look, Adriana, I really want to talk to you about what happened today, ok?",
        "Adriana: Oh, you mean how you completely disrespected me and now I have to fix things with my boyfriend? No, thank you. I'm going to do that, and I'm taking the limo.",

        "Antonio: This can't wait. I'm sorry.",
        "Jessica: You're sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?",
        "Antonio: Judging you against the person you used to be. I promised to love you for better or for worse.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, please --",
        "Antonio: Let me finish. You made mistakes -- I'm not saying you didn't. But we were both there when she ran away.",

        "Blair: About what?",
        "Todd: Well, maybe you're right. You know, she's not such a bad chick and she obviously cares about where the kids go and -- what if the parents my son got aren't that bad? What if they're not screwing him up? What if they're good people and he's got a good home?",
        "Blair: So what if they are? You're going to give him a good home, too.",
        "Todd: Yeah, there are better parents than me, that's for sure.",

        "Todd: Ahem -- that's because of you. You're the reason they came out ok.",
