        "Bo: Knock!",
        "Rex: Arrest me.",
        "Bo: For what -- not knocking?",
        "Rex: No, because if I get my hands on Tate Harmon, \"Oh,\" I'm going to kill him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Excuse me -- why haven't we left yet?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Tate: Hey, Boris, thanks for holding -- excuse me -- the car. Let's head for Llanview.",
        "Adriana: Boris, could you drop me at the nearest train station on the way?",
        "Tate: What are you talking about?",
        "Adriana: Boris, could you also tell Mr. Harmon that I'm not sharing a car with him after what he pulled this afternoon?",
        "Tate: Adriana, don't you think you're kind of overreacting a little bit?",
        "Adriana: Overreacting? You want to see a reaction? What do you think you're doing?",
        "Boris: Car is booked in name of Mr. Harmon. I listen to him only.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Good evening, Viki.",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint.",
        "Clint: Is there any news from Jessica?",
        "Viki: No. No, she and Antonio have a great deal to work out.",
        "Clint: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Clint, I am so sorry I'm late.",
        "Clint: That's all right.",
        "Dorian: There is terrible, terrible traffic. Hello, Viki.",
        "Viki: Hello, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Oh, dear. Oh, no, please don't tell me that you're having dinner with that \"date\" from the other night.",
        "Viki: No. No, I'm having dinner with Nora and Marty Saybrooke. They're friends. Interesting wardrobe for a woman your age.",
        "Dorian: I like to dress up when I have a date -- unlike you, who didn't and don't.",
        "Viki: Right. Well, I think I'll go and join my friends -- unlike you, who doesn't have any.",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Nash, right? Can I ask you something?",
        "Nash: Yeah, I guess.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, I understand that you were a witness? I mean, you saw what happened to Jamie?",
        "Nash: Cristian and I both did.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, well, I'm not going to ask him to testify.",
        "Nash: Testify about what?",
        "R.J.: Well, you see, my 5-year-old granddaughter is in the emergency room, again -- this time because she walked out of her father's apartment and nobody was paying attention. And it seems to me the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania might find that that's negligent.",
        "Nash: Look, uh -- huh -- stuff happens, it's nobody's fault. You and I both know that Antonio is a fantastic father.",
        "R.J.: Listen, I understand that he's backing your winery. But does that really mean that you won't help me?",
        "Nash: Don't do this. Don't make him lose Jamie, too. All right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I'm sorry. I was unavoidably detained.",
        "Nora: Clint and Dorian?",
        "Viki: What are you, psychic?",
        "Nora: I saw them heading to the bar.",
        "Viki: Oh -- please. One of us is going to have to find a new restaurant. How you doing, Marty?",
        "Marty: I'm good.",
        "Viki: Good.",
        "Marty: I'm glad to see you.",
        "Viki: Good, thank you.",
        "Nora: I'm sorry things didn't work out for you and Clint.",
        "Viki: I think I'm over it.",
        "Nora: Good.",
        "Viki: Besides, I still don't know if I really wanted Clint or I was just bloody lonely. You're a therapist -- what's your take on that?",
        "Marty: Uh -- my take is I clocked out with my first sip.",
        "Viki: Oh, ok.",
        "[Marty laughs]",
        "Viki: There you go.",
        "Nora: Listen, if you're wanting someone in your life, when you're ready for someone in life, you will have someone in your life, because you are beautiful and you're smart and you're sexy.",
        "Viki: Nora, so are you!",
        "Nora: We know we are!",
        "Viki: So are you!",
        "Nora: We're fabulous!",
        "Viki: Why are the three of us having dinner together?",
        "Marty: Because there's nothing wrong with three fabulous --",
        "Nora: What's wrong with that?",
        "Marty: Gorgeous women wanting to eat together?",
        "Viki: You know what bothers me? If a man wanted to go out with a woman, he would just go out and find one, right? Why can't we do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: This is Jordan. Hmm -- you fly in tomorrow? I think we can work something out. Are you at the palace? No worries -- I'll get your room number. Hmm -- bye.",
        "Dorian: Thank heavens Jessica's all right.",
        "Clint: Well, all right as she can be given the circumstances. I want to thank you for helping look for her and not getting into it with Viki.",
        "Dorian: Since I am the one you've chosen, it's just simply a matter of noblesse oblige.",
        "[Clint chuckles]",
        "Dorian: However, I do understand Viki's need to see a psychiatrist.",
        "Clint: Excuse me?",
        "Dorian: You heard her say she's having dinner with Nora and Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Clint: Oh, that's --",
        "Dorian: But -- hey -- do you really think that's simply a social occasion?",
        "Nora: If we wanted to go out and find a man, we could. I just don't need to -- I've got Matthew in my life, and frankly, that is all the man I need right now.",
        "Marty: Amen. Cole is more than a handful. I -- I don't know, raising him by myself, you know, he -- he really needs a father right now.",
        "Nora: Well, that's where I'm lucky, because Matthew's got Bo. And I don't have to be bothered dealing with a man.",
        "Viki: I've said that, too.",
        "Nora: I mean it, I mean it -- it's true.",
        "Viki: Ok, I have a question for you.",
        "Nora: All right.",
        "Viki: What do you do at night in bed when your feet are cold?",
        "Nora: Wear socks.",
        "[Marty chuckles]",
        "Viki: I think I'd take my socks off if the right guy came along.",
        "Nora: If the right guy came along, I hope you'd take off more than just your socks.",
        "Viki: Ah -- Nora!",
        "[Nora laughs]",
        "Marty: Well, I tell you what. These socks -- staying on my feet. I just -- you know, what I had with Patrick, I -- I don't think I'll find it anywhere else.",
        "Viki: Honey, that's not necessarily true. It is possible to love more than one man in your life, you know?",
        "Marty: I wish I could believe that. I just --",
        "Viki: Love is terrific, especially the second time around.",
        "Miles: I hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Miles: Hello.",
        "Viki: Hello, Miles.",
        "Miles: Hello. Wow, Marty, you look beautiful tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, I'm sorry. I -- I still haven't got used to this whole co-ed locker policy -- stupid.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It's nothing I haven't seen before. It's just different now.",
        "John: Well, look, I'll try to get a locker on the other side, all right?",
        "Natalie: No, it's cool. Don't.",
        "John: Well, you know, if -- if you're uncomfortable, I don't want that.",
        "Natalie: We talked about it. And we knew we were going to be seeing each other around and we said it would be weird.",
        "John: Right.",
        "Natalie: I just didn't expect to find you without your pants on.",
        "John: Well --",
        "Natalie: But it's -- you know, it's -- who am I kidding? This -- this is making me uncomfortable. This is weird. And you know what? There's only one way to deal with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: So what does that mean -- \"don't make him lose Jamie, too\"?",
        "Nash: Oh --",
        "R.J.: What else has he lost?",
        "Nash: Uh -- it was, um -- huh -- an arsonist. There was an arsonist running around burning buildings, burned down a building he owned, burned down his club. It's -- he's been -- he's been through a lot.",
        "R.J.: Huh, not to mention his problems with Jessica.",
        "Nash: Hmm. Whatever do you mean by that?",
        "R.J.: Well, first, she wants to adopt Jamie and then she doesn't, so she runs away and, well, today I heard her saying that she'd been causing problems that were distracting Antonio, and that's why he didn't know Jamie had left the house. Are you one of these distractions?",
        "Nash: Jessica and I have a kid together. Sometimes it gets complicated. Hmm.",
        "[R.J. Sighs]",
        "R.J.: Why haven't we heard more about what's going on with Jamie? Where is a doctor anyway?",
        "Nash: I don't know.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, I know you don't know, but somebody around here is going to answer my questions.",
        "Jessica: I was going to wait till Jamie was 100%, but I think that I should call my parents and let them know what happened.",
        "Antonio: Please -- stay with me, please. Look, I -- I know we have a lot to talk about, um --",
        "Jessica: It can wait.",
        "Antonio: After Jamie, you know --",
        "Jessica: It can wait.",
        "Antonio: That night -- I know.",
        "Jessica: She's all that matters now.",
        "Antonio: I know -- it's just that I think you should know that I know about Nash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Tate Harmon was jumping up and down on a couch?",
        "Rex: Yeah, on national TV talking about how gorgeous and brilliant his special lady is.",
        "Bo: I'm having a deja vu moment.",
        "Rex: Then, the ladies on \"the view\" ask him a question about his Adriana -- \"his Adriana,\" that's how they put it. Then, Harmon hauls Adriana up on stage because guess what -- she's with him!",
        "Bo: Oh, jeez.",
        "Rex: This isn't funny!",
        "Bo: No, I know that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know you're very upset.",
        "Rex: What do I do?",
        "Bo: Well, you don't kill Harmon -- there's no percentage in that.",
        "Rex: Ok!",
        "Bo: Ok, you came and you asked for my advice after the winter festival -- you thought that Harmon was after Adriana then.",
        "Rex: I talked to her like you said.",
        "Bo: And?",
        "Rex: She basically told me to -- to stop being stupid because there was no reason to be jealous.",
        "Bo: Well, it sounds like she was wrong. Now, have you talked to her since she and Harmon were on \"the view\"?",
        "Rex: Yeah. She said she was at the show with Harmon because he promised that he would promote the company she and Layla are starting.",
        "Bo: The underwear company?",
        "Rex: She said she had no idea Harmon was going to do what he did.",
        "Bo: You believe her?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Well, then, what's the problem?",
        "Rex: Adriana's wrong. This isn't in my head. Harmon wants her and he'll do anything to get her. What do I do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Adriana sighs]",
        "Adriana: You let me out of here.",
        "Tate: Boris, I don't think you're helping matters out here. You want to unlock the doors, please?",
        "Boris: She can go?",
        "Tate: I don't know how you do it at home, but we don't hold people against their will, especially not this woman.",
        "[Doors unlock]",
        "Tate: Spasiba.",
        "Boris: Pozhaluista.",
        "Tate: I had nothing to do with that. Are you ok?",
        "Adriana: Are you aware, Tate, that last summer I had a really bad situation with a stalker? And so when somebody tells me that I can't leave, I don't really handle it very well!",
        "Tate: I'm sorry -- I didn't know that. Uh -- if you want to go on to Llanview alone, I'll make it happen. I just -- I want to say that I'm really sorry you're so upset.",
        "Adriana: I'll be fine -- let's just go.",
        "[Doors lock]",
        "[Car drives]",
        "Adriana: I'm still really mad at you. I cannot believe what you said on the show today.",
        "Tate: I know. It was stupid and you've made it very clear that you're furious with me, so if you don't want to talk to me all the way back to Llanview, I'll be a sphinx.",
        "Adriana: I'm just happy that Rex believed me when I said I had nothing to do with it.",
        "Tate: You really think you didn't?",
        "Adriana: Uh -- I know I didn't.",
        "Tate: Because, you know, a pitcher learns how to read signals and I got to tell you, I swear I had yours nailed.",
        "Adriana: What signals?",
        "Tate: Oh, you know, like you going out of your way to spend time with me.",
        "Adriana: Ah you don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Tate: All those fittings you did personally -- you could've had Layla or an assistant handle that.",
        "Adriana: Uh -- excuse me, but me doing all of your fittings was your idea. And besides, this company is my life and I want everything to look right.",
        "Tate: So it was just business, huh?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, it was just business.",
        "Tate: Like going all the way to Manhattan with me was just business?",
        "Adriana: You're the one that talked me into this! I didn't come so that I could be alone with you. I wanted Layla to come, but she was tied up.",
        "Tate: I asked you to come with me, but I didn't force you.",
        "Adriana: Oh!",
        "Tate: And you're the one who turned the conversation around to my love life.",
        "Adriana: Because I was trying to help you.",
        "Tate: And you didn't seem to mind when I kissed you.",
        "Adriana: And I told you never to do that again.",
        "Tate: Afterwards!",
        "Adriana: Oh, God.",
        "Tate: But while it was happening, you really seemed to be enjoying yourself. In fact, you really seem to be enjoying all the attention I've been giving you, so why don't you own that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Um -- did you talk to Nash?",
        "Antonio: No. No, Cristian told me.",
        "Jessica: Of course.",
        "Antonio: I guess I should've figured it out myself.",
        "Jessica: I really don't know what to say.",
        "Antonio: Well, what is there to say? You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Jessica: How can you say that?",
        "Antonio: Well, um --",
        "Paige: Hey. I've got the results of Jamie's latest tests. Should we talk in the hall?",
        "R.J.: So, how -- you know, does Jamie have brain damage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So you have a way to make this easier for us?",
        "Natalie: Um -- well, I've got a way to make it easier for me. You're on your own.",
        "John: Hmm. All right, I'm all ears.",
        "Natalie: Well, one of the reasons we're not together anymore is because you felt that I was making decisions for you, running your life.",
        "John: Yeah, that was part of it.",
        "Natalie: Right, so I have to start thinking in a whole new way, and not \"how is this going to make John feel?\" And \"is this going to be ok with John?\" I have to think about me, and my future and it -- it's just that seeing you all the time makes it really hard.",
        "John: So what's your plan?",
        "Natalie: Well, no time like the present to stop living in the past. So that's what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You know, Dorian, you are very, very, very good.",
        "Dorian: Thank you. Good at what?",
        "Clint: At using a non-derogatory statement about Viki to make a derogatory statement about Viki.",
        "Dorian: I had no intention of doing any such thing. No, no, no -- as far as I'm concerned, I would rather not say anything about Viki ever again and just talk about us.",
        "Clint: Ah. And what would you say about us?",
        "Dorian: I would say -- \"Clint, what is it that you would say we are doing?\"",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Dorian: We've been seeing each other for a long time now.",
        "Clint: Yeah?",
        "Dorian: We've never spent the night together.",
        "Clint: Yeah -- well, technically, I suppose you're right, but there was that very spontaneous evening a while back and then the other afternoon when you herded me into the shower when -- well, you know, that was afternoon. We couldn't very well turn in, could we?",
        "Dorian: Impetuous, reckless and very, very exciting.",
        "Clint: So where's the problem?",
        "Dorian: We've had glorious sex, but have we actually made love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Well, it was nice to see all of you. Mrs. Davidson, please tell Jessica I said hello.",
        "Viki: Yes, I will.",
        "Miles: I had sort of a personal crisis recently and she was very helpful.",
        "Viki: Oh, was she? Are you all right now?",
        "Miles: I'm fine, thank you.",
        "Viki: Good.",
        "Miles: And I hope to see you again sometime soon, Marty. Enjoy your dinner.",
        "Viki: Bye.",
        "Nora: What am I, chopped liver? I mean, what was that about?",
        "Marty: What was what about?",
        "Nora: [As miles] \"Marty, you look beautiful tonight.\" \"Marty, I hope I see you again.\" \"Marty, Marty, Marty, Marty.\"",
        "Marty: No. I am just the first woman he has ever spent any time with outside of the hospital and I -- he just has a little crush on me.",
        "Viki: Well, you're not too pleased about that, are you?",
        "Marty: Yeah. It's just -- look, he got a little physical with me the other night and I had to make it perfectly clear to him that we can be nothing more than friends.",
        "Nora: [Normal voice] I don't think he bought it.",
        "Marty: Well, he should have, you know? I told him exactly what I'm telling you -- there could never be anyone else for me. I mean, no one can compare to Patrick.",
        "Viki: Why does anyone else have to compare?",
        "Marty: Ok, Viki, let me ask you for some advice.",
        "Viki: Yeah?",
        "Marty: How do I stop comparing?",
        "Viki: Honey, you have to see each person for his own merits. Ben and I were terribly, terribly in love. But before he died, he told me he didn't want me to be alone.",
        "Marty: Well, didn't that break your heart to hear him say that?",
        "Viki: No, it did not. He said it out of love. And as a result, if I do find love again, I'm not betraying his memory.",
        "Marty: But I just -- you know, I lost Patrick so suddenly. I don't know -- maybe if I had had a chance to talk to him like that, maybe --",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Marty: I don't know -- hmm.",
        "Nora: Don't you ever go to bed at night and look at the other side of the bed and wish there was someone there to say \"good night\" to?",
        "Marty: Yes, all the time, but it's not about wanting something new. It's about wanting what I lost. I mean, there is nothing in the world like loving someone with all your heart, just loving them completely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: I'm -- I'm looking at her most recent scans. Her CT scan and her MRI show no signs of swelling. Her ICP -- that's her intercranial pressure -- is normal. And her neuro checks are all within the normal range, so -- [Paige sighs] You can relax. I -- I think we've done it.",
        "Antonio: You're sure?",
        "Paige: I have every hope that Jamie will make a full recovery.",
        "Jessica: Thank God.",
        "Paige: Now, we've given her a drug to put her under. I've discontinued that.",
        "Antonio: When will she wake up?",
        "Paige: It'll probably be a few hours. We're weaning her off the ventilator and in an hour or so, we'll discontinue the ventilator and the feeding tube, so --",
        "R.J.: So many tubes in one little girl. Will she remember this?",
        "Paige: Probably not. Head injuries are often accompanied by a retrograde amnesia, so she's probably not going to remember the accident or anything that happened the hour before. Now, she may have some very bad dreams and she's definitely going to have a sore throat, but I think she's going to be fine.",
        "R.J.: Well, I want to see her.",

        "Nash: I'm sorry, Antonio, I still think of you as a friend.",
        "Antonio: You shut your mouth.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, please don't do this.",
        "Antonio: A friend doesn't act out on a friend's feelings for his wife. A decent father doesn't use his baby to get closer to the mother.",
        "Nash: I didn't do that.",
        "Antonio: No, that's exactly what you did. You pressured Jessica into choosing between my daughter and yours, didn't you?",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Antonio: You convinced her that she couldn't be the mother that Bree deserved and also be Jamie's mother.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, he didn't do that.",
        "Antonio: Don't defend him.",
        "Nash: I know --",
        "Antonio: You're the reason she's tied up in knots. You're the reason she ran out of that courtroom. You're the reason we were yelling at each other, and the reason my daughter ran away!",

        "Adriana: Oh --",
        "Tate: And the audience should run out and buy your bras and briefs.",

        "Tate: I guess you don't see it the same way.",
        "Adriana: You used me.",
        "Tate: You used me, too. You used my name and my body to sell your product.",
        "Adriana: You had a choice.",
        "Tate: And I made it. I let you treat me like a slab of meat, like some dumb former jock so you could sell your underwear.",
        "Adriana: Well, I never thought of it like that.",
        "Tate: And now you're all bent out of shape because I honestly believe you're as incredible as I said you were on \"the view.\"",
        "Adriana: Oh. I really don't get you.",
        "Tate: Why?",
        "Adriana: Because you're like two people. One is this, like, cartoon character who believes his own P.R. And talks about himself in the third person.",
        "Tate: Mm-hmm.",
        "Adriana: \"The Tate\" thinks he's God's gift because he's so incredibly good looking, and he threw a hard ball for a few years.",
        "Tate: And what about the other guy?",
        "Adriana: The other guy is sincere, and treats me with respect. The other guy gives inspirational talks to high school kids about how to fight back when life sticks it to you. He's able to talk about his feelings when his mother died, and he still keeps in touch with his second-grade teacher who encouraged him to follow his dream.",
        "Tate: You really like that wuss better, huh?",
        "Adriana: What I'm starting to wonder is if the second guy is just there so that the Tate can get what he wants.",

        "Bo: Now, that -- that'll be different.",
        "Rex: Why?",

        "Rex: Yeah, that'll work. Come on, Bo.",
        "Bo: All right, all right. I think it's obvious that Harmon is after Adriana.",
        "Rex: Yeah. And he plays dirty.",
        "Bo: Ok, but she knows he throws spit balls, isn't that right?",
        "Rex: Well, that's what she says.",
        "Bo: Ok. You trust her?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Then maybe it's a good idea to just let this whole thing blow over.",
        "Rex: I -- I was doing that. And then Adriana and Tate have made \"The View,\" and every other internet site on the planet. What would you do if some dude was moving in on Paige and making it clear that he wasn't about to back off?",

        "Natalie: It's just too bad that that's not what you wanted. I'm going to have to stop kicking myself. You know, I've got to figure out what my next move is going to be, and I probably shouldn't be talking about it with you. Huh.",
        "John: Hey, look at me. You want to talk, I'll listen.",
        "Natalie: Like you'd do any soul baring with me. Ok, this officially sucks. It -- it's just that I always had this thought about us. That underneath all the love and sex that we were friends. You know, and I just keep thinking that maybe if we can get through this time, that maybe we can be friends again. Maybe -- um -- maybe I'll be able to look at this picture without wanting to cry, and -- I don't know -- remember it as a day that I was really happy. I'll see you around.
