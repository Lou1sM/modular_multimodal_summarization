        "Rex asks Adriana to \"be nice\" to Gigi. She does as he asks but Gigi doesn't buy it. Meanwhile, Dorian and Layla are on their mission and have found Brody Lovett (or so they hear), as Adriana has demanded they do. He informs them that he was with Gigi many years ago and has known all this while and that he conceived Shane with Gigi. Dorian and Layla inform Adriana and she rushes to find Brody in the hopes of \"reuniting\" him with Gigi. Yet, Rex seems to be more interested in Gigi than in his own fianc\u00e9. He is concerned about her interest in Jared and protests that she is too good for the likes of him. But nobody else understands why he thinks it's his business. Clint is still ready to play hard ball with Calvin Jenkins. Bo still disagrees. Dorian is still pulling Calvin's strings to motivate him to ruin the Buchanans."

        "Starr: I've been looking all over for you. We need to talk.",
        "Cole: Okay, okay. I skipped lunch because I'm trying to pull everything together.",
        "Starr: Pull what together?",
        "Cole: I still have some stuff to work on, but meet me back here in a couple of hours and I'll explain everything to you, okay?",
        "Starr: Uh --",
        "Cole: Love you.",
        "Starr: And -- Cole?",

        "Jared: So what do you have in mind, Clint?",
        "Bo: Going after Cal personally, right?",
        "Clint: Well, you tried to reason with the man and got nowhere, so here we all are. What are we going to do? So far, we're just going to lie down and take it.",
        "Bo: No, no, look, lying down and playing dirty -- those aren't the only two options here.",
        "Clint: Well, I'm open to any and all suggestions, but please keep in mind that we're running out of time here.",
        "Jared: Well, Jenkins is playing dirty. Why can't we?",
        "Natalie: Have you ever heard of taking the high road, pal?",
        "Bo: Look, we have nothing on Jenkins, okay? That's because there's nothing to get.",
        "Clint: Yeah, probably not. So what's next -- do we sell off a minor subsidiary, try and get into a stronger position?",
        "Jared: Well, we've already looked into that.",
        "Natalie: So? We can look at it again.",
        "Bo: Maybe we missed something. Excuse me.",
        "Jared: You want me to do some digging, Clint?",
        "Clint: That won't be necessary.",

        "Shane: Shane Morasco.",
        "Marcie: I met Shane and his mom when I was in Texas. Shane, this is my friend Lindsay. She works in an art gallery.",

        "Shane: A comic book.",

        "Rex: Here -- take it. Talk to Adriana.",
        "Gigi: Will you just drop it?",
        "Rex: Adriana? Sorry, I -- I was telling Gigi that you don't have a problem with her and me being friends. I thought she should hear it from you.",
        "Adriana: Well, I so don't want her to feel uncomfortable about all this. Put her on.",
        "Rex: She really wants to talk to you.",
        "Gigi: Hello, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: I hope there wasn't any misunderstanding between us earlier.",
        "Gigi: No, I'm pretty sure I didn't misunderstand anything.",

        "Blair: I cannot tell you how much I love the feeling after that workout.",
        "Todd: Are you kidding me? I hate that crap. I'm never doing that again.",
        "Blair: Well, what are you talking about? It gets your blood pumping, the endorphins going.",
        "Todd: I got a better way to get the endorphins going, and the blood pumping to the right places.",

        "Lindsay: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Marcie: This is Shane's second comic book, actually. He got an A on his first one.",
        "Shane: It was all my friend Rex's idea.",
        "Lindsay: Rex -- he's a friend of mine, too.",
        "Shane: I made a copy of my first one for him.",

        "Marcie: Well, yeah, sure, as soon as we're done here, okay?",
        "Lindsay: So Adriana's wedding must be -- it's coming up soon. Have you seen your bridesmaid's dress yet?",
        "Marcie: Uh -- no. Adriana hasn't asked me to be in the wedding party.",
        "Lindsay: You're kidding me.",
        "Marcie: Nope.",
        "Lindsay: Well, you and Rex have been friends forever. She's not going to leave you out of the wedding.",
        "Shane: I bet she would. She's like Evelyn Evil. She can pretend to be nice when she wants, but she does things no one knows about.",
        "Marcie: Who's Evelyn Evil?",
        "Shane: A supervillain.",

        "Gigi: If you say so.",
        "Adriana: I'm so glad that you and Shane are coming to the wedding. You're one of Rex's oldest friends, so you should be there to see us get married.",

        "Man: Ah!",
        "Dorian: Ah. For sure -- for sure that is Brody Lovett?",
        "Man: Ma'am, that's definitely him. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go call my mother.",
        "Waitress: Hey, Brody, what are you doing later?",
        "Layla: Now what?",
        "Dorian: It is such a shame that Brody didn't turn out to be that nice, young officer instead of this --",
        "Layla: Psycho? Yeah.",

        "Natalie: \"Do you want me to do some digging, Clint?\" I can't believe you said that.",
        "Jared: Why?",
        "Natalie: Did you hear a word that was said in that meeting? We are trying to come up with a better solution other than using skeletons from someone's closet.",
        "Jared: Well, I think your dad was right -- when it comes to saving this company, anything is fair game.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Your closet's not so tidy, so you better hope no one goes digging through it and finds out you're not really a Buchanan.",
        "Jared: Okay, well, maybe you would rather have David Vickers here on the inside, prying the gold fixtures off the wall to make a quick buck or -- or better yet, offering up company secrets to the highest bidder?",
        "Natalie: That's why I'm not telling the family.",
        "Jared: Right. It's not for me -- I got that.",
        "Natalie: You can go at any time.",
        "Jared: Are you avoiding me because of last night?",
        "Natalie: Last night?",
        "Jared: Seeing me at Capricorn with Gigi?",
        "Natalie: Hmm. Only after you saw me with Miles.",
        "Jared: I wasn't the jealous one.",
        "Natalie: Huh, oh, right, because after I left with Miles, you glommed up the first thing in a skirt so that you could follow us without being completely embarrassed because you can't stand me being with another man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You could've said you were in here.",
        "Cristian: I did, but you guys were too busy doing your thing.",
        "Blair: It's not like he hasn't seen it all before.",
        "Todd: That's very nice. Thank you for reminding me of that.",
        "Cristian: I could've done without seeing you, though, man. You really, really need to get to the gym.",
        "Todd: You know, I could drop a has-been bantamweight prize fighter like you --",
        "Blair: Okay, okay, stop. Stop, both of you. Cristian, you really don't need to be getting in another fight now, do you?",
        "Cristian: That's true.",
        "Blair: You made bail?",
        "Cristian: Ramsey dropped the charges.",
        "Todd: Were you in jail? Oh, that's terrific. What happened?",
        "Cristian: I punched John McBain last night.",
        "Todd: Do you see, Blair, what happens when one resorts to violence?",
        "Blair: Would you stop?",
        "Cristian: Well, at least I picked on someone my own size. I mean, the way I hear it, you only beat up kids.",

        "Cole: Hey, did you get IDs?",
        "Markko: I only got yours so far.",
        "Cole: All right. You got my message about making them from Virginia, right?",
        "Markko: Yeah, yeah. Hey, check it out.",
        "Cole: Oh, nice, looks like the real deal.",
        "Markko: Yeah, this dude -- he's good.",
        "Cole: Dude, I owe you big-time, man.",
        "Markko: Yeah, forget it. Uh -- I cleaned out my bank account. 227 bucks -- I don't make that much bussing tables.",
        "Cole: Dude, I -- I can't take this, man.",
        "Markko: No, you need this more than I do.",
        "Cole: I -- I don't know how to thank you.",

        "Lindsay: It looks like Adriana.",
        "Marcie: Shane, you don't really think that Adriana is evil?",
        "Shane: She's mean to my mom.",
        "Lindsay: Maybe you're mistaken. I mean, she's usually a really nice girl.",
        "Shane: Then how come she didn't invite Marcie to be in the wedding?",
        "Marcie: So, how are things going with you?",
        "Lindsay: Good. Yeah, I'm working at the gallery again and we have a new installation coming in.",
        "Marcie: We're both really lucky to be sitting here right now, you know.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, absolutely. I owe Bo absolutely everything.",
        "Marcie: How is it living with him?",
        "Lindsay: It's great.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Lindsay: Mm-hmm, a lot better than it would be -- where I'd be living if Nora had her way.",

        "Bo: Hey.",
        "Rex: What's up?",
        "Bo: I -- I want to talk to you about the wedding.",
        "Rex: You're still going to be my best man, right?",
        "Bo: Well, that's -- that's what I want to talk to you about.",
        "Rex: You're not backing out?",
        "Bo: Look, I -- I wonder now that you know that Charlie is -- is your real dad, you know, maybe you want him standing up there with you.",
        "Rex: He's a -- a groomsman. But Charlie, that's sort of -- it's biology. I'm not mad at him, but he -- he wasn't there. I told him that I wouldn't be the guy I am today if it weren't for you.",
        "Bo: What, I get blamed for that? Oh, gee --",
        "[Bo laughs]",
        "Rex: You're still in?",
        "Bo: I'm in.",
        "Rex: I'm glad. I thought maybe you were ticked because you heard about the dirt I dug up.",
        "[Rex chuckles]",
        "Bo: What dirt? What are you talking about, Balsom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Ooh! Ooh, okay, you think I'm jealous of you and Miles?",
        "Natalie: Me and miles, me and John McBain, me and Irv, the guy in the mailroom -- me and any guy other than you.",
        "Jared: I told you last night that is ridiculous. Besides, we both know you're not dating Miles. You just went out with him to get to me.",
        "Natalie: And apparently, I did.",
        "Jared: Oh, and it didn't get to you at all that I was out with Gigi last night?",
        "Natalie: You can date the Olsen twins for all I care. There's absolutely nothing between us except this fake uncle thing.",
        "Jared: Oh, there's more than that, because we both know what happens when we're alone together.",
        "Natalie: Yeah -- we fight.",
        "Gigi: Natalie, I need your signature --",
        "Jared: Ahem.",
        "Gigi: Sorry if I was interrupting something.",
        "Natalie: No. No, Jared was just leaving.",
        "Jared: Yeah. I'll be back.",
        "Gigi: Is everything okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. You know, we're just -- we're all really upset about this Calvin Jenkins thing. I'll get these signatures for you. Is there something else?",
        "Gigi: I think going out with Jared is a mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I still don't have anything on Calvin Jenkins.",
        "Clint: Well, that's no surprise -- there isn't anything.",
        "Lindsay: Hmm, but I do have something on his son.",
        "Clint: I already have the information on Cal Jr.",
        "Lindsay: I was talking about his younger son. Cal Jr.'s hiding something, too?",
        "Clint: What have you got?",
        "Lindsay: Well, poor Cal. Apparently, neither one of his sons are following in his squeaky-clean boot prints.",
        "Clint: I wonder if Mr. Jenkins has any idea at all what his boys are up to.",
        "Lindsay: I don't know if he does or not, but he's a very proud man and I know he'd do just whatever it takes to keep this quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Cal, I am so glad to hear you've come to your senses. Really, it would've broken my heart to have you replaced as C.E.O. of your own company? And for what -- some bogus sob story from Bo Buchanan? Please. Let me know if anything new happens -- otherwise, stick to the plan.",
        "Layla: Okay, we do not want to go into that back room.",
        "Dorian: Why? How much worse can it be?",
        "Layla: Uh-uh. We are staying right here. Brody has to come out sooner or later.",

        "Marcie: I hope we're not interrupting.",
        "Adriana: No, not at all. Just one second -- sorry. Okay. Um -- come -- come on -- come on in.",
        "Marcie: Okay. You can go on in -- there you go.",
        "Adriana: Yeah. Sorry.",
        "Marcie: Ahem.",
        "Shane: This is for Rex.",
        "Adriana: Oh! Your -- your comic book!",
        "Marcie: Well, Rex kind of gave Shane the idea, so he wanted to give him a copy. Is Rex here?",
        "Adriana: Oh, he's not. I'm sorry, but you -- you can give it to me and I could give it to Rex.",
        "Shane: I want to show him my new comic book, too.",
        "Adriana: Another one? Wow!",
        "Shane: Yeah. Want to see it?",
        "Marcie: Oh -- I don't -- I don't think that's a good idea. Really, I -- I think you should wait until it's done. You don't want to jinx it. So, give Adriana the comic book you've already finished, honey.",
        "Adriana: Cool. Well, it was good to see you guys. I'm -- I'm sorry that Rex wasn't here.",
        "Marcie: Right. Okay.",
        "Adriana: Oh, Marcie -- you know what?",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Adriana: I forgot to ask you something.",
        "Marcie: Ask me what?",
        "Adriana: Uh -- you know, I'm really sorry that Michael's not going to be able to stand up for Rex in the wedding.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I'm sorry about that, too.",
        "Adriana: But we'd still love for you to be part of the wedding.",
        "Marcie: You would?",
        "Adriana: Are you kidding? Of course we would.",
        "Marcie: I'd be honored.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, Rex and I -- we would really love it if you would handle the guest book.",
        "Marcie: Sure. I'd be happy to.",

        "Rex: Yeah, it sounds like I shouldn't be talking about this.",

        "Rex: Maybe you better talk to Clint.",
        "Bo: No, no -- Balsom, I'm talking to you. Now, come on. Don't jerk me around here.",
        "Rex: I'm a P.I. You know part of the job description is keeping your mouth shut.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you didn't.",
        "Rex: I thought you knew.",
        "Bo: Let's just say I was under the -- the mistaken impression that my brother and I ran this whole company together.",

        "Gigi: Who else?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I -- um -- I just -- why are you telling me this?",

        "[Natalie chuckles]",
        "Natalie: No. Why would I be? He's my uncle.",
        "Gigi: I -- I'm just -- I'm just talking about the fact that I -- I went out with somebody in management. Rex said it was a bad idea and he was right. I -- although it wasn't really a date, I'm just saying it hit me that maybe it wasn't good form.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Um -- no. Like I told you last night, you didn't do anything wrong, you're not in any sort of trouble, so stop worrying. You are not the one who was out of line.",

        "Adriana: What did you say to Marcie?",
        "Shane: I said that you were the one --",

        "Adriana: I asked you to handle this.",
        "Dorian: Brody Lovett, um -- well, he's turned out to be a bit of a wild card. I think you had better see him for yourself before you decide to bring Gigi's son's father to Llanview.",
        "Adriana: Oh, I'm already positive -- more than ever.",
        "Dorian: Come see for yourself. Don't make any hasty decisions.",

        "Todd: Yeah, people who don't are always the ones who think they're right.",
        "Cristian: Well, I don't know if I'm right, but the way I see it -- if I had a kid like Starr, I'd make sure things stayed tight between us.",
        "Todd: I do that.",
        "Cristian: Right, by beating up her boyfriend?",
        "Todd: Oh, now, this is all you, isn't it? I get it now. Let's have a little workout, Todd. Let's have a little steam, Todd. You set this up with him, didn't you?",

        "Brody: Never heard of her.",
        "Dorian: That's surprising. Since she was the girl you were going to marry 10 years ago.",
        "Brody: If you know that, then you know she walked out on me. Couldn't even wait three months for me to get back. So why the hell would I want to hear anything you have to say about her?",
        "Dorian: Because she didn't walk out on you. Your mother lied to you.",
        "Brody: My mother's dead. You don't know anything about her.",
        "Layla: Mr. Lovett, we were just speaking to your lovely sister, Nadine. And she told us your mother lied, first to Gigi, and said you had been killed in action. And then she lied to you and said Gigi left you for another man. But there wasn't anybody else.",
        "Dorian: I have no idea why your mother said what she did, but I do know this. You have a right to meet your son.",

        "Bo: Did he get the goods that you needed to strong-arm Webster and Cobb?",
        "Clint: You mean to say, how I averted a hostile takeover by those two? No. Rex was not involved in that. And -- look, I don't want to get into this with you right now.",
        "Bo: That's too bad.",
        "Clint: Look, Bo, I gave your kinder, gentler approach with Jenkins a try. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Now, I know that you want to keep taking the high road. And as I told you before, I think you should. But in the end, I got to make sure the job gets done.",
        "Bo: Well, you know, blackmail seems to work for us. Why don't -- let's just keep wallowing in the mud, okay? Who cares if we ruin a decent man's life, as long as we don't lose any money?",

        "Brody: Gigi Morasco -- she never married anybody else?",
        "Dorian: No. Her heart was so broken when your mother told her that you had died that she never so much as looked at another man again. Oh, what a strong love that must have been to create such enduring fidelity.",
        "Brody: Gigi told you about me?",

        "Dorian: Yes, how did you know?",

        "Gigi: \"Schtick\"? What are you talking about?",
        "Rex: I -- I've seen it before. Hell, I've even done it myself. You -- you see a girl who's not interested. You pull this \"I'm your friend\" routine. Make her think you're this -- this nice, friendly, sensitive guy. You get her to let her guard down. And then, bang!",
