        "Bo: No. Look, I'm not worried about replacing you. I'm worried about you.",
        "Natalie: Don't be. This is what I need to do.",
        "Bo: Nat, you know and you understand, once you quit --",
        "Natalie: You may not be able to bring me back. I know. And I won't want to come back.",
        "Bo: Are you sure this is in your best interest?",
        "Natalie: Of course. Why wouldn't it be?",
        "Bo: Oh, come on. You're quitting because of John.",

        "John: You were doing some work when I came in?",
        "Marty: Oh, no. It can wait. Did you need to see me about something? You said you were glad to see me.",
        "John: Yeah, yeah. You know, this perp that's been assaulting all these senior citizens, I never got the -- the psych profile you were working up on him.",
        "Marty: Oh, I actually -- I have it here with me. I was going to drop off the -- the final draft to your office tomorrow, but I have a rough here on my P.D.A.",
        "John: You mind if I look at it now?",
        "Marty: No, sure.",
        "John: Oh, great. Yeah. You know, this is kind of generic. This -- this isn't going to help me at all.",
        "Marty: Excuse me?",

        "Jordan: Good to know, but don't rush.",
        "Miles: Oh. Ok.",
        "Jordan: Let's have a drink, shall we?",
        "Miles: Yeah. I have some champagne. I'll pour you one.",
        "Jordan: No. Miles, I'll pour for you. After all, I'm here for you -- to anticipate your needs and wants, every one of them.",
        "Miles: Every one of them?",
        "Jordan: Mm-hmm.",
        "Miles: I'm not really sure that there's really all that many of them.",
        "Jordan: Well, let's figure out what they are then. That is why you invited me here, isn't it -- for your pleasure?",
        "Miles: Uh, well, no. No, I mean, actually, um -- I invited you here because I'd like you to teach me how to pleasure you.",

        "Todd: I thought you were going to bed.",
        "Blair: Couldn't sleep. Did you look at the picture?",
        "Todd: Yeah. He couldn't have been more than a few days old when that was taken. He just looks like every other newborn I've seen.",

        "Todd: Remind me of me? No.",
        "Blair: Well, what about -- what about the kids? Does he look like Jack and Starr?",
        "Todd: No, he doesn't look like anyone. He's just a newborn. You know, his eyes are closed. His face is all red and swollen. It's a totally useless, meaningless picture.",
        "Blair: Did you hear from Mrs. Bromley?",
        "Todd: No. And we might never hear from her. Besides, the cops are probably out there looking for me right now because we haven't left town.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on, Todd, please. We've come too far for you to give up.",
        "Todd: Shut up! I -- just leave me alone about it! I should've done this on my own.",

        "Blair: Yes, you do want me here! You need me here, and the more you say that you don't, I'm convinced that you do because we didn't come here to look for your son! We came here to find --",

        "Evangeline: Vincent, what are you doing here?",
        "Vincent: Oh, I came to pick up reports on the fire at Shaun's grandparents', to give to their insurance company.",

        "Vincent: And you, what's your story?",
        "Evangeline: I just came here to pick up some files to work on at home. So, see you.",

        "Evangeline: Yeah. Yeah. It is mine.",

        "Asa: See how she moves? She should, too. This is her house now.",
        "Nora: Oh, Asa, this is not my house now, even though you and your lovely wife have been very, very accommodating. I can't thank you enough, but no. You take it black, right?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Anyway -- no. Thank you, but I will not be staying here very long. I'm moving out. And I know you'll be glad to hear that.",
        "Clint: Why would I be glad to hear that?",
        "Nora: Well, I don't know. I think that my being here has bothered you a little bit. I think I'm taking all of the time away from you with Ma and Pa.",

        "Jordan: But, Miles, I thought you hired me for your pleasure.",
        "Miles: No, I didn't.",

        "Miles: I'm a virgin.",
        "Jordan: Oh, wait, is this a game? Is this where you get turned on if you pretend that you've never been with a woman before?",
        "Miles: No. No, I'm not pretending. I've never been with a woman.",
        "Jordan: No kidding?",
        "Miles: No, I -- I need to be taught things.",
        "Jordan: Right. Any special reason you need to be taught these things?",
        "Miles: There is, yeah. Um -- I'm in love with someone and I want to make sure that I can make her happy, emotionally and physically.",
        "Jordan: I promise you, Miles, that by the time I'm through with you, that that woman will be hopelessly and madly in love with you, too.",

        "Natalie: If this was about John, don't you think that I would tell you? I mean, do I normally come up with fake excuses for things? Haven't I always been pretty straight with you?",
        "Bo: Yes. Yes, but I just think that sometimes we don't know when we do certain things. I thought I'd point it out.",
        "Natalie: Ok, but I don't need anybody to point anything out to me. I've thought about this a lot. Look, ok, I admit the thought of working with John every single day, wasn't thrilled about it. But I resent the fact that you think that I wouldn't stick it out. I mean, that hurts, Bo.",
        "Bo: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shortchange you, Nat.",
        "Natalie: This is about a whole lot more than running into John McBain every day. This is about the rest of my life and what I'm going to do with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What's the problem?",
        "Marty: The problem is you're being rude. You know, I do you a favor by le see the report, I tell you I'm not done with it yet, and you proceed to tell me that it's \"not helpful, generic.\"",
        "John: Bartender? Could I get whatever you have on draft? Actually, make that a whiskey, and if the lady would like something \u0096",
        "Bartender: Another cosmo?",
        "Marty: Yes, please.",
        "John: All right, I didn't mean to insult you.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Well, what are you like when you are being insulting?",
        "John: I shouldn't have used the word \"generic,\" admittedly, all right, but, look, psych profiling ain't going to help me catch this guy. It's not a reflection of your work.",
        "Marty: Apology accepted.",
        "John: I didn't apologize. I just wanted you to know it wasn't personal. Thanks.",
        "Marty: Thank you. Well, you're obviously agitated about something.",
        "John: I am?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: \"Agitated\"?",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: My brother, Mike, I think he's gotten himself into something.",
        "Marty: Have you tried to talk to him about it?",
        "John: He won't -- he won't open up to me.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "John: Yeah, I know, I don't open up, either, but then again, we're not talking about me, are we?",
        "Marty: We could.",
        "John: You think I could take a look at that report you did?",
        "Marty: Well, now, I don't see why you would want to, seeing as it's just worthless.",
        "John: I didn't use the word \"worthless,\" all right? I didn't say that. And it might be able to help me somewhere down the line.",
        "Marty: Fine. Knock yourself out.",
        "John: All right, let's see. I'm just learning how to use lower-case letters, so this may take a while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I came to Chicago so you wouldn't have to look for your son alone.",
        "Todd: Fine, you're here now. I guess you might as well stay.",
        "Blair: Good, because I have no intention of leaving until you get the answers that you're looking for. Do you mind if I take a look at the photo of your child?",
        "Todd: Be my guest.",
        "Blair: He's beautiful, Todd. Kind of looks like Jack, you know, around the mouth.",
        "Todd: He doesn't look anything like Jack.",
        "Blair: Well, just because you don't think so --",
        "Todd: You don't think so, either.",
        "Blair: Yes, I do.",
        "Todd: Don't try to make me feel something to this kid. Don't force me into some kind of connection with somebody. I recognize nothing, I see nothing. I don't care about this kid. I feel nothing.",
        "Blair: Maybe you should look at it again. Maybe you would see it.",
        "Todd: The only thing I'm going to see is the truth -- I am not going to recognize my own son when I see him in the flesh. I failed this kid. I failed him when Spencer took him, I'm failing him now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I was thinking about a lot of things, but mostly I'm upset about the baby.",
        "Layla: Oh, my God -- Evangeline told you?",
        "Cristian: Told me what? Wait, what do you think Evangeline told me?",
        "Layla: I must have misunderstood. What baby were you talking about?",
        "Cristian: Jamie. I know she's older, but to us, she's still the baby.",
        "Layla: Why are you worried about her?",
        "Cristian: She got hit by a car. She's in the hospital.",
        "Layla: Cristian, I'm so sorry. Is she going to be ok?",
        "Cristian: Well, the doctors say she's out of danger, so yeah, I think she's going to be fine.",
        "Layla: Wow, Antonio and Jessica must be out of their minds. R.J. and Carlotta, too. Thank God she's ok. If there's anything that I could do -- please give Jamie my love and tell her I'll be there to see her soon.",
        "Cristian: Ok. I will, thanks.",
        "Layla: Yeah. No wonder you were so upset.",
        "Cristian: Well, actually, I -- i saw the whole thing. It happened right there. It was pretty horrible.",
        "Layla: I can't even imagine.",
        "Cristian: So what was this thing about Evangeline that you were going to tell me?",
        "Layla: Oh, it's nothing. It's not important. I better go. See you later.",
        "Cristian: Oh, Layla -- wait. Come on, I saw the look on your face.",
        "Layla: Cristian, just forget I even said anything.",
        "Cristian: You said something about a baby --",
        "Layla: Forget it, Cristian!",
        "Cristian: Wait a minute. Is Evangeline pregnant?",
        "Layla: Cristian, this is a conversation you need to have with her. See you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: There's nothing to talk about, Vincent, because everything is fine. It's really just fine. [Phone rings] [Ringing stops] It's not important.",
        "Vincent: Right. Hey, are there any new leads on the arson case?",
        "Evangeline: No. But Bo and his men are working on it around the clock. Look, I saw the press conference you had in Angel Square on the news. It was impressive.",
        "Vincent: Shaun's grandparents were targeted by these racist bastards. Now, I want them caught now more than ever.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, so do I, because no one is safe while those maniacs are on the loose.",
        "Vincent: Including you.",

        "Jordan: Why don't we get started?",
        "Miles: All right.",
        "Jordan: Ooh, ooh, wait, wait. Not so fast. The first step to pleasuring a woman in bed is making her want to go to bed.",
        "Miles: Oh, I see.",
        "Jordan: It's called the art of seduction.",
        "Miles: Huh.",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Jordan: Dance with me?",
        "Miles: Ok.",
        "Jordan: Hmm. There you go. Ok, now rub your hand up and down my back -- slow, slow. Good. Bring me closer. Miles, you have amazing instincts. You're gentle, you're sweet, and extremely handsome.",
        "Miles: Yeah -- I didn't always l way.",
        "Jordan: Hmm. All that matters is what you are right now. Miles, what do your instincts tell you to do now?",

        "Asa: You had better not be trying to hustle Nora out of my home, Clint.",
        "Clint: What, and miss the pleasure of her company?",
        "Nora: You know, you need to say that like you mean that or I'm never going to leave.",

        "Asa: Now, that's talking, honey.",
        "Clint: You know --",

        "Clint: I love having you and Matthew here, and when you're gone, I'm going to miss you and I mean that.",

        "Renee: Ooh, I will, too, and I don't even want to think about it.",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "Asa: Neither do I. I'd like this house filled with family, and that young Matthew.",
        "Renee: He is such a joy to have around.",
        "Nora: Unless he's in one of his moods, and then all he does is argue with me constantly.",
        "Asa: Of course he argues. The boy is as smart as a whip. He knows exactly what he wants and he knows how to get it.",
        "Nora: And stubborn too. He gets that from his father, I suspect.",
        "Clint: Yeah, and I suspect that you're right, too. And he gets it from his father, like we all do.",

        "Bo: Do you know what you want to do now?",
        "Natalie: I know what I don't want to do. I don't want to waste any more time, you know, sitting around here shoveling papers and answering the phone. And I blew it with the forensics program, so my opportunity -- my opportunities here are challenged, to say the least. That's why I want out.",
        "Bo: See, I wish I could convince you to wait just a little bit longer.",
        "Natalie: You can't. And I wouldn't change my mind, either.",
        "Bo: Ok, then. Um -- all you have to do is fill this out, clear out your desk, and go. I'm going to miss you around here.",
        "Natalie: I'm going to miss this place, but I'm especially going to miss you.",
        "Evangeline: We have to stop this hate group before they target anybody else.",
        "Vincent: Amen. But I just can't sit back and watch these people strike again. I've got to do something about it. It's in my blood.",

        "Marty: Well, you just seem a little snarkier than usual.",
        "John: Is \"snarkier\" a clinical term?",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm, if it fits. Have you seen Natalie lately?",
        "John: Why would you say that?",
        "Marty: It's just there's something bothering you, but obviously you wouldn't want to open up to me about that, now, would you?",

        "Todd: There's no point.",
        "Blair: Of course there is, Todd. I mean, the more I look at it, the more I totally see Jack and Starr. I swear, if I had a picture of them, a baby picture, and we lined them up, you would see it. I mean, look at that. That's kind of --",
        "Todd: Stop it!",
        "Blair: Just look at the picture, Todd. Why don't you want to look at it?",
        "Todd: Because when I see it, I see something I don't want to see. I see someone I don't want to see.",
        "Blair: Margaret?",
        "Todd: Ding, ding, ding, ding. [Todd sighs] I just don't want to be reminded that his mother is -- and given that genetics plays a big part in how a kid turns out --",
        "Blair: Hey, hey, hey. Did not happen that way for me. It's your kid, Todd. It's your son.",
        "Todd: That just doesn't make it any better for me.",
        "Blair: You'll get -- you give this baby all the love that you can.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, then he'll just be happy-go-lucky and lead a rich and productive and successful life. That's -- you know, that's not necessarily true. I want you to take a good, hard, long look at that picture, tell me what you see. I know you don't see Starr and Jack in that baby. You see Margaret.",

        "Vincent: You are better than this place. You are better than this job. This is something that I always knew about you, Nat.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, ok.",
        "Vincent: What? You telling me you're having some sort of doubt?",
        "Natalie: I don't know, maybe I could just go back to school. And I could become a nuclear physicist. Wait, no. I don't know anything about quantum mechanics. I know. I'll go to Julliard. I'll become a concert pianist. Oh, oh, no, no. I don't know how to read music.",
        "Vincent: You know, that's real funny. So this is your way of telling me that you do not have another job?",
        "Natalie: You're very perceptive.",
        "Vincent: Good. Great. I'm happy that you do not have another job! Ok, Nat, you have your whole head of you. Once you set your mind to something, you can do whatever you want. Look at you. You're young, you're ambitious, you're intelligent. You're beautiful. And you're talented.",

        "John: Yeah, well, Cole, he's a good kid.",
        "Marty: I'm just really glad he feels comfortable around you.",
        "John: Well, sometimes, it's easier to talk to another guy than it is to talk to, you know, your mom.",
        "Marty: Yes, that's true. And I actually didn't have anyone to talk to. I mean, if Cole knew some of the things that I did at his age --",
        "John: He probably doesn't need to know that. And honestly, neither do I.",
        "Marty: Well, I wasn't going to share the details with you, so don't worry. I just -- suffice it to say, there's just a few moments I'm not proud of.",
        "John: Most teenagers have those moments.",
        "Marty: Even you? No -- you know, I'm sorry. I am not going to ask you to open up.",
        "John: There's nothing to open up about. I -- I didn't really get the chance to be a teenager.",

        "Blair: Just look at this. I see hope, promise, possibilities that are in all newborns.",
        "Todd: Well, that's all very touching, but let's say we do find him. How am I supposed to tell him how he came to be? And if he knew the truth about that, I just don't know. I don't know that he'd be so -- so full of hope. And that worries me.",
        "Blair: You're worried that you're not going to be able to find him?",
        "Todd: No, that I think he'd be better off if we didn't.",

        "Cristian: Damn it, Evangeline, it's me. This is the 10th time I've -- hey. I've been calling you like crazy. I know you got my messages, so you must know I talked to Layla, right?",

        "Vincent: Oh, yeah. I expect that from those people.",
        "Bo: So what can I do for you?",
        "Vincent: Well, actually, Commissioner, it's not what you can do for me. It's what I can do for you.",

        "Asa: Why the hell did he call you? What's the big deal?",
        "Renee: Asa! The Palace Hotel is a respectable hotel. And I have a reputation to uphold there, all right? I'm going. See you all later. Bye-bye. Oh, Natalie, darling, I'm on the rush on the way out. I hope you're here when I get back. I'll see you later. Bye.",

        "Natalie: Me? I'm great. I'm very happy for Jamie. Although I'm still pissed at you for hurting mom. But that's not why I'm here. I need to speak with Grandpa. Alone, if you don't mind.",

        "Marty: When your father died, you had once told me that you became the man of the house.",
        "John: Yeah, and I didn't handle it all that well. Mike and me, we had a tough relationship back then. My mom wasn't around much because she had to work all the time.",
        "Marty: Tough growing up without a dad.",
        "John: It can be. Cole's in the same boat.",
        "Marty: I know. And he's struggling so hard to make up for using the steroids and pushing himself. You know, just to make up for everything and --",
        "John: Goes out of his way to protect you.",
        "Marty: I know. Hmm. Then there's the whole thing with Starr.",
        "John: Hey, look -- you know, bottom line, having seen, you know, your relationship with your son -- you know, I'm guessing things are going to turn out better for him than they did for me.",
        "Marty: Do you have any regrets?",
        "John: I don't know if you can have regrets about things you can't control.",
        "Marty: That's the truth. Yeah, you just learn from them, let go of the guilt, and move on.",
        "John: \"Move on\" -- I hate that expression, you know? I don't know if I even believe in moving on. In my book, it's -- it's next to impossible.",

        "Todd: No, that's because of you, not because of me. I mean, if we do find this kid and I have to raise him by myself --",
        "Blair: You're not going to be by yourself, Todd. You'll have Viki, you'll have her whole family. There are going to be so many people watching that baby. And just because we're not living together or married, doesn't mean we're going to stop raising our kids.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know, but --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: With this baby -- well, you're never going to be there, and I can be a -- you know, I can be a jerk, which is fine. I don't mind being like that with adults, but when it comes to being like that around kids, I -- you know, if I'm a bastard around this kid --",
        "Blair: Ok, ok, you know what? Ok, you got your faults. I'll admit that. But one thing you aren't, and that's a bad father. You are a wonderful father. You always have been. You're kind, you're caring. And I wouldn't want our children raised by any other man.",

        "Bo: And what is it that you think you can do for me, Vincent?",

        "Bo: Vincent, I do appreciate your offer. But I think that you should leave it to the Llanview P.D. Now, I know you want these guys. I want them, too. But see, I want to make sure that these charges stick. I want them to guarantee a conviction.",
