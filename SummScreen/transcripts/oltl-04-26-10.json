        "Marty is distraught to have lost her baby regardless of who pushed her. Cole tells Starr he knows that her father did it. She asks him how he can assume that without proof. Hannah reveals to Cole that she knows who pushed Marty. Kelly and John notice that Rodney travelled all the way from the California hospital to find her and tell her who killed her mother and somebody killed him. And they assume it's the same person who killed her mother. Langston and Ford are making out assuming they are alone in the high school gym when Destiny sees them. They don't know that and Langston continues to play her \"role\" with Markko. But Destiny informs Matthew what she saw and admits she had problems playing Langston in the school musical now that she knows she's a hypocrite."

        "Blair: Brendan...Kelly has no idea how much I miss you, baby boy.",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair?",
        "Blair: I...I didn't hear you come in.",
        "T\u00e9a: You okay?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I'm fine. Happy hour doesn't start until 5.",
        "T\u00e9a: I wish I were here for happy hour. Um...I came here because I need to talk to you. I...I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole and I need to focus on raising our daughter. So whatever you need, or think you need, it's not even a close third. Are we clear?",
        "Hannah: Message received.",
        "Cole: Hey, guys. What's wrong?",
        "Starr: Hannah just stopped by to say hello.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Starr: What happened at the hospital? How's your mom?",
        "Cole: Lucky to be alive.",
        "Starr: I didn't know the fall was that bad.",
        "Cole: It might not have been if someone hadn't pushed her down the stairs.",
        "Starr: Someone pushed her? Who?",
        "Cole: Your father.",
        "Starr: Okay, wait. What are you talking about?",
        "Cole: Your father pushed her down a flight of stairs! And now her baby and John's is dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Marty, I'm... I'm so sorry about the baby. Look, I know I'm the last person that you want to see right now, but I had to come. I needed to see you face-to-face because you need to know that...I didn't do this. I didn't send you down those stairs. And I know that I said some horrible things to you the last time we saw each other, and I'm not proud of it, but I would never hurt you or the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Going somewhere?",
        "Brody: Manning's not talking.",
        "John: Funny. He had plenty to say to Marty before she went down those stairs yesterday. You're a real tough guy when you're talking to her. But now you got nothing to say. Why is that? Because Brody's harder to push than a pregnant woman? Hmm?",
        "Todd: I'm not talking because I've got nothing to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Destiny. What's wrong? You don't look so hot.",
        "Destiny: Must be butterflies, that's all.",
        "Matthew: You're telling me. I'm clueless about playing Markko--I mean, loving Langston and everything. We should go over those scenes.",
        "Destiny: No, you can't go in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: So you forgive me? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make fun of Markko. I just couldn't help it. I was jealous.",
        "Langston: I know.",
        "Ford: So you forgive me?",
        "Langston: Yes, I forgive you, but I'll be mad all over again if someone catches you in here. Now, you have to go. Rehearsal's about to start.",
        "Ford: Okay, one more kiss, just to hold me over until the next time I see you. I miss you so much when I'm not with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I don't get it. Why can't I go in there?",
        "Destiny: Because someone's in there.",
        "Matthew: It's a school gym. There's room for more than one person.",
        "Destiny: It is more than one person. It's two people.",
        "Matthew: So?",
        "Destiny: Well, they're kind of making out.",
        "Matthew: It's Dani and Nate, isn't it? They're kissing.",
        "Nate: Caught you. Talking about us. Something about us kissing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You need my help. Why?",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, you know, my daughter's playing your daughter in a school play.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I know that. Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Um...uh, Dani thought that somehow by playing Starr, she'd be able to really stick it to Todd, and Todd thought so, too, until I convinced him otherwise. I convinced him that playing Starr might help Daniella to really understand him better.",
        "Blair: How'd you pull that one off?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I told Todd that by playing Starr and talking through and thinking through all the horrible things he's done, and by understanding his reasons for having done them, she may be able to come to terms with who her father is.",
        "Blair: So you need my help... why?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um, well, now I think I might've been wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What happened yesterday? Words didn't cut it? Marty came back strong? You need to show her that she's still the victim? Is that why you did it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Oh, God. Oh, my God, he's dead. He's dead. Oh, my God. John. John, pick up. Pick up. For God's sakes, answer your phone.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Todd: That's not mine. It must be one of yours. You want to get that?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "John: You couldn't stand to see her happy, could you? You hate the fact that she's able to move on after what you did to her. You didn't get to raise Starr's baby with Marty, so you couldn't let her have this one, either. Is that why you did it? Is that why you did it?",
        "Todd: Shut up. Just shut the hell up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: John told me that you think that I did this. Marty, the only reason I was there yesterday was to apologize to you for the things I said. And you know, you didn't want to hear it, and you ran off. But I swear to you, I didn't push you down those stairs. I didn't even see what happened. By the time I got to the stairwell, you had already fallen. It wasn't me. Okay? I know, I know, I have a big mouth, and sometimes I say the wrong thing, but this I wouldn't do. Okay. I'll go. I just-- [Sniffles] I want you to know that I'm really sorry about all of it. The baby and...and the things that I said to you about John.",
        "Marty: Did you come here to apologize today or to see if it was true?",
        "Natalie: To see if what's true?",
        "Marty: To see if the baby really was the only reason John was with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I'm gonna go.",
        "Cole: Hannah, where are you going?",
        "Hannah: I came here to talk to you, but obviously, you and Starr need some privacy. I'm really sorry about your mom's baby.",
        "Starr: Okay. Why do you think my father would push your mom down a flight of stairs?",
        "Cole: I don't think it. I know it.",
        "Starr: Did she see him do it? Why would he do something like that?",
        "Cole: No. No. No. Because someone pushed her from behind. Okay? But she knows it was your dad and so do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Okay. Now you have to go.",
        "Ford: Okay. Okay.",
        "Langston: Go behind the stage so no one sees you.",
        "Ford: I wish I didn't have to leave you. I'm just glad we're not fighting anymore.",
        "Langston: Me, too. Now, get out of here.",
        "Ford: Can't help it. You're so hot. I'm kind of into you.",
        "Langston: Well, then you can wait until later.",
        "Ford: Seriously, you're into me, too, right? No more fighting?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Uh, I don't know what you guys think you heard, but we were just talking about the play.",
        "Nate: Some heavy stuff in there.",
        "Destiny: Hot and heavy.",
        "Nate: Dani and I actually went over our scenes last night. It really helped, right, Dani?",
        "Markko: Heads up. Coming through.",
        "Destiny: Wait, wait, wait. You can't go in there. No! Wait, wait, no!",
        "Markko: Langston?",
        "Langston: Markko?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: How did this happen? How did this happen? Did someone get past security and do this? It's going to be okay. It's going to be all right. I have to reach John. I have to reach John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hit a nerve?",
        "Todd: Hardly.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Todd: I think someone wants to talk to you. A lot more than I do, anyway. I don't see a warrant. And I don't see either of you arresting me, so... you don't have anything, do you? You got no evidence. You got nothing.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Brody: Don't go far.",
        "John: McBain.",
        "Kelly: Oh, thank God you answered. Rodney's here in my office. John, he's dead.",
        "John: Okay, look, don't touch anything until I get there.",
        "Brody: What's up?",
        "John: I gotta go, all right? But Manning's wrong about one thing. We got evidence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: If your mom didn't see who pushed her, then how are you so sure that it was my dad?",
        "Cole: Because I found him looking at my mom's chart.",
        "Starr: Okay, I understand that that would be a little weird, but I--",
        "Cole: He just wanted to make sure that the baby was finished off.",
        "Starr: Finished off? Cole, are you serious?",
        "Cole: Look, why else would he be looking at my mom's chart?",
        "Starr: I have no idea, but that doesn't mean that he would want to hurt her...",
        "Cole: Your dad's life mission is to hurt my mom!",
        "Starr: Okay, I know that he has done terrible things in the past, Cole, but why this? Why would it be now?",
        "Cole: He's never stopped hating my mom or me. And now he thinks that I'm cheating on you with Hannah. The guy's out of control now.",
        "Starr: I know that he was mad at you, but why--",
        "Cole: Starr! You don't get it! He tried to shove me around. That didn't work. Then he tried to bully you into breaking up with me--that didn't work. So then he went looking for his favorite punching bag--my mom. And he found her. In her office. And right before she went down those stairs, your dad told my mom to take me and that kid and disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: These fibers were in the stairwell where I found Marty last night. I want you to get them examined.",
        "Brody: I'm on it.",
        "John: All right. Do me a favor--don't tell anybody until we know more, all right?",
        "Brody: Yeah. I'll let you know as soon as I hear from the lab.",
        "John: One more favor, all right? Can you--can you tell Marty I got called away on a police emergency? I'll be with her as soon as I can.",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "John: Thanks, Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay. I deserve that. But no, that's not why I came here. I'm not trying to find out if what I said yesterday was true. I... I didn't mean it, Marty.",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] And I wish to God I hadn't said it, and I wish to God you hadn't heard it, because I know it was really hurtful.",
        "Marty: Yeah, it was.",
        "Natalie: It doesn't matter what I say, though. You're just gonna keep thinking that I did this, aren't you?",
        "Marty: I didn't say that.",
        "Natalie: So you believe me? You believe that I didn't do this?",
        "Marty: Oh, God, Natalie, it's always about you, isn't it? I don't know who pushed me and I don't know why. All I know is that yesterday, I was having a baby, and now I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: What are you doing here so early?",
        "Langston: I was just regrouping before rehearsal. What are you doing here?",
        "Markko: I wanted to set everything up before telling you.",
        "Langston: Telling me what?",
        "Mr. G: Hey, Markko. Glad you could make it. Guys, Markko has an announcement to make.",
        "Markko: Yeah. I'm making a video of \"Starr X'd Lovers\" from rehearsal to final curtain.",
        "Matthew: What do you mean, a video?",
        "Dani: Like a documentary?",
        "Destiny: Are we gonna be on TV?",
        "Markko: No. No. I'm doing it for Langston. It's not every day my girlfriend's musical gets produced, and I wanted to make a video diary so she'll never forget it.",
        "Mr. G: Okay, leads, let's get started. We're gonna mark through some of the more dramatic material today, so get ready.",
        "Langston: I can't believe you would do that for me.",
        "Markko: Why not? I'm way proud of you, babe. And I love you, you freak. Nobody loves you like I do.",
        "Mr. G: Nate and Dani, I haven't been able to recast the Todd and Blair roles yet, so you're stuck with me playing Todd again. And I want to work on some of the Todd/Starr scenes.",
        "Dani: Again?",
        "Mr. G: Would you rather we didn't?",
        "Dani: No. I'll be okay.",
        "Mr. G: Good, because they're pretty important. I think we need to see where Todd's coming from, all right?",
        "Dani: Sure. But I can't promise I'll be feeling the love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know what I think? I think you worry too much, T\u00e9a. I think your first instinct was right. Of course Dani being a part of this play has gotta bring her closer to Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know, but--",
        "Blair: You know... that kind of stuff really helped me when I was in foster care.",
        "T\u00e9a: What kind of stuff?",
        "Blair: Well, I don't know. We--they would do, like, these art therapy things, programs, and sometimes it might be just writing down things that were personal. Other days was maybe acting out scenes that we got to express how we felt. It was a tough time for me, and at first I thought, \"you know what? I'm probably gonna hate it. It'll be stupid,\" or whatever, but...you know, it actually allowed me to express myself and...I think it probably saved my life. And I know-- I know it got me in touch with all my music.",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't know that.",
        "Blair: Well, there is a lot you probably don't know about me, T\u00e9a. Do you know what? I thought Langston's play was fair. And it was good and actually real. And I think she will walk away with a better understanding of her father.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I--I agree, but what if that happens? What if Daniella opens up and starts to understand her father and then he does... he gives her another reason to hate him?",
        "Blair: Did Todd do something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You don't get to clear your conscience and wipe your slate clean so that you can leave here and your life can be the same. You can run around after someone else's boyfriend or whatever it is that you do to fill your time because my life will never be the same. I had a baby growing inside of me. Little opportunity. You know, 3 months I had finally just allowed myself to believe it was real. I started wondering if it was gonna be a boy or a girl. I was wondering if it was gonna look like my son Cole or John or even Hope, how maybe it'd play the piano like me or...sports like Cole. Play at hiding its... heart...like John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Hey.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Kelly: I'm sorry. I'm just totally freaking out. I don't know what's going on. I don't know how it happened or if someone did this to Rodney. I knew he was dead when I saw him. I knew right away. I wanted to wait until I got in touch with you before I called 911.",
        "John: You found him like this?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. No, he was alive. He came to me. He wanted to talk to me. Turns out he can talk, just like you thought.",
        "John: Yeah? What'd he say?",
        "Kelly: That my mother was murdered.",
        "John: Did he say anything else?",
        "Kelly: No. He was scared. He wanted to talk to you. I tried calling you, but you didn't answer your phone, so I told him we'd find you. You know? When I came back here from getting my car, this is how I found him. I shouldn't have left him alone.",
        "John: It's okay. You couldn't help it.",
        "Kelly: What happened to him, John?",
        "John: No signs of foul play.",
        "Kelly: Just like my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I was gonna take John to my next appointment to hear the heartbeat. Except after I fell, he was there and the doctor was looking for the heartbeat. And the nurse, she couldn't find it. It's gone. John never really... oh, God! How could I have been so full of life one minute... and so empty the next?",
        "[Marty crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My dad said he wanted your mom gone and for you and her baby to disappear?",
        "Cole: Yeah, he really said that. He really said a lot of things. And then he throws her down a flight of stairs. Starr, your dad has lost it.",
        "Starr: I--I can't--I can't believe this.",
        "Cole: What do you--what do you mean?",
        "Starr: I don't--I don't know.",
        "Cole: You think that I'm making this up or my mom is?",
        "Starr: No, of course I don't think that, Cole.",
        "Cole: Okay, then what can't you believe?",
        "Starr: I can't believe that my father would push your mother down a flight of stairs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. G: Starr, I've hurt a lot of people in my life, some of them on purpose. I never meant to hurt you. I made mistakes, a lot of them, but does that make me bad all the time? Does that make me a bad father? Does loving you too much make me a bad father? Do you know that I loved you the minute I laid eyes on you?",
        "Todd: So who the hell are you?",
        "Dani: You're the one raising hell out here.",
        "Todd: Is this how you talk to strangers?",
        "Dani: Yeah, when they're acting like jerks.",
        "Mr. G: You were feisty, stubborn, and beautiful. I gave you my heart at that moment. You've had it ever since. Please...look at me. No matter what I've done, Starr, I love you. I always will. I'd die for you. You can push me away, you can hate me, but I will always be your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You didn't come here to talk about Dani. You came here to talk about Todd, didn't you? What? What is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: You haven't heard about Marty?",
        "Blair: No. What happened?",
        "Ford: Hey, Blair?",
        "Blair: Uh, we're closed.",
        "Ford: I just need a minute.",
        "Blair: Well, you're not getting one, okay?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you know what? Talk to him. I gotta take this.",
        "Blair: No, I don't want to-- what?",
        "T\u00e9a: Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. G: I just hope you'll find a way to love me. Do you think you ever will?",
        "Dani: Dad...",
        "Mr. G: You're my daughter. You're my flesh and blood. And nothing either of us does will ever change that. Nothing will ever change how I feel about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You just don't want to believe it.",
        "Starr: Of course I don't want to believe it. What you're saying that my dad might have done is horrible.",
        "Cole: Might have? He's already done it. He had no trouble pushing you down the stairs when you were pregnant.",
        "Starr: That was an accident and this could be, too.",
        "Cole: Did he rape my mom by accident? Hold her captive by accident and let me and John think that she was still dead?",
        "Starr: Okay, what does John have to say about this? Huh? He's gonna investigate, right?",
        "Cole: Yeah, he and Brody are working on it. And they're gonna find out your dad's guilty.",
        "Starr: How can you be so sure?",
        "Cole: Because it's obvious.",
        "Starr: Don't you want to gather all the facts before you start jumping to conclusions and accusing people?",
        "Cole: You're taking your dad's side?",
        "Starr: No, Cole, I'm not taking his side, okay?",
        "Cole: Yes, you are!",
        "Starr: You know what? I can't deal with this right now, okay? I have to get to school. Cole-- God, I know that you're upset that your mom lost her baby. I am, too. I know how that feels. We both do. But neither of us know what happened, okay, and we won't, not until there's proof.",
        "Cole: So what you're saying is that my mom's a liar and that your dad's innocent?",
        "Starr: Oh, my God, no, Cole, I'm not saying anything, okay? It's just that it would be different if someone saw him do it, but I don't even know what to think yet. I'm sorry. I have to go. Oh, my God.",

        "Brody: Everything okay in here?",
        "Marty: It's fine.",
        "Brody: John wanted you to know that he got called away on emergency but he'll be back as soon as he can.",
        "Marty: Oh, thank you.",
        "Brody: Are you... Marty, is there anything I can do?",
        "Marty: Yes. You can go. Go. Go, go, go, and take her with you. I just need to be alone.",

        "Hannah: Cole? Are you okay?",
        "Cole: No.",
        "Hannah: I have to talk to you. Um...I waited for Starr to leave because I have to talk to you about something.",
        "Cole: Sorry, this is just a really bad time. I can't focus on anything but my mom.",
        "Hannah: It's about your mom.",
        "Cole: What about her?",
        "Hannah: I couldn't tell you while Starr was here.",
        "Cole: Tell me what?",
        "Hannah: Cole, I was there yesterday at your mom's office when she fell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yes, Mrs. Stevens, I understand. Of course very sorry for your loss. We'll be in touch. They found out he was missing last night.",
        "Kelly: Why didn't she call the police?",
        "John: They did. The police had been canvassing the area around the sanitarium. She couldn't believe that he made it all the way here. He didn't have any money. She didn't know how he was able to travel. He apparently hadn't been outside that place unaccompanied in years.",
        "Kelly: And this is what happens to him.",
        "John: Yeah, well, life can be pretty cruel. Stevens, she was--she was pretty torn up.",
        "Kelly: Did she say whether or not Rodney was sick?",
        "John: No. She said he was in good health.",
        "Kelly: Just like my mother. He knew who killed her, John. But he wanted you to be there before he said anything. You know, he came all this way, he went through who knows what, so my mother could have justice and I could have some peace.",
        "John: Whoever killed your mother found out Rodney was here...and killed him to keep him quiet.",
        "John: Okay. Thanks. All right, don't touch that, all right? The EMTs are on their way. CSI's gonna see what they can-- see what they can get. What is this?",
        "Kelly: That's his baseball card. You think that's some kind of clue?",
        "[John sniffs]",
        "John: I gave Rodney my card. I gave him my card in case... he needed to call me.",
        "Kelly: John, can I ask why didn't you answer your phone? I mean, did you even get any of my messages?",
        "John: I... Marty--we lost the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I want to reserve a corner table for tonight. Lots of privacy. I'm bringing somebody special.",
        "Blair: Yeah? And who would that be?",
        "Ford: And that's your business because--",
        "Blair: If it's Langston, I will slap you silly and that's just a start.",
        "Ford: Relax. The Langston thing's over. You warned me and I listened.",
        "Blair: Right. You listen to one thing and one thing only.",
        "Ford: I'm brining Alfonso del Toro here after he lectures at L.U.",
        "Blair: You need privacy and one of my premium tables for a crabby old professor?",
        "Ford: Del Toro's not a professor. He's one of the best and most sought-after directors working today.",
        "Blair: Oh, wow, I'm sorry. I'm out of the loop. So it's just gonna be the two of you?",
        "Ford: Yeah. Bottle service and whatever perks come with.",
        "Blair: The bottle.",
        "Ford: Right. Okay. How about a bouncer, too? I don't want any paparazzi or fans bugging this guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I can't believe this.",
        "Matthew: I can. You're the best thing that's happened to me in a really long time, Langston. I love you.",
        "Destiny: I can't believe how much I like the way that sounds.",
        "Matthew: It's okay. You don't have to say it back. I know that some things take time.",
        "Destiny: I want to say it. I really want to say it. I love you, Markko. I do.",
        "Markko: You made me the happiest guy alive that day, and you keep doing it every day. That was awesome, you guys.",
        "Matthew: Thank you.",
        "Mr. G: Really nice work, guys. Matthew, I thought you perfectly captured the character's sincerity--Markko's willingness to put it all on the line for this girl. Something wrong, Destiny?",
        "Destiny: Um, I'm just working out the kinks in my character.",
        "Mr. G: Well, you know, it was a good start. I want you to think about Langston's vulnerability. You know? She's lost both her parents. She's gotten used to being alone in the world, and along comes this guy who says, \"hey, no matter what, I'm here for you.\" Now, Langston wants to believe him, but it's a real leap of faith for her. And that's what makes this scene poignant. Make sense?",
        "Destiny: [Sighs] Yeah.",
        "Mr. G: You can do it. All right. Good job. Let's take a 10-minute break.",
        "Matthew: Are you mad at Langston or something?",
        "Destiny: You bet I'm mad. I have to play Langston, the biggest hypocrite on the planet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Thank you for your consideration.",
        "Blair: Whatever.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hold on. You can't just give me the test results over the phone? No. Okay. Yes, yes, I understand. Policy is policy. So when should I come in? Today? Oh, okay. Okay. Well, I'll see you then. Thanks. Thank you.",
        "Blair: Everything all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, it's fine.",
        "Blair: All right, well, then let's get back to the matter at hand. Todd and what does he have to do with Marty Saybrooke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What were you doing in Marty's room?",
        "Natalie: I was making a bad situation worse.",
        "Brody: I'm sure you didn't mean to.",
        "Natalie: I don't know what I meant. You know, I...tried to convince myself that I was there to apologize to Marty, but I think in reality I was trying to convince her that I didn't do this, and I don't even think she believed me.",
        "Brody: Maybe she does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: That scene was intense. You were intense. It looked like you were really feeling it.",
        "Dani: Yeah. You know, the weirdest thing happened.",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Dani: I saw my father.",
        "Nate: You mean, you saw Mr. G as your father? That's awesome.",
        "Dani: No. I saw my dad as my dad. He was here at the door.",
        "Nate: That's who you were looking at like that.",
        "Dani: Like what?",
        "Nate: Like you were seeing him for the first time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, what are you doing here?",
        "Todd: I need to talk to you about something before Cole or John or anyone else gives you the wrong idea. Something just happened to Marty.",
        "Starr: Yeah. I know. Cole told me.",
        "Todd: Did he accuse me of pushing her down the stairs?",
        "Starr: Yeah, Dad. He did.",
        "Todd: And did you believe him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You were there?",
        "Hannah: I went to her office to make an appointment with her--for therapy, you know-- so I could get myself together.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and?",
        "Hannah: I saw her go to the elevator, but it was broken, so she decided to take the stairs. Oh, my God, this is all my fault.",
        "Cole: What--what happened?",
        "Hannah: I followed her into the stairwell and...",
        "Cole: Hannah. Hannah. What are you trying to say? Wh--why do you think it's your fault?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Hey.",
        "John: What?",
        "Kelly: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you lost the baby.",
        "John: Thanks. Marty's recovering.",
        "Kelly: How are you?",
        "John: You know me. I'm fine.",
        "Kelly: I know that you were looking forward to being a dad.",
        "John: I'm going to find whoever did this to Rodney.",
        "Kelly: You know, if it's the same person who killed my mother...",
        "John: That means her killer's in Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look at me. Did you push my mom down those stairs?",
        "Hannah: No! Cole, how could you even ask me that?",
        "Cole: Well, I just--I don't understand. I mean, you keep making it seem like it's your fault, but I don't know what to think. I mean, you went to her office, you followed her to the stairs. I mean, was that part true or not?",
        "Hannah: Yes. It was true! Okay? But I didn't push her. I swear.",
        "Cole: Okay, I believe you, but why do you keep making it sound like it's your fault? Obviously, you're holding something back. Hannah, just please tell-- just please tell me. Tell me the truth. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You think that Marty doesn't suspect me anymore?",
        "Brody: Yeah, it looks that way.",
        "Natalie: You got that from the 60 seconds you were in the room?",
        "Brody: No. When I questioned her before, she started to remember arguing with someone right before this happened to her, someone who's way more capable of doing this than you could ever be.",
        "Natalie: Who?",
        "Brody: Your uncle. Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I don't know what to believe about you and Marty.",
        "Todd: No. You don't think I actually did this, do you? You don't actually believe that I would push her down some stairs and make her lose her baby?",
        "Starr: Well, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I guess it was kind of like seeing my dad for the first time.",
        "Nate: It looked like you could maybe believe he really loves you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Marty fell down a flight of stairs last night outside her office.",
        "Blair: Was she all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't really know.",
        "Blair: What about the baby?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not sure.",
        "Blair: What does this have to do with Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, did you bring water?",
        "Mr. G: Langston, I have a question about this scene.",
        "Markko: Go do your thing, Shakespeare.",
        "Langston: There's a bottle of water in my bag.",
        "Markko: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: How is Langston a hypocrite?",
        "Destiny: Because she's pretending like she loves Markko. He's all into her and she's just using him.",
        "Matthew: Why do you think that?",
        "Destiny: Because she's the one I saw in here making out-- and it wasn't with Markko. It was some other dude.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I mean it. You were seamless in that scene with your dad. Not just technically, with the acting stuff, but, you know, I felt something. There was a lot going on in here.",
        "Dani: I felt something, too.",
        "Nate: So I'm right. What I saw was more than just some really decent acting.",
        "Dani: Guess so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, Starr. No. I didn't push Marty down the stairs. I didn't make her lose her baby. I wouldn't do that. I couldn't. I swear to you, I didn't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I think... Todd might have pushed Marty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm sorry I got the wrong idea, but if you won't tell me the whole story --look, just calm--calm down and tell me what's really going on.",
        "Hannah: I didn't push her. I didn't push her.",
        "Cole: Okay, then why are you so freaked out?",
        "Hannah: Why do you think? Because I saw who did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Honey, I know you love Cole. Whatever he told you, I didn't do it. Listen to me. I didn't hurt his mother. I swear on my life, I swear on all of my love for you, I didn't do it. Will you please tell me you believe me?"
