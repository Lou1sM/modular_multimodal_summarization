        "Starr: Uh -- Langston? Yeah, and don't worry. I won't talk to any boy. How does that sound? I'll move into a convent.",
        "Todd: That sounds terrific.",
        "Blair: You just have fun and stay away from Cole, ok?",
        "Starr: Yeah, like I didn't think of that. So, did you find out anything about the baby yet?",
        "Todd: We got a couple leads, but that's all.",
        "Starr: Ok. Well, be careful, all right? Because if you guys were gone, then I wouldn't have anyone to hassle me. Goodbye.",

        "Blair: So you think we're going to actually hear from Ms. Bromley at the adoption agency?",
        "Todd: Depends how interested she is in helping us. Or me.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm tired, but if I go back to my room, I'm going to -- I'm afraid I'm going miss her call, and I don't want to miss it.",

        "Britney: Well, I -- it's my stereo. I turned the music way up, hoping it would make me feel better. So how's my paper coming?",
        "Henry: Slow. But it's coming. It's too bad we had to miss Heather's sweet 16 party tonight.",

        "Britney: Oh, no, no, don't.",
        "Henry: Why not?",
        "Britney: Um -- well, it could be contagious. And I'd feel awful to give this cold to you. You know, my parents probably wouldn't let you in, anyway. They practically have me quarantined. Henry, thanks so much for helping me out with this paper. I don't know how I'll ever make it up to you, but I'll think of something, ok? I promise.",

        "Antonio: Oh. Is everything ok?",
        "Jessica: No, I -- everything's fine. I just -- I promised that I would check in on Clyde and help out at \"The Sun\" while Todd's in Chicago, and you know, they need me, so --",
        "Antonio: Ok. All right. Take as long as you need. I understand.",

        "Natalie: He was -- he was just here.",
        "Jessica: When?",
        "Natalie: A few minutes ago. I booted him out. I know that you don't want somebody like him bothering you right now.",
        "Jessica: Ok. Thanks for telling me. Yeah, I got to go now.",
        "Natalie: My sister is so stressed out, it's not even funny.",
        "John: Yeah, I can see that. So, what we were talking about before -- when did you quit the force?",
        "Natalie: Today, after we spoke.",
        "John: Was that why?",
        "Natalie: You think that I quit because of you?",
        "John: I don't know. Did you?",
        "Natalie: Believe it or not, my world doesn't revolve around you.",
        "John: I didn't say that it did. It's just one minute, we're talking in the locker room about how it's going to be difficult working together, and the next thing you know, you've quit. It's kind of a big coincidence.",
        "Natalie: You know that I haven't been happy there chained to a desk.",
        "John: You haven't been happy for a while. But you never walked.",
        "Natalie: I've been thinking about it.",
        "John: Why didn't you say something?",
        "Natalie: Do I need your permission?",
        "John: Maybe you thought I'd talk you out of it.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I thought maybe you'd try. I deserve more than a desk job, John. I deserve more.",
        "John: Agreed. You know, do you have any ideas what you're going to do next?",
        "Natalie: Actually, I've already got something.",
        "John: That was fast. What?",
        "Natalie: Family biz.",
        "John: What is that, \"The Banner\"?",

        "Evangeline: I can't believe you're asking me that, Cristian. I can't believe I'm even having this conversation about a child I may or may not be carrying.",
        "Cristian: It's a valid question, Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: How's this for a valid question, Cristian? Who told you I slept with Todd?",
        "Cristian: Nobody, but -- well, did you?",
        "Evangeline: I don't owe you an answer. But no. And that's something you can't say about you and Blair, now, is it?",
        "Cristian: No, wait a minute. We did that because we thought you and Todd slept together, that's --",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, well, I knew that you and Blair slept together, and I still didn't. You know what? Just get out. Just get out! I'm not wasting another breath trying to convince you of anything!",

        "Cristian: I'm sorry, I -- I'm sorry. I believe you. I know you wouldn't lie to me. Not about something like that. You know, Evangeline, if you are pregnant, you're pretty far along. Do you know what you're going to do?",

        "Britney: Go away.",
        "Langston: Oh, what's the matter? You don't want Henry here? Oh, wait, that's right. He's at home by himself writing your term paper while you're here pretending to be sick. I wonder what he'd do if he knew.",
        "Britney: He won't. Um -- Henry?",
        "Henry: What happened to you?",
        "Britney: I had to blow my nose. Look, I -- I really need to go. Ahem -- I should try and drag myself out of bed and turn the music down so I can go to sleep. Just -- ahem -- email me my paper when you finish with it, ok? Thanks so much, Henry. I'll never forget this. [Phone disconnects] Don't you have a body part to go pierce or something?",
        "Langston: You're actually promising poor Henry a visit with your coconuts in exchange for him writing your paper? That's low, even for you.",
        "Britney: Until me and him tell Mrs. McBain that you cheated your way through the midterm.",
        "Langston: I did not.",
        "Britney: Oh, who is she going to believe -- you, or me and everybody else?",
        "Langston: You hurt Henry, and I hurt you.",
        "Britney: Why would you even bother?",
        "Langston: Because I can. Are we having fun yet?",
        "Starr: What happened to you?",
        "Langston: Britney. Un-freaking-believable.",
        "Starr: What did she do now?",
        "Langston: She's got Henry sitting at home writing her paper, letting the poor dweeb think that she'll rotate his tires if he does.",
        "Starr: And he's going along with it?",
        "Langston: I know. I thought he was smart.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, sometimes, people do stupid like someone a lot.",

        "Vincent: The door was unlocked. And anyone could have walked right in.",
        "Layla: You know what? Adriana always forgets to lock the door, and it's fine. Nobody can get in the building without being buzzed up.",
        "Vincent: Hello? I did.",
        "Layla: Why? What are you doing here?",
        "Vincent: You know, I was downtown. And I was talking to the commissioner about this racist who's running around town. And I figured I'll check up on you, to make sure you're ok.",
        "Layla: I'm fine.",
        "Vincent: You and your sister have to take this guy seriously.",
        "Layla: You know what? Evangeline has a lot more on her mind right now than some lunatic firebug.",
        "Vincent: Then she needs to get her priorities straight. Because until they catch this chump, I'm telling you, neither one of you are safe.",
        "Layla: Why do you care so much?",
        "Evangeline: I'm not even thinking what my options are until I know if I have any options.",
        "Cristian: You haven't even given it a thought?",
        "Evangeline: Can you just stop pushing me, please? God! I'm sorry. Cristian, you don't deserve this.",
        "Cristian: It's ok, I get it. Hormones, right?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. That's if I am pregnant. If not, that excuse doesn't really hold up, does it?",
        "Cristian: Well, however the test comes out, I want you to know that I really do respect you, Evangeline. And I really did love you. And if -- well, if out of that love comes this baby, then -- well, you didn't do it alone.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, my god. What if I really am pregnant?",
        "Cristian: Well, if you are pregnant, and you want me to be a part of it, I'm right here.",

        "Natalie: All -- all I wanted to do was forensics, and I -- I've screwed that up.",
        "John: There are other things you could do besides being under Asa's thumb.",
        "Natalie: Would you give me a little more credit than that? Look, I told my grandfather, and he is so happy for me. He's got so many plans for me. And not just answering the phones. I mean, he's really going to teach me the business. Really making decisions, really making a difference.",
        "John: You're really excited about this.",
        "Natalie: Yes. Yes, I am. And -- ok, I admit maybe breaking with you was the kick in the pants that I needed. But taking this job for my grandfather has nothing to do with you. I came up with that one all on my own. I needed to make something happen with my own life.",
        "John: Ok. It's good then.",
