        "David: What's up?",
        "Viki: Oh, my goodness! What are you doing here? I thought you were in Los Angeles trying to become an actor.",
        "David: I'm not trying to become an actor. I am an actor. You're looking at the face of a spokesman for a national ad campaign. I owe it all to you. You're the one who encouraged me to \"follow my bliss.\"",
        "Viki: Oh, David, I just made the suggestion. You obviously did all the work.",
        "David: Eh --",
        "Viki: Well, come on. Tell me all about it. What's if for?",
        "David: Like you haven't seen it. It's on all the time.",
        "Viki: You know I don't watch a lot of television. Come on, have a seat. Tell me about it.",
        "David: Have a seat? Are you putting one over on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So this is it? Now that Stacy saved Shane's life, you're going to tell Rex the truth and it's okay for me to tell Jessica you and me never slept together?",
        "Gigi: Brody, you've already gone way above and beyond the call of duty. You deserve to be happy.",
        "Brody: So do you. Let me know how it goes with Rex, okay? If you need me to back you up --",
        "Gigi: It's okay.",
        "Brody: No. I don't mind, seriously. I owe the guy an apology. I might as well talk to him.",
        "Gigi: No, you can't.",
        "Brody: You are going to tell him the truth, aren't you?",
        "Gigi: I started to.",
        "Brody: Okay.",
        "Gigi: And then Shane had a sort of reaction to the transplant. It was really scary.",
        "Brody: Is he all right?",
        "Gigi: He's fine now, but it could have been bad. It happened because I went back on my word.",
        "Brody: To Stacy?",
        "Gigi: To God. I made a promise in a chapel and I have to keep it. I have to give up Rex.",
        "Brody: Since when are you so religious?",
        "Gigi: Well, look at in another way, then. Shane could have rejected the transplant. He still could, and then we'd have to ask Stacy to donate again. So, as much as I love Rex, he can never know that Stacy refused to save Shane's life unless I let him go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I am so done with you. Do you hear me? Your blood saved our grandson. I took what I needed from you and I got plenty more. I got enough stem cells to save that kid 20 times over if I have to, and that would have been the end of it. But you tried to whack me, so I do believe that you are more alive than you're letting on. So I'm not going to spend the rest of my life lying in bed at night, wondering if I'm going to wake up dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Okay, I know this is going to sound nuts, but it's a chance I'm going to have to take.",
        "Stacy: Schuy, what is that?",
        "Schuyler: Gee whiz, it looks like blood, doesn't it?",
        "Rex: Okay, and?",
        "Schuyler: I swear to you, I saw her throwing this away after she had supposedly donated it, stem cells and all, to your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, you seem a little hyper.",
        "Cole: No, no. I'm just a little nervous about our baby's DNA test, you know? How am I supposed to wait three days for the results.",
        "Starr: I know. I cannot believe I convinced myself that it was okay for me not to know how she died. You made me realize that it was always going to be in the back of my mind.",
        "Cole: What if, um -- what if the DNA test doesn't give us the answer?",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "Cole: I mean, what -- what if our baby didn't die because of genetics? What if she died of something else, right? Then we'd be right back from where we were before, not knowing. I mean, how -- what the hell do we do then, huh?",
        "Starr: Cole, are you sure that you're okay?",
        "Cole: Could you stop -- stop asking me that, okay? Stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Radio announcer: Llanview police are escalating their search for escaped prisoner, John McBain, the former FBI agent and Llanview detective. McBain was arrested for the attempted murder of his wife, Blair Cramer-McBain, and is suspected of three fatal stabbings.",
        "John: You don't have to do this.",
        "Marty: Why should we listen to that?",
        "John: I'm talking about aiding and abetting a fugitive. It's not too late to change your mind.",
        "Marty: We're both running, John. The only difference is you're running from the law and I'm running from a serial killer. As far as I'm concerned, aiding and abetting you, the person who's been on this maniac's case from the beginning, that's the smartest thing I can do.",
        "John: The department has safe houses that I can get you into.",
        "Marty: No, I want to help you find this guy.",
        "John: What about Cole?",
        "Marty: Well, if I go with you, I can stay in touch with him. I mean, I can't do that if I'm in a safe house, right?",
        "John: Maybe you should give him a call now.",
        "Marty: Wait a minute. What if the cops are monitoring my phone to track you?",
        "John: It's worth the risk. He'd probably like to hear your voice.",
        "Marty: Are you sure?",
        "John: Yeah. Don't worry. We'll be off the phone long before they can do anything.",
        "Marty: Okay. But I can't lie to him about this. You know, I need to tell him the truth about what's going on.",
        "John: You worried about how he'll handle it?",
        "Marty: Yes. I don't want to do something else that would make him turn to drugs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you. I'm just learning how to deal with stuff without pills, you know?",
        "Starr: Okay. We're in this together.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: We'll take it one step at a time, right? First, we get the test results and then we'll just take it from there, all right?",
        "Cole: Okay.",
        "Starr: Maybe we should go see a movie and take our minds off of everything, you know?",
        "Cole: You asking me out? Come on, let's get out of here.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Starr: You know what? You get that and I will pay the check.",
        "Cole: Hey, Mom, what's up?",
        "Marty: Hi, Cole. Um, look I need you to listen to me very carefully. I know you are going through a lot and I don't want to do anything that will make that worse, but --",
        "Cole: Mom, what's wrong?",
        "Marty: No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Really, I'm okay. It's just what I have to tell you, it's not going to be that easy to hear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Have you lost your mind? You stole a bag of blood from the hospital. Is that even legal?",
        "Schuyler: Stacy, this is yours and you know it.",
        "Stacy: Don't listen to him, Rex. He's crazy.",
        "Rex: Wait, you're saying that Stacy threw away her blood after she donated her stem cells. That doesn't make any sense.",
        "Schuyler: No, I know. I get it. You're skeptical, you don't even know me. That's fine. But Stacy and I go a long way back, okay? And I'm telling you, there's something -- there's something off about the donation that she made to your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So what's the problem? You didn't like me taking your blood to save our grandson? Is that why you tried to strangle me? Well, you know, you always were a little bit selfish. But it's too late, because Shane's going to live. You can hear me, can't you? I don't know how you do it. You make that machine do whatever you want it to do. So you may have fooled some other people, but you can't fool me. And I'm going to do what I should have done a long time ago. I'm going to pull your plug.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: All right, I'll bite. What do you think happened?",
        "Schuyler: I don't know. I don't know. But I think something went down between the time that the stem cells were collected and the time they were transfused into your son. I think you should look into it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Have-a-Seat? That's hilarious. What's the real product?",
        "David: That is the real product. Don't look at me like that. It's helped a lot of people, including me. I'm not just the spokesperson for Have-a-Seat, I'm also a client.",
        "Viki: I'm sorry, David. I'm really sorry. I'm sure it's a wonderful product.",
        "David: Would you please stop teasing me. I'm very vulnerable today.",
        "Viki: Why? What happened?",
        "David: Dorian. We're through. Kaput. It's the whole reason I'm here in town.",
        "Viki: Oh, David. Gee, I'm sorry.",
        "David: Well you're not going to win any acting awards.",
        "Viki: I'm -- I'm not sorry. Not at all. But has Dorian seriously given up trying to get Asa's money?",
        "David: I've given up on it. I just -- I can't do that to Bo.",
        "Viki: Oh, David, that's wonderful! Congratulations! Bravo! No wonder Dorian called it off.",
        "David: I know, you hate Dorian with the intensity of a thousand suns, and you want me all to yourself.",
        "Viki: David, I --",
        "David: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You love Charlie, I get it.",
        "David: What do you say you sneak me in while he's taking a shower. You'd be following your own bliss, and I promise, I won't tell another living soul, so help me a-list fame.",
        "Viki: A-list fame. You gave up following Buddha to follow celebrity. Whatever happened to exploring the spiritual side?",
        "David: Where was Buddha when I was being dumped?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: God gets a lot more real when you're praying for your kid's life. Brody, I'm afraid to go back to on my promise, especially now. It's like he heard me when I was trying to tell Rex about Stacy. Like he was teaching me a lesson by making Shane sick.",
        "Brody: I don't think that's how it works.",
        "Gigi: You weren't there.",
        "Brody: I understand that sometimes there's stuff that's bigger than us. I mean, after everything I went through in the middle east, I've got to believe that there's still a reason I'm still kicking and some of my buddies aren't.",
        "Gigi: Like maybe you're alive so you can be with Jessica. Two lost souls, finding happiness together.",
        "Brody: Are you sure about me telling her the truth?",
        "Gigi: Yes, of course. But please -- please just keep it to yourselves.",
        "Brody: I will.",
        "Gigi: Good luck.",
        "Brody: Hey, I don't know what's going to happen with me and Jessica, but I do know you and Rex were meant to be together. You're soul mates. I swear you are, okay? I'm just hope that one of these days --",
        "Gigi: Just go. Go. Go back in there and get your girl back.",
        "Brody: There are forces that are bigger than us. Those forces are going to show Rex who Stacy really is and what she did to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: If I could have found another match for Shane, I never would have needed your blood. And if Stacy hadn't figured out who the hell you were, I wouldn't have had to say that her blood was your blood and she never would have made that lousy deal with Gigi. So what I'm saying is it's all your fault. And if you hadn't tried to strangle me, I would have just walked right out of here, never to look back. How do I know that you're not going to jump out of that bed and try to hurt me, or Rex, or our grandkid? I already told Rex that I killed his father. I'm just finishing the job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I don't know what you're trying to do, Schuy. I saw you dumping this into the biohazard trash.",
        "Stacy: That's a lie.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, all right. You know what? No, you're right. You're right. My bad. I saw you dumping something into the biohazard trash, and you lied to me and told me that it was a used tissue. But it wasn't a used tissue that I found in the trash, Stace. It was this.",
        "Stacy: Rex, you saw me get my blood sucked out of me into that machine that saved Shane's life. You saw what I went through.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, all right. Okay, just so you know, the way those machines work is they harvest your stem cells, right? And then they cycle the blood back into your system. So what you dumped was not blood. It was stem cells.",
        "Stacy: Shane got my stem cells.",
        "Rex: My friend, Michael, is the doctor who collected them. He would have noticed if something was off.",
        "Schuyler: No. I know, and I can't exactly explain, and I know I'm out on a limb here, but I think somehow these cells did not make it to your son and some other cells did. And maybe -- maybe that's why she dumped it in the trash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So what's the deal, Brody? You keep on saying you wish you could tell me something and then Gigi shows up and insists that you tell me. This sounds really complicated.",
        "Brody: It is. But I'm hoping it's not too complicated for you to deal with.",
        "Jessica: So lay it on me.",
        "Brody: I don't even know where to start, uh, but the first thing you need to know is that I never slept with Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Have you heard anything about John, lately?",
        "Cole: Uh, no. Is he okay?",
        "Marty: He's fine, he's fine. But you are going to start hearing a lot about him and what I need you to know is that he's innocent, okay? He didn't do any of the things that they're saying he did.",
        "Cole: What -- what things?",
        "Marty: I don't even know how to tell you this.",
        "Cole: What? Is this about those murders?",
        "Marty: Yes. Honey, it looks like -- it looks like the killer might be after me.",
        "Cole: What? Mom, where are you? I'll come stay with you.",
        "Marty: No. I'm with John and we're just going to go away for a couple of days.",
        "Cole: Okay, okay, okay. Tell me where you are and I'll come meet you.",
        "Marty: I can't let you do that.",
        "Cole: Why not?",
        "Marty: Because you have to finish -- you have to finish your rehab or you'll go to prison. I'm fine with John. I mean, I'm in good hands. You know that, right? Cole? I seriously believe that staying away from you until all this is over is the best thing for both of us, okay? I want to wait until John figures out who is doing this. Do you believe me?",
        "Cole: Sure.",
        "Marty: Cole Thornhart, I love you more than anything in this world and if anything happened to you, I would die. So, just trust me. Do you understand?",
        "Cole: Yeah, Mom. Mom, please be careful.",
        "Marty: I will. Listen to me. I believe in you. You can do this, okay? You can stay clean. You just have to trust me on that and know that I will come back to you, okay? I promise. I love you.",
        "Cole: I love you, too, Mom.",
        "Starr: These fell out of your Jacket. Where did you get them? Let's see, you got them from the hospital because that's what it says on the label. Which means you stole them when we were arranging to have our baby's DNA tested.",
        "Cole: Starr, no, there's --",
        "Starr: No, Cole. You swore to me over and over again that you were going to quit. I can't do this anymore, Cole. It's over. I am so done with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How can you stand there and tell me that you didn't sleep with Gig --",
        "Brody: It's the truth.",
        "Jessica: I was there. I saw Rex lay into you. I saw the hurt in his eyes when he walked in on the two of you.",
        "Brody: Rex -- he didn't see what he thinks he saw.",
        "Jessica: What are you saying?",
        "Brody: Gigi and I -- we staged the whole thing for him to believe that we were together.",
        "Jessica: Staged? What the hell for?",
        "Brody: To save Shane's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Oh, good. Someone was here about a half an hour ago. That should give me plenty of time. Overriding alarms, the breaker, default, manually enter code. I'll bet you're laughing at me. I bet you think I'm too stupid to do this. Well I'm not quite as stupid as you always thought I was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So you honestly think that my son could have gotten somebody else's stem cells and not Stacy's.",
        "Stacy: It's just like they say, \"no good deed goes unpunished.\"",
        "Rex: So some anonymous donor swoops in, donates their stem cells and nobody saw or heard it.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, well how else do you explain Stacy's stem cells in the trash?",
        "Rex: You found that. You tell me. I don't know what the heck you're doing with that or why you're saying this crap about Stacy. She sat in the hospital for hours, put up with needles, which she hates, to save my son.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, she's also the same girl you swore slipped you a mickey to get you into bed, so --",
        "Rex: We're past that.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, really?",
        "Rex: Maybe you're mad. Maybe you're bitter about the breakup. But don't you dare try to turn this beautiful thing she did for us into something ugly. I'm out of here.",
        "Stacy: I'm really sorry that Schuy went off on you like that. You're probably right. He just can't accept that I don't want to get back together.",
        "Rex: The guy's walking around with a bag of blood, Stacy. Are you sure you want to live here?",
        "Stacy: Where else can I go? It's okay. I can handle Schuyler.",
        "Rex: You did an incredible thing for us. Do not let him take that away from you, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Gigi's sister, Stacy, she demanded that Gigi give up Rex.",
        "Jessica: Look, Gigi already came to me and tried to explain this and I told her it doesn't matter. Whatever did or didn't happen between the two of you, it was a wake-up call for me, okay? I wasn't ready to start a relationship with you and I'm -- I'm still not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry I haven't been there for you, buddy, but I'm going to pick up a pepperoni pizza, deep-dish, and I'll be right over, okay? I've just been busy. With Brody. Yeah, he wanted to see how you were doing. I will. I love you, sweetie.",
        "Rex: You were busy with Brody. That's a nice save for the kid. Isn't it more like you were getting busy with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Please let that be all the alarms. See, I told you I could do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: The day you found me with Gigi, you'd come to say you were ready to start something with me, so don't give me this \"wake up call\" bull. The only thing that's keeping us apart is this play-acting I did with Gigi. Hear me out.",
        "Jessica: Okay, shoot.",
        "Brody: Stacy's got it bad for Rex. Always has, I guess. She found out she's a match, that she could save Shane's life, and this -- this is the part that's hard to believe. She refused to donate to Shane, unless Gigi gave up Rex.",
        "Jessica: That's --",
        "Brody: Unbelievable, right? I mean, Stacy told Gigi to break up with Rex, and if she didn't make it look good, she'd let Shane die.",
        "Jessica: You're kidding.",
        "Brody: I wish I was. Gigi was desperate. She asked for my help, and I couldn't say no. I love Shane. I had to do what I could for him. You have kids. You understand, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You sure you don't want to sit?",
        "David: No, I can't stay.",
        "Viki: Well, have you seen your -- your father? I still can't get used to the idea that you're Bo's son.",
        "David: I just came back, sort of a last-minute trip to work things out with Dorian.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "David: I have to get back to L.A. to shoot the new Have-a-Seat commercial. They say this one's a before and after. I don't know what that means, but it pays double. Besides, I don't think Bo really wants to play dad. Not with me, anyway.",
        "Viki: Well, that might not be entirely true.",
        "David: Oh? Bottoms up. Get it? I said, \"Bottoms up,\" and I do hemorrhoid commercials.",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "Viki: You know, David, Bo could probably use all the support he can get. Did Dorian tell you about Matthew?",
        "David: I read about that in the paper. That poor kid.",
        "Viki: It's awful. It's awful. It's so sad and tragic. I mean, he's paralyzed, and the young man that he thought of as a brother is the one who's responsible.",
        "David: Yeah, Cole Thornhart, right? Marty's son?",
        "Viki: I can't even imagine the guilt that Cole must be feeling right now, and what it's doing to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr, please wait. Listen to me -- you don't understand.",
        "Starr: You're right, I don't understand, because you said that you stopped using.",
        "Cole: Look, I messed up.",
        "Starr: You lied to me. Just when I thought we were getting somewhere, doing this for hope, you just wanted to steal pills from the hospital.",
        "Cole: No, I didn't.",
        "Starr: You did! Stop lying to me. Everything you do, everything that happens to you, you use as an excuse to start using again.",
        "Cole: Starr, please, please, don't be mad at me.",
        "Starr: I should have never, ever told you that Hope didn't die from Rh disease.",
        "Cole: You should have. I deserved to know that.",
        "Starr: No, I shouldn't have. You wouldn't have started popping pills again.",
        "Cole: Look, I'm not high right now, okay?",
        "Starr: But you are going to get high. Why else would you have stolen them?",
        "Cole: Look, I'll toss them. I'll toss them.",
        "Starr: Okay, right, go ahead.",
        "Cole: I will.",
        "Starr: You know who did the exact same thing you did? Who probably said the same things that you're saying right now? You might not know it, and you might not want me to say his name, but I'm going to anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What the hell do you think you were doing, waving that bag of blood around like that?",
        "Schuyler: Stacy, these stem cells are supposed to be in your nephew right now, but they're not. I have them because you threw them away. These are yours.",
        "Stacy: Well, Rex thinks I should move out of here. He thinks you've lost your mind. You've made an idiot of yourself in front of him.",
        "Schuyler: I don't care. I'm not the one trying to get into his pants at all cost.",
        "Stacy: Oh, how gross do you have to be?",
        "Schuyler: You want to know what gross is? Stacy, you want to know something gross? Manipulating the fears of a parent who's afraid their child is going to die, so you can live out some teenage fantasy -- that's gross.",
        "Stacy: I saved my nephew's life, and I don't care if you don't believe me, because Rex does.",
        "Schuyler: Enough with the saint Stacy of the stem cells. I'm sick of it.",
        "Stacy: You know, you must really hate me.",
        "Schuyler: I don't hate you. I'm trying to keep you from losing yourself. You are obsessed with this guy.",
        "Stacy: You're the one who's obsessed, Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, I am. I am, and hell if I know why I'm trying to get through to someone I shouldn't even give a damn about.",

        "Starr: Schuyler stole drugs from the hospital, too.",
        "Cole: It's Mr. Joplin.",
        "Starr: My dad used it as leverage to blackmail Dr. Joplin.",
        "Cole: He's your bio teacher, not your BFF.",
        "Starr: My dad was going to arrest Schuyler for using drugs. That distracted Dr. Joplin from doing her job, which is why our baby died.",
        "Cole: Starr, please.",
        "Starr: What? You don't want to hear the truth?",
        "Cole: I haven't -- I haven't used any of these. I really haven't. Look, I have a drug test this week. Why would I get high?",
        "Starr: So you stole them from the hospital as what, a souvenir? You expect me to believe that you are not going to take them?",
        "Cole: I don't know, I don't know. I don't know, it was like an impulse or something.",
        "Starr: I'm such an idiot for thinking you could really quit.",

        "Stacy: Are you trying to quit me, cowboy? Like tobacco -- is that what you're saying? And you think you're going to do it by waving around this bag of blood and making crazy accusations about me? You're insane -- you know that, right?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, yeah, maybe. I keep thinking tough love will bring back this girl -- this sweet, lonely, innocent girl that I fell in love with in Las Vegas. And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this girl never even existed. Maybe I was just high.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: While I was delivering flowers to your sister for the amazing thing that she did, and defending her from her nutty ex, you were throwing yourself a party in the sack with Brody.",
        "Gigi: You caught me, Balsom. Guilty as charged. That's exactly what I was doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: By the time someone finds you, you're going to be knock, knock, knocking at hell's door. And I'm probably going to meet you there someday, but for right now, it's okay, because I did my bit for humanity, and the planet's going to be a much better place without you in it. And you know what? Maybe someday they'll make me a saint for this.",

So she told me to go ahead. I hated hurting you. I'm so sorry. We were together all that time in group. You know everything about me. I trust you with all my secrets.",
        "Jessica: I trust you with my secrets, too. And, yeah, my feelings got trampled, but it made me realize how easy it is for you to hurt me.",
        "Brody: That's the last thing I wanted to do.",
        "Jessica: Well, it sucks to be you, then.",
        "Brody: What can I do to prove myself to you?",
        "Jessica: You helped Gigi save her son. I mean, what you guys did was out there, but I get it. I would do anything to make sure my children survived.",

You are in treatment. If you get caught, you will go to prison. Tell me you haven't been high this whole time, Cole. Please tell me you haven't been high.",
        "Cole: I fell off the wagon.",
        "Starr: How many times? Once, twice? When, why -- was it something I did? Something that I said? Please, Cole, tell me the truth -- no more lies. We are doing something for our daughter, and I need to be able to trust you. We used to be able to trust each other with everything, didn't we? Please, no more lies. Please.",
