        "Starr: You've been getting high ever since the accident? This whole time? Even though if you get caught once, you will go to prison? Even after you ruined Matthew's life -- probably forever -- you still didn't stop using? What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Cole: I want to stop. Every time I get high, I want to stop.",
        "Starr: Then why didn't you?",
        "Cole: Because I can't -- I can't, Starr! I can't stop!",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Cole: I thought I could, you know? I just -- I can't. I can't. I -- I don't know what to do. I mean, you think -- you think I want to take these? You think I want to take these and fail my drug test and go to prison? No, I don't want -- I don't want that. I don't want any of that. But you know, the truth is I don't care. I don't care anymore. That's how bad I need to take one of these right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Why do we have to do this now?",
        "Rex: Well, there really is no right time to tell your kid you're breaking up.",
        "Gigi: But you just said he's doing better, and I just ordered a pizza. He's happy.",
        "Rex: He deserves to know the truth. I'm done lying to my son.",
        "Gigi: Maybe this isn't the right thing to do.",

        "T\u00e9a: Oh. Well, lucky for me I am no longer on retainer.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's why I came by. I wanted to tell you the good news, that the judge has granted my request for an emergency custody hearing, tomorrow, and I -- I want to make sure you don't miss me getting my kids back.",

        "Gigi: Rex -- it was not supposed to be this way.",
        "Rex: Okay, are you saying it was a mistake, that we shouldn't be breaking up?",

        "Rex: Yeah, it's great.",
        "Gigi: Um, thank you so much.",
        "Priest: Don't thank me. I've seen you in the chapel. God must've heard your prayers.",
        "Gigi: Yes, he did.",
        "Rex: Gigi? Can we --",
        "Gigi: No -- you're right, Rex. We should go in there and tell Shane we're through.",

        "Jessica: You're nervous to be with me?",
        "[Brody sighs]",
        "Brody: When I -- when I first got back from Iraq, I'd go out every night and get wasted, get into fights. And I slept with a lot of women. Most of the time, I didn't even know their names because they didn't mean anything to me.",
        "Jessica: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Brody: You mean the world to me. So, hell, yes, I'm nervous.",
        "Jessica: But you --",
        "Brody: Want you? I want you, but only if it feels right to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I know you, Cole. You care about whether you mess up your life. You care about going to prison.",
        "Cole: You don't get it. The first time I took one of those pills, it's like I got an element of my body that was missing before. They're stronger than me.",
        "Starr: No, they're not stronger than you. If they were, you would've taken one of them by now.",
        "Cole: It's kill -- it's killing me not to take one right now.",
        "Starr: But, your last drug test was clean.",
        "Cole: That is because I conned my best friend.",
        "Starr: What -- what do you mean?",
        "Cole: I lied to Markko so that he would take my drug test for me.",
        "Starr: You what?",
        "Cole: Yeah. See? That's -- that's what these pills do, Starr. It doesn't matter -- it doesn't matter who I hurt. I let Matthew get in that car with me, now he's never going to walk again. He's never going to walk again because of me!",
        "[Starr sobs]",
        "Cole: Because of me, and what do I do? What do I do? Yeah -- take another pill.",
        "Starr: Cole, you were -- you were hurting.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Every time I put one of those pills in my mouth, I was spitting on Matthew. I was spitting on Matthew, I was spitting on -- on Markko and Nora and you.",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Cole: Yeah, you -- you were right to run out on me. All I do is hurt people.",
        "Starr: Cole?",
        "Cole: You should go. You should go to Mr. J. If that's what you really want, if that's what you want really want, I get it.",
        "Starr: No --",
        "Cole: I get it. Starr? Look at me. I'm not worth it.",

        "Viki: Ah, so I see.",

        "T\u00e9a: The moment R.J. asked me out tonight, I thought \"what a wonderful opportunity to get my mind off\" you know who.",
        "Viki: Uh, that might be easier said than done. \"You know who\" just walked in.",
        "T\u00e9a: Um, you know -- let's find the maitre d' and get a table far, far away. Okay?",
        "R.J.: Okay. It's good to see you again, Viki.",
        "Viki: You, too, R.J.",
        "T\u00e9a: Bye.",
        "Charlie: Now, should we be inviting your brother to join us?",
        "Viki: Are you insane? I would like to enjoy your company.",
        "Charlie: Oh. I was hoping you would say that.",
        "Viki: Here is to a night of peace and quiet.",
        "Charlie: Amen.",

        "Shane: Dr. McBain brought me new markers -- said I could take them home with me.",
        "Gigi: Tomorrow, right, bud?",
        "Rex: Pretty awesome, huh? You're finally going to blow this pop stand.",
        "Shane: Yeah, it's awesome. So, how come you guys look like somebody died?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Oh, I want you so much.",
        "Langston: Oh, I want you, too. No -- but, no, we should -- we should stop.",
        "Markko: Oh, yeah. You're right. We should totally stop.",
        "Langston: Markko! No, no, we -- we can't, we can't. Markko.",
        "Markko: Whew. Okay, but -- okay. All right, yeah, yeah -- you're right. I love you so much, but I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, I -- I love you, too, and it's not that I don't want to.",
        "Markko: Wait, wait, wait -- you do?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Markko: So, then, if we love each other and we both want to be together -- what exactly are we waiting for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm not going anywhere. I'm not leaving you.",
        "Cole: Even after I told you what I did?",
        "Starr: You didn't want to do those things.",
        "Cole: But I did them anyway.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Cole: Because I told you -- the pills are stronger than me.",
        "Starr: So you didn't want to take the pills?",
        "Cole: But I can't stop.",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Cole: Doesn't matter who I hurt, I can't stop.",
        "Starr: Do you know what that means?",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Starr: You have done everything but say the words. Cole? You're a drug addict.",

        "Dorian: Yes, I'm sure it will come as a shock to you, Viki, but David and I are now finished. It's over.",
        "Viki: Yes, he told me. I was thrilled that he came to his senses.",

        "Dorian: Where is the hostess? I'm sure our table must be ready.",
        "Charlie: Ray? I wouldn't turn my back on her if I was you.",
        "Ray: Excuse me?",
        "Charlie: Dorian is full of surprises. You never know when she might stab you with a hypo, slip something into your drink.",
        "Ray: I'll bear that in mind, Charlie.",
        "Dorian: Excuse us! Yeah.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",

        "Markko: Yeah, but that was, like, almost two years ago. We're not exactly rushing.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Langston: Yeah, but then I saw Starr getting pregnant and what it did to her life and --",
        "Markko: No, no, that wouldn't be us. We'd -- we'd be safe.",
