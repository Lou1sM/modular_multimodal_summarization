        "Kelly Cramer and John McBain discuss a possible connection between Ronald's murder and Kelly's mother Melinda's probable murder. Kelly tells John that the ceramic piece that her mother made was the only thing Melinda ever made for Kelly and the only ceramic piece she is aware that her mother ever made.

        "Cole: Get off me!",
        "Langston: Cole, stop it!",
        "Starr: Cole! Cole! For God's sake, please stop! Please don't do this! Please! No! Stop it! Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: \"And they moved to the little house by their own lily pad pond, and they lived happily ever after.\" You like that one? That's my favorite. That's how every good story should end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Of all the places in this town, why would Dorian pick a restaurant that you built for me to have a business meeting?",
        "Charlie: Maybe she just likes the huevos rancheros.",
        "Viki: Oh, right. That must be it.",
        "Charlie: It gives me an excuse to talk about you all day.",
        "Viki: Good. She's gonna love that.",
        "Charlie: I know I will. I'll see you in a while.",
        "Viki: I'll be here.",
        "Charlie: And don't worry. I'll keep dragon lady in line.",
        "Dorian: Dragon lady? Ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, are you still brooding about what you said to Marty?",
        "Natalie: You don't know?",
        "Viki: Know what?",
        "Natalie: Marty's in the hospital.",
        "Viki: Why?",
        "Natalie: Someone pushed her down a flight of stairs, and she lost the baby.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God. That's awful! When did this happen?",
        "Natalie: Yesterday.",
        "Viki: Yes--yesterday. That's why she didn't come to the Palace. Oh, honey, I have to call her. Wait a minute. You said she was pushed? That was deliberate?",
        "Natalie: Looks like.",
        "Viki: Who did that?",
        "Natalie: Well, you're looking at the number-one suspect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Yeah. Waiting for forensics in the Saybrooke case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: John, it's two murders. We can't just sit here. What's the first move?",
        "John: The first move is you going home and letting me do my job.",
        "Kelly: Two murders.",
        "John: Until we find evidence to the contrary, it's two people that have died.",
        "Kelly: We know my mom was murdered, and this Rodney guy knew who did it, and now he's suddenly dead in my office from natural causes, 5 minutes after he's healthy and talking to me.",
        "John: Until we get permission to autopsy Rodney's body, we don't legally have a murder to investigate.",
        "Kelly: So off the record, while we are waiting here, growing older by the minute, what can we do?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Brody: John, forensics are back.",
        "John: Excuse me for one minute. All right, tell me you got something.",
        "Brody: The fibers you got on the door outside the stairwell--blue dye, special order. The threads are a high-end silk blend.",
        "John: So what? Whoever pushed Marty down the stairs had some money?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[All shouting]",
        "Starr: Cole!",
        "Markko: Cole!",
        "Blair: Stop! Starr! Stay away!",
        "[All shouting]",
        "Blair: Come on. Get up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Get up, Todd! Stay away from him! Stay away from him!",
        "[Woman screams]",
        "Blair: Cole, stop it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: You know, you're one lucky little girl. Your mommy and daddy are just like the prince and the princess in the story. Huh?",
        "Hope: Mama.",
        "Hannah: Oh, she's coming. You want to read another book first? How about this one? Yeah? Okay. We'll read this one. But first you got to take a nap. You and I are gonna be great friends.",
        "Hope: Mama?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[All shouting]",
        "Dani: Oh, my God.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't look. Don't look.",
        "Blair: Can you hear me, Todd? Can you hear me, Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Todd Manning is rich. Yeah, I know, Natalie is, too, but if you had to pick...",
        "John: Thanks, Brody. Hey, let me know if they got anything off the print left in the stairwell.",
        "Brody: Will do.",
        "Kelly: Was that about Marty?",
        "John: Ongoing investigation.",
        "Kelly: Look, that's your girlfriend. It was your baby. I know that you want to catch who pushed her.",
        "John: Oh, I will.",
        "Kelly: See that? Just now, what you did? That's how I feel about my mom's murder.",
        "John: I'm not trying to blow you off. I'll do everything I can.",
        "Kelly: It can't wait, John. Rodney's killer must have followed him from California. That means they're here now.",
        "John: Unless they were already in Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Was that Viki on the phone just now?",
        "Charlie: Good guess.",
        "Dorian: Dragon lady. Her expression or yours?",
        "Charlie: It's just a figure of speech, you know?",
        "Dorian: Right, like \"sticks and stones may break my bones,\" and it's okay because I've been called worse, probably by you.",
        "Charlie: Dorian, what do you want me to say, hmm?",
        "Dorian: Clean slate. Come on, let's sit down. Clean slate on both sides because we are gonna build the Llanview Civic Center. It's going to create jobs. It's going to boost tourism. We're gonna do a lot of good for Llanview together.",
        "Charlie: Yes, Madam Mayor, I believe we will. Here. Now take a look at this.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. I hope you remembered to keep it green.",
        "Charlie: I picked up the site plats this morning, and the first thing that I saw was where we can put the turbines for the wind capture. We combine that with solar panels, and we're gonna generate at least 70% of the power we need for the entire complex right off the bat. Is that green enough for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Who would accuse you of pushing Marty down the stairs?",
        "Natalie: John McBain.",
        "Viki: No!",
        "Natalie: To be fair, Marty helped. She told him about the fight that we had and what I said.",
        "Viki: Oh, that you and John would be together if it weren't for the baby.",
        "Natalie: Anyway, I was there at the hospital right before it happened. I went to talk to her.",
        "Viki: Honey, John is upset. He knows you'd never do anything like that.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, that's what Brody told him, but he hasn't backed off, and the only reason that I'm not in jail right now is they found another suspect.",
        "Viki: Who?",
        "Natalie: Your brother.",
        "Viki: Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Did somebody call the cops?",
        "Destiny: I'm on it. I'm on it. Yes, we need an ambulance at...",
        "Markko: Cole, hey, step back! Hey, man, we want to let you go, but you got to cool down. Can we let you go?",
        "Langston: No! Don't let him go!",
        "Blair: Come on. I know you can hear me. Come on.",
        "Starr: Mom, is he even breathing?",
        "Blair: Yeah, he's breathing. Come on.",
        "Starr: Will someone dial 911? My dad needs help!",
        "Blair: Listen to me. I'm gonna keep on talking to you.",
        "Starr: This is ridiculous! Where's that ambulance?",
        "[All talking at once]",
        "Matthew: They're on their way.",
        "Starr: Dad! Dad.",
        "T\u00e9a: He's breathing?",
        "Dani: Oh, my God. Look at him.",
        "Markko: Come on.",
        "Cole: No.",
        "Markko: Get out of here.",
        "Cole: No. I'm not run--I'm not running.",
        "Markko: Hey, no, no, no. Don't run, but you've got to stay out of the way before things get worse.",
        "Cole: I can't.",
        "Markko: Hey, go home, cool off. Think about your kid, man, and check yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm very impressed. Charlie, you've done a lot of work.",
        "Charlie: Well, there's a lot to think about. Kept me up half the night.",
        "Dorian: I hope you haven't neglected your bride.",
        "Charlie: Uh, no, no. Not a chance.",
        "Dorian: I'm very happy the two of you are back together again. I have a vested interest in your marriage succeeding.",
        "Charlie: Really? And why is that?",
        "Dorian: Because I was a big part in messing it up, wasn't I?",
        "Charlie: Dorian, I made all my own decisions. I screwed things up pretty well all by myself, and I'm just glad that Viki took me back. And I will not be making the same mistakes again.",
        "Dorian: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Todd was at the hospital, too. He and Marty got into a huge blowout right before I got there.",
        "Viki: What were they fighting about? Why would Todd hurt Marty?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Isn't that what he does?",
        "Viki: No, not like this. No, no, I don't think so.",
        "Natalie: Well, I don't get Todd. I never have. All I know is, I didn't--I didn't do this.",
        "Viki: Well, of course you didn't. No one in their right mind would accuse you of this.",
        "Natalie: But I just--I feel guilty, you know? Like--like maybe I made all of this happen because I wished that Marty wasn't pregnant.",
        "Viki: That's nonsense.",
        "Natalie: I guess, but, uh...that baby's gone now, and things couldn't be worse for John or me, and I can't--I can't imagine us together ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: My mother died in California. Rodney lived at the same sanitarium. It's obvious that that is the connection.",
        "John: Unless the killer came from somewhere else, and that's what we thought when we suspected Allison, isn't it?",
        "[Kelly bangs on window]",
        "Kelly: I guess.",
        "John: You focus on the obvious, you miss what's really important. I mean, it seemed obvious that Rodney was mute.",
        "Kelly: Only he wasn't. Okay, I get it. John, so where do you start? If you just tell me what you're doing, then maybe I'll calm down.",
        "John: No guarantees. We're looking into Rodney. We've petitioned for all his records from the sanitarium. That way we're gonna know exactly what he was doing--",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry. John, we got a call from 911. Llanview High. They want an ambulance. I know it's a call for a beat cop, but I want to catch it.",
        "John: Jessica, right? All right. You got to go. Check it out.",
        "Brody: Thanks. I'm sure it's nothing big.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Langston, please make sure the hall is clear for the gurney.",
        "Blair: I want to go, okay? I'm going to go.",
        "Starr: No, I'm going to go.",
        "T\u00e9a: I want to go, too.",
        "EMT: We only have room for two. I'm sorry. Those are the rules.",
        "Blair: Meet us at the hospital. Get a-going. Go, go, go. Come on, Starr. All right, see you there. Be careful!",
        "Dani: Mom.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Dani: Is Todd gonna be okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know, mija. That was--",
        "Dani: Horrible. And it was so--I mean, after today--",
        "T\u00e9a: What happened today, huh?",
        "Dani: I don't know. It was strange. We were rehearsing, and I heard Todd. I mean, it was Mr. G. Playing Todd, but I heard him with Starr--how much he loves her, how much she means to him. Weird, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe because it wasn't Todd, you could really hear him.",
        "Dani: Only then it was. I mean, Todd was here. I looked up from rehearsing, and I saw him watching us. And I don't know--he looked different to me, and I thought that--that maybe--and now it turns out that he pushed Cole's mom down a stairwell and killed her baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I got a call about a fight and that you need an ambulance?",
        "Man: Yes, but I don't know how this happened. The students were only left alone for a few minutes.",
        "Brody: One of the students was hurt?",
        "Man: No. It was Todd Manning. And the boy who attacked him isn't a student anymore.",
        "Brody: What boy?",
        "Man: Cole Thornhart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Dani must be freaking. She was just telling me she was ready to give her Dad a chance.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it sucks.",
        "Nate: I'm gonna go check on her.",
        "Matthew: I'll check on her. Thanks for your concern, but we help each other with stuff like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, God. Poor Starr. I mean, her dad--",
        "Markko: Her dad tried to kill Cole's mom. He did kill her baby.",
        "Langston: So that gives Cole the right to kill Todd? No. He was so out of control. I mean, he's been so intense lately about everything, totally getting on my case.",
        "Markko: What would Cole get on your case about?",
        "Brody: Hey. I heard Cole and Todd got in a fight. You two saw it?",
        "Langston: Yeah. Cole was a total maniac, and Markko broke it up.",
        "Markko: He was upset. Todd pushed his mom down the stairs and put her in the hospital.",
        "Langston: That doesn't give him a right to beat Todd to a pulp.",
        "Brody: No, it doesn't. Where is Cole now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Cole.",
        "Cole: My daughter--how is she?",
        "Hannah: Hope's fine. She's taking a nap.",
        "Cole: Good. She should be asleep.",
        "Hannah: Cole, are you okay? What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Say you're right--Melinda and Rodney were murdered by the same person.",
        "Kelly: What else could it be? You know I'm right.",
        "John: What's the motive?",
        "Kelly: Well, whoever it is had to kill Rodney to shut him up.",
        "John: Okay. Now we're back to your mom. All right, ruling out revenge by Mitch Laurence, what's the motive for anyone wanting to kill her?",
        "Kelly: That's a good question, John.",
        "John: Hey--",
        "Kelly: No, it's just--you know what? When you say it like that, it's always a jolt.",
        "John: Yeah, I know.",
        "Kelly: My mom was so defenseless. Thinking about someone hurting her...",
        "John: I know this is hard. Look, did she have any enemies?",
        "Kelly: No. No. She was a sweetheart. She was kind to people. She kept to herself. She was quiet. She was shy. They said she liked to watch a lot of TV.",
        "John: And make pottery.",
        "Kelly: You mean the vase?",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Kelly: That was a first.",
        "John: Really?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I mean, I didn't even know that she was into pottery. There weren't any other pieces they sent with her things. It must have been a new hobby. It was the first thing she ever made for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Do you think it's a problem for Viki that we're working together so closely?",
        "Charlie: What I figure is that it's no good having good stores along here when the cars can't get to and from them, so I'm gonna put a parking lot here, I'm gonna put a parking lot there, and we'll just make the whole main drag a walking mall. No. Dorian, I think Viki made it very clear to you last night that she is not happy that we are working together.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. She actually made some bald-faced threats, if you want to know, but let's do go on.",
        "Charlie: Maybe she's just a big enough person to realize that this project is important for the community.",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes, yes. Noble, noble, absolutely. We can count on Viki to always take the high ground, and I mean that in the best possible way. After all, she knows that this civic center is going to be good for Llanview, and if we succeed--and we are going to--she's going to be very proud that she believed in us and trusted us.",
        "Viki: What are you saying, darling, huh? All the love that you felt for John is now just gone?",
        "Natalie: No. I'm sure I'll--I'll always love John, but it's not enough. You know, at this point, he's gonna have to--he'd have to beg me for my forgiveness.",
        "Viki: Is that what you're waiting for?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. That's never gonna happen. I'm sorry. You just barely got in, and I'm dumping all this junk on you.",
        "Viki: Well, you know something? I've actually missed all this junk. Baby, I'm your mother. Of course you should tell me.",
        "Natalie: Still.",
        "Viki: Have you talked to anyone else?",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Viki: No. I'm so sorry, honey.",
        "Natalie: Stop. Look at you. You know, this is gonna be horrible for you if this ends up being Todd.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, I so don't want to believe that.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, someone did it. If it wasn't Todd and it wasn't me, who-- who would want Marty out of the way?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: What happened? Cole.",
        "Cole: I found Todd.",
        "Hannah: Did you talk to him?",
        "Cole: Not much.",
        "Hannah: Did you ask him about your mom?",
        "Cole: I told him. That son of a bitch denied it! He just turned his back on me and walked away, like he didn't have an answer for what happened.",
        "Hannah: That's awful.",
        "Cole: No. Awful came next.",
        "Hannah: It got worse?",
        "Cole: I tried to kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Gangemi: All right, what have we got?",
        "EMT: Physical assault. BP 102 over 56. Pulse tacky at 120. 02 sat is 97 on 5 liters. GCS is 9. Abrasions and contusions on upper extremities, head, and neck.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Major trauma?",
        "Second EMT: Big laceration on the back of the head. Bled like a pig, but we got a line in with ringers going.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: All right, get neuro up here stat.",
        "Second EMT: Yes, Doctor.",
        "Starr: He's gonna be all right, won't he?",
        "[EKG beeping]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I hope for your sake that Todd isn't guilty.",
        "Viki: Yes. So do I. You know what? Oh, God, I get so weary when I think of the list of things that man has done. At some point, it's just going to be too much.",
        "Natalie: You sound like you're starting to believe it.",
        "Viki: Honey, it's Todd. I have to consider the possibility.",
        "Natalie: Well, maybe they'll arrest me. Thank God you're home, because if I went to jail and the only person I had to call for bail was Jess? Good luck.",
        "Viki: Things will get better between you two.",
        "Natalie: I don't see how. She hates me, you know? She thinks I'm here to ruin her life and her high school fun.",
        "Viki: Maybe being at her father's will help.",
        "Natalie: She's staying there?",
        "Viki: For now, yes. We thought it best to let Bree get settled in here before Jessica has to deal with her.",
        "Natalie: God, I can--I can only imagine what goes on in that little head of hers about this.",
        "Viki: It's so sad, you know, because Bree is now used to the idea that her mother is away. And the hard part, of course, is to make sure that Jessica is present when she's actually with Bree. So for now, all Bree has is you, Charlie, and me.",
        "Natalie: Charlie? He's around?",
        "Viki: Yeah. We're back together.",
        "Natalie: Aah! Ha ha ha!",
        "Viki: Yeah. We think so, too.",
        "Natalie: This is the best news I've heard this year.",
        "Viki: We deserve another chance, you know. I love him. I love him so much.",
        "Natalie: Of course you do.",
        "Viki: And he's not drinking anymore and he's trying to make amends.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It's not like he's gonna team up with Dorian again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: So this is your copy of the prelims. As soon as you sign off on the outline, we can start talking about the specifics, the budget.",
