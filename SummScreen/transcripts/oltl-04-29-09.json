        "Starr: Jack, no! I'm not feeling well. I feel like I'm coming down with something.",
        "Jack: You're faking. You just want to go to court so you can see what's going on with Dad.",
        "Starr: I think I'm going to throw up again.",
        "Jack: I'm out of here.",
        "Starr: He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.",

        "Marty: Hey, you want to take a nap? I got some sleep in the car, but you drove all night.",
        "John: No, I'm not tired.",
        "Marty: Want to tell me what's so fascinating in the parking lot?",
        "John: It's nothing.",
        "Marty: Okay. Chair propped up under the doorknob. You know, you're scaring me now.",
        "John: I'm just being cautious.",
        "Marty: We're in Rochester, New York. You really think the killer followed us all the way here?",
        "John: No. But I'm wanted for three murders and the attempted murder of my wife. There will be an APB out for us. And with Rochester being so close to the Canadian border --",
        "Marty: You think Bo alerted the border guards?",
        "John: I hope so.",
        "Marty: Okay, now you lost me.",
        "John: While they're watching the border, I'm hoping to find the killer right here in town.",

        "T\u00e9a: Oh, my God. I overslept. What happened to my wake-up call?",
        "Todd: I told the front desk no calls.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, Todd.",
        "[T\u00e9a giggles]",
        "T\u00e9a: I've got to go to court, Todd.",
        "Todd: No. You're not going to court; you're not going to court. What, do you think they're going to start without us, huh? I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. Not yet.",

        "Dorian: I am Miss Delgado's most important client. I can assure you, she will not mind if you ring through to her room. Have you got any idea who I am?",
        "Dorian: Hmm. The operator hung up on me.",
        "Ray: What's wrong?",
        "Dorian: Our attorney, T\u00e9a Delgado, your good friend, refuses to answer her phone.",
        "Dorian: Why would she refuse all calls?",
        "Ray: She has a hearing to prepare for. T\u00e9a is probably just taking care of business.",

        "Dorian: She damn well better win this case.",
        "Ray: She will, she will. From what you told me about Todd Manning, there's no way we can let him get custody of those kids.",

        "Starr: Okay. Come here. Come here.",
        "Cole: When is this going to stop?",
        "Starr: With pills, it could be up to 48 hours.",
        "Cole: Says who?",
        "Starr: The last four websites that I checked. They also said that you need to drink plenty of water. So start drinking. Okay? Come here.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Starr: Who's this? Who's Rachel?",
        "Cole: She's my counselor.",

        "Rachel: Fine. You sound terrible.",
        "Cole: No, I'm fine.",
        "Rachel: Really? I went by the center earlier this morning. Your bed didn't seem slept in. Please tell me that you're at your mother's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You really think that the killer followed us here to Rochester?",
        "John: Well, the theory is the killer's connected to the rape. The victims were all connected to you.",
        "Marty: But Talia?",
        "John: Wrong place, wrong time. The killer was waiting for you and me.",
        "Marty: But why Rochester?",
        "John: Three distinct possibilities -- there's Todd, I don't think he has the guts. There's Rosen, but he was in lock-up when Talia was killed.",
        "Marty: Powell Lord, right? He's Todd's cousin.",
        "John: Right. And he's right here in Rochester.",
        "John: Apparently, Powell Lord had some kind of breakdown. He tried to commit suicide. On the way, he committed a series of rapes. Could have led to him becoming a serial killer.",
        "Marty: I thought he was finally locked up for good.",
        "John: He's a resident in a place called the Sitwell Institute. It's located just outside Rochester. I called the staff, confirmed his status there, but I think I'd like to check it out for myself.",
        "Marty: But if he's been there all along --",
        "John: He still may know something. I'll tell you what; I'll give you a call when I know something.",
        "Marty: You're not going to go anywhere without me.",
        "John: Marty, give me back my keys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Surveillance cameras show Marty entering the room but never leaving.",
        "Bo: If she's game, she probably went out the window.",
        "Oliver: Witnesses actually say they saw a man and a woman matching Marty's description leave the parking lot.",
        "Bo: Did anybody I.D. John?",
        "Oliver: No.",
        "Bo: No. No, of course not. He left this.",
        "Oliver: Why would John leave a stabbed picture that implicates him?",
        "Bo: Because he wanted us to find it and follow up. He wants us to know that whoever killed Talia is after Marty now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm allowed to leave, right?",
        "Rachel: With permission, yes.",
        "Cole: So you must have missed me.",
        "Rachel: Cole, I know that you're trying to work your way through this, but the whole idea is that you don't have to do it alone.",
        "Cole: I know. Uh, and I've got your card.",
        "Rachel: Don't forget, you have a drug test today. And it has to be supervised.",
        "Cole: I know. Thanks.",
        "Rachel: Bye.",

        "[Rachel sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Did she buy it?",
        "Cole: I think so. She just wanted to tell me that I have a drug test today.",
        "Starr: Okay. You need to drink. You need to drink. Here, come on. Come on. Cole!",
        "Cole: She knows that I didn't sleep there last night. She checked my room. I shouldn't have made the bed. I'm so stupid!",
        "Starr: You're not stupid. It's okay.",
        "Cole: It's not okay. If she reports me, they're going to lock me up.",
        "Starr: Did she say she was going to report you?",
        "Cole: No. No, just to come in to take the test.",
        "Starr: Okay. We'll clean you up, and then once you're feeling a little better, you can go and get your test. Okay?",
        "Cole: She takes one look at me, she's going to know.",
        "Starr: You have plenty of time. Come on, why don't you try to lay down --",
        "Cole: No, I can't sleep!",
        "Starr: Lay down with me.",

        "Starr: Why don't I make you some chamomile T\u00e9a. You want me to do that?",
        "Cole: No, no, no. I need you to go to the Palace.",
        "Starr: The Palace. Why?",
        "Cole: Go to my mom's room, okay? I've got some stuff there that will take the edge off.",
        "Starr: What are you talking about?",

        "Dorian: I'm just sor -- I can't. I have to keep my wits about me. This hearing is bearing down on us.",
        "Jack: Give it up, Aunt Dorian. You promised me you would help me with my Native-American diorama.",
        "Dorian: Why aren't you at school?",
        "Jack: You signed a note, remember? I got the day off.",
        "Dorian: Right. Um -- I have errands to run, but I know somebody who can help you with the diorama.",

        "Jack: Huh, him?",
        "Dorian: Yes. Yes?",
        "Ray: Yes. It so happens, Jack, I'm the world's greatest expert on all things Native-American, especially as it pertains to the colonists taking advantage of them.",
        "Dorian: And if you don't study history, you're condemned to repeat it.",

Do you remember when we were at that party with Brittany, and she spilled that drink all over me, and that really hot guy lent me his sweats to change into? That's when the football player and the geeky girl became friends. At first, it started out that they were just friends. Then it turned out that they were much, much more. They loved each other. They had some major problems. But whenever they were together, it felt right. It was good. They loved each other so, so much. And then the geeky girl's father did a terrible thing. He told them that they were never going to see each other again. So they made love. It was beautiful.",

The fact that you involved your toddler in an automobile accident while he was in the front seat of your car, not in a car seat. Oh, that didn't prove you unfit and lose you custody, no.

        "Starr: He was not dumb. He was sweet. And he treated the geeky girl better than any boy had ever treated her. But her messed-up father couldn't see that. He thought that all boys were like him when he was young. So he did awful things to the boy the geeky girl loved. Please, dad, you're going to kill him.",

They tried to stay together, but it was too hard. They could barely even be friends. And then they lost the baby. And that was just the worst.",
