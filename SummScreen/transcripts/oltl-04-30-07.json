        "Talia: I hope you like this stuff.",
        "Antonio: Sahid?",
        "Talia: Antonio. I didn't see you out there.",
        "Antonio: I just took Jamie in for some final tests.",
        "Talia: Yeah?",
        "Antonio: Is that from you?",
        "Talia: Oh, no, no, no. That's from the sugar plum fairy. She's been sighted in the vicinity.",
        "Antonio: Oh.",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: Oh, so you better open up a case file.",
        "Talia: I know, I'm on it.",

        "Talia: I wasn't sure if she was into dolls and that sort of thing. I never was.",

        "Talia: You have no idea.",
        "Antonio: I see. Well, Jamie -- Jamie is a bit of a mashup.",
        "Talia: Mashup?",
        "Antonio: It's kind of like, you know, salsa meets jazz.",
        "Talia: Oh. Ok.",
        "Antonio: A little bit of me, a little bit of her mother. She amazes me.",
        "Talia: Well, if you can be talking about music and mashups, then clearly your daughter is on the mend.",
        "Antonio: Yes. Yes, she is. And Jessica and I will be taking her home tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Will you stop looking at me?",
        "Nash: Well, will you stop being beautiful?",
        "Jessica: Ok, Nash, I'm serious, please.",
        "Nash: Oh, come on, what's wrong?",
        "Jessica: Oh -- nothing.",
        "Nash: See? That's what I thought. I thought we were pretty darn good -- twice. What? If that's not enough, I can continue --",
        "Jessica: I smell like you.",
        "Nash: Hmm, I smell bad.",
        "Jessica: No, no. We shouldn't have done this. We should have waited.",
        "Nash: Waited? We have been waiting for weeks. You know what? If we had waited any longer, I would have been out of town and you would have been back with that --",
        "Jessica: With my husband and my two kids. Trying to heal the family that I hurt instead of ruining it forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Want something to drink or something to eat or anything?",
        "Cristian: No, no, thanks, I'm good.",
        "Evangeline: God. I don't know how to do this. Do you?",
        "Cristian: Not a clue.",
        "Evangeline: Three minutes. You know, that's the quickest I ever argued a motion.",
        "Cristian: No kidding? Why so fast?",
        "Evangeline: Well I was arguing for a continuance, and judges hate giving those out because they think they drag out the case, so -- so I figured if I talked really fast, I'd give the impression that I'd keep things moving along, you know?",
        "Cristian: Did it work?",
        "Evangeline: I got the continuance, and I got the acquittal.",
        "Cristian: That's you -- go for it and get what you want.",
        "Evangeline: Not always.",
        "Evangeline: What are you drawing?",

        "Cristian: Sure.",
        "Evangeline: Wow.",
        "Cristian: Hmm.",
        "Evangeline: Look what you can do in three minutes. Less.",
        "Cristian: Well, it's easy to do when it's something you love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Get off me! Don't you have someone that'll grope under your G.S.A.?",
        "Langston: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak lame-O. Where's amber to translate?",
        "Britney: Ha, ha. I'm peeing myself.",
        "Langston: I know the feeling. Watching you chase after a guy who would rather be devoured by feral dogs than be anywhere near you -- it's a laugh riot.",
        "Britney: Is that some of your geeky sci-fi? Because I haven't met a guy like that on the planet.",
        "Langston: Oh, really? Because there's one right over there.",
        "Singer: If I had known that then",
        "Cole: Please.",
        "Singer: My eyes were wide open I still believe I would've missed it",
        "Starr: Ok, but only for one dance.",
        "Cole: That's all I'm asking for.",
        "Singer: I was damaged by the fall got the wind knocked out of me",
        "Starr: I'm sorry, but this isn't going to work. We have to dance like this. That's much better.",
        "Singer: I have come to see something strong and beautiful inside of me I must be invincible",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alarm rings]",
        "Evangeline: It's time.",
        "Cristian: Well, do you want to do it together?",
        "Evangeline: Not yet. If it's positive, my life will never be the same.",
        "Cristian: I want kids.",
        "Evangeline: I want kids, too. But not like this. I mean, I wanted to be married. And I wanted to be ready, you know?",
        "Cristian: We'll work it out. Go ahead.",
        "Cristian: Ok, so -- are we having a baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I'm so glad your kid's going to be ok.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, we dodged a bullet.",
        "Talia: Well, everybody needs a run of good luck sometimes, especially when your life gets crazy.",
        "Antonio: My life's getting crazy?",
        "Talia: I mean in general.",
        "Antonio: Really?",
        "Talia: Ok, you've been in a mood.",
        "Antonio: How so?",
        "Talia: Antonio, I work with you, ok? I -- it's obvious there's been stuff on your mind.",
        "Antonio: And it's obvious to me that you're dancing around something that you want to tell me.",
        "Talia: Ok, is everything all right with Jessica?",
        "Antonio: What kind of question is that?",
        "Talia: Well, what happened at the adoption hearing -- it's kind of an open secret at the station. Oh. Look, I'm not trying to pry. I -- I suck at ignoring the elephant in",
        "Antonio: There is no elephant in the room. I mean, it's just that Jessica and I have a few things we need to work out, that's all.",
        "Talia: Ok, did you?",
        "Antonio: Excuse me?",
        "Talia: Look, I have zero tact when it comes to this stuff. I just -- I want you to know where I stand.",
        "Antonio: And where is that?",
        "Talia: If you need to do any unloading, you can unload on me.",
        "Antonio: Well, I appreciate your concern, Talia. But Jessica and I -- we're fine. And Jessica's not the problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: All right, would you try to relax?",
        "Jessica: Huh. Well, that is kind of hard when I'm just picturing this really prime spot that I have worked out for myself -- in hell.",
        "Nash: All right, well, you know what? Then you better slide over, sister. Because you know what? I'm planning on toasting my buns right along beside you.",
        "Jessica: Ok, I really don't understand how you can be so blas\u00e9 about all of this.",
        "Nash: I'm not being blas\u00e9 about this.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Nash: All right, look, the last thing I want to do is to even put, like, a sad face on the face of that little girl, Jamie. But if I'm coming across as overconfident, that's my job. Ok? That's what I'm here for. To be confident. You know that I love you, that you're doing the right thing. Yes, this way, people are going to get hurt.",
        "Jessica: Antonio most.",
        "Nash: But this way, everybody's going to get hurt the least.",
        "Jessica: Mostly us.",
        "Nash: No. Just think about it. Imagine you actually do go back to Antonio, all right? And let's imagine that he knows how much you love me, because he does. You think that he's going to be happy being married to a woman who's in love with another man? No, he's not. This is the best thing to do. I want you to remember that when you're doing the hard part -- leaving him. Leaving him.",
        "Jessica: I can't believe this. I can't believe I'm really going to do this.",
        "Nash: Ok. You ever jumped out of an airplane, you know, skydive?",
        "Jessica: Nash, shut up.",
        "Nash: No, no, no, I'm not being glib. Go with me on this.",
        "Jessica: No, Nash, I've never been skydiving before.",
        "Nash: Ok. All right, well, the first time, it totally blows your freaking mind. No, no, I'm serious. I mean, you know you got this chute, and it's supposed to work, but somehow you just can't get your head around the fact that you are 10,000 feet up in the air and you are dropping like a bag of bananas. You look down, you see the ground rushing up at you. It's like \"holy crap, man, I'm going to die!\" But you know what? You don't. You got your chute. It's above your head. I promise, I'm not going to let you fall. All right? I got you, babe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So what does it say?",
        "Evangeline: It's negative. Well -- that was a big deal for nothing.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Well -- I mean, if it had gone the other way --",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I know. My mind was going like a million miles an hour thinking of every different scenario, you know? Like -- what I was going to do about work.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I was thinking about that, too. I mean, for once, I'd have to hold a 9-to-5, I'm sure.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. I mean, I'd have to move. I couldn't raise a child in -- in this apartment.",
        "Cristian: Oh, for sure. I want my kids to live in a house.",
        "Evangeline: With a patio.",
        "Cristian: With a backyard. And a fire pit. So we could camp out, you know, roast marshmallows.",
        "Evangeline: Whoa, camping? Camping?",
        "Cristian: Well, wait, don't worry. Don't worry. We'd be close enough to civilization where you could use your blow-dryer -- all your other electronics.",
        "Evangeline: What electronics?",
        "Cristian: We got carried away, didn't we?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, for two people who never planned on being pregnant, we put a lot of thought into it.",
        "Cristian: Well, the way I pictured it, there was a lot of \"we\" going on.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, for me, too. I mean, I couldn't do it alone, Cristian, and I wouldn't want to. And -- and for two parents that aren't, you know -- but still we still want -- I mean, I'm -- I'm just saying that we would have had to really work together, you know?",
        "Cristian: Do you think we would have gotten back together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Ok, so if Jessica's not the problem, what is?",
        "Antonio: You know, all this kind of curiosity is a little strange coming from a woman who likes to keep her business under lock and key.",
        "Talia: Uh-huh. Hey, it's not curiosity.",
        "Antonio: No?",
        "Talia: Antonio, I think of you as a friend. Look, you can only work with someone for so long before you start to think of them either as a friend or as an enemy. And I sure don't want you as an enemy.",
        "Antonio: Well, you don't have to worry about that.",
        "Talia: You can call it personal interest if you want. I just think it's important to check in with my boss/friend --",
        "Antonio: Mm-hmm.",
        "Talia: Every once in a while --",
        "Antonio: I see.",
        "Talia: And make sure you're ok.",
        "Antonio: Ok. Look, there is a situation, it's affecting my marriage, but I will deal with it. The first thing I got to focus on is getting Jamie home safely.",
        "Talia: Awesome. Ok. And then what?",
        "Antonio: And then I fix things with Jessica. But the first thing I got to do is get rid of Nash Brennan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You know, I like this airplane analogy. Because right now I would rather jump out of a plane than go and tell Antonio -- what? What? That -- that I -- I love him, but I love you more, and I've cheated on him, and now I want to spend the rest of my life with you?",
        "Nash: Yeah. No, that is a little bit blunt. But you know, let's not -- let's go with the best case scenario. I really think that once he's had time to process the whole thing, and he incorporates the whole integration thing, you know, I -- I think he'll be cool with it --",
        "Jessica: \"Cool with it\"? Are you crazy?",
        "Nash: What choice has the gut?",
        "Jessica: And -- Nash -- hmm -- this is the worst possible betrayal that I could ever do to the life Antonio and I built together. And no matter how I spin it to him, that's how he's going to see it.",
        "Nash: Yeah, we were pretty awful.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, uh-huh. We were. I -- I can ride out him being mad at me. Ok? I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about what happens after he's finished being mad with me.",
        "Nash: You don't think he'd hurt himself?",
        "Jessica: No, I don't. But I think he'd hurt you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Karma's a bitch, ain't it?",
        "Britney: Sorry, don't speak hippy. Where's your unwashed family to translate?",
        "Langston: Oh, I'm happy to. Starr out there with Cole while you're benched on the sidelines. That's several kinds of payback. Clear enough for you, brat- ney?",
        "Britney: You get that from your seventh grade joke book?",
        "Langston: At least I can read it. Now Henry can rest easy knowing that his competition's found someone better. Oh -- oh, no wait, that's right -- he can't rest because he's going to be up all night doing your homework while you're here getting dissed. Do you think he's going to be upset when he finds out he exists only to serve you?",
        "Britney: That insect needs to learn his place. I want what I want. And what I want is for Henry to be my school slave, for Cole to be my sex slave, and for you to jump off a cliff.",
        "Langston: Well, then you'd better be nice to your school slave because you're never getting Cole.",
        "Britney: Watch how jealousy works.",
        "Cole: What is Britney doing?",
        "Starr: Oh, she's being the slut that she usually is. I can't even stand to look at her.",
        "Cole: Better?",
        "Starr: Yes, much. Thank you.",
        "Cole: I feel like such a dork dancing with you like some random girl.",
        "Starr: Well, this is the way it has to be.",
        "Cole: Yeah, because of our parents. I mean, you're not the \"go along to get along\" type, Starr. I think, you know, they really have done a number on you.",
        "Starr: Look, Cole, you know that the only reason why I'm even acting like this is because my dad almost tried to kill you.",
        "Cole: I can protect myself.",
        "Starr: God, the situation is so impossible. I love my parents, but --",
        "Cole: You what?",
        "Starr: I want to kiss you so badly right now.",
        "Cole: Ok, then do it.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Starr: Mom? Mom, why are you calling me again?",
        "Blair: Um, how's the party, baby?",
        "Starr: You s? I knew it. I knew you would change your mind about me being here.",
        "Blair: No. No, no. I just wondered if your dad tried to contact you at all.",
        "Starr: No, he hasn't. Isn't he with you?",
        "Blair: Um -- you know, our wires got crossed somehow and -- don't worry about it. You just have a good time, ok?",
        "Starr: Ok. Bye.",
        "Cole: Is everything all right?",
        "Starr: Yeah, it was -- it was just my mom. She's acting really crazed. And I'm over it.",
        "Cole: Cool. Look, so, obviously our one dance is over now. But you can still have that kiss, if you want it.",

        "[Todd groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Did I just hear you threaten a civilian?",
        "Antonio: No, come on.",
        "Talia: What? You got to get rid of Nash Brennan.",
        "Antonio: You know what I meant by that.",
        "Talia: Well, what happened to just making things work with Jessica?",
        "Antonio: Still putting my family first.",
        "Talia: Oh, you're putting them first -- by going after that clown?",
        "Antonio: Look, I can't get into details, all right? But some of the issues that my family is dealing with only exist because of Nash. All right? Jessica's problems Jamie's accident -- all of it.",
        "Talia: Jamie was hit by a car.",
        "Antonio: The bottom line, Talia, I have to protect my girls.",
        "Talia: And I get that -- I do. I respect that. But the way you're talking, it makes -- it makes it sound like it's going to end up in sirens and lights.",
        "Antonio: I'm going to send a message.",
        "Talia: Oh -- spoken like a true ex-con. I don't have a family, and I have no place telling you what to do with yours.",
        "Antonio: You're damn right.",
        "Talia: Ok, but this situation -- it's got \"domestic disturbance\" written all over it. And who's going to explain to your little girl why daddy's being led off in cuffs for decking daddy Nash? Or worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: All right, look. You know, I -- I -- I just think that everybody blows this whole \"Antonio's bad temper\" thing way out of proportion. He's not a maniac, you know?",
        "Jessica: Ok, first of all, I'm not everybody. Second of all, I never said he was a maniac, but he is protective. He's protective over the people that he calls family.",
        "Nash: Ok, well, even if things do end up being like, what you call, a beat- down or whatever, you don't got to worry -- I'm going to be fine.",

        "Nash: I'm not brushing this off. It is just that you and Bree seem to have this amazing, rejuvenating power over me -- I mean, look at me. Look at me like I'm looking you. Yesterday, I was leaving town, I was out of here, I had nothing to live for. Now, I got a beautiful girl and a beautiful little girl. And a purpose -- you know what that purpose is? Do you know what that purpose is?",

        "Jessica: I know.",

        "Blair: Yeah, well, we were, but then he got a lead on his son, so we decided to stay and check it out.",

        "Blair: Well, uh -- we were waiting for a call, I fell asleep, and when I woke up, he -- he's gone.",
        "Evangeline: How long ago was that?",
        "Blair: Well, I was asleep for about, I'd say, an hour, and he could've left at any time.",
