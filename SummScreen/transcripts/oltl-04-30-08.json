        "Michael: Yeah, I can't -- I can't talk about that with you.",
        "Michael: No, there's -- no. Uh, look, I -- I don't know what happened between you and Antonio and my brother and -- and I realize that it's probably none of my business, but --",
        "John: You're right, Mike -- it's really none of your business.",
        "Michael: Okay, yeah. I don't want to get in the middle of this.",
        "Talia: Nobody's asking you to. I just want to know if I can help.",
        "Michael: Okay, well, ask Antonio. Really, it's his call.",
        "Talia: Look, even though it's awkward, I still care about Antonio. I mean, Jamie's his whole life. And I heard you, I know this might be a really expensive treatment and his situation -- Michael, he can't do this by himself.",

        "Jamie: She used to be my mommy.",
        "Nash: Well, are you having a good time here with your uncle? I mean, you're up awfully late for such a smart, big girl, aren't you?",
        "Cristian: Her sitter bailed and my mom's been busy, so I get to spend time with my beautiful niece.",

        "Jessica: Well -- Sarah and Nash were there, too.",
        "Carlotta: Yeah, I know, and I appreciate it. But I know how much your support means to Cristian. He -- he knows that I don't approve of what he did, but I know that Talia and John provoked him. Now, he didn't want me to come to the jail, so I'm glad you were there.",
        "Jessica: Well, Cristian's my friend and -- uh, well, you know, once upon a time, you were my friend, too. And I know that this is a lot to ask after what happened between Antonio and me, but I'd really like it if we were friends again. I mean, it would mean the world to me.",

        "Blair: Uh -- her Aunt Viki's downstairs and just wants to see her.",
        "Langston: Oh, um, you know, I think she went downstairs to the kitchen to get something to eat.",

        "Langston: I just had to lie to Starr's parents, but I think Mr. Manning knew it.",
        "Markko: Oh, Mr. Manning always thinks everyone's lying.",
        "Langston: Oh, I -- I hate this.",
        "Markko: I know, I know. But, hey, after tonight, we won't have to lie. You know, we don't know where Starr and Cole went.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but we still know that Starr's pregnant and Cole's the father.",
        "Markko: Starr still there?",
        "Langston: No, she just left to go meet up with Cole. I hope she made it.",

        "Cole: Starr, come on, why are you just standing there?",
        "Viki: Starr? Is everything all right?",
        "Cole: Starr, come on. If we don't leave right now, we're not going to make it.",
        "Viki: Starr?",
        "Viki: Starr, what are you doing, honey?",
        "Starr: Uh --",
        "Cole: What -- what is she doing?",
        "Starr: Aunt Viki, um, I didn't know that you were here.",
        "Viki: Well, sweetheart, I came to bring your scarf back. You left it at the coffee shop today.",

        "Viki: Yeah, you did seem to have a lot on your mind.",
        "Starr: Do my mom and dad know that you're here?",
        "Viki: Yes, sweetheart. They're upstairs putting Sam and Jack to bed.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Oh, man. Cole and Starr are gone already. I mean, if everything's going as planned, they should be in his car and on their way by now.",
        "Langston: I hope everything went all right.",
        "Markko: Langston, I'm worried about you.",
        "Langston: Dude, I'm not the one who's 16, pregnant, and on the run.",
        "Markko: I -- I know, but Mr. Manning is going to figure out Starr's gone any minute now.",
        "Langston: I'm not scared of him.",
        "Markko: Uh -- you're not?",
        "Langston: No. I can handle him.",
        "Markko: It's going to be weird in that house now.",
        "Langston: I'm going to miss her so much.",
        "Markko: I know. But I'm here, all right -- any time, any place you need me.",
        "Langston: Thanks.",
        "Markko: Just try to keep telling yourself Starr and Cole did the right thing. They did what they had to do.",
        "Langston: I hope it was the right thing.",
        "Markko: Yeah. Yeah, I've been thinking about that a lot lately, you know -- like if you were having my kid, I would do anything, I mean, anything to take care of you.",
        "Langston: That's so sweet. But watching Starr go through all this, I know one thing -- I'm never getting pregnant by accident.",
        "Markko: Oh, shoot. I got to get back to work, but call me anytime, all right?",
        "Langston: Thanks.",

        "Antonio: Good.",
        "Ramsey: All in all, things went smoothly?",
        "Antonio: Routine bust, just like I said.",
        "Ramsey: Oh. Who would've guessed a few months ago you and I would work so well?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, that's what it's all about, right -- getting along?",
        "Ramsey: Nah, you're too modest, but I've noticed that about you.",
        "Antonio: What's that, Sir?",
        "Ramsey: Well, that silent, earnest thing you've got going. You take the weight of the world, let it rest on your shoulders. You mind if I give you a little off-the-record advice?",
        "Antonio: Can I stop you?",
        "Ramsey: No. But I think it would be a bad idea to not tell your mother and brother about your daughter's illness. Serious illness of a little girl like that -- not something you want to go through alone if you don't have to.",
        "Antonio: Right. Yeah, well, uh, if my mom hears about what is wrong with Jamie, she's not going to take it well.",
        "Ramsey: Oh --",
        "Antonio: And neither will my brother, so it's just going to make things worse for me.",
        "Ramsey: Well, I know how your mother loves Jamie. She's going to resent you if you keep it from her.",
        "Antonio: But -- um, I -- I'd rather tell her about Jamie's illness once I have all this under control.",
        "Ramsey: I know about the money.",
        "Antonio: The money?",
        "Ramsey: Yeah. I heard Dr. McBain talk about how Jamie's expenses may not be covered by insurance.",
        "Antonio: Right.",
        "Ramsey: It takes a lot of planning for those expenses. That's what you meant when you said you were trying to get things under control, isn't it?",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Ramsey: Well, I'm sorry. I know it's none of my business. I don't mean to press you on items of a personal nature. We better get that back to the station before somebody walks away with it. Sweet temptation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Look, I understand that both of you are concerned about Antonio, but I can't talk to either of you about it.",
        "John: Yeah, we understand, Mike.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "John: You give us a minute? Look, there is something that maybe you can talk to me about.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "John: How are you and Marcie doing?",
        "Michael: We're fine.",
        "John: Don't give me that.",
        "Michael: What -- I'm living my life, John.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "John: Still putting in all those hours over at the hospital?",
        "Michael: Yeah, and I'm happy to be off suspension.",
        "John: The reason I'm asking is I ran into Marcie that day and it seemed like she didn't know what to do with herself.",
        "Michael: I -- we need the money, man. I got a couple of lawyer bills to pay, you know?",
        "John: Okay, all right. You need money, you come to me, all right? But I'm just wondering, with all due respect, are you sure you're not putting in all these overtime hours at the hospital because you're trying to avoid being at home?",
        "Michael: John, no.",
        "John: Just listen to me, Mike. I mean, you guys got problems, I understand. Anybody that went through what you guys went through would have problems.",
        "Michael: And we're working it out.",
        "John: When? When? Hey, look, I never thought I'd be the guy to say this, but -- do you think maybe you and Marcie -- maybe you need to talk to someone?",
        "Michael: Are you -- are you talking to me about therapy?",
        "John: I --",
        "Michael: Look, man, right now my therapy is working, all right, doing what I love to do.",
        "John: What about Marcie?",
        "Michael: You know that I love Marcie.",
        "John: Make sure she knows that.",
        "Michael: All right. Will you just tell Antonio that I was here, all right? He doesn't need to call me. You can just -- I'll see him tomorrow at Jamie's checkup.",
        "John: All right, see you later.",
        "Eddie: Hear that, Sahid? Even McBain's own brother -- he knows what you two did to Vega.",
        "John: What part of \"shut up\" are you not understanding? Huh?",
        "Talia: Well, I don't know about you, but I don't know how much more I can take.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: And I will see you later.",
        "Carlotta: And you can help me in the kitchen make the flan while your Uncle Cristian finishes his business with Nash and Sarah, and his friend Jessica.",
        "Jamie: Oh, boy.",
        "Carlotta: Come on.",
        "Nash: Wow. That's an improvement.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I can't believe it.",
        "Nash: So what's wrong?",
        "Jessica: Jamie just said I used to be her mother.",
        "Cristian: She's just a kid, Jess.",
        "Jessica: I know, I know, but it's true. I -- I was her mother or I was going to be, and now I'm not.",
        "Nash: Oh, look, you got Bree to take care of anyway, and she is running you ragged, so --",
        "Sarah: Yeah. Bree's a little terror.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Sarah: I think she has some Tina in her.",
        "Jessica: Have you heard from your mother lately?",
        "Sarah: No, that's par for the course. We don't talk.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry.",
        "Sarah: It's fine.",
        "Cristian: It's better than fine. That means I get to have Sarah all to myself.",
        "Nash: You okay?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I'm fine.",

        "Cole: Markko?",
        "Markko: Cole, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be with Starr.",
        "Viki: Are you sure there isn't something you'd like to tell me, Starr?",
        "Starr: Actually --",
        "Todd: I see you guys found each other.",
        "Viki: Yes, we did.",
        "Todd: Good.",
        "Blair: Did you get something to eat, Starr?",
        "Starr: Oh -- what?",
        "Blair: Well, Langston said that -- well, she told me that you were down in the kitchen looking for some food, but I couldn't imagine that after all that pizza.",
        "Starr: Well, I went into the kitchen and I was looking through the refrigerator and then I realized that I shouldn't be looking -- for something else to ea because I'm already full.",
        "Blair: Okay. Viki, can I make you some tea?",
        "Viki: Oh, it would be lovely. Thank you.",
        "Blair: Okay, great.",
        "Todd: I hate tea.",
        "Blair: I don't care what you like. I'll get you a beer. Let's give Starr and Viki some time alone, grumpy. Come on.",
        "Todd: Beer --",
        "Starr: You know, Aunt Viki, I would love to talk -- it's just me and Langston have a huge project due, so --",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Starr: I'll see you.",
        "Viki: Starr, hang on. Why did you just lie to your parents?",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Viki: Darling, I was in the kitchen. You were not in the kitchen.",
        "Starr: Aunt Viki, I had to lie to my dad. I told you he doesn't let me do anything. I can't even have my cell phone at night.",
        "Viki: Well, what is it that you don't want him to know? I mean, where were you going when I came in?",
        "Starr: I was going to meet up with Cole.",
        "Viki: Honey, when we talked this afternoon, you said you were going to try to do things your father's way for a little while. What happened?",
        "Starr: I can't do what my dad wants. Please, aunt Viki, you have to promise me that you're not going to tell my dad that I was going to meet up with Cole. If he knows that, then he's going to throw him in prison. He'll do it.",
        "Viki: Well, honey, he can't have Cole put in jail just because he doesn't like him.",
        "Starr: Well, he'll find a way.",
        "Viki: You were very anxious earlier. Is that because you knew you were planning to meet Cole tonight?",
        "Starr: I was trying to make my decision. My life's just a really big mess right now.",
        "Viki: Why, honey? Look, what have you not told me, hmm?",
        "Starr: I just feel like I'm in the middle of my dad and Cole and -- it's just killing me.",
        "Viki: Is Cole putting pressure on you?",
        "Starr: No, it's my dad.",
        "Viki: Look, I know how difficult your father can be. But he does seem to be trying to be more reasonable.",
        "Starr: What, pizza and a poker game? It means nothing.",
        "Viki: Well, can you give him some time, honey?",
        "Starr: I don't have time.",
        "Viki: You said that this afternoon, sweetheart. What is going on?",
        "[Blair giggles]",
        "Blair: It would be different.",
        "Todd: Everything all right here?",
        "Viki: Yeah, everything's fine. We're just catching up.",
        "Starr: Yeah. Thank you, Aunt Viki. Thank you so much.",

        "Starr: Langston --",
        "Langston: What are you still doing here? What happened?",
        "Starr: My Aunt Viki caught me when I was about to leave.",
        "Langston: Did she figure out what's going on? What -- did she see your bag?",
        "Starr: No, I -- do you really think that I would still be in one piece if someone figured out that I was going to go off with Cole? I can't believe this is happen-- I had to throw my bag outside.",
        "Langston: Well, what if your dad finds it?",
        "Starr: I don't know. I have to make sure that I get out there before anybody else does. I can't believe this is happening! Cole probably thinks that I've bailed on him!",
        "[Phone vibrates]",
        "Starr: You have your cell phone?",
        "Langston: Yeah --",
        "Starr: What'd you do, sneak it up here?",
        "Langston: Yes. Markko?",

        "Starr: Cole, I'm so sorry.",
        "Cole: Starr, what happened? I saw you standing there.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I know. I was about to leave and my Aunt Viki -- she was standing there and I couldn't go. Everybody's down in the living room.",
        "Cole: Okay, we have to leave tonight.",
        "Starr: Okay. So, great -- I'm supposed to pass my mom, my dad, and my Aunt Viki? I can't do that -- they're all in the living room. I can't just walk by them. I told them that I had to come upstairs and finish a project. Can't -- can't we just leave tomorrow, please? I -- oh, I don't understand. What's the difference?",
        "Cole: The difference is, is Jared nor John talked to each other. They'll figure out that I borrowed money from all of them, all right? They'll get suspicious -- it could ruin everything.",
        "Starr: Okay, then what are we supposed to do?",
        "Cole: You said that your family is in the living room, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah?",
        "Cole: Okay. Is there any way you could sneak down the stairs into the kitchen without anyone seeing you?",
        "Starr: I could try, but what about the guards?",
        "Cole: Okay. You can see the guard through the kitchen door, okay? Listen, the guard always walks past the gazebo down and around behind the shed and back, all right? That gives you plenty of time to reach the fence, and once you get there, take the path all the way down to the docks, okay?",
        "Starr: Oh -- okay. Well, what about my bag? I had to throw it onto the patio so that no one would see it.",
        "Cole: Okay, all right. I'll get it, okay, and I'll meet you down at the docks.",
        "[Starr sighs]",

        "Cole: Okay, what am I supposed to do, Markko? It around till he figures out that Starr's pregnant and gets crazier than he already is? All right, I've had it with him. He's not going to win.",

        "Sarah: Whoo. Sounds like you married a man of mystery.",
        "Nash: No, no mystery -- just business. What do you say we take a look at those proofs, huh?",
        "Sarah: Oh, yeah. Well -- oops, sorry, Jess. Wow.",
        "Jessica: Ooh.",
        "Sarah: These are amazing, Cristian. You really outdid yourself. I think this is some of your best work.",
