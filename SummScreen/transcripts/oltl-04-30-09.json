        "T\u00e9a: I'm so sorry, Starr. You and your brothers are legally under your father's care now.",
        "Todd: Okay, let's get your guys' coats, all right. Let's go, Starr.",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry, no?",
        "Starr: No, I can't leave here now.",
        "Todd: Well, why the hell not?",

        "Cole: Starr, please hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Are you sure Matthew didn't see us?",
        "Bo: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Nora: Why are you sure?",
        "Bo: Because this isn't the first stakeout I've ever been on, Nora.",
        "Nora: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Bo: Don't be sorry.",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Bo: I'm nervous, too.",
        "Nora: He did seem fine, though. Right? I mean, did you see the way that he wouldn't let the aide go inside the school after getting him in the wheelchair?",
        "Bo: I think he's going to be okay.",
        "Nora: Do you?",
        "Bo: Well, we could sit here just a few more minutes, you know, make sure.",
        "Nora: Yeah, it's his first day of school and everything.",
        "Bo: He's been dreading it.",
        "Nora: He's been so brave.",
        "Bo: Yeah, he has been.",
        "Nora: Five more minutes couldn't hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: You know, you didn't have to meet me at the door.",
        "Marcie: Look, Matthew -- I just came back to work myself last week so I was thinking maybe we could help each other get back into the swing of things.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I'd like that.",
        "Marcie: Great. You know, I'm really, really glad to have you in my English class.",
        "Matthew: Me, too. Oh, I did most of the reading while I was out.",
        "Marcie: Oh, that's terrific. That's great. Hey, Destiny.",
        "Destiny: Hey, Ms. M to the Mc-B. Dude, I'm really glad you're back.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, so are they. Now they actually have something to talk about.",
        "Destiny: Please, they'll be over it in three seconds and texting each other, and --",
        "Matthew: You know, maybe it will be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You sure those fake IDs don't look like fake IDs?",
        "John: I know a guy who knows a guy.",
        "Marty: I'm sure you do, John. But that's not going to help --",
        "John: Kevin.",
        "Marty: Kevin, right. Sorry, Kevin.",
        "John: Look, once she clears our IDs with security, we get in, we see Powell, and we get out before anyone figures we're not who we say we are.",
        "Dr. Kwon: Mr. Buchanan, Mrs. Brennan, we've got a problem.",
        "John: What's the problem?",
        "Dr. Kwon: You and your sister, Jessica, have been cleared by security as relatives of the patient.",
        "Marty: Oh, well then what else would be the --",
        "Dr. Kwon: You're the first family members to come visit Mr. Lord since he's been here with us. Do you see what I'm getting at?",
        "John: Not really.",
        "Marty: Well, you're afraid of how he might react to us, I assume.",
        "Dr. Kwon: That's it exactly. He's sedated a lot of the time, and even when he's not, he's confused. Since you've never been here before, I'm not sure that Mr. Lord will even remember he has cousins named Kevin Buchanan and Jessica Brennan. I don't know what he'll say or do when you tell him who you are.",
        "John: So is he considered dangerous?",
        "Dr. Kwon: Since coming here, only to himself. You'll see when you go in. Prepare yourself. He's restrained.",
        "John: So we can see him, then?",
        "Dr. Kwon: I'm not completely comfortable with it, but security has cleared you.",
        "Marty: But we'll be careful, and Kevin will be here with me.",
        "Dr. Kwon: I can only allow one of you in at a time.",
        "John: That's fine. I'll go.",
        "Marty: I'll go first.",
        "John: Um, Jessica, I'm not sure that's such a great idea.",
        "Marty: No, I think I can handle it, Kevin.",
        "John: Yes, I know, but --",
        "Marty: I have --",
        "John: If you're not prepared for this --",
        "Marty: I know, but I have experience with mental health facilities, remember?",
        "John: Yes, I know. But something could go wrong.",
        "Marty: And I will handle that -- I was closer to Powell than you were. Please let me do this.",
        "John: I'll wait here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: It's been great having you around as much as we have had -- you know, since Matthew's been hurt.",
        "Bo: Thanks.",
        "Nora: I mean, I know you are swamped at the station.",
        "Bo: Well, Matthew comes first.",
        "Nora: I know.",
        "Bo: You have been great with him.",
        "Nora: Thanks, so have you.",
        "Nora: We can't just sit here all afternoon. And he's in English class right now with Marcie McBain.",
        "Bo: Did you see that hotdog truck we passed on the corner?",
        "Nora: I haven't had a hotdog in ages.",
        "Bo: We might as well have lunch there. I mean, stakeout food for a stakeout.",
        "Nora: Sure. Beats sitting at our desk and eating.",
        "Bo: Yeah, you're not kidding. I'll be right back.",
        "Nora: Perfect, perfect.",
        "Bo: Any requests?",
        "Nora: You know what I like.",
        "Bo: I'll be right back.",
        "Nora: My poor baby boy. Please be okay in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You know, I hate the way the cleaning crew -- they bunch everything up overnight. Sorry about this, Matthew. We ordered you a special desk, but I guess it hasn't come in yet. There, that looks better. And you know what? This doesn't even belong here, does it? I'll be right back.",
        "Destiny: Question.",
        "Matthew: What?",
        "Destiny: What was with the \"what up\" to Becca out there in the hall just now?",
        "Matthew: Oh, we're cool now. Justin, too.",
        "Destiny: Is that so?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. They both came to my house and were really nice to me, believe it or not.",
        "Destiny: Not.",
        "Matthew: I mean, I'm not sure if I totally trust Justin, but Becca -- she was really cool.",
        "Destiny: I think they're playing you. I'm sorry, Matt, I really am. But I think they're playing you, and I think it's because of me.",
        "Matthew: What? Why?",
        "Destiny: I told those two that they could end up getting sued.",
        "Matthew: What are you talking about?",
        "Destiny: They made you run out of the dance which is why you got into the car and that's why you got into this big accident. I still think they're the reason, but it doesn't matter.",
        "Matthew: Back up. What kind of trouble could they get --",
        "Destiny: Look, I made some stuff up. I said they could be, like, accessories.",
        "Matthew: You know my mom is the D.A.? And I mean, if they were going to get in trouble --",
        "Destiny: Look, they bought it. I watch police shows when I can't sleep, okay? Anyway, I think they're being nice to you because they're afraid of your family suing theirs.",
        "Matthew: You know, that's really not a nice thing to say about my friends.",
        "Destiny: They're not your friends, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: You're just jealous.",
        "Destiny: Of those two morons?",
        "Matthew: Of Becca.",
        "Destiny: What would I have to be jealous of her for anyway?",
        "Matthew: Well, she's popular and cool, and you're --",
        "Destiny: I'm what?",
        "Matthew: Well, you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Starr, I asked you a question.",
        "Starr: What, this is my house. I don't want to leave. Isn't that enough?",
        "Dorian: Todd, can't you see she doesn't want to leave?",
        "Jack: It will be okay, Starr. It's Dad.",
        "Starr: Okay, then take the boys and I'll stay here.",
        "Todd: No. We're a family. I'm not splitting us up.",
        "Starr: It's a little late for that, isn't it? This is my house. I don't have to go. I am not a kid.",
        "Todd: Actually, according to Pennsylvania law, you are a kid.",
        "Starr: Oh, really? And when are you the expert on the law?",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr -- Starr, listen. When you turn 18, you can do what you want and live where you want, but until then --",
        "Starr: Look, I've been sick ever since I woke up this morning. I've been throwing up and -- why do you think I'm not in school?",
        "Jack: She told me the same thing this morning.",
        "Ray: Can't you wait one more day?",
        "Starr: Exactly. Why don't you take Jack and Sam? I'll meet up with you in the morning.",
        "Todd: This is not a negotiation.",
        "Starr: You are going to force me out of the house?",
        "Todd: If I have to, I'll call the police. They'll force you out of the house.",
        "Starr: What is wrong with you?",
        "Todd: I am your father. And if I tell you you are going to come live with me, you're damn well going to listen to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr, listen. Why don't I come upstairs and help you pack a bag if that's going to make things easier, huh? How about that, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. She'll come back. She'll come back. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. I'll be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I can pack on my own.",
        "Todd: I have a better idea. I'll send someone back here to get your stuff and we're going to leave now.",
        "Dorian: Todd, for the love of God.",
        "Starr: Look, I said I would go with you. Can't you just give me five minutes to pack underwear or something?",
        "Jack: Who cares about underwear? The real question is, do me and Sam get our own rooms? Our own TVs?",
        "Todd: You guys get everything you want. In fact, we should go buy new stuff.",
        "Jack: Yes!",
        "Dorian: Todd, she is a 17-year-old girl. She needs her things. Just give her five minutes.",
        "Jack: You know, I want some stuff, too. Like my Z-box, and my diary --",
        "Todd: All right, all right, all right. Hurry up, hurry up.",
        "Jack: Come on, Sam. We're going to dad's! Let's go.",
        "Dorian: You miserable excuse for a human being. That girl's entire life is in this house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm so sorry.",
        "Cole: What happened?",
        "Starr: My father is here.",
        "Cole: What? Does he know?",
        "Starr: Look, I know you said that you weren't hungry or thirsty but you need to promise me that you will eat and drink everything that I brought up here for you, okay? It's all a part of the detox. And when you are not eating or drinking you, need to be sleeping, okay? Do you hear me? You need to do all of those things.",
        "Cole: My legs feel like they're made of rubber.",
        "Starr: I know. They said that that would probably happen. But you will do everything I told you to, right?",
        "Cole: It sounds like you're not going to be here.",
        "Starr: I'm not, Cole. I'm not.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Starr: My dad's -- my dad got custody of the boys and me and he's taking us away. I have no choice but to go. I already tried a million times to tell him no but he said that he would call the police if I didn't go with him.",
        "Cole: Starr, I can't be here alone.",
        "Starr: I know, Cole. I'm sorry.",
        "Cole: Starr, no. I can't do it, I'll die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I feel more in control of the uncontrollable sitting out here while Matthew is in class. Do you know what I mean?",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bo: He would kill us if he knew we were out here.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm. I was thinking about that. I don't want to smother him. Okay, at least not any more than I did before he got hurt.",
        "Bo: You know what helps me get through?",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Bo: Knowing that at least we still have him to worry about.",
        "Nora: People have said that to me. Somehow it seems very different when you say it.",
        "Bo: Hmm. I don't know if I could handle what Matthew's been going through if I didn't know what it was like to lose a son -- to never see him again.",
        "Nora: God, Bo. We are so lucky, aren't we?",
        "Bo: Yeah, we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Be like that. I don't care. I tried.",
        "Matthew: You tried to make me hate people who are nice to me.",
        "Destiny: If that's how you see it, fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justin: Training wheels is back. Everyone is talking about it.",
        "Becca: I know. I saw him. I gave him a big hello wave. I'll make a huge deal out of it at lunch. Ask him to sit with me, and --",
        "Justin: We're done with that. Destiny is full of it.",
        "Becca: She is?",
        "Justin: That whole civil suit thing? I ran it by my dad.",
        "Becca: Yeah?",
        "Justin: Total joke.",
        "Becca: You're totally sure?",
        "[School bell rings]",
        "Justin: He says his tax money shouldn't be spent on building ramps for a public school. They can't sue us. They can't do anything.",
        "Becca: So you are saying I don't have to pretend to like him anymore?",
        "Justin: That's just what I'm saying.",
        "Marcie: Bell rang, guys. Come on, let's go. Hurry up. Keep moving.",
        "Marcie: All right. Did everyone get through the last 50 pages of \"Lord of the Flies\"? Okay, well, I'm loving your enthusiasm. How about some opinions? Even general ones to start? Becca?",
        "Becca: I thought it was kind of lame.",
        "Marcie: Lame? Really?",
        "Justin: Not as lame as Matthew Buchanan.",

        "Dr. Kwon: Your cousin is so docile. It's hard to believe he's a convicted rapist.",
        "Marty: Well, you can believe it. It's true.",
        "Dr. Kwon: Oh, I know. I mean, it just must have been very hard for your family.",
        "Marty: It was.",
        "Dr. Kwon: Well, we'll go in and --",
        "Marty: No. I mean, I would rather go in and see my cousin alone.",
        "Dr. Kwon: You would?",
        "Marty: Yes. I'm just afraid he might react if there is an authority figure in there with us. I mean, it's a secure room, right? There's a panic button, and I'm sure it's activated.",
        "Dr. Kwon: Yes.",
        "Marty: I'm going to be fine. And if I'm not, I won't hesitate to call.",
        "Dr. Kwon: Well, in the state he's in, he's pretty harmless to others.",

        "Dorian: This is outrageous.",
        "Todd: I agree. It should have happened weeks ago.",
        "Dorian: This was also Blair's greatest fear ever since she regained consciousness, and she was right.",
        "Todd: Then I guess she should have picked someone other than the local serial killer to be stepdad.",
        "Dorian: John is no killer. He's being framed, probably by you. And if you really did love those children the way you say you do, you wouldn't be ripping them away from the only home they have known for over a year.",
        "Todd: Well, I disagree. And you know, if you are going to pick the world's worst stepdad, you probably should have invested in a better lawyer.",
        "T\u00e9a: Shut up, Todd.",
        "Ray: Given that Blair is ill, perhaps a temporary injunction --",
        "Todd: Hey, hey, hey! Senor, why don't you mind your own business?",

        "Cole: Starr, you promised you would stay with me.",
        "Starr: What do you want me to do? If I keep fighting with my dad, then he's going to call my bluffs and call the cops. They'll come over here; they'll find out that you faked your last drug test, okay? Then they're going to call Nora and you'll be sent to prison.",
        "Cole: It just hurts so bad. I can't even describe it.",
        "Starr: I know. Uh, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call your counselor? What's her name -- Rachel?",
        "Cole: No, no, no, no. She'll have to report me.",
        "Starr: Okay, maybe I can tell Langston.",
        "Cole: No, Starr. No Starr, I can't. Starr, I can't. I already lied to Markko's face. I already got him messed up. Besides, I can't face him and Langston. Starr, I just want you here.",
        "Starr: I know, and I want to be here. You know that I do. The last place I want to be is my father's house right now.",

        "Nora: Oh, yeah.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: She and I are at odds right now. And it's serious.",
        "Bo: Is it something you can talk about?",
        "Nora: She took a job here at a drug treatment center.",
        "Bo: Well, that's great. She loves that. It's not the facility that Cole was remanded to and -- does she work with him?",
        "Nora: Oh, you could say that. She's his counselor.",
        "Bo: Oh, wow.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm. So my daughter is helping the kid who is responsible for paralyzing our son.",
        "Bo: Does Matthew know?",

        "Destiny: Those kids on the island. They were sick.",
        "Marcie: Sick?",
        "Destiny: I don't get how kids can be so mean to each other.",
        "Marcie: Oh, kids can be very mean. When I was in school, I was teased a lot, and even worse.",
        "Destiny: At least none of us killed each other.",
        "Becca: Yet.",

        "Marcie: The question I want to explore is this -- is it human nature to be cruel?",
        "Marcie: Justin!",
        "Justin: What? He threw it at me.",
        "Marcie: The boys on the island, they turn on Piggy. They make him a scapegoat. So, is it human nature to be cruel for no reason?",
        "Justin: There's always a reason.",
        "Marcie: Oh, there is?",
        "Justin: People get what's coming to them. Like the fat kid in the book. He was a total know-it-all.",
        "Marcie: And therefore he deserved to be killed? That's your observation about human nature?",
        "Justin: I suppose the author \"wheeled\" out some good ideas.",

        "Justin: Dude totally \"rolled\" with them.",

        "Marcie: There is nothing funny about what you are doing.",

        "Marcie: All right, that is it.",
        "Justin: Sorry.",
        "Marcie: I have had enough of you. I want you to get out of this class. Yes, Matthew?",
        "Matthew: I think most people are good.",
        "Marcie: Great, Matthew. Why don't you tell me why.",
