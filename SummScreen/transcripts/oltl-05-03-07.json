        "Blair: It is possible that it's not Todd's blood?",
        "Det. Morris: The test is a definitive DNA match. I'm sorry.",
        "Dorian: I think what my niece is trying to establish --",
        "Blair: He knows what I'm trying to establish, Dorian. Todd's hurt -- or worse.",
        "Det. Morris: We'll open an official investigation. Suspicion of foul play. But I have to be honest with you, Ms. Cramer. There really isn't anything to go on except that blood stain, and that could make it difficult.",
        "Blair: What have they done to you, Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Hey. Layla, finally. Sorry I'm late. It was traffic. How you doing?",
        "Layla: How am I doing? I'm going crazy wondering how you're doing. That's how I'm doing.",
        "Evangeline: Let's -- let's get some menus, ok?",
        "Layla: No, never mind the menus. Did you take the test? Are you pregnant?",
        "Evangeline: Shh.",
        "Nash: Layla -- have either of you guys seen Jessica? I've been looking everywhere for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Why the hell won't they tell us anything? They ran an MRI, did all sorts of tests. Where the hell are the results?",
        "Viki: You have to take it easy, Antonio. It may very well turn out that it's nothing serious.",
        "Antonio: Well, it must have been something for her to collapse like that. What happened, Jess? What's wrong, honey?",
        "Natalie: Dad, don't worry yourself too much, ok? Look, we're -- we're all here with her. Yes, and you -- you're going to be here as soon as you can. I promise. As soon as we know something. I love you.",
        "Miles: Natalie -- what are you doing at the hospital?",
        "Natalie: It's my sister. She's sick.",
        "Miles: Jessica? Well, what's wrong with her?",
        "Natalie: We still don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So, what brings you by? Nothing serious, I hope.",
        "John: Actually, it is serious. It's about Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Ugh.",
        "Starr: How could Britney be such a bitch to Henry like that?",
        "Langston: She's like a ditzy robot.",
        "Starr: Yeah, she has no heart.",
        "Langston: And no brain. That's why she needed Henry to write her paper.",
        "Starr: Did she have to leave tread marks on Henry like that? God, I hate her!",
        "Langston: Imagine how Henry must feel -- if he's not still drooling over her.",
        "Starr: How pathetic would that be?",
        "Langston: Right -- because it's so easy to get over somebody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: So I told Henry I'd repay him if he wrote my paper. What should I let him do? Kiss my -- Henry's voice: \"Britney will come to understand that we are meant to be together. She clearly doesn't know what's best for her. She needs someone to take care of her, someone who can think ahead for her. I have a plan. A plan for our lives.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Is Cole in trouble again?",
        "John: No, no, he's not.",
        "Marty: Well -- ok, then what?",
        "John: Off the record, he -- he came to see me and he and I talked for a good while.",
        "Marty: Well, did he say anything that worries you? Well, yeah -- of course he did. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to see me.",
        "John: Look, it's -- it's not about what he said, it's -- it's more about where he came to see me, and I felt obligated to come tell you about that.",
        "Marty: Well, where was it?",
        "John: The firing range during target practice. It's maybe not the best place for a kid to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Det. Morris: I'm available 24/7, Ms. Cramer, if you need my help.",
        "Dorian: Um -- if we need you, we will call.",
        "Det. Morris: All right. Well, let's go, then.",
        "Blair: Go without us.",
        "Det. Morris: I wouldn't stay here alone if I were you.",
        "Dorian: I -- I think we'll be able to take care of ourselves.",
        "Det. Morris: Well, good luck, then.",
        "Dorian: Blair --",
        "Blair: Stop, Dorian. If the next words out of your mouth are \"we're going to get on a plane and head back to Llanview,\" you can forget it.",
        "Dorian: No. Actually, what I was going to say is, what do you want to do now?",
        "Blair: What I want to do? I want to roll the clock back so I can figure out why Todd came here. But since I can't do that, I'm going to try to figure out what -- what he was looking to find here.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Blair: And who -- who would set him up like this? Who hates Todd's --",
        "Dorian: What is it? Blair, what are you thinking?",
        "Blair: I know who did this to him. I know who did this, Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I haven't seen Jessica in a while, sorry.",
        "Evangeline: Neither have I. Have you called Antonio or her family?",
        "Nash: Yes, I've called everyone. Nobody's calling me back. I mean -- jeez, I mean, I know Jamie's out of the hospital, so she can't be there.",
        "Evangeline: Did you check the loft?",
        "Nash: Yes, I checked the loft. They're not there -- not that Antonio would let me in even if they were.",
        "Layla: Is it possible that Jessica and Antonio went away for a few days?",
        "Nash: No. No, no, no. No, no, it's not. I was supposed to meet her here last night. She didn't turn up. She -- I haven't heard from her, and that's not like her, it's -- [Nash sighs] I'm sorry I bothered you.",
        "Evangeline: Don't worry about it. Strange. I can't believe Jessica would be meeting Nash here.",
        "Layla: Never mind his problems. Not that being pregnant would necessarily be a problem. I just --",
        "Evangeline: It isn't anything. I mean, it's not -- it's not anything.",
        "Layla: Oh, then you're --",
        "Evangeline: I'm not -- I'm not pregnant.",
        "Layla: The test was negative? Ok, dumb question. I guess that's good, isn't it? I know, I was kind of hoping for it when you first told me that you might be. Just because I thought you and Cristian may get back together. But if you really don't want to have a baby, then -- should we have a drink to celebrate your relief?",
        "Evangeline: I don't know how relieved I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You sure you haven't seen her?",
        "Bartender: She hasn't been here on my shift. I always remember Jessica.",
        "Nash: Jessica, where are you? What's wrong with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I wish she could tell us what's wrong with her.",
        "Miles: What happened? I mean, what could've caused her to collapse?",
        "Natalie: I don't know -- I mean, they've tested her for all the obvious things. You know, pregnancy, a virus. But you know, every time they keep ruling out something simple, it makes us more nervous.",
        "Miles: Can I see her?",
        "Natalie: Well, mom and Antonio are in there with her right now, and she really needs her rest. I'll -- I'll give her your wishes.",
        "Miles: No, that -- thank you. You call me if I can do anything. Bye.",
        "Natalie: Hey. Did she wake up at all?",
        "Viki: No, darling, but you know, they sedated her for the tests, so she probably won't come around for a while.",
        "Natalie: God, it's just so weird. I mean, seeing Jessica like this, you know, it's just -- it's not right not having Jessica around being Jessica. But, hey, you know, she's going to be up and out of here bossing us around soon.",
        "Viki: Jessie?",
        "Jessica: Is he here?",
        "Antonio: I'm right here, baby.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I was looking for you. Of course, I was looking for you.",
        "Antonio: How are you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm -- fine. I'm a little tired, though, and I'm achy. What time is it?",
        "Viki: It's 1:00 in the afternoon, sweetheart.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Antonio: Why?",
        "Jessica: Oh, no reason. Um -- where's Jamie and Bree?",
        "Antonio: Well, Bree's fine. Jamie's home now. You need to rest.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Guys, what, did somebody die? I said I was fine.",
        "Viki: Good. You're actually getting some color back into your face.",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Natalie: I spoke with dad. I mean, he's chartering planes all over the place just to get home so he can see you.",
        "Jessica: There's no reason to do that. I just have a bug or something.",
        "Viki: Well, then maybe you'll be all better by the time he gets back.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "Jessica: Um -- no, I -- I can't help but worry about the girls. I -- I mean -- Bree -- doesn't Nash want to be with Bree? Isn't it his day or something?",
        "Antonio: No, actually, he's not scheduled to be with her till tomorrow.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "[Phone vibrates]",
        "Antonio: Hold on. It's R.J. he's calling about Jamie.",
        "Jessica: That's ok, go get it. Give her my love.",
        "Antonio: All right, I'll be right back, ok?",
        "Viki: See if the test results are in, ok?",
        "Natalie: You go, mom. I'll stay here with her.",
        "Viki: I'll be right back.",
        "Natalie: So -- feeling better?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, Natalie, I'm fine. I'm just a little restless, that's all.",
        "Natalie: You're going to be out of here soon.",
        "Jessica: Uh -- does Nash know I'm in the hospital?",
        "Natalie: I'm guessing not, or I'm sure he'd be fighting with Antonio to come in here and see you. What's going on, Jess? Are you starting to feel for Nash what he feels for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Yes, Jessica, it's me, Nash, for the gazillionth time. Please, look, I'm getting really worried about you. When you -- when you get this, please call me back. Let me know that you're ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Are you saying you wish you were pregnant?",
        "Evangeline: For the time I thought I was pregnant, I went through every conceivable thought and permutation of what that would -- might mean to me, you know? I was terrified and I was confused. But I was also kind of excited. Thinking about the fact that Cristian and I might have created a life together.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "Evangeline: Thinking about what an adventure it would be to raise a child.",
        "Layla: So it actually was a letdown when the test was negative?",
        "Evangeline: I went back and forth. Sometimes I was scared to death, and then the next minute, I would be thrilled. And if I was that conflicted about a pregnancy that wasn't real, imagine how I would have felt if I was actually carrying a child.",
        "Layla: You'd have dealt with it, the way you deal with everything. You'd have risen to the occasion. And I think that -- no, I know you'll be an amazing mother one day.",
        "Evangeline: I don't know. Maybe m too selfish,. I mean, you know how I am about my work and -- and my freedom.",
        "Layla: No, I do. That's why it's probably better that it's not happening right now. Isn't it? Better?",
        "Evangeline: I don't know. I just -- I can't help feeling let down.",
        "Layla: Vange, it's me here.",
        "Evangeline: Maybe -- maybe I'm more ready to have a child than I ever thought I could be, you know? Cristian's child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Hey.",
        "Bartender: What can I get you?",
        "Miles: Whatever you have on tap.",
        "Nash: Look, is there any way that you can check with the other people here, if they've seen Jessica?",
        "Bartender: She stood you up, man. Deal with it.",
        "Miles: You mean Jessica Vega?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Who was it, Blair? Who do you know did this to Todd?",
        "Blair: I told Todd about it. I told him. Why wouldn't he listen to -- why didn't I make him listen to me?",
        "Dorian: Who was it, honey? Who hurt Todd?",
        "Blair: Spencer Truman.",
        "Dorian: Blair, listen to me. I -- you know, you're upset. You haven't slept for several days.",
        "Blair: I'm thinking clearly, ok?",
        "Dorian: But how could you? The -- Spencer Truman is dead and gone. There's no way that he has hurt Todd",
        "Blair: Did you see the body?",
        "Dorian: No, I didn't have that personal pleasure. Blair, please. I do -- I do remember, though, that -- that he was attacking you, someone burst into the room, killed him. And the police have conducted an investigation into a murder.",
        "Blair: What if he faked his death, huh? What if it was an elaborate ploy to make everybody believe that he was dead, huh? And then he had this perfect alibi and the means to go after Todd? It works.",
        "Dorian: Ok, fine, that's a wonderful conspiracy theory. But it has no foundation. Spencer Truman is dead and gone, ok? There's no way that he hurt Todd.",
        "Blair: Well, somebody did, Dorian. Are you telling me that I'm -- I'm imagining all of this?",
        "Dorian: No. No, you're not imagining it.",
        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: I think -- something probably did happen to Todd. But, honey, I -- I wish there was some way that I could help you find him.",
        "Blair: I do, too. But it looks like I'm going to have to call the one person that could possibly have heard from Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Don't look so shocked.",
        "Layla: I'm not. At first when you told me that you might be pregnant, I actually thought it could be a great thing. But now that you're not, it's just that --",
        "Evangeline: What? What, you think it's a bad thing? What, you think I'm not mom material?",
        "Layla: Don't be so defensive. Didn't I just say two minutes ago that you'd be an amazing mother? And I was just thinking, now that we know it's not happening, it could be best for you to put your biological clock on hold for now.",
        "Evangeline: Can I just have a conversation with my sister without this turning into a lecture?",
        "Layla: Oh, like you never lecture me?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, but I'm your older sister, and that's what we do.",
        "Layla: I forgot -- younger sisters are just supposed to shut up and obey.",
        "Evangeline: Exactly.",
        "Layla: Fine. Do whatever you want, whenever you want. I won't say a word. Not one.",
        "Evangeline: Good.",
        "Layla: Vange, I'm sorry. You're amazing, nurturing, and mature. And if you want to have a child, then you should do it.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you. Oh, you know what I was just thinking?",
        "Layla: Wt?",
        "Evangeline: What it would do to Mom.",
        "Layla: Oh, my God.",
        "Evangeline: You know what she would hate?",
        "Layla: No more lying about her age.",
        "Evangeline: And you know, that whole name thing.",
        "Layla: \"Grandma\" is definitely out.",
        "Evangeline: And any derivative thereof.",
        "[Phone vibrates]",
        "Evangeline: Hmm.",
        "Layla: Who is it?",
        "Evangeline: I don't recognize the number. Hello?",
        "Blair: Hey, Evangeline, it's Blair.",
        "Evangeline: Hey. How's it going in Chicago? Did you get any lead on Todd's son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Yes, I mean Jessica Vega.",
        "Miles: Well, I can see that you're worried, and you obviously haven't heard.",
        "Nash: Heard what?",
        "Miles: Well, I was visiting someone last night a hospital and I ran into Natalie, and she said her sister was in the hospital.",
        "Nash: Why?",
        "Miles: Jessica collapsed. I mean, they're running tests. They're not sure what's wrong with her yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I am close with Nash, Natalie. We share a child.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Is that it, though? Is that all you share?",
        "Jessica: Look, I know you got into it with Nash when Jamie was in the hospital, but --",
        "Natalie: Yes, because he was so fired up to see you. I was protecting you.",
        "Jessica: I can take care of myself, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Yes, I know -- usually. But this -- look, Jess, it's starting to look like Nash is a big presence in your life.",
        "Jessica: How can he not be a presence? He's Bree's father.",
        "Natalie: I understand that. You are Antonio's wife. And you have a wonderful marriage. And I'd hate to see this guy messing things up for you.",
        "Jessica: Hey, is everything ok?",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Antonio: Jamie's fine. R.J.'s trying to get her to rest. Have I told you how important you are to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Look, I only bring this up because -- you know, Cole -- he told me his dad was sort of a pacifist, and he -- he was always preaching to him about nonviolent ways and stuff.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Yeah, and that's why, you know, he was so upset by his own violent reaction to the steroids. It goes against everything he's learned, everything he is.",
        "John: Yeah, he -- he said that to me, not in so many words, but --",
        "Marty: Huh. He really opened up to you.",
        "John: Oh, I don't know. I -- I'm just glad if I can help.",
        "Marty: Yeah. You know, when he was a little boy, he was -- was curious about everything. And when his dad died, he -- he didn't want to go out, he didn't want to talk to anybody, not even his friends. He just -- stayed home with me.",
        "John: He's come a long way.",
        "Marty: Yes, he has. You know, before we moved back to Llanview, he never got into any trouble. I just -- but I think, you know, that is all behind us now. I hope it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So I hear something really bad went down before between Britney and Henry?",
        "Starr: Oh, no, no, no. It was worse than bad. You should have heard the stuff that Britney was saying to him.",
        "Langston: Henry made her a backup copy of the paper he wrote for her.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and then she grabbed it and started telling him what a loser he was.",
        "Langston: That nobody likes him. That he's like road kill or something.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: God, why does she do that? All Henry tried to do was help her.",
        "Starr: You could try to save that girl, and she would still treat you like crap. Maybe not you.",
        "Langston: And speak of the devil.",
        "Britney: You two need to be to be kept away from each other.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and your mouth needs to be wired shut. What the hell is wrong with you, saying that stuff to Henry? I mean, do you get off on torturing people or something?",
        "Langston: She needs her daily blood fix.",
        "Britney: Oh -- so Mrs. Mc-Pain-In-The-Ass is announcing the cast list for the musical tomorrow. I wonder if you and I will get the leads.",
        "Langston: I'm writing the lead, and I would rather see my dog play the part than you. He's got more talent in his tail -- and better hair.",
        "Henry: I have something for you.",
        "Britney: Are you like, proposing to me?",
        "Henry: It's not a ring. Remember these? When we were at the mall, you said you really liked them.",
        "Britney: Huh, you idiot. I was kidding. I said I liked them because I hated them. And why are they going to hurt me, because they're so ugly?",
        "Henry: No. When I told the saleswoman that I wasn't sure whether or not your ears were pierced, she gave me these clip-ons. And she said that some people don't like them because they hurt.",
        "Britney: People don't like them because they're lame. Clip-ons? Do I look like your grandmother? Are you for real?",
        "Starr: Henry, they're really pretty. Britney doesn't deserve them.",
        "Cole: Yeah, come on, we'll take them back to the jewelry store. You -- you kept the receipt, right?",
        "Langston: What is up with you, Henry? Why do you bother? She's worthless.",
        "Henry: I thought she was special.",
        "Starr: No, she's a bitch, ok? You don't deserve to be treated like that. Nobody does.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I don't get why you deal with it.",
        "Henry: Me, neither.",
        "Starr: Ok, Henry, let's just forget about her, ok? You don't need her.",
        "Henry: You guys don't. You have each other.",
        "Starr: Henry, Britney is wrong about you, ok? We like you.",
        "Henry: You really don't have to say that.",
        "Langston: It's true, Henry.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it's Britney that nobody likes. Don't you get that?",
        "Henry: Huh. It's always the same. People not liking me, and never saying why. After a while, you get used to it.",
        "Cole: Henry, come on, man. You can't let her get to you like this. All right, she's one girl that has a bunch of other dumb girls who follow her because of her clothes, period.",
        "Henry: You know, these really are ugly. Hmm. Maybe I wanted her to not like them.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Henry: Maybe I wanted her to see what a big loser I am so that when all this goes to crap, we'll all remember it.",
