        "T\u00e9a: You have my test results?",
        "Greg: Your doctor. I just wanted to make sure that you had the best care possible.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that why she ordered every test in the book? I mean, jeez, Greg, I had a CAT scan, an MRI, at least 20 different blood tests.",
        "Greg: I just wanted to be sure.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of what? I--ha ha--I'm fine.",
        "Greg: I'm glad.",
        "T\u00e9a: But...is there something wrong?",
        "Greg: I'm afraid so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: You have a good arm. You ever think about trying out for the show? Hey, Dani, are you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Is Kelly in?",
        "Dorian: And you are?",
        "Man: You must be Kelly's Aunt Dorian. Reed Wagner.",
        "Dorian: Uh, Kelly, has never mentioned you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: What's your problem now?",
        "Blair: Why are you even here, Kelly?",
        "Kelly: I heard Todd nearly died. I thought I'd show up. Look, I'm sorry. I don't believe that he pushed Marty and killed her baby.",
        "Blair: Oh, but you'd defend him anyway, wouldn't you?",
        "Kelly: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Blair: Well, because decent people don't go around killing other people's babies, do they? But you don't want to go there, do you?",
        "Kelly: Oh, God. Is that what this is about?",
        "Blair: Yeah, that's what this is about. After hearing about Marty losing her baby, you have any idea what yesterday was? Brendan's birthday. The day that my baby died.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, seeing you makes me remember it all over again, Kelly. My baby died because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Well, it looks like a quiet night. I told booking not to put anyone else in this cell.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "John: Elijah Clarke's gonna get you out of here as soon as he can.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "John: You okay?",
        "Cole: Yeah. I'd spend my whole life here if it meant that Todd Manning couldn't hurt my mom again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Medical equipment beeping]",
        "Todd: What do you want?",
        "Marty: Drop the charges against Cole.",
        "Todd: Are you kidding?",
        "Marty: Last time I saw you in that bed, John put you there 'cause you kept me locked up in your own sick fantasy and took away everything I was: My pride, my dignity. But I clawed my way back from that, and I found happiness. But this time you took away my baby, and as hard as I fight, I will never get my child back.",
        "Todd: You want to know what else, Marty? I didn't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Hey! What are you doing?",
        "Starr: Did you lie when you said you saw my dad push Marty down those stairs?",
        "Hannah: No. How can you even say that?",
        "Starr: You want Cole all to yourself and you'll do anything to get him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reed: Flattering as it would have been, I don't expect Kelly would have mentioned me. Is she here?",
        "Dorian: This is not a good time.",
        "Reed: Is that because of the hour or do you mean her mother?",
        "Dorian: What about Melinda?",
        "Reed: I heard she passed away.",
        "Dorian: She died, and we don't know the circumstances.",
        "Reed: That's why I'm here, because of Kelly's mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I don't even know how to say I'm sorry anymore. I have tried a million times, a million ways. If I could bring back Brendan, I would.",
        "Blair: But you can't because you were reckless and you ran us off the road.",
        "Kelly: I know. So what, you're never gonna get over what I did?",
        "Blair: You never get over losing a child, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: No. I still think about the son I lost every day.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Just think about somebody causing that to happen.",
        "Kelly: Must be nice being able to blame someone. See, all I can do is look in the mirror. I lost my son all by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Cole and I are friends, but apparently he can't have female friends.",
        "Starr: Cole and Langston are friends, and that's not a problem.",
        "Hannah: But I am.",
        "Starr: I think that you're lying. You're using my dad to try to break up Cole and me.",
        "Hannah: Starr, I can't even imagine what it would be like to have a father like yours. But you have to realize, this is not the first time he's done something like this. I mean, he threw you down the stairs.",
        "Starr: That was not on purpose.",
        "Hannah: And he's done terrible things to Dr. Saybrooke for half of her life.",
        "Starr: Okay, if you saw this horrible thing, why didn't you say something as soon as it happened?",
        "Hannah: I was scared. Your dad saw me, and I had just seen him throw a pregnant woman down the stairs. I mean, what was he gonna do to me? You know, it wasn't easy to step up.",
        "Starr: You didn't step up! You ran right to Cole. You didn't even go to the police.",
        "Hannah: I did that as a favor to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I thought I would have killed him.",
        "John: I know. I've been there. Came close to killing Manning a couple times myself.",
        "Cole: Well, don't you wish you had?",
        "John: When I saw your mom at the bottom of those stairs, yeah, I did. But I wouldn't wish that on you.",
        "Cole: I would have--argh!",
        "John: I know you would. I know you would have. That's what scares me, that you came this close. Cole, that's what the law is for. That's why I became a cop. You shouldn't have to give up your life to deal with the likes of Manning.",
        "Cole: I know, but--",
        "John: Your life would have been over. If you'd have killed him, your life would have been over. Do you understand that?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I guess I do. I would have killed any chance that Starr and I had left to be together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hannah saw you push me.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Marty: Not 5 minutes after you told me that you wanted Cole and my baby and me to disappear. You did it, Todd. But you're only gonna get one of your wishes, because Cole and I aren't going anywhere, and this time, you're not gonna walk. You're finally going to prison for everything you've done, and this time, you're gonna lose everything and everyone.",

        "Dani: Oh, my God, I'm out of control!",
        "Nate: It's okay.",
        "Dani: No, no, seriously, I can't believe I just did that.",
        "Nate: It's not a problem.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but that was just-- oh, my God.",
        "Nate: Hey, don't worry about it. You just tell me.",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Nate: Something's going on, right?",
        "Dani: No. I mean, yeah, but it's just my father. What else is new?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, apart from my daughter, I don't have anymore headaches, and--I mean, though she would agree that I need to have my head examined, I am fine, Greg, really.",
        "Greg: Well, you had blurry vision.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, because I need glasses. I have that thing now where I have to hold the page about 3 feet away from me...",
        "Greg: That's not going to help.",
        "T\u00e9a: I use those cheaters that I got at the bookstore to read.",
        "Greg: That won't solve the problem.",
        "T\u00e9a: I will go to the optometrist, I promise you, Greg, okay?",
        "Greg: Have you had anymore fainting spells?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. Listen, I get a little woozy when I don't eat, but that is totally normal.",
        "Greg: Okay, well, what about numbness down one side of your body?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, well, sure, if I sit at my desk too long. Look, Greg, I promise you, I will take really good care of myself, okay?",
        "Greg: You can't outrun this, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: This? What exactly do those tests say?",
        "Greg: You have glioblastoma.",
        "T\u00e9a: Which in English means?",
        "Greg: A brain tumor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Is Starr still here? I don't think she should stick around.",
        "John: Things looked pretty tense upstairs.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, she saw me go after her dad.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Cole: She still loves the guy.",
        "John: That's hard to watch, too, sometimes.",
        "Cole: She'll have to give that up now.",
        "John: She stuck by him through everything he's done to you two.",
        "Cole: He killed a baby. And there's proof. Hannah saw him push my mom, okay. I mean, that has to mean something, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You went running to Cole as a favor to me?",
        "Hannah: Starr, I knew what this would do to you. I figured it would be better if you heard it from Cole.",
        "Starr: Oh, how thoughtful of you.",
        "Hannah: And if he told me not to go to the police, I wouldn't have.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? You tell him that my dad assaulted his mom, which is the reason why her baby died, and you think he's going to tell you to shut up about it?",
        "Hannah: I don't know! I don't know why your father hasn't been in jail for years after everything he's done! I mean, you just keep letting him off the hook. He tried to kidnap your child and you didn't even press charges!",
        "Starr: That is absolutely none of your business, Hannah!",
        "Hannah: Public record, Starr.",
        "Starr: Oh...",
        "Hannah: I mean, you let him off the hook after all of the hell he's put you and Cole through. You'd probably let him get away with murder for all I know.",
        "Starr: You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.",
        "Hannah: Or maybe this time... Cole wouldn't be able to get past it, and you'd have to choose: Blind loyalty to daddy or the guy you say you love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: A brain tumor? Uh, wh--look at me. I'm fine...",
        "Greg: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Greg.",
        "Greg: I'm sorry.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, this is a mistake.",
        "Greg: I wish it was.",
        "T\u00e9a: What, you think that kind of thing doesn't happen? Do you know how many malpractice suits I've won, Greg?",
        "Greg: It shows up on your cat scan and your MRI as clear as day. I'm sorry, T\u00e9a, but it's true. You have a brain tumor.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh...oh. Uh...okay. Okay. How's the tenth?",
        "Greg: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I have some things I need to do before the tenth, but I can clear my schedule. Here is your calendar. Let's schedule the surgery right now. I want this thing out of me ASAP.",
        "Greg: T\u00e9a, it doesn't work like that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why not?",
        "Greg: Look, a tumor this size, given its location, we can't just go in there and cut it out.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you can't leave it in there, can you, Greg?",
        "Greg: If we remove this tumor, it will kill you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, wait. Oh...okay, so you're saying that I--I have a brain tumor. It's a big brain tumor, and it is inoperable?",
        "Greg: Yes.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ah...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I still think about my miscarriage. I relive everything I did when I was pregnant, every choice, and I can't find the moment...the thing I did that must have hurt him. And that's when I think that maybe he had to die because of what I did to Brendan. I took your baby, so my baby was taken from me. Now, I don't know if it's enough, but my mother was just murdered, and I'm all alone. Is that payback enough?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hannah lied.",
        "Marty: Why would she lie?",
        "Todd: For Cole.",
        "Marty: You think Hannah lied for Cole? She has a big plot against you?",
        "Todd: I found that slut with Cole...half-naked in Starr and Cole's apartment. Cole wants me gone.",
        "Marty: So he had his own mother pushed down the stairs? Why am I here?",
        "Todd: Listen, listen.",
        "Marty: Will you drop the charges?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Marty: Then I'm out of here!",
        "Todd: Marty, I don't know why you were pushed or who pushed you, but I know that Cole took advantage and got Hannah to lie.",
        "Marty: So you were framed, that's your story?",
        "Todd: He wants me out of their lives, he told me.",
        "Marty: Who wouldn't?",
        "Todd: He couldn't kill me, so he got the slut to lie. Get rid of the competition. Because I'm the only man Starr loves more than him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I am now, of course, rather prominent in the public sector.",
        "Reed: I've heard of your work as mayor.",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "Reed: The new civic center project will be a model for cities all over America.",
        "Dorian: Kevin told you all about that?",
        "Reed: No. David Vickers did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: This isn't about payback, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Then what?",
        "Blair: It's seeing you.",
        "Kelly: Well, you want me to disappear?",
        "Blair: You know, what are you doing here in Llanview anyway, huh? You come strolling into town during probably the toughest time my family's had in years!",
        "Kelly: Okay, well, Dorian insisted I stay.",
        "Blair: No, she didn't. She invited you to a damn party. You could have gone home. But no. You had to stick around here, take a job with Todd so you could stick it to me!",
        "Kelly: Please, is that what you think? All right, you know what? Fine. That's what I wanted you to think.",
        "Blair: What, so that's not true?",
        "Kelly: I was so desperate, I would have taken a job with anyone, even Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: My son is not competing with you. He's not jealous of you. He did not convince Hannah to lie. That is paranoid and delusional.",
        "Todd: So nobody's out to get me, huh? Look what your son did to me, Marty. Almost killed me.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Sorry for that.",
        "Todd: I don't accept your apology.",
        "Marty: And I am not apologizing to you. I am sorry for the fact that my son put himself in this position, but I certainly understand why he wanted you dead! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I wish John had just let you drown when you jumped off the palace roof. We could have been free of you, but you will not let us be in peace, and I cannot give you what you want from me.",
        "Todd: What's that?",
        "Marty: Redemption, redemption, redemption. You can't live without it, and you can't get it from someone else. Not T\u00e9a, not Blair...no one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Look, radiation treatments could possibly shrink it. We can look at chemotherapy. There are even clinical trials with new drugs that have had some success.",
        "T\u00e9a: But now, now you're talking. We can shrink this down, and then you can cut it out of me.",
        "Greg: T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes?",
        "Greg: You have a stage 4 brain tumor, and it's growing fast.",
        "T\u00e9a: So then we will start treatment tomorrow. Okay. Okay, Greg, we'll start treatment today, whenever you want.",
        "Greg: We can start treatment whenever you're ready. We can try and reduce the size of it. We can even slow down its progress, but it will come back.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't know that.",
        "Greg: We'll do everything we can to keep you comfortable and pain free...",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you saying that I'm probably gonna die?",
        "Greg: Yes.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Today, before the thing, I invited my dad into rehearsal.",
        "Nate: Yeah. That was big.",
        "Dani: He was--he was human...or human like. It felt so good not to be pissed off even for a little while. And then...",
        "Nate: The thing.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but even at the hospital, I mean, okay, I wasn't all, \"I love you, daddy,\" but I saw him. I could see Todd for, like, the first time. And I saw me and myself in him... or him in me.",
        "Nate: Yeah. You're prettier, but the dude is definitely your dad.",
        "Dani: Yeah, the guy who pushed a pregnant woman down the stairs. That's in me.",
        "Nate: Don't do that, okay? You might have his cheekbones or his eyes, but that doesn't make you a psycho or a monster.",
        "Dani: But that's what he is, isn't he?",
        "Nate: I don't know.",
        "Dani: But all these good people tell me that there's good in him. I thought I could be his daughter, but I'm all confused again. How stupid was I? Now I don't know.",
        "Nate: It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: There's no way Todd can wiggle out of this, is there? I mean, can Nora charge him with killing your baby?",
        "John: We'd have to prove that he knew that your mom was pregnant and that there was intention to hurt or kill the baby, but with everything he said to your mom before...I think Nora can push for it, yeah.",
        "Cole: Good. He needs to pay for this. And that's not even enough.",
        "John: No, it's not.",
        "Cole: Hey, I'm sorry about the baby.",
        "John: Forget about it. Hey, you know, when your mom, when she told me she was pregnant, I was scared. I didn't think I was gonna be much of a father.",
        "Cole: You kidding?",
        "John: It's a lot, you know?",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, you learn as you go, trust me.",
        "John: Yeah, yeah, I got that, you know. Um, I started to understand, you know, just take it one thing at a time. And when I did that, I almost started seeing it. You know, I imagined taking the little guy to a ball game like my dad used to take me. And I--and I thought, you know, I could do that. And if it was a little girl, I imagined that she would be smart and beautiful like your mom.",
        "Cole: I'm sorry.",
        "John: Don't. You got your child back.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's a miracle.",
        "John: Take it. They're hard to come by.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I know that you need to believe I'm lying, because that's a lot easier than what happens now.",
        "Starr: And what's that?",
        "Hannah: Your dad attacked Cole's mom and killed her baby. How do you even look him in the eye after that? Especially when you've been defending your father the whole time?",
        "Starr: It would be pretty hard for us to stay together, wouldn't it?",
        "Hannah: I didn't say that.",
        "Starr: But you thought it, and you wished it. Now I know that you're lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You're a rapist, and you always will be.",
        "Todd: Get out.",
        "Marty: When John found me, he took your fantasy away from you. But he gave me my life and a baby and a family. We had everything you wanted, and you couldn't stand it, so you pushed me down the stairs!",
        "Todd: No way. Did you see me push you down the stairs? No, you didn't. All you have are the lies of some half-baked tramp Cole's fooling around with. I'm sorry, Marty. Huh. I didn't do it this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Because of your lie, that's why Cole attacked my dad. He is in jail now, and if you keep this up in court, my dad's going to be in jail next. You have to stop lying, Hannah. It's not too late, okay? You can talk to John. You can take back your statement, okay? You won't even get in trouble for it.",
        "Hannah: I can't!",
        "Starr: This is going to backfire, Hannah. My dad will be free. You will be the one in the cell, and Cole and I will still be together. You'll never break us up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, it looks like you've got the place to yourself.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "John: You need anything?",
        "Cole: No. I'm good. But, um, can you check on Starr? I know she's probably furious at me, and that's okay, but...just let me know if she's all right.",
        "John: I will. I'll see you in the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I've been hiding in London. Ever since Zane went off to boarding school, I couldn't hide anymore. I had felt worthless, and I don't know. I mean, I've been raising Zane, and that's all I've done for so long. I've papered over everything. And then Mom was murdered.",
        "Blair: Oh, that's when you glommed onto John.",
        "Kelly: You know what? I didn't do that to upset you either.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
