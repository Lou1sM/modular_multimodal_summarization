        "Jessica's voice: I love you, Nash. I'll come to you at Rodi's, then we'll go home together.",
        "Jessica: Nash.",
        "Antonio: I'll call you as soon as I know something. Tell Jamie I love her and I'll be home as soon as I can. Ok. I will.",
        "Viki: I can't stand this.",
        "Antonio: Neither can I. If they at least knew what was causing this --",
        "Viki: Look, on the upside, she's young and strong, so whatever it is, she's going to beat it.",
        "Antonio: Right.",
        "Viki: I fully expected to find Nash hovering around here. I wonder why he isn't.",
        "Antonio: I don't know, and I don't care.",

        "Bo: Take a number, Brennan.",
        "Nash: \"Take a number\"? I'm the only one.",
        "Bo: Look, I've got cases to go over, haven't even had my coffee yet. I don't entertain civilians until after 8:00 -- that's for their safety.",
        "Nash: I'll take my chances.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nash: I want to press charges against Antonio.",
        "Bo: What are you talking about?",
        "Nash: Throwing the book at him.",
        "Bo: Oh, God.",

        "Starr: Langston, could you please stop yawning? It's driving me crazy.",
        "Langston: I was up all night writing a lead role for you.",
        "Starr: Hmm, right. With how mad Mrs. McBain is at me, I'm lucky if I get the role of sorority girl number two.",
        "Langston: Maybe you haven't noticed, but this school happens to be knee-deep in naturals for the bitch roles.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: What's up with this?",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: Look. This is Henry's locker.",
        "Starr: Whoever did this is so evil. Langston, we should take it down or do something.",
        "Langston: Too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So you don't have any more leads on Todd?",
        "Det. Morris: Ms. Cramer, I told you to go back to your hotel.",
        "Blair: You know what? The last trace that I saw of my children's father was a pool of blood at a crack den. Excuse me if I don't feel like taking a nap!",
        "Dorian: Trust me, Detective. When my niece gets into a mood like this, there's no talking her out of it. So, why don't you just give us a job to do?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Det. Morris: How about staying out of my way and let me do my job? When there's something to tell you, I will tell you.",
        "Blair: Fine! You know what? I'll find Todd myself! Hear me?",
        "Dorian: Blair --",

        "Dorian: I'm here for you, honey. It's just we're not going to go chasing --",
        "Blair: John, thank God. Are you here to help me find Todd?",
        "John: Assuming he wants to be found.",

        "Tate: Now, she is smart and -- and funny. She's inspired me to be all I can be.",

        "Tate: Adriana Cramer is the most incredible woman the Tate has ever known!",
        "[Cheers]",
        "Tate: Whoo! Whoo! She's perfect!",
        "Rex: That shot cracks me up. Look at joy -- it's like she can't believe it.",
        "Adriana: Sorry. You upset?",
        "Rex: No. You want to watch the guy making an ass out of himself on national TV? Knock yourself out.",
        "Adriana: Ok, you're starting to freak me out.",
        "Rex: Why? I thought you wanted me to blow it off.",
        "Adriana: I do. Uh --",
        "Rex: Hey, Tate went on \"The View\" and told the world he was in love with you. So what? It's not like you're going to fall for a guy who calls himself \"The Tate.\" Right, Tater-tot?",

        "Marcie: Oh, my God.",
        "Michael: Good morning.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no, it's not a good morning. I -- school's already started, Michael, I got to get up.",
        "Marcie: No, it's not ok, ok, because I -- I was up until 4:00 A.M. I was up until 4:00 A.M. grading papers, school's already started. I -- I have to feed Tommy, I overslept.",
        "Michael: I got it covered, sweetie.",
        "Marcie: How?",
        "Michael: Well, before I fed Tommy and took him to daycare, I called you in sick.",
        "Marcie: I have to go to work, Michael. I have to post the cast list. There are things --",
        "Michael: I know that. I told them that you'd be in later when you felt better.",
        "Marcie: Why? Why did you do that for?",
        "Michael: Because I wanted you all to myself today.",
        "Marcie: Is that champagne?",
        "Michael: It is.",
        "Marcie: Who are you, and what have you done with my husband?",
        "Michael: Happy first anniversary, Mrs. McBain.",

        "Starr: Henry, are -- are you ok?",
        "Henry: I'm fine.",
        "Langston: Whoever did this deserves to have their butt kicked.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Henry: It's not a big deal.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? Britney's such a bitch.",
        "Henry: Britney wouldn't do something like this.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? You're still standing up for her?",
        "Henry: It wasn't her. Every jock in this school hates me.",
        "Cole: What's going on?",
        "Langston: Somebody put this stuff on Henry's locker.",
        "Henry: Huh -- like you care? Like we're friends? Just leave me alone.",
        "Starr: Sure.",
        "Langston: Henry may be book smart, but he's totally life dumb.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: How could he be so hung up on someone who treats him like garbage?",
        "Cole: Happens all the time. You disagree?",
        "Starr: Excuse me -- I have to make a phone call.",
        "Langston: If that was you being Romeo, you suck at it.",
        "Amber: Hey, Henry?",
        "Henry: Where's Britney? I thought you guys traveled in pairs \u0096",
        "Amber: Um -- she's around. She told me to come talk to you.",
        "Starr: Britney, why did you shut the door?",
        "Britney: This room's going to be empty all day. Mrs. McBain is sick and they haven't found a substitute yet, so that'll give us time to have ourselves a nice, little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: How is she?",
        "Natalie: She's restless but she's still sleeping. Where is her doctor? Can't they do something for her?",
        "Viki: No, honey. Apparently, they can only treat her symptomatically until they get the blood work back. At least she doesn't seem to be getting any worse. Ok?",
        "Antonio: Well --",
        "Viki: Look, I -- I really think we have to let Nash know what's going on.",
        "Antonio: He knows.",
        "Viki: How does he know?",
        "Antonio: He was here last night. I kicked him o",
        "Viki: Are you sure you should've done that?",
        "Natalie: Mom?",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Natalie: Why are you being so fair with that jerk? I don't want Nash anywhere near my sister. But we said -- he is the reason she's in here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What has Antonio ever done to you? Now, as far as I know, he invested in your winery, he gave you a job.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- yeah. Jessica's sick and he won't let me see her.",
        "Bo: Well, that's because maybe he's worried about her.",
        "Nash: So am I. Look, he kicked me out of the hospital last night, and then when I called for information, they said that they could only release information to immediate family members.",
        "Bo: There's nothing illegal about what Antonio did.",
        "Nash: Come on.",
        "Bo: He's Jessica's husband.",
        "Nash: This isn't right and you know it.",
        "Bo: You know what? I think that what you believe is right, what I believe is right and wrong -- I think they're two different things. Now, if I hear from Antonio or hospital security that you're causing any trouble, you're going to wish you hadn't.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I get it -- you're lining up with your buddy Antonio.",
        "Bo: Jessica is his wife. She's my niece.",
        "Nash: And she's the mother of my child. She means everything to me. Now, the only way to keep me away from her is to lock me up.",
        "Bo: If Jessica means everything to you, I think you've got a real problem.",
        "Nash: Look, Jessica is my daughter's mother -- Bree. Antonio doesn't give a damn about Bree. My daughter keeps crying out, asking me where her mom is, and I don't know where to begin explaining to her because I don't know. How would you feel if you were me?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Come in.",
        "Talia: I'm sorry to interrupt, Commissioner, but I have something you need to see.",
        "Bo: All right, thank you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Bo: I understand what you're saying. But there's nothing that I can do about it, so I suggest you get a lawyer.",
        "Nash: Oh. Come on -- how long would that take?",
        "Bo: Then I suggest you settle this with Antonio, man to man. But don't do anything that'll make it harder on Jessica.",
        "Nash: Just do me a favor and say the same thing to Antonio, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I know what I said, darling, but I don't think that Nash is the only reason that she's sick.",
        "Antonio: Jess has been under stress for weeks because of him. I mean, she hasn't slept, he pressured her into not adopting Jamie.",
        "Natalie: He did that?",
        "Antonio: I'm sure of it.",
        "Viki: But he also is the father of her child, and we can't just keep him in the dark.",
        "Antonio: Well, it's one thing keeping him in the dark. It's another thing to keep him away from here so he doesn't make a scene.",
        "Viki: Antonio, he's not going to come here and plead his case with Jessica now.",
        "Antonio: Well, look, I -- I don't care what he does. Jess can't speak for herself, and legally I'm the next of kin, so as long as she is the way she is, I could keep him barred from this room.",
        "Viki: But is that what Jessie wants?",
        "Antonio: Everything that's happened to Jessica -- the adoption hearing, her running away -- is because of Nash, all of it, because he's in love with her. And now it might kill her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You think this is another one of Todd's schemes, John?",
        "John: Well, considering who we're talking about, you don't think it's possible?",
        "Blair: Look, I -- I helped you with Spencer. Are you here to help me with Todd, or what?",
        "John: That's why I flew all the way out here.",
        "Dorian: And we want to thank you for that, detective.",
        "John: You're welcome.",
        "Blair: Yeah, thank you. What's your plan?",
        "John: The first thing I'd like to do is see the detective in charge of the case.",
        "Blair: He's right over there, Mr. Personality himself.",
        "Dorian: He's not on Blair's top 10 list, she's not on his.",
        "John: So, why don't I do the talking? What's the Detective's name?",
        "Blair: More ass.",
        "Dorian: Stop it!",
        "Blair: Morris.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Blair: So what?",
        "Dorian: Knock it off.",
        "John: Detective Morris?",
        "Det. Morris: Who are you?",
        "John: I'm John McBain with the Llanview Police Department.",
        "Det. Morris: Well, you have no jurisdiction here.",
        "John: I'm not here to cause any trouble. If anything, I'm here to clear a few things up. I'm assuming you have background on Todd Manning?",
        "Det. Morris: I have.",
        "John: Then you also know he's a possible suspect in the murder of Spencer Truman, and the authorities in Pennsylvania have a vested interest in finding him.",
        "Det. Morris: Do you anything about Manning's claim that his son was kidnapped?",
        "John: I know some.",
        "Det. Morris: It's a mess.",
        "John: And that mess is about to cross state lines, and the feds are going to be all over this office, so I thought I'd come down here, maybe I could help and we could avoid that from happening.",
        "Det. Morris: Ok, that's a good point.",
        "John: So where do we stand, Detective?",
        "Det. Morris: Well, apparently Manning was told where to find his son, but turned out to be a crack den. We found his blood there, family photograph -- nothing else.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, wait a minute. What about the woman from the adoption agency? She's the one that sent him there.",
        "John: Excuse me. By any chance did you happen to talk to this lady, Detective?",
        "Det. Morris: Yes, but she denies meeting Manning outside the station.",
        "Blair: Well, then she's lying! I saw her myself! She came --",
        "John: Excuse me.",
        "Blair: She came to the hotel, John. She gave Todd a picture of his son, and you know it.",
        "John: With all due respect, Detective, you think maybe I could take a crack at her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Mmm. Did you make these chocolate-covered strawberries?",
        "Michael: No. But -- but I did pay for them, and the scones and the fancy and this.",
        "Marcie: Michael, we're supposed to be saving money.",
        "Michael: Shh. It's our first wedding anniversary. It's never going to happen again, and besides, it's from both me and Tommy. It's kind of an early mother's day gift. You know Tommy can't keep a secret, so he asked me to give it to you early.",
        "Marcie: Mother's day? That sounds so good. Huh.",
        "Michael: You going to open it?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. [Marcie gasps] Oh, my -- Michael, that is beautiful.",
        "Michael: Yeah, it is -- just like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: All right, so tell me -- what am I doing that's so wrong?",
        "Langston: You act like Starr wants things the way they are.",
        "Cole: Well, yesterday we were talking, today she won't even look at me.",
        "Langston: Maybe she's just trying to get over you because she knows there's no hope.",
        "Cole: Whew. I just miss her so much, and I can't get to her. I mean, you're her best friend, right? Don't you want her to be happy?",
        "Langston: You know I do.",
        "Cole: And is she?",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Cole: Ok, then you have to help me.",
        "Langston: Huh. That whole mess with auditions -- that was me helping, and look what happened.",
        "Cole: Yeah?",
        "Langston: Yeah. And somewhere in there, you know that, bonehead.",
        "Cole: Ahem. Ok. So then, what should I do?",
        "Langston: Well, she's stubborn. Maybe you should just try laying off.",
        "Cole: Why does her dad have to be Todd Manning? I mean, how worse can it get?",
        "Langston: Huh. Well, you could be hung up on Britney.",
        "Henry: Britney wanted you to talk to me? Ok. About what?",
        "Amber: Oh -- I think that's kind of obvious.",
        "Henry: You mean she's furious about this, too?",
        "Amber: Oh, no, she totally doesn't care about that.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Amber: She wanted me to ask you for something.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Amber: She gave you her last school picture, when you were writing her history paper for her.",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Amber: Yeah, she really needs that back. She wants to give it to Garrett.",
        "Henry: Oh. Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Britney, I don't want to talk to you, ok? I have to make a phone call.",
        "Britney: Do it later.",
        "Starr: I have nothing to talk to you about. Me and Cole are done and you're with that kid Garrett.",
        "Britney: No, we're hooking up, but it's not a big deal.",
        "Starr: Ok -- ew, please. Spare me the details of your sex life.",
        "Britney: But that's what friends do, Starr -- they share all of their dirty little secrets.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry -- ew, don't touch me, and did you just call us \"friends\"",
        "Britney: That's what I'm here about -- how about a truce?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ahem -- did you know this rag is calling you \"Tatiana\"?",
        "Adriana: What?",
        "Rex: The two of you -- just listen. \"Sources rate Tatiana's\" -- hmm, that's you -- \"shelf life slightly better than a glass of warm milk. Vegas oddmakers are taking bets as to what will come between them.\" Wonder if those same oddmakers are making book on Rexiana. I could clean up.",
        "Adriana: Rex, shut up and go put some clothes on.",
        "Rex: Have you guys thought of an exit strategy for this stunt relationship?",
        "Tate: Well, I guess we were hoping it would die down.",
        "Rex: Well, I guess that's one way to go.",
        "Adriana: What do you think, Rex?",
        "Rex: Well, that the longer you two do nothing to deny it, the longer the gossip columns will have to look into it. They might find something you don't want them to find out.",
        "Tate: Hmm, like what?",
        "Rex: Well, Adriana's father is connected, for one thing.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Rex: You want to see a headline that reads \"underworld underwear\"? Then there's you.",
        "Tate: What about me?",
        "Rex: Come on, dude -- everybody's got secrets. I can think of one a real lady's man like you would really like to keep under wraps.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: He's got a real flair for language.",
        "Talia: Your statement to the press worked -- you got your response from \"one pure people.\"",
        "Bo: What did forensics say about the original?",
        "Talia: Their initial run didn't yield any prints.",
        "Bo: All right, I want to know everything about this. I want to know what kind of paper the original was written on, everything that will help us learn about the guy that wrote this letter.",
        "Talia: Right.",
        "Bo: Now, you know the drill.",
        "Talia: I'll get a copy to a profiler and I'll have him look at it.",
        "Bo: Ok. Yeah, I'm going to call Antonio.",
        "Talia: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So you really think that this is solely Nash's fault?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, definitely. I just wish Jess would've made it clear with him that he is just her friend.",
        "Antonio: She tried, but she can't keep him out of Bree's life.",
        "Natalie: So now, he thinks he's got a shot?",
        "Antonio: Look, I'm not keeping Nash away because I'm threatened by him. I'm keeping him away because I want Jess to concentrate on getting well.",
        "Viki: All right. I'm going to see how she is.",
        "Natalie: You know, I'm going to go get some coffee. Do you want to come?",

        "Antonio: Oh, well, they haven't got a diagnosis yet, but they tell me she's stable.",
        "Bo: All right. Give her a kiss for me, will you?",
        "Antonio: I'll do that.",
        "Bo: We just had some correspondence from one of the \"one pure people.\"",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah? Did they have a change of heart and realize how wrong they were?",
        "Bo: No, not exactly. Listen, I'd like to read some of this to you if you have the time. I want your input.",
        "Antonio: Sure.",
        "Nash: Oh, hi.",
        "Viki: No, Nash. Turn around, walk away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I can't believe this. You know, I totally thought you were going to forget what today was. You've just been so preoccupied lately.",
        "Michael: I have been, and I'm sorry. You deserve a lot better.",
        "Marcie: Don't say that.",
        "Michael: Listen, I know that I'm not the writer of the duo, but I -- I gave it my best shot. Um -- please don't laugh at me.",
        "Michael: \"There are two periods in my life -- before you and after you. And before you, I was a doctor and that's about it. Then, you know, I was a mechanic who fixed people but couldn't fix his own life. Then you came into my life, and I found what I'd been needing all along. You're not only the fun in my life and you can say 'hello' and make an instant connection with someone. I learned from being with you. And now, I'm a doctor and a brother and a son and a friend and a husband and a father and a man who is completely and totally in love with you.\"",

        "Adriana: Oh, come on, Rex, nobody's going to think that.",
        "Rex: That's what Nora Hanen said, too. That would be our town's DA. She married a guy she didn't know everything about. He turned out to be a closeted gay man who killed anyone who found out his little secret. Good people died. People I loved. The DA suffered a stroke from all the stress she was under.
