        "Father Gregory: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man, Michael Thomas Mc Bain, and this woman, Marcie Marie Walsh, in holy matrimony. Marriage is commended to be honorable among all men. And therefore, is not by any to be entered into lightly.",
        "Natalie: This is David Vickers. He shot John's father.",
        "Father Gregory: But reverently, discreetly, advisedly, and solemnly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You had a baby and you don't even remember him?",
        "Margaret: Don't say that.",
        "David: I'm getting to you, though, aren't I? You're starting to remember.",
        "Margaret: No.",
        "David: Yeah, I can almost see it in that formerly crazy face of yours.",
        "Margaret: Look, I had a dream about a baby once. That's what you see.",
        "David: I can tell you about that dream. You were in a warehouse. There were two doctors, a man and a woman. They helped deliver your baby boy. You had a son, right?",
        "Margaret: The baby in the dream was a boy.",
        "David: That's right. That's what I'm trying to tell you. It wasn't a dream. You had a baby boy, Margaret.",
        "Margaret: Who was the father again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Wow. She didn't cry when they took her blood sample. She's a toughie, just like her mommy.",
        "Antonio: Yes. Yes, Jessica's always taken those things in stride.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, you know what? Hopefully, we'll have this blood sample test result back soon and we'll know the truth. You and I can stop this dancing.",
        "Antonio: Yes. Yes, it'll be a relief to finally know who the baby's father is. And who the baby's mother is.",
        "Tess: I don't need a test. She's mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: We've got to get back across the street to the church. We're missing the wedding.",
        "Kevin: That's how you react when I tell you our engagement's off?",
        "Kelly: You don't mean that.",
        "Kevin: You don't want to give up having a baby, and you don't want to use a sperm donor.",
        "Kelly: I want to have a child with my husband.",
        "Kevin: You're not listening to me! I can't give you that! We've been through this before when our real son died. I don't -- I won't do it again, ok? I know what's going to happen. Being married will just put us both through hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Father Gregory: Into this holy estate, these two persons present now come to be joined. If any person can show just cause why they should not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.",
        "Rex: What are you doing?",
        "Natalie: Uh --",
        "Marcie: Is there something you need to tell me?",
        "Michael: Natalie, is there some sort of a problem?",
        "Natalie: I am so embarrassed. I -- I'm sorry, I got a charley horse. I -- continue. I'm so sorry.",
        "Father Gregory: Anybody else?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Father Gregory: Marriage is the union of husband and wife in heart, body, and mind. It is intended --",
        "Roxy: Are you sleeping with Johnny's brother?",
        "Father Gregory: And for the health --",
        "Roxy: Come on, kiddo, you can tell me.",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Father Gregory: In adversity and prosperity.",
        "Rex: Hey, hey, hey, what are you going to do with that picture?",
        "Natalie: I have to do something.",
        "Father Gregory: Make a commitment together to embrace their dreams, realize their hopes --",
        "Natalie: I have to talk to you.",
        "Evangeline: Not now, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: It has to be now.",
        "Evangeline: You are ruining their wedding.",
        "Father Gregory: We are here today before God.",
        "Natalie: I'm talking life and death here.",
        "Father Gregory: This occasion marks the celebration of love and commitment, with which this man and this woman start their life together. Who gives this woman in marriage to this man?",
        "Mr. Walsh: Her mother and I do.",
        "Marcie: Thank you, Daddy. I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I want to get out of here.",
        "Nash: What about the baby?",
        "Tess: I'm taking her with me.",
        "Antonio: She's sleeping.",
        "Tess: She can sleep at home with Nash and me. Let's go get a nurse and check her out.",
        "Antonio: No, you're not taking the baby anywhere.",
        "Tess: Says who?",
        "Antonio: Says me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Margaret, you know who the they is. It's Todd Manning.",
        "Margaret: No, I've never heard of him.",
        "David: You were in love with him. You were obsessed with him.",
        "Margaret: No. No Todds. But when you were talking about the baby --",
        "David: What, you felt something?",
        "Margaret: I remember waking up from the dream that I had, and I -- and I realized that it wasn't real. And I had this awful tight feeling in my chest. And I'm having that right now.",
        "David: Margaret, that -- that's because you miss your son. Your son is out there somewhere. He needs you. Your son needs his mother.",
        "Margaret: But if I don't even remember having him, how am I going to know where he is?",
        "David: I'll help you. But you got to get me out of here first.",
        "Margaret: What, so you can take me on some wild-goose chase?",
        "David: No, that's -- that's not what this is. Look, you're not going to understand this, but you are my only hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: What is the matter with you?",
        "Natalie: Why do you have a copy of this picture?",
        "Evangeline: None of your business. Did Rex give this to you?",
        "Natalie: He didn't mean to, but are you investigating David Vickers?",
        "Evangeline: No.",
        "Natalie: Then why do you have a copy of his picture?",
        "Evangeline: You're not going to give this up, are you?",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Evangeline: I'm investigating Spencer Truman.",
        "Natalie: Why?",
        "Evangeline: Because I don't want your Uncle Todd to get a lethal injection.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Evangeline: I guess that isn't the answer you wanted.",
        "Natalie: Ok -- is the kid in this picture David Vickers?",
        "Evangeline: At Spencer and Paige's wedding -- that's what the caption says.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, ok, well, here. This is a sketch of a witness' description of the man who shot John and Michael's father.",
        "Evangeline: I can't believe that.",
        "Natalie: You see? They're one and the same. You see that, right? You see why I'm freaking out.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. Yeah, I do.",
        "Natalie: David Vickers shot Thomas Mc Bain. We have to tell John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: How can you say that after everything we've been through? We have fought so hard to find our way back to each other. Now you just want to walk away?",
        "Kevin: I don't see any other choice.",
        "Kelly: We have a few problems.",
        "Kevin: A few problems? Come on, Kelly. We solve one problem, another one takes its place. Everything we do to solve our problems just bring more trouble.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Kevin: I mean, how long is it going to be until you decide to solve our problems with a lie? I mean, who knows? Maybe you're already lying about Duke. Huh? I mean, that's the real problem here, isn't it? I can't trust you. And deep down, you don't trust me.",
        "Kelly: I think that we've learned from our mistakes. I think that until recently, we've been really good together.",
        "Kevin: Oh, yeah. You mean, until I found out that I had a low sperm count and my son was in love with you?",
        "Kelly: Duke doesn't know what he's doing.",
        "Kevin: Of course he does! He's not a child! Are you out of your mind? He knows exactly what he's doing! He's not hiding his feelings for you! And you know what? From what I can see, you just bring it on.",
        "Kelly: How can you say that? You don't really believe that?",
        "Kevin: Oh, I know that you love the attention.",
        "Kelly: Well, I haven't gotten much positive attention from you lately!",
        "Kevin: Well, let me tell you something, honey, it's not because I haven't been trying. And you know what? How long's it going to be till you use that as an excuse to sleep with someone else?",
        "Kelly: Kevin, I would never --",
        "Kevin: Would never what, huh? Lie? Cheat? How about take something that doesn't belong to you, Kel? You know what? You put off this image like you're so perfect, and everybody just buys it. It's -- it's unbelievable. I mean, \"Kelly -- she -- she only cares about other people. Kelly -- she's so sweet. Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. She's just a freaking saint, isn't she?\" Everybody thinks you'd be such a great mom, and it's such a tragedy that you can't have a child. You know what? You and I know different, don't we? We know that you were a mess with ace. You were a mess. Why can't we adopt, Kel? Why, huh? Oh, I kn. Because no judge in their right mind would ever give you a child. You know what? Maybe God is raining down on us today, huh? Maybe this is a big surprise from him. Maybe you should never have children, Kelly. You ever think about that? Maybe someone up there sees what everyone else ignores.",
        "Kelly: That's the cruelest thing you've ever said to me.",
        "Kevin: Oh, man, I just can't take this anymore. I can't take this anymore. You keep saying you want to have a child with me? Well, maybe fate has done me a favor, huh? Maybe you can find someone else to -- to experiment with. Huh? Maybe someone else is willing to roll the dice with an innocent life, but not me. Better yet, why don't you run out and find Duke? What the hell -- he's only my son. I'm sure he would love to give you what you want. Have a baby with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Father Gregory: This is a beginning and a continuation of Michael and Marcie's growth as individuals.",
        "Layla: Would you chill?",
        "Father Gregory: With mutual care, respect, and knowledge comes the affirmation of each one's own life happiness --",
        "Cristian: I'll be right back.",
        "Father Gregory: Growth, and freedom. With respect for individual --",
        "Adriana: Wonder what that was about.",
        "Father Gregory: Boundaries comes the freedom to love unconditionally. With care and responsibility towards self and one another comes the potential for full and happy lives. By gathering together all the wishes of happiness and our fondest hopes for Michael and Marcie from all present here, we are sure that our hearts are in tune with theirs. This relationship stands for love, loyalty, honesty, trust, and friendship. Before Marcie and Michael knew love, they knew friendship. And it was from this seed of friendship that came their destiny together.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Natalie: We have to tell John.",
        "Evangeline: And interrupt the wedding again?",
        "Natalie: No. But we need to do something, before David Vickers figures out that we're on to him. I mean, he's gotten away with murder for all of these years.",
        "Evangeline: No, there will be enough time to tell John after his brother gets married.",
        "Natalie: Do you have any idea what John's going to do when he finds out?",
        "Cristian: Finds out what? What's going on?",
        "Natalie: Nothing.",
        "Cristian: Natalie, I want to know what you two are up to.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, really, it's nothing.",
        "Natalie: Ok, you know what? He needs to know. I mean, he did the sketch. He should know. He's right.",
        "Evangeline: Don't you think it's John's call?",
        "Natalie: You know, whether he realizes it or not, John's going to need all the backup he can get. This is going to kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Father Gregory: Do not think you can direct the course of love.",
        "Michael: John --",
        "Father Gregory: For love --",
        "Michael: John --",
        "Father Gregory: If it finds you worthy, will direct you. Love will guide you. Love will show you the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I want my kid.",
        "Antonio: Jessica's baby.",
        "Tess: Huh, Jessica's baby -- yeah. Because I carried her. And I was the one that went through all the labor pains. So I'm pretty sure that she passed her over to me.",
        "Antonio: Jessica wants to be a mother to this child.",
        "Tess: Well, Antonio, you and Jessica haven't really been talking lately, now, have you? And she hasn't been able to face what happened with her and Norman Leeds, and she still can't.",
        "Antonio: Well --",
        "Tess: So I'm pretty sure that Jessie is gone for good.",
        "Antonio: Well, then it's obvious that you don't know Jessica as well as you think you do.",
        "Tess: The baby needs a mother. The baby needs to be nursed. And whether you like it or not, honey, I have the equipment.",
        "Antonio: You know, this isn't only your decision to make.",
        "Tess: She's mine.",
        "Antonio: If I'm that baby's father, then I have rights.",
        "Tess: Well, she's my daughter and I know what's best for her, and what's best for her is not standing here and arguing with you. I'm taking her home, with Nash, and nothing's going to stop me.",
        "Antonio: Watch me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margaret: Why are you in so much trouble?",
        "David: It -- it doesn't matter. What matters is that we can help each other. We can get our lives back. Trust me.",
        "Margaret: I don't even know you. How do I know if one word you say is true?",
        "David: You know it. You had a baby. Think! You know it. Look, I can -- I can help you find your baby. But you got to drop the charges first. You have to help me if you ever want to hold your son again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So you think David Vickers killed John's father? That's why you freaked out in there?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I -- I took the sketch that you drew and compared it to this picture of David when he was a kid.",
        "Cristian: And you want to tell John?",
        "Natalie: And Michael. I think they both have a right to know.",
        "Evangeline: Do I have to remind you two that Michael's wedding is in progress? This is supposed to be a happy day.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Evangeline: Look, they've waited 25 years. I think they can wait another 25 minutes. Right?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, she's right. Just let Michael have the wedding, before all hell breaks loose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What's wrong?",
        "Adriana: Nothing. Be quiet.",
        "Father Gregory: Marriage is an act of faith --",
        "Rex: Oh, I am going to kill this creep.",
        "Father Gregory: A moral commitment which requires and deserves daily attention. And now, Marcie and Michael will recite the vows they've each written.",
        "Michael: Um -- expressing feelings is not exactly a Mc Bain family stRong suit.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Michael: So much so that I actually forgot about the vows thing until just before the ceremony.",
        "Marcie: You're kidding, right?",
        "Michael: I really wish I was.",
        "Roxy: Uh-oh.",
        "Michael: When Father Gregory reminded me -- well, does the phrase \"runaway groom\" tell you anything about what was going through my head? Now, don't worry. It never would have worked. It's impossible to go on the lam when you got a cop for a brother.",
        "Matthew: Is it happening again?",
        "Bo: What's that, son?",
        "Matthew: Almost every wedding we go to, no one ever gets married.",
        "Michael: Marcie, I love and trust you so completely and totally that when you asked me all those questions about the wedding -- you know, fish or chicken, roses or daisies -- I just said yes to everything, because when it comes to showing me what's beautiful in life, what's worth living for, you're it. And no tornado warning or canceled flights or anything is going to stop me from marrying you today.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, that's a good thing.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Ron: Think he's going to make a run for it?",
        "Mr. Walsh: Shh.",
        "Michael: I didn't actually write anything out. Now, I tried. But it sounded silly. Or just -- not enough. I got some good advice from some good people. Father Gregory, my mom, this knucklehead over here. Father Gregory told me that I should relax. You know, as much as possible. \"Breathe. Look deep into Marcie's eyes and tell her what's in your heart.\" My mom told me that I shouldn't wait one more day to be happy.",
        "Marcie: She's a smart woman.",
        "Michael: My brother over here -- he told me all I needed to do was get up here, look you in the eye, and the words would just come. So here goes. Marcie, I love you. I am the luckiest man in the entire world, because I get to spend the rest of my life waking up next to you. Thank you for saying yes. Thank you for marrying me. I promise, honey, I am never going to let you regret it.",
        "Father Gregory: Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Um -- well, first of all, I think that I'm going to get you a checklist next time, you know. Check them off one by one. And -- well, you know me, right? I wrote down about a zillion things that I wanted to say to you. I don't know how many drafts that I wrote, really, but -- well, now that I'm standing here, and we are really, actually going to get married -",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: I can't remember a thing that I wanted to say to you. Um -- you know, all my life, I think I've made everything as hard and as complicated as I possibly could, you know, because I wanted to keep myself busy. Because I didn't want to be scared, which is actually what I think I was, you know? I have lost so many people that I loved -- so much -- that I made it impossible for that to ever happen again. But you know what? You didn't let me. You didn't. You reminded me of everything that I've been missing. And you didn't give up on me once. To tell you the truth, you wore me down! You know, and I -- and I didn't make it easy for you. I know that. I made it really, really hard for you to propose. Honestly, I have no idea how you actually got through with it. But you know that I'm glad you did. Because you know that I love you. You make me -- you make me feel safe a loved and at home. And I am not afraid anymore. Because, you know, I get to wake up next to you for the rest of my life. I love you.",
        "Father Gregory: Rings?",
        "John: Right.",
        "Michael: Ok, excuse me! Excuse me, everybody! Please, if you could give me your attention. We are much safer inside of the building. If everybody could just return to their seats, we're going to relight some candles and we're going to continue with the ceremony.",
        "Adriana: It's just the wind, Rex, ok?",
        "Rex: Yeah, well, I'm not so sure of that.",
        "Adriana: He sends creepy messages, he doesn't control the weather.",
        "Rex: I'm not leaving anything to chance.",
        "Marcie: I just finished saying I'm not going to be scared anymore, and then this happens, Michael.",
        "Michael: No, no --",
        "Marcie: Maybe we should rethink this.",
        "Michael: No, this is -- this is a good thing. This is a good thing, ok? Irish tradition says that when there's a storm during a wedding, you're guaranteed a long and happy marriage. Isn't that right, John?",
        "John: Absolutely.",
        "Marcie: Really?",
        "Michael: Yes. Come on.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Father Gregory: Ready to continue?",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Father Gregory: John, the rings?",
        "John: Oh, of course, father.",
        "Father Gregory: Ok. Michael.",
        "Michael: Marcie, I give you this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity. And with this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Father Gregory: Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Michael, I give you this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity. And with this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Michael: I, Michael Thomas Mc Bain, take you, Marcie Marie Walsh, to be my wife, now and forever.",
        "Marcie: I, Marcie Marie Walsh, take you, Michael Thomas Mc Bain, to be my husband, now and forever.",
        "Father Gregory: Inasmuch as Michael and Marcie have consented together in marriage before this company of family and friends, and have declared their unity by the giving and receiving of the rings, they are now joined. What, therefore, God has put together, let no man put asunder. And so, by the power vested in me by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and almighty God, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.",

        "Kevin: What's so horrible about it? Huh? You want to have a baby, Duke wants you. He's a young stud and he's ready and he's willing.",
        "Kelly: Oh, God! How dare you talk to me like that! How dare you talk about your own son like that!",

        "Tess: The odds are never in my favor, Nash.",
        "Nash: Tess, you didn't think that anyone would ever be able to fall in love with you. You were wrong about that. You didn't think that you'd be able to fall in love with this baby, but you did, anyway. You know what? Maybe your odds are changing. Maybe you're going to end up being a whole person with a real life. And maybe, just maybe, you're going to allow yourself to realize that.",
        "Tess: Well, I want that so much it scares me. But if I find out this baby isn't mine, I lose everything. It might as well have been like I never existed in the first place.",

        "Kelly: It really hurt him. He got really angry.",

        "Duke: Oh, Kelly, Kelly, I'm so sorry. But you know, it might be better that way.",
        "Kelly: No, it's not. I told him that I loved him, but he just kept saying crazy things.",
        "Duke: Like what?",
        "Kelly: I told him that I wanted to have a baby with him because I loved him.",
        "Duke: Kelly, what did he say to you?",
