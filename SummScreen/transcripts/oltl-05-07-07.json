        "Nash: All right, God, here I am. How do we do this, huh? Do I got a right to do this? Because I never asked you for anything, but I'm asking you for something now -- make Jessica well. Make her well. I'll cut you a deal.",
        "Natalie: So you got the results back from Jessica's test?",
        "Michael: Like I said, it wasn't what I wanted to see.",
        "Viki: What's wrong with her?",
        "Antonio: Is she going to be all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Miles. What are you doing here? Is something wrong?",
        "Miles: Um -- I know what happened to Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Ok, if you two want to head back to Llanview, go right ahead. I'm staying here in Chicago --",
        "John: Do you ever listen to anybody?",
        "Blair: I listen to things that are important, ok?",
        "John: Just -- what do you got there, Detective?",
        "Det. Morris: The trash from the building where Manning's blood was I.D.'d. Got it just before the truck came.",
        "John: Oh, yeah? Anything we can use?",
        "Det. Morris: Don't know. I'll get to it later.",
        "Blair: \"Later\"? No, no, no, let -- let me -- let me at it.",
        "Dorian: No! Blair, you're out of your mind.",
        "John: You got some gloves?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Heather: I can't believe it!",
        "Marcie: Heather? Honey, are you ok?",
        "Heather: I'm not sure.",
        "Marcie: You're not sure of what? You're not making any sense, honey.",
        "Heather: I think Henry just stole the student driver's car.",
        "Marcie: What? When?",
        "Heather: Just now.",
        "Marcie: Ok. Uh -- I'm going to go notify the principal, ok?",
        "Heather: But, Mrs. McBain, there's more.",
        "Marcie: What's that?",
        "Heather: Britney, Starr, and Cole got in the car, too, and Henry was driving, like, 90 Miles an hour.",
        "Marcie: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Dude, aren't you going a little fast?",
        "Henry: Shut up!",
        "Britney: Ok, you know what, Cole? Stop talking. This is a very difficult car to handle, and Henry's doing just great.",
        "Starr: Henry, we should really go back to school, ok? You're not supposed to be driving without an instructor.",
        "Henry: You're all such hypocrites. You keep telling me to not let Britney boss me around, but you boss me around just as much as she does. At least she cares about me.",
        "Starr: She only cares about you when there's a big test coming up.",
        "Britney: Oh, shut up. You're just jealous because he doesn't help you.",
        "Henry: You know, I'm smarter than all of you put together.",
        "Britney: That's right, Henry, you are, and these guys don't even respect you.",
        "Cole: Britney, you're such a bitch. Henry, don't listen to her.",
        "Henry: Don't talk to her like that.",
        "Britney: Henry, ignore them. Listen, listen, help me out, and I'll make sure everyone knows what a great guy you are.",
        "Starr: Are you --",
        "Britney: In fact, I could probably make you the most popular guy at school.",
        "Cole: How will you --",
        "Starr: Henry, look out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Jessica has Hepatitis C.",
        "Natalie: Hep C? Are you sure?",
        "Michael: It's a virus known as H.C.V. It attacks the liver. The majority of cases are chronic. The virus attacks the liver over a number of years.",
        "Antonio: Ok, Michael, what about Jessica's case?",
        "Michael: Oh, we're actually quite fortunate that Jessica collapsed. I mean, most people that are carriers of H.C.V. have it for up to 30 years without showing any symptoms while serious damage is being done.",
        "Natalie: How would Jessica even catch this?",
        "Michael: You don't catch it, per se -- not like you would a cold.",
        "Natalie: I know how you get it. It just doesn't make any sense.",
        "Michael: Viki, did Jessica have any blood transfusions prior to 1992?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Michael: And did she ever work in a hospital where she may have been exposed to needles containing the virus?",
        "Viki: I don't know. I mean, she was a candy striper when she was a teenager. My God.",
        "Michael: The most common mode of transmission for Hep C is the sharing of needles with someone who has it.",
        "Viki: Needles? You mean like -- like Heroin?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: These two mean the world to me. Huh? But, hey, if Antonio is right -- if Antonio is right and I stressed Jessica out so much that it made her sick, if it's my fault -- I want her to get well. So here's the deal. Make her well and I'll give her up for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: You know, I hate to eat and run but duty calls.",
        "Bo: I know. Looks like it's going to be another one of those late nights. Do you think that we will ever be able to spend time with one another other than over just a little snack like this?",
        "Paige: Mm-hmm. I think I'm definitely free three weeks from last January.",
        "Bo: Oh -- fine, fine. Now, you know what? I had in mind something just a little bit sooner, ok? Think about this -- you, me, the lake, next weekend.",
        "Paige: I would love that, but I'm not sure Nora's going to let Matthew go next weekend. It's mother's day.",
        "Bo: Oh, that's right, I forgot. Oh -- hey. You going to be all right with that?",
        "Paige: Yeah. I spent every other Mother's Day without Hugh.",
        "Bo: I know, I know, but this one --",
        "Paige: Yeah, it would have been our first one together.",
        "Bo: Look, I don't think you should be alone.",
        "Paige: No, I'm not going to be. I'm going to go to California. I'm going to see Hugh's grave. Samantha and Edward asked me to come and she and I are both his mother, so we're going to remember him together.",
        "Bo: I think that's a great idea. I think you should go.",
        "Paige: You know, every single mother's day I said a prayer for my son. I prayed that he was safe. I prayed that -- that I did the right thing, keeping him away from Spencer. And now Spencer's never going to hurt anyone ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Miles, if you feel guilty, you know, about the tip you gave Todd to find his son, don't -- unless there's something you're not telling us.",
        "Miles: No, no, I -- I just know that Spencer wanted Todd dead, and now Todd is missing.",
        "Marty: Well, I'm sure there is another, reasonable explanation, or at least I hope so.",
        "Miles: Why? Why do you care if Todd turns up dead?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: We were lucky Detective Morris let us do this.",
        "Dorian: \"Lucky\"?",
        "John: He didn't have to.",
        "Blair: Here, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no, thank you. I mean, but we are doing them a favor, actually, sparing them an intimate encounter with the refuse from a crack den.",
        "Blair: What exactly are we looking for, John?",
        "John: Could be anything, you know -- a droplet of blood, a partial print, it could be something that's so little it doesn't even seem like something.",
        "Blair: Really? Oh, you think that's something?",
        "John: I don't know. I don't know. The label's been ripped off. The way the plastic's been broken, it doesn't seem like it was broken by accident.",
        "Blair: But it's -- it's broken, it's worthless. Look, John, thank you. Thank you for doing this. Thank you for coming all this way to help me find Todd. I really appreciate it.",
        "John: Yeah, well, you know, you helped me nail Truman. I sort of owe you one.",
        "Blair: But you can't stay here forever.",
        "Dorian: Uh, excuse me, that goes for you, too.",
        "Blair: Well, I can't go back home without Todd. The kids will get suspicious, especially Starr.",
        "John: Sooner or later you're going to have to tell them something.",
        "Dorian: Well, you know Starr. She'd figure it out on her own anyway.",
        "Blair: Well, who knows? Maybe we'll find Todd before then. We might. And right now, I just don't want to worry my kids. I mean ignorance -- it's bliss. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Henry, are you crazy? You almost hit that kid!",
        "Cole: Henry, are you listening?",
        "Britney: Oh, my God, you guys -- shut up and let him concentrate. With you two bugging him all the time, no wonder --",
        "Henry: Britney, no one invited you, either.",
        "Britney: Well -- but, Henry, I wanted to talk to you. I mean, I can understand why you're so angry with me, but I saw what you wrote on your Myface page.",
        "Henry: You read that?",
        "Britney: Well, of course I did. I check it every day. I mean, that was so sweet what you said about giving me another chance and forgiving me.",
        "Henry: That was before I saw the picture of you and Garrett attached to my locker, and before amber came to me to get the picture you gave to me to give to him.",
        "Starr: No way -- you didn't.",
        "Henry: I must've looked at that picture a thousand times a day all because you gave it to me.",
        "Britney: Well, I'll give you another one.",
        "Henry: It won't be the same. You can't treat people like this and then expect them to like you.",
        "Britney: Well, Henry, I'm sorry. I guess I just never realized how much you cared about me. I mean, most people are only my friend because I'm pretty or popular.",
        "Starr: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Britney: Look, I'm really sorry. I made a huge mistake. It was so stupid. I'll try better if you forgive me.",
        "Starr: Henry, you're not going to believe her, are you? Henry? Henry!",
        "Cole: Ok, that was the second stop sign you went through without so much as tapping on the brake. I think it's time you pull over, buddy.",
        "Henry: Huh. I'm not your buddy, or your friend. I don't have any friends.",
        "Britney: Well, Henry, I was hoping I was a little more than a friend. Do you remember those earrings you gave me?",
        "Henry: How could I forget that humiliation?",
        "Britney: Oh, I was PMSing. They make me act really bitchy.",
        "Starr: Britney, don't even --",
        "Britney: Starr, shut up! This is between me and Henry.",
        "Cole: Not if you get us killed.",
        "Henry: What, are you scared?",
        "Britney: You know, Henry, I was so, so wrong about those earrings. I've been thinking about how beautiful they were and -- do you still have them?",
        "Henry: Yeah, they're in my -- Henry, don't give them to her!",
        "Cole: Henry, come on, put both hands on the wheel!",
        "Henry: Are you serious? You really like them?",
        "Britney: Of course. I wouldn't lie about something like that. That would be so cruel.",
        "Starr: My gosh!",
        "Britney: If you give them to me, I'll wear them forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I think it's a great idea that you're going to visit Hugh's grave, but after that I want you home, Paige.",
        "Paige: I am home. I told you, I'm not going to leave Llanview.",
        "Bo: I'm not talking about Llanview. I mean home, our home. My place. For good, ok? I want us to make it, honey, ok?",
        "Paige: Even after everything that has happened?",
        "Bo: Hey, Spencer's dead. That's all behind us now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Be honest, Marty. You never wished Todd dead?",
        "Marty: No. Yes, we have our issues, but --",
        "Miles: \"Issues\" is too kind a word.",
        "Marty: Ok, you're right. You know our story, ok? Todd did the worst thing imaginable to me. I wanted him punished. I wanted to make sure that he never, ever did the same thing to another woman again. But I didn't want him dead.",
        "Miles: I just don't get this.",
        "Marty: What don't you get?",
        "Miles: Well, I mean, Todd Manning did all these terrible things, and you let him off the hook. But Spencer, he does a couple of wonderful things, and everybody can't wait for the guy to die.",
        "Marty: Todd and Spencer are very different cases.",
        "Miles: How?",
        "Marty: Miles, Spencer -- he had no conscience. That's why I found him unfit to stand trial. Ok, he may have done some wonderful things, but he -- he did terrible things, evil things. And he showed no remorse. That's the difference between him and Todd. Todd -- he genuinely suffers for the mistakes he made, and he has two kids that he loves and they love and need him. So for their sake, I hope he's alive.",
        "Miles: Well, if Spencer is the man that everyone thought he was, might be too late for Todd.",

        "Blair: Hello?",
        "Marcie: Blair? It's Marcie McBain. Look, I know you're out of town, but, um, something's happened.",
        "Blair: What is it?",
        "Marcie: It's Starr.",
        "Blair: Well, what -- what's going on? Does it have anything to do with Cole Thornhart?",
        "Marcie: Yeah -- I mean, Cole's involved, but it -- it's not him.",
        "Blair: What's going on with Starr?",
        "Marcie: Henry Mackler was supposed to have a student-driving lesson after school and, for some reason, he took off in the car without the instructor.",
        "Blair: Marcie, what does this have to do with my daughter?",
        "Marcie: Three other students got in the car with him, and we don't know where they are.",
        "Blair: Marcie, are you telling me that Starr is in the car with them?",
        "Marcie: I'm afraid so, yes.",
        "Blair: Oh, God -- this -- find my daughter, please, and make sure that she's safe.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",

        "Blair: Starr -- Starr!",
        "Henry: You promise lying about the earrings?",
        "Britney: Can I show you? Here, let me try them on.",
        "Henry: Ok.",
        "Britney: See, Henry -- look. Aren't they pretty? I don't know how I didn't notice that before.",
        "Henry: Who was that on the phone?",
        "Starr: It was -- it was my mom, Henry, but she's going to know that something's up if I don't answer --",
        "Henry: Look, I told you not to answer your phone.",
        "Britney: Forget about her -- look at the earrings. Look.",
        "Cole: Henry --",
        "Henry: They're nice.",

        "Henry: Give it back!",
        "Starr: You're swerving!",
        "Cole: This is a Dexy, isn't it?",
        "Henry: That's none of your business.",
        "Britney: Henry, look, see -- don't they look pretty on me?",
        "Henry: They look nice.",
        "Starr: Wait -- what's a \"Dexy,\" Cole?",
        "Cole: It's a -- it's a pill to make you stay up, like if you have to stay up overnight. Henry, how long has it been since you've slept?",
        "Henry: Oh. You shouldn't be asking me anything, steroid boy.",
        "Cole: Hey, I'm just trying to help, all right?",
        "Henry: God -- yeah, right.",
        "Cole: So, come on, Henry. Please, just tell me -- how long has it been since you had any sleep?",
        "Henry: It's been a long time.",
        "Starr: Henry, why would you do something like that to yourself?",
        "Henry: For her. I did everything for you. I couldn't balance my schoolwork and my homework and your homework and sleep at the same time. Something had to give, so I just -- I stopped sleeping. I've been popping those pills like they're candy.",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh -- you haven't even slept an hour?",

        "Jessica: Yeah, I know what it is. I did an article on it once.",
        "Natalie: They caught it early.",
        "Antonio: Yes, which means they can treat it.",
        "Jessica: How?",
        "Michael: Well, currently the only method of treatment is drug therapy.",
        "Jessica: And there's no cure?",
        "Michael: Well, it's possible that after treatment, your blood will show no sign of the virus, but I can't guarantee it won't come back.",
        "Jessica: Ok, how long have I had it?",
        "Michael: We won't know that until we biopsy your liver.",

        "Marty: Well, you're going to have to figure out how to uncomplicate it. Look, I have a meeting with Detective Sanchez about a -- a case. I'm doing some profiling for him, so I have to go. Are you going to be ok?",
        "Miles: Yeah, yeah. Go do what you got to do. I'll talk to you later.",

        "Bo: I just had a thought -- ahem. When you get back, do you think that we can spend some time together, alone time, really quality time? Because I'd rather nobody else know this -- I miss you when you're gone.",
        "Paige: Well, I miss you, too. I'm not going to be gone that long.",
        "Bo: A day is too long.",

        "Starr: Henry, what kind of pill keeps you up for two weeks?",
        "Henry: Dexamphetamines. And it doesn't just keep you awake -- it helps you focus and get better grades.",
