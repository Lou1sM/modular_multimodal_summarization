        "Spencer: Oh, I think I could appreciate it a lot more if I knew where you were.",
        "David: All right, all right! Since you insist, I'll put her on. Someone would like to reach out and touch you.",

        "Marcie: And --",
        "Michael: Did you hear what you just said? \"Roxy says.\" Ok? Don't worry about what Roxy says. It ain't be bad luck if it's meant to be.",

        "David: I'll bet you can name that tune in four notes.",
        "Spencer: All right, David, just tell me what you want.",
        "David: Margaret, would you give me a few private roaming minutes with my big brother, Spencer?",
        "Margaret: Oh -- ok. I'll wait for you over there. But this is really weird, and I want some answers.",

        "Spencer: You really think you have the upper hand, don't you, did?",
        "David: Oh, I do have the upper hand. I have the ace in the hole. I have all the cards, all the marbles. And if you want to add one more clich\u00e9 to the pile, let's talk turkey, Spencer.",

        "Adriana: All right, Rex, forget the matches. I'll settle for a flashlight, a glow stick. Rex? Rex, what are you doing? Oh, it does feel good.",

        "Tess: Oh, please, you're nobody's hero, loser.",
        "Nash: Hey, take it easy, all right? You can't blame Antonio. He loves Jessica just as much as I love you.",
        "Tess: Ok, this is low, even for you. I let you in the delivery room with me while I was giving birth. And the second the baby pops out, you're all whining and crying to the A.D.A., slamming me with court orders? You're a pig! I ha no idea what Jessica ever saw in you.",
        "Antonio: She knows that'll do anything to protect her, and since she's not here to protect herself, to -- fight you, then I'm going to do it for her.",

        "Michael: I have to get a 20 on John.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well, it would be nice for the best man to be here to eventually make the best man toast.",
        "Michael: Yeah, it would, but we are talking about my brother, John, the cop, you know? With the storm out there, he's probably, like, setting up road blocks, filling sandbags. I mean, he can't just turn that police thing on and off.",
        "Marcie: He should learn to flip the switch for once, Michael, and he should be here for his own brother's wedding.",
        "Michael: He will be here. Count on it.",

        "Rex: Did I miss something? Don't do what again?",
        "Adriana: Be such a jerk. It's storming like crazy, we have no power, and you were supposed to be trying to get the lights back on.",
        "Rex: Which is exactly what I was doing. What's your problem?",
        "Adriana: Trying to turn the lights back on, Rex. Trying to turn me on with a shoulder rub.",
        "Rex: Um -- in what alternate universe was I rubbing your shoulders? Not that I don't want to be there.",
        "Adriana: Stop it, Rex.",
        "Rex: I know you're scared. I'm just trying to help.",
        "Adriana: Don't even try to play head games with me, all right?",
        "Rex: What head games? I'm just trying to get the lights back on, but all we have is emergency power. It's not just this place.",
        "Adriana: Why did you come in here and put your hands on me?",
        "Rex: Adriana, swear to God, sweet as a fantasy as that is, I did not put my hands on you. I was in the hall working on the fuse box until I came in here and you called me a jerk.",
        "Adriana: This isn't funny.",
        "Rex: Do you see me laughing?",
        "Adriana: Are you telling me you didn't touch me just now? Oh, my God, he was here.",
        "Rex: The stalker -- was here?",
        "Adriana: Rex, what if he still is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: How's the view from under my thumb, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: What exactly do you plan to do with your discovery?",
        "David: Hmm. Decisions, decisions. I could always play the revenge card, rat you out to the cops and to your new lady love. Serve you right for screwing me into the ground all these years.",
        "Spencer: All right, just tell me what you want, damn it.",
        "David: Simply this. You make sure that my name is never mentioned in Thomas Mc Bain's murder, and I will never let on that Margaret Cochran is alive and well and speaking Thai like a -- person from Thailand.",
        "Spencer: That's a very interesting story, David. And even if it is true, why do you think you've tied me to this woman?",
        "David: Spencer, you idiot. I didn't come here looking for Margaret, I came here looking for the baby. I thought you killed the nut job. You remember the baby, don't you? The one that you and Paige delivered? You're listening to me now, aren't you? Yeah, I'm all too aware of the not-so-immaculate delivery.",
        "Spencer: So if I keep your name out of the Mc Bain incident, then you will let this all go?",
        "David: I won't breathe one more word of it. We'll keep Margaret our dirty little secret. Of course, I'll keep some evidence as an insurance policy. A guy can't be too sure when his brother's a stinking, lying liar.",
        "Spencer: Oh, but you would throw Paige to the wolves just to save yourself, right, David?",
        "David: There's nothing more I can do for Paige. But God helps those who help themselves.",
        "Spencer: I'm not God, David.",
        "David: Yeah, you just play him when it suits you. So what's it going to be? You going to work a miracle? Are you going to make sure that my name is never mentioned with Thomas Mc Bain's death?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey, Spencer --",
        "Spencer: Yeah?",
        "Michael: I'm sorry to interrupt. My -- my brother/best man is a no-show.",
        "Spencer: Uh -- what can I do? Tell me.",
        "Michael: Well, you could make the toast, and make my bride's wedding day perfect.",
        "Lindsay: You know what?",
        "Lindsay: You know what? Even with the storm, the wedding was perfect.",
        "Mr. Walsh: I could feel your mom's love beaming down all over the place.",
        "Layla: I was just talking to one of the caterers, and their van blew over in the parking lot.",
        "Roxy: Well, forget about the food. We'd better batten down the booze.",
        "Woman: Oh --",

        "Evangeline: Yeah, my eyes hurt!",
        "Cristian: Ok. Ok, well, keep them shut. There's glass and dust everywhere. I'll go see if I can find some water. We'll rinse them out, ok?",
        "Evangeline: No, no, no. Don't leave me, please.",
        "Cristian: I'll be back as quick as I can.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, wait. Wait. Where's John? Where's Natalie?",
        "[Thunder]",
        "John: Natalie -- Natalie, listen to me. Come on, you got to stay awake. You got to stay awake. Hey.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, what happened?",
        "John: I think we got hit by a tornado. Blew right through the church. The whole place is a wreck.",
        "Natalie: Ah! Ow, my leg! Oh, John, God, it hurts!",
        "John: Easy, easy, easy. Just stay still.",
        "[Natalie winces]",
        "John: Just stay still. Just -- I know.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my -- John, it hurts!",
        "John: Easy. Stay still.",
        "Natalie: Ow! I don't want to die!",
        "Cristian: John, you there?",
        "John: Yeah! Natalie's cut. You with Evangeline?",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "John: How is she?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. She's hurt, too.",
        "John: Take care of her!",
        "Natalie: Ow!",
        "Evangeline: Natalie's hurting, Cristian. Cristian, she's hurting, though. You got to help --",
        "Cristian: Hey, John is taking care of Natalie. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Uh -- yeah, sure, Michael. I mean, what can I say? You know, I'd be happy to -- to provide a toast for the bride and groom, absolutely. I'm sure your brother's going to be showing up any time now.",
        "Michael: Well, I -- I don't know. I'm really not sure. You know, I just got word that a tornado touched down in Llantano County -- well, not too far from here -- and there are more on the way.",
        "Spencer: Ok. Did you check in with the hospital?",
        "Michael: I did. They're on high alert, expecting incoming, so if you could see, you know, your way to making that toast --",
        "Spencer: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Michael: Before we got called in --",
        "Spencer: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Michael: It would be really, really great. You can do it?",
        "Spencer: I don't profess to be able to fill your brother's shoes, of course, but, yeah, I'd be happy to.",
        "Michael: Oh, thank you so much, and listen, you know, whatever you say, it's going to be fine, ok? Marcie's going to love it and I am going to be eternally in your debt.",
        "Spencer: Just let me wrap up this phone call, all right?",
        "Michael: Yes, yes.",
        "Spencer: All right.",
        "Michael: Thank you, again, so much. I'm going to go break the news to Marcie.",
        "Spencer: All right. You have no idea what you've done, David.",
        "David: Sure I do, Mr. Toastmaster general, so I took extra precautions to be safe.",
        "Spencer: Safe? You're never going to be safe another day in your life, you understand me?",
        "David: Oh, shiver. Should I be afraid?",
        "Spencer: Yes, Davey. You should be afraid -- very afraid. Sleep tight, wherever you are.",
        "Spencer: Denton? David is in Bangkok. What do you mean, what do I want you to do? Eliminate the threat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I'm sorry, Kevin. I haven't seen Kelly all day.",
        "R.J.: No, me, neither.",
        "Layla: She's probably working that fashionably late thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: The storm out there is getting dangerous. Getting dangerous. Viki is safe at the house, but Natalie, Duke, Kevin, and Kelly -- they went to a wedding. I haven't been able to get ahold of them, so I come over here to the hospital to check on Asa, Tess, and the baby, and what do I find -- the three of you fighting yet again. Now, I'm not going to put up with this. It seems to me that the only thing that separates my grandchild from your selfishness is a piece of glass. Now, if you want to fight, take it outside.",
        "Tess: Oh, after you, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Tess: You know, do you want to know what senor control freak did? He got a court order keeping me from taking my baby home.",
        "Clint: Antonio, what did you think that would accomplish?",
        "Tess: That's what I want to know.",
        "Clint: Tess, I don't need your input, ok?",
        "Tess: Well, I didn't ask you.",
        "Clint: You're angry, you're lashing out -- not your best qualities, so just zip it. Keeping the baby here -- what is that going to do?",
        "Antonio: Keeping her here allows me to keep my eye on her.",
        "Clint: Yeah, but Nash has already set up a temporary home for Tess and the baby. They promised not to leave town until things got worked out.",
        "Antonio: Hey, Clint, and you honestly think you can believe or trust anything these two say? They've left before, more than once, with a lot less at stake than there is now.",
        "Clint: Paternity has yet to be determined.",
        "Antonio: And so does maternity. All right? And until it is, in all fairness to Jessica, the baby belongs here where she's not a flight risk.",
        "Nash: Hmm. My word's not enough for you?",
        "Antonio: No, no, Nash, it's not.",
        "Tess: Well, why are you calling the shots, Antonio?",
        "Clint: I have a way to solve this, but it's going to take a compromise.",
        "Tess: Oh, what kind of compromise?",
        "Clint: The baby's going to go home -- with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please, just one moment? I've been asked to sort of pinch-hit for the best man here. He seems to be having a little trouble getting here, because of the storm, no doubt, so I think I can speak for all of us when I say that you just couldn't find two better people than the bride and groom. So for better, for worse, may this be the worst and may it remain behind you and every day hereafter be filled with love and hope and joy. Here's to Michael and Marcie.",
