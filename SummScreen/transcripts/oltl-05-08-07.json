        "Natalie: Feeling any pain?",
        "Jessica: Inside or out?",
        "Natalie: Either.",
        "Jessica: My body feels so achy. But the worst part is knowing that I could've kept this from happening so easily.",
        "Natalie: Oh, honey, you don't know that. You know, Michael. He said there were a few different ways you could've gotten it.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, we both know I did this to myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I could never leave Jessica -- I love her too much. Just do me a favor, though, huh? Don't punish Jessica for loving me. I was praying for Jessica.",
        "Antonio: We all are.",
        "Nash: Yeah, well, this is a sanctuary so I guess your boys in blue can't kick me out of here, too, right?",
        "Antonio: Think this is a joke?",
        "Nash: No, I don't think this is a joke.",
        "Antonio: Then what's with the crack?",
        "Nash: I don't know -- maybe it's a defense mechanism. I'm feeling defensive, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Yeah?",
        "Nash: Yeah. Jessica's collapsed. She's in a hospital, and you and her entire family won't tell me what's wrong or let me see her.",
        "Antonio: We didn't know what was wrong with her until now. She's got Hepatitis C.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ok, so you're sure everything's ready for tonight? Great. Thanks for doing this on such short notice.",
        "Adriana: Who were you talking to?",
        "Rex: The manager at UV. I'm not successful enough of a PI to give up my night job.",
        "Adriana: Do you want to?",
        "Rex: I think about it, sometimes. It's not my passion. However, today being the owner of a nightclub is coming in really handy.",
        "Adriana: How so?",
        "Rex: I've got a big surprise planned for tonight -- one I think you're going to find very interesting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: McBain.",
        "Blair: Is it them?",
        "Marty: Look, would you just be quiet.",
        "Blair: Don't you tell me to be quiet. I'm sure this is all Cole's fault.",
        "Marty: Cole hasn't done anything wrong.",
        "Blair: Oh, right. Wouldn't be the first time.",
        "John: All right, enough. They're at the high school.",
        "Blair: Ok, well, then let's go.",
        "Marty: Thank God.",
        "John: Wait -- there's something you need to know.",
        "Marty: What?",
        "Blair: What is it?",
        "John: There was an accident, all right?",
        "Blair: Are they ok?",
        "John: Just outside the parking lot, the car hit a tree.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God.",
        "Blair: Well, is everybody all right?",
        "John: There's no word yet.",
        "Blair: Well, come on.",
        "Marty: We have to get over there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah. Officer: If you'll just have a seat here. Your parents will be right on their way.",
        "Bo: Hey, Starr? Are you all right? Hey, are you hurt?",
        "Starr: It was awful! Henry was out of control and he was going so fast! And we tried to stop him and he was so -- and I was just --",
        "Bo: Hey, now, now, it's ok, it's ok, listen -- you're all right, that's all that matters right now.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I'm -- I'm fine. The car crashed, but it's ok.",
        "Bo: Good, good.",
        "Starr: Yeah. My mom -- my mom! I need to call my mom!",
        "Bo: It's all right. Your parents have been notified. All your parents have been notified. Listen, sit down. We have to have the paramedics check you out, see if you need to go to the hospital.",
        "Cole: Leave me alone, I'm fine! Starr, you ok? You ok?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I'm ok. I thought we were all going to die.",
        "Cole: So did I.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: I'm so glad you're all right.",
        "Starr: I'm glad you're ok, too.",
        "Bo: Ms. Jennings, are you ok?",
        "Britney: I don't know -- I guess so. I'm so shocked, I -- I never expected that. I just -- it was so extreme. Henry just went psycho.",
        "Marcie: Oh, my God! Oh, my God, you're so -- you're ok! Are you all right?",
        "Starr: Langston!",
        "Langston: I thought I'd never see you again!",
        "Starr: I know, so did I. So did I. Shh, shh.",
        "Marcie: When I saw Henry race off in the car with the three of you, I just -- I didn't know what to think.",
        "Starr: I just -- Henry, where -- where's Henry? Is he ok? Where is he?",
        "Cole: I don't know.",
        "Starr: Cole, have you seen him?",
        "Cole: I don't know. After the car crash, I didn't see him.",
        "Britney: Yeah, I didn't see him, either. The paramedics pulled us out of the car.",
        "Starr: Mr. Buchanan --",
        "Bo: Henry was the only one in the car that wasn't wearing a seat belt, so he was thrown from the car when it hit the tree.",
        "Starr: Oh, my -- he's ok, right?",
        "Bo: No. I'm sorry, but Henry died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: What sort of surprise?",
        "Rex: You don't look excited, you look nervous.",
        "Adriana: Well, I guess I am. The way you've been acting lately, your surprises haven't always been the best kind.",
        "Rex: Oh, what, and Tate's are? Like when he surprised you and the rest of the world by announcing his love for you on national TV?",
        "Adriana: No, that was a bad surprise, too. Look, I guess I'm just a little worried -- surprises from either one of you. So why don't you just tell me what's going on?",
        "Rex: I can't.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean, you can't? Haven't you trusted me with enough secrets already? Like Todd's baby?",
        "Rex: Would you keep it down?",
        "Adriana: I'm not stupid, Rex.",
        "Rex: Ok. Let's take it easy. If we keep going like this, we're going to get in a fight.",
        "Adriana: Sorry. I guess just talking about Michael and Marcie and Tommy -- it bothers me.",
        "Rex: You're not having second thoughts about telling them, are you?",
        "Adriana: How can you ask me that after all this time?",
        "Rex: No, I'm not doubting you. I'm upset, too. Todd's still missing. Sometimes I think he's dead.",
        "Adriana: Don't even think that. Starr and Jack need their father.",
        "Rex: And Tommy, too. As far as that kid knows, Michael's his dad. But if Todd comes back, sometimes I think it's inevitable that he's going to find out the truth.",
        "Adriana: He's not, ok? The more time goes on, the less likely it is that the truth will really come out.",
        "Rex: Do you really believe that?",
        "Adriana: I really want to believe that.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you and me both.",
        "Adriana: So what's my surprise?",
        "Rex: No -- it'll take away some of the punch if I tell you now. Do you trust me?",
        "Adriana: Of course.",
        "Rex: Good.",
        "Adriana: I'm going to the ladies' room. Perhaps when I come back, you'll be more inclined to tell me all about your surprise at UV tonight.",
        "Rex: Never. You can torture me, put me on the rack -- I'm not telling. I want you to be blown away.",
        "Adriana: I'm sure I will be.",
        "Rex: Not as blown away as Tate's going to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Henry -- Henry is dead? I can't -- I can't believe it. How -- how can he die, and all of us got out ok?",
        "Britney: You know, there was something wrong with him before the crash. I mean, that's why we hit the tree. I -- I think he was sick.",
        "Cole: He didn't deserve this.",
        "Bo: I am sorry. Um -- I'll give you a few minutes, and then we'll take your official statements, ok?",
        "Marcie: I don't really understand. Henry was a good kid. He was a good student. I -- I just don't understand why he would do something so crazy.",
        "Starr: Mom!",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. I was so sorry that I wasn't here. Look at you. I tried to rush back as soon as I could, and I was just -- I saw that crashed car and my heart stopped, sweetie. Are you all right?",
        "Starr: Henry is dead.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God, Cole, I was so frightened.",
        "Cole: Well, don't worry.",
        "Marty: No, but you could have been killed. Don't you ever do that to me again, ok? Do you hear me?",
        "Britney: Cole didn't do anything. He was just trying to help. That's why he was there.",
        "Blair: So tell me, what happened here, and who was this boy?",
        "Starr: He was a really good kid, Mom. He was in my English Lit class.",
        "Langston: He was kind of an outcast. He caught a lot of grief, and he didn't even deserve it.",
        "Marcie: Do you know why he stole the car? Why on earth would any of you get in the car with him?",
        "Starr: You're going to have to ask her.",
        "Marcie: Britney?",
        "Britney: Well, I didn't take a car and crash it into a tree. What are you all looking at me like that for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I did it to myself.",
        "Natalie: Don't say that.",
        "Jessica: No. No, it's true. I did it, or Tess did it.",
        "Natalie: You can't be sure of that.",
        "Jessica: I am sure. It's Tess' big joke. I mean, she always had to have the last word.",
        "Michael: The last word hasn't been spoken yet. Now, all you have to say is \"I'm going to fight this.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Hep C -- what, that's -- that's --",
        "Antonio: The worst. It's serious.",
        "Nash: How serious?",
        "Antonio: Very. It attacks the liver. It's probably -- possibly fatal.",
        "Nash: What about the treatment? I mean, there's got to be some treatment. They're treating her, right?",
        "Antonio: It depends how far along it is. They're going to take a liver biopsy.",
        "Nash: How --",
        "Antonio: If you're asking me how she got it, I don't know. It's a virus that's carried in the blood. There's only a few ways.",
        "Nash: Oh. Sex?",
        "Antonio: No. No, only in the blood. I need an honest answer from you.",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Antonio: What kind of drugs did you and Tess do? Did you ever share a needle? Answer me, Nash. Did you ever shoot up?",
        "Nash: No, I never shot up with Tess. I don't shoot up, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: You haven't, what about her?",
        "Nash: I don't know. Hey, anything was possible with Tess.",
        "Antonio: No, it seems like anything is \"possible\" with you.",
        "Nash: All right, you're pissed, you got a right to be. But don't you dare blame me for making Jessica sick.",
        "Antonio: I had a few questions that needed answers, that's it.",
        "Nash: Right. So -- uh -- how else could she have gotten sick?",
        "Antonio: I don't know. But we have other things to worry about.",
        "Nash: Oh, we got other things to worry about besides Jessica on her deathbed?",
        "Antonio: Hep C can be passed from a pregnant mother to her baby.",
        "Nash: Bree.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: No, you don't understand. This is about Tess.",
        "Michael: No. It's about you, Jessica. Now, it's Jessica that has to concentrate on getting better, Jessica that has to keep a positive outlook and trust us to treat her, get her out of here.",
        "Natalie: Do you need to examine her now?",
        "Michael: Not right now. I wanted to let you know Viki's back and she's taking Bree down to be tested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I have a confession to make.",
        "Rex: You're secretly Mrs. Tate Harmon?",
        "Adriana: Oh, that's not funny.",
        "Rex: Why not? I think you being married to that guy would be a joke.",
        "Adriana: Do you want to hear my confession or not?",
        "Rex: Oh, all you good catholic girls and your confessions. Yes, my child, tell me what you've done, and I will determine your punishment.",
        "Adriana: I called your hostess at U.V. and she spilled the beans about your surprise.",
        "Rex: You went behind my back? Why'd you do that?",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry, ok? I guess I'm just a little gun-shy about surprises these days after the whole \"View\" thing.",
        "Rex: That wasn't me.",
        "Adriana: I know that, but I have a case of posttraumatic Tate syndrome.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you and me both. So, just how much do you know?",
        "Adriana: Everything. And I have to say, Mr. Balsom, I didn't think that there was anything you could do to shock me, but you've really done it this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You want to know why we're all staring at you, Britney? Because you're the reason Henry is dead.",
        "John: Hey, look, a young guy died today. Let's get all our facts straight before we start assigning blame, ok?",
        "Britney: Cole, do you think it was my fault?",
        "Cole: I'm with Lieutenant McBain here. We all just need to deal with the shock of all this and stop pointing fingers. I mean, it doesn't matter, it's not going to bring Henry back.",
        "Langston: Britney's been torturing him all year. He finally snapped.",
        "Britney: Ok, I was just as much of a victim as anyone else here. I could've died, too.",
        "Starr: Did you hear what he was saying in the car, Britney? He was up night after night doing your and his homework. He couldn't take it anymore. He had to take pills.",
        "Cole: Dexies.",
        "Langston: Henry?",
        "Starr: Yeah, one of the pills fell out of his pocket and he said it was helping him stay awake.",
        "John: It's an amphetamine. When misused, it can cause panic attacks and hallucinations. It's not something you want to be messing with.",
        "Bo: How much was he taking?",
        "Cole: Enough to stay awake for two weeks straight.",
        "John: Ok, you all said he slumped over the wheel before you crashed.",
        "Starr: Yeah, he was having pains. He said it felt like it was someone stabbing him.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and his arm was hurting, too, and he was sweating a lot. I tried to get him to pull over so that I could drive, but --",
        "Starr: But he wouldn't listen to any of us. He said that he was sick of being ordered around.",
        "John: Sounds like he had a heart attack brought on by a drug overdose.",
        "Cole: Yeah, he kept getting worse. I think he was getting scared.",
        "Starr: That's when you finally convinced him to go back to school and --",
        "Cole: Yeah, but by the time he got here, he saw all the cops and freaked, and just lost control.",
        "Blair: Starr, what in the world were you doing in that boy's car in the first place?",
        "Cole: We were trying to help Henry. All right, he got himself into a difficult situation, and Starr and I were just trying to help him. We got in the car to talk, that's it.",
        "John: What kind of difficult situation?",
        "Langston: Britney.",
        "Britney: I didn't do anything.",
        "Starr: He was trying to manipulate him into helping her with her schoolwork again.",
        "Marcie: Henry was doing your schoolwork for you?",
        "Britney: No.",
        "Cole: Heather told us that you were going to surprise us with a test tomorrow.",
        "Marcie: That's right -- I was.",
        "Britney: Well, what's the difference now? Henry's dead! I mean, all that stuff -- there's no point in even talking about it!",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah, sure. You say that now, right?",
        "Britney: Ok, I didn't know how much work he had, I didn't know that my little requests were such a big deal to him. He always made it seem like schoolwork was so easy.",
        "Marcie: So how long have these \"little requests\" been going on -- for some time now?",
        "Langston: All year.",
        "John: All right, all right, look, that -- that's enough. This ain't getting us anywhere, all right? The important thing is to make sure you guys are all right. We're going to take some preliminary statements and we'll get you all out of here, all right?",
        "Bo: We'll just take the basics for now because you've had a long day.",
        "John: Britney, why don't you go first. Officer Simmons up here will take your statement.",
        "Blair: Do you understand why hanging out with Cole is dangerous?",
        "Starr: Mom, look, I know your feelings towards Cole, and I am not going back on my word. I just want you to know how much of a hero he was.",
        "Cole: Starr, that's enough. I didn't do anything.",
        "Starr: Yes, you did. Cole, if it wasn't for you, I would be just as dead as Henry is right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I know you're worried, but Hepatitis C doesn't have to --",
        "Jessica: My daughter --",
        "Michael: I understand, believe me. But I want you to know that the odds of contracting the disease in utero are low to moderate.",
        "Jessica: Any risk is too much.",
        "Michael: Let's not jump to any conclusions -- you know, we haven't even got the test results back.",
        "Jessica: Bree doesn't deserve this, you know? She's a sweet, innocent, little baby. I mean, how am I going to live with myself if I gave this to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: All right, Bree -- I've got to get her down --",
        "Antonio: Nash --",
        "Nash: She's got to get tested -- what?",
        "Antonio: Viki's bringing her in now.",
        "Nash: Thank you. Thank you for telling me.",
        "Antonio: You're her father.",
        "Nash: Yeah, yeah -- wait. Don't you think that I deserve to know how Jessica is doing? Jessica gave birth to Bree.",
        "Antonio: Tess gave birth to Bree.",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Antonio: And no, I don't think you deserve to know. Jessica's my wife.",
        "Nash: Yeah, Jessica's your wife, and Jessica and --",
        "Antonio: What, Nash? If you got something to say, say it.",
        "Nash: You got to let me see her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Is there anything else, you know, any questions about this?",
        "Jessica: I just want you to be honest with me. Am I going to be able to be Bree's mom?",
        "Michael: Let's take this one step at a time, ok? We haven't even biopsied your liver yet.",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Michael: Is there anything else I can do for you?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, one more thing. Um -- when you're waiting for Bree's test, could you just say a little prayer for her, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: She is the mother of my child. I have a right to see her.",
        "Antonio: No, that's where you're wrong. You may have a right to see your daughter, but you have no right to see Jessica.",
        "Nash: Please.",
        "Antonio: If I hear that you upset her -- never do that.",
        "Nash: Thank you.",
        "Antonio: Go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ok, so -- so when you say you know everything, you mean that --",
        "Adriana: I know that you planned an aids fundraiser tonight at U.V.",
        "Rex: Oh, that \"everything\"? Right -- duh! You surprised?",
        "Adriana: I'm shocked. I didn't know that inside this adorable troublemaker, there lurked the heart of a compassionate person. Well, I mean, I did know that, but I thought I was the only one that saw it. This is a big step for you, Rex -- outing yourself as a humanitarian and being vulnerable enough to show how much you care about other people?",
        "Rex: Yeah, that's me, Mr. Compassion.",
        "Adriana: I think it's wonderful.",
        "Rex: You do?",
        "Adriana: I do. So, are you going to punish me for going behind your back and making that phone call?",
        "Rex: Of course -- but not here. Let's go back to your place, and I'll teach you a lesson. Because you've been a very, very bad girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Cole, I am so proud of you.",
        "Marcie: Me, too. It took tremendous courage and a lot of strength of character to talk Henry into coming back.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, I don't feel so proud.",
        "Blair: Starr? You were brave, too. And that poor boy -- it's a tragedy. Such a waste of a young life.",
        "John: How you doing, kid?",
        "Cole: All right. But Starr's wrong -- I'm no hero. Do you want to know why Henry was willing to listen to me?",
        "John: Sure.",
        "Cole: Because I talked to him, one druggie to another. You know, I -- I told him how much we were alike -- that I had freaked out my mind and body on drugs just like he did. Yeah, it got him to calm down a little bit, but it definitely wasn't one of my proudest moments.",
        "John: My old man, he was a -- he was a big believer in fate. You know, he always believed people were put in a certain place at a certain time for a reason. And all that stuff you went through earlier this year -- you know, with the steroids and stuff -- you had to go through that so you could be there for Starr and Britney when they needed you most.",

        "Marcie: They'll what?",
        "Starr: They will what? Hate you? They should. Don't think that this is all going to get covered up, Britney. Because I am going to make sure that the whole school finds out exactly what you did.",

        "Tate: This is just a business call, ok, so don't come at me with an ice pick or anything sharp.",
        "Rex: What about something blunt?",
        "Tate: Seriously, Rex, Adriana and I have to go over my schedule for exposed because I'm working at the TV station right now. You got a problem with that?",
        "Rex: Ever heard of using a phone?",
        "Adriana: Rex, back off, please? I knew he was coming over.",
        "Rex: Well, your station's doing a piece down at my club tonight.",
        "Tate: Really? What about?",
        "Adriana: The aids awareness fundraiser?",
        "Rex: Yes, the fundraiser -- and more.",
        "Adriana: What's the \"more\"?",

        "Natalie: She needs you.",
        "Antonio: I told Nash he could see her.",

        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Tate: Disappointed?",
        "Adriana: No, of course not. I just thought that maybe you were trying to test the waters again.",

        "Roxy: Baby, ok, all right, I'm sorry, that was a low blow.",
        "Rex: Roxy, Tate is using Adriana to make him look straight. He's built up this image that he's this big lady's man, and he's afraid if anybody finds out the secret, it's going to mess up his career, and I will be damned if I'm going to let him use Adriana like that.",
