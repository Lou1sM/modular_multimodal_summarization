        "Blair: Well, I -- it doesn't mean --",
        "Kevin: Oh, God -- yes, it means -- I'll tell you what it means. It means that it's over. It's finished.",
        "Blair: Oh --",
        "Kevin: All right? It means that -- that she is now free to go out there and have a life with another guy.",
        "Blair: Ah. And, what, are you free to wallow in self-pity and drink yourself into oblivion?",
        "Kevin: Works for me.",
        "Blair: Oh, it does not. Because it's not who you are, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Oh, like you know who I am?",
        "Blair: Yeah. You know what? As a matter of fact, I do. A couple of years back, I think I got to know you pretty well.",
        "Kevin: Oh, come on. It was just because we were so angry at Todd and Kelly. And it's just all out commiserating.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I agree. It's probably a good thing that we came to our senses.",
        "Kevin: Oh -- well, we're doing a hell of a job. I'll tell you what -- Todd's going to be executed in a couple of weeks, and Kelly and I can't even have a civilized conversation.",
        "Blair: Kelly is desperately trying to hold on to a man that she loves.",
        "Kevin: Well, she's --",
        "Blair: And that's it.",
        "Kevin: She's got a strange way of showing it, I'll tell you that.",

        "Kevin: For God's sakes, don't you think I feel bad enough?",
        "Blair: No, actually, I don't. You're the one that walked out on her in the middle of this nightmare. And you walked out because you were hurt, you were angry. Did you think for a minute -- one minute about Kelly?",
        "Kevin: Look, I'm sure she's not still at the rectory, ok? She was too upset. She wouldn't want to be alone.",

        "Blair: Oh, come on! Why don't you just dredge up a bunch of stuff that's happened 100 years ago? That just real mature, Kevin.",

        "Blair: Kelly loves you, Kevin. Huh, God only knows why. But you -- you have her heart. And you know what the saddest part about this whole thing is, is that it doesn't mean anything to you. It's like a big waste, because all you have ever done is make a mockery of her love for you. And her loyalty to you.",
        "Kevin: Oh, come on --",

        "Kevin: What would you know about her feelings for me? You guys don't even talk anymore.",
        "Blair: And I wonder why that is, Kevin. I'll tell you why. Because she's so busy loving you, you big idiot, that she would lie to me, her own family, about Todd, just to protect your sorry butt. And you have the gall to sit there and tell me that -- that Kelly could go off and -- and sleep with somebody just because she's pissed at you? How dare you talk about my cousin like that?",

        "Kevin: I'm -- I'm confused, ok?",
        "Blair: Oh, really? Yeah. I wonder why that is, Kevin, huh? Because when things don't go Kevin Buchanan's way, the big, spoiled baby, he goes off and gets drunk. Gee, maybe that's why things are fuzzy in your head. Things get all fuzzy in your head because you want to go off and screw your life up even more than it already is!",
