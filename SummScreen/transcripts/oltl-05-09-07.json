        "Blair: Could you just keep your voice down, please?",

        "Starr: But dad -- he could be -- he could be dead.",
        "Blair: He's not. He's not. He's fine, wherever he is.",
        "Starr: Well, then why didn't you tell me that he was missing?",

        "Jessica: Well, Antonio will have something to say about that.",
        "Nash: Well, he can try. But it won't do him any good. All right?",
        "Jessica: You don't know Antonio.",
        "Nash: Ha, ha. Well, he doesn't know me. He tried to keep me away from you, but I wore him down.",

        "Nash: And he's right.",
        "Jessica: But he doesn't know that I love you.",

        "Jane: Did Tate Harmon give you permission to out him?",
        "Rex: Tate needs to understand the world will accept him for who he is. He doesn't have to hide anymore.",
        "Jane: Is that the reason why you're hosting this aids awareness fundraiser?",
        "Rex: The purpose of the fundraiser is to raise funds. Tate is a role model to gays everywhere. Successful athlete --",

        "Rex: My girlfriend's company.",

        "Jane: Well, you have a big crowd already.",
        "Rex: Well, it can never be big enough. So anyone in Llanview who is gay, or -- or has gay friends, needs to come down here and support this worthy cause.",
        "Jane: So you think if Tate were to confess his sexual orientation, more people would come?",
        "Rex: Absolutely.",
        "Jane: And his claim to be in love with Adriana --",
        "Rex: I -- it's a cover. I told you, she's with me.",

        "Rex: Yeah, you did great.",
        "Jane: Off the record -- why'd you out him?",

        "Roxy: You sure that was such a good idea?",
        "Rex: You're not?",
        "Roxy: People who get bitten bite back. You'd better watch yourself.",

        "Marty: I know.",
        "Starr: How did you lose dad?",
        "Blair: Well, your father found the adoption agency that took in his son, the one that he had with Margaret.",
        "Starr: Is the baby alive?",
        "Blair: I don't know. And legally the adoption agency won't be able to give us any information on that.",
        "Starr: Well, that never stopped dad before. You know what? May-- maybe he's hiding from the police.",
        "Blair: I think he got a phone call -- a lead about his son.",
        "Starr: And he just left without you?",
        "Blair: Well, I was asleep, and then when I woke up, he was gone. I guess that's when he got the call.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Miles: I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Blair: What is it, Miles?",

        "Miles: I -- I was -- I just gave him the numbers that -- that Spencer gave me. I didn't know what they meant.",
        "Blair: \"The numbers?\" \"The numbers\"? You knew how Spencer felt about Todd. You knew those numbers were -- were bad news. It's your fault if something has happened to Todd!",

        "Rex: I don't hate gays.",
        "Roxy: Oh, only Tate Harmon.",
        "Rex: He can't use my girlfriend to cover his homosexuality.",
        "Roxy: So you're trying to get even with him by outing him on -- on television?",
        "Rex: I was promoting my fundraiser.",
        "Roxy: You know, it's a little late for that. I mean, the event is half done.",
        "Rex: There's nothing wrong with being gay.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, there's something wrong with you. You have no common sense. He's a famous jock, and he's promoting your girlfriend's undie company. You make me so ashamed.",
        "Rex: I was just being honest.",
        "Roxy: Well, why don't you try being a little honest with yourself? You're pissed at him because he's a stud making a move on your girlfriend. You're doing everything you can to ruin him.",
        "Rex: No, he was using Adriana.",
        "Roxy: Does Adriana have a say in this?",
        "Rex: No, she's too nice to stand up for herself.",
        "Roxy: That's not the Adriana that I know.",
        "Rex: Ok, I'm an idiot. I -- I should have let the gay man paw at my girlfriend to protect his masculinity.",
        "Roxy: Let me get this straight. His wife said that he was gay?",
        "Rex: His wife --",
        "[Cheers]",
        "Rex: And --",
        "Tate: Are you out of your damn mind?",
        "Roxy: Hey! Stop!",
        "Rex: This is a turn-on for you, beating up straight guys?",
        "Tate: Maybe you won't have a such smart mouth with a few less teeth, huh?",
        "Adriana: No --",
        "Rex: Ah --",
        "Tate: You're not even worth it.",
        "Adriana: That's for sure.",
        "Rex: Whoa -- whose side are you on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You gave that letter to Todd. You set him up.",
        "Miles: No, I --",
        "Blair: That's what you did. You had this crazy idea that maybe -- maybe Spencer faked his death -- you know, to finally get back at Todd --",
        "Starr: Mom -- mom -- please calm down.",
        "Blair: Starr, just listen to me. This man gave your father the clue that sent him to Chicago, yeah.",
        "Miles: I -- listen, I didn't know. Spencer gave it to me, and I didn't know --",
        "Blair: Oh, you didn't know?",
        "John: Shh.",
        "Blair: You're acting all innocent and everything. You're Mitch Laurence's brother through and through.",
        "Miles: This is not an act.",
        "Marty: Blair, this is not the time.",
        "Blair: Stay out of it! Spencer gave miles the gun, and miles pulled the trigger.",
        "Starr: Mom, please --",
        "John: Blair --",
        "Blair: What, you pretended to like me, so I'd trust you and maybe think that you could do no wrong?",
        "Miles: I did nothing wrong.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? You tell that to the judge. What did you do to Todd? I want to know what you did to Todd!",
        "Miles: Nothing!",
        "John: All right, Blair, unless you have some proof, stop right now.",
        "Blair: Todd's missing, John. How much more proof do you need?",
        "John: All right, I'm only going to ask you once. Did you give manning the address of that tenement?",
        "Miles: No, no, of course not.",
        "Blair: No, he -- he did. Will you check his phone records? Just check his phone records!",
        "Starr: Mom, just took off without you.",
        "Blair: Oh, now, that's just great, Starr. Why don't we just let this man get away with murder?",
        "Starr: No, dad's not dead. I would be able to feel that.",
        "Blair: You did this.",
        "Miles: No, I didn't.",
        "Blair: Yes, you did! You sent Todd to an abandoned -- an abandoned place, didn't you? Didn't you? That's what you did!",
        "Starr: No, maybe dad didn't go there, mom. Let's just calm down.",
        "Blair: He was there, Starr!",
        "John: Blair, not now.",
        "Blair: He was there! There was blood on the floor! I saw it!",
        "Starr: What? How did you know that it was -- that it was his?",
        "Blair: Because the police tested it, sweetie.",
        "Starr: No, no. No, not again. Not again.",
        "Marty: Blair, I know you are distraught, but Miles is being honest with you.",
        "Blair: Oh, there you go. She's defending another psychopath. That is just so up your alley, isn't it?",
        "Marty: I'm not going to do this with you, Blair.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Marty: Not today.",
        "Blair: What? Go ahead. I can take it.",
        "Marty: You are distraught. Just don't take it out on miles.",
        "Blair: You stay out this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Antonio, what are you thinking, letting Nash see Jessica?",
        "Antonio: It's the right thing to do, Cris.",
        "Cristian: The right thing to do is to call security right now and get them to kick him out.",
        "Antonio: He's in love with her. He's not going to hurt her.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, you hope he's not going to hurt her.",
        "Antonio: Jess may have passed the hepatitis to the baby.",
        "Cristian: Wow. Wait a minute. You know this for sure?",
        "Antonio: They're testing her now. Nash has a right to talk to Jessica about their daughter.",
        "Cristian: Right. If that's all they're talking about.",
        "Antonio: Well, Jess will keep him on track.",
        "Cristian: Antonio, this is Nash. And he's not going to stop until he gets her to say that she loves him. And it's probably happening right now, I guarantee you.",
        "Antonio: How do you know that? Damn it, Cris, what aren't you telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Don't you want to be with me and Bree, together as a family, the way we were meant to be?",
        "Jessica: Of course I do.",
        "Nash: You haven't changed your mind?",
        "Jessica: No. No, I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.",
        "Nash: But --",
        "Jessica: I have to tell Antonio and my family.",
        "Nash: About us.",
        "Jessica: No. First I have to tell them how I got this disease.",
        "John: Look at your daughter and tell me you want this to continue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You're right. Starr, I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: Could you just take me home now, please?",
        "Blair: You still know more than you're saying.",
        "Miles: I swear, I don't.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah. Well, like I should take the word of a Laurence?",
        "Marty: Blair, just go home before you say something you'll regret. Starr and jack need you.",
        "Blair: They need their father.",
        "John: Yeah. And we will find him, all right? It's been a tough day. Don't make it any worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Listen to me. You don't have to tell anyone how you got Hepatitis.",
        "Jessica: Don't you want to know?",
        "Nash: No. I don't. I just want you to get better.",
        "Jessica: I told you Hepatitis C is not curable.",
        "Nash: They will treat it.",
        "Jessica: Manage it.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: But I'm always going to worry.",
        "Nash: You'll let me worry for you.",
        "Jessica: That's too easy, Nash. Our daughter might already be at risk, and I just want to be there for her.",
        "Nash: You will be.",
        "Jessica: What if I can't?",
        "Nash: But you will be.",
        "Jessica: We have to be realistic, Nash. We have to talk about our daughter's future.",

        "Cristian: You know Nash as well as I do.",
        "Antonio: Better than you.",
        "Cristian: In any case, the guy is --",
        "Antonio: Look, Cris, he knows she's sick. He won't upset her.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but if he thinks that she loves him back --",
        "Antonio: Well, why would he think that?",
        "Cristian: Well, because she's weak right now, you know? She could be easily influenced.",
        "Antonio: Look, before Jessica collapsed, we talked about why she wouldn't adopt Jamie.",
        "Cristian: Listen, Antonio --",
        "Antonio: Look, I am -- I am so frustrated with this whole situation. You have no idea, man. I don't even know how to act sometimes. I feel like my back is up against the wall. It doesn't matter what I say or do -- nothing seems to work. All I know is that I love that woman in there. And I can't lose her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Tate snowed you with lies.",
        "Adriana: Tate didn't do anything. Your jealousy is so out of control that you lied on TV to humiliate him!",
        "Rex: Ok, how do you know it's a lie?",
        "Adriana: Because I know Tate.",
        "Layla: And even if it were true -- and I'm not saying it is -- why would you do this?",
        "Tate: It's not true.",
        "Adriana: I will back you up with the media.",
        "Tate: No, I can handle them, but that doesn't mean that you get a free pass.",
        "Rex: Well, deny all you want. But all these people are snapping pictures of you on their cell phones. You're news. And like you said, there's no such thing as bad publicity.",
        "Adriana: Who are you?",
        "Tate: He wants me gone. If I'm gay, that means that my interest in you isn't real.",
        "Rex: For the zillionth time, it's no lie.",
        "Adriana: Who told you Tate was gay?",
        "Rex: Someone who really knew him well.",
        "Adriana: Did you pay this person?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Adriana: Well, I'm just saying, it wouldn't be the first time you paid for the truth you wanted.",
        "Rex: Adriana, I'm --",
        "Adriana: I'm just saying, for the right price, anyone will say anything, right?",
        "Rex: The ex-Mrs. Tate Harmon didn't want my money. Her grounds for divorce were fraud after she learned her husband played for the other team.",
        "Adriana: You were married?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You're my best friend, Starr. I knew you were in the car with Henry, and I knew he was acting all crazy. I was standing outside talking to the police with Ms. McBain, and I could see the car. And I thought everything was going to be ok. And I saw you all inside, and you seemed fine. And then Henry started driving all crazy in the car. When it crashed, I thought you were dead. And I don't know what I would have done if it had been true.",

        "Blair: Thank you so much, John.",
        "John: You're welcome.",

        "Blair: Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I blew up, and it won't happen again, all right?",
        "Starr: I just want to go home.",
        "Blair: I know. So do I. Langston, you all right, honey?",
        "Langston: I'm fine. I -- I'm just -- I still can't believe it about Henry. I guess you just don't expect someone your own age to die, you know?",
        "Starr: It's so weird. I mean, I knew that he was crazy because of the drugs, but he was alive one minute, and then the next he wasn't.",
        "Blair: Well, it's a really tough lesson for the two of you to learn at your age.",
        "Langston: I know. I'm not saying it's right for anybody to die that way, but Henry was just so --",
        "Starr: Harmless.",
        "Langston: Yeah. He wouldn't even hurt a flea.",

        "Rex: She's real, Adriana. I met her.",
        "Tate: You got nothing better to do than dig up my past?",
        "Rex: Wait -- nope.",
        "Adriana: Why didn't you ever mention you were married?",
        "Tate: It was a long time ago, and it's not important.",

        "Tate: I mean, it's -- it's true. When -- when I got married, I was young. I was just coming up in the minors, and --",
        "Rex: You married impulsively, realized it was a mistake, and ended it. Wrong, wrong. Your sex-starved wife did.",
        "Layla: What's the fraud thing about?",
        "Tate: She definitely didn't divorce me because I'm gay.",
        "Adriana: Then why did she?",
        "Tate: Who cares? The rumor's out there because of your boyfriend, and now I have to spend the rest of my life denying it.",
        "Rex: You don't have to deny anything.",
        "Tate: Oh, sure, Rex. Women are going to be lining up to buy exposed underwear modeled by a gay man.",
        "Adriana: You turned our ad campaign into a joke.",
        "Layla: Everybody's going to think macho Tate is a softy.",
        "Rex: Hey, you can be macho and gay.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, like the village people.",
        "Adriana: You know what? Don't even try to defend yourself. You ended a man's career.",
        "Tate: Not to mention your girlfriend's.",

        "Jessica: But, Nash, we have to talk about the future in case something does happen.",
        "Nash: Nothing is going to happen to you.",

        "Jessica: No. I'm tired of people coming in here with their phony smiles and fear behind their eyes. I'm tired of everybody telling me that I'm going to be ok. Because maybe I will and maybe I won't. I'm the only one living in my skin, and I have to make these decisions for me and Bree while I still can, so you can either help me, or you can get the hell out.",
        "Nash: Nah, I tried that. I didn't like it. You don't want me to do that.",

        "Nash: Only when unavoidable.",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
