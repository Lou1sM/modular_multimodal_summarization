        "Cole: Starr, you know if I could fix this, I would. Starr, come on. Starr, what are you thinking about?",
        "Starr: Cole, nothing.",
        "Cole: No, talk to me, please.",
        "Starr: Okay, fine, Cole. I'm thinking about my dad, I guess.",
        "Cole: Okay, what else did he say to you?",
        "Starr: He kept calling me his little girl, and it really freaked me out because I've always been his little girl, and it's crazy how one night can just change everything.",
        "Cole: Do you wish we didn't do what we did?",
        "Starr: No, of course not. Okay, I'm sorry for my dad because his little girl is gone. And we can never go home and have a normal life because my dad will always see you as the guy who took his little girl away from him. And by him calling me that, by him begging me to come home and be his little girl -- it really hurt me.",
        "Cole: You want to be that little girl again? Just for tonight?",

Oh, and Davidson -- Viki Davidson. I owed everything I had and everything I was to that broad and the winning scratch-off ticket she gave me. Sure, it was only worth a buck, but that ticket was my key to a world whose door had been slammed in my mug countless times before. Vicki's ticket gave me the life I always wanted. For a while.",

        "David: I knew they were mad, and I couldn't really blame them, but it wasn't my fault. Now, let's pause for a moment. I need to give you some back story. I'm a modest man. I'm not comfortable talking about myself. But you need to know a little bit about my most recent past. You see, as soon as Viki gave me that scratch-off lottery ticket, my luck began to change. Guess who got a call from a casting director? This guy. Last time she called me, she wanted me on her couch. Who can blame her? But this time she wanted me in a cast, and not the plaster variety, no -- no. Let me show you a little something. She cast me in my very own television program. That's me, David Vickers, television star.",
        "David: Huh. Suddenly, I was welcome from Hyde to the Playboy mansion. I owed it all to that lottery ticket. I never let it out of my sight until the day I waded into Hugh Hefner's pool with Miss January and Miss July. It was just supposed to be a quick dip, but one thing led to another, and another, and another, and another, and another, and another. When I went back to get my clothes, the ticket was gone. Apparently, I searched one bunny too many, because I was unceremoniously banished from the mansion. I mean, wait -- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Thank you, I'm not done. [Stuttering] What are you -- But the show must go on, so I showed up for work the next day. The show was supposed to be called \"The Pursuit of Happiness.\" But I called it \"The Supermodel Crime Club.\" That's when I saw it. My show was shut down. Someone was on strike. I don't know who. All I knew is that I was out of a job, with a dozen maxed out credit cards and no lucky ticket. A ticket that had come from Paris, Texas. I had a good idea -- get back to Texas and find another lucky ticket. I also had a bad idea -- steal someone's hog to do it.",

        "Moe: You're going to pay for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: It is true. I was about your age when I got pregnant with Cassie.",
        "Langston: And you had your baby.",
        "Dorian: But there were two significant differences between the two of us. One -- I was completely on my own. And two -- back then, abortions were illegal. If I had made that decision, I would have been taking my life into my own hands.",
        "Langston: I can't imagine what that must have been like.",
        "Dorian: No, you can't. And a great many women died, painfully. But thank heaven, you have got options now. Dr. Morrison -- oh, she has a wonderful reputation, and she's staying after hours to see you.",
        "Langston: I can't go tonight. I have an exam in the morning.",
        "Dorian: You see? You are so serious about your studies. That's what is important to you. Sweetheart, at least talk to Dr. Morrison. I n assure you, I just want to be certain that you have the best shot at reaching for as high as you dream. Oops, we have to go. Come on.",

        "Blair: I'm sorry. I guess I was channeling Todd.",
        "John: Yeah, well, you made a hell of an impression on that guy. Who knows? Maybe -- maybe it was good. You know, a cop asking questions is one thing. Then there's a concerned mom. I think you got through to him, and if he sees anything he's going to call.",
        "Blair: So, what now?",
        "John: We canvass the boardwalk, we ask around.",
        "Blair: I don't know, John, I think we maybe need to --",
        "John: Get you something to eat. What do you think?",
        "Blair: I don't have an appetite. You think I can eat right now?",
        "John: Hey, let me tell you something. You're going to be no good to Starr if you don't keep yourself strong. Okay? So, I don't know, what do you say?",
