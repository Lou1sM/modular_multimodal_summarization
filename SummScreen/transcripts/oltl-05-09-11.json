        "Tess has a dream that reveals she may have feelings for Robert and miss both him and baby Ryder. But when she awakens to Cutter, she wants to hide that all and move forward with their plans to mess around and take the money. Yet he senses she may have married him to stick it to Robert Ford as he married her to stick it to Aubrey. He reveals that he is losing his faith in Aubrey and angry with her for what appears to be feeling she has for Joey and wanting to raise a baby with him. Robert goes to see Aubrey and Joey and informs them that Joey's sister has married Aubrey's \"brother\". Joey is not happy with Robert but graciously lets him see his son. Joey and Aubrey are both sensitive to Robert's need to be a father to his child and do not seem to dislike him. And it seems they may be growing closer to each other. Cutter then comes by and furiously admits to Joey that he married Tess to get his hands on the Buchanan money. Marty believes that she has gotten back with John when she overhears that he wants to be with Kelly and still has feelings for Natalie yet she is not in the picture for him. So when Kelly goes to John's home to plan their evening together, Marty gets there first and looks like she might have some insane plan with the woman who has \"taken\" John from her. Natalie finally concludes that she will listen to the tape of Marty revealing her secret to Dr. Buhari. She grows closer to Brody as he has lost Jessica similarly to how she has lost John. She finally plays the tape and hears Marty reveal that Natalie did not get pregnant by another man and that she only wanted them to believe that so that she could break John and Natalie up."

        "Ford: Aw, Ryder loves it when Mommy tickles him like that, doesn't he? Yeah. He does.",
        "Tess: Almost as much as I love tickling him, and I do love it, everything about this. I love being a family.",
        "Cutter: Have a little nap there, Mrs. Wentworth? You have a nice dream?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "James: Bobby, what's wrong?",
        "Ford: Tess. That's what's wrong!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: You were talking in your sleep.",
        "Tess: What did I say?",
        "Cutter: I couldn't really tell. It was kind of mumbly, but it must have been some dream.",
        "Tess: It was a nightmare.",
        "Cutter: Didn't sound that way to me.",
        "Tess: Well, I'm wide awake now.",
        "Cutter: Uh-huh.",
        "Tess: What's the matter? Are you worried that Brody and Ford are gonna come and crash our honeymoon?",
        "Cutter: I don't see them.",
        "Tess: Well, then, why don't you come to bed? Let's make this more than a marriage of convenience.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Aubrey, how hot should the--",
        "Aubrey: Shh shh shh. He's finally asleep.",
        "Joey: Oh, thank you.",
        "Aubrey: I know. Oh, I thought it would never happen. I'm going crazy.",
        "Joey: I know.",
        "Aubrey: I think Ryder is having a hard time adjusting.",
        "Joey: Yeah. I know. He probably just misses Ford, maybe even Tess.",
        "Aubrey: It's gonna take him a while to get used to us.",
        "Joey: Yeah. You're not sorry you volunteered us for temporary custody, are you?",
        "Aubrey: No. No, not on your life. I'm not sorry for anything I've done with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, if you're looking for a scoop on Delgado's shooting your boss, he's not talking.",
        "Kelly: I didn't come here for a scoop. I came here for this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: No, no, Cole. You don't have to worry. I'm doing much better. Yeah. My therapist says that I'm making excellent progress. Mm-hmm. Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, and here's the best news. John and I are back together. I know. I know. I was surprised, too. I was surprised, too, but I think he finally realized what I've known all along, that we belong with one another.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Ok, Marty. What did you do that was so bad, you don't want anyone else in the world to know? Forget the high road. I am going to listen to every single word that psycho Marty said to her therapist. She didn't want the wrong person to hear it? Well, too damn bad.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Brody: I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Natalie: Brody.",
        "Brody: I didn't mean to startle you.",
        "Natalie: No. Don't worry about it. What's wrong?",
        "Brody: Tess married Cutter Wentworth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I was picking up my phone to have Tess committed when she clocked me over the head.",
        "James: Are you ok?",
        "Ford: I'm fine. That was nothing compared to what happened next.",
        "James: Why? What happened?",
        "Ford: You're gonna love this. She went straight over to Cutter Wentworth's, had our marriage annulled, and married him.",
        "Starr: All in one night?",
        "James: You got to be kidding me.",
        "Ford: What can I say? She works fast.",
        "James: God, I thought your Vegas wedding happened at warp speed.",
        "Ford: Yeah. Tell me about it.",
        "James: Well, I mean, hey, anyway, at least you finally got rid of her, and all you had to do was threaten to put her away, not exactly bad news, right? You're free.",
        "Ford: Yeah, free.",
        "Starr: At least Tess won't be hitting on James all the time.",
        "James: I'll second that. All right. Come on, Bobby. I know it sucks that you lost custody of Ryder, and I know you miss him--I do, too--but you've got to be glad that she's somebody else's problem now, right? Bobby?",
        "Ford: I don't want to talk about it anymore.",
        "James: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Bobby, you didn't have feelings for Tess, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: I don't think going to bed right now is the best idea.",
        "Tess: Really? I think it's brilliant.",
        "Cutter: For all I know, Brody and Ford are outside just waiting for the right moment to break the door down.",
        "Tess: Well, let them break it. It's not like those two idiots can send me to St. Ann's. Now only my dear, sweet, loving husband can get Jessica the help she desperately needs. Those two can't do a thing. You, on the other hand, you can--",
        "Cutter: I would love to do quite a few things to you, but I don't want to get caught literally with my pants down.",
        "Tess: Really? Has nothing to do with the fact that you're still in love with Aubrey, does it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I can't get over how crazy you are about our nephew.",
        "Aubrey: Are you kidding me? What is not to be crazy about?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Well, he is pretty great, you know, but to be honest, I didn't even think you wanted to have kids. On the day we went to go visit Ryder and Liam in the hospital after they were born, I could've sworn I cornered you into saying that.",
        "Aubrey: No. Ok. At the time, I admit, I really hadn't thought about it very much, but this is different. When we were sitting at that custody hearing and the judge wouldn't give Ryder to your mother or to Ford and Tess, and he was just gonna turn him over to foster care just like that, I had to do something.",
        "Joey: That's why I love you. I love that about you.",
        "Aubrey: We are that baby's family now, Joey, and no child should be without loving parents. It's just not right.",
        "Joey: No, honey. I get that, but, Aubrey, where is this coming from? Did something happen to you when you were a kid, something that made you stand up in that courtroom and beg the judge to let us take Ryder home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Mm. Ok. Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?",
        "Kelly: Nothing we haven't done before.",
        "John: Yeah, but we can't.",
        "Kelly: Why? Why? You afraid Bo is gonna come in? Come on. I'll lock the door.",
        "John: Listen. Shh shh. This is not about Bo.",
        "Kelly: Why? Why? Come on. You got a crazy schedule. We can do it at your place if you don't want to do it here. It's no problem.",
        "John: Listen to me. Hey, this is not about us, is it? You're dealing with something else, and you're trying to escape.",
        "Kelly: Oh, my God, am I that transparent? Oh, come on. What difference does it make? We're both trying to get over people that hurt us. Isn't that why we're doing whatever this is we're doing?",
        "John: You know, I think we're way past hooking up to try to get over other people. I like you. Maybe you like me a little, and maybe we mean a little more to each other that either one of us cares to admit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Ok, honey. I'll tell John you said hello. I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: And then Tess knocked Ford out and ran over to Cutter's, and somehow they managed to get her marriage to Ford annulled in time for them to get married.",
        "Natalie: So he can't commit her.",
        "Brody: No. He was about to. He was ready to call when she knocked him out.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, Brody.",
        "Brody: How is Jessica ever supposed to come back if she can't get help?",
        "Natalie: We're gonna convince Cutter to do it.",
        "Brody: I don't think it's that simple.",
        "Natalie: Well, wasn't Cutter with Tess the last time that Jessica fought her way out?",
        "Brody: He was. There was another time I found them together. He said he was just trying to see if he could get Jessica to come out again.",
        "Natalie: So? Maybe that's what he's trying to do now.",
        "Brody: Don't think so. I was wanting to give the guy the benefit of the doubt, but you should've seen him last night, Natalie. He was so smug. The guy doesn't give a damn about Jessica, and I'm sure he doesn't care about Tess, either.",
        "Natalie: So why did he marry her?",
        "Brody: Have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Listen, Tess. The reason that I am not sleeping with you right now has nothing to do with Aubrey.",
        "Tess: Oh, pbbt, of course not, and I'm sure you're not at all wondering what her reaction is gonna be when she finds out that I'm your lawfully wedded wife.",
        "Cutter: I'm assuming it will be similar to my reaction when I found out that her and Joey got custody of your kid.",
        "Tess: Jessica's kid, not mine.",
        "Cutter: She's supposed to be in and out, smash and grab. No. She's been married to him for months now.",
        "Tess: Oh, I'm sure she doesn't have any real feelings for Joey.",
        "Cutter: She's supposed to be helping me rob his family, not start one with him. That was never part of the plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: I don't really like to talk about my childhood.",
        "Joey: I know, all right, but look, Aubrey, right here, ok? I want to hear about it. I love you. I want to be closer to you, ok? Don't you want that, too?",
        "Aubrey: Yes. I do.",
        "Joey: Ok. So what happened? What made you so determined to keep Ryder out of foster care? You come from a good family, right? At least I know that much about you.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, yeah. You're right. My family was well-off, but, um, good would be a different story. Uh... I'm sorry. My mom just...",
        "Joey: It's ok.",
        "Aubrey: Wasn't around very much. I mean, she just wasn't around me, so a nanny raised me, and she didn't like me very much.",
        "Joey: Aubrey--",
        "Aubrey: No. It's ok. Really, it's not that big a deal, ok? It's just, I was just alone a lot.",
        "Joey: Yeah, but what about Cutter? Didn't you guys grow up together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You're still in love with Aubrey so when she wanted to get custody of Jessica's kid with Joey, you got your hurt on. Oh, my God, who knew a cold- hearted con man could be such a softie?",
        "Cutter: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Tess: Come on. We both know that you rushed me to the altar just so you could stick it to Mrs. Joey Buchanan.",
        "Cutter: So what if I did marry you to get a rise out of Aubrey? You only married me to stick it to Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: How could I have feelings for Tess? She's--ooh! She's impossible.",
        "Starr: Yeah, not to mention she ruined your chances with you and Langston.",
        "Ford: Exactly. Now I've lost Langston and my son because of her.",
        "James: So what, then? You're upset about Cutter and Tess?",
        "Ford: Joey said that he'd give Ryder back to me if I had Tess committed...",
        "James: Ok.",
        "Ford: But since I'm not her husband anymore, I can't really do that now, can I? That's why I'm upset, because I lost my leverage, not because of whatever you said.",
        "James: Oh, ok, ok, but Joey and his wife only have temporary custody. You're Ryder's biological father, plus you're good at it, you know? Actually, your chances of getting Ryder back now are better without Tess around.",
        "Ford: Ok. All right.",
        "James: Bobby, come on, man. She clocked you on the back of the head. You were gonna have her locked up. You couldn't stand her.",
        "Ford: Ok. Yes. Tess is nuts. She's obnoxious. She's the most obnoxious, most in-your-face person I've ever met in my entire life. No woman I've ever been with has known exactly what buttons to push, and, believe me, she loved pushing them.",
        "James: So you won't miss her.",
        "Ford: I--I miss my son. I haven't seen him all day, and I feel like it's been a year, and being around here isn't helping me at all.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Cutter lived with our dad.",
        "Joey: So you guys didn't grow up together.",
        "Aubrey: My dad never really wanted a girl, so Mom got me in the divorce, but she was always traveling, to where, I'm not really sure. Anyway, the most important thing is that Ryder has us now, and he is never gonna feel alone or unwanted.",
        "Joey: And neither will you, all right, not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: This is so stupid. I'm an adult. I don't know why it's so hard for me to put Joey behind me, and at least what we have would have a better shot. I get angry when I think about Aubrey and Joey playing house with Ryder.",
        "John: I think it's only temporary, if that makes you feel any better.",
        "Kelly: It doesn't.",
        "John: You know, I think I know how you feel. You know, when I see Natalie and Lovett and they're with Liam--",
        "Kelly: It's hard for you to put it past you. I know.",
        "John: Yeah. It's there. It runs pretty deep, and it's gonna be there for a long time.",
        "Kelly: So how do we stop from feeling this way?",
        "John: I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I don't think doing it on the desk is gonna solve any of our problems.",
        "Kelly: Ha ha ha! Oh, you're right. Then how about we hook up later?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ryder fussing]",
        "Aubrey: Oh, come on. Don't look at me like that. I wasn't completely lying to your Uncle Joey, you know? So I didn't have a nanny, but I did know what it felt like to have no one want me.",
        "Joey: Ford.",
        "Ford: Joey, hi.",
        "Joey: Did you commit my sister?",
        "Ford: No. I haven't put Tess away.",
        "Joey: Why not?",
        "Ford: Because we're not married anymore. She had it annulled last night.",
        "Joey: Really? Well, see, that's great news. Now my parents can commit Tess to St. Ann's.",
        "Ford: No. It's not that simple.",
        "Joey: Why not? Oh, God, don't tell me that Tess just took off.",
        "Ford: No. She's still around. In fact, she's with her new husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ford? Please. I can't stand that guy.",
        "Cutter: Yeah, right. I saw how worried you looked when you thought you killed him.",
        "Tess: I was worried that he was still alive.",
        "Cutter: You called to check up on him.",
        "Tess: To make sure he was dead.",
        "Cutter: Right. So you wouldn't have to feel anything for him.",
        "Tess: Uh, hello? The guy wants to have me locked up. He wants me to disappear so Jessica can come back.",
        "Cutter: Look. I don't care why you married me, just like you don't care why I married you, and I'm sure you'll get Ford's attention, just like I know I'm gonna get Aubrey's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: New husband? She married someone else already?",
        "Joey: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Aubrey: Who would marry her?",
        "Ford: Your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ford is history, but you're here right now all alone with your brand-new wife who's totally hot for you, and up until last night, you were pretty hot for me, too. Amazing how quick that thrill wore off. Must be some sort of record.",
        "Cutter: I'm hot for you, ok? I already told you, I don't think it's a good idea right now.",
        "Tess: Yeah. I know, and I don't care. What I do care about is, if you're not gonna put out for your wife, how you gonna make it up to me?",
        "Cutter: What did you have in mind?",
        "Tess: We're broke. We're living in this skeevy motel room, and since you're still hurting over Aubrey...",
        "Cutter: Like you're hurting over Ford...",
        "Tess: Let's find some way to ease the pain. You're a con man and a thief. Find us somewhere better to live than this crap hole and better than that rat hole that I had to live in with Ford and his brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I actually feel bad for Ford. I know what it's like to have Tess mess with your life and kid.",
        "James: Wait. Tess did something to Hope?",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah. Yeah. She did. For months, I thought Hope was dead because of Tess.",
        "James: What? What happened, Starr?",
        "Starr: Jessica and I had our babies on the same day, just like Jessica and Natalie did, and Jessica's baby died, and Tess or one of Jessica's alters switched her dead baby with Hope.",
        "James: Oh, my God, Starr. Starr, I'm so sorry.",
        "Starr: It was one of the worst times of my life, but, you know, that day that I got Hope back, it was the best day of my life.",
        "James: Yeah, but all that time thinking she was dead, Starr--",
        "Starr: No, James. I don't want you to get upset about it or feel sorry for me because I got Hope back. Hope is ok.",
        "James: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Now that Deanna is out of our hair, we'll be ok, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You know, I still have your key that I swiped from Roxy.",
        "John: Sure you want to be saying that to a cop?",
        "Kelly: Ha ha! Oh, I'll risk it. We never did have that dinner, remember?",
        "John: Yeah. I remember.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, because you blew me off for Marty. So how about it? Unless you're planning to blow me off a second time for Marty. You don't need to see her again tonight, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: We found Tess at Cutter's motel room. It was just so strange. There I was, with one of Tess' husbands on my right and the other one on my left, and there she was, looking so much like Jessica, and all I could think about was when I was standing up there at the altar with her about to make her my wife. She was supposed to be my wife.",
        "Natalie: Brody, I am so sorry.",
        "Brody: When I look into her eyes, I think I can see Jessica there, and she's so close, but I just can't reach her, and now with Tess and Cutter in charge, what chance does Jessica have? What if she never comes back?",
        "Natalie: I know how you feel. I mean, John is still John, obviously, but he's with Kelly...or Marty, if you want to believe her insanity. Guess it doesn't really matter who he's with. He's not with me.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Jessica is so far gone, I mean, she's never been more lost to me.",
        "[Liam crying on monitor]",
        "Brody: The baby.",
        "Natalie: I'll go get him.",
        "Brody: No. It's ok. I'll get him.",
        "[Crying continues]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: No. I'm not seeing Marty tonight, and I am not blowing you off again. Never, I promise.",
        "Kelly: That is a relief. You know, if you want to skip dinner and just, you know, jump to dessert, I can do that. We can do that. I'm very good with sweet things.",
        "John: Oh, are you?",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm. Yes. Just don't pull your gun out on me this time, all right?",
        "John: I'll try to keep it holstered tonight.",
        "Kelly: Ok. Oh, and we will not breathe a word about Joey or Aubrey or Natalie or Marty Saybrooke. Ok. I'm not gonna let that bitch keep me, scare me away from being with you, ok?",
        "John: You're not?",
        "Kelly: No. No way.",
        "John: Get out of here.",
        "Marty: Heh. Think I'm a bitch now, wait till you see me later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Little man here wanted to see his mom.",
        "Natalie: Oh, hey, there's my little boy.",
        "Brody: Yeah. There you go.",
        "Natalie: Come here. Is that new?",
        "Brody: Well, yeah. I saw it at Logan's. I couldn't resist. Hey, Natalie, about what happened before, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.",
        "Natalie: Oh, yeah. No. Me, neither. It's like it never even really happened.",
        "Brody: Yeah, absolutely. Never happened because it shouldn't have.",
        "Natalie: Exactly. You love Jessica.",
        "Brody: I want her back more than I've ever wanted anything, and I know you want the life you were hoping for with John.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, I think it would take a miracle for John to come back to me, but at least you and my sister still have a chance.",
        "Brody: I hope so.",
        "Natalie: You know, my grandpa always had a saying--never bring a knife to a gunfight. If Tess tries to run, then you have to block her, but if she comes at you with both barrels, then you got to fight her back with a cannon. I mean, you can't think of her as Jessica, and most importantly, you can't give up on her, because you never know what's gonna happen. Sometimes you have to do whatever it takes, even if it means breaking the rules.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Uh, we had a deal, ok? I don't tell Joey that Aubrey is the Bonnie to your Clyde, and in return, I get half the Buchanan money that she's supposed to steal.",
        "Cutter: I remember the deal.",
        "Tess: Really? What about Aubrey? Because it sure as hell doesn't look like she's stealing money. It looks like she's playing Mommie Dearest with her new hubby, and Joey is gonna gun you down with the rest of the Buchanans. Literally since we got married, you are Buchanan enemy number one, and I'm a close second, ok? Everybody hates us. So what are you gonna do about it?",
        "Cutter: I got it covered.",

        "Ford: Look. I'm sorry about all this.",
        "Joey: Yeah, right.",
        "Ford: No. I am. I told you, right after you left, I had the phone in my hand. I was ready to commit her to St. Ann's when all of a sudden, she clocked me over the head and went off to see Cutter. Now, I don't know how he did it, but somehow he got our marriage annulled and married her.",
        "Aubrey: Excuse me. I'll give my brother a call.",
        "Ford: Uh, so how's Ryder?",
        "Joey: Actually, he had a pretty rough night. You know, I think he misses you.",
        "Ford: Is he ok now?",
        "Joey: Yeah. He's fine, ok? Actually, he's pretty great.",
        "Ford: Maybe it would be possible if I could see him for a minute?",
        "Joey: Listen, Ford. Honestly don't think that's gonna make things any easier.",
        "Ford: Please. Look. I know you don't owe me anything, and I didn't do right by your sister.",

        "Starr: What--what are you talking about? When were you lying?",
        "James: Before when I said we were alone. I totally jinxed us, and Bobby came flying in.",
        "Starr: Don't scare me like that. I thought it was more serious.",
        "James: I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: Well, look around. There's no Tess, no Ryder, and no Deanna, and Ford doesn't want to be anywhere around here right now.",

        "James: That is truly a miracle.",

        "Cutter: Like she did me when she took in that kid and got all cozy with Joey. I'm going out.",
