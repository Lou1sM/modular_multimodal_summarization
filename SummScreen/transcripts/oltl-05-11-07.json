        "Marty: Who is it?",
        "Miles: Miles Laurence.",
        "Marty: Hi.",
        "Miles: Hi. Is this a bad time?",
        "Marty: No. No, come on in.",
        "Miles: For you.",
        "Marty: Oh. Well, thank you, Miles. They're beautiful.",
        "Miles: I stopped by the office. Your secretary said you weren't coming in today. Are you sick?",
        "Marty: Oh, no, no. I was down at the high school.",
        "Miles: Oh. I guess you won't be needing this -- chicken soup. I thought you were sick.",
        "Marty: Well, that's really sweet. You know, Cole -- Cole and I will -- will have it for -- for dinner tonight.",
        "Miles: How -- how's he doing? Is he ok?",
        "Marty: Yeah, better than me. Huh.",
        "Miles: Oh. God, I'm sorry. Who do therapists talk to when then need therapists?",
        "Marty: Uh -- we have our shrink hotline. Yeah. Well, you look very nice, Miles. Are you going out?",
        "Miles: I have a date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, come on in, Bo.",
        "Bo: Got a minute?",
        "John: What's up?",
        "Bo: The arson case.",
        "John: Any news?",
        "Bo: Nah. But I thought maybe a fresh set of eyes might help.",
        "John: Sure.",
        "Bo: Take a look at that. It's a copy of a letter that we received from the hate group that we think is responsible, so -- well, maybe you can see something that -- that we missed. What's with this cassette? Bad tunes?",
        "John: Well, actually, it may be related to Manning's disappearance.",
        "Bo: You going to send it to the lab?",
        "John: Yeah, maybe they can get something from it. As it is now, Manning seems to have disappeared without a trace.",
        "Bo: Hmm. You know, in a perfect world, he'd probably never come back.",
        "John: Yeah, but Blair probably won't stop looking for him till she finds him.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I heard that she went to Chicago again.",
        "John: Yeah, she hired a local P.I. for him to help her.",
        "Bo: But not Balsom?",
        "John: He was there, but apparently he came up empty.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, you know, he's a good kid, most of the time. He's pretty good at what he does.",
        "John: Yeah? So why didn't Blair take him back with her?",
        "Bo: I don't know. But I think he has other things on his mind right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: If Tate's not gay, why'd you get divorced?",
        "Adriana: Please don't answer that. It's none of his business.",
        "Rex: The marriage ended years ago. What's the big deal?",
        "Tate: Oh, man, you just don't give up, do you?",
        "Rex: Yeah -- you started it when you hit on my girlfriend on national television.",
        "Adriana: He didn't hit on me.",
        "Rex: No, he only jumped off a chair on \"The View\" and swore his undying love for you.",
        "Tate: Yeah, and you got your revenge, Balsom. You probably would have jumped up and down on a couch in your club if you had one, telling the whole world I was gay.",
        "Paula: Which he's not.",
        "Rex: Then tell me why he's a fraud.",
        "Paula: Do you want to tell him, or shall I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Come on, tell us, damn it. Does my daughter have Hepatitis C, or not?",
        "Michael: Bree's test results came back negative.",
        "Jessica: Oh, thank God.",
        "Michael: She's going to be fine.",
        "Viki: Thank God.",
        "Clint: Oh, that's great, honey.",
        "Jessica: I can't believe it.",
        "Nash: See? There's nothing to worry about.",
        "Antonio: What about Jessica? Do you have any good news for her?",
        "Michael: Before we can fully assess Jessica's condition, we need to biopsy the liver. Well, now that the fever's subsided, we can do it.",
        "Viki: Well, when?",
        "Michael: It's been scheduled for later today.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Will she have to go into surgery?",
        "Michael: No. No, it can be done right here in the room. The risks are minimal.",
        "Viki: Wow.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Nash: Thank you.",
        "Jessica: Guys, cheer up. Bree's fine. That's all that matters.",
        "Natalie: Not quite.",
        "Jessica: I'll be fine, too, Natalie, don't worry. Um -- you think maybe Bree's hungry?",
        "Nash: Yeah. I'll go feed her.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Antonio: I'm going to go call my mom, check on Jamie -- let her know Bree's doing ok. All right? Can I get you anything?",
        "Jessica: No, I'm fine, thank you.",
        "Antonio: All right.",
        "Natalie: Honey, we'll let you get some rest.",
        "Clint: You yell if you need us, all right?",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Viki: How are you?",
        "Jessica: How are you?",
        "Viki: I asked first.",
        "Jessica: Oh -- hmm -- not bad.",
        "Viki: Why don't you tell me the truth. Sweetheart, it's not your fault.",
        "Jessica: I -- oh. I shot up Heroin.",
        "Viki: No, you did not. Tess did that.",
        "Jessica: Tess is me.",
        "Viki: No, Tess is not you. You cannot blame yourself for this. You cannot.",
        "Jessica: I just don't understand why I couldn't have stopped her. Why I couldn't have been stronger.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart -- sweetheart, you can't beat yourself up over this. And you can't change the past.",
        "Jessica: I'm hurting everybody.",
        "Viki: No, you are not hurting anybody except yourself if you keep looking backwards. Baby, you've got to concentrate on getting better and living a happy, healthy life with Antonio and his two girls.",
        "Jessica: What if that doesn't happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So, you have a date tonight? That's wonderful.",
        "Miles: You mean it?",
        "Marty: Well, of course. So, who is she?",
        "Miles: Oh, no one you know.",
        "Marty: Oh, no, I'm -- I'm sorry, it's none of my business.",
        "Miles: No, I -- I just -- I don't want to jinx anything.",
        "Marty: Well, I'm really happy for you, Miles.",
        "Miles: Well, I just wanted to make sure that you and Cole were ok.",
        "Marty: We are. Thank you. Actually, did you end up talking to anyone down at the police station about what you know about Todd's disappearance?",
        "Miles: Not yet.",
        "Marty: You know, John McBain is working on the case. You should talk to him, you know? Or Commissioner Buchanan. You know, show them the letter.",
        "Miles: I don't think there's anything in that letter that could help them.",
        "Marty: Isn't that for the police to decide?",
        "Miles: You think I'm protecting Spencer.",
        "Marty: I know he was your friend.",
        "Miles: He wasn't the man I thought he was.",
        "Marty: And that bothers you.",
        "Miles: Yes, it does. I mean, am I really that screwed up that I can't see the real Spencer?",
        "Marty: Miles, he showed you a different side. You had no reason to believe he was anything but a friend.",
        "Miles: How do you know when someone's lying to you?",
        "Marty: Well -- well, it's not easy. Some people are better liars than others.",
        "Miles: Then how do you know you can really trust me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: \"Cease your investigation, or be lumped in with the rest of our enemies who are threatening the future of a pure white America.\"",
        "Bo: Hmm. The feds faxed me a list of white supremacists that might be on their \"most wanted\" list.",
        "John: Any of them seem right for this?",
        "Bo: Well, I don't -- maybe, but the problem is there are no fingerprints on the original.",
        "John: What about the paper it's printed on?",
        "Bo: It's paper you can buy at any office supply store anywhere in the country. You know, these jerks are being real careful.",
        "John: Yeah, well, whoever wrote this -- they ain't that smart, Bo.",
        "Bo: Hey -- ahem -- do you think Manning is in real trouble?",
        "John: Chicago police found a large amount of his blood and they have to go on that assumption. This tape was found in his last known location. Oh, maybe there's some sort of connection.",
        "Bo: This looks like somebody stomped on it deliberately.",
        "John: Whatever's there, somebody didn't want it heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: No, I'll do the honors. So, the nasty details behind our divorce -- are you ready?",
        "Adriana: Tate, don't do this.",
        "Tate: Well, it's no bombshell. Like I said before, Paula and I got married very young. We were too young to know ourselves, not to mention each other.",
        "Adriana: Yeah. That can happen.",
        "Tate: We were lucky. We had no children to be worried about, so the split was fairly quick and painless. I didn't lie when I said I had never been in love before.",
        "Adriana: Happy?",
        "Rex: You know, it sounds like irreconcilable differences, not fraud.",
        "Tate: What -- what are you, a divorce lawyer now?",
        "Rex: Fraud is when you intentionally deceive someone, causing them to suffer.",
        "Tate: Your point?",
        "Rex: What were you lying about? Is your ex-husband a fraud or not?",
        "Paula: He was.",
        "Rex: How?",
        "Paula: He made promises he couldn't keep. He married me under false pretenses.",
        "Rex: I knew it!",
        "Adriana: What pretenses?",
        "Tate: When I asked Paula to marry me, she didn't say yes at first.",
        "Rex: Right, because she was suspicious of your sexual orientation.",
        "Tate: Because she was worried about what life would be like if I made it to the majors.",
        "Rex: All those naked guys in the locker room --",
        "Paula: All the women outside the locker rooms. Girls loved Tate.",
        "Tate: I was like a kid in a candy store. The more there was on offer, the more I wanted.",
        "Adriana: You cheated on your wife?",
        "Rex: Wait -- funny, I -- I call that infidelity, not fraud.",
        "Adriana: Give it up, Rex.",
        "Rex: No, not until I get something that sounds like the truth.",
        "Paula: I was angry. He lied, he cheated.",
        "Tate: Paula has a temper.",
        "Paula: Which exploded when I found another woman's underwear in my bed.",
        "Tate: You see? I'm not as good of a liar as you think I am.",
        "Paula: First, I flipped out on Tate. Then I called a lawyer, said \"my husband's a fraud. I want out.\"",
        "Rex: You didn't fight it?",
        "Tate: By that time, I wanted out as much as Paula did, so I hired my own lawyer. End of story.",
        "Rex: Not quite.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Of course I trust you.",
        "Miles: Yeah, but you're trained to have good instincts with people.",
        "Marty: I'm not always right.",
        "Miles: Neither am I.",
        "Marty: Because of Spencer?",
        "Miles: Maybe he used me to lead Todd into a trap.",
        "Marty: When something's bothering you, you need to ask yourself if you did everything you possibly could to deal with it. And if the answer is yes, then you have to let it go.",
        "Miles: And if the answer's no? Then you need to figure out a way to fix it.",
        "Miles: Sounds easy.",
        "Marty: Well, it's not. But it works. So, is there something more you could do?",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Then you need to go for it.",
        "Miles: I will.",
        "Marty: Ok.",
        "Miles: Thanks.",
        "Marty: You're welcome. And, hey, have fun on your date tonight.",
        "Miles: And you take it easy. Looks like you could use some sleep -- not that you look tired or anything.",
        "Marty: Thanks for your concern.",
        "Miles: That's what friends are for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You will get better, sweetheart. I promise you that.",
        "Jessica: How can you promise me that?",
        "Viki: Because I know you, and I know how strong you are.",
        "Jessica: You make it sound like I'm superwoman or something.",
        "Viki: You are. You are superwoman.",
        "Jessica: Oh --",
        "Viki: And you'll be home very soon.",
        "Jessica: Wherever that is.",
        "Clint: I should call Kevin and Kelly, let them know the good news.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I -- I'll go call Joey. But first, I need to get some coffee.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Natalie: Do you want anything from the cafeteria?",
        "Clint: Just your smile.",
        "Natalie: Oh. That'll be easy. I won't be long.",
        "Clint: Ok.",
        "Nash: Hey. How's Jessica?",
        "Clint: She's ok. She's talking with her mother.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Clint: That is just one beautiful little girl you got in your arms there.",
        "Nash: Yes, she is. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.",
        "Clint: I doubt it, Nash.",
        "Nash: You wish she was Antonio's.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, no. Then she wouldn't be who she is. I wouldn't change that for the world.",
        "Nash: Yeah, that's clever. Still, you wish I weren't here.",
        "Clint: Well, what I want doesn't matter. It's up to Jessica, and she wants you here.",
        "Nash: For Bree.",
        "Clint: And for herself.",
        "Nash: You know, no matter what you think, sir --",
        "Clint: Look, son, this is complicated, but one thing is simple. I will always do the right thing for Jessie.",
        "Nash: So will I. I promise you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: How's Bree?",
        "Antonio: The doctor gave her a clean bill of health.",
        "Talia: That's terrific. Yay. I'm so glad.",
        "Antonio: Did you get anything off that letter?",
        "Talia: The lab ran it over with a fine-tooth comb and they found nothing.",
        "Antonio: I should go down there.",
        "Talia: No. Nobody expects you back to work until Jessica goes home.",
        "Antonio: You know, I don't know who's worse -- the guys lighting those fires or the guy who shared a needle with my wife.",
        "Talia: I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.",
        "Antonio: You still have those contacts at the NYPD?",
        "Talia: Are you crazy? What do you want me to do, ask New York's finest to bust every club in Manhattan looking for the guy?",
        "Antonio: Somebody's got to pay.",
        "Talia: You can't fix this. You got to let it go.",
        "Antonio: And how am I supposed to do that?",
        "Talia: Make peace with what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Jessie? Did something happen between you and Antonio?",
        "Michael: Jessica, Viki -- this is Dr. Strichtner. She'll be performing the biopsy.",
        "Viki: Oh. How do you do? Um -- well -- well, I'm going to get out of here. I'll be back in a little bit, ok? I love you. Excuse me.",
        "Jessica: Let's see how bad this really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Have the lab put a rush on this, will you, Thompson?",
        "Ofc. Thompson: Sure.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Bo: Maybe you'll get lucky.",
        "John: Yeah, maybe. You know how this works. The longer this goes on, the less likely it is that Manning's alive.",
        "Miles: Todd can't be dead.",
        "Bo: Didn't know you cared, Laurence.",
        "Miles: Well, it's my fault he's missing.",
        "John: Yeah? Why is that?",
        "Miles: Spencer wrote me a letter. I didn't receive it until after he was dead.",
        "Bo: Do you still have it?",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Oh. \"I have something of the utmost importance to confide in you. It's about a man named Todd Manning. You will hear that I tried to hurt this man. If I did, it was because he deserved to be hurt, just as you deserved to be helped. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end. Todd doesn't deserve the truth, that -- that his son is still alive. 70860707. Your one true friend. Spencer.\"",
        "Miles: Yeah. See, I thought the numbers were a code to where Todd's son was.",
        "Bo: So you told Manning?",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "John: Blair said he thought the numbers were a zip code or something in Chicago.",
        "Bo: Do you have any more of these letters from Truman just lying around anywhere?",
        "Miles: Huh -- no, that's -- that's the only one.",
        "Bo: All right. Well, thank you for bringing this in, ok? And if we have any questions, we'll give you a call.",
        "Miles: Ok. Hey, can I get that letter back when you're done with it?",
        "Bo: Well, I can't tell you exactly when that'll be.",
        "Miles: No, I understand. I hope it's helpful.",
        "Bo: Ok. Thanks again. All right, let's have this analyzed, make sure that it's Truman's handwriting.",
        "John: Ok. I'll fax it to the Chicago Police Department, see if they can make anything out of these numbers.",
        "Bo: Ok, let me know if there's anything I can do.",
        "John: All right. I'd better take a look at Truman's files while --",
        "Bo: The case is closed.",
        "John: Maybe not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: We agreed to keep quiet about our reasons for splitting up.",
        "Paula: It was prohibited in the divorce papers.",
        "Rex: Why would you need a gag order?",
        "Paula: Tate knew he was about to become famous. He wanted to protect me.",
        "Tate: So we decided it was better to keep our mouths shut.",
        "Rex: In other words, you're not telling.",
        "Paula: Am I free to go?",
        "Rex: You're not under arrest.",
        "Paula: It sure feels like it.",
        "Tate: I'll walk you out.",
        "Paula: If you come near me again, I'll sue you for harassment.",
        "Adriana: Satisfied? Hello? Earth to Rex!",
        "Rex: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: The junkie that infected Tess with a needle may have infected others.",
        "Talia: Ok, without a name or a description, you're not going to be able to stop him. Looking for someone to blame is not going to make your wife better.",
        "Antonio: I don't have to look for someone to blame. I know who's responsible.",
        "Natalie: Hey. How's Jess doing?",
        "Viki: Well, they're -- they're just about to do the biopsy.",
        "Natalie: So what exactly are we hoping for again?",
        "Viki: Well, we're hoping that the virus hasn't done any damage to the liver. And that it can be stopped before it does.",
        "Natalie: And the worst?",
        "Viki: The worst -- she could have cirrhosis. She could have liver cancer.",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Antonio: Excuse me for a sec.",
        "Talia: Take your time. I'm going to go check in with the station.",
        "Antonio: Talk to you for a minute?",
        "Clint: Antonio, you know, I don't think so.",
        "Nash: It's all right. You know what? You want to play with your granddaughter for a minute?",
        "Clint: I never say no to that.",
        "Nash: There we go. I got a diaper bag. You really want to start another fight now, here?",
        "Antonio: I don't want to fight you, Nash, I want to thank you.",
        "Viki: And when your mommy comes home, I'm going to take both of you to see the ocean.",
        "Clint: Ooh.",
        "Viki: Because your mommy loves the ocean.",
        "Natalie: I think she likes the idea.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I think she likes the idea of her mama coming home.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Mom?",
        "Clint: What's the matter?",
        "Viki: I'm so grateful that she's all right, but what about Jessie?",
        "Natalie: Mama, she's going to be fine. And we'll make sure that the enemy keeps away from her.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Clint: And you think the enemy is Nash, huh?",
        "Viki: Yes -- in a way, yes.",
        "Clint: Well, I think he's doing a damn good job helping her to cope.",
        "Natalie: Tell that to Antonio.",
        "Nash: Thank me? What for?",
        "Antonio: For saving Jess.",
