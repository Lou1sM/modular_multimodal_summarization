        "Powell and Rebecca are ready to kidnap Jack and Starr when Todd, Blair and Tea are unconscious on the floor. They have Jack call Starr before she comes home to give her a story about how she won't find them there when she gets home. She finds that fishy. But she is more focused on wondering what to do with Cole and the fact that Langston is ready to sleep with Markko after the prom and Dorian has gotten wind of it. Lola is still obsessed over Markko and not ready to give up on him even though her father encourages her to find another boy and realize that Markko is not hers. Clint, Nora and Bo all admit their issues involving the fact that she is dating her ex husband's brother and that while dating Clint, she and Bo are getting closer. Rachel encourages Matthew to attend the prom regardless of his circumstances."

        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Bo: I had an impulse to kiss you. You know, if Marcie hadn't shown up and started yelling by the car --",

        "Starr: Yes.",
        "Langston: Okay, after the prom tonight, Markko and I, we're going to go all the way.",
        "Dorian: Not if I have anything to say about it.",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian --",
        "Dorian: Planning to go all the way?",
        "Langston: That was just a euphemism.",
        "Dorian: A euphemism for what?",
        "Langston: For the last dance.",
        "Dorian: Don't you lie to my face, young lady. You're planning to have sex with Markko tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: Welcome to -- Markko Rivera.",
        "Markko: Mrs. Burns -- you work here.",
        "Mrs. Burns: I get a great discount. But it's so good to see you. We missed you at church on Sunday.",
        "Markko: Yeah, you know -- finals.",
        "Mrs. Burns: I had a long talk with your mother. She says that since you got that nice new girlfriend, you spend all your time studying and that you've gotten into some wonderful colleges. She's so proud. Now what can I get you?",
        "Markko: Nothing. You know, I was -- I'm just looking.",
        "Mrs. Burns: I bet I know why you're here.",
        "Markko: You do?",
        "Mrs. Burns: Your mother couldn't stop talking about how tonight was your big night. So, are you here for supplies?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Matthew, look.",
        "Matthew: So are you going to go to the prom tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What happened to our open and honest relationship?",
        "Langston: We -- we have one.",
        "Dorian: Oh, really? Operation deflower?",
        "Langston: How do you know about that?",
        "Dorian: Lola just told me about it.",
        "Langston: Oh, I knew it. You rotten little bitch!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Mom? Dad? Mom. Mom! Dad. Dad! T\u00e9a, what happened? Why won't you wake up? Oh, my God. They're all dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: No, I'm not going to prom.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, me neither.",
        "Cole: So how you doing?",
        "Matthew: You mean the chair?",
        "Cole: Yeah, that.",
        "Matthew: Well, I finally stopped worrying about my grade in gym class. Have you ever seen my triceps? Because, you know, they're getting bigger. Dude, it's not that bad, really.",
        "Cole: Hi, Rachel.",
        "Rachel: Uh, did you need to talk to me about something?",
        "Cole: No, no. I came here to see your mom and Commissioner Buchanan.",
        "Matthew: You wanted to talk to my dad?",
        "Cole: Just did.",
        "Matthew: How'd that go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So, now what?",
        "Bo: I don't know. I guess we talk about happened.",
        "Nora: You mean what didn't happen.",
        "Bo: Yeah, okay. But we can't keep avoiding each other. Pretty soon we're going to run out of rooms.",
        "Nora: You know, we've always got the wine cellar.",
        "Bo: No, come on, Nora.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Bo: This is ridiculous. We're not teenagers, you know? We used to married for crying out loud.",
        "Nora: I know, you're right, you're right. We should be able to talk about this like two rational adults.",
        "Bo: Exactly.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Bo: So what the hell happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: You think I need supplies?",
        "Mrs. Burns: Like I don't know what happens on prom night.",
        "Markko: What happens?",
        "Mrs. Burns: Aren't you sweet? But you don't have to be embarrassed. I know what you want, and I can help you get it.",
        "Markko: I'm sorry, you do? You can?",
        "Mrs. Burns: Hey, I was a teenager once, too. Now where did I put them? I just finished restocking.",
        "Markko: No, Mrs. Burns -- Mrs. Burns, please, you really don't have to --",
        "Mrs. Burns: Aha. Found them. Here you go.",
        "Markko: Fresh strips?",
        "Mrs. Burns: Now you'll be minty fresh for your big make out session.",
        "Markko: Right. Minty fresh.",
        "Mrs. Burns: Totally. That's what you kids say, isn't it?",
        "Markko: Totally.",
        "Mrs. Burns: What's the matter, honey? Do you need something else? Oh, wait a minute. How could I be so stupid? You need rubbers, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Langston, don't -- don't blame Lola for anything. In fact, I'm grateful --",
        "Langston: You told Dorian that I'm sleeping with Markko tonight?",
        "Lola: I was worried about you.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? How did you find out? You been stalking us? Going through our stuff? Watching us?",
        "Dorian: Watching what?",
        "Langston: This must have just made your day, huh?",
        "Lola: What are you talking about?",
        "Langston: You knew that if you went running to Dorian that she'd try and screw things up for us and then you could have Markko all to yourself.",
        "Lola: I don't want him.",
        "Langston: Good, because he doesn't want you. He wants me. He's my boyfriend and I am sleeping with him tonight and there is nothing that you can do about it. Comprende?",
        "Lola: Good. Go ahead.",
        "Langston: And there's nothing that you can do about it, either. You can't stop this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Mom, please don't be dead. Wait, are you breathing? You're alive. Dad! Dad! You're okay! T\u00e9a! You're okay, too! Don't worry, I'll get you guys help. 911 -- Did they already call you?",
        "Powell: Did who call?",
        "Jack: My mom and dad. They're sick. You have to help them.",
        "Powell: Put the phone down, Jack. Right now.",
        "Jack: How do you know my name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You know what? I've changed my mind.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: I don't want to talk about this anymore.",
        "Bo: Hey, we --",
        "Nora: It's a non-issue, Bo.",
        "Bo: We almost kissed.",
        "Nora: We were worried about our Matthew and we were leaning on each other a little bit.",
        "Bo: And that's what worries me.",
        "Nora: Why does that worry you?",
        "Bo: We can't just lean on each other.",
        "Nora: Why not?",
        "Bo: There are a whole bunch of reasons, you know? The most obvious one -- you're with my brother.",
        "Nora: Exactly. I mean, why are we looking for trouble here? Haven't we had enough these last months for an entire lifetime?",
        "Bo: I agree with that.",
        "Nora: Okay, so can we -- we're down here, right?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to clear the air.",
        "Nora: Okay, consider it cleared.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: It was, uh, it was good to see your dad -- scary, but good.",
        "Matthew: He didn't break your kneecaps or anything?",
        "Cole: Well, I wasn't here to talk about the accident. It came up, but it was cool.",
        "Matthew: So what did you need to talk to him about?",
        "Cole: About Starr and me and our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm going to let you two talk, okay?",
        "Dorian: No, wait. Starr, I think you should stay for this.",
        "Langston: But she has nothing to do with this.",
        "Dorian: Really? Your cousin is a cautionary tale about the perils of underage sex.",
        "Starr: Well, this cautionary tale has homework.",
        "Dorian: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Starr: No, really, I do not want to talk about this tonight.",
        "Dorian: Why didn't you come to me about this?",
        "Langston: You're kidding, right?",
        "Dorian: No.",
        "Langston: Okay, Dorian. Here's the deal, okay? I love Markko and he loves me. We've been together for two years. We know what we're doing and this is happening tonight whether you like it or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Uh, nope, nope. I don't need rubbers.",
        "Mrs. Burns: Your mother would never let me hear the end of it if I didn't make sure you got some rubbers.",
        "Markko: My mother?",
        "Mrs. Burns: I hear there's a chance of rain tonight. There you go. Wouldn't want you ruining your fancy new shoes.",
        "Markko: Oh, rubbers.",
        "Mrs. Burns: Your mother told me what she spent on those shoes.",
        "Markko: Thanks, Mrs. Burns.",
        "Mrs. Burns: Oh, no problem. I can't wait to tell her I ran in to you.",
        "Markko: You know, you don't have to --",
        "Mrs. Burns: Oh, of course I do. She'll be so happy I helped you get ready for your big night. Now, will that be all or will there be anything else?",
        "Markko: No, that'll be all. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: So what about the baby?",
        "Cole: Well, we think there might be a mistake. You know, about how she died.",
        "Matthew: Man, I'm sorry.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "Matthew: You okay?",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's just, you know, a little weird having to deal with all this again.",
        "Rachel: Matt, can I talk to Cole for a second?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, sure.",
        "Rachel: Are you okay getting inside by yourself?",
        "Matthew: Remember? I left you in the dust.",
        "Rachel: How's it all going?",
        "Cole: We're just trying to find out what happened to our baby.",
        "Rachel: Is that it?",
        "Cole: Yeah. What else could there be?",
        "Rachel: Well, this is the first time you've seen Matt in his wheelchair, right?",
        "Cole: Yeah, it was.",
        "Rachel: Well, it looks like it went okay.",
        "Cole: Because of him. He seems like he's --",
        "Rachel: Like he's accepting what happened? Moving on with his life? He is, and that's a good thing.",
        "Cole: He shouldn't have to be moving on. I mean, he's like that because of me. I did that to him. [Phone rings] Sorry, it's my friend.",
        "Rachel: It's okay.",
        "Cole: Yeah, hey. What's going on?",
        "Markko: [Whispering] I need your help.",
        "Cole: I can barely hear you.",
        "Markko: I need your help. Can you come meet me?",
        "Cole: Are you okay?",
        "Markko: No, I'm, like, an inch away from total humiliation.",
        "Cole: Okay. Well, what's going on?",
        "Markko: Just come meet me, please.",
        "Cole: Okay, sure. Where are you? I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Powell: Jack, I know your name because they told me you needed help here.",
        "Jack: It's my mom and dad and my dad's friend. They're breathing but they won't wake up.",
        "Powell: Well, I'm here now so you don't need to call anyone.",
        "Jack: So you know what's wrong with them?",
        "Powell: Yeah, I know what's wrong with them.",
        "Jack: Then why won't they wake up?",
        "Powell: Well, because somebody hurt them. You know the bad man that hurt your mom and killed those other people?",
        "Jack: My dad thinks it's mcpain, but my mom says it's someone else.",
        "Powell: Who do you think it is?",
        "Jack: Aren't there supposed to be two ambulance guys? And why aren't you taking them to the hospital?",
        "Powell: Who do you think did this, Jack? Who do you think hurt your parents and their friend?",
        "Jack: You. It was you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Markko and I have been dating for two years.",
        "Dorian: It's such a clich\u00e9. Do you have any idea how many girls lose their virginity on prom night?",
        "Langston: We picked tonight because it's our anniversary.",
        "Dorian: If you think it's such a good idea, why did you keep it a secret?",
        "Langston: Because it's private. Lola ruined that, but she's not going to ruin tonight and neither are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Markko, what's going on?",
        "Markko: Dude, come here.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Markko: I know the lady behind the counter.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Markko: She knows tonight is the prom.",
        "Cole: Okay, so?",
        "Markko: So? She keeps trying to sell me fresh strips and rubbers -- the shoe kind, and telling me how much she talks to my mom.",
        "Cole: Oh.",
        "Markko: Yeah, right. And if I don't -- if I don't get the condoms, Langston is going to kill me. So will you please get them for me? Dude, please, please?",
        "Cole: Sure, no problem.",
        "Markko: Thank you. Thank you. I owe you big time.",
        "Cole: So, I guess this means you're sleeping with Langston after prom?",
        "Markko: Uh, yeah. Did I leave that part out?",
        "Cole: Kind of.",
        "Markko: Yeah, we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Say something, please?",
        "Dorian: I think you're very mature in many ways but I believe you are much too young for this. You're intellectually gifted, you have the potential to be a very fine writer --",
        "Langston: Dorian, I'm not going to get pregnant.",
        "Dorian: I'm sure that Starr did not intend to get pregnant.",
        "Langston: She made a spur of the moment decision because she felt that she was never going to see Cole again.",
        "Dorian: Is Markko going somewhere?",
        "Langston: No, Dorian. I'm not sleeping with Markko because he's pushing for it or because it's prom night or because we feel that we're never going to see each other again. I'm sleeping with him because I love him and he loves me, too. This is what we both want -- what we both decided, together.",
        "Dorian: Sounds very mature.",
        "Langston: I'm not a child any more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lola sighs]",
        "Ray: Mija, Starr told me there was trouble between you and Langston again.",
        "Lola: I just want to be alone.",
        "Ray: You can't keep doing this.",
        "Lola: Doing what?",
        "Ray: You promised me you were going to stop bothering Langston and her boyfriend.",
        "Lola: Why does everyone else in the world get to be happy but me, huh?",
        "Ray: You can be happy. You just have to find another way to do it -- a way that doesn't hurt these people.",
        "Lola: And how do I do that?",
        "Ray: Why don't you start with this?",
        "Lola: The school directory?",
        "Ray: Yeah. Look at all the boys in here in your school and stop focusing on the one you can't have.",
        "Lola: Do you hate me?",
        "Ray: Of course I don't hate you.",
        "Lola: Then why are you always trying to change me?",
        "Ray: I -- I blame myself for what has happened. I was away from you for a long time -- for too long. You needed to be loved. You started thinking somehow you should just take it.",
        "Lola: I just want a boyfriend. What's wrong with that?",
        "Ray: Nothing. You just have to find another boy. And mija, know -- in your heart, know, when you find him, whoever he is, will be the luckiest guy in the world. Hold on to that. You can do it. You can do it.",
        "[Lola sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You got a lot of homework?",
        "Matthew: Not really.",
        "Rachel: You okay about before? Seeing Cole?",
        "Matthew: It was fine.",
        "Rachel: So it's not homework and it's not Cole.",
        "Matthew: What?",
        "Rachel: Whatever is wrong.",
        "Matthew: Nothing is wrong.",
        "Rachel: On the drive home you passed up two burger joints and a taco stand. Something's wrong. You know what? It's okay if you don't want to talk about it.",
        "Matthew: The prom's tonight and I asked this girl. Don't get excited. She's just a friend.",
        "Rachel: There's no shame in asking a friend to go to the prom.",
        "Matthew: She said no.",
        "Rachel: Well, did she say why?",
        "Matthew: I know why. I've been a terrible friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Bo, I am very glad that we have cleared the elephant out of the room.",
        "Bo: Yeah. I'm sure it wasn't helping Matthew any.",
        "Nora: Uh-uh. And he's the most important thing.",
        "Bo: Exactly right. So now can we stop avoiding each other?",
        "Nora: Oh, for crying out loud -- come here.",
        "Clint: Is it possible for me to go one week in this house without seeing my girlfriend in the arms of my brother?",
        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Clint: Seriously, you two, am I missing something here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Powell: You think I did this to your mom and dad and to their friend?",
        "Jack: I don't know, but you're acting weird and -- Sam! Sam!",
        "Powell: It's okay, it's okay.",
        "Jack: Sam!",
        "Powell: Sam is fine, Jack.",
        "Jack: No, he's not! You're going to hurt us like you did my parents!",
        "Rebecca: No, we're not, Jack. You and your brother are perfectly safe.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Who are you? Give me my brother!",
        "Powell: Well look at that, Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Come on, Dad. I expect that you answer on the first ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Powell: Listen very carefully, Jack. You are going to do exactly what I say and no one gets hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay, Clint, you can't honestly be upset because Bo and I were hugging.",
        "Clint: Right now? Yes.",
        "Nora: Well, that's ridiculous.",
        "Clint: You think I don't know that?",
        "Nora: You do?",
        "Clint: Of course I do. You two are dealing with a crisis with your son -- that has brought you closer together.",
        "Nora: Well, then what's the problem?",
        "Clint: The problem is, can't you two get close without pushing me away? And I truly don't care if it's not intentional, all right? Because I am sick and tired of it. And I -- I freely admit I'm jealous.",
        "Nora: Well, then why didn't you say anything?",
        "Clint: What kind of a creep gets jealous at a time like this?",
        "Nora: Okay, well, then you know that there's nothing going on, right?",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Bo: You've got a point, though, Clint. Nora and I have gotten closer. Yeah, we were just talking about that.",
        "Nora: Okay, Bo, what are you doing?",
        "Clint: Look, Nora, Nora, let the man talk, all right?",
        "Bo: I don't want you to get bent out of shape.",
        "Clint: It's too late. I'm already bent out of shape. Now, what is going on with you and Nora?",
        "Bo: I almost kissed her the other day. Now, it's the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: So you asked your friend to go to the prom but she already has a date? And even if she didn't, she wouldn't go with you anyway because you said mean things to her.",
        "Matthew: I mean, I tried to apologize and everything.",
        "Rachel: This is great.",
        "Matthew: Why is this great?",
        "Rachel: Do you know how many people don't get to go to the prom with the person that they want?",
        "Matthew: So?",
        "Rachel: So, some of them aren't even in wheelchairs.",
        "Matthew: So you're telling me my life would suck no matter what?",
        "Rachel: Yep, pretty much.",
        "Matthew: Okay, I'll be in my room.",

        "Matthew: Sitting in a corner by myself -- I mean, what if it sucks, Rachel?",

        "Markko: I told you.",

        "Cole: Yeah, well, I changed all that when I started using drugs.",

        "Markko: What do you mean?",
        "Cole: Um, you know the drug test that you helped me out with?",
        "Markko: Yeah, because the EMT's gave you some pills after Zach knocked you out. Oh, no -- Cole, are you serious?",
        "Cole: Yeah, man, I totally used you.",
        "Markko: Why didn't you just tell me the truth?",
        "Cole: Because I'm an addict. And that's what addicts do -- we lie. And I'm asking you to forgive me. I know I have no right to, but I'm asking. And if you can't, I get it.",

        "Langston: The Palace.",
        "Dorian: And you're going 50/50 on that?",
        "Langston: Yep, even though he offered to pay for the whole thing. [Langston sighs] You know, I have health class, all right? And do you know why kids my age end up pregnant or with an std?",
        "Dorian: I'm a doctor!",
        "Langston: It's because they feel that planning it out in advance makes it dirty somehow -- bad. But I'm doing it my way because I know that it isn't wrong. So can we be done with the inquisition, please?",

        "Jack: He didn't really say anything. I just think that you can stay out until he tells you to come back. Okay? Starr, are you there?",
        "Starr: Yeah, can you put Mom on the phone?",
        "Jack: You want to talk to Mom?",
        "Starr: Yeah, put her on the phone, okay?",
        "Jack: Um -- I can't. Dad just came out of the kitchen and he's helping her into the car.",

        "Jack: We'll be at the movies.",
