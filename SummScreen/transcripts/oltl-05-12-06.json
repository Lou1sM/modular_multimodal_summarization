        "Kevin: Dr. Truman took Kelly into surgery.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank God.",
        "Spencer: All right.",
        "Viki: No, no, wait a minute. I mean, this is ridiculous. There's got to be other doctors.",
        "Spencer: Sorry.",
        "Viki: Somebody must be able to operate!",
        "Spencer: There isn't anyone else, and I don't have time to discuss this any further. I have to go. Excuse me.",
        "Viki: But this can't be happening. There has to be another way!",
        "Dorian: The tornado did so much damage to the roads, I'm sure if there was another surgeon here who could do the operation, they -- they probably weren't able to drive to the hospital.",
        "Viki: But, then, so what? You just pick who gets treated and who --",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry. Excuse me, I'm -- I'm -- I have to make a phone call.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God, Clint. I can't even imagine the hell that Kevin is going through. What's going to happen if Kelly lives and Duke dies?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Here we go.",
        "Margaret: Thank you.",
        "David: Somebody needs to turn the air conditioning on in this country. Let's sit over here.",
        "Margaret: Oh. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I don't know why we can't use my computer.",
        "David: For the same reason we can't go to your apartment -- I think somebody is following you.",
        "Margaret: Jeez, you make it sound so dire.",
        "David: It is.",
        "Margaret: Look, like I said before, I think you have me mixed up with someone else.",
        "David: No, I don't.",
        "Margaret: Ok. Well, then I guess I'll just allow you to prove yourself wrong. Now, what is it we're supposed to be looking for?",
        "David: Something to help you remember.",
        "Margaret: And what is it I'm supposed to remember?",
        "David: What -- what Spencer did to you, Margaret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What are you doing?",
        "Natalie: I'm going!",
        "Michael: And where is it you're going?",
        "Natalie: It's important. I need to help John.",
        "Michael: What could be so important to John?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, I need some flight information on flight 17 to Bangkok. Scheduled to depart on time? Thank you.",
        "John: Come on.",
        "Bo: I understand you're taking a leave of absence, John. Where you going?",
        "John: I'm going on a little business trip.",
        "Bo: What kind of business? If you don't mind me asking.",
        "John: Unfinished business with the man who murdered my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: All right, listen, everything is being made ready. Do not give up hope on Duke just yet, ok? Provided that everything goes well in the O.R. with Kelly, then there's no reason why I can't save him as well. The problem is with this type of trauma to the heart, sometimes the blood flow is very severely limited to the brain, ok? Needless to say, time is of the essence, all right? Orderlies? Get Ms. Cramer prepped and into the O.R. ASAP, and listen -- keep your eyes on Mr. Buchanan. Keep me apprised of any change in his condition. I also need to put a second team together -- got it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What are you planning on doing, Natalie? Were you going to hobble to John's defense, huh? Were you going to protect him with your crutch?",
        "Natalie: He -- he needs someone to calm him down.",
        "Michael: Well, what's he all worked up about this time?",
        "Natalie: About your father.",
        "Michael: Yeah, he hit a brick wall with the investigation. So?",
        "Natalie: Right. Yeah, yeah, and I mean, he's just -- he's been so upset, it's been eating him alive that he can't find the man who killed him.",
        "Michael: You know, Nat, I'm having a really hard time believing that you would risk tearing your stitches to hold my bro's hand.",
        "Natalie: He needs me.",
        "Michael: Yeah? This have anything to do with what happened at the wedding -- you interrupting my ceremony?",
        "Natalie: Oh, yeah, that. I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to, you know, make it that big of a deal.",
        "Michael: Well, what'd you say to him anyway? I mean, what could be so important that both of you missed my reception?",
        "Natalie: I guess I'm going to have to tell you the truth.",
        "Michael: Now, there's a novel idea.",
        "Natalie: I found out something last night, something that has to do with John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Do you hear yourself, John? He was your father. And Paige was negligent, and she covered her mistake at somebody else's expense, and that's been eating at her for years. She stepped down from her job. She may lose her license. We're just scratching the surface of the legal ramifications of all this.",
        "John: You and Paige still together?",
        "Bo: No. No, we're not. She moved out.",
        "John: Bo, you're my friend. I hate that any of this involved you --",
        "Bo: No, no. You've got to do your job. John, I'm just asking.",
        "John: Well, I'm just telling. I turned over my files, every file I had on my dad, to the Atlantic City P.D. -- everything. It's out of my hands now.",
        "Bo: Then you must've figured out who shot your father.",
        "John: It's out of our jurisdiction.",
        "Bo: Well, that concerns me even more.",
        "John: Well, like I said, it's not your problem, Commissioner.",
        "Bo: What about Natalie? I mean, can -- can she still care?",
        "John: You going somewhere with this?",
        "Bo: Well, I heard that you're a hero again. Is she ok?",
        "John: I'm no hero. Natalie's a little beat up, but you know Natalie.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, I do.",
        "John: I got a plane to catch.",
        "Bo: She's my niece.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "Bo: You know, this has been a tough year for you, hasn't it?",
        "John: You're batting 1,000 boss.",
        "Bo: No, no, I just want you to think about it, ok? Everything seems to be coming together for you now professionally, but all of a sudden, you want to take a leave, you want to go who-knows-where to do who-knows-what.",
        "John: Point being?",
        "Bo: Your father was killed a long time ago, John. Now, is what you're about to do worth risking everything that you care about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: Rise and shine, Manning.",
        "Todd: What's going on?",
        "Guard: You're free to go.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Guard: The woman got you out. You're a free man.",
        "Todd: Evangeline?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Dorian! What -- what -- what's going on? What happened to Kelly?",
        "Dorian: Kelly's been injured.",
        "Blair: Well, is she all right?",
        "Dorian: No, she's not all right. Dr. Truman is preparing her for open-heart surgery. And --",
        "Blair: Open heart surgery?",
        "Dorian: Yes, we've got Kevin Buchanan to thank for all of this.",
        "Blair: What are you talking about? I saw Kevin last night, and he was worried sick about Kelly.",
        "Dorian: Yes, of course he was worried because he knows that -- oh, dear God. If she dies, if she doesn't -- why am I -- why am I even saying this? Why are you even letting me think this way? Please, of course -- of course Kelly's going to be all right because your dr. Spencer Truman is going to be the miracle worker that you ink he is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Why'd you do it? I mean, Kelly and I, we -- we've hurt each other many times, but you -- you never let me down, you never, ever betrayed me, until now. I know that I wasn't a -- a great dad. But I loved you, and I would've given you the world. This is how you repay me. I mean, you're my son. You're the only son I will ever have. Oh, God. I hope it was worth it. I mean, do you -- did you really love her that much or do you just hate me that much? Oh, man. Hey? Why did you do it, Duke? I just -- I just need to know. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So what'd you find out?",
        "Natalie: Well, it -- it happened at the ceremony. I discovered something -- I mean, totally by accident.",
        "John: Let's keep what we know about Vickers between us for now.",
        "Michael: Yeah? What'd you discover?",
        "Natalie: I discovered that I was mad at John.",
        "Michael: Wow. There's a discovery.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, it -- it was just taking me to the totally wrong place, and, you know, the last few months have been horrible for John and -- almost getting kicked off the police force and nearly dying in a plane crash --",
        "Michael: Natalie, he's my brother. You want to tell me something I don't already know?",
        "Natalie: Well, it made me realize that I still have feelings for him. You know, seeing you and Marcie getting married -- I don't know. Something just snapped. You two have overcome so much.",
        "Michael: Well, that is true.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. And I realized I was living a lie, and I had to tell him.",
        "Michael: Wow. You picked a heck of a time to do it.",
        "Natalie: What can I say? I'm a redhead.",
        "Michael: Guess I'd have to agree with you on that one.",
        "Natalie: Anyway, I don't want to waste any more of my life. I want to be with him.",
        "Michael: Are you sure that's all you had to tell me?",
        "Spencer: Michael, I need an assist in O.R. Three. Could you scrub in and meet me there, please?",
        "Michael: Right away. You're not getting out of here without my approval, so don't even try it, ok? Feel better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Will it be worth it in the long run?",
        "John: He killed my father.",
        "Bo: What about Natalie?",
        "John: What about her?",
        "Bo: Well, how does she feel about this?",
        "John: I believe she understands.",
        "Bo: Well, obviously this guy is not right down the block, is he?",
        "John: No.",
        "Bo: Do you know exactly where he is?",
        "John: I have a rough idea.",
        "Bo: Is he in this country?",
        "John: I'm sorry, Bo. That's all I can tell you.",
        "Bo: What are you going to do when you find him, John?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Wait, it says \"no internet connection.\" What kind of internet cafe can't connect to the internet?",
        "Margaret: Calm down.",
        "David: Well, is this an internet cafe or not? You said the red squiggly letters said \"Internet Cafe.\"",
        "Margaret: Look, this is Thailand. That happens all the time. You just got to get used to it. I mean, sometimes they're down for days.",
        "David: No. I don't have days.",
        "Margaret: Ok. Take a deep breath. Sometimes they're up and running in a few minutes. Who knows? I mean, it's not going to kill anybody if we wait for a few minutes.",
        "David: Uh-huh. Don't be so sure about that.",
        "Margaret: What do you mean?",
        "David: Nothing.",
        "Margaret: Ok, then let's just wait. Maybe you could tell me about this mysterious man who is supposed to be the father of the baby I supposedly had. Hmm? He must've been madly in love with me. What was his name again? Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I knew you'd come through for me. And I knew you'd get me out of here.",
        "Blair: I'm not the one.",
        "Todd: Of course you are. You'll always be the one.",
        "Blair: I'm not the one who got you out of jail, Todd.",
        "Todd: But you're here, and they s me free, and you love me.",
        "Blair: That's the problem, Todd -- it hurts too much to love you.",
        "Todd: Wait. You can't go.",
        "Blair: I have to.",
        "Todd: What are you going to do? You going to go back to Spencer? Blair, can't you see? He's the killer. He's more than dangerous. You got to believe me.",
        "Blair: How can I?",
        "Todd: You can't stay with him.",
        "Blair: What am I supposed to do, Todd -- go back to you? You'd never forgive me for the things I've done. You never forgive anyone.",
        "Todd: That's not true. That's not true. I'll forgive you. If you didn't get me out of here, who did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Spencer, I know that we have had our differences in the past, but I trust that you will put all of that aside and just concentrate on saving Kelly's life.",
        "Spencer: That is my full intention, Dorian.",
        "Blair: Dorian, if anyone can save Kelly, it's Spencer. Come on.",
        "Spencer: Thank you, Blair. I will do everything I can, Dorian. I promise you.",
        "Dorian: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Listen to me -- Kelly is going to be fine. Ok?",
        "Dorian: Yes. Excuse me. I'm -- I'm going to try Adriana again.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Spencer: Blair, I -- I'm so glad you're here. I mean, for her, for your aunt, for Kelly, for me. It just -- it means a lot to me.",
        "Blair: Of course.",
        "Nurse: Doctor? She'll be ready in about three minutes.",
        "Spencer: I'll be right there.",
        "Blair: You know, I know I've had my issues with my family, but in times like this, I realize just how important my family is, and I know that you've had your share of problems with David, but I also know if he really needed you, that -- that you would be there for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm just going to make sure justice is served, that's all.",
        "Bo: \"Justice\" -- that's a word with a broad base of definitions, isn't it?",
        "John: Well, what's the point of being a cop if you can't execute some justice?",
        "Bo: Yeah. And we are cops, but we're not judge and jury.",
        "John: Maybe I don't have as much faith in the system as you do.",
        "Bo: I don't believe that for a second.",
        "John: Do you know what it's like, Bo, to have the man that killed your father walking around free?",
        "Bo: No. No, I don't, and I wouldn't even pretend that I did, but I do know what pain and anger can do. It can warp a man's perception, even a good man -- especially a good man.",
        "John: Bo, I've never seen things clearer. I know what I have to do, and I'm going to do it.",
        "Bo: Well, you see that's where I disagree with you, because this has been festering in you, your father's death, since you were a little kid. Now, when I lost my son, I had my own definition for \"justice.\" I was thinking with my heart and I was ignoring the badge, but you -- you've finally turned a corner here, John. I don't know -- maybe it's -- maybe it's because of Crosby.",
        "John: No, it's definitely not Crosby. Don't say that.",
        "Bo: But you still never answered my question about justice. Now, is this guy going to come back here and stand trial or are you the only one who knows what's really going to happen to him? You mean you haven't tried honey bunches of oats yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Did everybody make it ok through the storm? Mom? Did somebody get hurt? Mom, who? Tell me!",
        "Viki: Um -- Duke is -- is actually hurt, and -- and Kelly's hurt and Antonio, too.",
        "Natalie: How badly?",
        "Viki: We don't really know for sure right now, but you know what? They're all being tended to, and you just need to worry about yourself, ok?",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "Viki: So did John come by?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Yeah? And is everything ok?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I think so. I mean, you know John.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm actually a little bit more concerned about what's going on with you.",
        "Natalie: I think we're back together.",
        "Viki: And so why do you look unhappy?",
        "Natalie: I don't know, mom. I mean, it's still really new.",
        "Viki: Well, you and John have never exactly sailed on the calmest seas, have you?",
        "Natalie: Hey, we've had our ups and downs. Who hasn't?",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. Most relationships are not hinged on the life-and-death situations that you and John have put yourselves in. And I think I would not be a very good mother if I didn't tell you I'm very worried you could find yourself in danger again.",
        "Natalie: But it's ok. It's all good, mom. This time it's going to be different. I'm not waiting for John to come and save me. It's my turn to save him.",
        "Viki: You're going to save John?",
        "Natalie: That's right.",
        "Viki: From what? I mean, what -- what does he need salvation from, and, honey, do you really want to play this role in the relationship -- that of savior?",
        "Natalie: He's reaching out to me, mom. Or I thought he was.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart --",
        "Natalie: Mom, you've got to understand with John. He -- he's always been this guy who's kept to himself, doesn't need anybody until now. And this can't be easy for him.",
        "Viki: Oh, I'm sure it's not.",
        "Natalie: I can't let him down.",
        "Viki: So your mind is made up?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Yeah, ok.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I mean, I know this is a good thing -- I know it.",
        "Viki: Boy, you are becoming quite the Buchanan, aren't you? You're just as stubborn as the rest. Honey, I'm going to go and see what's going on, and I'm going to come back and check on you later, all right?",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "Viki: I love you.",
        "Natalie: Love you.",
        "Viki: And do me a favor and just do what the doctors say, ok?",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "Viki: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Don't you worry. I'm sure I'm going to figure out the right thing to do.",
        "Bo: And when will that be?",
        "John: Hard to say. Probably be when I finally look my father's killer in the eye.",
        "Bo: And then what? John, look, I know that you're looking for peace, but seeing this guy face-down in the dirt -- it's not going to give it to you.",
        "John: Maybe not.",
        "Bo: All right. As your boss, I have to remind you that you're still on the Llanview P.D. roster, and if you go somewhere and you get yourself in a mess outside the law, then internal affairs will hear about it.",
        "John: Give it to me straight, boss. You going to try to stop me from going?",
        "Bo: No. No, I've always backed you up on this, John. He was your father, and I'm not going to try to stop you.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Bo: But I will stop you from leaving this office with a gun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: What kind of a father am I? I mean, I'm supposed to protect my son. Forgive him. You know, when they were clearing away the debris, and I saw him there with Kelly, I didn't see my son. I saw a man who had stabbed me in the back.",
        "Dorian: Spencer.",
        "Spencer: Yeah?",
        "Dorian: Have you given her the tracheal intubation yet?",
        "Spencer: She's prepped and ready to go.",
        "Dorian: Answer something. What do you honestly think her chances are?",
        "Spencer: Well, she's young, she's strong. I think her chances are pretty good, you know? I mean, it all depends on what I find once I get in there. Look, even though I developed this technique, I've only really performed it once.",
        "Dorian: Dare I ask what happened to that patient?",
        "Spencer: Well, they were under different circumstances.",
        "Blair: Look, we have faith in you, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: Pay very close attention to this procedure, Dr. Mc Bain. If we had another surgeon in this hospital who could perform this operation, we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.",
        "Nurse: We're getting a drop in pressure, doctor.",
        "Michael: I think we're looking at a tension Pneumothorax.",
        "Spencer: 10 cc's Milrinone.",
        "Doctor: And if she has a reaction?",
        "Spencer: She's not going to make it without it. Do you have another recommendation, doctor?",
        "Doctor: Milrinone.",
        "Spencer: Right. Thank you. Administer the drug, please.",
        "Dorian: Ohh. Oh, I wish I were in there.",
        "Blair: I know, Dorian, but Spencer is right. Kelly's strong. She's going to be fine.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please! Are you forgetting I was a doctor? I've said something like that a thousand times to helpless families when I couldn't tell them that their loved one was going to be all right.",
        "Blair: Have you ever thought that maybe Spencer is telling the truth? He's a renowned doctor.",
        "Dorian: Right. And Kelly does have that one thing going for her. She's your cousin. And that man -- that renowned doctor will do just about anything to get you to love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What are you doing here?",
        "Margaret: I'm here to save you, my love.",
        "Todd: You're dead, and you can't save anybody.",
        "Margaret: Oh, I'm so sorry things didn't work out the way planned. I never imagined in a million years that you would be executed.",
        "Todd: What really happened, Margaret? You know I'm going to die? I need to know what happened. What did Spencer do? If you tell me, I can tell Evangeline. And she can get me out of here.",
        "Margaret: Don't you ever listen? I'm the one who's going to save you.",
        "Todd: You're still nuts.",
        "Margaret: Oh, no, you can't leave me. I love you, and I need you. And you need me. More than you will ever know.",
        "Todd: Agh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Margaret you were in love with a man named Todd Manning.",
        "Margaret: Well, did he love me back?",
        "David: I know he had very strong feelings for you.",
        "Margaret: But how could I forget somebody that important?",
        "David: It didn't end well. You're starting to believe me, aren't you?",
        "Margaret: No. No, this man --",
        "David: Todd Manning.",
        "Margaret: Todd Manning. When we first met, you said that I was obsessed with him and that I held him prisoner in a cabin. I mean -- was I not a nice person?",
        "David: Sometimes nice people do not-nice things.",
        "Margaret: Well, you did something bad.",
        "David: Let's just say I know what it's like to have a mistake haunt you for the rest of your life.",
        "Margaret: Well, look, I may have forgotten my life, but you seem to be running away from yours. Aren't you?",
        "David: Yes, my brother.",

        "David: Spencer has been holding something over my head for many years. But not anymore, thanks to you.",
        "Margaret: Me?",

        "Bo: Yes, and I know that you can't carry a weapon on an international flight.",
        "John: Well, truth be told, I had no plans to. I was going to take it home and lock it up.",
        "Bo: Ah, well, then why don't you humor me. Give it to me. I'll lock it up here for you.",
        "John: Anything to make you happy, boss.",
        "Bo: One other thing that would make me happy is if you get in touch with the local authorities as soon as you get to your final destination, wherever that might be. And remember that I'm here for you, John. And I want you to call me if you ever feel like you're about to make a decision that you can never change again.",
        "John: I'll consider that.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "John: There is one thing you can do for me -- check in on Natalie?",

        "Clint: Kevin, it was an accident. What did you expect to do, stop a tornado?",

        "Clint: Let's just pray that both of them make it.",
        "Kevin: I just need some time alone with my son, please.",

        "Viki: Not really. I thought it better to be a little bit vague about it all.",
        "Clint: Viki, I hate this. I hate the waiting.",
        "Viki: You know, this family has had an angel watching over us many, many times. And I pray that angel's watching over Duke.",

        "Dorian: Cassie, this is your mother leaving yet another message. I -- there's a Crisis here in Llanview. I don't understand why none of my girls are calling me back! Please do.",
        "Blair: I was wondering -- how -- how come Kevin isn't here? I mean, did anybody even bother to call him to tell him what's going on?",
        "Dorian: I told you, he knows. All of this is his fault.",
        "Blair: Ok, ok. You know what? This is not the time or the place to go on your anti-Buchanan rant, Dorian. Come on.",

        "Blair: Yes.",

        "Dorian: Saying? Oh, yes.",
        "Blair: Was Duke hurt, too?",
        "Dorian: They're both in exactly the same condition.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. Oh, poor Kevin.",
        "Dorian: \"Oh, poor Kevin.\" Please, I really don't want Duke to die, but I'm having a lot of trouble mustering up any sympathy for Kevin right now.",
        "Blair: Oh, Dorian, how can you say something so awful?",
        "Dorian: Because I tried to warn Kelly time and time again that Kevin was bad for her. But would she listen to me? No. And now I just wish to God I had been wrong because she is in there now, fighting for her life. Tell me, when are my girls going to learn to stay away from these men who can destroy their lives?",
        "Spencer: All right, that's it. All right, close her up. Get Duke Buchanan prepped right away, please.",
        "Dorian: Well?",
