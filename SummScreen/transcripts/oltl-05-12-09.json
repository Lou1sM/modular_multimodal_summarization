        "Jessica: Okay, I think we're all set.",
        "Viki: Oh. I think it's very sweet of you to throw this party for your sister.",
        "Jessica: Don't kid yourself. Why do you think she made me her matron of honor?",
        "Viki: Don't you think it's time that you told her how happy you are? About you and Brody?",
        "Jessica: There is no me and Brody, remember?",
        "Viki: Honey, I'm not going to tell your secret, okay? But I do think she would understand.",
        "Jessica: Understand what? That I'm with the guy that Rex's girlfriend said that she slept with?",
        "Viki: It didn't happen, did it? And I think she'd rather hear that from you than from anyone else.",
        "Jessica: Mom, you said you wouldn't tell her.",
        "Viki: I'm not going to. But I have to warn you, secrets have a nasty way of coming out, especially in this town.",
        "Roxy: Hey, everybody! Nattie's in the house. Look at this place. I say, let's party.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Oh, I can't believe that my son's getting married and he's sharing it with me. You know, a few years back, I didn't think that was even possible.",
        "Jared: Thank you for putting this party together.",
        "Charlie: Oh, you know, that's the best man's job -- to do the bachelor party. I just hope it measures up.",
        "Jared: No big surprises, okay? Just a couple of buddies, a couple of beers -- excuse me. Brody? What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Brody: I work here.",
        "Jared: Since when?",
        "Brody: Since they put me back on the schedule when the owner left town. What's your problem?",
        "Jared: Look, um, Natalie and I are getting married. This is my bachelor party, which means Rex, my future brother-in-law, will be here. I don't think I need to remind you how he feels about the fact that you ruined his life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Sorry.",
        "Stacy: I just thought you'd be at Jared's bachelor party already. I'll hurry up and get ready for Natalie's party and be out of your hair. That was so sweet of you to give the girls the club tonight. You can turn around, by the way.",
        "Rex: Well, the bride is my sister.",
        "Stacy: Right. So where's your party?",
        "Rex: Rodi's.",
        "Stacy: Rodi's? With Gigi there?",
        "Rex: Jared made sure she was off tonight. Excuse me.",

        "Gigi: Working.",
        "Jared: No, Melanie's on tonight.",
        "Gigi: Melanie has the flu. Why?",

        "Dorian: Markko, don't you look handsome. Come on in. But then again, it is a very special night. May I take deflower?",
        "Markko: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You know, Lang, I am really happy for you. You are going to have a lot of fun at prom and you're going to have a nice private after-prom.",
        "Langston: I know. I can't wait. I mean, I'm glad I did. But I just wish that you and Cole were coming to the dance.",
        "Starr: We're in the middle of something.",
        "Langston: Is that why I couldn't find you today?",
        "Starr: It's nothing bad. We'll talk about it tomorrow.",
        "Langston: Oh, no, no, no, no. You are not leaving me hanging. What's going on?",
        "Starr: Cole and I are having Hope exhumed.",
        "Langston: What? You're digging up her body?",
        "Starr: We decided to do whatever we have to to find out why she died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: May I take the flower? What did you think I said?",
        "Markko: Is Langston ready yet?",
        "Dorian: Not yet. Shall we?",
        "Dorian: So are there going to be virgins at the prom?",
        "Markko: Excuse me?",
        "Dorian: Virgin Mary's? Virgin pi\u00f1a coladas? You know, drinks without alcohol.",
        "Markko: I -- I don't know what they'll be serving.",
        "Dorian: After the prom? Got any plans? A party, perhaps?",
        "Markko: There'll be parties, yeah.",
        "Dorian: You hear so much about prom night. Girls losing it --",
        "Markko: You know, don't you?",
        "Dorian: Operation deflower?",
        "Markko: That was a joke --",
        "Dorian: You call making love to my daughter for the first time a joke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. I've been so wrapped up in Markko and me, I completely haven't asked you what's been going on.",
        "Starr: Hey, you shouldn't be thinking about something so morbid. You should be happy.",
        "Langston: Starr, you're my best friend. I want to know. So, okay, you're going to open up her grave?",
        "Starr: We were hoping that we wouldn't have to. We brought the locket and had her -- we had the hair tested, you know, to see if it was because of some genetic factor. Langston, it turns out it wasn't her hair.",
        "Langston: The hair in the locket? Yeah, it was.",
        "Starr: Well, that's -- that's what we thought. But, uh, there must have been some mistake because it turns out that the DNA didn't match Cole or me. So now in order to get another DNA sample, we have to --",
        "Langston: You have to exhume the body.",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Langston: Okay, so assuming you find out why she died, then what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Lois says hi.",
        "Viki: Oh -- girls all right?",
        "Jessica: They are fed, bathed, and asleep.",
        "Roxy: So when are you going to start popping out kids of your own?",
        "Viki: Roxy, let's get through the party --",
        "Natalie: Uh, yeah. Jared and I, we want to have kids, just not now.",
        "Jessica: Well, you guys are going to make terrific parents. You're so wonderful with Bree and Chloe.",
        "Natalie: Thank you. Actually, that's what settled it for us. I mean, it was a lot of hard work, but we loved the kids, had so much fun.",
        "Jessica: You know, having kids is the most wonderful thing you can do. Feeling those little arms around your neck. I don't know where I would be without my children.",
        "Viki: Oh, God, I couldn't agree more.",
        "Roxy: Ix-nay on the baby talk.",
        "Marcie: Here's the bride. I'm so happy for you.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but I would have been happier if it was a double wedding. Jared and Natalie, and Rex and Gigi.",
        "Natalie: Don't say that tramp's name around here.",
        "Roxy: Who said anything about Stacy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'll see you later.",
        "Stacy: You going to come home drunk?",
        "Rex: I doubt it.",
        "Stacy: Thank you for getting me invited to Natalie's bachelorette party. I know that was all you.",
        "Rex: You're Shane's aunt. That makes you part of Natalie's life.",
        "Stacy: And your life?",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "Stacy: Oh, before you go. I've never actually been to a bachelorette party. So what am I in for?",
        "Rex: I mostly know bachelor parties --",
        "Stacy: Right, I know. The girl pops out of the cake, but what do the women do?",
        "Rex: Oh, my God. I totally forgot. I was supposed to book the entertainment. With everything going on, I totally forgot. What time is it?",
        "Rex: Where am I going to find a stripper in half an hour?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Bo, thank you for coming.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, so is your brother on the way?",
        "Bo: I wouldn't know.",
        "Clint: All right, how come we're not toasting my future son-in-law?",
        "Jared: That is a good question, best man.",
        "Charlie: Hey, I'm on the wagon, but what about you guys? Can I get you something?",
        "Bo: I'll have a beer. Thank you, Chuck.",
        "Clint: Bourbon.",
        "Charlie: Beer, bourbon. Anything for you, Jared?",
        "Jared: I'm good for now, thank you.",
        "Michael: Jared!",
        "Bo: You want to play some darts?",
        "Clint: I think we need to finish our conversation.",
        "Bo: I have nothing more to say.",
        "Clint: Not good enough, Bo.",
        "Bo: Look, nothing happened, Clint. I'm not getting into this.",
        "Clint: Do you still have feelings for Nora?",
        "Bo: Yeah, sure I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Stacy? No, I was talking about Gigi. You know, the slut who broke your son's heart by sleeping with Brody?",
        "Jessica: Who wants a drink?",
        "Roxy: You don't have to ask me twice.",
        "Jessica: Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Anything with a parasol.",
        "Viki: I'll have a Virgin Mary, sweetheart.",
        "Jessica: Nora?",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Jessica: Something to drink?",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah -- whatever Viki's having.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Natalie: I'll help you.",
        "Jessica: Thanks.",
        "Viki: You okay?",
        "Nora: Me? Oh, I'm fine.",
        "Marcie: How's Matthew doing?",
        "Nora: Um, he's at his prom.",
        "Viki: Oh, Nora.",
        "Nora: I know.",
        "Marcie: See? I told you he would be okay. I caught Bo and Nora in the high school parking lot spying on their son. Only, I thought it was two teenagers necking in the car. I mean, how funny is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So how many strippers does it take to screw in a light bulb?",
        "Jared: Apparently all of them, because there's nobody here except a bunch of dudes. I'd rather be home with you.",
        "Natalie: Aw. I want to be at home with you, too. But we have the entire Olympic swim team here in all their little trunks.",
        "Jared: Oh, well, you'd better behave yourself.",
        "Natalie: Or what are you going to do about it, tough guy?",
        "Jared: You keep talking like that, I'm going to have to meet you in the parking lot.",
        "Natalie: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. We've had enough bad luck, and I don't want to jinx anything.",
        "Jared: Seeing each other during the bachelor parties is a jinx?",
        "Natalie: I don't know, but I'm not going to take any risks -- not until we're married. I don't want anything to go wrong tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I don't get it. Why would Dr. Joplin give me someone else's hair?",
        "Starr: I don't know. All I know is that we need some answers.",
        "Langston: And you and Cole are doing this together?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: What about Schuyler?",
        "Starr: Oh, that's over. I helped Cole detox from his pills.",
        "Langston: You did?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: What was that like?",
        "Starr: Awful. The worst thing I've ever had to see a person go through, but he did it.",
        "Langston: For you.",
        "Starr: Okay, I don't know that. I just know that he's back to being Cole again, and my feelings for Schuyler were not real.",
        "Langston: Because you and Cole belong together.",
        "Starr: You and Markko belong together, and that's happening tonight. I can't believe it. I can't believe that Aunt Dorian is being so cool about all of this.",
        "Langston: Cool? She gave me protection. And it's French. I cannot believe that there are French condoms in here.",
        "Starr: Mais oui, mademoiselle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Dr. Lord, I love your daughter and I respect her and I would never do anything to hurt her. But we've been together a long time and we both want to do this. So please, please, don't get in between us and please don't go all Todd Manning and send Langston away -- because I know that you're better than that. And anyway, I'd follow her to the end of the earth. You know that. You can't stop true love, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: Are you finished?",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Good. Now it's my turn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Loud music playing]",
        "Natalie: Hey, stop texting Lois. The kids are fine.",
        "Jessica: I know. I know.",
        "Natalie: Okay, so let's go have some fun.",
        "Jessica: I am having fun.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, all by yourself here in the corner.",
        "Jessica: I'm not by myself.",
        "Assistant Manager: Sorry, we're closed for a private party.",
        "Man: I'm the entertainment for Natalie Buchanan's bachelorette party.",
        "Assistant Manager: Oh, okay. There's a room in back where you can change.",
        "Kyle: What's up? Want to make some real money?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I was totally sure I had two juniors skipping class to make out. Only, it was Bo and Nora. I'm going to go see what's keeping my parasol.",
        "Nora: We weren't making out. We didn't make out. Not making out. We were sitting in the car spying on Matthew. Just parked, but not parking. Not making out.",
        "Viki: Whatever you say.",
        "Nora: Oh, for God's sake, Viki. Bo almost kissed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So you admit that you have feelings for Nora?",
        "Bo: Clint, she's Matthew's mother. We've been through the wringer lately. Those are the kinds of feelings I'm talking about. I'm not still in love with her.",
        "Bo: Thank you. Charlie, let me ask you something. Do you ever feel threatened by the fact that Clint is still close with Viki?",
        "Clint: Of course he doesn't. He knows that there's nothing between Viki and me except friendship.",
        "Charlie: Well, now that you mention it, he has gotten in the habit lately of stopping by at odd hours, leaning on Viki.",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Bo: So it's okay for you to cry on your ex-wife's shoulder, but it's not okay for me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You want me to strip at Jared's party?",
        "Rex: I'll pay you double. Just one set.",
        "Rex: Forget it. You obviously want to go to Natalie's party. I understand you're still just making friends in town. It's cool. I got to go. I got to tell Charlie that I screwed up.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Stacy: Hello?",
        "Gigi: Put him on.",
        "Stacy: Sorry, he's not here.",
        "Gigi: Let me talk to my son.",
        "Stacy: He is hanging out with these two people named Moe and Noelle. Poor thing. He is so broken-hearted because his mommy had an affair. It's okay, don't worry about it, though. Rex and I will get him through it.",
        "Gigi: Go to hell.",
        "Stacy: Did you want to leave a message?",
        "Gigi: I have to get back to work.",
        "Stacy: Work? You're at Rodi's?",
        "Gigi: That's where I work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I cannot believe they make special holders for condoms.",
        "Langston: Well, that's the French for you. I mean, I think it's great. Every girl should carry protection. Who wants to end up --",
        "Starr: Like me?",
        "Langston: No, that -- I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: You know what? Come on. Let me help you with your hair.",
        "Langston: Okay. You know, I was thinking up, but Markko likes it down.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, then maybe we should \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You have been very supportive of Langston. You've been loyal to her, and I believe that you're sincere when you say that you love her.",
        "Markko: I am. I do love her with all my heart.",
        "Dorian: And while I do not condone your plan, you're right. There's nothing I can do to stop it.",
        "Dorian: However, this is big. This is going to change the way she feels about a lot of things. Don't let her down.",
        "Markko: I won't.",
        "Dorian: If you do, you're going to have to answer to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lola: Hola, amigos. It's me, Lola, and have I got something to tell you. The Dorian found out about operation deflower, and she's cool with it. She \"approves.\" She \"understands.\" And she gave them this. This is what the rich people tote their condoms in. Mm-hmm -- and it's silver. No. Stealing this is not going to stop them. But you know what? I just had a better idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I made a mess of everyone else's life, didn't I?",
        "Brody: Not Shane's. He's alive because of what you did.",
        "Gigi: Alive and miserable because I cost him his family. I've lost Rex. I've lost Shane. You have to sneak around to see Jessica because of me.",
        "Brody: It won't be forever.",
        "Gigi: You're right. It won't.",
        "Gigi: Michael, hi.",
        "Michael: Yeah, hey.",
        "Gigi: Do you have a minute?",
        "Michael: Of course, for you. What's going on?",
        "Gigi: Will there ever be a time when I won't have to worry about Shane?",
        "Michael: Why? Is he not feeling well?",
        "Gigi: No, no. He's doing great. I'm just wondering when I can stop holding my breath.",
        "Michael: Ah -- well, I mean, for now his tests are looking great. You know, it will be several months before we can start using the word \"remission.\"",
        "Gigi: Several months from when he got the transplant or from when we knew it had taken?",
        "Michael: From when we knew it had taken. But, I mean, try not to worry, you know, but -- if worse comes to worst, we always have Aunt Stacy around to take more stem cells when the need arises.",
        "Gigi: We can't, maybe, find someone else?",
        "Michael: Why would we want to do that with a perfect match on hand?",

        "Jared: Balsom, I was about to send out the search party.",
        "Rex: Gigi's here.",
        "Jared: Sorry, bro. Yeah -- apparently, she's covering for somebody.",
        "Rex: And Brody?",
        "Jared: Uh, yeah. John's out of town and the assistant manager hired him back.",

        "Charlie: Well, I didn't say that you were.",
        "Clint: And you -- stop changing the subject. The subject is you and Nora.",
        "Charlie: Look, all I'm saying is that maybe you could call before you drop by.",
        "Rex: Uh, Charlie, uh -- sorry, guys. Can I talk to you a minute?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, yeah. Thank God you're here. This party is tanking. You got the entertainment all ready?",
        "Rex: Yeah, about that --",
        "Charlie: Yeah, what?",
        "Bartender: It's showtime.",
        "Charlie: All right. I knew I could count on you. Listen up, everybody. Time to cut the cake, courtesy of Rex Balsom.",

        "Jessica: You heard Roxy?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but it's okay. I mean, I understand everybody's just trying to be sensitive, but I'm really okay. You know, Michael and I, we're back together and I've accepted that Hope is gone.",
        "Jessica: So did you guys ever find out what happened?",
        "Marcie: No, but Starr and Cole have decided that they need to know, so they're having the body exhumed so they can figure out what happened.",

        "Viki: So you and Bo --",
        "Nora: No, no. He didn't. We didn't. It didn't. It didn't, and it never will. It won't. It just -- we were in the car parked because we -- you know, it was Matthew's first day back at school, you know? It's ridiculous, huh?",
        "Viki: No, not so much, given the circumstances, at all.",
        "Nora: We were just talking, and Bo -- I looked at him. And suddenly, it hit me, it's just -- this is the only person in the whole world who gets what I'm feeling.",
