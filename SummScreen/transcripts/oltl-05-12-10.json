        "[Door clangs open]",
        "Todd: Yeah, you like it that way. I'm' sure that's why you're gonna dump Marty and go back with Natalie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Roxy: Hey, Natty! It's so good to see you.",
        "Natalie: Hey, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: So where you been hiding?",
        "Natalie: I wasn't hiding. I was in London.",
        "Roxy: London? Oh, jolly good. How was it?",
        "Natalie: It was great.",
        "Roxy: For real?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It was so good and I loved it so much that I'm moving there.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, right! Ha ha!",
        "Natalie: I'm serious. I--I fly back tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Shut up about my mother. You don't even say her name, okay?",
        "John: He will. And so will you. Ignore him and keep your mouth shut. Ignore him.",
        "Cole: Seriously?",
        "John: Yeah. You worry about your own case. Let me worry about Manning.",
        "Todd: Would you guys give it a rest? T\u00e9a's gonna have me out of here by dinner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a, Todd can wait, but what I have to say can't.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mind your own business, Blair.",
        "Blair: Look, I just overheard you tell that nurse that you were gonna skip out on your treatment!",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd is in lockup. I need to get him out. Dani can't deal with any of this. They need me right now, Blair.",
        "Blair: Oh, they need you? How are you gonna help anyone? That tumor has already scrambled your brains.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: And then he said that nothing happened between you two even though I didn't ask him if anything happened between you guys. And I don't know why he thought it was necessary for him to say that.",
        "Dani: Maybe because something did happen.",
        "Matthew: What?",
        "Dani: We--we kissed.",
        "Matthew: You kissed.",

        "Gigi: Locked box in a locked drawer. They must really want to keep what's inside a secret.",
        "Rex: Why? It's just about my parents, right? Two young people, pregnant, probably scared. I mean, what's with all the drama with the necklaces and lock boxes? I mean, come on, what could be so bad? It can't be worse than Mitch Laurence.",
        "Gigi: Maybe it's good.",
        "Rex: Okay, fine. My parents are billionaires. Then they wouldn't know how to take care of themselves and get rid of me if they had to. They wouldn't need a jewelry maker to run interference for them. Come on, why such a state secret?",
        "Gigi: Give it to me.",
        "Rex: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",
        "Gigi: Stand back.",
        "Rex: Gigi, you can't destroy property.",
        "Gigi: We've already broken and entered. You're worried about a box?",
        "Rex: All right, let me.",
        "Gigi: No. You're too upset. You'll break your hand or something. Stand back. Ah!",

        "Natalie: Oh, it's not that far.",
        "Roxy: Does Viki know this yet?",
        "Natalie: No. I haven't really told anybody.",
        "Roxy: Good, 'cause we're gonna nip this in the bud. I mean, that's just a cockamamie idea. What about the weather? You're gonna have bad hair days for the rest of your life.",
        "Natalie: Rox, I need a change.",
        "Roxy: Well, then I'll give you highlights. In fact, I'll give you a discount.",
        "Natalie: I want to be in London.",
        "Roxy: What does London have that we don't have in Llanview?",
        "Natalie: For one, my brothers. You know, Kevin and Joey and Cord, they all live there.",
        "Roxy: But, baby, your real family is here. Me and Viki and Rex and me--",
        "Natalie: And they have great culture and museums and good restaurants.",
        "Roxy: Honey, we are totally Neapolitan here. You know that they are opening up a schnitzel stand in the food court in the mall?",
        "Natalie: Okay, well, I'll have to give that a try when I come back to visit.",
        "Roxy: Honey, this is crazy talk.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Well, T\u00e9a might get you bail, but you better get used to these bars 'cause you'll be back.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but I didn't do it, Cole.",
        "Cole: Hannah saw it. She'll testify.",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. I'm sure she will, any way you want her to. [Sniffs] I would think twice about letting his freaky little girlfriend carry your case.",
        "Cole: She isn't--",
        "Todd: She's for sale. That's why she came to see me in the hospital, ready to wheel and deal. Oh, you didn't know that, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: What is the matter with you?",
        "Starr: You are. You and the way that you're messing with my family.",
        "Hannah: I'm not messing with your family.",
        "Starr: You lied about my dad attacking Cole's mom, and now you're playing Cole.",
        "Hannah: Well, you must not think much of your boyfriend if you think that's true.",
        "Starr: Okay, this has gone way too far. This is gonna blow up in your face, Hannah. You made a big mistake by trying to work my dad.",
        "Hannah: I'm not scared of your dad. He's locked up.",
        "Starr: Not for long because his lawyer's a killer shark. Her specialty is saving my dad. She lives for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: There's the Blair I know. Ha ha! Cheap shots at the fact that I have a brain tumor.",
        "Blair: That's the only way to get you to pay attention.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ho ho!",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a, do you really want to cut short the time that you do have?",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what? I'm not discussing this with you, Blair.",
        "Blair: You know, you're gonna be of no help to Dani or Todd if you--",
        "T\u00e9a: If I die? Exactly. I have very little time and a lot to do.",
        "Blair: Okay. What do you need to do? Just please let me help.",
        "T\u00e9a: I need to make sure that my daughter is taken care of...no matter what. I need her to accept her father or she'll have no one. I need Dani and Todd--I need Daniella and Todd to have a relationship--a good relationship, Blair.",
        "Blair: I understand that, but you can't do that tonight. Spring Todd tomorrow. You go home and you rest, all right? God knows, Todd Manning in jail is the best thing that could happen in this world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Are you threatening me?",
        "Starr: I'm warning you.",
        "Hannah: That your dad would attack me?",
        "Starr: I never said that.",
        "Hannah: Well, then what did you mean, that he'll get out of jail and...what? Should I call the police right now? I might need some protection.",
        "Starr: You just love this, don't you, playing little victim?",
        "Hannah: You are threatening me. I don't mean to be--",
        "Starr: To what? To be a victim? Trust me, Hannah, you're doing a great job at it, but you can't fool everyone for long, okay? So you back off and you leave my family alone or you will regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Otto: What the hell's going on here?",
        "Gigi: We're shopping.",
        "Otto: The store's closed.",
        "Gigi: Oh, that explains why we couldn't get any service. We'll just come back later.",
        "Otto: You're not going anywhere.",
        "Rex: We don't want any trouble, Otto.",
        "Otto: Robbery's a funny way to show it.",
        "Gigi: We didn't steal a thing.",
        "Otto: Yet.",
        "Gigi: This is all your fault. You're hiding Rex's parents, and it's a good bet there's information about them in that box.",
        "Otto: There's nothing in there for you.",
        "Gigi: Prove it! Open the box, because we're not leaving until we get the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I mean, it came out of nowhere.",
        "Matthew: So you kissed Nate for no reason?",
        "Dani: Well, I was confused.",
        "Matthew: Well, so am I.",
        "Dani: Okay, well, I was at the hospital with my mom, and Todd coded. All the doctors came running, and I felt bad for him, and I started to think that maybe he didn't do this terrible thing, and if he didn't, then maybe...but then John McBain showed up and arrested Todd for attacking Cole's mom, and everybody started fighting, and I didn't know what to think again. I mean, it was just noise and Todd in the middle of it freaking everybody out. It was so intense.",
        "Matthew: Well, I get that!",
        "Dani: Okay, so I went across the street to the park just to breathe, you know, only I couldn't and then Nate was there and--",
        "Matthew: And what?",
        "Dani: He was nice. He was just really nice and sane. It made me think that everything was okay. And I kissed him, but it didn't mean anything.",
        "Matthew: Okay.",
        "Dani: No, I swear.",
        "Matthew: So it didn't mean anything?",
        "Dani: Not at all.",
        "Matthew: So you don't like Nate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So how is Dani about Todd?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, let's see. I seem to remember her saying that he was dead to her. Those were her words.",
        "Blair: Well, then you've got your work cut out for you, don't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, yeah.",
        "Blair: So you better get home and get some rest.",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair--",
        "Blair: You got to start treatment tomorrow.",
        "T\u00e9a: You really don't understand.",
        "Blair: No, I understand you cannot neglect your health, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: My so-called health has an expiration date no matter what, Blair.",
        "Blair: Yes, and that's why you need to start your treatment tomorrow. Don't you want to buy some time here?",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what? I'd like the last hour of my life back. Can I go now, please?",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? I'll back off. I will.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank God.",
        "Blair: But I want to ask you one thing: If Dani or Todd were sick, what would you say to them right now?",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair, my prognosis--",
        "Blair: I know what your prognosis is, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",
        "Blair: I know. Would you tell them that you wanted them to fight for every minute or would you just let them go and let them give up like you have?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You didn't know your star witness was off the reservation?",
        "Cole: Okay, it wasn't like that.",
        "John: Is this true?",
        "Cole: Yeah. Hannah went to see him.",
        "John: When?",
        "Cole: Yesterday.",
        "Todd: I guess you didn't get the memo about never meeting with the other side.",
        "Cole: She was only trying to help.",
        "John: Bad idea.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Cole wouldn't recognize one of those if it bit him. He's about as smart as a box of hair.",
        "John: Did you know she was going?",
        "Todd: Thank God Hope takes after her mom.",
        "Cole: She told me after.",
        "John: What exactly did she say?",
        "Cole: Nothing. Just that...she was trying to get Todd to back off and drop the charges.",
        "Todd: No, that wasn't all.",
        "John: Cole?",
        "Cole: That was all.",
        "Todd: Yeah, John, forget about it. It's nothing. Trials are much more interesting when there's a surprise.",
        "John: What?",
        "Todd: Hannah came to see me with a deal. What, you want to know where she started the bidding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I don't care about your family.",
        "Starr: You want Cole.",
        "Hannah: Cole and I are just friends. That's all.",
        "Starr: Drop the act!",
        "Hannah: Maybe you should talk to someone about this. I mean, you're under a lot of stress, and things seemed pretty tense between you and Cole at the station.",
        "Starr: Cole and I are fine, but this little thing, it isn't working.",
        "Hannah: See, it's that kind of talk that worries me about you.",
        "Starr: Oh, please.",
        "Hannah: I mean, Cole was mad at you, right?",
        "Starr: We're none of your business.",
        "Hannah: I told him I understood why you broke his trust.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Hannah: Well, you told your dad about my little accident with the pills.",
        "Starr: Okay, it wasn't an accident. It was--",
        "Hannah: Private. You promised Cole. He's having trouble accepting what you did.",
        "Starr: My God, this is unbelievable.",
        "Hannah: It's all right. I'm sure you guys will figure it out in time, but you do have a lot to make up for. It's hard to come back from a betrayal like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You've moving because of John.",
        "Natalie: No. I'm going for me.",
        "Roxy: You know, baby, you were always lousy at the short con.",
        "Natalie: No. It is. It is for me. You know, I want--I want something new. And I hate how it feels seeing John.",
        "Roxy: Honey, I want to tell you, it's gonna change.",
        "Natalie: It's gonna be easier in London.",
        "Roxy: No. You better stick around here. I mean, John's good, but he's a guy. So you stick around here, and he's gonna remember what he wants.",
        "Natalie: John is happy where he is with Marty.",
        "Roxy: Well, I'm telling you, honey, it ain't gonna last.",
        "Natalie: So--so what, am I just supposed to wait around? How pathetic is that?",
        "Roxy: You know what pathetic is? Pathetic is being in another country, sitting in a bar with a drink with no ice in it. That's pathetic. You can't run from the truth, and believe me, I know.",
        "Natalie: What if you can't change it, either?",
        "Roxy: Well, baby, you don't know that until you try. You don't want to end up like me. Fight for John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Otto: Your woman's got a mouth and a lot of nerve.",
        "Rex: I like 'em both.",
        "Otto: You calling me a liar, too?",
        "Gigi: You are.",
        "Rex: Look, we don't mean any harm, okay? I don't even want anything from my real parents. I just want to know. Okay? I have been jerked around about who they are more than I could begin to explain. We've come a long way for some answers. We'll pay for any damage to the store. I'll pay you for the information. Name it. Just please help me.",
        "Penny: Dad, what's going on?",
        "Otto: Caught these two stealing. Call the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Do you like Nate?",
        "Dani: What do you mean?",
        "Matthew: You know what I mean.",
        "Dani: Well, he's a nice enough guy, but I barely know him.",
        "Matthew: So it's not a thing, you and Nate?",
        "Dani: No. It's totally different than you.",
        "Matthew: I'm sorry you felt so bad.",
        "Dani: Matthew.",
        "Matthew: Why didn't you just call me?",
        "Dani: Well, I was out of it. I was just reacting to everything, that's all.",
        "Matthew: Well, next time, just hit \"reply.\"",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Matthew: I texted you.",
        "Dani: When?",
        "Matthew: That day. The day I was looking for you at the hospital. I figured I would just, you know, text you and let you know that if you needed to talk to somebody, you had me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I am not giving up. I am prioritizing, Blair. Todd and Daniella come first.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? It doesn't work that way if it ends up killing you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Killing me?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "T\u00e9a: Exactly my point.",
        "Blair: Well, I don't understand your point. I don't understand why you're taking it.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Blair: You fight for a damn traffic ticket in traffic court like it's life or death, but now that it is life and death, you're just taking it!",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, Blair, what do you want me to do? Spend all my time in a hospital?",
        "Blair: No. I want you to go out there and maybe find out if there's a cure here. Go out and see if you can beat this thing.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's not going to happen.",
        "Blair: You don't know that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Every minute I spend looking for a cure I lose with my daughter, okay?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Miracles happen.",
        "T\u00e9a: One happened this morning. Dani and I played hooky, and we went shopping for prom dresses.",
        "Blair: See?",
        "T\u00e9a: I made her smile.",
        "Blair: See?",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha! I made her smile, Blair, and, um, she actually spoke to me. We spent an hour without fighting. My daughter laughed at my bad jokes. Do you know how long it's been since my daughter laughed at my bad jokes? You want me to give all that up for what? Time in a hospital bed with radiation treatments f-for more time in a hospital bed for--no. Sorry. I'm sorry. But that's a fool's bargain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: It's not that easy, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Come here. Sit down. If you want Johnny, you got to take your shot.",
        "Natalie: I did. I bared my soul to him, and he chose Marty.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but that was the only play that he had. She was knocked up. What was he gonna do? Dump her and run off with you? You wouldn't have wanted him anyway.",
        "Natalie: True.",
        "Roxy: The baby is gone. All right, it's really sad, but there you got it, okay? And that's the only thing that was keeping them together.",
        "Natalie: We don't know that. I mean, losing the baby could pull them closer together.",
        "Roxy: Well, why don't you stick around and find out?",
        "Natalie: Because I can't! I can't do this anymore! I can't take all this humiliation!",
        "Roxy: You didn't tell Johnny that you were leaving town, did you?",
        "Natalie: No. I told you, I haven't told anyone.",
        "Roxy: Well, why don't you tell him and give him a chance to stop you.",
        "Natalie: Because I cannot put my life on hold forever while John figures it out.",
