        "Cole: Oh, yeah? How'd they look?",
        "Starr: Nervous, but happy.",
        "Cole: I wish I could say the same about us.",

        "Asher: I know a guy that could hook you up with a nice pig's blood bath.",
        "Lola: What?",
        "Asher: It's pretty obvious those two are on your hit list. It's never too late to do something about it.",

        "Markko: \"Dare to dream\"?",
        "Langston: Who came up with that cheesy theme?",
        "Markko: It doesn't even make sense. Once you hit REM sleep, your brain makes you dream.",
        "Langston: So, you were paying attention in bio.",
        "Markko: Oh, the dumbest kid in class could tell you -- you don't dare to dream. What takes daring is to try and make your dream come true.",
        "Langston: Well, then, you'd better be a daredevil tonight, because I'm tired of just dreaming of making love to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: This is like d\u00e9ja vu, only without the big hair, sequins, and shoulder pads.",
        "Matthew: You can go now.",
        "Rachel: Not before I get to dance.",
        "Matthew: You're kidding me, right? I thought we had a deal.",
        "Woman: Excuse me. Can someone tell me how I get backstage?",
        "Matthew: You're -- you're a pussycat doll.",
        "Woman: Hi, I'm Nicole. What's your name?",
        "Matthew: Matthew.",
        "Nicole: Matthew, well, it's nice to meet you, Matthew. Well, who's the lucky girl that gets to be your date tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: What?",
        "Destiny: Is that any way to speak to this hotness?",
        "Shaun: You mean hot mess.",
        "Destiny: Oh, is that what you've been cleaning up in here, Mr. Glorified manny?",
        "Shaun: I am working. What do you want?",
        "Destiny: Our brother's phone number.",
        "Shaun: God, you are hard-headed. What part of no don't you understand?",
        "Destiny: Then I'll settle for the limo and a ride to the prom. I've got an entrance to make.",

        "Stacy: Do you know if Ultraviolet's open to the public after the bachelorette party tonight?",
        "Rex: No, Jessica booked it.",
        "Brody: I've got to make a dumpster run. This stuff went bad. When I get back, I'll tell these stragglers it's last call.",
        "Gigi: Not so fast.",
        "Brody: That stuff's rotten.",
        "Gigi: Well, doesn't mean it can't serve a good cause.",

        "Rex: We are in a wedding tomorrow. You want to go out now?",
        "Stacy: You want to stay here and watch these lovebirds?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Here's your burger, sis. You must be starving after shaking your assets for everybody.",
        "Stacy: You know what? I lost my appetite.",
        "Rex: Eat. You'll need your energy. I'm taking you out on the town tonight.",

        "Jessica: Answer to what?",
        "Roxy: He proposed to her, but Miss Legalese over here, it looks like she's going to make him work for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What's wrong?",
        "Jared: I just heard Bo and Michael talking. They are exhuming the baby's body.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Jared: It's not going to take them long to figure that if it isn't Starr's baby in the grave, it's Jessica's.",
        "Natalie: Then they'll know that Chloe's really Starr's baby. Oh, my God, how much time do we have?",
        "Jared: How long does it take to do a DNA test?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So, the reason the center gave me a pass was because I told them --",
        "Starr: Did Bo call you?",
        "Cole: No. What, did something happen?",
        "Starr: I talked to Marcie... a little while ago. Hope is being exhumed tonight. We're finally going to get our answers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: You're going to have to find yourself another chauffer, because I'm on the clock.",
        "Destiny: You're answering the door. I'm sure your rich clients can get off their butts for an hour while you take me to prom.",
        "Shaun: Doesn't your date have a ride?",
        "Destiny: Tyrone drives a hybrid.",
        "Shaun: You're going to the prom with Tyrone?",
        "Destiny: What's wrong with that?",

        "Shaun: Don't you work nights?",
        "Tyrone: Not tonight.",
        "Destiny: He took the night off to be my date. That's what family does. They make sacrifices for each other. Now, are you down or not?",

        "Matthew: Actually, I don't have a date.",
        "Nicole: What, a good-looking guy like you? What, are the girls at this school blind or just stupid? Or maybe he's just keeping his options open.",
        "Rachel: Exactly. My brother's a little heartbreaker.",
        "Nicole: I can tell.",
        "Rachel: I'm Rachel, big fan.",
        "Nicole: Oh, thank you. Oh, well, I guess I'd better go find the girls.",
        "Matthew: I think you want to go that way.",
        "Nicole: Great. Well, it was nice to meet you both. And Matthew, date or no date -- actually, I'm going to be your date tonight, so I'd better see you rocking out out there, all right?",
        "Matthew: Cool.",
        "Nicole: All right, I'll see you guys later.",
        "Matthew and Rachel: Bye.",
        "Matthew: That was awesome.",
        "Rachel: I told you you would have a good time, didn't I? We haven't even been here five minutes and you've already met Nicole from the Pussycat Dolls. Why don't you brag about that to those friends of yours?",
        "Matthew: What friends?",
        "Rachel: Those two. Didn't they visit you at the house the other day?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Take out an ad, why don't you?",
        "Langston: What is the big deal?",
        "Markko: If you want our sex life to turn into prom gossip, fine by me.",
        "Langston: Oh, who cares what people say? You're graduating in a month, and everybody already thinks we've been doing it for two years.",
        "Markko: They don't know what we've been doing.",
        "Langston: News flash -- nobody thinks we're still virgins. If anything, us not doing it would be the scandal.",
        "Markko: I just want tonight to be special and to keep your rep intact.",
        "Langston: My -- my rep? I'm considered the biggest freak in the junior class. Gossip about operation deflower, if it gets out, is not going to change that. The only person I was worried about finding out was Dorian, and Lola took care of that. So we're in the clear.",
        "Lola: Think again, prima. From where I'm standing, all kinds of things could go wrong.",
        "Langston: Really? Like you winding up with the friendly neighborhood drug dealer?",
        "Lola: Or you winding up pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, what's wrong?",
        "Cole: I mean, I started this whole thing and I just thought I would have more time to get used to the idea.",
        "Starr: I did, too. When Marcie first told me, I freaked out. But I just want this all to be over with.",
        "Cole: There really are people digging our daughter out of the ground right now?",
        "Starr: Michael McBain's overseeing all of it.",
        "Cole: All right, then we have to go over there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: There's got to be some way that we can keep this secret.",
        "Jared: How, short of derailing the exhumation?",
        "Natalie: That's it, that's it. We just -- we'll go to Uncle Bo and we'll convince him to stop it. We'll just tell him what a disaster it would be to dig the baby up.",
        "Jared: This is Starr and Cole's baby, Natalie, as far as everybody else is concerned. We have no rights. And if we start to make a fuss, we're going to draw attention that we don't want.",
        "Natalie: But we have to do something.",
        "Jared: Look, there's only one story that will even make your uncle Bo think twice about considering to exhume Hope's body. The truth.",
        "Natalie: Okay, okay, then we'll tell Uncle Bo the truth, okay? Because he's family, and he'll understand more than anyone why we can't tell Jessica --",
        "Jared: Stop, Natalie, stop. There is no way your Uncle Bo will even consider carrying on this lie, not even for Jessica.",
        "Natalie: But the truth will kill her, Jared.",
        "Jared: Look, we will be there for her. Your mom will be there for her. Your dad, the rest of the family.",
        "Natalie: You're saying that there's absolutely no way we can keep this from coming out, aren't you?",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. Jared, how am I going to tell my sister that her baby's dead?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Why don't we give them some time alone, okay?",
        "Roxy: No, because she never answered my question.",
        "Viki: How's the hair haven? I understand you're looking for investors.",
        "Clint: How long are you going to keep me hanging here?",
        "Nora: Can you wait until I get my drink?",
        "Clint: You can't give me an answer without a double shot of liquid courage?",
        "Nora: Oh, now, wait just a minute, here. You come barreling in here, in the middle of a bachelorette party for your own daughter. And let me just say this. This is supposed to be Natalie's special day, and you take it upon yourself to go in front of a room full of people and practically demand that I marry you. I feel like I'm negotiating my surrender. So what do you expect me to do?",
        "Clint: I expected you to say, \"What took you so long,\" and then give me a hard time. And then I expected you to say, \"Yeah, I'll marry you.\"",
        "Nora: Well, I can give you two out of the three.",
        "Clint: You're turning me down?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'll pull the car around.",
        "Stacy: Thanks for the hospitality, sis.",
        "Gigi: We're closing, get out.",
        "Stacy: Oh, oh, I will. Rex and I are going out dancing tonight. And then tomorrow we're going to watch two people be joined in front of that God you're so caught up with. Who knows, maybe Rex and I will get caught up, too. Imagining ourselves walking that slow walk down the aisle, together, just us. Hmm, toodles.",
        "Brody: How is it possible you're related to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I didn't say no.",
        "Clint: You didn't say yes, so what are you saying?",
        "Nora: I -- I just -- I feel like your proposal is just a tad disingenuous.",
        "Clint: You think I don't want to marry you?",
        "Nora: Not really, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jessica: Hey, what are you doing?",
        "Brody: Party's over, and I'm closing up. I'll have the place to myself.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Brody: Yeah, you wanna come by when you're done?",
        "Jessica: Be there in 10 minutes.",
        "Viki: Is Jared's party over already?",
        "Charlie: We got some news that pretty much cleared the whole place out.",
        "Viki: What kind of news?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, I've got to come up with a plan or something. We've got to --",
        "Jared: Okay, sweetheart, calm down. You've got to --",
        "Natalie: No -- no, I can't. I can't. Okay, this isn't -- this isn't just about Jess, okay? This is about you and me and Mom and Dad when we just -- we got all of our lives back together. Last year, after what happened last year and now -- now I'm supposed to be the one who's going to blow all of our lives up again? I mean, how am I supposed to do that? How?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: After everything Starr's been through, to have to go through such a ghastly process?",
        "Jessica: The exhumation?",
        "Viki: You know about it?",
        "Jessica: Marcie told me about it tonight.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey.",
        "Jessica: I feel so bad for her and Cole and Starr.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Charlie: I can't imagine how miserable those kids must feel to exhume their baby just to have to turn around and put her back in the ground.",
        "Viki: Oh, they're going to feel like they're losing her all over again.",
        "Tess: Hey, baby.",
        "[Tess pants]",
        "Tess: Why aren't you crying?",
        "Viki: You okay?",
        "Jessica: Um, can you just tell Natalie that I left. I'm fine, yeah.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",

        "Lola: I'm just trying to have a good time.",
        "Langston: Great, then stay away from us.",
        "Lola: Fine, I'm just saying that the first time is never all it's cracked up to be.",
        "Markko: Oh, you know that from experience?",
        "Asher: You calling my date a slut?",
        "Lola: Look, I'm just saying, you're both virgins, so you might be better off with people who are more experienced.",
        "Markko: I can't believe you came to prom with this drug-dealing piece of crap.",
        "Asher: Hey, do I know you?",
        "Langston: No, Starr Manning knows you. She wanted me to give you a message. She said, \"Drop dead.\"",

        "Justin: Evening, Matt. How's it going? You're Matt's sister, right? Justin.",

        "Becca: Hey.",
        "Rachel: Hi. I'm going to go inside. Just let me know when you need a ride, okay?",
        "Justin: Your date's your sister? And even she's ditching you. Can you get any more pathetic?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So, where is everyone?",
        "Starr: They're out, except for Aunt Dorian who's probably somewhere wearing out the carpets or marble or whatever.",
        "Cole: Does she know about Markko and Langston's after-prom plans?",
        "Starr: Wait a second. Get in here.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Starr: And how would you know about that? Markko told you?",
        "Cole: Yeah, Markko told me.",
        "Starr: Was he bragging to you or something? That's so -- argh.",
        "Cole: Was Langston bragging when she told you?",
        "Starr: No, girls are very different.",
        "Cole: Oh, really?",
        "Starr: Yes, really.",
        "Cole: So they don't get nervous and excited and then turn to you and ask you to buy them condoms when they're too embarrassed to do it themselves?",
        "Starr: Markko asked you to buy condoms for him?",
        "Cole: Yeah, but shh, you can't tell anyone.",
        "Starr: Okay, only if you promise not to tell anyone that Aunt durian gave Langston a French condom holder.",
        "Cole: A French what?",
        "[Starr laughs]",
        "Starr: And it was filled -- it was filled with them.",

        "Starr: No, it's not. That's gross.",
        "Cole: Oh, man, I want to give him a hard time about that one.",
        "Starr: What if we just, like, showed up at prom to give them a hard time.",
        "Cole: You know, we could go.",
        "Starr: No, we couldn't. I don't have anything to wear. It's a prom.",
        "Cole: Okay, you have, like, a million dresses upstairs.",
        "Starr: And what would you wear, one of Moe's tuxes?",
        "Cole: Actually, I -- I sort of have a tuxedo in my car. Before you told me what was happening with Hope, I was going to ask you if you wanted to go with me. So, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Oh, you are so hot when you're like this.",
        "Langston: Right back at you.",

        "Shaun: Anyway, that's what my sister says.",
        "Rachel: She's your sister?",
        "Shaun: Yeah, the shorty with the beauty and the brains. That's my sassy little sister. You a teacher?",
        "Rachel: A sister, actually.",
        "Shaun: Well, I figured that.",
        "Rachel: To the very sensitive, brave, kick-ass kid in the wheelchair. His name's Matthew. Mine's Rachel.",

        "Clint: How do you think I don't mean my proposal?",
        "Nora: Well, I don't know. Maybe you do. I don't -- I've never seen you do this before. I mean, do you usually propose spur of the moment all apropos of nothing?",
        "Clint: Apropos of nothing?",
        "Nora: Well, Clint, this is a little out of the blue.",
        "Clint: What did you want, notice?",
        "Nora: Oh, for Pete's sake.",
        "Clint: You know, when a guy proposes, it's usually a surprise, a happy surprise.",
        "Nora: Well, it's a surprise, all right. But we haven't been happy.",
        "[Nora scoffs]",
        "Nora: Just a few hours ago we weren't happy. Do you remember that? Because I'm still kind of in the recovery phase from that, and now you ask me to spend the rest of my life with you and I -- I'm feeling a little jerked around.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel that way.",
        "Nora: Clint, where is this coming from?",
        "Clint: I'm asking you to marry me because I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. But, in all honesty, it did start with Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Okay, so it's going to take Bo a couple of days to figure out that the baby in the grave isn't Starr and Cole's. So we do have some time.",
        "Natalie: Time for what? To delay the inevitable? Jared, I can't, I can't. I can't keep lying to everyone, as noble as I may think my reasons are. I have to figure out a way to tell Jessica.",
        "Jared: You can't be the one to tell her.",
        "Natalie: Why not?",
        "Jared: Look, you said it yourself. Jessica looks fine, but if she's blocked out what happened to her baby, she's only a house of cards. And we have no idea what knowing the truth is going to do to her.",
        "Natalie: Okay, fine, then we'll just bring someone else in on it. We have to tell Mom.",

        "Stacy: No, I'll be fine. Just give me a couple seconds, then we can go out dancing.",
        "Rex: Are you kidding me? You are down for the count. We are staying in.",
        "Stacy: No, Rex, please. I'll rally. I want to go party with you.",
        "Rex: There will be other nights.",
        "Stacy: Another night when you're all upset because your ex has been rubbing her new relationship in your face? Come on, I just want to take our mind off everything.",

Viki told me I should fight for them. And you know what? I am. Shane needs his parents together almost as much as he needs Stacy's stem cells. And I just have a hard time believing that you would work your miracle through my deadbeat sister. But if you are, that's your choice. Because I am through rolling over and playing dead for Stacy.",

        "Clint: Hold on. Bo and I got into it at Rodi's. Accusations were leveled.",
        "Nora: All right, what accusations?",
        "Clint: I accused Bo of wanting you back. And he said if I was having any problems with Nora, it was my own damn fault.",
        "Nora: And you jumped to the conclusion that --",
        "Clint: And then he said, if we're not married by now, you are never going to do it.",
        "Nora: So you hopped in the car, and you sped down here to propose.",
        "Clint: I know how it looks.",
        "Nora: Do you? Do you really? Because from where I'm standing, it looks like this whole proposal isn't because you love me or anything quite like that. It's because you've got something to prove to your brother.",
        "Clint: No, that's not it at all. I don't want to prove anything to Bo. I want to prove something to you.",
        "Nora: Prove what?",
        "Clint: How I feel. How much you mean to me.",
        "Nora: Ah. And you want me to prove the same to you.",

        "Roxy: Okay.",
        "Jared: Okay, I am sorry I blindsided you like that. I didn't know what else to do. With Roxy right there, it was not the time or the place to tell your mom.",
        "Natalie: I know, it's just -- we're running out of time.",
        "Jared: Well, you heard your mom. Jessica's home with the kids. Maybe we give her one last happy night with Bree and Chloe, and then we put an end to this tomorrow.",

        "Destiny: Sure, I am. I'm at the prom with my cousin, because my friend didn't ask me when he should have. But if I didn't speak to people I was mad at, I'd be mute. So can you dance in that thing?",

        "Jessica: They got the cause of death wrong on the death certificate.",
        "Brody: That's a nightmare. Are you guys close?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Definitely. Starr's great, but it's not that.",
        "Brody: What is it that's freaking you out?",
        "Jessica: Whenever I think about her baby and the moment -- moments of life that she had, it's like a punch in the stomach and I can't breathe.",
        "Brody: Like an anxiety attack?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I don't know what it is. Natalie and Jared are getting married tomorrow. I am Natalie's matron of honor. I mean, I'm sure they're -- I'm going to get a million stares from people wondering what's going on with me. Am I really sane? Is it really water under the bridge that my alter tried to kill the bride and groom?",
        "Brody: In other words, you're going to be the life of the party.",
        "Jessica: I really wish that you could be there, you know? I'd pull you on the dance floor and just block everything else out.",
        "Brody: It won't always be like this. I promise. We'll have that dance one day. Until then, would you settle for a preview?",

        "Nora: And stubborn.",
        "Clint: I was going to get there. And stubborn, yes. And I was only thinking of myself. So I was selfish, and Bo was good enough to point that out to me.",

        "Clint: But I am done --",
        "Nora: Oh, God.",
        "Clint: Being a jealous fool. And I refuse to throw away our partnership and our friendship which has grown into love that we've enjoyed for nearly two years now, Nora. I want to be there for you. And for Matthew. And for Bo. I'd like to be able to prove myself to you, every day for the rest of our lives. And I promise you, it won't be as boring as it sounds. I want all of that. If you'll have me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know what? You're right. I mean, tomorrow, the truth's going to come out, and we're going to have to cancel the wedding anyway, so we might as well do it tonight.",
        "Jared: Yeah, and by this time tomorrow, no one's going to be in any sort of mood to celebrate. So we may not be getting the wedding that we wanted, but I will be damned if I go to bed one more night without my wife.",
