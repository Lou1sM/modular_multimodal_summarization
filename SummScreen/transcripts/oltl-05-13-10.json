        "Clint: No, come on in. Come on in. Viki Banks, I'd like you to meet Reed Wagner. He's an associate of ours from the London office.",
        "Viki: Oh, how do you do? Reed Wagner. Oh, I know! My son Kevin has spoken of you very highly.",
        "Reed: I couldn't ask for a better ambassador. He's a shark in business and an absolute gentleman out of the boardroom. You should be proud.",

        "Jessica: Sure. What's up?",
        "Brody: The florist wanted to know if you'd prefer a corsage or a wristlet. I wasn't sure, so I thought I'd check. What do you think?",
        "Jessica: Uh, surprise me. Later.",
        "[Click]",
        "Jessica: Need help?",
        "Cristian: I've got it covered. I'm just trying to do as much as I can before they take this away for prom tonight.",
        "Jessica: Well, I can't wait. I hope you save a dance for me.",
        "Cristian: We talked about this. I'm a teacher. You're a student. It wouldn't be appropriate.",
        "Jessica: But you getting jealous last night when Ford was hitting on me, was that appropriate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Oh, prom girl, you are looking so good!",
        "Langston: Thanks again for squeezing me in, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Well, I know it's a little tight. All these ladies made their appointments weeks ago.",
        "Langston: I've been distracted.",
        "Roxy: Distracted? Listen, you know, prom night can be the most important night of your life where you could end up, you know...in the back seat of a guy's car. You gotta plan for it, kid. You leave nothing to chance. Give me a second while I get the tanning bed ready for you.",
        "Ford: Okay.",
        "Langston: Tanning bed?",
        "Ford: GTL, baby. Gym. Tanning. Laundry. Gotta pump it up for the beach season. But I'll give you a little preview if you ditch the prom and come to my place instead.",

        "Layla: Hey, John. I was just about to leave you a note. I have to leave early tonight for the high school prom.",

        "Layla: You make it sound so fun.",
        "John: Well, better you than me.",
        "Layla: Yeah. Rita will be here soon to cover my desk, and your mail is on your desk.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Layla: Welcome.",
        "John: Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I can't ditch the prom. Markko and I are going together, and he's really been looking forward to this.",
        "Ford: Didn't the guy have his own prom last year?",
        "Langston: Yes, but it was incredible and now he wants mine to be incredible, too.",
        "Ford: Well, what do you want? Crepe paper and some cheesy emo band? Or this...",
        "Langston: I have to go tonight.",
        "Ford: All right. Do what you gotta do. Hey, how early can you slip away?",
        "Langston: If it were up to you, I'd hijack the limo straight to your place.",
        "Ford: You know you want to.",
        "Langston: I thought you were okay with this.",
        "Ford: You sure you are? I've got the whole apartment to myself tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Jess, I wasn't jealous.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no? Well, you practically bit Ford's head off when he said that he wished that all the girls in his high school were as pretty as me. And when he referred to me as a woman, you basically told him to treat me like a child.",
        "Cristian: Trust me, that wasn't jealousy.",
        "Jessica: Well, what would you call it?",
        "Cristian: Look, Ford--he's a great roommate. He picks up after himself. He pays the rent on time.",
        "Jessica: And he's hot.",
        "Cristian: But you can't judge a book by its cover.",
        "Jessica: Clich\u00e9.",
        "Cristian: I don't agree with the way the guy treats women. I would have reacted that way no matter who the guy was hitting on. I was just being protective.",
        "Jessica: That's not what Layla thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Layla: I hear you have a date to the prom.",
        "Brody: Yeah, Jessica asked me to go with her.",
        "Layla: She came by our house last night to let us know.",
        "Brody: Huh. Well, it would be nice to think she did that to let Cristian know she's moving on, but we both know better. She probably did that to get a rise out of me.",
        "Layla: But the good news is that you'll be there with Jessica tonight.",
        "Brody: Yeah, but it could be my last chance. She won't agree to go out with me again.",
        "Layla: She's not making it easy for you.",
        "Brody: The only easy day was yesterday.",
        "Layla: Seal motto, right? Sometimes I forget how much you've been through.",
        "Brody: I'm not looking for pity.",
        "Layla: It's not. It's so not. It's just that it's not fair. After everything you went through to be together with Jessica. Anyone can get through to her, it's you.",
        "Brody: Hope you're right. 'Cause I've just got this one night to make her fall for me all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Clint, I'm actually here on family business, so why don't you give me a ring when you're done, okay?",
        "Clint: No, we are done. We were just wrapping up.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Reed: I'd have to adjourn anyway. I have a date tonight.",
        "Viki: Oh, how nice. Well, it was very nice to meet you, Mr. Wagner.",
        "Reed: And you, Mrs. Banks.",
        "Viki: Thank you. So, how much time do you plan on spending here in Llanview?",
        "Reed: Well, that depends on how long it takes me to conclude my business here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Kelly, I would like you to meet Shaun Evans. Shaun, this is my niece Kelly Cramer.",
        "Kelly: A bodyguard?",
        "Shaun: Pleasure to meet you.",
        "Dorian: I'm very proud of the fact that since I became mayor, the homicide rate has gone down. However, that doesn't change the fact that there is a dangerous killer at large.",
        "Kelly: Okay, I don't need a campaign speech or a chaperone.",
        "Dorian: What you do need is a wake-up call, which I would think it would have been enough for you to find a dead man in your office--a man who you believe was about to tell you who murdered your mother.",
        "Kelly: I am perfectly safe. I told you, I don't need a stranger baby-sitting me.",
        "Dorian: Look at the size of the guy. You need him to protect you.",
        "Shaun: I'm not a stranger, by the way.",
        "Dorian: He has worked for me for a long time, and he nearly lost his life saving Starr's baby.",
        "Kelly: Shaun, I am sure that you are a heck of a guy--",
        "Dorian: There is no negotiation going on here. Do you understand me? This man is your bodyguard until the situation is resolved.",
        "Kelly: Fine. You can start first thing tomorrow.",
        "Shaun: Nice try, but my meter's already ticking.",
        "Kelly: Dorian, can I talk to you for a minute, please? Right over here.",
        "Dorian: Sure.",
        "Kelly: As sweet as all this is, my dinner reservations are for 2, not 3.",
        "Dorian: You have a date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: \"John McBain: Personal.\"",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rita: Just wanted to let you know I'm here.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Rita: I can get that at my desk?",
        "John: No, it's okay. I got it. Yeah, McBain. Oh, good. I'll be right down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You're just gonna have to live with it. Tonight is my senior prom.",
        "Ford: Yeah, well, you're only young once.",
        "Langston: Isn't that what you keep telling me? And besides, tonight is probably one of the last times that Markko and I will be out together as a couple.",
        "Ford: Rub it in, why don't you?",
        "Langston: Look, after school's over and Markko doesn't have to worry about finals anymore, I'm gonna break up with him and you and I can be together all the time. But tonight--",
        "Ford: Tonight, my roommates Cristian and Layla are gonna be at prom. I'll have the place all to myself, and we could do whatever we want. You wouldn't have to whisper my name\u0097",
        "Roxy: Okay, it's hot enough for you! The tanning bed. It's ready. You want the full body, right?",
        "Ford: Of course. See if you can work this out.",
        "Roxy: Ready?",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I'm having dinner.",
        "Dorian: With that charming visitor from London? Ha ha! Reed Wagner?",
        "Kelly: Yes.",
        "Dorian: I knew it.",
        "Kelly: Now everyone must know.",
        "Dorian: Oh, great, great. I told you. I knew from the beginning that this relationship was much bigger than you were letting on.",
        "Kelly: It's not a relationship. It's dinner.",
        "Dorian: Oh, it's a dinner date.",
        "Kelly: Okay, call it what you want, but three's a crowd, all right? And I have to go get my hair blown out.",
        "Shaun: What should I do?",
        "Dorian: There's nothing you can do. Follow her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'll give you a call in the morning, Reed.",
        "Reed: All right. Mrs. Banks?",
        "Viki: Yes?",
        "Reed: Once again, it's been a pleasure.",
        "Viki: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yes, for me, too.",
        "Clint: So, can I get you something?",
        "Viki: Nigel, actually, said something about putting on a pot of tea.",
        "Clint: Ah, that's perfect.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Well, what's on your mind?",
        "Viki: Is Jessie home?",
        "Clint: No. She's not home from school yet. Why, is something wrong?",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint. We have to talk about her going to this prom.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Well, I am glad that it's Brody who's taking her. Brody will take good care of her.",
        "Viki: Charlie, actually, did a lot of fancy footwork to get her to invite him.",
        "Clint: Oh, well, thank him for me.",
        "Viki: I will. I will.",
        "Clint: So, things are going well between the two of you?",
        "Viki: Oh! Oh, yes. Yes, thankfully. Yes. I mean, I'm not exactly thrilled that he's on this city center development project working so closely with Dorian.",
        "Clint: Yes, that would be tough.",
        "Viki: I mean, she's manipulated him so much in the past. And on the other hand, it's a wonderful opportunity for him.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Over the years, Dorian has put you through hell, but each and every time you come back stronger than ever. So that leads me to believe you'll endure this, too.",
        "Viki: Well, I guess we'll see, won't we?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Okay, back to the prom. Clint, I can stand me being hurt. I cannot bear it when my children are hurt.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I know you want to protect them and shield them from anything that could cause them pain.",
        "Viki: In this case, I just don't see how that's possible. I mean, I realize Brody is taking her, but...",
        "Clint: But she wants to be with Cristian.",
        "Viki: Yes! Clint, she's got her heart set on them getting back together again. That's simply not going to happen. And so...",
        "Clint: She could very well get hurt.",
        "Viki: She's lost so much these last few years. Every single time she gets her life back on track, something comes along to derail it.",
        "Clint: Well, we have to keep in mind that Jessie's just as strong as you are.",
        "Viki: Oh, probably stronger, but how much can somebody take? How is our little girl gonna bounce back if her heart gets broken again? And tonight of all nights.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I saw you and Layla talking in the kitchen, and I know that she saw what I saw, that you didn't like that another man was moving in on me.",
        "Cristian: Jess, you have to stop this. You're reading way too much into this.",
        "Jessica: Well, I know what I saw, and I know what it means. You still have feelings for me.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but it's not the way you're thinking. Watch out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I'm really pulling for you, Brody. I hope tonight's everything you hope it will be for you and Jessica.",
        "Brody: Thanks.",
        "Layla: I'll see you at the prom.",
        "Brody: Ha ha!",
        "Layla: I gotta go find Carlotta. She's holding the boutonniere I bought for Cristian here in the fridge.",
        "Brody: You guys are going all out.",
        "Layla: I wanted it to be a surprise. See ya.",
        "Natalie: Brody. Hey.",
        "Brody: What's going on? You okay?",
        "Natalie: Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm good. I'm great. I just...I either just did the bravest thing I've ever done in my life or the stupidest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hey, Rita. Is John in?",
        "Rita: He stepped out, but you're welcome to wait in his office.",
        "Marty: Oh, okay, thank you.",
        "Natalie's voice: I've tried to deny it, tried to fight it, but there's something that keeps pulling me back to you no matter how hard I try to stay away. If there's any part of you that feels the same way, I'll be at Rodi's at midnight. If I don't see you there, then this is good-bye.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marty: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Now, when I want to work at home, it is my privilege. I'm the mayor, for goodness sakes, but I want an easel here. I want these plans mount-- I'll get back to you. Good-bye. Hello, darling! Did you get the appointment for the mani/pedi? Ooh! Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Good. I'm absolutely thrilled that you decided to get ready for the prom here at La Boulaie where you can have all those extra bedrooms with their en suite baths to choose from. You don't have to jockey with 3 other people for a bathroom.",
        "Langston: It's just me and Markko going. Cole's in jail, remember?",
        "Dorian: Oh, of course, I remember. Poor Starr.",
        "Langston: It's just not fair. I mean, if anybody deserves to go to prom and be happy, it's Starr and Cole.",
        "Dorian: And you deserve it, too. And I'm sure that's how Starr feels about it. I mean, this is your night, darling. It's your debut into the adult world.",
        "Langston: Like a debutante?",
        "Dorian: Like a brilliant young graduate. I can't believe it's here, your senior prom. It was just 3 years ago that you came to me a girl, and now you're a woman.",
        "Langston: I've been a woman for a while now.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. I hope you're going to... well, indulge me. I don't care. I booked a makeup artist and a hair stylist to come here to the house, and then we're gonna take some gorgeous photographs of you. Langston, what's the matter? Why am I more excited about prom night than you are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bell dings]",
        "Roxy: Hey, hot stuff! Turn over and let the other side cook. You know, I'm good, but I don't know if I can do nothin' with that.",
        "Kelly: Actually, I'm the one with the appointment today.",
        "Roxy: Oh, right. Okay. Good. Well, take a seat. I'll be right with you.",
        "Kelly: Okay. So, how much is my auntie paying you these days?",
        "Shaun: Doesn't matter. Mayor Lord has always been fair to me. Well, for the most part.",
        "Kelly: Oh. So there's room for negotiation?",
        "Shaun: Not over this. Me and your aunt both believe in the same thing.",
        "Kelly: What's that?",
        "Shaun: Anybody who steps to family gets got.",
        "Kelly: Gets what?",
        "Shaun: Handled. Terminated. Your Aunt Dorian is a straight gangster. If you don't know, you need to ask somebody.",
        "Kelly: Well, unfortunately, Shaun, I do know.",
        "Shaun: So whether you like it or not, you're stuck with me until we're 100% sure that you're not in trouble.",
        "Kelly: All right. I guess then I'm gonna have to find out who killed my mother and Rodney pretty fast.",
        "Roxy: So, what are we doing here? Getting you ready for a hot date?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Viki, I'm at the point now where I don't know what's best for Jessica. I mean, do we let her continue to try and re-create what she's lost and actually treat her like a teenager who's going to a prom? If we do that, how long does this go on? I mean, next year at this time are we gonna put her in college, have her sleep in the dorm?",
        "Viki: And what about Bree? She misses her mother so much. When is Jessica going to be the responsible adult that she needs to be?",
        "Clint: I have all those same questions, and I don't think any of them are gonna be resolved tonight.",
        "Viki: Well, that's not necessarily true. They actually might. See, Marty feels that this night is somehow critical for Jessica.",
        "Clint: Well, it's certainly important to her.",
        "Viki: Yeah. Here's my problem. If this prom does not turn out to be everything that Jessica hoped for, what's going to happen to her? Is she going to be stuck in the past forever because of that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: Oh, wow. This is bad. I am so sorry, Mr. Vega. Is everyone okay? Can I help? What can I do?",
        "Cristian: No. Yes, yes. We're okay. It's okay. Just watch where you're walking.",
        "Jessica: Are you still gonna deny that you have feelings for me, pretend that you weren't jealous when another man was hitting on me?",
        "Cristian: Jess, we've been over this a million times. I'm in love with Layla.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but what you felt for me isn't gone. You were jealous. Admit it.",
        "Cristian: I'm not gonna get into this with you.",
        "Jessica: Well, swear.",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Jessica: Swear that you weren't jealous.",
        "Cristian: No, I'm not gonna swear.",
        "Jessica: Just swear on your mother's life.",
        "Cristian: Jess!",
        "Jessica: What? Swear on your mother's life. Swear you weren't jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Ha! What was that for?",
        "Carlotta: For making my Cristian happy. You're here for his boutonniere, right?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm. I was sick for my high school prom, and I want to do this right.",
        "Carlotta: Wow. It seems like only yesterday when Cristian took...",
        "Layla: When Cristian took Jessica to the prom?",
        "Carlotta: That was a long time ago.",
        "Layla: Yeah, but is it really in the past?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So, come on. Tell me what's going on. You'll be doing me a favor helping me think about someone else's problems instead of my own.",
        "Natalie: Well, if I could be of service.",
        "Brody: No, come on. I really-- I want to help you if I can. You've told me some pretty heavy stuff, you know. Thinking that you and John would be together if Marty hadn't gotten pregnant.",
        "Natalie: That got me accused of attempted murder, and this could be so much worse. I mean, I practically asked John to choose between me and Marty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Nice surprise. I wasn't expecting you.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I came to see Cole and they said I had to come back a little later.",
        "John: Yeah, they got a lot of paperwork. I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: It's okay. How is he?",
        "John: He's hanging in there. He's tough.",
        "Marty: Anything else?",
        "John: Manning's been moved here from the hospital.",
        "Marty: In a cell near Cole?",
        "John: No, no. He's in the infirmary now. All right? And I'll make sure they're kept apart when he's brought back.",
        "Marty: Thank you. I suppose Todd's still claiming that he didn't push me.",
        "John: He's accusing everyone and their brother.",
        "Marty: Um... there's something you need to know.",
        "Marty: You need to know that...",
        "Natalie: Fine. You want the truth? I meant what I said. If it weren't for the baby, John would be with me.",
        "Marty: I...um... sorry for the way I reacted when you said you wanted to try for another baby, 'cause I know that came from your heart. I just don't think that we're in the position right now to think about something like that.",

        "Viki: Clint and I need to talk to you about Jessica.",
        "Marty: Okay, sure. Do you want to meet somewhere?",
        "Viki: Oh! Um, how about the Palace?",
        "Marty: Fine. Give me 20 minutes. Okay. Bye. I have to go.",
        "John: Is everything okay?",
        "Marty: Well, it's about Jessica. I need to know what's going on.",
        "John: Are you okay?",

        "Natalie: I wrote a letter to John. You know, I was too chicken to say it to his face, so I poured my heart out into the page, and I sealed it up in an envelope and I left it in his office.",
        "Brody: That is brave.",
        "Natalie: My God, what was I thinking? And to listen to Roxy of all people?",
        "Brody: Sometimes Roxy hits the nail right on the head.",
        "Natalie: And sometimes she bashes your thumb.",
        "Brody: She told me to keep fighting for Jessica. What was that, nail or thumb?",
        "Natalie: You and Jessica are different.",
        "Brody: Are we? Right now, Jess isn't any more available to me than John is to you. Does that mean I should stop trying to win her back?",

        "Carlotta: Oh, no. It's okay. I know what's going on. Jessica's confused. She still looks at Cristian the way she did when they were young.",
        "Layla: Except it's not the way Jessica looks at Cris that's bothering me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: This is crazy. I'm not swearing on my mom's life.",
        "Jessica: Because you can't. Because if you weren't jealous you would have no problem saying it. I mean, they're just words, Cris. Go ahead, say them. I was right. You are jealous. And the only reason that a person gets jealous is when they want something for themselves or someone.",
        "Cristian: Don't put words in my mouth, Jess. I never said anything like that.",
        "Jessica: I didn't have to. Your silence told me everything I need to know. Well, I better go get ready for the prom. See you later.",

        "Dorian: She's not here for you. Yes, and you're early.",
        "Reed: Just a few minutes.",
        "Dorian: When we first met, you implied that yours was a casual business relationship with Kelly. I've since found out it was a bit more than that.",
        "Reed: I assure you, Mayor Lord, I was completely sincere. I didn't get to know Kelly very well in London, and I'm looking forward to having that opportunity here.",
        "Dorian: Then let me begin your education. Kelly has an aunt who cares about her very much. And if you want to get to know her better, I'm going to have to get to know you better. Come in.",

        "John: Yeah, I just got the report. I was about to call you.",
        "Kelly: Okay, what did it say?",
        "John: Heart attack. He died by natural causes.",
        "Kelly: Wait a minute. That's impossible. Rodney came to my office perfectly healthy, ready to tell me what was going on with my mom's death. I left him for 5 minutes, and he turned up dead. That had to be murder, just like my mom.",
        "John: Not according to the report.",
        "Kelly: Okay. So what does that mean?",
        "John: Well, to the department, that means case is closed. My hands are officially tied.",

        "John: Officially I can't answer that.",
        "Kelly: Look, don't even think about it. I'm gonna see you tomorrow, and we're gonna talk about what our next move is, okay?",

        "Clint: Ever since she came out of her surgery, it's all she can think about.",
        "Marty: I know. Well, there's something about this particular rite of passage that's connected to why she's stuck where she is emotionally and mentally.",
        "Viki: I know. You suspect that the near rape by Mitch was the reason that she's gone to this more innocent time in her life, right?",
        "Marty: Right. And the prom is significant because it's the night she was planning on losing that innocence by making love for the first time.",
        "Clint: And Jessie wants to be innocent, but then again she wants to lose the innocence? Which is it?",
        "Marty: I think she's trying to alter past events in order to change her present.",
        "Viki: So by trying to re-create the night that she was hoping to lose her virginity to Cristian...",
        "Marty: She may be unconsciously trying to connect sex to love instead of violence. And it's a good thing. If she's able to do that, she might be able to recover her memories.",

        "Kelly: Yes, yes. Listen, I'm gonna call you, and we're gonna get together, and we're gonna have a good long girl talk, just like we used to. But you're right. I have to run. I have a date.",

        "Natalie: Yes. What part of \"flee the jurisdiction\" don't you understand? I don't want to face John. Are you kidding? Oh, my God! I mean, writing a letter. How desperate is that?",
        "Brody: No more desperate than me swamping Jessica with mementos of our time together. I would do it all again if I thought it would work.",

        "Reed: I will find a way to liberate us from your bodyguard before the night is out, and then I can have you all to myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Jessica won't find what she thinks she's looking for with Cristian. But something about being in that environment with Brody, the man she loved until Mitch tried to violate her, it might catalyze a fusion of her two worlds.",

        "Clint: Yeah, it seems like we're putting as much pressure on prom night as Jessica is.",
        "Marty: I know, and nothing may happen. I mean, I can't promise you anything is gonna change for Jessica tonight, and I imagine it's not gonna be easy for her, but it is a significant night in her life. And I guess my advice to you two is to let it play out.",

        "Roxy: Bye. You better watch out for that guy, Jessie. He is a real player.",
        "Jessica: Oh! I'm not interested in Ford, although I am really grateful to the guy. Thanks to him, Cristian just basically admitted he still has feelings for me.",
