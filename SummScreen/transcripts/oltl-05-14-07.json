        "John: Hey. How's Jessica doing?",
        "Natalie: We still don't know. We're waiting on the results from the liver biopsy. But the good news is, this little one here -- she doesn't have the virus.",
        "John: That is good news.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I don't think Jessica could have lived with herself. Mom said that Mike kicked everybody out of Jessica's room so she could get some rest.",
        "John: Yeah, well, mike can a tough customer.",
        "Natalie: Yes, he can. Well, look how tough he was on you when you were in recovery.",
        "John: Yeah, so much for brotherly love, right?",
        "Natalie: I -- I was hard on you, too. I said a lot of things, and I'm sorry.",
        "John: Don't apologize. I can be pretty tough to deal with myself.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you're pretty stubborn.",
        "John: You should know. And I was -- I was a real jerk at that time, you know? But I know why you did what you did.",
        "Natalie: Because I loved you. I still do. I mean, I don't want to, but I do.",
        "John: I know the feeling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're not eating. That's not like you.",
        "Clint: Too worried about Jessica. Are you?",
        "Viki: What kind of a question is that? Of course, I am. Why would you even ask me that?",
        "Clint: Well, you didn't seem to have a problem here.",
        "Viki: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mrs. Jennings: If you want something that isn't on the menu, let us know.",
        "Blake: We'll have the chef prepare it for you.",
        "Britney: I'm not hungry.",
        "Blake: You have to eat, Britney.",
        "Mrs. Jennings: You've been through an ordeal, dear, but it's over now. And the best way to forget about that dreadful boy, Henry, is to get back to living a normal life.",
        "Britney: My life is never going to be normal again.",
        "Blake: Oh, stop being so dramatic. Now, choose something for dinner, or we'll choose it for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hey. Oh, my gosh, I love your necklace.",
        "Marcie: Oh, thanks. It's an early mommy's day present.",
        "Starr: Mother's Day -- I completely forgot about it.",
        "Marcie: Ok. It's ok. You still have plenty of time. It's on Sunday.",
        "Starr: Right. \u0096 Well someone and said that you needed to see me.",
        "Marcie: Yes. I finally finished casting the musical, and I just posted the list.",
        "Starr: Are you saying that I got a part?",
        "Marcie: Well, why don't you just look and see for yourself?",
        "Starr: No. No, there's no way that I can play that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on bar]",
        "Dorian: Pardon me.",
        "Bartender: Dr. Lord, right?",
        "Dorian: Right. Menu, please. I need to pick up some food for my niece.",
        "Bartender: Sure. But don't you have flunkies to do that for you?",
        "Miles: Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Miles. Well, what brings you here?",
        "Miles: Ah, Rodi's famous hamburgers. I love them. You know, I'm glad I ran into you.",
        "Dorian: I don't have time to chat. All I have on my mind right now is getting some food for my grandniece, so excuse me. Where's that menu, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: So page me as soon as you get those test results.",
        "Bo: How is she? Is there any change?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: What, are you annoyed because I ate my dinner?",
        "Clint: No, of course not. I'm just wonder--",
        "Viki: Clint, I was hungry, ok? I've been at the hospital all day long. You can't eat the cafeteria food. It's disgusting. I have a heart condition. I'm supposed to take care of myself. I cannot be there for Jessica if I'm sick. And neither can you.",
        "Clint: Well, I don't think my skipping one meal's going to make me incapable of being strong for my daughter.",
        "Viki: What, are you trying to make me feel guilty because I ate food?",
        "Clint: I'm just trying to make conversation.",
        "Viki: Make conversation? No, I don't think so. You want to make conversation, fine. Let's talk about -- ooh, let's talk about the election. That'll be fun.",
        "Clint: I don't think I'm up for that tonight, I'm sorry to say.",
        "Viki: Look, I have to concentrate on being positive, ok? I have to believe that Jessica will survive this.",
        "Clint: I'd like to believe that, too, but I can't put on a happy face when I'm worried sick. And I'm not inclined to wishful thinking the way you are.",
        "Viki: No, of course not, because you need people to tell you definitively and unequivocally that Jessica will be fine. You want assurances. They can't give you that. Nobody can. So you might just as well eat your dinner and get some sleep, or you'll give yourself a stroke.",
        "Clint: Is that more wishful thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Look, I'll eat later when I get home, ok? But I just want to go back to school right now.",
        "Blake: School? Why?",
        "Britney: Mrs. McBain is going to post the cast list for the musical today.",
        "Blake: That ridiculous musical, what a waste of time.",
        "Britney: Not to me.",
        "Mrs. Jennings: Darling, we know you love to sing, and that's all well and good. But loving it doesn't make you talented. If it did, I'd be a prima ballerina.",
        "Blake: And I'd be independently wealthy.",
        "Mrs. Jennings: There must be dozens of girls who can sing better than you do. Why put yourself through the humiliation?",
        "Britney: It sounds fun.",
        "Mrs. Jennings: Humiliation?",
        "Britney: No, the musical. I want to have some real fun for a change, especially after what happened with Henry.",
        "Mrs. Jennings: Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, you should be angry that your teachers didn't realize how dangerous that boy was.",
        "Britney: I jerked him around.",
        "Blake: Well, your mistake wasn't getting someone else to do your paper for you. It was choosing someone who was so seriously disturbed.",
        "Mrs. Jennings: And now you've ruined your own reputation.",
        "Britney: Oh -- oh, no. What if I get rejected from the debutante committee?",
        "Blake: That's enough, young lady. Protecting your family's name is very important.",
        "Mrs. Jennings: Britney, your father and I don't want to upset you. I mean, we know you've been traumatized.",
        "Blake: But we think you should move on. Living in the past is not productive.",
        "Britney: Fine, I'll try to move on, ok? And the best way for me to do that is to be in the musical. You don't have to come if you're too embarrassed, but I need to go see what part I got. Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep all night. I promise, I'll be home. Please?",
        "Blake: Very well. Go. But don't co back late.",
        "Britney: I won't, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Mrs. McBain, there is no way that I can play the lead role.",
        "Marcie: Yes, you can. You gave the best audition.",
        "Starr: Better than Britney?",
        "Marcie: Yeah -- this isn't a competition, Starr, it's a learning experience, ok? She was good. You were better. She'll be great as your understudy.",
        "Starr: \"Understudy\"? Britney's going to be my understudy? That is not going to fly well with her.",
        "Marcie: Well, you know, that's too bad. She can turn it down if she wants to.",
        "Starr: Well, I can turn it down, too, right?",
        "Marcie: But -- but why? Why would you do that?",
        "Starr: You know why.",
        "Marcie: Cole.",
        "Starr: Yeah. I can't be around him.",
        "Marcie: You're already around him, Starr. You go to the same school.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but this is going to make it even worse.",
        "Marcie: It'll be fine. I promise you. You and Cole have hardly any scenes together.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Starr: Excuse me. It's my Aunt Dorian.",
        "Marcie: Good. Why don't you get it? I'm going to make my getaway.",
        "Starr: Ok. Aunt Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Starr, darling, I am here at Rodi's, d I just want to be sure. Now, you wanted a hamburger and pomme frites, oui?",
        "Starr: Yeah, that's great.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but what would you like on your hamburger? I know you said \"the works,\" but I don't want to assume too much about the staff's intelligence.",
        "Starr: No, you know what? Just -- just forget about it. I'm here with Mrs. McBain, and I don't know how much longer I'm going to be.",
        "Dorian: At school? Oh! Is it about the musical?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Darling, I am so glad that you're involved with that. It's something to keep your mind off of what's happening with your father.",
        "Starr: You know, um, I really got to go, aunt Dorian. I'll grab something on the way home.",
        "Dorian: Goodbye, Cheri. Oh. Ah. Sorry I won't be ordering, after all.",
        "Bartender: No problem.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. All right. What do you want? I don't have too much time, so make it fast.",
        "Miles: I just was going to ask you if you've heard from Blair, and if she had any luck finding out what happened to Todd.",
        "Dorian: No, and no.",
        "Miles: Oh. I'm really worried, for both of them.",
        "Dorian: So am I. Excuse me.",
        "Miles: Should I call her?",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Miles: Blair.",
        "Dorian: Oh, really? Why would she want to hear from you? You are the man who's responsible for the fact that Todd went chasing off to -- to Chicago, into what was obviously a trap.",
        "Miles: That came from Spencer. All I did was relay the information to Todd that I found in Spencer's letter.",
        "Dorian: Without verifying its veracity.",
        "Miles: I had no way of doing that.",
        "Dorian: But you did know that Spencer didn't wish Todd any good, or didn't you get to that yet in the chapter about deductive reasoning in the new book of human experience?",
        "Miles: Oh. Just because I'm not jaded and cynical?",
        "Dorian: I can't debate with you. I really don't have the time.",
        "Miles: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: The fact remains, motives aside, you're the one who is responsible for Todd going to Chicago. You are responsible for his disappearance. And it is, all of it, on your head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: A part of me will always love you.",
        "John: Yeah, me, too. I mean, I feel that way about you. Probably, but --",
        "Natalie: \"Probably\"?",
        "John: Oh, look, I'm not -- I'm not good at this kind of talk.",
        "Natalie: I know. I know.",
        "Natalie: Whee.",
        "John: Holding a pink bag. I can't believe how big she's getting.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I know. She's already trying to talk, too. She calls me \"anwa.\"",
        "John: \"Anwa\"?",
        "Natalie: For \"Aunt Natalie.\"",
        "John: Ah.",
        "Natalie: Don't you, Breezy? Who am I? Tell John, who am I? I guess she's not going to do it.",
        "John: No, she's not going to do it, no. You're really good with kids.",
        "Natalie: This one makes it easy, don't you, sweetie?",
        "John: I don't think I'm too good with kids.",
        "Natalie: Oh, please, you are such a liar. I've seen you with Tommy.",
        "John: Ah, Tommy's special. Like his dad.",
        "Natalie: Well, you know, the trick to being good with kids is to be their friend. You're a pretty good friend to those that you care about.",
        "John: Yeah -- I don't have a regrets.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, me, neither.",
        "John: Well, Bree, that's some hair you've got.",
        "[Natalie laughs]",
        "John: Well, it was really nice seeing you again. And I hope your mommy gets better.",
        "Natalie: That's what we're all praying for.",
        "John: Yeah. Uh --",
        "[Bree babbles]",
        "John: Everybody down at the station -- they -- they miss you.",
        "Natalie: I miss them, too. But you know I -- I had to leave, for a lot of reasons.",
        "[Bree babbles]",
        "John: That's my cue. I'll see you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Britney -- big mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Nash -- is that you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: I don't need any caffeine. I barely had a sip of that wine.",
        "Cole: There's no way I was going to leave you in the park alone.",
        "Britney: What the hell do you care?",
        "Cole: Look, Britney, we're all freaked about what happened with Henry.",
        "Britney: It's not just that, all right?",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Britney: Nothing, you' it's lame.",
        "Cole: Maybe, maybe not.",
        "Britney: It's my stupid parents, all right? Acting like the reason Henry lost it was because the school screwed up and didn't realize he was so insane.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I heard them talking to the reporters outside the school.",
        "Britney: Yeah, and they got into a huge fight with Principal Wexler. I mean, I'm going to have a target on my back from now on. I get caught with a latte on school grounds, I'll probably be suspended.",
        "Cole: You're not responsible for the fact that your parents are \u0096",
        "Britney: Greedy?",
        "Cole: I wasn't going to say that.",
        "Britney: Don't worry about it. They're totally greedy. If they could sue Henry's parents, I bet they would.",
        "Cole: Oh, come on, they're not that sick.",
        "Britney: You have no idea. I'm a pariah.",
        "Cole: You're head cheerleader. That hardly qualifies.",
        "Britney: Cole, the other day, you said I wasn't innocent -- you know, about Henry. It wasn't my fault.",
        "Cole: It's nobody's fault.",
        "Britney: Except Henry'.",
        "Cole: Especially not Henry. Henry -- Henry's mind was all messed up on drugs. I mean, if I get less than eight hours of sleep, I can't think straight. He went two weeks. I can't imagine what was going through his head.",
        "Britney: I don't think you want to know.",
        "Cole: Britney, don't listen to anybody. All right? You might have set Henry off, but he had a lot worse problems than you. I know that, Starr knows that, and nobody else was in that car.",
        "Britney: Thanks. I just -- I don't ever want to be that scared again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I would like to hear you sing one of your songs in the show. Now come on.",
        "Langston: I bet you really hate me now for signing you up for the musical, ms. \"Starr\" of the musical.",
        "Starr: I cannot believe this.",
        "Langston: I've got a song for you. Want to hear it?",
        "Starr: Well, I guess I have no choice, do I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Hi, baby Bree. Hi. Can I take you? Yeah, I'm your Uncle miles -- whoa, boy! Hey, sweetie. Whoo. You know what? When you get a little older, I am going to spoil you rotten. Rotten, I say. As long as it's ok with your parents, ok? Huh? Any news on Jessica?",
        "Natalie: Actually, we're still waiting on the test results.",
        "Miles: Oh.",
        "Natalie: But --",
        "Miles: You must be really worried.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, that's an understatement.",
        "Miles: So many people in trouble. I mean, Jessica, Blair and Todd. But that's -- that's much worse.",
        "Natalie: Worse than Jessica being sick?",
        "Miles: That didn't sound right. Uh -- it's worse for me. That's not what I meant, either. What am I trying to say? Um -- what I'm saying is, if Todd is dead, I can't help but feel responsible.",
        "Natalie: Would you stop beating yourself up?",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: You did the right thing by giving Todd the information. To withhold it would have been wrong.",
        "Miles: That's what Marty told me.",
        "Natalie: Well, I guess in this case, she would have been right. But in the future, Marty Saybrooke is the last person you want to take advice from.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What are you doing in here?",
        "Marty: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: So do you want to hang out or something?",
        "Cole: Uh -- I'm sorry, I can't. Langston called, and said the cast list was posted for the musical, so I'm heading over to the school now.",
        "Britney: Did she say what part Starr got?",
        "Cole: No, I -- I don't even think she knows yet.",
        "Britney: Of course she does. Langston's the writer.",
        "Cole: She just said to go check it out. Aren't you curious?",
        "Britney: I'm not really in the mood to go back to that building right now, let alone see people. Cole, I -- I feel like I should do something, you know, to show you how grateful I am for not blaming me for what happened to Henry.",
        "Cole: Just try to be nicer to everybody. Everybody. Not just your sidekicks.",
        "Britney: Ok, I'll try.",
        "Cole: You going to be all right?",
        "Britney: Sure, thanks. Hey, Cole? Even though she broke up with you, you're -- you're still in love with Starr, aren't you?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Britney: More than ever, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Are you insane? I don't wish you any harm. I was merely suggesting you take care of yourself.",
        "Clint: Well, I'd suggest you stop worrying about me and put your focus on our daughter.",
        "Viki: There you go again. What are you insinuating?",
        "Clint: Nothing! Ah, this whole conversation has been one big misunderstanding and a waste of time. Why don't we just get the check?",
        "Dorian: Hello.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Oh, am I interrupting something?",
        "Clint: Yes, you are, but that's ok.",
        "Viki: Huh, talk about a total waste of time --",
        "Dorian: Excuse me?",
        "Clint: Jessica is resting and we're waiting on the results for her liver biopsy.",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes. And of course, I hope and pray that it'll be all right.",
        "Clint: Thank you very much. Would -- would you care to join us? You wouldn't mind, would you?",
        "Viki: Are you kidding?",
        "Dorian: Oh, I hope you're not leaving on my account.",
        "Viki: No. No, I'm not leaving, Dorian. I'm moving, to a better table. And yes, it's because of you. Thank you so much for dinner, Clint. Sorry I ate it.",
        "Clint: That didn't go well, so I'm not sorry it's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: What do you think?",
        "Starr: It was so beautiful.",
        "Langston: Thanks.",
        "Starr: Really, I had no idea that you could write stuff like that.",
        "Langston: You want to try singing it?",
        "Starr: Well, I don't think that I could.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no, it'll be fine. Come on, just do the best you can.",
        "Langston: It's called \"fly to you.\" Come on, I'll lead you through.",
        "Starr: Ok. I put so much into this little dream I had I swear to you I could almost taste and touch peace would last",
        "Britney: Oh -- Starr got the lead? Oh -- student number three and Starr's understudy. Oh, God, just when I thought life couldn't suck anymore.",
        "Starr: And no regrets whatever the world does to me I'll fly to you in this world of subtlety and envy at least there was a time for you and me like a summer song like there's nothing wrong I'll fly to you that one part -- it was ok?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Yeah, it's me. I had to see you. Should I get a doctor?",
        "Jessica: No -- no pain. I'm just ashamed.",
        "Nash: Ah, Jessica --",
        "Jessica: No. My God, heroin -- what kind of person am I?",

        "Jessica: No, and the funny thing is I have a -- a hazy memory of it.",
        "Nash: It doesn't matter, not to me. I love you. And there's nothing that you could've done in the past or that you could do now or that you could ever do in the future that would change the way I feel about you. I love you. I love you.",

        "Clint: And during this fundraiser, he discussed his ex-wives with you, huh?",
        "Dorian: I don't know -- the subject came up somehow. I'm not sure.",

        "Natalie: Oh, yeah, like doing my laundry, cleaning out my closet, maybe crying myself to sleep if I'm lucky, but I guess I'll sacrifice so I can spend a little time with you.",

        "Natalie: But only if you promise to make me laugh, ok?",

        "Starr: No. Um -- actually, I think I'm going to stay here and go over the song a little bit. I like singing in the gym -- it has great acoustics.",

        "Viki: Oh, come on -- \"no more love.\" What if the perfect woman came along?",
        "Peter: Well, she's late. I'm not ruling out marriage, though -- just love. I hear that divorce is a piece of cake when you're not emotionally involved.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Do you think that maybe -- hmm --",
        "Clint: Viki? No, no, no, no. This is Viki pretending to be optimistic about Jessica's condition when she's actually scared to death.",
        "Dorian: Oh, so being rude and angry is her way of dealing with the tension?",
        "Clint: Yeah, yeah, and it's totally the wrong way. It would be so much easier for everybody involved if she would just admit to herself how she actually feels.",

        "Dorian: But you said yourself, it's a way of dealing with the tension.",
        "Clint: I know, but she has a way of -- where'd she go, anyway?",
        "Dorian: She left -- with Peter. Speaking of which -- why don't you come home with me? We can have a few drinks and then --",

        "Dorian: I'm pretty sure if you came home with me, I could get you in the mood.",
        "Clint: Yeah? It's -- I'm afraid that if I went over to your place, I'd just fall apart, and for Jessie's sake, I can't do that.",

        "Natalie: You know what? I wouldn't mind messing with Marty's head a little bit more -- try that jealousy thing one more time?",

        "Cole: I'm -- I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? Star well, you can pray that he comes home safe. God, this whole situation is so weird. I know that there are a lot of people that are there for me, but for some reason, I -- I feel like I going through all of this alone.",
