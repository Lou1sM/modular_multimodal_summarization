        "Matthew: He sang at your wedding?",
        "Bo: No, he married us, too. He did. He's a preacher. You know, see, now that's something that you have to try to top when you get married. Which one is, um, is this one Mom and me, here?",

        "Charlie: Well, I've, uh, heard a lot about you, David.",
        "David: Did you hear I was on television? You know, it's funny, I haven't heard a word about you. I'm not sure that you deserve this woman.",

        "Viki: Yeah, shacked up, not so much, no, no. David stayed with me here at Llanfair one of the many times Dorian threw him out. David, what are you doing here? Last I heard, you had a lottery ticket that I gave you and you were on your way doing something wonderful.",
        "David: Aren't you listening? I did do something wonderful. I was on television, and it was all thanks to you. That lottery ticket you gave me turned out to be my lucky charm, but I lost it. And when I did, I lost my lucky streak with it.",
        "Viki: A reversal of fortune. How unusual for you. And?",
        "David: Well, I went back to the place that the original ticket came from and tried to get myself another winner.",
        "Viki: You went back to Paris, Texas?",
        "David: I went back and lived out the dream that you had for me. I got a job at your old stomping grounds.",

        "Viki: David, you were actually working at the diner?",
        "David: Well, it wasn't that bad. It's not like they made me wear a hairnet or anything. I was working there until yesterday.",
        "Viki: Till yesterday? Well, did you see Natalie?",
        "David: Natalie was at the Bon-Jour? Well, that's too bad. She and I could have caught up. Hey, she doesn't happen to be here now, does she?",

        "Nigel: Apparently. I'm enormously relieved, I must say, telling all those lies, pretending you're a Buchanan. It's taken its toll on me these past months, but now, finally, the charade is over. I couldn't be more pleased.",

        "[Jessica laughs]",
        "Nash: Since when did you learn how to cook?",
        "Jessica: Hey, I'm a great cook, ask Bree. She thinks that my mac and cheese is the best in town.",
        "Nash: How is Bree?",
        "Jessica: She's a little bit worse. I think we're going to have to skip that wedding.",
        "Nash: Oh, no, you're kidding me.",
        "Jessica: Hey, weddings are fun.",
        "Nash: Nuh-uh, last night was fun. You were a wildcat.",
        "Jessica: It must have been all those virgin coladas.",
        "Nash: I'm calling Ultraviolet now for the recipe.",
        "Jessica: No, no, Nash, don't -- don't you dare.",
        "Nash: I like having crazy sex with my wife, sue me.",
        "Jessica: Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I guess it is true that, uh, you know, a lot of couples do get divorced, marriages end in divorce, but, you know, most couples do stay married their whole lives.",
        "Matthew: Not most, Dad.",
        "Bo: Well, I don't know the exact statistics.",
        "Matthew: 40% of first marriages and 50% of second marriages end in divorce.",
        "Bo: So, what, have you been doing some research, huh?",
        "Matthew: I've seen a few things online.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, those -- those numbers are depressing, but I still believe that two people can, uh, love each other their whole lives. They can stay married. They can be each other's best friend and raise their kids together. I do believe that. And that's the kind of love that I hope that you find someday.",

        "Bo: I heard you two were in Texas.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Texas.",
        "Bo: I didn't realize that Buchanan Enterprises had any business down there that needed to be taken care of.",
        "Jared: Oh, uh, just doing a little damage control.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "[Nigel sighs]",
        "Bo: Are you okay, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: Oh, what could be wrong, Sir?",
        "Bo: I don't know, you just have that look on your face.",
        "Nigel: Indigestion.",
        "Jared: Anyways, we were just, you know, assuring our people down there that their jobs are secure, that the Jenkins take-over attempt was just a rumor.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Okay, good idea.",
        "Jared: Yeah, I know I should have sent you a memo before we left.",

        "Matthew: Yeah.",

        "[Jared laughs]",
        "Natalie: All right.",
        "[Natalie chuckles]",
        "Natalie: Nigel, you cannot be making faces like that. Uncle Bo is already on to you, and now he knows you know something.",
        "Nigel: I have kept this secret for months, and I will continue to do so. The question is, given the altered nature of your relationship, can you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Adriana: What happened last night, besides the obvious?",
        "Brody: You got my text. I went to that carriage house and saw Gigi and Shane.",
        "Adriana: I paid you to go inside.",
        "Brody: All right, I was just about to knock when I heard someone coming, so I ducked out of sight.",
        "Adriana: Did you see who it was?",
        "[Brody sighs]",
        "Adriana: Answer me.",

        "Shane: Are you mad at me?",
        "Gigi: Honey, why would I be mad at you?",
        "Shane: For bringing up my dad again.",
        "Gigi: Shane, honey, I know how much you think about him. I don't blame you.",
        "Shane: You think about him, too, right? Isn't that why you get sad when other people get married, because you and Dad would have gotten married, too, right, if he didn't die?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, that does make me sad.",
        "Shane: Remember what you always tell me when I go places and everyone has a dad except for me?",
        "Gigi: I tell you that you're not alone, that you have me, and that we have each other.",
        "Shane: Doesn't that make you feel better, too?",
        "Gigi: Yes, it makes me feel so much better.",
        "[Shane coughs]",
        "Gigi: I don't like that cough.",
        "Shane: I'll take my medicine. So will you please go to the wedding with me?",

        "Gigi: Yes -- yes, I will. I would be proud to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Something important -- let me guess. Woody Allen is my real father and I have two identical triplet brothers, Tex and Dex, now both living in Tittybong, Australia, which, by the way, is an actual city.",
        "Roxy: Hey, I'm working on something serious here.",
        "Rex: I'm -- I'm sorry, please, go on, tell me.",
        "Roxy: You know, I've got a serious mojo going on here. Listen, I just want to tell you something. I want to tell you that I'm so proud of the way that you turned out. And having you for a kid has made me feel like my life isn't a total waste.",
        "Rex: Oh, Rox.",
        "Roxy: I look at that face and I think so many people love you and respect you. I couldn't be a loser if I gave birth to someone like you.",
        "Rex: Well, there's a lot of you in me, people say it all the time.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but I know I did a lot of things wrong and I never should have given you to Wally's sister in Michigan. But I must have done something right, cause look at you. You're such a great guy.",
        "Rex: You always told me to follow my heart, and that advice has made all the difference, I swear.",
        "Roxy: Really?",
        "Rex: Really.",
        "Roxy: Listen, I know that you love Adriana so much, but I just wanted to tell you today how much I love you.",
        "Rex: I love you, too, Rox. I'm proud of you.",

        "Marcie: No.",
        "Gigi: Adriana made me borrow it. I have a plain, navy blue dress. I'm going to put that on.",

        "Gigi: I would feel so much better.",
        "Marcie: No, you look gorgeous.",
        "Gigi: I feel ridiculous.",
        "Marcie: You look fabulous, and I am relieved to see you getting ready for this wedding because I was a little worried about you last night.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry I laid all that stuff on you.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no, come on. How many hours did you listen to me in Texas go on? We're friends, that is what we do for each other.",
        "Gigi: Thanks. I'm only going to the wedding for Shane. He wants to be there for Rex.",
        "Marcie: You're such a good mom, you know that? Ooh, hey, is -- is this him? Is this Shane's dad?",
        "Gigi: Shane found it inside of a book.",
        "Marcie: He's really handsome.",
        "Gigi: Oh, yeah.",
        "Marcie: Shane must look like one of his grandparents then, right?",
        "Gigi: Why do you say that?",
        "Marcie: Well, I mean, he doesn't look like you and he really doesn't look like his dad, so -- what? What did I say?",
        "Gigi: No, nothing. It's just I see so much of Shane's dad in him, it's scary. Especially when I see them together.",
        "Marcie: Together?",
        "Gigi: In my mind is what I meant. I don't know -- I don't know what I'm saying.",
        "Marcie: No, you really do know what you're saying, Gigi. That guy Brody, he doesn't look like Shane because he isn't Shane's father, is he?",
        "Gigi: Rex is",

        "Natalie: Nigel, we -- we can totally -- we can totally play it cool.",
        "Nigel: The way you played it cool over there at the gate?",
        "Jared: That's not going to happen again.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, and honestly, we're only going to keep this secret a little while longer.",
        "Jared: Just until we figure out exactly how we're going to break the news.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, 'cause it kind of got a little more complicated than I thought.",
        "Jared: And, Nigel, you're covered. I will tell them that I forced you to go along with my plan.",
        "Nigel: You couldn't force me to do anything, sir. I went along with you to protect the family from learning who the real heir is. And while I'm relieved that your scheme is coming to an end, I realize that opens the door to the potentially catastrophic discovery that Mr. Buchanan's true blood son is David Vickers.",

        "Viki: No, Natalie's on a business trip with Jared Buchanan.",
        "David: Jared Buchanan?",

        "Jared: So did Clint and Bo have this guy checked out?",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah, they did a DNA test.",
        "David: Hmm, and did the family welcome him with open arms?",
        "Viki: Not at first, no. But you know what? Jared has proved himself.",
        "David: Hmm, fascinating. So this, uh, this newest Buchanan, where exactly does he reside?",
        "Viki: Oh, at Asa's.",
        "David: Moved right in, did he?",
        "Viki: David, for the fourth time, what are you doing here? Have you been to see Dorian? Oh, well, of course you're here for Adriana's wedding.",
        "David: Yep, that's it, Adriana's wedding.",
        "Viki: Well, I hate to eat and run, but we all need to get ready, you know.",

        "Viki: Yeah.",

        "[David chuckles]",
        "David: I'll, uh, catch you kids at the church. Oh, Charlie, have you and Viki had video and popcorn night under the flower comforter?",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm not exactly sure what you mean.",
        "David: Good.",

        "Brody: I watched them through the window. They were just talking, then Shane came down. After a couple of minutes, Rex left. Actually, Gigi threw him out.",
        "Adriana: Well, why didn't you go in after Rex left?",
        "Brody: I thought about it, but --",
        "Adriana: But what?",
        "Brody: Look, it's your wedding day. Shouldn't you be getting into your dress or something?",
        "Adriana: But what, Brody?",
        "Brody: I didn't go in because Gigi was crying.",
        "Adriana: Over Rex.",

        "Marcie: Shane is Rex's son?",
        "Gigi: Keep your voice down.",
        "Marcie: Well, does he know?",
        "Gigi: No, he has no idea.",
        "Marcie: Well, why not? Gigi, why are you lying to him all this time?",
        "Gigi: I did it for Shane. Marcie, Rex disappeared. He didn't want me, why would he want a baby? And then Brody came into my life. He was a good guy. He didn't care that I was pregnant by someone else. He wanted me. He said he wanted to be a father to my baby. And then he shipped out, and his mom called and said he had been killed, so I decided to turn something horrible into something wonderful for my son. I gave him a father he could be proud of.",
        "Marcie: I know, but, honey, it's not the truth. It's a story. Brody isn't his father. I think Shane needs to know that, who his father is, and Rex needs to know that that little boy is his son.",
        "Gigi: No, Marcie, you cannot tell Rex. You have to promise me you will never tell him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Whoa! What, are you going to a wedding or something?",
        "Bo: What, you're not ready, yet?",
        "Rex: Sorry, sorry, slow start this morning.",
        "Matthew: Hey, is it okay if I check my e-mail? A friend is supposed to send me something.",
        "Rex: Uh, sure, go for it.",
        "Bo: His friend's name is Courtney. He wants to check his e-mail about every five minutes now.",
        "Rex: I can relate.",
        "Bo: Yeah. So how's the hangover?",
        "Rex: Um, well, aside from seeing double and wanting to throw up things I ate as a small child, I'm swell.",
        "Bo: Well, hey, two Adrianas, twice as beautiful, right?",
        "Rex: Good point.",
        "Bo: Well, Matthew and I had a little talk about marriage a while ago.",
        "Rex: Oh, yeah?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Rex: Him and Courtney thinking about tying the knot?",
        "Bo: Hopefully not, but no, he's wondering why anybody would want to get married because he says the odds of it not working out are pretty high.",
        "Rex: You trying to cheer me up, Bo?",
        "Bo: No, no, no, I'm telling you this because we also talked about how great marriage is. You find the right person, and you know that you're really ready to share the rest of your life with that person, you know? Because you can't have any doubts.",
        "Rex: What are you trying to tell me here, Bo? Are you saying that I shouldn't get married?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: So if we're not going to go to that wedding, what are we going to do all day?",
        "Jessica: Well --",
        "Nash: Well --",
        "Jessica: Snoop gave me a copy of his cd.",
        "Nash: Uh-huh.",
        "Jessica: And I thought maybe we could put that on, and --",
        "Nash: And?",
        "Jessica: I don't know, mix up a batch of those virgin coladas and see what happens.",
        "Nash: Okay, I will go get the blender right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I think you're overreacting, Balsom.",
        "Rex: No, no, I'm reacting to your seriously depressing warnings about marriage.",
        "Bo: No, I didn't say anything about you and Adriana.",
        "Rex: True, you just said no one in their right minds should think about getting married, because odds are it's not going to work.",
        "Bo: No, that's not what I said. You see, what I said is, I believe in marriages, but marriages take work. You change, she changes. You know, it's a natural thing. That means you're growing, you're maturing. So it also means that sometimes you have to, I don't know, renegotiate the terms. But believe me, I think it's a beautiful thing to be ready to make a commitment like that to somebody, you know. Especially if you're planning to have kids. Kids need to feel that they are part of a family.",
        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Bo: Balsom, is something bothering you?",
        "Rex: Why should anything be bothering me? Aside from the fact that I'm getting married today, and I still can't face solid food.",
        "[Bo laughs]",
        "Bo: Okay, alright. Is there anything you need, anything I can do for you? Like check a car service? Anything at all.",
        "Rex: No, Adriana's got it all together.",
        "Bo: All right, then. I guess I better get to the church.",
        "Rex: I just need to get dressed, pick up Charlie, and --",
        "[Whistles]",
        "Bo: Yo, Matthew, you ready to roll, bud?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, hold on.",
        "Bo: Okay, \"hold on.\" Okay, look, I got the rings. All you have to do, you remember to give the priest a copy of your vows, okay? You wrote them, right? Hmm?",
        "Rex: Vows. Yeah, I wrote them. That's crucial stuff, the vows.",
        "Bo: We'll see you in church, Balsom.",
        "Matthew: See you.",
        "Rex: Yeah, thanks for stopping by. Vows. Vows. Vows, vows, vows, vows, vows. Okay.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Adriana, I pledge -- pledge -- pledge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I will get the when I get there. No -- just leave me alone. My mother is freaking.",
        "Brody: You better get going.",
        "Adriana: Not until I have your solemn promise that you are going to hold up your end of the deal. You got a lot of money for this, Brody, okay? And you're not doing anything wrong. Gigi needs someone, and you're going to be that someone. You're going to give her son a father. You're a hero, right? So act like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You have to tell him the truth.",
        "Gigi: I can't. He's getting married today.",
        "Marcie: He has a son.",
        "Gigi: Don't you get it, Marcie? I don't want Rex to come to me out of guilt. Besides, he's made his decision.",
        "Marcie: His decision?",
        "Gigi: To marry Adriana.",
        "Marcie: Okay, what about your son, hmm? What about Shane? Doesn't he deserve to know who his father is?",
        "Gigi: Did Tommy? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I did not mean that, I really --",
        "Marcie: No, it's -- you are right, okay? You're right. But Rex, he's not Todd. He's decent, and he's kind he's loving, and he would make such a terrific father.",
        "Gigi: Shane worships Brody's memory. How can I just take that away from him?",
        "Marcie: Doesn't he deserve a real live flesh-and-blood dad, not some myth that you created? Gigi, you have got to tell him, and you have to do it soon. What if -- what if he finds out that you prevented him from knowing his father? He would never forgive you. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Nigel, I can promise you this, okay? When the truth comes out, David Vickers' name will never come up.",
        "Nigel: It can't! Be very, very careful about what you are doing.",
        "Natalie: I, uh, I've got to go get ready for the wedding.",
        "Jared: Well, if you need someone to help you zip up, or down, I'm your guy.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Natalie: I wish.",
        "David: Ah! If it isn't the lovely Natalie.",
        "Natalie: David.",
        "David: And this -- well, this must be Asa Buchanan's long lost heir.",
        "Natalie: What are you doing here, David?",
        "David: Can't a guy stop by to see a few old friends?",
        "Natalie: Hmm, see, but you don't have any friends under this roof.",
        "David: Well, maybe Jared will be my friend. How about that, J.B.? You know, you have really matured since we last crossed paths in Texas. I guess becoming an uncle will do that to a man, huh? Grows you up real fast.",
        "Jared: Do you have a point?",
        "David: Just an observation. So how's it going, anyway -- the uncle and the niece, working so closely together. Big shots at the company, right?",
        "Natalie: What do you want, David?",
        "David: First, a Harvey wallbanger, easy on the O.J., and then what I really want is to do a little business with both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Yeah, Rex, it's Charlie. I hope you get this message. Listen, I figure you got enough on your plate without having to come by and pick me up, so I'm just going to go to the church with Viki. And I'll see you there soon. That's it.",
        "Viki: A minor crisis at The Banner averted. I'll be ready in no time.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Viki: Are you nervous?",
        "Charlie: Uh, about the wedding?",
        "Viki: Uh-huh.",
        "Charlie: I guess a little. I don't know why.",
        "Viki: I think Rex is very lucky, you know. He's marrying a lovely girl, and he's got his father there to see him get married.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, but the fact of the matter is, Bo was the one who was really there for him.",
        "Viki: Because he didn't know you, but you know, I think now he's going to start turning to you much more. Young couples need their parents. I can tell you that from experience. Who knows, maybe they'll have children and you'll be a grandfather.",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "Viki: You have an awful lot to look forward to, Charlie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You look so handsome. Very grown up.",
        "Shane: Thanks, you do, too. I mean, you look pretty, not grown up.",
        "[Shane coughing]",
        "Gigi: You still have that cough, it's getting worse.",
        "Shane: I feel fine. So can we leave now?",
        "[Shane continues coughing]",
        "Gigi: Shane, um, I need to talk to you.",
        "Shane: Uh-oh, what did I do?",
        "Gigi: No, no, it's nothing you did. It's what I did. It's about your father.",
        "[Shane coughing and wheezing]",
        "Gigi: Uh-oh, here we go. Where's your inhaler? This one's empty. Where's your full one? Where's your full one?",
        "Shane: I -- I -- I don't --",
        "Gigi: Okay, you must have left it at Viki's. Come on, come on.",

        "Rex's reflection: But I'm still hung up on my high school girlfriend.",
        "Rex: Adriana, I \u0096",
        "Rex's reflection: Yeah, you already said that.",
        "Rex: What are you, a wise guy?",
        "Rex's reflection: Funny! You knew exactly what you wanted to say when you went over to Morasco's house the other night. If you hadn't been four sheets to the wind, you might have actually gotten the words out.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and if I hadn't been drunk, I wouldn't have been over there in the first place. And if you'll let me get a word in here edgewise, I am marrying Adriana today.",
        "Rex's reflection: And what about tomorrow? When you see Gigi in the street, or at the store, or in your dreams?",
        "Rex: Okay, this is -- this is ridiculous. I'm nervous, that's all.",
        "Rex's reflection: Right. You keep telling yourself that, while you try to come up with the words that follow, \"Adriana, I -- \"",
        "Rex: I'll -- I'll just wing it. I'm -- I'm good on my feet. I'll know exactly what to say to Adriana when I look into her eyes.",

        "David: Natalie, you need to be here for our little discussion.",
        "Jared: Leave her alone, David.",
        "David: This skit is so much fun to watch. Are you two enjoying playing your parts? The fake uncle protects the fake niece? Now that I have your full attention, it's imperative that you understand that I know everything.",
