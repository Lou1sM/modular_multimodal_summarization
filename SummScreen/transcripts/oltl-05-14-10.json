        "Cole: I'm Cole.",
        "Starr: And I'm Starr. This is Langston.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: And what is that?",
        "Dorian: True love. Remember?",
        "Blair: Hmm. I was never that young.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. Cole and Starr were just meant for each other. I mean it is true romance, and the magic is they both still believe in it.",
        "Blair: Well, at least they did. Now Cole's in jail, Starr's in pieces, and this could really tear them apart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, whoa. Hey.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: No, it's okay, but you're a million miles away. Where were you?",
        "Starr: I was at that party... where Cole and I first met.",
        "Langston: When he saved you from those jocks?",
        "Starr: Yeah. It just feels like we've been together forever and...like a lifetime, you know, and...I don't know. He's the first guy that I've ever been with, the first guy that I ever trusted, that I...that I ever loved.",
        "Langston: And that's a bad thing?",
        "Starr: No, it's not. It's just... what if we break up? You know, I just don't even know how to think about that and...I don't know. What would you do? What would you do if you lost Markko?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks very much.",
        "Markko: Hey, Brody.",
        "Brody: Hey, Markko. You working?",
        "Markko: No, I'm off today. Prom.",
        "Brody: So I'll see you there.",
        "Markko: Wait. You're going to the prom? What, as security?",
        "Brody: No, with Jessica, who thinks she's a senior.",
        "Markko: Right. I heard about that.",
        "Brody: Just be glad your date doesn't think she's in love with someone else.",
        "Markko: I hear you, man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: I asked you a question.",
        "Cristian: And I answered it. I love Layla.",
        "Carlotta: Once upon a time, you were in love with Jessica Buchanan.",
        "Cristian: Mom, that was a long time ago, okay? That's--it's over, okay? End of story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: Are you sure?",
        "Jessica: Oh, I'm not interested in Ford, but I am really grateful. You know, thanks to him, Cristian just basically admitted that he still has feelings for me.",
        "Roxy: Ha ha ha! Listen to you. What a kidder. You really had me going there.",
        "Jessica: But it's true. When I was with him at school just now, I asked him if he still had feelings for me--",
        "Layla: And he said no.",
        "Jessica: But then I asked him to swear on his mother's life, and he couldn't do it.",
        "Layla: What's next, Jess? A double-pinky swear?",
        "Jessica: Cristian and I are destined to be together. You'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm glad you could make it. I know it was short notice.",
        "Nora: No. Happy to come.",
        "Bo: Anytime, big brother. You know that.",
        "Viki: We thought it would be nice if we could all be together to see Jessica off.",
        "Clint: Yes. She's going to the prom.",
        "Nora: Oh, that's right. Matthew mentioned something about that.",
        "Viki: Yeah. Apparently this prom night is very significant. It's a significant event. Of course, we have no idea how it's going to impact her, but we want her to know that we're there for her no matter what, you know.",
        "Clint: I was hoping that Matthew could stop by for a little bit.",
        "Bo: Sure.",
        "Clint: I mean, we could take some photos and let Jessie know that we love her.",
        "Nora: I'll give him a call.",
        "Clint: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Bo: How's she doing?",
        "Viki: Under the circumstances, I would say she's doing as well as can be expected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: So, you and Cristian are destined.",
        "Jessica: You know, the sooner you accept it, the easier it'll be for you.",
        "Layla: Really? So what happened to the Jessica who came over to our apartment the other night? The one who wasn't gonna make any more trouble for us?",
        "Jessica: Okay. The truth is, I just wanted to see how Cristian would react when I told him that Brody was gonna be my date to the prom.",
        "Layla: Yeah, that was apparent to everybody.",
        "Jessica: Was it apparent that he didn't like it? And when Ford was hitting on me, he got really jealous?",
        "Layla: Jessica, Cristian was concerned because of your condition. He didn't want Ford to make you feel threatened or uncomfortable.",
        "Jessica: He still loves me.",
        "Layla: You're delusional.",
        "Jessica: Really? Well, then how come he almost just kissed me at the gym?",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Jessica: You can ask him yourself. But I don't think you're gonna like the answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Did Layla say something to you?",
        "Carlotta: Don't hurt her, okay, Cristian? She's such a lovely woman.",
        "Cristian: Why would I hurt her? I love her.",
        "Carlotta: Yeah, and the people who hurt us the most are the ones who love us.",
        "Cristian: Oh, so I can't win. If I love her, I hurt her. If I love somebody else, then--",
        "Carlotta: Everybody gets hurt. You just have to look deep in your heart. If you still love Jessica--",
        "Cristian: So what if I do? Would that be a crime?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You didn't lose Cole. It's just a bad situation.",
        "Starr: It's getting worse.",
        "Langston: Why? What happened now?",
        "Starr: Hannah. I went to see Cole, and she was hanging all over the bars of his jail cell.",
        "Langston: She's really working it.",
        "Starr: Yeah, overtime. Then Cole and I got into a fight.",
        "Langston: About Hannah?",
        "Starr: And my dad, as usual. And then I--I went to talk to Hannah, you know, to... to lay it out. And I was defending my dad, and then all of a sudden, she...she said, \"what if he didn't do it? Then who did?\"",
        "Langston: Yeah, that's a good question.",
        "Starr: Hannah.",
        "Langston: Are--are you serious?",
        "Starr: Hannah. I think that Hannah pushed Cole's mom down the stairs.",
        "Langston: No. Really?",
        "Starr: I wouldn't put it past her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Where's Todd?",
        "Cole: They took him to have his head examined.",
        "Hannah: I could have saved them the trip. He's certifiable.",
        "Cole: What's that?",
        "Hannah: Oh, it's some cookies I baked for you.",
        "Cole: Oh, you didn't have to do that.",
        "Hannah: It's the least I could do after what I did to your mom.",
        "Cole: What do you mean?",
        "Hannah: Well, you didn't hear? According to Starr, I pushed your mom down the stairs and killed her baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I know that it sounds crazy, but someone had to push Cole's mom down the stairs, and if it wasn't my dad, Hannah was there. I mean, she admitted it.",
        "Langston: Okay, look, I'm totally on your side, but it just sounds kind of desperate. I mean, I know Cole's cute and all, but do you really think she would push his mom down the stairs?",
        "Starr: Yeah, and blame it on my dad to push us apart. I mean, I think that she would go that far.",
        "Langston: Well, have you told John?",
        "Starr: No. Not yet. You know, I don't want him to think that I'm crazy.",
        "Langston: You're not crazy, but you also don't have any proof, either.",
        "Starr: Yet.",
        "Langston: Okay, come on, Sherlock. We got to get to rehearsal.",

        "Dani: I don't know. Who's that?",
        "Destiny: I think he's on the football team. I don't know his name. Whoever he is, he's cute.",
        "Starr: Who's that guy over there?",
        "Langston: The hot one? Some football jerk, I guess.",
        "Mr. G.: Cut! That was great, everybody. Brings us back to the first number.",
        "Whitney: Some of us have appointments, Mr. G., like to get our hair done for the prom.",

        "Cole: I remember a few years back, Starr and I were both going to the prom, but with other people.",
        "Hannah: So you weren't together then?",
        "Cole: Well, that's the thing. By the end of the night, we made it back to each other, in the middle of a rainstorm. I'll never forget the two of us just kissing in the rain. It felt like anything was possible, that we were meant to be, and that nothing and no one could pull us apart. But now, I--I don't know. I don't really know what to believe anymore. So do I wish I could be with Starr tonight? If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. It's something my dad used to say.",

        "Blair: You know, maybe I'm not as mean as you think I am.",
        "Dorian: You're plenty mean when you want to be. T\u00e9a usually can be counted on to bring out that mean streak and that's why this, uh, little attitude of yours has taken me by surprise.",

        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. We're all set upstairs.",
        "Blair: That's great.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. Great. So, um, I'll just go and make sure the girls get something to eat.",

        "Clint: Yeah, and, uh, we are counting on you to keep an eye on Jessica tonight.",
        "Jessica: I don't need my little cousin to keep an eye on me. I have a chaperone for that. And if I have anything to say about it, he won't be looking at anyone else.",

        "Cristian: I don't want to hurt Jess.",

        "Cristian: Why me?",
        "Carlotta: Because she loves you and she trusts that you're gonna do the right thing. I'm telling you, you're gonna hurt them both if you don't make a choice.",
