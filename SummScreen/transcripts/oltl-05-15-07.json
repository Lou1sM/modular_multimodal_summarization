        "Evangeline: Ah! Cristian! Cristian! How is that for thinking? I like not thinking! I \"love\" not thinking!",
        "Evangeline: Michael. Hey.",
        "Michael: Hi.",
        "Evangeline: How are you?",
        "Michael: Good. You?",
        "Evangeline: The same. How's Marcie?",
        "Michael: She's great. I'm actually expecting her. We got a babysitter. We're having a night out.",
        "Evangeline: Oh. Nights out are good.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Hey, I was wondering -- um -- you heard from Todd?",
        "Evangeline: No, not a word. Have you?",
        "Michael: No. It's weird, you know? I mean, he ran off to Chicago and nobody's seen him since.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I know. Blair's worried sick about him, and so am I.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I wonder what he went to Chicago for in the first place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I saw Rex in the newspaper, but I'm sure that was only part of the story. Honey, what in the world possessed him to go on television and out Tate Harmon?",
        "Adriana: You know, I still don't feel too comfortable talking to you about my problems with Rex.",
        "Dorian: But, honey --",
        "Adriana: Just don't start in on him, ok, Mother? Please. We've been making progress here, and -- I don't want to backtrack.",
        "Dorian: Well, I thought I was being a model of restraint.",
        "Adriana: Just outing somebody is just so --",
        "Dorian: Rotten?",
        "Adriana: I mean, if a person is gay, and they aren't ready to come out, then it's just --",
        "Dorian: Reprehensible.",
        "Adriana: But saying someone is gay when they aren't -- that just --",
        "Dorian: It's toxic on so many levels.",
        "Adriana: Yes, it is. I don't know what to do.",
        "Dorian: Do about what, honey?",
        "Adriana: I used to think that I could trust Rex with my life. But now, I don't.",
        "Tate: Well, if that's the way you feel, Adriana, you should probably go with your gut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Yeah, this is Danny Jarvis. Oh, thanks for calling me back, Mr. Norman. The reason I'm calling is, I know you used to be --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rex: Tate Harmon's high school baseball coach. Yeah, and --- Tate's a buddy of mine, and I was wondering if you could tell me where his family's living now. I -- I've been hearing all the crazy rumors, and I just wanted to tell them that nobody believes this garbage. And I -- what are you doing?",
        "Roxy: I didn't raise you to be a little rat!",
        "Rex: You didn't raise me, period.",
        "Roxy: Shut up! If you think Adriana's going to like this, you're way dumber than I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, guys.",
        "Natalie: Oh --",
        "Miles: Oh.",
        "Natalie: John. I didn't know you were here.",
        "John: Oh, yeah?",
        "Natalie: Can we help you with something?",
        "John: Yeah. Hey, miles. Hey, look, if you got a minute, I'd like to talk to you alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Starr: I -- nothing.",
        "Cole: Hmm? I want to be with you so bad.",
        "Starr: It's too late.",
        "Marcie: Oh -- ow.",
        "Marcie: No, that's -- oh, there it goes. Yes. This is what I need. Let's see. Oh, this is going to be great. This is going to be great. This is it. Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Tate, this is my mother, Dr. Dorian Lord. Mom, Tate Harmon.",
        "Tate: It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.",
        "Dorian: It is so nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you.",
        "Tate: Yes, you and the rest of the country.",
        "Dorian: It's terrible.",
        "Adriana: Have a seat, Tate.",
        "Tate: Thanks. Well, I was out of line before when I said -- I shouldn't be butting in between you and Rex.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: I must say, I'm very impressed that you're taking the high -- road. I mean, with the -- the situation does have its ramifications.",
        "Adriana: Are you still getting cancellations on your speaking engagements?",
        "Tate: I can handle that, and I can handle the press. But --",
        "Adriana: What? What is it?",
        "Tate: It's Rex. He\u0091s just not giving up on this.",
        "Adriana: Well, what do you mean?",
        "Tate: I just got a call from my old high school coach. Aid that a friend of mine called trying to locate my family, and I didn't recognize the name, so I'm betting that it was Rex.",
        "Adriana: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Tate: Apparently, he has called every club I've ever played for, every person I've ever had a cup of coffee with. Because he couldn't get my ex-wife to say that I was gay, he's trying to dig up something else.",
        "Adriana: Are you sure of this?",
        "Tate: He even got through to my triple-a pitching coach trying to find out about my \"secret life.\"",
        "Dorian: That's indefensible.",
        "Adriana: And false. There is no secret life.",
        "Tate: Of course not. But, you know, I'm just really worried about Mabel. She has a heart condition, and if he gets to her --",
        "Adriana: What do you want me to do, Tate?",
        "Tate: I want you to tell Rex that if he doesn't stop doing this, I will have no choice but to sue his ass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You have no right to barge in here and start pulling phone cords out of the wall!",
        "Roxy: After what you did to Tate, I ought to clean your clock.",
        "Rex: Sorry -- you're claiming moral superiority?",
        "Roxy: No, I am claiming that you are wrong!",
        "Rex: You don't know that.",
        "Roxy: You know my friend bobby? The one that said that George Washington was gay?",
        "Rex: All right.",
        "Roxy: Well, he hasn't heard any buzz about Tate Harmon. Neither have any of the gay boys at that club where you made your big announcement, and I know you're still working it.",
        "Rex: Well, I'm not on the gay thing anymore.",
        "Roxy: That's not what I heard.",
        "Rex: Well, check your sources. I'm not done with Tate, though, either. The guy's lying. I'm going to find out what he's hiding and beat him with it before he hurts Adriana.",
        "Roxy: You know, I'm right. You are losing it, buddy.",
        "Rex: Oh -- do you have any idea how frustrating it is to be the only one who sees through this jerk?",
        "Roxy: Well, maybe there's a good reason why Adriana likes him better than you.",
        "Rex: She doesn't like him better.",
        "Roxy: Not true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: So you want to use the gallery for a photo shoot?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm. Nudes on canvas, models in underwear. Seems like it could work.",
        "Lindsay: I'd have to have some assurances that things wouldn't get damaged.",
        "Layla: Oh, we're fully insured. Vincent? What are you doing here?",
        "Vincent: I came to see Ms. Rappaport --",
        "Lindsay: Yeah?",
        "Vincent: About a talented African artist that I'm representing.",
        "Layla: Oh, so you're an artist's rep now?",
        "Vincent: Tsk. Layla, you know I'm always looking to diversify. I have photographs of the man's work, if you would like to look at it.",
        "Lindsay: I happen to love African art.",
        "Layla: You're a patron of the arts now, huh?",
        "Vincent: Yeah, is that so hard to believe? [Vincent sighs] Is there a problem with that?",
        "Layla: Yeah, because I think you just butted in the middle of our conversation.",
        "Vincent: Yes, I did. And I apologize. It's just that I needed Ms. Rappaport to see this man's work.",
        "Lindsay: It's very interesting, especially the masks.",
        "Vincent: Mm-hmm, and I'm glad that you can see what I see.",
        "Lindsay: I'll tell you what. I'd be happy to show his work, and who knows? He may turn out to be the next superstar -- like Cristian Vega, whose work used to fly out of here.",
        "Layla: Too bad he reinjured his that fixed fight, huh?",
        "Lindsay: Yes, it is, because it's the only reason his work isn't saleable anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Well, this is kind of a bad time, you know, John. Um -- Miles, could you excuse us for just one minute?",
        "Miles: Oh, yeah. Sure.",
        "Marty: Hey.",
        "Miles: Hey, yourself.",
        "Marty: So how was it?",
        "Natalie: So what'd you want to talk about?",
        "John: If that little kiss was for my benefit, you can wipe the lip-gloss off. It didn't work.",
        "Natalie: Like hell it didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I don't usually offer contracts based on looking at just a few photographs. However, I have a lot of clients that collect African art. So, you talk it over with your client, you show this to yr lawyer, you call me, and we'll set up a meeting. How about that?",
        "Vincent: I will. And thank you, Ms. Rappaport. I tell you, this means a whole lot to me today, and to my future -- tomorrow.",
        "Lindsay: Well, hopefully, it'll be good for both of us. [Phone rings] Oh, excuse me. Lindsay Rappaport fine arts.",
        "Cristian: Hey, Lindsay, it's Cristian.",
        "Lindsay: Well, were your ears burning? Because we were just talking about you. I haven't seen you in ages. How are you?",
        "Cristian: Listen, I need you to come to the studio.",
        "Lindsay: Sure, why?",
        "Cristian: I think I'm on to something.",
        "Lindsay: Are you painting again?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Yeah -- something new.",
        "Lindsay: Well, that's terrific news, and I'm going to be there in a few minutes, so you just hold tight. I'll be right there. Um -- Layla, I'm sorry, we're going to have to talk about logistics later, because I've got to step out for a few minutes. Um -- margo, hey. Could you cover the front for a little while? Because I've got to step out. Ok. Thanks.",
        "Layla: Is everything ok, Lindsay?",
        "Lindsay: No, everything's great. But if you have any questions, ask Margo, my assistant, all right?",
        "Layla: Ok.",
        "Lindsay: Bye, guys.",
        "Vincent: H, I got an idea.",
        "Layla: Really? What's that, Vincent?",
        "Vincent: How about you allow me to take you downstairs and buy you a drink? And while you're drinking it, I will convince you that I'm not the phony that you think I am.",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: She's gone.",
        "Starr: I can't believe she didn't see us.",
        "Cole: Yeah, we finally got a break.",
        "Starr: Mrs. McBain has covered for us so many times.",
        "Cole: Yeah, she would have gone to our parents for sure this time.",
        "Starr: I knew it. I should have stayed away from you.",
        "Cole: Starr --",
        "Starr: Cole, please, stop, I mean it.",
        "Cole: We're -- we're going to have to see each other. We're in the musical together.",
        "Starr: Cole, don't you get it? We can't be doing things like this. We have to stop it. We can't do anything like that ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I just think it's kind of high school.",
        "Natalie: Oh, you do?",
        "John: Don't you? Grabbing the first guy you see because your ex-boyfriend walks in?",
        "Natalie: You could have ignored Miles and me, but you didn't.",
        "John: Is that how it's going to be? Hooking up with guys you barely know just to get a reaction out of me?",
        "Natalie: You know what, John? You haven't said a nice word to me in this entire conversation. I spent 10 minutes with Miles, and he was nice to me the whole time. I kissed him, and that was nice, too, so I'm starting to realize that nice is a good quality to have in a boyfriend, for a change.",
        "John: Is this you really talking right now? Because if it is, I'm not sure I recognize you anymore.",
        "Miles: If the \"it\" you're talking about was me kissing Natalie, it was fine. Did it bother you?",
        "Marty: Uh -- no. Why should it?",
        "Miles: Then you really don't care, do you?",
        "Marty: Miles, caring about that would mean that I have feelings for you, and other than feelings of friendship, I don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Adriana's just confused. Tate's act is so good, he's got her snowed. Then she'll thank me when I tell her the truth about her underwear model.",
        "Roxy: Well, the truth is that he's a famous ballplayer, and you're not.",
        "Rex: I'm not jealous, so don't go there. I love Adriana, and I am just trying to protect her from somebody I think is dangerous.",
        "Roxy: By saying that he's gay? Because if he's not, that makes you a liar. And if he is, you're nothing but a lowdown dirty creep.",
        "Rex: Ok, I blew that.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, you blew it bigtime! All right, and it's true -- he's a narcissist. He's an egomaniacal narcissist. That's it.",
        "Rex: I love you, and I know you're just trying to help me. But, a, you're not, and, b, this is none of your business. Give me the phone. I was in the middle of my research, and I didn't ask for company.",
        "Roxy: And I'm sure you're not asking for your little sweetie to dump you, either.",
        "Rex: Adriana loves me.",
        "Roxy: Last time I looked, I was still a woman, so I think I know how they think.",
        "Rex: She and I disagree on this, but we're still solid.",
        "Roxy: Well, I hope you're right. But if you're not, don't come crying to me.",
        "Rex: Don't worry, you taught me that a long time ago. You took the battery out of the phone. Give me the battery.",
        "Roxy: No.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Rex: Mine, mine, mine!",
        "Roxy: Oh, no! Mine! Mine!",
        "Rex: Mine -- hello?",
        "Roxy: Oh.",
        "Rex: Hey, yeah. Thanks for getting back to me. I was -- I was interested in your relationship with Tate Harmon when you guys were in the minors together. Well, I was just wondering if you got the impression that he had a secret. Well, just -- you know anything he really wanted to keep under wraps?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Look, Rex can be very overprotective of me and -- no. You know what? What Rex said is horrible, and that's all there is to it. I am really sorry, and I will talk to Rex and tell him to leave you alone.",
        "Tate: Thank you. You're the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Evangeline?",
        "Evangeline: Hey, Marcie. Hey. Your husband's looking for you.",
        "Marcie: Oh, you saw him?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, he's around here, somewhere. He said you two were having a night out.",
        "Marcie: Yes. We're celebrating our first-year anniversary.",
        "Evangeline: Wow. Has it been a year already?",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Evangeline: Go what a day that was.",
        "Marcie: I know. When a tornado hits on your wedding day, you kind of don't think you're going to be happy a year later, but we are.",
        "Evangeline: Let me ask you a question.",
        "Marcie: Sure.",
        "Evangeline: Why would Michael be looking for Todd?",
        "Marcie: I don't know. We're close to Starr, but we don't really know Todd.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, yeah. He must just be concerned about Starr. He's such a good man.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Rex, it's Mike.",
        "Rex: Michael, what's up?",
        "Michael: I've been ringing you for the last 10 minutes.",
        "Rex: Yeah -- I saw you beeping in. I was on an important call. Something wrong?",
        "Michael: You know Todd's missing, right?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I heard.",
        "Michael: I hope that doesn't mean that he's found out what we've been hiding from him.",
        "Marcie: Hey. Who are you talking to?",
        "Michael: Rex, Marcie's here. That was Rex.",
        "Marcie: Yeah -- he's not really on my good list these days after what he did to Tate Harmon.",
        "Michael: Really? Because he loves you.",
        "Marcie: Oh --",
        "Michael: You want a drink?",
        "Marcie: No, I don't want a drink, Michael. I want to know what the two of you are hiding.",
        "Michael: Hiding?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. I heard what you said. You said \"I hope he doesn't figure out what we're hiding.\"",
        "Michael: Oh, that.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, that.",
        "Michael: Oh, I was -- talking about that Tate thing. You know? I mean, Rex told me he was going to do it before he did.",
        "Marcie: Really?",
        "Michael: Yeah. And you know, I was just hoping that he doesn't find out about it, because if he knew that I knew what was going to happen before it happened, it'd be kind of uncomfortable, you know? I mean, I thought of it because he's right over there.",
        "Marcie: Rex asked your advice on outing Tate Harmon, and you didn't even think about mentioning it to me?",
        "Michael: I told him not to do it. I thought that was the end of it. And I turned on the tv, and -- well, you know.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Marce, do we have to talk about this on our night out?",
        "Marcie: No. But we are going to talk about it -- eventually.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You know, Tate, I have the distinct feeling that you're going to come through this horrific situation just fine.",
        "Tate: Well, thank you for your support, Dr. Lord. I just hope it doesn't hurt your daughter's company too much.",
        "Dorian: You know the saying -- any publicity is good publicity, as long as they spell your name right. Adriana, I think you should let Rex know how you feel.",
        "Adriana: Hmm. Don't worry. I just texted him to get his butt over here.",
        "Tate: And that would be my cue to leave.",
        "Adriana: Why?",
        "Tate: Um -- I -- I can't be here if Rex is going to be. I -- I feel like I could kill him right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: \"Come to Capricorn, now.\" It's from Adriana.",
        "Roxy: Not exactly plumping up the pillows, is she, now?",
        "Rex: Oh -- don't drink all my beer.",
        "Roxy: Beer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Evangeline Williamson.",
        "Evangeline: Well, this is a surprise.",
        "Layla: We ran into each other upstairs at Lindsay's gallery. It's no big deal.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. Layla. I couldn't possibly.",
        "Layla: Lindsay had to leave because Cristian called. She sounded kind of cryptic, but I think he's starting to paint again.",

        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Lindsay: Hey!",
        "Cristian: That was fast.",

        "Lindsay: It's a whole new style.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know, it really is amazing.",
        "John: What is?",
        "Natalie: When you break up with somebody, the junk you used to buy -- somehow, it just seems unacceptable. I was minding my own business, John. You started this. And if I were your girlfriend, I would take it. But since we're just friends -- if that's what we even are -- I won't.",
        "John: I'm just calling it the way I see it.",
        "Natalie: I don't care how you see it. You used to run circles around me. I was always trying to figure out what you were thinking, what you wanted. And I look at you now, and I just -- I don't care. I got my life back.",
        "John: Fine, you want me to say it? I'll say it. Seeing that kiss -- bothered me.",

        "Starr: Cole, please don't do that.",
        "Cole: Why not?",
        "Starr: Because I can't take it anymore, ok?",
        "Cole: I just want to make you feel better. Why is that so bad?",
        "Starr: Cole, because you are taking advantage of the fact that I don't know where my father is and that he could be dead.",

        "Starr: Yes, I am.",
        "Cole: Huh. Ok, you know, you said that a little too easy. You know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the person who doesn't want us to be together is you.",
        "Starr: Cole, do you really think that this could work out?",
        "Cole: Yes, definitely, if we want it to.",
        "Starr: Aren't you sick of all the lectures and sneaking around?",
        "Cole: You know, we won't always be in high school. And in a few years, nobody will be able to tell us what to do.",
        "Starr: I was thinking about that, Cole, but it would take a miracle to fix this. My dad raped your mom and that is never going to go away.",
        "Cole: So there's no hope?",
        "Starr: I don't think so.",
        "Cole: Ok. Ok, well, I get what you're saying. But I have to know -- do you still feel the same way about me?",

        "John: Listen, every -- everything aside, there is something not right about that guy, I'm telling you.",
        "Natalie: Like what?",
        "John: Well, for starters, he played a part in your uncle's disappearance, so just -- just watch your back.",

        "Lindsay: It's very different, very different from your earlier work.",
        "Cristian: I can do this, Lindsay. I can do this and I don't even think about my hand. That's the great thing.",
