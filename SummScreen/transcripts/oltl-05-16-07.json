        "John: Listen to me. I've got a missing person whose trail has gone cold, and that dead son of a bitch Truman is our only connection to it, so I don't care what you have to do -- make it happen. [John sighs] Everything all right?",
        "Marty: Oh, just, you know, late night. Uh -- I couldn't help but overhearing -- Todd's still missing?",
        "John: Yeah, we're trying to track him down on our end, but Chicago is way out of our jurisdiction. What brings you down here?",
        "Marty: Oh -- this. I want to look over the arson case and work up a profile.",
        "John: Psychotic, racist, extremist -- how am I doing so far?",
        "Marty: Hmm -- tip of the iceberg.",
        "John: Well, thanks for taking a look at it.",
        "Marty: Hmm, no biggie. I was up anyway.",
        "John: Too much coffee?",
        "Marty: Uh -- actually, too many nightmares.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Yeah!",
        "Britney: Sing out, Cole.",
        "Cole: Oh. Uh -- hey. What, was I singing out loud?",
        "Britney: Oh. Not loud enough to scare off business. You wouldn't anyway -- you've got a killer voice.",
        "Cole: Yeah, so killer I got a part in the school musical.",
        "Britney: Hmm. I know -- it sucks, right?",
        "Cole: I mean, it's eight straight weeks of dance rehearsal and voice lessons -- not exactly what I want to do with my spring.",
        "Britney: Even if it's eight weeks straight with Starr?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Two large eggs, 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, and then you're going to add in some chocolate chip",
        "Dorian: Honey, please -- please. Slow down, I'm begging you. This is the third batch I'm going to be making, all right? So give me just one ingredient at a time, ok?",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian, you really don't need us to do this with you. We have other things that we can work on.",
        "Dorian: Like what? You're not going to school, your teachers are having an in- service day. So, why don't you do the same -- be of service -- huh -- by helping me make baked goods to bring to the hospital and meanwhile, we're having quality girl time.",
        "Starr: Me and Langston really need to rehearse for the play, though.",
        "Dorian: And who stopping you? [Dorian chuckles] Give me a preview, please. Right, Langston?",
        "Starr: I am never going to rehearse in front of you.",
        "Dorian: Fine, have it your way. Would you at least, though, do me a -- a big, big favor? These have been cooling for a while, and I -- I could use a taste tester, because, well, I want to make sure they're good to bring to Clint at the hospital. Besides which, they say that nothing but nothing improves the attitude like chocolate.",
        "Starr: If I were you and I wanted to impress Clint Buchanan, I would call a bakery.",
        "Dorian: Please. Will you at least taste a part of it? You know, it's not all burned.",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian, I'm really not hungry.",
        "Dorian: All right -- this is enough. Really, it's enough! Langston, will you please tell her -- no boy is worth all this?",
        "Starr: Like you're one to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: How long have you been here?",
        "Nash: Um -- all night. Oh, yeah, I couldn't just leave her, sir.",
        "Clint: Well, don't worry -- I'm not going to throw you out.",
        "Nash: Thank you. Appreciate that.",
        "Clint: Listen, if you're too tired here, can give you a break.",
        "Nash: No, that's fine. I'm ok.",
        "Clint: Yeah, you're not going to do Jessica any good if you're too tired to think.",
        "Nash: I don't need a clear head just to stand here.",
        "Clint: No, I suppose not, but you're going to need your wits about you to convince Antonio that you should stay. Now, I'm assuming that you want to be here when we get the results of Jessica's biopsy.",
        "Nurse: How are we feeling this morning?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I feel sick, I hurt all over.",
        "Nurse: I'll check with your doctors about adjusting your pain medication.",
        "Jessica: Where's Nash? He was here.",
        "Nurse: Oh, I'm sure your husband will be back soon.",
        "Jessica: He's not my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Will do. Yes, and tell the girls papa sends their love, ok? Ok.",
        "Talia: Good morning, boss.",
        "Antonio: Well, good morning to you. I know that's masala chai.",
        "Talia: Yes.",
        "Antonio: What's in the file?",
        "Talia: Oh, just vice stuff. I wrote up some cases -- they need your signature.",
        "Antonio: You came all the way here for this?",
        "Talia: We're behind.",
        "Antonio: Paperwork's always behind.",
        "Talia: I came to see how you were doing, to check up. Jessica seems, you know, ok.",
        "Antonio: Mm-hmm. You saw Jess?",
        "Talia: Yeah -- no, I stopped by upstairs first. Um -- Nash said he hadn't seen you --",
        "Antonio: Nash is with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Oh, please. I have watched you boo-hoo over so many dudes.",
        "Dorian: I never boo-hoo, and I don't date \"dudes.\"",
        "Starr: Ok, first there was ex-Governor Brooks --",
        "Langston: No way.",
        "Dorian: Such a bore.",
        "Starr: Mm-hmm, and then there was the extremely young David Vickers.",
        "Langston: Ooh!",
        "Dorian: And extremely handsome. Just ethically challenge",
        "Starr: Don't forget Clint Buchanan.",
        "Dorian: Don't you dare slander his name.",
        "Starr: Let me tell you a little story about him -- he's actually married to my Aunt Viki, several times over, and my Aunt Viki and Aunt Dorian are mortal enemies.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Langston: That's so gothic.",
        "Dorian: Just for the record, I have never shed a tear over Clint Buchanan. We are still very much together and thrilled about it.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, I hope it works out.",
        "Dorian: You have to have faith.",
        "Starr: No offense, but nobody stays together anymore.",
        "Langston: My parents are still married -- sort of.",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute -- who said anything about marriage?",
        "Starr: Well, come on. There's my parents and then there's Kelly and Cassie.",
        "Langston: Way to look to your elders for advice -- no offense.",
        "Dorian: None taken.",
        "Starr: What was I thinking? Cole and I never stood a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Don't you think it'll be weird working with Starr on the show?",
        "Cole: No comment.",
        "Britney: I mean, you guys are already in each other's face all the time at school. You'll be tripping all over each other if you do the play.",
        "Cole: No comment.",
        "Britney: Sounds brutal -- you know, with the way you still feel about her and how she's playing hard to get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Out of my way, Sahid.",
        "Talia: Or what?",
        "Antonio: Look, you don't want to get in the middle of this.",
        "Talia: My badge puts me in the middle of this, not to mention our friendship.",
        "Antonio: Damn it, Talia. He is upstairs right now with my wife making every second of this nightmare worse for her, for us!",
        "Talia: I cannot let you go up there, not like this. Jessica and your family will end up paying for it, not Nash.",
        "Antonio: Look, if you're so afraid that I'm going to lose it, then why don't you come with me and help me get rid of him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I appreciate your concern, but I'm not afraid of Antonio or his threats, all right, Mr. Buchanan?",
        "Clint: I wish the two of you would just get over yourselves. There's no room in this situation for posturing.",
        "Nash: \"Posturing.\" Who is posturing? I'm here for Jessica. I spent the whole night sitting next to her bed -- me. I had to hide in her bathroom every time a nurse came in so I wouldn't be given the boot.",
        "Clint: Keep it down. Is this at Jessica's request?",
        "Nash: She was asleep most of the night, she probably didn't even know I was here.",
        "Clint: You are really pushing it, son. You should be thinking about Jessica's health and not indulging in your feelings -- do you understand me?",
        "Viki: Good morning.",
        "Clint: Good morning.",
        "Viki: What's going on?",
        "Clint: Um -- nothing to worry about. Let's finish this elsewhere.",
        "Natalie: You know, when the world comes to an end, the only one left will be Nash and the cockroaches.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God -- and the Laurence family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Nightmares? About Cole again?",
        "Marty: I don't know, I -- I don't think so.",
        "John: Something's got your head working overtime.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I know. I just -- you know, when I wake up and I try to remember, it -- ooh, the image, it just --",
        "John: Fades away?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: Yeah, I know how that is. You know, maybe you want to try putting a notebook by your bed.",
        "Marty: Like a sleep journal?",
        "John: Yeah -- sometimes when I'm working a case, you know, I'll get a pen and a pad of paper, and if I think of something in the night, I write it down.",
        "Marty: Smart. Did you learn that in therapy?",
        "John: Well, you know, when you're on the job, you know, you need to see the whole field clearly. And, you know, sometimes when I focus on one piece of evidence too carefully, you know, I'll sleep on it, let my subconscious do some of the work.",
        "Marty: Does it help?",
        "John: How the hell would I know? You're the shrink.",
        "Marty: Uh -- true. Hmm.",
        "John: Well, look, I'm no dream catcher. But if you need a sounding board, you know, I'm here to listen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: We all could've been killed the other day, and you're still gossiping about my love life? Didn't you learn anything?",
        "Britney: I'm just trying to get back to normal.",
        "Cole: Whatever.",
        "Britney: Look, I'm sorry. It's just that -- you know, now I know what it feels like to have everybody hate me, just like you.",
        "Cole: I'm going to grab some coffee. Try not to be here when I get back.",
        "Britney: What did I do now?",
        "Cole: You just said everybody hated me.",
        "Britney: Uh -- well, I mean, you can't be surprised. This is a small town, varsity football is huge. People were pissed when you got kicked off the team -- they must have told you.",
        "Cole: Do you really think I want to talk about this?",
        "Britney: I'm sorry. I'm just trying.",
        "Cole: Trying to do what -- ruin my day?",
        "Britney: To be friendly, to somebody.",
        "Cole: You sure got a funny way of showing it.",
        "Britney: You know, everybody blames me for what happened with Henry. My so- called friends won't en talk to me, not even amber, who, quite frankly, is completely retarded.",
        "Cole: Whoa!",
        "Britney: What?",
        "Cole: The way you talk, Britney -- it's offensive. If something is lame, it's lame -- it's not gay. And if somebody's stupid, they're not retarded.",
        "Britney: Oh. What is this, English class?",
        "Cole: Do you want to know why everybody hates you?",
        "Britney: Cole, I know why everybody hates me. I'm not a -- they hate me because I am a stuck-up, cold-hearted bitch who drove the most harmless, peace-loving guy to driving a car right into a tree. I just want a do-over, Cole -- that's all I'm asking for. And I was hoping I could start with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Starr, I actually think that you have shown incredible wisdom beyond your age in this very, very difficult situation with Cole.",
        "Starr: Makes me want to vomit every time I think about it.",
        "Dorian: You're conflicted, honey -- that's only natural. You'd be a robot if you weren't.",
        "Starr: I wish that I was a robot so that I could turn myself off until I'm 18. God -- what else am I supposed to do? I don't know what to do anymore.",
        "Langston: Look, you and Cole -- you lied to your parents, you snuck around, you almost skipped out of town. I mean, what more were you supposed to do -- elope?",
        "Starr: Is that a good thing or a bad thing?",
        "Langston: It's an awesome thing. You did everything you could. It's not your fault things didn't work out.",
        "Dorian: Well said. Listen to your friend. You did the only thing that you could do -- you made the right decision., Otherwise, you would've been happy for what -- two minutes?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I would've been happy until my dad would kill him.",
        "Dorian: Exactly, darling. So, you sacrificed your love in order to protect him, which is very Cramer of you -- very. Cramers never quit. Honey, you never gave up on that boy. But I'm afraid you may have given up on love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I am not going to stand here and discuss this over tea while he's upstairs screwing with my family. Now, either you can get out of the way and let me take care of this or you can come with me.",
        "Talia: Confronting him here in the middle of a really difficult situation -- it can't end well.",
        "Antonio: But it will end -- one way or another.",
        "Talia: Ok. All right, I'm with you. But this is the way it's going to go down. You're going to say whatever it is you need to say and then I'm taking over.",
        "Antonio: Wait a minute --",
        "Talia: Look, I'm sorry. I know you're my superior, but you're not thinking clearly, so I get to escort Nash out and you get to stay with Jessica and not do anything crazy. Deal?",
        "Antonio: Deal.",
        "Talia: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I want Nash. I want to talk to Nash.",
        "Nurse: Try to rest, ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: These are for Jessica.",
        "Viki: Oh. Well, they're lovely. Thank you. I'll make sure she gets them.",
        "Miles: Thank you, I appreciate it. Is Jessica ok?",
        "Viki: No. She's very, very sick.",
        "Natalie: Jess has Hepatitis C --",
        "Miles: Oh --",
        "Natalie: And we still don't know how serious it is. We're waiting on test results.",
        "Miles: Well, if there's anything I can do, I -- I hope you'll ask.",
        "Viki: That's very nice, thank you, but right now we're just looking for the best treatment possible.",
        "Miles: You know, Spencer left me a lot of money. I -- I know your family probably has more, but --",
        "Natalie: It's -- it's -- it's fine. Money's not an issue. But I'm sure that Jessica really appreciates your friendship.",
        "Miles: Oh, well, she's been amazing. You both have been very good to me.",
        "Viki: Really? I didn't realize that you and Natalie were close.",
        "Miles: Well, \"close\" might be overstating it. Uh -- how would you put it? Allies, perhaps?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Why would you want to start your do-over with Mr. Roid Rage?",
        "Britney: Because you're real. You don't treat people one way to their face and then a totally different way behind their back.",
        "Cole: Huh. I thought you liked acting like that.",
        "Britney: In my house, you don't say nice things to people if you can help it. It shows that you're weak.",
        "Cole: Well, no, it's not weak.",
        "Britney: I know, and you're -- and you're showing me that. You're showing me what's real and what's fake. The girls that I'm friends with -- they don't even know the difference.",
        "Cole: Ok, so you want to be my friend?",
        "Britney: Yes.",
        "Cole: That's kind of a --",
        "Britney: Stretch -- I know. You know, I was awful to you and Starr and you care about her -- I get it. Look, you probably want to kick my teeth in, but, Cole, I don't have anyone else to talk to. So you can either diss me or you can say yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I am not giving up on love! Love sucks right now, but --",
        "Dorian: Oh, please watch your language. You -- you just -- you're making it sound like Cole is the on eligible boy in the world.",
        "Starr: Are you saying that I should hook up with another guy?",
        "Dorian: No! I would never dream of trying to tell you what to do.",
        "Starr: Like that's ever stopped you from telling my mom or Kelly or Adriana what to do?",
        "Dorian: They needed my help and they didn't have anyone else to help them. You, however, have your mother, who is perfectly capable of helping you in these things.",
        "Langston: She's just not here right now.",
        "Dorian: Ok, enough of the cynicism because, Starr, I honestly belie that you are a true romantic, and you mustn't allow that precious emotion to drown and set your heart adrift just because you've had some bad luck with one boy.",
        "Langston: \"Set your heart .\" That is -- that's great stuff.",
        "Dorian: Thank you. So, darling, I want you to know that you shouldn't close yourself down because someday, someday you are going to want to feel free to open your heart again to someone new. Do you understand?",
        "Starr: I suppose.",
        "Dorian: Good. Well, that's solved. Ok. Um -- I better get cleaned up and get to the hospital to see Clint. Don't worry. Ta-da! [Dorian hums] Plan B -- I did go to the bakery. Ha-ha! Yes. We'll just put that in a nice pretty basket!",
        "Starr: That was a very good idea.",
        "Dorian: Bye-bye! See you in a bit.",
        "Langston: Bye, Dr. Lord. I wish I had an aunt like yours. But why was she all up in your business today?",
        "Starr: Because if my Aunt Dorian would've come to pick me up at the gym any earlier, she would've caught me and Cole going at it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You feel nauseous?",
        "Marty: No. No, I'm not sick. I -- I just -- I don't feel right in the head.",
        "John: Ok. Uh -- come on. Look -- have a seat. All right? I'm -- I'm going to get you some water, all right? Just stay here.",
        "John: Here you go, Doc.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: \"Allies\"? In what?",
        "Natalie: Um, well --",
        "Miles: Marty Saybrooke and John McBain.",
        "Viki: What about them?",
        "Miles: Well, I -- Natalie and I, we -- we challenged them to a game of foosball last night at Rodi's.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Nurse: She's awake now.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Uh -- thank you for the flowers. I will give her your regards. Um -- honey, I'm going inside.",
        "Miles: Thank you. Do you think she bought it?",
        "Natalie: Well, as long as she doesn't figure out that Rodi's doesn't have a foosball table. Good try, though.",
        "Jessica: How's Bree?",
        "Viki: Bree's fine, honey. She's with Carlotta. And Clint is here. Natalie. Antonio will be here any minute. Did you sleep, honey?",
        "Jessica: I was afraid that I was going to have nightmares, but I didn't. I just dreamed about Nash. He was here all night.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You are one breath away from seeing the inside of a jail cell.",
        "Nash: Oh, why? I haven't hurt anyone!",
        "Antonio: She is sick and fighting for her life!",
        "Nash: You think I don't know that?",
        "Antonio: Nash, all you want to do is take advantage of her.",
        "Clint: Look, this is not helping.",
        "Nash: Ask her, Antonio. Ask Jessica why I am here!",
        "Clint: All right, Nash, that's enough!",
        "Antonio: I trust Jessica with everything I have, and there is nothing you can say that is going to shake that, but I'll be damned if I stand here and watch you wreck her life the way you wrecked Claudia Reston's.",
        "Paige: I hope everything's cool here because the last thing Jessica needs right now is added stress.",
        "Clint: No, there is no problem.",
        "Talia: Yeah -- no. Everything is cool.",
        "Paige: Ok. Then we can all go in and see Jessica and discuss the results of her biopsy.",
        "Antonio: Not you!",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Antonio: You're not going anywhere near my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I knew you would flip.",
        "Langston: That's no excuse for not telling your best friend you had sex in the gym.",
        "Starr: I did not have sex, ok? We just -- we made out a little.",
        "Langston: How little?",
        "Starr: A little a lot?",
        "Langston: Ew, on the gym floor?",
        "Starr: Hmm.",
        "Langston: The janitor barely even cleans that. Ok, so tell me everything.",
        "Starr: First off, it wasn't the gym floor. We were just talking, and then we started kissing. And it was exactly what I was afraid of.",
        "Langston: And then what? First base, second base, third base? Home run?",
        "Starr: Between first and second.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God.",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "Langston: So what stopped you? Because it obviously wasn't common sense.",
        "Starr: Mrs. McBain.",
        "Langston: What? She walked in on you? What did she see?",
        "Starr: She didn't \"catch us\" catch us. When we she came in, we ran immediately behind the piano. And then when she walked out, we didn't kiss again. We were just talking, and that's when my aunt Dorian came in. She must have, like, a sex detector or something because I think she could totally tell that we were making out before.",
        "Langston: Oh. Well, what now?",
        "Starr: What else can I do? I'm back to my old prison sentence, as usual.",
        "Langston: Unless we can figure out another way for you and Cole to be together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: What? Are you like one of those guys that already has all the friends that he needs?",
        "Cole: It's not like that.",
        "Britney: So what's it like?",
        "Cole: All right, listen. You need a friend. I get that. But I an, come on. Do you even like me?",
        "Britney: Well, you're -- you're nice, and you're hot, and -- You can string two sentences together, so what's not to like? So --",
        "Cole: So -- let's see what happens.",
        "Britney: Pinky swear? Kidding.",
        "Cole: Huh.",
        "Britney: Cool.",
        "Cole: Cool.",
        "Britney: Now I'll have somebody to sit and make fun of Mrs. McBain with during rehearsals. [Phone rings] Oh. Hello? Yes, this is she. Is this is a joke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Who is that?",
        "Marty: Uh -- sorry for running out. I feel so silly. You must think I'm a complete flake.",
        "John: You had another panic attack, didn't you?",
        "Marty: Uh -- no, I -- I'm sure it was --",
        "John: Yesterday, you told me you had another one. That's two days in a row. Don't you think it's time you see a doctor -- and with all due respect, a real doctor?",
        "Marty: I'm just a little worn out.",
        "John: It's more than that.",
        "Marty: You know, everything with Cole and -- I haven't been sleeping. I didn't eat this morning, and -- you know, I'm -- I'm a mess when I don't eat.",
        "John: Ok. If that's the story you're going with. Let's just get one thing clear. I know it's more than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I hope I didn't mess things up. I'm just -- I'm not good at improvising lies.",
        "Natalie: And for your sake, I hope you never get good at it.",
        "Miles: Yeah, but I could have used it a little bit --",
        "Natalie: No, listen, listen, listen. My mom is worried about Jessica, and I'm sure it's already forgotten by now.",
        "Miles: Yeah, but why didn't you want to tell her the truth?",
        "Natalie: She -- she's a worrier.",
        "Miles: Why would she have been worried?",
        "Natalie: Let me count my ways. My John-jealousy issues. Your last name. Not that I have anything against you, but as long as you live in this town, it's going to be an issue.",
        "Miles: Oh. Well, I know my brother's hurt a lot of people. Well, I'll have to help her along. Give my best to Jessica.",
        "Natalie: I will.",
        "Miles: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Antonio, I'm asking you to think of Jessica.",
        "Antonio: She is the only thing on my mind.",
        "Nash: Well, that goes double for me.",
        "Michael: Listen, you obviously both care a great deal about Jessica. Can't you see that this fighting is just a big waste of time?",
        "Antonio: I am her husband, and nobody is going inside that room until I am sure that he is staying behind. You are not going to bully Jessica or poison my family a second longer.",
        "Nash: What are you talking about?",
        "Antonio: You are making Jessica more of a victim than Tess ever did. And it stops now.",
        "Paige: Ok, as Jessica's doctor, I'm going to defer to her husband. I'm sorry, Nash, that's the way it has to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston, it's just too late for me and Cole.",
        "Langston: Oh, right. Because rolling around on a gym floor, fully between second and third base --",
        "Starr: It was between first and second.",
        "Langston: That's a sure sign that things are over.",
        "Starr: Langston, I stopped it.",
        "Langston: Right. You stopped it, not Cole.",
        "Starr: I told him that we couldn't be together. I mean, I didn't say that, but he assumed, and I didn't correct him.",
        "Langston: Then speak up. Tell him the truth.",
        "Starr: Langston, we have to be over.",
        "Langston: Oh, you sound like your parents, and they're not even here.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but if they come back and they found out that I was with Cole while they were away -- no way. I would never get away with that.",
        "Langston: Fine. Then go do work on the play. You going to be ok?",
        "Starr: Yeah, sure.",
        "Langston: Your Aunt Dorian's right. Chocolate helps. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Henry's parents want to talk to me.",
        "Cole: Was that them? They called you?",
        "Britney: No, it was his uncle. Cole, I can't talk to Henry's parents. I can't. I mean, that freak could have killed me. And -- and they what? They want to talk to the girl that sent him over the edge? No, I can't. No way.",
        "Cole: Ok, all right, relax. It's ok. Look at -- look at me. Relax.",
        "Britney: You tell anyone about this, and I'll spread a rumor that you're in love with Tate Harmon.",
        "Cole: Huh. Or not.",
        "Britney: I don't even know what I would say if I saw them.",
        "Cole: You mean you've -- you've never thought about it? I know I have.",
        "Britney: Well, what would you say? Mean, yeah, I've pictured it in my nightmares. And in those, I'm -- I'm trying to get out of that car. I'm not talking about the way I feel.",
        "Cole: Ok, well, maybe you start there. Tell Henry's parents what he did, what he was like, how he made you feel. I'm sure they'll want to know what his last words were. They're trying to figure this whole thing out, and maybe you can help them with that.",
        "Britney: Huh. You really are a shrink's kid.",
        "Cole: Huh. So, are you going to go see them?",
        "Britney: Huh. You saw what I was like on the phone. In person, I'll probably pass out.",
        "Cole: Well, I'll be there with you the whole time, where a friend should be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Can't fool you, can I?",
        "John: Why would you want t",
        "Marty: I'm a psychiatrist. I'm supposed to have the answers, and I hate -- I hate not knowing what's going on. It's like I'm in the dark, and I can't fix it.",
        "John: But you're not completely in the dark, are you? Truman's crime scene photos -- that's what set you off. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Do you agree with this? Do these two get to -- Clint, do they get to shut me out?",
        "Clint: Paige is right. Now, I know this is difficult. But if we all go up to Jessica's room like this, she's going to pick up on it, and I won't have that.",
        "Nash: Oh, so I am not a big enough part of Jessica's life to be there when she finds out if she is going to live or die?",
        "Antonio: If you want to continue to put up with this, you go right ahead, but I'm not letting Jessica wait one second longer.",
        "Clint: Antonio, wait a minute. Now, I want Paige to stay here, if that's all right with her, and tell Nash the results. Now, you may be able to keep her out of that room, but he deserves to know what's going on.",
        "Paige: I have no problem with that.",
        "Clint: Thank you.",
        "Michael: I can inform the rest of the family.",
        "Nash: Jessica wants me there, Clint! You know --",
        "Clint: No, Nash -- Nash --",
        "Nash: You know that she wants me there!",
        "Clint: This is the way it's going to be!",

        "Dorian: Hello, Clint.",
        "Clint: Hi. I just don't have the time.",
        "Dorian: No, I -- I saw the whole thing, and I'm very sorry. You go ahead to Jessica, but, please, take these to her room.",
        "Clint: What is this?",
        "Dorian: Oh, brownies, obviously. Starr and I wanted you to have them.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Dorian: Ok?",
        "Clint: Thanks. Would you do me a favor? Keep a close eye on Nash, would you? And, Paige, thank you for staying.",
        "Dorian: Nash, you know, sometimes the Buchanans and the Vegas don't make it easy on outsiders, but I think you're going to be able to get in.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Viki: And then miles told us that he had a lot of money, in case we needed it. Was actually kind of sweet. Although I think he's trolling for honorary family status.",
        "Jessica: Oh, give him a break. At least he knew enough to bring flowers.",
        "Viki: Yeah, how about that -- a Laurence with manners. Who would have thought?",
        "Antonio: Hi, baby. Jamie and Bree send big hugs and big kisses.",
        "Viki: Is -- is Paige coming?",
        "Antonio: No. She got held up. But Michael can tell us everything we need to know.",
        "Viki: Ok.",
        "Michael: Yeah, it'll be just a while. How are we feeling today?",
        "Jessica: Oh, a little sick.",
        "Michael: Yeah? Ok. I'm going to get your pulse.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Gracious. Where did that come from?",
        "Clint: Dorian just dropped them off.",
        "Viki: And where's Nash?",
        "Clint: That's been taken care of.",
        "Viki: Jessica told me she dreamt that he stayed here all night.",
        "Clint: That wasn't a dream.",
        "Michael: Ok. We're all set. Um -- do we have everybody here?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. We're all here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: So you'd really go with me to see them?",
        "Cole: Yeah, if you want me to. I mean, that's if you even want to go at all. Although I think it would help Henry's mom and dad. It'd be good karma. I mean, that's if it matters to you.",
        "Britney: Yeah, but I'm scared.",
        "Cole: I know. But I'll be there with you the whole time.",

        "Marty: I honestly don't know why I reacted to those photos the way I did. I mean, I've seen crime scene photos before.",
        "John: You know, sometimes when you know the person, even someone like Truman --",
        "Marty: I just keep thinking I was supposed to help him.",
        "John: You did your best.",
        "Marty: Then why does it feel like that I'm responsible for his murder?",
        "John: What are you, some sort of martyr? Truman got what he deserved, all right? You couldn't have stopped it.",
        "Marty: I know that.",
        "John: Hey, the bastard's in your head, isn't he? Believe me, I know how it is. I closed the case months ago. I'm still carrying around his files. Let me tell you something. You got to figure out a way to let it go.",
        "Marty: It's easier said than done.",

        "Nash: All right, I'm ready. How is she?",
        "Paige: That biopsy we did on Jessica's liver confirmed her positive E.I.A. and sonogram. It told us everything we needed to know about her condition. We got a good look at some tissue, and it's -- it's pretty clear what we're up against.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: The hepatitis has done a lot of damage. There's some piecemeal necrosis, as well as fibrosis, in a substantial part of the liver.",
        "Clint: Michael, would you make this plain for us?",
        "Paige: It all adds up to end-stage Hepatitis C, with one other very serious complication called Hepatoma.",
