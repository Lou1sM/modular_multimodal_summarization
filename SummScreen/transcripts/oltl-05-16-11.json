        "The \"original\" Todd with the scar of his face is alone in an abandoned building that looks like an institution with a mysterious man urging him to talk. Yet \"old\" Todd is non responsive and silent. Meanwhile, the man we know as Todd has left his hospital room without telling anybody where he's gone. Tea and Dani are frantic. He goes and talks to Tomas in his jail cell at first telling his brother in law he wants to kill him. But they later realize that they both know a \"secret\" they do not want anybody to know. Marty escapes with baby Liam before Brody can catch him. Before she's gone, she runs into Matthew and Destiny who question her for taking a baby that they know is not hers'. She pulls a gun on them and escapes. Later, we see the emotional attachment of the two teenagers each fearing the other could have gotten shot and revealing that they had sex not long beforehand. Marty takes baby Liam to a motel and admits she has a plan to appear that she has \"rescued\" him, bring him back to John and be a family after John marries her. Natalie regains consciousness yet remembers noting except that baby Liam is missing. Both John and Brody hesitate to tell her that Marty has the baby. While Deanna stays with Nate, they appear to be getting \"comfortable\" and Dani has suspicions."

        "Baker: All these years. There's got to be something on your mind, and if you are ever going to say a word, this would be the time to do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: My God, turn the volume down. You had that cranked.",
        "Destiny: Helps drown out the noise.",
        "Matthew: Or make it just ok to walk by me? I've texted you, like, a hundred times. I tried to call you. You just disappeared.",
        "Destiny: I've been really busy. Actually, I've got to get going.",
        "Marty: Hey! Watch where you're going!",
        "Destiny: I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: No, I'm sorry. I'll get it. Leave it.",
        "Matthew: Whose baby is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Did Marty do this to you? Did she push you?",
        "Natalie: John.",
        "John: That's it. I'm here, just you and me. Just tell me what happened.",
        "Natalie: Marty. Marty.",
        "John: That's right--Marty. She was at my apartment at Angel Square.",
        "Natalie: She was?",
        "John: Yeah, and you were there, too. You went to see me, and for some reason, you went up on the roof, and that's where you fell from, Natalie. But you're gonna be ok. The awning broke your fall, all right? I'm just trying to piece together what happened, because I think she pushed you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Are you babysitting or something?",
        "Marty: Just--it's ok. Just leave it alone.",
        "Destiny: No, no. It's my fault. I'll pick it up.",
        "Marty: Why didn't you leave it? Why didn't you listen to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Shaun, where the hell are you? Call me right away.",
        "Dani: Hey, Mom? Hi.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi.",
        "Dani: What's wrong?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, nothing. I--I thought you were at Nate's baseball game.",
        "Dani: I was, but it's over, and it wasn't pretty.",
        "T\u00e9a: What happened?",
        "Dani: They lost real bad. Nate didn't really seem like he wanted the company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deanna: So I take it you lost?",
        "Nate: Oh, sorry. I didn't know anyone was home. Yeah, we lost.",
        "Deanna: Oh. How bad?",
        "Nate: Well... is it too late to join the track team?",
        "Deanna: You know, some losses are just harder to get over than others.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Why don't you give him a call? I'm sure he'd appreciate it.",
        "Dani: Yeah, I will. I'm just gonna check on Dad.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, yeah, Dani--",
        "Dani: Mom.",
        "T\u00e9a: I have no idea where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You look a little peaked, Todd. T\u00e9a know you're out of bed?",
        "Todd: Nobody knows.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Except the guard over there.",
        "Todd: Based on what he makes every hour, we can probably negotiate something. Say good-bye, Tom\u00e1s, because I'm gonna kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: Ok. We're gonna give it one last try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Great. It's painted shut.",
        "Deanna: Yeah. I tried working on it for a while. No go.",
        "Nate: Why is it so hot in here?",
        "Deanna: I heard the super talking to one of the neighbors. The heat got turned on by mistake.",
        "Nate: Oh, great. I guess it's too much to ask to be able to breathe in my own apartment. You still glad you moved in?",
        "Deanna: Yeah. A week ago, I was almost homeless. Today I've got a roof over my head, thanks to you and your mom. So yeah, I'm super grateful to be here, seriously.",
        "Nate: We had to stay in a shelter once, but then somebody gave us a hand, so it's only right that we pay it back.",
        "Deanna: Anyway, I'll be out of here before you know it. I've just got to find a job and make enough money to pay off that lawyer. Then once I find my mom, you'll be rid of me.",
        "Nate: Hey, there's no rush, ok? If you can stand the heat, we can stand someone sleeping on the couch.",
        "Deanna: I'm used to the heat, but the B.O.? Yeah.",
        "Nate: Oh, sorry. I didn't get a chance to shower. Guess that's why Dani cut out on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: So he was gone when you got here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I've only been here a few minutes.",
        "Dani: Maybe they took him down for some tests or something.",
        "T\u00e9a: I talked to the head nurse. They didn't order any tests.",
        "Dani: What? Well, Shaun--Shaun. Where is he? He's supposed to be watching Dad. Where--",
        "T\u00e9a: I know. I just called him. I left him a message, honey.",
        "Dani: Mom, where could he have gone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You're gonna kill me?",
        "Todd: Are you scared?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Of you?",
        "Todd: Yeah, Todd Manning. Didn't you do your homework? Don't you know what I'm capable of and all that? Man, you had a real chance to take me out, and you blew it.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So let me have it, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: There's no reason to panic.",
        "Dani: Mom, someone tried to kill Dad. He was in a coma for weeks.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know, which is why we hired Shaun. You know, they're probably just taking a stroll, ok?",
        "Shaun: Looking for me?",
        "Dani: You were saying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Not in the mood? Need a better angle? Maybe more light? What's the matter, Todd? I thought you were gonna take me out.",
        "Todd: I would, but they made me check my gun at the door.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Too bad. Another day, then.",
        "Todd: Definitely.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Settle for a chat?",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's actually why I came. I was hoping we could clear the air, work this thing out without having to worry about Blair and T\u00e9a and McBain getting the wrong idea.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Or asking inconvenient questions...",
        "Todd: That nobody wants answered.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You better make it quick. Knowing my sister, it won't take her long to track you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Give me these.",
        "T\u00e9a: You let Todd go?",
        "Dani: By himself?",
        "Shaun: I had to. The man's my boss.",
        "T\u00e9a: And I hired you to never let him out of your sight! He was shot, Shaun. He was in a coma.",
        "Shaun: And I reminded him of that, but he told me that the gunman's in jail, that the doctor was about to release him, and that you were downstairs waiting in the car.",
        "Dani: Oh, you actually fell for that?",
        "T\u00e9a: And you call yourself security.",
        "Shaun: Now that's low.",
        "Dani: Shaun, we trusted you.",
        "Shaun: Come on, ladies. Just chill. All of his stuff is still there.",
        "Dani: His stuff? He's not coming back for his stuff. What, his get-well cards?",
        "Shaun: Look, as far as I know, he was going out for some alone time with you. I just went to go get some chips. I'm sorry.",
        "Dani: Mom, you better call the cops.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, look at me. I know this is hard, but I need you to tell me what happened.",
        "Natalie: I can't. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even know how I got here. You said I was on the roof with Marty and that she pushed me. I don't remember any of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: It's your fault.",
        "Matthew: Look, Dr. Saybrooke, just take it easy, ok?",
        "Marty: No, you take it easy! She's the one crashing into people!",
        "Matthew: It was a mistake! We're sorry!",
        "Man: Marty!",
        "Marty: Oh, my gosh. You're lucky I love your mother. The next time, you might not be so lucky.",
        "Matthew: You ok?",
        "Destiny: Why did you do that?",
        "Matthew: Do what?",
        "Destiny: Get between me and Marty. She could have killed you.",
        "Matthew: Brody?",
        "Brody: Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Destiny: She just took off.",
        "Matthew: She has a gun.",
        "Destiny: And a baby!",
        "Brody: My son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Short-term memory loss is typical with this much trauma.",
        "Natalie: Will I get my memory back?",
        "Doctor: It's hard to say. I've seen all kinds of outcomes. It's possible after some time that something will spark it. The good news is you survived.",
        "John: Thanks, Doc.",
        "Natalie: So I was in your apartment, and then somehow I ended up in the street. What the hell did Marty do to me?",
        "John: Let's go over what we know. I think you said you left Llanfair with Liam. Kelly said she heard you come into the apartment.",
        "Natalie: Where's Liam? Was he in the apartment?",
        "John: No.",
        "Natalie: I didn't take him up to the roof, did I? Why would I do that? Where's my son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: He's bleeding!",
        "Brody: Where did Marty go?",
        "Matthew: Wait, that was--",
        "Brody: Where is he?!",
        "Destiny: Toward the avenue! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.",
        "Matthew: Brody, are you ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Don't you worry about Liam. I'm sure Brody's got him. Let's just try to focus on what happened.",
        "Natalie: I told you I can't--I don't remember.",
        "John: You called me, all right? Maybe this will help. You left me a message.",
        "Natalie's voice: John, it's Natalie. It's urgent. I need to see you right away.",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I mean, I'm sure it must have been important. I wouldn't have called you if it wasn't. Why can't I remember?",
        "John: Hey, hey, look. You heard the doc. He said this kind of thing is normal with that much trauma, all right? The important thing is you're going to be ok. Let's just try to focus on what happened, all right? Try to think about the last thing you remember.",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "[Liam crying]",
        "Natalie: I'll go.",
        "Brody: Nope, nope. It's ok. I'll get him.",
        "John: Do you remember anything?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I was with Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: She's getting away.",
        "Matthew: Brody, you have to stay down. You're hurt.",
        "Brody: She's got my son.",
        "Matthew: Brody, you have blood gushing out of your head. We have to get you to a hospital.",
        "Brody: I can't. I've got to find them.",
        "Matthew: You're no help to Liam when you're hurt like this, Brody.",
        "Brody: This is Officer Brody Lovett. Suspect Marty Saybrooke is on foot heading north on Llantano Avenue. She's armed and dangerous. Please be advised she--she's in possession of a 4-month-old baby boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I believe T\u00e9a's off somewhere fighting a losing battle to get you sprung.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I guess you don't talk to your wife much. She's no longer my legal counsel.",
        "Todd: What are you talking about?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: She fired me.",
        "Todd: Huh, no fooling? Well, good for her, all right? She had to see through you sometime.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And what happens when she sees through you?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not calling John. He's got enough to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: What? Mom, Dad's missing!",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, and he left of his own free will, honey, under his own power.",
        "Shaun: And I didn't get a sense that the boss was in trouble. He just had something to do.",
        "T\u00e9a: And he didn't want anyone seeing him do it. Didn't that raise a red flag with you, Shaun?",
        "Shaun: T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes.",
        "Shaun: Your husband lives in a red zone.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's true.",
        "Dani: All right, so, what do we do?",
        "T\u00e9a: I guess we go looking for him.",
        "Dani: Go look--Mom, this is Dad. He could be anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Looks like I'm not the only one with secrets.",
        "Todd: But my secrets don't put me at the top of the CIA's most wanted list. Yeah, the LPD's got some contacts at the agency. But the important issue is that T\u00e9a has dropped you, which is big for her. I mean, for her to let go of someone. I mean, she married me.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, well, we all make mistakes.",
        "Todd: And hers was trusting you. Imagine her concern about what you've been doing all these years. You were a mercenary. You were a terrorist. And then of course, poor Todd. What will she ever do to make it up to him?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You're really gonna milk this for all it's worth, huh, Todd?",
        "Todd: No, I'm gonna be the bigger man. I'm gonna say, \"Oh, I understand. I forgive you,\" and make her feel even guiltier so she won't give you a second chance.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Sounds like you got it all figured out.",
        "Todd: Too bad your aim wasn't better, huh?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, too bad.",
        "Todd: Ah. Sounds like somebody's confessed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ok, that's good. What were you and Brody doing?",
        "Natalie: We were talking, and then he left, and... I don't know. I don't know. It's like everything's blank. I really want Liam. Will you please go get him for me?",
        "John: Yeah. I'll go check on Brody, all right? You try and get some rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I don't need the chair.",
        "Doctor: Take a seat here. Let me take a look.",
        "John: Hey, what the hell happened to you?",
        "Brody: I'm fine. I'm ok.",
        "Destiny: No, he's not. He couldn't even walk.",
        "Matthew: We found him in Angel Square, and he had that huge cut on his head.",
        "Destiny: He was practically passing out.",
        "Brody: I'm fine.",
        "Doctor: How did this happen?",
        "Brody: I got hit on the head, but it's not as bad as it looks.",
        "Doctor: Let me get you a room and take a look.",
        "Brody: How's Natalie?",
        "John: She's gonna be ok. Did you find Liam?",
        "Brody: Yeah, alone on the roof. Next thing I know, I'm getting hit on the back of the head, and when I come to, Liam's gone, and so is my backup piece.",
        "Matthew: Marty had it.",
        "Destiny: We saw her in Angel Square. She pointed the gun at us, and then she ran off.",
        "Brody: She has my son, John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Yeah. Oh, come on, little one.",
        "Manager: You got Wi-Fi and TV.",
        "Marty: Yeah. It's perfect. We'll take it. And I'm sure you--here you go--I'm sure you know all about being discreet, right?",
        "Manager: Oh, sure thing, Miss...",
        "Marty: Mrs. Mrs. John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deanna: Ok, I know you and James didn't grow up together, but the way you're attacking that ice cream--exactly like James. In two seconds, I already know, you're gonna have a--",
        "Nate: Brain freeze. Oh!",
        "Deanna: And you make the same face.",
        "Nate: Ok. Anything else about us the same? Hmm?",
        "Deanna: Uh...",
        "Nate: I mean, I know, yeah, we have the whole genetics thing in common, but--",
        "Deanna: Yeah. Yeah. You guys definitely look like brothers.",
        "Nate: And we managed to both fall for sisters. How weird is that?",
        "Deanna: Hey, you ever need some privacy, just let me know.",
        "Nate: Right. I wish. But thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, straight to voicemail.",
        "Dani: Of course.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, where the hell are you? Dani and I are worried sick, and I don't care how close you were to being discharged. You do not go roaming around Llanview until the doctors sign you out. If you care about this marriage, you'll get your ass back here ASAP.",
        "Shaun: I'll go find him.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, you do that.",
        "Dani: She told you. What was so important that Dad had to leave his hospital bed?",
        "T\u00e9a: I wish I knew. I tell you, sometimes I feel like I know the man, and then he'll throw me a curveball, and then--",
        "Dani: And what?",
        "T\u00e9a: I feel like I have no idea who he really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You think I confessed?",
        "Todd: You just said you wanted me dead.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: A lot of people want you dead, Todd.",
        "Todd: But you were there when I was shot, right?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That's the one thing we agree on.",
        "Todd: So you admit it.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I was there.",
        "Todd: Great! Then let's call John and get this thing over with. You confess to shooting me, cop a plea, and we all go home. I mean, the rest of us go home. You'd have to go to prison, of course.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm not going to prison.",
        "Todd: Why not? You're just delaying the inevitable, and you're putting your family, who you claim to love, through hell.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I do love my family.",
        "Todd: Ok, then. Stop making them choose between us.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Fine. You call your buddy McBain. Call T\u00e9a, Daniella. I will tell them all that you were right, that I was right up there near Rodi's. But don't think I'm gonna stop there. When I come clean, it's all coming out-- everything I know about you.",
        "Todd: What about me?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Pull up a chair. I'll tell you a little story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: We've tried everything in our arsenal, everything we have ever developed, everything we could possibly put our hands on. This is a new compound. It worked on another prisoner. [Hissing] Now, this is the end of the line, and if you don't respond now, we will have to accept that you will never say another word. Whoa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thanks for looking after Officer Lovett and making sure he got here.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, sure. No problem.",
        "John: You guys ok?",
        "Destiny: Dr. Saybrooke was really scary. I've never seen her like that before.",
        "John: Like what?",
        "Destiny: Like...",
        "Matthew: Out of her mind. Crazy.",
        "Destiny: I thought she was gonna shoot us, but we're ok.",
        "John: Good. I'm glad you guys are ok, all right? And I'll let you know if we need statements from you, ok? All right.",
        "Matthew: Sure you're ok?",
        "Destiny: You are the one who almost got shot.",
        "Matthew: I was just trying to protect you.",
        "Destiny: Matthew, I would never forgive myself if you got shot because of me.",
        "Matthew: Oh, so now you care about me.",
        "Destiny: I always care about you.",
        "Matthew: Then why haven't you been talking to me?",
        "Destiny: There's nothing to talk about.",
        "Matthew: Whoa. What, are you mad at me or something?",
        "Destiny: For what?",
        "Matthew: For what? Destiny, we had sex.",

        "T\u00e9a: I'm not blaming Starr. I just don't think James solved the problem. I think he made her your problem.",

        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I know what you mean, but what you just said--Nate doesn't get it. Maybe that's because Nate is so into you that he doesn't even notice her.",
        "Dani: Please, Mom. He's a guy.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ok. He's a guy. I get it. So let's just say Nate does notice her. She's into James anyway, right? She's not gonna give him the time of day. I understand. You're territorial. We all are. Look at Blair.",

I'm really sorry it came to that, but, you know, I tried to reason with her, and, well, some people--here you go--some people just don't know what's good for them. I couldn't let her tell John that you're his son. No, no, no. No, because then he would never forgive me, and I can't have that. No, because, see, he needs to remember how he feels about me, huh? He loves me, and he will. He'll see. But he wouldn't do that if he knew I changed your paternity test. Right? There you go. So all's well that ends well. Natalie's gone, and look at me. I have a beautiful baby little boy. Little boy. And someday soon, I'll have John back. Yeah.",

        "John: Yeah, I don't think you want to do that. And you know, you may not have to, all right? She's a little fuzzy about the details of the last couple of hours. The doctor says it's pretty common with this kind of trauma. She doesn't even remember seeing Marty. She doesn't even remember the fall.",
        "Brody: I thought the doctor said she was fine.",
        "John: Yeah, she is. Physically she's fine, and he said there's a good chance that her memory is gonna come back when she's had a chance to recover, but she's pretty worked up about Liam, and you want to go easy on her.",
        "Brody: What are you saying? I should lie to her?",
        "John: No. No, I'm just--I'm wondering if we can't hold off until we've located him, all right? Look, Brody, I'm not telling you what to do, but maybe we can buy ourselves a little time here. Whatever you decide, I'll back you up.",

Can you say Christmas, right? We'll come back, and--oh, it'll be like I'm an angel delivering a miracle. Keep that going, and I'll tell them that I found you in the snow. Oh, that's perfect. Found you in the snow. The doctors, of course, they're gonna want to make sure that you're ok, so they'll have to do a bunch of tests. Nothing--it won't hurt you, just a bunch of tests, and then they'll have to find out, yeah--your DNA. They'll do a DNA test, right? And then John will discover that he has a son. He has a son, and he will be so grateful. He'll be so grateful that--here you go--that we'll get married, and we'll be a family. Won't that be great? It'll be perfect. You'll see. You'll see. Ah, see, because with Natalie gone, there's no one to tell him that I switched your paternity test, right? And Dr. Buhari --she can't say anything, and it's just that tape. Just that tape. Oh, that tape. That tape--where is that tape? You stay right here. I've got to find that tape. Where is it? Ok? I'll find it.",
