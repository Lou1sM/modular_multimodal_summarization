        "The prom is underway. Many people sing songs about their love lives. Starr is missing Cole. Dorian arranges for John to let him out of jail so he can be at the prom with Starr to surprise her. It appears that Langston finds out that Ford is not faithful to her and sleeping with Karen while Markko plays the video where Destiny tells Matthew that she saw Langston cheating on Markko with Ford. Brody still wants to get Jessica back but she still has Cristian on the brain. Natalie concludes that since John did not respond to her letter that he's made the decision to be done with her. But Roxy seems to somehow know that that is not true. And all the while John has been unaware that Natalie wrote him the letter since Marty hid it from him. But when she reveals the letter to him, he might be changing his priorities for who he wants to be with."

        "Matthew: I could really use that box right now.",
        "Starr: Yeah?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. I'd go back in time and change Langston's mind about writing the musical about you. That way, Danielle would've never met Nate.",

        "Destiny: I saw it with my own eyes.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but maybe it wasn't a big deal. Look. You only saw her with that guy one time, all right? Maybe it didn't mean anything. It was just one kiss.",

        "Natalie: Ugh. Your point?",
        "Roxy: My point is very simple. Johnny has been around the block, but no one was able to grab his heart and hold it in both of their hands like you were. So you go to Rodi's and he will be there. Believe me. Wild elephants couldn't keep him away.",
