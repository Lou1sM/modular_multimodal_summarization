        "Rex: You're breaking up with me?",
        "Adriana: What part of the sentence didn't you understand?",
        "Rex: Over Tate Harmon? I don't get it.",
        "Adriana: Then let me make it clearer. You and I are over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So the receptionist knows to send anyone who wants to be tested down here. We're going to be taking you in one at a time.",
        "Clint: And how long till we get the results?",
        "Michael: You know, I wish I could tell you that. And we're going to be starting with immediate family first. That's where we have the best possible chance of finding a match.",
        "Nash: What if we don't find a match?",
        "Natalie: They will.",
        "Nash: Just don't let her die, please.",
        "Michael: I'll be back as soon as the lab is ready.",
        "Clint: Thanks, Michael.",
        "Michael: Viki, if there's a match out there, I guarantee you, we will find it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What are you thinking?",
        "Jessica: How lucky we are that Bree's not sick. I miss her. I miss holding her.",
        "Antonio: You will again --",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
        "Antonio: When you're not so tired.",
        "Jessica: Where is she? Antonio: Your mother took her back to Llanfair. What is it?",
        "Jessica: I just can't help but wonder how many more times I'm going to get to see her. How many more times I'm going to get to hold her.",
        "Antonio: Till she's 80 and you're 100.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, I have cancer. And if we don't find a compatible liver donor, I'm not going to live to see my next birthday.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Yeah, come in.",
        "Matthew: Hey, what's up, Dad?",
        "Bo: Matthew bud -- where's your mom?",
        "Matthew: I thought maybe you would know.",
        "Bo: Well, wasn't she supposed to pick you up after school?",
        "Matthew: She didn't show. I got Marianne to get me.",
        "Bo: That doesn't sound like your mom.",
        "Matthew: Even if she was running late for work, wouldn't she have you or Marianne come and get me?",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, you know what? Let me just find out where she is.",
        "Lindsay: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I did something really stupid, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Adriana: You forgot to sound like you mean it.",
        "Rex: Tell me what you want and I'll do it.",
        "Adriana: I just want things to go back the way they used to be.",
        "Rex: They can.",
        "Adriana: They can't. I can't forget what you did, Rex.",
        "Rex: It's not like I'm an ax murderer.",
        "Adriana: This is what I'm talking about. You're not really sorry. Something's gone wrong between us, and you have no idea how to fix it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I -- I just read the article in the online edition of \"The Banner\" an hour ago about Jessica needing a liver donor.",
        "Natalie: It was in \"The Banner\"?",
        "Clint: Yeah, your mother thought a plea for donors would help -- not only Jessie, but other patients.",
        "Miles: I'm Jessica's uncle. Maybe -- maybe I'm compatible.",
        "Dorian: Jessica already has Laurence blood running through her veins. She doesn't need any closer ties with that family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: No bad thoughts, ok? We'll find a donor.",
        "Jessica: Even if we do, it might be too late. What if the cancer spreads?",
        "Antonio: If you think like that, it will beat you.",
        "Jessica: I have to face reality.",
        "Antonio: Do you know what reality is? I love you, and I won't let anything take you away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Your mom's office doesn't know where she is.",
        "Matthew: Well, maybe Evangeline knows.",
        "Bo: No, her secretary said that she's not there, either.",
        "Matthew: Do you think something happened to Mom?",
        "Bo: I -- you know what I think? She's at a meeting away from the office and she just lost track of time.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but I left a message on her cell phone. She always calls me right back, unless she's in court.",
        "Bo: Well -- ahem -- let me try. I got her voicemail, too.",
        "Matthew: Well, sometimes she forgets to charge her battery.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Come in.",
        "Officer: Commissioner, can I talk to you?",
        "Bo: Yeah, sure. Here, grab a -- grab a seat there, Matthew, I'll be right back.",
        "Matthew: All right.",
        "Officer: We just got a 911 call on an open line.",
        "Bo: Were you able to trace the call?",
        "Officer: Cristian Vega's cell phone.",
        "Bo: Oh. All right -- um -- get ahold of the cell phone company, see if they can find out which tower it came from, all right? Thanks. Matthew, I'm going to have Officer Watkins drive you back to your grandpa's house, ok?",
        "Matthew: Did you find out anything about Mom?",
        "Bo: No, but ---- I'm going to call you as soon as I hear from her. All right?",
        "Matthew: Ok. Love you.",
        "Bo: You, too -- enjoy the doughnuts. Mick, Jerry, you're with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dorian, that was uncalled for.",
        "Natalie: Miles could save Jessica's life. What -- what does it matter who he is?",
        "Dorian: He is a Laurence, so he, no doubt, has some ulterior motive.",
        "Miles: Believe whichever you want to believe. I'm not my brother.",
        "Dorian: What about your involvement with Todd's disappearance?",
        "Clint: Dorian, stop it! Today's about Jessica, nothing else.",
        "Dorian: Fine.",
        "Clint: Listen, Miles, I'm sorry about this, but everybody's on edge.",
        "Miles: I -- I -- I never knew my brother, but I've heard a lot about him. I understand Dr. Lord's suspicions.",
        "Natalie: You're letting her get off easy.",
        "Miles: Your dad's right -- today's only about Jessica. I'd like to be tested.",
        "Clint: Thanks.",
        "Natalie: Dad, is Mom ok?",
        "Clint: I'm not sure. I'll check on her.",
        "Michael: Clint? Would you like to be first?",
        "Clint: Uh -- yeah, of course. Let's do it.",
        "Nash: Sorry.",
        "Dorian: What do you have to be sorry about -- worrying about Jessica? We all are.",
        "Nash: I heard what Clint said to you.",
        "Dorian: I was thoughtless.",
        "Nash: You know, if Miles is a match, then --",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's really good news.",
        "Nash: You don't sound like you mean it.",
        "Dorian: He's a Laurence. Jessica's biological father, Mitch Laurence --",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm?",
        "Dorian: Was an evil, evil man.",
        "Nash: Oh. And you think that runs in the liver?",
        "Dorian: Huh. Miles was very close friends with Spencer Truman, and I don't think we should trust him.",
        "Natalie: Don't let Dorian upset you -- she doesn't trust anyone.",
        "Miles: I'm not my brother.",
        "Natalie: You don't have to prove that to her -- or to me.",
        "Miles: Thanks.",
        "Natalie: Just don't make me eat my words.",
        "Miles: Right now all I want to do is help Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I will do anything to prove I love you.",
        "Adriana: Protecting me from Tate isn't love.",
        "Rex: He's dangerous.",
        "Adriana: Only in your mind, Rex. And you didn't just hurt him -- preorders for exposed have gone down since you outed him.",
        "Rex: I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt you.",
        "Adriana: Well, maybe you should've thought of that instead of all the other crazy stuff that's poisoning your brain.",
        "Rex: I'll do anything you want, just let me make it up to you.",
        "Adriana: Is that the truth, or are you just saying it to get me back?",
        "Rex: Both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Lindsay -- she's alive. Get that door open! Come on, gentlemen, move, move! [Officer coughs] Go. Nora? Get on the horn, get an ambulance over here and backup, all available units.",
        "Ofc. Willard: Right. Dispatch, this is Willard. We need backup immediately.",
        "Bo: Mick?",
        "Mick: Clear!",
        "Bo: What's up -- all right. Everybody's alive, barely. No visible injuries.",
        "Mick: Commissioner?",
        "Bo: I'm ok.",
        "Mick: You're --",
        "Bo: No, I'm dizzy. Are you ok? Look, it's got to be gas. Come on, Mick, let's move! Get these people out of here! We got to find the source. Come on. Nora?",
        "Bo: All right, call C.S.U. Also, get another ambulance over here, tell them we got two DAs down.",
        "Mick: Ok.",
        "Bo: Cristian, you ok?",
        "Cristian: Is that Lindsay?",
        "Bo: Yeah, she got hit in the head.",
        "Cristian: How are the others?",
        "Bo: Sahid's breathing is shallow -- same with Nora. Evangeline -- we're doing all we can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You know, I'd sell my soul to save Jessica.",
        "Dorian: I'm sure.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: They're going to find a donor. Believe me, they will.",
        "Nash: Thank you for being there when Paige gave me the news.",
        "Dorian: I am a trained physician, and besides which, Clint didn't want you left alone.",
        "Nash: He's a good man.",
        "Dorian: The best.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: But you're not making it any easier for him. You don't hide your feelings for Jessica.",
        "Nash: I love her.",
        "Dorian: I know, but her family really is dealing with enough right now.",
        "Nash: I am her family. My daughter and I are her family.",
        "Dorian: However, you are not her husband.",
        "Nash: I'm not leaving her.",
        "Dorian: Of course you're not. I understand. I would move heaven -- or hell -- to be with the people I love.",
        "Nash: Well, I just want her to get well.",
        "Dorian: Yes, of course you do. It's going to be all right, I promise. How'd it go?",
        "Clint: Fine, fine -- that's the easy part. At least it makes you feel like you're doing something.",
        "Michael: Nash, you want to go next?",
        "Nash: Wild horses. Thank you.",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry about the way I was with miles earlier.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry that I snapped at you.",
        "Dorian: I deserved it. I was out of line.",
        "Clint: You know, it doesn't make one bit of a difference that Jessica and I don't share the same blood. In my heart, she's my daughter. But right now, biology matters -- her life depends on that.",
        "Miles: Hepatitis C -- it -- it's, like, the last thing I would expect Jessica to have. How did she get it?",
        "Natalie: It's not a pretty story.",
        "Dorian: Viki, can I get you a cup of coffee or anything else?",
        "Viki: No, thank you. What I need is a miracle.",
        "Dorian: You've already done everything that you can. It's out of your control now.",
        "Viki: Maybe not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You can't control what happens to me.",
        "Antonio: But you can control how this goes down. You put enough good energy out there, a donor will be found.",
        "Jessica: Do you really believe that?.",
        "Nash: God led me to you. He won't take you away from me now.",
        "Jessica: How can you be sure?",
        "Antonio: Faith in my love for you. Faith that you're strong enough to beat this.",
        "Nash: Antonio's right.",
        "Antonio: What are you doing here?",
        "Nash: I just got back from the lab, it's your turn to be tested.",
        "Antonio: I'll ask Natalie to keep you company.",
        "Jessica: No, it's ok. I want Nash to stay with me.",
        "Antonio: You sure?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, we -- um -- we have to talk about Bree in case something happens to me.",
        "Antonio: But I thought you already had that talk.",
        "Jessica: We're not finished.",
        "Antonio: Ok. All right. Yell if you need me.",
        "Jessica: Antonio? Take a break, ok? This is hard on you, too.",
        "Antonio: Hey, you're stuck with me, Jess -- for better or for worse, remember?",
        "Jessica: I don't deserve you.",
        "Antonio: I'll be back soon. If you upset her --",
        "Nash: Won't happen. I came as soon as I could.",
        "Jessica: We have to tell him, Nash. I have to tell him about us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Would you come out here for a moment, please? I have to ask you a favor. I need you to do something for me.",
        "Dorian: Does this have anything to do with me and Clint?",
        "Viki: No. No, it doesn't. No, I have more important things to think about.",
        "Dorian: Whew. All right, then. I'll do anything I can.",
        "Viki: Remember that you said that. I need you to draw my blood and get it to the lab to be tested.",
        "Dorian: No.",
        "Viki: Dorian, I'm Jessica's mother. If anyone's going to be a match, it's going to be me. And you and I both know that the chances of finding an unrelated donor are practically nonexistent.",
        "Dorian: No doctor in his right mind is going to perform elective surgery on a transplant patient.",
        "Viki: Look, I'm a -- I'm a major benefactor of this hospital, so is Asa. If I'm compatible, we'll simply convince the board to allow the surgery, that's all.",
        "Dorian: You could die.",
        "Viki: That's ok. I've had a very long and a wonderful life. Jessie has her whole life ahead of her, she has a baby.",
        "Dorian: I know it's heartbreaking, but it's really not worth sacrificing yourself.",
        "Viki: Well, can you come up with a better answer?",
        "Dorian: No, I'm afraid not. In this case, there are very few answers available.",
        "Viki: I know you, and I know that if Adriana or Cassie were in this situation -- if they were fighting for their lives and there was even the tiniest possibility you could help them, you would do it, no matter the cost. Please. I will owe you forever. All you have to do is take my blood and get it tested, that's it. We can always figure out the rest later on.",
        "Dorian: Come with me.",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Dorian: Come.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Go ahead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Thanks for the truth, Rex.",
        "Rex: Well, if I gave you any less, you'd be out that door.",
        "Adriana: You said you didn't want to lose me.",
        "Rex: And I'm sorry for what I did.",
        "Adriana: So, which is more important to you -- me or getting back at Tate?",
        "Rex: It's more complicated than that. Do you believe that I love you?",
        "Adriana: We're not talking about you and me.",
        "Rex: That's all this is about! Everything happened because Tate tried to mess us up.",
        "Adriana: You could've just walked away.",
        "Rex: That's not who I am and you know it. Now, you love me for me, and if not, then maybe we really are over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You'll be careful with that, will you?",
        "Dorian: Of course I will. I don't want your blood on my hands -- how would I explain it to people?",
        "Viki: Wish fulfillment?",
        "Dorian: Cheap shot.",
        "Viki: Thank you very much for doing this, I mean that.",
        "Dorian: I drew your blood. But for the record, I'm not going to perform an illegal transplant down in the hospital basement. I just want to set the record clear on that.",
        "Viki: Ok. How -- how are you going to get the lab to test the blood?",
        "Dorian: I have my ways. Really, you do have a control issue, don't you?",
        "Michael: Are we ready?",
        "Dorian: Yes! Yes, we are, thank you. Lead the way.",
        "Michael: Ok.",
        "Clint: How's Jessica?",
        "Antonio: Scared out of her mind and trying not to show it.",
        "Clint: Ok. Is she up for a visitor?",
        "Antonio: Nash is with her.",
        "Clint: You're ok with that?",
        "Antonio: Jessica wanted to see him to talk about Bree.",
        "Clint: It's good of you to let him do that.",
        "Antonio: And --",
        "Clint: And what? What's wrong?",
        "Antonio: Nah, I needed time away.",
        "Clint: Away from Jessie?",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Antonio, you don't have to be strong for her all the time.",
        "Antonio: I wish it were about that.",
        "Clint: Well, if it's too painful, I'll understand.",
        "Antonio: What's painful is Tess and what she did. She cared more about getting high for an hour than about living her life. How stupid do you have to be to share a needle with a stranger, a junkie? Even if Jess knew, and then she just did it that one time --",
        "Clint: She wouldn't lie about something like that.",
        "Antonio: I hate Tess for doing this to her. Jessica is so scared. I -- but when I look at her right now --",
        "Clint: When you look at her, you see Tess.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I do, and all I feel is anger. I had to get out of the room.",
        "Clint: I know you love one and you hate the other, but they're the same person -- it's exactly the same way it was with Viki and Niki.",
        "Antonio: If there was no Niki --",
        "Clint: There would be no Tess. Believe me, I've been thinking about that ever since we heard the news.",
        "Antonio: Do you blame Viki?",
        "Clint: Not as much as she blames herself.",
        "Antonio: You don't have to answer this, but was Niki the reason you and Viki split up?",
        "Clint: In part, but it was more complicated than that.",
        "Antonio: You guys still love each other.",
        "Clint: In a way, yeah, we do -- I never even thought that we would split. And every time we got back together, we both thought it would last.",
        "Antonio: I'm sorry.",
        "Clint: Antonio, are you afraid that your feelings for Tess are getting in the way between you and Jessie?",
        "Antonio: I don't know. But if Tess were real, if she were a separate human being, kill her for what she did to Jessica.",
        "Clint: I felt the same way about Niki -- and she was far worse than Tess.",
        "Antonio: That selfish bitch just as good as killed my wife.",
        "Miles: So Nash is Bree's father?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. And Nash is in love with Jessica.",
        "Miles: Not Tess?",
        "Natalie: Not anymore.",
        "Miles: But she's married.",
        "Natalie: Yes, and that's never stopped him before.",
        "Miles: So her husband doesn't know?",
        "Natalie: Oh, he knows -- he knows that Jessica loves him.",
        "Michael: Miles? We're ready for you.",
        "Miles: Great. You know, Jessica -- she's really lucky to have a husband like that, who cares for her. You can see it in his eyes -- he's very protective.",
        "Natalie: Sometimes to a fault.",
        "Miles: Well, that's . He's not going to let anything get in the way of Jessica getting well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You don't have to tell Antonio now.",
        "Jessica: He loves me so much, Nash, and the longer this goes on, the more it's going to hurt him when the truth finally comes out.",
        "Nash: When you're stronger, ok?",
        "Jessica: No. No more excuses. He has to know that I betrayed him.",
        "Nash: You didn't betray him. You can't help who you fall in love with.",
        "Jessica: That's not the point, Nash. I can't ask him to go through this with me, it's too much.",
        "Nash: Well, he's not going to stay away anyway, so --",
        "Jessica: Well, he's not going to have a choice, because if I get better, I'm leaving him.",
        "Nash: I just don't think now is the right time.",
