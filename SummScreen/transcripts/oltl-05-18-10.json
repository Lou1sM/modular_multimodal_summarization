I can't leave anything unsaid. I love you--it's as simple as that. I understand if you want to tear this up and forget it, but if there's any part of you that feels the same way, I'll be at Rodi's at midnight. If I don't see you there, then this is good-bye.\"",

        "Marty: Natalie left it here this afternoon.",
        "John: It wasn't here when I--",
        "Marty: I know. You didn't see it because I took it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How did you get out?",
        "Cole: A super-determined fairy godmother. She and a couple of other people thought that we deserve to be together tonight.",
        "Starr: If you see Aunt Dorian before I do, thank her for me--and John, too?",

        "Darren: This is the prom. You're supposed to dance together more than once.",
        "Destiny: Whose rule is that?",
        "Darren: Darren's rule.",
        "Destiny: Well, I don't live by Darren's rule. We've had our dance, and now we're done.",

        "Whitney: Darren, where have you been? We are supposed to be counting the ballots!",
        "Destiny: Oh, better hurry. Bye.",
        "Darren: I'll be back, and I repeat, you are gonna like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I--I didn't do anything.",
        "Brody: Don't be embarrassed. There's nothing wrong with voting for yourself-- especially if you are, hands down, the most beautiful girl here. And if it means your date has to wear a crown, too, I promise I'll be a good sport.",
        "Jessica: Oh, I don't think that you can be prom king if you don't go to this school.",
        "Brody: Damn it. There's my life's ambition, shot just like that. Hey. Is it true you can't be prom king if you don't go to Llanview High?",
        "Whitney: Thrones are reserved for students or the dates of students. Right, Darren?",
        "Darren: What she said.",
        "Brody: Then my vote wasn't wasted after all.",

        "Matthew's voice: There's no way the guy you saw Langston with could've been Markko?",
        "Destiny's voice: No, he was older.",
        "Matthew's voice: It wasn't Mr. G, was it?",
        "Destiny's voice: Ew! No.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: It's not what it looks like? Because it looks to me like you were having sex with the pizza girl.",
        "Ford: Calm down, okay? You have the wrong idea.",
        "Langston: I left my prom to come here. I was about to break up with a guy who actually cares about me because I wanted to be with you. And then I hear Cristian talking about you hooking up with the pizza girl?",
        "Karen: Hello? I have a name.",
        "Ford: Langston, will you just give me a chance? I'll explain everything.",
        "Langston: Why? How can I trust you again?",
        "Ford: You can.",

        "Ford: I've got a lot to say and no shoulder to lean on no one for my soul to bleed on and with the road in sight I feel the earth moving too much here that I'm losing",
        "Markko: And I'm not someone to cry for I'm not someone to try and lift your head as you walk by",
        "Langston: I'm not afraid of the distance I'm not afraid of resisting",
        "Ford and Langston: When everyone wants me to",
        "Ford: And please don't complicate my story",
        "Langston: Because I've been trying hard not to worry",
        "Ford: And I've had alterations",
        "Langston: Yeah, all my plans have had variations",

        "Roxy: Good! What happened with John?",
        "Natalie: Well, I did exactly what you told me to do. I left the letter for him on his desk and I told him exactly where to meet me, and I waited for him. He didn't show, so I'm out of here!",
        "Roxy: You got to give the guy a chance.",
        "Natalie: What are you talking about?! This was his chance, right here, right now, and he blew it! He chose Marty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You took it?",
        "Marty: Yes. I saw it was marked \"personal\" and I knew who it was from. So I took it and I read it, and I was right on this. Natalie was making another play for you.",
        "John: I can't picture you doing that.",
        "Marty: I know. But I was convinced that if you read it, you would choose Natalie. And I wanted to make sure that you never found out.",
        "John: What changed your mind?",
        "Marty: Dorian.",
        "John: Dorian?",
        "Marty: Yeah. Believe it or not, Dorian. What she said tonight about Starr and Cole--how they love each other and how they stayed together no matter what, even when Todd did everything he could to try to stop it. I don't ever want to do to anyone what Todd has done to Starr and Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole? Your fairy godmother even took away your handcuffs.",
        "Cole: Yeah, not for long. Your dad's jail cell is across from mine, and if he realizes that I'm gone, he's gonna raise hell.",
        "Starr: No, he wouldn't. Okay, maybe he would.",
        "Cole: I know things are messed up. But we both remember how things were. Right? So can we go there for one night? Just be in love and forget about everything else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: There you are. I thought I lost you.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Sorry.",
        "Brody: You up for another dance?",
        "Jessica: I was actually gonna go fix my makeup.",
        "Brody: Hey, there's nothing to fix. You're perfect. But if you think you need to come up with an excuse to ditch me...",
        "Jessica: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Brody: It scared you, didn't it?",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Brody: When we were dancing before, you had that memory?",
        "Jessica: I told you, I didn't remember.",
        "Brody: Jessica, come on. For months you've thought of me as a stranger. But in that one moment, you saw me. The door opened just a crack and you got a glimpse of what was behind it.",
        "Jessica: There's no door. I didn't see anything.",
        "Brody: You will. Because now that you know it's there, you can't run away from it anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How long has this been going on? Have you been playing me this whole time?",
        "Ford: You're not listening to me.",
        "Langston: No, no, I'm listening to you. I'm just not buying it because it's bull.",
        "Ford: Okay. All right, here's what happened tonight. I called to order a pizza. Karen shows up. She sees that I'm missing you and she pounces.",
        "Karen: What?!",
        "Ford: She started kissing me and then taking off her clothes and taking off my clothes. Langston, I'm only human.",
        "Karen: You're only full of it.",
        "Ford: It was a weak moment. I had no intention of it ending up like this.",
        "Langston: I wish I could believe that.",
        "Karen: Don't. You know better. On the other hand, you are the same girl that left a great guy like Markko for this jerk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew's voice: Are you positive?",
        "Destiny's voice: Would I say something like this if I wasn't, like, 1,000% sure?",
        "Matthew's voice: Poor Markko.",
        "[Snaps video camera shut]",
        "Markko: Where's Destiny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Again? Why can't you just leave me alone?",
        "Darren: Not possible. Don't you know what you do to me? Ohh, the hand again. Bossy-- I love bossy.",

        "Darren: Can you see the girl is busy?",
        "Destiny: What's wrong?",
        "Markko: I need to talk to you. I'm sorry, man, it's important.",

        "Ford: Whoa. One thing has nothing to do with the other.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? Ford, I asked you if you were sleeping with anyone else and you said no.",
        "Ford: Because I wasn't! Langston, tonight was the first time!",
        "Langston: No! No, I think you knew exactly what you were gonna get when you ordered your deluxe thin crust. I mean, why can't you just man up and admit you've been cheating on me?",
        "Ford: Because I wasn't. Langston, this didn't mean anything to me.",
        "Langston: Well, it means something to me. For months, every time I was with you, I died a little inside. I hated going behind Markko's back, but I cared about you too much to let you go.",
        "Ford: I--I care about you, too.",
        "Langston: Uh-uh. Because if you can jump into bed with any woman and say that it means nothing, then obviously I don't mean anything, either.",

        "Nate: Well, as long we're both dateless, we might as well dance.",

        "Brody: I think you went back to high school because you felt safe. So whenever something from your old life threatens to walk through that door I was talking about, you're afraid to let it in. Look, all I'm saying is you don't have to be afraid, Jess. I would never let anything or anyone ever hurt you again.",

        "John: Why?",
        "Marty: You know, it's amazing how long you can live in denial. I've been doing it for months. But today, I was finally honest with myself, and it scared me, and I--I don't want to be scared, John. Not with you. I can't live like that.",
        "John: Hey, you don't have to be. There's nothing to be scared of.",
        "Marty: You know, I'd love to think so. I'd love to hear a few reassuring words and have it be enough. But if I took that letter and I was prepared to lie about it, that is just not right, and I thought I left that person behind. I don't want to go there again, and I can't be with someone who brings that out in me.",

        "Marty: Yes, yes. But we've talked about it already, and we just pretended that we settled it, but we hadn't. You still have feelings for Natalie, and if I hadn't gotten pregnant, we would've had this conversation months ago.",

        "Roxy: Not in a million years. The guy is nuts about you.",
        "Natalie: No, no, I am the one who's nuts for writing that stupid letter. Just please give me back my plane ticket, all right?",

        "Destiny: Well--but what if it was for the play?",
        "Markko: The play?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. Langston needed help with a scene, so she asked Ford to help her act it out?",
