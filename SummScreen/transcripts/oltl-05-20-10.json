        "Blair: Go.",
        "T\u00e9a: This must be an all-time low for you--spending the night hanging out here babysitting me, as opposed to across the hall with your rather hunky boyfriend.",
        "Blair: Oh, God, he is hunky, isn't he?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Blair: You know what? I'll live.",
        "T\u00e9a: I won't.",
        "Blair: I'm sorry.",
        "T\u00e9a: Eh, don't be. You have the rest of your life to spend with Eli but only a couple more months to kick me around. I'm gonna call Dani. Here. Uhh... ohh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Oh, and how weird was it when Mr. Vega was named prom king?",
        "Destiny: How could that even happen? He's a teacher.",
        "Darren: A bunch of crushed-out girls probably wrote his name in.",
        "Nate: You jealous?",
        "Darren: Not even close. I know my lady has only got eyes for me.",
        "Destiny: Whatever.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dani: Oh. Oh, it's my mom. I better get this.",
        "Nate: Uh, anybody want more soda?",
        "Matthew: No. I'm okay.",
        "Darren: For my lady?",
        "Destiny: Fine. Having fun?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. You?",
        "Destiny: Kind of, but I know who isn't having fun--Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Markko, what are you doing?",
        "Markko: What does it look like I'm doing? At least now you won't be cheating on me anymore when you jump back into bed with Ford.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Markko: I'm leaving you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I need to see Cristian.",
        "Ford: But he's not here.",
        "Jessica: Of course not. He's probably out celebrating. It was stupid of me to come.",
        "Ford: Whoa, wait a second. You seem upset. Why don't you come on in for a minute?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Natalie, what are you doing here?",
        "Natalie: Just hoping that your night went a little better than mine.",
        "Brody: What happened?",
        "Natalie: Hmm, you remember that letter that I wrote to John where I said if he had any feelings for me, he could just come to Rodi's at midnight?",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Well, obviously, he doesn't feel a damn thing for me because he never showed up.",
        "Natalie's voice: I'll be at Rodi's at midnight. If I don't se you there, then this is good-bye.",
        "Natalie: So, I guess this is good-bye.",
        "Brody: Good-bye?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I'm leaving Llanview for good.",
        "Natalie: So I figured since you knew about my brilliant plan to see if I could have another chance with John, I'd catch you up to speed before I left.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do for you?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah. You can give me a ride to the airport.",
        "Brody: Heh heh. Uh, I'm not getting behind a wheel anytime soon. When's your flight?",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Natalie: 10 minutes. Awesome. Not gonna make it.",
        "Brody: Maybe it's a sign.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, a sign that I waited too long at Rodi's on the million- and-one chance that John would actually show up. Hmm. So much for thinking that I knew John better than he knew himself.",
        "[Natalie gulps]",
        "Natalie: Mm!",

        "[Footsteps]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Roxy: Hey. Where's Natty?",
        "John: I don't know.",
        "Roxy: It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're here because I was right. You're as gaga about Natalie as she is about you.",

        "Blair: Um--",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha ha!",
        "Blair: Look. I know you don't want to talk about it, but I'm really glad that you decided to go to treatment tomorrow, and you know what? Don't even think about backing down because you promised, and I might just have to slap you upside the head and drag you there myself.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that gonna cure me? Blair, what difference does it make? My condition is terminal. What does it matter if I have 6 months to live or 7 months to live?",
        "Blair: What difference does it make? She makes the difference. Don't you want to spend as much time with your daughter as you possibly can?",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Is everything okay?",
        "Dani: Yeah. It's just my mom trying to make sure I'm having fun. Where's your date?",
        "Nate: Whitney? She's in the ladies room. I'm guessing there's a full-length mirror in there.",
        "Dani: Aren't you having a good time?",
        "Nate: I was when I almost danced with you.",
        "Dani: Oh, well, we'll have plenty of time for that in the school play. Just hope I don't make a fool out of myself.",
        "Nate: Mm, no way. I'm counting on you to make me look good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You know, Matthew, it's gonna be kind of hard for us, you know, playing Langston and Markko, saying all those lines about how we're so perfect for each other, when the real Langston is cheating on the real Markko.",
        "Matthew: Who knows? Maybe Markko forgave her, and now they're working things out.",
        "Destiny: Seriously, would you forgive your girl if she cheated on you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Can't we just talk about this?",
        "Markko: What is there to talk about?",
        "Langston: I want to explain what happened. Will you just at least let me explain?",
        "Markko: Okay. Fine. Yeah. Yeah. You owe me that much. I'd love to hear it. Why don't you start with how long you've been fooling around behind my back? When did you start sleeping with Ford?",
        "Langston: A few months ago.",
        "Markko: Wha--I'm sorry. Did you just say months? How many times did you sleep with him?",
        "Langston: Markko, that doesn't matter.",
        "Markko: It matters to me. How many times--2, 3?",
        "Langston: Don't do this.",
        "Markko: What, 23? 100?",
        "Langston: A lot, okay? I slept with him a lot.",
        "Markko: You--uh! How could you do this to me?!",
        "Langston: I'm so sorry.",
        "Markko: You're sorry?",
        "Langston: I never wanted this, Markko. I never meant for any of this to happen.",
        "Markko: Oh, did Ford make you do it?",
        "Langston: No, but, Markko--",
        "Markko: Then why? Why, Langston? All I ever did was love you.",
        "Langston: I know, and I do love you. I do love you, Markko.",
        "Markko: You love me? Well, then what was all that stuff with Ford? Was that just sex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Thanks.",
        "Ford: Sure.",
        "Jessica: Ford--",
        "Ford: Yeah?",
        "Jessica: Never mind. I'm sorry.",
        "Ford: For what?",
        "Jessica: Barging in on you. I'm a total mess, and I'm probably keeping you from something.",
        "Ford: Actually, my plans for the night kind of fell through, so why don't you tell me what happened? I mean, when I saw you last time, you were so excited about the prom, you couldn't wait.",
        "Jessica: Oh... well, why not? I made a total fool out of myself in front of the entire school. I might as well tell you.",
        "Ford: I'm sure it wasn't that bad.",
        "Jessica: I rigged the vote so Cristian and I would be crowned prom king and queen. I just thought that it would change things for us. I thought that it would bring him back in time to where I am with our whole future ahead of us and we'd finally get together, but instead he asked Layla to marry him.",
        "Ford: Oh, wow. That's big news.",
        "Jessica: He's supposed to love me. How could he do this?",
        "Ford: Hey, Cristian is a fool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Answer me. Was it just sex, or are you in love with Ford?",
        "Langston: I don't know.",
        "Markko: What, you just had sex with him for no reason?",
        "Langston: No, no. I felt something. I thought it was real.",
        "Markko: You thought. You thought. Well, then did you just think that you loved me, too?",
        "Langston: I was confused. I was scared.",
        "Markko: Of what, me?",
        "Langston: No, of us. We were so young when we first got together. We were each other's first loves.",
        "Markko: I thought that meant something to you.",
        "Langston: It did. It did. It does, but it's just we started saying things like \"always\" and \"forever,\" and it terrified me, the thought that I would never know anything else.",
        "Markko: You don't think I had other opportunities, too? What, did you forget about your cousin Lola? She practically threw herself at me, and, yeah, she was psycho, but she was also pretty damn hot.",
        "Langston: Markko.",
        "Markko: And, oh, what about all of the girls on campus, huh? Yeah, chicks with smoking bodies and way more experienced than you. I could've slept with a ton of them if I wanted to, and, yeah, I thought about what it would be like, but that's where it always stopped, with the thought, because my next thought would always be how much I loved you, how much I didn't want anybody else. I would love you for the rest of my life, and I trusted that love. I trusted you!",
        "Langston: I know. I broke that trust, Markko.",
        "Markko: With Ford! What kind of sick S.O.B. could look me in the eyes every day knowing that he was sleeping with my girlfriend?",
        "Langston: Ford is a very good liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I know exactly how you feel. I was seeing this girl who was funny, smart, beautiful--a lot like you, actually--and she walked out on me. She went chasing after some other guy.",
        "Jessica: That's awful.",
        "Ford: I just wish things could have gone on the way they were, you know?",
        "Jessica: Oh, why can't anyone be loyal? You know, why are they chasing after something new when the best thing they've ever had is right under their nose?",
        "Ford: So what about this guy who was taking you to prom--Brody?",
        "Jessica: I tried to like him, but my heart is still with Cristian.",
        "Ford: Well, then why did you ask him to the prom if you knew that he never stood a chance?",
        "Jessica: Well, because I thought that he was a decent guy, but he's not. I never want to see him again for as long as I live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: And for what it's worth, my night was a bomb, too.",
        "Natalie: Mm, things didn't go so well at prom?",
        "Brody: Ha ha! That's the understatement of the year.",
        "Natalie: What happened?",
        "Brody: Ah, well, it started out great. You know, Jessica and I, we were connecting again, and then she set me straight on that real quick. She made it clear she wasn't gonna trade in her feelings for Cristian tonight or ever.",
        "Natalie: Why isn't this making me feel any better?",
        "Brody: That's a good question.",
        "Natalie: It's like love, right? Supposed to make you feel great. Just makes you feel stupid. You wake up wishing you could take back everything you did the night before.",
        "Brody: It didn't end with John not showing up at Rodi's tonight, did it?",
        "Natalie: No. No. I mean, why quit while you're behind? Oh, Roxy showed up, and I let her convince me to go find John. You know, maybe he hadn't found the letter. So I went to his office, and I got there right in time to see him locking lips with Marty with my letter open right in front of them.",
        "Brody: Oh, man.",
        "Natalie: It's okay. At least now I know without a doubt things are over for John and me for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know where Natalie is?",
        "Roxy: She was here. She was half-plastered. You know, I think her walking into your office and seeing you and Marty kissy face, I think it did a big number on her, and someone was gonna have to cart her out of here, and that's why I came back. Let me ask you something. If you came here for Natty, then why were you doing the tongue twister with the doc?",
        "John: Marty and I were saying good-bye.",
        "Roxy: Good-bye like in \"see you later\" good-bye or like \"hasta la pasta\" good- bye?",
        "John: Do you know where Natalie is, or not?",
        "Roxy: Well, if she's not still here, then she's gone.",
        "John: Obviously.",
        "Roxy: Hey, baby, I'm talking gone gone, and it's great that you came for her, but it's just a little too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What I said earlier about being there for you for treatment tomorrow, I'll be there. I mean, anything you need, I'm there, okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: You really are strange.",
        "Blair: Excuse me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha ha! When things are at their worst, that's when you're at your best.",
        "Blair: Well, I am being fitted for wings and a halo later if you'd like to come along.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha ha! You know, the last time we were this close to being BFFs, we were stuck in that basement with that psycho Powell.",
        "Blair: God, like you'd ever let me forget it? I mean, you had to tell me this big secret because you thought that you were gonna die. I'm sorry. It's foot- in-mouth disease.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's okay. It's all right. It's true. I didn't want to die with the secret that I had a kid with Todd.",
        "Blair: You didn't want Dani to end up alone.",
        "T\u00e9a: But this time, I really am gonna die, and there's something that I need you to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I didn't realize good-bye meant she was leaving town tonight.",
        "Roxy: She got a ticket on the redeye to London. Oh, yeah. She's gone. That puppy is gone, gone, gone.",
        "John: Forgot that about her.",
        "Roxy: What?",
        "John: Oh, she acts first and asks questions later. Why didn't she just talk to me first?",
        "Roxy: Maybe you weren't ready to listen, but, you know, you can call her tomorrow and have a jolly good talk with her, but in the meantime, why don't we celebrate? I say you raid your top-shelf hooch and we celebrate the future that youse two guys are gonna have. What? Come on. You're not on duty. There's nothing else that you can do tonight.",
        "John: Maybe there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Mm, I am not sorry for what I did. I mean, embarrassed, absolutely, but at least now I know for sure where I stand.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Join the club.",
        "Natalie: Mm, okay. Out with it. Just tell me what happened tonight.",
        "Brody: Jessica remembered something.",
        "Natalie: Are you serious? What? Tell me.",
        "Brody: Uh, Jessica looked at me the way she used to. It was only a moment, but I saw my Jessica there, and in that split second, she knew what we meant to each other.",
        "Natalie: Well, did you call mom and dad?",
        "Brody: No. There was nothing to tell. Jessica denied it right after it happened. She denied remembering anything, that she felt anything. You know, it was still all about Cristian for her. She even rigged the vote for prom king and queen.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Brody: Yeah. She stuffed the ballot box to make it look like everyone voted for her and Cristian. She fully expected them to go up on that stage and get their crowns and--",
        "Natalie: Oh, no, and she thought Cristian was gonna go along with that?",
        "Brody: He rejected her right there in front of everybody.",
        "Natalie: Poor Jessica.",
        "Brody: Ha! But that wasn't the end of it. Huh. Cris proposed to Layla. Jess overheard.",
        "Natalie: Oh, God.",
        "Brody: Yeah, so by the time I got her home, she was pretty much a wreck.",
        "Natalie: Brody, I'm really sorry.",
        "Brody: I just wanted Jess to know that it wasn't the end of the world, that maybe it was the beginning, you know, especially if she's starting to remember things again, but she didn't want to hear it, so I got desperate. I thought if I could just get her to understand that her memories were right there, just under the surface, that I'd get her back.",
        "Natalie: What did you do?",
        "Brody: Exactly what everybody told me not to do. I told Jess she couldn't remember because she didn't want to, that she was stuck in an innocent time because Mitch tried to rape her.",
        "Natalie: Mm, what happened?",
        "Brody: Not only Jessica not remember or believe me. She hates me for even saying it.",
        "Natalie: Ohh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Brody said the most vile thing about my father, you know, not the man that raised me, but still, oh, it makes me sick to even think about it. How could he do that?",
        "Ford: I don't know.",
        "Jessica: He's supposed to be this hero, but really, he's just an insensitive jerk, and that's how he tries to get me to like him?",
        "Ford: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: It's just--",
        "Ford: I'm really sorry. Hey, you want something to drink, maybe some wine?",
        "Jessica: Hey! I am underage.",
        "Ford: No, you're not. Listen. I know this whole thing has been really confusing for you, but you're not a baby, so I'm not gonna treat you like one.",
        "Jessica: Tell Brody that.",
        "Ford: He's not here. So what do you say? I got a nice red.",
        "Jessica: My grandfather always tells me-- he always told me not to trust men who try to ply me with liquor.",
        "Ford: If I had a granddaughter, I'd say the same thing.",
        "Jessica: You would?",
        "Ford: If she was underage, hell yeah.",
        "Jessica: But, like you said, I'm not underage.",
        "Ford: Well, it's still a good rule. You know, some guys will stop at nothing to get a girl to be with them.",
        "Jessica: But you're not like that.",
        "Ford: Definitely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I hate myself for what I did to you. I made such a huge mistake.",
        "Markko: A mistake? Once is a mistake. Not so many times that you can't even count. Where'd you do it? Here?",
        "Langston: Don't. Don't do that.",
        "Markko: In our bed?",
        "Langston: No, of course not.",
        "Markko: What, at Ford's place? No, no, no, no, because Cris and Layla would've said something about that.",
        "Langston: Markko, you don't want to do this.",
        "Markko: Oh, I'm getting warm, huh? It had to be somewhere private. Ford's office.",
        "Langston: Oh, God.",
        "Markko: Hannah was right all along. You were the girl with Ford in his office. That day I caught you in there and you said that you were missing a button? What'd he do-- rip open your shirt?",
        "Langston: I was such an idiot.",
        "Markko: No. No, no, no. I'm an idiot. All those times, all those times I asked you what was up with you and you made me feel guilty for acting jealous and suspicious.",
        "Langston: I was so wrong. I was wrong.",
        "Markko: \"Don't wait up for me, Markko.\" \"I have to go to rehearsal, Markko.\" \"I'm gonna be up all night writing, Markko.\"",
        "Langston: I was writing.",
        "Markko: Yeah, with Ford! He helped you, didn't he? Yeah, he helped you good. You know, that whole play is nothing but a lie.",
        "Langston: No. No, it is not lies. I wrote exactly what happened when we got together. I remembered every word you said to me.",
        "Markko: Oh, you mean--you mean the ones that made you feel trapped? Yeah, where's that scene, huh? The one where Markko tells Langston how much he loves her, and she turns around and stabs him in the back.",
        "Langston: I never meant to hurt--",
        "Markko: And on prom night, of all nights. You ditch me to go run off with Ford, knowing that I had something special planned for you.",
        "[Langston crying]",
        "Markko: No. No. The night I found Ford in the hotel room, and I told him that I was gonna re-create the best night of my life for you, he had a girl with him. It was you. The girl Ford was bragging about was you. You look at me! You were there!",
        "Langston: Yes. It was me. I was there.",
