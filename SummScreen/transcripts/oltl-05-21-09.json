        "Jessica senses that something is not right when she goes to the hospital with her baby. Outside the exam room, Viki, Clint, Todd, Marty and others are privately talking about what's going to happen when Jessica finds out that her baby died and that Chloe is actually Starr and Cole's child. At the same time, Marcie and Michael inform Starr and Cole that the baby they exhumed was not Hope and that makes absolutely no sense. Starr concludes that that could mean that Hope is alive. But Cole doesn't want to get his hopes up. Todd and Marty know they need to both get home and talk to their two respective kids. Yet they know that this will be devastating for Jessica. Blair and John are ok after the explosion. But Tea is in critical condition and taken to the hospital. Gigi takes Shane home to live with her. Rex agrees to the arrangement. Jessica knows that something is wrong. So she bolts with the baby and drives off and turns into Bess."

        "Stacy: Well, Rex and I can take it from here. Shane is obviously just fine. In fact, you didn't even need to come back here with us.",
        "Gigi: Oh, yes, I did. Shane, pack your bags. You're coming home with me.",
        "Shane: What? No way.",
        "Gigi: Now! And don't forget your inhaler.",
        "Shane: You're just going to let her do this?",
        "Rex: Give us a sec, okay?",
        "Rex: Okay, look. It's been a rough night for all of us. You're tired --",
        "Gigi: Don't even try to handle me, Rex. My son ended up in the emergency room while in your care because he had so much junk food.",
        "Rex: He got it from Moe and Noelle.",
        "Gigi: You didn't sit them down and warn them about his meds and what he could and couldn't have?",
        "Rex: I wasn't here when they picked him up. And it's not Stacy's fault --",
        "Gigi: Argh! Uh-uh. If I have to hear that one more time -- Shane is coming home with me.",
        "Rex: You can't just take him. He needs both his parents.",
        "Gigi: Then come with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: What happened?",
        "Cole: We fell asleep.",
        "Starr: Where's Jack?",
        "Cole: Upstairs, with Sam. I'll go check on them.",
        "Starr: Cole -- are our parents back yet?",
        "Cole: Uh, not yet, but John's on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Chloe!",
        "Jessica: Chloe?",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're okay. You're okay. Oh, my God. My baby -- thank God you're okay. Oh, sweetie, mama's so sorry. She'll never let anyone take you away from her again, okay?",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I think you need to sit down.",
        "Jessica: No, I'm fine. I'm fine, I have her back, I'm fine.",
        "Brody: Where'd you guys find her?",
        "Jessica: Can we just talk about this later? I just want to get my little girl back home where she belongs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, the boys are still asleep.",
        "Starr: Good. I want to find your mom and my parents before they wake up.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'm going to call Bo. We should have heard something by now.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Cole: Here. Call Bo and run if there's a problem.",
        "Starr: Okay. Police",
        "Officer: You know these folks?",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.",
        "Marcie: Hey.",
        "Cole: Hi.",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "Marcie: Hi. You kids okay?",
        "Starr: We're fine.",
        "Marcie: Any word on your parents?",
        "Starr: We thought maybe that's why you guys are here.",
        "Michael: John didn't call you?",
        "Cole: No, no. I haven't heard anything since we talked last night, but then I've been at the hospital since then --",
        "Marcie: We wouldn't have come so early, but -- well, we felt that you deserved to know as soon as possible.",
        "Starr: What's going on?",
        "Michael: I got the results back from some of the preliminary tests that were run on the baby's body.",
        "Cole: So do you know why Hope died?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, you can't leave until you get checked out.",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. I'm fine now that I have my little sugarplum back, huh?",
        "Viki: But Brody thinks you're having some sort of a problem.",
        "Brody: They definitely need to take a look. She had these pains in her head and then she passed out.",
        "Jessica: I had an anxiety attack, okay? My daughter was missing. Look, I'm cured.",
        "Clint: Sweetheart, we certainly hope so, but with your medical history, the hepatitis and everything else, I don't want to take a chance. You're going to see a doctor.",
        "Marty: It wouldn't be a bad idea to have the baby examined.",
        "Jessica: Why? She's fine. I mean, look at her.",
        "Jessica: Is there a problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: No. I don't know why the baby died. And after last night -- after last night, the fact is that we may never know because there isn't going to be a new autopsy.",
        "Starr: I don't understand. Isn't that why we decided to get her exhumed in the first place?",
        "Michael: Yes, it is. But it's not possible now.",
        "Cole: Are you saying we did this for nothing?",
        "Michael: No, no. Of course not.",
        "Marcie: I think that you should just start at the beginning.",
        "Michael: Yeah, okay. So, we know -- we decided to do this because we discovered that the baby could not have died of Rh disease.",
        "Starr: Right, because Cole and I aren't incompatible.",
        "Michael: Yes. So apparently Dr. Joplin made an error.",
        "Cole: More than one. She gave Starr a lock of hair that she said was Hope's and it wasn't.",
        "Michael: Yeah. So see, because of these errors, the medical examiner had to verify her identity before he could even begin an autopsy.",
        "Marcie: They had to make sure that the baby was the right baby.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Cole: I'm -- I'm sorry, the what?",
        "Michael: The M.E. ran this new kind of test. It's not as accurate as a DNA test, but it's faster. They compare your antibodies to the baby's antibodies.",
        "Marcie: They don't match.",
        "Cole: Okay, what does that mean?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I really don't understand.",
        "Marcie: The baby that they took out of the grave -- it isn't Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Marty's got a point, you know. Chloe was kidnapped, so you really should make sure that she wasn't harmed in any way, darling.",
        "Marty: It wouldn't hurt, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Did you -- did you take my baby?",
        "Marty: No. I would never do something like that.",
        "Jessica: But Uncle Todd would.",
        "Todd: Not this time.",
        "Jessica: Well, then who took her?",
        "[Chloe cries]",
        "Jessica: Shh, shh, shh.",
        "Todd: Our crazy cousin, that's who.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Blair? T\u00e9a? Blair?",
        "Blair: John? John? Is that you?",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Blair: John?",
        "[John groans]",
        "John: Hang on, I'm coming.",
        "[Blair groans]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Blair: John --",
        "John: Are you hurt?",
        "Blair: I don't know. I think I'm -- I'm all right. What happened? There was so much gas.",
        "John: Yeah. Rebecca lit a match, and the place blew.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. Marty and Todd are upstairs.",
        "John: They're fine. They got out.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. But what about -- here, help me up.",
        "John: You think you can stand?",
        "Blair: I don't know.",
        "John: It's okay.",
        "Blair: What about Powell?",
        "John: Don't worry about -- don't worry about Powell.",
        "Blair: No, no. You don't understand. He's got my kids. He's got my kids.",
        "John: Powell's dead. Powell's dead. The kids are taken care of, all right? There's police at the house.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "John: There's police at the house.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "John: Cole and Starr are with the boys, okay?",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "John: All right.",
        "Blair: Okay. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Okay, so what happened? Did you dig up the wrong grave?",
        "Marcie: No, no. I was there, and I know I told you not to come, but I just couldn't stay away.",
        "Starr: No, I'm glad you were there.",
        "Marcie: I just wanted to be there for her, you know?",
        "Starr: We went, too -- after. It was the right grave. We saw it, too.",
        "Cole: Okay, I don't get it. Are you saying that we buried someone else's child?",
        "Michael: I'm afraid so.",
        "Starr: Then where's Hope?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I was tied to a chair and I had Chloe on my lap.",
        "Todd: Cousin Powell held a knife to my throat. Ow, ow, ow.",
        "Nurse: If you'd hold still, Mr. Manning --",
        "Viki: How on earth did you get away?",
        "Marty: John showed up, and he actually killed Powell just when he was about to shoot Todd.",
        "Todd: I really don't need all that stuff.",
        "Nurse: You need a tetanus shot.",
        "Clint: So what happened to Blair and T\u00e9a?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I smelled gas and I figured I'd better get the baby and Marty out of there.",
        "Marty: John's looking for them.",
        "Clint: Viki, I'm going to call Bo and make sure he's up to speed.",
        "Viki: Thank the Lord you survived. I mean, what a nightmare.",
        "Jessica: What I don't understand is why Chloe? What does she have to do with any of this? I was never close with Powell. I haven't seen him since I was a kid. If this is all about Todd, I don't understand why they didn't take one of his kids. Why mine?",
        "Todd: Because he was crazy. That's why they put him away.",
        "Doctor: Mrs. Brennan, we can see you now.",
        "Jessica: That's really not necessary.",
        "Viki: But she'll be happy to cooperate.",
        "Todd: Viki, can I speak with you a second?",
        "Viki: I think I'm going to go with Jessica.",
        "Brody: I'll go with you if that's okay.",
        "Brody: Jessica, it's only going to take a couple of minutes.",
        "Viki: Could we do this later? I really need to deal with the doctor.",
        "Todd: No, we need to do it right now. We have to talk about Chloe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, I am not going to keep you and Shane apart, but he is coming home with me. And if you want him with you all the time, then you're going to have to come with us, and you're welcome to do so.",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah. That'll be fun. You, Shane, Rex, and Brody.",
        "Gigi: Brody doesn't live with me, and this is none of your damn business.",
        "Stacy: Oh, pardon me for caring. I just don't think it's particularly healthy for your son to be in the middle of your love life.",
        "Rex: She's right. Gigi, with or without Brody, this would never work.",
        "Gigi: Then we'll make another arrangement. I raised him on my own for 10 years. And, yeah, things weren't always easy, but when we had problems, we would work them out. So we'll work this out, too. I'm just not giving up my son.",
        "Rex: You should have thought of that before you slept with Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Would you say you were disoriented?",
        "Jessica: No, it was nothing like that. I had an anxiety attack. My daughter was missing.",
        "Brody: Jessica, you passed out.",
        "Jessica: No, I was hyperventilating. It was nothing.",
        "Brody: You had all that pain in your head.",
        "Clint: Brody, can I have a word with you?",
        "Brody: Sure.",
        "Clint: Son, I know that you're trying to help, but you have to let Jessie tell the doctor what happened.",
        "Brody: That's just it, sir. She's not telling him what happened. It wasn't just nothing. She freaked out.",
        "Clint: You'd better tell me about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, Viki, Powell said some things about Chloe. Of course, we didn't want to bring them up in front of Jessica. But he said that Chloe was not Jessica's baby.",
        "Viki: Oh, God.",
        "Todd: Which is one of the reasons we brought her here, because we wanted to have a DNA test run on --",
        "Viki: Hang on. Powell was right. Chloe is -- oh, God -- she's not Jessica's baby. She's Starr's and Cole's child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: How could someone else's baby end up in Hope's grave and no one notice?",
        "Starr: Okay, you know what, guys? Can we all take this into the other room because Jack and Sam are sleeping and I don't want to have to explain --",
        "Marcie: Of course.",
        "Cole: Michael, I'm serious. Aren't there people that keep track of this kind of thing?",
        "Michael: Yeah, there are people that keep track of this kind of thing.",
        "Cole: Okay, then what happened?",
        "Starr: Cole, please? Could you come into this room?",
        "Marcie: Michael and I, we have been trying to figure this out all night long.",
        "Michael: The hospital has a chain of custody for every movement that baby made that night.",
        "Marcie: Which means that the only place there could have been a mix-up was at the funeral home.",
        "Michael: And they're not open yet.",
        "Marcie: But we did make a phone call, and we are going to go over there, so --",
        "Cole: Okay, wait. So you're saying that Hope's body was sent to the funeral home, and then what? There was another dead baby from another hospital and there was some kind of mix-up? I mean, come on.",
        "Michael: It's so frustrating, I know.",
        "Marcie: And upsetting --",
        "Michael: But it's the only explanation.",
        "Starr: Unless -- unless she's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: I see you spent some time at St. Ann's recently.",
        "Jessica: Yes. Yes, but I'm fine.",
        "Doctor: Why were you there? Are you all right?",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. I -- it was a really tough time and your question -- it just reminded me -- my husband had died tragically. I had just given birth and I -- I needed some time to recover. So, I'm fine now. I'm fine. I'm fine. Right, Chloe? Huh? Mommy's fine. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You think you can make it up the stairs on your own?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I think so.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Blair: What about you?",
        "John: I've got to go back in there.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. Oh, my God -- T\u00e9a.",
        "John: Go upstairs and wait for the cops.",
        "Blair: No, John. I'm going to help you.",
        "[Clatter]",
        "Blair: I hear somebody upstairs.",
        "Bo: John? I called emergency services. They'll be there.",
        "Bo: John?",
        "Blair: We're down here. In the basement.",
        "Bo: Blair? Are you okay?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Bo: What the hell happened?",
        "John: Gas leak. The whole place blew.",
        "Bo: Where's Powell?",
        "John: Upstairs -- dead.",
        "Bo: Who've we got here?",
        "John: T\u00e9a.",
        "Bo: Hey!",
        "Blair: Is she going to make it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You knew that Chloe was our granddaughter?",
        "Viki: I've known for about 20 minutes, okay? I found out this evening, after she was taken. I don't have any hard evidence, okay? I just have -- uh, I have the word of someone who was in a position to know.",
        "Todd: Who is that?",
        "Viki: It doesn't matter now, okay? But the thing is, you're right. We have to have a DNA test done just to confirm what we all apparently believe to be true.",
        "Marty: All of us except Jessica.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Viki: She'll have to be told.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Are you okay?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I thought I'd killed her. My daughter's child -- I thought that because of what I planned, the three of us going away, that that's what I deserved and of course she was going to die.",
        "Marty: Your brother has this problem -- he thinks he's God.",
        "Viki: I've noticed.",
        "Todd: Listen, you guys. I thought I'd taken my daughter's child away for good.",
        "Viki: So maybe you should be the one to give her back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I know that it's crazy to think that our baby could still be alive, but what are the odds of a funeral home having two babies on the same day?",
        "Cole: Starr, we went to Dr. Joplin's office. We saw her. She was dead.",
        "Starr: What if that wasn't Hope? What if it was some other baby? Think about it. Dr. Joplin said that she was sent to NICU. She came out and said that she was fine and then she said that she was dead. There was no record of her being in NICU. Remember how crazy we all thought that that was? What if that's when she got lost or whatever? There are more chances of her being switched up in the hospital than there are at a funeral home. She could be alive.",
        "Marcie: I want to believe that. I've had those same thoughts, Starr, but it would take a miracle.",
        "Starr: But it's a possibility. That's just all I'm saying.",
        "Marcie: You have no idea how much I want to believe that.",
        "Starr: I've always believed it.",
        "Cole: What do you mean?",
        "Starr: Ever since I found out, I had a feeling that it wasn't real. And I would dream about her, Cole. And when I held Jessica's little girl, Chloe, I had this overwhelming feeling that our baby was still alive.",
        "Cole: Why didn't you say something?",
        "Starr: Because I knew that you would look at me like you're looking at me right now. Don't you feel it sometimes? Don't you feel like our little girl is out there just waiting for us to find her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: She's adorable.",
        "Jessica: You have no idea how terrified I was when she was taken from me.",
        "Doctor: I'm sure you're anxious to get her home, so we'll make this quick. I'll get a nurse to take her so we can get started --",
        "Jessica: No! No one's taking her from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: So, are you going to fight her on this?",
        "Rex: No. I'm going to let Shane decide where he wants to live.",
        "Stacy: Oh.",
        "Rex: Why, what's wrong with that?",
        "Stacy: Nothing, it's just he's a kid, that's all.",
        "Rex: Yeah, a kid who has rights.",
        "Stacy: And who would eat cookie dough for breakfast if we let him.",
        "[Clanging]",
        "Stacy: I'm just saying he got sick last night for a reason. It's not just Moe and Nicole.",
        "Rex: Noelle, and she should've known better than to let him eat whatever he wanted.",
        "Stacy: Well, they're not his parents.",
        "Rex: Fine! It's my fault. I should've laid down the law -- it won't happen again.",
        "Stacy: No, I'm not blaming this on you, Rex -- you're a great father. It's just that's the point -- he needs you to take the lead.",
        "Rex: He needs me to back him up. And if he wants to stay here, I have to support that.",
        "Stacy: Okay, and in one week, two weeks maybe, and he's in knots because he feels guilty all of a sudden for leaving his mom for you?",
        "Rex: He can go back to Gigi.",
        "Stacy: Okay, but then he'll feel guilty for leaving you. He'll be ping-ponging across town -- is that what you want to do to him?",
        "Rex: No, but I --",
        "Stacy: I know he's going to get mad at you for laying down the law, but it's better than seeing him tear himself up over making a decision he's too young to make.",
        "[Crash]",
        "Shane: So am I staying or going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "E.M.T.: One, two, three.",
        "John: Powell had help. He got Rebecca Lewis to let him in and out of the Sitwell Institute. He had this strange idea that he was going to make it up to Marty by killing anyone who had hurt her. Talia was just wrong place, wrong time. Tonight he was going to kill Manning.",
        "Bo: What about Rebecca?",
        "John: She must've got caught in the blast. Let's see what CSU can find down here.",
        "Bo: God, what a mess, but at least it's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Cole: Yeah, I dream about her, too. You know, sometimes I let myself think about what she'd be like -- you know, like we did last night at her grave?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: At age two, six, her losing her teeth, going to school. But I -- I can't, Starr. I can't go there because it's not real.",
        "Starr: What if it is? I mean, you didn't fully believe that your mom was dead, right? You thought that she was alive, and she was.",
        "Cole: No \u0096",
        "Starr: What if it's the same for Hope?",
