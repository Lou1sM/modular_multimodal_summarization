        "John assumes that Natalie has taken off on the last flight and it's too late for them, after reading her letter and finding out that she loves him. But Kelly encourages him not to give up on her. She assumes that John has made his decision and has dumped her for Marty. She visits Brody who is similarly distraught over losing Jessica. They drink and end up sleeping together. And she concludes that she has to move to London. Jessica is ready to sleep with Ford and let him help her get over both Cristian and Brody. But she somehow senses that it would not be right. She then remembers everything in her life including her daughter, her relationship with Brody and her present. And when Brody least expects it, she comes to see him and admits that she now remembers everything. Rex and Gigi get arrested by Otto in Santa Fe for breaking and entering. He attempts to call Bo to ask him for help but cannot bring himself to admit that he screwed up. He tells Gigi that he is ready to give up on finding his real parents. But she somehow knows that he cannot do that."

        "Rex: Hey, hey, hey, this is a violation of our civil rights.",
        "Cop: You violated Otto's civil rights when you broke into his store.",
        "Rex: We get a phone call.",
        "Cop: Yeah, in the morning. It's too late to call anybody tonight.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Well, if you hadn't spent the whole day walking us through booking, it wouldn't be so late.",
        "Cop: Clerk is open in the morning. You get your call then.",
        "Rex: This isn't fair. You know, Bo--",
        "Cop: You pipe down, or I'll find something else to charge with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hi. My name is John McBain. I'm from Llanview Police Department. I'm looking for a passenger-- Natalie Banks. She might be traveling under the name Natalie Buchanan. This is a picture. Maybe you saw her. She's supposed to be on a flight to London.",
        "Clerk: Oh, flight 38 was scheduled to leave an hour ago.",
        "John: Ground control said it was late.",
        "Clerk: It was. There is a long hold.",
        "John: Please check.",
        "Clerk: I show wheels up about five minutes ago.",
        "John: Wheels up. That means it's gone?",
        "Clerk: The plane just took off. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: I'm speechless.",
        "Layla: So was I.",
        "Carlotta: Ay, congratulations to the both of you. This is such wonderful news.",
        "Layla: I'm so glad you're happy.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, of course I'm happy. Welcome to the family, and I didn't know. This was so sudden. Hmm, I had no idea.",
        "Cristian: I want to spend the rest of my life with Layla. She's the only woman for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What is that, like from a hotel?",
        "Ford: I confess. I took it. I've always wanted one.",
        "Jessica: It's cool.",
        "Ford: Yeah. Well, I figured the last thing that you would need tonight is to have Cristian barge in.",
        "Jessica: I don't even want to think about him. If he wants Layla, he can have her.",
        "Ford: Okay. If the guy can't see what a gem you really are, then--",
        "Jessica: I don't want to talk about him.",
        "Ford: Okay. We won't. Forget about that guy. Forget about Brody being a jerk. Tonight is all about you. I'll make you forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Because daddy has to watch the bad people in jail. Because he wants you to be safe. You eat your broccoli because mom says. Goodnight, princess.",
        "Gigi: Let me guess, she's four. Every other word is \"why.\" Every sentence I said for years started with \"because.\"",
        "Cop: You're a mom?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Rex and I have a son.",
        "Cop: That's Clyde Barrow there?",
        "Gigi: His name is Rex Balsom, Balsom because that's who raised him. We don't know who his biological parents are. They dropped him at a hospital and took off. Can you imagine doing that your baby?",
        "Cop: World is full of irresponsible people.",
        "Gigi: Maybe they were scared. Whatever. He was abandoned. He hasn't had a whole lot of breaks since then, but still, he's a good person. He's a good father, and, you know, there are quite a few people who would vouch for that if you would just let us have that call.",
        "Cop: I told you--",
        "Gigi: You're going to make us wait, make our son wait? You're gonna jerk Rex around because you can? Sir, why don't you be one of the good guys and give this man a break? I promise you, you won't regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Looks like our group has already cleared out.",
        "Nora: Well, that is fate saving us from ourselves. If Matthew thought we were spying on him--",
        "Bo: We better get a lot better at it than this.",
        "Nora: Ha ha ha!",
        "Carlotta: And of course I'm going to do all the catering, but the most important thing is to reserve the church.",
        "Bo: Hiya, Carlotta.",
        "Carlotta: Hey, Bo, Nora. Hey, you looking for someone?",
        "Nora: No.",
        "Carlotta: Matthew left a few minutes ago.",
        "Nora: Matthew? Oh, did he look like he was having fun?",
        "Bo: No details or anything.",
        "Layla: They want details.",
        "Carlotta: I think all the kids were having fun, but I got distracted by my own son here. Can we tell them?",
        "Cristian: Sure. Yeah.",
        "Layla: We are engaged.",
        "Nora: Oh, look at that.",
        "Bo: Way to go.",
        "Nora: It's beautiful. Congratulations.",
        "Carlotta: Nora, Nora, thank heaven you are here because I was just trying to convince them that the first important thing is to book the church.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. That's the key.",
        "Carlotta: And listen to her. Listen to her. She's got all the experience.",
        "Cristian: Mami--",
        "Carlotta: What? She's a woman. You're a woman. You know all about these things.",
        "Nora: Especially since I've been planning my second wedding in less than a year.",
        "Bo: I'm going to get us a table.",
        "Nora: No. It's okay. It's all right.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I offend?",
        "Nora: No. It's fine. You know, I should've taken a little more time, and then I would've saved everyone a lot of heartache.",
        "Bo: Don't take it all on yourself, okay? I could have spoken up a little.",
        "Nora: Important thing is that we are where we are supposed to be now, and nothing is going to mess that up again.",
        "Cristian: Amen to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I should go.",
        "Ford: Okay. Well, you just got here.",
        "Jessica: This is weird, okay? I don't even know you.",
        "Ford: You want to know who I am? Look right behind you--the Dirigo Award for best short film at the Bar Harbor film festival. Right back there is the Orange award for filmmaking. I got that in Lakeland, Florida. This one, I am most proud of. This puppy is the granddaddy of all. This is the Shram Award for cinematic excellence. I got this at the Indio film festival near L.A.",
        "Jessica: So it's like a real Hollywood film?",
        "Ford: Kind of, but you know, right now, I'm just happy to be teaching at the university while I work on my next project.",
        "Jessica: Tell me about it.",
        "Ford: No. You are the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen, and it's your prom night. There's no way I'm going to bore you or think about anything except you. You deserve all the attention tonight, to be adored, loved.",
        "Jessica: Then why doesn't he?",
        "Ford: That's his problem, Jess. He's an idiot not to see what's right in front of him, but I do, and that's all you need to know about me. I can care about you the way Cristian can't, and I will never hurt you the way Brody has.",

        "Kelly: Uh, what are you doing, McBain? Did Dorian send you here?",
        "John: No.",
        "Kelly: Okay, because it was a simple date. Well, not really that simple. We flew to New York to see a show, but I had a bodyguard. There was really no need to follow me.",
        "John: Yeah. Look. Dorian didn't send me. She didn't send me to protect you.",
        "Kelly: Then what, you have news about my mother's killer?",
        "John: It's not about your mother.",
        "Kelly: Oh.",
        "Reed: Reed Wagner.",
        "John: John McBain.",
        "Kelly: He's an old friend from London. We wanted to see a show, and Dorian has been obsessive about protection. She thinks that whoever killed Rodney and my mother might come after me, so it would be really, really great for many reasons if we had a break in the case.",
        "John: Unfortunately, I don't. It's not about that.",
        "Kelly: Then what's with the picture? You looking for someone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Cristian was supposed to be my first time.",
        "Ford: Well, that's his loss, Jess. I mean, he made a choice.",
        "Jessica: I still can't believe it.",
        "Ford: You know I can't believe? How it all worked out. I mean, you came here to find Cristian. You found me instead.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Ford: It's kind of like I'm supposed to be your first time.",
        "Jessica: You think?",
        "Ford: Well, I mean, I was here all alone waiting for you. I guess it's meant to be. I can take all that pain away, Jess. Let me turn this into the best night of your life.",

        "Kelly: Who is the picture of?",
        "John: I got to go, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: John, if you have a lead on my mother's killer and you're holding out on me--",
        "John: I'm not.",
        "Kelly: Okay. Then let's have a look. Maybe we've seen the person.",
        "John: This has nothing to do with you.",
        "Kelly: Got it. Can you give us a minute, please?",
        "Reed: I'll check the Asian markets.",
        "Kelly: I'm with John McBain. Nothing is going to happen to me.",
        "Shaun: I'm not worried about you. Are you okay alone with her?",
        "Kelly: Stop it. Go play with your gift bag.",
        "Shaun: I'm going to go check the Nikkei market myself.",
        "Kelly: Hey, what's wrong with you?",
        "John: Nothing.",
        "Kelly: You look-- I don't know. You look lost.",
        "John: I just hate airports.",
        "Kelly: John, come on. I thought we were friends.",
        "John: Hey, look. It's like I told you. It has nothing to do with you.",
        "Kelly: Okay. All right, and I bet it doesn't have anything to do with cop work, either.",
        "John: That's exactly it. I got a case on my mind.",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm, and if it were work, you would know what to do, and you wouldn't have that look on your face. I want to see the picture.",

        "[Natalie panting]",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: What just happened? It's like-- I don't know.",
        "Brody: Me, neither.",
        "Natalie: I think I'm going to blame it on the booze.",
        "Brody: Well, we wanted to forget...",
        "Natalie: True.",
        "Brody: Pretty drunk...",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Brody: And that still didn't kill the pain.",
        "Natalie: So we just went for it.",
        "Brody: How are you feeling now?",
        "Natalie: Still bad.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Natalie: Okay, so that didn't work. You have any other ideas?",
        "Brody: Ha ha!",
        "Natalie: Sorry. On a good note, we didn't cheat on anyone.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Nobody is waiting up for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Um--",
        "Ford: You okay? Hey, you're safe with me, baby. You can trust me.",
        "Jessica: Can I? It just feels so--",
        "Ford: What?",
        "Jessica: New, like you are a blank.",
        "Ford: That's a good thing, right? Blank slate, no bad memories.",
        "Jessica: That's true.",
        "Ford: So we'll make some new memories for you, good ones. I'll make you forget Cristian before the night is through. That's what you want, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: Hey, you, you really had me going this afternoon, sneaky.",
        "Cristian: What was that for?",
        "Carlotta: You know what that was for, that whole conversation we had about choosing between Jessica and Layla when the whole time, you had it all planned out.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Actually, I didn't.",
        "Carlotta: What you mean? You didn't know this afternoon you were going to propose tonight?",
        "Cristian: Well, when you said that I should choose, that's when I realized that I already had. I love Layla. I want to be with Layla, no questions asked. Thinking that I could've lost her because of Jessica, well, that's when I knew it was time to get serious.",
        "Carlotta: And you just happened to have a ring lying around the house?",
        "Cristian: Oh, no. I bought it at Logan's. Took me about an hour.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, you were in a hurry.",
        "Cristian: I found the right one. I love her, Mom.",
        "Carlotta: I know you do. I'm so happy for you.",
        "Cristian: Then why the face?",
        "Carlotta: Oh, well, I can't stop wondering how Jessica is going to take this news.",

        "Jessica: I want to get over Cristian, yes.",
        "Ford: You're a goddess. You know that?",
        "Jessica: I will get over him, right?",
        "Ford: I'll make sure of it.",

        "Bo: Matthew is already home.",
        "Nora: Oh, goo-- he still has another half an hour before his curfew. Oh, God, is this good? Is this good?",
        "Bo: He said the prom was great.",
        "Layla: Yeah. They looked like they had a lot of fun.",
        "Nora: So you did snoop-- I mean, watch.",
        "Layla: Chaperone.",
        "Nora: Better word. Yes. Okay. So what happened? Details. No. Wait. No. Don't. Uh!",
        "Bo: She's been like this all night.",
        "Nora: Well, it's not as if you haven't been nervous, either. I mean, it's not like it's a first date. I mean, close enough. Oh, he's just so crazy about Dani.",
        "Layla: Well, they had the fun a parent could approve of.",
        "Nora: Good. Great. Don't we want them to have more fun than that? Much more, just fun, but not-- do we? I think we want--",
        "Bo: Want to talk about wedding plans?",
        "Layla: No. You two enjoy. I'm going to go call Adriana. The best thing about her living in Paris is that it's never too late to call. See you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: One call. Make it quick.",
        "Gigi: You're a good father.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Cop: Don't thank me. Thank your wife.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Nora: Who is it?",
        "Bo: I don't know. Buchanan.",
        "Rex: Hey, Bo.",
        "Bo: Hey, Balsom, perfect timing.",
        "Rex: Yeah?",
        "Bo: Now, do you think a wedding should have ecru napkins with gold lettering or white napkins with platinum lettering?",
        "Rex: Do I have to vote?",
        "Bo: That's what I said. You know, people are going just get cake all over them, anyway, and so we should be talking about the band, you know, the bar, right?",
        "Rex: Yeah, absolutely. You sound good.",
        "Bo: Well, we are. How's it going out there? Any better luck since this morning?",
        "Rex: Not exactly.",
        "Bo: Just hang in there, Balsom. You're a good investigator. You will pick up the trail. Better than that, you will know what to do when you find a clue.",
        "Rex: Yeah. I like to think so, but--",
        "Bo: No buts. You know what you're doing.",
        "Rex: You sound sure.",
        "Bo: I am. A few years ago, you would've ended up in hot water without even trying, but now, you know better.",
        "Bo: So what's up? You need me to track something for you?",
        "Rex: No. Thanks.",
        "Bo: Something wrong?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Bo: Then why did you call so late?",
        "Rex: Is it? Gosh, I didn't notice the time. I've been so into the hunt.",
        "Bo: Balsom, what's up?",
        "Rex: I figured it out. I was trying to read an old record here at the county clerk's office, and they weren't being very helpful. I was thinking you might know, but I was looking at it just now, and I figured it out.",
        "Bo: Do you have a lead?",
        "Rex: Yeah. People haven't been very cooperative, but Gigi and I are on it. You get back to that wedding planning.",
        "Bo: I'll talk to you soon.",
        "Gigi: Why didn't you tell Bo we're in jail?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I don't know how Jessica's gonna react when she hears this.",
        "Carlotta: Did you see her tonight?",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah. She rigged the election for prom king and queen so the two of us would win.",
        "Carlotta: My goodness, that poor girl.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. It was horrible. Bad enough she embarrassed herself. She was really nasty to Layla, did everything she could to get in between us.",
        "Layla: I'm embarrassed it almost worked.",
        "Carlotta: Oh.",
        "Cristian: Jessica pushed you.",
        "Layla: But still, she can't help it, most of it. I kind of feel bad for her.",
        "Carlotta: Yeah. Well, given everything that happened to her when she was kidnapped, it's not surprising she's stuck in high school, still in love with Cristian.",
        "Cristian: It's not me. Jessica can't face what her father tried to do to her. Who could?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You okay, baby?",
        "Jessica: Yes. I want this. I want this.",
        "Jessica: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Uh, you know what, Brody? You're right. I mean, we don't have anyone to answer to, and John obviously made his choice.",
        "Brody: You sure?",
        "Natalie: Please don't give me hope.",
        "Brody: I'm only asking.",
        "Natalie: I put everything in that letter. I made it very clear for John. \"If you have the same feelings, then meet me at Rodi's,\" and the next time I saw him, he was at the station kissing Marty.",
        "Brody: Okay. I just want it to work out for someone.",
        "Natalie: It's gonna have to be someone else. John doesn't want me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Why do you have a picture of Natalie? Are you showing it around? Oh, my God, has she been kidnapped?",
        "John: No.",
        "Kelly: Is she missing? Do I have to call Kevin?",
        "John: Don't.",
        "Kelly: What about Viki? She's going to be so upset.",
        "John: Natalie is fine.",
        "Kelly: Then what?",
        "John: Leave it alone, okay? Everybody is okay.",
        "Kelly: You're not. John, what happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: No car keys?",
        "Natalie: Oh, no. I left them with Jeff, the bartender. I thought you were gonna give me a ride to the airport.",
        "Brody: Sorry. I was too drunk to drive.",
        "Natalie: That's okay. I really should've taken a cab.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry.",
        "Natalie: Stop. No. Don't apologize. Neither of us have anything to apologize for, not really.",
        "Brody: You're right. Ha ha ha!",
        "Natalie: You know, it was just two friends, you know, two friends, broken hearts, no one to answer to. I mean, it's not like either one of us think it's anything more, right?",
        "Brody: No. Nothing has changed.",
        "Natalie: So that's it. No harm, no foul.",
        "Brody: No. I'm okay with it if you are.",
        "Natalie: I will be.",
        "Brody: When, when you're far away from here?",
        "Natalie: Oh, Brody, that's not about you.",
        "Brody: Are you still moving to London?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You were looking for Natalie, but not in a cop way. You were looking for her.",
        "John: No. It just means it's probably none of your business.",
        "Kelly: Okay, but you're with Marty now, and you're looking for Natalie. Why?",
        "John: I was gonna stop her. I was gonna stop her from going to London.",
        "Kelly: She was leaving town?",
        "John: She did. I was too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, God, I don't know. You're right, Brody. Nothing has changed, and I can't take running into John and Marty every time I turn around.",
        "Brody: I get that.",
        "Natalie: So yes. I'm on the next flight back to London.",
        "Brody: Think I should go to the airport, too, flip a coin, take a plane.",
        "Natalie: I told you, you don't have to do that.",
        "Brody: Jessica hates me.",
        "Natalie: Are you sure?",
        "Brody: Should've seen her face when I told her Mitch tried to rape her and that's why her memory is gone. She didn't believe me, and she will hate me forever for even saying it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Stay away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me, Mitch! Get away from me! Stop that! You're a pervert! I'm your daughter! Just stop it!",

So if that's the way it was going to be, she was leaving town, and she said if I felt the same way that I should meet her Rodi's at midnight, and you have this look on your face like you're watching a movie.",
