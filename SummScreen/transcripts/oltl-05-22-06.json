        "TV newscaster: The heir apparent of Llanview's most prominent family will be laid to rest today. Demerest Buchanan, known as Duke, was killed in the collapse of St. Jude's rectory following last week's tornado. Mr. Buchanan's surgeon, Spencer Truman, had this to say.",
        "Spencer: Duke Buchanan passed away at 12:36 this afternoon, but the hospital will have no further statement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd is going to die tomorrow. Do you think the kids and me will be able to pack up and move on just like that, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: No, no, no. I'm sorry. Of course not. I'm just -- I'm just not thinking clearly. I mean, that boy died on my watch, my brother's missing. You know, I'm -- I'm starting to become just as overwhelmed as you are.",
        "Blair: Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Duke, and as far as David is concerned, he always, always lands on his feet. You know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Margaret Cochran is alive. She was in the bathroom, that bathroom when you got here.",
        "John: You'd say anything to save your own skin.",
        "David: You just shot Denton. You killed Denton. You're pointing the gun at me. I'm not lying.",
        "John: You're saying Margaret was here?",
        "David: Big as life.",
        "John: Then where is she now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. Margaret's alive. Margaret? Margaret Cochran? It is you, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Thanks for understanding. The last thing I want to do is make today about me, you know?",
        "Dorian: Hello, sweetheart.",
        "Blair: Hello.",
        "Dorian: Dr. Truman.",
        "Spencer: Dorian.",
        "Adriana: How you doing, Blair?",
        "Blair: I'm holding up. How about you, Adriana?",
        "Adriana: Just worried about Kelly.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Spencer: I gave her a mild sedative. She's resting comfortably.",
        "Blair: Like that's going to help. She lost Kevin, she lost Duke. She blames herself for it all. It's like a little pill's going to take that kind of pain away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andrew: Did you hear me, Todd? I'm trying to help you deal with the reality of your death.",
        "Todd: You mean I'm some kind of charity case? You think you can just volunteer to come on down to death row and see me off to my great reward -- is that it? Give me a break.",
        "Andrew: Actually, I didn't volunteer. Um -- I was asked to come here by an old friend.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah? Who's that?",
        "Andrew: Your sister, Viki.",

        "Nash: You all right?",
        "Tess: I've just never been to a funeral before. It's kind of creeping of me out. I just want it to be over.",

        "Bo: I've got some officers posted around just in case the press gets out of line.",

        "Adriana: Hi.",
        "Layla: Thanks for asking me to meet you. I really didn't want to face that church alone.",
        "Adriana: I know how you feel. God, I remember being here when Ginger Foley died. Duke and I had been fighting and it scared us both. And he made a point of telling me he loved me, in case anything were to happen. Nothing was supposed to happen, Layla. I mean, I know I'm the one who broke up with him, but if I knew that all of this was going to happen, that he'd end up turning to Kelly, that so many people would get hurt --",
        "Layla: Come here. What would you have done? Stayed with him? You and I both know that's a load of bull, not to mention not fair to anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: All right. How about a glass of water? Maybe a different blanket?",
        "Blair: Stop fussing over Kelly.",
        "Dorian: What do you mean? She's lived through hell. She -- she needs her comfort.",
        "Kelly: You can't help. Nobody can.",
        "Dorian: Kelly, come on, darling. You've been through an ordeal --",
        "Kelly: I want to go to the funeral.",
        "Dorian: Absolutely not!",
        "Kelly: I owe it to Duke, I owe it to Kevin.",
        "Dorian: I am -- there is no way. Kevin will be just fine and his family will take care of him.",

        "Tess: Hey, hey! The police Commissioner is right inside. You guys don't want to play by the rules, I'm sure he would love to kick a little paparazzi ass today, ok? Got it? Come on.",
        "Kevin: Tess, I --",
        "Tess: Expecting somebody else?",
        "Kevin: I'm just a little surprised, I guess.",
        "Tess: Duke was a cool kid. He got me. He was the only Buchanan that did. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint, is this really happening?",
        "Clint: I'm afraid it is. Viki, why don't you come sit down?",
        "Viki: Where's Kevin?",
        "Clint: He's in the back. He's having a hard time facing this.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, who can blame him? I feel the same way. All I want to do is just fall apart.",
        "Clint: People would understand.",
        "Viki: No, I can't do that, not today. Kevin needs me to be really strong for him, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: We'll both do that. No matter the cost, we'll be there for our son together.",
        "Bo: It's the toughest walk that you'll ever make, Kev. But you can do it.",
        "Kevin: I thought the next time I walked down this aisle, it would be on my wedding day with Kelly. And Duke would be up there beside me right where his picture is now. He should be alive, Bo. He should be here.",
        "Bo: He is, Kev. He's here.",
        "Kevin: Uh-huh, you're right about that -- I can feel his hatred.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I really don't need what you're selling. My lawyer is out there right now trying to get me a stay of execution.",
        "Andrew: Well, that's -- that's good. It's good.",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah. I can see you're thrilled.",
        "Andrew: Todd -- Todd, I don't believe in the death penalty. I don't care who the person is, I don't care how horrific their crime. I truly hope that your lawyer finds a way to -- to keep that awful machine from kicking into gear, but you got to face the truth that if she isn't able to do that, you're facing the end of your life tomorrow.",

        "David: I don't know where Margaret went, but she was here, I swear it on my life.",
        "John: Yeah, well, that's not worth much. All right. We're going back to the hotel, we'll book a flight to Llanview. Let's go.",
        "David: What about Denton?",
        "John: I'll call the local authorities from the hotel.",
        "David: Wait, wait. Maybe we should wait until we skip town, just in case murder's illegal in Thailand?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Listen, I know you feel guilty about Duke, but he's known Kelly practically all his life. It's not like she was some girl he hooked up with in a bar. There had to be feelings there already.",
        "Adriana: But if I had just talked to him, been there for him, instead of pretending like our entire relationship never existed, I don't know -- maybe I could've found a way to keep him from going to the rectory that night.",
        "Layla: No. I talked to Duke at the wedding. Head feelings for Kelly -- at least, that's what he thought. Something tells me nothing could've kept him away from her that night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Dorian, please. You still have some influence around here. You've got to get me out of here.",

        "Dorian: No! All right? And there's just no way you're leaving this hospital. I'm your aunt. What am I talking about? I'm a medical doctor, for heaven's sake. You can't go gallivanting around when you've had your chest cut open a few days ago, besides which I -- I'm not going to let you face the onslaught of that vermin that calls themselves the press. No, no, no. I will go to the funeral. I will represent you. You stay here and you concentrate on getting better. I love you.",

        "Bo: No. He's just in too bad of shape, Kev. Renee is with him just to make sure he doesn't turn to the wrong channel or pick up a newspaper or something. She wanted to be here.",
        "Clint: Listen, are we waiting for Lee Ann, or what?",
        "Kevin: No. She's not coming.",
        "Clint: Not coming to her own son's funeral?",
        "Kevin: She said she might kill me if she looks at me right now. Can you blame her, huh? She put her son on a plane two years ago to Llanview to get to know his father, and because of me, he's dead.",

        "Starr: Not really.",
        "Matthew: Why would you come to a funeral for someone you barely knew?",
        "Starr: I figured I'd get an idea of how it all works since I'll probably be at my dad's funeral in a few days.",

        "Michael: I was able to snag an hour off from the hospital, but I got to run back there as soon as this thing's over. It's still a madhouse from the tornado.",
        "Spencer: I guess you were given a crash course in what it's like to be married to a doctor, right? You two should be on your honeymoon right now.",
        "Marcie: Oh, it's ok. Besides, I think we'd feel too guilty to enjoy it anyway.",
        "Spencer: I understand. Unfortunately, I do know the drill. You're a very understanding woman.",
        "Marcie: Well, it's just a few days and I have nothing but a lifetime of honeymoons to look forward to with this big guy, right?",
        "Michael: How are you? Now, I want you to remember that if it wasn't for you, we'd be attending a double funeral.",

        "Dorian: Nothing. It's just I know that I'm supposed to be feeling sympathy for Duke, his family, but when I look around at all of this, I can't help myself. I'm just so grateful that it was Duke who died and not Kelly. Viki, I'm deeply sorry for your loss.",
        "Viki: Oh, I sincerely doubt that. Dorian, I would ask you to leave right this second except it would cause a scene and the reporters would just love that. So instead, I'm going to tell you to sit down and keep your mouth shut. And when this service is over, go home. You are not invited back to the house. And frankly, I don't want to see your face again for a very long time if ever.",

        "Viki: Duke was my very, very sweet grandson. When he was growing up in Texas, we never really had a chance to spend much time together. And then when he moved here to Llanview, I was frightened for him. Duke was a kind, gentle, and brilliant young man who grew up with open skies and endless horizons, and I was so afraid that the responsibilities of the world and the pain and the frustrations of adulthood would destroy the light in his eyes. But it never did. I'm proud to say that right up until the day he died, that light never dimmed. He was a very, very special young man of whom we were very proud and we will miss him terribly. Until we meet again in heaven. Goodbye.",

        "Todd: God, have mercy on my soul and all that kind of crap. Yeah, I've done a lot of bad things to a lot of people, people who didn't deserve them, and I've paid for those sins. I'm not paying for any sins now. I didn't do this. And I don't care -- I don't care if you don't believe me. You and the entire state of Pennsylvania -- I don't care.",
        "Andrew: I'll tell you what I believe. I believe that you don't think you did anything wrong and if you're at peace with that, Todd, who am I to argue with you? But you got to face the truth. There are aspects of this tragedy that you've got to deal with right now before it's too late.",
        "Todd: Yeah, like how many \"our fathers\" I need to say before I get into heaven?",
        "Andrew: No, Todd. Like your children, like your last will and testament, like the trusts you have in jack and Starr's names. I don't -- I don't care. I don't care what you think of me, I don't care what you think of Blair or anybody else, for that matter. You got two kids, two kids who you love more than anything in the world and you are going to leave them nothing, nothing but pain, nothing but grief, nothing but unfinished business their father should've taken care of, but he was too selfish in his final days on earth.",

        "Clint: It's tradition that when a Buchanan boy is born, my pa buys him a cowboy hat. Not the kind for kids. Certainly not the cheap kind, but the real deal. My father can't be here today. And that's both a shame and a blessing. Duke was the next great generation of Buchanans. A Buchanan man bears not only our name but our legacy. Our family has been blessed with great wealth. But we have never believed that our strength came from money. Buchanan power is not oil, stocks. Got nothing to do with what's written in our ledger. It is love and unity. And we draw strength from each other. And we have never been stronger than we are today. Because Duke Buchanan unites us in death, as he did in life. Duke was a bright and shining Buchanan. Now he is a bright and shining star in the heavens. He was a wonderful man. He'll be with us always. Always.",
