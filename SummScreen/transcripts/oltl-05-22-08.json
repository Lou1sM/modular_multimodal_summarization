        "Todd: Blair?",
        "Starr: It's Dad, Mom. How did he get out of jail so fast?",
        "Blair: Well, John said that it wouldn't take him long to make bail.",
        "Starr: Well, then what are we going to do?",
        "Todd: Blair? Open the door!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?",
        "Jared: Yeah. You have to tell Viki the truth about me and you. And you have to do it today.",
        "Charlie: Why? Did something happen?",
        "Jared: Yeah. And if you don't come clean with Viki, she's going to find out through somebody else.",
        "Charlie: I see. And so what's going to happen to you?",
        "Jared: I have to tell the Buchanans I'm an imposter and that the real Buchanan heir is still out there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Natalie, what on earth are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: She lied under oath, didn't she? Didn't she? She faked the breakdown on the witness stand just to get away with murder, but she's not going to get away with it now because -- because you've got proof that she did this. Please, God, tell me. Tell me that's why you're here. Is that what you were going to tell me, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Thank you for making my life better in every way possible.",
        "Bo: You know, you seemed a little different this morning. Did R.J. say something to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Metal detector beeps]",
        "Antonio: It appears the metal detector is working. Good morning, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Hi.",
        "Antonio: Good to see you, Bo.",
        "Bo: Right back at you, Antonio.",
        "Eddie: Commissioner Ramsey said you were arranging this exhibit.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, I did -- I did that when I was still the police commissioner and I guaranteed the Mendorran authorities that we would have a police presence when the jewels were transferred into the gallery.",
        "Talia: So, let us know the lay of the land.",
        "Lindsay: Well, my security company has outfitted all of these cases here with wireless transmitters so --",
        "Antonio: It's our job to make sure that they get here.",
        "Eddie: Well, Commissioner Ramsey runs a pretty tight ship, so no one's going to be making off with those jewels on our shift.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Starr: Mom, we're making him even madder.",
        "Blair: Sweetie, I don't think we can make him any madder than he is right now.",
        "Starr: Mom, if he finds out that I'm pregnant --",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, he's not going to find out.",
        "Starr: We can't hide it from him forever, Mom.",
        "Blair: Listen -- you listen to me. The two of us can do anything if we put our mind to it, Okay? It's going to be all right.",
        "[Knocking stops]",
        "Starr: Do you think he went away?",
        "Todd: Llanview, Pennsylvania. A locksmith. I don't care which one, just get me one. Never mind. Hey. Bust down this door.",
        "Shaun: It's not your door to break down.",
        "Todd: Bust down the door or you're fired.",
        "Shaun: It's not your place to fire me, because I quit. I work for Miss Cramer now.",
        "Todd: Pardon?",
        "Shaun: Hey, she paid me double and I didn't even have to ask.",
        "Todd: All right, I'll pay you triple.",
        "Shaun: Thanks, but no, thanks. My new boss is a lot easier to work for and a lot easier on the eyes, too.",
        "Todd: Blair!",
        "Shaun: You got a bum shoulder, right? I don't have to worry that you could actually bust yourself in.",
        "Todd: Blair, call off your goon.",
        "Shaun: Miss Cramer, it's Shaun. Do you want me to call the police?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Well, I guess I knew this day would come eventually.",
        "Jared: Okay, whoa, Charlie -- this doesn't mean that it's all over, Okay? Natalie forgave me and -- and we are together now, so --",
        "Charlie: That's great, Jared. And you were able to finally tell her the whole story?",
        "Jared: She knows everything I know. But, see, I can't ask her to keep the secret from Rex and her dad and her mom. It's not right -- and it's not right for me to make you do the same.",
        "Charlie: Well, I mean, but she's the one who made you decide to come clean, huh?",
        "Jared: I wanted to tell everyone right away, yeah, but she was worried about her mom, because she knows how much Viki cares about you, and she didn't want to mess that up, and neither did I.",
        "Charlie: So what changed your mind?",
        "Jared: Someone's blackmailing us, Dad. And now we don't have a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, I was just about to muck out Old Whiskey's stall. You know, she must be on a real high-fiber diet.",
        "Clint: You know, I pay people to do that for us.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "[Natalie chuckles]",
        "Clint: I've never known you to be interested in riding the horses much less shoving manure.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I -- I guess -- I guess I was converted back in Texas. You know, Chuck took me riding, but he also taught me how to take care of the horses.",
        "Clint: Is that right?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, I've grown up with horses, but I'm a Buchanan. It's in my D.N.A., right? Hmm.",
        "Clint: Listen, I came out here to go for a morning ride. You want to come with me? I can saddle up Whiskey if you --",
        "Natalie: No -- no. No.",
        "Clint: Why not?",
        "Natalie: Well, see, I was just about to groom Old Whiskey and you don't want to take her out the way she's looking right now.",
        "Clint: You know something, Natalie? Asa would've bought you a pony when you were a kid if only he'd known about you.",
        "Natalie: I know, but I -- I did okay without a pony.",
        "Clint: You sure did.",
        "Natalie: I mean, I wasn't trying to make you feel bad about the things that I was missing in my life, because I love my life. I love -- I love my family.",
        "Clint: I love you, too. And I'm proud of you. And I hated to see the disappointment in your eye when I was dealing with that takeover activity.",
        "Natalie: I understand why you do what you did.",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Natalie: Sometimes when you try to do what's best for your family, you have to do things that hurt.",
        "Clint: Spoken like a true Buchanan.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "Clint: Let me tell you a secret. This family is not easy to understand.",
        "Natalie: True.",
        "Clint: And Jared, he got a baptism by fire, didn't he? Hostile takeover, hostile us.",
        "[Natalie chuckles]",
        "Clint: You know, it's amazing how well things turned out, isn't it?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: The armored truck with the jewelry should be here in about a half- hour, and, Bo, their ambassador to the U.S. is in the limo following the truck.",
        "Bo: Oh, good. I'll speak to him when he gets here.",
        "Talia: So wait, who actually is transporting the jewels? Is it the armored guards or are we doing that?",
        "Antonio: We take over as soon as the truck arrives.",
        "Bo: See, the jewels will be most vulnerable during the few minutes it takes to transfer them from the truck to these glass cases. Now, once they're securely locked up in the glass cases, then the security company will take over. I just -- I didn't want them making the transfer.",
        "Eddie: So this exhibit is going to be open to the public?",
        "Lindsay: No. It is invitation only.",
        "Antonio: I'm going to take a look around, make sure everything's secure.",
        "Eddie: Sahid, could you check the guest list against the data bank, see if any of those names are persons of interest?",
        "Talia: Sure.",
        "Lindsay: I'd feel a lot less nervous if you were still police commissioner.",
        "Bo: Well, you know, it was the mayor's choice. He decided to replace me with Ramsey.",
        "Lindsay: Would you want to go back if you could?",
        "Bo: Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure anybody even misses me.",
        "Lindsay: Everybody misses you.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Antonio: Is this a good time to show you how the metal detector works?",
        "Lindsay: Sure.",
        "Talia: I thought the security company was in charge once the jewels were in the case.",
        "Antonio: I think it's important that we all know how the basic equipment works. Your belt and holster, please.",
        "Talia: Really?",
        "Antonio: Just do it. And your shoes, too.",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Talia: Sir.",
        "[Metal detector beeps]",
        "[Metal detector beeps]",
        "Talia: Oh. Look, maybe we just should've had Eddie be the guinea pig.",
        "Eddie: Oh, you've got a metallic bra on?",
        "Lindsay: That thing is pretty sensitive. Are you wearing a necklace under that shirt?",
        "Talia: Right.",
        "Talia: Hey.",
        "Antonio: Put your shoes back on.",
        "Eddie: So I guess the new job is a lot more glam than the L.P.D., huh?",
        "Bo: Well, if you enjoy the corporate life.",
        "Antonio: Here you go.",
        "Talia: Oh. Thank you.",
        "Antonio: I want to show you how the case is wired.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Antonio: Ah, damn it. In a minute, all right? Be right back. Find the damn phone. Vega.",
        "Ramsey: The armored truck is about 20 miles away.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I know.",
        "Ramsey: Now you've got about a five-minute window for those jewels to walk and Sahid to go down. Is everything in place?",
        "Antonio: It is now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You stand back. Shaun?",
        "Shaun: Yes, ma'am?",
        "Blair: There's no need to call the police, all right, because Mr. Manning is leaving.",
        "Todd: You know there's only one real way you can get rid of me. Just let me say what I have to say, face to face, and then I'll leave. I promise.",
        "Blair: Starr, you say the word.",
        "Starr: It's Okay.",
        "Blair: Todd? I'm going to let you in, but you have to swear that you will not threaten, you will not raise your voice, you will not raise a hand, you will do nothing to your daughter. You got that? And when you're finished saying your peace, you will leave.",
        "Todd: Okay, I swear. On the lives on my children, I swear.",
        "Blair: Start talking, Todd.",
        "Todd: What, here, in front of --",
        "Blair: Yeah, he's here to keep you from hurting anyone.",
        "Todd: [Scoffs] You really that afraid of me?",
        "Blair: No, I'm not afraid of you, Todd. I just know that you would do anything to get what you want.",
        "Todd: Is that what you think?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Don't you know how much I love you? I was just trying to protect you, honey. Just trying to keep you safe and sound.",
        "Blair: Starr, why don't you go upstairs and you go check on Sam, Okay? See if he's up from his nap.",
        "Starr: Okay. Goodbye.",
        "Blair: All right, Todd, you're on the clock. Start talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So, what do you got for me?",
        "R.J.: Well, I didn't come to talk about Lindsay breaking down on the stand.",
        "Nora: R.J. --",
        "R.J.: Well, you were having such a good little run there, I didn't want to interrupt.",
        "Nora: Well, then -- okay, then, what is it that you wanted to tell me?",
        "R.J.: Blackmail.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "R.J.: You remember when Clint went all Asa on you a while back and pulled on his Pa's boots to fight off B.E.'s enemies?",
        "Nora: Yeah?",
        "R.J.: Where do you think he got the dirt?",
        "Nora: Lindsay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Antonio, would you tell the ambassador that I'll be back to speak to him later?",
        "Antonio: Got it.",
        "Lindsay: And you can expect the people from my team to be here in about an hour.",
        "Antonio: Okay.",
        "Lindsay: Okay?",
        "Bo: All right. It's good working with you again. Let me know if you need anything, Okay?",
        "[Lindsay chuckles]",
        "Bo: And by the time that we get back here, the jewels in that case will be the second most beautiful thing --",
        "[Lindsay laughs]",
        "Bo: In this gallery.",
        "Eddie: What a waste of time.",
        "Antonio: You think?",
        "Eddie: Yeah. I can understand why Ramsey would give Sahid a case like this. But I'm not really into glorified security detail, you know? Kissing some muckety-muck's ass?",
        "Antonio: Really? And you're so good at it.",
        "Eddie: Hey.",
        "Antonio: That jewelry's worth several million dollars. The insurance alone is worth more than you make in a couple of years.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Antonio: Detective Vega. Yeah. You got it. Truck's pulling in.",
        "Talia: Yeah?",
        "Antonio: Sahid, you come down with me, get the jewelry. You, stay here and wait for us.",
        "Eddie: Whoa, whoa, Ramsey gave us an order this was a three-man job. I don't want to wait around here while y'all two are doing the important stuff.",
        "Antonio: Fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Changing the locks. Putting me on a meter. This is crazy.",
        "Blair: What's crazy is how you've been acting the last few months. I married you and I stayed married to you even after we brought your son home because I thought the one thing that we could trust -- or I could trust is that you wouldn't hurt your family.",
        "Todd: What happened to Starr was an accident.",
        "Blair: \"What happened to Starr\"? You say that as if you had nothing to do with it, Todd. I warned you. I warned you so many times if you held her too tight that you were going to push her away. Now she's afraid of you.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: She ran away from you, Todd. I watched you throw her down a flight of stairs, then she saw you punch Cole again. And I know you hit Markko. They're kids. But you didn't let that youth stop you. No, because you were -- you're so full of rage, you could've killed three people on the boardwalk.",
        "Todd: Three people? Who is the third?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Well, look at this -- I don't have time for my morning ride anymore. I will get a hold of Peter and have him come over and help you if you insist on cleaning out the stall.",
        "Natalie: No, you know what? I insist on doing this myself, because you know what, how else am I going to learn if everyone else does the dirty work for me.",
        "[Natalie chuckles]",
        "Clint: Okay. I know better than to argue with you, so I'll see you at the office, okay?",
        "Natalie: Okay. I promise to shower first.",
        "Clint: Yeah, that would make a lot of people happy. I'll see you later.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Okay, Whiskey. Okay, I will take this gag out of your mouth, but if you even think about screaming, I will muck you up.",
        "David: [Muffled] Okay.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "[David groans]",
        "David: That's the second -- ah! You know what trait I find most attractive in a woman? The ability to lie effortlessly, which makes you smoking-hot.",
        "Natalie: David, I am nothing like you. I do not enjoy deceiving those I care about, although you -- well, you only care about yourself.",
        "David: Why does half this town forget that I gave half my liver to your half- sister? You know, what is your lovely mother going to think when she finds out that you've got me hogtied in a stall with Old Whiskey here?",
        "Natalie: She'll feel sorry for the horse.",
        "David: Viki's going to be awfully disappointed in you when she finds out what you were willing to do for lust.",
        "Natalie: I am doing this for her, you moron.",
        "David: For her? How?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay, I want to know who is blackmailing you.",
        "Jared: No, Okay? Look, I've already gotten you in deep enough. The less you know, the better.",
        "Charlie: No, I don't agree.",
        "Jared: You don't even know this person, Okay? Just trust me when I tell you that the only way to make this go away is for you to come clean, which is what you have wanted me to do all along.",
        "Charlie: This is not going to be easy for you, you know?",
        "Jared: Look, the Buchanans -- they can do whatever they want to me, Okay? I can handle that. What -- what worries me is -- is Renee finding out that I played her for a fool. She's -- she's never going to believe that I really came to love her.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and I guess I'm going to have to own up to Rex, too.",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: He was so happy to have you as a father. I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Charlie: Hey, no, it wasn't your idea that I lie to the kid.",
        "Jared: You think Viki can understand?",
        "Charlie: [Exhales] You know, Viki thinks that I told her my deepest and darkest secrets within the first few minutes of meeting her. That's what won her trust from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: I'll be out in the field. If anything goes wrong, call John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: So the jewels are going to be kept in this very state-of-the-art theft- proof case.",
        "Man: Ah, yes, yes, it is what the Mendorran government specified.",
        "Antonio: Perfect. Hold these?",
        "Eddie: Yes, Sir.",
        "Antonio: Sahid?",
        "Talia: Yeah?",
        "Antonio: Stand close to the case. I need to check the range of the sensors. Good.",
        "[Metal detector beeps]",
        "Thief: Get your hands up!",
        "Second thief: Good afternoon.",
        "Man: This cannot be happening.",
        "Thief: Give me the jewels.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: Webster and the other guy, Cobb, were both clients of Sam's, and apparently Sam knew everything there was to know about the people he represented.",
        "Nora: Yeah, he did. So Lindsay's been hanging on to these files and helping herself to them, obviously. That's against the law.",
        "R.J.: Yes, it is.",
        "Nora: And she just admitted this to you?",
        "R.J.: Well, we've had a few late-night conversations over a few glasses of wine and Lindsay's told me all kinds of things.",
        "Nora: Why didn't she just give them to Bo? Why would she give them to Clint?",
        "R.J.: I don't know. Maybe she wanted to help Bo's company, but she knew Bo wouldn't take that kind of help.",
        "Nora: All right, and why are you telling me this now?",
        "R.J.: I thought you should know.",
        "Nora: That's it?",
        "R.J.: Hmm. That's all.",
        "Nora: R.J.? Thank you.",
        "R.J.: Sure. I wish I could say it was a pleasure.",
        "Clint: R.J. What are you doing here?",
        "R.J.: I...was just leaving.",
        "[R.J. chuckles]",
        "Clint: What's going on?",
        "Nora: I don't know. Maybe you should tell me. Where did you get all the garbage that you used to hang on to B.E.? Eh, never mind. You don't have to tell me. I already know. Lindsay.",
        "Clint: What difference does it make who I got it from?",
        "Nora: You know how I feel about the way you handled it and you know how I feel about Lindsay.",
        "Clint: And that's exactly why I didn't tell you.",
        "Nora: Well, she obviously did this to get back at me.",
        "Clint: Are you crazy?",
        "Nora: Are you? We're talking about Lindsay Rappaport.",
        "Lindsay: What about her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: \"And they lived happily ever after.\" It's a bunch of bull, right? Yeah. See, I used to believe all that stuff when Mom and Dad used to read these stories to me. And then when Mom and Dad got married for the last time, when they brought you home, I thought that we were going to get our own fractured fairy-tale ending. Look, Sam, I know it's kind of my fault that you're going to grow up without your dad, but I think it's the best thing for you. He's going to make you love him, but then he's just going to break your heart. And, I mean, he's always going around doing anything that he wants to do, you know, hurting anybody, but yet I still have to be perfect little Starr. Once he finds out that I have a bun in the oven, I don't know what he's going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Yeah, you almost killed three people on the boardwalk. Cole, Starr, and me, if I'd lost my little girl. You threw her down those stairs. She was lying there not moving, but what'd you do? You didn't go to her to help her. No, you turned on Cole. You wanted him dead.",
        "Todd: If I wanted Cole dead, he'd be dead.",
        "Blair: All in the name of love, right, Todd?",
        "Todd: I didn't want to hurt Starr, Blair. My God, I was trying to prevent her from getting hurt.",
        "Blair: Okay. Now that you know how it all ended, what would you do differently? Would you do anything?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'd do things differently.",
        "Blair: Really? You'd still lock her up here? Threaten her? Keep her away from Cole? Because you are Todd.",
        "Todd: And you fell in love with Todd, didn't you?",
        "Blair: Not anymore.",
        "Todd: Yeah. How many times have you said that?",
        "Blair: There's no forgiving what you did this time, Todd.",
        "Todd: Doesn't matter, though. Then you'll wake up, you'll miss me. You want me to come home.",
        "Blair: This is not your home, not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Charlie, I promise you I will take full responsibility for everything, because you never would've lied if it wasn't for me. And if Viki can forgive Natalie, then she's going to have to forgive you eventually, right?",
        "Charlie: Hey... Natalie is her daughter. And believe me, we have an amazing capacity for forgiveness when it comes to our children. We hold others to higher standards. I made my choice and that's that.",
        "Jared: And I chose pretending to be a Buchanan over accepting who I was.",
        "Charlie: And you're a better n because of it. Let's just hope the Buchanans can see that.",
        "Jared: It's not the Buchanans I'm worried about right now. It's you.",
        "Charlie: Oh, no -- look, I am not going to hit the bottle over this.",
        "Jared: Okay, I --",
        "Charlie: I would never do that to you. Not again. Hey, I'm very proud of you, what you're doing here, son.",
        "Jared: It's not like I have much choice.",
        "Charlie: Thank you for coming to me first.",
        "Jared: Natalie and I agreed that I owed you that much.",
        "Charlie: Look, I think it's great that you and Natalie are working things out because of all the things I ever wanted once I got sober, your happiness was at the top of the list.",
        "Jared: Well, Natalie forgave me. And she's her mother's daughter",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Oh, I get it, I see what's going on here. If Viki finds out the truth about Jared, then she'll know that he's been sticking it to the Buchanans and she ain't going to like him much, is she? Then she'll find out that you've been doing the nasty with him, and she ain't going to like you too much, either.",
        "Natalie: Okay, we wouldn't have to be doing any of this if you weren't blackmailing us.",
        "David: Yeah, you definitely don't want to see that disappointed look on Viki's face when she knows you've been lying to her. Believe me, I've seen it one time too many. However, there is an alternative here, Natalie. Maybe Jared can't get his hands on that kind of money, but you're a real Buchanan. You can get in there and do it. You don't have to tell Viki, I don't have to tell Viki. All you have to do is write a check and let me go, now.",

        "Nora: What are you two doing here?",
        "Bo: We came by to talk about how to publicize the exhibition at Lindsay's gallery.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah, guys, I'm sorry, I'm forgot.",
        "Lindsay: Did we come at a bad time, because we can leave so you can talk about me.",
        "Nora: No, you stay. I think you'd be interested to hear this, Bo.",
        "Clint: Nora?",
        "Nora: Why?",
        "Clint: Please don't do this.",
        "Nora: You don't think he deserves to know?",
        "Bo: Deserves to know about what?",
        "Nora: He felt the same way about the way you handled the threats at B.E. as I did. It was shady. It was seedy.",
        "Clint: And it worked. It worked and that's all anybody cares about now.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but what does it have to do with Lindsay?",
        "Nora: Where do you think Clint got the ammo that he used on B.E.'s enemies?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thief: Hand them over.",
        "Antonio: All right, there's three of us, there's two of you. Why don't you guys just think about it?",
        "Thief: Three nine-millimeters in your holsters, two in your face.",
        "Talia: Freeze! Freeze! I will -- put them down! I will shoot you.",
        "[Gun clicks]",
        "[Thieves chuckle]",
        "Talia: Antonio, my gun's not working.",
        "Man: What are you doing? Go after them.",
        "Antonio: Stay here with Eddie.",
        "Man: This is an outrage. How could you possibly let this happen and just stand there?",
        "Eddie: What happened?",
        "Talia: I -- I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're my wife. They're my kids. You can't kick me out of my own home.",
        "Blair: I'm not going to be your wife for long, and your kids don't want anything to do with you, and I do believe this is Dorian's house. And guess what -- you're not welcome, so leave.",
        "[Todd scoffs]",
        "Todd: You need me to protect you.",
        "Blair: The only person we need protection from is you.",
        "Todd: What about Ramsey?",
        "Blair: He used us to get to you. You are his problem. That's because you were stupid enough to hook up with him, cross him, and now he hates you, so with you out of the picture, Todd, see, you know what -- all of our problems suddenly just disappear.",
        "Todd: No, Blair.",
        "Blair: So why don't you just take all that money that you were using to hire bodyguards and P.I.s and treat your daughter like a prisoner -- no, more -- more like a piece of property -- and buy your own little piece of property and live in it.",
        "Todd: You're my wife.",
        "Blair: In name only. I let you move into this house to save your child, so I thought. Now I'm ordering you to move out to save mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So I give you a check and then I let you go. Then what, David? You just going to forget about your blackmailing demands and leave us alone? Come on, how stupid do you think I am?",
        "David: Stupid enough to make out with a guy who says he's your uncle in a diner where I was washing dishes.",
        "Natalie: Yes, well, you know what? Jared is fixing that right now. He's going to make sure that you have no more power over us. So you're going to stay right here until he's done it.",
        "David: It's ridiculous. You can't just keep me here.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Put a sock in it.",
        "David: No, no --",
        "Natalie: In fact, better yet, I'll --",
        "Jared: Ugh.",
        "Natalie: How'd it go?",
        "Jared: Charlie's going to tell your mom.",
        "David: Great. Then what do you need me for?",
        "Jared: Easy, cowboy. We need you right where you are.",
        "Natalie: Well, not right here, exactly. My dad was just here a few minutes ago.",
        "Jared: I thought I talked him out of his morning ride.",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm, no, but I finally did, and it took some doing. The stable boy is going to be here in a little while. It's just too dangerous to keep him here.",
        "Jared: Okay, well, where do we take it?",
        "Natalie: Whew. I've got an idea.",
        "David: No, I've got an idea. If you're going to coop me up with another filly, could you at least make her human and moderately attractive? [Muffled] Ah, come on. Oh.",
        "Natalie: I have got one nerve left and he's really working it.",
        "Jared: Okay, well, this is all going to be over soon. Once Charlie tells your mom, I'll talk to your dad and, well, David can't get any Buchanan money out of me if I'm not a Buchanan anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Bo, she did us a huge favor. You owe her a debt of gratitude. We all do.",
        "Nora: Nothing to be ashamed of, then why all the secrecy?",
        "Clint: I run a business, not a kindergarten. Every company has secrets. That's the way it works in the marketplace. I am not ashamed of anything that I have done and, Lindsay, you shouldn't be, either. I'm not going to stand here and be scolded for saving Buchanan enterprises. If the day ever comes when you don't want me to save it, send me a memo, all right? This company meant everything to Asa. You know that, Bo, and it means everything to the future of our family. And with that in mind, I've got work to do.",
        "Nora: Excuse me.",
        "Bo: Is it true?",
        "Lindsay: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Why didn't you come to me with the information?",
        "Lindsay: Bo, because I knew you wouldn't use it. But I didn't want you to lose the company. Please tell me that you believe me.",

        "Antonio: I called in a description of the car.",
        "Eddie: What, they got away?",
        "Antonio: They won't get far.",
        "Man: How will I ever explain this to my government?",
        "Eddie: Sahid, why didn't you take them out?",
        "Talia: I tried. I had a full clip in my gun. I -- I know I did. I would never go out on an assignment with an unloaded piece, ever.",
        "Eddie: But you did.",
        "Talia: Why are we still standing here?",
        "Antonio: Because we blew it! They're gone. And so are several million dollars worth of jewelry. On our -- on my watch.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Ramsey: Yeah?",
        "Antonio: There's been a situation at the gallery. I regret to inform you that the jewelry we were charged to watch has been stolen.",
        "Ramsey: Oh. Quel dommage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: I can't apologize enough for this unfortunate incident, but I can assure you, Mr. Caldwell, that our government will do everything possible to make sure those jewels are returned to you. Mr. Caldwell: Yes. Make sure you do.",
        "Ramsey: Sahid. Detective Vega here has told me what transpired at the gallery. I want you to turn over your weapon, your badge, clean out your locker. You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Please tell me that you understand why I did it.",
        "Bo: I'm a little blown away right now. Need some time to think.",
        "Lindsay: Okay.",
        "[Bo twists off bottle top]",
        "Lindsay: I'll see you back at the gallery?",
        "[Bo pours]",
        "Lindsay: You just couldn't help yourself, could you?",
        "Nora: Sounds to me like you couldn't help yourself.",
        "Lindsay: If you are so into Clint and so over Bo that what compelled you to open your big fat mouth --",
        "Nora: Bo is the father of my son and he needs to know what kind of a bitch he's exposing my son to!",
        "Lindsay: If things don't work out between us, because I helped to save this family business, not to mention this house that you're living in, by the way, you're going to be the one to pay.",
        "Nora: Boo-hoo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Kind of seemed like David was really at home with all those whips and spurs. I felt like we could leave him in that tack room forever.",
        "Jared: Well, it won't have to be forever. Just long enough for me to figure out how I'm going to say what I have to say to everyone.",
        "Natalie: You know I'll do whatever I can to back you up.",
        "Jared: I know you will. And I appreciate that more than I can say.",
        "Natalie: And just think -- once everyone knows the truth, we can be out and proud. No more stealing moments in diners.",
        "Jared: Or cars.",
        "Natalie: Or office stairwells.",
        "Jared: Or haystacks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Hey, Viki, it's Charlie. Look, I need to talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: The good news is, is that dad adores babies. But the bad news is, is that he still thinks that I am one. Still wish I believed in happily-ever- after.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You swore on the lives of your children that you would leave once you were finished. Well, I do believe you have run out of time.",
        "Todd: Maybe I'm not finished.",
        "Blair: Shaun.",
        "Shaun: Come with me.",

        "Charlie: My son.",
        "Adriana: I have a proposal for you, Gigi, that I think will solve all your problems.",
