        "Blair: Hey, John.",
        "John: Come on in.",
        "Blair: Look, I just got off the phone with the Chicago Police Department and it's like they don't give a damn whether Todd is missing or not.",
        "John: Yeah -- no news here, either, but I did invite Miles Laurence down to listen to that recording.",
        "Blair: Good. Bo seemed to think it was no big deal, that it's just a baby crying. Do you think he knows more than he's saying?",
        "John: Yeah, I do. I can't prove anything, but I don't trust that guy.",
        "Blair: I don't, either.",
        "Officer: Lieutenant?",
        "John: Yeah? Thank you.",
        "Miles: I'm here. What's this all about?",
        "John: I got something I want you to hear.",
        "Miles: Look, this isn't a good time for me. I have someplace to be.",
        "Blair: Uh, nothing is more important than helping us find Todd.",
        "John: Where do you have to be, anyway?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Engine cranks]",
        "Marty: Oh. Oh, I just filled the tank.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "[Car approaches]",
        "Man: Need help, lady?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh. Thank you so much, Nigel.",
        "Nigel: Anything else I can get for you?",
        "Viki: No, thank you. If you don't mind, I'm just going to wait for Clint, ok?",
        "Nigel: He may be very late.",
        "Viki: That means he's with Dorian.",
        "Nigel: I'm afraid he is.",
        "Viki: Which means he may not be back until the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: There are candles lit, and I put sea salt in your bath.",
        "Clint: Dorian, I'm sorry. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: It's over, finally. Now we can be together.",
        "Jessica: Telling Antonio \"I love you\" was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.",
        "Nash: I know, but you did it. And now, he knows and now you can breathe.",
        "Jessica: I destroyed him. We took his friendship and his trust, his love, and we just betrayed it. Now he hates us. I don't blame him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What do you mean, you and Jess are through?",
        "Antonio: In a nutshell, I've been lied to, cheated on, and made a damn fool of. Our marriage is over. She's in love with Nash.",
        "Cristian: How did you find out?",
        "Antonio: She just came out and said it. Remember that day when she ran out on Jamie's adoption hearing and I was worried sick about her?",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: She was with Nash, having sex at the quarry.",
        "Cristian: She told you that?",
        "Antonio: Claimed it was the first time they did it, but admitted having feelings for him all the while. You don't look surprised.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: The look on Antonio's face -- I can't get it out of my mind.",
        "Nash: Jessica, I know how difficult that must've been for you. And Antonio, too -- I mean, he lost his wife. But eventually, he'll understand. We had a history because of Tess and our daughter brought us together, too. I mean, how could he not understand that?",
        "Jessica: I married him.",
        "Nash: Well, you were confused.",
        "Jessica: That's not good enough. That's not good enough. I shouldn't have gone through with it.",
        "Nash: You cared about him.",
        "Jessica: I told him that I loved him, but just not the way that I loved you.",
        "Nash: That must've killed him. I know because that's what you told me for months.",
        "Jessica: I know, I know. But I was lying -- I was lying to you and I was lying to myself.",
        "Nash: You don't have to lie anymore.",
        "Jessica: It had to end. It wasn't fair to Antonio, he had to be told.",
        "Nash: Yeah. You were very brave. You did the right thing.",
        "Jessica: Was it horrible when he confronted you?",
        "Antonio: No!",
        "Nash: No, not horrible. I'm dealing with it, I'll be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You know Nash and Jessica were running around behind my back?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I knew.",
        "Antonio: How long?",
        "Cristian: Since right before the fire got started at Capricorn.",
        "Antonio: How did you find out?",
        "Cristian: I overheard Nash telling Layla that he kissed Jess and that -- that Jess kissed him back.",
        "Antonio: And you couldn't tell me? You knew my wife was cheating on me and you didn't think I deserved to know?",
        "Cristian: I was going to tell you, Antonio. I swear I was going to tell you, but I -- look, I went to Jessica to confront her about it and she -- she got all upset. She started crying, telling me that -- that she knew what she did was wrong, but she hadn't kissed Nash. I mean, she kissed him -- she didn't sleep with him.",
        "Antonio: Right. And so when Evangeline kissed Todd, that was different somehow. You broke up with her because of that. And yet, Jessica kissing Nash -- that was different.",
        "Cristian: Evangeline and I weren't married, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: And that made it more of a crime? Think, stupid!",
        "Cristian: Evangeline hadn't been through what Jessica had this past year! Look, Jessica begged me not to tell you. She said that what happened with Nash happened because she was confused, because she was dealing with -- with integration, having Tess' feelings.",
        "Antonio: Tess' love for another man, and you thought that was ok?",
        "Cristian: She told me she loved you, man, and she swore to me that would never happen again.",
        "Antonio: And your heart went out to her -- \"poor Jessica, she's been through so much\"?",
        "Cristian: I did what I thought was right, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: So I went on making a damn fool out of myself \"thinking\" that my wife actually loved me.",
        "Cristian: I was trying to protect you.",
        "Antonio: How is that protecting me? It's worse now -- don't you get it? All this time, Nash and Jessica have been waiting to tell me, keeping this secret. I should've known before, damn it! I should've known!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I've already told you everything I know about Todd's disappearance.",
        "Blair: I don't believe you.",
        "Miles: Oh, well, should I make up? Would that satisfy you? I have no further information. The letter that Spencer gave to me, I gave to the commissioner. What else do you want me to do?",
        "John: Well, we're going to see.",
        "Miles: No, look, I -- I told you, I have an appointment and I don't have time for this.",
        "John: Yeah, and I asked you where you had to be, but, well, you don't seem real anxious to -- to tell me that. Miles' voice: Why don't we wait together? I'll buy you dinner.",
        "Marty: No, I can't. I -- I have to be somewhere tonight.",
        "Miles: Where?",
        "Marty: Cherryvale.",
        "Miles: Not that it's any of your concern, but I have a meeting with an investment group.",
        "John: You'll just have to be late.",
        "Miles: Well, how late? How long is this going to take?",
        "John: Well, that's up to you.",
        "Miles: What, like, more than five, 10 minutes?",
        "John: Miles, you seem a little nervous. You -- you worried about something?",
        "Miles: No, I just want to know why I've been summoned here.",
        "John: Well, it's like I said -- I have a recording I'd like you to listen to.",
        "Miles: What kind of recording?",
        "Blair: You know something, Miles. I swear, if something has happened to Todd and I find out you're behind it, you're going to be so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Uh -- no, I'm fine. I just ran out of gas. I'm going to call the auto club now.",
        "Man: Get out. Get out, lady, now!",
        "Second man: We don't have to hurt you. It's up to you.",
        "Third man: All you have to do is give us what we want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: If you really need to speak to Mr. Clint, I could ring him on his --",
        "Viki: No, no. Thank you very much -- no. It was nothing specific anyway. I was -- I was just hoping he might have had some thought as to how we might help Jessica.",
        "Nigel: I don't know exactly how to ask this, but have they found a liver for her yet?",
        "Viki: No. But we are hopeful. Asa doesn't know, does he?",
        "Nigel: Oh, we thought it better not to tell him yet considering his condition.",
        "Viki: Yeah. We can tell him when the transplant is scheduled.",
        "Nigel: I'm going to be tested in the morning -- well, the entire staff is.",
        "Viki: Nigel, that's so incredibly nice of you.",
        "Nigel: Oh, well, it's the least I can do. This family has been very generous to me. And miss Jessica -- so young and beautiful, inside and out.",
        "Viki: Yes, she is. Oh, my God, that child has been through so much, Nigel. And if it weren't for me, none of it would've happened.",
        "Nigel: Mrs. Davidson, no. Please. Anybody who knows you know you would lay down your life for your children.",
        "Viki: And if it comes to that, I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry.",
        "Clint: It's not you -- not you.",
        "Dorian: You don't need to explain. Your daughter's very sick and your family means everything to you",
        "Clint: And I feel just so damn helpless.",
        "Dorian: Jessica is going to get a donor, I'm sure of that.",
        "Clint: Is she -- when? Because we're running out of time. And it's not as if this disease is devastating enough.",
        "Dorian: Yes, it is a shame that she has to deal with anything more than just her recovery.",
        "Clint: No, this situation with Nash -- the last thing my little girl needs is more stress.",
        "Dorian: Maybe she just couldn't sustain the lie any longer.",
        "Clint: I'm looking for -- I'm looking for somebody to blame, but I don't know who.",
        "Dorian: You need to relax. And I think that just maybe I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, Antonio was reasonable with you?",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's a relief. Although, I don't know -- I wouldn't blame him if -- I mean, I hurt him really, really badly and if he had lashed out -- I don't know. He has a really, really bad temper.",
        "Nash: Are you sorry that you told him now?",
        "Jessica: No. It had to be done, he had to know where my heart is. He had to know that you're the man that I want to be with. You're the man I want to spend the rest of my life with, even if it's just a couple of days.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Listen, Antonio, Jessica swore to me that she wanted nothing to do with Nash, that you were her husband, you were the man that she loved, and the last thing that she wanted to do was hurt you.",
        "Antonio: No -- the last thing she wanted was for me to find out, and you fell for it. Damn it, Cristian, how can you do this to me?",
        "Cristian: Hey, would you just listen for a sec?",
        "Antonio: No, you listen to me! Nash and Jessica -- they're making a fool out of me for months, and you helped them. There's no way in hell you can justify that.",
        "Cristian: Well, even if I believed that she loved you?",
        "Antonio: She fed you a line of bull and you fell for it! How can you be so damn stupid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: A tape was found at the location of Manning's last known whereabouts, all right? This is a recording of that tape. All I want you to do is listen to it --",
        "[John plays disc]",
        "John: And just tell me if it means anything to you.",
        "[Baby cries]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Look, what do you want? My money, my car? Just take it.",
        "Man: Well, we can have any damn thing we want, can't we, boys?",
        "Second man: Ow!",
        "Marty: No!",
        "Man: She tried to blind me!",
        "Marty: No! No!",
        "Man: What the hell do you think you're doing anyway? You got no gas! How are you going to get away?",
        "Marty: Well, after I maced you, I was going to take your car!",
        "Man: Hey, if you were that smart, you wouldn't be sitting here with an empty gas tank. Wouldn't be in the mess you're in now, would you, sweet cakes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: I'm terribly sorry for what you're all going through, Mrs. Davidson. But as Mr. Buchanan would say, \"Jessica is a Buchanan, which means she's got grit\" -- not that I'm absolutely certain what grit is, but I assume it's helpful in fighting cancer.",
        "Viki: Yes, I think it probably is. And the Buchanans certainly have grit to spare.",
        "Nigel: And I do hope Mr. Buchanan won't be angry -- I'm sure he'd have wanted to be tested to see if he was a compatible donor for her.",
        "Viki: He couldn't be. Because of his heart condition, they wouldn't allow it. They wouldn't even test him. That's what they told me, too.",
        "Nigel: Mrs. Davidson, I know how you feel. But Miss Jessica wouldn't want to live if doing so required such a sacrifice.",
        "Viki: It's not her choice, is it?",
        "Nigel: But you can't be a donor if the doctors won't test you -- or did I misunderstand?",
        "Viki: Nigel, where there's a will, there's a way, and that goes double for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm not being too rough, am I?",
        "Clint: No, feels good. I can't tell you how frustrating it is not to be able to find a donor. I need to find a donor or an alternative treatment to buy Jessie a little more time.",
        "Dorian: You have got to stop talking, stop thinking. It's ok not to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders all of the time, atlas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I guess -- I guess I believed Jess because I wanted to.",
        "Antonio: What if you were the chump instead of me? What if I'd known about that kiss between Evangeline and Todd and kept quiet? How would you feel?",
        "Cristian: I'd be pissed.",
        "Antonio: \"Pissed\" doesn't even begin to describe how I feel.",
        "Cristian: I never meant to hurt you, Antonio. I'm your brother.",
        "Antonio: No. You're not my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I'm going to be here with you from now on. Now that Antonio knows the truth, it will be so much easier on you, ok?",
        "Jessica: Things aren't going to get easier, Nash. I'm dying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Baby cries] [C.D. Stops]",
        "John: Well?",
        "Miles: I just heard a baby crying. Do you think that was used to lure Todd somewhere?",
        "Blair: How would you know that if you didn't tell somebody to do it, Miles?",
        "Miles: Because Todd was in Chicago looking for his baby, and John just told me he found that tape at his last known whereabouts. It's a logical assumption. May I go now?",
        "John: You are really in a hurry to get to this meeting, aren't you?",
        "Miles: Yeah, I am -- not that it's any of your damn business.",
        "John: Well, you better get going, you're going to be late. Thanks for coming in.",
        "Blair: I was watching him as he was listening, and his face was just stone cold.",
        "John: Usually when people don't react, it means they're working at it.",
        "Blair: You think he knows more than he's telling?",
        "John: Something's going on. He was way too anxious to get to some investment meeting. Which means I think I'm going to follow him.",
        "Blair: Oh -- well, I'll go with you.",
        "John: Uh-uh-uh.",
        "Blair: Come on.",
        "John: Get -- you --",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "John: No, no, no. No. You go home to your kids, all right? I -- I will call you if I find anything out.",
        "Blair: Oh -- o",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Get your hands off of me!",
        "Man: You owe me one good shot, boss. The bitch maced me!",
        "Second man: We stick to the plan, or you'll be dealing with more than pepper spray. Now, keep a better eye on her this time!",
        "Marty: No! No! No!",
        "Man: All right, let's grab what we want and get out of here. What have we got in here? Agh!",
        "Second man: Oh, hey, what -- what do we do?",
        "Marty: Shut up!",
        "Man: Take it easy. We were -- agh!",
        "Marty: Get -- get out of here! Just go!",
        "Man: All right, all right, we're leaving!",
        "Marty: Get out of here, you bastards!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh. What?",
        "Clint: I don't want to sound insulting, but I would like to say \"Thanks, I needed that.\"",
        "Dorian: I am not in the least bit insulted. Happy to help.",
        "Clint: Oh, God.",
        "Dorian: Huh. Are you thinking again?",
        "Clint: These days, I never stop. Don't you take that the wrong way.",
        "Dorian: No. I don't. Your daughter's very sick.",
        "Clint: And I need to do something.",
        "Dorian: For Jessica?",
        "Clint: For Jessica. I have to know that I tried everything. Would you hate me if I left?",
        "Dorian: Oh -- I couldn't hate you no matter what.",
        "Clint: Dorian, you have no idea how glad I am that you're in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, Nigel, when my children were little, I always thought if anything happened to them, I couldn't survive. And yet when I think of everything that all of them have had to deal with in their lives --",
        "Nigel: They wouldn't be the fine young men and women they are if they hadn't.",
        "Viki: But I still feel responsible. A mother's not supposed to let her child suffer. It's her job not to let that happen.",
        "Nigel: No one can accomplish that, Mrs. Davidson. Try as we might, we can't always protect the people we love from pain.",
        "Viki: Well, I know that -- I mean, I know it up here. But I look at my daughter, that beautiful child -- she has her whole life ahead of her, she has everything to live for, and yet she's fighting for her life, and I might be able to help her. But there is a group of doctors who don't know us from Adam, and they presume to know whose life is worth more?",
        "Nigel: Jessica needs more than an organ donor. You love her with all of your heart. She needs that if she's going to survive this. Mother's love can be the best medicine of all. Trust me, Mrs. Davidson, she can't do this without you.",
        "Viki: Well. That was certainly the perfect thing to say. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Marty -- are you all right? I saw your car on the side of the road. You all right?",
        "Marty: Yeah, I -- I am now.",
        "[Car pulls up]",
        "Miles: You sure? What happened?",
        "John: What's going on?",
        "Marty: John, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "John: Hey -- you're shaking. What happened? Hey.",
        "Marty: Hmm -- well, I'm fine. Um -- I ran out of gas, and, um -- ah, three men came by and tried to attack me.",
        "John: What, just now?",
        "Miles: Did they hurt you?",
        "Marty: No, no, I -- I had my mace, and they weren't really smart, so when I got a chance, I drove them off.",
        "John: How long ago?",
        "Marty: Uh -- five, 10 minutes ago?",
        "John: Ok, can you describe their car?",
        "Marty: Not really. Um -- it was a tan sedan, and -- I'm sorry, I was too shaken up to get their license plate number.",
        "John: It's ok. You ok?",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: And you happened to drive by right after this happens?",
        "Miles: Yes, I just happened to be driving by. And I might've been here on time to save her from those men that were attacking Marty if you hadn't detained me at the police station.",
        "Marty: Miles, what were you doing at the police station?",
        "Miles: What are you doing here? Were you following me?",
        "Marty: Miles, why were you at the police station?",
        "Miles: I was being interrogated by John and Blair.",
        "John: Answer the question -- how is it you happened to be driving by right at the moment Marty's being assaulted?",
        "Miles: I was going to the meeting.",
        "John: Oh, right, \"the meeting.\" Where was that again?",
        "Miles: You want to call them, check out my story?",
        "John: Trust me, I will.",
        "Miles: Marty, I'd be happy to drive you home to Llanview.",
        "John: Well, we wouldn't want you to be late for your meeting, would we?",
        "Miles: Marty needs my help.",
        "Marty: No --",
        "Miles: It's more important.",
        "Marty: Miles, it's ok, go to your meeting. I'm sure John can drive me home. And I'll call the auto club to get my car, because that's what I pay them for.",
        "John: I'll take you to the station where you can file a report.",
        "Miles: What, right now? Can't you see how shaken up she is?",
        "John: While the incident is fresh in your memory, it's important to get a description of these guys before the details fade.",
        "Marty: No, he's right, Miles. I can see their faces pretty clear right now.",
        "John: Come on.",

        "Blair: Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Come in.",
        "Blair: Hey. Katie said that you and Clint were up here, and then he left. Some kind of lovers' spat?",
        "Dorian: Oh, not at all. So you don't know?",
        "Blair: Don't know what?",
        "Dorian: Honey, there's been some really terrible news about Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I think I've kept you up long enough. I'm going to go. Thank you so much for the conversation.",
        "Nigel: Certainly. I'll let Mr. Clint know that you were here.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Clint: Viki. What are you doing here?",
        "Nigel: I'll leave you two to talk. Take good care of yourself, Mrs. Davidson.",
        "Viki: Nigel, thank you for everything. Well, Nigel wasn't sure you'd be home this evening.",
        "Clint: Is there any news about Jessica?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Clint: Uh -- I just wished things hadn't got so damn complicated.",
        "Viki: Which things are you talking about?",
        "Clint: Jessica and Nash -- she's in love with him.",
        "Viki: Well, Clint, he's in love with her. I mean, he hasn't made that a secret, has he?",
        "Clint: And she loves him, too. Viki, Jessica told Antonio that their marriage is over.",
        "Viki: When did that happen?",
        "Clint: Today, after you left.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God. That's -- that's what she's been trying to say. What can we do about this?",
        "Clint: Well, there's nothing that we can do about it.",
        "Viki: There's nothing we can do about anything, apparently! I mean, we're -- we're, like, completely helpless.",
        "Clint: I don't know what to do, but maybe if we put our heads together, we can come up with something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You are not going to die. We are going to find a donor, you'll get the surgery, and you'll be fine. You and Bree will be stomping grapes in the vineyard before you know it.",
        "Jessica: When you say it like that, I almost believe it.",
        "Nash: Well, you better because it's true. We don't have to hide anymore. We are going to be together forever.",
        "Jessica: Well, we should enjoy it while we can, because there might not be a happily-ever-after for you and I.",
        "Nash: You listen. I believed with all of my heart that Tess and I would be together forever. That dream didn't come true, and I almost didn't want to live anymore because of it. But you gave me a reason. You gave me a new dream -- a dream that was even better than the old one. You and I are going to be happy together, because we have been through too much to not be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I am your brother, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: I'm not a Vega, I'm a Santi -- you're my cousin. Mami lied to me just like everybody else has been lying to me and I want some truth in my life.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, well, biology's not the truth, family is, and we were raised as brothers, so that means we're brothers.",
        "Antonio: Well, things are different",
        "Cristian: Antonio, come on --",
        "Antonio: Completely different! You stabbed me in my back!",
        "Cristian: I thought telling you would do more harm than good. Haven't you been listening to me? I -- I never knew this would happen, man!",
        "Antonio: It might not have if you'd told me sooner.",
        "Cristian: How would that have changed anything?",
        "Antonio: Back then, Jessica was still torn. I might've had a fighting chance! I might've been able to keep Nash out of our lives, but you took that chance away from me by being quiet. A brother wouldn't have done that. You're nothing to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: That's all you remember?",
        "Marty: I'm sorry. I just -- it all happened so fast, and the last thing I was thinking about was what kind of car they were driving.",
        "John: I understand. If you feel up to it, I'd still like you to look at some mug shots.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I got a really good look at them, especially the leader.",
        "John: Sounds like you handled yourself r b",
        "Marty: I've taken a lot of self-defense classes. Once you've been a victim of a violent crime, you make sure it never happens again.",
        "John: I'll -- I'll get you some more hot water for your tea.",
        "Marty: Thanks. John?",
        "John: Hmm?",
        "Marty: Why were you so suspicious of Miles?",
        "John: Oh, it's just a gut thing.",
        "Marty: But in this case, he didn't do anything wrong.",
        "John: Did he know where you were going tonight?",
        "Marty: Actually, he did.",
        "John: And he just happened to take the same route to his meeting?",
        "Marty: But you said that all checked out.",
        "John: I just -- I still think it's too much of a coincidence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: What's up with calling us back here? The cops could show up any minute.",
        "Miles: They're already gone.",
        "Man: Where were you before?",
        "Miles: I was delayed. What happened?",
        "Man: That lady didn't need rescuing, she kicked the crap out of us. I almost busted my -- nearly blinded earl, and who knows what to Gus' face.",
        "Miles: What did you do to her?",
        "Man: What you told us to do. But we were stalling for time, so we had to improvise a little. If you'd shown up on time, none of this would've happened.",
        "Miles: Did you hurt her?",
        "Man: You told us not to, so we held back, but it wasn't easy -- bitch has a wicked kick.",
        "Miles: Don't you call her that.",
        "Man: This is going to cost you extra, pal. We weren't expecting to get hurt -- that wasn't part of the deal.",
        "Miles: Fine. Here. Was she really that tough?",
        "Man: Like I said, we held back because you didn't want her hurt. But I'm telling you, man, she was like the terminator.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I will go down first thing tomorrow morning and be tested.",
        "Dorian: Thank you, honey, I knew you would.",
        "Blair: There's nothing I wouldn't do for Jessica. Todd would want that -- she's always been his favorite.",
        "Dorian: Why wouldn't she be? She's a wonderful young woman.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Hmm -- I just can't imagine what Viki and Clint must be going through right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I mean, I can't even be a donor. We've done everything we can. I -- it seems we're out of options here.",
        "Clint: Maybe there is something that we haven't thought of.",
        "Viki: Well, maybe there's an experimental procedure or something, right?",
        "Clint: That's -- that's what I was thinking. There usually is, and the place to find that out is the national institute of health.",
        "Viki: Well, \"The Banner\" must have a contact there.",
        "Clint: Yeah, you're right. Why don't you call, get some names. I'll put on a pot of coffee. Hey, Viki, when I get back we're going to go online, we're going to enter \"liver cancer,\" there's going to be hundreds of sites, and we're going to examine all of them together. At least we'll be doing something other than waiting.",
        "Viki: And maybe -- maybe we'll find something that will help Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Look, Antonio, I know you're angry right now, and believe me, I -- I get it. But, you know, once you've had a chance to calm down --",
        "Antonio: I don't want to calm down, damn it! It's all too little, too late for me and Jessica -- and for us.",
        "Cristian: Come on, man, this is stupid!",
        "Antonio: No, there's nothing left to say. All I want to do is get the hell out of here. I can't be in this hospital for another minute. I can't stand to be around you -- any of you. You're all damn liars. I have to leave before I do something I'll regret.",
        "Cristian: Antonio, hold on a second -- let's go --",
        "Antonio: Get away from me. I mean it.",
        "Cristian: Ok -- ok, fine. But no matter what you said, you're my brother, and I love you.",
        "Antonio: Jessica said she loved me, too. Look how that turned out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: We can't ignore what's happening. Maybe me being sick is punishment for breaking Antonio's heart.",
        "Nash: Don't you say that. Don't you even think it. We both know it doesn't work that way. We can't help that we fell in love with each other and we're not being punished for it. Nobody would want you to lie, not even Antonio. We love each other -- that's a good thing. It is that love that's going to get you through this. Right?",
        "Jessica: You seem so sure.",
        "Nash: I am as sure of that as I am of how much I love you.",
