        "Cole: Hey, Mom. You know, I was thinking --",
        "Marty: What?",
        "Cole: Well, since you're staying home from work, you can call me in sick from school, and we can go down to the garden store and pick out stuff for the window boxes.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Nice try.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Marty: Look, I had an unpleasant incident last night, but I'm fine.",
        "Cole: \"Unpleasant incident\"? Mom, you were almost carjacked.",
        "Marty: \"Almost\" being the operative word. And I love you for remembering that your dad always liked to do the window boxes just before Memorial Day. But you're not staying home with me.",
        "Cole: You know, it shouldn't have happened to you, not after everything else.",
        "Marty: I thought about feeling sorry for myself and then I thought about Jessica, and everything she's going through, and I'm lucky. I have my health, and most importantly, I have you.",
        "Cole: Hmm. I love you, Mom.",
        "Marty: I love you for not thinking it's geeky to say that.",
        "Cole: Yeah, just don't make me say it in public.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I cannot thank you enough for doing this. I can coach singing, but I don't know bubkes about dance.",
        "Man: It's ok, I told you. You know, I'm between shows.",
        "Marcie: Well, if I don't find someone to take over this lead, you may be dancing the lead. Why is it that in life, there just never seem to be enough guys?",
        "Starr: I have to go talk to Mrs. McBain.",
        "Langston: Yo, Markko. So I guess sticking needles in your eyes wasn't as fun as you thought?",
        "Markko: I'm here for a good laugh, that's all.",
        "Langston: You know what? I don't buy that, or you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Um -- Dorian, did you get my -- my blood to the lab?",
        "Dorian: Against my better judgment, yes. But Paige is in charge of the testing, so I couldn't very well hand in your sample with your name on it, so I put mine on it. If it comes back a match, we'll deal with it then.",
        "Viki: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Dorian: Why, I would do anything, anything at all to help you, Viki.",
        "Clint: Well, we appreciate you doing that. There's your coffee.",
        "Dorian: Thank you.",
        "Adriana: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Oh!",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Adriana.",
        "Rex: We want to sign up.",
        "Adriana: Yes, if we can help Jessica, we're here.",
        "Clint: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's wonderful. Excuse me -- just a word with you, please. Rex? Oh. Adriana has confided in me about you.",
        "Rex: Butt out, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: No, you butt out. You have got to stop this investigation of Tate Harmon. It's hurting her.",
        "Rex: You don't think I know that? I love Adriana. I don't care what anybody says, but that guy is what Roxy would call a 24-carat phony.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kirk: Nothing but bad news, as usual. Well, at least they're not calling you a queer anymore.",
        "Tate: \"Gay,\" dad. Rex called me \"gay.\"",
        "Kirk: They say it themselves -- \"I'm queer and I'm here.\"",
        "Tate: Yeah, well, they can. We can't.",
        "Kirk: Well, at least they're not calling you one. You know, you've got to start thinking about a little damage control. All your endorsement deals and career as a sportscaster, that could all go right down the tubes.",
        "Tate: Yeah. Thanks, Dad -- I hadn't thought about that.",
        "Kirk: And the fact that you can't pitch anymore doesn't help. Hello. Whoa. Son? I think I've found you a way out.",
        "Tate: What? You're kidding me, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: CSU didn't find anything at Cristian's studio?",
        "Talia: Nothing that we can use.",
        "Bo: But the place was ransacked.",
        "John: By someone wearing gloves. The tubing, the carbon monoxide canister -- everything was wiped clean.",
        "Bo: I hope I'm not to blame for this.",
        "Talia: Sir --",
        "Bo: No, I told the O.P.P. bring it on. I guess they did -- just not at me.",
        "John: Hey, look, Cris -- Cris Vega wanted clearance to get back into his studio. I told him it was ok.",
        "Talia: Trouble is, after it got trashed, there is not much to go back to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: They can't take away your talent.",
        "Cristian: I wasn't thinking about me.",
        "Lindsay: Evangeline?",
        "Cristian: I brought her here so I could show her this, so she could see that I was working again. She was so happy.",
        "Lindsay: What happened to her was not your fault.",
        "Cristian: She may never be the same. And last night, my brother tells me that he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore. How am I supposed to start over after that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Did you put an officer outside Evangeline's room?",
        "John: Yeah, and I briefed Layla. She's -- she's in with her, so is her mother.",
        "Bo: That's terrible.",
        "Talia: I understand the feds are getting involved with us now?",
        "Bo: Yeah. John called in a favor.",
        "John: Hey, it goes both ways, you know? They've had these guys on their radar for a while. I figure, you know, we exchange information, maybe we catch a break.",
        "Bo: All right. Well, I'm going to call their point guy on this and see what the profilers have come up with.",
        "John: All right, boss.",
        "Talia: I understand you used to be a Federal Agent?",
        "John: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Talia: What was that like?",
        "John: Well, they got fancier gear, but at the end of the day, you still have to rely on your own instincts.",
        "Talia: And what are your instincts telling you now?",
        "John: What are my instincts telling me now? Well, somebody's watching this town closely and they've got themselves some sort of hit list.",
        "Talia: Yeah, everybody who's not white.",
        "John: You know, everybody's connected to this in some way -- if not directly, by association. But you know what we need? We need a fresh perspective and the F.B.I. has got the best damn profilers in the world.",
        "Talia: After we get the profile, what then?",
        "John: We turn over every rock until we find these guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: Now, let me get this straight -- your idea of damage control is for me to give away my liver?",
        "Kirk: It's not your whole liver.",
        "Tate: Still, I --",
        "Kirk: Besides, you're not going to match. But if you make the offer, the whole world will know. W are they going to find that out?",
        "Kirk: The girl's a Buchanan. Her mother owns this paper, probably half the town. You go down, you sign up, you take the test, and she'll run your name in this paper, at least to get other people to sign up to do it, too. Come on. Come on -- I'll go down to the hospital with you, show the whole world I stand behind you.",
        "Tate: You know, I don't even like to think about my liver, much less giving away a piece of it. All right. I'll do it.",
        "Kirk: I knew you would.",
        "Tate: But not because of the publicity -- because it's the right thing to do.",
        "Kirk: Yeah -- whatever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Police are done here, so I'm just going to bring in a cleaning crew and in a few days, you won't even know what happened here.",
        "Cristian: I'll know.",
        "Lindsay: I know you feel awful about what happened to Evangeline, but I'm going to say it as many times as you need to hear it -- it wasn't your fault.",
        "Cristian: She would never have come here if it weren't for my ego. I mean, I had to show her. I had to show her that I had something going on.",
        "Lindsay: I was the one who said \"why don't you show her your work?\" It was me. And as far as your painting goes, it could use a little more of your ego. Now, stop beating yourself up -- you almost got killed, too.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, well, I feel like part of me died yesterday. I lost my brother.",
        "Lindsay: Do you want to talk about that?",
        "Cristian: I knew something about his life and I kept it from him, and of course he found out. I was so stupid. I was so stupid to think I was doing him a favor.",
        "Lindsay: Well, you know what I think? I think you should give him a little bit of time because that will give him some perspective and he's going to realize that that was not your intention.",
        "Cristian: Angry as he is, I wouldn't count on it.",

        "[Marty gasps] [Knock on door]",
        "Miles: Marty, it's Miles. I went to your office, they said you weren't coming in.",
        "Marty: Oh.",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Miles: Marty!",
        "Marty: Coming! [Marty sighs]",
        "Miles: Are you all right? I heard you cry out.",
        "Marty: Oh, Miles, what -- what are you doing here?",
        "Miles: Can I come in?",
        "Marty: Yeah. No, I just -- I was having a bad dream, that's all. I -- I didn't realize I actually cried out.",
        "Miles: You were dreaming about what happened last night, weren't you? Was she really that tough?",
        "Man: Like I said, we held back because you didn't want her hurt. But, I'm telling you, man, she was like the terminator.",
        "Miles: I should've protected you.",
        "Marty: Yes. Miles, you should've known that I was going to run out of gas and be carjacked. Just like you should've known that, you know, Todd was going to ignore what the police said in Chicago and walk into that trap. You know, what is wrong with you? Why aren't you psychic? [Marty chuckles]",
        "Miles: You're my friend. I don't like when bad things happen to my friends.",
        "Marty: Well, I appreciate that, but I'm fine. It was -- you know, it was just a bad dream.",
        "Miles: About those guys?",
        "Marty: I -- I don't know what it was about.",
        "Miles: I think you're lying.",
        "Marty: What?",
        "Miles: Why don't you trust me?",
        "Marty: Miles, you're a nice guy, but I'm really getting tired of you telling me how I feel.",
        "Miles: Sorry.",
        "Marty: It's ok.",
        "Miles: No, it's just I can tell that you're holding something back and that's dangerous -- for you, I mean.",
        "Marty: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Miles: Look, I can tell when people are being upfront and when they're not.",
        "Marty: Wow. I had to spend a lot of money and go to school for a long time before I could do that.",
        "Miles: Ok, I get it. I won't pry. I just thought I'd come by and see how you're doing and when I heard you screaming --",
        "Marty: I didn't really scream.",
        "Miles: Close enough.",
        "Marty: It was very thoughtful of you to think of me, but I am fine.",
        "Miles: Well, if -- if you're fine, then why didn't you go to work?",
        "Marty: Because I have to go down to the police station. John wants me to look over my statement from last night.",
        "Miles: Hmm -- right. You think they found those guys?",
        "Marty: No, probably not. I mean, all they had to go on was my description. I didn't see their faces anywhere in the mug shot books.",
        "Miles: Oh. I -- I could drive you.",
        "Marty: No, I've got my car. I can drive myself.",
        "Miles: As long as you're all right.",
        "Marty: I'll walk you out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Yeah, well, what do I care what some weird girl thinks about me?",
        "Langston: Oh, I'm weird, for sure. Writing my own play makes me the ultimate geek, so why do you keep hanging out wherever I am?",
        "Markko: I don't.",
        "Langston: You were here yesterday.",
        "Markko: Hey, I left something here, ok?",
        "Langston: Oh, what was it? Your ball?",
        "Markko: I don't play ball and I don't dance -- not your kind of dancing anyway.",
        "Langston: Huh. [Langston clucks]",
        "Markko: Man, what's up with you? You think I'm afraid to be in a play?",
        "Langston: Facing a room full of people? That takes -- you're scared to put it all on the line.",
        "Markko: You think I want to be in some play you wrote? Well, what's it about? Hat about that guy over there? He looks like he can move.",
        "Starr: Markko? How can you tell?",
        "Man: Practice.",
        "Marcie: I -- I think what Blake is trying to say is that for someone who is too proud to act, he spends an awful lot of time hanging around rehearsal.",
        "Blake: Well, if we ask him to learn the dance with Starr, I think he'd be --",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? He would never do it.",
        "Blake: What's the matter with boys in high school? Hey, you? Yeah, you -- come here. Loosen up a little, dance with this girl. You might like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Harmon has Adriana completely snowed.",
        "Dorian: Oh, and what could he do to her that you haven't already done worse?",
        "Rex: He's working an angle, I'm sure of it.",
        "Dorian: What were you thinking, going on national television and saying he was gay? I mean, that was absolutely --",
        "Rex: Stupid?",
        "Dorian: It backfired.",
        "Rex: All I wanted to do was protect Adriana. That's all I care about.",
        "Viki: If you take this p the form to the lab, they'll draw your blood. Thank you.",
        "Adriana: Ok. How's Jessica doing?",
        "Clint: Well, she's scared and hiding it, but she's very, very strong.",
        "Rex: Harmon's here?",
        "Dorian: Oh, and it looks like he's going to make a beeline for Adriana.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Tate: Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Oh, hey.",
        "Tate: I didn't know you were going to be here.",
        "Adriana: Neither did I, actually.",
        "Tate: Uh -- you remember my dad?",
        "Adriana: Oh, yes. Hi, how are you?",
        "Kirk: Good, thank you.",
        "Adriana: Um -- this is Clint Buchanan and Viki Davidson. They're Jessica's parents.",
        "Kirk: Hi. Kirk Harmon.",
        "Clint: Nice to meet you.",
        "Viki: How do you do?",
        "Kirk: I'm terribly sorry about your daughter.",
        "Clint: Thank you.",
        "Kirk: It's a terrible thing.",
        "Viki: Yes -- terrible.",
        "Kirk: Frankly, I don't know what I would do if something like that happened to Tate. That's why we're here -- we want to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I think you should just channel your frustration and loss into your work and find something to believe in again.",
        "Cristian: You're right. I will. Well, after last night, I -- I guess you know what happens to people that get involved with me.",
        "Lindsay: I'll take my chances.",
        "Cristian: I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.",
        "Lindsay: It's not an option. I know how to take care of myself.",
        "Cristian: Thanks for believing in me, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: You're so talented, more than you even realize. Use it. Use it. Find something in this room that inspires you and go with it. I barely have time for myself anymore!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blake: So what do you say -- feel like doing some dancing?",
        "Marcie: Blake, I think that we can find somebody else to dance with Starr.",
        "Blake: It's just a rehearsal.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I -- I just think it's a waste of time.",
        "Starr: No, it's really not a waste of time, though I'd need to learn the dance and it would be better than me just sitting down doing nothing, right?",
        "Marcie: Yes, but you should not be sending --",
        "Starr: It's just one rehearsal.",
        "Marcie: Fine.",
        "Starr: Well, what do you say?",
        "Cole: Sure. Why not? Uh -- what am I supposed to do?",
        "Blake: Ok, so, start standing, facing each other. And in this dance, it's supposed to be a boy-girl kind of hip little number, kind of slow, we're going to do a slow cha-cha. Take her right hand in your left -- good. Now, slide your right hand in the small of her back. Ok -- right. And it's one, two, cha- cha-cha. One, two, easy does it. Left, right, two, cha-cha. One -- keep it small.",
        "Langston: I have to go.",
        "Blake: Good.",
        "Markko: Fine by me.",
        "Blake: Nice and smooth.",
        "Langston: Oh, and over there? That's a football/baseball player learning the dance number. Hear anybody calling him names?",
        "Blake: Hold her a little closer. There, that's it. [Music plays]\ufffd Now, we're going to take it from the first couple of eights just like I showed you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So more bad dreams?",
        "Marty: No, I don't have posttraumatic stress disorder. I just have everyday, run-of-the-mill stress -- that's all.",
        "John: Yeah, well, you don't have to go through this alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "Lindsay: Hi.",
        "Bo: Thanks for coming in.",
        "Lindsay: Sure.",
        "Bo: I just want to get a statement from everybody who was at Cristian's studio, and you're the only one who actually had an interaction with this perpetrator.",
        "Lindsay: Well, I know, but the only interaction I had with him was getting clunked on the head.",
        "Bo: So it was a him?",
        "Lindsay: I just assumed.",
        "Bo: Oh. But you didn't see hands, feet, any --",
        "Lindsay: Um -- you know, my mind was on Cristian's painting and I never saw him coming. I'm so sorry.",
        "Bo: No, no, no, no. That's ok, it's ok, but if you think of something later --",
        "Lindsay: You'll be the first to know.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "Lindsay: How's Nora?",
        "Bo: Last I heard, she's -- she's doing ok, you know? She's a lot more worried about Matthew than she is herself.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah. Poor kid -- first his house burns down, and then the same group goes after his mother.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Lindsay: Oh -- you know, I have these. Um -- they're pictures that I got from will of Matthew when he was a baby. I know it's not much, but you can give those to Nora and she can add them to the photos of Jen and Sam.",
        "Bo: This is so kind of you, you know? Really.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Well, thank you. We appreciate it more than we can say.",
        "Viki: And if you take this part to the lab, they'll draw your blood. Hope it doesn't hurt.",
        "Kirk: It doesn't matter whether it hurts or not, as long as it might help your daughter.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Kirk: You had a good idea, son.",
        "Tate: Thanks, dad. So, how you doing?",
        "Adriana: Great. Busy.",
        "Kirk: You know, my son still can't stop talking about the woman that has him parading around in his underwear, not that that's a bad thing. Now, I suppose you've heard what this Rex Balsom character said about my son -- wouldn't want to catch that goon in a dark alley, I'll tell you that.",
        "Tate: Dad?",
        "Rex: I'm Rex Balsom, Mr. Harmon.",
        "Kirk: Really? Mr. Balsom?",
        "Rex: That's right.",
        "Adriana: Rex --",
        "Rex: Sounds like your son has fed you an earful about me.",
        "Tate: Dad, it's -- it's ok. Rex and I have worked things out.",
        "Rex: If I upset you and the rest of your family, I apologize.",
        "Adriana: Tate and his dad have signed up to be potential donors for Jessica. Isn't that great?",
        "Rex: Really great, considering you don't even know Jessica, or her family.",
        "Kirk: Well, it's situations like this that can turn strangers into friends.",
        "Dorian: Oh, speaking of which -- hello, Mr. Harmon. I'm Dr. Dorian Lord.",
        "Tate: Yeah, dad, this is Adriana's mom.",
        "Kirk: Adriana's mom? Well, I can certainly see where she gets her good looks.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank you. And we would all like to thank you for everything you and your son are doing to help Jessica.",

        "Viki: How's Evangeline?",
        "Talia: There's been no change, as far as I know. Actually, I'm here because I'd like to sign up to be a donor for your daughter.",
        "Viki: That's very kind of you.",
