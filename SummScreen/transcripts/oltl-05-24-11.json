        "Matthew passes out and gets rushed to the hospital before he has a chance to tell his parents that Nate knows he killed Eddie. After he comes to, he appears to be reliving riding in Cole Thornhart's car and becoming paralyzed after the accident. Bo and Nora assume that he will be ok. But the doctor tells them that Matthew has a fatal condition and they need to perform emergency surgery. Todd and Tomas are alone in the house, each threatening the other. While we see \"original Todd\" is an institution admitting that he might know who he gave his brain and personality to but knowing that nobody will kill him if he does not. Robert Ford goes to Capricorn with a nurse from the hospital who seems to like him and remembers when he was a nasty person and womanizer and remarks how she sees that he has changed. Jessica becomes Bess after a brief time of Tess replacing Wes. Brody urges Jessica to come back while Cutter urges Tess to come back. And Tess is ready to meet Cutter later at Capricorn after he tells her he has some things to take of that he won't tell her about. He goes to see Viki and Clint after Clint has found out that he has no legal grounds to invalidate his daughter's marriage to Cutter. Cutter tells Clint that he will get Tess committed and do what Clint wants for a price."

        "Nurse: Nice bun.",
        "Ford: Bet you say that to all the guys, don't you? Haven't I seen you in Pediatrics? It's Emma, right?",

        "Ford: Yeah.",
        "Emma: A lot of our volunteers in Pediatrics are trying to get over the loss of a child. Is that what you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I can't believe you didn't let me put on any mascara before my mug shot. You know those things end up on the Internet? I'm gonna look crazy in my mug--",
        "Brody: Shut up and tell me where Marty Saybrooke took my son.",
        "Tess: I told you. I don't know. Wes is gone. I don't know anything.",
        "Brody: Then you can rot in a cell.",
        "Tess: No. You're not gonna put me in a jail cell.",
        "Brody: Watch me.",

        "Nora: We need to talk about this.",
        "Matthew: I'm not just doing this because it's the right thing to do, even though it is. Somebody else knows that I killed Eddie.",
        "Bo: Who? Matt, are you ok? Matthew. Son?",
        "Nora: Matthew, honey. Matthew?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Cutter: Of course, I did, baby. I got big plans for us.",
        "Morgan: Officer Lovett, you are holding my client on absolutely baseless charges.",
        "Brody: She a material witness to the kidnapping of my son. She was with Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Morgan: No. Wes was. Wes and Tess are two entirely separate personalities. Wes is gone, and you don't actually know if he could tell you anything.",
        "Brody: He was with Marty.",
        "Morgan: You still can't hold Tess.",
        "Brody: I'll hold anyone on suspicion for 48 hours.",

        "Brody: You think give a damn about my badge right now? My son is missing. Tess can help me, and if you try to get in my way, Cutter, I will lock you up, too. Come on.",
        "Tess: Oh, no. Please, please, please, please. No. Don't put me in a cell. I'll do anything.",
        "Brody: Anything?",
        "Tess: Yes.",
        "Brody: Ok. Let Wes out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Actually, my reason for being here isn't as tragic, but I did lose my son in a custody fight.",
        "Emma: I'm sorry to hear that. So are you divorced?",
        "Ford: Actually, it's kind of a \"long story.\"",
        "Emma: It always is, right? Let me make it easy for you. Are you single?",
        "Ford: Yeah.",
        "Emma: Let me buy you a drink to say thank you for making my little patients so happy.",
        "Ford: Emma, Emma, you don't have to do that.",
        "Emma: I want to. Are you cooked, or do you feel like putting on the dog? Sorry.",
        "Ford: No. It's ok. I have heard a million of them.",
        "Emma: So what do you say? Maybe at Capricorn?",
        "Ford: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I think it was a lot easier when I believed that Tom\u00e1s tried to kill your father. Now I don't know what to think.",
        "Starr: Forget thinking. How do you feel about him?",
        "Blair: Starr, it's just not that simple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You threatened to kill me in jai remember? We came to an understanding. Need I remind you, we decided the best way to handle this was to keep our mouths shut? I keep your secret. You keep mine.",
        "Todd: I know, but if I killed you, then my secret would be sure to be safe because you would die with it.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Care to make a wager? You kill me, you destroy your own life. You willing to take that chance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I know that you had David kidnapped and put in prison in Morocco. I know that you had Liam and Ryder paternity tests both altered. I know that you had Rex's paternity test changed, because you didn't want to accept him as your son. I'm even coming to terms with the fact that you tried to destroy Bo and Nora's marriage by hiring that vile man Eddie Ford to kidnap Nora, but I am having a very hard time believing that you are capable of taking someone's life.",
        "Clint: I couldn't let Eddie Ford live to rat me out.",
        "Viki: Clint, murder? Murder is a heinous act. I do not believe you are capable of killing someone.",
        "Clint: Well, think again.",
        "Viki: No. I want you to look at me. Look at me and tell me that you murdered Eddie Ford.",

        "Nora: Is he ok?",
        "Bo: Well, his pulse is normal. Matthew. Matthew?",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He wouldn't have overdosed, would he? Would he have overdosed?",
        "Bo: No. No. I don't think so.",
        "Nora: No. There are only a few missing. Oh, thank God for that.",
        "Bo: Come on.",
        "Nora: This isn't right, Bo. He should've come to by now. I'm calling an ambulance.",
        "Bo: No. The hell with that. We're not waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Go ahead. Go on. Kill me. If you do, you'll never get the information that you need.",
        "Baker: You know what it is.",
        "Man: Maybe I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: So how long have you been divorced?",
        "Ford: Well, we only got married because of the baby. Divorce isn't a big deal. There's no love lost. She hates me, and I hate her.",
        "Emma: Wow, that sounds pretty bad.",
        "Ford: It was. Tess' idea of a good time was raking me over the coals. She loved to tell me how vain I was, how bad in bed I was, you know, how fast it went by.",
        "Emma: You know, you're not really selling yourself to me, Robert Ford.",
        "Ford: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ow! I wish I could call Wes out at will, but that's just not how it works.",
        "Brody: Tess, please. I know you hate me, but my little boy is out there with a woman who has killed one person and tried to kill two more. He is a baby. He is helpless. I'm just begging you. Please let me try.",
        "Tess: If you could get Wes out, how do you know he'd tell you anything?",
        "Brody: Wes told me he wouldn't rat Marty out, but he is my old friend from the Navy. I might be able to get through to him and get him to tell me something.",
        "Morgan: Will you release my client if she agrees to try, whether you reach Wes or not?",
        "Brody: Yes. I will.",
        "Morgan: Sounds fair to me.",
        "Cutter: No. Tess, Tess, don't do this, all right? What if Jessica comes back? What if she takes control? You can disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: What happened before he lost consciousness?",
        "Bo: One minute, he was talking to us. The next minute, he collapsed.",
        "Nora: We found this bottle of aspirin on the table, but there's only a few missing.",
        "Bo: Could those have anything to do with this?",
        "Doctor: A bump on the back of his head. Looks new. Has he fallen indo the last day or two, bumped his head on something?",
        "Bo: If he did, I don't know about it.",
        "Nora: No. Me, neither.",
        "Doctor: I'm gonna draw some admitting bloods and some for toxicology. Then we're gonna get him to Radiology for a CT scan and C-spine.",
        "Bo: What's wrong with him, Doctor?",
        "Doctor: We're going to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Clint, did you kill Eddie Ford?",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi, Viki.",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a, hi. Nice to see you.",
        "T\u00e9a: How you feeling, Clint?",
        "Clint: I'm fine. Thank you for coming.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, of course. Listen. I am so sorry about what her baby. I've been meaning to call, but with Todd just back from the hospital and my brother still unsettled--",
        "Viki: Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. I expect you must be very relieved, actually, that Todd realized he was mistaken when he accused your brother, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It seems like there is something off about this whole Dad and Tom\u00e1s thing. Dad has files hidden in his desk. The CIA has a file on Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Blair: Oh, and I remember when I wanted to confront Tom\u00e1s about it, you stopped me. Do you remember that?",
        "Starr: Because I thought you wanted to see him again. I also thought that he tried to kill Dad. It's a little different now.",
        "Blair: Well, I just think that there's something not right about Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Starr: There's something not right about everybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You really think I didn't see this coming? You're not exactly subtle.",
        "Todd: I'm not asking you out on a date, Tom\u00e1s. I'm gonna kill you.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No. You're not. I know you don't like having me here, but you're gonna have to make the best of it.",
        "Todd: I am?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Afraid so. See, there's a contingency plan.",
        "Todd: What, like the microfiche goes to the news if you die?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Right, microfiche. No. I'm sorry. Everything I know goes straight to my sister, and you know exactly what will happen if she finds out about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm glad that my brother was cleared in Todd's shooting. Now I'm free to defend Clint. Though I do wish you had spoken to me before you confessed everything on TV. It would have made my job a whole lot easier.",
        "Clint: Well, I have no intention of worming my way out of anything. I'm taking full responsibility for everything that I did, including killing Eddie Ford.",
        "T\u00e9a: So then why do you want to hire me?",
        "Clint: Not to save my sorry hide, that's for sure. I want you to save our daughter Jessica. Tess' husband is using her to squeeze money out of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I had to get locked up for a long time before I was able to come back out again.",
        "Brody: Open your eyes, Tess. Cutter doesn't care about you. He's afraid of losing his cash cow.",
        "Tess: Who you calling a cow, ape man?",
        "Cutter: Yeah, and the word \"cash\" doesn't apply, either. Ever since she lost Ryder, she's broke. Tess, listen to me, all right? After I seal this deal, and we get the big bucks, I'm taking you away from everybody who knows Jessica. You never have to worry about disappearing again.",
        "Brody: He's lying to you.",
        "Cutter: I swear, I'm not, ok? Don't let Brody do this. You could lose yourself.",
        "Brody: Fine. I'm taking you to holding.",
        "Tess: No. Ow! Ow!",
        "Cutter: Tess, what's 48 hours compared to all the time you weren't allowed to be Tess?",
        "Tess: Would you willingly go to jail?",
        "Cutter: That's a moot point. I don't have an alter that might know where the babynapper is, ok? You can handle this. You're strong. What's a couple nights in jail, anyways?",
        "Tess: Cutter is right. I'm strong, which means I can fight my way back if I need to. You win, ape man. Talk to Wes.",
        "Cutter: Look, but--",
        "Tess: So, C.W. You're my husband, but you're not the boss of me. Go for it, SEAL.",
        "Brody: Wes-- Wes, it's me--Lovett. You know, we've always had each other's backs. We've manned up when lesser men would've turned tail. I'm in a jam, bro. It's about a kid again. Remember that kid in Iraq, right? This time, it's my own son. Please don't let me lose another little boy. Wes?",
        "Bess: Wes isn't available at the moment. I'm Bess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I hope they get here with those CT results.",
        "Nora: What if it's something serious, Bo?",
        "Bo: Oh, honey, it's gonna be ok.",
        "Matthew: Mom...",
        "Nora: Hey.",
        "Matthew: Mom, Dad...",
        "Bo: Hey, bud. Hey, how you feeling?",
        "Matthew: Ok, I guess.",
        "Bo: Hey, why'd you pass t? Did you hit your head?",
        "Matthew: I don't know. I don't remember.",
        "Nora: Do you know what happened?",
        "Matthew: I got in the car with Cole, and he was driving.",
        "Nora: Cole?",
        "Matthew: He found me, my legs.",
        "Nora: Matthew?",
        "Matthew: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I sorry for everything.",
        "Nora: No, sweetheart. Ok. It's ok. Shh shh shh. Nothing to be sorry for, sweetie, nothing, nothing to worry about. Don't even worry about Eddie Ford.",
        "Matthew: Who?",
        "Nora: Matthew--",
        "Matthew: Look. I just want to be able to walk again.",
        "Bo: I'll get the doctor.",
        "Matthew: Mom...",
        "Nora: I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm right here, sweetie. It's ok. Everything is gonna be ok. It's ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Tess and Ford lost custody of their baby. So Ford finally came to his senses, decided to commit Tess. Of course, she ran off, had the marriage annulled, and promptly married Cutter Wentworth.",
        "Clint: Who's a con man and a thief.",
        "Viki: And he's Joey's brother-in-law. He's Aubrey's brother.",
        "Clint: And he's trying to get money from us in exchange for getting Tess help.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you don't want to pay him.",
        "Clint: Aw, hell, I'll pay him anything he wants. It's just that I will pay for the annulment and the marriage license to prove that they were legally wed, but I am not gonna take his word for it. I need an expert opinion on it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course.",
        "Clint: Whew. So are they legal?",
        "Viki: The thing is, if the marriage is not legal, then we have the right to commit Jessica.",
        "Clint: Yeah, and we would have our daughter back. It would mean so much to me to see Jessica again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Who the hell are you?",
        "Bess: There's no need for such language, young man. I'm the gatekeeper.",
        "Brody: That means she's in charge, but I need to speak to Wes. Can you please help me?",
        "Bess: Wes isn't talking right now, Lieutenant. He's acting under some misguided loyalty to Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "Brody: I need to find where Marty is. You have to help me.",
        "Bess: I only have to help Jessica, and that means keeping her out of jail.",
        "Brody: Then can you help me? Can you get to Wes?",
        "Bess: Wes guards his secrets very closely, but I was able to extract one name.",
        "Brody: What name?",
        "Bess: Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're bluffing. There's no contingency plan.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Of course, there is. Like me to prove it? Why don't you have a good, long look at this? Then you can decide if it's worth the risk trying to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: But I need a guarantee. If I tell you who I gave it to, how do I know you're not just gonna kill me afterwards?",
        "Baker: You have my word.",
        "Man: So I tell you what you want to know, and then you're just gonna let me walk right out of here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: When I first met James, he was a car thief who stole $50,000 from his dad. I had no idea his dad was an abusive creep, not for a while.",
        "Blair: But you still trusted him right away?",
        "Starr: Not exactly...",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Starr: And that is my point. Things weren't right with him, either. They still aren't perfect. His ex is here, and every time James and I try to be alone, she interrupts us, or Dani does, or Ford is busy moping around because he misses Ryder. You know what?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Starr: I think Ford misses Tess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You're right. I guess I've never treated women right. When I was first with my ex, she was fragile, and I took advantage of that, got her pregnant.",
        "Emma: Wow, Ford, you're really pulling out the stops here.",
        "Ford: I guess I don't have much of a defense. I was a jerk for a long time, but I am trying to change my ways.",
        "Emma: Really? Are you sure about that?",
        "Ford: Yeah. Why?",
        "Emma: You don't remember me, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Seems like things are never right or perfect with James and me, not in that usual kind of way, but that doesn't stop my heart from bursting open every time I think about him, and, Mom, I'm so happy that I took a chance with him. I just want you to be happy, too.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, I want to be a happy, too.",
        "Starr: So...",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Starr: You gonna try again wit Tom\u00e1s?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: It's ok, sweetheart. Daddy is going to get the doctor, and then we're gonna make sure you get everything that you need. Sweetheart? It's ok. He came to, and he's been very confused, and his speech is slurred. I mean, he's talking about a car accident that happened a few years ago.",
        "Doctor: What you're describing is very common for patients to exhibit after a head injury.",
        "Nora: Do you know what caused it?",
        "Doctor: The headaches and nausea, the slurred speech, loss of consciousness, his confusion--they are all symptoms of his condition.",
        "Bo: What's wrong with him?",
        "Doctor: Matthew has a very serious brain injury. I can't tell you how it happened, but somewhere in the past day or two, Matthew sustained significant head trauma that's caused a bleed into the brain.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Doctor: The CT scan confirmed it. He has what we call an acute subdural hematoma.",
        "Nora: My God.",
        "Doctor: That's why he lost consciousness and why he's confused now that he's awake.",
        "Nora: But he was fine before he fainted. I mean, he had little bit of a headache. That was it.",
        "Doctor: That's often the case.",
        "Bo: But you caught it in time, right? He's gonna be ok, isn't he?",

        "Viki: I know how much it would mean to you, Clint, to see that Jess gets help and to bring her back to us.",
        "Clint: I need to make sure that she's ok before-- before I'm not around anymore to make up for what I did to her.",

        "Brody: Todd Manning? What about him?",
        "Bess: I'm afraid I have no idea.",
        "Brody: That doesn't make any sense. What would he have to do with this? Marty hates him.",
        "Cutter: All right, Lovett. You got your info. Brady, give me my wife back.",
        "Bess: How rude. What does Tess see in you?",
        "Brody: Good question.",
        "Cutter: Come on, Tess. Come on out.",

        "Bess: Jessica can't come back, not now.",
        "Brody: Why?",
        "Bess: The wounds inflicted on her have yet to heal. You cheated on her. Clint Buchanan exacerbated the situation by trying the right the wrongs visited on her by Robert Ford. You all made colossal mistakes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I made a few calls and l checked around. Unfortunately, Cutter Wentworth knew what he was doing. These have been notarized and filed with the city. They're legal and binding.",
        "Clint: Oh, God, I wanted Jessie to live happily ever after with Brody and the baby, and that's why I changed the paternity test, but all I did, I blindsided my little girl, left her vulnerable to Tess. Oh, God, I got to make this right.",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a, isn't there anything you can do?",
        "T\u00e9a: I will certainly try, and, Clint, as for your murder confession, you should consider rehiring me. I can work the system and get you a lighter sentence. You're a relative of the young man. Do you want to spend the rest of your life in prison?",
        "Clint: I'll give that some thought.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm gonna go home and make sure that my brother and Todd haven't come to blows.",

        "Tom\u00e1s: Which is why none of that will ever see the light of day as long as I stay alive, but if I die, one of my friends will give a copy of that to my sister T\u00e9a. See? Everything is gonna be all right...if you cooperate.",

        "Starr: Well, you know what I think?",
        "Blair: Hmm, what do you think? I'm sure you're gonna tell me.",
        "Starr: I think that you are way too aware of the mistakes that you made with Eli to let them happen again, Mom. You have learned a lot.",
        "Blair: Well, I certainly hope so.",
        "Starr: Hey, I know so. You were practically glowing the night you were waiting for Tom\u00e1s to show up.",
        "Blair: Glowing. Hmm, must've been my new moisturizer.",
        "Starr: Well, if it was your new moisturizer, I would have to say that it may not be right or perfect, but it can't be that bad if it does that to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Did you and I--",
        "Emma: Relax. We didn't sleep together. When you were in the hospital a year ago, it was before I finished my training in Pediatrics. Ok. I'll just say in it. We used to draw straws to see who would give you your sponge bath. I won once, and you hit on me.",
        "Ford: I am so sorry. Could I have been any creepier?",
        "Emma: You seem different now, especially when you're dressed as a wiener reading Dr. Seuss to the kids.",
        "Ford: Well, a lot has happened in the last year.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: How can Jessica heal if you won't let me make it up to her?",
        "Cutter: Bess, you're right. Jessica isn't strong enough. She came out once with me, but she was forced back inside by Brody.",
        "Bess: That is true.",
        "Brody: Ok. If she can't come back for me, let her come back for her kids. I know she misses them.",
        "Cutter: Lovett, give it up.",
        "Brody: No. The last time she was out, all she wanted was her little boy, and I've never seen holding him again.",
        "Cutter: Don't listen to him. he's going to say anything.",

        "Man: Nah. I'm not convinced.",
        "Baker: Fine. Don't tell me. It's your funeral.",
        "Man: No. I don't think it is. I don't. I don't think you'll kill me, not if there's even a chance that I'll tell you what you want to know.",

        "Tess: Oh, my freedom is definitely something to celebrate.",
        "Cutter: It is, but we're also celebrating something else. I'm getting us our money.",
        "Tess: I'll go with you.",
        "Cutter: Why don't I do the grunt work, and you order the shots?",
        "Tess: Yeah. Well, don't you need an assistant?",
        "Cutter: Where I'm going is no place for a lady...or for you.",

        "T\u00e9a: Sure, he was. Why?",
        "Todd: Well, I decided I would just for some added security against whoever is trying to kill me. Obviously, he would need to know where the gun is.",
        "T\u00e9a: The truth, anyone?",
        "Todd: Well, what other reason t would I have to have the gun drawn on him? If anyone was gonna shoot anyone, he was gonna shoot me. I'm the one that accused him of killing me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Right, right. Uh-huh.",

        "Clint: Viki, why would I say I did it if I didn't?",
        "Viki: That is still not an answer. Matthew's condition is extremely grave. Right now, there's a large collection of blood on the surface of his brain. It's causing pressure on his brain that needs to be relieved as soon as possible to prevent in brain damage or death. We need to act, and we need to act now.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Did you care about your ex?",
        "Ford: You know what? You're right. I really am bombing at selling myself to you. What am I doing talking about my ex with someone that I actually like? I swear, I used to have so much more game than this.",
        "Emma: Probably, but I'm really glad that you're not that smooth-talking lover boy you were at the hospital a year ago. Seems like you've paid your dues.",
        "Ford: I don't know about that, but I sure miss my kid. I can't go back to being the guy that doesn't care about anybody but himself.",
        "Emma: Well, that's not so bad, is it?",
        "Ford: I don't know. Sometimes I wish I could, like right now. It'd make having this drink with you a lot easier.",
        "Emma: Hmm. Maybe this will help you.",

        "T\u00e9a: I don't suppose you're gonna tell me what really happened between you and my brother while I was gone.",
