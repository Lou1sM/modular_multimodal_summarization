        "Michael: Didn't I just marry you a couple of days ago?",
        "Marcie: You know, I thought you looked familiar.",
        "Michael: Listen, I am so sorry about all of this, but they finally cut me. Yeah, they let me go. So what do you think? We go home, we get that honeymoon started?",
        "Marcie: Oh, now, that's why I'm here, because nothing is going to stop us this time.",
        "Paramedic: We just found this baby in the rubble of a destroyed building.",
        "Michael: Oh -- get me a warming isolette. We're going to need to start a line. Honey, I --",

        "Reporter: I'm reporting live from Lehigh prison, scene of publisher and accused baby killer Todd Manning's upcoming execution. With only 24 hours left, Manning's time is running out.",
        "Second reporter: Mrs. Davidson, any statement on your brother's impending execution?",
        "Viki: Yes. I will repeat what I said earlier -- I am here to do whatever I can to make sure that my brother is not executed tomorrow.",
        "Reporter: Do you think he's innocent?",
        "Dorian: If you do, you're as guilty as he is.",

        "Todd: How about a hug from you, Jack?",
        "Starr: Jack, give dad a hug.",

        "Blair: Please -- please, will you just let me in to see Todd before it's too late? Please?",

        "Blair: Oh. But I --",
        "Officer: Hello? Hello? Who is this?",
        "John: Listen to me. I need to speak to someone in charge, or you're going to execute a man for something he didn't do!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: The last thing you said to me was you were sorry. That's what you felt in the end -- regret. Want to talk about regret? I live regret. I regret so much, so many things -- not seeing you grow up. Trying to get you out of my mind, I couldn't. I thought about you every day. I know that's not enough, it's -- it's nothing. Not being a good father. I wasn't a good father, I know that. Maybe that's why you slept with Kelly. You fell in love with her, trying to send me a message. Well, I got it, and it hurts every time I think about it. Your son's not supposed to sleep with your wife -- fianc\u00e9e, whatever. It just drives me crazy. I just want to hurt something, somebody, like I hurt. When I sit here, I look at your grave, I see your name on some stick in the ground, it just seems so wrong to -- to feel all this rage. But it's there. I can't get rid of it. I don't know what to do. How do you hate your son? I did, I hated you for being everything to Kelly that I couldn't be, for betraying me. I hated Kelly for turning to you, and when I saw her at that -- at your funeral, sitting there, reminding me that I chose her to live over you, I just -- I just lost it. I mean, I just -- I was so angry. Now here I am. It just seems pointless, because you're gone, forever. And I just know that I miss you so much, and I just wish that I could hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you, and that everything's ok. But I can't. I'm the one who's sorry, Duke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I know you and Duke were close.",
        "Adriana: We weren't, not anymore. I had moved on, and Duke was in love with you.",
        "Kelly: It's not that simple.",
        "Adriana: It was for Duke. Listen, Kelly, I don't want this thing to come between us. We almost lost you, and all that matters is that we're family and we need each other, especially now. I just wanted to know if you miss Duke the way you miss someone you love, not just someone you cared about.",
        "Kelly: Of course I miss Duke. I feel responsible for what happened to him. He was my best friend. I -- but I wasn't in love with him.",
        "Adriana: Were they talking about Duke on the news again?",
        "Kelly: No. They're talking about Todd's execution. God. When I think of what Blair and those kids have been through because of that murderer.",

        "Woman: You're a total disgrace.",
        "Viki: I do not agree with capital punishment for any reason. And it's not just because of my brother. Although, obviously, yes, this is personal for me in this particular case. I don't want my brother to die! No one should be put to death by the state. But in this particular instance, my brother is innocent, which is why I'm here and why I'm going to stay here all night along with the rest of Todd's supporters. And I'm very grateful to everyone who is standing here with me tonight to -- to protest and to try to stop this injustice.",

        "Blair: No.",
        "Officer: Then I can't help you. Manning's going to die tomorrow. Baby killer or not, he's got the right to say who he wants to spend his time with. He doesn't want you in there, I'm not letting you in.",

        "Jack: I was a baby, so was Starr. Why didn't you kill us?",
        "Starr: Because he's not a baby killer, Jack! All those people that are saying that stuff out there are stupid!",

        "Michael: He's doing a lot better.",
        "Marcie: Oh, good.",
        "Michael: We thought he was hypothermic, so we're warming him up. He is a little dehydrated, but he's going to be fine.",
        "Marcie: Oh, good. So has he been alone ever since the tornado hit?",
        "Michael: Yeah, it looks that way. It's a good thing it's been warm, you know, or I don't think he would've made it.",
        "Marcie: Well, I mean, what about his parents? You know, I've been watching the news, and I haven't heard anything on the news about any missing child.",
        "Michael: Um -- one of the EMTs told me that he found two other bodies in the rubble -- a man and a woman. The woman was wrapped around the child.",
        "Marcie: So those were his parents? That was his mother?",
        "Michael: We won't know for certain until we get a positive ID, but that's what we're assuming. It looks as if they died trying to save him.",

        "Todd: Hey, Jack? You know your mom loves you? And you were right when you said you should do what she says. But you can feel whatever you want. You can still love me, even if she doesn't, and you wouldn't be letting her down. I mean, I think she'd -- she'd tell you the same thing if you asked her.",
        "Starr: That's right, Jack. He's not some type of monster. He would never hurt you.",
        "Jack: I'm not scared of him.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's good. I love you. I love both of you so much -- more than anything. God, you're going to be so beautiful -- Just like your mom.",

        "Blair: What'd you say to Todd?",
        "Spencer: 24 hours from now, you'll be nothing but a memory. And I'll be safe at home, comforting Blair. I just wanted to make sure that he knew that I was going to look after you and the kids.",
        "Blair: You had no right. Why'd you do that?",

        "Evangeline: I laid out a case for a stay of execution to governor brooks, and now we just have to wait and see what he decides.",

        "Evangeline: I'm doing everything I can, Viki.",
        "Viki: I know you are. I'm so sorry, Evangeline, and believe me, it's heroic on your part, given your injuries.",

        "Layla: Vange has been more focused than ever, and that's saying a lot.",
        "Viki: Look, is there anything I could say now, a statement I could make to the press right here that would sway the governor?",
        "Evangeline: I wish there was, but we really have done everything we can. We just -- we just have to hope that he reads through everything I left, and that something raises enough questions to convince him that there's something that the jury missed and the court missed.",
        "Viki: Like what?",
        "Evangeline: Well, for one thing, the initial autopsy report was wrong.",

        "David: Hey, what's plan b since plan a apparently hinges on getting a call through to the United States and all the lines are still down?",
        "John: Well, maybe these house phones are working again. Yeah, front desk? Yeah -- do you speak English? Ok, that's good. Ok, I'll talk slow. Listen, I can't get a line out. I -- I need to make a call to the United States and I cannot get a line out, so I need you to find -- get me -- can you flag down a cop? That's right, a policeman. Mc Bain -- yes, can you get a cop up to my room right now?",

        "Adriana: How can you even think about what's happening with Todd?",
        "Kelly: Well, it's better than thinking about what happened with Duke and what I did to Kevin. I'm not just feeling sorry for myself, you know.",
        "Adriana: I'm not lying in a hospital bed a few days out of heart surgery, so I'm not judging. But I knew Duke pretty well, and I think if the choice was his, he would've picked you to live, too. And I think you know that. So what do you say you get over this survivor's guilt and be the person that Duke fell in love with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I picked out Duke's headstone today. I called Lee Ann, asked her what should be on it. She's his -- she's his mom. She knows him best.",
        "Clint: Right. What'd she say?",
        "Kevin: She said it should say \"Duke\" instead of \"Demerest,\" said he didn't like his name so much. I -- I didn't know that. I mean, I knew he went by \"Duke,\" but I -- I didn't know he didn't like the name I'd given him.",
        "Clint: That happens to a lot of people. The important thing is he kept your name. He was proud to be a Buchanan, he wanted to be a Buchanan.",
        "Kevin: I was -- I was at the monument shop. I think that's what they call it -- \"the monument shop.\" They have models that you can see. Did you know that?",
        "Clint: No.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, and then you can see what your kid's grave is going to look like. I just picked the simplest one -- dark gray, not polished.",
        "Clint: Let me drive you home.",
        "Kevin: No, I got my car.",
        "Clint: That's all right, we can pick it up tomorrow. I can drop you off at, you know, Asa's house, but then I got to go to Lehigh prison because your mother's going to be there tonight.",
        "Kevin: Oh, that's right. Todd's execution's tomorrow, huh?",
        "Clint: And she's leading this protest to keep Todd alive.",
        "Kevin: Huh. I used to worry about that guy so much, you know, always wishing that he would get what was coming to him. Now he's going to die. Look at me -- I got nothing left to worry about. I left Kelly, my two sons are dead.",

Well, she's dead now, and Todd Manning killed her and my nephew who never even got a chance to see the light of day. Let them rest in peace, and let Todd Manning pay for what he did!",
        "Viki: Mrs. Foley -- Mrs. Foley, I understand how you must feel --",
        "Ellen: I hope so. He was your nephew, too.",
        "Viki: Yes, and we both lost him. But taking my brother's life is not going to change that. He's innocent and I don't want to lose him.",
        "Ellen: The way I lost my sister -- because of him?",
        "Dorian: Please excuse me for interrupting, ms. Foley, but many of us here agree with you. Anybody would who is intelligent, objective, rational- thinking. Todd Manning does deserve to die for what he did to your sister and her unborn baby. Let go of me. Let --",

        "Natalie: Do you really think it's such a good idea having the Bangkok police get involved?",
        "John: I can't get through to the prison or anyone else. Maybe the local cops can use emergency channels to get word back that Margaret's still alive.",
        "Margaret: You have no right to keep me here. Just let me go!",
        "John: Sorry, I'm going to bring you back home. A man's going to be executed for murdering you. Don't say anything.",

        "Jack: I want to go home now.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I know, but we -- we can't go. Not until Starr's finished with daddy, ok?",
        "Spencer: I can take him and wait in the car, if it's all right with you.",
        "Blair: That's a good idea.",
        "Spencer: All right, we'll wait for you and Starr in the parking lot?",

        "Viki: You seem to have conveniently forgotten that that woman's sister, Margaret Cochran, tried to kill Blair -- damn near succeeded -- and tried to kill Starr!",
        "Dorian: And Todd. Yeah. But unlike you, I am willing to let my personal feelings be put aside in order to serve what is right. And what is right is that Todd die, be executed for taking the lives of others.",
        "Viki: When did you become an activist, what, like, five minutes ago, when you realized it would hurt me?",
        "Dorian: Oh, it isn't all about you, Viki, even though you would like it to be.",
        "Viki: No, no. I know that you hate Todd, you always have. I'd expect you to give him the lethal injection yourself if they'd let you.",
        "Dorian: An eye for an eye.",
        "Viki: \"An eye for an eye.\" Oh, my goodness, where have I heard that recently? You are so transparent! This is all about you sucking up to Clint. But don't forget that Duke is Clint's grandson, as well. So make sure he never finds out how much you enjoy watching my family die one by one.",
        "Dorian: That's right. They do seem to be dying in rapid succession, each in more disgraceful circumstances than the others.",

        "Starr: Don't say it, Dad, please.",

        "Starr: I don't know what I'm going to do without you. I don't want to say goodbye.",

        "Starr: And you always understand. Mom never does -- like when I got busted.",
        "Todd: When did you get busted?",

        "Todd: Oh, so they busted you for tagging?",
        "Starr: For stealing the spray paint. Are you going to lecture me?",

        "Todd: I don't know. But -- um -- you got to cut her some slack, ok? I think that'll be much easier for both of you.",

        "John: All right.",
        "Officer: Slowly.",
        "John: Ok. See? I'm putting it down. Reason why I have a gun is because I'm a police officer from the United States. I'm going to show you my badge, all right? That's my badge, that's my identification. That's it. Look at it. Now, your English is very good, so just listen to me, hear me out. This man right here is wanted for murder, and this woman is needed back in the United States to stop an execution. Now, we can't get through on any of the phone lines because of the monsoon, so I was hoping that the local authorities, the police might be able to get us through on a secure fax line -- anything. Look at these people, all right? They're not hurt in any way. Now, would I have brought you up here if there was a chance I was lying?",
