        "Margaret's voice: I will always love you.",
        "Todd: No! Margaret! Margaret?",
        "Andrew: Todd? Todd, you're about to be put to death. Do you wish to express any remorse for what you've done?",

        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Blair: Come on in. Thank you for agreeing to watch Starr for me.",
        "Dorian: I'm really honored that you asked me. Oh, sweetheart --",
        "Blair: I -- I -- I have to go. Jack is at a sleepover at Matthew's.",
        "Dorian: Yes, you told me.",
        "Blair: And please don't let Starr watch television or listen to the radio or go anywhere near the Internet while --",
        "Starr: While you watch them kill dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Protesters shout]",
        "Viki: Look, if you could just let the senator know how urgent this is, please -- time is -- oh, I see. Ok, then never mind.",
        "Clint: Here.",
        "Viki: Oh, well --",
        "Clint: Sorry.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Clint: You look exhausted.",
        "Viki: Really? I wonder why. I'm not going home, if that's what you're going to suggest.",
        "Clint: Viki, you've been here over 24 hours. How long can you go without getting some sleep?",
        "Viki: As long as it takes, ok? I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Clint: Did you have any luck with any of your calls?",
        "Viki: Do you know that I have called every single city and state government official I have ever shaken hands with, and no one will help? No. Midterm elections coming up.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I know you're sorry -- for me, not for Todd. Evangeline, has the Governor made a decision?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Battery's dead.",
        "Natalie: I know, mine, too, and I didn't bring my charger. Are you sure you don't want to have the pilot radio for us?",
        "John: He's an ex-pat trying to fly us under the radar, literally. He radioes in, The Department of Homeland Security will be scrambling F-18s to take us out.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Well, this is a pretty -- pretty -- pretty big difference from what we flew out on. Huh.",
        "John: Yeah, it's -- it's a little better than the one that Manning and I took -- the plane that crashed.",
        "Natalie: I guess that's reassuring.",
        "John: Sorry.",
        "Natalie: It's ok. I'm glad I'm with you. I don't want to be anywhere else.",
        "John: Damn.",
        "Natalie: What's wrong?",
        "John: There should be lights out there, towns. We must be flying over Lake Erie.",
        "Natalie: Well, what does that me?",
        "John: Means we're going too slow.",
        "Natalie: Are you saying that --",
        "John: We're running out of time. If we don't land soon --",
        "Natalie: Todd's going to die, for killing someone who's very much alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: Manning, settle down!",
        "Todd: All right, sorry.",
        "Guard: You try anything like that again, you'll be in a straitjacket for the last 60 minutes of your life.",
        "Todd: Ok. I get it.",
        "Andrew: It's all right. There's not going to be any problem.",
        "Todd: You came here looking for remorse? You wasted your trip.",
        "Andrew: I didn't expect you to recant, Todd. I'm not here to -- I'm not here to pass judgment on you. I'm here to -- to explain to you what's going to happen later tonight.",
        "Todd: Yeah, let's hear it.",
        "Andrew: Then they administer the first drug. 50 cc's sodium thiopental. It'll cause you to lose consciousness. Then 50 cc's pancuronium bromide, which paralyzes your voluntary muscles. You stop breathing.",
        "Todd: Enough.",
        "Andrew: I'm sorry, Todd. I'm required to tell you this. It's important that you know. Then 50 cc's of potassium chloride, which stops your heart.",
        "Todd: Then?",
        "Andrew: And --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: We're about a half an hour out.",
        "Natalie: Oh, thank God. Where's the pilot going to land this thing?",
        "John: A little airfield about 20 miles from Lehigh Prison.",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "John: We drive like hell, we should make it in 40, 45 minutes from now.",
        "Natalie: Will that --",
        "John: I don't know.",
        "Natalie: It has to. We have to -- we have to make it in time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: An eye for an eye!",
        "Evangeline: The Governor hasn't called, and he's not answering his phone. I've been calling his office every five minutes for the last three hours.",
        "Viki: And you're getting no response?",
        "Evangeline: Not yet. But there's still time, so we can't give up hope.",
        "[Protesters shout]",
        "Viki: You know what? That is really irritating.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry, Viki. If I could make them stop, I would.",
        "Viki: No, no. Thank God in this country, we have freedom of speech. No, they are entitled to be heard. I mean, her sister was murdered. She has as much right to be here as I do.",
        "Evangeline: As long as there's still the tiniest seed of doubt in the governor's mind, I really think that we have a good shot at getting a stay.",
        "Viki: Evangeline, Harrison's a very political animal. That's why he's got his people out taking polls right now. Which means that my brother's life depends on whether the right people don't mind answering a survey call in the middle of dinner. It is appalling to me that a man's life can be determined by political motivation.",
        "Evangeline: You know, that might not necessarily be the case. I really think that my request to exhume the bodies shook him.",
        "Viki: He does have a conscience, you know, underneath all that posturing. The problem is he doesn't listen to it very often.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Cristian: It's the Governor's office.",
        "Evangeline: My God -- please -- please grant a stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Blood pressure 140/90. Would you like a sedative, Mr. Manning?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Starr, I know you're in a lot of pain, and so am I.",
        "Starr: There's no way you're in pain. You can't wait for this to be over. And I don't need a babysitter. I'm 15, not 4.",
        "Dorian: I'm not here to baby-sit you, I'm here to keep you company.",
        "Starr: I don't want company, either. Especially someone that hates my dad.",
        "Dorian: Whatever I may think of your father, I'm devastated about what's going to happen, because of what it's doing to you and to your mother. I love you both so much. Your mother knows that, and that's why she wants me to stay with you.",
        "Blair: Look, there are sandwiches in the refrigerator, and I want you to have one, ok?",
        "Starr: I'm not hungry.",
        "Blair: Starr -- I love you. You know that? Your brother and you are my world. And you always will be.",
        "Starr: May I be excused?",
        "Blair: Sure. Um -- Dorian, I'll call you, ok?",
        "Dorian: Are you sure that you should go to the prison? It really just seems to me like it's a really masochistic, almost ghoulish thing to do.",
        "Blair: Please -- please, don't do this to me, please.",
        "Dorian: But just know this. I -- I -- I hope and I pray that when this is over, you will be able to move on to -- to the kind of life that you deserve.",
        "Blair: Haven't I gotten that already?",
        "Dorian: Oh, don't you do that. Don't you blame yourself for this. You -- you have loved with all your heart and soul a man. You have given him two gorgeous children. It's not your fault --",
        "Blair: Don't --",
        "Dorian: That he turned out to be a sociopathic killer.",
        "Blair: Don't! Please, don't do this. Now, I doubt if Starr will want to talk about it, but if she does -- if she does, you speak about Todd with respect. Because no matter what you think about him, that man will always be that little girl's father. Always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No sedative. No. I want to be able to -- I want to be able to look at my sister and my wife, and I -- I want to be clearheaded.",
        "Guard: The needle should clear his head permanently, right?",
        "Margaret's voice: You have to feel this. He's kicking. No. You want to feel your son kicking? Come here. Feel him? He's kicking.",
        "Todd: I'm not a baby killer. I'm not a baby killer.",
        "Guard: 60 seconds, that's it.",
        "Evangeline: That's all we need.",
        "Todd: Any word from the governor?",
        "Evangeline: Yes. I just heard. He treats me like a honey bee. The Governor has refused our request for a stay.",
        "Todd: I see, I see.",
        "Evangeline: I'm so sorry, Todd. I let you down.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Guard: No contact, Manning.",
        "Todd: Give me a break. Listen to me. Don't you feel that way. It's not your fault.",
        "Evangeline: I tried really hard to persuade him that -- that if we could just exhume the bodies -- Margaret's and the baby's, you know, we -- I wish there was something else that I could do.",
        "Todd: There is, there is. I want you to never blame yourself for this. You promise.",
        "Evangeline: I promise. And I want you to do something for me.",
        "Todd: Yeah, anything.",
        "Evangeline: See Blair, one last time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Don't even think about it.",
        "Paige: You're not going to hurt me. Especially not here.",
        "Spencer: Maybe. Or maybe I will just dispatch you at a later date.",
        "Paige: Everything's unraveling, isn't it? You're starting to get desperate. When you get desperate, you make mistakes.",
        "Spencer: Let it go, Paige. It's over.",
        "Paige: Yes, it's over. Because I will die before I let them execute Todd for something you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, honey. I really need you. I am so happy you're here.",
        "Adriana: Me, too. So, how's Starr?",
        "Starr: How do you think I am?",
        "Dorian: I thought you were resting.",
        "Starr: My dad is about to die. How can I rest? I'm going to the prison.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no, no, no.",
        "Starr: No, I've already made up my mind. I'm going and you can't change it.",
        "Adriana: Look, Starr, being at the prison while this is happening --",
        "Starr: This is the last few moments of my father's life. If he was sick and dying of some disease, wouldn't you let me go see him?",
        "Dorian: Starr, there's no way the guards would let you in to see him.",
        "Starr: Fine, then I'll wait outside the prison.",
        "Dorian: Outside? With -- with all those people and the press there? It's a terrible idea.",
        "Starr: Fine, if you won't take me, I'll call a cab myself.",
        "Adriana: Starr, look, I understand that you want to be close to your dad --",
        "Starr: I don't care what you think, ok? This is my father, and I want to be with him. Now, is somebody going to take me or not?",
        "Dorian: Grab a jacket. It's chilly out.",
        "Starr: Thank you, Dorian.",

        "Man: Todd Manning!",
        "Bo: You got a bullhorn?",
        "Guard: Yeah.",
        "Reporter: Hey, she's here. Ms. Cramer, how are your kids handling this? Have they said good-bye to their father yet?",
        "Clint: Blair?",
        "Blair: Yeah?",
        "Clint: Leave her alone. Would you just --",
        "Bo: All right, listen up. I want everybody to move back, now. Move back. We're going to have order around here or we'll clear this place.",
        "Viki: How are the children?",
        "Blair: Are you kidding me? You can only imagine how Starr is has there been any progress at all?",
        "Viki: But I have not given up.",
        "Woman: Here's the real killer! You made a mistake!",
        "Reporter: Will you be relieved to see Todd Manning die?",
        "Hugh: Can I have everybody's attention, please? I'd like to make a statement. The Commonwealth felt it had an unshakable case against Todd Manning, and the jury agreed with us.",
        "Woman: No.",
        "Hugh: As for the sentence -- as for the sentence -- the office of the District Attorney does not ask for the death penalty without just cause. So yes, the punishment fits the crime.",
        "Man: Boo!",
        "Hugh: Margaret Cochran and her unborn child were brutally murdered. The D.A.'s office had no choice but to seek the most severe penalty.",
        "Man: Two wrongs don't make a right!",
        "Woman: No!",
        "Man: Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, I can't -- I can't talk to Blair. I can't see her. I -- I still love her, but I -- I just can't forgive her for turning her back on me, and so I don't want to remember her the way we are now. I just -- you understand?",
        "Evangeline: I do. But I just think, Todd, for you to -- for you to leave this world with all -- with all that anger in your heart -- I just -- I don't think --",
        "Guard: You got to get out of here.",
        "Evangeline: We're not done.",
        "Guard: I don't care! I gave you way over a minute.",
        "Evangeline: And we appreciate it. There's still time for the governor to change his mind. Ok? He's granted last-minute stays before. He -- he could do it again. So there's still hope. I mean, let's hold on to that.",
        "Todd: Thank you so much, Evangeline! I can't -- please -- no -- no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margaret: Hey!",
        "David: Stay on your side.",
        "Margaret: What are you going to do with me when this plane lands?",
        "Natalie: Well, first, we're going to save my uncle's life. And then we really haven't thought past that.",
        "Margaret: So you're not going to let me go?",
        "Natalie: I think you need help -- to remember your former life.",
        "Margaret: So you believe me?",
        "Natalie: I -- I believe what I see. You know? I mean, if you -- if you truly blocked out the last year of your life -- I mean, you have a -- you had a whole, entire life.",
        "Margaret: Yeah. I have a million questions.",
        "Natalie: Well, we all do. But the one irrefutable fact is that you're not dead. And my Uncle Todd is going to be executed for killing you. So if we can't get ahold of the local authorities when we're up here in the air, then I guess John's just going to drive you straight to the penitentiary and hand you over to the authorities there, stop Todd's execution.",
        "Margaret: If I'm the one that is going to stop Todd's execution, why are you treating me like a criminal? I mean, I'm just not that important.",
        "Natalie: Oh, you are. You're that important to my Uncle Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andrew: It's time, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margaret: I can't wait for this to be over. God. It's very stressful for me, you know.",
        "David: Feeling stressed, are you?",
        "John: Shut it.",
        "David: It's been such a day at the spa for the rest of us.",
        "John: I said shut it.",
        "Natalie: John, you've done everything you could. If we don't get there on time, it's not your fault.",
        "John: I don't want Manning's blood on my hands. You know, when we started this, I didn't want you here. I didn't want you with me. But I just -- I just went along. I just want you to know that you really came through for me.",
        "Natalie: We came through for each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: You mean you would sacrifice your life for a known criminal like Todd? I mean, Paige, what's the point? He's going to be dead in an hour. You know, I think I'm going to pop over there. I don't want to miss the big event.",
        "Paige: You're going to the prison?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, sure. Why not? I think Blair's going to need me, don't you?",
        "Paige: You made her think she needs you. You've destroyed her family. He's going to die because you couldn't keep your hands off his wife.",
        "Spencer: Ex-wife. They're not married. Well, don't want to be late for the command performance. See ya.",
        "Paige: You are sicker than I thought.",
        "Spencer: Oh, come on, Paige. Don't be that way. Just because you missed out on your chance at love, you know? Oh, but then again, that seems to be the story of your life, doesn't it?",
        "Paige: Not anymore.",

        "Viki: Thank you. Tell me something. How will you live with yourself when the wrong man is put to death tonight?",
        "Hugh: Todd Manning is not the wrong man. I truly, truly believe that.",

        "Starr: Not all the time.",
        "Viki: Oh, baby. Your father is so proud of you. He lights up every time your name is mentioned. He always tells me that you inherited the very best of him. His humor and his energy and his loyalty.",
