        "Gigi and Rex go to a vacant house in their search for his parents and find a cradle with the river symbol engraved on it. Rex finds a stack of love letters to \"Lily\" from \"Rick.\" The last letter says that Rick doesn't love Lily anymore. Gigi observes that the letter doesn't sound like the same person wrote it. She thinks there has to be more to the story.",
        "Cristian goes with Ford to the hospital after finding him beaten at their apartment. Markko is there having his hand looked at, so Cristian tells him what happened. Cristian says he had to tell the police about how angry Markko was at Ford for sleeping with Langston. John explains to Dorian that it appears that someone tried to beat Ford to death with one of his awards and that he wants to talk to Langston. Meanwhile, Langston tells Blair about the way her affair with Ford ended. When Blair tells her that Ford will get what's coming to him, Langston says he already has. Dorian goes home and tells Blair and Langston that someone tried to kill Ford. Jessica tells Natalie that she has her memory back and apologizes for accusing her of stealing her man. She asks her about getting back together with John so Natalie recounts the events of last night, carefully omitting the part where she slept with Brody. Natalie asks Jessica what triggered her memory returning, but Jessica omits the part about sleeping with Ford. When Jessica says that she owes Layla and Cristian an apology, Natalie suggests that they go over there, but Jessica abruptly says she can't go over there. Jessica turns on the TV and sees the news story about Ford. Cristian tells Markko that he looks guilty hanging around the hospital with an injured hand. He tells him to go home and call Tea because he will need a lawyer whether he did it or not. Meanwhile, At Todd's arraignment, Tea asks the judge to drop all charges against Todd. The judge determines that the prosecution has enough evidence for the case to proceed. Todd calls one of his sources and discovers that Hanna has disappeared. When the elevator that Markko is waiting for at the hospital opens, John is on it."

        "Natalie: Exactly. Exactly, and that's what's most important.",

        "Natalie: Don't.",

        "John: Well, not yet, but we will.",

        "Markko: Barely. They took him off to the operating rooms. What happened to him?",
        "Cristian: Someone hit him over the head with one of his awards. I don't even know how long he was there bleeding. We found him this morning.",
        "Markko: It's a miracle he's still alive. That's what one of the nurses said.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. Look, man, I'm sorry about what happened with Ford, but he's alone, no family, so I had to be here.",

        "Blair: I know you did. We all mean it when we say it at the time. It's just sticking with it that's the hard part.",
        "Langston: So pathetic. Every time I would try to break up with him...",
        "Blair: He would come up with some line to make you believe that he cared about you, or did he make you feel, like, childish and stupid for doubting him?",
        "Langston: How did you know?",
        "Blair: Oh, sweetie, I know the kind. They'll say anything, do anything to get you to come back for more. So come on--what exactly happened last night? Did he break it off with you?",

        "John: Yeah, but she was cheating on him with this guy Ford.",
        "Dorian: How dare--ahem. How dare you slander my daughter that way? I do not want a word of what he has said to go anywhere outside of this room. Is that understood, gentlemen? I will take your names and your badge numbers before you leave here.",

        "Natalie: No. No, no, no, no, no. No, not at all.",
        "Jessica: Come on, Natalie. I acted like you had stolen Cristian from me and then I accused you of trying to steal John from Marty. I treated you like dirt. But please, let me make it up to you.",
        "Natalie: Jess, you have nothing to apologize for.",
        "Jessica: Well, then, talk to me. I have missed you, too, okay? I want to know everything about last night. I want to know everything about you and John.",

        "Lilli: Constancy. The constant heart.",
        "Rick: Why is it broken?",
        "Lilli: Not broken. The heart is complete...when the two pieces are together. You give one half to the person you're meant for when you feel love that is unwavering.",

        "T\u00e9a: The state's case is a tissue of innuendo, fueled by the district attorney's personal and long-standing vendetta against my client. Let's start with the so-called forensic evidence.",
        "Nora: I assure the court the fibers are very real.",
        "T\u00e9a: And also very common. This particular blend of cashmere silk was produced in Italy last winter, and sold in 25 department stores across the country. This particular shade of navy was the most popular and used in literally thousands of garments.",
        "Nora: One of which is a blue jacket that the defendant was wearing the day of the attack.",
        "T\u00e9a: The prosecution can't tell us when the fibers were left in the stairwell. For all we know, they could've been there for months. Secondly, the prosecution alludes to a long history of animosity between my client and Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "Nora: This is hardly what you'd call bad feelings. I think it is well known--",
        "T\u00e9a: There is one prior, ancient conviction that would be totally inadmissible in a court of law as a prior bad act.",
        "Nora: But the argument immediately preceding the attack will be admissible.",
        "T\u00e9a: Which one?",
        "Nora: Excuse me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Which one? Dr. Saybrooke not only had words with my client. Dr. Saybrooke had a loud, heated argument with Natalie Banks just prior to her accident. In fact, the first person, the first person that Dr. Saybrooke accused of the crime was Natalie Banks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: No, I didn't make it to London and I didn't do anything stupid.",
        "Roxy: So what exactly happened?",
        "Jessica: Well, that's what I've been trying to find out.",
        "Roxy: Sweetie, this is kind of grownup talk, so maybe you should just kind of go away and text and tweet for a while.",
        "Natalie: Actually, Jessica is recovered. She recovered her memories. Isn't that great?",
        "Roxy: I guess.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. And I'm really excited. I want to hear all about you and Brody.",
        "Jessica: Natalie. You first.",
        "Roxy: Hey, Natty, come on. You know, she was gonna hightail it to London and I got her to take one more shot at Johnny.",
        "Jessica: What did you do?",
        "Natalie: I wrote a letter to John and told him exactly how I felt.",
        "Roxy: Yes, and in this letter, she said, \"If you feel the same way that I do, meet me at midnight,\" you know, yadda, yadda, yadda. Of course, Johnny blew it and, you know, it didn't happen. And I said, \"You should look for him, just one more time, just to be sure.\"",
        "Natalie: Yeah, big mistake.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, because it didn't go quite how you thought. Marty was kissing on Johnny.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. You must've been so upset. What did you do?",
        "Roxy: You know, if it were me, I would've jumped into bed with the first thing that had broad shoulders and chest hair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Have a look at the sink. We need to undo the drain. We have statements from 2 people about the affair.",
        "Dorian: There was no affair, John, and I would thank you to stop using that word. What was going on is this--this Robert Ford was sniffing after my very, very young and naive daughter.",
        "John: So you knew about it.",
        "Dorian: I heard about it this morning, so I came straight over here to warn him to stay away from her.",
        "John: Too late.",
        "Dorian: Well, he's a dead man now. Because when I get through with him--",
        "Langston: Don't even think about it. Besides, it's too late.",
        "Dorian: Yes, it is too late.",
        "John: We're gonna need to talk to Langston.",
        "Dorian: No! John, you are not to drag her into this mess.",
        "John: She's already in it.",
        "Dorian: Any number of people must've wanted this guy dead.",

        "Langston: I lied to Markko. I lied to Starr. I lied to Cole. The only person I didn't lie to was Ford.",
        "Blair: Let me guess. He lied to you.",
        "Langston: He was sleeping with the pizza girl. Yeah. I walked in on them.",
        "Blair: Langston, please tell me that you broke it off with him. Please tell me you did.",
        "Langston: He convinced me that he was only doing it because he was lonely and because he was just so upset thinking about Markko and me and--I was ready to forgive him. And you know what? I actually let him kiss me. And that's when Markko walked in.",
        "Blair: Oh, no.",
        "Langston: It was awful. Markko broke up with me. He took a swing at Ford and then he left, and that's--that's when Ford dumped me. [Scoffs]",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Langston: Yeah. I gave up everything and everyone in my life for him, and Ford didn't even care. He never even gave a damn about me.",
        "Blair: I'm sorry, Langston. I'm so sorry.",
        "Langston: I hate him. I hope he's in hell right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I had to get my hand checked.",
        "Cristian: What happened?",
        "Markko: I broke those plates, and then I punched some walls. Really stupid. So when I woke up this morning, I couldn't move my fingers, so I came here. And after the doctor was done working on me, they brought Ford in. So you found him?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Layla and I did. She's a mess. We thought he was dead. He looked dead.",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: We called the cops and we had to give statements. Markko, we had to tell them about--about how mad you were at Ford.",

        "T\u00e9a: Dr. Saybrooke stuck by her conviction that Natalie Banks was her attacker until officer Brody Lovett encouraged her to remember her conversation with my client and throw the blame on him.",
        "Nora: I doubt the victim needed reminding about who this attacker was.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course she didn't. Good point. Because here we have Llanview's favorite scapegoat. Whenever there's an unsolved crime or Marty Saybrooke runs into any trouble, which, it should be said, happens with some frequency, her good friend Lieutenant John McBain, and no fan of Todd Manning's, points the finger directly at my client.",
        "Nora: We have an eyewitness with no axe to grind.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, Miss Hannah O'Connor is a troubled young girl who is in love with Starr Manning's boyfriend Cole Thornhart. She's using the story she concocted to try to drive a wedge between Miss Manning and Mr. Thornhart.",
        "Nora: Unbelievable.",
        "Starr: No, it's true, Your Honor.",
        "Judge Shriver: You're out of order, young lady.",
        "Starr: Please. Hannah is lying to break us up.",
        "Judge Shriver: Sit quietly or you'll be removed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, there is evidence that Miss O'Connor is unstable.",
        "Judge Shriver: You have an offer to proffer, or am I supposed to listen to outbursts from the gallery?",
        "T\u00e9a: Absolutely not. Miss O'Connor tried to commit suicide when someone tried to break up with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What did you do when you saw John and Marty kissing?",
        "Natalie: I had a drink or 2. Or 4. And then I went by to see Brody to tell him that I was leaving, and then I went to the airport.",
        "Roxy: Oh, you know, I forgot to mention, it was a good-bye kiss. So I go over to Rodi's and I see Johnny and I sent him right over to the airport.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, John found me at the airport.",
        "Roxy: Were you just hanging out there waiting for your flight?",
        "Natalie: I--I missed my flight.",
        "Roxy: So you were just staying there all night?",
        "Natalie: You know, I just--I figured that I could catch a later flight, so John found me at the airport. We're back together. End of story. But meanwhile, Jessica got her memories back.",

        "Jessica: Wait.",
        "Natalie: No, Jessica, no. Do you know how long we've waited for you to recover?",

        "Jessica: We both are. And Bree is, too.",
        "Roxy: Well, if Viki ain't gonna throw you a party, I'll do it. What was it, Jess?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, you never-- you never told us what triggered your memories.",
        "Roxy: You know, I bet it was that hunk love-it. Tighty dress whites. Did he open up the Watergates for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: If this guy Ford had any enemies, maybe Langston knows who they are.",
        "Dorian: I doubt that very much.",
        "John: We just want to talk to her.",
        "Dorian: John...please? I'm asking you to leave my daughter out of this.",
        "John: It'll be discreet.",
        "Dorian: I don't want my daughter's name even mentioned, no, whispered in connection with this crime. And if I do, so help me, I'm going to the police commissioner. Excuse me.",

        "Langston: How? How do I live with what I've done?",
        "Blair: Listen. Langston, you made a mistake. It was a mistake. You wanted so much to believe everything that Ford told you. But listen to me, sweetheart. You gotta forgive yourself. Forgive yourself. I'm telling you now Markko is gonna heal, things'll get back to normal with Cole and Starr and-- you have to trust me on this one, that Ford is gonna get what's coming to him.",
        "Langston: He already has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Cristian: No.",

        "Judge Shriver: I agree.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, there is no time for a trial. It would be a waste of the taxpayers' money and of the court's time. First of all, there is no conclusive physical evidence in this case. Second of all, Dr. Saybrooke argued with several people before her accident. All we have is one troubled girl with an ulterior motive who, I guarantee you, would not stand up 5 minutes under cross-examination. That's all the evidence we have that a crime occurred at all. Dr. Saybrooke did not see who pushed her. All we have is Dr. Saybrooke's word, her--her impression, her hazy memory after a painful physical ordeal and an intense emotional loss, that she was in fact pushed at all. It is entirely possible, in fact probable, that this was a tragic accident, Your Honor.",
        "Nora: Well, I would welcome a trial where the defense tried to sell that.",

        "Lilli: Can't he just get more time to pay?",
        "Rick: You don't negotiate with these guys. They will kill him if we don't pony up.",

        "Rick: It's not. It's my dad. But I have to help him. The second it's over, I will be back here, and I'll never leave again.",

        "Detective: So what's the move? You want to get the girl before she gets her story?",
        "John: Nah, it's probably too late for that. We have to have the answers before we approach her, so what we do is we just work the case like we normally would. We get everything we can before we can go there. I don't think she's the first suspect, anyway.",

        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Markko: And that bastard took her away from me just for the fun of it. The whole thing was just a game to him. He didn't give a damn about Langston. All he cared about was winning.",

        "Jessica: No. I...was spying on them. I saw the whole thing.",
        "Natalie: Jess, that must have been really awful. I'm sorry. That must've been really hard for you. Is that what triggered your memories?",
        "Jessica: That--I want that to be one of the things that I forget, you know? I owe Cristian and Layla a huge apology.",
