        "Nash: That's not going to happen.",

        "Nash: Claudia followed me here. It wasn't exactly my idea to --",
        "George: Yeah, but it's your problem. See, my daughter can decide to live anywhere she wants. And wherever she decides to live, believe me, you want to live somewhere else.",
        "Nash: This is crazy.",
        "George: I wouldn't use that word about my daughter, not after what you did to her.",
        "Nash: As a matter of fact, mr. Reston, I was referring to you. Don't you think that this whole devoted father thing is going just a little bit over the top?",
        "George: You leave town and get out of my daughter's life, or your daughter's going to have to pay the consequences.",
        "Nash: Now, there you go threatening my daughter again.",

        "Reporter: You want to say something, Starr?",
        "Starr: Yes. Spencer Truman is a creep, and he wants my father to die so that he can be with my mother.",

        "Reporter: You want this story told, don't you, Starr?",
        "Starr: Yes. Want people to know what he's like. He pretended to be our friend, but he was lying! He was lying the whole time, just because he wants my mother.",
        "Dorian: Let's stop now, ok?",
        "Starr: No! You hate my dad, too. But it doesn't matter, does it? My father is a good man. And no one understands that!",
        "Man: Your father didn't want that baby to be born.",
        "Second man: That's why he killed the mother.",

        "Natalie: Ok, don't listen to her. Do you know who she is? She's Margaret Cochran.",
        "Security guard: Look, I don't care if she's Madonna. My job is to get you to the cops and let them sort it all out. Now, hand over that piece.",
        "John: All right, all right. Take it easy. I'm putting my stuff down. Got it? There go the gun. Now, if you just let me show you my badge, everything will be all right. You got it? Go ahead, have a look. Go ahead.",

        "Claudia: What phone call?",
        "Nash: You and I both know that you play your dad like a poker hand and a stacked deck of cards. Come on, you put him up to it.",
        "Claudia: What? What did he say? Did he threaten you?",
        "Nash: No, he's tried that. He threatened my little girl.",

That's why I'm here. I wish I would have learned more from you. I'm -- I'm not going to be able to -- I'm not going to be able to see my children, so I -- I hope that you'll look after them for me. And you teach them how important it is to be like you. You're so strong, and you love so many people. Don't -- don't let them forget how much I love them. Evangeline -- oh, God. Thank you so much for everything. Don't cry, don't cry. Don't cry, dear. I know I haven't made things easy for you. But I have to tell you -- You were more than my lawyer.
