        "Guard: Can I help you?",
        "Marty: I'd like to see David Vickers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: All we know for sure, Mr. Mayor, is that the arsons and the attempted murders at Cristian Vega's studio were committed by a member, or members, of a white supremacist group called one pure people.",
        "Mayor: You've known this for weeks?",
        "Bo: No, not for certain. The only strong link we had between the incidents and this group was a medallion that was found at D.A. Hanen's house.",
        "John: We re-examined the forensics photos from all the other sites. This symbol appeared in every one of them.",
        "Mayor: And you didn't catch this before?",
        "John: Maybe you'd like to suit up and work the crime scene with us next time.",
        "Bo: The -- the point is that now we have proof that all the incidents were linked.",
        "Mayor: They're leaving their calling card and laughing at us.",
        "John: That's why they got sloppy. They couldn't resist taking credit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey. Missed you last night. Something wrong?",
        "Adriana: Do you even have to ask?",
        "Rex: Adriana, what's going on?",
        "Adriana: How could you do this, Rex? After you promised me, how could you do this to us?",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on, Antonio, come on. Where the hell are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Exacto. Y para postre, el flan de la anilla. Si, gracias. Oh, gracias. Hmm. How's my best little girl?",
        "Jamie: Good.",
        "Antonio: Yeah? Have you thought about what you want to do after we go shopping?",
        "Jamie: I want to go home to Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Any word from Antonio?",
        "Viki: No. Cristian and Carlotta keep calling him. He doesn't answer. I mean, I -- it's -- I don't know. He and Jamie have vanished.",
        "Michael: Bo can't track him down?",
        "Clint: Well, he's doing everything he can. Antonio's a cop, too. He knows exactly how to disappear.",
        "Viki: Damn, I wish Jessica and Nash hadn't done this now.",
        "Michael: Oh, I think it's important to say, we have Jessica on a very heavy regimen of chemotherapy and ethanol injections.",
        "Clint: Yeah. We talked about that.",
        "Michael: And since we've moved her to the ICU, she is receiving the best possible around-the-clock care. I am still very, very hopeful --",
        "Viki: Michael, not without a transplant. Come on, you moved her here because she's dying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: How's my old lady? You always tell her not to come visit me on the inside, but you know broads. Say, you think you could check to see if the conjugal room's been wiped down?",
        "Guard: Three-month waiting list. You know the drill.",
        "David: Hasenfeffer.",
        "Marty: Hello, David.",
        "David: I thought I told you never to come see me in here, Mandy.",
        "Marty: Marty.",
        "David: Subterfuge -- I'm good at it. I hope you can keep up. I told you I'm not in love with you anymore, Marny! Did Dorian tell you to come take more blood?",
        "Marty: Excuse me?",
        "David: You're not going to start sobbing again, are you, Melanie? What are you doing here? You already shrunk me back in Llanview.",
        "Marty: I want to know why you confessed to killing Spencer Truman when you didn't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We traced the O.P.P. calling card to a chapter in Wyoming.",
        "Mayor: Tell me you got fingerprints.",
        "John: The fire took care of that.",
        "Bo: We do have people combing travel records between Wyoming and Llanview from around the time of the arsons.",
        "Mayor: Well, isn't that a long shot? I mean, the guy could have driven.",
        "Bo: No, well, we're going to check easy pass. We check for speeding tickets.",
        "John: That's the job. We follow every lead till we catch a break.",
        "Mayor: Catch it soon. My town's being terrorized. I want it stopped, now.",
        "Bo: As you know, Detective McBain was one of the bureau's finest investigators, and he'll be heading the task force on this case.",
        "Mayor: I thought Detective Vega was working the investigation.",
        "Bo: Detective Vega's on a leave of absence. His wife is ill.",
        "Mayor: Probably for the best. Bad idea to have one of the victims on the case. I -- I didn't mean the wife's illness --",
        "Bo: She's my niece.",
        "Mayor: I'm sorry. I'll keep her in my prayers. I'll tell you what we're going to do. I'm going to contact D.O.J., have them send out a C.R.S. team. It's done, Commissioner. It was far too easy for the first victim's lawyer to grab a mike and claim this department was biased.",
        "John: And we handled that.",
        "Mayor: Keep me posted. And if there's any good news, I want a press conference. People need to know we're doing something.",
        "John: Eh -- thanks for coming down, mayor. It's been swell. The guy risked our whole damn investigation just to get a couple votes.",
        "Bo: I want us to just stay focused on this Wyoming connection. It's going to break. I can feel it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Come on in, Miles. You can take a seat.",
        "Miles: Thank you.",
        "Hannah: So, you are in the market for a new therapist? You mind if I ask why?",
        "Miles: I just want to try someone different.",
        "Hannah: Fine. So, what specifically did you want to talk about?",
        "Miles: A woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: So you have been talking to Dorian? Huh. Just not about liver snatching.",
        "Marty: I haven't spoken to Dorian about you. What does she have to do with this anyway?",
        "David: She doesn't think that I killed Spencer, either, even though I did.",
        "Marty: And what made her suspicious?",
        "David: One woman's suspicions are another woman's abiding love. It means she's still attracted to me. She just -- you know, it kills her to see me in here -- in this.",
        "Marty: Uh-huh.",
        "David: So if you haven't been talking to Dorian, what makes you think I didn't kill Spencer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What exactly do you think I did?",
        "Adriana: Do you miss this?",
        "Rex: Oh, gee, thanks. I thought I lost it.",
        "Adriana: At your meeting with Rob Dalton? He called. At least show me a little respect and tell me the truth, now that you're caught.",
        "Rex: Ok, first of all, I need you to know that I do what I do for you, to protect you.",
        "Adriana: By lying to my face?",
        "Rex: No --",
        "Adriana: That's protecting me?",
        "Rex: It's not a lie, not the way you think.",
        "Adriana: You said you weren't looking into Tate's past anymore, and you still are. There's nothing to find, Rex.",
        "Rex: Yes, there is.",
        "Adriana: No, there isn't. When are you going to get it through your thick skull that Tate is just a normal guy? You're the one that's hiding things, not him. Why can't you just let it go?",
        "Rex: I know you like to see the good side of people, but there is something off with this guy, I'm sure of it.",
        "Adriana: You're losing it.",
        "Rex: No, I 'm not. I'm perfectly fine, and --",
        "Adriana: You know how much it upsets me when you keep things from me, and yet, you do it anyway, after you promised me that you wouldn't!",
        "Rex: Look, what am I supposed to do? I know in my gut this guy is hiding something, something that could hurt you. Now, I can't let that happen. I love you too much --",
        "Adriana: Oh, don't say that.",
        "Rex: I do. And you love me, too. I was going to tell you.",
        "Adriana: When?",
        "Rex: When I had proof. Because I knew you wouldn't believe me without it.",
        "Adriana: Can you blame me?",
        "Rex: No. I've blown it enough times, ok, but I'm -- I'm sure about Tate. And if I didn't know about it before, I knew it the minute I met his dad. There is something up with those two, I'm sure of it.",
        "Adriana: So you're not going to stop, are you?",
        "Rex: No, I can't, I'm sorry.",
        "Adriana: No, you're not. You're just sorry that you got caught.",
        "Rex: Damn it, Adriana, why can't you just trust me?",
        "Adriana: Oh! Wait a minute. Now it's my fault?",
        "Rex: No. No -- it -- I didn't mean it the way it sounded, ok? It's just I'm so sure about one thing, you're so sure about another. And I thought that I'd have the proof I needed by now, and then it wouldn't matter that I kept it from you.",
        "Adriana: It does matter, Rex! First, without even telling me anything, you go and make Tate's private life into a public spectacle. And then when you find out you were wrong about that, you just keep on digging knowing how much it upset me. You begged me not to break up with you if you would stop, and I actually believed that you meant it, but you didn't. And now, I wonder if anything you said was true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Jessica is not going to die. She could start responding to treatment, or we could find Antonio.",
        "Michael: The fact of the matter is, Jessica's liver is failing. Obviously, we want to do the transplant, stat.",
        "Viki: Well, I am still a viable donor.",
        "Michael: Absolutely not, Viki.",
        "Clint: Viki, we are not there yet. I mean, Natalie -- she's using all her police contacts to try and track down Antonio. Bo, John -- they're doing the same thing.",
        "Viki: Natalie -- Natalie still has the flu. She can't even come and see her.",
        "Michael: Oh, Natalie's doing the right thing. You know, the risk of cross- infection right now is greater than it ever has been.",
        "Viki: Cristian, did you find Antonio?",
        "Cristian: No, Mrs. Davidson. He's still not answering his phone, but I'm going to keep trying.",
        "Michael: Let me know as soon as you guys hear anything, ok?",
        "Clint: Yeah, we will. Will do.",
        "Cristian: Look, guys, I know this -- this has got to be weird. Antonio being the donor after everything that's happened.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Well, nobody could have predicted what happened between Jessie and Antonio --",
        "Cristian: You don't have to explain. What happened between Nash and Jessica wasn't your fault.",
        "Viki: No, it wasn't, but Antonio is furious, and he has every right to be.",
        "Cristian: I know my brother, and he's hurt, and you're right -- he's very angry, but he's going to do whatever it takes to -- to help Jessica survive this.",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Cristian: I guarantee you. It's her life we're talking about.",
        "Viki: Well, none of this makes any difference at all if we don't find him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: And you know how you always tell me you want to be like Dora the Explorer? With Senor Papi as your trusty guide? Barcelona is the first stop on our big adventure. And we're going to have a great time, you and me, together.",
        "Jamie: Can't we go home, then come back with Jessica?",
        "Antonio: No. We can't. I know it's hard for you. It's hard for me, too. Ok? But this is about you and me. Ok? We're going to have to get used to no more -- no more Bree and no more Jessica.",
        "Jamie: Why?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Antonio: I want -- that must be our driver. I'm -- I'm coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, Adriana, I know I lied, but I did it for a good reason.",
        "Adriana: This is not like the Tommy thing. It makes no sense that we can trust each other about that, but then something as stupid as Tate has us lying and fighting. It's not worth this.",
        "Rex: Look, it's like Bo said. My gut tells me there's something hinky about this. Look, I need to see this through. Now, if it turns out that I'm wrong about this, I will never be so happy to be wrong about anything in my entire life, because it means that you're safe.",
        "Adriana: That sounds like my mother's reasoning.",
        "Rex: Ouch.",
        "Adriana: My mother had me raised by other people because she thought it was best for me. But I would give anything to have those years back, to be normal. And you feel the same way about Roxy and Natalie. You told me that. They took away our choices. And now, you're trying to do the exact same thing. Don't I for once get a say in my own life?",
        "Rex: Well, I don't know what to do. I love you, and I don't want to see you hurt.",
        "Adriana: You've hurt me, by undermining something that's really important to me.",
        "Rex: You're important to me.",
        "Adriana: Not enough, apparently.",
        "Rex: That isn't true!",
        "Adriana: Oh, true? Sorry if I'm a little fuzzy on that concept at the moment.",
        "Rex: Ok -- damn it! Stop arguing with me on this. The only thing that matters is that we love each other.",
        "Adriana: No.",
        "Rex: What, you don't love me? Now, that would be a lie.",
        "Adriana: I can't love you, Rex.",
        "Rex: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Adriana: It means it's over. We're over, for good this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I want any Wyoming newspaper articles you can find on this camp, all right? I don't care if it's a fluff piece -- I want it. It's going to be tedious as hell, but -- officer: If it gives us a name, it's more than worth it.",
        "John: You're a good man. Hey, I thought you'd left. You'll be late for your happy ending.",
        "Mayor: I have a few more questions about the investigation.",
        "John: Well, the commissioner's in a meeting.",
        "Mayor: That's fine. I'll talk to you.",
        "Officer: Lieutenant McBain?",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Officer: Call on line two.",
        "John: Thank you. McBain.",
        "Guard: This is Arnold at Statesville.",
        "John: Hey, Arnold. David Vickers get any visitors?",
        "Arnold: Two in the past 24 hours. First there was a Dorian Lord.",
        "John: Yeah, it figures. Who was the second?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Let's just say you don't strike me as the violent type.",
        "David: Well, you should see the other guy. Oh, that's right, you can't, because he's dead.",
        "Marty: You didn't kill your brother, David.",
        "David: You know, Marty, there is an old saying that goes \"motive plus opportunity equals the means to scissor-stab someone in a hospital.\" And if for any reason, that's not clear to you, you can check out the digital photo from the surveillance cam. Or maybe even my signed confession. I think it was the signed confession that really sealed it.",
        "Marty: Yeah, you know, in addition to being a psychiatrist, I'm also a trained profiler.",
        "David: You should wear a cape and solve crimes.",
        "Marty: You don't have the guts to kill someone.",
        "David: Then you don't know me as well as you think you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Being that you're all right with my recording the session, I'd like to just put in a fresh tape. If I can find --",
        "Miles: Take your time.",
        "Hannah: All right. So, where would you like to begin?",
        "Miles: I guess we should start from the beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Is Nash back? Did he find Antonio?",
        "Viki: No, darling, not yet. But you know what? There's plenty of time.",
        "Jessica: Don't lie to me, mom.",
        "Clint: Jessie, we need you to hang in there. The doctors are doing everything possible.",
        "Viki: Uh -- are you in pain, darling? I mean, there's no reason for you to be uncomfortable.",
        "Jessica: Uh-uh. Drugs started all this.",
        "Viki: No, honey, they didn't.",
        "Clint: Jess, you shouldn't talk too much.",
        "Viki: You know, sweetheart, Cristian's here. And he -- and he wants to see you. Would that be all right?",
        "Clint: Ok.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Cristian, I'm so sorry.",
        "Cristian: Jess, stop, stop.",
        "Jessica: Sorry --",
        "Cristian: Stop. Listen, none of that matters, ok? We're going to find Antonio. And you're going to beat this.",
        "Viki: Clint?",
        "Clint: Yeah?",
        "Viki: What if Cristian's wrong? What if Antonio is so angry that he refuses to help us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I don't have time for this. Hello, Jamie.",
        "Jamie: Is Jessica with you?",
        "Nash: No, she isn't, sweetie.",
        "Antonio: Mija, why don't you go into the other room and watch one of those DVDs you brought, ok? I promise I won't be long.",
        "Jamie: Ok, daddy.",
        "Antonio: Ok? Give me a kiss. All right. Get out before I call security.",
        "Nash: Can't do that.",
        "Antonio: How the hell did you find me?",
        "Nash: I broke into your apartment. I found the passwords to your credit cards.",
        "Antonio: Son of a bitch. You took my wife. What else do you want?",
        "Nash: I need you to save your wife's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You are a vain, lazy opportunist who charms his way into people's lives and then blames everyone around him for his failures. How am I doing?",
        "David: Wow, I went my entire life without being self-aware. Thanks for bringing that to a screeching halt.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Yeah, see? There you go -- blaming me for pointing out your flaws.",
        "David: Flaws? I only have one flaw, Marty. Singular. You see that? That's where Spencer pushed me off my banana-seat bike. I know it's hard to see, but it's there. Oh, it's there.",
        "Marty: You didn't kill Spencer.",
        "David: I shot at a police officer when I was 15 years old.",
        "Marty: Yeah, but you didn't kill him, your brother did. Look, he is a cold- blooded murderer, not you.",
        "David: Ok. You got me. I'm innocent. I just like hanging around here to play hopscotch with other men. That's not prison slang for something. We actually play hopscotch out in the prison yard.",
        "Marty: Why are you here, David?",
        "David: You know what, Marty? The real question is, why are you here? Wait a second. Wait a cotton-picking second. You're the guilty one, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Mayor: I was talking to you, Detective.",
        "John: Lieutenant.",
        "Mayor: You work for me, capisce? And my time is a damn sight more important than yours, so whatever you have to do can wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I keep this to remind me of how much Spencer Truman helped me. He gave me a new life.",
        "Hannah: Well, being that you've been out in the world a while now, how does your life feel?",
        "Miles: What's there not to like?",
        "Hannah: Well, you said you were here because of a woman.",
        "Miles: That's the one thing that's not really working out for me.",
        "Hannah: How so?",
        "Miles: She just wants to be friends.",
        "Hannah: Hmm. And you're having trouble accepting that?",
        "Miles: I can't accept it. I won't.",
        "Hannah: What do you mean?",
        "Miles: I'm going to make her love me, no matter what it takes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: No, don't do this, Adriana, not again.",
        "Adriana: I can't take this anymore, Rex. Any trust that we've ever had -- it's broken, and we can't get it back.",
        "Rex: Look, if you are completely anti-lie, you would have ratted out Michael and Marcie, given Tommy back to Todd, because that's technically the honest thing.",
        "Adriana: This is not a philosophical fight, Rex, this is about us! I asked you not to do something. You said you wouldn't and you went and did it anyway! How am I supposed to trust you after that?",
        "Rex: Look, I'm sorry. I really am.",
        "Adriana: But are you going to stop? I didn't think so.",
        "Rex: Ok, look, if I back off and something happens to you, I won't be able to live with myself. Please understand that.",
        "Adriana: I do. Because I can't live with this.",
        "Rex: So, what is this? You leave me and go to Tate? Is this just a way to clear the path for that lying son of a bitch?",
        "Adriana: I have loved you so much that I thought my heart might burst. But I look at you now and I don't even know who you are anymore.",
        "Rex: You know me. Adriana, I am the guy who loves you, the guy who would do anything to keep anything bad from ever happening to you.",
        "Adriana: No, don't do that.",
        "Rex: What, I can't even touch you now?",

        "Rex: All I want to do is hold you until the day I die.",
        "Adriana: I can't -- I can't let you do that. If I do, we'll just go right back to the same thing over and over again. And I can't do it anymore, Rex.",

        "Marty: Oh, why would you say I'm guilty?",
        "David: Spencer would never have escaped from the hospital and done all those things that he did if you didn't testify that he was crazy.",
        "Marty: He was crazy. He needed psychiatric help.",
        "David: The only help that my brother needed was the help that he got -- at the business end of a pair of scissors.",
        "Marty: I know you hated him.",
        "David: Hate is something that you feel for someone who's too beautiful. Come to think of it, I get that a lot.",
        "Marty: How can you sit here and crack jokes?",
        "David: What do you want me to do? Spencer is dead. I planned it, I dreamt it, and I did it. I stabbed him, with scissors -- and not the little kind with rounded edges that kids use, but the long, pointy kind, and now that bastard is burning in hell.",
        "Marty: Yeah, that's all fine, but you didn't do it.",
        "David: You keep saying that.",
        "Marty: You know, I'm -- I'm trying to understand why you confessed to a crime you didn't commit.",
        "David: Do you like to flirt with felons? Because it's pretty clear you're coming on to me.",
        "Marty: You know, and -- and given the way you lived your life, there's only one motive that I can think of -- money.",
        "David: Do I look rich to you?",
        "Marty: Not yet. I knew that there was something more to this.",

        "Hannah: Well --",
        "Miles: Look, if I could get some insight into her, get inside her head, I'll figure out what makes her tick. I know I could convince her that we would be good together.",

        "Nash: Antonio, if you'd listen to me --",
        "Antonio: Jessica rejected her and she still wanted to help, you know, but she can't and neither can I. Now, get out before I call security.",

        "Bo: By investigating him?",
        "Rex: I kind of called everyone I could think of who might spill Tate's dirty little secret, up to and including his dad. I guess I stopped seeing the forest for the trees.",

        "Bo: \"Crumbs\" -- I thought you said that you didn't find out anything.",
        "Rex: Practically. All I got was some high school friend of Tate's who said that his dad took him to a fancy camp in Wyoming when he was a kid. The friend went on and on about how Tate came back from the camp changed, whatever that means.",
