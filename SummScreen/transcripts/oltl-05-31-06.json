        "Bo: Just shut up, Vickers!",
        "Bo: Okay. Margaret, you had a baby, but now, nobody seems to know where that baby is. Now, it's a possibility that the person who delivered the baby might know. That's why you have to remember -- it's for the baby.",

        "Kelly: No, I can do it myself. I just thought maybe we could talk.",
        "Kevin: About what? Old times, the weather? What?",
        "Kelly: I just thought maybe we had some things that we might want to say to each other.",
        "Kevin: Why, don't you think we've said enough? Anything we had, Kelly, died that night with Duke, the night you slept with my son.",

        "Kevin: What?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: There you go.",
        "Michael: So they said at the desk that his parents' names were Joanne and Frederick Scott. Look at that. Just moved to the area, work transfer. They really didn't know many people.",
        "Marcie: Oh, what about the family?",
        "Michael: No family in the area, but we're trying to track some down.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Well, did they say what this little guy's name was?",

        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Michael: Thomas. Hi, Thomas.",
        "Marcie: Hi! It's very nice to meet you, Thomas. That's a really good name. You know, it's just like Michael's daddy. Yes, it is.",
        "Michael: Um -- Thomas is a very common name.",
        "Marcie: Well, yeah. It may be, but I think it's a sign.",

        "Adriana: Prison? I -- I thought he was out of town.",
        "Dorian: Yes, he was. Well, now he's back and in the state penitentiary.",
        "Adriana: What? Do you know why?",
        "Dorian: I haven't the vaguest, and besides which, why should I care?",
        "Adriana: Of course you care. Why can't you just admit that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margaret: How are you going to make me remember?",
        "David: This seems cruel and unusual. We're not still in Thailand, you know.",
        "Margaret: All right! All right, fine! I'll just tell you exactly what you want to hear. I had a baby and this Spencer person -- he delivered it. Are you done with me?",
        "Hugh: A man was executed here tonight for killing you. If he dies, it's going to change a lot of lives.",
        "Margaret: Is this Todd Manning a friend of yours?",
        "Hugh: No. I helped put him in that chamber to get justice for you and your son.",
        "John: Look, maybe you don't know what's what. Somebody does. Tell us what you know about Margaret and her baby and maybe, just maybe we can make a deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Nobody breathing down my neck, Todd. Nobody watching me now. Matter of fact, just about anything could happen now.",
        "Intern: Ready when you are, Dr. Truman.",
        "Spencer: I -- I thought Rogers was on duty. What's going on?",
        "Intern: He is, but Viki Davidson called from the prison, said you were performing emergency heart surgery on her brother. She requested the same team that worked on Kelly Cramer.",
        "Spencer: Right. Yeah, of course, right, yeah. Well, you've made it just in time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Blair? Blair, wait!",
        "Blair: I need to go to the operating room, Viki.",
        "Viki: You can't go in there!",
        "Starr: But my dad --",
        "Viki: Honey, he's in very, very good hands, okay? I called from the road, remember? I wanted to make sure the entire team that assisted Dr. Truman with Kelly is in there with him. You have to sit tight, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: So, wait, we're supposed to sit around and do nothing?",
        "Viki: No. You're going to pray.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Viki: Okay, because that's what your dad needs now -- a lot of prayers. I'm going to go and tell them where we are. Go inside.",
        "Starr: All right.",
        "Viki: Go on.",
        "Starr: So what happened? Why did they stop the execution?",
        "Blair: I don't know.",
        "Starr: Mom, what's going on? I know something was by the way you and Aunt Viki kept looking at each other.",
        "Blair: Look, all I know is I just need to -- we just need to know what Spencer's doing with your father in surgery, okay?",
        "Evangeline: Spencer's with Todd? Alone? My God, Todd's in more danger now than he was at the prison.",
        "Blair: How can you say something like that?",
        "Evangeline: Because it's true, Blair, and the sooner you realize it, the better off everyone will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You know, I'm really going to miss this little guy.",
        "Michael: We have to give him back, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: I know we have to give him back. You know, he made me realize something. You know how we were talking about waiting for the perfect time to have a family?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Well, it's just kind of like -- you know how we wanted everything to be perfect for the wedding and then the tornado hit and then it almost got ruined?",
        "Michael: Yeah, but it didn't. By the end of the night, we were husband and wife.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but that's what I mean, Michael. We could make all the plans in the world that we want, but at the end of the day, nothing's going to go the way we wanted it to anyway. Michael, I want to have a baby. What would you say to that? I mean, look at him. Look at him, he's so cute.",
        "Michael: I'd say this.",
        "[Marcie giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Hey, Kelly, what are you keeping from me?",
        "Kelly: Nothing.",
        "Kevin: I know that -- come on.",
        "Kevin: Another secret?",
        "Kelly: So what? We're not together anymore. I'm not obligated to share my thoughts and feelings with you.",
        "Kevin: You're right, you're right. It's a force of habit. Loving you is a habit that's going to be nearly impossible to break.",
        "Kelly: Really?",
        "Kevin: I said \"nearly,\" not totally. Frankly, you've made it pretty easy to get over you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm not going to stand here and let you trash Spencer, Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: You better. Hasn't he done enough damage?",
        "Starr: What is going on? What is she talking about?",
        "Blair: Nothing, sweetheart. Dr. Truman is in the operating room saving your father's life just like he did in the execution and that's all we know for a fact.",
        "Evangeline: No, it is not all we know for a fact, and even if there's a question, Blair --",
        "Cristian: That's enough.",
        "Evangeline: Why would you do this?",
        "Cristian: Evangeline. Look, I know you're worried about Todd --",
        "Evangeline: I am scared to death. I have no idea what that maniac is going to try to do to him next.",
        "Cristian: Starr's here. She's just a kid. You want to freak her out any more than she already is?",
        "Evangeline: I'm not trying to freak her out. Cristian, I'm trying to save her father's life. He almost died in the execution room, he still might. No, and he's been through hell, and Margaret was alive the whole time!",
        "Starr: Margaret isn't dead? Mom, what is going on?",
        "Blair: I -- I think you better sit down, sweetheart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I'm not taking any deals necessarily, not till I talk to my lawyer.",
        "Bo: Spoken like a man who has something to hide.",
        "John: Of course he's got something to hide. Of course he's got something to hide -- look at him. And you're going to pay for it, you son of a bitch, and so are you!",
        "Margaret: Stop, please! Stop yelling!",
        "John: So are you if you're hiding something right now. You know, I'm sick of this, Bo. I'm sick of this crap, I \u0091m sick of these two. They both killed someone. Why are we even having this little sit-down? No deals, no talking. Throw them in the general population at county lockup and watch how quickly their memories come back!",
        "Bo: Let's talk about this.",
        "Hugh: You know what, Margaret? I am actually glad that you're alive. I really am.",
        "Margaret: I actually believe you are.",
        "Hugh: I fought hard for you and your baby, especially your baby. Where is he? You really don't know?",
        "Margaret: No, I didn't even know that I had a baby until he came to my door.",
        "Hugh: And you -- you knew Todd didn't kill them. You let him walk to his death anyway.",
        "David: You're new at this, aren't you? You have to be a lot slicker than that if you want to get me to talk.",
        "Margaret: Why is this happening to me? I was so happy in Bangkok. I -- I loved my job, I loved my apartment, I loved my life, and then you came and you ruined everything!",
        "Hugh: If he hadn't, if he didn't lead Lieutenant McBain to you, then we wouldn't be this close to finding out the truth. Who did it and why?",
        "Margaret: I don't understand any of this. Why would someone kill over a piddly little number cruncher like me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Spreader. Let's see what's going on here.",
        "[Spencer sighs]",
        "Spencer: Well, there's a substantial amount of damage to his pericardium.",
        "Intern: Yeah, I've never seen it this bad.",
        "Spencer: Neither have I.",
        "Nurse: Think you can save him?",
        "Blair: Spencer, please, you've got to save him. You have to, please. Do something. I will owe you for the rest of my life. Please, I'll do anything, Spencer. Just save him. Please. Please.",
        "Spencer: All right, there is a small chance that he can make it, a very small chance, but everybody has to be on their toes and do exactly as I say -- understood? Good, because if you do not follow my instructions -- and I mean to the letter -- this patient will die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: David humiliated me in front of this entire town. He broke my heart. How can you possibly defend him?",
        "Adriana: I'm not.",
        "Dorian: Are you saying I still love him?",
        "Adriana: I didn't say that, either, but you used to love him and part of you still has to care.",
        "Dorian: It doesn't matter.",
        "Adriana: I thought so, too, with Duke. But maybe it would've if I had stopped thinking about me for one minute and thought about him and the mistakes he was making.",
        "Dorian: Honey, don't blame yourself for the fact that he died. There's nothing that you could've done to save him.",
        "Adriana: What if I had been a better friend? Maybe I could've gotten him to stay away from Kelly and then he would've never been there with her when the tornado hit.",
        "Dorian: It's one thing to wonder, but you probably couldn't have stopped him.",
        "Adriana: Well, we'll never know, will we? Because I didn't even try, and now he's dead. I am not saying that you should get back together with David. But what is it going to take for you to realize that you might actually care if he ruins his life? Going to his funeral?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Thank you. Gentlemen? Just got off the phone with the hospital.",
        "Hugh: Is Todd going to make it?",
        "Bo: We don't know anything yet.",
        "John: All right, we've wasted enough time here. Let's get these two to a Llanview prison.",
        "Margaret: No, I don't want to go to jail.",
        "John: Oh, what'd you think -- we're just going to let you go after everything you've done? Get her out of here.",
        "Officer: Let's go, ma'am.",
        "Margaret: No, honestly, I don't remember any of it!",
        "David: Margaret, don't say anything without a lawyer. Get a good lawyer -- that's what I'm going to do.",
        "David: Okay, I get it -- we're on to good cop/bad cop. Which is which? Actually, you're just a D.A., aren't you? And aren't you on probation for police brutality?",
        "John: You want to see some brutality?",
        "David: Give me a little help here?",
        "Hugh: I don't see any of your rights being violated.",
        "John: Go ahead, Vickers. Provoke me.",

        "Spencer: Suction right there, please. Clamp. Not that one!",
        "Anesthesiologist: B.P. is 70/40 and dropping.",

        "Nurse: He's crashing. No pressure. What do we do, Doctor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I knew Dad didn't kill anyone! I knew it all along! Thank you so much, Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: For what?",
        "Starr: For always believing in my dad. We both knew he wasn't a murderer.",
        "Evangeline: Mm-hmm. And now everyone else knows, too.",
        "Blair: Oh, Viki. Any word on Todd?",
        "Viki: He's still in surgery, but they know where to find us.",
        "Blair: He's got to make it.",
        "Viki: He got this far, okay? And he's not going to give up. He's going to hold on for all of us who love him.",
        "Blair: He doesn't know that -- how could I have not believed him, Viki?",
        "Viki: Don't think about that now, okay?",
        "Blair: Don't think about it? I just -- do you think Spencer --",
        "Spencer: Hey.",
        "Blair: How's Todd?",
        "Spencer: Uh -- why don't we step in here for a moment, okay?",
        "Cristian: Truman's here.",
        "Blair: I just need to know -- did Todd make it or not?",
        "Starr: Dr. Truman, how's my dad?",
        "Spencer: It was -- it was touch and go for a while, but he's -- he's a strong man. He pulled through.",
        "[Viki gasps]",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Spencer: He's in recovery.",
        "Blair: Thank God. Oh, God, you saved him.",
        "Starr: I want to see my dad right now.",
        "Spencer: It'll be a while before he's ready for visitors. And even then, it'll be family only at first, and -- he's -- he's being taken to I.C.U. They have to finish some tests to make sure that Todd wasn't compromised by the surgery in any way.",
        "Viki: Thank you very much. Evangeline, I'll get back to you as soon as I know any more, okay?",
        "Evangeline: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Okay. Cristian.",
        "Evangeline: He made it. Todd survived. He never gave up.",
        "Cristian: No, you never gave up.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What? You got nothing to say to me? Don't worry. I'm not going to give you anything to go to I.A. with. I'll let the system take care of you.",
        "David: The system almost executed an innocent man. So is that what you're going for? You want to give that another shot?",
        "John: I know it was you, Vickers! And I'm going to stop you cold. So go ahead. Hope for the best. But hope ain't such a good plan.",
        "Hugh: Sit down, Vickers. You're making me nervous. What's this?",
        "John: A picture of Vickers as a kid.",
        "David: Huh.",
        "John: The other one's a sketch done by a -- a witness who saw him shoot my father.",
        "Hugh: Where'd you get these?",
        "John: I'll tell you back at the station. The bottom line is, I showed those to Vickers in Bangkok, and he nearly confessed.",
        "Hugh: All right. I'll -- I'll show these to Bo. I'll take care of it.",
        "John: I want in on this.",
        "Hugh: I have to show them to Bo. And Internal Affairs will probably want to weigh in.",

        "Nurse: Dr. McBain, you're needed in I.C.U.",
        "Michael: Not on duty.",
