        "John: Claudine, see if you can get me Statesville on line two again, please.",
        "Marty: John, I need to talk to you.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marty: It's important.",
        "John: What, is Cole in some kind of trouble again?",
        "Marty: No, no, Cole hasn't done anything. I have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: All right, Marty, you're on. Let's hear your deepest thoughts.",
        "Marty's voice: I was in Blair's room, I saw Spencer, I saw the scissors -- I remember!",
        "Hannah's voice: There could be so many explanations for that, so many --",
        "Marty's voice: No, no, there is only one explanation -- I killed Spencer Truman!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Anything I can do to help?",
        "Cristian: I don't know. Let's see -- some crazy racist is out to kill me, my brother's cut me out of his life and left town, possibly for good -- even though he's the only one who can save Jessica's life -- and the woman I love may be dying. No, I don't think you can help.",
        "Blair: Well, I think you're wrong. I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Damn it, Clint. Why doesn't he pick up?",
        "Antonio: You left him a message, right?",
        "Nash: Yes, I left a few messages. I told him you're coming back for the transplant, but he should've gotten his messages by now.",
        "Antonio: It's ironic, isn't it? I cross the ocean to get away from Jessica, and now I'm going to be a part of her life forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor beeps]",
        "Michael: The tests should take about an hour. You know, it might be a good opportunity for you to step out -- [Alarm] Get a bite to eat.",
        "Nurse: Dr. McBain, she's failing.",
        "Viki: Jessie? Jessie?",
        "Clint: Michael, what's happening?",
        "Viki: Michael, please, what -- what's going on, please?",
        "Michael: Out of the room, please.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Michael: Now.",
        "Nurse: Now, please --",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Nurse: Please go, please.",
        "Michael: Get me Dr. Pearce, stat -- we're losing her.",
        "[Monitor beeps]",
        "Dr. Pearce: What happened?",
        "Michael: Her liver -- it's not synthesizing enough clotting protein. She's got gastrointestinal bleeding, and my main concern is Hepatic Encephalopathy.",
        "Dr. Pearce: No way to know while she's unconscious.",
        "Viki: What -- Michael, what is that? Hepatic -- can you fix that?",
        "Nurse: I'm -- I'm sorry. We'll be out to talk to you in a moment.",
        "Viki: She has to hold on, she just has to.",
        "Clint: We are not going to lose her, not after we found a way to save her.",
        "Viki: Yeah, how? Antonio's not even here!",
        "Clint: She is going to hold on! She's got too much to live for -- her daughter, Nash. We are not going to lose her.",
        "Viki: Michael, what -- what is it?",
        "Michael: The liver damage is causing other complications. Her kidneys are failing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Antonio, I wish I could be the one to save her.",
        "Antonio: Right -- so you could be the hero.",
        "Nash: No, that is not what I meant by that at all.",
        "Antonio: You know, even if you did play the white knight, there are no guarantees.",
        "Nash: Guarantees?",
        "Antonio: That Jessica will be with you forever. I mean, look what happened to me. She professed her undying love to me, up and down, then left me for the first guy who walked through the door.",
        "Nash: You think that's what I'm worried about? That's not what I'm worried about. All I am thinking about is not letting Jessica die. Would you think about that? Can you think about that? No, you can't, because all you're obsessed with is your bruised little ego. Well, to hell with that. This is about saving Jessica's life. Can you think about her?",
        "Antonio: You're right. You're right, I was being a jerk. It's a tough situation I'm in. I just -- these feelings for Jessica -- and then I -- never mind. This whole thing is -- it's bigger than me and my feelings, you're right.",
        "Nash: Antonio, this isn't about one-upping you. All right, I -- I understand the sacrifice that you're making, it's not just emotional. It's physical and emotional. I mean, you're in love with Jessica, and you're risking your own life to save her, when, inevitably, you're still going to lose her.",
        "Antonio: It's reality.",
        "Nash: It's harsh. But I'm not so callous that I don't feel very bad about what you're going through. I understand all too well what you're going through. I just wish we didn't have to drag you back into our lives, I'm sorry.",
        "Antonio: \"Drag me back\"? What the hell's that supposed to mean? What, are you insinuating that I wouldn't help Jessica unless I was forced? Nobody had to drag me.",
        "Nash: Right, I'm sorry. It's a poor choice of words.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Let me repeat myself, ok? Maybe this time you will get it. I am not doing this so that you and Jessica can live happily ever after, I am doing this because it's the right thing to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What have you done?",
        "Marty: I -- I don't know how to begin, but I -- I know you're the person I have to tell because you're going to -- you'll know what needs to be done.",
        "John: Ok. Does this have something to do with the panic attacks you've been having lately?",
        "Marty: Yes, it does. Um, I didn't know the source of the panic until now, and -- and I didn't deliberately try to hide the truth from you. I -- I didn't know what the truth was until yesterday --",
        "John: Oh -- oh, ok, ok, slow down. What truth are we talking about here?",
        "Bo: John? I need to talk to you. I think we caught a break on the hate crime case.",
        "John: Uh, ok.",
        "Marty: Uh, no, that's ok, go ahead. I'll -- I'll wait here.",
        "John: Yeah? Just give me one minute, ok? What do you got, Bo?",
        "Bo: When Balsom was here a while ago, I think he may have inadvertently given us a tip.",
        "John: What kind of a tip?",
        "Bo: Well, someone we know might be keeping a secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah's voice: So, in the dreams, do you -- do you know what you're supposed to do with the scissors?",
        "[Tape winds]",
        "Marty's voice: And that's when I start getting scared.",
        "Hannah's voice: And what's scaring you, Marty? What is it? Is it some thing or someone?",
        "Marty's voice: It's -- it's someone. There's someone else in my dream.",
        "[Tape winds]",
        "Marty's voice: It's a woman, and she's wearing white.",
        "Hannah's voice: And why would that be?",
        "Marty's voice: Uh, white, white -- white is, um, the good guys. They always wear white, and it's also the color of death in some countries.",
        "Hannah's voice: Yeah.",
        "Marty's voice: And purity -- um, brides wear -- wear white. It's a bride. Oh, my god.",
        "Hannah's voice: Marty -- Marty, what is it? Who is the bride in your dream?",
        "[Marty pants]",
        "Marty's voice: The bride -- it was Blair., My god, the scissors -- I can't -- I killed Spencer Truman.",

        "Miles: The woman I love killed the only person who's ever loved me.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Balsom's been digging into this Tate Harmon's background.",
        "John: What, outing the guy on TV wasn't enough?",
        "Bo: Well, he was wrong about that, but the point is he thinks that the guy's hiding something.",
        "John: Any idea what?",
        "Bo: Balsom talked to this old friend of Harmon's. This old friend says that Harmon, as a teenager, went away to this camp, and when he got back, he changed.",
        "John: \"Changed\"? What -- changed how?",
        "Bo: The camp was in Wyoming.",
        "John: Wyoming?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm. Yeah. You think that's a coincidence?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Marty: Hello?",
        "Miles: I need to see you, Marty, right away.",
        "Marty: Miles, this isn't a good time, ok? I'm in the middle of something important.",
        "Miles: Whatever it is, this is more important. It's about Spencer's murder.",
        "Marty: what about it?",
        "Miles: We need to talk about this in person -- and keep it between the two of us. Come to my suite at the palace, I'll be waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I don't know, Bo. At link is tenuous at best. And I've seen that guy Harmon around -- it's not like he's keeping a low profile.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but he could hide in plain sight.",
        "John: And our guy likely had surgery in Wyoming. I kind of remember when Harmon retired, he blew out his shoulder. Maybe it wasn't the first time.",
        "Bo: His medical history could be public record, could even be on one of those sports websites, so I'll get Sahid to check into that.",
        "John: Hmm, all right. I'm going to try to find out the name of that camp he went to.",
        "Bo: We're on to something.",
        "John: Hmm. Oh -- you're not going to tell the mayor about this, are you?",
        "Bo: I don't know -- you know, then he can hold one of his press conferences and he could tank our whole investigation -- I don't think so.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Nobody can do anything for me right now, ok why are you even here?",
        "Blair: Well, I came here to work on a song, and if you weren't so defensive, maybe you'd get a chance to hear it. You know, Cristian, I can be your friend -- just like you were a friend to me when, you know, rode to Starr's rescue the other night at the movie theater.",
        "Cristian: Wait a minute, I didn't exactly volunteer for that.",
        "Blair: Yeah, but you went along with it, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate that. I wish that I could bring Antonio ho and I wish that I could heal Evangeline and Jessica, but I can't. But I can be here for you. You can talk to me. I can be your friend.",
        "Layla: Hey, Cristian, Blair. I heard you were here.",
        "Cristian: Did you hear something about your sister?",
        "Layla: I just got back from the clinic. She's the same.",
        "Blair: Layla, I am just so sorry about Evangeline.",
        "Layla: Yeah, me, too. I've never seen my sister hold so still. She even tosses and turns when she sleeps. It's -- I just can't describe it. But thank you for -- you know. I'll let you know if there's any change. So I -- I guess I will set up.",
        "Cristian: Whoa, wait a minute, \"set up\"? You don't have to work. Are you crazy?",
        "Layla: I need to stay busy.",
        "Vincent: Um, then I'll catch up with you guys later.",
        "Layla: No, um, stay -- for a little while. Have a drink, maybe?",
        "Vincent: Ok.",
        "Layla: Ok.",
        "Cristian: All right, it's -- it's this waiting that's killing me. Not being able to do anything, it makes me so damn angry. At least when I boxed, I could go to the gym and beat up on something.",
        "Blair: You still love Evangeline, don't you?",
        "Cristian: I was angry about her relationship with Todd.",
        "Blair: You and me both.",
        "Cristian: But, yes, I still love her, very much.",
        "Blair: Cristian, if Evangeline got better and came back to Llanview, would you tell her that? Would you try to start all over again?",
        "Cristian: What about you? If Todd comes back from where he is, will you admit that you love him and start over again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well, Dr. Pearce is doing an emergency hemodialysis. This should remove the excess protein and fluid from her blood. That should restore her kidney function.",
        "Clint: And you said Jessie was also suffering from portal hypertension?",
        "Michael: And the vessels, the blood vessels in the liver, are blocked. This is hindering blood flow.",
        "Viki: If the blood supply is cut off --",
        "Michael: It could affect her heart and her brain.",
        "Viki: How is she, doctor?",
        "Dr. Pearce: Her kidneys are functioning for now, but once a patient's in failure, there's a domino effect. There's nothing more I can do until the donor is here.",
        "Clint: Doctor, could -- could we possibly see her?",
        "Dr. Pearce: Yes, of course.",
        "Jessica: Do I look that bad?",
        "Clint: You are beautiful, Jessie, as always.",
        "Jamie: Are we there yet?",
        "Antonio: No, not yet, sweetheart.",
        "Jamie: When Jessica's better, will she come to Spain with us?",
        "Antonio: No, no, she won't. It's like I told you before, ok? It's just you and me from now on.",
        "Nash: Hi. The pilot's opened up a phone line so I can try Clint again.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Clint: Hello?",
        "Nash: Clint? Finally -- I've been trying to reach you.",
        "Clint: Hold on. Hold on a minute. I got to take this. I'll be right back. [Clint sighs] Nash, we're having a crisis.",
        "Nash: Why? What's wrong?",
        "Clint: First of all, are you with Antonio?",
        "Nash: Yeah, yeah. No -- so you haven't gotten any of my messages? We're on a plane right now back to Llanview, Antonio's agreed to be the donor.",
        "Clint: Oh, thank god. When are you going to be landing?",
        "Nash: Uh -- a couple hours.",
        "Clint: Nash, I pray that's soon enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Oh, honey. You know, something is -- what is it? Is it Jess?",
        "Paige: I called the hospital on my way over here and things have gotten bad.",
        "Bo: S anybody found Antonio?",
        "Paige: No.",
        "Bo: And he's the only match?",
        "Paige: Yeah -- besides Viki, but she can't donate because her health is far too fragile.",
        "Bo: She's going to fight you on that.",
        "Paige: Oh, she already has, tooth and nail, and I don't blame her, but there's a really good chance she wouldn't even survive the surgery.",
        "Bo: How long can Jess wait?",
        "Paige: Jess is very weak, and she's getting weaker. It has to be done really soon.",
        "Bo: I can only imagine what my brother's going through right now.",
        "Clint: Jessica's worse -- her kidneys are failing. They had to put her on emergency dialysis and that stabilized her, but she's still very, very we, Nash. She can't hold on much longer without the transplant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I want to talk to her.",
        "Viki: So, anyway, Natalie said that she loves you and she wants to come and see you, and she's going to do that as soon as she feels better, ok?",
        "Jessica: I -- I want to see her, too.",
        "Clint: Nash is on the phone. He found him, he's with Antonio.",
        "Michael: Has Antonio agreed?",
        "Clint: Yes, he has.",
        "Viki: Oh, thank God! Honey --",
        "Clint: Jessie -- Jessie, are you strong enough to talk to Nash? Is that ok, Michael?",
        "Jessica: Please, I need to hear his voice.",
        "Michael: That's fine. Absolutely.",
        "Viki: Yeah? Here, let me -- just turn your head. Here you go.",
        "Jessica: Nash?",
        "Nash: Hey. Babe, you just hang on, ok? I'm coming home.",
        "Jessica: I'm not sure I can.",
        "Nash: Uh -- now, you have to. I've already started arranging for your coming- home party. You can't have a party without the guest of honor, right?",
        "Jessica: I love you so much. I need you here.",
        "Nash: I'm on my way. I love you, too.",
        "Jessica: I need you to do something for me.",

        "Cole: Yeah, if you want.",
        "John: Well, I'll tell you what -- you surprise me, all right? I don't think I could stand it twice. What are you doing? You know, you should -- you should get a girl to help you with this. You know, they -- they eat that kind of thing up.",

        "John: Look, when someone has what your mother and father had, I'd consider that pretty damn lucky.",
        "Cole: But I hate seeing her miserable. And I don't want her grieving over my dad the rest of her life, and I hate seeing her me -- and I know my dad would want her to be happy.",

        "Cole: Huh. Yeah -- me.",

        "Cole: Yeah, I guess it would be kind of strange for you and my mom to get together.",
        "John: Yeah, why's that?",
        "Cole: Because you're nothing like my dad. You know, he was a poet, a pacifist, he laughed a lot. Not that -- you know, it -- you -- you're a really great guy, and -- and my mom could do a lot worse.",
        "John: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Cole: Wow -- yeah, that didn't come out right. That's not what I meant -- that's not how I meant it to sound. What I'm trying to say is I really like you, and my mom -- well, she's great, and why am I talking to you about this? Oh, my goodness. Uh -- I am really sorry. It's none of my business. I -- I don't know. I just -- I've been thinking a lot lately, and I'm kind of in a weird mood, so just pretend that none of that happened, please.",
