        "Viki, Clint and Bo find Bess at Nash's parents' home. Brody comes to and attempts to convince her to give herself up. Tess also comes out and tells her she has no choice. But she does not listen. At that point, Viki determines that maybe she can get through to Bess by acting as Jean Randolph. Meanwhile, Starr and Cole wonder what to do with the fact that when Hope comes back they need to figure out whether to keep her or let Marcie and Michael adopt her. After Dorian finds out what happened, she tells Blair and Starr that they cannot allow Viki's family to get away with taking Starr's baby and having everybody believing she died. She also reveals to Blair that Ray is in a crises with his daughter being sent to St. Anne's. Blair acknowledges that her aunt has real feelings for Ray Montez."

        "Blair: Oh, baby. I know this is tough. I know you're just trying to brace yourself to figure out a way to say good-bye to Hope once Bo tracks Jessica and her down.",
        "Starr: I just keep trying to get used to thinking about Hope in the present tense.",
        "Blair: God, it's such a miracle.",
        "Starr: It really is.",
        "Blair: It's -- you know, it's even -- it's unbelievable. I can't even process it.",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "Blair: But do you know what? We'll just take it one step at a time. First, let's just pray that she comes home to us safely. And then you know what, sweetheart? We will deal -- we will deal with handing Hope over to Marcie when you need to, all right?",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, Rachel. Just because I told you that I wished Starr and I didn't have to give our baby away doesn't mean you have to baby-sit me. Okay, I'm not going to go out and score pills and get high to ease the pain, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Rachel: Who said that I was worried about anything?",
        "Cole: I mean, my God, my baby is alive. That's enough to make the most dedicated druggie stop using, right? It's a miracle.",
        "Rachel: And I would love to celebrate that miracle with you, but since we're both trying to stay clean and sober, I figured Tex-Mex.",
        "Cole: No, thanks. I can't eat right now.",
        "Rachel: Then how about keeping me company?",
        "Cole: You trying to say you don't think I should be alone right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Langston: Hey, lover.",
        "Markko: Ooh, I like it when you call me that.",
        "Langston: Yeah, Dorian's pretty high on it, too, judging by her expression.",
        "Markko: You called me \"lover\" in front of her? Are you trying to get me bumped off?",
        "Langston: Dorian, you don't mind if I call Markko \"lover,\" do you?",
        "Dorian: \"Mon amour\" and \"mon ch\u00e9rie\" are far more elegant, but you can call the boy whatever you like.",
        "[Langston laughs]",
        "Markko: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Langston: She's gone. We can talk. I miss you.",
        "Markko: I miss you, too.",
        "Dorian: Blair! Starr! Oh, my goodness! Oh -- oh, I can't believe this. Everybody kept telling me that you were all right, but I had to see for myself, with my own two eyes.",
        "Blair: Yes, I'm -- listen, I was beaten up a little bit, but I'm home. I'm fine. And it's -- I'm fine. Feels good to be home, thank you.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Langston: Starr and her mom are here. I -- I got to go. I love you.",
        "Markko: Love you, too.",
        "Dorian: Blair, so much has happened to you. How did this Powell Lord escape? How did he get you into the frat house? Try to kill you?",
        "Blair: He couldn't have done it without help from Rebecca Lewis.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Blair: But, you know, thank God it's all over.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank heaven. Now, did you see a doctor?",
        "Blair: I have a bandage. I'm fine.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, I -- what possessed you to move back into Todd's house?",
        "Blair: Dorian, my children were there, all right? What did you want me to do? I mean, come on.",
        "Langston: Are you okay? I -- is this finally over?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I'm okay, I guess. But as far as this being over, I --",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute. Is there something more to this ordeal that I don't know about?",
        "Blair: Yes, and it is amazing.",
        "Langston: What -- what are you talking about?",
        "Blair: Um, we just found out that, uh -- that Starr's baby is alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Bess! Bess! Please, Bess!",
        "Clint: Viki, no, you've got to stay back.",
        "Viki: But, Clint, she's in there. Jessica's in the house.",
        "Clint: I know that, but we can't --",
        "Bo: Do you know anything about Nash's parents?",
        "Clint: No, nothing. Nash never even mentioned them.",
        "Bo: All right, Brody Lovett said that Jessica told him that Nash was about to reach out to them just before he died. That's the way Lovett figured out where she might be. I told him, don't confront Bess until we get there. I doubt that he listened to me. Mr. and Mrs. Brennan, I'm commissioner Buchanan, Llanview, Pennsylvania, P.D. I'm Jessica's uncle. I'm here with her parents. We need you to open the door, let us in, so we can talk to Jessica. Mr. and Mrs. Brennan, let's wrap this up before anyone gets hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: Cindy, Phil, the police have this place surrounded. You have to help us find a different way out.",
        "Phil: Actually, Jessica, I think we want to hear what the cops have to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hope is alive?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: This is so wonderful. Starr, after everything that you have been through --",
        "Starr: I know. Believe me, it's a miracle.",
        "Dorian: And the baby has been with Jessica all this time?",
        "Blair: Yeah, Jessica blocked out that her baby died and I don't even think she has a clue that Hope isn't hers.",
        "Dorian: So much for her complete recovery at St. Ann's.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? It's nobody's fault here. Jessica was very ill, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: And now she's taken our baby, Hope, and she -- she's run off goodness knows where with her? Chh -- Starr, the most important thing is that your baby is alive and I want you to know we're going to everything we can to get her back for you.",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian --",
        "Dorian: Whatever it takes.",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian! I'm not mad at Jessica. I feel sorry for her.",
        "Dorian: Well, of course. Because you are a wonderful human being.",
        "Starr: No --",
        "Dorian: And I -- I do not want you to be worried about Jessica because she's got your Aunt Viki and your Uncle Clint, and they will see to it that she gets through this crisis unscathed.",
        "Starr: That is not going to be possible. No matter what Aunt Viki or Uncle Clint do, she's had this baby this whole time and now she is going to lose her. They're going to have to tell her that her baby is dead and I do not wish that on any mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: What the police have to say is irrelevant. I told you, my mother and father will stop at nothing to take Chloe away from me.",
        "Cindy: Well, I know that's what you said, but --",
        "Bess: This is your granddaughter. You cannot open the door.",
        "Phil: All due respect, Jessica, we will decide what we will or won't do in our own home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, dude, what can I get you?",
        "Rachel: Hello to you, too.",
        "Markko: Oh, uh, hi.",
        "Rachel: I don't bite, you know.",
        "Markko: I know.",
        "Rachel: Look, you faked a drug test for Cole. I'm past it. So is Cole. You're not going to get punished for it.",
        "Markko: It was really lame what I did, and wrong. And -- I'm sorry.",
        "Rachel: It's over. I'll have the pollo con mole.",
        "Markko: Good choice. What do you want?",
        "Cole: Oh, nothing.",
        "Markko: So chicken fried steak?",
        "Cole: No, I'm not hungry. Seriously, I'm not hungry.",
        "Markko: Okay, I'll just get you a soda then.",
        "Cole: Well, thanks for not making him feel like a jerk.",
        "Rachel: I'm not really in the business of making people feel like jerks.",
        "Cole: You made him feel better.",
        "Rachel: I just wish I could do the same thing for you.",
        "Cole: I just hate all this waiting around for news.",
        "Rachel: Well, here's someone who might be able to help.",
        "Cole: Hey, Nora. Did you find out anything?",
        "Nora: Well, yes -- as a matter of fact, Bo just got a lead on Jessica -- got him racing out of the station.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, it's just a matter of time until Bo finds the baby and brings her home.",
        "Starr: I'm going to go upstairs and lie down.",
        "Blair: Starr, wait a minute.",
        "Starr: What? It's fine. It just keeps hitting me over and over again that Hope is alive and everything is different now.",
        "Blair: Starr --",
        "Langston: I'm going to go up, too. I'm really glad that you're okay.",
        "Blair: Thank you, Langston. Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Okay, I held my tongue while the girls were in the room, but this is unconscionable.",
        "Blair: What are you talking about?",
        "Dorian: Okay. Jessica's baby died. That's tragic. She lost her mind. That's tragic, too. But Viki and her entire family refused to accept what cannot be changed, so they took our living, breathing baby and they told us that it was dead and now they're such cowards, they're going to blame it on Jessica's alter-personality.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Do another com check with every man on the perimeter. We're going to exhaust every possible means of negotiation we have before we consider using force to take Bess.",
        "Viki: Force? No.",
        "Clint: Bo, that's your niece in there.",
        "Bo: And she may have four hostages in there.",
        "Viki: Why are they hostages?",
        "Bo: Viki, our priority right now is the baby.",
        "Clint: What about Jessica?",
        "Bo: If we feel that that baby is at risk, then we're going to have to go in.",
        "Viki: Clint, what can we do?",
        "Clint: We're going to have to find some way to get through to her.",
        "Bo: Bess isn't answering her cell phone right now, so I'm going to call the number that I have for this house, call their landline and see if Brody will pick up. Maybe he can tell us what's going on in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: I apologize for my reaction earlier when you tried to phone the hotline.",
        "Cindy: Reaction? You yanked our phone line right out of the wall. It was like you -- you turned into someone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: No good. Line's dead.",
        "Charlie: Hey, we got here as fast as we could.",
        "Natalie: Mom, is she in there? What's happening?",
        "Viki: Um, she is, yes. But she's not Jessica. She's Bess and she's got Chloe with her. I think -- they both apparently are all right. I don't know, but I -- I do know for a fact, Bess is not going to give that baby up without a fight.",
        "Bess: I was protecting the baby. You and Phil want to be a part of Chloe's life, right? Well, if you don't help us, I swear to you, the people outside will make sure you never see your granddaughter again. And you will lose this one living part \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Bess, don't make this any harder than it already is. Bess, you need to listen to us. You need to let us in and let us help you. Think about the baby. That's it, we're going in.",
        "Viki: No, no, wait. Please. Look, um, Brody caught up with her last night and he got Jessica to come out. Let him try. Maybe he can do it again.",
        "Bo: Viki, we don't know what shape he's in right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Jessica, I know you can hear me.",
        "Bess: Hit him again. Do something.",
        "Brody: Jessica, I know you want to come back. You have to fight. I'm right here. This can end now and I'll be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Where did Bo go? What -- what kind of tip did he get? Are Jessica and the baby okay? What's going on?",
        "Nora: I -- I don't know anything else other than that. I'm so sorry. I do know that the baby's --",
        "Cole: No, Rachel knows about Hope.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Cole: I told her everything.",
        "Nora: I know how hard this must be for you. If I hear of anything, I promise I'll let you know.",
        "Cole: Thanks. Now I'm going to go tell Markko. He still doesn't know.",
        "Rachel: Go. I'm good here.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "Nora: Wow. It's incredible about the baby, isn't it?",
        "Rachel: It's an unbelievable story.",
        "Nora: Yeah, and then some.",
        "Rachel: That baby's death -- its supposed death -- it is at the root of all of Cole's problems. I am so happy for him. And so sad for Jessica.",
        "Nora: That girl l has been through too much and now she's going to have to face the death of her child.",
        "Rachel: How's Clint taking it?",
        "Nora: Oh, he's devastated, but he can't even mourn his granddaughter because he's so worried about Jessica.",
        "Rachel: Well, at least has this made you and Clint get closer?",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah, we're fine. Actually, we fixed everything before all of this happened.",
        "Rachel: Really?",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rachel: Who caved?",
        "Nora: What does that mean?",
        "Rachel: Come on, mom, you and Clint were practically on opposite sides of the globe. How did you fix that?",
        "Nora: Oh, it was easy. Clint proposed, and I said yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Viki, Brody was in there before we got here. Now we don't know what shape he's in right now. We don't know if the Brennans are hurt. We have no idea -- we don't know anything about how the baby's doing right now. We have to go in.",
        "Viki: Bess is not going to back down, okay? She doesn't know how to do that, Bo. Please, I'm begging you. Tell these men, don't hurt her. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Bess, there's nowhere left to go. There's nothing left to do. Let me take you home.",
        "Bess: No.",
        "Cindy: Phil --",
        "Phil: I think we need the police to sort this out.",
        "Phil: Come on, Cindy. We'll be all right. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: The hardest thing I've ever had to do was to give you up. And even though I am giving up my right to be your mother --",
        "Langston: Hey, Starr. It's me. Can I come in?",
        "Starr: Sure.",
        "Langston: I just -- I can't wrap my head around this.",
        "Starr: Welcome to the club.",
        "Langston: Your baby's alive.",
        "Starr: I know, I -- she's going to have a future. She's going to become a little girl and then she's going to become a teenager and I'm going to know her. Can you believe that? I'm going to be able to see the type of person she turns into. She's going to a part of my life for the rest of my life, if Marcie is okay with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Dude, this is wild. Your kid's alive?",
        "Cole: Crazy, huh? When I heard it, I was, like, what? I mean, I still am. I swear, it's like I'm dreaming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It's real, but it's not real, you know, because she's not here and Bo still hasn't found Jessica and until then, Cole and I just in limbo.",
        "Langston: God, you must be going crazy.",
        "Starr: Kind of.",
        "Langston: Did -- do you want me to leave you alone?",
        "Starr: God, no. No -- God, no. You're actually the only person that I want to see right now.",
        "Langston: Except, maybe, Cole?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I had to take a time-out earlier. I pretended I got a text from the center dragging me in for a drug test. How ridiculous is that?",
        "Markko: It's better than doing drugs, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole said he got a text from the doctor's telling him to come in and take a random drug test, but I don't believe him.",
        "Langston: Why not?",
        "Starr: Because he wanted to get away from everyone and something about the situation made him weird.",
        "Langston: Well, maybe it's -- I mean, Dorian brought up the whole \"who gets custody of the baby,\" you know?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: So, what's up? I mean, when Starr was pregnant and decided to give up the baby, you were all over that -- you know, wanting to keep the kid. Has that all come back to bite you again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: What does this mean? I mean, are you having second thoughts about giving your baby to Marcie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Neither Viki nor Bo are answering and the police refuse to answer any questions about Jessica or the baby. I mean, really --",
        "Blair: Dorian, Dorian --",
        "Dorian: I am that child's --",
        "Blair: Dorian, I know you mean well, but stay out of it.",
        "Dorian: Stay out of it?",
        "Blair: Stay out of it.",
        "Dorian: I am not going to see Starr railroaded into giving away her baby.",
        "Blair: There is nothing that we can do. We just have to be patient. Please. I know that's not in your vocabulary, but be patient.",
        "Dorian: \"Be patient.\" I can't believe it. That baby's alive. Well, I -- I certainly was due some good news.",
        "Blair: Did something happen that I'm not aware of?",
        "Dorian: Oh --",
        "[Dorian clears throat]",
        "Dorian: Langston -- Langston and I, we went to, uh, St. Ann's today.",
        "Blair: Why, did something happen to Mama?",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, no. Your mother's fine. She's still on that cruise. She's --",
        "Blair: Then why did you go to St. Ann's?",
        "Dorian: Because Starr may have found her child, but Ray has lost his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I don't know what I think.",
        "Langston: Well, you were talking about having Hope back in your life and it kind of sounded like --",
        "Starr: Look, I just found out that she was alive. That's all I can deal with right now.",
        "Langston: Okay, I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to pressure you about who's going to keep her. Especially when you don't even know where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You know, all those feelings about wanting to keep the baby are still there, but there's nothing I can do about it.",
        "Markko: Does Starr know that you still want to keep the baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. I want to talk to you about this because I haven't been able to stop thinking about what it's going to feel like to hold Hope in my arms.",
        "Langston: Well, does Marcie know that she's alive?",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Langston: Because Dorian was sounding like she doesn't think you have to give Hope away if you don't want to.",
        "Starr: But I practically begged the woman to raise my baby. I made a promise to her, Langston, and I can't go back on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Marcie was there today when they told us that Hope was alive. Man, she was so happy. And Starr wasn't saying anything that would keep her from feeling that way. So if she changed her mind, if she wants to keep the baby, she hasn't told me.",
        "Markko: But the two of you have been through so much together trying to find out what really happened to your baby. I mean, you got to have at least a sense of how she feels about the baby now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: When I was pregnant, I was sure I was ready to give my baby to Marcie. I was at peace with my decision. But now I'm not so peaceful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Bess, listen to me. There is nowhere to go. This is the end of the road. Let me in.",
        "Bess: No. Leave us alone. If you care anything for Jessica, you'll stop trying to take this baby from her.",
        "Rachel: Why didn't you tell me that Clint proposed?",
        "Nora: I'm telling you now. Well, it was just -- you know, it was spur of the moment and then all of this started happening with Jessica and -- I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.",
        "Rachel: Well, congratulations.",
        "Nora: Thank you.",
        "Rachel: Are you thrilled?",
        "Nora: Yeah. Of course, absolutely.",
        "Rachel: How did it all go down? I mean, what made you decide to get married?",
        "Nora: Um, we love each other.",
        "Rachel: Right, but one minute you guys are fighting, the next, he's on one knee and you're saying yes? That's not really your style.",
        "Nora: Well, people evolve.",
        "Rachel: You can't snow me, Mom. Either you tell me what happened or you tell me to buzz off.",
        "Nora: Okay. Well, it kind of happened because Clint and Bo had a tiff.",
        "Rachel: About what?",
        "Nora: Um, me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Could you check?",
        "Phil: Jessica just tore up the stairs --",
        "Cindy: She has the baby.",
        "Phil: That guy Brody ran after her and --",
        "Cindy: I don't understand any of this. What is going on with our daughter-in- law?",
        "Viki: Brody? Brody, how is Jessica?",
        "Bo: Did you see the baby?",
        "Viki: Are they okay?",
        "Brody: Okay, both of them are fine. But Jessica is still Bess, ma'am. She's locked herself into a bedroom upstairs. I -- I couldn't get in.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you did the right thing coming back down.",
        "Brody: I didn't want to put too much pressure on her. I -- I was afraid for the baby and for Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: There are police everywhere. They want to take you from me. And I won't let them. Can't. Because losing you will destroy Jessica. What am I going to do now?",
        "Tess: Good question. What are you going to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Now it's a stand-off. If Bess gets desperate and tries to go out one of the upstairs window, I've got the house surrounded.",
        "Clint: Should we try to wait her out?",
        "Bo: No, I don't think so. We've got to make our move while we have her trapped.",
        "Clint: So what do you want to do?",
        "Bo: We'll break down the door. I'll grab Jess. You take the baby.",
        "Viki: No. No, no, no. Look, Jessie knows deep down inside that her baby died. If we don't handle this right, she could completely shatter and we will never get her back.",
        "Clint: Viki, Bo's right. We got to do something.",
        "Viki: I know. And I have an idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You know, after prom, Cole and I -- we thought about what Hope would be like at her prom. We actually went to her grave and we dreamt about what she would be like -- by then if she were alive, what our lives would be like if we had raised her together.",
        "Langston: Oh, Starr.",
        "Starr: Now she's alive and it's -- it's the dream come true that we've been waiting for.",
        "Langston: You guys deserve it. I mean, you've been through so much.",
        "Starr: Lang, I know. And a part of me -- a part of me just wants to burst out with happiness, but then another part of me thinks that I'm not going to be able to handle it.",
        "Langston: Handle what?",
        "Starr: Holding Hope for the first time, knowing that she's my baby, and then having to hand her to Marcie.",
        "Langston: But, Starr, I mean --",
        "Starr: But, like I said, I've made my decision, and I have to stand by that. But it's going to be a lot harder than I thought it would be. You know, I -- Cole and I, through this whole thing, we've gotten a lot stronger than we were before. But the whole reason we broke up, the whole reason why he freaked out and he got on drugs and did everything that he did, was because of my decision to give away the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr would never go back on her promise to Marcie, and I would never ask her to. You know, I made my peace with it before and --",
        "Markko: Yeah, but can you do it again? Can you go along with Starr's decision again?",
        "Cole: I have to -- I signed away my rights.",
        "Markko: Yeah, but --",
        "Cole: There's one thing that I'm sure about now, and that's that I want Starr in my life.",
        "Markko: With or without the baby?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Markko: All right, hold on to that. Hold on to that and you'll be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Bo and Clint got into a fight, over you?",
        "Nora: Well, it's certainly within the realm of possibilities.",
        "Rachel: I didn't mean it like that. It's just -- what happened?",
        "Nora: Well, you know Bo and I have gotten closer because of Matthew's accident, you know? And, I mean, it makes sense. It's just -- it's normal. And then there was this crazy moment where Bo almost kissed me.",
        "Rachel: Whoa!",
        "Nora: Okay, he -- he didn't. He didn't and we talked about it and we realized that we were confusing that kind of closeness with something else and then -- and we didn't want to go there.",
        "Rachel: Okay.",
        "Nora: All right, so, you know, we sealed the deal with a hug and at that moment, Clint walks in and he sees us and he hits the roof and so Bo and Clint ended up talking and they got everything out in the open.",
        "Rachel: And that's when Clint asked you to marry him?",
        "Nora: Pretty much, yeah.",
        "Rachel: So why did you say yes? To squash any chance of something happening between you and Bo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: You really think this could work?",
        "Clint: Will Bess buy into it?",
        "Viki: I have to try, okay?",
        "Bo: Viki, this is unorthodox, to say the least.",
        "Viki: This whole situation is unorthodox, Bo. I know you have to focus on the baby, but surely, getting Jessica to come out of her own volition is the safest possible outcome for the baby.",
        "Bo: No, of course it is.",
        "Viki: Please, please let me try this.",
        "Clint: And, Bo, I think it's better than breaking in and scaring Jessica and the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: If you're supposed to be Jessica's protector, then why the hell are you running the risk of letting them bust in here and scare the hell out of her? What about the baby? Do you want men with guns in here?",
        "Bess: Victoria will never allow that.",
        "Tess: She may not have a choice.",
        "Viki: I think that this is the only way to make sure that Jessie suffers as little as possible.",
        "Tess: Let Jessica go home to Bree. Open that door and give them back that baby.",
        "Bess: Allow them to tell Jessica the truth? Do you have any idea what that'll do to her?",
        "Tess: Jessica's baby is dead. Nothing is going to change that. You have to let this go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki, I don't want you to get hurt. Is this safe?",
        "Viki: I'll be fine, Charlie. She's my daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: There's always a choice. There's always a next logical step.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I can get through to Bess.",
        "Bo: 15 Minutes. That's all I can give you, and then we're going to have to make our move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Ray's just devastated. I mean, he had these fantasies about being a father to Lola again and, you know, she's so -- so sedated at St. Ann's, she -- she's unconscious. I tried to get him to come home with me and -- nah. He wouldn't budge.",
        "Blair: I had, um, no idea that you were so into Ray Montez.",
        "Dorian: You have no idea how into him I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Are you and Cole working on things?",
        "Starr: We're getting closer, but it makes me nervous.",
        "Langston: Why? You guys belong together.",
        "Starr: What's going to happen when the baby comes back and Michael and Marcie take her home? We're going to get ripped apart all over again and I don't think we can handle it.",
        "Langston: I think you're going to need each other more than ever.",

        "Langston: It's Markko.",
        "Starr: Mar-- prom! Langston, after prom! I'm so sorry, I never asked you what happened! Please, tell me everything -- well, not everything. Okay, yeah, actually, I want you to tell me everything.",
        "Langston: Well, it was --",
        "Starr: It was amazing and perfect and Aunt Dorian did not mess anything up?",
        "Langston: Well, no. Aunt Dorian didn't, but --",
        "Starr: What do you mean? Langston, what happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Man, I thought my situation was crazy. Lola killed her own mom? I mean, is that chick totally nuts or what?",
        "Markko: Yeah, it looks like. I mean, I'm just thanking my lucky stars that her crazy plan for me and Langston didn't work out. You thinking about the baby again?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'm starting to feel bad for running out on Starr.",
        "Markko: Then do something about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Well, you're awful blunt.",
        "Rachel: Hmm, I learned from the master. So am I right? Did you accept Clint's proposal so that you don't have to deal with your feelings for Bo?",
        "Nora: No. I love Clint.",
        "Rachel: Nobody's saying that you don't.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rachel: But being engaged kind of puts the kibosh on what's happening with you and Bo.",
        "Nora: There's nothing happening with me and Bo.",
        "Rachel: Hmm -- sure. I almost make out with guys all the time that nothing's happening with.",
        "Nora: Well, you always didn't make out -- you know what? Let's talk about your love life.",
        "Rachel: I don't have one, which is why I'm sticking my nose into yours.",
        "Nora: Yeah, for the last time.",
        "Rachel: Something was brewing with you and Bo.",
        "Nora: Our son was paralyzed and we got close --",
        "Rachel: I don't care. If you are trying to turn it off by getting married to Clint, that is not fair to Clint -- or to Bo or to you.",
        "Nora: For God's sakes. So what do you want me to do -- break off my engagement to Clint?",
        "Rachel: Is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Right now, we're trying to reach out to Bess on her terms. No, I can't tell you any more than that. Okay, I'll let you know as soon as I know more.",
        "Clint: Who was that?",
        "Bo: John McBain.",
        "Clint: Oh. Well, this situation is really getting to me.",
        "Bo: Any particular reason why?",
        "Clint: I thought you might be talking to Nora.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I keep racking my brains trying to figure out what else I could've done for Jess.",
        "Charlie: Well -- hey! You did a lot, Brody. You figured out where she was, you got everybody here -- now we just have to let Viki handle it. We've got to trust her. She knows her own daughter, and she understands Bess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Okay, genius. If there's always a next logical step, tell me what it is. Tell me what you're going to do.",
        "Bess: This.",
        "Bess: I can figure this out. I have to.",
        "Viki: Bess?",
        "Bess: Go away, Victoria.",
        "Viki: It's not Victoria. It's Jean -- Randolph.",
        "Viki: Now, open the door.",

        "Dorian: It's so wonderful to have Sam and Jack back in the house.",
        "Blair: Yes. Thanks, I'm going to go check on them.",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm also very grateful that this whole situation has exonerated John of all charges, and I'll tell you, when everything settles down, I'm going to throw the two of you a wedding, a real wedding! Hmm -- that'll prove to Todd that you really are finished with him.",
        "Blair: Well, what's important right now is to make sure Starr's baby gets home safely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You know what I want? Another dessert.",
        "Rachel: Huh. Remember I am your daughter; I am on your side. Now, you can sit here and bury the issue all you want, but at some point, you are going to have to make a decision about Clint -- and about Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Bo? Maybe we should go up there.",
        "Bo: All right, just have him stand by for now. Wait for my word. We're ready to go, but I think we should take a little more time. Let's give Viki a chance.",
        "Clint: Okay, Bo. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: You're Jean Randolph?",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Yes. As Victoria's gatekeeper, I am completely aware of the responsibility that you shoulder as Jessica's protector. And I respect all that you have done for her. However, I need to talk to you about how to resolve this situation logically.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Lola poked holes in your condom? Why?",
        "Langston: Well, she couldn't have Markko, so she wanted to ruin my life.",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh. Well, if she could kill her mom -- I'm just really glad that she didn't hurt you.",
        "Langston: I know. Look, just call Cole, okay? You know you want to.",
        "Starr: If he wanted to be here, he would be.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Langston: You feel like seeing anyone?",
        "Starr: No, but if it's Aunt Dorian or my mom, they're not going to give up. Come in!",
        "Langston: Hey! What are you doing here?",
        "Markko: Shh, shh! I snuck in through the kitchen to avoid Dr. Lord and I brought someone.",
        "Cole: I'm back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: [As Jean] I know you think you can deal with this and that you don't need any help, but you do. And frankly, I'm the only one who thinks as rationally as you do, so I understand you. As things stand now, Bess, there is no way out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, so I spoke with my dad and he said -- he said that mama is trying to work on Bess, trying to get her to come out. Listen, I am really, really sorry that that little girl in there is not your granddaughter, but I -- I want you to know you do have a granddaughter.",
        "Cindy: We do?",
        "Phil: Well, Jessica didn't say anything about another little girl.",
        "Natalie: Her name is Bree, and I really look forward to introducing the two of you. She's -- she's beautiful. She's got a -- a lot of Nash in her and she's just cute and funny and smart and she's just -- she's so much like Nash.",
        "Cindy: Oh. I -- I can't wait to meet her. Nash wrote us that he wanted that to happen.",
        "Jared: Nash was a great guy and he and Jessica loved each other very much.",
        "Cindy: You know, for the few moments that Jessica was herself, it seemed to me that she'd found someone else to love.",
