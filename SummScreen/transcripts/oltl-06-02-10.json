        "Bo and Nora wake up and relish what a perfect day it will be because it is their wedding day. Then the lights go out. Nora checks online and finds that a storm will arrive today. Nora burns her cornea when she puts her contact lens in after cleaning it with facial defoliant. She chips her tooth on a bagel. She falls and sprains her ankle. When she goes to Roxy's to have her hair done, it comes out green. Meanwhile, a skunk is trapped in the church with Animal Control trying to catch it. The deodorizer causes the singer to lose her voice. Bo rallies Rex, John, Brody, and Matthew to help him get everything together to salvage the wedding. Then the skunk sprays Bo.",
        "Destiny advises Matthew to talk to Dani about his telling her he loves her right away, but he doesn't get around to it. Nate asks Dani out, but she tells him that she has a date with Matthew, that they are good, and that he said he loves her. Nate kisses her. Destiny is walking past the Buenos Dias and sees them.",
        "Rex and Gigi return from their trip and inform Shane that his grandmother was Hopi Indian but that she is dead now. He explains that she gave Rex up because she thought Rex's father was dead. Viki is pleased that both of her daughters have reunited with their men. Roxy says the only thing that could be better is if Rex and Gigi get back together. Brody calls Natalie and tells her he thinks they should keep quiet about sleeping together. Brody slips and mentions seeing Natalie the night John missed her at the airport. He says Natalie stopped by to say goodbye. John thanks him for being a friend to Natalie."

        "Nora: [Chuckles] Mmm. What time is it?",
        "Bo: It's time to get married.",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Nora: [Chuckles] Mmm. Hmm, I love that time of the morning.",
        "Bo: Oh, you love it, huh?",
        "Nora: Madly. Oh, the only way that this day could be more perfect is if Rachel were here, and not in Chicago with a stomach flu.",
        "Bo: Well, she's going to be here in spirit.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I know. Well, it -- it really is going to be a perfect day.",

        "Shane: You're back! Grandma, quick! Flush the R-rated movies!",
        "Shane: [Chuckles] Kidding. Welcome back.",
        "Gigi: Hi, sweetie. Oh, my goodness. You're, like, as tall as me. I think you grew a whole inch while we were gone.",
        "Shane: I could have. Who says junk food isn't good for you?",
        "Rex: Not me.",
        "Gigi: What's up with the sleeping bags, huh?",
        "Shane: Well, we had an indoor campout since Grandma hates nature.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, I really do. So, how was the extraterrestrial territory?",
        "Shane: Whoa! What, Grandma?",
        "Roxy: Oh, baby, New Mexico -- it's known for UFO's, alien abductions, and those people, the Ashkenazis.",
        "Gigi: I think you mean \"Anasazi,\" the ancient tribe that lived there.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, them. [Whispering] Aliens. So how'd your trip go?",
        "Shane: Yeah, Dad. Did you find your bio parents?",
        "Roxy: Oh, parents, shmarents. I want to know about you. Did you get it back together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Natalie: Uh -- guys, I need to take this. You know what? Go on in without me.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Natalie: Hey, Brody, it -- I've been trying to reach you.",
        "Brody: Yeah, I know. We still have to get this thing that happened between us straightened out.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, before we all end up together at Bo and Nora's wedding.",
        "Brody: Yeah. And I'm still thinking we can't tell John or Jessica that we slept together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I do not believe that Markko Rivera could have tried to kill that man. I mean, the boy lived with us at Llanfair. He wouldn't hurt a fly.",
        "Jessica: Um, yeah, but Bo said that the evidence against him was pretty solid.",
        "Viki: I'm sorry; I think there must be some mistake.",
        "Officer: This just came back from the lab. It's new evidence in the Ford case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Well, I'm going to be busy with my best man duties, but once I'm done with my toast, we could probably hang out.",
        "Dani: That's okay. I'll be fine.",
        "Matthew: You still want to come, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The storm that they predicted was going to go over there is now coming right for us.",
        "Bo: Okay, okay. What's the E.T.A.?",
        "Nora: Wedding time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Yeah, of course I'm still coming to your parents' wedding. We made a date.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it's just -- you know, what I said after prom to you --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Matthew: Look, I got to go. It's hectic right now with the wedding and everything.",
        "Dani: No problem.",
        "Matthew: All right, I'll see you later.",
        "Dani: Bye.",
        "Destiny: Did you see this about Markko?",
        "Matthew: Oh, I know. It's crazy. One second we tell Markko that you saw Langston kissing that Ford guy, and the next, Markko tries to kill him.",
        "Destiny: I tried to lie, but he had us on tape talking about it.",
        "Matthew: Well, how were we supposed to know that the camera was on?",
        "Destiny: What the hell was I thinking? I should have just kept my big mouth shut.",
        "Matthew: Well, you can't help what you saw. You just told the truth. Besides, it ended up being a lot more than just one kiss.",
        "Destiny: Poor Markko, walking in on them. Can you imagine?",
        "Matthew: He probably lost it.",
        "Destiny: Jealousy's a killer, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: You waiting for somebody?",
        "Dani: Just writing a paper.",
        "Nate: Looks more like you were reading the paper. It's crazy about what happened to Langston's boyfriend, right?",
        "Dani: God, I know. But my mom's his lawyer, so, you know, he'll get his vigorous defense.",
        "Nate: Oh, I like when you talk lawyer speak. Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.",
        "Dani: No, it's okay. It's okay. I guess when you're raised by a defense attorney, you can start to sound like one. Who knows? Maybe I could represent Markko.",
        "Nate: Yeah?",
        "Dani: No, he's probably better off with my mom. She got Todd out on bail after he pushed a pregnant woman down the stairs.",
        "Nate: So do you think Markko did it?",
        "Dani: I don't know. I mean, he always seems so gentle.",
        "Nate: Yeah, but we do wild stuff when we can't get the one that we love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: We thought that we lost the people we loved, Brody. We were lonely and drunk, and we fell into bed. And we didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Brody: So nobody needs to know. Hey, I'm going to talk to you about this later. I just want to be sure Jessica doesn't get hurt.",
        "John: Everything okay?",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "John: Well, I just -- I thought I heard you say something about Jessica getting hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Everything okay?",
        "Natalie: Uh, yeah.",
        "Viki: Was that John on the phone?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, we were just planning where we were going to meet to go to the wedding.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Natalie: So, have you decided what you're going to do with your hair if Roxy ever gets here?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I think it's so nice that you stepped up as Nora's maid of honor.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. It was my pleasure. I'm so happy that Bo and Nora finally found their way back to each other.",
        "Natalie: Just like you and Charlie.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: And I am so happy that both of my incredibly beautiful girls have found their way back to the men that they love, hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So did you hook up in the hotel room? Did you raid the mini fridge?",
        "Shane: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la --",
        "Roxy: Listen to Barry White --",
        "Rex: No mini fridge, no Barry White. The search for my folks was pretty time- consuming.",
        "Shane: Did you find them?",
        "Rex: Yes and no.",
        "Gigi: It's a pretty long story.",
        "Roxy: Well, hit me with those deets later. Bo and Nora are getting hitched. And without my magical touch, that wedding is going to be a disaster.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Well, at least the flowers are here. They were delivered to the church last night.",
        "Bo: Just relax, Red. Everything's going to be just fine.",
        "Nora: Oh, God. Andrew -- Andrew -- do you think that he -- do you think his plane took off? Do you think he made it?",
        "Bo: Ooh. You know, my mind-reading skills aren't what they used to be.",
        "Nora: Oh, Bo!",
        "Bo: No, come on. Honey, I'm sure Andrew would have called if he hadn't left yet.",
        "Nora: Okay. It's just with all the rain coming our way, you know, everything -- oh.",
        "Bo: Would you relax, Red? Come on. It's a summer storm.",
        "Nora: Summer storm? Look at this. There are -- hurricane force winds they're predicting, and power outages and downed trees and disastrous wedding day.",
        "Bo: Nothing is going to make this day any less than perfect. I won't allow it.",
        "Nora: You're right.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: This is going to be perfect. I'm even happier this time than I was the first time.",
        "Bo: Ah. See, that's because I've aged, like a fine bourbon.",
        "Nora: [Laughs] Yes, that's it. And also because I know what it's like to live without you.",
        "Bo: Never have to think about that again.",
        "Nora: I love you. Ooh, I got to get to Foxy Roxy's. You do not want your bride looking like an old dishrag.",
        "Bo: Never happen.",
        "Nora: I got to go, I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Dani's still coming to the wedding, right?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. She keeps pretending like I didn't tell her I love her. You were right. That was the stupidest thing I could have ever done.",
        "Destiny: I'm sorry I said that to you. I keep saying the wrong things to the wrong people.",
        "Matthew: Stop blaming yourself for what happened between Langston and Markko.",
        "Destiny: I'm the one that needed to keep my mouth shut, not you.",
        "Matthew: Well, you were pretty much right on the money.",
        "Destiny: No, I wasn't. It's not stupid to tell someone how you feel about them.",
        "Matthew: Well, what if she doesn't feel the same about me?",
        "Destiny: It hurts for a little while, but it gets better. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. You know, you should call Dani right now and clear up this whole \"I love you\" thing.",
        "Matthew: N -- today, now?",
        "Destiny: That way, you won't have to worry about it at your dad's wedding. You know you will. Call her. I'll stay, so I'll be here for you, no matter what the answer is.",
        "Matthew: I'm lucky you're still my friend.",
        "Destiny: Yeah, you are.",
        "[Matthew chuckles]",
        "Destiny: Do you need me to dial for you?",
        "Matthew: No, I'm -- I'm okay.",
        "Bo: Hey, guys! How's my best man doing?",
        "Matthew: Great. How's the groom doing?",
        "Bo: Couldn't be better.",
        "Destiny: Mr. B, is it okay if I bring a date to the wedding?",
        "Matthew: Darren?",
        "Destiny: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, sure. You know, the more, the merrier. This is going to be the perfect wedding for my perfect bride.",
        "Nora: Ow! Oh! Ow, ow! Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well, we had trouble getting any info on my folks at first, so then your mom and I did something a little crazy. We -- we broke into this --",
        "Gigi: Cold -- a cold sweat. We broke into a cold sweat. 'Cause I'll tell you, it was pretty intense. But you know what? Then this nice woman named Penny -- she led us to this stack of letters that your dad's parents wrote to each other.",
        "Shane: Well, that doesn't sound so crazy.",
        "Rex: Well, when you're out in alien country, everything looks a little weird.",
        "Shane: Can I read the letters?",
        "Gigi: When you're older.",
        "Shane: Why? Are they R-rated?",
        "Gigi: The only thing you really need to know, sweetie, is that your grandfather loved your grandmother very much, but he was forced to leave before he knew she was pregnant.",
        "Shane: So, like you and Dad?",
        "Rex: Uh, yeah, a little. But when my mom went to look for my dad so that she could show me to him, a bad man told her that he was dead.",
        "Shane: What?",
        "Rex: And when my mom found out that the man she loved so much was gone forever, she was so devastated, she left me in that hospital.",
        "Shane: The one that Allison Perkins stole you from?",
        "Rex: Yeah. And then my mom died.",
        "Shane: I'm sorry. But if your dad isn't dead, then where is he?",
        "Rex: We don't know. Your mom and I did a search for him online, but we didn't get back any response.",
        "Shane: Maybe you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Boy, oh, boy.",
        "Bo: It's okay, I'm here.",
        "Nora: Oh, God.",
        "Matthew: Are you okay, Mom?",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Matthew: What the heck happened?",
        "Nora: Oh, I used my exfoliating toner on my contact lenses instead of my lens solution. Oh.",
        "Destiny: Ouch.",
        "Bo: Look, I'm going to get the car. Somebody's got to take a look at this.",
        "Nora: No, no, no. I'm going to be fine, I'm going to be fine. Do I smell food?",
        "Matthew: I couldn't sleep, so I got bagels and coffee.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. You are such an amazing child.",
        "Bo: He is great.",
        "Nora: Yeah, just like his dad.",
        "Bo: Aw.",
        "Nora: He just doesn't get any better than this.",
        "Matthew: Cream cheese and walnut, your favorite.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. That's absolutely perfect. Ungh! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh. You're right. This is a perfect day. Ow. Oh, my tooth. Hmm. [Mumbling]",
        "Bo: Red? Now, what --",
        "Nora: Ooh.",
        "Bo: What happened?",
        "Nora: I think I chipped my tooth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Enough of this.",
        "Jessica: You're actually throwing out a newspaper?",
        "Viki: Well, I expect Roxy recycles.",
        "Jessica: Uh-uh.",
        "Viki: Okay. Ahem. In any case, I don't want our day ruined by this very unfortunate story.",
        "Jessica: It is unfortunate.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: I don't know.",
        "Viki: You don't know? You don't think so?",
        "Natalie: I mean, you know, I guess no one deserves that, but I heard this guy was a real dog. Did you ever run into him? He lives with Cristian, right?",
        "Jessica: Uh, yeah, I ran into him.",
        "Natalie: Did he hit on you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Jessica's fine.",
        "John: Good.",
        "Brody: Any change in Ford's condition?",
        "John: No, but we did get something back from the lab. Those traces of blood we found in the sink at Buenos Dias -- definitely Robert Ford's.",
        "Brody: Yeah, Rivera crashed at the diner that night. He probably tried to clean himself up after he attacked Ford.",
        "John: Yeah. Also got the names of a couple more women that this guy was involved with. Apparently, he got around.",
        "Brody: Yeah, tell me about it. Layla told me he even hit on Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You know, Mom said that she didn't want to spoil our day talking about Robert Ford, so we shouldn't.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. He totally put the moves on you.",
        "Jessica: It was no big deal.",
        "Natalie: Jessica, you thought you were in high school. I mean, that's -- that's pretty wrong. You were pretty vulnerable.",
        "Viki: That man could easily have taken advantage of you, honey.",
        "Roxy: Okay! Who's ready for kamikaze makeover?",
        "Natalie: Uh, kamikaze?",
        "Viki: I think that's a little extreme.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Rox, we were just looking for some wedding do's.",
        "Roxy: Don't worry, I'm just talking about a drink. A little vodka, some lime juice, triple 6. You know, something a little to loosen up the bride a little bit. By the way, where is she? She's -- Nora was supposed to be here by now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I think there was a walnut shell in the cream cheese.",
        "Bo: Okay, but does it hurt? You know, let's get you to a dentist.",
        "Nora: No, no --",
        "Bo: Come on.",
        "Nora: No, I'm sure it's just a -- it's just a chipped tooth, I'm sure. I'm sure it's nothing.",
        "Bo: Well --",
        "Nora: You know, I'm going to go give it a look-see, all right? I'll be fine.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nora: I'll be fine.",
        "Bo: Oh, jeez -- Buchanan? Yeah.",
        "Destiny: That can't be good.",
        "Bo: All right, all right, all right.",
        "[Hangs up phone]",
        "Bo: We got to get to the church.",
        "Matthew: Is something wrong?",
        "Bo: Well, the singer showed up and now she wants us there right away.",
        "Nora: Oh, no!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I just hope they don't cancel the play after all that work we put in.",
        "Dani: I hate to break it to you, but I doubt the show's going to go on. I mean, Cole and Markko are in jail.",
        "Nate: It's not like they're in it.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but that's not exactly the happy ending Langston wrote.",
        "Nate: Oh. It's a play, not a documentary.",
        "Dani: I don't think that's how parents are going to see it. And they probably won't let us play characters based on people who commit murder.",
        "Nate: Um, all of Shakespeare?",
        "Dani: I guess it's fine when you're in tights, but when it's about the here and now -- I mean, the PTA had to be talked into letting \"Starr Crossed Lovers\" happen in the first place. And now --",
        "Nate: It's not fair.",
        "Dani: Totally.",
        "Nate: You know, I am going to miss the stuff we were doing on stage when we were playing Cole and Starr.",
        "Dani: Yeah. We did have a lot to do. Even the dancing was okay.",
        "Nate: Yeah. The kissing was, too.",
        "Dani: Um, I'm not really getting any work done.",
        "Nate: Then you should ditch the paper and come swimming with me at the quarry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh, no, no, no, no \u0096",
        "Bo: Oh, no, honey -- honey, look, it can't be as bad as you say it is.",
        "Matthew: Come on, Mom, let us see.",
        "Destiny: You might as well get a second opinion.",
        "[Nora whimpers]",
        "Bo: Hey, hey -- what's a little chipped tooth in a face this gorgeous, hmm?",
        "Bo: What'd I tell you? You can hardly even tell it happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: What is it? Is it for me?",
        "Rex: It turns out my mother was knitting that for me, but she never finished. I thought that it would be cool if you had it. That is an important symbol to our ancestors.",
        "Shane: Our ancestors? What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Your grandmother was Native American. Part of the Hopi tribe.",
        "Shane: We're part Hopi? Sweet. I heard about them in school. Their name means peaceful people, right?",
        "Gigi: That's right, it does.",
        "Shane: It's really awesome that you found some of your family, Dad.",
        "Rex: And this family right here is awesome, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: All our evidence against Rivera is still circumstantial.",
        "Brody: Okay, but it's strong. We have motive. He caught his girlfriend with the vic. We have means. We have the weapon.",
        "John: No prints yet.",
        "Brody: Okay, but we also have opportunity. Nobody can alibi the kid's whereabouts at the time of Ford's attack. Well, plus, we got a bloody shoeprint, matching shoes we can prove are Markko's, and Ford's blood in the sink where we know Rivera was staying that night.",
        "John: Yeah, but --",
        "Brody: What? What are you thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Who knew that our little Nattie was a Cyrano de burger-ac? I mean, when I got through reading that letter to Johnny, it was like cupid himself had hit me right in the butt. I mean, not that he wasn't crazy about her before. [Chuckles]",
        "Natalie: I actually think that Roxy channeled her inner Viki and she convinced me that I needed to be honest with John about how I felt.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, kind of like good cop, bad cop. You know, that can't hurt nobody. Kind of like Foxy Roxy cop and Viki cop.",
        "Viki: Well, whatever. I'm very grateful to you. If it hadn't been for your intervention, Roxy, Natalie would've wound up in London.",

Now, I'm not gonna lie to you, gentlemen. The odds are against us. Because sometimes the universe just lines up against you and everything that you really care about is on the other side. And what do you do? Do you lay down and give up, or do you continue to fight with everything you've got? Now, we can do this. For honor, for glory, for family, and for love, and -- for Nora.",
