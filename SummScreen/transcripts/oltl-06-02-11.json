        "John, Brody, and Shaun all know that Todd Manning and Tomas Delgado have some sort of secret regarding why Todd first believed Tom\u00e1s tried to kill him, which they also believe, and then Todd suddenly invites Tomas to live in his home. Todd and Tomas hide Marty and baby Liam knowing that if they don't, she can expose their secret. Tomas reveals to Todd that Patrick Thornhart, Marty's \"believed\" deceased husband, is alive. Natalie then struggles to get out of her hospital bed although she can barely walk. Joey is done with Aubrey reluctantly agreeing to stay married to her only in the interest of baby Ryder so he does not get put in foster care. And he assures Kelly that as soon as Jessica gets better and gets her baby back, he will be done with Aubrey and ready to devote his life to Kelly. Aubrey runs into Robert Ford who is not going to let her raise his child when he knows that her marriage is a fraud. But she tells him if he refrains from making trouble for her, she will let him see baby Ryder without Joey or anyone knowing. Original Todd regains his memory when guards are ready to kill him when they find that out. He knocks out a guard and escapes unseen. Patrick Thornhart is a \"neighbor\" of his in the same institution."

        "Todd: I have a daughter, and her name is Starr. Starr has a mother. Her name is Blair. Blair was my wife. Oh... I had another wife. Her name was T\u00e9a. Aah! I raped a woman. Her name is Marty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie's voice: You spilled it all to your shrink. It's over, Marty. You're done. Aah!",
        "Natalie: The tape.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: [Gasps] Ha ha ha! I didn't even hear you come in.",
        "Joey: Yeah. That's because somebody was too busy ignoring doctor's orders.",
        "Kelly: No, no, no. I'm just polishing a little article for the \"Sun.\"",
        "Joey: It's called work, Kelly, and it's supposed to be off limits.",
        "Kelly: Yes. I'm trying to write an article about Marty's attack on me. It's actually kind of therapeutic.",
        "Joey: Yeah. Well, whatever it is, it seems to be working, ok? You seem a lot stronger than the last time I saw you.",
        "Kelly: When you admitted that I was right about Aubrey all along?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: We need to get a few things straight.",
        "Aubrey: Are you following us?",
        "Ford: You and your so-called husband can't change my son's address without telling me first.",
        "Aubrey: Ford, relax.",
        "Ford: I went looking for you at Asa Buchanan's mansion, and Cutter Wentworth was there, and he couldn't wait to tell me that you two don't live there anymore. Now, what the hell is going on?",
        "Aubrey: We moved to Llanfair to be closer to Joey's mother.",
        "Ford: That's a lie, just like all the other lies you've been telling ever since you showed up here, but I promise you, Aubrey, when the truth finally does come out, Ryder is gonna end up with me, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Mr. Manning? Mr. Manning? Mrs. Manning? Mr. Delgado? Where are you people?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What happened?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You asked me to take care of Marty Saybrooke, so that's what I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Monsieur Calmar? Well, I'm surprised to see you out and about.",
        "Claude: I beg your pardon?",
        "Blair: Well, Tom\u00e1s was so worried about you last night when he got the call. He made it sound like you were at death's door.",
        "Claude: Ah, yes. As it turned out, what seemed serious at first was nothing to worry about.",
        "Blair: Well, good. I'm glad to see you're ok.",
        "Claude: Thanks to Tom\u00e1s. He made sure I was seen by an excellent doctor and then saw me back to my hotel. There is no better friend in a crisis, yes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What did you do?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Well, if you thought I was gonna kill Marty Saybrooke for you, forget it. All I did was make sure she didn't go anywhere.",
        "Todd: I don't suppose you got her to tell you where she stashed the disk, did you?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No. She's keeping that information to herself.",
        "Todd: You know, Tom\u00e1s, if you hadn't made the damn disk in the first place, she wouldn't be holding it over our heads this way, threatening to go to the authorities, blow our lives apart.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Why don't we concentrate on the more immediate problem? That baby in there needs to be with his mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Look so much like your daddy. Pretty soon, John will know he is your daddy. Not yet, though. He's probably still upset about Natalie. When the time is right, John will find out he has a son, after all, and he will be so happy. Probably wonder who changed the DNA test, but he'll never find out it was me. No one will, unless they find that tape.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah. I just chased down another false lead on Marty. Yeah. Yeah. All I know is, the longer she's missing, the more desperate she gets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I have a daughter. Her name is Starr. Starr has a mother. Her name is Blair.",
        "Baker: It's time.",
        "Todd: Blair was my wife.",
        "Baker: If he ever had the information, it's gone. There's no reason to keep him alive anymore. Take him downstairs and get rid of him.",
        "Todd: ...T\u00e9a, and... my name is Todd. I raped a woman. Her name was Marty.",
        "Kent: This must be your punishment, then. Let's go. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claude: I didn't mean to take Tom\u00e1s away from you last night.",
        "Blair: Really? You sure? Weren't you the one that warned me not to get mixed up with him?",
        "Claude: Well, that's because I was afraid you were only--how do you say? Leading him on to find out if he tried to kill your ex-husband, but things have changed since then, hmm?",
        "Blair: Well, I shouldn't have been so quick to believe Todd when he said he saw Tom\u00e1s at the crime scene. I feel badly about that.",
        "Claude: Tom\u00e1s seems to have forgiven you. As for me, I'm glad he's found someone who makes him so happy. Friends?",
        "Blair: Friends. So as a friend, can I ask you a question?",
        "Claude: Of course.",
        "Blair: Why is there a CIA file on Tom\u00e1s?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Tess told me just part of your grand scheme to take the Buchanans for all they're worth, which makes your marriage to Joey about as phony as everything else about you. So unless you want Joey to find out, you better convince him to give me my son back.",
        "Aubrey: Ha ha!",
        "Ford: You think this is funny? We'll see who's laughing when you get kicked out of his house.",
        "Aubrey: Joey cares.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: I found out that Cutter wasn't her brother and that she --",
        "Kelly: What? Now, that's it?",
        "Joey: Yes.",
        "Kelly: Pbbt! She was this close to me, but I beat her to the punch.",
        "Kelly: You know, I seriously have to hand it to her. She will try anything.",
        "Joey: Yeah. No kidding. She actually wanted to start over, clean slate, like we could have a real marriage now.",
        "Kelly: What'd you say?",
        "Joey: I told her it was impossible, because I had a different idea.",
        "Kelly: Like what?",
        "Joey: Like begging you for another chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah. I'm heading back to the station now.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry things didn't work out at Todd's. I really thought he might be hiding Marty.",
        "John: You talk to Natalie?",
        "Brody: I'm at the hospital now. I'll let her know how everything stands. Just wish I had better news.",
        "John: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "[Coin drops]",
        "Roxy: Johnny! Johnny, please tell me that you found my grandkid, please.",
        "John: Yeah. We're working on it, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Oh, poor Natty. She didn't get a wink of sleep last night. She must be going out of her mind.",
        "John: I know.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but you're probably going out of your mind, also, because I know how much you care about her, and that never stopped, and she's totally nuts about you, and she always has been. So what if the last thing she remembers before that sicko threw her off the roof is kissing Brody. That doesn't change...uh, anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Natalie: Is there any news?",
        "Brody: Trail always gets colder at night. You know that. We'll have better luck now that it's daylight.",
        "Natalie: Brody, don't. I know that you're just trying to keep me from panicking, but this has got to be hard on you, too.",
        "Brody: I'm ok. I'm ok. We're gonna find him.",
        "Natalie: At least Delphina says that he's alive, even if you don't believe in psychics.",
        "Brody: Doesn't mean she's wrong about Liam.",
        "Natalie: I just keep thinking about what else Delphina said, that Marty and I were fighting up on the roof.",
        "Brody: Yeah? And it doesn't take a psychic to figure out that there was probably a fight before she pushed you.",
        "Natalie: But I got to remember what we were fighting about.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, it was like a memory. We were up on the roof, and we were fighting, and I had this tape recorder with Marty's therapy session in it, the one I took from the shrink's office, and then when she saw me with it, she freaked. Do you think that really happened?",
        "Brody: I don't know.",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Maybe that's what we were fighting about, and if it was, then you're his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: We have to come up with a solution to keep that baby safe.",
        "Todd: We need to keep ourselves safe. Otherwise, we're no use to the baby.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: It's not just any baby in there. It belongs to your niece. He's part of your family.",
        "Todd: Eh, I don't have time to babysit right now. He's not the only thing at stake.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah. I'm aware of that.",
        "Todd: The information on that disk gets out, our lives as we know it is over, and I like my life. I have people I care about, and it you don't, that's your problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I have a daughter. Her name is Starr. Starr has a mother. Her name is Blair. Blair was my wife. I have another wife. Her name is T\u00e9a. Whoa. No, no. I remember.",
        "Kent: You remember what?",
        "Todd: I remember. I remember what you want, what you want.",
        "Kent: What?",
        "Todd: I know who I gave it to.",
        "Kent: Who? Who'd you give it to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: We can make it work this time, Kel. We really could, you know, if you're willing to give me a shot.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I don't know.",
        "Joey: What, you don't know if you're willing, or you don't know whether or not to take me seriously?",
        "Kelly: No. I take you very seriously. Last time you were here, your apology, that was huge to me.",
        "Joey: Ok, and I meant every word.",
        "Kelly: Good, because I hated being the enemy. When you thought I didn't want to see you happy, I just--",
        "Joey: I can't believe I said those things to you, ok? I am so sorry.",
        "Kelly: I believe that, and knowing that you were sorry, that just made me feel like I could breathe again, but I think I'm still figuring out how.",
        "Joey: Ok, and if you need any time at all, any time--look at me--it's ok because I know I'm asking you a lot.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I just guess I didn't think about what would happen when you threw Aubrey out. That's-- you did throw her out.",
        "Joey: Kelly, I wanted to. Ok. I told her it was over and I wanted nothing to do with her, but then she brought up the whole thing about custody.",
        "Kelly: Wait, with Jessica's son?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Look. If Aubrey and I don't stay married, then we lose custody of Ryder, and then what happens to him? What, does he just go and get chewed up by the system, bounced around in foster care? Look. I'm not gonna let that happen to him or to Jess.",
        "Kelly: So you and Aubrey are staying married.",
        "Joey: For now, but, Kelly, you need to know, this is a marriage in name only.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: So Joey finds out that his wife married him just to get her hands on his money, and she's been cheating on him with a guy who's supposed to be her brother, and he doesn't care?",
        "Aubrey: Ford, I fell in love with Joey. It wasn't part of the plan, but it happened. That's why he forgives me.",
        "Ford: Well, then he's a lot dumber than I thought.",
        "Aubrey: I'm not the same person I used to be. Joey knows that.",
        "Ford: Whatever. Doesn't change the fact that your marriage is still a fraud, and I can't wait to see how the judge rules when he finds that out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claude: There's a CIA file on Tom\u00e1s, our Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Blair: I figured you would know that, considering how long you guys have been friends.",
        "Claude: I've never heard about such a file. What has Tom\u00e1s said?",
        "Blair: He just told me to trust him.",
        "Claude: Good advice.",
        "Blair: Ah. My order is ready. See you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I don't want the situation to get any more out of control than it already has.",
        "Todd: Then you better come up with a way to get out of it. Cops have already been here looking for her. If they show up with a warrant...",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Todd: And she's still here, I think we're in trouble.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What is it?",
        "Claude: We have a situation.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I can't talk right now. I'll call you back later. I need time to consider the options, so why don't you deal with her for a while?",
        "Marty: Hush little baby don't you cry yeah. Hi. I'm gonna need some more supplies for Liam soon.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Marty, I think the baby is gonna need more than bottles and diapers.",
        "Marty: Well--",
        "Todd: This is no place to raise a baby.",
        "Marty: Ok. Well, if you want to move us to the main house--",
        "Todd: No, no, no. That's not what I meant. Marty, you can't go on like this. This baby needs a mother.",
        "Marty: I'm a good mother. You were gonna raise a baby with me once.",
        "Todd: Yeah. That's right. That was a mistake. Yeah. I should've never kept Hope from Starr, and you shouldn't keep this one from its mother, either.",
        "Marty: Yeah, but there's a difference. Starr was alive. Natalie is dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I had the tape at the house, and I was about to listen to it when you showed up, and we got distracted, and that's where my memory ends, ok, and so for all I know, I actually did listen to the tape, and there's got to be something really important on there.",
        "Brody: We didn't find anything, Natalie--no tape, no recorder.",
        "Natalie: Well, then what did that dream mean?",
        "Brody: Maybe it was just a dream.",
        "Natalie: No. The more I think about it, the more I know that I listened to that tape, and there was something on there that Marty didn't want me to hear.",
        "Brody: Like what?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Maybe she was planning on kidnapping Liam all along. Maybe there's a clue on there that says where she took him. I don't know. Maybe there's something else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Forget about that anything thing that I said. That was totally irreverent.",
        "John: I think you mean \"irrelevant.\"",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Whatever. Brody and Natalie kissing, you know, that was something that Madame Delphina came up with, and she's, like, a two-bit psychic. I mean, what the hell does she know? But I did go to her so she could find out where Liam might be, and she was doing real good on that, and then all of a sudden, she got sidetracked.",
        "John: With Brody and Natalie. Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Look. Brody might be Liam's daddy, but you're the one that Natalie loves, so don't even think about--",
        "John: You know what, Roxy? I got to go. I got to get back to work.",
        "Roxy: Ok. Oh, Roxy, stupid. So stupid, Roxy. Oh, it's gonna be a miracle if Johnny and Natty ever get back together again. Whoa. Heads. Ooh. Wow, look at this. This must be my lucky day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kent: Was it John McBain? Did you give it to him? Was it John McBain? Tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: So you think if the judge questions my marriage to Joey, he will just hand Ryder over to you.",
        "Ford: Why not?",
        "Aubrey: He already decided you were an unfit parent.",
        "Ford: That was when I was married to Tess. That's no longer the case.",
        "Aubrey: Right. So you guys had your little marriage of convenience, then ditched each other the second you could. What does that say about your character?",
        "Ford: You're lecturing me about character? This coming from the woman with dollar signs in her eyes?",
        "Aubrey: I would love Joey if he didn't have a dime, but luckily, he has the means to take good care of Ryder, which is more than most people could say for you.",
        "Ford: I could provide for my son. Don't you worry about that.",
        "Aubrey: Your son is happy and healthy. If you take this to court, he could end up in foster care. Is that what you want?",
        "Ford: Either way, he's without his father, and now that Tess is out of the picture, I'm thinking the judge might have second thoughts. So I'm gonna take my chances.",
        "Aubrey: No. Wait.",
        "Ford: Let go.",
        "Aubrey: You can't talk to the judge. If we lose Ryder, I lose Joey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Look. We may be staying at Llanfair, but it's not a marriage if you sleep in different rooms.",
        "Kelly: Wait a minute. Did you just say Llanfair?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Yeah. We moved.",
        "Kelly: Why?",
        "Joey: Long story. Cutter-- Cutter made a deal with my dad, ok? In return for getting Jessica to St. Ann's for treatment, Cutter got a boatload of money and Asa's mansion.",
        "Kelly: What?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Nice guy, huh?",
        "Kelly: Wait. How does he get away with that?",
        "Joey: I know. I know. I will think of some creative way to get him back later, but for now, Jessica is getting the treatment that she needs so she can get better and return to us...",
        "Kelly: Oh, yeah. No. Thank God.",
        "Joey: And when she's fully integrated and she can have Ryder back, then my marriage is over, ok, and, Kelly, I'm free, and I can be yours, all right, if you'll have me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Hey, Lieutenant, what's going on?",
        "John: Hey, man, I've had better mornings.",
        "Shaun: No answers on the kidnapping?",
        "John: No. Nothing yet. You still working for Manning?",
        "Shaun: I'm doing my best. Since he cleared Tom\u00e1s Delgado of all charges, he figures the shooter is still out there. So he keeps me on the payroll.",
        "John: Let me ask you something. You ever seen anything around the house, around the grounds that might indicate that Marty Saybrooke has been there?",
        "Shaun: With the baby, you mean.",
        "John: I know it's a stretch, but anything is possible. Do me a favor. Keep your eyes open for me.",
        "Shaun: I'd like to, but Mr. Manning has got me combing the streets instead of watching the place I should be protecting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Sorry I couldn't talk before. What's wrong?",
        "Claude: I just ran into Blair. She seemed to think you spent the night nursing me back to health.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Sorry about that.",
        "Claude: I played along, told her I was feeling better, but why the lie, my friend?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I told you before, I had to use leverage with Todd to make him change his statement about seeing me at the crime scene. I put some information on a disk. Unfortunately, it's fallen into the wrong hands.",
        "Claude: I warned you, Tom\u00e1s. Some secrets can't stay buried. Blair was asking--",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Hey, Blair, I was just trying to call you.",
        "Blair: You were? You left the keys in the door.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Thanks. Yeah. I wanted to apologize for having to rush off last night. Turns out, Calmar wasn't as sick as I thought.",
        "Blair: Well, I figured when I saw him scarfing down his breakfast over at the Buenos Dias.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah? Oh, he's a bit of a hypochondriac. I guess I should've remembered that before I let him tear me away from you.",
        "Blair: Well, actually, I'm kind of glad he did. It kept me from making a very big mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Brody, if I did have that tape up on the roof and the roof was searched and it wasn't there, then that means Marty has got it.",
        "Brody: You don't know that.",
        "Natalie: What happened when you questioned Todd? You said that maybe he had information about Marty.",
        "Brody: Did what I could to get some answers, and I searched the house. There was no sign of Marty. John went over. He didn't get anything. What are you doing?",
        "Natalie: No. Todd is gonna give me the answers.",
        "Brody: No. Natalie, no. You are not going over there.",
        "Natalie: Brody, if Todd has answers about my son, our son, I am not gonna spend another minute in this bed lying here. I am gonna go get answers right now.",
        "Brody: The hell you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Little beat up, but let's see if it works. Let's see what kind of music is on it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Roxy: Hey, Brody, what's up?",
        "Brody: I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What? Why are you looking at me like that? All I'm saying is, since Natalie is dead, we might--",
        "Todd: She's not dead. She's alive.",

I'm talking about who you are--same gorgeous, brilliant, funny, sexy woman that I fell in love with all those years ago--and you were right there, so brave to give me your heart, and instead of getting down on my knees and thanking you, I pushed you away.",
        "Kelly: Joey, you don't need to do this.",
        "Joey: Yes, I do. I need you to know why, all right? I was scared of getting another shot, scared of blowing it again, you know, but I didn't know what real fear was. Real fear was standing in that E.R., and watching the life drain out of you and not being able to do a damn thing about it, and that's when I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.",

        "John: So why is Manning letting him live with him?",

I have a tendency to jump in, and before I even open my eyes, well, the damage has been done, and I don't want us to be like that. I want us to be different. I want us to really work.",
