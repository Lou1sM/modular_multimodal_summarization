    "Transcript": [
        "Viki: [As Jean] This house is completely surrounded by police, so you have no means of escape. Your only option is to accept my help. Now, will you please open the door and let me in?",
        "Bess: Looks like Victoria dusted off the renowned Jean Randolph. She must really be desperate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Ahh! There's ten dollars and a bus pass in my back pocket. I swear that's all I got.",
        "Schuyler: I don't want your money. I want your blood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: It just feels so weird making you do this for me.",
        "Rex: Stacy, I'm getting you magazines and comfort food. It's no big deal.",
        "Stacy: You already gave me your bed.",
        "Rex: I don't mind sleeping in Shane's room. What? He has superhero sheets.",
        "[Stacy chuckles]",
        "Rex: Stacy, you got punched in the face trying to save me some money. You wanna eat pork rinds in bed, read magazines, I'm going to make it happen.",
        "Stacy: You lost twenty thousand dollars because of me.",
        "Rex: I just hope that that creep Stan is out of your life now.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, he better.",
        "Rex: Because I don't want to see a scratch on that beautiful face of yours ever again. Okay, last call, anything else?",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, I forgot, ice cream.",
        "Rex: Can't do bed rest without that. What flavor?",
        "Stacy: Rum raisin, please?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Rex: Nothing. It's just -- that was Gigi's favorite kind, too.",
        "Stacy: Well, the similarities definitely end there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Oh, Marcie, thank God. Just what I needed, a friendly face.",
        "Marcie: Why, did something happen?",
        "Gigi: Besides wanting to strangle my screwed up sister, nothing. But forget that. I want to hear about you. Red or white.",
        "Marcie: Oh, white, that actually sounds really good.",
        "Gigi: Start talking.",
        "Marcie: Well, I don't really know where to begin. I don't know whether to cry or laugh.",
        "Gigi: What happened?",
        "Marcie: The baby I was supposed to adopt from Starr Manning --",
        "Gigi: The one who died?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, she's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Whew. Oh, it's really coming down.",
        "Clint: It sure is.",
        "Natalie: You cold?",
        "Clint: No, I'm okay. Where's Jared?",
        "Natalie: He's with the Brennans, keeping them company. And Uncle Bo is just getting the local police force up to speed, and Brody, they're checking on him, making sure he doesn't have a concussion. Charlie's with him.",
        "Clint: So, it's just you and me, waiting.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, there's, like, pretty much nothing else to do.",
        "Clint: God.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Clint: My daughter's life is at stake and the only damn thing I can do is pray that somebody else saves her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Yes, well, desperate times. That would be why I'm here.",
        "Bess: You and I don't gravitate towards happy occasions, do we?",
        "Viki: [As Jean] No, we don't. We have things to discuss. Are you going to allow me in?",
        "Bess: By all means. There's no reason this can't be civilized, or is there?",
        "Viki: [As Jean] This child appears to be perfectly healthy.",
        "Bess: Is that what everyone downstairs is concerned about? There's no reason to believe that I would harm Jessica's little girl.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] No, of course you wouldn't, not intentionally. Bess, there's no need for pretense here, you know. We're quite the same. We're gatekeepers. Which means you care about Chloe as much as I care about Jessica. Not at all.",
        "Bess: My job is to protect Jessica. If that entails taking care of a child, so be it.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Unless babysitting proves a bit too taxing for you, hmm? We are not mother figures. We're efficient. We keep things going. Children are not efficient. They're messy.",
        "Bess: The job is the job.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Hardly a ringing endorsement for motherhood. Although, I can think of two women who would jump at the chance to take care of this little girl and call her their own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: This is just crazy, what you've been through.",
        "Marcie: I know. I feel like the rug has just been pulled out from under me. I realize this in a good way.",
        "Gigi: So Jessica's baby was stillborn and she switched that baby's body with the baby you were going to adopt.",
        "Marcie: Yes.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, Marcie. I feel so bad for her.",
        "Marcie: No, I know. I -- I feel bad for her, too.",
        "Gigi: So, the baby's alive.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: So, does that mean that she's coming back?",
        "Marcie: I don't know. It could mean all sorts of things. But, you know, with Jessica and the baby missing, I just feel like right now there's no point in making any plans. I can't do it.",
        "Gigi: Do you want a refill?",
        "Marcie: Yes, please.",
        "Gigi: So no one has any idea where she is?",
        "Marcie: Well, Bo has a lead, but that's all we know, and it's driving me crazy to be honest.",
        "Gigi: Well, maybe Rex could help. I mean, tracking people down is a big part of his job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Are you going to be okay?",
        "Stacy: Sure.",
        "Rex: I will be back in flash.",
        "Stacy: Rex, would you mind locking the deadbolt while you're gone?",
        "Rex: You know, why don't I call the deli? See if they'll deliver.",
        "Stacy: At this hour? Look, don't listen to me. I'm just being a baby.",
        "Rex: Okay, but if you're scared --",
        "Stacy: I'll be fine.",
        "Rex: You're sure you'll be okay?",
        "Stacy: I'm sure Stan's long gone, and what else is there for me to be afraid of?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Don't hurt me, man.",
        "Schuyler: Ah, I can't make that promise unless you give me what I want.",
        "Kyle: Fine, whatever it is you want.",
        "Schuyler: Give me the bag of blood you ripped off, Kyle.",
        "Kyle: What are you talking about?",
        "Schuyler: Oh, don't -- don't you play me. I had a bag of Stacy Morasco's blood. It was in my fridge. You knew about it. Now it's gone. Say something.",
        "Kyle: I don't know anything about --",
        "Schuyler: Where's the blood?",
        "Kyle: If you'd just get off me, I swear to God.",
        "Schuyler: What are you going to do, tough guy? Huh?",
        "Oliver: He won't do anything, but I'll run you in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Now, come on, Brody. The EMT said you should lie down.",
        "Brody: I'm not lying down.",
        "Charlie: Well, you could have a concussion.",
        "Brody: I don't have a concussion, Charlie. Trust me; I've been blown up enough times to know.",
        "Charlie: Okay, well, maybe we should just humor them, then.",
        "Brody: How am I supposed to just kick back knowing Jessica's in trouble? I need to do something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Look, sometimes all you can do is pray for the best.",
        "Clint: You don't have to do this, you know.",
        "Natalie: Do what?",
        "Clint: Try to make me feel better.",
        "Natalie: Why? Because I can't or because you don't want me to?",
        "Clint: Because it's not your job to take care of me.",
        "Natalie: Well, whose job is it?",
        "Clint: Nobody's.",
        "Natalie: Really? Because I thought that, you know, everyone needed a little support now and then.",
        "Clint: Yeah, what I meant to say was it's not right to come to expect it from your children.",
        "Natalie: You know, I spent my entire childhood taking care of Roxy. You know, she'd get on a big drinking binge and I'd have to roll her into bed and make sure she was on her side because, you know, you didn't her throw up and then choke to death. And, I don't know, one night I was just, like, it hit me, and I said to her, \"Aren't you supposed to be putting me to bed?\" And you know what she said to me? She said, \"You're good at it. You're good at taking care of people.\" Yeah, I'm real good at it, you know? I just helped my sister right into losing her baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: This child should only have one mother, and that's Jessica. Anything else would result in Jessica knowing the truth, and that would invite disaster.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] That's faulty logic. I've used it myself. I assumed that all would be lost if a certain festering secret came to light, but I was wrong.",
        "Bess: Only because you failed. If you had succeeded, if you had achieved your purpose, Victoria would never have known that her father abused her, and she would have had a happier life. But you couldn't maintain control.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] You are aware that your secret is out, so you failed as well. I'm afraid there is no choice now but for Jessica to face the truth as Victoria did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: This freak jumps me out of nowhere, telling me he's looking for blood. I think he's trying to kill me.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah, or bust you for breaking into my place.",
        "Kyle: Oh, yeah -- yeah, right. Like you have any proof.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I don't have any proof of anything because you took it right out of my fridge.",
        "Oliver: Whoa, whoa, whoa, all right, what's he talking about?",
        "Kyle: I don't know what he's talking about. Obviously he's in the middle of some sort of psychotic episode.",
        "Schuyler: Do I look like I'm crazy to you, seriously?",
        "Kyle: Okay, fine, fine. I don't want to get this guy into any trouble, okay? I'm willing to let it go.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, that's very generous of you, Kyle.",
        "Oliver: Kyle, shouldn't you be a little more worried about your own legal troubles? Right now you got a lot of counts against you.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, exactly. So why would I go creating more for myself? Okay, fine, I won't press any charges if I get an apology.",
        "Schuyler: I'm sorry I accused you without proof. Next time I'll have some.",
        "Kyle: Hey, thanks for having my back, man.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, don't expect me to do it again.",
        "Kyle: Oh, come on, Fish. It's not like you believe that guy.",
        "Oliver: No, the one thing I do know, though, Kyle, is that I sure as hell don't believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I don't know why I didn't think of that, asking Rex for help. Should I call him? Or maybe you could just mention it to him when you see him again.",
        "Gigi: These days that's more if.",
        "Marcie: Oh, please tell me you're at least on speaking terms.",
        "Gigi: If by \"speaking,\" you mean yelling and name calling.",
        "Marcie: It's gotten that bad?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and I don't know what's worse, fighting with Rex or getting the silent treatment from my son.",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry, that must be awful. But don't you think that at some point you guys can work things out?",
        "Gigi: Maybe, I don't know.",
        "Marcie: Well, hey, everybody thought that hope was dead and there was no chance of me being able to adopt her, and now we're finding our way back to each other. So, who knows, maybe you and Rex can, too.",
        "Gigi: Do you know much you deserve some happiness?",
        "Marcie: Kinda, I guess.",
        "Gigi: Kind of? I was there when they took Tommy away from you.",
        "Marcie: You know, I see all of that much more clearly. I kidnapped him, Gigi. I took him away from his family.",
        "Gigi: But you were his family for a long time. You were his mom.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I mean, you know that loss, it almost killed me. And now Jessica's going through the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: What Jessica is dealing with right now is not your fault.",
        "Natalie: Because it's yours, right?",
        "Clint: It's different, so very different.",
        "Natalie: Why? Why are you responsible?",
        "Clint: Because I'm her father and I should have seen something. I should have known that Jessie was still sick.",
        "Natalie: But I did know, Dad, and I -- I didn't do a damn thing about it. Actually, no, that's not true. I did, I chose not to tell you and Mom about it. You and Mom, who could have probably done something. I mean, you have experience with D.I.D., and her doctor, I didn't tell her doctor. I didn't bring him in on it. I just -- I swept everything under the rug. And there's Starr and Cole and Marcie and Michael, they think that their baby's dead. And I've hurt all of these people. All of these people just so that my sister wouldn't have to deal with another loss.",
        "Clint: And I'm proud of you for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: [As Jean] I have to give you credit for a job well done.",
        "Bess: Thank you.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Until now.",
        "Bess: You think we've reached the end. I beg to differ.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Bess, don't lie to yourself. Your job is to be realistic.",
        "Bess: Taking care of Jessica is my responsibility. If I take your advice, all my hard work amounts to nothing.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] I think it's amounted to quite a bit.",
        "Bess: You expect me to just step aside and hope that Jessica is strong enough to face what might destroy her.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Yes, you have no other options. How long can you stay in this room? You have nowhere to go.",
        "Bess: I'll figure it out.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] No, you have no plan for Jessica's future.",
        "Bess: All I need is time.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] There is no more time. You have nowhere to go and nothing left to bargain with. It is now time to finish the job.",
        "Bess: My job is to protect Jessica.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Not indefinitely. Only until she no longer needs your protection, and that time is now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: So, you really think that little of me?",
        "Oliver: Look, Kyle, I covered for you because we used to be friends. But now you're linked to three murders. Now you're going to be accused of breaking and entering. I can't really think less of you than I already do.",
        "Kyle: So that's how it's going to be?",
        "Oliver: No, Kyle, that's how it is.",
        "Kyle: I don't even get the benefit of the doubt. Well, thanks a lot, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: Don't call me that.",
        "Kyle: Where are you going?",
        "Oliver: I came to find Roxy. I'll come back another time.",
        "Kyle: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll give her the message.",
        "Oliver: It's personal. And since you and I don't really have a personal relationship anymore, there's no point in you getting involved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Answering machine beeps]",
        "Gigi: Rex, it's Gigi. Call me back when you get this. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Sorry, Gigi, he can't come to the phone right now. Rex is too caught up pampering me.",
        "Woman on answering machine: Message deleted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Not home. He's probably at the club.",
        "Marcie: That's okay. I have been meaning to call him. Knock some sense into him.",
        "Gigi: Marcie, it's not his fault that we broke up. It was all me.",
        "Marcie: You made one mistake. It happens. And let me tell you, Rex knows what it's like to be in your position.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Stacy: What do you want?",
        "Kyle: Hey, watch your tone, sunshine. I'm just calling to warn you.",
        "Stacy: About what?",
        "Kyle: You're ex-boyfriend and your sister, they're onto you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Michael and I, we have wanted a family since before we got married, and Rex has one. He has a great one. And to see him just throw it away like this. Please, it just makes me so -- it just breaks my heart.",
        "Gigi: At least you and Michael might end up with what you've always wanted.",
        "Marcie: Hmm, maybe I've -- oh.",
        "Schuyler: Hi, sorry to interrupt. Can I borrow you for a second?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, it's okay. I've got to get a table. Michael's going to be here any minute now.",
        "Gigi: Okay. What's going on?",
        "Schuyler: Listen, I had a nice little exchange with Kyle Lewis.",
        "Gigi: Did he admit to breaking into your place?",
        "Schuyler: Denied the whole thing up and down.",
        "Gigi: Do you believe him?",
        "Schuyler: You know what? I don't know. I really don't. But I think we're wasting our time with him. I mean, if we really want to get to the bottom of this, we've got to grab the bull by the horns. The bull --",
        "Gigi: Meaning Stacy.",
        "Schuyler: Yes, thank you for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Any news?",
        "Michael: The best kind. Bo found Jessica and Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Don't even think about it, Brody. You're not going up there.",
        "Brody: But Jessica needs me.",
        "Charlie: No, she needs her mother.",
        "Brody: I was in St. Anne's with her. I know how to help her.",
        "Charlie: Okay, and her mother is helping her now.",
        "Brody: How, by putting on a pair of glasses and calling herself Jean Randolph? What's that going to do, Charlie?",
        "Charlie: Viki knows what she's doing. And if anybody can get through to Jessica, she can.",
        "[Brody sighs]",
        "Brody: That's what I'm worried about. What's she going to do when -- what's she going to do when she finds out the truth? And what's Jessica going to do when she realizes that Chloe isn't really hers? And what's going to happen when she realizes her own baby... I can't even say it.",
        "Charlie: I know. It's so terrible I don't even want to say it. But Jessica does. She has to face it. And maybe with Viki's help, she finally will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: I invited you in to help me.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] Which is precisely what I am doing.",
        "Bess: Admitting defeat negates my purpose, doesn't it?",
        "Viki: [As Jean] No, your purpose was to protect Jessica until she was able to face the truth. If you stay now, Bess, you're not protecting her any longer, you are burying her alive.",
        "Bess: You have no idea what you're asking me to do.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] I know all too well of what I'm asking. It's time to relinquish control to Jessica. You must allow her to confront her secrets. You must allow her to save herself.",
        "Bess: She's not capable of doing that.",
        "Viki: [As Jean] She is. It's you who are preventing it. She can endure the pain. Victoria did. A great, great deal of it. But Jessica needs to stop hiding behind you. The pain never really goes away, but it becomes manageable.",
        "Bess: What about the pain when they take the baby away from Jessica? What happens when the truth comes out and Jessica has to admit what she's done? She'll be committed again, and Todd Manning will come for his grandchild. What happens when they rip Chloe out of her arms, away from the only mother she's ever known, and Jessica screams so loud that no sound comes out? What happens when she has to tell Bree that not only does she not have a father, she no longer has a sister? What happens to Jessica's family? What happens then, Viki?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What have I done to deserve this? I mean, Gigi turning on me, sure, but Schuy? All I ever did was care about him.",
        "Kyle: Maybe that's your answer right there.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, but we haven't been together in ages. He needs to get over it.",
        "[Kyle sighs]",
        "Kyle: So what do we do right now?",
        "Stacy: Nothing. I mean, Schuy's running around town with a bag of blood and screaming. Everybody thinks he's insane.",
        "Kyle: For now.",
        "Stacy: No. Listen, don't worry about it. He has no evidence that Shane's donor is anyone else than little old me. And good job, by the way.",
        "Kyle: I just phonied up the test results at the lab. Stealing the blood? That was the hard part, so bravo to you.",
        "Stacy: Wait, I didn't steal anything.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, you did.",
        "Stacy: Uh-uh.",
        "Kyle: Well, then who did?",
        "Stacy: Oh, who cares?",
        "Kyle: Doesn't it bother you that somebody's holding on to a bag of your blood? And aren't you even just a little bit curious why they want it?",
        "Stacy: It was probably the hotel maid -- those guys are freaks.",
        "Rex: Tell me about it. You're the biggest one there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Do you think we can get Stacy to confess?",
        "Gigi: That beyotch? No, no way. She's in so deep already, she'll just come up with some other crafty little lie.",
        "Schuyler: You know what? And -- and with Kyle Lewis backing her up now, I mean, that's like anything we say --",
        "Gigi: It looks like we're out to get poor little Stacy, and I know Rex. We could hand him a signed confession from my sister and he would still need to see hard evidence.",
        "Schuyler: Which we don't even have anymore. I can't believe I put something so important in my fridge. Stupid!",
        "Gigi: Well, where else are you supposed to put a bag of blood, the bank? Look, we can't give up. I have been scared and unhappy for so long, and I'm sick of it. And now, I might have a way to get my family back, so I'm going to stick to the plan. All we have to do is prove that Stacy couldn't be Shane's bone marrow donor, okay?",
        "Schuyler: How do you plan on doing that, raiding a blood bank?",
        "Gigi: Why go to all that trouble when you could just go to the source?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Jessica took Hope to West Virginia.",
        "Marcie: Are they okay?",
        "Michael: Yes, yes, they are both okay, and that's about all I know. All that John could tell me is that he just spoke to Bo a few minutes ago --",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Michael: And the police are there, and Jessica's family is there.",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: You know what this means, right?",
        "Marcie: Um.",
        "Michael: We got to get a crib.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How in the world can you be proud of me?",
        "Clint: How could I not be?",
        "Natalie: For what, Dad? For -- for keeping this horrible secret? I mean, for hurting everyone? Dad, I mean, Jessica -- I -- I don't even understand what I was thinking. Jessica's going to suffer anyway -- and Starr and Marcie.",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Clint: Everything you did was to protect your sister. Now, you forgave her for everything because you knew that she was sick and you loved her so much, you were willing to take on this monumental task. And by doing that, you kept a watch on her when your mother and I just couldn't. It was an impossible decision, and you made a judgment call. And why? Because you wanted to come through for your sister, and that is why I am proud of you. And it was a gutsy call. You know something? You've got as much nerve as your grandpa and as much compassion as your mother. And together, that's truly saying something.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're right. And I apologize. I'm not Jean.",
        "Bess: I knew it. I knew it all along.",
        "Viki: Then why did you let me in?",
        "Bess: If you're so smart, why don't you tell me?",
        "[Viki sighs]",
        "Viki: I think you let me in because you know that you can no longer protect Jessie from knowing the truth. And when she does, she's going to need me.",
        "Bess: You're wrong. Jessica's not capable of handling the truth.",
        "Viki: Yes, she is. I know she is and you know she is. And that's why you let me in, so that you could finally let Jessie out.",
        "Bess: But that's not my purpose.",
        "Viki: Oh, Bess. You have fulfilled your purpose. You protected Jessie for so long, just as Jean did for me. And I will always, always be grateful to you for that -- to you and Tess -- but you don't need to anymore. It's over. You can let Jessie come home, back to us.",
        "Bess: This is a mistake, Victoria. The truth about that baby will destroy her.",
        "Viki: No. No, it won't. I'm her mother; I will not let that happen. Jessie? Baby, it's Mom. Honey, I know you're in there.",
        "Bess: She can't hear you.",
        "Viki: Yes, she can hear me. Jessica, darling, I need you to listen to me. I know you're scared, honey, but you can do this. I'm going to help you, but you need to come out, darling. You need to come out because we have to talk about the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Come on, you're the scientist. There's more than one way to get D.N.A. When Shane got sick, the doctors rubbed the inside of our mouths with a cheek swab.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah -- yeah. You're not going to get that close to Stacy.",
        "Gigi: I could sure as hell try.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, all right, look. Next time she comes in here, you grab a -- a fork or a straw that she used --",
        "Gigi: No, no, no more waiting! We're doing this tonight.",
        "Schuyler: How are you planning on doing that? You just have a sample of her hair laying around?",
        "Gigi: No. But I have this. It's a key to Rex's loft. We'll just go in there and get what we need and leave.",
        "Schuyler: Question. Uh, what if we get caught?",
        "Gigi: We won't. I just called over there. The timing is perfect -- my shift's over and no one is home. Come on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: No offense, but this combination of foods is disgusting.",
        "Stacy: It is not.",
        "Rex: Pork rinds, raw cookie dough, cheeze in a can. Cheeze that's spelled with a \"z.\"",
        "Stacy: What about my rum raisin? Mmm. Awesome.",
        "[Stacy chuckles]",
        "Rex: The woman at the register said, \"Aw, your wife must be pregnant.\"",
        "Stacy: God forbid.",
        "Rex: Anyway, chow down. I'm going to go to bed.",
        "Stacy: This early?",
        "Rex: I'm beat, and I got an early appointment in the morning with my accountant.",
        "Stacy: There a problem?",
        "Rex: UV has to cut back. It sucks since I just got out of the red. Stan cleaned me out.",
        "Stacy: You stay up, we can brainstorm a fix.",
        "Rex: Thanks, but you do not need to be crunching numbers.",
        "Stacy: Hmm.",
        "Rex: You've been through enough. I'm going to keep my phone off so you can sleep off that food coma.",
        "[Stacy chuckles]",
        "Rex: Need anything else -- aspirins, anything?",
        "Stacy: Uh-uh.",
        "Rex: Night.",
        "Stacy: What I need is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Jessica, I know that you're there. You just have to listen to my voice, follow it back.",
        "Bess: She doesn't want to.",
        "Viki: Jessie, it's okay. You're safe, honey. It's okay to come out. Please, trust me! Believe me, it will be so much easier once you do. We're just going to talk, darling. We're just going to talk, just you and me. That's all.",
        "[Bess gasps]",
        "Bess: No.",
        "Viki: It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. You're safe, darling. And I'm right here. Mom's right here. And your father is here, too. He's downstairs, honey. And Natalie and Brody and -- and your Uncle Bo, we're all here for you. We're here because we love you so much. And I promise you, I promise you it's all going to be all right. Come. Come. Jessie? You're almost there now. You don't have to struggle so hard to make it the rest of the way back. You can put the burden down now. I know it's so hard to carry it. Baby, it's time to rest. [Sighs]",
        "Viki: It's time to remember. [Gasps]",
        "Jessica: Remember what? What do you want me to say?",

        "Schuyler: Yeah. Doesn't mean nobody's home.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, don't worry. We go in, we grab Stacy's toothbrush, we get the hell out. It's three steps.",

        "Michael: Baby, the family that we've always wanted is so close. It's an amazing day.",
        "Marcie: It is.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",

        "Natalie: What?",
        "Clint: Um -- I was just thinking about what you told me about Roxy. She wasn't always there for you, but by God, Natalie, she sure had your number. Even when you were a little kid, you were so good at taking care of people. You still are. Thank you.",

        "Jessica: That was Tess.",
        "Viki: No, darling, it was not Tess. It was you. It was you. Tess is a part of you. It was you, Jessica, and you remembered.",
