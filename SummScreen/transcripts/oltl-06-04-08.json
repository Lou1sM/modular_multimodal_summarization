        "Ramsey: You work for me, Mr. Vega, you're not my buddy.",

        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Viki: God, Charlie, why did you do this? I mean, is it just because I asked you to talk to Rex? I don't know. I mean you frighten me, you really frighten me. You know, you lied to me. You lied to everybody. Did I just push you too hard? I don't know. Oh, God, now is not the time for this. You've got to get well, okay? You have to get well. And then we'll have a talk.",

        "Second Officer: What I heard, something to do with the B.E. takeover.",
        "First Officer: These people are sharks. Killing each other over money?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Forget about your mother. She doesn't matter anymore. You're married, and you're heading off to your honeymoon. It's all good.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, right. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Layla: Adriana, Gigi had plenty of chances to tell Rex that Shane was his son, and she still didn't do it.",
        "Adriana: Right.",
        "Layla: And now that Brody's back in the picture, it's over. Hey, did you get a load of Brody all cleaned up in his uniform?",
        "Adriana: Hmm, didn't look like that loser we first saw in that bar.",
        "Layla: Yeah. Gigi is not going to tell that little boy that Brody isn't his father. It'll never happen.",
        "Adriana: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: \"Your wife has been lying to you.\" Look, I know the timing of this isn't great, but I've got to ask. You said you knew something.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I -- I have an idea.",
        "Rex: You know what? No, forget it. It's not your problem. I've got to talk to Adriana about this. Are you okay?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Rex: If I take off?",
        "Gigi: I'm fine.",

        "Dorian: But I have been on hold forever. I'm -- I am checking on the status of someone who's probably still in the E.R., named Nash Brennan. My name is Dr. Dorian Lord. And your name would be? That's so that I can report you, that's --",
        "Dorian: It's his own fault -- for overextending himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: He's probably got a subdural hematoma, bilateral pneumos from the fractured ribs. He's got fractures on both legs, and possible trauma to the aorta. Let's just get him stabilized enough so we can get him into the O.R.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, Michael will see that Nash gets the best care, you know that.",
        "Jessica: He has a pulse.",
        "Clint: Yes, and they did revive him in the ambulance.",

        "Nora: Any word?",
        "Clint: No.",
        "Nora: How are you holding up? I'm going to go to the chapel, okay?",

        "Bo: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: It was all my fault. I should have just told you the truth. But you promised me, Dad, you said you'd never go back to the bottle.",
        "Charlie: No --",
        "Jared: Look, I get it, okay? I should have never had you lie for me. It was obviously too much for you. But, well, thank God they found you before you drank yourself to death.",
        "Charlie: [Slurred speech] Son, it's not what you think.",
        "Jared: Look, we're going to take this one day at a time. And you're going to be okay. And so is Nash. He's going to pull through it. He has to pull through it.",

        "Viki: Sweetheart, we just have to have faith now, okay?",
        "Jessica: I can't lose him.",
        "Viki: No. What happened?",
        "Clint: I don't even know where to begin.",
        "Sarah: He was at the shareholders meeting, when Dorian Lord showed up.",
        "Viki: What did Dorian have to do with this?",
        "Sarah: She interrupted the meeting, and --",
        "Clint: Sarah, not now, all right?",
        "Sarah: Grandpa, she's going to find out sooner or later. She told everybody that Jared wasn't a Buchanan.",
        "Clint: And that every decision we had made while he was on the board is null and void.",
        "Viki: Because he's not Asa's son.",
        "Clint: Actually, he's --",
        "Viki: I know, he's Charlie's son. Dorian said all of this at the meeting?",
        "Clint: Yeah, whereupon all hell broke loose.",
        "Viki: Well, I can imagine, but what happened to Nash?",
        "Clint: That part I'm not so sure, but I think that Jared and Nash got into a fight, and somehow Nash fell.",
        "Viki: So what Dorian set in motion caused this to happen to Nash?",
        "Bo: Hey, Sarah, looks like we're going to be here for a while. You want to see if we can get some coffee for everybody?",
        "Sarah: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Clint: Natalie, you were there. How did this happen?",
        "Natalie: It was an accident, Dad.",
        "Clint: But how did he fall?",
        "Natalie: You know, Nash was really upset, you know, he just lost the vineyard.",
        "Clint: Because of Jared?",
        "Natalie: Okay, this big investment guy, investor guy that Nash had, he basically turned on him, okay? And so Jared was going to help Nash and buy the guy out.",
        "Viki: I don't understand this.",
        "Clint: So when Dorian announced that Jared was a fraud, he could no longer help Nash, right?",
        "Natalie: Right, and the investor guy basically just took the deal off the table and walked away with the vineyard, and Nash was really, really angry. So he came after me, and Jared was just trying to stop him, you know. Nash tripped, and he just -- he didn't know that the skylight was right there.",
        "Viki: Honey, why would Nash come after you?",
        "Natalie: Because Jared and I are -- we're together. I love him, Mom.",

        "Viki: What? Nurse: B.F. dropping down to 25. Start another unit of blood. B.P. dropping, 60 over 40.",

        "Jessica: Oh, God, Nash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eddie: I asked you a question. What the hell are you doing in the commissioner's office with the door closed?",
        "Talia: I'm in here with the door closed because I didn't want all of you to see me do this.",
        "Eddie: Do what?",
        "Eddie: It's about time.",
        "Talia: You know, one of the things I won't miss about this job is you, Eddie.",
        "Eddie: You want sympathy from me? You almost got me killed.",
        "Talia: You went down without a fight.",
        "Eddie: I was unconscious -- what's your excuse?",
        "Talia: You're always unconscious, Eddie, that's why you're still riding a desk.",

        "Antonio: Look, I was just wondering when I'm going to get my cut of the money you made off the robbery.",
        "Ramsey: I told you, you'd get your money when the time is right.",
