        "Gigi: Rex?",
        "Rex: What are you doing breaking into my loft?",
        "Gigi: What the hell are you doing in bed with my sister?",

        "Layla: Okay, get your feet off my coffee table.",
        "Cristian: Our coffee table. We're roommates now, remember?",
        "Layla: Not for long if you don't get your feet off.",
        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "Layla: Okay.",
        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "Layla: Yeah. No, no, no, no.",
        "Cristian: What the hell?",
        "Layla: Those are for guests.",
        "Cristian: What guests?",
        "Layla: We're having an open house.",
        "Cristian: We are?",
        "Layla: Yes.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Layla: We need another roommate, remember?",
        "Cristian: Oh, that's right.",
        "Oliver: Hi. Um, is this your sign?",
        "Layla: Yes. Um, I know the building doesn't permit any soliciting of any kind, but Cris and I are looking for someone to rent the other room, and so we wanted people to know which apartment it was --",
        "Oliver: I'm -- I'm not here to bust you. I'm actually -- I'm here to move in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: Mmm, smell that. Moe's famous bouillabaisse. Let's dig in.",
        "Starr: You know, it smells great. I'm just too nervous to eat.",
        "Cole: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Markko: Yeah, it's really nice of you to make this --",
        "Langston: But I don't think food's what we really need right now.",
        "Moe: It's exactly what you need. This is my \"forget your blues plate special.\"",
        "Langston: Starr and Cole don't have the blues. They just found out their baby's alive.",
        "Noelle: And I baked a pie to celebrate.",
        "Starr: You guys are so sweet, and I want to celebrate so badly, but until Hope is back here --",
        "Cole: Hey, Bo found Jessica and the baby, so --",
        "Starr: I know, but that's all we know. The waiting is just killing me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I tried to stall as long as I could but the local FBI office is sending a tac-team to come out here. And a negotiator, too.",
        "Clint: They're going to storm the place, aren't they?",
        "Bo: You know, I tried to explain Jessica's illness to them, but all they can see is a woman who grabbed a baby that wasn't hers, and then went across state lines. And they also see a woman who tried to blow up her mom's house with her sister trapped down in the basement. I'm sorry. Look, their E.T.A. is about 20 minutes. So Viki has until the tac-team gets here.",
        "Clint: Well, Viki's got her hands full. And even if she does get through to Jessie, my daughter's got some terrible truths to be facing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jessica sobbing]",
        "Jessica: Oh, God! My baby's dead! Oh, God! She wasn't moving. She wasn't breathing and then -- and then I knew she was dead.",
        "Viki: I'm so sorry.",
        "Jessica: My poor baby! Oh, my God.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. Oh, honey, I'm so, so, so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, I took the liberty of making a pot of coffee. I hope Nash's parents don't mind.",
        "Brody: Thanks.",
        "Natalie: You're welcome.",
        "Jared: How's the head?",
        "Brody: I'm okay. Ahem.",
        "Jared: Are we, uh, bothering you?",
        "Brody: No, no. I'm just surprised the two of you aren't trying to get me thrown out of here, let alone being nice to me. What's the catch?",
        "Jared: You found Jessica, man. There's no catch.",
        "Natalie: Listen, I'm not going to lie, I still have issues with you and Gigi for cheating on my brother, but it's obvious that you're devoted to Jessica. And you know what? If you care about her as much as you say you do --",
        "Brody: I don't care about her, Natalie. I love her.",
        "Natalie: Good. She's going to need you more now than ever.",
        "Brody: I'm not going anywhere.",

        "Clint: Please, God, let Viki read this.",
        "Bo: You've done all you can, Clint.",
        "Clint: I can't stand this.",
        "Bo: I know. It's the worst feeling in the world when your kid's having trouble and there's nothing you can do to help.",
        "Clint: I think this is a little different than you and Matthew.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but it's the same principle. You know, when there's nothing you can do. You have to put your faith in someone who can make a difference.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: It's okay.",
        "[Jessica sobbing]",
        "Viki: It's okay. You're safe.",
        "Jessica: No. It hurts.",
        "Viki: I know.",
        "Jessica: It hurts so bad.",
        "Viki: I know it does. I know it does. But you have to let yourself feel it.",
        "Jessica: No, no.",
        "Viki: Jessie, you must. Honey, I'm right here, and I'm never, never going to let anything bad happen to you. But you have to allow yourself to remember this. It's the only way to make the pain go away. Honey, you have to remember everything that happened after the baby died.",
        "Jessica: Oh, God! Oh, God!",
        "Viki: It's okay, honey. I'm right here. Just tell me.",
        "Jessica: I was -- I was holding the baby.",
        "Viki: And then what? What happened?",
        "Jessica: I blacked out.",
        "Bess: Much better. We can't do what we have to do if we can't see straight. We need to focus.",
        "Jessica: I remember. I remember everything. Oh, no! I couldn't -- I couldn't accept that my baby died, that Nash's baby died. So I bundled her up. I bundled her up. I got in the car and I drove. I put her little lifeless body in the seat next to me.",
        "Bess: When you have emotions, you make mistakes. Like Todd. He made the mistake of letting Tess know what he was doing with his daughter's baby.",
        "Jessica: I was -- I was going to the hospital because I knew another baby was being born that night. I knew -- Starr's baby. Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: I baked a pie for Marcie, too. She must be on cloud nine. You know, when they took little Tommy out of her arms right there in the Bon-Jour, it about killed her.",
        "Markko: Maybe we should talk about something else.",
        "Langston: Cole, have you thought about what you'd like to major in?",
        "Cole: I don't even know if I'm going to graduate next week.",
        "Moe: We should give these kids some space.",
        "Noelle: Oh, you're right. Pie's on the counter if y'all want a piece.",
        "Markko: Thanks, Noelle.",
        "Starr: Yeah, thank you.",
        "Noelle: Your little Hope is coming home. I just know it. And one thing you can celebrate is that she is going to have the kindest, most loving mom in the world. But you already know that. I mean, you decided Marcie should have the baby before it was born.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Evening.",
        "Shaun: Evening to you, too.",
        "Matthew: Is Starr around?",
        "Shaun: Everybody's in the kitchen. I could take you there if you --",
        "Matthew: It's all right. I'm cool.",
        "Shaun: That dude is really cool.",
        "Rachel: I told you.",
        "Shaun: How long has he been in that chair? Boy already got his little pimp roll going.",
        "Rachel: You better stop.",
        "Shaun: I'm just saying.",
        "Rachel: Do you mind if I wait here for Matthew?",
        "Shaun: It would be my pleasure.",
        "Rachel: I've been encouraging my brother to get out more.",
        "Shaun: Did he have a good time at the prom?",
        "Rachel: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Shaun: You know, you and I made a real good team busting that little punk selling drugs.",
        "Rachel: It was quite a night. And how about your little sister?",
        "Destiny: What about his little sister? Hey, can big brother spare a minute?",
        "Shaun: I'm a little busy right now.",
        "Rachel: That's okay. I actually have to call my mom. So I'll just go right out here.",
        "Shaun: This better be really important.",
        "Destiny: I got an email back from Gregory.",
        "Shaun: I told you not to go there.",
        "Destiny: He's our brother, and he's got my back, because family is supposed to have it like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: My sister, really? How could you, Rex?",
        "Rex: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke in here. I will ask the questions. What are you doing here?",
        "Schuyler: We need to go now.",
        "Gigi: I didn't break in. I have a key. I came to get Shane's baseball glove. I called before and no one answered. So I left a message, but you didn't call me back. So we drove over here, I saw that the lights were all out, I thought I would quickly run in, and I just didn't think you were home, and I especially didn't think that I would find you in bed with my sister.",
        "Schuyler: Whoa! What happened to your eye?",
        "Stacy: I was -- I was hit.",
        "Schuyler: You hit her? Seriously?",
        "Stacy: No, not him.",
        "Rex: It was her boss from Vegas. And you know why? Because she was late paying him the 20 G's that she owes him. The 20 G's you stole from her.",
        "Schuyler: Really? Really, Stacy? You're -- you're telling people that I stole money from you now?",
        "Rex: Okay, look. Just back off or I swear I will take --",
        "Schuyler: Wait a sec. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Vegas? Stan from Vegas? Is that who you're talking about? Stan? I know Stan, okay. Yeah, he's a creep but he wouldn't hit a woman.",
        "Stacy: Well, he did.",
        "Gigi: Is that shiner even real or just a good makeup job? Playing the sympathy card as usual, hmm, sis?",
        "Rex: Okay, that's low even for you.",
        "Gigi: Rex, you -- can you really not see that she's playing you?",
        "Rex: If that's why you're here, please --",
        "Gigi: It is, actually. You know what? It's exactly why I'm here. To fill you in on what a conniving liar my sister is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Yeah, I actually saw the apartment listing online and there was no contact name. I thought that you moved away.",
        "Layla: Uh, I decided to stay.",
        "Oliver: And now you and Cristian are living together?",
        "Cristian: As roommates. We have a three bedroom.",
        "Oliver: Well, anytime you two are together you are at each other's throats. Do you really think it's going to work out as roommates? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm just -- I'm being nosy. That's the cop in me, can't shut it off. Anyway, you probably wouldn't want to be living with me after that whole Stacy Morasco fiasco.",
        "Layla: Actually --",
        "Oliver: And you're probably still mad at me, but I never meant to hurt your feelings. It was just, you know, I was blinded by this big blond bombshell kind of thing, and she just has a --",
        "Layla: Okay, yeah. No, no, I get it. Okay, I'm over it.",
        "Oliver: Right.",
        "Layla: Okay.",
        "Oliver: Okay, sorry. Uh, well, good luck with filling the vacancy.",
        "Cristian: Wait. You know, maybe you moving in isn't such a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Can I talk to you for a second? Don't let him get to you. Remember what you came here for. You're trying to prove a point. This sample of Rex's behavior ought to tell you to get the glove and go.",
        "Gigi: You're right.",
        "Rex: So you and Schuyler joined at the hip?",
        "Gigi: He's not sharing my bed. Sure got over me in a hurry.",
        "Rex: Me? You didn't even wait for it to be over between us. Not that it's any of your concern, I was comforting Stacy. She was hurt. She had a nightmare.",
        "Gigi: Please.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: Rex, my sister doesn't remember her dreams. She never has.",
        "Stacy: Back when we were kids. [Stacy scoffs] You don't even know me anymore.",
        "Rex: Not everybody hops from person to person like you from me to Brody to him. Hey, isn't Gigi a little old for you? Isn't Starr Manning more your speed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: John's got nothing new.",
        "[Star sighs]",
        "Matthew: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hey, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: I didn't know everybody would be here. I don't want to be in the way.",
        "Cole: Matthew, you're not in the way.",
        "Matthew: My mom told me everything about the baby, so I wanted to come see.",
        "Starr: I know. She's alive, Matthew. My baby's alive.",
        "Matthew: I'm really happy for you. I know how bad things got when you thought she died.",
        "Markko: Wait, you're Jessica's cousin, right?",
        "Langston: Markko, she's Starr's cousin, too.",
        "Matthew: She must have been sick to do what she did.",
        "Cole: I just want her to bring Hope back safe, that's all.",
        "Starr: Jessica is in West Virginia, but that's the only information we can find out, and we're kind of going crazy over here.",
        "Matthew: Maybe I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Bo, is there anything that I could be doing?",
        "Bo: Thanks, Charlie, but I'm afraid that all any of us can do right now is just wait --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bo: excuse me, I got to take this. Hey, Matthew. Is everything okay?",
        "Matthew: I'm here with Starr, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Why didn't I see that Jessica was still sick?",
        "Jared: You couldn't have known, man.",
        "Natalie: I mean, we just -- we stumbled on it by accident, you know. We found out the truth, and honestly, I didn't think that Jessica was going to be able to handle it. I thought it would destroy her, so I kept quiet.",
        "Brody: I get it. More than you can imagine. My Navy buddy, he kept the truth from me because he thought I'd lose it. He did exactly what you guys did. He tried to protect me. But in the end, I had to face what I had done.",
        "Jared: But you got through it.",
        "Brody: Because of Jessica. She was so strong when we were in St. Ann's. She's going to beat this. She has to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Clint, I know this is something between you and Viki. Your daughter's in trouble, and anything that I ever said about you leaning on Viki too much, I'm -- I know that right now she needs you as much as she ever has.",
        "Clint: Charlie, she needs you, too. Whatever happens up in that room, it's going to affect all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: What happened when you got to the hospital?",
        "Jessica: I went straight to Dr. Joplin's office because I knew Starr's baby was going to be there.",
        "Viki: How did you know that?",
        "Jessica: I heard Uncle Todd planning to steal her when I was at his house. I hid. I hid until everyone in the office was gone, and then -- and then when the coast was clear, I went in and I saw her there, this beautiful little baby, this breathing, moving, healthy baby, and I picked her up, and I put my baby down, and I left her. I took her! Oh, my God! I took her! I took that baby, and I left my baby there. She was dead, all alone, and I left her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Dude, I am not getting into that with you again.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry, Schuyler. I shouldn't have asked you to drive me here. You don't deserve this. I'll get the baseball glove --",
        "Rex: It's not here.",
        "Gigi: Where is it?",
        "Rex: Shane's backpack. I put it there. I forgot to tell him. Where is Shane, anyway, while you're running around breaking and entering?",
        "Gigi: He's staying the night at Danny's, and that was cheap. Whatever's going on with us, you know that I put my son first.",
        "Rex: Just leave, okay?",
        "Schuyler: Hey, guess what? I got to use your can.",
        "Rex: Are you nuts? You think I'm going to let you anywhere near my stuff? And that includes Shane.",
        "Schuyler: Do you have to be such a jerk?",
        "Gigi: Don't get too comfy. You're going down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Ahem. Excuse us.",
        "Cristian: What are you doing?",
        "Layla: Did you just ask Fish to live her just to humiliate me?",
        "Cristian: We need a roommate, Layla. Okay, it's someone we can trust. And I think so far that someone is Fish.",
        "Layla: Someone we can trust?",
        "Cristian: He's a cop, for God's sake.",
        "Layla: Who was dumb enough to have a one night stand with some chick he just met at the ball. I mean, she could have been an axe murderer. I don't want that in my house. What?",
        "Cristian: First, you're worried about being humiliated. Now you're worried he's going to bring home an axe murderer?",
        "Oliver: You know, I'm really handy around the house.",
        "Cristian: You see?",
        "Layla: Okay, so was Charles Manson.",
        "Oliver: And I love dogs.",
        "Cristian: He can walk Aziza.",
        "Layla: Or chop her up into little pieces like lots of serial killers do when they're first starting out, mm-hmm.",
        "Oliver: And I -- I love to cook.",
        "Layla: Oh, what? Canine soup?",
        "Cristian: Hey, come on, Layla. Get over it, okay? He's harmless, and we can use that third portion of the rent ASAP. So just -- let's do this, all right?",
        "Layla: Well, so you wouldn't mind living with me?",
        "Oliver: No, if -- if you don't.",
        "Cristian: And you know I'm all for it, so --",
        "Layla: Okay, well, I'll consider it on one condition.",

        "Rachel: He's fine, Mom. Will you stop worrying?",

        "Shaun: You shouldn't have started this with Greg.",
        "Destiny: He's my brother, too.",
        "Shaun: And he left us in the dust to chase the fame, the glory, and the almighty Benjamin. He got what he wanted. He doesn't give a damn about us.",
        "Destiny: I told him all about Matthew and guess what? Read it and weep. Gregory's going to help Matthew for me. That's why he's coming to town. You're wrong about him. It's not all about the money.",
        "Shaun: Greg has a way of disappointing people, so don't get your hopes up, or Matthew's.",
        "Destiny: Why do you have to be such a hater? Just because --",

        "Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry. I left my purse in here.",
        "Shaun: It's all good. We're just talking.",
        "Rachel: I should probably get Matthew. He's got a math final to study for.",

        "Matthew: My dad said Viki is with Jessica and the baby.",
        "Starr: Well, how is she? How is Hope?",
        "Matthew: He didn't really say, but he said he saw her, and that she's fine.",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Cole: Okay, when are they coming back?",
        "Matthew: He -- he doesn't know, but my Uncle Clint and the rest of the family are with her. Sorry, that's all I could get.",
        "Starr: What do you mean \"sorry\"? How could you say that? You just told us so much! I mean, you said that our baby is fine. That's great. You have no idea how much this means to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I left her. I just left her there. I didn't tell her I loved her. I didn't tell her about her dad. I didn't even kiss her goodbye. I just -- I just left her. And I took the healthy baby, and I drove back to the cottage, and when I got there, I just -- I just took Starr's baby, and I held her. I held her really close, and I just -- I pushed away all the feelings about the baby that I left behind. And I fell asleep. I knew you and Dad would find me there. And when I woke up, I had this beautiful baby. I didn't remember anything. And I didn't question it. I didn't question it! I didn't question anything! I didn't question how I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl all by myself! She wasn't mine! She wasn't mine! My baby died! Oh, God! Oh, Chloe! Oh, Chloe! I'm so sorry.",

        "Layla: If you're so handy, then you could set up our TV. I sold mine when I thought I was moving, and Cris brought this one over. We need it tricked out.",
        "Oliver: Huh, are you kidding?",
        "Cristian: What, you don't think you could do it?",
        "Oliver: No, of course I can do it. My -- my grandmother could do it. In fact, she did to her own system. Uh, where's your converter box?",
        "Layla: Our what?",
        "Oliver: Well, you need a converter box, and you've got to get it hooked up before June 12 or you won't be able to watch TV. They don't really cost that much. You can find them at any big electronics store.",
        "Layla: Hello. I mean, what are we going to do about that right now?",

        "Oliver: Well, it's actually \"coaxial\" and, you know, it's actually pretty simple. You just got to unplug your TV, plug the wire from your antenna into the converter box, this other wire into the antenna, and then plug your TV back in, and it's done.",
        "Layla: That's it?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, that's it. And, by the way, you're probably going to have more stations than you had before. You know, I almost feel kind of guilty if that was the one condition that was going to get me the room here, but I did it, so am I in?",
