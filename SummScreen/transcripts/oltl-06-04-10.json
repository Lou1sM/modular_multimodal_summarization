        "Right when Bo and Nora are both ready to call off the wedding, Roxy fixes Nora's hair with motivation from Natalie. She finds a dentist to fix her tooth. She does not have to wear the patch on her eye and she can walk in her wedding shoes. Viki and Gigi even find her original wedding dress that she wore to her first wedding to Bo. He has a similar victory overcoming obstacles. Matthew gets rid of the skunk smell in the church. Brody brings a truck load of flowers. And Charlie brings Bo his wedding tux that he first married Nora in. Everything is ready to go off without a hitch. Except they discover that they do not have Reverend Carpenter to perform the wedding ceremony."

        "Bo: You see, you can have a happy ending. But you just have to ask for it.",
        "David: Uh, in a situation like this, Pa, you're the one who's supposed to be asking for the happy ending.",
        "Bo: David! [Spits] What a surprise.",
        "David: Trust me, you're not half as surprised as I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rain falling]",
        "Shaun: Is everything okay?",
        "Kelly: You've got to stop asking me that.",
        "Shaun: Only doing my job.",
        "Kelly: You gotta stop saying that.",
        "Shaun: Mm. First of all, Dr. Lord is the one who signs my checks, so she's the one who can tell me what I can and cannot do. And what I can do is keep you safe. Want half a sandwich?",
        "Kelly: No. But thank you.",
        "Shaun: You don't know what you're missing, girl. Kelly, move.",
        "Kelly: Why? What's wrong?",
        "Shaun: Over there. Stay there.",
        "[Clattering]",
        "Shaun: Freeze!",
        "Reed: I'm freezing, actually. Rain does give one rather a chill. Mind if I come in and dry out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: What are you doing here? The wedding isn't for a while.",
        "Dani: Well, I know, but-- could you just stop spraying for a second?",
        "Matthew: Do you really think that's a good idea?",
        "Dani: Matthew, I need to talk to you about something. It can't wait. Why does the whole place smell like skunk?",
        "Matthew: One got loose in here. I think it's gone now. And this stupid stuff was supposed to get rid of the smell but I guess it's not doing it, huh?",
        "Dani: Yeah, not so much.",
        "Matthew: I--I just don't know what to do. I'm gone through like 5 cans already.",
        "Dani: Don't look at me. We didn't have skunks where I grew up.",
        "Matthew: Great. Then I guess I'm a dead man. So what was it you wanted to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Natalie exhales]",
        "[Timer goes off]",
        "Roxy: It's time.",
        "Nora: It's time. Okay. This is good. I'm done, right? I'm done? Am I done? What are we waiting for?",
        "Roxy: I'm a little nervous, okay? So sue me.",
        "Nora: Sue you? That's not something that you say to a lawyer, especially a lawyer who's gone under your dryer with green hair.",
        "Roxy: Is that a threat? Huh? Is it a threat?",
        "Natalie: No, it's a joke, okay? Where's your sense of humor?",
        "Nora: Probably where mine is. Okay, you know what? Listen. Come here. Let's just bite the bullet here and do this. Do it.",
        "Roxy: Why don't you do it?",
        "Natalie: No, you do it, okay? Look, it's gonna be gorgeous. Nora and I have total faith in you, right?",
        "[Roxy gasps]",
        "Natalie: I can't-- I can't believe it.",
        "Nora: You can't believe what? What is it that you can't believe? What? Oh, get me a mirror. Somebody get me a mirror! It's me. It's actually me!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I've heard of a milk bath, but tomato sauce, that's a new one.",
        "Rex: What? You didn't know the Buchanan men do a ritual tomato bath before they get married?",
        "David: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Bo: No, he's kidding.",
        "David: Oh. I knew that. I knew that.",
        "Bo: I got sprayed by a skunk. So apparently, tomato sauce, tomato juice is supposed to get rid of the stink. Anyway, what brings you back from jolly old England?",
        "David: What, are you kidding? My Pa's wedding. I thought Kevin and Joey and Cord would join me, but they weren't interested.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, neither is their father.",
        "David: Yeah, well, who needs them, right? I gotta tell you, ever since Clint lost Nora, he's been an old fuddy-duddy.",
        "Bo: Mm.",
        "David: Brought you a wedding gift.",
        "Bo: Are those...",
        "David: Cubans!",
        "Rex: You know, Nigel already gave him some.",
        "David: What? He did?",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, those are against the law, too. They're just like smoking in a church.",
        "Rex: Well, then I guess it's a good thing there's no cops in here.",
        "[Bo sniffs]",
        "Bo: I'm sorry, gentlemen, but... we can't break any rules on my wedding day. It's just-- it's a bad omen. See what I'm talking about?",
        "David: I only did it because I thought you deserved the best.",
        "Bo: Well, you don't have to worry, son, because I am getting the best. Nora.",
        "David: You can count on me. With pride I look forward to calling her mom.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "[David chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Shaun, stop it. Stop it. You don't have to treat him like he's an intruder.",
        "Shaun: This is how I treat people who sneak around the back of the house instead of knocking on the front door like everybody else.",
        "Kelly: Okay, for heaven's sakes, he was not sneaking around.",
        "Reed: No, Kelly, Shaun's right. That's exactly what I was doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, come on in here. I'm so sorry to make you come out in this flood.",
        "Eli: You said it was urgent.",
        "Blair: Well, it is, actually. Really. I need to ask a favor of you and it is huge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I should put this somewhere. I'm dripping all over the place. Wouldn't be good for the bride to slip in a puddle.",
        "Matthew: Well, if I don't get rid of this stupid skunk smell, there's not gonna be a bride.",
        "Dani: You think they'd cancel the wedding?",
        "Matthew: Postpone it, maybe. But that would suck. Mom and Dad have been living for this day. I just...I just don't want to see them disappointed.",
        "Dani: Yeah. Well, sometimes people end up getting disappointed no matter what. But you have to face the truth, so that--",
        "John: Hey. How you doing? Your dad around?",
        "Matthew: Uh, yeah. He's up in the rectory getting ready.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Matthew: Wait, wait. Can I ask you something?",
        "John: Yeah, sure.",
        "Matthew: Do you smell anything different in here?",
        "[John inhales and exhales]",
        "John: You mean besides skunk? No, I don't smell anything.",
        "[Matthew sighs]",
        "Dani: Not exactly the answer you wanted.",
        "Matthew: Just forget it. Just go back to what you were saying.",
        "Dani: Right. So...sometimes, things are hard to say because you know that they're gonna be hard to hear. But that doesn't--",
        "Brody: Oh, thank God you guys are here. I need some help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Rex: Who is it?",
        "John: It's McBain. Open up. Oh, God, you should see it out there. What the hell is this?",
        "Bo: Don't ask.",
        "David: Cuban?",
        "John: You know these are illegal, right?",
        "Bo: That's why we're not smoking them. Mission accomplished?",
        "John: Yes, sir.",
        "Rex: You found a new singer?",
        "John: I talked to Blair. We're good to go.",
        "Bo: Ahh. This is excellent! Ah. Everything is just working out perfectly.",
        "John: If you say so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I can't believe you found a florist. I thought all the power was out downtown.",
        "Brody: That's why I got such a good deal. With no refrigeration, all the flowers were gonna die, so the guy gave them to me for practically nothing.",
        "Dani: Well, they're beautiful.",
        "Brody: Yeah, well, now we gotta put them around the church.",
        "Matthew: Wait. Maybe if we put them all around, it'll get rid of the skunk smell.",
        "Brody: Maybe. We gotta move fast.",
        "Matthew: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Unreal. You did it!",
        "Roxy: Well, of course I did. Hey, Nora, did you think I was gonna let you walk down the aisle looking like the bride of drackenstein?",
        "Natalie: I knew that formula was gonna work.",
        "Roxy: No, you didn't. You're lying through your teeth. You really slapped some sense into me.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my gosh, I really did slug you. I don't know what got into me. I'm sorry.",
        "Roxy: Who cares? It worked. It actually worked.",
        "Viki: Oh, gosh, it is a monsoon out there. I've never seen anything like-- [Viki gasps] Oh, Nora! Oh, look at you.",
        "Gigi: You look gorgeous!",
        "Roxy: Thank you very much.",
        "Nora: Who would've thunk it? My hair is actually the color you'd find in nature.",
        "Viki: Oh, Nora, you're going to be the most magnificent bride.",
        "Nora: I don't know about that. You know, we gotta fix the tooth and the--you know, the eye, the dress...",
        "Gigi: No worries on the dress. We got you covered.",
        "Nora, lisping: Seriously?",
        "[Viki imitating Nora's lisp]",
        "Viki: Seriously. We found the absolute most fabulous dress, and it was right under our noses the whole time.",
        "Nora: Oh, no, I can't get married in the dress that I married Clint in.",
        "Viki: Oh, please. I wouldn't do that to you. Gigi, off you go.",
        "Natalie: Oh, beautiful.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reed: I was trying to avoid checkpoint Shaun. I thought that if I came around the back, I could steal some unsupervised moments with Kelly. Much as I love your company, Shaun.",
        "Kelly: Okay. At least he's being honest.",
        "Shaun: How long were you out there, Reed?",
        "Reed: Long enough to be soaked to the skin. Permit me to remove my coat?",
        "Kelly: Allow me. Allow me. He can stay, right, Shaun?",
        "Shaun: For now. But I'm gonna be eating my lunch right over there. So don't do anything you don't want me to see.",
        "Kelly: I'm sorry, but when it comes to protection, he's a bit like a Rottweiler.",
        "Reed: I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Kelly: I would. But we have to find out who killed my mother before I can get my privacy back.",
        "Reed: You're still convinced it was murder?",
        "Kelly: Well, until we can prove it wasn't. So what brings you out in this horrible weather?",
        "Reed: Withdrawal. I haven't seen you since we got back from New York.",
        "Kelly: I know. I'm so sorry.",
        "Reed: And we haven't so much as spoken since you thanked me for the flowers.",
        "Kelly: I know. I know. I've been up to my neck working. It's this whole Robert Ford attempted murder story. Will you forgive me?",
        "Reed: On one condition. You grant me another date.",
        "Kelly: Right now?",
        "Reed: Well, now's as good a time as any, don't you think?",
        "Kelly: Okay, well, if you don't think it's too weird, we could go to a wedding. I just happen to be invited to one.",
        "Shaun: Great. I love weddings. When do we leave?",
        "[Shaun munching]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So I guess their first choice got laryngitis, so they were up a creek and that's why they came crawling to me.",
        "Eli: Well, I'm surprised you agreed to do it.",
        "Blair: Well, I really didn't have a choice. It was either me or my dear cousin Kelly, who never met a song she couldn't destroy. So you're looking at the wedding singer.",
        "Eli: And you want me to go with you?",
        "Blair: Well, I dare them to tell me I can't bring a date, so if you're worried about not being on the guest list, well, you're with me.",
        "Eli: No, no, no, no. I--I'm on the list. When I first got to town, I represented Bo and Nora when Matthew sued them. So I've had my invitation for weeks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: A little to the left. Yeah. Good.",
        "Brody: Thanks, Dani. I don't know if Matthew and I would've known where to start if you hadn't been here.",
        "Dani: Glad I could help.",
        "Matthew: All right. Everybody inhale.",
        "[All inhale]",
        "Matthew: What do you think?",
        "Brody: All I can smell is flowers.",
        "Dani: Me, too.",
        "Brody: You're off the hook, dude.",
        "Matthew: Well, it's just about time. Breathing in that spray was about to make me lose my lunch. What's that?",
        "Brody: It's a tux for your dad. Where is he, anyway?",
        "Matthew: Oh, he's up in the rectory.",
        "Brody: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Matthew: See ya. You know, Brody's right. We never would've been able to do that flower thing without you.",
        "Dani: It was fun. But I still need to talk to you about--",
        "Matthew: Wait. One second. I don't know if it was just because you're from Tahiti or not, but...I've always wanted to do that. Just like I thought-- beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Hey, Rex, did you find-- why the hell is Bo in a tub of-- what the hell is that?",
        "John: Don't ask.",
        "David: Party favor?",
        "Brody: You know it's illegal to smoke in a church.",
        "Rex: Do you see anybody smoking?",
        "Bo: Go ahead. Take one, Brody. Save it for a rainy day.",
        "Brody: Thanks. You think we're ever gonna get one worse than today? We should be building an ark. Hey--but at least I got the flowers.",
        "Bo: Ah. Good man. I knew I could count on you. Is that a tux?",
        "Brody: Okay, well, before I show it to you, there's a few things you need to know. First, Logan's was closed because the power was out.",
        "Bo: Well, what about that other place? What's it--",
        "David: No, no, no. Bite your tongue. You don't mean Tommy's Top Tuxes, where polyester goes to die?",
        "Brody: Yeah, that's where I went next. But they had a cave-in.",
        "Rex: Cave-in?",
        "Brody: A tree fell on the roof. Water damage up the wazoo.",
        "David: How could you tell?",
        "Brody: But lucky for us, they did have one dry tux in your size.",
        "Bo: Okay, well, let's have a look.",
        "Brody: Ready? Ta-da! What do you think? Pretty sharp, huh? The bride's gonna love it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I haven't seen this dress since--",
        "Viki: The first time you married Bo.",
        "Roxy: What?",
        "Nora: Where did you find it?",
        "Viki: In one of the many boxes that you have never unpacked.",
        "Nora: I thought it was lost. Oh, my God, this is the best wedding present ever.",
        "Natalie: I can't wait to see you in this.",
        "Roxy: And if that dress still fits, I'm gonna wring your neck.",
        "Gigi: It'll fit. It will fit. And it will look as good as the first time you wore it.",
        "Nora: I--I can't believe you found it.",
        "Viki: Hey, that's not all we found.",
        "Nora: Shut up!",
        "Viki: [Laughs] It was right next to your dress, and we thought it might be fun if Bo wanted to wear this, too.",
        "Nora: Oh, my--oh, God. I mean-- it just makes me feel like it was yesterday and yet it was-- I mean, there's--there's so much time gone by and there's... so many mistakes.",
        "Viki: Hey. And so many wonderful things. Your son. And the fact that you and Bo found your way home again.",
        "Nora: We did, didn't we?",
        "Viki: Yes, you did.",
        "Nora: I can't believe--thank you so much for looking in all these boxes.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Natalie: Hey, what about Uncle Bo? You want me to take that over to the church?",
        "Viki: You know what? I'll call Charlie. He can pick it up on his way over and he can bring it to Bo.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Gigi: And I will call Rex so he can tell Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I haven't seen one of those since...never.",
        "David: Well, if disco comes back, you'll be right in style, Pa.",
        "Brody: Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay? But it really was the last tuxedo in town.",
        "David: Well, on the bright side, it's a perfect color match to your eyes.",
        "Bo: You noticed.",
        "David: What, are you kidding? Where do you think I got my baby blues? I inherited them from my Pa.",
        "Rex: Hey.",
        "Gigi: How are things going at the church?",
        "Rex: Couldn't be better.",
        "Gigi: Bo hasn't gotten dressed yet, has he?",
        "Rex: Not yet. Why?",
        "Gigi: Well, I'm at Roxy's with the bride, and we've got our hands on something we think that Bo might like to wear more than what he was planning on. What do you think? Think he's up for a last-minute change?",
        "Rex: Bring it on. The sooner the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Okay, I am gonna be perfectly safe. It's a wedding. All of the guests are people we know.",
        "Reed: And it will be my privilege to make absolutely certain that nothing bad happens. You have my word that if you entrust Kelly to my care, I will bring her home safe and sound.",
        "Shaun: I don't need your word. Because I've got this.",
        "Kelly: What's that?",
        "Shaun: My invitation to the wedding. The commissioner sent it. So whenever you're ready...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What is this? Was everybody invited to this stupid wedding except me in this town? Why?",
        "Eli: You think it might have something to do with what happened at Nora's last wedding?",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. I had a couple of adult beverages. It's a wedding. People are supposed to celebrate.",
        "Eli: Okay. Whatever.",
        "Blair: And you know what? I thought you, of all people, wouldn't judge me.",
        "Eli: I'm not judging you. You asked me why and I was trying to come up with--",
        "Blair: All right, back it up here, Counselor. If you got this invitation, what, a couple of weeks ago, were you gonna invite me to be your date?",
        "Eli: I didn't think you'd want to go.",
        "Blair: Well, I don't. But John practically got down on his hands and knees to beg me. I couldn't--I couldn't say no.",
        "Eli: Well, that's very sporting of you. I would be honored to be your date.",
        "Blair: You would?",
        "Eli: Blair, there's something you need to know about me.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Eli: I never turn down an opportunity to stand next to the most beautiful woman in the room.",
        "Blair: Aww. You are so sweet. Mm.",
        "Kelly: Hello. Ahem. We're just passing through.",
        "Blair: Well, we're just kind of in the mood for Bo and Nora's wedding.",
        "Kelly: Oh, well, that's a coincidence. We were just talking about that ourselves. Reed, this is my cousin Blair Cramer and Elijah Clarke.",
        "Blair: Hi.",
        "Reed: Reed Wagner.",
        "Eli: How are ya?",
        "Reed: Nice to meet you.",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm detecting a little accent there. Kind of reminds us of our old friend, right? Ian Armitage. Don't try and kill this one, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Like you did with Max?",
        "Eli: Excuse me?",
        "Blair: Nothing.",
        "Reed: Since we're heading in the same direction, why don't we all go together?",
        "Blair: I don't know. Kelly-- we don't really do double-dating.",
        "Kelly: Well, there is always a first time for everything. That is, if you can stand it.",
        "Blair: I guess I could.",
        "Shaun: Well, what do you know? They say weddings bring out the magic. I guess I just saw some.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Okay. I gave Charlie the garment bag and he's gonna give it to Bo and he will have it in no--what's wrong?",
        "Nora: It's not gonna be like the first time.",
        "Natalie: Are you kidding? You are gonna look even better.",
        "Nora: I'm gonna look out of one eye, that's how I'm gonna look. And if I don't get this tooth fixed, I'm gonna be loving Bo \"in thickneth and in health.\"",
        "Gigi: Don't worry about that. It's barely even noticeable.",
        "Nora: And the patch and the crutch? Oh, yeah, that's every bride's dream accessory.",
        "Roxy: Maybe the girl's got a point. You know what they say-- 3 strikes, you're out.",
        "Gigi: Rox!",
        "Roxy: Well, you know, sometimes when so many bad things happen, you gotta take it kind of like a sign.",
        "Viki: Not today. Today we're going to be positive.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I mean, we found the perfect dress, didn't we? And you fixed your hair, and as soon as Jessica finds a dentist, we'll fix that, too.",

        "Charlie: You can have some of my H2O. It was a very good year.",
        "David: Well, during this momentous occasion, I think it's appropriate to invoke the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling. \"A woman is just a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.\" To Bo and Nora.",
        "John: Uh, maybe I could just add something real quick. Some people get married because they think they can live with each other. I think the best marriages are between 2 people who can't live without each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I've never met two people who belong together more than Bo and Nora.",

        "Jessica: There's no need to thank us.",
        "Nora: Oh, yes, there is. I only look halfway decent because of everything that you guys did. You guys deserve all the credit for that. I--I so appreciate it. And if you're not too exhausted after all your hard work, would you do me the favor of... walking down the aisle with me and being my bridesmaids?",
        "Jessica: Of course.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, we'd be honored. Wow.",

        "Brody: No.",
        "Bo: Well, who was supposed to pick him up?",
        "Rex: I think that was me. I couldn't go. You were under attack.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but his plane--his plane was supposed to land, like, an hour ago. Did he call?",
        "David: I think I can help out here. I think I know what happened.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "David: The airport shut down right after my flight landed. I bet Andrew was probably re-routed.",
