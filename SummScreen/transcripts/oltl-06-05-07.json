        "Miles: Well, who better to help me than my wife the psychiatrist?",
        "Marty: Blackmailing me, threatening my son and John to get what you want? It's -- it's not going to work, Miles. It is going to blow up in our faces.",
        "Miles: Well, what's life without a little risk? So what's it going to be? Will you marry me, Marty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Dear Lord, please take care of Jessica and Antonio. Watch over them. Keep them safe. Protect them, please. Thank you, Lord. Amen.",

        "Langston: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Knock it off! That's not the line!",
        "Markko: It's better. You know, I'm bringing the sexy back.",
        "Langston: Keep it.",
        "Markko: Look, this is what my character would do.",
        "Langston: Ok, you are not the character. He came out of my head. You just play the part and say the lines.",
        "Starr: Don't look at me. She's the boss.",
        "Langston: Think about it. If you get with Starr's character right now, the show's over.",
        "Markko: No, not necessarily. Look, I've got a few ideas.",

        "Starr: I never said that, Markko.",

        "Markko: Oh. I \"try\" to act?",
        "Langston: Yeah. And if something's not working, it'll be pretty obvious, and then I'll fix it, ok?",
        "Markko: No, you just don't want to change your masterpiece.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Go to the prom without a date. It'd be better than going with someone you barely know.",

        "Cole: It's just another school dance.",
        "Britney: Well, you probably already have a date, so you can say that.",

        "Fireman: We're looking at a large-scale explosion here, in the east wing. Now, can you tell from what you see here where exactly this explosion was?

        "Clint: I'm Clint Buchanan, the commissioner's brother. Have you heard from him?",
        "Mr. Armstrong: I'm sorry, you're going to have to ask the police. Right now, my main concern is to get my patients away from that blast area and to shut down these oxygen lines before this situation gets any worse.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but -- but what about Jessica?",
        "Mr. Armstrong: I'm sorry, Mrs. Davidson. We have no contact with anybody inside the building. At this point, we don't know exactly where the bomb went off.",

        "Talia: To O.R. Four. We got a couple people down, maybe more.",

        "Markko: Of course not. If I didn't respect her, I'd quit.",
        "Langston: If you respect me so much, then why don't you say the lines the way it's written? Or are you scared you can't make it work?",
        "Markko: You know, maybe you're scared I'll have a better idea than you.",

        "Cole: Did you just ask me to the prom?",
        "Britney: You know what? No, I just -- I don't even know what I was saying. Just -- just forget I mentioned it, ok?",

        "Cole: You'll know everybody there.",
        "Britney: Yeah, once I get inside. It's the walking-in-by-myself part that I can't handle.",
        "Cole: Must be a girl thing.",
        "Britney: Maybe, but it's big. Whatever, I'll figure it out.",
        "Cole: Well, I guess we'd have a good time.",
        "Britney: Wasn't really looking for a pity yes. I just -- you know, I thought you might be interested.",

        "Mr. Armstrong: The transplant surgery was in progress when the evacuation began. That's all I can tell you.",

        "Mr. Armstrong: Are you pulling rank on me?",
        "Cristian: It's not about rank. Our family's in there. We got to go get them.",
        "Mr. Armstrong: You can't go in there, it's not safe.",
        "Viki: What do you mean, not safe?",
        "Mr. Armstrong: The transplant surgery was taking place in O.R. Four -- very near where the bomb went off.",

        "Dorian: That's on the other side of the hospital.",
        "Viki: Clint, let's go. Let's go.",
        "Talia: Uh -- Mrs. Davidson, no, that's a really bad idea. The building's sustained serious damage. It's really unstable.",
        "Viki: Well, I don't care about that. I need to find my daughter, make sure she's ok!",
        "Dorian: No, Viki, think about this. If the building is filled with dust, and your heart condition --",
        "Viki: Well, to hell with my heart condition! If they let me be the donor in the first place, the surgery would long be over, and -- and Jessica would be safe now, for heaven's sakes.",
        "Talia: Honestly, there isn't any room for anyone who doesn't need to be in there. You would just get in the way. I'm sorry.",
        "Carlotta: But where is Antonio? Where is he?",
        "Talia: Antonio was still in surgery when the bomb exploded, and we can't get to him.",

        "Markko: Yeah, you in drag? I'd pay to see that.",
        "Starr: I'm going to go see what happened to Cole.",

        "Bo: All right, look, Nash, we're working to get you out of there, but you have to do everything you can to help Antonio.",
        "Nash: All right! Tell whoever's coming to hurry up! All right.",
        "Bo: This is commissioner Buchanan. I asked for E.S.U. to meet me at operating room four! Now, you get those guys up here now!",
        "Nash: All right, doc, just hang in there. Help's coming.",

        "Doctor: How's she doing, Lieutenant McBain?",
        "John: Doc, she's got a pretty nasty bump on her head. It bled a little, but the wound's not too deep. Thanks.",
        "Miles: How is she?",
        "John: She's lucid. She says she's fine, but I'll feel better when she's checked out. Look, I got to get back to the E.R. Can you stay with her?",
        "Miles: Yeah, no problem.",
        "John: You sure?",

        "Cristian: Antonio's trapped?",
        "Carlotta: I don't understand. Was the surgery finished?",
        "Talia: I don't know. The phone lines went out with the blast along with the electricity.",
        "Carlotta: That means they're operating in the dark?",
        "Cristian: Mami, please, try to calm down.",
        "Talia: Each section of the hospital is equipped with emergency generators. The O.R. generators just went back online a few minutes ago.",

        "Paige: She's ok so far.",
        "Viki: Oh --",
        "Paige: She survived the surgery, she's stable. She didn't get hurt in the explosion. We were in the corridor and the ceiling held.",
        "Natalie: Oh, thank God. I knew -- I knew she'd be ok.",
        "Viki: Oh, my --",

        "Natalie: You know, Jess and I are very different, and not just in the way we look but how we look at life, how we deal. When things are ok, I feel like I hardly know her. She's my twin -- we're supposed to be connected.",
        "Viki: You are connected. You are.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, at times like these when one of us is in trouble, definitely. And she is fighting hard, mom, with all she's got. And I know that whatever happens next, she's going to be ok.",

        "Langston: Oh, please -- it's a school play. That's a lock even if we suck.",
        "Markko: Ok. Uh -- spontaneous standing o, middle of the show, end of my solo. If I get one, you have to do your little drag number in the middle of the cafeteria at high noon.",
        "Langston: And when you don't, what are you going to do for me?",
        "Markko: Afterschool Special -- I'll streak the building, end to end, right after last bell.",

        "Langston: You really thought Cole was going to skip out on prom, huh?",
        "Starr: Or that he would go alone. The fact that he picked Britney makes me sick.",
        "Langston: Don't hate me for saying this, but you dumped him.",
        "Starr: You're right -- I am an idiot.",
        "Langston: You're not an idiot. You're just not as hard-ass as you pretend to be.",

        "Cole: I don't care, all right? The way -- the whole way over here I was just going nuts. I thought you were hurt really bad. You can't leave me, mom. I don't have anybody else. I need you here with me.",
