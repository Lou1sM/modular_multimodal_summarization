        "The police still search for survivors in the aftermath of the bomb blast at the hospital. Starr confronts Langston saying that Marco really gets to her. Langston denies Starr's accusation and wonders why Starr is doing this since she claims to be her best friend. Cole sits beside Marty on the bed. A nurse comes in and orders him out, as this is a restricted area. After Cole and the nurse leave, Miles comes in and reminds Marty that he has given her plenty of time to make up her mind so now he wants to know whether she will marry him or lose her son. Rex orders another drink as Roxie continues to badger him about his continuing investigation of Tate Harmon. A man comes into the bar and Rex makes a face when he sees him. Roxie asks Rex if he knows the man. Rex informs her that he is Tate Harmon's father. Adriana tries to comfort Carlotta outside the hospital about the safety of Antonio and what Carlotta will tell Jamie if anything happens to Antonio. In the distance, Adriana sees Tate (it looks as though he is coming out of the hospital) and wonders what he is doing here. When he comes to join them, Adriana questions him about coming out of the hospital, but he denies it. With Michael's help and explicit instructions, Nash stitches up Antonio's incision. Jessica comes to and immediately wants to know where Nash is. Viki and Natalie don't know quite what to tell her.",
        "John and another officer manage to get into where Michael is and then down on the floor where Nash stitched up Antonio. They quickly get Antonio out of the operating room and into recovery where he can get expert attention. Cristian goes outside and lets Carlotta and Adriana know that Antonio is going to be just fine. Word reaches Rex about the explosion at the hospital and he hurries out to check on the safety of Adriana. When Rex arrives at the hospital, he sees Adriana in the arms of Tate Harmon. When Mr. Harmon finds out that the operation was a success, he reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a brochure on Llanview Hospital. He wads up the brochure and throws it to the floor. Nash hurries to Jessica's side and Jessica is happy to see him. He tells her that he will love her forever. Viki, Clint, and Natalie look on."

        "Starr: Markko gets to you, doesn't he?",
        "Langston: He does not.",
        "Starr: Right.",
        "Langston: I'm the one who got him the stupid part, and now he's trying to rewrite the whole show.",
        "Starr: Like I said, Langston, he gets to you. Is his input any good?",
        "Langston: Huh. No. Why are you doing this, Starr? I thought you were supposed to be my best friend.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: No. No word on your dad? He's the whole reason that you broke up with Cole, and now you can't have either one of them? Where's the justice in that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: No, I'm all right. I just have a little headache.",
        "Cole: Have you seen a doctor yet?",
        "Marty: Yes, and he agrees I wasn't seriously hurt, but they want to keep me here for observation for a little while.",
        "Cole: Ok. Hey, thanks for calling me.",
        "Miles: Sure.",
        "Marty: You know, I still wish you hadn't rushed over here. I mean, a bomb did go off in this place.",
        "Cole: Mom, your office is down here. I would've come no matter what.",
        "Marty: I need a moment alone with my son.",
        "Miles: I'll be right outside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Want another salty dog?",
        "Roxy: Sure, as long as you're buying.",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "Roxy: Hey. Never drown your sorrows alone. Always have a desiccated listener.",
        "Rex: You just want to say \"I told you so.\"",
        "Roxy: You mean because I said if you didn't lay off of Tate Harmon, Adriana was going to hate you? But you didn't, and now she does.",
        "Rex: Great. Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Broken heart. Keep them coming.",
        "Rex: Oh, great.",
        "Roxy: You know that guy?",
        "Rex: That guy is Tate Harmon's dad. Seeing him now is like the cherry on the sundae of this day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Tia, who's taking care of Jamie?",
        "Carlotta: R.J. Oh, no -- Jamie. What am I going to tell her if Antonio --",
        "Adriana: No, no, no. Don't even think that, ok?",
        "Carlotta: A bomb went off in the hospital. Now both of my sons are in there.",
        "Adriana: And so is Bo, and John, and the bomb squad and the rescue teams. What's he doing here?",
        "Tate: I can't believe I found you.",
        "Adriana: What are you doing here?",
        "Tate: It's all over the news. Are you ok?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, we're fine. You remember Carlotta, right?",
        "Tate: Hi. I'm so happy that you and Adriana weren't hurt.",
        "Adriana: Tate -- did you just come from inside the hospital?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How's she doing?",
        "Viki: See for yourself.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "[Natalie laughs]",
        "Natalie: See, mom, I told you there was nothing to worry about. You don't look as yellow. [Natalie chuckles]",
        "Jessica: I want to see Nash.",
        "Viki: You will, you will, honey. You will.",
        "Natalie: She doesn't know?",
        "Clint: Sweetheart, you just close your eyes and rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You good? You secure?",
        "E.S.U. Worker: Almost there, Lieutenant.",
        "John: All right. Hey, Mike, can you hear me?",
        "Michael: John? John, is that you?",
        "John: Yeah, what's the situation in there?",
        "Michael: The situation is about as bad as it can get. Now, the O.R.'s completely destroyed, the surgical team is either unconscious or dead, and Antonio's wound is still open. But I can't get to him. Nash can. He's going to have to close.",
        "Nash: You know, Michael, has it occurred to you that not only am I not a doctor, but when I lose a button, I throw the shirt out. I might not be the right man for this job.",
        "Michael: Really? Well, if you have a better idea, I'm listening.",
        "Nash: No.",
        "John: You copy all that, Bo?",
        "Bo: I heard.",
        "Cristian: Wait a minute, Nash is going to operate on Antonio?",
        "Bo: Come on. We've got to get detective Vega to another O.R. ASAP. Let's move.",
        "E.S.U. Worker: We move this ceiling too quick, the whole thing could collapse.",
        "Cristian: Nash is not a doctor, Bo.",
        "Bo: Nash is not going to operate. He's going to close the wound so that then we can get Antonio to another O.R. just as soon as we get in there. Michael is going to talk him through it. Cristian, listen to me -- we need your consent. Now, I don't know enough about medicine to know anything, but an open wound with the amount of debris and the dust that's in there right now -- I think I'd know what I'd decide to do.",
        "Cristian: Ok, yeah, yeah. Do it.",
        "Bo: All right, keep moving.",

        "Kirk: Ahem. Hey, give me a shot of Irish, and a draft.",
        "Bartender: Coming right up.",
        "Roxy: Tate sure doesn't get his looks from his mama. What's his name?",
        "Rex: Kirk.",
        "Roxy: Yo, Captain Kirk!",
        "Rex: Will you shut up?",
        "Roxy: Over here!",
        "Kirk: Yeah?",
        "Roxy: I just found out who you are.",
        "Kirk: Well, you have me at a disadvantage.",
        "Roxy: Sorry about that. Roxy Balsom -- like the wood?",
        "Rex: Oh, my God.",
        "Kirk: Your mom?",
        "Roxy: Oh, he told me that you were here visiting Tate. Did you bring your wife with you?",
        "Kirk: No. I'm a widower.",
        "Roxy: Oh, I'm a widow.",
        "Kirk: Hmm.",
        "Roxy: Hey, you're not gay also, are you?",
        "Rex: Mom, please, I am begging you.",
        "Kirk: No. I'm not gay, and neither is my son. But your son -- thanks to him, there's a lot of people in this town think he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: I came from the parking lot, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: It looked like you came straight from the building.",
        "Tate: Well, it may have seemed that way because of the reporters and everyone milling around. It's a zoo over there.",
        "Adriana: Well, how'd you get past the cops?",
        "Tate: I got a press pass from work. I did some finagling, but I knew you were here and I had to make sure you were all right.",
        "Adriana: Well, we weren't near the explosion. The bombs were in the O.R.",
        "Tate: How's Jessica?",
        "Adriana: She was out of surgery when the bomb went off.",
        "Carlotta: But Antonio was still there. He was in the operating room.",
        "Tate: I'm so sorry.",
        "Carlotta: Sounds like you think he's dead.",
        "Adriana: No one can get into the O.R., ok, so Antonio could still be alive.",
        "Carlotta: And I would know if he weren't.",
        "Tate: You know what? I'm going to go see what I can find out from the reporters, all right?",
        "Adriana: Just don't give up hope.",
        "Carlotta: No. \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't think that you should've told Jess about the explosion.",
        "Viki: Darling, I had to give her some kind of an explanation as to why Nash isn't here. And, you know, we don't know if Nash and Antonio -- now, obviously we're praying they're all right, but we don't know.",
        "Clint: Well, you know, even if she's out of it, Jessica would know that we're handing her a line of bull.",
        "Viki: We have to be straight with her so that she will continue to lean on us. You know, she's got a rough time ahead of her. Even if this transplant is a success, she still has Hepatitis C.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, thank God she's still sleeping off the anesthesia because when she wakes up, she's going to want answers.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Well, by then, with any luck, we'll have good news.",
        "Natalie: And if we don't?",
        "Clint: Then we'll deal with it together, like we always do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, Mike, can you hear me? Mike!",
        "Michael: Yeah, John?",
        "John: Ok, listen, Cris gave his consent, all right? We're going to be in there as soon as we can, but you guys do whatever you have to do to keep Antonio alive -- you got that? How we doing -- are we good?",
        "E.S.U. Worker: We're good.",
        "John: All right. Let's start clearing this area. Let's go!",
        "Michael: Nash?",
        "Nash: Yeah, yeah, I heard that. Listen, don't you guys usually wear masks and hats and gowns and wash your hands all kinds of times before you do it? What happened to that, huh?",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, that would be the norm, but we're going to have to improvise, ok? Now -- now, look, you already cleaned the wound, you found the sutures, you're doing great.",
        "Nash: All right, what's next?",
        "Michael: Ok. Um -- we have to make sure that he's breathing. Check that he's breathing, ok?",
        "Nash: Check.",
        "Michael: Ok, now -- now, go to the anesthesia cart. I want you to find the blue and the green hoses. I want -- I want you to make sure that they're intact. We have to make sure that Antonio's receiving anesthesia as well as oxygen.",
        "Nash: All right, they're good.",
        "Michael: Ok. Now, I want you to -- I want you to open up his I.V., Make the -- make it drip faster, all right? You do that by turning the blue wheel on the back of the machine.",
        "Nash: All right, got it.",
        "Michael: Ok, now, back to the anesthesia cart -- yes. There should be a syringe there with a -- a red label on it.",
        "Nash: Oh -- this one?",
        "Michael: Yeah, yeah. Well, what does it say? Does the label say \"fentanyl\"?",
        "Nash: Yep.",
        "Michael: Ok. Now, I want you to inject that directly into the I.V. Bag. We don't want him waking up in the middle of this thing.",
        "Nash: Oh, yeah, that'd be unpleasant for him. So I just -- I just stick it right into the I.V. Bag, huh?",
        "Michael: Sure.",
        "Nash: All right.",
        "Michael: Good job. Ok, now, at the end of the operating table, at the foot of the operating table, there's a bottle of alcohol. I want you to open it up, go to the other table, and pour it on the instruments to resterilize them.",
        "Nash: All right.",
        "Michael: Ok. Now, I want you to find a pair of surgical gloves that are still sealed. You want to open them up and put them on. Make sure that you hold them by the inside, ok? You -- you want to try and not touch the outside. The outside has to stay as clean as possible.",
        "Nash: All right. Suppose I got time for a quick prayer, do I?",
        "Michael: Make it really short. Whew -- come on, Johnny.",
        "Cristian: You think it's going to hold?",
        "Bo: If we're lucky.",
        "Cristian: Well, we haven't been that lucky so far.",
        "Bo: Well, let's start moving stuff out of the way and then we'll find out.",
        "Cristian: All right.",
        "Michael: Nash? Are you right-handed or left-handed?",
        "Nash: Right -- why?",
        "Michael: Ok. Now, you see that thing over there? It looks like a pair of scissors with a blunt tip.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Yeah. That's the needle holder, ok? Now, you use it by putting your thumb and your ring finger through the holes. You're going to put your -- your index finger on the shaft and you're going to use that to control the instrument. Ok? Now -- now, practice opening and closing it a couple of times. All right?",
        "Nash: All right, I got it.",
        "Michael: Now, you're going to pick up the needle with the needle holder. You're going to grab it 2/3 of the way back from the point. The sutures should already be attached.",
        "Nash: All right. Got it.",
        "Michael: Nash, do you see the thing that looks like a pair of tweezers with a fine-tooth tip? That's an Adson's forcep. I want you to grab that with your other hand.",
        "Nash: Got it.",
        "Michael: Ok. You're ready to get started. [Sawing] With the forceps, I want you to grab the flap of skin on the side of the incision.",
        "Nash: Oh, man.",
        "Michael: Don't hold it too tight.",
        "Nash: \"Don't hold it too tight\"? I'm trying to hold on to the contents of my stomach. You tell me not to hold it too tight -- come on.",
        "Michael: You don't want to rip it, ok?",
        "Nash: Fine. Oh, man -- Michael?",
        "Michael: What? What's going on?",
        "Nash: Antonio is bleeding again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Proms are so lame.",
        "Langston: They're more than lame. They're just an antiquated custom made for humiliation. Look at \"Carrie.\"",
        "Starr: That's a little extreme.",
        "Langston: It's killing you you can't go to the prom with Cole, right?",
        "Starr: Except for these stupid play practice rehearsals.",
        "Langston: Excuse me?",
        "Starr: I'm sorry, but that's the only time that I see Cole.",
        "Langston: Yeah, and now he's hooking up with Britney.",
        "Starr: Shut up! Why would you say that?",
        "Langston: You're the one who told me. Oh -- as if on cue. Oh, save it, Brit. Starr already knows you got Cole to ask you to prom.",
        "Starr: And you know what? I'm fine with it.",
        "Britney: Well, I hope so. I mean, Cole and I don't mean to upset you.",
        "Starr: \"Cole and I\"? One movie and you guys are a couple?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You scared the hell out of me, mom. When Miles called and said that --",
        "Marty: Thought about your dad, didn't you?",
        "Cole: I couldn't handle it if I lost you, too.",
        "Miles' voice: Marty, you have to decide -- be my wife or go to prison and lose your son.",
        "Cole: Hey, promise me that you will always be careful.",
        "Marty: I promise you that it's you and me against the world, right, kiddo? It always will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: \"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. I will say of you, Lord, you are my refuge and my fortress, my God --\"",
        "Tate: She's lucky she has her faith to hold on to.",
        "Adriana: She's lucky it still makes her feel better.",
        "Tate: You have an amazing family.",
        "Adriana: We have our issues, but we love each other and we stick together. Guess your family wasn't like that, huh?",
        "Tate: No. No, it wasn't.",
        "Adriana: Well, at least your dad cares about you, right? I mean, he came all the way to Llanview when he thought you were in trouble.",
        "Tate: Right.",
        "Adriana: When Antonio found out he was a compatible donor for Jessica, he came back -- even though they had such a horrible breakup.",
        "Tate: He sounds like a really great guy.",
        "Adriana: He's the best. I just can't believe this. I can't believe that Jessica's going to make it because of what Antonio did and yet Antonio might die because some lunatic put a bomb in the operating room?",
        "Tate: I know. It's terrible.",
        "Adriana: If something happens to Antonio, Jessica's not going to blame the guy that set the bomb off. She'll blame herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I wish I was there with uncle Bo, and get Antonio out.",
        "Viki: Darling, I think the best thing we can do is to totally stay out of the way.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Clint: I can't take this anymore. I have to find out what's happening.",
        "Viki: Clint -- Clint, it's dangerous.",
        "Clint: Viki, I'll be all right.",
        "Natalie: Hey, how's my sister doing?",
        "Nurse: She's stable, but she won't be fully awake for a while.",
        "Natalie: Is that normal?",
        "Nurse: Yes. They didn't have a chance to give her anything to reverse the anesthesia.",
        "Viki: Well, I think it's merciful that she doesn't have to know what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, Bo, you copy?",
        "Bo: Yeah, John.",
        "John: We're not moving fast enough over here. How about you?",
        "Bo: Well, if the ceiling holds, we should be in there soon.",
        "John: Hey, Mike, you still there?",
        "Michael: Yeah, I'm here! Hurry up, John! Now, you can stop the bleeding. Look -- ok, go over to the table, pick up the thing. It's a hemostat. It looks like a pair of scissors with a ridge on the inside. Yes. Now, use the gauze and clean the area so you can see where the blood's coming from.",
        "Nash: I don't want to look at this -- I got to touch it?",
        "Michael: Just do it. Can you see where the blood is coming from?",
        "Nash: Unfortunately, yeah.",
        "Michael: Ok. Use the hemostat to clamp the tissue closed.",
        "Nash: All right. It's worked.",
        "Michael: See? You did it.",
        "Nash: Yeah, but I can't stitch him up with these scissors in him.",
        "Michael: No, you can't. There's a cautery pencil. It's that thing with the wire coming out of the end of it? Pick it up, touch it to the clamp, and push the button. This should burn the tissue, stop the bleeding. Then you can remove the clamp.",
        "Nash: I'm going to burn him?",
        "Michael: Just do it. You got to trust me.",
        "[Nash sighs]",
        "Nash: All right.",
        "Michael: Good. Ok, now, let's get him closed.",
        "Nash: Mike, I'm sorry. I don't know if I can do this.",
        "Michael: Are you kidding me? You just stopped a bleeder -- you're a natural.",
        "Nash: What if I kill him?",
        "Michael: Huh. You can't kill somebody by giving them stitches, Nash. Now, if you don't close him up, he will get an infection and he will die. Are you comfortable with the equipment?",
        "Nash: Oh, yeah, I'm cool. Hey -- next stop, project runway.",
        "Michael: Ok, good. Now, grab the tissue on the inside of the incision with -- with the forceps. Yes -- ok. Now, pass the needle through the skin with the needle holder. Now, once you're through, release the needle, grab the needle again on the other side of the skin with the needle holder.",
        "Nash: Uh-huh.",
        "Michael: Now, pass it through the other side. Make sure that you -- that you put the hemostats on the end of the suture or it's going to come through.",
        "[Nash giggles]",
        "Nash: And how do I do that -- with my teeth?",
        "Michael: Release the needle holder.",
        "Nash: Uh --",
        "Michael: Grab the hemostat.",
        "Nash: Hemostat -- yeah?",
        "Michael: Now, use the needle to lift the skin. Now, pass it through the other side of the incision. Do you get what you're doing here?",
        "Nash: Oh, yeah. I -- I stitch him up.",
        "Michael: Ok, good. Now, you do that enough times, you won't be looking at the inside of Antonio anymore.",
        "Nash: Fantastic.",
        "[Rumbling]",
        "John: What's that? What does that mean?",
        "E.S.U. Worker: That means we have to work faster.",
        "Nash: So what's next?",
        "Michael: Just keep doing what you're doing, ok? We're going to -- we're going to use a running stitch here. Make sure that you keep the stitches close and tight.",
        "Nash: All right. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So how long do you have to stay here for?",
        "Marty: Oh, God only knows. Is there someplace you can stay tonight?",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry, this area is restricted.",
        "Cole: I don't care. I'm not leaving my mom.",
        "Marty: No, no, no, sweetie. Please, I am in great hands, and listen to me -- I would feel a whole lot better if I knew that you were far away from this place, so, please.",
        "Cole: Ok. I'll go home and wait for you there.",
        "Marty: Ok.",
        "Cole: Call me as soon as you know something.",
        "Marty: I will. God, I love you.",
        "Cole: I love you, too.",
        "Nurse: Ok, out you go.",
        "Marty: What are you doing here? The nurse said this was a restricted area.",

        "Marty: No, you'd feel better if he was away from here. Don't worry. I didn't tell him you were blackmailing me into marrying you.",
        "Miles: Marty, I don't think of it that way. Instead of living the rest of your life in prison, you can spend it with a man who loves you. If you look at it my way, it's a no-brainer.",

        "Kirk: Your son lied and knew about it, and that could've destroyed my son's career.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but Adriana dumped my son because of your son.",
        "Kirk: Well, if she did, that's probably because she's smart enough to know not to get hooked up with a liar. What the hell took you?",

        "John: This one's still breathing, too.",
        "Michael: How's it going?",
        "John: Bo, we're in. We're on the floor. Michael's finishing sewing up Antonio. The -- the doctors are alive but unconscious, but, look, we got to get this door open and start moving these people out of here before the ceiling gives in.",
