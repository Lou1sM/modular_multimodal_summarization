        "Bo and Nora's wedding goes off without a hitch, despite all the obstacles. David performs the ceremony to everybody's surprise with the \"credentials\" he's achieved in Hollywood to be an ordained minister. Matthew, however, is devastated and not in good spirits when Dani informs him she is not \"ready\" to have a boyfriend. He suspects she's just using that as an excuse because she's interested in Nate. Natalie, Jessica, Brody and John are all ok in their relationships. Rex and Gigi are happy. Viki is the MC at the wedding reception. Clint finds out that David wanted to delay his marriage to Kimberly and takes a shotgun to David but decides not to go through with it."

        "Bo: After all of this -- Rain, wildlife, tomato juice baths, everything but a plague of locusts, now we find out we don't even have a preacher!",
        "Charlie: Okay, just don't panic.",
        "Bo: Or a rabbi either, when you think about it.",
        "Charlie: I'm sure we'll think of something.",
        "Bo: Well, then, what? How? My bride will be here in just a couple of minutes, and we don't even have anybody to perform the ceremony!",
        "David: How about me?",
        "Bo: This is no time for jokes, David.",
        "David: Who's joking? I happen to be an ordained minister.",
        "Bo: The Buddhists ordained you?",
        "David: No, no, no. The scientologists, when I was out in L.A. doing my acting. I just couldn't resist those thetans.",
        "Rex: Why would they ordain you?",
        "David: Somebody had to marry Tom and Katie. So, what do you say, Pa? Will I marry you?",

        "Viki: Changed their minds.",
        "Nora: Is that a rainbow? All we need are bluebirds.",
        "Viki: Ha ha! I think that someone up there finally figured out that you are remarrying Bo today.",
        "Nora: Oh, I don't know about that.",
        "Viki: Are you kidding? What about all the miracles we witnessed here today?",
        "Nora: Oh, Viki, they haven't exactly been miracles.",

        "Nora: Now, there's your miracle.",
        "Viki: Hello. What did I tell you?",
        "Nora: Yeah, maybe somebody is watching out for me and Bo. But he certainly had a lot of help from you and the girls.",

        "David: Oh, come on. Ma loves me like a son. Besides, who's gonna do the ceremony? Little Richard?",
        "Bo: I think I still have his number somewhere.",
        "David: Well, of course you do, but you're aware he's still recovering from hip surgery.",
        "Bo: Tsk.",
        "David: I know people. So I may not be Little Richard, but I can do this. Legally! I want to do this. You brought me into this world. This is the least I can do in return.",
        "Bo: You're really a minister?",

        "Clint: Because you told my wife and made her break up with me.",
        "David: Oh, please. You can't make a Vegas stripper do anything.",
        "Clint: Oh, don't you call her that. Nevil. He told Nigel, and then Nigel turned around and he told me that you got some dirt on Kimberly and that's why she left me high and dry.",
        "David: You should keep Nevil out of the sherry.",
        "Bo: Is this true, David?",

        "Nora: Okay, you're not answering the question now.",

        "Viki: Clint, Clint. Clint. Look, I know that you've been through a very rough time.",
        "Clint: Viki, stay out of this.",

        "Clint: Probably so.",
        "Eli: Well, that was interesting.",
        "Blair: Well, at least this time it wasn't me.",
        "David: Pa and Nora, it was destiny that originally brought you together. Not you.",
        "Destiny: Jackass.",
        "David: But it's love that has now brought you back together. And now for a reading on this subject, Jessica Brennan and Natalie Banks, your twin nieces. Fraternal.",
        "Jessica: \"If I speak in tongues of men and angels but have not love, I am like a loud gong or a clanging cymbal.\"",
        "Natalie: \"Love is long-suffering and kind. Love does not envy. Love does not make a vain display of itself.\"",
        "Jessica: \"And does not boast and does not behave itself unseemly.\"",
        "Natalie: \"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\"",
        "Jessica: \"Love never fails. And now abide faith, hope, and love. These three.\"",
        "Natalie: \"But the greatest of these is love.\"",
        "David: And now Pa and Nora would like to recite their own vows.",
        "Nora: I spent a lot of time trying to come up with the perfect thing to say to you.",
        "Bo: Aw.",
        "Nora: I'm a very analytical person. I like to analyze things, if you hadn't noticed. I can't help it. I'm a lawyer. And so I don't believe in unnecessary risks. And love has always seemed like a really big one to me. And then I found you. And I threw caution to the wind. You took me dancing and fishing and a million other places that I never dreamed that I would go. And the whole time, you taught me not to be afraid of looking silly or falling down or hurting myself, because those things weren't so bad, not nearly as bad as living my life without joy. And that's what you have given me, Bo. You've given me endless joy. Every day. I now know that the really big risk in life is living without you, and that's a risk I never want to take.",
        "Bo: You know--ahem--when I was growing up, I was restless, you know. I just couldn't wait to get away from home, go anywhere, do anything. You know, just get as far away from... as possible. And I did. Brought me all the way here to Llanview, Pennsylvania. And that's where I met you. All of a sudden, I found I was exactly in the spot where I was supposed to be. With you. And you know, we hit that little bump in the road.",
        "Nora: Mmm.",
        "Bo: Yeah. But you know, the whole time we were apart, all of a sudden I realized I was restless again. And even though I didn't really go anywhere, I just felt like I was right back on that road again, and now I know why. Because you're my home. You always have been. And now I want to spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you've made me.",
        "Nora: Oh, Bo.",
        "David: Yo, little bro. Bring the bling.",
        "Bo: With this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Nora: With this ring, I thee wed.",
        "David: Ow. And so, by the power vested in me by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the BMOC, I now pronounce you husband and wife. What David Vickers Buchanan has brought together, let no man put asunder.",
        "Bo: Ho ho.",
        "David: Pa, you can kiss your bride.",

        "Rex: That probably went a little smoother.",
        "Gigi: Probably. At least they got a do-over.",
        "Rex: Yeah, good thing. Give you a ride to the reception?",
        "Gigi: I'd like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Wow, what a shocker. That was actually a lovely ceremony.",
        "Eli: It was thanks to your lovely voice.",
        "Blair: Well, I was saving everyone from Kelly's awful voice.",
        "Eli: Blair, just for today, why don't you forget about Kelly?",
        "Blair: Well, what do you want me to think about instead?",
        "Eli: How about us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: So, what did you think about my ceremony?",
        "Kelly: I especially enjoyed the part where you were almost shot.",
        "David: I thought we were friends.",
        "Kelly: Which is why I have to ask you, how could you do that to Clint?",
        "David: You believe the help over a blood relative?",
        "Kelly: We are not blood related. Okay? And if that were true, I would think you would want to change into something a little less loud.",
        "David: Oh, come on. Clint's already forgotten about this whole thing.",
        "Kelly: Clint never forgets. He inherited his taste for revenge from Asa.",

        "Viki: Hey. Are you all right?",
        "Clint: Aside from feeling like a damn fool, you mean?",
        "Viki: Oh, stop. Are you absolutely certain that David was responsible for the breakup of your marriage to Kim?",
        "Clint: Nevil is many, many things, but one thing he's not is a liar.",
        "Viki: Have you spoken to Kim?",
        "Clint: I can't find her. Lord knows, I've tried, but I can't find her, Viki.",
        "Viki: I'm really sorry.",
        "Clint: Well, I guess I'm the one that owes Nora and Bo a big apology.",
        "Viki: No, you don't. Besides, I don't think they're terribly concerned right now.",
        "Clint: But I think I'll wait till they get to the champagne part.",
        "Viki: You're going to the reception?",
        "Clint: Mm-hmm. You don't think I should?",
        "Viki: Oh, no, no, no. That's your decision completely. But if you do, no guns, hmm?",

        "John: So is Brody.",
        "Jessica: Where are those two anyway?",

        "Brody: I don't want to lie to John and Jess, but the thought of telling them we got drunk and slept together?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. We both know it didn't mean anything.",
        "Brody: Maybe it's better not to tell them anything. Are you gonna be okay with this?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I mean, I'm sure that it's the right thing to do. I-- okay. So we're agreed. This is between us.",
        "Brody: It will be our secret.",

        "Rex: Thank you, Viki. Well, I could never take the place of Bo's son.",
        "David: Got that right.",
        "Rex: Not long ago, I found out that I'm not who I thought I was, that my parents weren't who I thought they were, and I've been searching for my biological parents ever since. But today, seeing Bo, how much he loves Nora, and everybody here in his family, made me realize that I can stop looking, 'cause Bo's the only dad I'll ever need.",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "Rex: So here's to Bo and Nora. May they have a long, happy life together, and may the rest of us be so lucky to be with the one we love.",

        "Bo: Well, that's only fair.",
        "David: I guess it could have been worse. At least he didn't say \"between you and I.\" I hate it when people use the reflexive form of \"I\" when it's the object of a preposition. Don't you, Pa?",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, but maybe there's hope for Balsom yet.",
        "David: Eh, maybe.",
        "Bo: David. Thanks for letting him make the toast.",
