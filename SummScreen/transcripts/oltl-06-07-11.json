        "Natalie and Brody are dancing around confirming the feelings they have for each other. Cristian and Rama have a similar situation although she is married and they both know it is not the right thing to do. Robert Ford and Tess have a similar situation when he surprises her at St. Anne's by brining baby Ryder to see her. Before they can talk, however, Joey and Aubrey enter after calling the cops on Robert afraid that he will take the baby and run. Todd and Tomas help Marty board her plane before the cops catch her. John tells Todd he knows that he did it although he has no proof and arrests Todd for suspicion. Tea also has no proof but grills her husband and brother urging them to come clean. Meanwhile, original Todd watches them unseen and wonders why \"this guy\" is Todd Manning and if that be the case, then who is he? While Cutter has taken \"ownership\" of Clint's home, Vimal comes to see Rama and wonders how it is that Joey's wife's brother would have married Jessica when he thought she was married to Robert Ford. Nigel overhears and is ready to get the goods on Cutter and throw him out of the house."

        "Todd: So long, Marty Saybrooke. You're out of my life at last.",
        "John: How did I know you'd be in the middle of this?",
        "Todd: Middle of what?",
        "John: Hold that thought. Yeah, it's McBain. Get me a flight plan for that plane that just took off. Yeah. Call me back. So where is she, Manning? Where's Marty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Joey, you don't have to do this! We can just call again. Ford is not that late.",
        "Joey: Excuse me, Officer. I need to report a kidnapping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nun: May I help you?",
        "Ford: Yes, I'm here to see Tess.",
        "Nun: And you are...",
        "Ford: I'm...her husband. Cutter Wentworth.",

        "Nigel: Sir, perhaps you'd enjoy the use of a towel.",
        "Cutter: I like to air dry.",
        "Nigel: Then perhaps it's time to discuss whether it's appropriate to continue my service here.",
        "Cutter: 'Course it's appropriate, Nigey. It's gonna be a fun time.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Cutter: You wanna get that?",
        "Nigel: It's what I live for. Deliveries are received in the back.",
        "Vimal: This isn't for delivery. I'm here to pick up my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "TV announcer: The LPD is still searching for fugitive Margaret Saybrooke, who was hiding on the property of publisher Todd Manning. Police are asking what Manning knew and when.",
        "Blair: Yeah, so am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: This is no time for radio silence, Todd. I need to know what happened with Marty. Whatever happened, call. Where the hell are you, Manning?",
        "T\u00e9a: That's what I'd like to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Marty was on that plane, and you put her there.",
        "Todd: Ok, hold on.",
        "John: Go ahead. Lie to me. Give me a reason to lock you up.",
        "Todd: I didn't put Marty on the plane.",
        "John: But Marty was on that plane. All right. Where did she go, Manning? What did she tell you?",
        "Marty: And you'll tell John the truth about his baby? You promise me, Todd?",
        "John: Come on, I can see it in your face. Tell me what you know.",

        "Rama: Oh, gosh. I can't believe I did that.",
        "Cristian: Wow. I can't believe you could do that.",
        "Rama: That was completely, wildly...",
        "Cristian: Amazing.",
        "Rama: Inappropriate.",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Rama: I threw myself at you.",
        "Cristian: I didn't exactly stop you.",
        "Rama: I'm so sorry.",
        "Cristian: I'm not. You're very beautiful.",
        "Rama: Very kind...handsome. But this is wrong. I'm married.",
        "Cristian: Look, um... don't feel bad. Ok? This never would have happened if Vimal were here. Would it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Mr. Patel! I was under the impression you were incarcerated.",
        "Vimal: Miss Delgado got me released when Mr. Buchanan confessed. I wanted to surprise Rama.",
        "Nigel: I don't believe she's in.",
        "Vimal: What about Mr. Buchanan?",
        "Nigel: In the hospital.",
        "Vimal: Joey?",
        "Nigel: All the Buchanans were evicted yesterday.",
        "Vimal: How can that be?",
        "Nigel: The new master of the house wanted them gone. Everyone was thrown out, except your wife.",
        "Vimal: Who is this new master?",
        "Cutter: That would be me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Excuse us. I'm sorry. What were you doing?",
        "Joey: I'm getting Ryder back. It's bad enough you just gave my nephew away.",
        "Aubrey: I didn't give him away. I let Ford have a little time with him.",
        "Joey: Do you honestly believe that, or do you just not care?",
        "Aubrey: Joey.",
        "Joey: No, Ryder should have been back hours ago. That time is long gone, and so is Ford.",
        "Aubrey: You don't know that. He wouldn't take a risk like that. He wants to look good in court.",
        "Joey: Unless he's given up on that.",
        "Aubrey: Even if that were true, Ford can't just take off. He has no money. He has no place to go. His life is here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nun: Is this moppet your son?",
        "Ford: Yes, and he's anxious to see his mom.",
        "Nun: I was given to understand that Jessica wasn't married to her baby's father. I'm sure that was in the chart.",
        "Ford: Oh, yes. Well, I've come to think of him as my own.",
        "Nun: Have we met? You're so familiar.",
        "Ford: I have that kind of a face.",
        "Nun: Maybe you do, but that's not it.",
        "Ford: Listen, can I see my wife right now? I'd like to see her as soon as possible.",
        "Nun: Go ahead, Mr. Wentworth. Just sign in over there.",
        "Ford: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: You can keep denying your feelings for Robert Ford. Whether you admit them or not, it makes no difference.",
        "Tess: Can I really be falling for that sleazy bastard?",
        "Tess: Bess has no idea what she's talking about. There is no way that I'm in love with that plucked bag of muscle.",
        "Ford: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Where did that come from? Ok.",
        "Natalie: It's having Liam back. We just got carried away.",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Brody: No. We can't put this on our son. It's happened before. We can't brush it off this time.",
        "Natalie: You're right. We can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What's the story, Manning? You working with Delgado on this?",
        "Todd: What?",
        "John: You heard me. You were hiding out Marty in your pool house.",
        "Todd: Is that what you think?",
        "John: Yeah, I found Delgado with Liam in your pool house. So was he supposed to keep us busy while you help Marty escape?",
        "Todd: Why would I help Marty do anything?",
        "John: I don't know. I'll have to ask her when I find her.",
        "Todd: Good luck.",
        "John: So you think you're protecting her or something?",
        "Todd: Why do you want to find her so badly? My question. You said you got the kid. How's he doing, by the way?",
        "John: He's fine.",
        "Todd: That's good. That's all that matters, John. I'd let her go.",
        "John: Do you have any idea what Marty's done?",
        "Todd: Let it go, and I'll make it worth your while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: The Vimalator! Glad you got sprung, buddy! What brings you by?",
        "Vimal: I was looking for Rama.",
        "Cutter: Oh, she's not in. Come on in. Feel like a dip?",
        "Vimal: You own this house now?",
        "Cutter: Yeah. Pretty sweet, huh?",
        "Vimal: Mr. Buchanan gave away his home?",
        "Cutter: No, he traded it.",
        "Vimal: For what?",
        "Cutter: His daughter. The crazy one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Look who it is. Ditchy McDitcherson and his son Ditch, Jr.",
        "Ford: I didn't ditch you here. I was thrown out before I could get you out.",
        "Tess: Whatever.",
        "Ford: You know that. Come on.",
        "Tess: You still left me here with the sisters of no mercy.",
        "Ford: It doesn't look like things are too bad for you. No straitjacket.",
        "Tess: Today.",
        "Ford: No drugs. No electrotherapy.",
        "Tess: Not now, but if you stick around, maybe they'll let you stay for the show.",
        "Ford: No, thanks. I don't like seeing you in pain.",
        "Tess: Looks like you used the information I gave you and Joey and Aubrey to get the kid back. You're welcome. Looks like he likes you.",
        "Ford: I like him, too.",
        "Tess: So if you're not here to gloat, then why are you here? It's not like you need me anymore. Do you?",
        "Nun: Where would I have put my gla-- oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Give him a little more time, Joey, please. Ford probably just got delayed. I promise.",
        "Joey: You promise? What does that even mean? You gave up Ryder to save yourself.",
        "Aubrey: That's really what you think?",
        "Joey: Ford was gonna tell the judge our whole marriage was a sham.",
        "Aubrey: And then the judge was gonna take Ryder away and put him in foster care. I wouldn't let that happen.",
        "Joey: No, of course not, because then there'd be no reason for me to stay married to you. Where's that cop?",
        "Aubrey: This is a mistake!",
        "Joey: No, that's not the mistake. I can keep Ryder out of foster care, but first I need to stop Ford from running.",
        "Cop: Is Robert Ford there now? Ok. I'll send someone ASAP. We're pretty jammed here today.",
        "Joey: Where's Robert Ford?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Nigey, water.",
        "Vimal: How did you come to possess Mr. Buchanan's daughter?",
        "Cutter: The old-fashioned way, buddy. I married her.",
        "Vimal: But she was married to Robert Ford.",
        "Cutter: You have been gone a long time. They got an annulment when he threatened to put her in St. Ann's.",
        "Vimal: I see. She must be very happy to be in her family home.",
        "Cutter: No, she's in St. Ann's. It's the least I could do. Their family wanted her there.",
        "Vimal: In exchange for the house which you threw the family out of?",
        "Cutter: They're not a fun crowd.",
        "Vimal: But your sister must be very upset.",
        "Cutter: Oh, Aubrey. Aubrey's not my sister. She's my ex. Do I need to write this down?",
        "Vimal: Rama told me nothing about any of this.",
        "Cutter: Yeah. Rama's been busy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: If Vimal hadn't gone to prison, I wouldn't be kissing you. I wouldn't even know you.",
        "Cristian: That's too bad. I like you.",
        "Rama: I like you, too, but I love my husband and--what, you doubt me?",
        "Cristian: I didn't say that.",
        "Rama: Listen, I know I've lied to Vimal about being pregnant. I want to lie to him about kissing you, but I love Vimal. He's a good man.",
        "Cristian: Yes, he is. And I told him I'd look out for you. I don't think this is what he had in mind.",
        "Rama: I should go.",
        "Cristian: Rama, we should talk about this.",
        "Rama: We can't. Talking won't work. It'll only lead to this. I'm so sorry. I have to go. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Worth my while? Are you gonna try and pay me now?",
        "Todd: In a way, yeah.",
        "John: The only thing I want from you is the destination of Marty's plane.",
        "Todd: I don't think that's what you want.",
        "John: No?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "John: Look what I got here.",
        "Todd: Seriously?",
        "John: Yeah, seriously. So you tell me what you know, or I'm gonna arrest you as an accomplice.",
        "Todd: I don't know where Marty--",
        "John: Aiding and abetting, Manning.",
        "Todd: I don't know--let me repeat--where Marty went. That is the honest-to-God truth.",
        "John: Tell me what you do know.",
        "Todd: Let's see... well, I saw Marty leaving my pool house. I don't know how long she'd been there. She was running away. She was making a break for it. I tried to get her, you see. I'm a hero!",
        "John: All right, hero, where is she now?",
        "Todd: I don't know. When I got here, the plane was already taking off.",
        "John: That's your story?",
        "Todd: That's what happened.",
        "John: That's the story? Marty was hiding out in your pool house for a while, and then all of a sudden she just charters a private plane and flies on out of here. Tell me how she does that.",
        "Todd: I don't know, man. I'm the hero, not the detective. You're the detective. You figure it out.",
        "John: I'm not gonna find your name anywhere on this, am I?",
        "Todd: No. It's just as I said.",
        "John: Yeah, I don't think even you could get a flight plan buried, but perhaps someone in the CIA could.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Police are still down at the pool house. Apparently, there was a lot to find.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, looks like Marty must have been there a while.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did Todd ever call you back?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you have no idea where he is?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why are you so anxious to talk to him?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Just figured you must be concerned.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, how thoughtful of you, hermano.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Cute, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, really. First you rescue a baby and--",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I just happened to be the person walking by. I heard the baby cry.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're lucky Marty was already gone.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So I hear.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, is Todd with her?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No. I don't know. Why would you ask that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because I don't know where my husband is. And if he didn't leave of his own free will, then...",
        "Tom\u00e1s: T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is Todd with Marty?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You think I know?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'd almost be relieved to find out that he was, because I don't know where he is. He's not answering his phone. And a crazy woman with plenty of reason to hate him was found on the premises with a gun.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You don't need to worry.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why not? What do you know that I don't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You think Tom\u00e1s was working with Marty? Better talk to him.",
        "John: You selling out your buddy now?",
        "Todd: If he committed a crime...",
        "John: Tell me where Marty went, and we'll call it a night.",
        "Todd: Oh, John, forget about Marty. She's gone. She's nobody's problem now.",
        "John: Put that down before you hurt yourself. Listen, she killed a doctor. She stabbed Kelly. She pushed Natalie off--",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know! She is a psychopath. But who do we have to blame for that? That's right. I'm looking at you. If you really cared about Marty, you'd let her go. Nah, you're the one who drove her crazy. You don't even know everything you pushed Marty to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: We never really talked about what happened before.",
        "Natalie: We didn't? That's the last thing I remember. Believe me, I'd totally be ok if we just forget it ever happened.",
        "Brody: Really?",
        "Natalie: I don't know.",
        "Brody: Well, I can't forget it or pretend it didn't happen. It's time for the truth.",
        "Natalie: The truth?",
        "Brody: How I feel about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well! You walk much?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I think I should--",
        "Blair: I think I do. I think her name is Rama.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: My Rama has been busy taking care of herself, which is exactly as I wished it to be.",
        "Cutter: She cut back on the visits to Statesville?",
        "Vimal: At my request. It's a terrible place, especially for somebody in her condition.",
        "Cutter: No wonder you have so much to catch up on. Nigey! Our guest is in need of a stiff drink.",
        "Vimal: Thank you, but all I need is my wife. Once she's home, we'll be leaving.",
        "Cutter: Do you guys have anywhere to go?",
        "Vimal: I can take care of my wife. I'm very grateful that she could stay here for free--",
        "Cutter: Free? The nightly belly dances more than--",
        "Vimal: Belly dances? Thank you.",
        "Cutter: I'm just jerking your chain.",
        "Vimal: I see. I see. Well, that's very funny coming from a man in a Speedo to joke about my wife's bare midriff while she's pregnant--",
        "Cutter: Pregnant? Rama's not pregnant.",
        "Rama: Aah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Why are you here? Got everything you wanted.",
        "Ford: Not exactly.",
        "Tess: Judge sided with you.",
        "Ford: I didn't go to the judge.",
        "Tess: You have the kid.",
        "Ford: Aubrey let me take him for a little visit, since I didn't go to the judge.",
        "Tess: I hope you didn't feel sorry for her, because she will turn on you--",
        "Ford: Listen, I think she's right. If I'd gone to the judge, Ryder would have ended up in foster care. This is the only way she'll let me see him.",
        "Tess: So you want me to what?",
        "Ford: Nothing. I didn't come here 'cause I want anything from you.",
        "Tess: Did you come to break me out?",
        "Ford: Tess, I have a baby with me.",
        "Tess: Then beat it.",
        "Ford: Tess, come on!",
        "Tess: Get out of here! I've nothing to say to you.",
        "Ford: Maybe I've got something to say to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I don't know how it happened. We've both been so focused on raising Liam, raising our son together. But somewhere between the diapers and late- night feedings... something changed. Something more. Am I the only one of us who feels that way?",
        "Natalie: No. Brody, I care about you, too. It's...I don't know how to describe it, but something's changed. You changed for me, too.",
        "Brody: Ok, good. So we got that out in the open.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Brody: So what now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You really want to talk about who ruined Marty?",
        "Todd: Oh, this is--",
        "John: Let's start with you raping her in college. Manning, she spent half her life dealing with you. In the end, you couldn't even do right by her. You couldn't even get her some help when she needed it.",
        "Todd: Nothing I can do for Marty.",
        "John: You think this evens the score, Manning? You let her go and somehow everything's fine?",
        "Todd: I told you, I had nothing to do with this. Don't you think that it's better for her that she get away from this place and away from all those bad memories?",
        "John: Hey! You don't get it, do you? Marty snapped. She's gone over the edge. No matter where she goes, her problems are going with her. She's not gonna be able to run from it. Sooner or later, they're gonna catch up, and whoever is with her is gonna pay for it. She left Liam behind this time. What happens when she grabs another kid?",
        "Todd: She won't.",
        "John: What if it's your kid who gets ripped away next time?",
        "Todd: John, John. There's something I need to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So you saw me kissing Rama, huh?",
        "Blair: Come on, Cristian. I think everybody here at the gym could have seen that. It will probably be on the Internet by tonight.",
        "Cristian: Someone filmed us?",
        "Blair: Nobody had a camera, but they could have.",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Blair: I don't think having an affair in the gym is really a good idea.",
        "Cristian: I'm not having an affair.",
        "Blair: Really? Isn't Rama married?",
        "Cristian: Yes, but it's not an affair. That was just a kiss.",
        "Blair: Listen, I'll be the last person to judge you, because I know that things can happen.",
