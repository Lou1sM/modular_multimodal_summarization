        "Viki: No, no, I think she's fine with Brody.",
        "Clint: You know, it'd be nice if he could use the front door like everybody else.",
        "Viki: Lois said he asked permission before he went upstairs.",
        "Clint: It's good he checked with the staff. Maybe next time he could check with us.",
        "Viki: Clint, it's not a problem.",
        "Clint: Do you know what a loose cannon Brody is?",
        "Viki: Hey, Brody is the one who figured out where Jessie had gone, you know? It's because of him that she and baby came home safely.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, she just said goodbye to that little baby. Last thing she needs is a broken heart. Remember, it was only about a month ago that Lovett was catting around with Gigi Morasco.",
        "Viki: Don't believe everything you hear.",
        "Clint: You think Brody truly cares about our daughter?",
        "Viki: Yeah, I do. I also think that Brody is exactly what Jessie needs right now.",

        "Rachel: He really looked great that night. Killer smile.",
        "Nora: He's my baby.",
        "Rachel: Oh, yeah. Matthew's cute, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, John.",
        "John: Hey, Bo. What can I get you?",
        "Bo: You can get me a new chief of detectives.",
        "John: Vega's going to be hard to replace.",
        "Bo: You're not kidding.",
        "John: You got anyone in mind?",
        "Bo: I'm looking at him, McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Marcie McBain, will you marry me?",
        "Marcie: Michael, what are you doing?",
        "Michael: What, I got to say it again?",
        "Marcie: We're already married, Michael.",
        "Michael: Have you never heard of renewing your vows?",
        "Marcie: You know, if you want to do this for the gifts, I may be willing to do this --",
        "Michael: Listen, listen to me. I want to do this, but I want to do this for us, okay? We just went through something awful, and we made it through. And we are back together. And we are having a baby.",
        "Marcie: We are going to have a baby as soon as we hear from Blair and Todd.",

        "Marcie: It is.",
        "Michael: Yeah. So, you'll marry me? Again?",
        "Marcie: Michael, yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I just wanted to make sure that everything made sense. You know, all the legal stuff.",
        "Cole: Well, it does. I mean, when I signed that, I gave up being Hope's father.",
        "Starr: Right, and when I signed the pre-adoption agreement, it was a promise to Marcie to give her my baby.",
        "Cole: Yes, and she promised to adopt her.",
        "Starr: But she's not hers. Not officially, not until I sign these papers.",

        "Nora: For your information, I was looking at photos of Matthew.",
        "Rachel: Because he'll always be your baby?",
        "Nora: That's right, and so will you, and don't you ever forget it. I just hope he's okay with me marrying Clint.",
        "Rachel: You haven't told him?",
        "Nora: I haven't really had the chance. You know, Jessica taking off with Chloe, and then Clint's granddaughter died --",
        "Rachel: You haven't seen Matthew?",
        "Nora: I've seen him. I just haven't -- he was so upset about Jessica, he was so upset about Starr. You know, it just didn't seem appropriate.",
        "Rachel: Whatever you say.",
        "Nora: Oh, now what, you think I'm stalling?",
        "Rachel: Yeah. Because you're not sure Clint is the Buchanan you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We've taken some hits lately. Antonio and Talia. So the department needs you.",
        "John: I'm so good for morale, right?",
        "Bo: Yeah, you are. So, what? You're going to pour drinks the rest of your life?",
        "John: Someone's got to.",
        "Bo: Hire a bartender. You're a cop.",
        "John: Yeah, a cop who doesn't want to have to call the mayor's office every time I write a parking ticket.",
        "Bo: We'll deal with that guy.",
        "John: Bo, look, you know, I played by the rules, and Marty paid the price.",
        "Bo: Why do you think I'm here? You're the best, John.",
        "John: Bo, you're the best. I'm sorry, no sale.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Viki, I'll be taking off now. Would you call me if Jessie needs anything?",
        "Viki: Of course I will.",

        "Viki: Yeah. He just went to check on a job site.",
        "Clint: Good.",
        "Viki: Are you worried about me?",
        "Clint: Ex-husband's prerogative. We just said goodbye to our granddaughter. It's not a good time for you to be alone.",
        "Viki: I'm fine. Are you going home to Nora?",
        "Clint: I am.",
        "Viki: Do me a favor.",
        "Clint: Name it.",
        "Viki: When she asks you how you're feeling, tell her. Let her in. Ex-wife's prerogative.",
        "Clint: Now, you call me. Even if Jessie doesn't need anything, just let me know how she's doing.",
        "Viki: I promise, I will, I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Why are you here?",
        "Brody: What are you talking about?",
        "Jessica: I mean, after everything. You saw me. I told Nash's father to shoot you.",
        "Brody: That wasn't you.",
        "Jessica: Yes, it was. Bess is a part of me. Tess is a part of me.",
        "Brody: And that's okay.",
        "Jessica: No, it's not okay! It's not okay! I let Tess out. I wanted her to hurt Jared and Natalie.",
        "Brody: You were grieving for Nash.",
        "Jessica: I couldn't think of anything else. I couldn't -- I couldn't think of anyone else. And I didn't take care of her. I didn't care of --",
        "Brody: I am so sorry that your baby died. I'm so sorry you lost Chloe.",
        "Jessica: My baby didn't die! Don't you understand? I didn't lose her. I killed her. I killed her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Shouldn't they have come in by now?",
        "Marty: Yeah, they're probably just putting -- putting all their things together.",
        "Cole: How much stuff does she have?",
        "Marty: Oh, goodness, you'd be surprised. Especially if you're going to a new place, you know.",
        "Blair: Hey, you two want to meet Hope?",
        "Starr: She's beautiful.",
        "Blair: She is.",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "Blair: She's yours. Got her?",
        "Starr: Hello. I can't believe that she's here.",
        "Cole: It's like this dream that I kept having, only I don't have to wake up and make myself believe that it's not true.",
        "Starr: Do you want to hold her?",
        "Cole: I've never held a baby before.",
        "Blair: She won't break, Cole.",
        "Starr: You didn't get to hold her before. Here.",
        "Cole: Hi. Hi.",
        "Marty: I remember you when you were that age.",
        "Cole: I think she looks like Starr.",
        "Starr: I think that she looks like the perfect mix of all of us. Cramer, Manning, Saybrooke, Thornhart, all of us.",
        "Todd: Good luck, kid.",
        "Cole: Now I know how you lifted that car off of me. You did something impossible because it was me, and I would do anything for Hope. It's okay. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie.",
        "Viki: I've never been so glad to see anyone in my whole life.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Is it over? How'd it go?",
        "Viki: Watching my daughter say goodbye to her baby? I don't ever want to do that again.",
        "Charlie: How's she doing?",
        "Viki: I think she's all right. She's upstairs with Brody.",
        "Charlie: How you doing?",
        "Viki: I don't know. I feel -- I feel responsible.",
        "Charlie: How are you responsible?",
        "Viki: My daughter's husband dies, and I went to Africa for a month.",
        "Charlie: No, Viki, I'm not going to let you do this.",
        "Viki: Do what?",
        "Charlie: Look, I spent my whole life blaming myself for every bad thing that ever happened to Jared, and I used that as a reason to get drunk, and to stay drunk. All I know is that I wasn't any good to him that way. Look what happened. It's sad. It's so sad. You can't blame yourself. It's not your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You did not kill your baby. There is not any part of you that could do that.",
        "Jessica: She died of Rh disease, because Nash and I weren't the same blood type. And if I had gone to the doctor's appointments, then she would be okay. She would be alive right now.",
        "Brody: You don't know --",
        "Jessica: Yes, I do! I do know that, Brody! I knew that the night that she was born! Why do you think I stole Starr's baby?",
        "Brody: Because you were in pain.",
        "Jessica: No, I wasn't in pain. I didn't feel any pain, I didn't feel any guilt. I made sure I didn't.",
        "Brody: You're feeling it now though, aren't you? You're in a whole world of pain. Not Bess. Not Tess. You.",
        "Jessica: So?",
        "Brody: So you're handling it.",
        "Jessica: If you call this \"handling it.\"",
        "Brody: It doesn't have to be pretty. The only way past it is to get through it.",
        "Jessica: I don't think I can do this.",
        "Brody: Yes, you can. All right? And I'm going to be with you. Every step of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I don't want to see you marry Clint to avoid your feelings for Bo.",
        "Nora: Listen, our son was in an accident. It was only natural for us to get a little closer.",
        "Rachel: Closer is one thing. Almost make out? That's a whole different deal.",
        "Nora: Okay, we didn't almost make -- now, stop it. That didn't happen, okay? Sweetheart, Bo and I were divorced for very good reasons, okay? I love Clint. We have something wonderful, and I don't want to throw that all away on an almost moment with my ex.",
        "Rachel: Then why are you dragging your feet announcing your engagement?",
        "Nora: I'm not dragging my feet about anything. I know what I want. I want Clint.",
        "Clint: That's good to hear. So, what'd I miss?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You used to like enforcing the law.",
        "John: I still do. What I don't like is bureaucrats who rewrite the law to suit themselves.",
        "Bo: John, John, don't let the system get in the way of you doing what you're supposed to do.",
        "John: Yeah, what am I supposed to do?",
        "Bo: Once a cop, always a cop.",
        "John: What, you're quoting my old man back to me now?",
        "Bo: You're lucky, John. You have a gift. A legacy. Don't just throw all that away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Michael: This is Michael.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it's Todd. The baby's here.",
        "Michael: Great, okay. Yeah, we'll -- we'll be right over there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Jessica couldn't have asked for a better mother.",
        "Viki: Not like she had a choice.",
        "Charlie: Hey, she knows how much you love her. You were the one who got through to her when no one else could.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I know, I know. But, Charlie, I just wish I had seen the signs, because then the baby might not have --",
        "Charlie: No, no, Viki -- what's done is done. And, yeah, after some time, Jessica will heal, but she'll get through this.",
        "Viki: I wish I could be as sure of that.",
        "Charlie: Well, you can. I guarantee it.",
        "Viki: You do, do you?",
        "Charlie: Yes. She's got you. She's got Natalie and Jared.",
        "Viki: Oh, Natalie and Jared.",
        "Charlie: What, they're not in trouble, too, are they?",
        "Viki: No, no, no. They never even had a proper wedding. They had to carry that awful secret around with them --",
        "Charlie: Well, they got married, didn't they? I mean, that's what really counts.",
        "Viki: Yeah. But she wanted a big, happy celebration.",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, nothing in the rulebook says that you can't marry more than once.",
        "Viki: That's right. Maybe when this is all over, things settle down, maybe they can do that.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, maybe we could -- we could be right there with them.",
        "Charlie: No, Viki, Viki -- I'm kind of thinking of something else.",
        "Charlie: Marry me, Viki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So what happened with Jessica?",
        "Clint: It's hard to talk about.",
        "Nora: Okay. If you change your mind, I'm right here.",
        "Clint: I'm going to tell you everything, just not right now.",
        "Nora: Okay. You know what? I am starving. How about some Chinese?",
        "Clint: What about next month?",
        "Nora: For Chinese?",
        "Clint: For our wedding. Nora, I want to set a date. Is there a reason in the world that we shouldn't get married as soon as possible?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I'm not trying to push your buttons.",
        "John: Come on, Bo. Quoting my dad, reminding me of my legacy?",
        "Bo: No, you don't need reminding.",
        "John: Then what are you here for?",
        "Bo: To tell you to quit kidding yourself. This? Come on, this is not you.",
        "John: It is now. So what can I get you?",
        "Bo: At least promise me that you'll give this a thought.",
        "John: I'll give it some thought. What'll it be?",
        "Bo: Well, I just wondered what it would take for me to rent the place out. How much notice would I have to give you?",
        "John: For you? A day or two, why?",
        "Bo: Well, Clint's getting married. Thought I might throw him a party.",
        "John: So your brother's marrying your ex-wife?",
        "Bo: Yeah. You got a problem with that?",
        "John: No, no. Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I've felt what you're feeling, remember? I pretended to be Shane's father. I shot the guy who really is his dad. All because I couldn't face the truth.",
        "Jessica: You loved him like he was your own.",
        "Brody: And deep down, I knew he wasn't mine. Just like you.",
        "Jessica: But you got better.",
        "Brody: Because you helped me.",
        "Jessica: I didn't -- I didn't do anything.",
        "Brody: Are you kidding? You understood me, just like I understand you now. I feel like I know you better than anyone. And it's because -- I've never loved anyone like I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Do you think she's hungry?",
        "Blair: Well, she just polished off about a half of that bottle, and they gave her some solid food right before she came over here.",
        "Starr: But we don't have any baby food to give to Marcie.",
        "Blair: Jessica gave dad a list of things that she likes and doesn't like.",
        "Marty: Maybe -- you want me to take a picture of all of you?",
        "Cole: No.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Marcie: Hi. Starr, Cole.",
        "Starr: Hi, Marcie.",
        "Cole: Hi.",
        "Starr: This is Hope.",
        "Marcie: She's gotten so big.",
        "[Starr laughs]",
        "Starr: I know Jessica took really good care of her.",
        "Michael: She looks like a happy healthy little girl.",
        "Starr: She is. She's perfect.",
        "Cole: Do you guys have a car seat?",
        "Marcie: Yes, we just got one.",
        "Michael: Top of the line.",
        "Todd: Probably time for Hope to try it out, right?",
        "Starr: Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I was kind of waiting for the perfect time, but you and I haven't exactly been having -- perfect times. I've been carrying it around so long it's kind of worn the velvet off the box.",
        "Viki: It looks pretty good to me.",
        "Charlie: And anyway, I just figured that it's when things get rough that people really need to take care of each other.",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: No, wait, let me just say this. Because, you see, from the moment I laid eyes on you I knew that you were someone very special. And I guess I always thought that when I did finally ask you to marry me I would have some big romantic speech, but as you know I'm not really a big romantic speech kind of guy, so I was just kind of hoping that, you know, the right words would just come to me.",
        "Viki: How's that working out?",
        "Charlie: Uh, not so well. So let me just say it then. Viki, you're in my heart and you're not going anywhere. I love you, and I'm going to love you forever.",
        "Viki: That was perfect.",
        "Charlie: So, um -- does that mean your answer is --",
        "Viki: My answer is yes.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Viki: I will marry you, Charlie Banks.",

        "Nora: You want to get married now?",
        "Clint: Uh-huh.",
        "Nora: What about everything that your family's going through?",
        "Clint: Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe we should wait a little while.",
        "Nora: You know, it's just -- it may take Jessica a few months to feel better.",
        "Clint: That doesn't mean she can't come to a party.",
        "Nora: Okay, Clint, a wedding is a little more than a party.",
        "Clint: Why are you saying this? You think it might upset her?",
        "Nora: Well, I don't know. I guess you'd know better than I would.",
        "Clint: Yeah, and I think it would help her. Maybe it would help everybody. You know, remind everybody that come what may, life goes on.",
        "Nora: Yeah? Well, okay -- I mean, I just don't want Jessica to feel pressured into doing something that she's not really up for yet.",
        "Clint: Like you do?",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Clint: Feel pressured?",
        "Nora: I don't feel pressured.",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Nora: I'm sure. Are you kidding? I love you so much I'd marry you tomorrow.",
        "Clint: Then let's do it. Just you and me.",
        "Nora: What? Do what?",
        "Clint: You forget that you're marrying a man who has access to a corporate jet.",
        "[Nora laughs]",
        "Clint: You know, we could be in Las Vegas in a matter of hours.",
        "[Nora laughs]",
        "Nora: Oh, you're serious.",
        "Clint: Nora.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Clint: I love you.",
        "Nora: Well, I love you.",
        "Clint: I can't wait to spend my life with you. So let's get married tomorrow. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I could not be happier for my brother and my ex-wife.",
        "John: Now who's kidding himself?",
        "Bo: Hmm, you got to get out of this bar business, John, before you start giving advice to the lovelorn.",
        "John: Bo, do you want to drink or not?",
        "Bo: Nah, I'm still on duty.",
        "John: I'm thinking you got off duty about ten minutes ago.",
        "Bo: But I'm still a cop -- just like you. You want to come to your senses, John, you better do it in a hurry. Because our boy, Fish, he's angling for a promotion.",
        "John: You could do worse.",
        "Bo: This is not you. This is not you, John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How -- how can you love me? All I do is hurt people. And if you don't believe me, you go and you ask my sister. You ask her husband. You ask Starr, ask Cole, ask Michael, ask Marcie. Ask my mother! You should have seen her face when I had to give away the baby.",
        "Brody: No one's blaming you.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, right, because I'm sick. Poor Jessica didn't know what she was doing.",
        "Brody: Your husband had just died.",
        "Jessica: Lots of women lose their husband. And they don't lock people up in rooms. They don't steal babies that aren't theirs. Don't you understand, Brody? I'm no good. I'm poison. And I won't let you stay with me -- I can't. I can't.",
        "Brody: You can't let me love you? Try and stop me.",
