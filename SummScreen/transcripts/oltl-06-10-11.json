        "Clint informs Natalie and Joey for the first time that he is dying. But they urge him not to give up. He tells them his first priority is to make certain that they can be happy in their lives with the right respective people who are John for Natalie and Kelly for Joey. Yet Natalie and John are not ready to get back together while John focuses on taking Kelly home after she gets discharged from the hospital and expresses wanting to see her again although she is uncertain about that. Jack and his friend, Brad are determined to get revenge upon Shane and fool him into believing they are comicgurl15 on the computer although Shane is onto them. When Shane informs his mom what he knows Jack is doing, she has a secret plan to go and confront Jack assuming she can do it and get back in time for her wedding to Rex although she does not tell her son or her fianc\u00e9 of her secret plan. While Matthew is unconscious and the doctors tell Bo and Nora it's highly unlikely he will ever get better, Rex informs Bo that he's heard Clint is dying and awaiting an unlikely possibility of a heart transplant when he's heard that Clint has a rare blood type. Hearing that, Bo remembers that Matthew has the same blood type as his uncle and while the doctor tells them that donating Matthew's organs might be a way to make something positive of this very grim situation, it appears Bo is considering a plan. Nora tells him she refuses to let that happen and will not give up on Matthew. Meanwhile, Starr observes Destiny suddenly throwing up without an explanation, finds out that Destiny slept with Matthew not using protection, and concludes that it's entirely possible that Destiny could be pregnant. Original Todd finds his way to Dorian's home where \"current\" Todd is living and meets Sam for the first time."

        "John: Hi.",
        "Kelly: Hi.",
        "John: Where you going?",
        "Kelly: The doctors signed off on me this afternoon.",
        "John: That's great. You look great. Ready for a fight?",
        "Kelly: I wouldn't want to run into Natalie in a dark alley. She could probably still take me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Hey, Natalie. Look at you, up and dressed.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I was released.",
        "Joey: That's great! How's Dad?",
        "Natalie: Well, I guess we'll find out soon. I was on my way home when he called and said that he wanted me to come see him right away.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I got the same message. Any idea what's going on?",
        "Natalie: He didn't say. He looks really pale.",
        "Joey: No, he's just been there a long time. He probably just needs a little bit of company. I'm sure everything's gonna be fine. Ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Doc, that is 10 minutes of my life listening to numbers that don't mean anything to me. Just tell me.",
        "Jay: The numbers are bad, Clint. Your cardiac output is nowhere near what it should be.",
        "Clint: That thing that you put in me, the L-vad--it's not working?",
        "Jay: The left ventricle assist device is helping. It bought you some time, just not as much as we'd like.",
        "Clint: Put something else in there.",
        "Jay: There is nothing else, Clint. You need a new heart now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Bo, what is it?",
        "Bo: You said they put my brother at the top of the transplant list?",
        "Rex: Yeah. But it could take a while. They have to wait for a B-negative donor.",
        "Bo: Matthew's blood type. He's B-negative.",
        "Rex: So what are you saying? Do you think that Matthew's heart is a match for Clint?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Destiny, you should go home and get some sleep. Matthew will understand. You've been here...",
        "Destiny: Ooh, stop.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. Look, I want to help. I just don't know what to say. Maybe I can go--",
        "Destiny: I'm gonna be sick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Took you long enough.",
        "Brad: I had to sneak out. What's up?",
        "Jack: Like I told you, Wheezy is in love.",
        "Brad: So he totally went for fake magazine girl?",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah. Wheezy can't stop himself from e-mailing comicgurl15. The moron doesn't even know he's lusting after me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Comicgurl15 is Jack Manning?",
        "Shane: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Shane: He's messing with me for making him cry at the gym. He thinks he's getting back at me. Too bad I'm on to him, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I have no idea if Matthew's heart's a match for Clint, Balsom. I'm just saying they have the same blood type.",
        "Nora: Who does?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: I forgot my soda.",
        "Gigi: Are you sure it's not a girl that has a crush on you?",
        "Shane: Out of nowhere? She said she saw me at the comic convention, but look. She said her favorite \"Batman\" villain is Black Cat.",
        "Gigi: Black Cat? She's not D.C., she's Marvel.",
        "Shane: Thank you.",
        "Gigi: She dated Spiderman, for crying out loud. Who doesn't know that?",
        "Shane: Nobody who goes to a comic convention.",
        "Gigi: You're right. She's an imposter.",
        "Shane: Who showed up right after I dropped the weight on Manning's foot. It's got to be him.",
        "Gigi: Ok. Sold.",
        "Shane: Where you going?",
        "Gigi: To kick Jack Manning's bullying butt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Wheezy in love: This is so sweet.",
        "Jack: Isn't it?",
        "Brad: So do we go ahead with the plan?",
        "Jack: I'm still perfecting it, which is why I need you. You got to help me figure it out.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I can't stay long.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Brad: My mom's all over my case.",
        "Jack: So you're bailing?",
        "Brad: No. I'm just saying I got to be more careful.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Me, too. I'm under constant parental surveillance. That doesn't mean I'm giving up. Wheezy is going down.",
        "Sam: Who's Wheezy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Destiny? You ok? How are you feeling?",
        "Destiny: Stupid.",
        "Starr: You shouldn't.",
        "Destiny: I practically puked right in front of you.",
        "Starr: You weren't feeling well. It happens.",
        "Destiny: It doesn't happen to me. Besides, I don't have time to be sick. Matthew needs me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What's going on? Whose blood type are we talking about?",
        "Bo: Matthew's. He's B-negative, and it turns out Clint is, too.",
        "Nora: And? What does that have to do with anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jay: But the good news is you're still at the top of the transplant list.",
        "Clint: Hey, I'm number one.",
        "Jay: As soon as a compatible heart's available...",
        "Clint: Slim chance of that.",
        "Jay: What?",
        "Clint: My blood type, B-negative, is not exactly common.",
        "Jay: That's right.",
        "Clint: That's the first part, though, of being a match, right?",
        "Jay: Yes.",
        "Clint: How long do I have?",
        "Jay: That's hard to say.",
        "Clint: Weeks?",
        "Jay: Days. If I were you, I would get your affairs in order. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. Your family should be told about the situation.",
        "Clint: Kids, come on in. Doc, thanks a lot. Thank you.",
        "Jay: I'll be back soon.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Hey, Dad.",
        "Clint: Hi. Hey. You going home?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It's a good thing I bounce, huh?",
        "Joey: Dad, you all right? You want water?",
        "Natalie: Dad, is there something that they can give you for that?",
        "Clint: No, sweetheart, they can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I don't think Natalie's gonna be fighting anytime soon.",
        "Kelly: Oh, she won't?",
        "John: Don't quote me on it, but she's got better things to do.",
        "Kelly: Thanks to you. I heard you found Liam.",
        "John: We got lucky. Marty abandoned him and ran.",
        "Kelly: Any leads on where she is?",
        "John: She just up and disappeared.",
        "Kelly: She'll turn up.",
        "John: I don't know. She boarded a plane with enough fuel to take her across the Atlantic.",
        "Kelly: Wow.",
        "John: You know, we're not gonna take any chances. You're gonna have police protection as long as you need it.",
        "Kelly: No. No, don't do that.",
        "John: It's the least I can do. I owe you.",
        "Kelly: How do you figure that?",
        "John: I'm the reason Marty came after you.",
        "Kelly: John, she came after me because she's a sick woman. You didn't cause that. I should've seen her coming. In my family, we learn to look for the signs. Besides, I was distracted. So were you.",
        "John: Oh, yeah?",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm. We were wrapped up in each other.",
        "John: You say that like it's a bad thing.",
        "Kelly: No, no. I just think it might be time for a change.",
        "John: What kind of change?",
        "Kelly: Maybe we should stop seeing each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Thanks, kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What, are you spying now?",
        "Sam: You're not supposed to be on the computer. Mom said.",
        "Jack: I'm not on the computer. Got it?",
        "Sam: 10 bucks and I didn't see anything.",
        "Jack: 10 noogies if you say one word.",
        "Sam: Got to catch me first.",
        "Jack: You think you can outrun me? Ow! Oh, my God, that's my bad toe!",
        "Brad: Ha ha! Gimpy!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Mom, stop! You can't kick Jack's butt.",
        "Gigi: You've never seen me do it before, but, yes, I can, honey. Trust me.",
        "Shane: You'll just make things worse!",
        "Gigi: Ok. Sorry. You're right. I don't want to give you more trouble.",
        "Shane: I mean, it's great that you would do it and all. It's just I'm handling this. Ok?",
        "Gigi: You should just leave Jack alone.",
        "Shane: I'm standing up for myself.",
        "Gigi: Ok, that's good...",
        "Shane: What am I supposed to do? Just keep taking it until I can't anymore, and then I end up going off and k...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So how's Liam?",
        "Natalie: Oh, he's fine. He's fine. Thank God he's a baby. He didn't even know what was going on. He's at home with Brody, but he can't wait to see his grandpa. And Bree--she was asking about the card that she made you.",
        "Clint: Oh, yes, I got it. There's a big heart with a tinker bell bandage over it.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Joey, I bet she's running you ragged.",
        "Joey: No, no, not at all. Not at all. She and Ryder are the most fun that I have these days.",
        "Clint: They need you. All of you, you have to stick together now. And everybody that you love--they need to be close to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: We were just always reacting, and not to each other. We'd fall into bed to distract ourselves from how hurt we were.",
        "John: It wasn't only that, was it?",
        "Kelly: No, no. You were good to me. And when I was low, you were there.",
        "John: Back at you.",
        "Kelly: The truth is we're both in love with other people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Dad, what do you mean?",
        "Clint: I took care of Duke as best I could, but I'm not gonna be able to do that for your kids.",
        "Joey: Dad, you're a great grandpa, ok, and you're gonna be out of here in no time.",
        "Clint: No, I won't.",
        "Natalie: Is that what the doctor said? Because if you're just here for a while or you need a lot of physical therapy, we'll be here for you.",
        "Clint: Darling, there's nothing that you can do.",
        "Natalie: That's not true.",
        "Joey: Dad, we're gonna figure this out.",
        "Clint: I'm dying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What's going on?",
        "Bo: Nothing.",
        "Nora: You were talking about blood types for a reason.",
        "Bo: Because Balsom just told me that Clint's taken a turn for the worse. The only thing that can save him now is a transplant, but he's at the top of the list.",
        "Nora: That's good, right? That means he'll get the first available...God. You want to give Matthew's heart to your brother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Don't call me \"Gimpy.\"",
        "Brad: Hey, it's not my fault you can't control your little brother.",
        "Jack: What do you want? My mom lets him wander around.",
        "Brad: So next time, lock him up.",
        "Jack: Brad, you're a genius!",
        "Brad: I know. You're right...",
        "Jack: Just shut up and listen. I know exactly how we're gonna get Wheezy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You want to do something to hurt yourself?",
        "Shane: No.",
        "Gigi: Then why would you say that?",
        "Shane: I didn't. I just... nothing.",
        "Gigi: Ok. And now you're not talking.",
        "Shane: It's not a big deal. I swear.",
        "Gigi: You can talk to your new doctor about it, right?",
        "Shane: I know.",
        "Gigi: Are you still upset about Dr. Buhari?",
        "Shane: No. I mean, it's really bad what happened to her, but that's not...I'm ok, really. Just forget I said it. It doesn't mean anything. It just came out.",
        "Gigi: Are you that upset that Jack Manning is pulling this stunt?",
        "Shane: No.",
        "Gigi: If you ignore Jack, he'll get bored and move on.",
        "Shane: Why should I do that when I can beat him at his own game? If I ignore him, he'll just try something else. I got to draw the line, right?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. You should defend yourself, Shane. I.M. back that you're on to him, and then let it go. Ok? Promise me you'll just leave Jack Manning alone. Drop it, ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So?",
        "Brad: Pretty good.",
        "Jack: \"Pretty good?\" It's perfect.",
        "Brad: Let me know what I can do.",
        "Jack: You can't leave. We're doing this now.",
        "Brad: Now? As in today?",
        "Jack: Exactly. Total retaliation right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Here. Just have a little sip.",
        "Destiny: Yeah. I don't want a repeat. It must've been that burrito. Hospital cafeteria food--oh, who knows how long it was under that heat lamp?",
        "Starr: I don't think that that's it. I had half of it, and I'm fine. Do you have a fever?",
        "Destiny: No.",
        "Starr: Maybe it's stress, right? You said you're trying to be here for Matthew.",
        "Destiny: He is my best friend. I can't lose you, not now, not after what happened in your bed. You said it meant something to you. It meant something to me, too.",
        "Starr: Not just a best friend. You guys have been a lot more than that lately.",
        "Destiny: Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Starr: Destiny, do you think that there's any chance you could be pregnant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: That's it, isn't it? You want to take Matthew's heart?",
        "Bo: I didn't say that.",
        "Nora: No, you don't have to. And you can stop thinking about it, because the answer is no!",
        "Bo: I wasn't asking.",
        "Nora: I'm not letting anyone take Matthew's heart. They'll have to cut mine out first! Our son is not dead! Dr. Pryor says there's some brain activity, and we're not killing him!",
        "Bo: I never said that!",
        "Nora: Then what are you doing?! Why are you comparing blood types?!",
        "Rex: I'm the one who said it, Nora, ok? I just told Bo that Clint would get the next B-negative heart that was available.",
        "Bo: We just talked to Dr. Pryor about organ donation just in case Matt--we've been talking about his blood type, and it was on my mind and it just--it came out.",
        "Rex: Believe me, nobody's suggested that Matthew donate anything to Clint. He can get his heart from somewhere else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: My heart is failing. No way around it.",
        "Natalie: So is that why you confessed everything that you did? Dad, how long have you known? Why didn't you tell us?",
        "Clint: You kids didn't need to be worrying about that.",
        "Joey: We're not kids.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah, you are. You're my kids, always will be.",
        "Joey: We should've been here. Do Kevin and Cord--do they know that...",
        "Clint: Kevin and Cord are doing exactly what they should be doing--keeping B.E. afloat so there's something to provide for all of you.",
        "Natalie: Joey and I are here. We could've been doing...",
        "Clint: Could've been doing what? Could've been sitting here, waiting for a better answer?",
        "Joey: Yeah, or finding one.",
        "Clint: Son, I've tried everything. I didn't tell you, because I'd hoped that I didn't have to. But so far, nothing's worked.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I'm not giving up. There's got to be a doctor around here somewhere who could do something!",
        "Clint: There's only one thing that can help me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Pryor: Jay? I heard you have a cardiac patient on the transplant list?",
        "Jay: At the top of the list. He hasn't got long.",
        "Dr. Pryor: We should talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Don't let me get in the way. You should go to Joey and make it happen.",
        "Kelly: He married a woman who didn't love him. He had no idea. It takes time to get over that, for both of us. So I don't know what's gonna happen next. Maybe we'll be together, maybe we won't.",
        "John: Maybe you just need some time alone.",
        "Kelly: What I want is to figure things out with Joey. And I won't do that hiding out with you. You know, I put myself out there. I put everything on the line for him. I mean, don't I owe it to myself to let it play out? You did that with Natalie. You put yourself out there, John. Don't you owe it to her to let it play out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: We can find you a heart, Dad.",
        "Clint: There's no time, Joey.",
        "Natalie: Then we'll find you one fast, ok? You're not giving up! You hear me?",
        "Clint: I can't control this, darling. And what time I have left I want to spend with my family.",
        "Joey: We're not going anywhere.",
        "Clint: Yeah, you are right now, because I'm sending you on a mission, both of you.",
        "Joey: Name it.",
        "Clint: Before I die, I want to see you both with the people who will make you happy for the rest of your lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What is happening to Clint is terrible, and I'm very sorry for him. I really am. But our thoughts--our thoughts can only be for our son right now. Ok? We have to fight for Matthew until he can wake up and fight for himself. And he will get better. So I don't want to hear another word about blood types or organ donation, not even a whisper about how our son cannot be saved. Agreed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Who is this guy who keeps saying he's Todd Manning?",
        "Sam: Who are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I'm sorry, Rex. I'm sorry.",
        "Rex: No, no. Listen, it's ok. I understand, ok? When Shane was so sick from cancer, Gigi and I were very scared. But he--Shane got a miracle. Matthew will get his, too.",
        "Nora: Excuse me.",
        "Rex: I shouldn't have said anything about Clint. I'm gonna go before I put my foot in my mouth.",
        "Bo: You don't have to take off.",
        "Rex: No, actually, I do. I would stay with you here all night, but Gigi's waiting for me, so--",
        "Bo: Hey, you got your suit. Must be a big night, huh?",
        "Rex: It is. We're getting married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm still waiting on that promise.",
        "Shane: Mom, come on.",
        "Gigi: What's that I hear? What is that sound? Bells? Wedding bells? Today is our wedding day, dude, the Morasco/Balsom event of the year. Can I please just marry your father without having to worry about you and Jack Manning being in a fight?",
        "Shane: Yes.",
        "Gigi: Thank you. Are you ready?",
        "Shane: I already took a shower.",
        "Gigi: Ooh! Catch me. I might faint. All right. How about some proper clothes to match that shower-fresh smell, best man? Get dressed.",
        "Shane: Ok.",
        "Gigi: And I'll be keeping this. Just so you're not tempted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You think I'm pregnant?",
        "Starr: I'm just saying it could be possible.",
        "Destiny: No way.",
        "Starr: Destiny, you said you slept with Matthew right before he got sick. I started with morning sickness pretty early on.",
        "Destiny: It's not morning, is it? Starr, you said it yourself. It could just be the stress. Just because I threw up doesn't mean I'm pregnant.",
        "Starr: As long as you're sure...",
