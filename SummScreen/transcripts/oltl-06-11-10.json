        "Langston is at the police station writing a formal confession when John McBain brings Markko into the interview room. John and Brody leave the room and listen to the intercom. They hear Langston and Markko tell each other that they are innocent. John releases them both. Markko tells Langston that they are done. Starr offers Todd a ride home from the hospital, but he says he is going to wait for Ford to wale up so he can talk to him. He wonders why Tea hasn't called him. Tea is in an appointment with Dr Evans. He tells her that her tumor has not gotten any smaller. Todd goes into the hospital and Starr gets in her car to leave, but her car won't start. Todd gets off the elevator and sees Tea taking a pill. She tells him she is taking prescription medication for migraines. When Tea leaves, he sneaks a look at her medical file. Ford's brother James is about to tell about some trouble that he is in when Ford opens his eyes. James tells Robert that he is in the hospital because someone tried to kill him. A man comes to the hospital and asks a nurse if she has seen James. James comes out of Ford's room and sees the man, so he runs. When he gets to the parking garage, Starr asks him to help her start her car, so he does. When the man finds him in the parking garage, James tells Starr to get in the car and tears out of there. John goes to the hospital to ask Ford what happened to him.",
        "Charlie and Dorian walk in on David and Viki doing a yoga session that makes Viki scream out David's name. Viki says it isn't what it looks like. David says it is. He shows Dorian the pictures of her and Charlie that Viki has on her desk. Dorian says they are working in those pictures. Viki shows Dorian the picture that Todd sent her and asks what she is working on that makes it appear that she is about to kiss Charlie. Viki tells Dorian that she trust Charlie, but she doesn't trust her. Viki hires David to even the playing field. Jessica thanks Brody for giving her life back. She goes into Todd's office and finds Kelly in Todd's chair. Kelly says she has been working there for a while. She says she is working on the Robert Ford story and the guy seems like a snake that preys on vulnerable women. Jessica tells Kelly about repressing the memory of Mitch Laurence trying to have sex with her. She is about to tell her about the night with Ford that triggered her memory, but Todd calls Kelly and interrupts the conversation. Kelly rehires Jessica as a reporter for the Sun."

        "Starr: Okay. There you go, sweetie, safe and sound. You want me to drop you off somewhere?",
        "Todd: Oh, no. That's okay. Thanks.",
        "Starr: Well, are you sure? You already had your driver send Jack home.",
        "Todd: Well, yeah. I'm going to stay here at the hospital and wait for Ford to wake up so I can talk to him.",
        "Starr: Gosh, I hope that Ford wakes up soon for Markko's sake.",
        "Todd: Who cares about Markko? The important thing is, if Ford tells the cops that Hannah tried to kill him, maybe they'll believe me that she's framing me for pushing Marty.",
        "Starr: What does T\u00e9a think about your theory?",
        "Todd: I don't know. She hasn't got a hold of me. Some lawyer. You'd think that representing her client would be the most important thing on her mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Is this going to take long? Because I have two high profile criminal cases that need my attention.",
        "Greg: No. I just want to review your progress.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, just cut to the chase. Am I dying soon or sooner?",
        "Greg: So far, there's no significant change in the size of your tumor.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha! So the answer is sooner. Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, yes. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, David!",
        "Dorian: Oh, David! What on earth is going on here?",
        "Viki: Dorian? Sweetheart, when did you get here?",
        "Dorian: Is four a crowd?",
        "Viki: Ha ha ha! I never thought I'd be saying this, but this is so not what it looks like.",
        "David: Au contraire. This is exactly what it looks like. Ow!",
        "Charlie: I'm sure there is a perfectly rational explanation, Viki.",
        "Dorian: Yes, Viki. We are all ears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, thanks again for last night.",
        "Brody: You don't have to thank me for loving you.",
        "Jessica: Okay. I take it back. Well, how can I not thank you? You gave me my life back.",
        "Brody: Well, then I guess we're even.",
        "Jessica: Okay. I got to go, but hopefully later on, I will have some good news. I love you. Bye. Hey, do you got a second? Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Jessica. Ha ha ha!",
        "Jessica: Hey! You're working here?",
        "Kelly: Oh, I guess we really haven't gotten around to having that talk.",
        "Jessica: Well, you seemed pretty busy at Bo and Nora's wedding. How long have you been working here?",
        "Kelly: A while. Todd hired me, you know, when you were --",
        "Jessica: Being a self-involved teenager?",
        "Kelly: You are better now. You can be a self-involved adult.",
        "Jessica: Ha ha! Let's hope not, but I do have to ask you for a favor.",
        "Kelly: Sure. How can I help you?",
        "Jessica: Do you know where my uncle is?",
        "Kelly: Todd is out, which is actually very good because I can get some work done without arguing over who gets which desk.",
        "Jessica: Ooh, so what is it today, celebrity meltdown, political scandal?",
        "Kelly: I am putting a final polish on a piece about the Llanview University teacher who was assaulted.",
        "Jessica: I read about that.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. Well, there's more to it than meets the eye, not that he deserved what Markko Rivera did to him, for sure.",
        "Jessica: No, no, of course not.",
        "Kelly: You know what, though? The more I learn about this Ford guy, the more he sounds to me like a real snake who preyed on vulnerable women.",

        "[EKG beeping]",
        "James: And I messed up -- bad, and the only person that I can tell is you and only because you can't hear me. So the thing is -- Bobby? Bobby, bro, man, it's me.",
        "Ford: Jimmy, what's going on?",
        "James: Man, you're in the hospital.",
        "Ford: Hospital? Why?",
        "James: Dude, somebody tried to kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: You? You are the one who confessed?",
        "Langston: Yeah. I'm the one who tried to kill Ford. I can't let you pay for something that I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So what's with your bodyguard? I mean, he actually stopped me on my way in.",
        "Kelly: Sorry. Dorian thinks I need protection while I'm digging around for clues about my mother's death.",
        "Jessica: Clues?",
        "Kelly: I have reason to suspect that my mother didn't die of natural causes.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God.",
        "Kelly: Well, you know what? John is looking into it for me, so --",
        "Jessica: Well, have you found anything yet?",
        "Kelly: No, nothing concrete, but in the meantime, Shaun and I are stuck together like glue, which makes it a little difficult for me to get any closer to Reed.",
        "Jessica: Oh, didn't look like you guys were having any trouble getting close at Bo and Nora's wedding.",
        "Kelly: You know what? We are getting to know each other. That's all.",
        "Jessica: Really? That's all?",
        "Kelly: Yes. I like him, okay, which is why we are taking things slow.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Kelly: What about you? I saw you dancing with your handsome man.",
        "Jessica: And?",
        "Kelly: And it was great to see you so happy.",
        "Jessica: I am. I am. You know, Brody and I are finally back together. We just picked up right where we left off.",
        "Kelly: That's great. That sounds so nice, no distractions, you know, no noisy neighbors or armed giants outside your door.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no. Guess it seems like things didn't go as well between you and Reed as you hoped.",
        "Kelly: Oh, you know what? I think we're talking about you and Brody.",
        "Jessica: You know, it's just that all this time that I spent pushing him away, I pushed him away for all those months because I was stuck in the past. It's like none of it ever happened.",
        "Kelly: Well, that's good, isn't it?",
        "Jessica: Except I know that it did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: We checked out Langston.",
        "John: Hmm, and we have her signed confession.",
        "Langston: So you have to formally arrest me and let Markko go, right?",
        "John: Well, we want to make sure everything is in order first. Why don't you have a seat?",
        "Langston: But I already told you everything.",
        "John: Yeah, yeah, that you went back to Ford's apartment later that night. The two of you argued. Is that correct?",
        "Langston: Yeah. That's right.",
        "John: During the course of that argument, you got angry. You picked up one of his awards, and you struck him.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "John: And Ford was facing you, right, when you hit them. When you picked up that award, you brought it over your head, and you hit him on the right side. Is that what you said in your statement?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "John: Mm-hmm. You said you kept hitting him. It was five times?",
        "Langston: I can't remember exactly. I guess it was five. Yeah.",
        "John: Well, then, it looks like we have a little problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Someone tried to kill me?",
        "James: Yeah. You mean, you don't remember any of it?",
        "Nurse: His monitor showed a spike in his heart rate.",
        "James: He just woke up. That means he's going to be okay, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: If we prove that Hannah tried to kill Ford and lie about seeing you push Marty, then we would be able to clear two of T\u00e9a's clients.",
        "Todd: Who's the other one?",
        "Starr: She's representing Markko, too.",
        "Todd: Guess that means that Cole is gonna be the only one doing hard time.",
        "Starr: Dad?",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Starr: Don't.",
        "Todd: All right.",
        "Starr: Just because Cole and I are going through a hard time right now doesn't mean I'm going to sit here and let you trash him. Look. I'm going through a lot right now, and I've gotten more support from a total stranger than I have from my own father.",
        "Todd: Which total stranger?",
        "Starr: That's not the point.",
        "Todd: Well, you're my daughter. I don't want you talking to strangers. Of course, if I had to choose between Cole and a total stranger --",
        "Starr: I don't want to talk about Cole right now. I don't, okay? I need to focus on graduation and on my daughter, which you should be doing yourself.",
        "Todd: I already graduated.",
        "Starr: I'm talking about your daughter Dani.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah. Well, I just want to concentrate on me right now, on clearing my name. That way, I can be there for the kids who actually care if I live or die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Hey, let's not jump to any conclusions, okay? Now, we've just recently started treatments. It can take a while to see positive results.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't have to soft-pedal this. The treatments aren't working, right?",
        "Greg: T\u00e9a, I know how frustrating this must be for you, but there's still a chance that we can shrink the size of this tumor with continued radiation. Right now is not the time to quit.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. I am not quitting. I will do whatever it takes to get as much time with Daniella as possible.",
        "Greg: Good. That's what I wanted to hear. So how is Dani handling things? You still haven't told her?",
        "T\u00e9a: Greg, she had such a tough year last year. She is just starting to have a life. She has friends. The last thing I want to do is weigh her down with this, okay?",
        "Greg: Danielle needs to be prepared for whatever may happen.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Greg: Look. If you're that concerned, the counseling services for cancer patients and their families are excellent.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Greg: Excuse me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Greg: Dr. Evans. Okay. I'll be right there. I'm sorry. I have an emergency.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. I understand. Would it be okay if I just hung out here for a second? I promise not to redecorate your office like I did last time.",
        "Greg: No. Of course, of course. Take as much time as you like --",
        "T\u00e9a: All right.",
        "Greg: But I do want you to read this. I think it might help.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "Greg: Okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thanks.",
        "Greg: Of course. Hey --",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah?",
        "Greg: I'll see you at our next appointment.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thanks.",
        "Greg: Okay.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Okay. Truce. You don't want to talk about Cole. I don't want to talk about Dani, either. What you want to graduation?",
        "Starr: Thanks, Dad, but no one can give me what I want.",
        "Todd: How about a new car?",
        "Starr: A new car? You just got me one for my 16th birthday.",
        "Todd: This one is starting to get dirty. Let's get you a new one.",
        "Starr: Dad, I don't need a fancy graduation present.",
        "Todd: Ooh, tough luck. I'm going to get you one, anyway. See you later.",
        "Starr: Dad --",
        "Todd: Hmm?",
        "Starr: I hope you find the answers that you are looking for.",
        "Todd: Of course. No signal. Delgado, what are you doing to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: \"Your instinct may be to spare your loved ones pain by choosing not to burden them with your diagnosis, but those who know you best will probably sense that something is wrong.\" [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Ohh! Okay, hope. You ready to go -- home? You are already asleep. So much for mama getting work done during your nap time. Okay.",
        "[Starter clicking]",
        "Starr: No. Oh -- great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: \"People who love you want to help. You can ease your burden by sharing it with someone you trust.\" Oh, someone you trust. Oh --",

        "Todd: What the hell is the matter with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Darling, I was feeling very tense.",
        "David: The operative word being \"feeling.\" Wait. No. That's not right.",
        "Viki: Look. My shoulders were really tight, okay, and David was helping me --",
        "David: Achieve serenity.",
        "Viki: Yeah, what he said.",
        "Dorian: I cannot believe that I had to find out that you are back in town from Charlie, and now I find out you've been spending all of your time in flagrante au naturel with Viki?",
        "David: That's not all I was doing. I was drinking unblessed wine, smoking illegal cigars, and bathing my father in tomato juice, oh, and did you hear? I got to perform the ceremony bonding Bo and Nora together in Holy Matrimony, but I got to say, helping Viki, that's been my favorite activity so far.",
        "Charlie: Okay. All I want to know is why you are so stressed out in the first place.",
        "David: What? Are you kidding? Well, let's take a look at this, shall we? It's called charlian.",
        "Dorian: Oh, my goodness, Viki, are you so insecure? Why, these are promo shots for the urban renewal center. Charlie and I are working.",
        "Viki: Really? Tell me, what exactly are you promoting in this picture? Doesn't look to me like you're working. In fact, it looks a hell of a lot like you're about to kiss him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: See, the thing is, Langston, we arrested Markko on good evidence, and we can't just put someone else behind bars unless we can make it stick.",
        "Langston: But you have my confession. It's right there.",
        "John: Yeah. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to call the commissioner. Brody, you want to pull the evidence file? Two of you just sit tight. We'll be back in a minute.",
        "Brody: Langston didn't know which award Ford was clocked with. She also didn't know what angle or how many times. She's lying.",
        "John: I know.",
        "Brody: Which is why we're not going to call the commissioner on his honeymoon.",
        "John: No. You know, look. I know they don't want to tell us the truth, but I'm pretty sure they're not going to lie to each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Markko, please say something.",
        "Markko: You confessed.",
        "Langston: Yeah, even though we both know I didn't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Let me see his numbers.",
        "James: What's going on?",
        "Greg: Welcome back, Mr. Ford. I'm Dr. Evans, and I'm going to run a few tests. Call the police, Detective John McBain. I want him to know when this patient regained consciousness.",
        "Nurse: Right away.",
        "Greg: Okay. I'm just going to run a quick examination here.",
        "Ford: Mm-hmm.",

        "Dorian: Oh, that Jack. Oh, wow, I tell you, the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree.",
        "David: It's apple, not acorn.",
        "Dorian: No one asked you. I cannot believe that imp sent you that photograph.",
        "Viki: Well, he didn't. The tree did -- Todd.",
        "Dorian: Oh, well, my point entirely. Todd will do anything, misrepresent the truth, to get me in trouble.",
        "Viki: And Todd will do anything to protect me.",
        "David: Todd may have sent that picture, but he certainly didn't pose it. You look awfully chummy there with Charlie.",
        "Dorian: There's a perfectly good explanation for that picture.",
        "Viki: Really? We're all ears.",
        "Charlie: All I'm saying is, there was no kiss, and I swear on my life, I never had any intention whatsoever of kissing Dorian.",
        "Viki: I know that, darling. I know that. Thank you.",
        "David: What about you, hot lips? What's going through your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Why'd you tell the police you tried to kill Ford if you didn't?",
        "Langston: Isn't it obvious? I didn't want you to go prison.",
        "Markko: So, you're willing to go to prison instead? This is probably just your guilty conscience talking.",
        "Langston: Markko, I will be sorry for the rest of my life for hurting you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Markko just told us he didn't do it.",
        "Brody: And how did he get Ford's blood on his shoes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I don't want to talk about this right now.",
        "Langston: And when do you want to talk about? You won't return my calls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Markko claimed he went back to Ford's apartment to confront him. The door wasn't locked. He went inside and found him.",
        "Brody: Why didn't he call 911?",
        "John: He thought this guy was dead. You know, he knew how it would look, so he panicked.",
        "Brody: You think he's telling the truth?",
        "John: With how pissed off Markko is, there's no way he'd let Langston take the fall if he's guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Look. I know that you're probably really mad at me and at Ford, so I understand how things might have gotten out of hand that night.",
        "Markko: That son of a bitch got what he deserved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It must have been so hard for Brody to watch me throw myself at Cristian.",
        "Kelly: Brody knew you weren't being yourself. I mean, he had faith in you.",
        "Jessica: I don't know how.",
        "Kelly: Because you're worth it, thank you very much.",
        "Jessica: No. I just know I'm really, really lucky to have everything back, you know, Brody and Bree and Natalie and grown-up friends with grown-up conversation.",
        "Kelly: Aw, so what happened? I mean, did all your memories just come back just like that or --",
        "Jessica: Oh, kind of. I was with Brody at the prom, and I had this tiniest flash. It was me and Brody dancing when we were all alone at Rodi's.",
        "Kelly: But that was it?",
        "Jessica: No. Well, I didn't want to remember, and at first, I thought it was because I didn't want to give up on Cristian, but really, it was because I didn't want to know what I had forgotten, which was that my biological father, Mitch Laurence, wanted to have sex with me so I would have his child.",
        "Kelly: He is so sick.",
        "Jessica: So my memory kind of retreated to a more innocent time because I couldn't deal with it.",
        "Kelly: I'm so sorry about that. I can't even imagine how difficult that was, to remember something so awful so suddenly.",
        "Jessica's voice: No!",
        "Jessica: Yeah. It was hard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Do you know why you're here?",
        "Ford: Uh, someone tried to kill me. Is that right?",
        "Greg: Yeah. You suffered some serious blows to your head which required surgery.",
        "Ford: Am I going to be all right?",
        "Greg: Well, everything looks good, but I want to do another CT scan just to get a clear picture.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: What the hell is the matter with you? I got a headache. I'm taking something.",
        "Todd: No. I mean -- just a second. I mean, what are you doing about my case? Did you get my message?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, about how you think that the girl who accused you of pushing Marty also tried to kill Ford.",
        "Todd: Yeah. That's the one. What are you doing about it?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I -- whoa.",
        "Todd: Hey, jackass, watch where you're going! So anyway, about Ford --",

        "Todd: Well, I've got people working on that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why does that make me nervous?",
        "Todd: Listen. All I'm hoping for right now is that Ford saw Hannah attack him.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, last I heard, Ford had woken up from surgery yet.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Is that why you're here, to check up on them?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Todd: So I saw Dani today.",
        "T\u00e9a: You did?",
        "Todd: Yes, sir, and she wouldn't speak to me, wouldn't even look at me. You know what's curious? Everyone tells me, \"Todd, you got to keep trying.\" Starr tells me, \"you got to keep trying,\" and I think, \"I don't know, man. It's a lost cause to me. She's just -- \" I'm never going to have a relationship with her.",
        "T\u00e9a: You do have to keep trying, Todd.",
        "Todd: But she's made it abundantly clear to me that she's not interested in it. She doesn't need me at all.",

        "Langston: Do you know what's going to happen to you?",

        "Langston: Didn't you?",

        "Todd: So you think because I've done such a smash up job with Starr that I could show Dani the way, too?",
        "T\u00e9a: Please, just don't give up on her, okay?",
        "Todd: Well, as far as I can see it, the only way she'll let me be her father is if I'm cleared of these charges, which means you have to get me off.",

        "T\u00e9a: On something?",
        "Todd: I saw you popping pills when I stepped off the elevator, T\u00e9a. This isn't the first time I've seen you, either.",

        "Starr: Oh, I wouldn't even ask you, except for that my car, it won't start, and my cell phone doesn't even get any signal.",
        "James: Why don't you go back inside and call?",
        "Starr: I would, but Hope is sleeping in the car. Look. Could you just go inside and call a mechanic? If won't take long. I have the number right here.",
        "James: You know what? How about I do you one better? You know what? I work with cars, so why don't you pop the hood?",
        "Starr: What? But are you sure? I mean, it would just be faster for you to go inside.",

        "Jessica: I doubt that.",
        "Kelly: I think your story would be an amazing human interest piece.",
        "Jessica: In the \"Sun\"?",
        "Kelly: Yes. Yes, okay? Think about it. A woman, okay, who was trapped in her past by an evil man brought to her present by the love of a good one. I can see the headline.",
        "Jessica: What, \"Unhinged Heiress Turns to Terror Teen\"?",
        "Kelly: No. I was thinking something more like \"Love Conquers All,\" huh?",

        "Kelly: Well, whatever you want.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no. It's not that. It's just, I finally got everything back, and I'm not sure I want to relive the reason why I lost it.",
        "Kelly: Of course. Of course. You know what? I'm not even thinking. I'm not even thinking. I just think I want to write about something that has a nice and happy ending. I mean, this whole Robert Ford story is so grisly.",
        "Jessica's voice: Stay away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me!",
        "Kelly: Jessica, is something wrong?",
        "Jessica: Um, yeah. Yeah. There is something wrong. The night that I got my memory back, something happened.",

        "Dorian: Hmm, well, my duties as mayor are calling me. Excuse me, everyone. I'll see you, Charlie, back at the office. Pardonnez moi.",
        "Viki: I trust Charlie. I don't trust you farther than I can throw you, which is not very far, and I am warning you, lady. Charlie is my husband, and you cannot have him.",

        "Kelly: I'm sure he was right.",
        "Jessica: And before I remembered, he told me. He didn't mean to. He was just really frustrated --",
        "Kelly: He must have been pretty desperate.",
        "Jessica: But I got really angry, Kelly, and I told him that I never wanted to see him again, and I really meant it, but then I went --",

        "Kelly: Yeah. You bet. I guess I should see what your uncle wants.",
        "Jessica: Oh, I almost forgot. That's why I came here in the first place. I wanted to speak to Uncle Todd to see if I can get my reporter job back. Can you ask him if that's possible?",

        "John: So there's no reason why he shouldn't be able to tell us what happened.",
        "Greg: No medical reasons, no, but the mind responds to trauma in very different ways. I can't promise that he'll be able to recall the events that led him here.",
