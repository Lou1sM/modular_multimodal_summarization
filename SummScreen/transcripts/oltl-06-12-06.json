        "\"I remember,\" Margaret tells Spencer. Spencer tells her that he hasn't ever met her before and knows nothing about her. He tells the guard that he wants to speak to her alone in his office. He takes Margaret inside and asks her why she is making all this up. \"I am not making this up,\" she says. \"How could someone make up something like a baby?\" Nash wants to head home, but Bruce talks him out of it. \"Your daughter and Tess will be killed.\" Nash thinks how killing Reston will stop all of this from happening. \"We will kill his money, use his daughter. Take his power \" Bruce has another thought. \"What do you think Tess is going to think about this when she hears how you used Claudia to get what you want?\" Spencer continues to deny, deny, deny. \"I know that you faked my death,\" Margaret continues. \"I have never seen you before,\" Spencer says. \"Where did we meet?\" Bo watches the monitor seeing that things are not going as planned. \"Well the police,\" Margaret starts. \"Ah! The police?\" Spencer asks rhetorically. Bo can see that Spencer is onto Margaret now. \"Get her out of there!\" Hugh has the reports. They figure that Spencer might have signed them and if that is the case, they will have something to work with. Hugh takes the papers out of the file and hands them to John. \"Spencer didn't sign them. It's the commissioner's seal it's signed by Bo Buchanan \" Bo grabs the papers to see for himself. Margaret rides the van to the hospital. She sees a picture of herself in the paper that the medic escorting her is reading. The memories come flooding back. She remembers being pregnant rocking in her rocking chair looking at pictures of Todd Spencer ridiculing her Spencer and Paige helping her give birth A look of realization comes to her face. \"It was Spencer! It was all Spencer!\""

        "Adriana: Rex.",
        "Rex: Sorry, Adriana. I didn't mean to -- wait, did you think that I was --",
        "Adriana: The stalker? What do you think?",
        "Rex: But that guy hasn't bothered you for weeks.",
        "Adriana: He's back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bruce: Here.",
        "Nash: I'm going back to Llanview.",
        "Bruce: Are you nuts?",
        "Nash: Tess needs me. My daughter needs me.",
        "Bruce: Get a grip, Nash. You can't go home until the plan is in place. You go near Tess and the kid too soon --",
        "Nash: What part of this don't you get? Brennan is mine. I need to be there.",
        "Bruce: All right, use your head, damn it. You made a deal with Claudia's old man. If you go anywhere near Llanview before we break Reston, he'll kill Tess and your daughter.",
        "Nash: Not if I kill him first.",
        "Antonio: Welcome home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh. I can't believe this is happening finally -- the three of us. It was so nice of Carlotta to take Jamie tonight, too.",
        "Antonio: We need a little time to get settled.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. You see? Everything can work out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hey, come on, what is this about?",
        "John: I wouldn't let you go in Truman's office.",
        "Blair: Come on, I -- what the hell?",
        "Spencer: Well, hello there.",
        "Blair: Margaret's wearing a wire?",
        "Margaret: I remember.",
        "Spencer: What's this about?",
        "Margaret: Oh, don't worry. I didn't tell them anything. Your secret is safe with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: He's back? How do you know?",
        "Adriana: I got another text message. I just know it's him. What are you doing?",
        "Rex: I'm calling whatever number he was texting from. It's ringing. There's no answer, but I'll get a trace set up. I will find this creep, I promise.",
        "Layla: Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have your attention, please. You guys are in for a real treat. Tonight's singer is making her Llanview debut, but she's so good, we're making her a regular. So, without further ado, Capricorn is pleased to introduce Claudia Reston. Give it up, people!",
        "Claudia: Wow. Thank you. I think I'm going to like it here. I would like to start with one of my favorites. It's a song about letting go of the past, moving on -- something I think we can all relate to. Where do I go when it's all blown over? Where do I start when it's all gone to the dogs? I am not bitter I am just trying to recover from my island of loneliness",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bruce: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it, hold it. You don't mean -- you're not actually planning on killing this guy?",
        "Nash: Yeah, I am going to kill him, and so are you. We're going to kill him financially, we're going to destroy his family, because that's all he cares about -- his businesses and his daughter, and in that order. The only backbone he's got he pays for. You take away his businesses, you take away his bucks, you take away his power. What's with the look?",
        "Bruce: Never saw you this way before, that's all. Not even when you were willing to do almost anything for your vineyard. Well, you were determined then. It's -- now it's like you're -- well, you're ruthless.",
        "Nash: Reston wants to take me away from my family. The only way I know how to stop him is to destroy him, which means it's my life or his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Will you stop reading those damn notes and talk to me?",
        "Man: I'm reviewing the details of your case, Mr. Vickers.",
        "David: I'm not a lawyer, but maybe you should -- I don't know -- talk? How are you going to get me out of this hellhole? Look at me -- look at me. Hey, look at -- I can give you the \"reader's digest\" of what's in there. The cops say that they have an eyewitness who almost saw me shoot Thomas Mc Bain 25 years ago.",
        "Lawyer: Mm-hmm. It also says here that you have no alibi.",
        "David: Is the ink even dry on your diploma? Did you even pass the bar exam?",
        "Lawyer: You are welcome to find other representation.",
        "David: Just tell me what I got to do to get out of here.",
        "Lawyer: All you can do is fight for the minimum sentence.",
        "David: Which is?",
        "Lawyer: 20 years.",
        "David: Oh --",
        "Lawyer: I'll see you at your arraignment. Guard?",
        "David: What are you -- where you going? Why are you leaving so soon? Why are you leaving? Did I offend you? What did I say? I thought lawyers had thick skin. Cheap tie. Guard, get Mc Bain. I want to talk to Mc Bain!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Hugh: It's the lab.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: I'm sorry, Ms. Cochran, but I've never met you.",
        "Margaret: Oh, I -- I beg to differ.",
        "Spencer: Right. You know, I'm a colleague of this woman's psychiatrist. We're just going to step in my office, have a private conversation for a moment if you don't mind. We'll just be right in here.",
        "Spencer: So you were saying -- you think you remember something?",
        "Margaret: Yes, you, from before. It's what everybody's been saying. It took me a while, but then it all came back to me.",
        "Spencer: I'm sorry, Ms. Cochran, I'm afraid you're mistaken. I have never met you personally.",
        "John: He's just messing with her head.",
        "Officer: Lieutenant Mc Bain, sorry to interrupt.",
        "John: What is it, Mc Manus?",
        "Ofc. Mc Manus: David Vickers wants to see you.",
        "John: Ok. Thanks.",
        "Bo: Maybe he's ready to give his brother up.",
        "John: If he does, Truman can work Margaret over all he wants. We'll still nail him. I'll let you know.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "Spencer: So whatever it is you think you're remembering, I'm sorry. You -- you've made it up.",
        "Margaret: I didn't make up having a baby, doctor.",
        "Spencer: You remember giving birth?",
        "Margaret: How could somebody forget something like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bruce: Just so we're clear here, I signed on to ruin Reston. And I'm still onboard with that as long as I get a cut.",
        "Nash: Oh, all right, you'll get your cut. Reston is already morally bankrupt, his bank account might as well follow.",
        "Bruce: Ok, but we can't rush it. Reston's no dummy. We can't have him catching on.",
        "Nash: Hmm. Not as long as you hold up your end of the agreement. You're his financial advisor, he trusts you. Convince him to put the vineyard in Claudia's name.",
        "Bruce: And the end game is?",
        "Nash: I go home to Tess and my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Antonio, this would be hard for anyone. But we have to be honest with each other, otherwise this is going to be impossible.",
        "Antonio: Look, honey, I love Brennan as if she were my own, same way you love Jamie. And we can be a family, the four of us, and we will be. All right? I'm not naive enough to think that Nash is going to stay away forever. All right, look -- he always said that if he was the father, he intends to be a part of her life. Now, there's nothing we can do about that, but I can help prevent you from having to go through what I went through with Jamie. Ok, we can guarantee that if he comes back and tries to fight for custody, he'll never win.",
        "Jessica: How?",
        "Antonio: Marry me. Marry me, and let me adopt the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Remembering giving birth, but having no memory of what happened to your baby -- that must be frightening.",
        "Margaret: It's a nightmare.",
        "Spencer: You poor thing. Well, I can see you have a lot of work to do with your court-appointed psychiatrist. That would explain the police guard, would it not?",
        "Margaret: No, I remember what you made me do.",
        "Spencer: Ms. Cochran, that's impossible. We have never met before, and I've never spoken to you in my life.",
        "Blair: What are you waiting for him to say, Bo?",
        "Spencer: I hope you get the help you need.",
        "Bo: Anything I can use.",
        "Spencer: I truly do.",
        "Margaret: I know you planned my fake death, ok?",
        "Bo: Come on, Spencer. Give us what we want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What do you want, Vickers?",
        "David: I'll take the deal. If you let me walk, I'll tell you everything you want to know about Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Adopt Brennan? Antonio, she already has a father.",
        "Antonio: Yes, honey, I realize that. But technically, Nash has abandoned his daughter. He's set up no fund or trust, no financial support for the baby. I mean, we'd have to petition the court to adopt, but if he doesn't show up, it would probably be granted. And -- and if he does eventually come back, then we'd have already secured a home for the baby, which means no judge in the country would take her away from us. What do you say?",
        "Jessica: Antonio, I love you so much. And I really want to be your wife and I want you to raise my children and I want to raise yours, but --",
        "Antonio: But?",
        "Jessica: My answer is no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bruce: Reston trusts me. Getting him to put the vineyard in Claudia's name shouldn't be a problem.",
        "Nash: Good. Then I don't need to be here.",
        "Bruce: No, you need to stay clear of Tess.",
        "Nash: I can't stay clear of Tess and the baby, not completely, not the way things are going right now.",
        "Bruce: All right, what about if Tess finds out about our little plan?",
        "Nash: And what do you mean by that?",
        "Bruce: Oh, come on, even if it all goes smoothly -- if you destroy Reston financially, you remove the threat against Tess and your kid -- how is Tess going to deal with the fact that you had to use Claudia to do it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: So what should I say? I hear the cannons fire in the distance is there a place for the tide to change my heart? Stop wasting time collecting lines oh, girl wake up out of it yeah out of your island of loneliness",
        "Rex: Right. Thanks. Messages came from a disposable, prepaid phone, just like the other ones.",
        "Adriana: Can we track where the phone was sold?",
        "Rex: Even if we could, chances are we wouldn't find out who bought it. You can get those phones without a credit check.",
        "Adriana: So there's no way of catching the person that's doing this?",
        "Rex: No, we will find this creep, Adriana. In the meantime, I want you to change your phone number, and only give it out to the people closest to you.",
        "Adriana: I hate having to disrupt my life because of some crazy person.",
        "Rex: Look, now that I'm a certified P.I., I have access to a whole other network of information. I'm not going to stop digging till I get to the bottom of this, I promise.",
        "Adriana: It's just so creepy -- even a sweet, innocuous word like \"butterfly.\"",
        "Rex: I am so sorry you're going through this.",
        "Adriana: It's ok. It brought us back together. Made me realize how much you mean to me.",
        "Claudia: Someone out there has a romantic streak. They asked me to dedicate this next song to \"my butterfly.\" If you try to catch a butterfly by the wings the innocence is broken and the beauty vanishes if you try to catch a beautiful thing you find they can't breathe when they need room to grow butterfly",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Faked your death? Ms. Cochran, frankly, I have no interest in you whatsoever -- alive or dead.",
        "Bo: Smooth.",
        "Margaret: You used me to frame Todd Manning.",
        "Spencer: Really? Is that really what you think?",
        "Margaret: It's not what I think, it's what I know.",
        "Spencer: So when did we meet? When did we make this plan?",
        "Bo: He's on to her.",
        "Margaret: I don't have it all clear in here, but the police told me --",
        "Spencer: Ah, the police.",
        "Bo: That's it, she blew it.",
        "Spencer: What police?",
        "Margaret: Never mind. I don't have it all here in my head yet, but --",
        "Spencer: Obviously.",
        "Bo: Get her out of there.",
        "Blair: Wait, wait, wait, Bo. No, I could -- I could get to him if you just let me near him. Come on.",
        "Bo: The further you stay away from him, the better off you'll be.",
        "Blair: But, Bo -- wait a minute.",
        "Officer: Time to go, Ms. Cochran.",
        "Margaret: I shouldn't have said that about the police, huh? I'm sorry.",
        "Bo: No, no, no, it's ok, Margaret. It's ok.",
        "Margaret: Who are they?",
        "Bo: These gentlemen are going to take you to a hospital.",
        "Margaret: What kind of hospital?",
        "Bo: It's a psychiatric facility, but you'll be able to meet with the lawyer that your sister's hired for you. And you're going to get the best of care, Margaret.",
        "Spencer: Uh -- a word of advice, Commissioner. You can't fabricate truth where none exists.",
        "Margaret: I did what you said. But I thought he was going to tell me something about my baby, but he kept insisting that he didn't know who I was.",
        "Bo: I know. I heard the whole thing.",
        "Margaret: Please, just -- you can't send me to a mental institution. I mean, I'm not crazy. It's just that I don't remember anything.",
        "Bo: I know, Margaret, and with treatment, I hope that you will be able to remember -- and not just what we've told you, but I hope that you have some -- some great, new memories of your own, ok?",
        "Margaret: Yeah, that would be lovely.",
        "Bo: Yeah. It would. You know, Spencer Truman is a very smart guy, and if he is involved with this, he knows that we're close and he knows we're watching.",
        "Margaret: The princess disappeared into a swirling pool of water, even though the prince tried to save her. Hmm. But the prince couldn't find the princess because she had already been rescued by her fairy godfather. I did everything that you told me, Dr. Truman. I got Todd to take me out into the middle of the lake, I made him believe that I couldn't swim, but he didn't do what you told me he would.",
        "Bo: Margaret? What is it? This is the way love is",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: Butterfly passing by butterfly",
        "Rex: Who requested that song?",
        "Claudia: Oh, I don't know. The note wasn't signed.",
        "Rex: The guy that gave you the note -- what did he look like?",
        "Claudia: I didn't see him. It was clipped to my music. He must've left it there when I was getting ready. Is there a problem?",
        "Rex: Not sure yet.",
        "Claudia: Well, I'm sorry I can't help.",
        "Rex: Well, don't worry about it. You sang great.",
        "Claudia: Thanks.",
        "Layla: Um -- everything ok?",
        "Rex: I need to see the reservation book.",
        "Layla: It's over there. Why? What's going on?",
        "Adriana: Uh -- someone is trying to play a trick on me and we're just trying to figure out who it is.",
        "Rex: Can I make a copy of this page?",
        "Layla: I guess so. There's a copier in Antonio's office.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Adriana: Thanks.",
        "Bartender: What can I get you?",
        "Blair: I'll take a chardonnay.",
        "Bartender: You got it.",
        "Blair: I am sorry, Bo, but this is the only way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You're on the hook for murder, Vickers. You're not just going to walk.",
        "David: Bo offered me a deal.",
        "John: Yeah. And although, personally, I'd like to see you fry, the D.A. gave you his word that if you turn over evidence against your brother, and you plead guilty to shooting my father, he'll shave some years off your sentence.",
        "David: \"Some years\"? What does \"some years\" mean? Three? Five? What about time off for my good behavior?",
        "John: Do you have any concrete proof that your brother faked Margaret's death to set up Manning?",
        "David: Define \"concrete.\"",
        "John: That's it, I'm out of here.",
        "David: Wait a second.",
        "John: For what, huh? So you can mull over your options? Look, either you hang or your brother hangs -- or better yet, you both hang. For me, that's a win- win situation.",
        "David: Think about it, Mc Bain.",
        "Guard: You're a popular guy.",
        "David: You make minimum wage. Oh, what do you want, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: I thought I'd better stop by, check up on you again. Make sure they're aware of your special needs, you know? Listen, I wanted to talk to you about some recent developments.",
        "David: I'm not very good at inferring things, Spencer. What developments?",
        "Spencer: Margaret Cochran stopped by my office with a police escort. You wouldn't know anything about that, now, would you?",
        "David: I'm ready to give you up, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: You don't have anything on me, David.",
        "David: Then I might have to revert to plan B. I'll go straight to Blair and tell her everything that I know.",
        "Spencer: And what would that accomplish? You'd still be in jail.",
        "David: But I'd get to watch you lose for a change. Blair's all you care about. You are obsessed with her.",
        "Spencer: It's all about spite with you, isn't it, Dave?",
        "David: If my life's going to be ruined, your life's going to be ruined, too.",
        "Spencer: You know, why is it a foregone conclusion with you that your life is going to be ruined? I mean, I can help you get out of here -- I'm probably the only person in the world who can. I could talk to your lawyer.",
        "David: Don't use very big words.",
        "Spencer: Ok. Guard? Have I ever let you down before, David? Trust me, I'll take care of you.",
        "David: Not if I take care of you first. I need to make a phone call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Can you give us just a moment, please? Thank you. What happened back there, Margaret? Did you remember something?",
        "Margaret: Oh, I don't know. Nothing that made any sense.",
        "Bo: Try me.",
        "Margaret: Whatever it was, it's already gone. It went right out of my head.",
        "Bo: All right, if anything does come back to you, I want you to have your doctor call me, please.",
        "Margaret: Ok.",
        "Bo: Gentlemen, you can take Ms. Cochran to the van.",
        "Margaret: I'm -- I'm sorry that you didn't get what you wanted.",
        "Bo: Well, it wasn't for lack of trying. You were very brave in there, Margaret. I want to thank you.",
        "John: What happened?",
        "Bo: Well, Truman wouldn't give anything up. Margaret's even more agitated. She can't remember a thing.",
        "John: That's not surprising.",
        "Bo: How'd it go with Vickers?",
        "John: That guy's scared. You know, I think he wants to roll over on his brother. The trouble is --",
        "Bo: What?",
        "John: I don't know, I don't think he can give us anything to help us put him away.",
        "Bo: Oh, I just -- I wish Paige could come around, you know? She has something on Spencer she wanted to tell us and it might be just what we need.",
        "Hugh: The hospital lab is sending over a copy of the autopsy reports.",
        "Bo: The ones missing from Manning's case file?",
        "Hugh: Yeah. If we can prove that Truman signed those forms identifying those bodies as Margaret and her baby, we've got him.",
        "Margaret: How did this happen to me? I don't understand. I'm being sent to a mental institution. I mean, everybody's been telling me that I have this baby that I can't remember, and I did all these horrible, terrible things. Am I really that horrible of a person? Oh. You are going to look just like him. Oh, you have got a lot of fight in you today, Toddy -- just like your daddy. Oh, no. It's not supposed to feel this way. Ah! Oh, my God. I remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I'm never going to leave town",
        "Bruce: If you say so.",
        "Nash: You let me take care of it. Alright you just hold up your end of the deal -- convince Reston that you got some problems with how he's investing his money.",
        "Bruce: Reston's no easy mark, Nash. And from what I've seen, neither is his daughter. This could all blow up in your face. People could end up hurt -- or worse.",
        "Nash: Oh, people are going to end up hurt. I'll do anything to have Tess and my baby back -- even sell my soul to the devil.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: It's the right thing to do, jess -- for us and the by. Jessica:. I want a child together just as much as you do, and we will. Because it doesn't matter who I was when this baby was conceived. She's a part of me and nobody can deny that. But when I marry you, I want to be able to give you my whole heart, everything, and I can't do that right now.",
        "Antonio: Honey, but that's just it. Look, if we're married, if we're a family in the eyes of a judge, then Tess can't come between us anymore.",
        "Jessica: It's not about names on pieces of paper. Yes, I am strong right now and, yeah, it looks like Tess is gone, but there's no guarantee that she's not going to come back. Not until I'm fully integrated, and that's going to take a lot of work. Do you understand?",

        "Adriana: It's not going to do any good, Rex. You heard Layla -- most of the people in here didn't have reservations.",
        "Rex: Which is also why I'm going to put a tap on your phone, set up a surveillance camera. I will do whatever it takes to stop this guy.",

        "Adriana: Leave Llanview? Totally disrupt my life and not see the people that I care about, just to get away from some cowardly jerk who goes around trying to scare people?

        "Blair: She have anything to say?",
