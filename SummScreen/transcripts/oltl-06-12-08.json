The mysterious \"princess of Mendora\" appears in Llanview and reveals herself as Viki and Todd's sister, Tina. She collects the stolen jewels from Ramsey and pays him. She also reveals she has a dog named David Vickers. Shortly after Ramsey and Tina have their \"transaction\", two guys enter Ramsey's house and shoot him. John is listening to what is going on at Ramsey's home with a surveillance device. He rushes into Ramsey's house. Todd and his bodyguard also enter.",
        "Starr and Cole are in the park with the infant Sam, when they run into Marcie. Starr panics when she sees that she cannot respond to Sam when he cries the way Marcie can. She concludes that she is not ready to be a mom. And when she finds out that Marcie cannot have kids nor adopt, she declares that there is something terribly wrong and she must \"do something\" about it. Rex and Gigi run into each other at the hospital. They uncover the secrets and schemes on the parts of both Adriana and Brody and are both furious at their respective \"partners\". And it looks like their opportunities exist to continue their relationship."

        "Rex: Something wrong? You, Shane?",
        "Gigi: No, we're fine. What about you?",
        "Rex: Me? Uh -- here on business.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. Me, too.",
        "Rex: Right, so, I'll catch you later.",
        "Gigi: Hey. You've got a tell Balsom.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: Something in your eyes, like it's five minutes before gym class and you know they're going to be climbing ropes. Rex, really, you look like --",
        "Rex: Like -- like my dad isn't my dad, like my marriage is a disaster? Like my whole life seems like a con?",
        "Gigi: Like you need a friend.",

        "Keys: Stick of gum?",
        "Todd: What flavor is it?",
        "Keys: Wintergreen.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Keys: Suit yourself. Simplify, man. That's my advice. Life gets too complicated, take inventory. Decide what's important, what you need, what you can live without. And what you can live without, get rid of. Know what I mean?",
        "Todd: Hey, hold on, hold it. Stop the car.",
        "Keys: What happened?",
        "Todd: Stop the car. That's my daughter over there with that idiot boyfriend of hers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Calm down. All right, calm down.",
        "[Sam cries]",
        "Starr: Look, it's okay, it's okay.",
        "Shaun: What got into him?",
        "Starr: I don't exactly know, because he can't talk to me, now, can he?",
        "Shaun: Coochie, coochie, coochie.",
        "Starr: Just chill out, please. Chill out. Marcie, can you help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Don't go.",
        "Ramsey: How you feeling?",
        "Woman: My head.",
        "Ramsey: Yeah? Well, take one of these. It always makes you feel better.",
        "Woman: Hmm.",
        "Ramsey: Here you go. I got some good news.",
        "Woman: Hmm. The jewels you showed me?",
        "Ramsey: Yeah. Yes. It's happening today. We'll finally have what we need to make you better and make sure nobody ever threatens or hurts us again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, thank you, Mr. Ambassador.",
        "Jonas: Yes.",
        "Tina: Did David Vickers do his business?",
        "Jonas: And then some.",
        "Tina: Aw. Sweetheart, did that mean, old airplane upset your tummy?",
        "[Jonas chuckles]",
        "Tina: Poor baby.",
        "Jonas: Your trip was comfortable, I trust.",
        "Tina: No. First class is not what it used to be.",
        "Jonas: Yes, well, it's a shame that you had to make the trip in the first place.",
        "Tina: Oh, well. A princess has to do what a princess has to do.",
        "Jonas: Yes, but, had it not been for the spectacular incompetence of my government's security detail, her highness' jewels would never have been stolen in the first place. So, again, I apologize on behalf of the entire American government.",
        "Tina: Mr. Ambassador, we've already been through this. Only my subjects in Mendorra have to call me \"your highness.\" Now, you can call me \"Tina\" or, um, \"Princess Tina,\" if you prefer.",
        "Jonas: As you wish, Princess Tina. Should we now go to the police station to see about your jewels?",
        "Tina: Are you kidding? The police are the ones that lost the jewels in the first place. No, no, no. There's only one man who can restore my country's heritage, and believe me, he is not one of the good guys.",
        "Tina: Look, David Vickers, there's Llanfair. Wave to the nice people!",
        "[Tina giggles]",
        "Tina: Good job.",
        "Jonas: Familiar with this city, Princess?",
        "Tina: Are you surprised?",
        "Jonas: I just never thought a member of royalty would know or care about such an ordinary American town.",
        "Tina: Oh. Oh, Jonas, there is nothing ordinary about this town, or that house.",
        "Jonas: You've been inside?",
        "Tina: I practically grew up there.",
        "Jonas: Oh, didn't know. If I may ask, Princess -- never mind.",
        "Tina: No. No, go right ahead. You want to know how a nice, small-town girl like me ended up as the crown princess of Mendorra.",
        "Jonas: Well, yes.",
        "Tina: Well, it was a long, long journey.",
        "Jonas: I see.",
        "Tina: And I am so happy to be home.",

        "Todd: What the hell are they doing? Why aren't they running away?",
        "Keys: Maybe Marcie was there first, you know, jogging or whatever.",
        "Todd: Yeah, right, Marcie exercise. Look at Shaun. He's not doing anything. Shaun! Shaun, do something!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Sam cries]",
        "Starr: Okay, move out of my way. Sam, look, I have your favorite toy. Just please -- look, buddy.",
        "Cole: Try his crazy monkey, I don't know. Hey, buddy.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, obviously, nothing that you're doing is helping, so, Marcie, please can you just help us out?",
        "Marcie: I would really like to help you, but I -- I have to get to an appointment. I'm sorry. You know, maybe you can just, um, see if you can get his attention somehow, and try to get him to listen to you.",
        "Starr: Sure. Okay, I'll try. Hey, Sam, look, I'm trying to talk to you, but all I hear is crying, so it's obviously not working. Marcie, please. Please -- could you please help us?",
        "Marcie: First, you just need to calm down.",
        "Starr: Okay. Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Okay? Because your being upset is what's keeping him upset.",
        "Starr: Of course I'm going to be upset. He's screaming his head off. What else am I supposed to do? I already tried to give him food, and he kept turning his head away, and then he's been showing him all of these toys and he's not responding.",
        "Marcie: Okay, okay, okay. Just calm down. Just calm down.",
        "Starr: So you're going to help us?",
        "Marcie: Yes. Hi. Hi, honey.",
        "[Sam quiets]",
        "Starr: Okay, of course he's calmed down when you talk to him.",
        "Marcie: Yes, there you go. That's it.",
        "Starr: Could you just please help us calm him down some more?",
        "Marcie: Okay. Come here. Come here. Yeah. There we go. Oh. There we go. What's the matter? What was the matter? Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I can't believe it. They just handed my kid over to that --",
        "Keys: You get out of this car, I call the cops myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Careful, please.",
        "Ramsey: Oh, come on, now. Everything's under control.",
        "Woman: But what if things don't go the way you planned?",
        "Ramsey: Now, didn't I save you, bring you home? Protect you? Make sure you get the best treatment? Have I ever let you down?",
        "Woman: No. Not once.",
        "Ramsey: I never will, either. You're too important to me.",

        "Rex: Look, Gigi, I just had a bad scene with Charlie --",
        "Gigi: No arguments, Balsom.",
        "Rex: I need to get out of here.",
        "Gigi: You are not walking away from me, not when you're like this. You don't have to talk if you don't want to. We can tell knock-knock jokes. Or we can put ourselves on \"mute,\" but you're not going anywhere.",
        "Rex: When I went to that board meeting, I thought that I had a dad and a shot at a good marriage. A couple of hours later -- all gone.",
        "Gigi: I saw Adriana today.",
        "Rex: You did?",
        "Gigi: I dropped by Marcie's and she was there.",
        "Rex: Doing what?",
        "Gigi: Saying goodbye, I guess. After she left, Marcie told me that the two of you are separating.",
        "Rex: I showed her that note someone passed me at the board meeting. I asked her if it was -- true. Was my wife lying to me? We got into it. There was no slapping or hair-pulling. It was all very civilized.",
        "Gigi: Huh. I'm impressed.",
        "Rex: How did Adriana seem?",
        "Gigi: Like she was working real hard to keep it together. Like leaving you was the last thing she wanted to do.",
        "Rex: I asked her for a divorce. If either one of us had said the wrong thing right then, that would have been it.",
        "Gigi: But?",
        "Rex: We got ourselves together enough, decided that, you know, we need space, figure out what's next.",
        "Gigi: Sounds reasonable.",
        "Rex: Now she's gone. No wife, no dad.",
        "Gigi: I'm so sorry, Rex.",
        "Rex: Yeah. So am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: How you feeling?",
        "Woman: Better. I'm just so tired.",
        "Ramsey: Now, that's the medication. You need to rest.",
        "Woman: What's going to happen when today is all over?",
        "Ramsey: Well, I -- I'm still going to take care of you, make sure you get the -- the best treatment possible, and when you're healthy and strong enough, I'll take you back to all the people who love you. You'll go back to your life, and I'll go back to mine. Maybe the F.B.I. will finally reinstate me. Everybody will win.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "TV announcer's voice: The real question is, when you turn your car on, does it start immediately?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Woman: Hello?",
        "John: Uh, hi. My name's John. I'm a -- I'm a rep for your satellite provider. Some customers in your area are experiencing dish interference, and we're going to have to recalibrate the signal.",
        "Woman: Well, my TV's fine.",
        "John: Well, ma'am, we'll still need to do some adjustments, so if you could just turn your equipment off for a few minutes.",
        "Woman: Hold on a second. How is everything?",
        "Ramsey's voice: I was just on the phone with the clinic.",
        "Woman's voice: Should I call the doctor?",
        "Ramsey's voice: No. Who were you on the phone with?",
        "Woman: Oh, it -- just the satellite company.",
        "Ramsey: All right, get rid of him please.",
        "Woman: I'll -- I'll turn off my set, thank you.",
        "Ramsey's voice: You should take the rest of the day off.",
        "Woman: Are you sure?",
        "Ramsey: Yeah, I'm positive. I've got a meeting scheduled.",
        "Woman: You never do police business here.",
        "Ramsey: Nah, just the same --",
        "Woman: Well, I'll stay out of your way. And you may need me, in case she has another episode.",
        "Ramsey: No, I just medicated her. I don't think she'll wake up, but if she does, I have just the thing to make it all better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Well, now that you fed yourself, how about you build a sandcastle for your sister? I'd bet she'd like that.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I would.",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Well, here you go. Go on. Have fun.",
        "Starr: Oh, okay.",
        "Marcie: There you go.",
        "Shaun: Hey, Sam, we're going to go build a castle together.",

        "Todd: Let go of me.",
        "Keys: I'm sorry. Can't do that.",
        "Todd: That woman is a baby thief.",
        "Keys: It's exactly what I was talking about before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I can't believe that that's all it was. He just wanted to feed himself, and I couldn't figure that out?",
        "Marcie: I was just like you when I first got him. I would go through every trick in my bag until I found the right one that worked. You know, was he hungry? Was he thirsty? Did his diaper need changing? Did his tummy hurt?",
        "Starr: You are so patient. I don't think I could ever be that patient.",
        "Marcie: What, are you kidding? Do you think I had patience at your age? No way. I remember, I used to baby-sit this little girl down the block, and I would pray that when I got there, she was sleeping, because if she wasn't, I was just at a total loss.",
        "Starr: Oh, just like I was today.",
        "Marcie: Every mom has a scary moment, you know? Especially a new one. I remember thinking, what did I do, how am I every going to handle this responsibility, but --",
        "Starr: Right.",
        "Marcie: Well, baby -- they -- you start getting to know them as a person and not a responsibility, and you have this precious little kid, and they depend on you like nobody has every depended on you. And it just -- it stops being, \"oh, my God, I'm so nervous! I'm going to ruin this little, precious being,\" till, you know, \"I know this kid. And I know him better than anybody else, because I love him so much, and the only way I can ruin it is if I let him go. I'm not there for him.\" I'm sorry. Uh -- I -- I have to go. Just -- just have fun with him, okay? It's amazing, though, isn't it? Even after everything he's been through, he still has this incredibly sweet demeanor. I \u0096 I guess he was just born with it. Like sister, like brother, huh? Hmm. I just -- I pray that nothing happens to -- to ruin it. I'll see you guys later.",
        "Starr: What, like I almost did?",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Starr: When I told you that my dad was hurting him.",
        "Marcie: Starr, you were going through a really rough time.",
        "Starr: That's no excuse. There's no excuse. I used you, and I used Sam. If anybody was hurting Sam, it was me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Please let me help.",
        "Keys: I let you out, and what happens next? The cops take you away for violating your restraining order.",
        "Todd: She's going to steal that kid, I know it.",
        "Keys: Look again.",
        "Todd: Yeah, so?",
        "Keys: The kid's playing, and the bodyguard's there. Nobody's trying to steal anybody.",
        "Todd: All right. I just don't want her hanging around my kids.",
        "Keys: You told that lady that if you lost custody of Sam, I'm going to kill her and her husband.",
        "Todd: Yes, I know what I told you.",
        "Keys: So, I don't want you to lose custody, because I don't want to kill anybody. You still want your kids back, right?",
        "Todd: What do you think?",
        "Keys: Are you ready to raise them from the inside of a cell?",
        "Todd: I got you. You don't have to lecture me. I'm not going anywhere, am I?",
        "Keys: That's right, you're not.",
        "Todd: You know, I hired you for that, you know, muscle of yours, not your conscience.",
        "Todd: What the hell?",
        "Keys: What?",
        "Todd: That redhead in the back of that limousine. That's my sister.",
        "Keys: Viki Buchanan? She's blond.",
        "Todd: No, not Viki Buchanan. My other sister, Tina.",
        "Keys: I couldn't see the passenger.",
        "Todd: No. No, it couldn't have been her. I mean, wasn't she basically run out of town a few years back?",
        "Keys: Don't you keep tabs on your own sister?",
        "Todd: Hell, no, not her. That's asking for trouble. Hey, follow that limousine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You know, I lied about my dad hitting Sam, but I didn't think for one second what it would do to you or -- or to Sam.",
        "Cole: Starr, you've got to stop beating yourself up.",
        "Starr: Okay, Cole, stop! I want to talk about this, please. I mean, look, part of the reason why I decided to do that, to tell you that, was because I didn't think that my dad deserved to raise Sam. And maybe -- maybe I'm right. I don't know. What -- what do you think? Do you think my dad deserves to have Sam?",
        "Marcie: I think that Sam's happy, and he's healthy, and that your family -- you're doing a great job to give him a lot of love, is what I think.",
        "Starr: You're not answering my question.",
        "Marcie: Starr, it doesn't matter what I think, okay?",
        "Starr: It does to me.",
        "Marcie: Sam isn't Tommy. Tommy is gone.",
        "Starr: For one second you thought that you were going to get him back, right? I mean, Marcie, when that judge told my dad that Sam couldn't be with him, I mean, didn't you think that you were going to get Sam back?",
        "Marcie: I wanted him back more than anything, but I do think that the judge made the right decision.",

        "Gigi: Paris, huh?",
        "Rex: Adriana and I had to put a whole ocean between us, it was that bad.",
        "Gigi: She'll be back soon, I bet. Especially with all that rich food they have in Paris. I mean, God forbid the woman should go from a size zero to a size two. I mean, life just wouldn't be worth living, right? Too soon for jokes? Hmm?",
        "Rex: Jokes are always okay.",
        "Gigi: All I'm saying is, there's no way Adriana is giving up on you. And you haven't given up, either. Not really. A little time away from each other, and you're both going to realize that whatever it is that's keeping you apart just isn't that big a deal.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I might see it that way if the problem was just between the two of us.",
        "Gigi: What do you mean? Who else is involved?",
        "Rex: You and Shane.",
        "Gigi: What are you talking about? What -- what do Shane and I have to do with this?",
        "Rex: I thought you said Adriana told you what happened.",
        "Gigi: I said I saw her. I didn't say I talked to her. What is it? Rex, tell me.",
        "Rex: It's about Brody.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Rex: Well, he only came to Llanview because Adriana brought him here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonas: Princess, would it not be more prudent to address your grievance through official channels?",
        "Tina: Just keep the limo warm, okay? You ready, honey?",
        "Jonas: I really don't think it's good for you to go inside alone.",
        "Tina: I'm not going to be alone. David Vickers is with me.",
        "Jonas: Princess, your dog will not be a lot of assistance if tensions were to escalate.",
        "Tina: Look, this is for the crown, and only for the crown. It is my royal duty to defend the honor of Mendorra. And by God, that is exactly what I am going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: That used to be my building.",
        "Todd: Yeah, she's going in. The limo's pulling around back. What the hell?",
        "Keys: Damned if I know.",
        "Todd: I think she could be coming to see me. For all she knows, I still live there.",
        "Keys: Well, wouldn't she call first?",
        "Todd: Hell, no, not if she's in trouble. Not if she needs something, that's for sure. Wait until she knocks and Ramsey answers.",
        "Keys: The police commissioner?",
        "Todd: Yeah -- /blackmailer, /kid killer. Well, I guess she could be seeing him.",
        "Keys: Why would your sister want anything to do with a guy like that?",
        "Todd: I have no idea. Let's find out, shall we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ramsey: Ah. Your highness. Welcome to America. Does that thing shed?",
        "Tina: Hmm. That is the last time you will ever refer to David Vickers as a \"thing.\" And, no, he does not shed, but if he did, you'd just have to live with it, wouldn't you?",
        "Tina: So cut the crap. Where are the jewels?",
        "Tina: Ah. Oh --",
        "Ramsey: Not so fast, your highness. Show me the money.",
        "Tina: Well.",
        "Tina: My country thanks you, Mr. Ramsey, in euros. Impressive resume.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Brody, he said he found us all by himself.",
        "Rex: Okay, all I know is what Adriana told me.",
        "Gigi: Which is what exactly?",
        "Rex: That her and her mom found out that Brody's family had lied to you about him being killed in action. So, she tracked down, told him he had a kid, paid him off so he'd show up here.",
        "Gigi: She paid him.",
        "Rex: Yeah, maybe you should talk to Brody about this, and I --",
        "Gigi: Maybe I should kick his ass. I'm going to strangle him.",
        "Rex: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Gigi: Oh -- how could he do this to me?",
        "Rex: I wondered that, too, but I know why Adriana wanted him here.",
        "Gigi: Yeah?",
        "Rex: She wanted Brody to keep you busy because she was jealous of you and me.",
        "Gigi: Why would she be? I made a fool of myself in front of a whole church full of people, and you still married her. I can't believe this.",
        "Rex: Gigi, I think --",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God, so -- uh! -- This whole time Brody's been scamming me? Pretending to want to be a father to Shane when -- when all he wanted was money?",
        "Rex: I'm sorry.",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "Gigi: Maybe there's something I can do to soften the blow.",
        "Rex: What are you talking about?",
        "Gigi: How much did Adriana pay that lousy son of a -- how much did she pay Brody?",
        "Rex: No idea.",
        "Gigi: Find out.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Gigi: Why? I'll tell you why. Because, since Shane was old enough to salute, he has idolized Brody, all because I, the idiot that I am, talked him up like the hero I thought he was.",
        "Rex: You're no idiot, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: And now, after all these years, he shows up out of the blue, acting like he wants to be a real father to my kid and I find out he was drawing a salary for it.",
        "Rex: Sleazy.",
        "Gigi: Sleazy? It's more than sleazy. It's more than sleazy. Oh, my God, uh -- if Brody walks out on us now, it will destroy Shane.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I get it.",
        "Gigi: So I need to know how much Adriana paid him so I can find a way to match it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I have a lot of, like, great memories, you know? And Sam taught me so much about life and about myself. I feel lucky to have ever been his mom.",
        "Starr: You'll be a mom again someday, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: No, probably not.",
        "Starr: No, there's got to be a way.",
        "Marcie: No, I can't have kids of my own and, after everything I did to keep Sam, no adoption agency is ever going to let me have another kid, and, you know, I should've thought about that, I should've, before I ran away with him, but I didn't.",
        "Starr: There are so many kids out there with no parents or really crappy parents and --",
        "Marcie: I know. I know.",
        "Starr: You want a kid so much and you can't have one?",
        "Cole: Starr, maybe you should just let this go?",
        "Starr: No, I don't -- you know, it's just another thing that my dad screwed up, isn't it?",
        "Marcie: Life happens, Starr. It just does and I'm trying my best to get over it -- or not.",
        "Starr: Marcie, it's not fair. It's not fair at all because I know you. You were a great mother. When I would baby-sit Sam, I could see how you and Dr. McBain treated him. You were the best parents in the entire world and you're an amazing teacher, and you just get kids the way I don't.",
        "Marcie: Starr, I know you. And you are going to make a great mom. Someday.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Hmm. You know, these are the crown jewels of a country. Don't you think you could've at least kept them clean?",
        "Ramsey: Dog walker and gemologist. Anything you don't do?",
        "Tina's voice: Crooked and smug. Is there any bad personality trait that you don't have? And what's this with all the counting? What, you think I'd really stiff you?",
        "Ramsey's voice: Your highness, your reputation precedes you.",
        "[Dog whines]",
        "Tina: Oh, sweetie, are you thirsty? Oh, we need to get you some water. Uh, where's the washroom?",
        "Ramsey: That way.",
        "Tina: Thank you. Come here, sweetheart.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Ramsey: Who is it?",
        "Man: It's your doorman, Francisco. I have a package for you.",
        "Ramsey: Right there, Francisco.",
        "[Gunshots]",
        "Thug: Is he done?",
        "Thug: Is he done?",
        "[Gunshots]",
        "Second thug: He is now.",
        "First thug: Start looking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: [Whispering] Oh. David Vickers, shh, shh, shh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You're going to pay Brody off?",
        "Gigi: What choice do I have, now that the gravy train's gone off to Paris?",
        "Rex: Brody's not going to make you do that.",
        "Gigi: Really? And you're so sure because --",
        "Rex: Okay, one, only a total jerk would make you fork it over to keep him hanging around his own kid.",
        "Gigi: He was a big enough jerk to take money to make a little boy's dreams come true.",
        "Rex: I haven' t gotten to two yet.",
        "Gigi: And two is --",
        "Rex: He's not going to ask you for the money because that would mean telling you what he did.",
        "Gigi: Look, Brody has no conscience, so why would he have a problem telling me what a total bastard he's been?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Maybe he's changed since he came here, seeing you and Shane again.",
        "Gigi: I don't know. It's just Shane I feel bad for.",
        "Rex: All right, well, maybe you don't have to.",
        "Gigi: You know what this proves, don't you? That we're both a couple of suckers, falling for people who turned out not to be who we thought they were, to put it mildly.",
        "Rex: Peas in a pod.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Rex: And us peas have to stick together. And if Brody wants money to stick around and you want him to for Shane's sake, I'll help you come up with it.",
        "Gigi: That's crazy. It's not your problem, Rex.",
        "Rex: Adriana did this to your life. That makes it my problem.",
        "Gigi: Rex --",
        "Rex: And even if she hadn't, I'd still want to help. Shane is a great kid. He deserves better. And if we can do something to keep his hero dad around, then whatever we have to do is worth it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr, come on, don't be so hard on yourself.",
        "Starr: Cole, I'm being honest. I'm going to be the mother from hell.",
        "Cole: Okay, because you couldn't fix one problem with Sam?",
        "Starr: You saw the way I was with him, okay? All he wanted to do was feed himself and I was getting ready to slap him because he wouldn't stop crying.",
        "Marcie: Honey, you're 16! Patience is something you develop over time.",
        "Starr: Well, I don't have time, because I have a little brother that I need to take care of right now.",
        "Marcie: Okay, taking care of your little brother and parenting are two totally different things. You are not Sam's mother and you are not responsible for him 24/7, nor should you be. You're still figuring out who you are and how to live your life. You shouldn't burden yourself with somebody else's life. And anyway, come on, it's going to be a really long time before you have to deal with that. And trust me, by that time, it will feel a lot differently. Okay?",
        "[Sam vocalizes]",
        "Marcie: I -- I'm due at the hospital, so I'll see you guys soon, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Shaun: We had a good time, didn't we, Sam? We had a good time.",
        "Marcie: Hi. Listen, even when you and I aren't together, I'm always thinking about you, okay? All right. I'll see you guys soon. Bye.",
        "Shaun: You're sweet.",
        "Cole: Starr, she's wrong. Okay, we are ready for this now. Okay? We can do this. We're going to do great. All right, you, me, and our baby are going to be just fine, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, I got to go. Yeah, I got to go! All right, see you. Yeah, she doesn't have a clue where she is.",
        "Keys: She's been in there a long time.",
        "Todd: Yeah. If she came to see me, she would've discovered I wasn't there, come out a long time ago. Must be Ramsey she's seeing.",
        "Keys: So, what do we do now?",
        "Todd: Why don't we pay a visit to Ramsey himself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Thug: Get a load of this.",
        "[Thug whistles]",
        "Second thug: Put it away. We'll take it with us when we find what we came for.",
        "First thug: I'll check upstairs. You keep searching.",
        "John: Freeze, police!",
        "John: Don't do it!",

        "Tina: God help us. It's not our time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So, um, how are you feeling, better?",
        "Rex: Helps to unload, right?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, definitely.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: And now, you can go see Charlie.",
        "Gigi: Figured it out, huh?",
        "Rex: Wasn't tough.",
        "Gigi: Do you mind?",
        "Rex: Why would I mind? Just because he's not my dad doesn't mean he can't be your friend.",
        "Gigi: Right.",
        "Rex: And just because Brody's in the picture, doesn't mean that I can't be your friend, either.",
        "Gigi: I know. See you, Balsom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Maybe we should -- we should go.",
        "Starr: Yeah. You're probably right, we should get going.",
        "Cole: You know, the little guy's going to be an uncle soon.",
        "Starr: I hadn't thought of that one.",
        "Cole: Yeah. So, speaking of -- hey. Hey, did you have fun?",
        "Shaun: We had a lot of fun.",
        "Cole: Did you? You ready to go?",
        "Shaun: No, you don't want to go, right?",
        "Cole: Who's that? Who's that? Come on, you want a shoulder ride? It's always fun.",
        "Shaun: Come on.",
        "Cole: Dude, here we go. Here we go.",
        "Starr: Uh-oh.",
        "Cole: You see? Okay, here we go. All right. Whoo-hoo-hoo.",

        "Tina: Here, take this.",
        "Jonas: Oh, of course. Princess, what the hell?",
        "Tina: Just drive! Come on!",
