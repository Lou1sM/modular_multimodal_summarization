He follows it to Ramsey's house where Tina pays Ramsey out of a suitcase for the jewels that he has. She is known as the Princess of Mendora but we don't know why. Her agent pulls a gun on her so she hands over the goods. She escapes. And she just happens to \"stumble\" upon her daughter, Sara who does not see her while in the park with Cristian. Two thugs come to Ramsey's house and shoot him with the intent to steal the money and the jewels. But John shoots the thugs before they have a chance and Tina walks away with the money. John enters Ramsey's house. So do Todd and his bodyguard. Todd discovers that Ramsey has been been hiding Marty Saybrooke. She is alive but ill and has lost her memory. Todd and his bodyguard have a plan to prevent John from knowing she is there. Meanwhile, Starr decides that she wants to have her baby but give it up for adoption."

        "[Sarah sighs]",
        "Sarah: I don't know. I mean, I feel like I have to -- to write something with meaning, something that makes an impression. I mean -- nash and I were friends, but there was so much I didn't know about him.",

        "Starr: No, thank you.",
        "Cole: He what's wrong?",
        "Starr: Nothing. It's just the morning sickness again. It's such a joke. You know what they should call it? They should call it queasiness 24/7 with random outbreaks of bitchiness syndrome.",
        "Langston: Ok, that's way too long.",
        "Markko: No, wait, how about q-rob 24/7?",

        "Starr: Oh, thank you. I know, I just think -- I think stress makes it worse, and after everything that happened in the park --",
        "Langston: What happened in the park? Sam had a meltdown or something?",
        "Starr: Yeah, he did. He was freaking out. We had no idea what to do. I lost i",

        "Cole: He just wanted to feed himself.",
        "Markko: That's it?",
        "Cole: Yeah, but we got it under control, and that's all that matters.",
        "Starr: No, marcie got it under control. We were totally useless.",
        "Cole: Starr --",
        "Langston: Whoa, whoa. Mrs. Mcbain was there?",
        "Starr: What? She wasn't stalking us or anything. I mean, she just actually happened to be walking by when sam freaked out and we needed help. We didn't know what to do, and, I mean, she was really great.",
        "Langston: Well, I guess she would. I mean, he used to be her kid.",
        "Markko: That must have been weird for her. Taking care of sam when he used to be her son.",
        "Starr: I know, but she was really great with him. Right, cole?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: I just feel really bad for her.",
        "Langston: Starr, you were totally in her face when your dad wanted custody.",
        "Starr: I know, but she can't have kids. I mean, she can't even adopt again because she kidnapped sam.",
        "Langston: And held your aunt viki hostage and did a lot of other crazy stuff.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but, I mean, she did all of that because she wanted to be a mother.",
        "Langston: I know, but I'm just saying --",
        "Starr: You're just saying what?",
        "Markko: You used to bite our heads off if we felt bad for her.",
        "Starr: Oh -- ok, you're right, but that was before I knew how far my dad would go in order to get what he wants. And it was before I found out that I was pregnant. I mean, really, like, what is my dad going to do when he finds out that I'm pregnant with your baby?",
        "Cole: Starr, I told you I can take care of myself.",
        "Starr: I'm sure that's what mrs. Mcbain said, and look what happened to her.",
        "Todd: Look, I'm just trying to help you here.",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Todd: I'm not touching you. See? Hands in the air. I'm not touching you.",

        "Marty: Do I know you? Ti: What are you doing?",
        "Jonas: What those idiots at the commissioner's penthouse failed to do.",
        "Tina: What? Kill me?",
        "Jonas: Let go of the case now.",
        "Tina: Fine, fine, fine. You can have it, all right?",
        "Jonas: Let go of it now!",
        "Tina: Fine. You can have it. Just leave us alone!",
        "[Tina shrieks]",
        "Jonas: Oh!",
        "Sarah: Man, it's terrible seeing somebody die.",
        "Cristian: Most powerless feeling in the world.",
        "Sarah: The only thing I can think to say to him -- \"you're a great guy, nash. I'm so lucky to know you.\" Like -- like it's a high school yearbook.",
        "Cristian: What else were you going to say?",
        "Sarah: I don't know. I mean, I had one chance, one chance to say something important, something that might bring the guy peace, and -- and I'm all, \"you're great. Everything's great. Everybody's great,\" you know? Except for the whole \"you dying\" part.",
        "Cristian: Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.",
        "Sarah: Works for me.",
        "Cristian: Listen, not a lot of people can suck it up and walk into a room with a dying guy, no matter how much he meant to them. So you didn't spout shakespeare when it was time to say goodbye. So what? You were there, you spoke from your heart, and that's -- that's all you can do.",
        "Sarah: Thanks.",
        "Cristian: Sure.",
        "Sarah: I guess, um, this song is a chance to, you know, say something else to him.",
        "Cristian: And just like you did on our first date, you're going to get it exactly right.",
        "Sarah: I guess I hope that somehow nash can hear me.",
        "Markko: How much longer can you guys keep this baby a secret from your dad?",
        "Cole: Actually we were talking about that today.",
        "Langston: So what's the plan? No plan?",
        "Cole: Well, not yet.",
        "Markko: Well, what are you waiting for?",
        "Langston: Markko --",
        "Starr: No, he's right. I mean, we do need to figure it out, but I just -- I can't deal with that right now.",
        "Cole: Ok, you don't have to.",
        "Markko: I'm -- I'm sorry. I totally put my foot in it. I guess I'm just nervous for you guys.",
        "Langston: You know we all love you, right?",
        "Starr: I know, but, I mean, I also know that you guys should be at the mall or at the park or something. Instead, you're inside talking about morning sickness and baby food and my father. I mean, we all sound like a bunch of 30-year-olds. Really. Oh, and, markko, I forgot to tell you -- cole turned down a game of hoops today with kent and garrett.",
        "Markko: What?",
        "Starr: Yeah, in order to hang t with me and sam.",
        "Cole: It's just a game.",
        "Markko: With kent and garrett? You got to represent.",
        "Cole: Represent? Ok, I did represent, with starr and sam, all right? And it didn't bother me. It didn't bother me, ok? I'm ready to be a good dad, no matter what your dad tries to do to me.",
        "Langston: All right, you know what? In a few days, we're all going to be having so much fun, it'll be like \"starr's dad -- who?\"",
        "Markko: Yeah, because you'll be screaming and begging for your lives.",
        "Todd: Do you not know who I am?",
        "Marty: I had an accident. My brain was injured. I have trouble remembering. I can't see before.",
        "Todd: Well, what do you remember?",
        "Marty: Lee. And the nurse.",
        "Todd: And that's it?",
        "Marty: Is lee ok? Are you a friend of his?",
        "Todd: You don't know who I am.",
        "Marty: Why should I? Am I a friend of yours?",

        "[Marty screams]",
        "[Woman screams]",
        "Keys: Sorry. Sorry about this, but whoever did this could still be close by. You tina? You live here? Do you work here? You know any of these people? I need you to stay quiet for me. Can you do that? Ok.",
        "Keys: He's dead. They all are.",

        "Todd: Marty's fine, marty's fine -- as fine as she c be. No, we didn't kill anybody. Nurse: I'm going to check for myself --",
        "Todd: No, no, no. Hold up, hold up. Nurse: Look, it -- she is my responsibility. I have been watching her for months. Please.",
        "Todd: Ok. I'm going to give you a couple of -- couple of choices here. I'm going to offer you some of this money to work for me, to do what I want. Your other option is that he's going to break your neck. Which would you prefer? Nurse: You'll have to kill me before I let you go to marty again.",
        "Ramsey: The picture. Remember this day? You always feel better when you look at the picture.",
        "[John yells, coughs]",
        "Todd: Wow. For a nurse, you really got big brass ones, you know? Nurse: Look, this isn't about playing for anybody's team. I'm a nurse. If marty is alive like you said, then prove it. Just let me go up there and help her.",
        "Keys: What's she on about? Who's this marty?",
        "Todd: Uh, it's this broad that ramsey's been stashing upstairs. Nurse: He took such good care of her, that poor man. She needs 24-hour medical care. We have been doing that together.",
        "Todd: So who besides you knows she's up there? Nurse: Just me, and -- just me.",
        "Keys: Is she hurt? Do we need to call an ambulance? Nurse: Yes.",

        "Sarah: I'm always hungry.",
        "Cristian: I was thinking of real food, to go along with nash's wine.",

        "Cristian: Uh, how about a hot dog, charbroiled?",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",

        "Tina: Sarah?",
        "Todd: Think of it this way. What's you name? Nurse: Janet. To: Janet, think of it this way. You'll be doing exactly what you've been doing -- taking care of marty, but you'll be making a hell of a lot more money than you were with ramsey.",
        "Janet: Are you trying to bribe me?",
        "Todd: Of course not. No, janet. I'm just saying he's cheap -- was cheap. I'm not. You know what I like about you -- already? I can tell that you're loyal. I like it. Ahem. But when I leave here, marty's coming with me. So, that leaves you with a couple choices. You can either say \"sayonara\" to marty or you can come down to the limo with our friend keys here and -- and wait for us to bring marty down.",
        "Keys: He's not that bad to work for.",

        "Markko: You're not even showing. Who'd know?",
        "Starr: I would know.",
        "Cole: Yeah, no, she's right.",
        "Markko: Oh, god -- you're right. Um --",
        "Langston: I'm such an idiot.",
        "Markko: I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: No, nobody is an idiot. Just go and have fun. Take a lot of pictures for me.",
        "Cole: Hey, I'm going to that appointment with you.",
        "Starr: Cole --",
        "Cole: What -- I want to, and don't try to stop me.",
        "Starr: No, I know that you want to go on that new roller coaster.",
        "Cole: Not more than I want to be with you.",
        "Markko: You know, the thing's busted half the time anyway.",
        "Langston: Yeah, and all the other rides are old news.",
        "Markko: And the lines are ridiculous.",
        "Starr: Ok, stop. I know what you're trying to do. Just go and scream your heads off and have fun for me, ok?",
        "Langston: This sucks.",
        "Starr: I'm fine.",
        "Markko: Hey, uh, I got to -- I got to head out.",
        "Cole: Yeah, , too. I promised nora that I'd get takeout with her. You know, the mood over at the buchanans' isn't quite hilarious with the whole mess --",
        "Starr: Ok, I get it.",
        "Cole: With buchanan enterprise.",
        "Starr: It's fine. It's fine. Just go.",
        "Cole: Ok. Well, I'll call you later, ok?",
        "Starr: Bye. I'll call you.",
        "Langston: Ok, spill.",
        "Starr: Spill what?",
        "Langston: Whatever it is that's bothering you -- and don't tell me nothing, because I can tell it's something --",
        "Starr: Ok. I told my mom that I don't think I'm ready to be a mother.",
        "Langston: Well, I thought that you said that you were --",
        "Starr: Langston, I just can't keep this baby.",
        "Starr: I didn't get a chance to think about all of this until my mom brought me and cole home, and I'm not ready to be a mother, langston. I mean, does that make me a horrible person?",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Starr: I know, but -- but pregnant women are supposed to want their kids.",
        "Langston: Pregnant women who wanted to be pregnant want their kids.",
        "Starr: But babies are supposed to sense all this uff in the womb, though, right? I mean, am I screwing mine up?",
        "Langston: Starr, your baby's got to be the size of a guppy or something.",
        "Starr: I know, but ever since I found out that I was pregnant I've been freaking out, langston. First, I -- I almost got an abortion. Then cole and I ran away, and my dad catches up to me and throws me down a flight of stairs. And now --",
        "Langston: And now, what?",
        "Starr: I just want this kid to have parents who will care about it.",
        "Langston: And you don't think you and cole could do that?",
        "Starr: I -- I mean, when we're so upset about missing out on a school field trip -- I mean, come on. You know that I am. We're both upset about that. You know, I want -- I want this baby to have parents who think that giving up on a big night out is the best thing that's ever happened to them, because they're going to get to spend time with the baby. My baby doesn't deserve a mother who's going to look inside the crib and think about all the stuff that she's missing out on just because the kid got born. That's awful. I mean, good parents know what to do, they have this patience. I mean, they know how to make a baby feel better.",
        "Langston: Don't you think you could figure that out? I mean, we'll help you. It'll be ok.",
        "Starr: I can't do this, langston. Ok, I just -- I can't, me.",
        "Langston: Ok. Forget it. I just -- so, what does that mean?",
        "Starr: Ok, well, I -- all last night I couldn't get any sleep, because I was thinking about that.",
        "Langston: And?",
        "Starr: And actually I went online and I found a lot of couples who can't have kids but really want them. And a girl who's just like me who helped them out.",
        "Langston: You mean adoption?",
        "Starr: Yeah. And I think I'm going to do it.",
        "Langston: Are you sure?",
        "Starr: I'm positive.",
        "Langston: Well, what does cole think? Cole doesn't know, does he?",
        "Marty: Every night lee gives me my pills, tells me to eat. Why isn't he here?",
        "Todd: Lee's not going to be able to take care of you anymore, marty.",
        "Marty: Those gunshots -- is he dead?",
        "Todd: I'm going to tell you everything later, but right now I think we should get you rest and out of here, get you someplace safe.",
        "Marty: And I'm supposed to believe I could be safe with you?",
        "Todd: Just close your eyes and go to sleep, ok?",
        "John: Help me or get out of my face, because either way I'm going in. Got an officer down up there. Oh, son of a bitch! Ugh!",
        "Cristian: Listen, you can have my wallet.",
        "Sarah: My purse is --",
        "Jonas: Shut up. Either of you see a woman in a big hat and sunglasses carrying a dog?",
        "Cristian: No.",
        "Sarah: Tons of them. This is a park.",
        "Cristian: What she meant is you're going to have to give us a little more than that.",
        "Jonas: Oh, ok. The dog is small. It doesn't walk. It gets carried by the woman in the hat and the sunglasses. Big hat, big sunglasses, little dog.",
        "Sarah: Like a toy?",
        "Jonas: Yeah. Have you seen it? Rah: No. Just asking.",
        "Jonas: Do I look like a patient man?",
        "Sarah: Do I look like a girl who's been sitting around looking for some rich bitch carrying a rat-sized dog?",
        "Jonas: Don't try me. I --",
        "Cristian: Listen, listen, don't listen to her. She's a little stressed out. She just lost someone she loved.",
        "Jonas: Well, if she doesn't help me, she may join her friend very soon.",
        "Cristian: We haven't seen who you're looking for, ok?",
        "Sarah: Oh, oh, but we -- but we heard the dog, you know, the little yipping noise that they make.",
        "Jonas: Where?",
        "Sarah: Over there. Five minutes ago.",
        "Jonas: You know what? You better not be lying to me.",
        "Cristian: Why would we lie?",
        "John: All right. Bag and tag everything. I'm going upstairs.",
        "Todd: Top of the evening to you.",
        "Todd: Top of the evening to you.",
        "Jonas: I'll get the jewels back. I said don't worry. Princess tina tells me that she grew up in llanview. How convenient for her to be so near the family plot.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, we'll be right here. Cops are on their way.",
        "Sarah: Can you believe that just happened?",
        "Cristian: That guy just stuck a gun in our faces in broad daylight like it was nothing. And you -- whathe hell was that? Do you have some kind of death wish?",
        "Sarah: I'm sorry I shot my mouth off. It was just the weirdest thing. I felt like -- like -- like we weren't alone.",
        "Cristian: What, did you think we had some kind of backup?",
        "Sarah: No. No. Um, I just -- I don't know -- I -- I had a feeling.",
        "Cristian: You think yoheard nash? Look, that's -- that's normal. He's been on your mind, so --",
        "Sarah: No, it wasn't nash. I feel like I heard my mother.",
        "Todd: You're fon-- you're fondling my constitutional rights, you know.",
        "John: Not much there. If you got a complaint, yocan tell it to the dead police commissioner downstairs.",
        "Todd: You have a boo-boo on your shoulder.",
        "John: Yeah. What are you doing here, manning?",
        "Todd: Oh, I just came in, check out my old digs and make ramsey another offer on the place. Blair kicked me out, so I'm looking for a place to call home.",
        "Starr: As much as cole thinks he's ready for a kid, he's really not.",
        "Langston: Starr, he's so into this baby.",
        "Starr: No, he's into the idea. He wants a family and I get that, but he's not thinking about what he's going to miss out on -- like school and college.",
        "Langston: But can't you guys still do that stuff?",
        "Starr: Ok, and who's going to raise the baby? A nanny? My mom? That's not fair. And as much as cole says it didn't bother him, I know he wanted to shoot hoops with the guys. I -- I know that he wants to go on this roller coaster, and he was just as out of ideas when we were with sam in the park as I was. We were freaking out.",
        "Langston: When it really comes down to it, I mean --",
        "Starr: Ok, I know that I'm doing the right thing, langston. But hoam I going to tell cole that -- that we should give this baby away? I mean, this is the only family that cole has left in this world.",
        "John: Just happen to show up here? Then what?",
        "Todd: I found ramsey dead and the other two guys dead.",
        "John: Yeah. Friends of yours?",
        "Todd: No, I don't have friends.",
        "John: Mm-hmm. So, what, you -- you skip over the bodies, didn't bother calling the cops, just come up here to the bedroom.",
        "Todd: Well, I was just -- wanted to search the place, make sure it was safe. Kind of like what you're doing.",
        "John's voice: So, who was in the bed?",
        "Todd: I have no idea. It was empty when I got here.",
        "John: Yeah, right. You know something. I'm going to find out what it is. Stay tuned for scenes from the next \"one life to live.\"",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jared: I'm going away and there's nothing that either of us can do about it.",
        "Natalie: Maybe there is.",
        "John: We need to find that woman.",
        "Bo: Do you really think you're going to get away with this?",
        "Jonas: I have reason to believe that the princess is here."
