        "Blair is with Spencer. He hugs her until her phone starts ringing. She sees that Bo is trying to reach her. She takes the call and when she ends it, Spencer is on her about it. She tries to go to Todd's room but the Head Nurse stops her telling that she isn't allowed in the room. Spencer overrides her order and then demands to know why Blair needs to talk to Todd right after talking to Bo. One of the orderlies wakes and tends to the others. The other orderly is fine but the driver is dead. The man jumps to Margaret's aid after calling the accident in. Rex arrives at Bo's office and tells that he has heard about a crash and Margaret's name was mentioned as the patient in the ambulance. John and Bo rush to the crash site and order the meds to make sure that they keep her alive. Evangeline shows up at the hospital. She tells Spencer and Blair that Margaret remembers everything. \"I need to talk to Todd,\" she says. Spencer says that Todd is resting right now. She says that this news is worth waking Todd up. \"Don't you think?\" She and the Head Nurse walk by Spencer and Blair and enter the room. Margaret is brought into the hospital and John and Bo are right behind her. They hear the monitors scream. \"Code blue!\" someone shouts! Spencer and Blair have come to the ER now and they wait with John and Bo for more developments. \"Is she going to make it Bo?\" Blair asks. \"She has to,\" he says. \" For a lot of reasons.\" He glares over at Spencer who paces in a corner. Todd is delirious over the idea that Margaret is going to come forward. They don't know what she will reveal yet but one can only hope. \"|Everyone knows that he is guilty everyone but Blair,\" Todd says. \"I am going to show that crazy bitch what Spencer's really about."

        "Evangeline: Well, I need to talk to Bo. It's about Todd.",
        "John: Your timing couldn't be better. We just got a phone call. Apparently, Margaret Cochran remembers everything.",
        "Bo: I just got off the phone with Blair. I told her they were bringing Margaret in and she's got a lot to say.",
        "John: Any chance she's with Truman?",
        "Bo: I think there's a real good chance, but I warned her not to tip him off. Any luck, we'll have enough evidence pretty soon that we'll be able to put him away for life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: So what did Bo want?",
        "Blair: Nothing. But I -- I remembered that I need to ask Todd something, so I'm going to just go talk --",
        "Spencer: Well, Starr is still in there with him, Blair.",
        "Blair: I need to go in and --",
        "Nurse: You can't.",
        "Blair: What are you talking about? I was just in there.",
        "Nurse: Mr. Manning asked specifically that you be barred from visitation.",
        "Blair: What? Oh, come on. Todd, come on. I need to get in there.",
        "Starr: What are you going to do?",
        "Blair: Can I come in? Come on, Todd. Just let me in, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Orderly: Whoa! Ah! Whoa! Ken? I fell out of the van. You ok?",
        "Ken: I'm still in the van.",
        "Orderly: Oh!",
        "Ken: I can't move, but I'll be ok. Take care of h.",
        "Orderly: Ok. Ok. Hang in there, lady. Oh. Damn it! Oh, ah! God. God. Oh. This is Unit 18. We crashed somewhere on Route 43 a couple miles east of town. There's an orderly injured, the driver's dead. And the passenger -- her pulse is weak and thready. She's not breathing. Her name is Cochran, Margaret Cochran. Send an ambulance now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I need a location of the van transporting Margaret Cochran. What's their ETA? Well, find it, all right? I want a police escort all the way back to Llanview PD, lights and sirens. We need her delivered fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: So, how's your mom today? Ok. What's up?",
        "Matthew: I saw the doctor who's trying to help Mom to talk again.",
        "R.J.: The speech therapist? I'm sorry. Go on.",
        "Matthew: I asked her how Mom was doing. She said not so good.",
        "R.J.: Did she say why?",
        "Matthew: She said because she thinks Mom's embarrassed because she can only talk with one side of her mouth because of the stroke, and I guess she thinks she sounds funny, so she won't even try.",
        "R.J.: Well, I mean, words and speech have been important to your mother, so I guess being like this has got to be hard for her.",
        "Matthew: Did you see how her mouth kind of goes down on one side?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Matthew: I guess it makes her slur her words or something. But nobody cares about that. Everybody just wants her to get better.",
        "R.J.: Well, your mom's got a lot of pride, you know, and she's a little stubborn, too, so I'm sure this has got her frustrated.",
        "Matthew: I don't know what to do.",
        "R.J.: Look, the main thing is just don't give up, all right? I mean, remember how we all were afraid that she might not even wake up? Well, she did, so if she did that, she can do this. You know, I have an idea, but I'm going to need your help.",
        "Matthew: Mine?",
        "R.J.: Mm-hmm. Yeah, just follow my lead. Do you think you can do that?",
        "Matthew: I'll try.",
        "R.J.: Ok. Come on. Hey. How are you? Don't know what that means. Do you, Matthew?",
        "Matthew: Nope.",
        "R.J.: Nope. I guess you're just going to have to tell us. Hmm? Yeah, I don't know what that look means, either.",
        "Matthew: It's like what you used to say to me when I was a kid -- use your words.",
        "R.J.: Si. Exactamente. Say it loud and proud. Oh, boy, Matthew. It looks like we're going to be here for a while.",
        "R.J.: Comfortable?",
        "Matthew: Yeah.",
        "R.J.: Yeah? Me, too. So, Nora, we're going to stay right here until you figure out what it is you want to say to us.",

        "Michael: Marcie? You can ask Gillette all of these questions, ok? She's an unbelievable pediatrician. She's unbelievable, buddy.",
        "Marcie: I can't believe that she has office hours this late.",
        "Michael: Well, she doesn't. She's doing me a favor.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Really? Well, did you tell her the situation?",
        "Michael: I told her that we have him until they can find a good foster home and that we know nothing about babies.",
        "Marcie: Hmm. Yeah, well, you know more than I do. Here, can you hold him?",
        "Michael: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Oh, goody. Oh, goody.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Michael, yes you do. Oh.",

        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: Hi. Um -- what's that?",
        "Marcie: Oh, these are my questions.",
        "Michael: Oh. How many pages are there, sweetie?",
        "Marcie: Well, these are all the notes that I've taken since we got him. Yes, it's when he -- he goes to the bathroom, when I change his diapers, when he smiles.",
        "Michael: Oh.",
        "Marcie: When he coughs --",
        "Michael: You don't expect Gillette to read all of that, do you?",
        "Marcie: Well, why not?",
        "Michael: Well, Marcie, come on.",
        "Marcie: Michael, that is a living thing that you're holding there.",
        "Michael: You don't say.",
        "Marcie: Yes, and, you know, he doesn't come with a book of instructions. And I didn't exactly have nine months to memorize Dr. Spock, did I? I did not.",
        "Michael: Marcie, nobody comes with a manual, ok? I mean, people have been raising babies for thousands of years.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Well, those people know that it's coming. You know, I like to be prepared, Michael.",
        "Michael: No, I do, I know -- I know that you do like that. I know you like that.",
        "Marcie: Excuse me. Here you go -- well, one of us has to be prepared, you know? I didn't know that you were coming. I didn't know that you were coming. No, I didn't. You know?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: And while -- while you're with us, you know, I'm going to damn well do -- oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to curse. I'm darn well going to do this right, Michael.",
        "Michael: Can I say something now?",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Michael: Listen, you know a lot more than you think you do. I mean, you've borne the brunt of taking care of Tommy since we got him and you are doing a wonder-- hasn't she done a good job? She's done a good job, hasn't she? Yes. Yes, she has.",
        "Marcie: I have to do a good job, you know? Because I started my life out without my mommy. He doesn't even have either one of his parents, Michael, and I have a pretty good idea of what you're facing, don't I? You know, while he's with us, I want him to know that the world -- it doesn't always suck. Oh -- I'm sorry, I did it again, I cursed.",
        "Doctor: Hello. This must be Tommy.",
        "Michael: Yes, and this is my wife, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Dr. Gillette: Marcie, it's a pleasure to meet you.",

        "Dr. Gillette: Come in, please.",
        "Marcie: Great.",
        "Michael: Come on. Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy boy. Come on, buddy boy.",
        "Marcie: Now, the first question that I have for you is when did you go to medical school and how long have you been in practice?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hey, hey, don't you --",
        "Nurse: You can't upset him.",
        "Blair: Touch me like that!",
        "Spencer: Nurse, please do as she says.",
        "Nurse: I am the head nurse on duty and Mr. Manning is my patient.",
        "Spencer: And I'm chief of surgery. I believe I outrank you. Now, please let her pass.",
        "Nurse: Yes, sir.",
        "Spencer: You want to tell me what's going on?",
        "Blair: I told you, I just want to talk to Todd.",
        "Spencer: No, what are you so upset about?",
        "Blair: What am I so upset about? Did you see how she was manhandling me? Give somebody a little power like that and they take it all the way to --",
        "Spencer: She was just doing her job, Blair.",
        "Blair: By harassing me? Look, I want to go in and I want to speak with Todd.",
        "Spencer: All right, fine --",
        "Blair: Now, if you would just move out of the way --",
        "Spencer: Yes, I will as soon as you tell me what Bo called you about and why you're so anxious to talk to Todd about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, this medication they're giving me for my pain really makes me sleepy, so maybe you ought to head home, huh?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Starr: Dad, Mom's out there. I don't want to have to deal with her.",
        "Todd: All right, now, listen to me. Hey.",
        "Starr: Hmm?",
        "Todd: Just because I'm mad at her doesn't mean you have to be.",
        "Starr: After all the things she's done to you?",
        "Todd: That's between her and me.",
        "Starr: Oh, come on.",
        "Todd: \"Oh, come on\" nothing. Hey, you guys drive me crazy. You're both alike, you know that?",
        "Starr: No, we're not. I thought that you and --",
        "Todd: Nah -- listen to me. You love her, she loves you, end of story.",
        "Starr: But I thought that I was like you.",
        "Todd: No, not a chance.",
        "Starr: Will I get to see you tomorrow?",
        "Todd: Yeah, why don't you bring a deck of cards and I'll whip your butt at gin rummy?",
        "Starr: Hey.",
        "Todd: Ooh.",
        "Starr: I love you.",
        "Todd: Me, too.",
        "Starr: Bye. Dad's tired and he doesn't want to see you, so just don't bother him, ok?",
        "Blair: Hey, Starr, look, you don't understand.",
        "Spencer: You know, Blair, maybe she's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: None of the units assigned to escort the van have raised ion the radio.",
        "Bo: Ok, look, I want to know the minute that that van carrying Margaret Cochran makes contact.",
        "Officer: Right.",
        "Evangeline: When you say that Margaret's memory has returned, what exactly do you mean?",
        "John: Well, she was on her way to St. Ann's when all of a sudden she tells one of the guys in the van that it was all coming back to her.",
        "Evangeline: Man, I wouldn't trust that woman as far as I could throw her. I mean, don't you think it was a ploy?",
        "Bo: I hope not. But if Margaret can tell us how she got to Thailand, what happened to her baby, then maybe that'll lead us to -- to the guy that set up Manning.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I understand that, Bo, but I mean, why tell the truth now?",
        "John: Maybe she wants to make a deal.",
        "Bo: Maybe she's sick of all the lying.",
        "Evangeline: When you say \"the person that set up Todd Manning,\" don't you mean Spencer Truman?",
        "Bo: All right, this is off the record, but, yeah, it's got to be him.",
        "John: I guess the motive was Blair Cramer.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: As a doctor, he would've had the access to things he needed for a frame- up.",
        "Bo: He was thorough. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if we haven't seen the end of this.",
        "John: Unless Margaret turns on him. If she does, that would clear a lot of people.",
        "Evangeline: Why don't you want Spencer to know that Margaret's memory has returned? I mean, wouldn't it be best to gauge his reaction?",
        "Rex: Hey, Bo.",
        "Bo: What do you want, Balsom?",
        "Rex: Well, I was coming to see you, but -- what's going on?",
        "Bo: What -- we're bringing in a suspect right now. Could you excuse us, please?",
        "Rex: Well, look, I heard something as I came in -- a van calling for an ambulance?",
        "John: What?",
        "Rex: Yeah. The van crashed, route 43, a couple of miles east of town. Guy said the driver was dead, passenger wasn't breathing, and then he said her name was Margaret Cochran.",

        "Lindsay: Hi, guys.",
        "R.J.: Hey.",
        "Lindsay: Nora, you look great. I'm totally serious. I mean, you're sitting up, your eyes are open. This is like a miracle.",
        "R.J.: Hey, Matthew? Will you stay here on the job with your mom, and, Lindsay, could I have a word with you out in the hall for a minute?",
        "Lindsay: Sure.",
        "R.J.: Great.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah.",
        "R.J.: Be right back.",
        "Matthew: Hey, Mom, remember when I was a little kid, you said I used to call helicopters \"hockers\"?",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Matthew: I thought it sounded stupid, but you thought it was great because I was learning a big, long word and I was doing my best to say it. Well, now you're learning, too -- all over again. And it doesn't matter how it sounds. I just need to talk to my mom again. Please try.",
        "Lindsay: Is something wrong?",
        "R.J.: No, no, no, it's not that. It's just I was trying something with Nora, but it's not going to work if you're in the room.",
        "Lindsay: What?",
        "R.J.: Don't get upset.",
        "Lindsay: Well, it's just that I've been coming here to visit her with you every day for months and now, all of a sudden, I banned from her room?",
        "R.J.: Well, no, no, it's not personal.",
        "Lindsay: Well, it feels personal.",
        "R.J.: Ok, then I must have said it the wrong way.",
        "Lindsay: No kidding.",
        "R.J.: Look, it's just that Matthew says that Nora's embarrassed about trying to speak because of how it sounds.",
        "Lindsay: I get that. I just don't understand why I can't be in the room.",
        "R.J.: Well, I just promised her that I was not going to leave until she said something to Matthew and me, and she's not going to open her mouth to say boo with you in the room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Please, Mom.",
        "Nora: [Mumbles] I love you. I -- I love you. I love you.",

        "Dr. Gillette: I'm happy to report this baby is in perfect physical shape.",
        "Marcie: So his -- I was right. His problem is developmental, then?",
        "Dr. Gillette: What is?",
        "Marcie: Well, his problem.",
        "Dr. Gillette: What problem?",
        "Michael: Um, Marcie, the doctor just said he's fine.",
        "Marcie: Well, physically, she said he was fine, but, look, doctor, I've been doing a lot of reading up on babies --",
        "Dr. Gillette: Somehow, that doesn't surprise me.",
        "Marcie: Well, look, he only turns over in one direction, you know, and he smiles and he seems happy.",
        "Dr. Gillette: Right.",
        "Marcie: Well, right, but then he reaches for things that catch his eye -- well, you see my point, don't you?",
        "Dr. Gillette: Not completely.",
        "Marcie: Well, that's what babies are supposed to do when they're 3 months old, but he's 4 months old, right, and he can't even turn over from his stomach on to his back, and I haven't seen him reach -- staring at his own hand, and in the book, it says that he is supposed to do that.",
        "Dr. Gillette: Marcie, I'm going to -- no. Tommy here is going to need you to trust me. All those things you're reading -- well, they're just guides. Every baby has his or her own timetable.",
        "Marcie: Well, yes. I -- I understand that, but see, well, I feel like --",
        "Dr. Gillette: You feel exactly like every other new mother does -- overwhelmed.",
        "Marcie: Well, see, the -- the thing is, is --",
        "Michael: Here you go.",
        "Marcie: Is I'm not his mother. If I was his mother, then I would know those things. I would know what to do.",
        "Dr. Gillette: Well, you know exactly what to do and you're doing it all perfectly. And even if it's just temporary, you are his mom.",
        "Marcie: Well, what if he starts getting sick and I don't notice it and Michael's not around?",
        "Dr. Gillette: That won't happen. You'll know.",
        "Marcie: How do you know that I'll know?",
        "Dr. Gillette: Tommy has confidence in you. I saw him smile when he looked up at your face. That's a baby's version of \"thumbs up,\" \"four stars.\" Marcie, don't worry. Just enjoy him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, I never thought I'd see the day when the two of you team up together.",
        "Starr: Dad's sleeping. Even if he did want to see you, which he doesn't, he needs his rest.",
        "Spencer: She's right about that, Blair.",
        "Blair: So you've turned into his little gatekeeper, right? Going to keep me as far away as possible?",
        "Spencer: Blair?",
        "Blair: No, it's ok. I understand. Probably never going to forgive me, either, are you?",

        "Starr: Dad told me to.",
        "Blair: He did, did he?",
        "Starr: Yeah, Mom. You know, he's not such an awful person. Even though he can't stand to see you right now, he doesn't want you to be upset. But you won't be, right, because you have him.",
        "Spencer: She'll calm down. Just give her some time. It'll be all right -- you'll see.",

        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Bo: Ok. Did Evangeline leave?",
        "Rex: Yeah. I think she was getting out of here to tell Todd about Margaret remembering.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Let's just hope that Margaret will be able to remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Orderly: Ok, ok. Ok, good, there's a pulse. Ok, good. Come on, stay with me. Come on, Margaret! Three, four, five -- Over here. We're over here! She's still not breathing. You're going to have to bag her. Walt's in the back of the van. Ken, the driver, is dead.",
        "E.M.T.: Come on, buddy. Let me take a look at you.",
        "Orderly: I'm ok, man! But help her. You got to help her.",

        "Spencer's voice: Blair has moved on. I mean, she's not going to listen to anything you have to say ever again.",
        "Todd: I'm not the one doing the talking right now. The police have been talking to her. Yeah. They've been talking her ear off, and I think they're starting to get through to her.",
        "Spencer: Hey, welcome back.",
        "Blair: You guarding the gate?",
        "Spencer: No, I just figured this was as good a place as any to wait for you. So where'd you go?",
        "Blair: I told you, I just went out to get air.",
        "Spencer: Yeah. See, the thing is, your mood was -- was perfectly fine with me one second, and then the very next second, it just -- It was completely different after you hung up the phone with Bo.",
        "Blair: What's with the interrogation, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: I'm just concerned about you, that's all, Blair.",
        "Blair: Well, thank you, but I can't just change just like that and be fine. This has been a horrible ordeal for me -- I'm just finding out that I was wrong about Todd for so long?",
        "Spencer: Is that why you're so anxious to get in and talk with him? You think you're just going to fix it?",
        "Blair: Todd nearly died. My daughter hates me. I think I owe it to the both of them to try to make it right.",
        "Spencer: Well, I suppose so, but it still doesn't explain the inconsistencies in your attitude towards me, now, does it? Put yourself in my position. Blair, I mean, I'm being accused of heaven knows what. You get a call from the commissioner of police and now your attitude changes again?",
        "Blair: Shouldn't have to prove myself to you, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: You can't even look at me.",
        "Blair: Evangeline?",

        "Evangeline: Well, I just came by to see Todd.",
        "Spencer: He's resting. As a matter of fact, Starr just left him. She said he was pretty exhausted.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I think he's going to want to hear what I have to say. You see, Margaret remembers everything. Dr. Truman, don't you agree that would be worth waking him up for?",
        "Nurse: I'll take you in, Ms. Williamson.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you.",

        "Marcie: Yes, Michael. She was very nice.",
        "Michael: Yeah. She's only board certified, published, an expert in her field. What'd you think -- I was going to take the kid to a quack?",
        "Marcie: Oh, come on. Don't be mad at me, please.",
        "Michael: I'm not mad at you. Marcie, I'm frustrated. You know, the -- the kid is perfectly healthy and you are wonderful with him.",
        "Marcie: But he's not doing all the things that a 4-month-old should be doing.",
        "Michael: Yes, but you heard Gillette -- all babies go on their own timetable.",
        "Marcie: You know, Michael, it's -- it's just that I read this one website, you know? And, well, it said that things that happen to them, right, things that happen to you when you're a little baby, things that you might not ever remember -- well, they can affect them for the rest of their lives and -- oh.",

        "Michael: But he made it through that tornado, Marcie, and when they found him, he was perfectly healthy.",
        "Marcie: I know that, Michael. I do know that, but I just want --",
        "Michael: You want what's best for him, I know that, but maybe it's a lot easier than we think it is. Maybe it's just about being hopeful and patient. Yes. Yes.",
        "Marcie: I just want to know how to do that.",

        "Michael: Yeah. I've planned my mid-life crisis for tomorrow morning. [Pager beeps] Listen, I have to go and heal the sick.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: I don't care how much he cries. He doesn't get the car unless he puts out the trash, all right, junior? See you.",

        "Rex: Oh.",
        "Marcie: Right?",
        "Rex: And I was making jokes. I love being me. What else can I say that's inappropriate?",
        "Marcie: You didn't say anything that was inappropriate. Look, I think he likes you. He keeps on looking at you.",
        "Rex: I'm no expert. I think who he likes is you.",

        "Evangeline: I told you that Blair and Spencer are together, I told you about Spencer's reaction, and when I told --",
        "Todd: Right, Blair was here earlier. She was banging on the window, she was yelling her fool head off trying to get that nurse to let her in. Does she know about Margaret?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. Bo called her right after he heard.",
        "Todd: That's why she wanted to see me. She wanted to tell me about it. I think she's starting to come around about Spencer.",
