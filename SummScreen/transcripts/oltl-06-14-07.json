        "Cole: Langston? I have a question about this scene here.",
        "Langston: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cole: What, exactly, is motivating my character to bust out into song here? Hello? Earth to Langston?",
        "Langston: Shh -- I'm trying to lip-read.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: You know, it'd be fun to go together, unless you're anti-prom or something -- you know, too cool for school.",
        "Starr: Yeah. Hardly.",
        "Markko: But you're waiting for some other guy to ask you?",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? The prom is tonight. That would be so pathetic if I was just sitting at home waiting for a guy to finally come to his senses and -- yeah, I'm sorry, I have no idea what I'm talking about. Um -- the answer is -- is no, I'm -- I'm not waiting around for anybody.",
        "Markko: Oh, good. Well, then we should definitely go together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Ok, wait, I'm -- I'm not ready yet, sorry. I --",
        "Bo: You don't like getting your picture taken there, Sahid?",
        "Talia: Anything for the job, boss.",
        "Lindsay: You know what? You are in the hands of a master, you're going to look like a million, so don't worry about it.",
        "Cristian: These are just tests. I'll let you know when it's showtime.",
        "Talia: Ok.",
        "Bo: You know, Lindsay, it's not too late to move this whole operation to another gallery.",
        "Lindsay: No. No way. I want to help you flush this guy out.",
        "Bo: \"This guy\"? I don't want to spook you right now, but we don't know exactly how many people there are out there.",
        "Lindsay: I know that it's dangerous, but I also know that you're going to do everything you can to keep us safe, ok? But I also happen to be a victim of this guy, so if you want credibility, I'm your girl.",
        "Bo: Ok, but your -- your role in this whole thing, it ends as soon as we get all these pictures hung and we get our surveillance gear up and running.",
        "Lindsay: Ok, you got it.",
        "Bo: Ok -- and you don't come back until I say \"all clear.\"",
        "Lindsay: Well I don't think that's going to take very long, because I think this \"Real Americans\" exhibit is going to be like waving a red flag in front of a bull -- he's not going to be able to stay away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You don't love Laurence, so why'd you marry him? What are you not telling me?",
        "Miles' voice: Marry me. I'll make you happy. And I promise, I will never tell a living soul that you killed Spencer.",
        "John: Listen, talk to me, and I can help you.",
        "Marty: You know, why don't you do the talking? And you can start by apologizing for disrespecting my marriage.",
        "John: I'd do that it was real, but it's not.",
        "Marty: Oh, ok, John, right. So are you ready to have an honest conversation about what constitutes a real marriage?",
        "John: Knock it off. You got a husband in name only. Why don't you tell me why that is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Aw.",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "Miles: Hi.",
        "Blair: Let me help you with these. There you go.",
        "Miles: Thank you. Appreciate it.",
        "Blair: You're welcome. Well -- so where is the missus?",
        "Miles: Oh, I'm afraid she's out, but I -- I'll tell stopped by.",
        "Blair: Oh, that's too bad. I was hoping to talk to the both of you, but I guess you will have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Hey, Matthew.",
        "Bo: Hey, guys.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Lindsay: Hi, Nora.",
        "Nora: Lindsay.",
        "Matthew: I told Emily I was doing a photo shoot for this art show.",
        "Bo: No, I --",
        "Matthew: No, don't worry. I didn't give her the details.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Matthew: Anyway, she says she thought it was sexy.",
        "Bo: Oh. Is that right?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. I mean, that's a great thing. Has a girl ever said anything like that to you?",
        "Bo: I don't know. I mean, let me think about it, and then I'll have to get back to you.",
        "Matthew: Uh-huh.",
        "Nora: Um, I thought the plan was to keep Lindsay as far away from the area as possible.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, we were going over some last-minute details here, though.",
        "Nora: Well, you couldn't have done that with the building superintendent?",
        "Lindsay: Well --",
        "Bo: I --",
        "Lindsay: We thought it would make more sense for me to do the press rather than Bo.",
        "Bo: Yeah. I mean, you got to admit, it's -- we got to make it look good in front of the news, and I'm not the first person that you think of when you're talking about things like art shows.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, that's --",
        "Lindsay: It would have been a dead giveaway.",
        "Nora: Yeah. Well -- I mean, do you have any other good ideas about our operation?",
        "Lindsay: Just that you and Matthew should have as much fun as you can.",
        "Nora: Fun?",
        "Lindsay: Cristian's a great photographer. You two have been through a rough time. Why not make the most of it?",
        "Matthew: That's what I thought, so I brought my soccer jersey and my ball.",
        "Lindsay: Yay! That's exactly what we want. We want to get pictures of you really being special.",
        "Matthew: Yeah. Why don't we take ours together? I mean, it's not like we have a lot of pictures of us left.",
        "Nora: You're right. That's a great idea. [Nora chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kirk: Did you hear what I said?",
        "Kirk: The lice know about Wyoming.",
        "Tate: So what?",
        "Kirk: Will you stop what you're doing and listen to me?",
        "Tate: You know, I stopped listening to you a long time ago. And you know what? I'm a hell of a lot better off.",
        "Kirk: You're wrong. And if you don't step up to the plate, you're going to take us both down. Romance is in the air, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Yeah, well, I like it special for my wife.",
        "Blair: Oh, I bet you do. I remember what it was like to be a newlywed. I can't wait to rush home to my new husband. I hope it's as good for you as it was for me.",
        "Miles: I couldn't be happier.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Miles: You look nice. Special occasion?",
        "Blair: Oh, thank you, Miles.",
        "Miles: Huh.",
        "Blair: No, I'm just singing at Capricorn later.",
        "Miles: Oh. I -- you know, I've been wanting to hear you sing for a while now. I just -- I haven't had the time.",
        "Blair: Well, you should make the time.",
        "Miles: Well, I would, but Marty --",
        "Blair: I know, I know. Marty and I -- we'd probably go to blows on our best day. It's -- it's all right.",
        "Miles: Yeah. Well, I -- I would -- I --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Miles: Well, I -- I wish I could fix things between you two. It's --",
        "Blair: Hey -- you know, it's going to take more than an apology for me to get over my Marty issues anytime soon. And you don't have to fix anything because it's not your responsibility. Hmm.",
        "Miles: Well, Marty is my wife, and ---",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Miles: Her happiness is my responsibility. Isn't that the way you feel about Todd?",
        "Blair: I did before when -- when he was here. But you know, he's gone now. And if he were to magically appear right where you're standing, I wouldn't want him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You know, I don't know how you arrived at this conclusion, but you -- you are completely wrong. Miles is the man I chose. This marriage is something I chose. I don't have to explain myself to you or anybody else.",
        "John: You done? Good. Let's talk about something else. On May 30, you signed in at Statesville Prison for the purpose of visiting David Vickers.",
        "Marty: No, I didn't.",
        "John: Here's a copy of the visitors' log. If I'm not mistaken, that's your signature, so don't bother wasting my time to tell me you weren't there.",
        "Marty: So are you -- are you interrogating me now?",
        "John: You told Vickers you knew he didn't kill Truman.",
        "Marty: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "John: I -- I talked to him, all right? He gave it all up. He told me he took the rap for killing Truman to get a big payout on the back end.",
        "Marty: Oh, and -- and you believe him? You took his word -- what -- what -- a liar, a con artist, a murderer?",
        "John: If all I had was Vickers' word, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now. I have your word, too. You told me you had done something. But we didn't get a chance to finish what it was because we kept getting interrupted.",
        "Marty: And I explained that to you. I wanted to tell you about me and Miles.",
        "John: You had a panic attack over telling a -- an acquaintance that you got end?",
        "Marty: No! Yes, I --",
        "John: You had every opportunity in the world to tell me about this marriage before it happened, but you purposely waited till after. Hey, look at me. I can help you. But I can't do that unless you come clean with me, all right? Just tell me what you told Vickers. Tell me what you know about Truman's murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: All right. The easy part's over. Why don't you take a breather before we shoot the real thing? You know, relax.",
        "Talia: Cristian, if you tell me to relax one more time, I swear --",
        "Cristian: You don't like to relax?",
        "Talia: Ha, ha.",
        "Cristian: You don't know how to relax?",
        "Talia: Ha, funny.",
        "Vincent: Hey, hey, hey. What's going on here?",
        "Cristian: Hey. How's it going, Vincent?",
        "Layla: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Thanks for coming. Shaun, good to see you, man. Looking a little puny there, huh? Haven't been working out?",
        "Shaun: Just a little.",
        "Cristian: Ow, ow, ow, man. That's my bad hand.",
        "Shaun: I know.",
        "[Vincent chuckles]",
        "Shaun: Hey, come meet my granddad. Granddad, Fred Wynn -- Cristian Vega.",
        "Cristian: Pleased to meet you, sir.",
        "Fred: So you know what you're doing, son? Because I'll tell you right now, I'm a dignified old man.",
        "Cristian: Mr. Wynn, you got my word.",
        "Fred: Gotcha. Call me Fred.",
        "Cristian: Fred. Look, I know I was joking around before, but I -- I do take this seriously.",
        "Fred: No, son, back in the day, we sang when we marched, and we laughed. Some of us even fell in love. So don't think for a second you shouldn't be smiling. I mean, the fact that we can still laugh and experience joy proves that those racists haven't won.",
        "Cristian: Yes, sir. Got it.",
        "Vincent: Vega, I didn't know you had a hand in this.",
        "Cristian: Bo asked me to do this.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. Isn't your brother still in the hospital?",
        "Cristian: That's right. They're picking shrapnel out of his guts. I tell you, I'll do anything to catch the bastard who's responsible.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Layla: How is Antonio?",
        "Cristian: Well, not really up to taking pictures right now. But he's doing all right. How's Vange?",
        "Layla: Not up for a photo shoot, either. So I brought this along. I thought you'd represent for the Williamsons.",
        "Cristian: Think she'd want you getting involved?",
        "Layla: Probably not, but maybe if I tell her, she'll get mad and wake the hell up.",
        "Cristian: It could work.",
        "Lindsay: Hey, everyone. Hi. I'm Lindsay Rappaport, the owner of the gallery. I want to thank everybody for being part of this project.",
        "Layla: Thank us? Thank you, Lindsay, for hosting this.",
        "Lindsay: It's my pleasure. Ok, let's just get through this as quickly as we possibly can.",
        "Cristian: I'm ready when you're ready, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: All right.",
        "Cristian: Let's do it.",
        "Lindsay: Let's do it.",

        "Heather: Limo or SUV?",
        "Britney: Stretch limo. My parents insisted.",
        "Heather: And we're all sleeping over after, right? Boys included?",
        "Britney: Mm-hmm. It's catered and everything.",
        "Girl: Dry or wet?",
        "Britney: Soaking. Where's Cole? He should be hearing all this.",
        "Langston: You're breathing on me.",
        "Cole: What's up with those two?",
        "Langston: If I knew, I wouldn't be trying to figure it out.",
        "Britney: Cole, my dad booked us a limo for tonight.",
        "Heather: Stretch limo.",
        "Langston: Ever heard of global warming?",
        "Heather: My dad says it doesn't exist.",
        "Langston: He owns a car dealership, right?",
        "Heather: He owns an oil company -- duh.",
        "Britney: Ok, girls, no cat fights -- not on prom night, please.",
        "Cole: Hey, I figured out, you know, the whole car thing.",
        "Britney: On the day of? Cole, every limo in town's been booked for weeks. Anyways, I've been wondering -- should we get picked up at my place or yours?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Come on, don't keep a guy hanging.",
        "Starr: Sure. Um -- I'll go with you. Why not?",
        "Markko: Once more with feeling?",
        "Starr: I would love to go to prom with you.",
        "Markko: Sweet. Then it's a date.",
        "Marcie: Attention, everybody. I need you to gather around. Drop what you're doing. Hurry up, come on! We don't have much time if you want to get out for the prom. Markko, Starr, come on. Everybody means \"everybody.\" Move it.",
        "Markko: I'm sorry. I was just sorting things out with my prom date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I thought you really cared about Todd. You were so determined to bring him back.",
        "Blair: Well, my children miss their father, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for my kids.",
        "Miles: That's the way Marty feels about Cole. That's one of the things I love about her.",
        "Blair: Every day that Todd is gone, I go home to questions that I can't answer. I swear, it stresses me out so much. I -- [Blair sighs] Miles, I never should have accused you of having anything to do with Todd's disappearance.",
        "Miles: I hardly knew Todd. I --",
        "Blair: I know. If anything, you tried to do your best to help him find his so and -- you know, I was just desperate to have my children hold on to any kind of hope. That's why I went after you. And it's not an excuse. Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that I'm really, really sorry, ok? Mile. Than I appreciate that. And -- and I accept your apology. I understand, though. I -- I'm starting to get to know what it's like to be a parent. You'll do anything to protect your children.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So I visited David Vickers. So what? You know, you are reaching, John.",
        "John: No, there's something here. I know it. And you know it. And trying to hide it is just going to make me look harder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: If I tell you what you want to know, I am not the only person who is going to pay.",
        "John: Marty, the truth is going to come out, anyway. You tell me now, and I can help you. We can figure out the best way to handle this. But if you don't, I can't make any promises.",
        "Marty: I killed Spencer Truman.",
        "Reporter: Can you tell us a little bit about the genesis of this exhibit?",
        "Lindsay: Certainly. Cristian Vega is a multifaceted artist who, as you know, has been targeted by the hate violence that's recently hit Llanview. Over the course of several conversations, we started batting around ideas about what artists in a community could do to address the ignorance that feeds racism. The one thing that we kept coming back to over and over is something that Nelson Mandela once said. \"People must learn to hate. And if people can learn to hate, they can be taught to love. For love come naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\" We thought this exhibit would be a good way of putting that lesson into practice. Cristian's pictures take care to acknowledge our individuality, but they also highlight our similarities, our common character.",
        "Reporter: And that's why it's called \"Real Americans\"?",
        "Lindsay: Exactly. Whatever our differences, we all share the same basic values. We love, we ha families. These people may have been targeted for their differences, but they'll stand up for themselves and for their loved ones. They're proud of who they are. Cristian and I wanted to give our subjects the forum to express that and to rebut the idea that they are at all \"Un- American.\"",
        "Reporter: Well, thank you for taking the time to talk with us this afternoon.",
        "Lindsay: Thank you.",
        "Reporter: That's \"Real Americans\" at the Rappaport fine arts gallery on June 18.",

        "Tate: You would love that, wouldn't you? To drag me down into your cesspool.",
        "Kirk: Didn't you hear me? The cops -- the cops are asking questions.",
        "Tate: That's not my problem. I've got nothing to do with it.",
        "Kirk: Really? Well, what if they make it your problem?",
        "Tate: What do you care?",
        "Kirk: \"What do I care?\" You're my son. Why do you think I did all this?",
        "Tate: Whatever you did, you did for yourself, not for me.",
        "Kirk: That's not true.",
        "Tate: No, all these years, huh? I mean, you were so disappointed in me. The choices that I made. You never came to my games or --",
        "Kirk: All right, me not being there -- that was a mistake.",
        "Tate: No, no, it's the best thing you ever did. I ought to thank you for showing me how twisted you are, the way you think, act. I'm nothing like you.",
        "Kirk: No, but you are my son. And I still love you.",
        "Tate: Are you even capable?",
        "Kirk: It was pride at kept me from reaching out. But I thought about you all the time.",
        "Tate: I thought about you, too. I thought \"how could this man's blood possibly run in my veins?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Britney: Delicious. With you two going together, the whole cast will be there. I'm sure we can still find you a date.",
        "Langston: Don't do me any favors.",
        "Marcie: Come on, guys, please. The musical is tomorrow. We really need to pull it together, ok? Enough, enough! Britney, Heather, and Amy, you are with me. Markko, I need you to go over the steps to \"eye on the ball\" with Cole because he really needs help.",
        "Markko: Yeah, no problem. I'll school his ass.",
        "Marcie: Callate!",
        "Cole: Yeah, say that again. I'll show you schooling.",
        "Marcie: Gentlemen!",
        "Cole: Ok, tough guy?",
        "Marcie: Gentlemen! Please. Markko're just playing. Come on.",
        "Starr: Hey, Britney sucks. Don't listen to her, ok?",
        "Langston: Never do. So when were you going to tell me about Markko?",
        "Starr: Well, just now. He asked me, like, five minutes ago. It was so random.",
        "Langston: Yeah, well, you do know Mr. Krump-m's a total jerk, right?",
        "Starr: I don't think he's that bad.",
        "Langston: Compared to who?",
        "Starr: Look, it's not like we're getting married or anything. We're going together so that we don't miss out.",
        "Langston: Just as friends?",
        "Starr: Yes.",
        "Langston: Would you be going at all if Cole wasn't going with Britney?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ok, I know this is tough, but I'm going to need to hear all of it.",
        "Marty: Then what?",
        "John: Then you're just going to have to trust me. Just tell me what happened. I need you to fill in the blanks.",
        "Marty: I wish I could. I don't remember all of it.",
        "John: You blocked it out?",
        "Marty: Part of it. I -- I'm -- I'm working on trying to remember it. Look, I know I did it.",
        "John: Then just what you remember.",
        "Marty: I remember the room. I saw Spencer attack Blair. And I saw the scissors. I can see them in my hand. I just know I did it.",
        "John: When did you start remembering?",
        "Marty: A few weeks ago.",
        "John: Before you were married?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "John: Does remembering any of this -- did that cause you to get married?",
        "Marty: Why does one thing have to be connected to the other?",
        "John: I don't know. You tell me.",
        "Marty: You know what? Don't condescend to me. Have you ever been married? Well, people do it for a lot of different reasons.",
        "John: Ok. So what were yours?",
        "Marty: Look, you know what? This was my choice. Why can't we just leave it at that?",
        "John: Because no one suddenly remembers killing a guy and then decides \"hey, you know what I want to do? I want to go get hitched.\"",
        "Marty: Well, I did!",
        "John: Because you wanted to?",
        "Marty: Yes!",
        "John: You're lying. All right? Just admit it. Admit it! You married this guy because you remembered killing Truman.",
        "Marty: Yes. Yes.",

        "Miles: Well, I'm optimistic. Although I am worried about Cole. I want him to be happy, but everything I do just doesn't seem to work.",
        "Blair: Miles, he's a teenage boy. I think what's important is that you tell him and you let him know that you care. And the rest will come.",
        "Miles: Think so?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I know so. But I have to admit, it's a really big undertaking to take on a wife and her -- her grown boy. It's -- it's great. I mean, it's one more difference between you and Todd.",
        "Miles: Excuse me? I --",
        "Blair: You don't know this. And it's kind of crazy, but right after we first met, I went home to my Aunt Dorian and I told her that I had met you, and that I thought that you were the anti-Todd and that you were perfect for me. And -- I know I should have said something then because look at you now -- now you're married, and you're here with -- with Marty. And -- well, I should have said something, but now it's too late.",

        "Langston: Who says I even want to go?",
        "Starr: I want you to go. Ok? Markko's cute, and he's a good dancer and all, but you're my best friend. It wouldn't be as much fun without you.",
        "Langston: Yeah?",

        "Blair: Well, it is your innocence that makes you so special. And you know what? If we were together, I could help you hold on to that, just like you could help me.",
        "Miles: Yeah, you seem so capable.",
        "Blair: Well, everybody needs help every now and then, even me.",

        "Marty: Why would I tell him?",
        "John: I don't know. Then why did you get married?",
        "Marty: It was like I said. When I started remembering what was happening, I knew the truth would come out someday. It was inevitable. So when that happened, I knew I would go to prin. And I'm willing to pay for what I did, but what about Cole? I can't just leave him unprotected.",
        "John: Unprotected from what?",
        "Marty: The system. Come on, you and I both know what happens to kids there at the foster cares and the group homes. It's dangerous. And my husband -- well, he has a million enemies that wouldn't think twice about going after my son for revenge. So I had to think of someone who had resources, who could take care of him and keep him safe. Miles can do that. My son is the most precious thing to me in this world. And I would do anything -- anything to keep him safe. So do I love Miles? No. But now that you know I killed Spencer Truman, you have to arrest me.",

        "Kirk: Well, we have differences. But right now, Tate, you got to stop and look at the big picture.",

        "Marcie: I think that's very close to the excuse that I used when I didn't go. And you want to know something? To this day, I wish I would have gone. I wish I would have just sucked it up and went, now? Date or no date. I really, really think you should go. And I think I know a way how it might be worth your while.",
