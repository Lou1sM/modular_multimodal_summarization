        "Starr: You don't want me to go to prom with Markko?",
        "Cole: It has nothing to do with Markko. I just don't want you to go with anybody -- except me.",

        "David: Oh.",
        "John: Hey. Manicure or pedicure -- what's the first thing you're going to do when you get out of here?",
        "David: I think you mean \"if\" I get out of here.",
        "John: Oh, ye of little faith. You didn't kill your brother, Vickers.",
        "David: No, but if we tell everybody that, I'm not going to be able to collect, so if it's all the same to you, John, just let me rot away in my cell while my money multiplies in an undisclosed location.",
        "John: Sorry.",
        "[David sighs]",
        "David: You're going to have to be one hell of a salesman to convince the warden, especially considering I confessed.",

        "Blair: No, it's tonight!",
        "Dorian: Are you telling me that some young man invited her just this afternoon?",
        "Blair: Dorian, I'm not going to get into the dating etiquette with you. We have to find a dress for my daughter and I can't do it alone, all right?",
        "Dorian: Well, of course you've got my help. I'm sure we can come up with something.",
        "Blair: No, it can't be just \"something.\" We're talking about Starr Manning here! It's got to be perfect, it's got to be special! It's the biggest night of her life!",

        "Langston: Took you long enough to ask her.",
        "Markko: What's your problem?",
        "Langston: Starr's my best friend and she's had it rough lately, so you better treat her right or I'll make your life a living hell.",
        "Markko: I'm going to treat her fine. You know, maybe if you lightened up a little bit, you'd have a date to the prom, too.",
        "Langston: There's not one of you losers I'd even consider going with.",
        "Markko: Well, I wouldn't ask you if you were the last girl on the planet.",

        "Starr: Please don't do this, Cole.",
        "Cole: No, this needs to be said.",
        "Starr: You're going to upset your girlfriend.",
        "Cole: Britney is not my girlfriend! Half the time, I don't even like her.",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Cole: Do you know how bad I want to go to the prom with you tonight? I'm not the one that wanted to break up.",
        "Starr: I didn't, either! Did you forget about our parents? This was the best thing for everybody.",
        "Cole: Is this the best thing for you, or us? Because you don't seem happy to me and I'm -- well, I'm completely miserable.",
        "Starr: What do you want me to say?",
        "Cole: Just start being yourself again. When we first met, you weren't afraid of anything. That's part of what made me fall in love with you. And you loved me till you lost your nerve and just threw it all away.",
        "Starr: My dad tried to kill you, Cole.",
        "Cole: Your dad's gone, and he may never come back.",

        "David: So you go in there and announce that career con man Vickers is innocent and upstanding psychiatrist Saybrooke is guilty of killing dr. Truman, and you think the warden's just going to say, \"Oh, well, in that case, let's let David go free?\"",
        "John: What the hell's wrong with you, huh? If this plan is going to work, this needs to stay between us.",
        "David: There's a plan? You never said there was a plan.",

        "Starr: No, he's gone and he might never come back, and that sucks, and everything sucks.",
        "Cole: Well, it doesn't have to! We can fix this -- us.",
        "Starr: How? You're going to ditch Britney and I'm going to ditch Markko? Not even Britney deserves that.",

        "Starr: Together?",
        "Cole: Yes.",
        "Starr: Even though my dad is gone, Cole, our moms still hate each other.",
        "Cole: They just need more convincing, that's all.",
        "Starr: They are mortal enemies! They go at each other's throat every time they're in the same room!",
        "Cole: So you're giving up on us?",
        "Starr: No, I'm not.",
        "Cole: Yes, you are!",

        "John: Thank you, warden.",
        "Warden: Ahem.",
        "John: The reason why I'm here is I have reason to believe that although guilty of many other things, David Vickers is innocent of this murder.",
        "Warden: Do you have evidence that exonerates him?",
        "John: Nothing that would stand up in court.",
        "Warden: He confessed. He was convicted and sentenced, he took a plea bargain.",
        "John: He lied.",
        "Warden: That's a first -- lying to get into prison?",
        "John: Well, he's a weird dude. I'm sure you've found that out, but I know you don't want an innocent man in here any more than I do.",
        "Warden: I'm more worried about letting a killer walk.",
        "John: I understand, and I have a plan to catch the real killer. But to do that, I need to get Vickers out of here today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Hey! That's my life they're talking about in there.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, warden, we can do this my way under the radar or if the press finds out you didn't care you had an innocent man in here, forced retirement may be your best option.",
        "Warden: I need more information.",
        "John: Sorry, that's all I can give you.",

        "Blair: No, you know, the odds don't work with Todd. Anyway, he called me.",
        "Dorian: When?",
        "Blair: Just a few days ago. I -- I asked John to check it out, but there was no caller I.D., And I really couldn't tell if it was actually him or not, but it was him, all right? And it said that it was probably just some prepaid phone card.",
        "Dorian: I -- I'm sorry. We don't have time to deal with Todd and --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: Well, we've got to focus on Starr for goodness sakes! She -- she's got a prom to go to. This is going to be a night she'll remember for the rest of her life, and for goodness sakes, we want those memories to be happy ones, don't we? Come on. Come on!",

        "Starr: I feel special, believe me. Did you guys find me something to wear?",
        "Blair: Well, as you can see, there are a lot of lovely, lovely dresses here in this house, but I don't think any of them are going to be right for you.",

I walk around with this stupid thing on my leg, free as a bird so that a-- my benefactor knows that I didn't do my job and he doesn't have to pay me the $10 million he promised. So I have lost months of my life in this stinkhole -- no offense, it's actually pretty nice -- for nothing.",
