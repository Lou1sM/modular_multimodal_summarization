        "David arranges for Matthew to go out with him and two \"lady friends\" in order to get him over Dani. Yet, Blair confronts David for serving Matthew champagne and Gigi and Rex are able to see that David has hired prostitutes. Meanwhile, Dani appears to be interested in Nate. He convinces her that he needs the ton of money they found in the briefcase for his mom. She returns home to see Todd with her mom after he's convinced Tea that he will not give up and believe she's going to die. Yet they do not tell Dani the news. Jessica privately tells Kelly that she might have been the one to assault Ford. It's possible that she does not remember what happened and Tess or Bess came out when she remembered what Mitch was going to do to her. John notices they are having a secretive conversation and asks Natalie what she might know about it."

        "David: Matthew, I want you to answer a question without thinking. Do you want to be Clint or Asa?",
        "Matthew: That's not fair.",
        "David: Life isn't fair, little brother, but you're a Buchanan. That has its advantages, so you have two choices. You can stay home. You can sit around and start smelling again, or you can come out with me and Wendy and Fawn and watch people Fawn over Fawn and Wendy and me.",
        "Matthew: Which one is Fawn again?",

That's your loss. You want to raise our kid by yourself? Okay. I'll let you do that for a minute, but there's no way I'm gonna stand by while you -- you don't get to die. I won't let you.",

        "Kelly: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate the update. I really do.",
        "John: Yeah. I just want to let you know we didn't forget about you.",

        "Todd: Don't lie about it! I know! I know you have cancer. I know you have a brain tumor. I know. I know it's big. I know that it's -- what do you call it?-a glio -- something.",
        "T\u00e9a: This doesn't help, okay? It's not helping me.",
        "Todd: And seeing that idiot Evans is helping, the one that says this is only gonna end one way -- badly? What are you doing? What is wrong with you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, God --",
        "Todd: What's going on?",

        "Todd: So what are you [words missing]",
        "Todd: And it just went off?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, no, no, no. This is just the warm-up. Ha ha! When it goes off, oh, it's gonna be spectacular.",
        "Todd: Well, what else have you been feeling?",
        "T\u00e9a: Dizzy and nauseous.",
        "Todd: Anything else?",

        "Todd: God, you're not driving, are you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not -- no. I don't drive on the days that I have treatment. I'm not that stupid.",
        "Todd: Well, are they saying that the radiation is helping?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not yet, but Evans wants to keep trying, and he thinks it's gonna maybe shrink the tumor.",
        "Todd: Well, that's something, isn't it? By the way, when is your next appointment?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, listen to me. I'm going with you to your next appointment, so you might as well tell me when it is.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no, no. No. You're not going with me because I would like to do this by myself. It is easier, Todd, okay? It's easier.",
        "Todd: But you're not driving yourself.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh --",
        "Todd: Blair has been taking you, hasn't she?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",

        "Dani: Wait. You're serious?",
        "Nate: I'm just saying, why not, all right? You call the cops, it just sits in an evidence locker or whatever. We each take half, and then it doesn't go to waste.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but --",
        "Nate: But what?",
        "Dani: Well, anybody loses that much money, they're going to come looking for it, and I don't need it.",
        "Nate: What if I do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I should have locked him in a closet, anything to keep him there. She so doesn't need all of that aggravation.",
        "Eli: Think Todd is going to go crazy on her?",
        "Blair: You know what, Elijah? When he's like that, he doesn't stop. He doesn't think. He just acts out.",
        "Eli: Maybe I should go down there.",
        "Blair: No, no, no. T\u00e9a doesn't know that you know.",
        "Eli: I know. I can make, like, work excuse or something.",
        "Blair: No. No, no, no, no. You know what?",
        "Eli: You can't leave.",
        "Blair: Well, that will only set Todd off. Let's just take a deep breath. We'll give it a few minutes, see how this plays out, and I will call her and -- excuse me. David --",
        "David: Blair, are you all right? You look horrible.",
        "Blair: How did Matt get past the bouncer outside?",
        "David: He's with me, and I'm kind of a celebrity.",
        "Blair: Oh, my gosh, you did a hemorrhoid commercial.",
        "David: It was a national commercial.",
        "Blair: What are you up to, David?",
        "David: Well, we've had a little rebound reveille going on tonight. I think we'll take that booth for four right there. Got to get our merry on.",

        "Blair: I don't think so. Excuse us. David --",
        "David: What? Hey, watch it. You know how many silkworms had to die to make this suit?",
        "Blair: Are you aware of the laws in this country?",
        "David: My credit card is good.",
        "Blair: You were just offering your underage little brother champagne.",
        "David: Champagne?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "David: Let me try that one. That's champagne, too. I ordered sparkling cider. Blair, you're champagne is really strong. I tell you what. I'll check on the help. Your help needs help. I'll help the help.",
        "Blair: No. You won't. Play nice, David.",
        "David: Or?",
        "Blair: You'll make me angry, and you just love it when I get angry.",
        "David: I love it when you talk to me like that.",
        "Matthew: No, you didn't.",
        "Wendy: Yes, we did.",

        "Rex: What else?",
        "Gigi: You remembered?",
        "Rex: You didn't?",
        "Gigi: It was my first cocktail. I was so proud. I mixed it myself.",
        "Rex: You got so sick.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I didn't have a recipe.",
        "Rex: That explains a lot.",
        "Gigi: These are probably better. Thanks for remembering.",
        "Rex: I never forgot, even when I wasn't there.",
        "Gigi: Are we going to the arcade next?",
        "Rex: No. No pajama pants for me, no arcade. After this drink, this is a redo. To the new first.",

        "Dani: Why would you need the money?",
        "Nate: I don't. My mom does.",
        "Dani: Why, is your mom in trouble or something?",
        "Nate: You won't get this. Our moms are totally different. With my mom, it's this epic battle just to get the basics. Your mom is this rich lawyer, superwoman. Nothing stops her.",

        "Todd: Here you go.",
        "T\u00e9a: I would've told you.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah? When?",
        "T\u00e9a: When the time was right.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure you would've been on your deathbed saying, \"Oh, you know what? God, I just can't believe this headache. It's terrible.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't want anybody to stop their life for me.",
        "Todd: Even if they can help?",
        "T\u00e9a: You've got your own things to worry about. You have a trial coming up.",
        "Todd: Oh, come on. I'm gonna skate through that. Besides, it doesn't make any difference. Relative to this, it makes no difference.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. It makes a big difference because you can't be in jail. You have to take care of Daniella. That is the most important thing. We have to make things right for her.",
        "Todd: So we do that by not telling her about what you're going through right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Yes. That's right. God, think about it, Todd. Her life in the past year has been one trauma after another. She had to leave Ross, the only father she's ever known. She had come here. She has to hang out with you. She doesn't like you very much. I don't know if you've noticed. Now finally, she's starting to have some fun. She's rehearsing the musical. She's going to her prom. She's doing normal teenage things. That's what I want for her, not for her to worry about me being sick and, you know, all the rest of it.",
        "Todd: Well, that's very sweet. But it has to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.",
