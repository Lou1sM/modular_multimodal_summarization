        "Clint: Viki, I don't see the point of any more tests.",
        "Viki: For heaven's sakes, they need to make sure your body can withstand the transplant.",
        "Clint: I told you before. I am not taking Matthew's heart.",
        "Viki: Fine. Fine. Fine. We're just gonna sit around and wait for the next heart to come along.",
        "Clint: We both know that's not gonna happen. I'm a dead man.",
        "Viki: And you're just ok with that, huh? Clint, our daughter Jessica is in St. Ann's right now trying to heal.",
        "Clint: And God willing, she'll get better.",
        "Viki: We don't know how long it's going to take, do we? Are you seriously telling me that you're just all set, ready to die, knowing you might never, ever see your daughter again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Is the coast clear?",
        "Ford: Looks like it.",
        "Tess: No cops? No men in white coats? No gun-toting, crazed members of Jessica's family?",
        "Ford: Not unless the other residents noticed the two nuns that just checked in.",
        "Tess: Please. The only way they'd notice us if we had some free beer.",
        "Ford: Hey. Listen, we can relax.",
        "Tess: I couldn't agree more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I think I should go.",
        "Natalie: Now?",
        "Brody: Well, I don't have that much to pack and it shouldn't take too long.",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "Brody: You should get some rest.",
        "Natalie: Right. What are we doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're not gonna hit me, are you? I can see that you'd like to hit me. Yeah. You'd like to kill me. Go ahead. But I'll remind you, if you kill me, you'd end up rotting in jail without knowing what I know. Go ahead. Hit me. Kill me. Whatever. You better do it quick, though, before T\u00e9a gets back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: That is enough! That is enough!",
        "Shane: Tell me what you did to my mom, you bastard!",
        "Jack: I'm the bastard? You're the one whose parents never got married.",
        "Shane: They'd be married right now if you didn't do something to my mom!",
        "T\u00e9a: Roxy, get ahold of your grandson. He's gonna hurt someone, all right?",
        "Roxy: Excuse me, T\u00e9a, he has every right to be mad. His mom is missing and it's Jack's fault.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why?",
        "Roxy: Well, if you want to stop someone from getting hurt, why don't you get an answer from your wicked stepson? Come on, you little monster. What'd you do to Gigi?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Morasco! Gigi! What-- Gigi! Gigi, are you ok? Hey! What happened? Can you hear me? Wake up! Wake up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Starr? Hi. How long have you been here?",
        "Starr: Well, I went home to check on Hope, but other than that...",
        "Dani: Has there been any change in Matthew's condition?",
        "Starr: Sorry. I wish I had better news.",
        "Dani: That's ok. I don't know what I was expecting you to say.",
        "Starr: You want Matthew to get better.",
        "Dani: I know some of the doctors are saying that he might not. But it's so hard to actually believe that. I mean, the Matthew I know gets right back up after he's been knocked down. He helped me escape from a boarding school while he was still in a wheelchair.",
        "Starr: I remember.",
        "Dani: He was supposed to be stuck in that wheelchair for the rest of his life, but he fought to have that surgery and he walked. How can that be the same person that these doctors are saying won't ever open his eyes again? That's not Matthew.",
        "Starr: I know. I don't think any of us can accept it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Ok, you little monster, fess up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Roxy, please. We all need to calm down.",
        "Roxy: Calm down? I will calm down when Gigi is here safe and sound.",
        "T\u00e9a: I am sorry to hear that she is missing, and I understand that you must be very anxious, but what does that have to do with Jack?",
        "Jack: It has nothing to do with me. He blames me for every stupid thing that happens to him.",
        "Shane: Because it's your fault!",
        "Jack: My fault? It's my fault your mom ran off? Maybe because she didn't want to be with her crybaby son anymore.",
        "T\u00e9a: In one second, I am gonna call the police. All right?",
        "Shane: Go ahead! Then everyone'll know what he did!",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, Shane, I need you to calm down, ok? Please. Tell me why would Jack want to hurt your mom?",
        "Shane: He didn't want to hurt my mom. He wanted to hurt me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Come on, Gigi. You need to wake up. Tell me what happened, huh? Did you fall or-- aah! There's no signal! Come on, come on. Just one bar. One--oh. What the... oh, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What is the holdup? Come on. This is your chance to kill me, to be a hero. Which is your shtick, of course, I know. Come on. There's nobody here to look at you, nobody here to stop you. You know what you can do? We can say that I got loose and I tried to make a break for it, and you went for your gun and you shot me. It was self-defense. It was self-defense, your honor. Who wouldn't believe you, John? Well, maybe T\u00e9a, but who cares about her? She'd be a grieving widow. To hell with her. You know what? Dorian would give you a medal. But the problem is that if I die, everything I know and everything I can tell you dies with me.",
        "John: Let me tell you something. The only thing I want to hear from you is where Marty went.",
        "Todd's voice: So John is Liam's father.",
        "Todd: You sure about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ok, Gigi. You're gonna be fine. All right? You're gonna wake up. You're gonna be fine. Ok. All right, I'm gonna have to take you to the hospital myself. We don't have time to wait for the ambulance. We're gonna get married. We're gonna live happily ever after. You, me, and Shane. Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Is this really happening?",
        "Brody: Tell me to stop. Tell me to go. I'll walk out that door and this will never happen again if you don't want it to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I've been wanting to do that for a long time.",
        "Tess: Well, maybe I've been sort of looking forward to it as well.",
        "Ford: Yeah? Too bad you never admitted it.",
        "Tess: Yeah. Too bad. I'm so happy Sister Roberta showed up when she did. Those nuns were about to zap Jessica back into the driver's seat.",
        "Ford: I couldn't let them do that. I love you. You don't have to say it back.",
        "Tess: No. I love you, too.",
        "Ford: Kinda weird, isn't it? After not, you know, saying it at all and then after tearing each other apart all that time.",
        "Tess: Yeah. We can get mushy later. Right now we have to figure out how we're gonna get the hell out of Dodge, because as soon as they find Sister Bridget straitjacketed in my cell, they're gonna sound the alarm and Dudley do-right is gonna drop everything and come track us down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Do you want to go?",
        "Brody: I'm just afraid that if we do this, someone's gonna get hurt, and I couldn't bear to hurt you.",
        "Natalie: I don't want to hurt you, either.",
        "Brody: Then the best thing, the safest, the smartest thing is for me to go.",
        "Natalie: Stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I hope you don't mind me hanging around so much. I'd give you a break, but I don't feel like dealing with Starr and Dani right now. Don't get me wrong, they've been great, and they're always there for me, but sometimes-- and you'd probably find this hard to believe, but--I don't want to talk, especially now that they know what we did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: So how's Destiny holding up?",
        "Starr: She's trying really hard to stay strong for Matthew, but she can't keep it up forever.",
        "Dani: Maybe we should get her to take a break or something.",
        "Starr: She better take one soon. She already got sick once today.",
        "Dani: She was sick? When?",
        "Starr: A couple of hours ago.",
        "Dani: Is she all right? Maybe we should take her home.",
        "Starr: No, no. Don't worry about it. She's better now, but-- she said it was because of the cafeteria food, but I had half of the burrito and I'm fine.",
        "Dani: So maybe it's just all this stress she's been under.",
        "Starr: That's what I thought, too.",
        "Dani: So, Dr. Starr, I take it you think it's something else?",
        "Starr: Well, for a minute, I thought it could be morning sickness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Don't go.",
        "Brody: I don't want to, but I think I should.",
        "Natalie: What are we supposed to do, just ignore what we're feeling? That's what we tried to do before and look where we are now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ford. Remind me never, ever to become a nun, because these habits are just not flattering.",
        "Ford: Feeling better?",
        "Tess: Oh. I'm finally feeling like myself again. Thank you so much for snagging my stuff before you broke me out.",
        "Ford: Yeah, well, you know Brody's gonna turn Llanview upside down looking for you, don't you?",
        "Tess: That's why we have to get as much distance between us and that knuckle- dragger as possible.",
        "Ford: Tess...I'm sorry, but I-- can't leave Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Oh, you've got some bedside manner, you know that?",
        "Viki: I am trying to get you to face some truth here.",
        "Clint: I am. Jessica will come back to us in plenty of time. Because she's a miracle. Always has been since the day she was born.",
        "Viki: That's true.",
        "Clint: We didn't even know how lucky we were.",
        "Viki: Also true. We had two miracles.",
        "Clint: After all those years that I was alone, to become a father to Kevin and Joey, to find Cord, and there's my Natalie.",
        "Viki: We've been very blessed.",
        "Clint: We've been blessed with all of our children.",
        "Viki: Even Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Are you sure that all you want to know is about Marty? Because I've got these secrets that...",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Cop: This just came in from 911 dispatch. Thought you'd want to know. Doesn't Gigi Morasco work for you at Rodi's?",
        "John: Used to. What's her condition?",
        "Cop: No word yet.",
        "John: I'll take this. Keep an eye on him.",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. I thought you were gonna beat me up. Aww!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Help, help, help! My fianc\u00e9e's hurt! Help!",
        "Doctor: What happened?",
        "Rex: I found her in a basement 20 minutes ago. There was a generator leaking. I think it was carbon monoxide.",
        "Doctor: How long has she been unconscious?",
        "Rex: I don't know. I just found her like this.",
        "Doctor: Ok. Let's move it.",
        "Rex: Do you know what's wrong with her?",
        "Doctor: No respiratory effort at all. Circumoral cyanosis. Let's tube her now.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Doctor: 100% fl O2 and ABG's with carboxy stat. Get her on a monitor now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: So this girl has been messaging me on MyFace to come meet her, but I know it's really Jack.",
        "Jack: He's lying. And now some loser chick is wondering why comicboy stood her up.",
        "Shane: She's not waiting for me because she doesn't exist. You made up a fake name and tried to lure me into some trap.",
        "Jack: Lure you into a trap? Are you serious?",
        "Shane: Then my mom found out, and she went instead.",
        "Jack: No, he's lying. He tried to jump off the roof at school two months ago. You can't trust him.",
        "Roxy: And whose fault is that, you little liar?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Roxy: Oh, good. It's your dad. Did you find Gigi?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I found her.",
        "Roxy: Oh, good! Ok, well, get your butts over to the courthouse. It's time to get married!",
        "Rex: I can't. We're at the hospital.",
        "Roxy: You're at the hospital? Why?",
        "Rex: It's Gigi. Come, Mom, please. Just come quick.",
        "Roxy: Rex, don't worry. We're on our way. Don't worry! All right. Let's go.",
        "Shane: What's wrong?",
        "Roxy: He found Gigi but they had to go the hospital.",
        "Shane: Is Mom ok?",
        "Roxy: Let's find out.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ok.",
        "Shane: You hurt my mom. I will kill you. You hear me? I will kill you!",
        "Roxy: We have to go. Ok. All right. Let's get out of here.",
        "T\u00e9a: You all right?",
        "Jack: I think the kid's lost it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Has he? Is any of what Shane said true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Rex.",
        "Rex: John. What are you doing here?",
        "John: I saw the dispatch from your 911 call. How's Gigi?",
        "Rex: I don't know. They won't tell me anything yet.",
        "John: All right. Let me see what I can do. Hey, the transcript said you found her trapped in somebody's basement. Do you know the address?",
        "Rex: Yeah, it's--",
        "John: Write it down for me, will you? Thanks. You have any idea how she got stuck down there?",
        "Rex: Ask Jack Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Of course, it's not true. How could you think that? I had nothing to do with whatever happened to Shane's mom.",
        "T\u00e9a: You sure?",
        "Jack: Yes! Why am I always the criminal? He's the one who threatened to kill me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ok, ok. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to you, all right? I won't let it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Look, I'm sorry, ok? I probably shouldn't have told Starr and Dani that we had sex. I wanted it to be our secret, but...Starr found out by accident, and with you in here, I had to talk to somebody. So I talked to Dani. But don't worry--they won't say anything. Besides, I didn't exactly tell them everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: What? Why would you think Destiny's pregnant?",
        "Starr: Because Destiny slept with Matthew. I heard her talking to him and when I asked her about it, she came clean.",
        "Dani: Really?",
        "Starr: Dani, she told me that she told you.",
        "Dani: Starr, you have to promise you're not gonna say anything about that.",
        "Starr: Of course, I'm not going to say anything. I'm worried about Destiny. She needs someone to talk to.",
        "Dani: That's no problem. She can talk to me.",
        "Starr: Make sure that she knows that. But the way things are looking for Matthew, she has enough going on without worrying about having a baby.",
        "Dani: Oh, God. You don't really think--",
        "Starr: Hopefully not. She and Matthew used protection. Obviously, that's not foolproof, but at least it's something.",
        "Dani: Yeah...",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Dani: How do you know that Matthew and Destiny used protection?",
        "Starr: She told me that they did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I know lying is wrong, but in this case, I think it's better for everybody that I didn't tell Starr the truth. Nobody needs to know that we didn't actually use protection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: So let me get this straight. You dress up like a nun, you sneak into the loony bin, you tell me you love me, you break me out to what, cut me loose? What kind of game are you playing here?",
        "Ford: I didn't do all that just to lose you.",
        "Tess: So what's the problem?",
        "Ford: I can't leave Llanview! Not without my son.",
        "Tess: Oh, my God. Again with the kid.",
        "Ford: Listen, I love you, and I love Ryder, and I'm not gonna abandon either one of you.",
        "Tess: So you want me to what? Change diapers? Babysit for you?",
        "Ford: Listen. I know you don't care about Ryder as much as I do. Maybe you don't even care about him at all. But there's no way around this. If you want to be with me, then you have to be with him, too. He and I-- we're a package deal. So I'm asking you, please... stay here and help me fight for my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I honestly don't think Jessica is coming back this time, and even if she did, I don't think we'd make it, but you and John--",
        "Natalie: Are over. Truth is, we've been over for a long time. I just didn't want to admit it, but in the meantime, something has been going on between you and me, and I think I'd like to find out what it is. Look. My dad is dying, and he has all these regrets about what he's done. Now he's completely alone. I don't want to end up like that.",
        "Brody: Neither do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I'm so glad Matthew and Destiny were safe. I was so shocked when she told me they had sex, it never even occurred to me to ask if they were careful.",
        "Starr: Well, when you have a baby at 16, you think about these things. I was just so surprised because I didn't even know that Matthew and Destiny were dating.",
        "Dani: No. That's the thing. They weren't.",
        "Starr: Then--",
        "Dani: They just really care about each other. I mean, what happened between the two of them, it's not like it was casual, but they also didn't plan for it to happen. I guess it just kind of did.",
        "Starr: Well, they may not have planned it, but at least they were prepared for it, but Destiny did not want to talk to me about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Starr got all up in my business asking if we used protection. Like no one ever got sick off a bad burrito before. Just because I puked, every other word out of her mouth was \"pregnant,\" which I am so not. I know she was trying to help, but just because she had one baby doesn't make her an expert, and I know if I told her the truth, that we didn't use anything, I'd never hear the end of it, no matter how wrong she is. And she is wrong because that wouldn't happen, not to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Wait, wait. Last time we did this, we were really drunk.",
        "Natalie: Right. Do you have--",
        "Brody: Yeah, yeah. We're covered.",
        "Natalie: That's not what you were gonna say.",
        "Brody: No. What I was gonna say is, this time, I want to remember every moment. I want to go slowly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You do realize what you're asking me to do. If I stay, they'll hunt me down like an animal, and when they find me--",
        "Ford: They're not gonna find you.",
        "Tess: When they find me, they'll lock me back up.",
        "Ford: Look. I'm not gonna let that happen.",
        "Tess: Really? So you must have a really great plan.",
        "Ford: Ok. I admit I'm kind of winging it right now, ok, but I love you.",
        "Tess: Great. That's a great plan.",
        "Ford: I'm gonna keep you safe!",
        "Tess: Well, what if you can't? If I go back into St. Ann's, the person that comes out will be Jessica.",
        "Ford: Well, she hasn't come back yet. They tried electroshock, and you stayed in control.",
        "Tess: Because of you, because of you. Do you really think that Jessica is still mad at Natalie and Brody? I mean, she's a snotty, little bitch, but even Princess Jessica can't hold a grudge for that long.",
        "Ford: So you've been fighting her off?",
        "Tess: And the reason I'm still here is because of you. It's because-- it's because I love you more than she wants to come back, and if we split, if we part ways, then she's gonna come out and reclaim her stupid life, which doesn't hold a candle to mine, by the way, as long as your zero-fat butt is in it. Really. Eat a donut already. Come on.",
        "Ford: So what does this mean?",
        "Tess: It means that I'm staying. And as for Ryder, if I can learn to love a moron like you, then I guess I can learn to love your little rugrat, too.",
        "Ford: That is the most romantic thing anybody has ever said to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: You got visitors.",
        "Todd: What's the deal? Must be off your game today. I thought I'd be out of here half an hour ago.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, my game is fine, thank you very much. Where's John?",
        "Todd: I have no idea. He said something about Gigi Morasco, took off.",
        "T\u00e9a: What'd he say about Gigi Morasco?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. So what's the deal? Am I out of here, or what?",
        "T\u00e9a: I took our complaint about John's arrest to a judge and demanded your immediate release...",
        "Todd: Fantastic. Let's go.",
        "T\u00e9a: And he turned me down flat.",
        "Todd: What am I paying you for?",
        "T\u00e9a: You're not paying me anything, but, trust me, you will. I'll get you out of here in no time, but right now, we may have a bigger problem.",
        "Todd: Really? Bigger than John accusing me of helping Marty Saybrooke skip town?",
        "T\u00e9a: Depends. Jack?",
        "Jack: I didn't do anything.",
        "Todd: What is he talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I don't want anything to do with Rex Balsom.",
        "Viki: Even now?",
        "Clint: Especially now.",
        "Rex's voice: I've made some mistakes, but my family isn't one of them. Whatever you think of me, your life, whatever is left of it, would've been made better if you had gotten to know Gigi and Shane before it was too late.",
        "Clint: You know, he came to see me today with some trumped-up garbage about wanting to tell me that he's getting married.",
        "Viki: But that's wonderful!",
        "Clint: He probably expected me to react like that. Yeah.",
        "Viki: Clint, how could you begrudge Rex wanting to tell his father that good news?",
        "Clint: Good news?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Clint: No. I don't think so. No. He just found a perfect way to get in good with the old man.",
        "Viki: Oh, that's ridiculous.",
        "Clint: Is it?",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Clint: Probably thinks I've been in here so long that I've gotten sentimental, that if he laid it on thick enough, I'd leave him a bundle.",
        "Viki: That is so not true. My God, that boy was offering himself to you. He's asking you to be part of his life, the life that he shares with the woman he loves and with your grandson. He's inviting you into his family, Clint. If you can't open your eyes and see what a gift that is, then maybe it really is too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: And then I brought her here.",
        "John: Ok. Thanks. I'll be in touch. Hang in there.",
        "Roxy: What is Johnny doing here?",
        "Shane: Where's Mom? Is she ok? What happened?",
        "Rex: We're not sure yet. I'll tell you everything as soon as they tell me.",
        "Shane: Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'd like an answer.",
        "Jack: Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me? I told you, I didn't do anything.",
        "Todd: Ok. Then what didn't you do?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm still a little unclear, but there was some trouble with Shane Morasco.",
        "Todd: Really? I'm sorry. Did we or did we not have a conversation about this already?",
        "T\u00e9a: Shane claims Jack pretended to be a girl online to set him up. Gigi somehow got involved and then disappeared for a while. Rex eventually found her, but now somehow Gigi is in the hospital, and that's all we know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Come on, Shane. Let's sit over here.",
        "Shane: Don't want to sit down. What's wrong with Mom? Is she ok?",
        "Rex: Hey, your mom is gonna be fine, ok? She just got a little hurt.",
        "Roxy: Hurt? How?",
        "Rex: It looks like carbon monoxide poisoning.",
        "Shane: That's bad.",
        "Rex: Hey, this is your mom we're talking about, ok? There's nothing she can't beat.",
        "Roxy: Hell, yeah. How'd this happen?",
        "Rex: John is trying to figure that out right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Hey, Detective, the fire department has cleared the area for inspection.",
        "John: Is this the source of the fumes?",
        "Ray: That's the generator. These old models aren't even licensed anymore, too many malfunctions, very dangerous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: It's gonna be ok, all right? I went to the address that you got on MyFace. I went down to the basement, and the door was wedged shut, and that's where I found your mom. She was unconscious. There was a generator running. I think it was leaking carbon monoxide. Her purse was emptied out. I think she was trying to find something to plug the leak. I tried calling for an ambulance, but I couldn't get a signal. That's when I picked her up and brought her here myself.",
        "Roxy: What's with the raincoat?",
        "Shane: Dad, that's mine.",
        "Rex: Your mom was wearing it when I found her.",
        "Shane: Jack meant it for me.",
        "Rex: Shane--",
        "Shane: The MyFace stuff. He was waiting for me. He must have seen Mom go in. She was wearing my raincoat. He thought he was locking me in there. Don't you get it? Jack tried to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, if you don't mind, I think Jack and I need to have a little talk alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: It's been a while since I've done this with someone that I really care about.",
        "Ford: Well, it's been a while since I've done this at all. Worst 30 seconds of your life, remember?",
        "Tess: Maybe not the worst 30 seconds of my life.",
        "Ford: Well, maybe this time, we can make it to 31. What's wrong?",
        "Tess: The last time we did this, Ryder happened.",
        "Ford: Don't worry. I've got protection.",
        "Tess: Of course, you do. Of course, you do. The Boy Scouts and Robert Ford always come prepared.",
        "Ford: Something else is bothering you. What is it?",
        "Tess: I'm nervous.",
        "Ford: So am I.",
        "Tess: Excuse me? The playboy of Eastern P.A. is nervous?",
        "Ford: Yeah. Well, I don't want to screw this up with you. Why are you nervous?",
        "Tess: Because Bess told me to not even bother trying with you, that it wouldn't last, and Jessica would eventually come out and I'd disappear.",
        "Ford: So if you stay, you disappear, and if you leave, you disappear.",
        "Tess: Damned if I do and damned if I don't.",
        "Ford: Well, if you're gonna be damned, might as well be damned with me.",
        "Tess: Mm. Whoop! Ha ha ha! Waah! Ha ha ha!",
        "Woman: It's time to fly full moon delight my love, arise and touch me tonight this love feels so fine this love feels so nice",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I'll go see if I can lean on another judge to try to get you out of here.",
        "Jack: Dad, I swear, I didn't do anything. This Morasco kid is--",
        "Todd: Shut up. Shut up! I'm gonna ask you a question. You're gonna answer me, and you're gonna tell me the truth. Look at me. You lie to me, I'm gonna know about it, Jack, and these handcuffs will not prevent me from making you face the consequences. Do you understand what I'm saying? Ok. Take a deep breath. Did you set up Shane Morasco?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: My God.",
        "Rex: We're not gonna worry about Jack right now.",
        "Shane: But look at what happened to Mom because of me.",
        "Rex: Hey, hey, hey, this is not your fault. Do you understand me?",
        "Roxy: You don't go blaming yourself for something that weasel Jack Manning did.",
        "Shane: But Mom never would have gotten there if I hadn't been messaging Jack.",
        "Rex: Ok, ok. This is what we're gonna do. Your doctor has late office hours, right? Ok. Good. Your grandma is gonna take you upstairs to talk with your doctor.",
        "Shane: You're sending me away?",
        "Rex: No. I just think that you need to talk with somebody who can calm you down, ok? We need to be cool for your mom.",
        "Shane: No. What if something happens?",
        "Rex: Nothing is gonna happen to her while you're gone, I promise. They're not even gonna let us in to see her, anyway, but when they do, we need to be ready. I need you to be ready, ok?",
        "Shane: Fine.",
        "Roxy: Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Roxy: I'm here for you, baby. You remember that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ray? Ray: Mm-hmm?",
        "John: Dust for prints on the door. Someone locked Gigi in here. Want to know who it was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm waiting, Jack. Hey! Is what Shane Morasco said true? Did you set a trap for him?",
        "Jack: Yes! I did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Mr. Balsom?",
        "Rex: Hey, Doc, how is she? Is she awake yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: How long are you gonna keep staring at me like that?",
        "Viki: Till you say the right thing.",
        "Clint: I thought I was going in for more tests. What happened to those damn orderlies?",
        "Viki: Clint, Clint, Clint, Clint, you think you have nothing left to say to Rex.",
        "Clint: I don't. I've said everything I have to say, and if the boy comes around and shows his face again, all he'll hear from me is, \"Get out.\"",
        "Viki: You know what? I'm gonna go find those orderlies, because if I stay here, I'm gonna say something that I really won't regret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Something tells me she's not coming out of there anytime soon.",
        "Starr: Something tells me that you are right. Why don't we go and get some nachos and flan at the Buenos Dias, ok?",
        "Dani: Mm-hmm.",
        "Starr: Let Destiny have her time with Matthew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Ok. I'm done whining, promise. I'm not here to unload on you. I'm here to help you get better. Your parents and me, we don't care what anyone says. We know you can do it. Listen to me, Matthew. No one-- no one is giving up on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So how long is she gonna be stuck here? She's gonna want to get home soon.",
        "Doctor: I'm afraid that won't be possible.",
        "Rex: Ok. So she'll be here a little longer, but she's ok, right?",
        "Doctor: I'm very sorry, Mr. Balsom. We did everything we could, but we were too late."
