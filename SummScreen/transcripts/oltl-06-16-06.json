        "Blair is in the morgue over Margaret's body. Suddenly Margaret grabs her wrists and taunts her for sleeping with the man who tried to kill her husband. Blair starts screaming and doesn't stop. Everywhere that she turns, Margaret is there. Finally, Blair makes it to the door and when she opens it, Spencer is there. He wonders what is wrong. She says that the morgue was just creeping her out. Jessica is to go to the appointment that day to see the tape. She worries so. When alone, she begs Tess not to interfere and to let her watch the tape and deal with it on her own. Antonio assures her that he will be with her every step of the way. She turns to him suddenly. \"I have made a decision. I will not watch it. Not today, not ever!\" Adrianna gets the paper in front of Rex's door and finds a gift-wrapped box there. It is from the stalker. She wants to open it although Rex worries that there could be a bomb in there. They find a note inside. \"Fly carefully Butterfly as your wings are delicate'. Rex wants her to stay inside and tell her mother but she won't do that. She has a shoot to go to and she will not miss it. Blair sees Kelly alone at a table and she rushes over to talk to her while Spencer waits. \"What are you doing with him?\" Kelly asks. Blair says that Todd will have nothing to do with her and he wants her out of his life. Besides I am not really with Spencer,\" she hisses. \"What?\" Kelly asks. \"Shhh! Nevermind.\" Blair says. \"Everything okay over here?\" Spencer asks leaning over the ladies as they sit. The man from Kentucky arrives looking for the DA. Hugh and John take the lieutenant and seat him at John's desk. They show him a picture of Spencer. \"Is this the man who took the bodies?\" The man puts his glasses on. \"No, that isn't him.\" He looks across the room. He points. \"It's that guy over there!\" Bo and Hugh turn to see that the man is pointing to Bo."

        "Officer: Looks like Natalie's popular today. I wonder who left them.",
        "John: Search me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Yeah, I checked the reservation book, but everybody on the list was legit. No, I'm pretty sure the guy was at Capricorn last night. Yeah, just let me know if you find anyone who might've spotted someone suspicious. Thanks.",
        "Adriana: Hey.",
        "Rex: Hey. You sleep all right?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. I would've slept better if you hadn't insisted on sleeping on the sofa.",
        "Rex: You need your rest. So you're not scared anymore?",
        "Adriana: I am, but not right now. Not when I'm with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You know, we don't have to do this today if you're not ready.",
        "Jessica: I don't know how ready I -- I don't really have a choice. I have to face what's on that tape. It's the only way I'm going to get well.",
        "Antonio: Ok. All right. Well, I'm going to be here by your side the entire time, all right, and everything's going to be ok.",
        "Jessica: Aw, hey, sweetie.",
        "Antonio: Hey, why don't I put her down, ok?",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Antonio: I'll be right back. All right.",
        "Jessica: I know you're watching, Tess. And I know you know what I'm about to do. Please don't interfere, not today. Just let me do what I have to do. Let me watch the tape.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What do you want?",
        "Hugh: I thought you might like something to read. I brought some magazines. I didn't know what else to bring.",
        "Todd: I've got this book here to read.",
        "Hugh: Mandela -- innocent man, ended up in prison.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you have a keen eye for the obvious.",
        "Hugh: I just wanted to look you in the eye. I should never have gone after you the way I did. You almost died because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margaret: You think I won't shoot you? Now, who is the one who's insane? And now you get over there --",
        "Blair: Margaret! Where are we going?",
        "Margaret: You'll see.",
        "Blair: You crazy bitch.",
        "Margaret: What did you just call me?",
        "Blair: Let go of me!",
        "Margaret: I don't understand why you're so angry. We both know what happened to Todd is all your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "John: Huh?",
        "Natalie: These are beautiful.",
        "John: Oh. You're -- you're assuming they were from me.",
        "Natalie: They're not?",
        "John: Look, I'm -- I'm not saying anything.",
        "Natalie: Well, whoever sent them, it was a very romantic thing to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: We need to talk about what happened at Capricorn last night.",
        "Adriana: No. I don't even want to think about it.",
        "Rex: I get that, but this guy is obviously not giving up.",
        "Adriana: Oh, really? What was your first clue, the text message, or the creepy serenade? I feel like I'm being watched all the time.",
        "Rex: I know you don't want to hear this, but I really think it's about time you told your mother what's going on. I get why you don't want her to know.",
        "Adriana: She would make my life a living hell, Rex. Ok? I don't want to let this guy run my life. If I tell my mother, I'll be a prisoner in my own home.",
        "Rex: Ok. Fine. We'll do it your way for now, but one more incident --",
        "Adriana: Thank you.",
        "Rex: How about breakfast in bed?",
        "Adriana: Should we order from the diner?",
        "Rex: I'm going to cook it from scratch in my own kitchen.",
        "Adriana: Since when do you cook?",
        "Rex: You don't know everything. I'm a man of many talents.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Rex: Mysterious, layered --",
        "Adriana: Full of it.",
        "Rex: I hope you're hungry. Ahem.",
        "Adriana: Ok, ok, first of all, the toast goes in last. And as for the eggs, only the yolks and the whites go in the bowl. The shells go in the trash.",
        "Rex: Ok. Duly noted. Now, go. Relax, read the paper, while I work my magic.",
        "Adriana: Promise you won't burn down the building.",
        "Rex: Then we'll go to the diner. Go. Paper should be right outside the door. I got this, Adriana.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So this tech that Bo hooked you up with -- it was worth the trip?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, especially the field work. I mean, I learned so much, you wouldn't believe it. I got to shadow the team at a homicide, I got to follow the evidence all the way back to the lab. I mean, it was fascinating. I can't wait till I'm finally out on my own.",
        "John: I bet.",
        "Natalie: So, enough about my career. I want to know who sent those flowers.",
        "John: Uh -- you better dust for prints, then.",
        "Natalie: So what's -- what's been going on here? Did David Vickers admit that he shot your father?",
        "John: He's still saying he's innocent.",
        "Natalie: Well, I heard about Margaret. She say anything before she died?",
        "John: No. Apparently, she just started remembering something, then -- either Truman's the luckiest son of a bitch on the planet or somehow he had something to do with that van going off the road. I don't know any more.",
        "Natalie: Wow. You just can't catch a break with this.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Natalie: But you'll get him. I mean, Truman's going to screw up sooner or later.",
        "John: Well, there's been other complications.",
        "Natalie: What complications?",
        "John: New evidence. And, as usual, it's inaccurate, but it does implicate someone else in Manning's cover-up.",
        "Natalie: Who?",
        "John: Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I don't understand how such a thing could've happened. Obviously, it's a terrible mistake, right?",
        "Clint: Or somebody's trying to set you up.",
        "Bo: I'll do everything I can to get to the bottom of it and, once and for all, we'll find out who set Todd up.",
        "Viki: Well, we know you'll do that. But in the meantime, it must be making your job here a little difficult.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, but we -- you didn't come to talk about my problems. You came to pick this up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Antonio: What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: Just talking to Tess.",
        "Antonio: She was here?",
        "Jessica: No, but I can feel her. And I know that she thinks that I can't handle what's on that tape.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, but you know what? It doesn't matter what she thinks, ok? Just remember, Jess, it's a matter of survival for her.",
        "Jessica: No, maybe not just for her. I'm so scared, Antonio. What if I can't handle it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Let go of me!",
        "Margaret: You have his blood on your hands!",
        "Blair: No, it's not true!",
        "Margaret: Todd would never kill a child --",
        "Blair: Oh!",
        "Margaret: But you -- you evil, disloyal shrew -- you condemned him. Made love to Spencer while Todd rotted away on death row, counting down the minutes, preparing himself to die, saying goodbye to his children.",
        "Blair: No, it wasn't my fault, it was Spencer's!",
        "Margaret: You were in bed with him, lady. So stupid --",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Margaret: Letting Spencer slither into your life, your home, your family. I may be crazy, but I was never that dumb. Hmm. Blair and Spencer sitting in a tree",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Margaret: K-I",
        "Blair: It won't like that!",
        "Margaret: You had your legs wrapped around the man who tried to execute your husband. Oh, how did that feel, Blair? Did it feel good?",
        "Blair: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Oh, God -- oh, God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Hi.",
        "Kelly: Sorry I'm late.",
        "Dorian: Kelly, what's with that outfit? You look awful.",
        "Kelly: Thanks, Dorian. That's just what a girl likes to hear first thing in the morning.",
        "Dorian: Well, I'm sorry, but it happens to be the truth. What happened? Kimi says that you spent last night in your old room.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. Is that a problem?",
        "Dorian: No, of course not, darling. You know you're welcome to come home anytime you want, but why didn't you go back to the carriage house?",
        "Kelly: I did.",
        "Dorian: Oh -- and Kevin was there. Viki threw you out.",
        "Kelly: No. Dorian, I really don't want to talk about this.",
        "Dorian: Right. But you know it's not good for you to keep things bottled up inside. You sure you don't want to talk about it? Hmm?",
        "Kelly: Actually, I just want to look at the menu. I'm starving for breakfast. I haven't had anything but hospital food in I don't even know how long.",
        "Dorian: I repeat, are you sure you don't want to talk about it?",
        "Kelly: All right, let's talk. I went to the carriage house, I found all of my stuff in boxes on the front step. I walked in, found Kevin, we had a big fight -- big shocker. He kicked me out of the carriage house and his life.",
        "Dorian: He had no right to kick you out of your own home.",
        "Kelly: Oh, but he does, because it's Viki's home. And by the way, I'm also unemployed, because he fired me from B.E.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's going too far. You -- you're a major asset for that company.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I thought so, too, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised because, after all, I did sleep with his son.",
        "Dorian: Because Kevin drove you to it. It's nobody's fault but his that you're -- in this condition.",
        "Kelly: What condition? What are you talking about?",
        "Dorian: Darling, I know about the pregnancy test.",
        "Kelly: Oh, great.",
        "Dorian: Are you pregnant with Duke's child?",
        "Kelly: This is so none of your business.",
        "Dorian: Oh, but it is my business. You're my niece and I love you very, very much. But I've also gotten very close with Clint. Now, how am I going to explain to him that my niece, his ex-daughter-in-law, is now pregnant with his great-grandchild?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Sick bastard. Every time I think of what he did to Jessie, I want to strangle him. He doesn't deserve to live.",
        "Bo: Rest assured, though, Norman Leeds will be prosecuted. Unfortunately, at his age, we don't know if he'll live long enough.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: Oh, hi.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart.",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "Viki: How are you?",
        "Natalie: Good to see you, Dad.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Natalie: I -- John told me about the bogus evidence that turned up. Is that why you guys are here?",
        "Clint: Uh -- no, that's not exactly the reason.",
        "Natalie: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Are the forensics back on the Forrest investigation?",
        "Officer: Not yet. I'll give them a call and see if I can get an E.T.A.",
        "John: Ok, thanks.",
        "Claudia: Excuse me.",
        "John: Hmm?",
        "Claudia: Um -- I've been sitting here in the station for hours. I'd like to know why I'm being forced to hang around. I mean, I was accosted by two neanderthals at the airport last night. But for some reason, I am being treated like the criminal. I mean, how many times do I have to repeat my story before you people finally get it?",
        "John: It would seem as many times as it takes for you to start telling the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hugh: I don't know what to say, except how truly sorry I am. I made a mistake. I let the case get personal and I lost perspective.",
        "Todd: So you chase me through the woods with a gun?",
        "Hugh: The baby got to me. I did it for justice for him, I guess.",
        "Todd: And I want justice for him, too, but --",
        "Hugh: I hope he's out there, Todd. I hope he's out there and I hope we find him. Look, I know an apology doesn't make up for what I did, but I promise you this -- I will find out who set you up and why.",
        "Todd: I already know all that.",
        "Hugh: If you're talking about Spencer Truman, the police are already looking at him. If he was behind you getting framed up, I'll do everything in my power to see that he doesn't get away with it.",
        "Todd: It's too late, he already has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Are you all right?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Spencer: What were you doing down here?",
        "Blair: I just wanted to see Margaret to see if she was really dead.",
        "Spencer: Well, I understand that, but you're not supposed to be down here without proper authorization.",
        "Blair: I -- I didn't touch anything, ok?",
        "Spencer: Well, what's got you so jumpy? What are you screaming about?",
        "Blair: It's just -- I -- I -- it's -- I mean, in the morgue. It -- it spooked me, and then I ran into you. It's a natural reflex, that's all.",
        "Spencer: You sure that's all it is?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I -- I don't spend a lot of time in the morgue.",
        "Spencer: Because you've been just a little distant with me lately, and even last night when we were -- you know, you were kind of distant.",
        "Blair: Margaret tortured me. And now that she could help me, she's -- she's dead. Just the mention of her name upsets me.",
        "Spencer: All right, let's get you out of here. You look like you could use some breakfast, all right? Palace ok?",
        "Blair: Yeah, that'd be nice. Yeah, that'd be great.",
        "Spencer: I got to go in here and just look around, make sure nothing's out of place. I don't want anybody accusing me of tampering with the body, now, do I?",
        "Blair: Ok. Ok.",
        "Spencer: Margaret. It was not supposed to be this way. It really wasn't. I didn't want you dead, you know, just out of the way. Well, at least I still have Blair, and I intend to keep it that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Should I open it?",
        "Rex: No, I think we should leave it and get the hell out of here. What if it's a bomb?",
        "Adriana: You know what? I'm sick of letting this creep get to me.",
        "Rex: Adriana, wait, I don't think --",
        "Adriana: I don't care, Rex, ok? I am through being scared and sitting around waiting for this guy to make his next move. I have to do something.",
        "Rex: There's a note in the box.",
        "Adriana: Read it.",
        "Rex: \"Spread your wings, butterfly. But carefully. Your wings are delicate.\" Well, I'm taking this straight to the cops.",
        "Adriana: I can't.",
        "Rex: Why not?",
        "Adriana: Because I have a photo shoot at the palace in less than an hour.",
        "Rex: This dude is threatening your life. He's obviously watching your every move. Don't you think maybe you should skip it?",
        "Adriana: No. I'm not going to stop living my life.",
        "Rex: Do you want to have a life? Because this guy is not giving up.",
        "Adriana: I have to go to work, Rex. I'm not some supermodel diva that can just skip out on a job.",
        "Rex: Fine. But I'm going with you. And we're taking this thing to the station on the way. Here, let me put it back in the box.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Now, Kelly, we've got to come up with some kind of a plan, ok? We can't announce this to the whole world, that you're -- you're pregnant with Duke Buchanan's baby.",
        "Kelly: Dorian, take a deep breath -- I'm not pregnant.",
        "Dorian: You're not?",
        "Kelly: Nope.",
        "Dorian: Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?",
        "Kelly: Because you wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Fine. Ok. Yeah, well -- ok, I know how much that you want to have a baby of your own, but -- oh, thank goodness. I mean, really. For you to have had Duke Buchanan's baby -- that would have been a scandal of epic proportion, and not just for you, sweetheart, but for our entire fami--",
        "Dorian: Ly. Are you feeling all right?",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I'll be fine as soon as I get something to eat.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Well, I'll go powder my nose, and -- and I'll find the waiter and ask him to hurry things along.",
        "Kelly: Great. Thank you. Take your time.",
        "Dorian: Ok.",
        "Kelly: Please. Take your time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: You know what? I think I've changed my mind.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Spencer: I don't want to wait for a table. No, let's go upstairs and order room service. How about that? We can go upstairs, we can get out of these old clothes, you know, order some nice food, take a little time, relax. I -- I don't know about you, but I could really use a little downtime. What do you say?",
        "Blair: Oh -- there's my cousin Kelly. She's just out of the hospital. I'm going to go see how she's doing. Kelly. Hey!",
        "Blair: How are you?",
        "Kelly: Fine, considering. Um -- I heard about Margaret. That's unbelievable.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Tell me about it.",
        "Kelly: So --",
        "Blair: Hmm?",
        "Kelly: Are you here with Spencer?",
        "Blair: Yeah. So?",
        "Kelly: Well, I just thought that now that you know that Todd is innocent and that he's going to be ok, that you would stop seeing Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: How dare you accuse me of lying. Those men assaulted me!",
        "John: Well, they told me a different story, lady. I made some calls. They work for your father. He sent them to keep an eye on you.",
        "Claudia: So? What difference does that make?",
        "John: Well, the difference is someone's playing games here, and I don't like people wasting taxpayer resources.",
        "Claudia: I was assaulted at the airport. It doesn't matter who did it. It's a crime, and it is your job to investigate it.",
        "John: Look, lady, I'm trying to be understanding here. Obviously, you have some issues with your father. You want to pursue it, that's fine, but you're going to be facing some serious charges of your own, like filing a false police report.",
        "Claudia: I -- I don't believe this! I did absolutely nothing wrong! I stand by my statement.",
        "John: Then it's your call.",
        "Claudia: All right, just forget the whole thing, ok? God, I'm out of here. I stayed up all night for this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Good luck today, and give Jess my love.",
        "Clint: Thank you.",
        "Natalie: Um -- could you guys just wait for me one minute? I'll be right back.",
        "Viki: Sure, honey.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. Hey.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "John: Everything ok?",
        "Natalie: Brenda's going to cover my shift -- yeah. It's just -- it's Jess. She's going through some stuff and needs her family right now.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "Natalie: So I'll see you later?",
        "John: Yeah, sure.",
        "Natalie: Hey -- thank you for the roses.",
        "Viki: I have to tell you I'm so afraid of what seeing this tape is going to do to Jessie.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Viki, we just have to let her do this, and then pray it's the beginning of the end. This tape could make our little girl whole again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I checked on the baby, she's sleeping like an angel. How you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm terrified. Whatever is on that tape, I've been burying it my entire life. Maybe it won't even do any good to watch it now. Maybe, you know, instead of helping me get better, it's just going to destroy me and break me into a million pieces.",
        "Antonio: I won't let that happen.",
        "Jessica: You're not in my head, Antonio. You won't be able to stop it.",
        "Antonio: You're a lot stronger than you think. You can do this, Jess, I know you can. I'll be right there with you.",
        "Jessica: Thank you. You've been so great to me throughout this entire time.",
        "Antonio: All I did was love you. That's easy.",
        "Jessica: Well, then you'll understand. I've made a decision. I'm not going to watch that tape. I'm not going to watch it today, not ever.",
        "Antonio: You know, Dr. Crosby and your parents are going to be here any minute. I thought we agreed that the only way you were going to get well is to face what happened to you. I know you're scared, honey. So am I, all right? But it's the only way to get rid of Tess. It's the only way to get your life back.",
        "Jessica: No. What makes you think that I can handle it any better now than I -- than I did back then? I mean, Tess could come back. She has Brennan to live for now, and even if Tess doesn't come out, I can have a total meltdown. Who's going to raise Brennan if her mom is a basket case?",
        "Antonio: Why don't you think about your little girl. Ok? She'll make you strong. And you're not going to be alone -- Dr. Crosby will be here, I will be here, your family. You're going to get through this. I have faith in you.",
        "Jessica: Ok, well, if something does happen and i don't come back, can you just -- can you just tell Brennan that I love her? Tell her that every day.",
        "Antonio: You can tell her that yourself.",

        "Blair: Why would I stop seeing Spencer? We've been going out for months now.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, but that's when you thought Todd was a murderer.",
        "Blair: So?",
        "Kelly: So everything's changed now. I mean, Spencer's a nice guy -- don't get me wrong -- but Todd is innocent and you know that, and he is the love of your life. Come on, don't tell me there's not a chance you guys are getting back together.",
        "Blair: Todd hates me.",
        "Kelly: Oh, please. You don't really believe that?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I believe it. I went to Todd and asked him to forgive me.",
        "Kelly: And?",
        "Blair: And he told me that he doesn't want to see me anymore. He doesn't want anything to do with me.",
        "Kelly: Well, he just needs some time. I mean, after all he's been through, -- and now see you with Spencer, that's g to be really hard for him. But he loves you. I have no doubt about that.",
        "Blair: Look, I'm -- I'm not really with Spencer. I'm only with him to -- never mind.",
        "Kelly: What? No, no, no. What do you mean by that?",
        "Blair: I don't even know what I'm saying.",
        "Kelly: You said you're not really with Spencer.",
        "Blair: No, I didn't mean anything by it.",
        "Kelly: Blair, if something is going on, tell me.",
        "Blair: Listen, I'm just confused right now. Just drop it, ok? Drop it. What's with that outfit, anyway?",
        "Spencer: Hey, everything all right, ladies?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hugh: I need to get back to the office. I just want to say one more time how truly sorry I am for everything that happened. It's probably too much to ask, but I hope that someday you might be able to forgive me.",
        "Todd: Come here. You go to hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: I said, is there something wrong?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, Spencer, there is. I mean, look at Kelly -- she just got out of the hospital and she's -- she's tired. She's -- what is that outfit?",
        "Kelly: Ugh.",
        "Blair: She's usually all perky. You're tired, Kelly. You shouldn't be out and about town.",
        "Kelly: I'm fine.",
        "Spencer: No, wait a minute, I don't see anything wrong with her getting out a little bit --",
        "Blair: Spencer --",
        "Spencer: As long as she's taking it easy. No, it's fine with me.",
        "Blair: She --",
        "Spencer: Just you have to make sure you listen to your body, that's all.",
        "Kelly: Thank you. Thank you.",

        "Claudia: Hi, Nash. So I finally managed to ditch Daddy's thugs, but I'm afraid it was only a temporary reprieve. I'll be out there as soon as I can, ok? I'll call you from the plane. Oh, hi! I met you at Capricorn last night -- Claudia Reston.",
        "Rex: Rex Balsom. You remember Adriana Cramer.",
        "Adriana: Nice to see you again.",
        "Claudia: Yeah, you, too. You were asking me about that song I dedicated \"to my butterfly\"? What was the deal with that, anyway?",
        "Rex: Whoever requested that song has been giving Adriana a lot of attention lately -- unwanted attention.",
        "Claudia: You mean like stalker attention?",
        "Adriana: I'm afraid so.",
        "Claudia: Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I wish that -- um -- I knew more about who, you know, requested it, but, like I said, they just left a note. I have no idea who it was.",
        "Rex: Yeah, it's ok. I'm a private investigator.",
        "Claudia: Oh.",
        "Rex: I have a lot of contacts. We'll get a lead on the guy sometime.",
        "Claudia: Gosh, I -- I hope so. I would be terrified all the time if I thought I had a stalker.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me, but who has a stalker? Well? Is someone going to tell me what's going on?",
        "Adriana: Nothing's going on.",
        "Dorian: I'm your mother. Adriana, I need to know if you're being stalked.",
        "Adriana: Nobody's stalking anyone, ok? We were just talking hypothetically.",
        "Claudia: That's right.",
        "Dorian: And you would be?",
        "Claudia: Claudia Reston. I just moved to town. I sing at Capricorn one night a week. You must be Adriana's mom.",
        "Dorian: Yes. Mrs. Dorian Lord.",
        "Claudia: Oh. Well, don't worry, Mrs. Lord. Um -- we were just chatting about the dangers of being in the public eye.",
        "Kelly: I have to go. I have to get my stitches out.",
        "Dorian: Oh, let me drive you.",
        "Kelly: No.",
        "Dorian: I insist.",
        "Kelly: It's not necessary.",
        "Dorian: We're going to leave your car here. We'll send somebody to pick it up, because that's the only way I can make sure you're staying put.",

        "John: It was Truman no matter what the papers say.",
        "Bo: I just wish I could talk to Paige. Because if Vickers is telling the truth, Paige saw Margaret Cochran when Margaret was supposedly dead.",
        "John: You want to check in with the hospital?",
        "Bo: Yeah, it couldn't hurt. You know, I know that she wants to tell us something, and maybe if I'm there, then it'll give her a reason to wake up.",

        "Spencer: Wait a minute, wait a minute, they know what they're doing. I told them to just put the tray inside the door. They know how to keep it warm, and in the meantime, I'm going to do the same thing for you.",

        "Kelly: I shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but you did, so you better explain it.",
