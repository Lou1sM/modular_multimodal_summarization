        "After Marcie has given baby Hope back to Starr and assured her she is ok without the baby, the first thing Starr wants to do is call Cole to tell him the joyous news. Unknown to her, however, Cole is getting arrested for the misunderstanding when the cop caught him with the drugs that Asher gave him for free and put in his pocket. He does not want to tell her that he will have to spend the night in jail nor will he be able to call her without his phone. And not having a clue where he is, she demands that he comes to the house in person. He still is unaware that they get to keep their baby when he gets escorted to jail. Michael informs Marcie that he has a job offer in Seattle. After Todd has subpoenaed Tea in order to help his custody case, she is furious at him and tells him she could be disbarred after what he did. But he promises to help her with \"damage control\" and lets her stay at his home while she's recovering from her injury."

        "Todd: Ah!",
        "T\u00e9a: Not so fast.",
        "Todd: What are you doing? You could have broken my leg.",
        "T\u00e9a: I should be so lucky, you pathological creep.",
        "Todd: Oh, God, it's not that big a deal.",
        "T\u00e9a: You just destroyed my career.",
        "Todd: You are so over the top. It's unbelievable.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, really? Fraud plus breach of ethics equals disbarment. You do the math, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Solve for y. 2x+y over 7 equals 2. You trying to scare the book into spitting out the answer?",
        "Matthew: Does that work?",
        "Destiny: You have to pass your math final tomorrow or you flunk. You just did a problem like this.",
        "Matthew: I can't concentrate on this right now.",
        "Destiny: Why not?",
        "Matthew: My friend Starr just found out her baby's alive, and my cousin had her the whole time. And Jessica, my cousin, freaked out and ran off with the baby.",
        "Destiny: But now everything's okay, and she's back. Solve for Y.",
        "Matthew: My mom's getting married again.",
        "Destiny: Oh, that's cool. Your mom and dad back together?",
        "Matthew: No, she's marrying my Uncle Clint.",
        "Destiny: Your dad's brother? For real? But I've seen your mom and dad together.",
        "Matthew: Yeah.",
        "Destiny: They seem so --",
        "Matthew: Yeah. That's what I thought, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I'm sure the defense is going to be asking for discovery this week, so I'm going to need all the case notes on -- from Dombroski and Bova, I guess the name is. Yeah.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: And the preliminary's in two weeks, which is good, because it probably means it will be over before Clint and I get married the week after that. And then on the docket two weeks after that is the Gertson case. Do we have all the forensics on that file? Hello? Bo? Hello?",
        "Bo: I'm sorry. You know what? I just hit a little speed bump out there right at, uh, \"Clint and I get married in\" --",
        "Nora: Oh --",
        "Bo: No, in what? A month?",
        "Nora: Uh, yeah, we moved it up.",
        "Bo: That's soon.",
        "Nora: Well, is there any reason we should wait?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Cole.",
        "Cole: Mom.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God. Are you okay?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "John: What happened?",
        "Cole: I got arrested.",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "Cole: Because I was holding drugs. I -- I -- I know how this is going to sound, but I swear they weren't mine. Mom, please tell me you believe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: She's mine, Mom.",
        "Blair: But Marcie --",
        "Starr: Marcie brought her home to me.",
        "Blair: So you could baby-sit?",
        "Starr: I have my baby back. Forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: It's done? You all right?",
        "Marcie: I will be, I guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look, Mom, I understand why you wouldn't believe me. I mean, I lied about using before.",
        "Marty: Does my son have to be handcuffed?",
        "Officer: It's procedure, ma'am.",
        "John: Hey look, Bova, the kid's not going anywhere, all right? You got my word.",
        "Officer: Okay.",
        "Marty: Thank you. Now, honey, tell me. What happened?",
        "Cole: I was a little freaked -- freaked out after graduation, so I took off. I -- I told you that.",
        "Marty: Right.",
        "Cole: And I went down to the docks to clear my head and get some air. I ran into Asher there.",
        "Marty: Who?",
        "John: The kid who deals at school. How's that little weasel out on the street?",
        "Cole: His dad's lawyer got him off. Now he's back in business.",
        "John: How'd you end up with drugs, Cole?",
        "Cole: He gave them to me. Yeah -- I know. I -- I didn't buy, but I took them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You're getting married in a month? You just told Matthew that you're engaged.",
        "Nora: Well, it's not like Clint's a stranger.",
        "Bo: No, but, you know, I'm just surprised that he would agree to move it up. You know, I mean -- you know, he's got every -- all this going on. He's got, uh, Jessica, the baby.",
        "Nora: Well, actually, it was his idea.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "Nora: I mean, if it would have been up to me \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I must sound like a little baby who want mommy and daddy back together.",
        "Destiny: Not to me.",
        "Matthew: I'm used to my parents being apart. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love my Uncle Clint. It's just, after my accident, I thought something was happening.",
        "Destiny: Like the way your mom and dad look at each other.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, right? See, I'm not making it up.",
        "Destiny: No, there's something. I saw it.",
        "Matthew: And they're together all the time now, but I guess it's just because they have a son who's in a wheelchair and they're nervous.",
        "Destiny: And you hate that.",
        "Matthew: Truth? It drives me crazy. I mean, someone's always watching me. And I'm always going to be right where they left me off, you know? I just -- I just feel like I'll never be able to get away with anything again in my life.",
        "Destiny: You want to knock over a liquor store or something?",
        "Matthew: Oh, yeah. I'd make a great thief, right? Don't worry, he won't get too far. Please laugh.",
        "Destiny: If that's your act, it needs work.",
        "Matthew: I need to think of new wheelchair jokes. I mean, I'm here for life.",
        "Destiny: Maybe not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Did you hear back from your brother?",
        "Shaun: Not a word.",
        "Rachel: I thought he was coming into town.",
        "Shaun: Destiny thinks he's coming into town, but I know better. There's nothing in Llanview that he wants and the only person that my brother cares about is himself.",
        "Rachel: Then he is definitely the odd man out in your family.",
        "Shaun: The rest of us are real sweet, aren't we?",
        "Rachel: You are. Thanks again for seeing me home.",
        "Shaun: It's my pleasure, especially since I don't have anyplace else that I have to be.",
        "Rachel: I don't really think that Dorian fired you. She looked not serious to me.",
        "Shaun: You mean that she looked hammered and out of her mind.",
        "Rachel: Yeah. That, too. Dorian's going to wake up tomorrow and realize that she has nobody to bark orders at.",
        "Shaun: I think that she'll be madder than hell with her heart broken and her pride hurt.",
        "Rachel: Then maybe you'd prefer some time off.",
        "Shaun: Maybe. It's always smart to stay clear of a woman who's been betrayed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You taped a private conversation between us and used it against me in court.",
        "Todd: Not against you, against Blair.",
        "T\u00e9a: That doesn't make it okay.",
        "Todd: Listen, I didn't want to. I just didn't think that Marty was going to cover for John and Blair. And I needed to prove that their marriage was bogus. I was cornered, I'm sorry.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ah, where to start. Wait -- you didn't, uh, mean to record me? It just happened?",
        "Todd: No, I tape everything at the house now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your entire house is wired for sound?",
        "Todd: Yeah. When the police started harassing me, I figured it was a good idea to record everything. Just in case.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you conveniently had that tape on you in court?",
        "Todd: No, no, no. No. When things went south for me, I had you subpoenaed and then I had a messenger go get the tape.",
        "T\u00e9a: You set me up.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, listen to me. This is all going to blow over.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, it's going to blow like a hurricane through the only part of my life that I thought I had to go back to.",
        "Todd: Come on, I'll take you home.",
        "T\u00e9a: What? You know what? It's just occurring to me now. You used me.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "T\u00e9a: That is why you wanted me to come home with you and --",
        "Todd: That's nonsense.",
        "T\u00e9a: Take care of me. Oh, give me a break.",
        "Todd: Because I care about you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Like hell you care about me.",
        "Todd: Hey. You care about me, too, right? Come on, I'm the love of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I might have suggested to Clint that our wedding --",
        "John: Hey, excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, Nora. Bo, you got a minute?",
        "Nora: Yeah. He does. Absolutely. Come on in.",
        "Bo: Okay, yeah. Come on in. But just tell me you're here to pick up your shield and gun.",
        "John: Cole just got arrested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You took drugs?",
        "Cole: No, I didn't actually take them. The guy put the bag of pills in my pocket.",
        "Marty: Why didn't you just give them back?",
        "Cole: Because he just walked away. And, yeah, so -- so literally I was holding the pills in my hand. And for about 10 seconds, I thought about it. You know, I think about it even when I don't have drugs in my hand. You know, I -- I wonder what it -- what it feels like. I'm tempted. But, I didn't. I couldn't. Because I owe you, and I owe Matthew.",
        "Nora: Yes, you do.",
        "Cole: And I couldn't do it to Starr.",
        "Marty: And you can't do it to yourself.",
        "Cole: Yeah, but sometimes, you know, that's not enough. I just think about all the people that I owe and then I stop. Mom, I swear -- I swear on my baby's life that I didn't take the pills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Starr, I'm sorry, but this is crazy. Marcie just dropped this baby right in your lap?",
        "Starr: Oh, it wasn't like that.",
        "Blair: Well, she tears up the adoption papers. She brings Hope over here. Did she even ask you if that's what you wanted?",
        "Starr: Yes. And she already knew that it was.",
        "Blair: I know how hard it was. I saw how hard it was for you to give her up. And then -- see, you insisted that that's what you wanted.",
        "Starr: It wasn't. And Marcie knew that. I just -- I didn't want to break my promise to her, you know? And she could see how attached I was to Hope still. How much I love her.",
        "Blair: I thought Marcie was desperate to be a mother.",
        "Starr: Actually, um, she said that her and Michael, they realized that they would be happy whether they had a baby or not.",
        "Blair: She's changed.",
        "Starr: So have I. I'm really ready to do this.",
        "Blair: You sure?",
        "Starr: Positive. But I can't raise Hope alone. Will you still help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Hard to believe the kids were better behaved than the adults.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, it wasn't much of a party, huh?",
        "Shaun: You want to know what the worse moment was? Watching all of Moe's chicken go to waste on that grill.",
        "Rachel: It did smell amazing.",
        "Shaun: And that five-alarm barbecue sauce?",
        "Rachel: Well, um, I can't guarantee anything that spectacular, but I'm sure I can scare up something in the kitchen if you're still hungry. Want to come in?",
        "Shaun: I'd like that very much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Don't tell me to keep hoping. I'm paralyzed. I have to live with it.",
        "Destiny: But there's new medicine every day. New surgeries.",
        "Matthew: My parents have talked to every expert in the country.",
        "Destiny: Not every expert.",
        "Shaun: Destiny! What are you doing?",
        "Destiny: Helping Matthew study for his math final.",
        "Shaun: Stick to the numbers.",
        "Rachel: Ah, have you guys eaten yet?",
        "Matthew: No. Are you hungry?",
        "Destiny: Sure.",
        "Rachel: How about I see what's in the kitchen?",
        "Matthew: I'll help.",
        "Shaun: What were you saying to that boy?",
        "Destiny: Nothing.",
        "Shaun: Were you about to tell him that our brother's going to ride into town and get him out of that wheelchair?",
        "Destiny: Greg is coming.",
        "Shaun: How many times have we gone over this? Destiny, do not give Matthew false hope.",
        "Destiny: I'm not going around with you again.",
        "Shaun: Destiny, I know you want to believe, but Greg is not --",
        "Destiny: Greg is coming and he will make Matthew walk again. But I won't say anything until he gets here.",
        "Shaun: Fair enough.",
        "Destiny: I just want to make things right for Matthew. Isn't that what you do for people you care about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: When you handed Starr the baby, were you sure?",
        "Marcie: It was -- you know, it was just as hard as I thought it was going to be until I saw Starr's face. It was like every cell in her body, it just lit up as she reached for Hope.",
        "Michael: Then you did the right thing.",
        "Marcie: Are you sure?",
        "Michael: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marcie: Are you sure, because I know you were ready to be a dad?",
        "Michael: Yes. But you know that look that you saw on Starr's face -- I think that that was my biggest fear. It wasn't Todd. It was that in six months or in a year or in two years or -- you know, she could change her mind.",
        "Marcie: You never said that.",
        "Michael: No. I don't know. I didn't want that fear to get in the way of what you wanted, what we wanted. It's -- we would have handled it.",
        "Michael: What are you laughing at?",
        "Marcie: I'm -- nothing. I'm just -- I'm the luckiest woman I know, really.",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Marcie: I guess we're going to have to take this thing apart again. You know, maybe, maybe we should redecorate. What do you think?",
        "Michael: Maybe we should get out of here.",
        "Marcie: We'll go on vacation?",
        "Michael: No, I want to move away from here. For good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, of course, I will help. I told you from the start, if you wanted to keep Hope, I would do anything that you needed.",
        "Starr: Still? Because the look on your face --",
        "Blair: Well, I was in shock.",
        "Starr: Yeah?",
        "Blair: Yes. Weren't you?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I mean, I don't even know where I'm going to put her down to sleep tonight.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, that's the easy part.",
        "Starr: No --",
        "Blair: We'll just get one of Sam's old cribs and bring it down here. Yes, we will.",
        "Starr: Mom, that's not what I mean.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Starr: I'm supposed to be staying at Dad's right now, but I want you to help me. I want to be staying with you.",
        "Blair: Well, you will because we kind of worked that out today in court.",
        "Starr: You did? You won custody?",
        "Blair: Well, sort of.",
        "Starr: Sort of?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Um, this crazy judge ordered that we all had to live together, including your father.",
        "Starr: No way, he can't do that.",
        "Blair: Well, I didn't think so either, but I guess he can because it's -- you know, it's family court and they have this, kind of, creative leeway that they take and he ordered your dad and me to live together and raise, you know, you kids together. We need to figure it out.",
        "Starr: This is like some bad reality show.",
        "Blair: No kidding.",
        "Starr: So what roof? Where are we moving?",
        "Blair: Well, that part hasn't been figured out yet.",
        "Starr: I haven't even thought about Dad.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Starr: What is he going to think when he finds out that I'm keeping Hope?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Cole, you were caught with drugs. You don't have a prescription.",
        "Cole: But the guy shoved them on me.",
        "Bo: Then throw them on the ground. Every two-bit junkie knows that.",
        "Cole: Do -- do you know why the cop could even see the drugs? Because I had my arm up, ready to throw them into the river.",
        "Marty: Hey, I believe you. I believe you.",
        "John: Me, too.",
        "Cole: Look, I'll take a drug test right now. Whatever you want.",
        "Bo: No, that's okay. If you're willing, I know you're clean.",
        "Cole: I am. I swear.",
        "John: Can you make this go away?",
        "Bo: That's up to Nora.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I heard you were a whiz at math.",
        "Destiny: Math and science run in the family. Maybe not with Shaun here, but --",
        "Shaun: Dest --",
        "Destiny: But Shaun is our security expert. Didn't you have to work a party tonight?",
        "Rachel: It ended early.",
        "Destiny: Didn't you have to break it down?",
        "Shaun: Not tonight.",
        "Destiny: Shaun --",
        "Shaun: Dorian Lord might have fired me tonight.",
        "Destiny: I might have won a gold medal at the Olympics last summer, but I didn't. Did you get fired?",
        "Rachel: Dorian was having a bad night.",
        "Shaun: We'll see how it looks tomorrow.",
        "Destiny: If you're fired, you better get a new job quick or you cannot date a woman as fine as my friend Matthew's sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't roll away angry.",
        "T\u00e9a: I despise you, Todd. That's the truth.",
        "Todd: That's not what you said.",
        "T\u00e9a: What I allegedly said. After I had been shot, gassed, was out of mind, and near death. According to your less than reliable ex-wife. The only thing I remember calling you is a son of a bitch.",
        "Todd: I'm sure you said it with love.",
        "T\u00e9a: I am not playing, Todd. Not in any way, shape, or form. You destroyed the one thing in my life that I made, the one thing that matters to me. Being a lawyer means everything to me.",
        "Todd: I know. And I promise, I'm going to fix it.",
        "T\u00e9a: You idiot. You can't. Not now. By tomorrow morning, the Pennsylvania Bar Association will have heard everything about this fiasco.",
        "Todd: Then I'll buy the judge.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't even say that. They'll think that it was my idea.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, do you think you're the only one on my staff that's capable of damage control? I'm going to fix this.",
        "T\u00e9a: How can you be so sure?",
        "Todd: Well, uh, Nora threw the case when she was defending me. And she's the D.A. now. Listen, the only thing you're guilty of is a little, um, what do you call it, ex parte communication in your hotel room. And on the defense table in the courtroom, but --",
        "T\u00e9a: You're disgusting.",
        "Todd: Which we could say -- which we could tell the bar that I talked you into. Or better yet, that I threatened you into. That's -- that's good. They'll eat that up with a spoon. I'll get a little fine and you get a little suspension, give you time to recover at my house.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Wait a second. You actually think I'm coming home with you?",
        "Todd: Where else you going to go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Mom, thank you for everything.",
        "Blair: Aw.",
        "Starr: I mean, you've been so great about Hope ever since the beginning.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, that's one thing you're going to learn about being a mom is sometimes when your children need you, you can actually help.",
        "[Starr laughs]",
        "Blair: That's the best feeling in the whole wide world. Yes, it is. I love you.",
        "Starr: Love you.",
        "Blair: And I love you, punkinhead. Be right back.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "[Starr squeals]",
        "Starr: I still can't believe it. We are going to have so many adventures together. I promise you that I am your last and final mom, okay? Is that a deal? You're probably used to being called Chloe, aren't you? But your name was always Hope. Marcie named you that, okay? Never forget it. You like that name? That's who you are. You're Hope Manning. And I'm your mom. And we are going to have an amazing life together. Starting now.",

        "Marcie: He's the one who quoted your paper on emergency room protocol, right?",
        "Michael: Yeah. While you were gone, he called and -- he offered me a job.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Michael: Yeah. A spot opened up and he remembered that I said my residency was up in a few weeks. He wants to make me an attending in their E.R.",

        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Are you kidding?",
        "Michael: It's -- it's -- it's huge. I mean, it'd be a major bump in pay. Cutting edge emergency room technology.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but it's in Seattle.",
        "Michael: But the -- we could buy a house. You know? And you could -- you could get your teaching license in Washington State.",
        "Marcie: Wow. You really -- you've thought this all through.",
        "Michael: I -- I don't know. What do you -- what do you say?",
        "Marcie: Seattle's really far.",
        "Michael: I know, but it's -- it's a chance to start over. You know, I mean, some place new. Some place where it's about you and me.",
        "Marcie: Are you just -- are you just afraid of what will happen every time I see Hope. Because I want you to know that I'm perfectly fine with seeing her, just like I am with Sam.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I know that. But I wonder if it might be time for it to be okay not seeing them.",

        "Starr: I wonder what happened.",
        "Blair: I don't know. You didn't talk to Langston or anything?",

        "Bo: Well, Matthew is healing. He doesn't blame Cole. Cole's trying to heal. And I believe the kid.",
        "Nora: Well -- I believe him, too. But if the judge hears of this, it's automatic remand. And you really want to stop this now --",

        "Bo: Well, Nora and I talked about this and we both feel --",
        "Nora: And it doesn't really matter anymore, Bo. That was the judge who sat on Cole's case the first time. The arresting officer, he put the charges through on his computer in the unit and it went right to the judge, so Cole's charges of possession of illegal substances have raised a flag and everything's out of our hands now.",
        "Cole: So that's it? I have to go to prison.",
        "Marty: The facts haven't changed. I mean, Cole can't go to prison just because some other kid found him and harassed him.",

        "Cole: Not that I know of.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, maybe there's someone that you didn't focus on, but maybe someone who could've seen this guy pushing the drugs at you?",
        "Cole: No.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, can you at least prove that you didn't buy the drugs? I mean, can you give us the guy's name who was harassing you?",
        "Cole: Yeah, his name is Asher Garnett, but he's not going to help me.",
        "Marty: Oh, well, there you go. You got his name -- that's got to do something.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but he still had the drugs. Marty, I think that we really should do that drug test now.",
        "Nora: Well, as the prosecution, I would argue that he didn't have a chance to take the drugs, but you know what? What the heck. Go ahead, let's get the drug test on the record.",
        "Bo: Okay, we'll do it before lockup.",
        "Marty: No, no, no -- I'll post bail.",
        "John: You can't. It's a probation violation.",
        "Bo: Automatic detention.",
        "Marty: You've got to be kidding me. This is ridiculous!",
        "Bo: Marty, I'm sorry. Uh, Nora and I will keep trying to figure out a way around this, but the arresting officer already put Cole in the system, so he's going to have to spend tonight in jail.",

        "Blair: Well, how long ago was that?",
        "Starr: Like hours. I don't know -- he felt weird that he was getting an empty diploma folder, felt like he shouldn't be there.",
        "Blair: Wow, and he was also kind of upset about saying goodbye to Hope, too.",

It's a good thing plan B is sitting here, ready, willing, and able.",
