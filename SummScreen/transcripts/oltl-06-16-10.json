        "Dani: That really is great about Markko. Guess the world needs lawyers after all.",
        "T\u00e9a: Gee, thank you, sweetheart.",
        "Dani: Just please tell me this doesn't mean that you're going back to spending all your time defending Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: Honey, your father hired me to represent him.",
        "Dani: You couldn't say no? \"No, Todd. Go find yourself another attorney. No, Todd. I never want to see you again.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: Honey, I--",
        "Dani: What? What is it gonna take to get him out of your life?",

        "Todd: Breakfast, anyone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Has anyone turned in my bag yet? Okay, if they do, can you please give me a ca--yeah. Thank you.",
        "Blair: So, they find it?",
        "Starr: No, which means I'm going to have to cancel all of my credit cards and then buy a new cell phone.",
        "Blair: Okay, take a deep breath. You can do that later, but today you got something to celebrate.",
        "Dorian: Oh, there she is!",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Our almost graduate! Ohh! I love the dress. Love it, love it, love it. Can you believe she's through with high school?",
        "Blair: She's all grown up.",
        "Kelly: Oh, well, I hate to break it to you, but Starr here has been more grown up than either one of you since she was 4 years old.",
        "Starr: That's very true.",
        "Dorian: But you will always be our shining little Starr, no matter how old and wise you get. Right?",
        "Blair: I'm hungry. I smell something good. Anybody else hungry?",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, wait, wait. Where's Langston? We can't have breakfast without our valedictorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: And as we move into our future, our years here at Llanview High will remain an indelible part of our...",

        "Langston: Markko? Markko? Can I help you?",
        "Man: Starr Manning?",

        "James' voice: No. No. No!",
        "James: I've got to get that money back.",

        "Darren: What did you do, rob a bank?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Hey, all the charges are dropped.",
        "Markko: I'm not a suspect anymore.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, you must be so relieved, not to mention your parents.",
        "Markko: Yeah. They were pretty freaked.",
        "Charlie: Did they arrest anyone else?",
        "Markko: Not that I've heard. What are the cops telling the \"Banner\"?",
        "Viki: Not very much. They're actually hoping that Robert Ford will be able to identify his assailant.",
        "Markko: Mmm, me, too. I just want this whole thing to be over. I'll get you guys some menus.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Charlie: Huh...",
        "Viki: Okay, what is so interesting?",
        "Charlie: Oh, no, I was just checking the \"Banner's\" masthead here. I wanted to see if David Vickers' name was anywhere. You weren't serious about hiring him, were you?",

        "David: All right! For the love of--",
        "Destiny: What, were you raised by wolves? If you're gonna answer the door, put some clothes on.",
        "David: Destiny? You look different.",
        "Destiny: I know. I'm a fox. So, where's Matthew?",
        "David: Matthew?",
        "Destiny: Your brother?",
        "David: What makes you think he's here?",
        "Destiny: He lives here.",
        "Matthew: Who's a man gotta kill to get some breakfast around here?",
        "Destiny: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Did you invite him for breakfast? No. So you thought you'd just show up here without even calling.",
        "Todd: Well, you guys have to eat, don't you?",
        "Dani: I don't want you here. When are you going to get that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella, don't be rude.",
        "Dani: Rude? He barged in here!",
        "Todd: Well, I knocked.",
        "Dani: Why don't you just go bother Starr? She's graduating. You could take a picture of her in her cap and gown and put it on the front page of your stupid--",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella, that's enough, okay?",
        "Dani: Why are you yelling at me? He's the problem.",
        "Todd: Listen, Dani, I know that you and I have some problems to work out, but--",
        "Dani: Okay, how's this? I hereby release you from any so-called responsibilities you may think you have. I don't need you. I've got my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I'm sorry. I was trying to reach Robert Ford. I see. Okay, fine. Yeah, all right. Thanks.",
        "Markko: What do you want with that scum?",
        "James: You know him?",
        "Markko: Look familiar?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: But did you see Dorian's face when I offered David the job?",
        "Charlie: Well, she knew you weren't serious.",
        "Viki: Who says I'm not serious?",
        "Charlie: That's ridiculous! The guy is a--a--a--a gigolo!",
        "Viki: Ha ha! In point of fact, sweetheart, David has never been able to make that particular career path work for him. And it's really no more ridiculous than you working for Dorian after what she did to you. Charlie, she poured alcohol down your throat when you were unconscious.",
        "Charlie: Wait a minute. I thought you had no problem with me doing this job.",
        "Viki: I don't. I think it's a very worthwhile project. I do wish you didn't have to work with Dorian quite so closely.",
        "Charlie: Okay, look, Viki, I know you weren't thrilled with those pictures, but there is no way I ever would have let her kiss me.",
        "Viki: Darling, I believe you. The thing is, you don't really know Dorian. When she sets her mind to something, there is no stopping her.",
        "Charlie: What, so that's why you hired David?",
        "Viki: What do you mean?",
        "Charlie: Well, I mean, I come home and the guy's wrapped around you half- naked.",
        "Viki: I was not half-naked!",
        "Charlie: Well, he was.",
        "Viki: Oh, but that's David. He's always half-naked if he can be. That's nothing new.",
        "Charlie: Well, so you wanted to rub Dorian's face in it?",
        "Viki: Honey, I didn't know you were bringing Dorian home. And as far as offering David a job, believe it or not, that's something I've thought about for years.",
        "Charlie: Oh, and just exactly what would this wannabe gigolo be doing for you?",
        "Viki: For me, nothing. He would be working for the \"Banner.\"",
        "Charlie: As what? A half-naked mascot?",
        "Viki: Well, it might drum up business.",
        "Charlie: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Please tell me I'm not seeing what I'm seeing.",
        "Wendy: Honey, you know it's extra for overnight.",
        "David: Wendy, you're such a card.",
        "Fawn: We were out real late.",
        "David: Yeah, we took the girls out, show 'em a fun night on the town, and then we all just came back here. Didn't we, Matthew?",
        "Fawn: We sure did. Ha!",
        "David: We all had a little too much to drink and nobody was sober enough to drive. You should see Matthew put down the sparkling cider. So I thought everyone should just stay here overnight, for safety sake.",
        "Destiny: Please, David. They're pros!",
        "David: Destiny, I'm shocked! Shocked! That you would think that I would have to pay for it.",
        "Destiny: And I hope they charge you double. What the hell are you doing?",
        "Fawn: Is this your girlfriend, sweetie?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Destiny: No. I'm his friend, his best friend. I know Dani stomped all over your heart and everything, but I can't believe you would do... this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: The money's not real.",
        "Darren: It sure looked real.",
        "Nate: Good. I mean, it's supposed to. It's a prop for the musical.",
        "Darren:: There's no bag of cash in the musical.",
        "Nate: There is in the new scene, the one that Langston wrote. You didn't get the pages. It's just me and Dani.",
        "Darren: You do know the musical has been canceled.",
        "Darren: You didn't get the text? Langston went to the principal, told him she's pulling it.",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Darren: Come on. Cole's in jail and Markko is, too. Only now I guess he's been released, but he broke up with her. So I guess it's just wrong to do some lovey-dovey show when everybody's crashing and burning. Anyway, I helped Mr. Vega dump the set and props. I'll toss that in the incinerator.",
        "Nate: No, no, no, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: So how did you lose your bag?",
        "Starr: I left it on the roof of my car, and it must have fallen off in the garage and someone took it.",
        "Dorian: You left your purse on the roof of the car?",
        "Kelly: I've left my keys in the door.",
        "Dorian: Yes, honey, but you're so much more...",
        "Blair: Spacy.",
        "Kelly: Oh, nice.",
        "Blair: Oh, I know.",
        "Kelly: Thank you.",
        "Blair: But I still love you.",
        "Kelly: Oh, yeah. Sure.",
        "Blair: I do! You know what, sweetheart, I get it. Look at me. You've had a lot on your mind lately. It's okay.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I mean, it's just been harder having to do everything for Hope myself, you know, and Cole can't even come to my graduation.",
        "Kelly: Well, we could bring Hope with us.",
        "Starr: No, Hope has a fever. She's not going anywhere. I'm sorry, guys. I don't mean to complain, but sometimes I just feel really alone.",
        "Dorian: Nonsense, Starr. You're a Cramer, and Cramers are never alone. Right, girls?",
        "Kelly: Absolutely. No, ma'am.",
        "Blair: Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: She's not here right now, but I can tell her you stopped by. And you are...",
        "Man: Well, I found her bag. I just want to return it.",
        "Langston: Oh! Well, that's news to me. I didn't even realize she lost it. So, she's not here?",
        "Langston: No, she's out, but I can make sure she gets this.",
        "Man: No, that's okay. I'll wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: The money's fake, right?",
        "Nate: Right.",
        "Darren: So, let's go up to the bell tower and throw it off, watch people scramble.",
        "Nate: I want to keep it.",
        "Darren: A bag full of fake money?",
        "Nate: As a souvenir.",
        "Darren: Of a show that was canceled?",
        "Nate: I had the lead.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Darren: I gotta take this.",
        "Nate: Whew!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How about you give me your number? I'm sure Starr will want to thank you or maybe even give you a reward. What was your name?",
        "Man: Well, I don't need any thanks. I'm just trying to do the right thing here.",
        "Langston: Well, you did, so thank you.",
        "[Keys jingling]",
        "Langston: I'm running late. It was really nice of you to return Starr's bag.",
        "Man: It was nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: So, you're the guy they arrested?",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "James: This says you were cleared.",
        "Markko: Well, I didn't do it. I wish I had.",
        "James: Why?",
        "Markko: Because Robert Ford is a snake. Why were you calling him?",
        "James: I was just trying to get some information.",
        "Markko: Why?",
        "James: I'm thinking about going to school for journalism.",
        "Markko: So you don't know him?",
        "James: No. Why should I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: So, this is about Dorian and not me?",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I was completely in favor of you taking the job, okay? I am totally not in favor of Dorian making a play for my husband.",
        "Charlie: You've got nothing to worry about.",
        "Viki: Well, neither do you.",
        "Charlie: No, I'm not worried. I'm gonna buy the guy some sunscreen.",
        "Viki: Good, I'll buy Dorian a muzzle.",
        "Charlie: Okay. I'm glad that we can both be so mature about this.",
        "Viki: And why shouldn't we be? Neither one of us has anything to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Okay, mama is gonna watch the boys, okay?",
        "Starr: Unless they've caught whatever Hope has.",
        "Blair: Or, you know what, maybe she caught what they have. But you know what, look what they made!",
        "Starr: Oh, that's so cute!",
        "Blair: Isn't that wonderful? They made this for you. I think you should wear it. Hee hee!",
        "Starr: Oh ho! I'll do it--",
        "Langston: Hey.",
        "Dorian: Oh! There you are. We've been worried sick about you. I'm sorry. I was practicing my speech and some guy showed up with this. Starr, for you.",
        "Starr: My bag! Oh, my gosh!",
        "Kelly: Check to see if everything's in there.",
        "Blair: Move that.",
        "Starr: Okay, all right. First... okay, all right, my wallet's here. My wallet's here.",
        "Blair: Well, who found it?",
        "Langston: Well, I don't know. Some big weird guy showed up at the door with it.",
        "Dorian: And you let him in?",
        "Langston: No. He stayed in the hall.",
        "Dorian: But you opened the door.",
        "Langston: He had Starr's purse.",
        "Dorian: Honey! It could have been a ploy. You know how men are. You, of all people, should know that.",
        "Kelly: Okay, Dorian, do we have to do this. Langston is fine. The purse is home.",
        "Starr: My phone is missing.",
        "Dorian: Oh! You see? He stole her cell phone.",
        "Starr: No. Okay. It could have fallen out.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what, let's stress out about this tomorrow, 'cause we have some graduation gifts to open, so come on!",
        "Kelly: That's right!",
        "Blair: Kelly, I need your help to carry them--",
        "Dorian: Wait till you see. Adriana went all out.",
        "Starr: Did you hear that they let Markko go; he's no longer a suspect?",
        "Langston: No, but it doesn't matter. He still hates me.",
        "Starr: Okay, so you won't believe--",
        "Langston: No. First tell me, how did you end up losing that?",
        "Starr: I was just gonna tell you, okay. There was this guy, right, and he-- [Sighs]",
        "Dorian: Okay, we want our graduation girls over here.",
        "Starr: Yeah, we're coming.",
        "Langston: What guy?",
        "Starr: I'll tell you about it later.",

        "David: Any time, Matthew.",
        "Destiny: Any time?",
        "Fawn: I sure hope so. I've got to get to my accounting class.",
        "Matthew: I'll walk you out.",
        "Destiny: How could you do this to him?",
        "David: Give him the best night of his life?",
        "Destiny: The girl he loves just dumped him. He's hurt!",
        "David: Not anymore, he's not. After one evening with Fawn, he can take on the world. Trust me. I know.",

        "[Door closes]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I just don't think I'm gonna reach her. I think she just won't let me in. She's too tough.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course she's tough. Look at who her parents are. But Todd, you have to keep trying, okay?",
        "Todd: Of course I'm gonna keep trying. How are you feeling?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh! I'm feeling just dandy. Thanks for asking.",
        "Todd: All right, well, you know what, don't get too comfortable. I should take you to your appointment.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, don't you have to get to the high school?",
        "Todd: No. What time is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know.",
        "Todd: That's not for a half an hour or so.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, I'm perfectly capable of taking a cab. Besides, I'd like to eat some breakfast, and I think I heard the traffic was gonna be really bad so--",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. Hold on.",
        "T\u00e9a: You need to go--",
        "Todd: Hold on. Did you cancel the appointment? Why did you do that?",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not getting any better, Todd. Okay? It's not working. The tumor is still just as big as it was when I started.",
        "Todd: Which means it's not growing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why should I blast what's left of my brain--",
        "Todd: Because you have to! You have to keep trying!",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not going to get any better, Todd, okay? Do you understand that? This is it! It's over.",
        "Todd: Now who's giving up?",
        "T\u00e9a: I am not giving up, Todd. But just because I want things to be different does not mean that they will change.",
        "Todd: Are you the same woman who took \"Raymond vs. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\" all the way to the state supreme court?",
        "T\u00e9a: And lost on appeal. You don't think I'm hoping for a miracle? Of course I am, but I-- we cannot waste time. We have to make provisions for Daniella.",
        "Todd: No, we don't. No, we don't. All you have to do is get better. Period. I can't lose you, not after we have so much going for us.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah! You, me, our kid, and my brain tumor?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha!",
        "Todd: Your brain tumor's gonna have to ride in the trunk. Listen, okay, uh... here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna get back on track. We're gonna... we're gonna find new doctors. We're gonna do all that kind of thing.",
        "T\u00e9a: We're gonna do all that kind of thing tomorrow. Today is Starr's graduation. Okay, it's a very big day for her. She's accomplished a lot. She's an amazing kid.",
        "Todd: Of course she's an amazing kid. All my kids are amazing.",
        "T\u00e9a: He says with his characteristic modesty.",
        "Todd: Oh, it's true. And seeing as how they came from different chicks, must be me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha! [Snorts]",
        "Todd: I knew I could--there you go.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha ha!",

The most important thing that I've learned is to take responsibility for my mistakes. Everyone messes up, but that's no excuse. You have-- I have to own up to what I've done. I have to make it right with the people that I've hurt, and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But that's not enough. I have to change. I have to learn from what I've done. We all do, because we all make mistakes. Parents forget how to talk to their children. Husbands and wives forget what's important. And we forget how to love one another, and we've hurt each other. We all do it. But what's important is that we make it right, that you own up to what you've done and change what you're doing wrong. And I know it's hard. I know it is, but you can't run from it. I can't, and I have to make it right.",
