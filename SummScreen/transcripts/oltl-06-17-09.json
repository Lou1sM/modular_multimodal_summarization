At Cole's hearing, the judge was not amused that Cole broke his probation and sentenced him to no less than five years in jail. Nora then testified on Cole's behalf that she has noticed a change in Cole. The judge decided to call recess to think it over. Bo tells Matthew that he couldn't keep Cole from being arrested. Matthew is more interested in how much time Bo and Nora have been spending together. Stacy bribes a kid to get her front row seats at the community center concert and Rex shows up with Shane.

        "Starr: Mmm, cheerios. It's your favorite. Is that what you want for breakfast this morning, huh? Come here. Here, Mommy will help you eat it. You want one? Mmm, scrumptious. You just want to play with the bowl, don't you?",
        "Langston: Hold on, is that --",
        "Starr: Hope. Say hello to your Aunt Langston.",
        "Langston: Are you babysitting?",
        "Starr: No, she's mine.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: She came home. Marcie gave her back to me.",

        "Male singer: We can live we can love...",
        "Michael: Oh, Marcie, come on. It's all going to get to Seattle, even if it's not packed perfectly.",
        "Marcie: I just want to make sure that it doesn't break.",
        "Michael: We've been up most of the night. Why don't you let the movers do the rest? I mean, God, it's mid-June. At our pace we're going to get there by Christmas. I was kidding, I was kidding, I was kidding. I'm kidding.",
        "Marcie: No, I know. I just lost track of time, that's all.",
        "Michael: No, no, forget it, forget it. I know, we're moving fast. Did you get all your clothes packed?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, my suitcases are by the door and I -- I have to run an errand.",
        "Michael: You're joking me. What do you -- what do you have to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Marcie knew that I didn't want to let Hope go. And she had already realized that she could be happy without a baby. So she didn't want to hold on.",
        "Langston: So, Hope is yours for good?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: You're raising your baby.",
        "Starr: Cole and I, we're going to raise her together.",
        "Langston: Whoa, that -- that's huge. Cole must be freaking out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Is Starr coming?",
        "Cole: No way.",
        "Marty: Well, why wouldn't she want to be here?",
        "Cole: I -- I didn't even tell her. Let's see what happens here, first.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "John: It looks like we're about to find out.",
        "Judge Runyon: Let's begin. In the matter of the state vs. Cole Thornhart, we have a parole violation?",
        "Nora: Yes, Your Honor.",
        "Judge Runyon: According to the arresting officer, Mr. Thornhart was apprehended with a controlled substance. This is in direct violation of the plea agreement in his reckless endangerment conviction last march. Wasn't that accident enough to get your attention, son? Matthew Buchanan is in a wheelchair for life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You need some help?",
        "Matthew: No, I'm okay.",
        "Bo: Okay, anyway, son, we didn't have a choice. We had to arrest Cole.",
        "Matthew: But I thought he said he wasn't using drugs. I mean, didn't you believe him?",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, I did. But the officer that brought him in, he'd already put him in the system. So our hands were tied. Your mom and I spent hours last night trying to figure out another way, but --",
        "Matthew: Do you and Mom do that a lot? You know, work late together?",
        "Bo: Sometimes. Why?",
        "Matthew: I don't know, just wondering. Will that change once Mom and Uncle Clint get married?",
        "Bo: I don't know.",
        "Matthew: Are you okay with it -- Mom getting married?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint.",
        "Clint: Oh, God, it's --",
        "Viki: It's monstrous.",
        "Clint: You and I have buried too many children, you know that.",
        "Viki: That's our little granddaughter. How do we do this? How on earth is Jessie going to get through this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: The last time I was here, I brought our little girl to come meet you. That's what I thought. It wasn't our baby, Nash. Our baby is dead, and it's because of me. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Nash. I didn't take care of our baby. And the only time that I can stand the thought of it is when I think about her in your arms, because if there's any justice in this world or in the next, then she's with you. So take care of her. Take better care of our little girl than I did.",
        "[Jessica sobs]",
        "Jessica: Brody, you're here.",
        "Brody: There's no place else I'd be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Such a sad day.",
        "Viki: Charlie, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Natalie: This is so awful, Dad.",
        "Clint: Take it one day at a time, sweetheart.",
        "Natalie: I just hope she can remember that.",
        "Jared: Where is she?",
        "Viki: Jessie went to Nash's grave. Brody's with her.",
        "Charlie: How is Jess doing this morning?",
        "Viki: Well, she made pancakes for Bree.",
        "Clint: They were working on the alphabet song when I picked up Bree for preschool.",
        "Jared: Unbelievable.",
        "Viki: She's a survivor.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, until she -- until she sees that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Son, I have no problem with your mom and Clint getting married. Do you?",
        "Matthew: Uncle Clint's a great guy. It's just lately you and Mom have been pretty tight.",
        "Rex: Hey, Matthew, Bo.",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "Rex: What are you guys doing today? Because if the answer is nothing, I've got an idea.",
        "Bo: Well, we heard that there is a hot new drummer making his debut at the community center today.",
        "Rex: It's true. I am his agent and his manager and all booking requests go through me.",
        "Shane: You're coming to hear me?",
        "Matthew: What, you think we'd miss it?",
        "Shane: The new drum kit is awesome. The snare is so tight that it pops. You want to go see?",
        "Matthew: Sure, we were just about to head in.",
        "Bo: Hey, Shane, where's your mom? I heard that she's your number one groupie.",
        "Stacy: Hey, guys. I just bribed some kid to hold us the best seats in the house. We're going to catch your every move, dude. Hey.",
        "Rex: I was wondering what happened to you this morning.",
        "Stacy: Oh, I woke up early and you looked beat, so I let you sleep. Came out here to scout out the seats.",
        "Shane: Aunt Stacy rules. I was just going to show Matt the new drums. You want to come with us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I am very sorry for what I did to Matthew, and I have learned my lesson.",
        "Judge Runyon: Apparently not.",
        "Lawyer: Your Honor, the arrest report does not include the full story of what happened last night.",
        "Judge Runyon: It's one simple question, Counselor. Mr. Thornhart, did you have drugs on you when you were arrested?",
        "Cole: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, I was given drugs but I -- I didn't take them and I had no intention to take them. I was -- I was throwing them out and that's when the officer saw me.",
        "Judge Runyon: Do you have any idea how many times I've heard that story?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Check it. Listen to the snare.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, that -- that's the best. Are you thirsty? 'Cause I'm going to go get something to drink for Rex and me.",
        "Shane: No, thanks.",
        "Stacy: All right.",
        "Matthew: That's a great set-up, Shane. Is this your first time playing them?",
        "Shane: In public. First time I'm playing them since I got sick. Do you play an instrument?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Destiny: He lies. Man plays a piano like Alicia Keys.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, right. What are you doing here?",
        "Destiny: I'm in the community choir.",
        "Matthew: Oh, do you know Shane? He's playing the drums with you guys today. This is Destiny.",
        "Destiny: Hey.",
        "Shane: Hey.",
        "Destiny: It is fate that you're here. We need a piano player.",
        "Matthew: Well, I don't really play.",
        "Destiny: I heard you in the band room at school. You're really good. And Jimmy, the keyboard player, called in sick. If you don't play, there's no concert.",
        "Bo: Hey, Balsom, where's Gigi?",
        "Rex: She's going to tonight's performance.",
        "Bo: Oh, and that's so that the two of you won't cross paths?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Bo: Come on, what's up?",
        "Rex: We're being civilized for Shane's sake.",
        "Bo: Oh, and you've got Stacy waking you up in the morning, huh?",
        "Rex: She's staying at my place until she can get a job. She saved Shane's life. It's the least I can do.",
        "Bo: Okay, and that's all it is?",
        "Rex: For now.",
        "[Bo scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I just can't wait for Cole to see Hope and know that he doesn't have to say goodbye to her this time.",
        "Langston: Why wasn't he here, like, instantly?",
        "Starr: Well, he was with his mom last night, and he couldn't get away and then he had a counseling thing this morning.",
        "Langston: And?",
        "Starr: Well, he doesn't know about Hope, yet.",
        "Langston: You didn't tell him?",
        "Starr: Well, not over the phone. Cole knows that I have good news, but that's all he knows. And he'll be here soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Runyon: Mr. Thornhart, last spring you were given a very generous plea deal for a very serious crime. All you had to do to stay out of jail was stay away from drugs. You failed at the one single thing required of you, and you are old enough to be sentenced as an adult. Prisoner is remanded to serve time on the original charges. A term of no less than five years in prison.",
        "Starr: You really pushed Aunt Dorian in the pool?",
        "Langston: I should have done worse. I couldn't believe her.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, tell me everything that happened.",
        "Langston: Hmm, so it's the first time she's meeting Markko's parents, and she decides to tell them that we had sex on prom night for the first time.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Wait, we're not supposed to be saying this stuff.",
        "Langston: Sorry.",
        "Starr: Okay, but go on.",
        "Langston: Anyway, she was totally plastered and doing everything she could to shock them.",
        "Starr: She's brutal when she gets like that.",
        "Langston: And Markko's parents are totally straight-laced. It was horrible, like a freak show. Anyway, I need to get out of the house. I'll tell you everything at the mall.",
        "Starr: The mall? Hello.",
        "Langston: Oh, right.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: No mall for you.",
        "Starr: Not this morning. So yummy.",
        "Langston: So, I mean, what? Your dad still doesn't know about Hope?",
        "Starr: No, I have to tell Cole first.",
        "Langston: How is that going to work? You and Cole share custody?",
        "Starr: I guess. I don't even know where I'm living today.",
        "Langston: Come again?",
        "Starr: Well, my mom and dad were in court again yesterday. You don't even want to know about it, and I don't want to talk about it. All I want to do is look at this one.",
        "Langston: It's so hard not to.",
        "Starr: I know. All last night, I just stared at her. [Giggles] I couldn't even think about questions, but you're right. There's so much to think about right now. I just can't wait until Cole gets here.",
        "Langston: He's going to be a great dad.",
        "Starr: She means the world to him. I bet he's really going to be hands-on.",
        "Langston: And you're cool with that?",
        "Starr: Of course. I want Hope to have a real father, and I know that Cole and I are going to raise her together and really make it work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: Your Honor, may we please be heard before you rule?",
        "Judge Runyon: The terms of the probation were clear.",
        "Lawyer: There are exigent circumstances.",
        "Judge Runyon: The boy nearly killed someone last March. The law is here to make sure he does not have the chance to do it again. I'm not interested in excuses.",
        "Nora: Your Honor, I certainly understand your not being interested in the excuses of the defense, but may I be heard?",
        "Judge Runyon: Proceed.",
        "Nora: Thank you. I am not only the district attorney but the victim. The one person who was hurt the most by Cole Thornhart happens to be my only son Matthew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: No way am I playing the piano here.",
        "Destiny: Why not?",
        "Matthew: I can't.",
        "Destiny: Then the concert is history.",
        "Shane: Matt, come on, man.",
        "Matthew: There's got to be somebody else besides me. I -- I can't even operate the foot pedals.",
        "Destiny: It's an electric keyboard. No pedals, no excuse.",
        "Matthew: I don't know the program.",
        "Destiny: You can read sheet music, can't you?",
        "Matthew: I haven't played since the accident.",
        "Shane: Yeah, and I haven't played since I first started chemo. We'll be, like, the hospital escapee choir.",
        "Matthew: No kidding.",
        "Destiny: Matt, that chair has got nothing to do with it. You can play the piano. Just say yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Your Honor, I was the one that insisted that charges be brought against Cole Thornhart. But while I was prosecuting him, I came to understand that no one was going to be helped by him going to prison. So I offered a deal, one that I felt served justice and that had a chance of saving him. Now, I've been watching Cole Thornhart very closely since his -- this accident and I believe he's turned the corner. I believe he did not seek out those drugs that he was found with and had no intention of taking them last night.",
        "Judge Runyon: Would you bet your son's life on it?",
        "Nora: Well, Matthew already has. He forgave Cole a long time ago. I'm willing to give Cole the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Judge Runyon: I don't have a lot of room here.",
        "Nora: Well, I'd like to propose a deal, one where the violations are addressed and where a young boy doesn't go to prison for five years, where I'm pretty sure he'll be destroyed.",
        "Judge Runyon: Let's take a recess while I study the case file again. When we're back, I'll hear your proposal and rule.",
        "Nora: Okay, thank you, Your Honor.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I always thought things would work out with you and Gigi.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I thought that they would, too. Except every time I see her, she's with a different guy. I don't know what's going on with her.",
        "Bo: Well, when a kid gets as sick as Shane was, that can make you crazy. Maybe that's what happened.",
        "Rex: I don't know what's going on inside of her. It's like she's turned to every other guy but me.",
        "Bo: It's hard to come back from that.",
        "Rex: You didn't, right?",
        "Bo: It took a long time, but I finally understood why Nora did what she did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Hi.",
        "Marcie: I'm so glad you're here today.",
        "Gigi: Marcie, I am so sorry that I haven't been by to see the baby, yet. I have a present and everything. When is a good time?",
        "Marcie: Oh, we have so much to catch up on.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Marcie: Hope is back with her mother. You know, she didn't belong to me any more than she belonged to Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's almost as tiny as she was.",
        "Viki: Yes, it is.",
        "Jessica: I didn't get to see her. Did you know that? Tess did and Bess did, but I didn't get to see my own daughter and she didn't get to see me as myself.",
        "Viki: I know that, baby. I know, I know.",
        "Reverend: Good morning.",
        "Clint: Oh, Reverend, thank you for being here.",
        "Reverend: Whenever you're ready.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Viki: I think maybe we need just a little time.",
        "Jessica: No, no, I'm ready, I'm ready. But first, I need to say something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Your Honor, the Commonwealth would happily see another two years probation added on to the defendant's sentence.",
        "Judge Runyon: Even if I were satisfied with that, the guidelines are clear.",
        "Marty: Your Honor, please.",
        "Judge Runyon: Who's this?",
        "Marty: I'm Cole's mother, and I'm responsible for his being in trouble.",
        "Cole: Mom, don't, please.",
        "Judge Runyon: Sit down, ma'am. I've read your son's file, and based on his performance in treatment and the prosecutor's recommendation, I am prepared to be more lenient.",
        "Marty: Thank you, Your Honor.",
        "Judge Runyon: But probation is out of the question, Ms. Hanen. Cole Thornhart, having pled guilty to a term of reckless endangerment and violating the terms of your probation, I sentence you to a term of two years in prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I was a bad mother to you, sweetheart. You deserved better. I didn't take care of myself; I didn't take care of you. And -- and I took you out into a cold night and I left you all alone in Dr. Joplin's office.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Hey, Joplin.",
        "Schuyler: Okay.",
        "Stacy: Um, Schuy, where's the fire?",
        "Schuyler: Anywhere you've been with a book of matches.",
        "Stacy: Ew, what is up?",
        "Schuyler: Not much.",
        "Stacy: You've got that look on your face like when you broke into Rex's apartment.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah, what look is that? The shocked to find you in bed with your sister's boyfriend look?",
        "Stacy: Okay, I do believe Gigi broke up with Rex. And what are you doing? Why are you in the middle of this?",
        "Schuyler: I know what you did.",
        "Stacy: Oh, God, is this that invisible bag of blood bait-and-switch story? Look, you already tried to sell that to Rex and it won't work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi said that someday I would understand what happened, like it would ever make sense that she cheated.",
        "Bo: Then there must be an explanation if she'd say that.",
        "Rex: Whatever. All I know is if Stacy wasn't here, I'd lose it.",
        "Bo: Oh, that's a switch.",
        "Rex: From?",
        "Bo: Well, you didn't trust her before.",
        "Rex: Stacy was a trouble-maker until there was real trouble with Shane. Stacy stepped up. She's been great ever since. Shane's crazy about her.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm glad you two both have a friend right now.",
        "Rex: But?",
        "Bo: You're just bouncing around.",
        "Rex: Nothing's happened.",
        "Bo: Good. All I'm saying, Balsom, as your friend, take it slow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Look, it's a great opportunity for Michael, it really is. And -- and they have good schools there.",
        "Gigi: And you won't have to run into Hope at the store.",
        "Marcie: No, that has absolutely nothing to do with it. I promise you, I'm fine.",
        "Gigi: You wanted that baby so much.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, so did her mother. And you know, that's where she should be, right? Look, I'll always love Hope to pieces, I will. But I finally realize I don't need her to make me okay, Gigi, and that's wonderful. You know, my life, it's wonderful.",
        "Gigi: You do look great. You're happier than I've ever seen you.",
        "Marcie: I am, I am. You know, I have everything I need. And you will, too. I know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I've tried to apologize to everyone. Now it's your turn, sweetheart, because I hurt you the most. I even gave your name to another little girl. Today, you get it back. Chloe Victoria Brennan, I'm so sorry. Your mama will love you forever. Rest in peace, sweet Chloe, and give that to your daddy. He'll know who it's from.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Runyon: Assuming good behavior, the defendant is eligible for parole in a year. The defendant will be remanded to a state correctional facility starting today. Is that acceptable to the prosecution?",
        "Nora: It would be acceptable to the commonwealth to give the defendant a few days to get his affairs in order.",
        "Judge Runyon: Mr. Thornhart, you have two days. At which point, you will surrender your client to serve his time. We are adjourned.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
