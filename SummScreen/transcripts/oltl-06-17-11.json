        "Ford: There's only one thing I want from you. Give Tess a divorce.",
        "Cutter: A divorce? Why the hell would I do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I'm going to go and call St. Ann's, see how Tess is doing. Hey, Bo. How's Matthew?",
        "Bo: It looks like we got a miracle, Viki. He's coming around.",
        "Viki: Oh! That's so wonderful.",
        "Bo: Hand it to Nora. She never lost faith. We don't know for a fact that he's gonna make a full recovery --",
        "Viki: But he's turned the corner and with time and all the medical advances --",
        "Bo: That's why we're hopeful.",
        "Viki: That's wonderful.",
        "Clint: So I guess I won't be getting Matthew's heart. That's why you're here, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Degroff: Did your patient get that heart from his nephew?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: No. The nephew seems to be recovering, which is terrific, but Clint Buchanan -- the L-vad only bought him a few days. I don't know how much longer I can hold him.",
        "Dr. Degroff: Can I take a look at his chart?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: You have a possible donor?",
        "Dr. Degroff: I might.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I know, honey. It makes no sense. How could she be dying? She looks so perfect -- like sleeping beauty.",
        "Rex: But she's not gonna wake up. No matter what we do -- or how much we want her to. Oh, God. I gotta get it together. For Shane. How am I gonna tell him his mother isn't coming back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Tess, how did you get out of St. Ann's?",
        "Jessica: I'm not Tess. I'm Jessica. What the hell are you doing in bed with my fianc\u00e9?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd's voice: Starr has a mother. Her name is Blair.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Blair: Hello? Who's there?",
        "Starr: It's just me.",
        "Blair: Starr, you scared me to death.",
        "Starr: What are you doing out here? Drinking alone, looking at that old photo.",
        "Blair: Actually, John gave it back to me and it just got me to wondering if maybe the one great love of my life was your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How did you get out? Does Mom know? I thought --",
        "Jessica: That I was safely locked up?",
        "Brody: That's not Jessica -- it's Tess. She must've broken out.",
        "Jessica: What is it? You don't know me anymore? Is that it? Tell him, Natalie. You know it's me, right? I'm back. I fought my way back. It was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do, but I was trying to get home to you because I thought that you loved me. I thought that you were waiting for me. I thought that you'd be happy to see me, not grabbing the phone to call St. Ann's so you could crawl back in bed with my sister!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Nora told me that you didn't want Matthew's heart.",
        "Clint: I don't.",
        "Bo: Then I thought you'd want to know that he's coming around.",
        "Clint: And I couldn't be happier for that. I didn't want to die knowing that we had lost him.",
        "Viki: Well. It seems that we've all been given another chance.",
        "Bo: Clint, we've been on the opposite side of the fence for a while now. I know why you made that confession, and I appreciate it. And I hope now that you'll reconsider reconciling with Balsom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How am I gonna do this, Morasco? You gotta help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Is it a match?",
        "Dr. Degroff: My patient's heart is the right blood type and size. It's in great condition -- even with the carbon monoxide poisoning. All in all, a good match. But it's a real shame. The donor's a young mother -- she was supposed to get married tonight, but she was brain dead when she got here. The family's in shock.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: That's terrible. But if Clint Buchanan doesn't find a heart soon, his family's gonna lose him, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I don't want to talk about Rex Balsom. But I am happy about Matthew. I love that boy so much.",
        "Bo: I know you do. You went the distance for him.",
        "Clint: Yeah. At least I got something right.",
        "Bo: Is there any word on a heart donor?",
        "Clint: No. And they tell me that my time is about up.",
        "Bo: I'm sorry to hear that. I want you to know no matter what's happened, you're still my brother, and this breaks my heart. I'm sorry.",
        "Clint: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How could you do this to me?",
        "Natalie: Jess, just calm down. Brody, call Dr. --",
        "Jessica: No. No. Don't you dare blame this on my illness. You swore to me that there was nothing going on. You said that it was just one drunken night. And you said that you had given up on me and that you had given up on John.",
        "Natalie: That is all it was.",
        "Jessica: Then what the hell is this? Huh? You said that you loved me. Both of you swore that you loved me. How could you do this to me? [Cries]",
        "Natalie: Jess, are you ok?",
        "Jessica: Ford was right. Last time I came out, he told me. He told me that this was gonna happen. He said that you two were living together and that you were taking care of Liam and that it was only a matter of time -- before you two hooked up again. You begged me to come back. Why? Why did you beg me to come back? For this? Ford was right. You're not worth it. Neither of you are worth it. Only this time, I'm not hiding. I'm gonna stick around and make you pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: All right. Look. The Buchanans gave you this house and all the money you could ever need. What more would you want?",
        "Cutter: I'm sure I'll think of something. But hey, listen -- I'm a fair guy. So you want her that badly, you make me an offer. And hot dogs on the house ain't gonna cut it.",
        "Ford: I don't have anything that you could possibly want.",
        "Cutter: Then why would I divorce my cash cow and let her run wild with you?",
        "Ford: Because you don't love her, and I do.",
        "Cutter: Love's overrated.",
        "Ford: Sure. Absolutely. Yes. If you don't have it. But Tess and I love each other. She needs me. And our son needs her. You could put this whole family back together again. Just let her go.",
        "Cutter: Sorry, pal. No can do.",
        "Rama: Of course, you can.",
        "Cutter: You stay out of this.",
        "Rama: Let me speak to him. I'm sure I can soften his hard heart.",
        "Ford: Thank you.",
        "Rama: You let her go, or I'll tell everyone what I know about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: There's not gonna be any last-minute miracle. Not for me. And that's ok, because I've made my peace with it.",
        "Viki: I haven't.",
        "Clint: Please. It would make it so much easier on me.",
        "Viki: For me to give up? Too bad.",
        "Clint: You're denying -- a dying man his last request?",
        "Viki: Let's put it this way. I have not given up. So as far as I'm concerned, you're not a dying man. Which would mean that I'm only denying your request, not your last request.",
        "Clint: You always were an impossible woman.",
        "Viki: Ha ha! And you're a walk in the park.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Balsom. What are you doing here? Is it Shane?",
        "Rex: No. It's Gigi.",
        "Bo: I don't understand. I thought you were getting married today.",
        "Rex: She never showed. She found this message left for Shane -- inviting him to some party. Only it was a trick. Jack Manning, he tried to stonewall me, but I know that it was him. He's been sending Shane these fake messages pretending to be some girl who likes Shane. Gigi must've found it and wanted to confront him. But by the time I figured it out, it was too late. Gigi, she got locked in this basement, and there was a broken generator, and it was leaking carbon monoxide. Bo, she tried to stuff the leak -- she knew she was dying. She was all alone, but she knew.",
        "Bo: Oh, God, Balsom.",
        "Rex: Doctor said it was too late. By the time I got to her, she was already brain dead. She's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: How old were you in that picture? You look about 15.",
        "Clint: Ha ha!",
        "Viki: Oh, my -- do you know what? Matthew looks a little bit like you. Look how skinny you were.",
        "Clint: Are you sure that's not Bo?",
        "Viki: No. It's you. That's Bo.",
        "Clint: Whoever told him that bangs were a good idea?",
        "Viki: Oh, give him a break. It was the Beatles era.",
        "Clint: Ha ha ha!",
        "Viki: Hi.",
        "Joey: You're both smiling. That's a little different. Oh, please tell me it's good news.",
        "Viki: We're just reminiscing.",
        "Clint: Yes. The good news is that you're here. And the great news is that Matthew, he's made a comeback.",
        "Viki: Seems to be.",
        "Joey: That's terrific! What about getting you a new heart?",
        "Clint: Well, I'm not holding my breath about it.",
        "Viki: Doctor. Any news?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: We just may have found a match.",
        "Viki: See?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I don't know what I'm gonna do without her.",
        "Bo: I'm so sorry. I was crazy about Gigi. She's so strong. Whatever's on her mind, she'll just tell you straight up. Whatever. I loved that about her.",
        "Rex: Me, too. Even when I didn't.",
        "Bo: Look, whatever you need, you just name it. Ok? Is there anything I can do?",
        "Rex: I asked her to send me a sign. She sent me you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jess, you're back, and that is the most important thing. We just want to make sure you're ok.",
        "Jessica: Now you care about me?",
        "Natalie: Of course, I do. I have always cared bout you. We both do. Jess, look, I -- I get it. I understand that this is overwhelming, and you have every right to be angry, but I think you need to hear us explain.",
        "Jessica: What? That John couldn't forgive you for sleeping with Brody and for pretending that Liam was his? You lost your fianc\u00e9, so why not take mine? I know you, Natalie. I know how you think.",
        "Natalie: That's not what happened.",
        "Jessica: Really? So how long has this not been happening?",
        "Natalie: Tonight was the first time. Look, Jessica, I have been waiting for John. And I know that Brody's been waiting for you, and when the ECT didn't work -- I'm sorry. We both lost hope.",
        "Jessica: Translation -- Brody had a weak moment, and you moved right on in.",
        "Brody: Don't blame Natalie.",
        "Jessica: Don't worry. I blame you, too.",
        "Brody: Fair enough. Because I blame you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: You know what, Rama? All these threats of yours are getting old. I'm starting to think you're not gonna go through with it.",
        "Rama: Then, my friend, you are underestimating me.",
        "Cutter: Ok. How about this -- you rat me out and I tell that fool of a husband that you're not pregnant with that child that he's so happy about and you never were.",
        "Rama: I'm sure I can find a way to make it up to him.",
        "Cutter: I'm sure he's gonna be so understanding when he finds out about Cristian Vega.",
        "Rama: Finds out what? That Cristian Vega is besotted with me? He already knows that. Face facts, Cutter. You have far more to lose than I do. So you're gonna take that deal and divorce Tess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You blame me?",
        "Brody: You heard me.",
        "Jessica: You slept with my sister last year when I wasn't myself. You lied to me.",
        "Brody: I was wrong not to tell you. I've admitted that. I've apologized for it and I've paid for it. I lost Ryder. I lost you.",
        "Jessica: So you just move on with Natalie? With my sister?",
        "Brody: Do you have any idea how many times I begged you to put up a fight, to take a chance and to come back to me? How many times I apologized to you? I would try to get through to you, and it was not easy with Tess spitting in my face. I would look you in the eyes, and I would pour my heart out. Nothing, nothing worked. Not begging you, not the therapy, not even the ECT, and that was it for me. Your mother didn't want to put Tess through another round, and since you were making no effort to help yourself or to help your family or to help me -- that's when, yeah, I -- I moved on. What choice did I have?",
        "Jessica: What about me? What choice did I have? I was trapped.",
        "Brody: The hell you were. That's the biggest load of bull I've ever heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Come on, baby. Sit down. You know, I am really trying to give Tom\u00e1s a chance.",
        "Starr: What happened, Mom?",
        "Blair: He went off to New York, supposedly to see some gallery owner.",
        "Starr: And you don't think that's what he's doing?",
        "Blair: I don't know. When he was on the phone, I heard him before I left, and it really didn't sound like he was doing business to me.",
        "Starr: What did it sound like?",
        "Blair: That's what I don't know. I get a feeling that he's lying to me, and I've felt that way ever since I met him in Paris.",
        "Starr: Since you asked him about the painting?",
        "Blair: Exactly. It's strange. He paints a portrait of me from a photograph. This photograph of me and your father on our wedding day. That he finds at a flea market in Europe?",
        "Starr: Yes. It's strange, but you knew all about this before, so what's making you doubt him now?",
        "Blair: I just got it back and -- I just started wondering. Look at this. Look how happy. I just loved that wedding day. Look how happy I was. I really was happy the day that I married your dad. Mm. Makes me wonder if I'm ever gonna be that happy again. You know, and if I set aside my doubts about Tom\u00e1s, then I think maybe I could be.",
        "Starr: Of course, you can be.",
        "Blair: Then he goes off and does something like rushes off to New York without really being upfront with me about why, and then -- I know I'm probably just being cautious since Eli, but I just don't know how I can move on with Tom\u00e1s until I get some answers.",
        "Starr: What are you gonna do about it?",
        "Blair: What am I gonna do about it? I think I'm gonna go to New York and get the answers that I'm looking for. Surprise him.",
        "Starr: I wouldn't expect anything less.",
        "Blair: I probably have time to catch a train now.",
        "Starr: All right, so -- oh, you know what? Why don't I drop you off at the station on my way to go meet up with James?",
        "Blair: I want to remind you that Sunday is Father's Day.",
        "Starr: I know. You don't have to remind me.",
        "Blair: Well, I know that you know, but I want you to remind your brother Jack, ok? And then I know Sam made a really special gift for your dad. Will you help give it to him?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I will. Did you know that Sam has an imaginary friend?",
        "Blair: Since when?",
        "Starr: This afternoon, I heard Sam talking to someone out here. When I came out, they were gone.",
        "Blair: Well, Sam does have a very vivid imagination.",
        "Starr: Tell me about it. He even described this man. He said he had a line on his face.",
        "Blair: A line? What did he mean by that?",
        "Starr: When I asked him -- he went like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Ok, why don't we all just cool down a little?",
        "Jessica: Why don't you give me 5 minutes alone with my fianc\u00e9 -- now that you've slept with him -- again. You think I wanted Tess to come out? I have a disease. I was sick.",
        "Brody: I know a thing or two about mental illness, Jessica. I've been there. And I'm not saying it's easy, but don't tell me you didn't have a choice. You chose to hide behind Tess. You used her to punish me.",
        "Jessica: That's not true.",
        "Brody: Oh, no? You let her out, and then you used her to throw yourself at Ford. It wasn't enough that you had his child. You had to have him, too.",
        "Jessica: Ford is involved with Tess. He's Ryder's father!",
        "Brody: You did not care about Ryder. All you wanted was the trust fund. I almost feel sorry for Ford. At least he cared about his son. Not you. The minute Ford wouldn't do what you wanted to do, you dumped him, and you moved on to Cutter Wentworth.",
        "Jessica: I don't know anything about Cutter.",
        "Brody: You married him. After you divorced Ford.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Brody: That's right. You married Ford so your family couldn't put you in treatment. And you married Cutter. Our wedding never happened, but you've been married twice since then to two different men.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: I don't know what she told you, but I haven't agreed to anything.",
        "Rama: Really? Huh. Then I guess it's time to make a few calls. Let me see. Who do I call first? I know -- the police.",
        "Cutter: All right, fine. You want to marry the wackjob, be my guest. I'll divorce her. Now get out of my house.",
        "Ford: How do I know that you're gonna keep your word?",
        "Cutter: You don't.",
        "Ford: You son of a bitch.",
        "Rama: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. There's no need for violence. There's a simple solution. The Buchanan attorneys have already sent Cutter the divorce papers. All he needs to do is sign them.",
        "Cutter: Thanks -- for nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It wasn't me. Whatever happened, it wasn't me. It was Tess.",
        "Brody: Tess is not a get-out-of- jail-free card. She is part of you. She is the mean, angry, hateful part of you.",
        "Jessica: That's not fair.",
        "Brody: Oh, no? The man who killed that boy in Iraq, who kidnapped Shane, he is part of me. But I take responsibility. I get on my knees every day, and I pray for the strength to live a good life.",
        "Jessica: A good life? By sleeping with my sister?",
        "Brody: At least I don't wallow in my mistakes or use my illness to get back at people. You have been -- punishing me for months. I have found you in parking lots and motel rooms. Bars. You even turned into a guy one night and hit on Aubrey and Rama.",
        "Jessica: That's not true.",
        "Brody: Oh, no? His name was Wes. You even used my dead best friend to hurt me. And now that you're back, it's ok, because Jessica would never do that. Well, I got news for you. Tess is as much a part of you as that sweet and caring woman that I fell in love with, and that is why I hung in there. That is why I was just willing you to grow up. But no. You forgot about your kids, your mom and dad. We all needed you. I needed you. And that's why I turned to Natalie, because you weren't there.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's convenient.",
        "Brody: It's the truth. Liam was kidnapped. He was gone for days -- held hostage by a madwoman. I had no one to turn to except Natalie. So yeah, we got closer, and then the ECT didn't work. I gave up. I gave up on you, Jessica. And I made the decision to move on, because I was dying inside and hoping and praying and getting slapped down and humiliated. I couldn't take it anymore. And I'm sorry if we hurt you, but that's the truth.",
        "Jessica: You can go to hell. You and Natalie, you can go straight to hell.",
        "Brody: Where are you going?",
        "Jessica: To see my kids. Not like it's any of your business anymore.",
        "Natalie: Hey. You ok?",
        "Brody: I had to tell her how I felt.",
        "Natalie: Of course, you did.",
        "Brody: I didn't -- I didn't mean to hurt her.",
        "Natalie: I know. I know. Neither of us did. Brody, what are we gonna do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Those look so good, don't they? Hey, I have an idea. We should totally have a tea party and invite all your dolls. What do you think about that?",
        "[Ryder fussing]",
        "Aubrey: Sweetie, I love you, too.",
        "Bree: Mommy!",
        "Aubrey: Tess, do you think this is a good idea?",
        "Jessica: No. It's ok, Aubrey. It's me. I'm Jessica. I'm back. Look at you. You're so big, and you're so pretty.",
        "Bree: I'm much bigger than Ryder.",
        "Jessica: Ryder.",
        "Aubrey: You know what? We should just call your mom and make sure this is ok.",
        "Jessica: Aubrey, it's ok. I understand you're being protective, but this is my son, and he needs me. Hi! Oh, my goodness. Hello! Hello, my little boy. Oh! Oh! How could Mommy have ever left you, huh? Huh? But I'm back. I'm home.",

        "Joey: That's great news! What is the timetable for the transplant?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: As luck would have it, the donor's in the E.R.",

        "Bo: I understand what you're having to go through right now, but you have to be strong for your son. You gotta show him that he can get through this.",
        "Rex: I can't fake it for Shane. He always knows how I'm feeling. And I have got to tell you, I do not feel so strong right now. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this without her.",

        "Rex: No. No, she doesn't need surgery. She was breathing carbon monoxide.",
        "Shane: That's poison. I know.",
