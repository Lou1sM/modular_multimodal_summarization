    "Recap": [
        "Cole goes over and discovers for the first time that Marcie brought the baby back to Starr and is ok with them raising her. But he hesitates to tell her what will happen now that he has to go to prison. Dorian is really happy. But they all wonder what will happen now that Blair and Todd must live together under the same roof. Tea finds that out and is not certain what to do. Markko and Langston are being watched over by his father. He tells his father that he won't be prevented from being with the girl he loves. He'll live on his own and work ten jobs if need be. Langston then tells Dorian if she is really sorry for the mess she made, then she needs to \"fix it\" for Langston and Markko. Schuyler gets the DNA test results that prove that Stacy did not save Shane's life. And he encourages Gigi to \"use\" it. But she knows that she still hasn't a clue who the real donor is and only Stacy knows that. But he informs her that so does Kyle Lewis. She then tells him she will find out from Kyle no matter what it takes. Rex and Stacy are right then getting closer while he is trying to get over Gigi."

        "Gigi: I've been going nuts. What happened with the lab?",
        "Schuyler: I, uh -- I got the results.",
        "Gigi: And?",
        "Schuyler: Stacy is not the one who saved Shane. We have definitive proof.",
        "Gigi: Yay!",
        "Girl: Stop!",
        "Markko: Do you guys need any more towels?",
        "Boy: Markko?",
        "Girl: Didn't you just serve me a breakfast burrito?",
        "Boy: Dude, take a break.",
        "Markko: I can't. I need the cash.",
        "Girl: Well, in that case, can I have another virgin daiquiri, please?",
        "Markko: Lang!",
        "Langston: Where have you been? I left you, like, 12 messages.",
        "Markko: I'm sorry. My dad drove over my cell phone.",
        "Langston: On purpose?",
        "Markko: He said it was the only way to make sure I didn't use it to lie to him and my mom.",
        "Langston: They're still pissed.",
        "Markko: Yeah, that's an understatement. Dorian pretty much ended life as we know it when she -- she told them that we had sex.",
        "Blair: Rise and shine. Wakey, wakey! Why are you sleeping in?",
        "Dorian: Do you have to be so loud?",
        "Blair: Are you sick?",
        "Dorian: As a dog.",
        "Blair: Well, did something happen at Langston's party?",
        "Dorian: I blame the churros.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Dorian: Yeah.",
        "[Hope fusses]",
        "Dorian: Okay, fine. I had perhaps a tad too much to drink.",
        "Blair: Hmm, so you brought this all on yourself, did you?",
        "Dorian: Oh -- so, I won't be getting any sympathy from you, will I?",
        "Blair: Not a bit from me.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank you. Well, why don't you just quietly close the door on your way out. Thank you, and for goodness sakes close the drapes. And whatever it is, I'm begging you, that sounds like a baby crying, make it stop.",
        "[Hope crying]",
        "Cole: What do I do now?",
        "Starr: Welcome to parenthood, papa. I just fed her and burped her. She probably needs to be changed.",
        "Cole: You know how to do that, right?",
        "Starr: Well, I'm going to go get a diaper and then you are going to do it.",
        "Cole: Oh, I never changed a diaper before.",
        "Starr: Well, in a few days, you'll be an expert.",
        "Cole: I don't have a few days. What am I supposed to do, Hope? Hmm? How am I going to tell mommy that I have to go to jail?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Shh!",
        "Blair: It is a baby crying. It's Hope.",
        "Dorian: Oh, perfect. So every time that child starts crying, Marcie is going to bring it over here?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, Marcie brought the baby over here yesterday when she gave Starr back the baby.",
        "[Hope fusses]",
        "Dorian: What did you say?",
        "Blair: Hope is here, Dorian. Marcie knew how hard it was for Starr to give her up so she brought her back here yesterday and tore up the adoption papers.",
        "Dorian: So Hope's Starr's forever?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Oh! I'm just so happy. I'm so happy. [Sobs] Okay. Now we stop Todd from ruining that precious baby like the same way he has so many others.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: How you feeling? Oh, you haven't touched your cherry toaster tarts. You should. They've got flavonoids and things. Hey, you have to eat. You almost died. Come on. Come on, I told you I'd make it up to you. I'm trying to make it up to you.",
        "T\u00e9a: With cherry toaster tarts?",
        "Todd: I can get you a different flavor if that's the issue.",
        "T\u00e9a: Great. That takes care of breakfast, Todd. Now, how are you going to keep me from losing the career I love because of you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So there's no mistake? The test proves that Stacy lied?",
        "Schuyler: It's all right there in black and white.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God. Subject \"a\" is incompatible with subject \"b.\"",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, that's a fancy way of saying that Stacy's DNA doesn't match. She couldn't have saved Shane.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler Joplin, I could kiss you right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Fetch! Good girl. Pick up the ball. Pick up the ball. You didn't bring the ball back. You didn't bring the ball back. Go get the ball. Go ahead.",
        "Oliver: Excuse me, ma'am. I'm going to have to issue you a summons. You're in violation of the leash law.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: That was fun. Wasn't it, daddy?",
        "Cole: I thought I was going to be grossed out but I wasn't.",
        "Starr: Well, she needs us for everything. That's the deal.",
        "Cole: She's so beautiful.",
        "Starr: She is, isn't she?",
        "Cole: She looks like you. I can't believe she's really ours.",
        "Starr: Well, she is, forever and ever. Just like we dreamed when we ran away together. You and me raising our baby together.",
        "Cole: Starr, I can't raise our baby with you. Not right now, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh. Listen, here you go.",
        "Dorian: Oh, honey, thank you so much.",
        "Blair: You are welcome. Todd doesn't know about the baby. Starr wants to tell Cole first, okay?",
        "Dorian: I don't suppose we could convince her to stop right there.",
        "Blair: Look, he's going to find out sooner or later.",
        "Dorian: All right, then. What I'll do is I'll make sure that Shaun keeps Todd away from that precious ba --.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: I fired Shaun last night.",
        "Blair: Why in the world would you do that?",
        "Dorian: Just -- I -- I -- please don't yell at me. Whatever you do, just don't yell at me. I need to focus here, okay? We have to find a way to keep Todd away from Cole, Starr, the precious baby. You know, Todd, that slug that you married several times?",
        "Blair: Listen, I think a slug is even smart enough to know not to try to steal a baby yet again.",
        "Dorian: Oh, he's on a roll now. He's got custody of Jack and Sam, and believe me, I've got my lawyers on that.",
        "Blair: Well, I hate to make your day worse, but yesterday there was a custody hearing.",
        "Dorian: What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I got somebody to make sure you don't get disbarred. The best lawyer in Pennsylvania.",
        "T\u00e9a: I am the best lawyer in Pennsylvania.",
        "Todd: All right, I'll call him and tell him we don't need him.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what would help, maybe a magician. Can you find me one of those, Todd? Because I'm going to need one. According to the Pennsylvania bylaws, I am going to be disbarred, never allowed to practice law again. Thank you very much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: The judge found out that my marriage to John wasn't for real.",
        "Dorian: How?",
        "Blair: Well, Todd taped a private conversation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Everyone in that courtroom heard me admit that I orchestrated Blair's marriage to keep you from winning custody.",
        "Dorian: Good heavens. He didn't get custody of the children?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't give a damn that you destroyed my career, do you? You don't give a damn that you destroyed it. All you care about is that you have custody of your kids and Blair doesn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: No, Todd didn't win.",
        "Dorian: Well, if he didn't, then did you?",
        "Blair: Neither did I. The judge said that we could share custody of the children as long as we live under the same roof.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Speaking of which, for someone who beat both his ex-wife and John McBain, you don't seem so happy. I have a feeling there's something you're not telling me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, you are not going to believe what that was about.",
        "Rex: I don't care. I just thought we'd come here to tell you where Shane is in case you were interested.",
        "Gigi: Of course, I'm interested.",
        "Rex: Bo and Matthew took him for a hot fudge sundae. His solo was awesome.",
        "Gigi: He was good?",
        "Rex: He was great.",
        "Stacy: We had an amazing time. You should have been there.",
        "Gigi: I will be tonight.",
        "Stacy: Oh, right. Is Schuyler going with you or are you taking Brody?",
        "Gigi: You really don't have a clue, do you?",
        "Stacy: What? I just figured you'd enjoy it more with someone else, that's all -- like me and Rex.",
        "Rex: Come on. We should get out of here.",
        "Gigi: Wait! I have something to tell you -- both of you.",
        "Rex: I really don't need to know why you had your hands all over Schuyler just now.",
        "Gigi: Please, Rex. I have something important to tell you. I just got some news.",
        "Rex: Is it Shane? I thought his last test results came back clean.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, they did.",
        "Rex: Okay, then what is it? What's wrong with him?",
        "Gigi: Nothing. Nothing's wrong with Shane. I wanted to tell you --",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: Um, he got accepted to baseball camp, and his oncologist said that he could go.",
        "Rex: Oh. Okay, that's good. Is that it?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, that's it.",
        "Rex: Okay, good. Well, we'll leave you two alone.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, why didn't you tell Rex the truth about Stacy?",
        "Gigi: I couldn't, and I don't think I ever can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: How on earth can that judge expect you to move under the same roof as with Todd?",
        "Blair: Look, he thinks if we're both living with the kids, then we'll stop fighting over them.",
        "Dorian: He's the one who has been throwing the punches. You've just been defending yourself.",
        "Blair: Look, I'm just telling you it's serious here. The judge says that Todd and I have to get along or he's going to put our children in foster care, okay?",
        "Dorian: Oh, my --",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: No! Not if my lawyers have anything to do with it.",
        "Blair: Dorian, I appreciate what you are trying to do, but I've been on the phone all morning trying to convince that judge to change his mind.",
        "Dorian: And what happened? What?",
        "Blair: He wouldn't even consider it, all right?",
        "Dorian: So, now what do we do?",
        "Blair: Well, now I have to move in with Todd. I mean, today.",
        "Dorian: Oh, God.",
        "[Dorian sniffles]",
        "Dorian: I'm really going to need one of those hangover remedies that Moe makes.",
        "Blair: All right, well, I'll have him whip you up one.",
        "Dorian: You can't.",
        "Blair: It's not going to be that big a deal. He'll be glad to do it for you.",
        "Dorian: I kicked him and Noelle out of this house yesterday.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: Well, I don't have time to go into all of it.",
        "Blair: Dorian, you kicked Noelle and Moe out? And you fired Shaun? What happened at the party?",
        "Dorian: You can't leave me! You cannot leave me alone in this house.",
        "Blair: You're not going to be alone. You'll have Langston, okay? What happened with Langston?",
        "Dorian: We had a few words.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, \"a few words\"? What?",
        "Dorian: Well, I told you that last night I had a little bit too much to drink. All right, I had a lot too much to drink, and I totally lost control and now she absolutely hates me, okay? And the last thing I recollect is she pushed me into the pool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Okay, I know Dorian was wasted and said way too much, but it wouldn't have mattered if your parents weren't from the dark ages.",
        "Markko: I told you. Why do you think it took me so long to --",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Markko: Buy condoms? Look, my parents will calm down, I promise.",
        "Langston: Are you sure?",
        "Markko: Sort of.",
        "Langston: You know who started this whole thing? My Uncle Ray. None of this would have happened if Dorian still had a man on a leash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I don't want you moving in with Todd.",
        "Blair: Do you not hear me? I don't have a choice here. That's what the judge ruled.",
        "Dorian: Yes, you do have a choice. Damn it, have him move in here. Gosh.",
        "Blair: Oh, you want my slug of an ex-husband living under your roof again?",
        "Dorian: Oh, really. It's just a strategy, Blair. You need home court advantage, and here, you have got something that Todd can never take away from you.",
        "Blair: And what's that?",
        "Dorian: Me. Honey, you really don't want Starr to have to fight off her father every time that Cole wants to come and see that baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Why do you think that we can't raise Hope together?",
        "Cole: No, it's --",
        "Starr: I can understand about my dad because of everything that's happened, but he has gotten better about you. And he's realized that his stupid plan to steal our baby was the reason why all this happened to her.",
        "Cole: Do you really think he knows that?",
        "Starr: I haven't told him that I have her back yet.",
        "Cole: Wait, what? You haven't?",
        "Starr: Cole, we're talking about my dad, here. The second he finds out that I am raising his granddaughter, he could go completely psycho again.",
        "[Hope fusses]",
        "Starr: But you know what? Things are different now. Marcie gave her back to us. I am her mother and you are her father.",
        "Cole: And nothing can change that.",
        "Starr: Right. We will raise Hope together, Cole. And even if my dad tries to stop us, we will fight back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, everything's great. I've got custody of my kids. I feel terrific.",
        "T\u00e9a: Nothing happened at Blair's last night?",
        "Todd: You know, actually, we don't have time for this. You have to get in the shower.",
        "T\u00e9a: Excuse me?",
        "Todd: I made you an appointment with that lawyer. Come on, let's go. I'll help you.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're going to help me shower? Keep dreaming.",
        "Todd: It's not as if I haven't seen everything already.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you never will again.",
        "Todd: But I'm the love of your life.",
        "T\u00e9a: If you say that one more time, I swear to you --",
        "Todd: Love of your life.",
        "T\u00e9a: I will beat you so badly that you won't remember your own name.",
        "Todd: How are you going to beat me?",
        "T\u00e9a: How am I going to beat you?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'll show you how I'm going to beat you.",
        "Todd: That'll be good. Yeah, you're a real badass. See? You need me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr, listen.",
        "Starr: You're still worried?",
        "Cole: Your dad is not the reason that we can't raise Hope together. Not for right now, anyway.",
        "Starr: Okay, then what's the problem?",
        "Cole: I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You didn't think I'd actually issue a ticket for not having your dog on a leash, did you?",
        "Layla: Yeah, that was pretty darn funny, Fish.",
        "Oliver: Oh, come on. I was just giving you a hard time.",
        "Layla: Why? You have a problem with the apartment or Cristian or me?",
        "Oliver: No, no. Are you kidding? I actually think it's going really well, don't you?",
        "Layla: I did.",
        "Oliver: Look, if you're still hung up about that whole Stacy Morasco thing --",
        "Layla: What? No. That's ancient history.",
        "Oliver: Right. It's not just ancient, it's prehistoric.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Every time I see Gigi she's pressed up against some guy.",
        "Stacy: Ha ha. She sure gets around, doesn't she?",
        "Rex: Bo says she might have been acting crazy because she was so scared about Shane.",
        "Stacy: Ah, well, I've never heard of fear turning someone into a tramp.",
        "Rex: She's no tramp! That's why this doesn't make any sense.",
        "Stacy: Okay, well, didn't you catch her in bed with Brody?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Stacy: And when you got to his house, was she not in his shower? And how many times have you seen them together since? Now Schuyler?",
        "[Stacy scoffs]",
        "Rex: This really isn't making me feel any better.",
        "Stacy: Look, Rex. I'm not trying to. I mean, I'm sorry Gigi left you, but the sooner you can accept this, the sooner you'll start feeling better.",
        "Rex: I don't know.",
        "Stacy: Well, I do. The sooner you can forget about this relationship, you'll finally start feeling some happiness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, what are you talking about? Of course you can tell Rex the truth about Stacy.",
        "Gigi: I wanted to. I wanted to bust her more than anything. I had it all planned out.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so why didn't you do it?",
        "Gigi: When Rex started talking about Shane maybe being sick again, the look on his face, it got me thinking. What if Shane really does have a relapse?",
        "Schuyler: Well, Stacy couldn't do anything about that, so --",
        "Gigi: Stacy switched her stem cells for somebody else's. She must know who that somebody is. And if I tell everyone that she lied, what if she takes off or something?",
        "Schuyler: So, what? You're just -- you're just not going to ever tell Rex the truth?",
        "Gigi: Not until I can find a way to get Stacy to tell me who the real donor is. And she's my only shot at finding out.",
        "Schuyler: No, she's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Come here.",
        "Kyle: Hey. I was just out for a jog.",
        "Oliver: Glad to know you're not jumping bail.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I wasn't lying to you the other day, Fish. Uh, Schuyler Joplin really was harassing me.",
        "Oliver: Okay.",
        "Kyle: Not that I don't appreciate your saving my ass, but you know, this is all just a big misunderstanding.",
        "Oliver: You know, Kyle, I hear that a lot, especially when somebody is trying to get out of a crime they committed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How are you the reason we can't raise Hope together?",
        "Cole: Because I won't be around.",
        "Starr: I know you are living at the rehab center, and that's fine because you'll be spending all of your free time with Hope.",
        "Cole: Starr, I won't have any free time. I won't have any free anything.",
        "Dorian: Where is she? Where is our baby?",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Oh! Look at her! She has blue eyes just like you.",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "Dorian: Your mom told me all about it.",
        "Starr: So you know that we're keeping her?",
        "Dorian: Yes! And I couldn't be happier.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, Aunt Dorian, I'd like you to meet Hope. Hope, say bonjour to your aunt Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Oh, bonjour!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, you want to go to the movies when your shift ends?",
        "Markko: I can't.",
        "Langston: But I thought you said it was sexy sneaking around.",
        "Markko: Let's just say my dad made it real clear that my cell phone's not the only thing he can run over.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but you're 18.",
        "Markko: Yeah, and as long as a live under my parents' roof --",
        "Langston: Which won't be for much longer because you're going to college soon.",
        "Markko: I can't afford the dorm.",
        "Langston: You're living at home? What are we going to do?",
        "Markko: Look, just relax, okay? My parents will calm down.",
        "Langston: Promise?",
        "Markko: Promise.",
        "Ernesto: I thought your mother and I made ourselves clear.",
        "Markko: What? Are you following me?",

        "Schuyler: Why would he be loyal to Stacy?",
        "Gigi: Well, God knows what she promised him. We can't risk him warning her that we know everything because then she'll take off and we're back where we started -- with no donor for Shane.",

        "Markko: So, I'll move someplace else, you know? Maybe I'll get an apartment of my own.",
        "Langston: How, by winning the lottery?",
        "Markko: Look, Lang, I'll work 10 jobs if I have to. I'm going to see you.",
