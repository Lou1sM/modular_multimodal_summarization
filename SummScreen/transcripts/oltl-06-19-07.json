        "Blair: No.",
        "Marty: Is that why you're out in the rain -- trying to take a few minutes to forget about it?",
        "Blair: Oh, it's going to take a place further than The Palace Hotel Bar to forget about it. Dorian and David are back at La Boulaie having a knockdown dragout, and I just want to be out of the line of fire.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I heard on the news that he was released.",
        "Blair: Did they say why?",
        "David: Because John McBain believes that Spencer's real killer is still out there.",

        "Clint: Really?",
        "Viki: Yeah. They were interviewing John McBain outside of Statesville. Apparently, he's found some sort of evidence that indicates that David is -- is innocent. I mean, why on earth would he confess to murdering his brother if he didn't do it?",
        "Clint: David's always been strange.",
        "Viki: Oh, no, no, no -- David is allergic to difficult circumstances. None of this makes any sense at all. I mean, I -- I like him, so I'm glad he's not a murderer, but, you know, this is really strange.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, look, I have to get home and check on Asa and make sure the storm hasn't knocked out the electricity. Can you manage here by yourself?",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah, I'll be fine. Jessie's asleep and Nash is with her.",
        "Clint: Well, you know, I could drop you off at Llanfair on the way there, and with this weather, you really shouldn't be out on the roads.",

        "Bo: Hmm. Well, where were you headed in such a hurry?",
        "Cole: I'm trying to find Starr. She was supposed to be at our prom, but she never showed up. I don't know -- I think she might be in trouble.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I was on my way to the prom in Aunt Dorian's limo and we got a flat tire. There was no phone service, so the limo driver had to go and get help, but it was getting late, so I just decided to walk.",
        "Viki: In the rain?",
        "Starr: Yeah, in the rain and the wind blew my umbrella away and I fell in the mud, and then all of a sudden, I -- I saw my dad.",
        "Viki: Your father was there?",
        "Starr: He was standing right in front of me, and I must've fainted or something because one minute I was there, and then the next, I'm -- I'm here and I can't find him anywhere.",
        "Viki: Honey, you have to take it easy, ok?",
        "Starr: Did you see him? Well, he has to be around here!",
        "Viki: Darling, did -- did you hit your head when you fainted?",
        "Starr: No. Aunt Viki, he definitely got me and he brought me here. He wouldn't have just left!",
        "Driver: Miss Manning, I can't turn my back on you for a second.",
        "Viki: Who are you, please?",
        "Starr: Aunt Viki, meet my Aunt Dorian's limo driver.",
        "Driver: Hello.",
        "Viki: Excuse me -- you left her sitting in a car by the side of the road all alone? What were you thinking?",
        "Driver: No, I -- I told her to stay in the car and then when I started walking, I realized she might be scared, so I went back and I found her in the rain, and then she fainted.",
        "Starr: That's not what happened!",
        "Driver: Yes, it is. You wouldn't wake up, so I flagged down a passing car and I had them bring us here.",
        "Starr: No, no. Did -- did you see my dad?",
        "Driver: You called me \"Dad\" just before you fainted.",
        "Starr: No. No, Aunt Viki, he's lying!",
        "Viki: Oh, ok -- you know what? I'll -- I'll stay with her from now on.",
        "Driver: No, I can't leave her. Dr. Lord would have my head.",
        "Viki: It's all right -- I'm her aunt as well, and I will square it with Dr. Lord, I promise you. You need to go take care of your car anyway.",
        "Driver: You sure you're all right?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I've never been better.",
        "Viki: She's fine, she's fine. Thank you.",
        "Starr: Aunt Viki, you have to believe me. I saw my dad.",
        "Viki: I believe that you believe it, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: I'm not lying!",
        "Viki: Ok, ok. You know, sometimes I think when you really need somebody, they -- they just kind of show up, you know?",
        "Starr: I need him to be here so much.",
        "Viki: I know you do, baby. I know. And I wish he were here, too.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry I got you all dirty.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. I'm not going to melt. Listen, I'm going to find a doctor. I want them to check your face out, ok?",
        "Starr: No, I'm fine.",
        "Viki: Hey, humor me, all right? Go and sit down over there. Wait for me, I'll be right back. Don't leave.",

        "Clint: Yeah, I bet.",
        "Nigel: I don't know if you've heard, but David Vickers has been released from prison.",
        "Clint: Nigel, you know, don't you? That Asa paid David to kill Truman?",
        "Nigel: I'm afraid so.",
        "Clint: Damn fool -- never learn.",
        "Nigel: Do you think Mr. Vickers negotiated his release by ratting your father out, as it were?",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Clint: Hope not because pa will be going to prison for the rest of his life.",
        "Nigel: We cannot let that happen.",

        "[Thunder]",
        "Clint: This is classic Asa. So why am I surprised?",
        "Nigel: Because you want to believe the best of your father.",
        "Clint: Yeah, you'd think after all this time, I'd have wised up. Why in hell did he want Truman dead?",
        "Nigel: I really couldn't say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: David, is that what you and Dorian were fighting about? Did she kill Spencer and then tried to pay you to -- to keep quiet?",
        "David: Not exactly.",
        "Blair: You know, I don't even want to know about it. Is that Dorian's coat?",

        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Marty: What -- what are you doing here?",
        "David: I need a room for the night. Excuse me. What -- you're in my blind spot. Is Renee here?",

        "Starr: What, like what? He didn't want me to be with Cole? He never wanted me to be with him.",
        "Viki: What do you want?",
        "Starr: Does it matter?",
        "Viki: Of course it matters. Hey, the Starr I know would never ask that question.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, a lot has happened. Maybe I've changed.",
        "Viki: Honey, you've -- you've grown up, a lot. But you are still the same beautiful, smart, fearless girl that I've always known.",
        "Starr: I don't feel fearless.",
        "Viki: No, you don't. You know, your cousin Jessie -- she did the exact same thing to herself that you're doing now.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Viki: Well, she tried to deny her feelings and ignore what her heart was telling her.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Viki: \"Why?\" Hmm -- for a lot of good reasons, but the point is it didn't work. All those feelings found their way to the surface. The heart does not like to be ignored. Honey, listen to your heart, ok? And trust your old Aunt Viki on this one. Believe me, it'll save you a lot of time and aggravation in the long run.",
        "Starr: I'm so scared.",
        "Viki: Hey! There's nothing to be scared of. Just listen. What does your heart tell you?",

        "Marcie: I do not understand why you're being so stubborn about this.",
        "Markko: Well, what's in it for you, Mrs. McBain?",
        "Marcie: Oh, honestly, you kids drive me absolutely crazy. Do you know that? You and Langston are great together. And instead of doing something about it, you're sitting on your butt. Let me tell you something. Based on my life experience, you have to jump at that when you get a chance. None of us knows how long we have. Right?",
        "Markko: Talk about a buzz kill.",
        "Marcie: Please -- look at it like a permission slip for the things that you want. That is, if you are man enough to do it.",

        "Britney: Of course not. Come on, girls. We've got some business.",
        "Amber: Hey, Langley. Mrs. McBain's looking everywhere for you.",
        "Langston: She knows where I am.",
        "Britney: Yeah, well, she's running around the lobby asking everyone if they know where you are.",
        "Langston: Oh, great.",
        "Aimee: Should we use different handwriting?",
        "Britney: Yes.",
        "Aimee: Ok. No, you --",
        "Amber: No, you.",

        "Clint: Dorian's made a choice. And you lost.",
        "David: Come on, you're philanthrop-- you're philanthropo-- you're people who give other people money. Consider me a charity. You can write me off next April.",

        "Clint: He's the reason we're in this mess.",
        "Nigel: True.",
        "Clint: You know, there's another thing I don't understand. Why would pa trust a weasel like David in the first place?",
