        "When Cole informs Starr that he is sentenced to a mandatory 2 years in prison because they believe he violated his probation, she is devastated and tells him they must find him a lawyer, find a way to fight this and she promises she will never leave him. Knowing that they now have Hope, he then proposes to her. Blair, Todd and Tea are not certain what they will do now that the judge has ruled that Todd and Blair and the kids must live together under the same roof. Gigi goes to see if she can motivate Kyle Lewis to tell her who the real stem cell donor was that saved Shane's life. But he tells her that he needs her to get Natalie to drop the charges against him before he can provide that information. She then concludes she doesn't know what to do. Schuyler then notices that Roxy might also know their secret."

        "Rex: Mrs. Underhill?",
        "Stacy: Yes, Mr. Underhill?",
        "Rex: It is time to even out our tans.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Flip.",
        "Rex: You were right -- this is much better than sitting around being bummed all day.",
        "Stacy: Especially when it's on Mr. Underhill's tab. Ooh, I like the way you think.",
        "Rex: Well, thanks. Hey, you think we could get a hot rock massage in the Llantano River?",
        "Stacy: Maybe. This is the life, isn't it?",
        "Rex: It's much better than busting our asses at a day job, that's for sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Well, slutty enough for you?",
        "Schuyler: Ooh. Uh --",
        "Gigi: I'll take that as a \"yes.\"",
        "Schuyler: Yeah -- no, I'm sorry. It's very --",
        "Gigi: Trashy but sexy?",
        "Schuyler: Kind of.",
        "Gigi: Gee, thanks. I hope Kyle Lewis' standards aren't any higher than yours. Or I may never get him to confess who really saved Shane.",

        "[Door opens]",
        "Kyle: What the hell?",
        "Roxy: Don't get your jockstrap in a twist. I've seen it all before. And that -- thank God I'm not going to have to be looking at that anymore.",
        "Kyle: What?",
        "Roxy: It's moving day, buddy. You're out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Tell me exactly what the judge said to you.",
        "Todd: He said that Blair and I kind of have to --",
        "Blair: Live together.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is this some kind of a joke?",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "Blair: See, I don't think T\u00e9a understands. Maybe you should try saying it in espa\u00f1ol.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I swear, Blair. No me rompes los huevos, mujer.",
        "Blair: Sorry. No comprende.",
        "Todd: All right, you guys. Come on. T\u00e9a, don't pay any attention to her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, then explain what is going on. You two are living together?",
        "Todd: No, no, no. Not yet.",
        "Blair: Well, soon. See, me, Todd, and the kids are going to be under the same roof as one big happy family.",

        "Starr: You got arrested?",
        "Cole: Yesterday.",
        "Starr: Why? What happened?",
        "Cole: Remember when I told you after graduation I needed to get some air? I went down to the docks and -- and I ran into Asher there.",
        "Starr: Asher? You were talking to Asher?",
        "Cole: Yes, I told him I didn't want anything, but he put a bag of pills in my pocket anyway.",
        "Starr: Oh, my God.",
        "Cole: Starr, I swear I wasn't going to take them. I was throwing them into the river when the cop saw me.",
        "Starr: And then he arrested you?",
        "Cole: Yeah. So now I can't get out of it.",
        "Starr: What do you mean, you can't get out of it? Cole, what are you saying?",
        "Cole: I'm saying I have to go to prison.",
        "Starr: Prison?",
        "Cole: I'm so sorry.",
        "Starr: No, this -- this makes no sense. Cole, you can't be going to prison.",
        "Cole: I am. I have to leave you and our baby. I have to say goodbye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You have joint custody? How could the judge possibly think --",
        "Blair: Look and see.",
        "Todd: Go figure, right? The judge is nuts.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I was there, remember? When you got me disbarred.",
        "Blair: Actually, you missed some of the best parts. Actually, my favorite part was when the judge went on and on about your \"reprehensible\" relationship with the client. But you know what? Thank you so much, T\u00e9a, for proving my case.",
        "Todd: Blair, please. The judge also said we have to stop fighting about these kids and parent them together or he's going to put them in foster homes.",
        "T\u00e9a: Unless you two live together? Yeah, that will help matters.",
        "Todd: Do we have any other choice?",
        "T\u00e9a: You told me you won custody.",
        "Blair: Oh, Todd Manning lied to you? You must be shattered.",
        "Todd: I told you that the kids would be living with me. Technically, that's not a lie.",

        "Waiter: Can I get you something?",
        "Rex: Yes, we will have two lobster rolls, please, and a bottle of that one.",
        "Waiter: And the name on the account?",
        "Rex: Well, the Underhills. Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Have I mentioned that I think you shouldn't do this?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. But I know how Stacy got Kyle to help her. Sexing it up works, sorry to say.",
        "Schuyler: Not always.",
        "Gigi: Okay, let's see. Who does Stacy have wrapped around her finger? Kyle, you, that cop Fish. And she's going that route with Rex. I have to put a stop to that.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, what makes you so sure this is going to work?",
        "Gigi: Kyle's a man, isn't he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Second to last ad under \"rentals.\" Studio apartment, bathroom with a nice tub, working stove. Can't beat that, can you?",
        "Kyle: Sure, I can. Because this is free. So I think I'm just going to stay put.",
        "Roxy: Nothing comes for free. Someone always pays. People are beating down my door to get this place.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, and that's not my problem. Okay, the only concern I have is avoiding prison time. So until that's all sorted out, I'm not going anywhere. Unless, of course, you want to come clean and tell Rex who really saved your grandson's life.",
        "Roxy: You're killing me, you know that?",
        "Kyle: I don't get my kicks blackmailing people. But I don't really have a choice, now, do I? Okay, so, if you don't mind, I have company coming over and I need to get cleaned up.",
        "Roxy: You can air-dry. Like I said before, no free towels.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Are you sure you're going to be okay watching the place?",
        "Schuyler: Uh, yeah, I bartended in college, so --",
        "Gigi: I won't be long. I have to be back in time for Shane's concert.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, any specials I should know about?",
        "Gigi: We never have specials. Just don't be afraid to card anyone, and don't bother topping anyone off. It's not that kind of place. You sure I look okay?",
        "Schuyler: I think you've out-Staceyed Stacy.",
        "Gigi: All right.",
        "Schuyler: Hey, Gigi. You're not going to sleep with Kyle, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Uh, let's just hope I don't have to make that call.",
        "Starr: Cole, this can't be happening.",
        "Cole: Believe me, it is.",
        "Starr: No, there has to be some mistake.",
        "Cole: God, if I had just come back here with you last night. I would've been here when Marcie gave our baby back. Instead, I got my ass hauled into the police station. And now I have to leave you.",
        "Starr: No, you know what? You're just nervous because, you know, you haven't been to court yet. But it takes a while for there to be a trial, right?",
        "Cole: I already had a trial, and according to the cops, I broke the terms of my probation, and... now they're going to put me away.",
        "Starr: Oh, God. But it can't be for that long, right? I mean, we can deal with this. We've been through worse.",
        "Cole: Starr, it's not like that.",
        "Starr: What do you mean?",
        "Cole: I'm going away for a couple of years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So I left a part out. I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do? You were already upset. You couldn't move. You couldn't walk. I'm just trying to provide you a home, and that's what I did.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you lied to me because you cared about me? That is so sweet.",
        "Blair: No, Todd only cares about el numero uno.",
        "Todd: Okay, this really doesn't have to be a big deal. T\u00e9a, you get this room, as I promised. Blair, you can have a cot in the garage or something.",
        "Blair: Oh, you know what? That is what I have missed about you -- that dry wit of yours.",
        "Todd: I'll move the ping-pong table.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what? Wait just a damn minute here. You expect us all to live under the same roof?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Two years?",
        "Cole: Should have been five.",
        "Starr: Wait, didn't you tell them about Asher?",
        "Cole: Didn't matter.",
        "Starr: He's the one who's been selling kids drugs at school. He's the one who tried to get you hooked again.",
        "Cole: I know, I know. And I swear, I was going to throw those pills in the river.",
        "Starr: Trust me, Cole, I believe you.",
        "Cole: I wish the judge had. I was holding the stuff and that was enough.",
        "Starr: How did it get switched from five years to two years?",
        "Cole: Nora. She -- she went to bat for me. She got my sentence reduced. So if I keep my head down and don't get into any trouble, I can get paroled in a year.",
        "Starr: Did you have a lawyer?",
        "Cole: Starr --",
        "Starr: Listen, Cole, we have to do something. Because I just found you again and we just got our baby back. And I need you and Hope to be with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, for once, I agree with T\u00e9a here. You expect us all to live under the same roof? Todd, have you lost your mind?",
        "T\u00e9a: That's already been established.",
        "Todd: All right. There's plenty of room.",
        "Blair: You want to start your own commune, go right ahead. You can just count me out.",
        "Todd: Blair, the judge said we have to figure out a way --",
        "Blair: I know what the judge said, Todd. You, me, and the kids. Not you, me, the kids, and your slut lawyer here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Slut ex-lawyer.",
        "Todd: Have a little compassion. She's having a difficult time getting around. What are we supposed to do? Kick her out on the street?",
        "Blair: Oh, come on, Todd. You really think T\u00e9a is going to end up in a cardboard box? Come on, she's perfectly capable of fending for herself, and you can see that.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm going to make it a whole lot easier for everyone. Bye-bye.",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. Hold on -- no, no, no. Don't move. Hey, I made you a promise -- I'm going to make good on it. I don't know why Blair can't be civil about this. You know, that reminds me -- what happened to all that bonding you guys did?",
        "Blair: Okay, Todd, fine. Fine. Let T\u00e9a have the whole damn house, but I'm not living here, all right? And neither are you. You're coming home with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Why does it feel like a sauna in here?",
        "Cristian: Well, that's because the a/C's not working. Why do you think I stripped -- so I could show off?",
        "Layla: You can't flaunt what you don't got.",
        "Cristian: Ooh, that's funny. Very funny.",
        "Layla: The a/c works. You just have to jiggle it.",
        "Cristian: Okay, now I got it.",
        "Layla: And now you can set up in your room again.",
        "Cristian: You do realize there's no ventilation in there?",
        "Layla: Well, this is a living room, not an artist studio. And by the way, you might want to do some more crunches, because your abs are a little wobbly.",
        "Cristian: Oh, my goodness. Funny number two. Very --",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Cristian: Hey, Fish.",
        "Oliver: Hey. I'm going to -- I'm going to go change. I don't want to be late.",
        "Cristian: What was that about?",
        "Layla: Oliver and I have a date tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Running a con is a lot like poker.",
        "Stacy: Know when to hold 'em, and when to fold 'em?",
        "Rex: Yes. And if you get made --",
        "Stacy: Know when to run?",
        "Rex: Very good. And never underestimate a mark. For example, take Renee Divine.",
        "Stacy: Who's Renee Divine?",
        "Rex: Sweet lady, runs the Palace Hotel, but not young anymore. And let me tell you, that woman can still haul ass, even if she's waving an iron poker at you.",
        "Maitre d': You know Renee Divine?",
        "Rex: We're like that.",
        "Maitre d': It's common knowledge in the hospitality industry that Miss Divine has a lot of experience going after flimflam artists.",
        "Rex: Yeah, sure. Could you just -- you're blocking my rays.",
        "Maitre d': There's a problem with this order, Mr. --",
        "Rex: Underhill. No -- everything's great.",
        "Stacy: But did you not find our wine?",
        "Maitre d': That's the problem. Do you happen to know that the Mr. Underhill -- Leonard Underhill, Llanview's lion of liverwurst -- is allergic to white wine? Hmm, thought not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: One sec. Hi.",
        "Gigi: Hi there. What took you so long?",
        "Kyle: Sorry -- I was just taking a shower. So how are you?",
        "Gigi: Better now.",
        "Kyle: Why -- were you feeling under the weather or something?",
        "Gigi: No, I've just been thinking about you.",
        "Kyle: How so?",
        "Gigi: I owe you an apology.",
        "Kyle: What for?",
        "Gigi: Schuyler. I know he accused you of doing things to me and my son.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, it was -- it was pretty bad.",
        "Gigi: Right, about that --",
        "Kyle: Yeah, he was wrong -- what he was accusing me of. I could lose my right to practice medicine because of that.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, he's got a big mouth.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, right.",
        "Gigi: Uh, leave it off.",
        "Kyle: Uh, it's kind of cold in here.",
        "Gigi: Not for long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Yo, bartender, vodka stinger, rocks, please.",
        "Schuyler: Uh, want to -- want to walk me through that?",
        "Roxy: Ah, it's a newbie. Let me show you how it's done. Okay, you take a little vodka, then you add some cr\u00e8me de mint. Nah, screw that. Takes up too much room. Would you like one? You look like you need one.",
        "Schuyler: Uh, uh, no. No, thank you, I'm working.",
        "Roxy: Does Johnny know that he hired a bartender who doesn't know how to mix a drink?",
        "Schuyler: No, I'm -- I'm filling in for Gigi.",
        "Roxy: Oh. I didn't know you two were so chummy. I thought you had the hots for that slag heap of a sister.",
        "Schuyler: Uh, yeah, long time ago.",
        "Roxy: That was a yes or no kind of question. You know, love can be so much lustier the second time around. Maybe it's not too late to, uh, make a play for her.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I can't do that.",
        "Roxy: Why, because of Rex? Listen, what Stacy's selling, my Rexy ain't buying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, I am Leonard Underhill.",
        "Stacy: My Lenny here is the premier source. He's the go-to weather guy. He learned it all from his grandfather, \"The Lion,\" the man you were speaking of who's allergic to wine. This is Leonard the Third, Trey Underhill.",
        "Rex: My friends call me LT., but you can call me Mr. Underhill.",
        "Stacy: Ah, and I'm his wife, Sloane Peterson Underhill. Who are you?",
        "Maitre d': Edward Rooney, head waiter.",
        "Rex: Well, Rooney, Sloane and I are parched.",
        "Maitre d': I'll bring your wine immediately.",
        "Rex: See that you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I'm not going after Stacy.",
        "Roxy: Come on, Schuy, you know you want to. Rex isn't her type. But you? You know, some chicks really dig a guy who doesn't have a job. Hey, no, I'm serious about that. And those nasty habits that you used to have -- it kind of gives you this really edgy vibe. Rex is boring compared to you. Believe me, the two of them do not belong together.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so why are you worried, then? Because you just said that Rex would never go for her.",
        "Roxy: Well, normally, yes, but that bitch plays down and dirty and Rex just doesn't see it. I'm telling you, Stacy split up that family.",
        "Schuyler: Whoa. Now, the way I heard it was, Gigi cheated on Rex and ditched him, and she's the one who split up Rex's family. Isn't that right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Wow, that's quite an outfit.",
        "Gigi: Just a little something I threw on. You should see what else is in my closet.",
        "Kyle: This -- so this -- so this little get-up that you just threw on was just to come here and talk.",
        "Gigi: Who said anything about talking? Apologies don't always need words.",
        "Kyle: Apology accepted. Uh, thanks for coming by.",
        "Gigi: But Kyle, I just -- I feel so bad. I really want to make it up to you. The way my sister does.",
        "Kyle: What are you talking about?",
        "Gigi: I've seen you two together. I know how Stacy operates. \"I have something you want. You have something I want. Let's make a trade.\"",
        "Kyle: What can we trade? What could I possibly have to offer you?",
        "Gigi: I think we can figure something out.",
        "Kyle: Baby, I seriously doubt there's anything you have that would interest me.",
        "Gigi: Don't be so sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: This isn't fair. You didn't do anything wrong this time.",
        "Cole: You know what's coming up? Father's Day. Some dad I am, huh? Couple days of fatherhood and I'm going to the joint. For a whole year. Maybe two if I don't make parole.",
        "Starr: You will. You will --- everything's going to be all right.",
        "Cole: Wish I knew how to be more like you. Seeing everything positive. It just seems like every time I'm about to get something good -- you, my mom, our baby -- it just blows up in my face.",
        "Starr: Hey.",
        "Cole: I know you're not -- I know you're not just trying to make me feel better. I know you actually think that everything's going to be okay.",
        "Starr: And you don't?",
        "Cole: How can you believe in me when I don't even believe in myself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: We're going to do things my way --",
        "Todd: Hmm --",
        "Blair: This time. We're going to do it my way, Todd, so get your ass in gear and let's go.",
        "Todd: And if I don't want to, what are you going to do? Clock me over the head and drag me out?",
        "Blair: I'll do whatever it takes. Or, you know, I could call the judge and tell him that you're not cooperating with the agreement.",
        "Todd: Yes, and I'll tell him that I offered a perfectly acceptable alternative and you shot it down.",
        "T\u00e9a: And I'll tell him that neither one of you deserves the kids. He was absolutely right.",
        "Blair: Oh, and what do you know? You don't have a maternal bone in your body.",
        "T\u00e9a: Funny, then, isn't it, that I'm the only one remembering what's important here? But go ahead, you two keep bickering over real estate. Meanwhile, the court deadline will pass and neither one of you will end up with the kids.",
        "Blair: You know, if Todd cared about anybody other than himself, he would see that the children are happy right where they are, and that's at Dorian's. He would also see that Starr does not want to uproot that child after everything it's been through.",
        "Todd: What child? Blair, what are you talking about? Starr and what child?",
        "Blair: Something has happened.",
        "Todd: Is Starr okay?",
        "Blair: Yeah, she's fine.",
        "Todd: Then spit it out. Why are you keeping secrets about our children?",
        "T\u00e9a: Let her talk, Todd, okay?",
        "Blair: Look, Starr -- she wanted to be the one to tell you, and I wanted to honor that.",
        "Todd: Well, obviously, you failed, so --",
        "Blair: Okay, will you promise you just will stay calm when I tell you?",
        "Todd: Oh, God.",
        "Blair: Really.",
        "Todd: Yes, I promise. Speak.",
        "Blair: Marcie decided to give hope back to Starr.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Our daughter is going to raise our grandchild.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: How can -- how can you even look at me? I continue to hurt you over and over. And now I'm hurting our baby.",
        "Starr: This is not your fault, Cole.",
        "Cole: Yes, it is. Yes, it is. If I hadn't taken drugs in the first place, Asher wouldn't have anything to do with me.",
        "Starr: You stopped doing drugs, and I'm so proud of you for that.",
        "Cole: I should've dropped the drugs on the floor right away, but I didn't. So I deserve this. But hope doesn't. She spent the first few months of her life without us, and now I'm going away for a whole year? Just -- she doesn't even know the sound of my voice yet. She's going to forget about me, and so will you.",

        "Cristian: So you and Fish are dating again?",
        "Layla: We never actually dated. It's true. We just went out a few times.",
        "Cristian: Didn't he dump you for Stacy Morasco? You can't dump someone if you're not dating.",
        "Layla: I wasn't dumped.",
        "Cristian: All right, he broke up with you.",
        "Layla: You're impossible, you know that?",
        "Cristian: No, you know what's impossible? This whole living arrangement. That's impossible.",
        "Layla: You were into it before.",
        "Cristian: That's before you started hooking up with our roommate. Think about it, Layla. That's a bad idea. What happens if your little love connection doesn't work and Fish books out of here, huh?",
        "Oliver: What? Where am I going?",
        "Layla: Out on the town with me. Nice pecs.",
        "Oliver: Uh, thanks.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, nice pecs.",
        "Cristian: You know, we need Fish and his part of the rent to stick around.",
        "Layla: You bug out for no reason.",
        "Cristian: I'm just saying, Layla, it's not a good idea to date your roommate.",
        "Layla: Uh, yeah, if her name is Vanessa Montez.",
        "Layla: Look, Fish asked me for a second chance, and I think it's worth it. It's one date.",
        "Cristian: That's all it takes.",
        "Layla: What's it to you anyway?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You're pretty slick. You must be a good private eye.",
        "Rex: I'm a little rusty, but that was good, by the way -- the grandson bit. Oh, good, you're back. My wife and I have changed our minds. We are going to have a bottle of your best champagne.",
        "Stacy: And if you could be so good as to get us some nachos, please?",
        "Maitre d': Perhaps you'd like to clear that with your grandfather, too, given that it's all going on his account.",
        "Rex: Yes, well, I would, but papa doesn't like to be disturbed before 5:00.",
        "Maitre d': Oh, that's odd. He was wide awake and summering on Block Island with the rest of the Underhills when I spoke with him just now.",
        "Rex: You're kidding?",
        "Stacy: You see, Trey and I prefer the countryside to the sea.",
        "Maitre d': Mr. Underhill also mentioned that with deep regret, he doesn't have a grandson.",
        "[Maitre d' chuckles]",
        "Maitre d': Security?",
        "Stacy: Should we run?",
        "Rex: Uh, yeah.",

        "Gigi: Oh, my God! What am I doing?",
        "Kyle: You don't know?",
        "Gigi: Look at me. I'm like -- I'm like pimping myself to you to get a confession. I'm not my sister.",
        "Kyle: I have nothing to confess.",
        "Gigi: Don't play with me, Kyle.",
        "Kyle: I don't know what Stacy told you, but I don't play women.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no, no, of course not. Who has time for that? You're too busy helping a tramp break up a happy family and keeping a secret that could save a boy's life. I know that Stacy is not the real donor.",
        "Kyle: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Gigi: Yes, you do. And I can prove it. You changed the test results. Schuyler and I -- we swiped the DNA sample from Stacy and went to another lab. She couldn't donate to Shane any more than I could.",
        "Kyle: Okay, well, so go tell her that.",
        "Gigi: Not until I know who really saved my kid. You know who the real donor is and you won't tell, will you? And here I am... humiliating myself trying to get the truth out of someone who doesn't give a damn. What if Shane gets sick again, huh? How am I supposed to save him? Just tell me one thing -- how do you live with yourself?",
        "Kyle: It isn't easy. Wait! I'll tell you everything you want to know.",
        "Kyle: Whatever you think of me, I do have feelings. And I can see how desperate you are.",
        "Gigi: So you'll help me?",
        "Kyle: It's why I got into this mess. No, it's not to help Stacy. Sure, she's hot and all, but come on, she's got a few screws loose.",
        "Gigi: You think?",
        "Kyle: I wanted to help your son. It's the whole reason I wanted to be a doctor. But the only way that I could help Shane was to keep the donor's name a secret.",
        "Gigi: So Stacy could say it was her and break up Rex and me?",
        "Kyle: I don't know anything about that, okay? I was keeping the donor's name a secret for another reason.",
        "Gigi: Which was?",
        "[Kyle sighs]",
        "Kyle: It's complicated. But if you knew why, you'd understand.",
        "Gigi: Mm-hmm. Okay.",
        "Kyle: Look, I want to help you. I really do, okay? This thing has gotten way out of hand. It's turned into this big mess, even for me. But before I help you, I got to ask a favor of you.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Kyle: Rex's sister wants to throw me behind bars. She's pressing charges against me.",
        "Gigi: What does that have to do with this?",
        "Kyle: I'll tell you everything you want to know and then some. Just get Natalie to drop those charges against me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, baby, don't get me wrong. I think Gigi probably made a lot of mistakes. But Stacy, that girl never would try to stop the bleeding. Do I think she split up my son's family? Yeah, part of the way. Yeah, damn right I do.",
        "Stacy: You're crazy. The landlord said the next door neighbors were complaining because I play my music too loud. Can you believe that?",
        "Schuyler: No, no, Stacy. Actually, I can't, especially since I heard enough to know that it has something to do with your sister.",
        "Schuyler: Huh. Now, as I remember it, you hated Stacy before Rex and Gigi broke up. Isn't that right?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, what's there to like?",
        "Schuyler: She saved your grandson's life.",
        "Roxy: She was only doing that because she was trying to get -- like I said, Stacy's got no feelings. She's kind of like the terminator. You get in the way and it's \"hasta la vista, baby.\" You ought to know that. You dated her, am I right?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, she does put herself first most of the time. See, you know, I would've thought that Stacy would've pulled a fast one on Rex and Gigi just to make herself look like a hero.",
        "Roxy: Well, I don't know nothing about that.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah -- no, of course not. Why would you? I mean, if you did know something and you didn't say anything, that would kind of put a strain on your relationship with your son, wouldn't it?",
        "Roxy: Thanks for the juice. Just put it on my bill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You know how much pull I have with Natalie? Zero.",
        "Kyle: You haven't even tried yet, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: She hates my guts because she thinks I cheated on her brother. She would not lift a finger to help me unless Rex was on my side. But if you tell me the truth, then I can kick Stacy to the curb where she belongs, and Rex and I can get back together. Then we can go to Natalie and get her to drop the charges.",
        "Kyle: I'm sorry, but I'm not going to throw away the only leverage I have on the hope that Natalie's a forgiving person. You want to find out everything I know? Then you got to save me first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Marcie gave the baby back? What about Michael?",
        "Blair: Well, I guess they agreed. Marcie knew how upset Starr was about giving Hope away. She came to the house last night with her, and they had a heart-to- heart, and she tore the adoption papers up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wow. So it's finally over.",
        "Blair: That's why -- I mean, I just think it would be best if we all moved to Dorian's. There's so much room there. And the baby's going to have round-the- clock care.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, you're awfully quiet. It's good news, don't you think?",
        "Blair: Were you even listening? Our grandchild is going to be raised by Starr. Todd, come on.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, not so fast. You're not going anywhere until we get one thing straight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How could I ever forget you?",
        "Cole: A lot can change in a year.",
        "Starr: You're right, a lot can. We lost our baby, we lost each other. But look at how close we are now. We just got our baby back, and I think we're getting us back, too.",
        "Cole: What do you mean?",
        "Starr: Cole, I -- I love you.",
        "Cole: You do?",
        "Starr: I never stopped. And even six months, a year, two, or five years from now, I'll still love you.",

        "Cristian: I have no interest in your love life.",
        "Layla: Could've fooled me.",
        "Cristian: You and Fish can do what you want. Just don't create a situation where there isn't one.",
        "Layla: As long as you stop putting a painting studio where there shouldn't be one. Oh, yeah, okay, that's great. Now I have to go clean this off before my date. Better not be oil paint.",
        "Cristian: So, what have you got planned?",
        "Oliver: Something low key. Some little concert, maybe some ice cream.",
        "Cristian: Flowers.",
        "Oliver: Huh?",
        "Cristian: You should get her flowers. Oh, and Fish -- you know, Layla's been given a raw deal by one too many guys. That includes you. So I'm only going to say this once -- treat her right. If not, you don't want to know what happens. Trust me.",
        "Oliver: I got it. I'll be a perfect gentleman.",
        "Cristian: Good. You should get her roses. She likes the yellow ones.",
        "Oliver: Thanks.",

        "Schuyler: What happened? What did that son of a bitch do to you?",
        "Gigi: Nothing. I couldn't go through with it.",
        "Schuyler: Oh. Well, good -- I hated that plan.",
        "Gigi: Tell me about it.",
        "Schuyler: Don't worry, we'll find another way to get Stacy.",
        "Gigi: How? Stacy's not talking. Kyle won't spill either. Unless I go to Natalie and beg her to drop these charges she has against him.",
        "Schuyler: He said that?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and I don't know what that's about. So, basically, I'm screwed.",
        "Schuyler: Maybe not. We might have another option.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rex slurps]",
        "Rex: All clear.",
        "Stacy: We left those losers in the dust.",
        "Rex: The most important skill a great scammer can have is the ability to --",
        "Stacy: Run fast?",
        "Rex: You're learning.",
        "Stacy: Well, you're a good teacher.",
        "Rex: You're a good student.",

        "Blair: T\u00e9a, let me by. Todd's going to get Starr.",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr is more than capable of dealing with Todd. And before I forget, congratulations on being a grandmother.",
        "Blair: You got something to say, say it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine. We need to clear something up right now. You, me, Todd -- who's going to live where and with whom?",

        "Cole: I love you, too.",
        "Cole: I'm just scared of losing you.",
        "Starr: No, you won't. You won't.",

        "Starr: Cole? What are you --",
        "Cole: Starr -- I love you so much. And the only way that I can be away from you and our baby is to know that I have you in another way.",
