        "Tate: After a very long time apart.",
        "Adriana: What about when you were younger? Didn't you have any idea that your father was racist then?",
        "Tate: I -- I just -- I can't -- I can't conceive of him doing any of this. Arson, gassing, bombs -- there's no way.",
        "Adriana: You know, I didn't think that any of those things could happen at the people that I know, either, but they did.",
        "Tate: What are you trying to say?",
        "Adriana: Don't take this the wrong way, Tate, but is it possible that your dad actually is guilty?",

        "Bo: We've got all we need to put you away, Harmon. Sahid?",
        "Bo: That's all that's left of Vincent Jones' warehouse. That's a picture of his man Ted after they found his remains. You did this to him. That's the hospital after you bombed it. And this -- this picture -- you take a long, hard look at that one -- that is my son's house. My son barely got out of there alive. Now, you made this personal. I'm going to personally see you burn for this -- for Ted Osborne, for Evangeline Williamson, the Vega brothers, Nora Hanen, Lindsay Rappaport, Officer Sahid --",
        "Kirk: All right! You made your point.",
        "Bo: Well, do you get it? You're looking at murder one.",
        "Kirk: These allegations are not going to stick.",
        "Bo: These are not allegations. You did it. We will find the proof to connect you to it. What these are -- these are hate crimes. That's a bonus for us. That means you're looking at life without parole, and, man, that's only if you're lucky enough to avoid the death sentence!",

        "Miles: What are you doing here, Detective?",
        "John: Hey, Miles, just a little police business to take care of.",
        "Miles: Hmm. Yeah, we were just watching the news, and David Vickers was released from prison. How's that possible if he confessed?",

        "Miles: Who is it?",
        "John: I'm not really at liberty to say, but when I can, I promise you, you'll be one of the first to know -- being that you've been so interested in the investigation and all.",
        "Miles: Well, Spencer was my friend.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Miles: And whoever did this deserves to pay.",

        "Markko: Oh, come on, you two love being the center of attention.",
        "Starr: Then you don't know us, Markko.",
        "Markko: I know you're both still into each other, no matter what you say.",
        "Langston: Yeah, what happened to you two anyway? You look like you went swimming.",
        "Starr: Don't worry about that. I'll tell you all about it, just not tonight. Tonight I just want to be with Cole.",

        "Cole: Let's go get dried off in the locker rooms.",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Marcie: You two are very, very sneaky.",
        "Langston: We learned from the master.",
        "Marcie: Fine, all right, you win. Go back to hating each other, see if I care. I don't care. No one can say that I did not try.",
        "[Music stops]",
        "Markko: You know, I never said I hated you.",
        "Langston: I did. I didn't mean it, though. I just meant you're a freak.",

        "Adriana: Know, Tate, it's awful when our parents do horrible things --",
        "Tate: Damn it, Adriana, I'm telling you, he's innocent.",
        "Adriana: Well, Bo doesn't think so.",
        "Tate: He -- he just wants another check in his win column.",
        "Adriana: His son almost got killed. He wants to find the right guy as much as anyone else, and I'm sorry, if that's your father, he needs to go to jail for a very long time.",
        "Tate: So you've already passed judgment on him?",
        "Adriana: My brother and cousin were victims, Tate. I was at the hospital when the bomb went off. If the bomb in Jessica's room had gone off, I could've been killed.",
        "Tate: You're right. You could've died.",
        "Adriana: I was lucky. But Vincent's friend wasn't, and Layla's sister is in a coma. Whoever did this is a monster, and I hope that he and everybody else like him gets what they deserve.",
        "Tate: Does that go for me, too?",
        "Adriana: What?",
        "Tate: If they find my father guilty, are you going to hold that against me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We found a shoeprint at one of the scenes. That's a size 12. That's -- that's your size, isn't it?",
        "Kirk: I'm not the only person in the world with a size 12.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you see things like this, they add up for a jury. And by the way, you know what? We also -- that bomb that we caught you with tonight? That was identical to the one that detective McBain disarmed at the hospital.",
        "Kirk: It doesn't mean I set it, and it certainly doesn't mean I was going to set it off with the so-called \"bomb\" that you found on me.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm sure that you've done this before, and we will find a way to connect you to it -- D.N.A., hair, fibers. I've got people looking at your belongings right now. Look, the only way that you can help yourself is to confess.",
        "Kirk: It'll be a cold day in hell before I do that.",

        "John: Here's the thing, Laurence, I'm not asking your permission. It's official police business.",

        "Marty: Miles, it's all right. I'm sure John wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Miles: Wait -- hello? Yeah, I'm in the middle of something right now. All right, just a minute. It's my lawyer.",

        "Marty: See what?",
        "John: You can't even kiss him, can you? I can help you, Marty, but I need to know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Wow! I never thought I would see that.",
        "Cole: And I never thought I'd be here with you like this again. And this time I'm not letting you get away. Ready to go?",
        "Starr: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cole: Let's go.",
        "Britney: No, you don't. You're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Why would I hold it against you if your father committed these hate crimes?",
        "Tate: Because I'm his son. I'm part of him.",
        "Adriana: But you're not him. And like you said, you weren't close.",
        "Tate: What's to say some of his ideas haven't rubbed off on me?",
        "Adriana: I've never seen anything racist or hateful in you.",
        "Tate: Hmm. Well, you are right -- I am nothing like him, same way you're nothing like your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Do you realize just how serious these charges are? Your only chance at a deal right now -- cooperate, give us a full confession.",
        "Kirk: Hmm. Confess? Well, that would be like doing your job for you, wouldn't it?",
        "Bo: Hey, hey, I'm trying to help you. Do you want to die?",
        "Kirk: I want a lawyer.",
        "Talia: Damn it.",
        "Bo: Who's your attorney?",
        "Kirk: Just get me a public defender.",
        "Talia: He just doesn't want to I.D. another O.P.P. sympathizer.",
        "Bo: Get on your feet. On your feet, face that wall. You're going to be sitting in a holding cell while we get you a lawyer.",

        "Marty: I did kill him.",
        "John: You may be convinced, I'm not.",
        "Marty: Why? I mean, for some reason, you think that I'm not capable of it?",
        "John: No, because there's no conclusive evidence that says you did.",
        "Marty: I remember doing it.",
        "John: You think you remember.",
        "Marty: What do I have to say to make you believe me?",
        "John: Because your mind can play tricks with you, you know? It can twist things around. What is it called -- recovered memory syndrome?",
        "Marty: Yes, I know -- I'm a psychiatrist. Don't you think I would know if my mind was playing tricks on me?",
        "John: Just because you're a shrink doesn't mean you're immune to trauma. You, of all people, should know that.",
        "Marty: I confessed. So why aren't you arresting me?",
        "John: I'm not making the same mistake twice, all right? Look, I am -- I'm working on something right now, but I need to know what's really going on.",
        "Marty: I already told you.",
        "John: You know what I can't figure out? You know, if this guy is blackmailing you, why are you still protecting him?",
        "Marty: I'm not. There's nothing to protect.",
        "John: I don't believe you.",
        "Marty: Well, then, you know, you're just going to have to do what you have to.",

Because I've been thinking about prom since I was 12 years old, and I have spent weeks finding the perfect dress and figuring out my hair and what shoes to wear, and imagining how it would be for you, to make you happy. But I guess it just wasn't enough, right?",
