But Natalie is torn between saving Gigi's life or saving her father's life.",
        "Robert Ford goes looking for Tess and sees she's left. He calls James and asks for his help.

But Robert needs to make sure she is ok. Jessica then comes back to her family and is ready to take Ryder back. They all are in support of that and Joey wants her to enable him to kick Aubrey to the curb by taking the only thing that prevents him from doing that away from Aubrey.

        "Calmar: This is a mistake.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What other choice did I have? This has to be handled once and for all.",

        "James: What, seriously?",
        "Starr: Yes, seriously. The doctors can't believe it either. He's starting to understand things and move.",
        "James: That's great.",
        "Starr: Yeah. I have a really good feeling that this is going to be an awesome summer.",
        "James: Well, we're going to be taking classes together, so that's definitely great.",
        "Starr: I know. I'm so glad that you're enrolled, even though it's just auditing.",
        "James: I saved up enough money to buy my books today, so we are definitely gonna be seeing each other 3 times a week in political science.",
        "Starr: I hope I see you a little more than that.",
        "James: Oh, you can see me as much as you want, except that your daughter hates my guts. Tess? I don't get it. The last call was from me. Where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Aubrey, Aubrey, I'm back. It's fine. You don't have to worry about Ryder.",
        "Aubrey: It doesn't change the fact that Joey and I are his legal guardians. We're the only reason that Ryder didn't end up in foster care after the show that Tess and Ford put on in court.",
        "Jessica: Ok, but you know that wasn't me.",
        "Aubrey: No. It doesn't matter who it was. It still happened. I'm not gonna hand him over till a court orders me to do so.",
        "Brody: What's going on?",
        "Jessica: Oh, stay out of this.",
        "Aubrey: She wants me to just hand Ryder over. Can you please just tell her?",
        "Brody: Aubrey and Joey were granted custody of Ryder.",

        "Aubrey: Calm down, Jessica. You're scaring him.",
        "Jessica: This is ridiculous. I have to find my mom anyway and tell her that I'm back.",

        "Joey: Dad, there is a heart out there, and it is a perfect match, ok? Once the doctor talks to the fianc\u00e9, it's a done deal. Please, we really should get ready. I mean, whatever-- Mom, what's wrong?",
        "Viki: It's, uh, Gigi.",
        "Joey: What--what happened?",
        "Viki: I just saw Bo. He told me that she's been in a terrible accident.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I feel so bad for this woman and her family, but at least now her death won't be meaningless. She's a match for Dad, Rex. As soon as they talk to the family, Dad's gonna get her heart.",
        "Rex: They can't do that.",
        "Natalie: Oh, Rex, come on. I know you don't like Dad, but--",
        "Rex: Ok, I won't let them.",
        "Natalie: Rex! This could save Dad's life. She's an organ donor.",
        "Rex: It's Gigi! The other patient is Gigi!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: James, Hope doesn't hate you.",
        "James: You're right. She just really dislikes me, and she cries every time she sees me.",
        "Starr: Since when?",
        "James: Since when? Well, for example, this morning, when I went by your house to see if you wanted a ride over here. Hope and your grandma answered the door, and as soon as Hope saw me, she started throwing a fit.",
        "Starr: Well, Hope didn't get that much sleep last night.",
        "James: Starr, come on. You know it's me. I told you. Hope doesn't want a new guy in your life.",
        "Starr: Well, you also said that the three of us should spend more time together, so how about the three of us go to the zoo this weekend, ok?",

        "Jessica: My dad--he's always been so healthy. How could one heart attack put him on the transplant list?",
        "Brody: It was a really bad one.",
        "Jessica: Obviously. Is there a donor?",
        "Brody: Viki just called. It sounds like they found someone.",

        "Brody: Jess, let me help.",
        "Jessica: Brody, if you want to help, you'll pack your bags and be gone when I come back. I don't want to walk in on you and Natalie in bed together again.",

        "Natalie: What? What happened?",
        "Rex: Jack Manning set a trap for Shane. Only, Gigi found out, and she went instead, and she got locked in a room with a carbon monoxide leak.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "Rex: She's brain-dead. There's machines breathing for her.",
        "Natalie: Oh!",
        "Rex: I can't. I can't.",
        "Natalie: It's ok.",
        "Rex: No, no, it's not ok. Nothing is ok. Shane and Roxy are in there with her right now. He cannot see me lose it.",
        "Natalie: Does he know?",
        "Rex: Yeah, but I don't know if he gets it. I mean, I don't even--Gigi and I are supposed to be getting married today. Shane was supposed to be the best man. I--seeing him at lunch today, he was, like, the happiest I've ever seen him, and now tonight, he's saying good-bye to his mother forever. How will he get that? How will we ever understand? Or maybe it hit him as soon as he walked in the room. I don't know. All I do know is I'm it now. I'm all he has, so I've got to keep it together for Shane, because the one person he's had his entire life is gone.",

        "Viki: Gigi was like a daughter to me. You know, she was such a good friend when I didn't have anyone.",
        "Joey: Mom, is--is she dead?",
        "Viki: She's brain-dead, on life support.",
        "Clint: What happened to her?",
        "Viki: Carbon monoxide poisoning.",
        "Joey: Oh, my God. So she's the woman whose heart was the perfect match for Dad.",
        "Clint: So the fianc\u00e9 that the doctor has to talk to is Rex--Rex, who can't wait to dance on my grave.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, I remember you. I gave you a Glasgow kiss, and you followed me all the way here just to get your clothes back?",
        "Man: Oh, you're a riot. Who knew? Get your hands in the air.",
        "Todd: I wasn't so cheery when I was your prisoner, and you were torturing me, but I'm in a much better head space right now.",
        "Man: ...Away on that plane.",
        "Todd: ...Really? You think so? Thanks. I like that.",
        "Man: Get them up.",
        "Todd: Ok.",
        "Man: Did you think we wouldn't catch up with you?",
        "Todd: Can we talk about this?",
        "Man: There's nothing to say, since you don't have what we want or you're not gonna tell us where it is. Either way, you're disposable.",
        "Todd: But I--I do have what you want.",

        "Blair: What do you want, Dorian? Yeah, I know that you are in California. What kind of problem on the set? Well, work it out with David. I can't talk to you right now. I'm in New York. No. I didn't actually come with Tom\u00e1s. I followed him here. I followed him because I didn't believe him. There's something fishy going on. It could be \"dangereux.\" At least, that's what that fishy Frenchman said. It's all I could make out of what he said, anyway, and--",
        "Calmar: I presume I would be that fishy Frenchman.",
        "Blair: Got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I don't have to explain myself to you, of all people.",
        "Aubrey: I didn't say you did. I'm just surprised.",
        "Brody: Jessica was gone, and nothing we tried would bring her out. When the electroshock failed, I thought she was never coming back.",
        "Aubrey: So you slept with her sister.",
        "Brody: It wasn't like that. We have a child together. We didn't do this to hurt Jessica.",
        "Aubrey: I get it. Hey, you were waiting a long time for Jessica.",
        "Brody: It was all I wanted for so long, and here she is. She's back. It's great for her family and her kids. It's just, uh, the timing couldn't have been worse.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, right, for both of us. As soon as Jessica takes her son back, that's it for Joey and me. Ryder was the only thing keeping us together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Ok, look, we don't know for sure that Gigi's the organ donor, ok? If it was someone else, or--",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Viki: Oh, it's St. Ann's. I'm sorry. I have to take it. Uh, Victoria Lord.",
        "Joey: Dad, no matter what you and Rex have going on between--",
        "Viki: Oh, no! When? Tess has escaped.",
        "Clint: Oh, God. Can't that place do anything right?",
        "Joey: Dad, look, it's ok, ok? We're gonna find her.",
        "Jessica: Dad.",
        "Joey: Tess.",
        "Jessica: No, it's me. It's Jessica.",
        "Viki: I'll call you back. She just walked in here. Jessie?",
        "Jessica: Yes. Dad, I'm so sorry I wasn't here.",
        "Joey: Stay away from him.",
        "Jessica: Joey, it's me. It's Jessica. Why would Tess be here?",
        "Viki: She's right. Tess would never come near us. Jessie? Really? Oh, my God! Jessie.",
        "Jessica: Mom, I'm so sorry.",
        "Viki: Oh, God. Are you all right?",
        "Jessica: Yes, yes. I'm fine. Dad, how long have you been here?",
        "Clint: A while, honey.",
        "Viki: How did you get out of St. Ann's?",
        "Jessica: Ford. He helped. He helped Tess, and then he took her to a motel. That's where they were hiding out, and then Tess let her guard down long enough, so I could fight my way back.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, thank God. Oh, my God. Your babies are gonna be so happy to see you.",
        "Jessica: Yes, they were. I went to go and see them first thing. Bree is even more beautiful than I remember, and Ryder-- my God, he's gotten so big.",
        "Viki: I know. Does Brody know you're back?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. So does Natalie.",

        "Dr. Degroff: I'm sorry to interrupt. Your family's in with Ms. Morasco now?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Dr. Degroff: We want to give you as much time as you need, but there is--",
        "Rex: Forget it.",
        "Dr. Degroff: I think if you heard the sit--",
        "Rex: Yeah, this is about Clint Buchanan, right? Yeah, I heard.",
        "Dr. Degroff: Mr. Buchanan needs a heart transplant right away.",
        "Rex: I know.",
        "Dr. Degroff: Ms. Morasco's heart is an unusually good match--",
        "Rex: Forget it! Did you not hear me? Forget it! Just get the hell out of here and leave me alone.",
        "Dr. Degroff: Ms. Morasco signed a donor card. She clearly wants her organs to go to other people.",
        "Rex: Not to Clint Buchanan.",
        "Natalie: Dr. Degroff. Natalie. I'm Clint Buchanan's daughter. Do you know how long he has?",
        "Dr. Degroff: He's not my patient. I wouldn't want to guess. But if he's at the top of the recipient list...",
        "Natalie: I understand.",
        "Dr. Degroff: I'll give you a few minutes.",
        "Rex: Do not ask me to do this. You can't possi--",
        "Natalie: I know. I know. But come on. He's my father. He's your father.",
        "Rex: Clint Buchanan is not my father. He'd be the first person to tell you that.",
        "Natalie: Rex, do you really think that Gigi would want--",
        "Rex: You want to know what you can do for me? You go tell your father that he gets Gigi's heart over my dead body.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I came as soon as I heard about Dad, but thank God there's a donor. What? What? Isn't there a donor?",
        "Viki: There might be.",
        "Clint: There could be a problem.",
        "Jessica: What's the problem.",
        "Natalie: You're here.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Where else would I be?",
        "Joey: Natalie, can you believe Jessica's back?",
        "Clint: Yeah, the best news in a long time.",
        "Joey: Yeah. It must have been quite a shock when she walked into the house.",
        "Jessica: Oh, yeah. Natalie was very surprised to see me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: All right. What's going on? I thought Tess was at St. Ann's.",
        "Ford: I broke her out.",
        "James: What? Are you crazy, Bobby? What were you thinking?",
        "Ford: I wasn't thinking. I love her!",
        "James: Wait. Wait. I get it. You're kidding, right?",
        "Ford: No. You were right, James. I'm in love with Tess, and as it turns out, she loves me, too, and we want to be together.",
        "James: Uh-huh. So, ok, well, where is this love of your life?",
        "Ford: I don't know. I told her to stay here while I went and talked to Cutter about giving her a divorce, and when I came back, she was gone.",
        "James: Yeah.",
        "Ford: No, dude, she could be in trouble. What if the people from St. Ann's came and got to her first?",
        "James: Right, or maybe even...",
        "Ford: Maybe what? What?",
        "James: She played you.",
        "Ford: No, James, no! That's not what this is about. I know what that is, and she wasn't doing that.",
        "James: Tess is good, Bobby. She's good.",
        "Ford: She loves me.",
        "James: You have got to face it, man. She only said she loved you so you would help her out. She got what she wanted, and she took off, man. Tess isn't coming back.",

        "Jessica: I must have felt how much everybody wanted me back.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God. You have no idea how much.",
        "Jessica: No, I do. I do. I guess that is what brought me back, you know? How I feel about my family is stronger than anything that Tess has ever felt. I had to be with people I love. You know how that is, right?",
        "Natalie: Yes. I love my family, too.",
        "Viki: Natalie--",
        "Natalie: I just saw Rex in the E.R.",
        "Viki: Yeah, we heard about Gigi. How is Rex?",

        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: What's going on?",
        "Viki: Uh, Gigi is--she's--she's gone. Carbon monoxide poisoning.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God.",
        "Viki: It's just horrible.",
        "Jessica: I mean, I'm sorry, but can she save Dad's life?",
        "Clint: I won't be getting that heart, Jessie.",
        "Jessica: Dad. But you have to. You need a transplant, right? No. Dad, you can't. I didn't fight my way back just to lose you.",

        "Starr: Hey, Lang, hold on one second. Someone's beeping in. Yes, Aunt Dorian? No. No, I don't know why my mom hung up on you, but can I call you back later? Langston's on the other line. Yes, I'll tell her. I'll talk to you later. Sorry, Lang. That was Aunt Dorian. So how's David? So basically just the usual? And speaking of the movie, how's Markko? Are you guys more than just friends? Well, James and me, we're great. No, no, we haven't yet. We actually got a room at The Palace. Can you hang on a minute? I'm going to take you somewhere a little more private.",

        "Calmar: Mademoiselle Cramer, to what do I owe the pleasure?",
        "Blair: Well, Tom\u00e1s told me that he was meeting a gallery here in New York, so I thought I'd just surprise him.",
        "Calmar: I don't believe Tom\u00e1s would appreciate a surprise. This gallery owner is unpredictable.",
        "Blair: Dangereux?",
        "Calmar: He knows many people who could make Tom\u00e1s' art career or break it. It's a very delicate negotiation.",
        "Blair: And I would ruin it?",
        "Calmar: Tom\u00e1s would be very hurt that you trusted him so little.",
        "Blair: I didn't say that.",
        "Calmar: But if you return to Llanview, he will never know you lurked in corridors, spying on him.",
        "Blair: Fine. Ok. I'll go.",

        "Man: You're bluffing. If you didn't tell us where it is then, there's no way you're gonna tell us now.",
        "Todd: I was kind of groggy before. I was a little out of it, and I was doing that whole Rip Van Winkle thing.",
        "Man: Oh, and it's all coming back to you now.",
        "Todd: Look, not only do I remember, but I have it with me.",
        "Man: Yeah? Then where is it?",
        "Todd: It's right here.",

        "Ford: I know you think I've lost it, but just hear me out. I know every move that there is to make someone feel like you're falling for them. It's me we're talking about here, ok? I swear to you, I can tell the difference. Tess wasn't using me. She would never leave here on her own. Something must have happened to her.",
        "James: Ok, ok, Bob, but take a look around. It doesn't look like somebody dragged her out of here or anything.",
        "Ford: Maybe she went to get a soda or something and that's when the people from St. Ann's got her. I don't know.",
        "James: So call them up and see if she's back.",
        "Ford: They're not gonna give that kind of information out over the phone. That's why I need you.",
        "James: To do what?",
        "Ford: I'd sneak back in there myself, but they know me there.",
        "James: Whoa. Hold on. You want me to sneak into a mental hospital? How do you think I'm gonna get around all those nuns guarding-- seriously, Bobby?",
        "Ford: Please? It's an emergency. I just need you to go in there and make sure that Tess is all right.",

        "Joey: Jess, now that you're home, Bree's gonna want to stay up all night with you.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, thanks for taking care of them. Aubrey told me that you got temporary custody.",
        "Joey: Yeah, but we never let them forget you. We talked about you all the time, and it was so cute. Bree would show Ryder your picture and tell him who you were. Ryder knows that you're his mom. Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Thank you. I hope I didn't upset your life too much.",
        "Joey: No, no, of course not. It's just that now that you're back, there's gonna be a lot of changes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You're good at that.",
        "Aubrey: Ryder makes it easy, huh?",
        "Brody: I guess you have to be. Like you said, Ryder is your ticket to Joey. Got to look like you care.",
        "Aubrey: Right, 'cause it's all just a show. Not a real feeling in my body. That's what you all think, isn't it?",
        "Brody: It's none of my business.",
        "Aubrey: It's what Joey thinks. But I love him, and that's real. And I know he can feel it again if he'll just give me time.",
        "Brody: If it's real, he will.",
        "Aubrey: He loved me. That doesn't just disappear, does it?",
        "Brody: You're asking the wrong guy.",
        "Aubrey: You loved Jessica. That didn't disappear, did it?",
        "Brody: No.",

        "Jessica: Not yet.",

        "Viki: Joey, would you take Jessie home?",
        "Joey: Mom, I'll stick around.",
        "Clint: Joey, take your sister, please.",
        "Jessica: I appreciate what you guys are trying to do, but you don't have to baby me, ok? Tess is not coming back out.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, you know that this is a very tricky time.",
        "Jessica: Yes, of course, I do. I know that. Trust me, if I was going to split, I would have the second I walked into the house. Look, I know that I have a long road ahead of me and that I need tons of therapy. I've even made an appointment with Dr. Levin first thing in the morning.",
        "Viki: That's wonderful, but I would feel a lot better if you had someone with you. Please?",
        "Clint: Joey, you need to take out the trash, don't you?",
        "Jessica: What is he talking about?",
        "Joey: Tell you on the way. Love you.",
        "Clint: I love you, too. Bye.",
        "Jessica: I will see you in the morning.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Viki: I'll call you the second that there's any news, all right?",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Joey: Dad, it's gonna work out, ok? Just hang tough.",
        "Viki: Don't you want to go be with Rex?",
        "Natalie: He sent me away.",
        "Dr. Degroff: Excuse me. I'm looking for--hello.",
        "Natalie: I am so sorry about my brother before. He was really upset.",
        "Dr. Degroff: I understand grief. Believe me, I've been hit with worse. I'm looking for Dr. Gangemi?",
        "Clint: Doctor, what about the transplant?",
        "Dr. Degroff: I'm afraid I can only discuss it with your doctor.",
        "Viki: I'm sure you know that this is a very complicated situation for us, because we all know Gigi, and we love her.",
        "Dr. Degroff: I'm very sorry for your loss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey, it's me. I sent Shane and Roxy down to the cafeteria. I know how you hate it when he skips meals. I won't let him. Ever. That's not true. Actually, I would have let him skip tonight, but I just wanted him to get out of here before he heard anything about transplants, not that I will ever let that happen. I just didn't want him to get more upset. That doctor doesn't know us. He didn't know what he was asking me. Like you would ever do anything for Clint, like you would ever have them rip out your...for that bastard. No way. The doctor didn't know you. He didn't know you like... he didn't know you. They tell me you're gone. But I look at you. I see your face. So beautiful. It's like you're still here with me. I don't care what anybody else says or what anybody else wants. Your heart stays with me.",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry. I need to change her I.V.",
        "Rex: Yeah. I'm gonna be back in a minute, ok? There's something I got to take care of first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Would I be able to see Gigi?",
        "Dr. Degroff: Assuming the family doesn't mind, it's fine with me.",
        "Viki: Good. Thank you. Honey, you want to come with me?",
        "Natalie: Dad?",
        "Clint: Go ahead. Like I told you, I need the rest.",
        "Natalie: Ok, I love you.",
        "Clint: I love you, too.",
        "Natalie: I'll talk to Rex.",
        "Viki: We'll be back in a minute, ok?",
        "Clint: Ok. Doctor, I need to talk to you.",
        "Dr. Degroff: I'm sorry. I can't discuss Miss Morasco's case with you.",
        "Clint: No, it's not about that. It's just a general question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, at least it's some good news today, huh?",
        "Natalie: I don't know what.",
        "Viki: Your sister is back.",
        "Natalie: Right. Sorry. I didn't mean--",
        "Viki: Ok, Natalie, what is going on between you two? It was obvious from the second you walked in the room.",
        "Natalie: It's nothing. Just a lot is going on today.",
        "Viki: Natalie. If we want to keep Jessica with us, we cannot have any more secrets for any reason whatsoever. Now, what happened?",
        "Natalie: Jessica surprised me.",
        "Viki: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: And Brody.",
        "Viki: And ho-- oh! Oh, God!",
        "Natalie: Mom, you know what it's been like. Tess has completely taken over. We thought--",
        "Viki: I'm not judging you, sweetheart. I'm not. And I know what you thought. What exactly did Jessica walk in on?",
        "Natalie: Brody and me in bed. That's what she meant by she surprised us.",
        "Viki: How did she react?",
        "Natalie: Angrier than I've ever seen her before, but she stayed Jessica. Tess didn't even try to come out.",
        "Viki: That's a very good sign. She stayed strong when she saw how ill your father is. That's a lot to weather right off the bat.",
        "Natalie: I am sorry for what happened, but, Mom, I'm not gonna apologize for how Brody and I feel.",
        "Viki: No, no, I know. And if that's what you two want, then I hope and pray Jessie can learn to accept it, because you deserve to be happy.",

        "Aubrey: I'm sorry.",
        "Joey: You hate my father. So, please, don't even pretend like you care.",
        "Aubrey: I see that it hurts you, and that's what I care about. I remember the first time you told me about your dad. It was the night we met or probably the morning 'cause we spent all night talking. I'll never forget the look on your face when you told me all about Clint. He sounded larger than life.",
        "Joey: Yeah. I mean, especially his bank account, right? But you knew all about that.",
        "Aubrey: Joey, wait.",
        "Joey: No, Aubrey, it is over. Jessica is back now. She can go ahead and take care of Ryder all by herself.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, she's back for now, but who knows?",
        "Joey: No, Jess is back for good.",
        "Aubrey: I hope so, but we don't know what the judge is gonna say. We should wait.",
        "Joey: No, the judge is gonna say that Jessica's family is gonna be able to take care of her now, a family that doesn't include you.",
        "Aubrey: It could, if you would just--",

        "James: That's a real nice girl you hooked up with. She wasn't there. Here.",

        "James: Why?",
        "Ford: Just in case she comes back. I'm gonna go see if her family found out and grabbed her first.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: No, everything is great with James. We said that we love each other. Why? Did you think something was... I mean, there's one thing. I told James that Hope is just going through a phase, but... I don't know, Lang. I told him that it wouldn't be a problem but the truth is, I'm afraid that it is.",
