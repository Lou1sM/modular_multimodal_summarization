        "Jessica has tried everything and yet she can't remember the things that everyone expects her to. She goes to see Leeds and he just lies there unconscious. He has little effect on her. She then goes to the bar and meets Rose. She gives the woman a pep talk and leaves. She feels the memories trying to return but they don't. She can hear her child voice in her head but that is all. Antonio leaves Jessica with her parents and goes to see Leeds. He tells the man that Jessica is over him and able to get back to her life now. The man flatlines. The nurses try to revive him but he dies what seems to be a peaceful death. Antonio knows this man will never have peace even in death. Adriana is on her way to the fight. She catches Daryl following her and freaks out. He tells he was just making a delivery to Rex. She calms down and they go to the fight together. While the fight is taking place, Daryl turns to Adriana and remarks that the fighter 'floats like a butterfly'. Adriana turns to him in horror. He is confused by her look. Claudia arrives. Nash pitches his idea but she can't get that kind of money now. She is scared of getting ripped off again. Nash shows her the note her dad left him. She worries that he could be making this up. She decides to give him the money if he proves her father sent the note. Later, she smiles over getting Nash back from Tess! Cristian is fighting. He is doing a great job of holding his own. He takes a hit and the ref starts counting. Daryl sees that Rex might have known what he was doing when me placed his bet on the other guy. Cristian gets up though and starts fighting again. The crowd loves him. Soon he takes another hit and sends him to the mat again."

        "Layla: Mmm. Nothing I like better than the smell of sweaty men. Except the smell of lots of smelly men.",
        "Evangeline: God, this gym reeks, Layla. Granted, my olfactory senses are working overtime.",
        "Layla: This dress isn't too tight, is it?",
        "Evangeline: Oh, way too tight. Bursting at the seams.",
        "Layla: What? I'm sorry, Vange.",
        "Evangeline: It's all right. Which dress is it, anyway?",
        "Layla: The orange silk.",
        "Evangeline: You're kidding me. You wore that beautiful orange silk dress to a gym?",
        "Layla: Why not? Just because you're off the market --",
        "Cristian: Hey. Layla. My good-luck charm is here.",
        "Evangeline: Is that what I am?",
        "Cristian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Evangeline: That's a lot of pressure.",
        "Cristian: Come on, I got a great seat for you.",
        "Vincent: Hey, hold that up. You know, this is your first fight under my management.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, so?",
        "Vincent: You're over here schmoozing with your girl. You should be in the back getting warm, don't you think?",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Come on.",
        "Vincent: No, you come on. We got business here. Don't forget. I need you to focus. I need you to block everything else out. And the last thing I'm going to let you do is get distracted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: And in the meantime, Rex and I will make sure that Cris knows his mommy wishes him luck -- if I can find Rex. Hey, Carlotta, I -- I got to go. Yeah, I'll call you after the fight. You, too. Feel better. I thought you left.",
        "Rex: No. Just been hanging out here, collecting my thoughts.",
        "Adriana: About me and what a jerk I am?",
        "Rex: Adriana --",
        "Adriana: Being a spoiled brat is bad enough. But blurting to Bo just now that you're working for Claudia Reston -- you're not ever going to be able to forgive me for that, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: Hey, Rex, I just wanted to let you know, I'm in sunny California. Yeah, my plane landed a little while ago. So, if you hear anything about Tess or the Buchanans, call my cell, ok? Right away.",
        "Nash: She's early. I'll be right there. Hold on a sec.",
        "Nash: Hi. Welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, you really don't have to do this now, you know.",
        "Jessica: No. No, I do. I need to.",
        "Nurse: Hi. What can I do -- oh. Yes, you were here before.",
        "Jessica: Then you know who I'm here to visit -- Norman Leeds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, you already apologized --",
        "Adriana: But you never said you forgave me. And you're obviously not happy with me. I mean, telling Bo about Claudia Reston and your involvement -- that was stupid. And now he's going to have all sorts of questions and --",
        "Rex: Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's over, done, ok? End of discussion. It's not like I haven't made my share of mistakes with you. So it would be kind of crazy for me to get all judgmental, right? Not to mention that even if you did make a really, really huge, disgusting, bonehead mistake, I'd still forgive you. You're kind of important to me, in case you hadn't noticed.",
        "Adriana: You're being awfully mature, Mr. Balsom. Not to mention sweet.",
        "Rex: Well, maybe you're rubbing off on me, Ms. Cramer.",
        "Adriana: We should get to Cristian's fight. I don't want to miss the first round.",
        "Rex: Since we took separate cars anyway, why don't I meet you there, ok? I might be a little late. I have to take care of something first.",
        "Adriana: Don't be too late.",
        "Rex: Save me a seat.",
        "Adriana: I'll see you ringside.",
        "Rex: Hey, it's Rex. Meet me at Rourke's, ok? Big fight tonight. Could be exactly what I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: But wait a minute. So you're saying I can't talk to anybody before a match? That's a little over the top, don't you think, Vince?",
        "Vincent: No, I don't think it's over the top. Listen, Vega, please, I need you to be focused.",
        "Cristian: Well, for your information, Evangeline is not my distraction. She's actually my inspiration.",
        "[Evangeline chuckles]",
        "Cristian: And so if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take her to her seat. All right? Thanks for coming, Shaun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: Hey, stranger.",
        "Nash: Hey.",
        "Claudia: Looking good, Nash.",
        "Nash: Oh, yeah? Well, it's nothing you've never seen before.",
        "Claudia: Oh, yes, it's all too familiar.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Claudia: And no longer effective.",
        "Nash: No longer effective?",
        "Claudia: Uh-uh. Taking your clothes off to get what you want from me -- yeah, that used to work, but times have changed. I have changed, I am happy to say. I can't be played like that anymore.",
        "Nash: I am not trying to play you.",
        "Claudia: No? But that would be so out of character, Nash. I don't know if you can pull that off. What are you looking for out there?",
        "Nash: I just --",
        "Claudia: Oh, that's right. You think my father's thugs followed me here.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Claudia: Well, they didn't. I said I would take care of the problem, and I did. In fact, I braved it here into this dump all by myself. I mean, this lovely cottage. Sorry.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, I know it's a little rustic, but you know what? I think you're going to be really impressed with the winery out in the back. It's got all new equipment since the fire.",
        "Claudia: What fire?",
        "Nash: You don't know about the fire? Come on, you know about the fire. Your daddy didn't tell you about the fire?",
        "Claudia: Actually, no. But then he would do anything to protect his little girl.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, that is the one thing your daddy and I have in common. Tell you what -- look, why don't I go get dressed? And then I'll take you for a tour of the winery. I'm sure you want to see what you're going to be investing all your hard-inherited money on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: God, I wish I could see you up there boxing.",
        "Cristian: Well, Layla will give you the blow-by-blow, right?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I'm sure she was a sports announcer in a former life.",
        "Cristian: I'm really glad you're here. What was that for?",
        "Evangeline: Luck.",
        "Cristian: Oh. You know, they say this guy's really good. I'm -- I'm going to need a lot of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Room 175?",
        "Nurse: Same as before.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Honey, are you sure?",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. It's just -- this -- this place --",
        "Antonio: Does any of it seem familiar?",
        "Jessica: Well, it wasn't me that was here before, it was Tess. It's the same as when I watched the tape. It's like it happened to somebody else.",
        "Antonio: Ok. Well, honey, when I saw Leeds last, he was in pretty bad shape, so I don't know if he's going to say much of anything to you.",
        "Jessica: What if he recognizes me?",
        "Antonio: Why don't you let me go in first, ok?",
        "Clint: No, I will. Both of you, you stay here with Jessie.",
        "Viki: You monster. You destroyed my baby. You hurt her over and over again. You split her in two, you -- I followed you in here because I was afraid you were going to do something rash. And I took one look at that -- that thing in the bed, and it's like looking at my father all over again.",
        "Clint: Well, you have every reason to worry. I want this -- there's nothing more I want than to rip Leeds limb from limb. Look at him. He doesn't even know that we're here. Open your eyes. But you don't take orders, do you? You just give them to little girls. For the only time in your life, be a man. Open your eyes, you cold-blooded son of a bitch!",
        "Viki: No, no, no, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.",
        "Clint: Right.",
        "Viki: Don't.",
        "Clint: We're leaving. I am not going to expose Jessie to this pig ever again.",
        "Viki: No, we can't leave now.",
        "Clint: I have to, Viki. 20 years ago, I couldn't protect her, and now I can.",
        "Viki: No, you cannot. You're just keeping her from the truth. And if we do that, then we're no better than Tess or Niki.",
        "Jessica: Is -- is he awake?",
        "Young Jessica: Can you help me? Can you take me home?",
        "Jessica: You -- you did this to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: I tell you, who is this guy?",
        "Shaun: Nobody.",
        "Vincent: Exactly, nobody. Hey, listen, a win today rockets Vega to the elite class of boxers. He'll be a top title contender.",
        "Reporter: Well, you seem pretty confident there, Mr. Jones.",
        "Vincent: Why wouldn't I be? You know, I know a good thing when I see it.",
        "Layla: Looks can be deceiving.",
        "Vincent: Hey, excuse me, gents. Well, it seems to me that you don't have a problem with looks.",
        "Layla: Sometimes what's on the outside has very little to do with inside.",
        "Vincent: Mm-hmm. Well, that means you just have to look deeper.",
        "Evangeline: Get back to warming up.",
        "Cristian: Who says I'm not?",
        "Evangeline: God, I'm so glad I'm here, too. Because when I'm with you, I just -- I feel like I can let my guard down, you know?",
        "Cristian: Are you ok?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just excited about your big fight.",
        "Cristian: No, I -- I think something is bothering you. What is it? Spencer? Todd?",
        "Evangeline: No. It's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ok, I'm here. Where are you?",
        "Adriana: Oh -- what are you doing following me? Is that how you get your kicks? Sneaking up on people in the dark?",
        "Daryl: Whoa, be easy. Chill.",
        "Adriana: Oh, right, I should just chill, right? Just forget that I'm shaking head to toe because you scared me half to death?",
        "Daryl: Look, Rex asked me to talk to U.V.'S night manager, have her give me tonight's take and bring it down here to the gym.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Did he say why?",
        "Daryl: No, but I'm sure it wasn't to give you a heart attack. I'm really sorry.",
        "Adriana: It -- it's ok, it's ok. I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry I freaked out like that. I've just been a little jumpy ever since -- never mind.",
        "Daryl: What? What's going on?",
        "Adriana: Nothing. It's ok, really.",
        "Daryl: Ok, but if you ever want to talk, I'm around.",
        "Adriana: Thanks. I'm going to go inside and try to find Rex.",
        "Daryl: I'll go with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Sit.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, I really think you should be focused on the match.",
        "Cristian: Well, I won't be able to focus if I'm worried about what's bothering you, so tell me, please.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. I called my office earlier, and my assistant told me that three of my clients called to say that they were seeking representation with other firMs. Yeah, apparently, they used the excuse that they wanted someone with a better reputation. You know, someone who hasn't been arrested for aiding and abetting.",
        "Cristian: Wow. That's rough.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: But you don't think that's the real reason?",
        "Evangeline: No. I mean, think about it. Todd is innocent, so what I did to help him should only prove to my clients how passionate I am about protecting them, you know? No, that isn't it. It can't be it. It's -- it's because I'm disabled. And no matter how much I keep telling myself that I'm the same person I was before, I'm not, and I won't be again, and I just have to learn to deal with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Daryl: Hey.",
        "Rex: Finally.",
        "Daryl: Here you go, player.",
        "Rex: Excellent. Now I just got to find Barry.",
        "Daryl: Who?",
        "Rex: Bookie. Roxy made a boatload of fast cash on Cristian's last fight. I want to get a piece of that myself.",
        "Daryl: You figure Vega's a lock, huh?",
        "Rex: Actually, I'm betting on the other guy.",
        "Adriana: What? You're betting against my cousin?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: Let me get this straight. I can be a silent partner. I can continue living my new life in Llanview and just collect the checks?",
        "Nash: Yep. Pretty much win-win.",
        "Claudia: It sure is.",
        "Nash: Tell you what. Just sign this and it's a done deal.",
        "Claudia: Well, I would love to, really, but I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What kind of person kidnaps a little girl, and video-tapes all the sick things that he does to them so the whole world can see? 5-year-old girls can't defend themselves. And then they blame themselves. But it wasn't my fault. And it wasn't my parents' fault. It was your fault. Yours! God, look at me. Look at me! I watched the tape. And I saw the police reports. We were people. Rose and Emily and Lauren and Tess and Jessica -- we were children. We were just growing and learning and trying to discover the world around us. But we never should have discovered this. Now, looking at you, I can only imagine the pain that you're in. Trapped in a body that's slowing dying. Well, that's nothing compared to what you're going to feel when you're burning in hell. There's nothing else for me here. I said what I came to say. Ahem.",
        "Viki: Hey. You were very, very, very brave.",
        "Jessica: When I looked at him, I remembered being at the bar. I was a little girl, and I just wanted to go home. And then I remember being led to the house. But I don't remember the things that he did to me, other than what I saw on the tape. Why don't I remember?",
        "Viki: Baby, it's really enough for today.",
        "Jessica: No.",
        "Viki: Please, let's go home.",
        "Jessica: No. Not yet. If facing Norman Leeds is not going to bring back the memories, then maybe something else will. I want to go to the bar where it all started. Would you take me there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Daryl: I'll catch you all later.",
        "Rex: Ok, before you get all upset, I think --",
        "Adriana: Too late.",
        "Rex: It's a bet, that's all. It doesn't mean I don't like the guy just because I put some --",
        "Adriana: Oh -- \"the guy\" happens to be my cousin. Whether or not you like him is completely irrelevant.",
        "Rex: Adriana? Adriana, you're missing the point.",
        "Adriana: No, no, the point is you're betting on him losing, on being completely humiliated.",
        "Rex: Whoa. Talk about putting a spin on things. Where does \"humiliation\" come into any of this? I'm betting on a guy losing a fight because it's the right thing to do. Cris hurt his hand in his last bout, so it seems kind of obvious --",
        "Adriana: Wait, wait, wait. What's this about \"the right thing\"? Why bet at all?",
        "Rex: Why do you think? Why do people bet, Adriana? Ok, multiple choice -- A, for their health, B, to feel good about themselves, C, for --",
        "Adriana: Ok, I get it -- for the money.",
        "Rex: Right. It is, and since, as you put it before, I'm not exactly loaded down with trust funds --",
        "Adriana: Well, what about all the money you're getting from Claudia Reston?",
        "Rex: Shh.",
        "Adriana: Sorry. I mean, isn't that enough? Isn't it helping?",
        "Rex: No, it isn't. I mean, yeah, it pays the rent. But if I ever want to take you on vacation or cover you in bling, I --",
        "Adriana: Oh, you think this is so amusing, don't you?",
        "Rex: Well, why isn't it? I'm not starting a war, I'm making a bet, ok? Everything has been so serious and depressing lately, can you blame me for wanting to cut loose a little, huh? Get the adrenaline flowing?",
        "Adriana: You know what? I take back what I said about how you've matured.",
        "Rex: I have. I've turned over a new leaf. It doesn't mean I've stopped being Rex Balsom. Look, I got to go make this bet before the fight starts.",
        "Adriana: Go, hurry. You don't want to miss your big chance.",
        "Rex: Come on, it's not personal. It's like in Vegas. Just because I bet red and even doesn't mean I have no respect for black and odd. Don't be mad. Please? I'll be back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Go. Go get ready for your match.",
        "Cristian: I have plenty of time.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, I'll be fine.",
        "Cristian: Would you stop worrying about distracting me? I told you -- I'll be more distracted if I don't know what's going on with you.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. I'll tell you what's going on with me. I'm going to go back in that courtroom and I'm going to show everybody in this town that I am still the best damn defense attorney they will ever see.",
        "Cristian: Close your eyes.",
        "Evangeline: And the point of that would be?",
        "Cristian: Just do it. Ok. Now, for this moment, I want you to forget that when you open your eyes, you can't see. And I want you to put yourself in a courtroom, and I want you to try to remember what it's like to feel that jury hanging on your every word. Remember that rush?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: The one you get when you nail a witness on the stand, when you get them to crack? And then -- then when you walk back to the defense table and you slowly sit down, poised and confident and in complete control of the situation? You remember that feeling? Well, that feeling has nothing to do with being able to see. It's all about what's going on in here and what's going on in here. And that is what's going to put you back on top in the courtroom again.",
        "Evangeline: I don't know how you do it. You always know exactly what to say to lift my spirits.",
        "Vincent: Vega? It's two minutes to fight time. You need to start getting warm.",
        "Cristian: I'm going to win this. I'm going to win it for you. All right.",
        "Vincent: See you after the match?",
        "Layla: One can always hope.",
        "Evangeline: I heard that, Layla.",
        "Layla: What? What did you hear?",
        "Evangeline: I heard it in your voice -- you and Vincent. Do you have any idea what you're doing?",
        "Layla: Ok. You can play protective big sister later, but now you need to play supportive girlfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: After all that, you're telling me no?",
        "Claudia: There's no way I can get my hands on this kind of money without going to daddy, and he would never allow it, not after everything you pulled the last time.",
        "Nash: The only mistake I made after everything I pulled was not bringing your dad down and leaving him bankrupt.",
        "Claudia: What happened to the new-and-improved Nash who felt terrible about stealing from me and my family when we were together?",
        "Nash: I feel terrible about taking stuff from you, but all bets were off when your daddy threatened my daughter.",
        "Claudia: Yeah, you know, you keep claiming that, but I have yet to see any proof.",
        "Nash: You want proof?",
        "Claudia: Yeah.",
        "Nash: I'll show you some proof. Here you go -- black and white. I found that in my daughter's crib while she was sleeping. That is why I got to get your daddy's resources away from him -- so he will never be able to hurt me or any of my family ever again. That's honest. Are you in or out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Do you think that Antonio was hurt that I didn't insist that he --",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, honey? It was his idea. He really thought it would be better if it was just you and your father and me.",
        "Viki: Darling, what is it?",
        "Jessica: I remember something.",
        "Young Jessica: Can you help me? Can you take me home?",
        "Jessica: God. I'm so close. I remember being in this bar, but everything that happened after Norman Leeds took me into that room, I just -- doesn't exist. It seems that way, anyway.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, your integration therapy has only just started. You really cannot try and force anything right now.",
        "Clint: Hello, Rose.",
        "Rose: You're -- you're back?",
        "Jessica: Are you the girl that helped us find Norman Leeds' house? Wait, please, please. Listen, my name's Jessica. I was a victim of him, too.",
        "Rose: Well, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jessica: Yes, you do. I saw him. I saw Norman Leeds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Did she make herself clear? I spent the last 24 hours worried sick that she wouldn't make it through this day. That the abuse you heaped on her and the atrocities you committed would weaken her and make Tess stronger, but they didn't. She overcame Tess. She overcame watching the tape and she overcame you. And now -- and now she knows what I've known all along -- that she has the ability to beat the sickness you left in place of her innocence 20 years ago, you -- you have no more power over her, Norman. So now you're going to have to deal with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: We didn't do anything wrong. It was Norman Leeds -- he did this to us. God, he took away a piece of our childhood. Rose, he doesn't have to take away our future. We have to stop living in shame. We have to stop pretending that we're ok because we're not. But we will be. Oh. We will be. You have to try to talk to someone, ok? Your father or a doctor or some friends. I know how scary this is. You just have to stop hiding.",

I'm going to go home to my family, to the woman I love and to my two beautiful daughters and I'm going to leave you here alone to die by yourself with no one to hold your hand, you filthy son of a bitch. And you can die now, old man, anytime, because jess has learned to live again.",
