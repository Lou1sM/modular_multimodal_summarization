        "Blair: Does that crown mean what I think it means? Were you voted prom queen?",
        "Starr: More like appointed, but -- um -- yeah. Can you believe it?",
        "Blair: Why didn't you tell me last night?",
        "Starr: Oh, I was -- I was just really wiped, that's all.",
        "Blair: Well, I want to know everything now, and do not leave out one detail. It's just beautiful!",
        "Starr: Well, I don't know where to start.",
        "Blair: Well, you can start by telling me how you got along with Markko. Did y'all have fun?",
        "Starr: Uh -- yes -- and no.",
        "Blair: It didn't work out?",
        "Starr: Not exactly.",

        "Cole: Hey, mom.",
        "Marty: Hey, sweetie. I didn't get a chance to talk to you last night. So, how was the prom?",
        "Cole: You really want to know?",
        "Marty: Well, of course. Did you have fun?",
        "Cole: It was the best night of my life.",
        "Marty: That's wonderful.",
        "Cole: You might not think so if you knew why.",
        "Marty: What do you mean?",
        "Cole: Starr and I got back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So we got Mike going into the room. There's the body. Vickers --",

        "Rex: Adriana? Hey -- oh --",
        "Adriana: Rex, will you keep it down?",
        "Rex: Uh -- I came here to talk to you about something kind of important. I kind of have to -- uh-uh! Oh, you slept with this son of a racist?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Hmm -- morning.",
        "Jessica: Good morning.",
        "Nash: I didn't know you were awake.",
        "Jessica: I bet you can hardly wait to sleep in a bed again.",
        "Nash: Nah, beds are so overrated --",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Nash: Unless there is a beautiful, blond, bodacious Buchanan in that bed with me.",
        "[Jessica laughs]",
        "Jessica: I can hardly wait.",
        "Nash: Then let's not.",
        "Jessica: Ooh.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Nash groans]",
        "Nash: What do they think this is, a hospital? Yeah?",
        "Viki: Hello!",
        "Jessica: Oh, hi, sweetie!",
        "Viki: Somebody wanted to see Mommy.",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, her mommy wants to see her. Hi, baby girl. Hi!",
        "Viki: Oh!",
        "Nash: Thank you for bringing her by.",
        "Viki: Well, you're welcome, and you were right. She is the absolute best medicine. Jessie, you look a thousand times better than even yesterday.",
        "Jessica: And I feel better, too. I can hardly wait to go home.",
        "Nash: And you will soon.",
        "Jessica: Not soon, now -- today. Today!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: So I take a few days off in the hospital, and what do you do -- bust the hate-crimes case without me.",
        "Talia: I wasn't without you.",
        "Antonio: Oh, no.",
        "Talia: No. The whole time I was thinking, \"God, what would Antonio do?\"",
        "[Antonio laughs]",
        "Talia: \"How would he handle this situation?\"",
        "Antonio: Oh. So then I did good?",
        "Talia: Oh, yeah, you were awesome.",
        "Antonio: Hmm -- you, too, Sahid.",
        "Talia: Thank you.",
        "Antonio: You know, there's not a lot of people I could count on these days.",
        "Cristian: Including me?",
        "Antonio: What do you want, Cris?",
        "Cristian: Well, I want my brother back. And I'm not going to leave here until that happens. So if you want me out of here, you're going to have to forgive me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I know what you're going to say, and I don't want to hear it.",
        "Marty: Cole, you know you cannot see Starr.",
        "Cole: Her dad's not around to hurt me.",
        "Marty: It is more than that.",
        "Cole: What else, huh?",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Cole: There isn't anything, except your own screwed-up ideas.",
        "Marty: Please, just listen to me on this.",
        "Cole: No, no, I'm done listening to you. I mean, if you can marry that -- that creep, then I can be with Starr.",
        "Marty: It's not the same situation.",
        "Cole: You're right, because I love Starr. Can you say the same thing about Miles?",
        "Marty: This isn't about me.",
        "Cole: You're not a hypocrite, Mom, except with this. I know it's hard without Dad around, and I know you're trying to do what you think he'd want. But with this, you're wrong. I mean, he would like Starr. She's different, she -- she's funny, she's -- she's great -- like you. Thing is, we know the mistakes that you and Mr. Manning made, and we're not going to make the same ones. All right, we were taught better -- you taught me better. So, please, Mom, don't get in the way of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: What are you doing here, Rex?",
        "Rex: I heard about Tate's dad getting busted, thought you might be taking it hard to know you've been hanging around a direct descendant of hate crimes. But, hey, having sex with the guy is one way to handle it.",
        "Adriana: Not that I owe you any explanation, but Tate spent the night on the couch.",
        "Rex: His father tried to kill your own cousin and brother. That doesn't make you nervous?",
        "Tate: You don't have to answer that, Adriana.",
        "Layla: My sister, Evangeline, is in a coma, thanks to your dad. So, yeah, I'd like to hear what Adriana has to say, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: How you doing?",
        "Nora: Hey. Good.",
        "Bo: You sure that -- that you're up for this? I mean, maybe -- why not have an assistant district attorney handle it for you?",
        "Nora: Are you kidding? I've never wanted to prosecute a case more.",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Nora: And I have you to thank for that. You really delivered well.",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Nora: I appreciate that. You set up a trap and Harmon walked right into it.",
        "Bo: If it'll stand up.",
        "Nora: Are you kidding? Caught on tape with a bomb on his person -- I mean, it doesn't get much better. I'm going for the max. I want to send a message to the rest of his little racist-pig friends out there.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, that's a good message.",
        "Nora: Yeah. I'm just sorry that it's only one man I'm putting away. He's just a drop in the bucket.",
        "Bo: I hope he's the right man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Jessie, you can't leave the hospital yet, honey.",
        "Jessica: Oh, you said it yourself. I'm looking a lot better.",
        "Viki: I know, darling, but you're not well enough to go home yet. Honey, you just had major surgery.",
        "Jessica: I know. It's hard to forget this giant cut in my stomach.",
        "Viki: Sweetie, I know how you feel. I know how you feel, but you cannot go home yet, darling. You have to be monitored.",
        "Nash: You know, I kind of got to go with your mom on this one. It's not like you're getting over a cold. You just had a liver transplant.",
        "Jessica: And my body is accepting it, and I'm feeling stronger than I have in a long time.",
        "Viki: That's fine, and we want to keep it that way. Honey, I know you want to get out of here and go back to your life, all right? But believe me, it's all still there, and it's not going anywhere.",
        "Jessica: No. Not the way Bree is right now. She's growing more and more every day. She's changing. She's -- she's learning more, and I don't want to miss anything else. Not anything at all.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nash: Oh, hey. Why don't we go with the expert on this one, huh?",
        "Paige: What is that?",
        "Nash: Jessica wants to go home. Is she ready to be released?",
        "Paige: Well, that's what I'm here to find out.",
        "Viki: Has she talked to you about this?",
        "Paige: She mentioned it, yeah. But first, I need to examine her, so if you'll excuse me --",
        "Nash: Yes.",
        "Viki: Well, we'll be right outside.",
        "Nash: Say \"Bye, Mommy.\" Say \"Bye, Mommy.\" All right, let's go.",
        "Viki: Nash, I don't want to be negative, but I --",
        "Nash: Yeah, I -- neither do I, but if Dr. Miller says it's ok, you know --",
        "Viki: But she's going to need a lot of care at home, and she's on a very strict schedule for her medicines.",
        "Nash: I know -- for the rest of her life.",
        "Viki: Yes, unfortunately.",
        "Nash: Well, you know what? Ah -- I will find out what has to be done -- it doesn't matter. As long as I am with Jessica everything's going to be fine. But I know it's not going to be easy.",
        "Viki: No, it's not going to be easy, and that's why I want her to come home to Llanfair with me when she's released.",
        "Nash: Huh. You know, with all due respect, Mrs. Davidson, Jessica and I have waited a long time to be together. Her home is with me, and that's where she's going to go.",
        "Viki: Even at the risk of her health?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: We were never brothers to begin with.",
        "Cristian: Well, no, not technically, but -- I mean, we sure were when I messed with your stuff. Crossed the line to your side of the room. Kept leaving your bike out in the rain.",
        "Antonio: That was you?",
        "Talia: Ok, Antonio, I'm out of here for an arraignment. But for what it's worth, he's been here night and day for you. You should probably cut him some slack -- in my humble opinion. I'm going to call you when I'm out of court.",
        "Antonio: Anything else you've been keeping from me?",
        "Cristian: That's about it.",
        "Antonio: Oh, good, you forget about -- forget about the bike, ok?",
        "Cristian: But not about Jessica and Nash? I honestly think the bike was worse.",
        "Antonio: Oh, really? How do you figure that?",
        "Cristian: Well, I was keeping that from you because I was looking out for my own butt.",
        "Antonio: Oh, I see.",
        "Cristian: But Jessica and Nash -- I really was trying to help you, Antonio.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, you didn't. Ok? You know, had I known, I could have fixed things.",
        "Cristian: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Antonio: Well, we'll never know, will we?",
        "Cristian: What would you have done to me? If you knew that my wife had a thing for another man, what would you have done? Would you have told me right away, or would you have waited till things blew over? You know, no harm, no foul if I never knew about it. Be honest. Would you really have laid that on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I agree -- what Tate's father did was horrible.",
        "Vincent: That is understating it by a long shot.",
        "Layla: I spent the night at my sister's bedside. She's alive, but she has no life, and she may be in a coma for the rest of her life because of your father.",
        "Vincent: Not to mention, my man, Ted. Your old man took him out.",
        "Adriana: But Tate didn't, ok? It was his father, not him.",
        "Tate: And besides, we don't know that he's the one who really did it, do we?",
        "Rex: No, he was just carrying a bomb into Lindsay's gallery to try to sell it as an art piece.",
        "Adriana: Guys, Tate is no more his father than I am Dorian, or you are Roxy.",
        "Rex: Oh, except our mothers don't run around committing hate crimes.",
        "Adriana: It doesn't give us a right to be prejudiced against Tate.",
        "Vincent: Prejudiced? Please! Harmon earned this. Nobody's born a bigot.",
        "Adriana: Exactly. Racism is not genetic. So stop judging him for something he can't control.",
        "Layla: It's totally different, Adriana.",
        "Vincent: Look, my parents were American, which makes me Black-American. Your parents were Hispanic, which makes you Hispanic.",
        "Adriana: Right, so why -- if Tate was a racist, why would he be hanging out with us?",
        "Tate: Look, if my father had anything to do with this stuff, I don't want to have anything to do with him, ok?",
        "Rex: Easy to say.",
        "Tate: I've got to get to court, all right? I'm going to go see my father and see if he is this person that everyone says he is.",
        "Layla: Oh, we're going, too. I just came home to change clothes.",
        "Vincent: Oh, well, you know what? I'm -- I'm going to wait for you in the car, sweetheart, because it's a little too damn crowded in here for me.",
        "Rex: You know, I --",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rex: I knew you were hiding something. I just wish I had pushed harder. I might been able find out what your old man was hiding. Stopped him from hurting all those people. I'll see you at the arraignment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What are you saying? Of course, we have the right guy. You caught him red-handed.",
        "Bo: No, I caught him with a bomb at Lindsay's gallery. Ears. We have nothing to really connect him to the hospital bombing, the arsons, gassing all of you at Cristian's. You know, right now, that's all purely circumstantial.",
        "Nora: But it's enough for me to build a case on, Bo, and I will, a very strong one. I really want this guy bad, Bo.",
        "Bo: Oh, I know, I know. I recognize the look in your eye, because nothing's going to stop you.",
        "Nora: No, nothing will. Listen, Harmon's our guy. Don't second-guess yourself, ok?",
        "Bo: Excuse me",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bo: Lindsay, what are you doing here?",
        "Lindsay: The guy assaulted me. He tried to kill people I know. He wanted to blow up my gallery.",
        "Bo: I -- well, yeah, and again, I want to thank you for letting us use the gallery to set him up.",
        "Lindsay: And by the way, I'm opening the \"Real Americans\" exhibit -- not as a ruse, but to show people how beautiful diversity really is.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, could you hold off on that for just a little while?",
        "Lindsay: Why? Didn't you catch the guy?",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, but you know, I -- I just want to be on the safe side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Put some pants on, for cripe's sake.",
        "David: Nama stae, John. The body is a temple. Tai chi is a spiritual awakening. I learned that in the joint.",
        "John: You must have been very popular.",
        "David: Easy.",
        "John: Hey, look, I didn't sign up for this when I sprung you.",
        "David: You sprung me, so you're responsible for me.",
        "John: Who told you that, the convict fairy?",
        "David: You know, you might want to be a lot nicer to me. Perhaps you've heard the Chinese proverb that goes \"a man cast out into the street might tell the police commissioner that you think Marty Saybrooke killed Spencer Truman.\"",
        "John: Your fly's open.",

        "Blair: Hey, I'm dying to hear everything, so tell me.",
        "Starr: Do you want to look at my crown?",
        "Blair: Sure. Oh, gosh --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Blair: It is so beautiful. Oh, I love it.",
        "Marty: Hello, Blair.",
        "Blair: What are you doing here, Marty?",
        "Cole: Starr, you didn't tell her?",
        "Blair: Tell me what?",
        "Starr: Um -- no, I didn't get a chance to talk to her yet.",
        "Blair: Oh, what's going on?",
        "Starr: Me and Cole want to be together, so we are -- together.",
        "Cole: She's right.",
        "Blair: And when did this happen?",
        "Starr: Well, you know how you were telling me how important prom night is? And that I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't go?",
        "Blair: No, no, what I said is, you should take another boy.",
        "Starr: I did, but he wasn't really a date, and me and Cole realized when we were there that we were meant to be together.",
        "Marty: Blair, just listen to them.",
        "Blair: Marty --",
        "Cole: Ms. Cramer, we tried it your way. You know that. But we were miserable the whole time.",
        "Starr: Yeah, Mom, and last night was the best night of my life. I have never been so happy, and isn't that what you want? For me to be happy?",
        "Cole: My mom gets it. Why can't you?",
        "Blair: And you approve of this, Marty?",
        "Marty: Well, Cole made a very strong argument.",
        "Blair: Well, so what?",
        "Marty: You know, Blair, no, I'm not thrilled about this, either, but what we were doing before obviously wasn't working. Now, the kids are going to be out of school for summer, and they said they didn't want to have to lie to us about being together. And I agree. So if they're going to be together, I would rather know about it than have them sneaking around behind our backs again.",
        "Starr: So how about it, Mom? Are you cool with this? Mom, look, you can't keep me locked up all summer. Cole and I are going to see each other. So, are you with us or against us?",
        "Blair: Can I get anyone a drink here? Cole, how about a beer for you? And would you like a Bloody Mary? It's still morning.",
        "Starr: Mom, what are you doing?",
        "Blair: Or how about some drugs? Marty here is a doctor. I bet you could score some good stuff for us.",
        "Marty: Blair, stop it.",
        "Blair: Why should I stop? You're the cool mom here. You don't care what the kids do, as long as you know about it.",
        "Marty: That doesn't mean I approve of them dating.",
        "Blair: Right, right. Gosh, I forgot -- you're the expert on love, aren't you? Marrying someone that you don't even know. Now, that is setting an example, Marty.",
        "Marty: We aren't talking about Miles and me.",
        "Blair: No, we're not, but why don't we? Because I think there's more to this quickie marriage than meets the eye.",
        "Marty: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Blair: I'll tell you what I do know. I know that Miles gave Todd a tip that sent him to Chicago. I know that Todd is missing. And I know that you, being Miles wife, are in this up to your pretty little neck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Keep your mouth shut about Marty Saybrooke, or I'll have you back in the yard doing chai tea or whatever it is so fast, you won't know what kicked you.",
        "David: Go ahead, make my day. Make my life.",
        "John: Forget it, Vickers. The money train has left the station. You push me, I'll call your sugar daddy in for questioning.",
        "David: You don't have a clue who he is.",
        "John: Not hard to figure out.",
        "David: I'll give you 100 guesses.",
        "John: Asa. You piss me off enough, I'll stick you guys in the cell together -- that is, if he lets you live long enough.",
        "David: You wouldn't do that.",
        "John: Try me.",

        "Viki: You know that she's going to need an awful lot of home care, and you really think you can give her better medical attention than I could at Llanfair with a nurse?",
        "Nash: Ooh, with a nurse -- I might have to buy a new outfit, but I think I'd make a pretty smashing nurse. It isn't all about drugs, ok? Bree and Jessica and I -- we are a family, we make her happy, that's important.",
        "Viki: Well, I don't think you're being very realistic at all.",
        "Nash: You sure that's really what this is about?",
        "Viki: Well, what does that mean?",
        "Nash: Mrs. Davidson, you have been great. You have been wonderful. You have given Jessica and I room to be together --",
        "Viki: \"Me.\"",
        "Nash: Me -- to be together. But you blame me for luring your daughter away from her husband, don't you? Am I wrong?",
        "Viki: Look, all I care about is my daughter's welfare -- and well-being. If she's happy with you, that's wonderful. Her medical condition is quite another story.",
        "Paige: Ok, we're done in here, if you want to come back in.",
        "Nash: Great. So, how'd it go?",
        "Jessica: Good news -- I can go home!",
        "Paige: If you promise not to do too much.",
        "Nash: Oh, I promise to keep her off her feet.",
        "Viki: Did she push you into this?",
        "Paige: I wouldn't let her. Jessica is doing very well. Now, it doesn't mean that you can resume a normal lifestyle. You still are living with Hepatitis C.",
        "Jessica: At least I'm not dying now -- that's a good thing.",
        "Nash: Ooh, the dying thing -- that sucked.",

        "Cristian: Well, there you go. And if I was one of those people, I'm sure I'd be angry for a little bit, but eventually, I'd forgive you. And you know why? Because you're my brother. And I wouldn't want to lose you for my life. You know, Antonio, when I did the \"Real Americans\" exhibit in Lindsay's gallery -- you know, the one that Bo used to catch the bomber -- these were pictures of victims, victims that I tried to turn into heroes. But you know what? The biggest hero of all wasn't there -- you.",

        "Cristian: That's not what I'm talking about. I mean, yeah, there's that, but I'm talking about my life, my whole life. You're my brother, my big brother. I looked up to you. I still do. Look, I can't make you let me back into your life, and I've said everything I have to say. I've apologized a million times, so -- the ball's in your court.",
        "Antonio: I thought you weren't leaving until I let you off the hook. That is what brothers do, right?",

Just in case you ever had any doubts over what you did, what you've done, how -- why you helped me. You could just look at her and you could know that you did it for her, if not for me. I know that you still love her.",

        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Paige: But I would not let her go if I weren't sure, especially not Jessica. I mean, Bo would never forgive me if I let anything happen to her.",

        "Viki: Yeah. You have to make time, though. Don't lose what you have with him. He's a very special guy. I wouldn't mind finding somebody like him right now, you know? I mean, my kids are grown. I have no life.",

        "Paige: Come on, I find that a little hard to believe.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm kidding, of course. But at least I don't have a man to worry about, which is a good thing. The last guy I talked to was just arrested for arson and murder.",

        "Rex: Why didn't he just plead guilty?",
        "Bo: Because technically, he's not admitting any guilt. He's probably just protecting himself against any civil suits somewhere down the road.",
