        "Starr and James are stuck together. And Hannah just happens to run into Bull who can see that she ahs taken a picture of Starr and James together. At that point, she knows she has \"leverage\" for getting Cole to believe that Starr is cheating on him and lying to him although she is not. Jessica is worried that she could have tried to kill Ford until Brody informs her that Ford has named Hannah. Right then, Kelly concludes that she is not interested in Reed and he goes back to London. Todd and Tea are still keeping the secret from Dani that she is dying and Dani is with Nate wanting to help him keep the money he's taken from James' brief case so that his (Nate's) mom won't lose her house."

        "Rex: All right, are you ready? Coming at you. Nice!",
        "Shane: Too easy.",
        "Rex: Oh, what? You want some heat?",
        "Shane: Well, I thought you said you were going to teach me your curve.",
        "Rex: Are you sure you're ready for that?",
        "Shane: Oh, please.",
        "Rex: Let me see what you have first. Okay, everybody, right now, pitching for the Phillies, Shane Morasco.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: It's all coming back. I remember what happened.",
        "John: So who attacked you? Come on, man. You said you remembered what happened.",
        "Ford: Yeah, I do. Huh.",
        "John: So fill in the blanks. Hey, look, someone tried to kill you, and now you don't want to say who. Why is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Jess, come on, you have to eat something.",
        "Jessica: I did.",
        "Kelly: You barely touched your flan.",
        "Jessica: You know, if Tess or Bess tried to kill Ford, or it was me--",
        "Kelly: But you didn't. And Tess and Bess never came out. Dr. Levin confirmed that.",
        "Jessica: He wasn't 100% sure.",
        "Kelly: I'm sure, okay?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Kelly: [Sighs] You couldn't have done this.",
        "Jessica: You should get that, Kel.",
        "Kelly: I don't need to.",
        "Jessica: You don't have to baby-sit me.",
        "Kelly: Trust me, there's nowhere I need to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Hey, babe, I'm just locking up at Kelly's office and I'm all yours. Are you kidding? Greg only thinks he can cook. [Whispering] Got to go. What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Reed: Shaun, my good man, if you would be so kind as to let me go...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So \"The Sun\" can run itself now?",
        "Kelly: It can manage fine without me for a few hours.",
        "Jessica: No, it can't, but I can. Not that I don't appreciate you being here.",
        "Kelly: Look, I just don't want to leave you alone with this. If you need someone to talk to...",
        "Jessica: What I need is for someone else to have done this.",
        "Kelly: Someone else did. You have to start believing that.",
        "Jessica: I will, okay? Now you should go.",
        "Kelly: Just don't give up, okay?",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Kelly: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Thanks.",

        "Hannah: Oh, if only Cole knew that Starr was messing around with some other guy...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Cole: Hello?",
        "Starr: Cole?",
        "Cole: Starr?",
        "Starr: Jack, if you are playing a trick on me, I swear--",
        "Cole: Starr, Starr--it's me, it's Cole.",
        "Starr: Aren't you in jail?",
        "Cole: Not anymore. A new judge gave me bail and sprung me from lockup. And the first thing I did was come looking for you. So where are you?",
        "Starr: I--I can't believe that you're free. When did this happen?",
        "Cole: A couple hours ago. I showed up at your graduation, but you had already left.",
        "Starr: You did?",
        "Cole: I wanted to be there for your big day, but... I missed you.",
        "Starr: Oh, Cole...",
        "Cole: Where are you, at the apartment?",
        "Starr: No, I'm...I'm out.",
        "Cole: At a graduation party?",
        "Starr: No, I'm just taking care of things. Why are you at Dorian's?",
        "Cole: Looking for you. You know, Langston thought that you might be here. I felt so bad the way that I left things with us.",
        "Starr: [Sighs] It's--it's okay.",
        "Cole: No, it's not. We should never have been put in this situation.",
        "[Cell phone vibrates]",
        "Cole: We should never let anyone come between us.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole's voice: Hey, it's Cole. Leave a message.",

        "Hannah: Damn you, Starr! Ugh!",
        "[Cell phone hits pavement]",
        "Bull: Drop this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I missed you so much. I wanted to be there for you when you got your diploma, but I was late for that, too.",
        "Starr: No big deal.",
        "Cole: I'm sorry. About a lot of things. Look, I don't want to do this over the phone. Can you just come meet me, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: I've got all day. Start talking.",
        "Kelly: Shaun, Reed, what is going on?",
        "Shaun: I caught him going through your desk.",
        "Kelly: Okay, put the gun away! I am sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.",
        "Reed: There is.",
        "Shaun: Well, let's hear it.",
        "Kelly: Okay, okay. Perhaps if you just back off, Shaun...",
        "Reed: Come on, mate!",
        "Shaun: I'm not your mate. This guy is a freak.",
        "Kelly: He's not a freak. Come on, he's British.",
        "Shaun: British people let themselves into other people's offices when they aren't there? I thought they were supposed to have manners.",
        "Reed: That's a stereotype, actually.",
        "Shaun: I'm not here to learn, I'm here to protect the lady. And as far as I'm concerned, you're a threat.",
        "Reed: I told him, this is a simple misunderstanding.",
        "Shaun: What's a misunderstanding? You always keep popping up places uninvited, always with that look in your eye when you're around her.",
        "Reed: If I look at Kelly a certain way, it's because--",
        "Shaun: You're a whack!",
        "Reed: I was going to say enamored of her.",
        "Shaun: Or worse, both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, look, I can't help you without a name. So tell me who attacked you or I'm taking off.",
        "Ford: I want to, but...",
        "John: But what?",
        "Ford: Uh, it's--it's kind of embarrassing, actually.",
        "John: What's embarrassing about it?",
        "Ford: I let her get the drop on me.",
        "John: Her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Brody: I thought you were having lunch with Kelly.",
        "Jessica: I was. She had to go back to work, but she gave me the day off.",
        "Brody: Day off?",
        "Jessica: She hired me back at \"The Sun.\"",
        "Brody: That's great.",
        "Jessica: You think so?",
        "Brody: Definitely. I mean, you know I'm not Todd's biggest fan, but I'm sure Kelly can keep him in check.",
        "Jessica: Count on it.",
        "Brody: I'm so happy for you. Except you don't look like you are.",
        "Jessica's voice: It makes perfect sense.",
        "Kelly's voice: Okay, just slow down.",
        "Jessica's voice: I was the one that attacked Ford. I was alone with him. I was seeing Mitch...",
        "Kelly's voice: And that's when you hit him? Jessica's voice: It must be. Kelly's voice: But you don't remember?",
        "Jessica's voice: Well, I ran out of there, and the next thing I remember, I was at my dad's house.",
        "Kelly's voice: Okay, Jessica, are you telling me that you don't remember?",
        "Brody: Jess? What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Are we even allowed to meet? Aren't there rules on where you can go and who you can see when you're out on bail?",
        "Cole: It's not like I'm wearing an ankle monitor or anything. I just have to stay in town. As long as I stay within city limits, I'll be fine.",
        "Starr: So you can go anywhere?",
        "Cole: I'll bring Hope. I mean, if she's feeling better. Wouldn't that be great? The two of us and our baby girl, the way it's supposed to be? What do you say? Name the place and I'm there.",
        "Starr: I can't.",
        "Cole: Okay. Then I'll wait here for you.",
        "Starr: No, Cole, I can't see you at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Whoa! Sign this kid up. He's got some juice.",
        "Gigi: Hey, guys.",
        "[Shane chuckles]",
        "Rex: Interference.",
        "Shane: What? No way.",
        "Gigi: Don't listen to him, Shane. He used to try that in high school.",
        "Rex: Hey, I can use all the help I can get, okay? You going to stick around and watch the best pitcher this side of the Mississippi?",
        "Gigi: I would love to, but I have to get to work.",
        "Rex: Oh. Well, that's too bad. I was hoping...I was hoping tonight, we could...",
        "Shane: What are you whispering about, Dad?",
        "Rex: Whispering? I wasn't whispering. Was I whispering?",
        "Gigi: Totally.",
        "Shane: So, what's going on? What's the big secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reed: Shaun! Really, this is bollocks.",
        "Kelly: Shaun, stop it. I think he's had enough.",
        "Shaun: I haven't!",
        "Kelly: Okay. I am sure that he has a very good reason why he was rifling through my things.",
        "Shaun: Let's hear it.",
        "Reed: I was merely looking for a writing implement so that I could leave you a note.",
        "Kelly: Okay. All right. See, that makes sense.",
        "Shaun: Texting hasn't come to Britain?",
        "Reed: Oh, silly me. I forgot that appreciation for the handwritten note had died alongside romance and chivalry.",
        "Shaun: And you're going to be next.",
        "Kelly: Okay, thank you. I can take it from here. Okay, Shaun? Okay? Thank you very much for protecting me. I appreciate it, but I don't think that Reed is a threat. At least not to me.",
        "Shaun: That's not your job to decide.",
        "Kelly: Okay, okay! All right. If he gets any ideas, you will be perfectly positioned right outside my office, okay?",
        "Shaun: But--",
        "Kelly: Thank you, Shaun! Thank you!",
        "Reed: I could have taken him.",
        "Kelly: Of course.",
        "Reed: But thanks for the save.",
        "Kelly: Sure, anytime.",
        "Reed: And I thought I had made inroads with Shaun.",
        "Kelly: Oh. Because of the snack you gave him at the Palace?",
        "Reed: Well, who doesn't love a late night snack?",
        "Kelly: Ha, ha. Not me.",
        "Reed: He still thinks I'm up to something untoward. What's it going to take before he trusts me around you?",
        "Kelly: Well, probably hell freezing over. Shaun is paid to protect me. And you really haven't gone out of your way to reassure the guy.",
        "Reed: Meaning?",
        "Kelly: Meaning--I don't know--I do--I do think it is a little weird, you in my office, alone.",
        "Reed: So now you don't trust me, either?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: It can be later if you're busy.",
        "Starr: Oh, I can't do later.",
        "Cole: What do you mean, you can't? Are you saying you don't want to see me?",
        "Starr: No. It's not that at all. It's not. I want to see you, it's--it's just that I can't.",
        "Cole: Why not?",
        "Starr: It's complicated.",
        "Cole: Then explain it to me.",
        "Starr: Cole, I can't. Look, you just have to trust me, okay? It's better if we stay away from each other right now. I--I really--I have to go.",
        "Cole: No, wait, wait. Starr, Starr, Starr--look, just--just hear me out, okay? I know things have been screwed up between us. And that's on me. It's all on me. But just--just give me a chance to fix it, okay? Please. I can't do that without you. Please. Just please tell me that you still believe in us.",
        "Starr: Cole...",
        "Cole: Please meet me. Let me make things right.",
        "Starr: I can't right now, okay? It just isn't safe.",
        "Cole: Safe? Safe for what? Starr, I don't understand. Are you in some kind of trouble?",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bull: You should be more careful of your stuff.",
        "Hannah: Sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.",
        "Bull: It's okay.",
        "Hannah: I hope my phone's not broken.",
        "Bull: I think it's working fi-- these friends of yours?",
        "Hannah: Uh--sort of. I know the girl.",
        "Bull: No kidding. Starr Manning?",
        "Hannah: Yeah.",
        "Bull: Well, this is my lucky day, 'cause I need to find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What makes you think that there's something wrong?",
        "Brody: Because I know you, Jess. Remember what I said the night of Bo and Nora's wedding, on the roof of the Angel Square Hotel?",
        "Jessica: I'll never forget.",
        "Brody: What did I say?",
        "Jessica: That I was your home.",
        "Brody: Not just that.",
        "Jessica: That you'll always be there for me.",
        "Brody: And I'll never let go of the rope.",
        "Jessica: I remember.",
        "Brody: Okay. So believe it. If there's something bothering you, tell me what it is.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: There is something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So you're saying your assailant was female?",
        "Ford: Like I said, she got the drop on me. I--I wasn't expecting her to do something like this.",
        "John: You know her?",
        "Ford: Well, we're not best friends, but I--yeah, I knew enough about her that I should have known better, I guess.",
        "John: You think you should have seen it coming?",
        "Ford: Now, hell, yeah. She's messed up. Seriously messed up.",
        "John: In what way?",
        "Ford: Okay, anyone else her age would have, you know, been cool and--and moved on when I was done with her, but not this one. She--she went postal. She couldn't take it. So I figure she's got some kind of complex or something about sex. You know what I mean?",
        "John: Because she wouldn't move on when you told her?",
        "Ford: Exactly. She took it personally, and got all offended when I didn't turn out to be her Prince Charming or whatever. I mean, I never said I would be some kind of knight in shining armor, you know?",
        "John: Not really, no.",
        "Ford: Uh-huh.",
        "John: Look, this is all very informative, but I need a positive I.D. You need to give me a name.",
        "Ford: All right. Her name is...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reed: You know you have nothing to fear then?",
        "Kelly: No, of course. I know that. We've known each other a long time.",
        "Reed: So you're not suspicious?",
        "Kelly: No. No. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let you take me out on a date, Shaun or no Shaun.",
        "Reed: Well, I'm glad to hear it, because I was beginning to worry that maybe you were buying into Mr. Bodyguard's paranoia.",
        "Kelly: Shaun is paid to protect me, and he does a very good job, but he doesn't choose who I spend time with, I do.",
        "Reed: Well, then I'm doubly honored to be able to spend this time alone with you now.",
        "Kelly: For what?",
        "Reed: Another date.",
        "Kelly: Oh.",
        "Reed: Well, what did you think I meant?",
        "Kelly: Nothing.",
        "Reed: So how about it?",
        "Kelly: I would love to, but I can't. I am in the middle of this huge story at work.",
        "Reed: Tonight then.",
        "Kelly: Well, I don't know when I'm going to be getting out. It might be late.",
        "Reed: Tomorrow?",
        "Kelly: You know what? Call me. Call me and we will see how it just all shakes out.",
        "Reed: Yeah, I could do that. Or you could just save us both the trouble and tell me if I'm wasting my time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr, what's wrong?",
        "Starr: You know what's wrong. It's the two of us.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Starr: You said it yourself. I can't pretend that everything is okay.",
        "Cole: Look, I'm not trying to. I know we've got problems.",
        "Starr: But you think if we see each other--",
        "Cole: I know we can't fix things overnight, but we can work on--",
        "Starr: I just need time to think. You understand that, right?",
        "Cole: Look, Starr, come on.",
        "Starr: You wanted the same thing before.",
        "Cole: I was behind bars, all right? I couldn't think straight.",
        "Starr: That's the only reason you said that?",
        "Cole: You don't know what it's like to sit there all day and night and not know what's going on, and have people come up to you and tell you all kinds of crazy things.",
        "Starr: You'd be surprised.",
        "Cole: I'm sorry that I pushed you away. I don't want that anymore. I hate that I hurt you.",
        "Starr: Cole...",
        "Cole: All I want to do is make it up to you. I just want to be with you.",
        "Starr: I want that, too. More than anything.",
        "Cole: Okay, then...",
        "Starr: I just...I have to be sure that it's right.",
        "Cole: What do you mean?",
        "Starr: That there's nothing else in the way.",
        "Cole: What, is this about Hannah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: You're looking for Starr?",
        "Bull: Well, it's not really her I'm looking for, it's her boyfriend.",
        "Hannah: Cole? Well, what do you want with him?",
        "Bull: The guy in the picture--his name's James.",
        "Hannah: Oh, right. Yeah, I heard that Starr dumped Cole and hooked up with some new guy. But I'm, you know--I don't really catch up with the gossip. I mean, Starr and I--we're not really buddy-buddy.",
        "Bull: Well, then why is there a picture in your phone?",
        "Hannah: Well, um--I was just taking some random shots. You know, new phone. Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Bull: So you can't put me in touch with her?",
        "Hannah: Well, you never know. I mean, I run into her from time to time. If I see her, is there a message I could pass along for you?",
        "Bull: That's all right.",
        "Hannah: You sure?",
        "Bull: Best not to say anything. Wouldn't want her to get spooked, do something stupid.",
        "Hannah: Spooked to what?",
        "Bull: Oh, taking off with--with the guy. He's trouble.",
        "Hannah: Well, wait, wait--Starr took off?",
        "Bull: Last I heard, yeah. As far as I can tell, they've gone to ground. Which is bad news for Starr. James is going to get her hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, please, I really don't want to talk about Hannah.",
        "Langston: You're still here?",
        "Cole: Is it because she showed up at my hearing?",
        "Starr: Hannah was there?",
        "Cole: She went looking for me at my cell, and they told her that I was in court.",
        "Starr: I'm glad you had someone there.",
        "Cole: I didn't ask her to come.",
        "Starr: I would have skipped my graduation ceremony to be there for you, too, if I had known that you wanted me there.",
        "Cole: I want you with me now.",
        "Starr: I know you do, but I can't, just not yet.",
        "Cole: You serious?",
        "Starr: I will call you when I'm ready.",
        "Cole: When will that be? How long do you need?",
        "Starr: I don't know. Uh--a day or two. I'm not sure.",
        "Cole: We love each other. Everything else is just--",
        "Starr: Goodbye, Cole.",
        "[Hangs up phone]",
        "Cole: Starr!",
        "Langston: Starr finally called? What'd she say?",
        "Cole: She's hiding from me. She doesn't want to see me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You okay?",
        "Starr: No, I'm not. I just lied to my boyfriend, and it is all your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Whatever it is, Jess, you can tell me.",

        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: I was just so confused, and you had told me all that stuff about my father, and I was just scared, and I just wanted it all to go away, and I--",

        "Brody: Yeah, John.",
        "John: Brody, I have an assignment for you. I need you to pick someone up.",
        "Brody: Who?",

        "Gigi: We're dating.",
        "Shane: You are?",

        "Gigi: We're taking it slow.",
        "Rex: Don't want to mess things up again.",
        "Gigi: We want to be really sure. And we want you to be sure, too, so...how do you feel about it? You okay with it?",

        "Shane: So we gonna keep playing or what?",

        "Brody: I'll take care of it.",
        "John: I have a few loose ends to tie up here at the hospital. I'll meet you at the station later. All right. Well, I'm having her brought in. Before I question her, I want you to take me through the night you were attacked one more time.",
        "Ford: What for? I already told you what happened.",
        "John: I need to know what made this girl flip out.",

        "Jessica: What did John say? Ford knows who did it?",
        "Brody: Apparently, everything came back to him. He remembered the whole night. He ID'd the person who attacked him.",

        "Cole: I get out of jail and all I want to do is see her. Call me dumb, but... you would think that she would feel the same way. But she couldn't get off that phone any faster.",
        "Langston: Well, maybe everything's just hitting her now.",
        "Cole: I don't know. She said that she needed time to think.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, I can see that. I mean, you basically told her the same thing...",
        "Cole: Look, I know what I told her. She just--I don't know. I mean, what--is this-- is this, like, payback or something?",
        "Langston: No. You know Starr's not petty like that. No, but--if she says she needs time, she needs time.",
        "Cole: What does that--what does that mean? Like, h-how long?",
        "Langston: I don't know. You just have to be patient.",
        "Cole: Easy for you to say.",
        "Langston: Yeah. It kind of is, knowing you two.",

        "James: How is lying to your boyfriend my fault?",
        "Starr: Cole just got out of jail a couple hours ago and I'm just now finding out, because of you. He also came to see me at my graduation and I missed him because I was being hauled off by you!",
        "James: You mean when I was saving your life.",
        "Starr: Because someone was chasing after you! I would be at home right now with Cole and our daughter if you hadn't have dragged me along and made me your little accomplice.",
        "James: You're right. You'd be at home with your family right now if it weren't for me. I can-- I can cop to that.",
        "Starr: Good. That's very big of you.",
        "James: But don't think you're doing yourself any favors by acting like I killed your cat, too.",
        "Starr: Excuse me?",
        "James: All your problems aren't my fault, Starr.",
        "Starr: Oh, it's not? It's someone else's? Someone else who stole 50 grand from a gangster and lost the money? Who carjacked my car? Who now has a gun-toting maniac after me thinking that I'm the key to his cash back?",
        "James: I never said it wasn't me.",
        "Starr: I only had 2 choices. I either lie to Cole or I tell him the truth and make him another target for Bull.",
        "James: So you lied to Cole.",
        "Starr: Yeah! And we might fall apart, and if we do, that is all on you.",
        "James: I'm sorry. I--I must have dreamt that conversation we had in the park the other day when you told me that your boyfriend was in jail and didn't want to see you.",
        "Starr: You don't know...",
        "James: No, that couldn't have happened, right, because your fairy tale love is so rock-solid and no one could ever come in between 2 perfect people like you, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: So this James guy. Why is he bad news?",
        "Bull: Well, he's one of these guys who can sell a girl on anything. He's got this charm that will make a person do things for him--things they don't normally want to do.",
        "Hannah: I know the type.",
        "Bull: Sorry to hear that. Well, anyway, a nice girl like Starr might get taken in. Try and help the guy and not realize that she's putting herself in harm's way.",
        "Hannah: I really wish I could help you find her, but... I just wouldn't know where to look.",
        "Bull: Oh, that's right. You're not close.",
        "Hannah: But that doesn't mean I want to see a bad guy like James get his hooks into her, you know?",
        "Bull: What about the ex? I mean, would he be able to find out...where she is? This Cole dude?",
        "Hannah: No. Definitely not. I mean, they're so over it's, like, not even funny.",
        "Bull: Tell you what--I'll give you my number. That way, if you do see Starr and James, all you gotta do is give me a call and let me know where I can find them.",
        "Hannah: Yeah?",
        "Bull: And don't worry. I won't mention any names. Starr will never know that you were the one that rang me up.",

        "Reed: So do I. But, Kelly, work isn't everything.",
        "Kelly: No. My family is extremely important to me, too.",
        "Reed: I'd love to spend time with them. They seem like lovely people. It's not what you want, though, is it? Me getting closer to you.",
        "Kelly: Reed--",
        "Reed: I've made my feelings known to you, but you've been coy about doing the same.",
        "Kelly: I like you a lot.",
        "Reed: That's not enough.",
        "Kelly: What do you mean?",
        "Reed: I have business to attend to back in London.",
        "Kelly: Wait. You said you are working here now.",
        "Reed: Don't you understand? My business with Clint was concluded days after I got here. The only reason that I've stayed in Llanview so long was so that I could see you.",
        "Kelly: Okay, Reed, you know what? I thought I made it really clear that I needed to take things slow.",
        "Reed: I've no problem with that. But I can't help but feeling that you're biding your time in order to say that you put in the minimum amount of effort.",
        "Kelly: What?",
        "Reed: Then you can just say it didn't work out when the truth is, you never really gave us a chance.",
        "Kelly: That is not true.",
        "Reed: Isn't it? That's just like the time in London. You kept yourself unavailable so that you didn't have to feel whatever it was you were going through.",
        "Kelly: I don't think you had a clue what I was feeling then or now.",
        "Reed: Well, then, show me!",
        "Kelly: What would you like me to do?",
        "Reed: Let me know you feel something. Anything! Show me what it will take to get a reaction out of you.",
        "Kelly: Reed. Reed! You son of a bitch. How's that for a reaction?",
        "Reed: I'm sorry. I know I was out of line, but--",
        "Shaun: Are you okay?",
        "Kelly: I'm fine, Shaun.",
        "Reed: I didn't mean to break it. I will gladly replace it.",
        "Shaun: He did this?",
        "Reed: It's just a vase.",
        "Shaun: It's not just a vase. It was Kelly's mother's!",
        "Reed: Your mother gave that to you?",
        "Kelly: It was the last thing my mother gave me before she died.",
        "Reed: I am so sorry. I had no idea.",
        "Kelly: You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Because all of this is way too much too soon. I thought I was ready to try something out with you, but I'm not. And it's all can do to deal with my mother's death, and I really can't deal with anyone else right now.",
        "Reed: I understand. I'll go.",
        "Shaun: Yeah, right out the window. Just stop. I think Reed knows where I am now.",
        "Reed: Kelly, I never meant for this to happen. I just thought I'd give you a little push. If you ever come to London, please.",
        "Kelly: It'll be to see my son.",
        "Shaun: Let's go, freak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I never said that Cole and I were perfect.",
        "James: I know. I didn't mean to put down what you two have. Sorry if I sounded harsh.",
        "Starr: You weren't. You were just being honest.",
        "James: Yeah, well, I could've been nicer about it.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you could have. But you probably wouldn't have gotten your point across if you hadn't been such a jerk.",
        "James: Well, that's me. One jerk, at your service.",
        "Starr: But you were right. Cole and I were on thin ice way before you came along.",
        "James: Well, nothing like being forced to go AWOL the day he makes bail to try and make things work, though, right?",
        "Starr: Look, just because Cole got out of jail, it doesn't mean that it would take away all of our problems.",
        "James: Yeah?",
        "Starr: I feel stuck.",
        "James: Stuck how?",
        "Starr: I had to lie to Cole... because it's safer for us to be apart, but really I--I want him to see through it, because if he believes what I said-- that I need to be away from him-- maybe he'll start to think that we aren't gonna make it.",

        "Brody: I gotta go. John wants me to grab our suspect.",
        "Jessica: Whoa. So who was it?",
        "Brody: Already back to being a reporter.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I guess so. So who did Ford say it was?",
        "Brody: This stays off the record?",
        "Jessica: Of course. Who was it?",

        "Gigi: It did, it did.",
        "Rex: I was thinking tomorrow. At the quarry. We could go swimming. Have a picnic. It'll be like senior skip day.",
        "Gigi: Except this time, no diving in 3 feet of water.",
        "Shane: Who's diving in 3 feet of water?",
        "Rex: Hey! She's gotta go to work.",
        "Gigi: So long, sweetie. Oh, um, ahem, if he decides to show you his curve ball, move in.",
        "Shane: Ha ha. See you, Mom.",

        "Kelly: You're a really good protector. But I think I needed to get hurt this time.",
        "Shaun: I can't co-sign on that.",
        "Kelly: You know what? Reed and I were never gonna make it. I wasn't ready. I just wish it didn't cost me the last thing my mother ever gave me.",
        "Shaun: Never underestimate the power of super glue.",
        "[Kelly laughs]",
        "Kelly: Maybe. Maybe. But let's face it, you know, it's--it's not exactly the prettiest vase in the world, and .",
        "[Kelly sniffles]",
        "Kelly: I don't know. I feel like maybe she was daring me to accidentally destroy it. Ha ha ha.",
        "Shaun: Well, if you need anything, I'll be right outside, okay?",

I have a list of places where she might turn up here in Llanview. Yeah, I'm sure. If I can find her, I can find James.",

        "James: I feel really bad that you had to lie to Cole.",
        "Starr: It was the only way.",
        "James: Yeah, because I carjacked you and got you into this mess. Now I gotta find a way to get you out.",
        "Starr: You'll find one.",
        "James: I better do it soon. Because if something happens to you and your boyfriend, I'll never forgive myself.",

        "Cole: Hannah, what are you doing here?",
        "Hannah: I had to come find you. You ran out of the bail hearing so fast, we didn't get a chance to finish our conversation.",
        "Cole: I needed to get to Starr. I still do.",
        "Hannah: Maybe she's with her new boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: The thing is that I don't know what else to do except to give Bull back his money. It's not like I've got an extra 50 grand laying around.",
