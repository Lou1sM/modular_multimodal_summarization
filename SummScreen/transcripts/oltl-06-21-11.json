        "While it seems there is no hope for Gigi and doctors determine that her heart could save Clint, Natalie is torn between respecting her brother's and Gigi's wishes and saving her father. Viki is in a similar situation. Clint reminds them that Rex has no legal authority to prevent him from having Gigi's heart since he is not her husband nor a family member. But Rex tells Clint he will have to kill him in order for Clint to have Gigi's heart. Meanwhile, Tea is ready to represent Jack and goes with him to the station when John questions him for what happened to Gigi. But Rex finds her and tells her if she wants to help him and Gigi, as she says, she can do so by using her legal expertise to help him to marry Gigi. Jessica is back and ready to keep Robert Ford away from her and baby Ryder. He protests that he loves his son and loves Tess. But she is not buying that and it appears Tess is not coming back. Starr meets a strange guy at the student union who wants to inspire her to listen to new music, who informs her he is a musician and whom she wants to help get known in town at places like Capricorn and Ultra Violet. Blair goes to New York and finds out that Tomas is legally married although he protests he wants to divorce the wife who means nothing to him. She tells Blair he is lying. It seems there are some secrets involving that."

        "Ford: Tess? Oh, thank God. I was so worried when I couldn't find you back at the motel.",
        "Jessica: Ford, I--",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Baz: I think the term is listening, till you so rudely interrupted me.",
        "Starr: It's not rude when it's my mp3. Where's all my music?",
        "Baz: I got rid of it. It was too vanilla. Don't worry. I gave you some of mine. Trust me, you'll like it much better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm here to see Tom\u00e1s Delgado.",
        "Yvette: Oh?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. I'm a friend of his. And who are you?",
        "Yvette: His wife.",
        "Blair: No. Tom\u00e1s Delgado. He is no married-o.",
        "Yvette: Ah, oui. Tom\u00e1s Delgado is married. To me. Les Americans sont si gauches.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Checked with Forensics like you asked. They're still putting together their report on the carbon monoxide poisoning.",
        "John: Light a fire under them, all right? We're not gonna get Manning without evidence.",
        "Cop: Which Manning?",
        "John: I don't care. They're both guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You want me to spill my guts here? Now? They could totally be listening.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ok.",
        "Todd: Don't be paranoid.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're one to talk. Jack, listen to me. You are safe. This conversation is privileged, meaning no one can use what you say here against you.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but--",
        "Todd: You don't have a choice.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your father's right. Until he's released, there is nowhere else the three of us can discuss a strategy for keeping you out of prison.",
        "Jack: Could that really happen?",
        "T\u00e9a: Gigi Morasco is brain dead. Unless a miracle occurs, you could very likely be charged with murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: God, the injustice of it all. What is it, honey?",
        "Natalie: Rex should be here with Gigi. Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Your mind is going with your heart, old man. You're not making sense.",
        "Clint: It makes perfect sense. Think about it.",
        "Rex: There is no way you're getting Gigi's heart.",
        "Clint: I'm at the top of the transplant list. Gigi is an organ donor. Shane is her next of kin, but he's not of age, so he can't challenge. And you didn't marry her, so you can't challenge, either. Now, you may not want me to have Gigi's heart, but you do not have a say in this matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Whoa! What the hell's going on?",
        "Jessica: I'm not Tess, you jerk. I'm Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Ha ha! No. Tom\u00e1s is not married. He would've told me.",
        "Yvette: Yes, because American men are known for being honest with their skinny, little sex toys.",
        "Blair: I'm not his sex toy, ok? In fact, Tom\u00e1s and I haven't even--",
        "Yvette: Haven't what?",
        "Blair: You don't know one thing about me.",
        "Yvette: Au contraire. I believe I know more about you than you know about--of course! You are the woman from Tom\u00e1s' painting. Ah!",
        "Blair: The--the painting? The one that he did of me from a picture from a flea market photo?",
        "Yvette: Is this the story he told you? I hate that painting. For years, Tom\u00e1s polluted my vision with the bust of that horrible giraffe woman. And now I find out he went looking for you. My husband is sick.",
        "Blair: He can't be married.",
        "Yvette: You still don't believe me? Ask him yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I can't believe it. You deleted all of my music?",
        "Baz: Believe me, your ears will thank you.",
        "Starr: Who do you think you are, stealing my private property and vandalizing it?",
        "Baz: Sue me for trying to enlighten you.",
        "Starr: Maybe I will, after I call Campus Security.",
        "Baz: Wait! Calm down. Look. Your precious Muzak lives on in my laptop. If you're really that in love with it, I'll put it back.",
        "Starr: Do it.",
        "Baz: Don't you at least want to listen?",
        "Starr: Now.",
        "Baz: Fine. I will be happy to restore your mp3 player to its depressing state of mediocrity. Under one condition.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What'd I miss?",
        "T\u00e9a: Releasing him.",
        "Todd: So I guess this means that you haven't found Marty, and you can't prove that I had anything to do with her escape.",
        "John: No statute of limitations on this one, buddy, and for you, I got all the time in the world.",
        "Todd: Ok. Do you mind...",
        "John: Yeah. . Mind. We're gonna have a little chat about your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Did you get ahold of Rex?",
        "Natalie: It went straight to voicemail.",
        "Viki: Honey, he's probably with Shane.",
        "Natalie: No. No, Shane's with Roxy, because Rex didn't want him in the room when the doctors were talking about Gigi being an organ donor.",
        "Viki: God, this is so--",
        "Natalie: Rex is in so much pain, Mom. I want to help him through this, but I can't help but think of Dad, too, and I don't know how to help them both.",
        "Viki: I know. I know, sweetie.",
        "Natalie: Uhh! How did you-- how did you handle it when it was Ben?",
        "Viki: I loved him very much, and I couldn't--I couldn't bear to let him go.",
        "Natalie: That's exactly how Rex feels.",
        "Viki: Maybe Rex just needs a little time alone, you know.",
        "Natalie: That's what I'm worried about. Because there's no telling what he would do. Rex was a wreck the last time I saw him.",
        "Viki: Well, I'll tell you what. Go and find him then, ok? I'm gonna stay with Gigi.",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "Viki: Ok.",
        "[Natalie sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You out of your mind? Gigi and I were living together. We were engaged. This happened on our wedding day, ok? We were gonna get married--",
        "Clint: But you didn't.",
        "Rex: It was obvious what she wanted, ok? Any court would see that.",
        "Clint: Wrong. You need a better understanding of the law. Do you think I would be this confident if I weren't sure about how this was gonna end?",
        "Rex: Do you think I care how you feel? Gigi is off limits to you, ok? Now and forever.",
        "Clint: You're free to argue with the hospital's attorneys, but you are going to lose. And do you think you want to spend Gigi's last hours on earth in a courtroom? Oh, Rex. You should go to her. You should be by her side. Take her hand, tell her that you love her, and say good-bye.",
        "Rex: You first.",
        "Clint: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Rex: Putting you out of your misery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Did the Buchanans grab you? Is that what happened? They got you and now you're pretending to be Jessica...",
        "Jessica: I told you I'm not-",
        "Ford: Listen, listen, you don't have to do it anymore. I talked to Cutter. He agreed to give you a divorce. Look--it's all signed and sealed right here. Ok? Look, you're in the clear. You just have to come with me. All right? We'll get married.",
        "Jessica: Don't touch me. Look, whatever you did to get this guy to give me a divorce, thank you very much, but if you think I'm trading one sleazeball in for another, you have lost your mind.",
        "Ford: You really are Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Exactly.",
        "Ford: Tess, please. I know you're in there. Come out and talk to me.",
        "Jessica: It's not happening. Tess is gone, and she's never coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, I can't believe that it's been 3 1/2 years. Only. I feel like I've known you forever. I will never forget how you welcomed me into the family at the Bon Jour with no hesitation. With open arms. You lit that place up whenever you walked in. Actually, you do that everywhere you go. It's kind of impossible to feel unloved and weak when we're near you, because you have so much love and so much strength to spare, and you're just not stingy with it. You came into my life, Gigi, at a time when I was really lost. Thanks to you and the Bon Jour, I found myself in Paris, Texas. That's a debt I can never repay. Oh, I know. I know you would just brush it off, but I'm going to try. Honey, I'm here with you, and I offer you all my love, and all my strength, and you take it, ok? You take whatever you need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You don't want to do this.",
        "Rex: I'll do anything to protect Gigi.",
        "Clint: Rex, there's nothing left to protect. She's gone.",
        "Rex: Not as long as I'm still here. Putting her heart inside of you would be a sick, cruel joke. I'm not gonna let that happen.",
        "Clint: If you kill me, you will go to prison, and then what about Shane?",
        "Rex: I'll take care of you, then I'll take care of Shane.",
        "Clint: You think about this.",
        "Rex: I have. Plenty. It's time to stop thinking and start doing.",
        "[Clint screaming]",
        "Natalie: Rex, what are you doing?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's not my fault what happened to Gigi.",
        "T\u00e9a: Jack. Please release my husband.",
        "John: He can't be released until his paperwork is cleared.",
        "T\u00e9a: What's the holdup?",
        "John: It seems the paperwork has gone missing, so...hey, what do you say we use this time productively? What do you say, Jack?",
        "T\u00e9a: What business do you have with my stepson?",
        "John: Well, it's the business about the problems that Jack had at the high school with Shane Morasco.",
        "Todd: Where are you getting your information, John--the girls' locker room?",
        "T\u00e9a: The Llanview High School administration has never suspended or even disciplined Jack Manning for any reason whatsoever. It is my understanding that the same thing cannot be said for Shane Morasco.",
        "John: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I don't think Shane got into all that trouble on his own, though.",
        "Todd: Since when do you care?",
        "John: Since Gigi wound up brain dead because of your son's problems. The way we see it, Gigi was lured to a trap that was meant for Shane. Jack here did the luring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Let me get this straight. You swipe my mp3, you trash my tunes...",
        "Baz: I relocated them.",
        "Starr: You replaced them with your supposedly better music, and I ask you nicely to put my music back on there, and you say, \"under one condition\"?",
        "Baz: That about covers it.",
        "Starr: I'm not going out with you, buddy.",
        "Baz: What makes you think I want to date you?",
        "Starr: Nothing. You know, I don't care what you want. I just want--I want my mp3 player back and-- fine. You know what? Whatever. I'll replace the music myself.",
        "Baz: Hold up. My one condition is that you just give it a chance. Pick any song on this mp3 player, listen to it from start to finish, and then tell me it's not better than anything you already have.",
        "Starr: Unbelievable.",
        "Baz: Don't be so closed-minded. This is college. We're supposed to be challenging our preconceptions, expanding our horizons.",
        "Starr: And you think your music will do that for me?",
        "Baz: It's a start.",
        "Starr: Arrogant much?",
        "Baz: If you hate it, feel free to call Security.",
        "Starr: And then I can tell you how pretentious and snotty you are.",
        "Baz: Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Blair, what are you doing here?",
        "Blair: I guess I could ask you the same thing.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I told you I had business.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. And I came to surprise you, because I thought maybe you'd take me out on that date that you owe me. But I guess I'm the one that is surprised here.. you didn't come here to meet your gallery owner, did you? You came here to see your wife. Are you gonna deny that you're married?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No. I am married, but I can explain.",
        "Blair: You lying bastard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music playing in headphones]",
        "Starr: Done.",
        "Baz: So?",
        "Starr: You're pretentious and snobby. Can I have my music back now?",
        "Baz: You really didn't like it?",
        "Starr: It was catchy.",
        "Baz: And?",
        "Starr: And it had an insanely long percussion loop, which was cool.",
        "Baz: That's it?",
        "Starr: Look, I appreciate electronica. It's just dubstep is a little inaccessible.",
        "Baz: I didn't know anyone on this side of the Atlantic knew what dubstep was.",
        "Starr: Maybe you need to challenge your preconceptions. Anyway, I've heard worse.",
        "Baz: Heard worse, huh? I'll be sure to add that to the liner notes.",
        "Starr: Why would you--",
        "Baz: Because I made the music.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Blair, wait.",
        "Yvette: You've got a beautiful swing. You know, if you weren't already married, I'd tell you to keep this--",
        "Blair: Let go, Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Not until you hear what I have to say.",
        "Blair: Why? So you can continue to lie to me? Cover up the truth?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: The truth is that Yvette and I are married, but we ceased to be husband and wife a long time ago.",
        "Blair: I thought you weren't gonna try to cover up the truth, Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm not. We're separated. We have been for years.",
        "Blair: Really? Then why haven't you all pulled the trigger?",
        "Yvette: He can't let go.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That's not true. Yvette is the one who's holding things up. She's had the divorce papers for years, but she refuses to sign them.",
        "Blair: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Because she doesn't matter to me anymore. She's not a part of my life.",
        "Blair: It matters to me that you're married!",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Does that ruin any chance that we have at a future?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Is that really how you're gonna play it, John? You can't get at me directly so you go through my son?",
        "T\u00e9a: Has any accusation been made against Jack??",
        "John: Rex Balsom's come forward.",
        "Todd: I can't wait for that idiot to take the stand.",
        "T\u00e9a: It won't come to that.",
        "Todd: That's right. Because Jack didn't do anything.",
        "John: Is that it, Jack? You didn't do anything? We're finding a lot of evidence in that basement where Gigi was found. Hair. Fibers. Fingerprints. We're tracing the ISP address from the computer that sent Shane that invitation.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sounds like you have a whole lot of nothing.",
        "John: Maybe. Maybe, Counselor, but you know, when that forensic report comes back, I have a funny feeling it's gonna be pointing at just one person. So what do you say, Jack? You think it's about time you tell us your side of the story?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What are you doing?",
        "Rex: Saving Gigi!",
        "Clint: He's trying to kill me.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Rex: He's trying to kill Gigi!",
        "Natalie: Rex, no. Dad had nothing...",
        "Rex: He'd like nothing better than to see her die!",
        "Natalie: Don't you say that.",
        "Rex: Don't you get it? He's trying to kill her, so that he can live. He's got it all planned out. Tell her, Clint.",
        "Clint: I told him the facts.",
        "Natalie: What facts?",
        "Clint: Gigi made her intentions very clear when she signed her organ donor card.",
        "Rex: And when I said that I wouldn't allow it, he said that it wouldn't matter, that the only person who could stop that from happening is Gigi's husband, and since we're not married...",
        "Natalie: I don't know what to say.",
        "Rex: Say you understand where I'm coming from! Say you know what it's like to see the person you love laying on a hospital bed! Just say that if somebody tried to rip Jared's--that you would do anything possible to stop it.",
        "Clint: Oh, God. That was low.",
        "Natalie: Ok, you know what? That's enough. That's enough, both of you. Ok, we're all a little strung out here. I think we just need to take a step back.",
        "Rex: Why? So I can change my mind? Clint is gonna have to climb out of that bed himself and rip me apart with his own bare hands before I let him touch the woman I love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Ok, there's something I need to tell you. I've been keeping a secret. Well, I never intended to keep a secret from you, but on this particular subject, you never gave me a choice. And it's about the rent that you were paying me for the carriage house after you and Shane moved in. I really, really wish that you had not so stubbornly insisted that you pay me money I totally didn't need. But you wouldn't take no for an answer, and I didn't want to hurt your pride, so I accepted the money, guiltily, I might add, 'cause I knew how hard you worked for it. Honey, you have to know that that money never was, never will be mine, ok? I put it all into an account for Shane to pay for his college tuition. I promise you, I promise you, I will see to it that Shane gets the education you wanted for him. I know how much you worry about him. Oh, God, you have to stop worrying now, ok, and just rest and be at peace. And I swear on my own family that I will take care of yours.",

        "Ford: I don't understand. Just a couple hours ago, everything was fine.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, for you, but for --",
        "Ford: Let Tess out. I want to talk to Tess.",
        "Jessica: Go ahead. She can hear you. She's a part of me. That's all she is. She's just a part.",
        "Ford: No, she's more than that. She'll be back.",
        "Jessica: Why? Because she loves you so much?",
        "Ford: Yes, we love each other.",
        "Jessica: Well, if that's true, then where is she? Why hasn't she pushed me aside so she can be with you? I'll tell you why. Because Tess doesn't know the meaning of love. All she knows is sex, pain, and revenge. And obviously, she's had her fill of it. And I'm back to reclaim my life, and you're not a part of it. This is a one-time offer. Get out, never show your face again, and I won't press charges against you.",
        "Ford: For what?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. My uncle Bo and Aunt Nora will think of something.",
        "Ford: I'm not going anywhere without my son.",
        "Jessica: You don't have a son.",
        "Ford: Ryder's my son.",
        "Jessica: You had sex with me when I couldn't consent. I was sick, and you used it as a chance to get laid.",
        "Ford: Listen. I'm not that kind of guy anymore.",
        "Jessica: Then when I got sick again you did everything you could to keep me that way, so you could have access to my baby.",
        "Ford: Our baby.",
        "Jessica: The second you played house with my alter, you gave up all your rights to him. I will never let you be a father to my baby.",
        "Ford: You can't do this.",
        "Jessica: Watch me. Tess is gone, and so are you. Get out.",
        "Ford: You might be able to lock Tess away and pretend that she doesn't love me, but like it or not, we have a connection. We have a kid, and you have no choice but to deal with me.",

        "Clint: Natalie, bring me the phone.",
        "Natalie: Who you want to call?",
        "Clint: The police.",
        "Natalie: Why?",
        "Clint: Have Rex arrested before he makes another attempt on my life.",
        "Natalie: No! Dad, you can't!",
        "Clint: Honey, if you hadn't come in when you did, Rex would have killed me.",
        "Natalie: Rex isn't capable of murdering anyone, not even you.",
        "Clint: People will do anything, given the right circumstances.",
        "Natalie: Maybe you, but not Rex.",
        "Clint: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Natalie: That means, Dad, I'm not gonna let you manipulate Rex, not while he's this vulnerable.",
        "Clint: How am I doing that?",
        "Natalie: You just want Rex in jail, so you can make sure that he can't stop the doctors from giving you Gigi's heart.",
        "Clint: You don't want me to live?",
        "Natalie: Of course, I do.",
        "Clint: Rex can't stop the transplant. He can only delay it, and I can't afford any delays.",

        "Rex: I'm sorry I worried you.",
        "Viki: No, it's ok.",
        "Rex: I shouldn't have left Gigi's side.",
        "Viki: Oh, she wasn't alone, and you're here now, so...",
        "Rex: Doesn't even look like her. She used to be so larger than life. Now she looks...so small. We were so close to having everything we ever wanted-- marriage, real family, the kind I never had. Now it's all over. How did this happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: We appreciate your offer, but we'll decline to parlay until you can present us with some--hell, any--flimsy evidence of wrongdoing. Until that time, the police and my client will have no further communication.",
        "John: Oh, ok.",
        "Cop: Mr. Manning's discharge papers.",
        "John: Excellent.",
        "Todd: Oh, good. This is good-bye.",
        "John: Yeah, oh, I need to find that damn handcuff key.",
        "Todd: Please, John, give it a rest.",

        "Starr: You made this music yourself?",
        "Baz: Yep. Does that make you want t to revise your review up or down?",
        "Starr: My opinion of your music stays the same. My opinion of the musician goes up a little.",
        "Baz: Well, I'll take what I can get.",
        "Starr: Where did you learn to lay tracks like that anyway?",
        "Baz: I'm self-taught mostly. I'm a D.J., among other things.",
        "Starr: Do you play local gigs around here?",
        "Baz: Not yet. I'm new around here. I'm not even sure that there's a market for my talents.",
        "Starr: In our sad, unenlightened little town?",
        "Baz: Of course, if I had a few local fans, I might be convinced to give this scene a try.",
        "Starr: Local fans?",
        "Baz: Yeah. What do you say? You wanna be a groupie?",

        "Blair: I just found out about your secret wife. I can barely even think straight, much less make a decision about our future.",
        "Yvette: Do American women really have such little self-respect? He lied to you, and not for the first time, from what I gather.",
        "Blair: It was a mistake for me to come here. I certainly don't want to get caught in the middle of your crossfire.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You're not caught in the middle of anything. There's nothing between me and Yvette.",
        "Blair: Except a marriage that she doesn't want out of.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That's not true. I came to New York because she told me she was finally ready to sign the divorce papers.",
        "Blair: Is that why you were fighting before?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Because I came all the way here, and then she threatened to renege. Yvette, it's over. Please let me be. I can never love you again, not after what you did to destroy our marriage.",
        "Blair: What did she do?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: She cheated on me and had another man's baby.",
        "Blair: Well...an affair--that's brutal, but to find out that your wife had another man's child, it's--",
        "Yvette: Please don't get Tom\u00e1s started with that. He'll never stop.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: If you don't want to hear me complain, then just sign the damn papers. You won't ever have to see me again!",
        "Yvette: Don't curse at me!",
        "Blair: Ok, why won't you sign?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Because she's a sadist. She enjoys torturing me.",
        "Yvette: The torture is just beginning. I give you the divorce on one condition.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No conditions. I gave you the house. I gave you the money.",

        "Starr: A groupie? I don't even know what to say to that.",
        "Baz: Look, I didn't mean it like that. I just mean you'd be my first fan. I bet t l the cool kids would fall in line after you.",
        "Starr: As appealing as that sounds, I actually have a life, and it's pretty overloaded right now, ok? I don't have time to print out T-shirts and follow you in a van.",
        "Baz: Oh, you don't?",
        "Starr: No. Unlike most college students, I actually study. But if someone asks me about your music, I'll tell them--",
        "Baz: You've heard worse.",
        "Starr: Much worse, actually. And I can point you in the direction of a few clubs worth D.J.-ing.",
        "Baz: Yeah? Got any connects?",
        "Starr: Actually, my mom owns Capricorn, but the clientele... it's not really your target audience. Oh, what would be perfect for you is Ultraviolet. Everyone from L.U. goes there.",
        "Baz: Ultraviolet?",
        "Starr: Yeah. It's like the light. I know who the owner is. His name is Rex Balsom.",

        "T\u00e9a: Depends on what it says. Hopefully it will be inconclusive.",
        "Jack: Well, what if it isn't?",
        "Todd: It's a good thing you got your old man to bail you.",
        "Jack: But what if Shane's mom gets better? It's possible, isn't it?",
        "T\u00e9a: The likelihood of that is slim.",
        "Jack: But if she did, there'd be no murder charge, and everything would be ok, right? It could happen. Look at Matthew Buchanan.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not likely, but yes, Jack, miracles do happen. And let's hope for everyone's sake that Gigi gets one.",

        "Clint: All I'm trying to do is make it to another day.",
        "Natalie: I know, Dad, I know, but there's gotta be another way. Antagonizing your son when the woman he loves, the woman he was gonna spend the rest of his life with suddenly is a shell, that's cruel, ok, even for you.",
        "Clint: You weren't here when he first came in. The first thing Rex said was forget it. He would never give up Gigi's heart.",
        "Natalie: Of course, Dad. What did you expect him to say? The woman he loves is lying in that bed!",
        "Clint: And I'm lying in this one. I had to find out my legal rights. Otherwise, you'd be mourning not just Gigi. You'd be mourning me as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: He said that because Gigi and I were not married that I don't have a say, that he's gonna get Gigi's heart whether I like it or not. You should have heard him, Viki. He was practically gloating.",
        "Viki: Oh, God, I'm so sorry.",
        "Rex: Well, it doesn't matter, because I'm gonna fight him. I'm gonna fight him with everything I have. Gigi does not deserve this.",
        "Viki: Clint has treated you so despicably. I can't even imagine what you're going through. And I would never presume to give you advice, but let me just say that if you need to talk to someone or lean on someone, I'm here for you, ok? No questions asked.",

        "Ford: I love my son. I did what I had to do for Ryder.",
        "Jessica: So that makes it all right? You and Tess pulled every trick in the book to hold me back, but all you did was delay the inevitable. Tess gave me time and space to regroup. And I would apologize for getting you caught up in this game, but you were a willing participant. Tess is just a symptom. That didn't stop you from exploiting me.",
        "Ford: I exploited you? I exploited you? You're the one that lets Tess out to do your dirty work when things got too tough for you to handle. While you were having your time and space, Tess and I made a life. We started building a life with Ryder. You can't just show up out of nowhere and pretend that that doesn't exist.",
        "Jessica: Really? Watch me.",
        "Ford: What are you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm calling the police. You are trespassing. The next time you see Ryder, it'll be from behind bars.",

        "Jack: Did you hear what McBain said?",
        "Todd: Yes. Don't worry about it. He's just trying to scare you into talking, but I want you to shut up. Let me handle everything. Actually, I won't need to lift a finger, right? You're gonna take care of everything.",

        "Yvette: That's what I wanted you to believe.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What are you talking about?",

        "Starr: Would you mind putting a track or two of yours on there, just in case my horizon needs expanding?",
        "Baz: It's funny you should ask, 'cause I took the liberty of doing just that. And I hope you don't mind. I copied one of your play lists to my computer as well, you know, in exchange.",
        "Starr: Oh, really. You wanted my Muzak? Don't worry. It'll be our little secret.",

        "Clint: Rex tried to kill me. And contrary to what he wants all of you to believe, I don't want anybody to die. I feel terrible about that young woman. I feel terrible for Shane, but Gigi is brain dead. She's gone. But her loss doesn't have to be in vain. With her help, I can live. I can be with my family a little longer. And that's what's gonna happen. And Rex has to accept it. He's got no other choice.",
