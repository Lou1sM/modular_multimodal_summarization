        "Cristian: You ready?",
        "Blair: What's wrong?",
        "Cristian: Nothing, I just came from court.",
        "Blair: Well, come on in. How did the arraignment go?",
        "Cristian: Well, Kirk Harmon pleaded no contest to every one of the charges.",
        "Blair: Well, \"no contest\" -- that's -- I mean, that's good. It's like saying that he did it what it's saying right?",
        "Cristian: Oh, he's going to prison. It's over.",
        "Blair: Well, that's good.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, that's good. So you ready to go?",
        "Blair: You didn't get my message, did you?",
        "Cristian: What message?",
        "Blair: I'm not going to sing at the club tonight.",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Blair: I got somebody to fill in for me, though.",
        "Cristian: What, you sick or something?",
        "Blair: No, I just don't feel like singing happy love songs. Not when I've lost my daughter because she's in love with the wrong boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: That bitch!",
        "Cole: So, I'm guessing things didn't get much better after my mom and I left, huh?",
        "Starr: No. It was the worst. My mom is so stubborn. Cole, she's just never going to change her mind about you and me.",
        "Cole: Well, what are you going to do?",
        "Starr: You know what I want to do. I want to just push the whole world aside so that it could just be you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Miles.",
        "Miles: Hi.",
        "Marty: Are you following me?",
        "Miles: No, I was just going to see Jessica, like you. But they just told me at the nurses' station she's been released.",
        "Marty: She has?",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Marty: That's great.",
        "Miles: So I was headed home, but then I -- I saw my beautiful wife.",
        "Marty: Lucky me.",
        "Miles: Do you think it might have been telepathy? The two of us wanting to be at the same place at the same time?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Miles: Oh, come on, Marty. Maybe it was a sign we're meant to be together.",
        "Marty: No, nothing about us is meant to be.",
        "Miles: I don't know.",
        "Marty: Miles, you need to stop fooling yourself, ok? You forced me into this marriage, and I will hate you forever for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I'm surprised to see you, detective. My report's not due until next week.",
        "John: I'm not exactly on police business -- not officially, anyway.",
        "Hannah: Well, what does that mean?",
        "John: I'd like to ask you a few questions about Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Hannah: Well, you know I can't talk to you about patients that I see in private practice.",
        "John: Completely off the record.",
        "Hannah: You know as well as I do that unless I have information that a crime is going to be committed --",
        "John: Ok, let's make it official. Dr Saybrooke gave you information regarding the murder of Spencer Truman. I need that information.",
        "Hannah: I don't respond well to strong-arm tactics.",
        "John: That's not what this is. But we are talking about a killer who's still at large.",
        "Hannah: Well, if I knew there was a threat to the community, I would tell you about it. But I don't.",
        "John: Ok. What's the tape recorder for?",
        "Hannah: I use it to record all my sessions. I can review them later.",
        "John: Did you tape Dr. Saybrooke?",
        "Hannah: Yes.",
        "John: You know, your compelled to turn over that tape.",
        "Hannah: Not without a court order.",
        "John: You know I can get so what do you say we skip the dance and you give it to me now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: No, you act as if your life would be a never-ending pleasure if you just weren't married to me, but you know what? You'd have two choices. You'd either turn yourself in, or you'd wait around until the cops figured out it was you who murdered Spencer.",
        "Marty: Would you keep your voice down?",
        "Miles: You killed a man. But because I stole the tape from your shrink's office, nobody's ever going to know. Instead, you could spend the rest of your life helping me spend the inheritance from Spencer.",
        "Marty: You know, it -- it just occurred to me. Is -- is this some sick way for you to get revenge on me for what I did to him?",
        "Miles: Huh. No. I was loyal to Spencer. But if I found out that anyone else in this world would have murdered him, I would have gone to the cops. But not you. I love you.",
        "Marty: How can you love someone who despises you?",
        "Miles: I don't know. I don't know, I just do. I love you. And I want to prove it to you.",
        "Marty: All you're proving is that you are delusional, Miles. You keep -- you know, you think you love me, and you keep telling yourself and me that this could work out. But I know I don't love you, and I never will.",
        "Miles: You want out? All you have to do is go to the police station and tell them what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know Marty Saybrooke, right?",
        "Cristian: I know who she is.",
        "Blair: Here you go.",
        "Cristian: Thanks.",
        "Blair: Well, for obvious reasons, we don't get along, and that is putting it mildly.",
        "Cristian: I got that.",
        "Blair: But the one thing we do agree on -- one thing -- is that we both think it would be a nightmare if our kids got seriously together.",
        "Cristian: And Starr's boyfriend is Marty's son, right?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Now Marty's married Miles, done a 180. I mean, she actually came over here this morning saying, \"You know, Blair, I want to give Cole and Starr my blessing.\"",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but Starr ran into Cole at the movies with another girl, right?",
        "Blair: Yeah, and I thought, \"Well, you know, thank God. Maybe he's moved on\" -- not.",
        "Cristian: Well, maybe if you guys back off -- I don't know -- Starr and Cole will get a chance to get sick of one another.",
        "Blair: Cristian, I can't risk that.",
        "Cristian: Why not?",
        "Blair: Well, because Starr --",
        "Cristian: You just said you were afraid you lost your daughter.",
        "Blair: No, because Starr is too stubborn to see that there's no hope. There's no hope if Starr's father raped Cole's mother.",
        "Cristian: Huh. All right, so this has nothing to do with Starr and Cole and everything to do with Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Look, I have to go out for a while. Don't do anything stupid.",
        "Girl: What if he wakes up?",
        "Man: Give him another shot.",
        "Girl: He's had so many.",
        "Man: Look, just keep your head clear. Don't worry about him.",
        "Girl: I just don't want any more trouble than we already have.",
        "Man: Just keep him quiet.",
        "Todd: Blair --",
        "Girl: Right, Blair. Do you have her number?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Do you know what? Today your mommy is going to give you lunch. And she is going to give you your bath later on, and then I'm going to put you down for your nap.",
        "Nash: I think Mommy can watch Daddy do all that while she eats her turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread with her apple juice.",
        "Jessica: Apple juice?",
        "Nash: Yes, it's good for you. Eat it. Come to Daddy. Hey. Go on, inside. Look at all your toys.",
        "Jessica: You're spoiling me.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, there was a time I didn't think I was going to get a chance to spoil you, or sit here with you and watch our kid play.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, we've been through a lot, huh?",
        "Nash: Not nearly enough.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. I can't believe that you did all that for me.",
        "Nash: Nah, it was all Antonio.",
        "Jessica: No. You were the one that went to go get him, to bring him back so he could be a donor, and you saved his life after the bomb went off.",
        "Nash: Ah, shucks. Apple juice, here.",
        "Jessica: Stop it. Stop joking. I'll always love you.",
        "Nash: Well, that works out pretty well, because I plan on spending the rest of my life loving you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My dad is gone now. We could just take off.",
        "Cole: Starr, you know that wouldn't work.",
        "Starr: I know, but it sounds really good right now.",
        "Cole: My mom changed her mind. Maybe yours will, too.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me, Cole? You don't know my mom the way I do. When she was shacking up with Spencer Truman, I kept telling her what an awful man he was. But she didn't want to hear one mean thing about him. Then when she talks about you, she acts like she has all the answers.",
        "Cole: You know, you're really pretty when you're mad.",
        "Starr: The school play is tonight, and school's almost over. We won't get any chance to see each other today.",
        "Markko: This is the weirdest playlist I've ever seen.",
        "Langston: Give it back.",
        "Markko: No. What -- what's \"Anyone Can Whistle\"?",
        "Langston: It's a musical, you moron.",
        "Markko: You don't seriously listen to this stuff?",
        "Langston: Beats listening to you. Hey. You two up for opening night?",
        "Starr: Sure.",
        "Langston: What now?",
        "Cole: My mom changed her mind about us.",
        "Langston: And the problem is --",
        "Starr: My mom's talking bars on the windows and a chastity belt.",
        "Britney: Trouble for the king and queen of the prom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Huh. You really just -- you don't even care what you say to me anymore, do you?",
        "Marty: No, no. I used to -- before you blackmailed me into marrying you.",
        "Miles: You know what? I'm beginning to think that maybe I did the wrong thing.",
        "Marty: Huh. No kidding.",
        "Miles: You know, I -- I kept thinking that eventually you'd see past what I did and you'd appreciate why I did it, but I guess I'm just na\u00efve.",
        "Marty: Miles, I used to like you, I did. But I look at you now, and I don't see that guy I used to know.",
        "Miles: I just wanted to be with you.",
        "Marty: Whether I wanted it or not.",
        "Miles: But if I could prove to you that I am the same man that I was when you met me, would that -- would that make a difference to you?",
        "Boy: Miles?",
        "Miles: Jeff. What are you doing, man? How are you doing? Where's your mom?",
        "Jeff: She's talking to my doctor. I just got admitted.",
        "Miles: All right. So when's the surgery?",
        "Jeff: Tomorrow.",
        "Miles: Yeah? Hey, I know it's a drag. Hang in there.",
        "Jeff: Maybe someday, I'll look like you.",
        "Miles: Huh. You know what? You got a good soul, man. That's more important than anything, truthfully. All right? So how are those Red Sox doing?",
        "Jeff: They're going all the way this year, I don't care what anybody says.",
        "[Miles chuckles]",
        "Miles: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: If you're waiting for me to fold, you're going to wait a long time. This is America. People have rights.",
        "John: Oh, good god -- I was hoping to do this the easy way, but I guess that's not going to o happen.",
        "Hannah: Well, and you're going to have to leave soon because I have a session coming in, in a few minutes.",
        "John: I'll be back.",
        "Hannah: I thought you said this wasn't a police matter.",
        "John: No, I said \"not yet.\"",
        "Hannah: Then why are you so adamant about getting this tape?",
        "John: Well, it's the difference between my job and yours, Doc. I have to know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know what kind of man Todd was before I met him. And I know why he became that man. I also know that he's done everything he can to put that man behind him. But he loves these two kids. He tells me all the time that these two guys are the best things that he ever did with his life. And I know when he doubts himself, he always looks at them. You don't doubt that Cole's a good boy, but my problem is that if Starr starts dating him, maybe she's going to start looking -- looking at her father through Marty's eyes. And that would absolutely kill Todd. And it wouldn't be good for Starr, either, no matter what she thinks she's feeling right now, you know?",
        "Cristian: All right. Well, you don't even know where Todd is, right?",
        "Blair: Well, I'm not giving up that he's not going to come back.",
        "Cristian: Come back to you?",
        "Blair: To our family.",
        "Cristian: I mean, are you --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Cristian: Never mind.",
        "Blair: What? No, say what you were going to say.",
        "Cristian: What do I know? I don't have kids.",
        "Blair: No, well, just tell me. What?",
        "Cristian: Well, I mean, you're going crazy worrying about Todd. Are you sure this is the right time to back Starr into a corner?",
        "Blair: I don't know. It's -- well, I mean, when -- when Marty was here earlier, I thought, well, you know, it would be easy just to cave in, and, you know, maybe set some ground rules and see what happens, but --",
        "Cristian: Well, why didn't you?",
        "Blair: Because I couldn't.",
        "Cristian: How come?",
        "Blair: Well, it's not that complicated. Well, it's not. Look, I -- a part of me is always going to love Todd, and -- he's forgiven me a lot of things, but I'm telling you right now, he would never forgive me if I allowed his daughter to -- to date Marty's son.",
        "Cristian: So that's what you're afraid of? Losing Todd?",
        "Blair: I'm afraid that if I allow it, it will be like me admitting that -- that Todd's gone.",
        "Cristian: Letting Starr date Cole is the same as saying that Todd's never coming back?",
        "Blair: I love him and I -- I hate him, and I don't know how to let go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: So, Blair, if I tell you he's here, what will you do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Britney, I'm sorry the way things turned out at prom. I really am. But don't start something, all right?",
        "Britney: Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help it. I guess I'm just hardwired to be a bitch.",
        "Langston: You're just realizing that now?",
        "Starr: Langston --",
        "Britney: You know, I did a lot of thinking last night.",
        "Langston: Oh. Do you want some aspirin?",
        "Starr: Langston, knock it off.",
        "Langston: Sorry. But do please share.",
        "Britney: On second thought, I'd rather not.",
        "Starr: Look, if you want to go talk to her, I understand, ok?",
        "Cole: No, I'm staying here.",
        "Markko: It looks like Nice Britney passed her expiration date, huh?",
        "Langston: Uh-huh.",
        "Cole: Yeah, he's right. Just forget about Britney.",
        "Langston: If Cole's mom's on board, then what's the problem?",
        "Starr: My mom will never change her mind about it.",
        "Markko: Well, I don't get this. Why do your parents care so much?",
        "Langston: Come with me.",
        "Markko: What? What'd I say?",
        "Langston: Come on, come on.",
        "Starr: Cole, what are we going to do about this?",
        "Cole: Well, we don't have to do what your mom says anymore. That's all I care about.",
        "Starr: You know, that whole time I was saying that I didn't want to be with you -- I never felt so alone in my life.",
        "Cole: Hey, we can take anything, as long as we're together. Right?",
        "Starr: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeff: That's going to be my room.",
        "Miles: This one right here? That's where my niece Jessica was. She just went home today. Hey, you know what? When you're done with your surgery, I'm going to come back and we're going to hang out, all right? But this time, I am going to kick your butt in some Gin Rummy.",
        "Jeff: Better watch out. The nurse says the lady who had the room before me, your niece --",
        "Miles: Mm-hmm?",
        "Jeff: She's doing real good now.",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Jeff: My mom says that means I'm going to get lucky, too.",
        "Miles: Good. I like your attitude.",
        "Jeff: I think I got lucky when I met you.",
        "Miles: Oh, come on.",
        "Jeff: You're the one who got that special doctor to come all the way from France.",
        "Miles: You know what? It wasn't that difficult. He was tired of those croissants, anyway.",
        "Jeff: My mom cried when she found out.",
        "Nurse: There you are.",
        "Jeff: I was talking to Miles. He's my friend.",
        "Nurse: You need to go down for your pre-op test.",
        "Miles: Go on now. But I'm going to come back afterwards. But this time, we're going to play with my deck, all right?",
        "Jeff: Maybe I'll have a whole new face. Won't that be cool?",
        "Miles: Yep.",
        "Jeff: Are you Miles' friend, too?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "Miles: See you later, alligator.",
        "Jeff: After a while, crocodile.",
        "Miles: All right, buddy.",
        "[Miles sighs]",
        "Marty: So how do you know Jeff?",
        "Miles: Oh, a little while ago, I talked to the hospital. I asked them to put me in touch with people like that.",
        "Marty: Hmm. And he just happened to show up at just the right time?",
        "Miles: What are you saying?",
        "Marty: It just seems a little convenient.",
        "Miles: You think I would use a kid like Jeff to score some points with you? You really think I'm scum, don't you?",
        "Marty: I don't want to think that, Miles, ok? I -- I see you with Jeff and I get a glimpse of that guy I thought I knew. I wish he was here now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Let me get this straight. You want me to order Dr. Young to turn over her personal notes and a tape of the session with Dr. Marty Saybrooke?",
        "John: Well, Dr. Saybrooke wasn't a patient.",
        "Woman: What do you mean?",
        "John: Well, she wasn't seeing Dr. Young in any sort of regular basis. She's a therapist, as well. Her whole conversation could be categorized as a consultation, therefore not protected by doctor/patient privilege.",
        "Woman: Nice try.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Woman: But Dr. Saybrooke still had the expectation of privacy. Are you sure that Dr. Young is protecting Spencer Truman's murderer?",
        "John: I believe she has information that will clear David Vickers. I don't want to see an innocent man convicted of murder.",

        "Nash: All right, well, now that you've done your lunch, you are ready for your surprise.",
        "Jessica: You got me something? You didn't have to do that.",
        "Nash: It's not really something I got you. It's more something your daughter and I have been working on. Come on -- whoa! Ready? Ok. Here we go. Ready?",
        "[Jessica gasps]",
        "Nash: Do your thing. Go, go, go.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God -- she's walking! Come here! Oh! Hello!",
        "Nash: Oh, she's been, you know, kind of walking along the furniture for a while, but --",
        "Jessica: I know, but every time she did that, she just kind of let go and then her butt hit the ground.",
        "Nash: I think she was practicing when she was with your mom.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Nash: The other night, she -- she was standing in her crib and she just let go of the rail and she just stood there. She -- man, she looked as shocked as I did, and then she started taking steps -- oh.",
        "Jessica: Oh! Oh, no, no, no! Ok, ok, ok. Go get down. Go, go, go.",
        "Nash: Want to go back to your toys? Huh? Whoa! Grr!",

        "Nash: Oh!",
        "Jessica: She knows just what she wants, huh?",
        "Nash: Listen, and independent. As soon as she realized she could walk, she went straight to the door.",
        "Jessica: We are going to have to watch her like a hawk.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Thought you'd be upset you missed it.",
        "Jessica: Are you kidding me? I was getting ready to say goodbye. I thought I was going to miss every milestone. I -- I know how lucky I am. You know, everything that we went through -- it was worth it for us to be here together like this.",
        "Nash: Like a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Weren't you ever nuts about some dude in high school?",
        "Blair: Sure. His name was Kent Weeks, and he was this guitar player in a band and he did a mean rendition of \"Shout.\"",
        "Cristian: Right. Well, what would you have done if your folks told you you couldn't see him?",
        "Blair: I didn't have folks. I didn't know my father, and my mother was in a mental institution.",
        "Cristian: Oh. Sorry.",
        "Blair: The only discipline I ever saw or guidance was the back of my foster parent's hand. Starr doesn't know how lucky she's got it.",
        "Cristian: Well, it seems to me you're fighting Todd's battle for him.",
        "Blair: What does that mean?",
        "Cristian: Well, any chance Todd might feel different about this whole situation?",
        "Blair: Why would he change his mind?",
        "Cristian: Well, I don't know -- maybe if he saw how the kids still feel about each other. Isn't that what happened to Cole's mom?",
        "Blair: Look, you don't know Todd.",
        "Cristian: You're right -- I don't know him, but he loves his kid and I'm sure he wants his kid to be happy.",
        "Blair: Of course he wants his kid to be happy. He the world, anything she wanted except this.",
        "Cristian: Look, Blair, like I said before, he's not here. You're alone, raising two kids all by your damn self whether you like it or not. Now, if you don't think it's the end of the world for -- for Starr to see Cole, then don't you think you get to make that call? I mean, do you think you're really selling Todd out or --",
        "Blair: Or -- or what? Say it.",
        "Cristian: Uh -- well, I was going to say if you think you're disrespecting his memory, but I figured you wouldn't like the sound of that.",
        "Blair: I don't. But I see your point. Cristian, I'm living my life as if Todd is going to walk through that door at any moment, and it just keeps not happening. And I guess not allowing Starr to see Cole -- now it just doesn't make any sense. And you know how I hate agreeing with Marty Saybrooke about anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I am the man I've always been. I grew up in a hospital, all right? I was a complete outcast until Spencer operated on me and that gave me a chance to be in this world. All I wanted was to be like everyone else. Then I met you and then all I wanted was to spend the rest of my life with you. I'm sorry that you don't like the way I went about it.",
        "Marty: How could I possibly like what you did? I told you how I felt about Patrick. I told you there could never be anyone else for me, and the minute you got something on it, you -- you just ignored everything I said to you.",
        "Miles: Oh. Look, I believe in taking risks in order to be happy.",
        "Miles: I took the risk that I may never be able to make you love me.",
        "Marty: Well, you better get ready to live with that because I never will.",
        "Miles: You won't even try.",
        "Marty: You threatened me, you threatened my son, you threatened McBain. I don't know how to make this any clearer. There is no hope.",
        "Miles: You know, I'm just going to -- I'm going to go find Jeff's mother. I have to be around somebody that doesn't think I'm some kind of monster.",

        "Jessica: Wow. That was quick.",
        "Nash: I think all that walking must've worn her out because one verse of \"Old McDonald\" and she was out like a light.",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
        "Nash: Can I get you anything? More juice?",
        "Jessica: No, I -- I have my -- our beautiful daughter. The three of us are together. What more could I want?",
        "Nash: Well, I told you everything would work out.",
        "Jessica: I almost feel guilty now. I can't stop thinking about Antonio and Jamie.",
        "Nash: It wasn't right for Antonio to be living a lie --",
        "Jessica: I know.",
        "Nash: Because that's what your marriage now it. Antonio deserves to be happy, just like we are.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, he doesn't know where his happiness is going to come from.",
        "Nash: He's putting the pieces of his life back together now and I know that --",
        "[Bree cries]",
        "Jessica: I guess she wasn't as down as we thought.",
        "Nash: No, you rest. I'll get her.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, no. Please. I really want to do this. I've waited weeks to do it.",
        "[Crying]",

        "Cristian: I'm just talking.",
        "Blair: No. You cut to the chase, and I need that. I haven't had that in a long time.",
        "Cristian: What are friends for?",
        "Blair: Who would've thought that we'd have this great friendship, now, you know, given how we kind of started our relationship?",
        "Cristian: No, maybe that's why we could talk, you know? We don't have the whole sex thing hovering over our heads.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Oh, God -- who am I to lecture my daughter about anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, listen, your mother could still come around. I never thought mine would and she did.",
        "Starr: Cole, you got to your mom because she married Miles Laurence.",
        "Cole: True.",
        "Starr: My mom just sits at home and waits for my dad to get back. When they're in the same town, they can't stand each other. And now my mom's all \"What would Todd want?\"",
        "Cole: It doesn't matter what he wants. I'm not going anywhere.",

        "Markko: Whoa -- Starr's old man raped Cole's mom?",
        "Langston: Say it a little louder -- I don't think they heard you in Altoona.",
        "Markko: Well, that's unbelievable. Look, if some dude raped my mom, I could never hook up with his daughter.",
        "Langston: They didn't know that when they met. They're not just hooking up -- they love each other.",
        "Markko: Yeah, they must if they can get around all that.",
        "Langston: Weird, huh? They have this major problem and they still want to be together.",
        "Markko: Yeah -- people with nothing in their way still treat each other like crap.",

        "Langston: Just leave them alone.",
