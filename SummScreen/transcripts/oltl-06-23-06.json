        "Rex is about to lose consciousness. Adriana is shouting for the masked man to leave Rex alone but he will not stop. Adriana then finds the courage to go over behind the man and pull him off Rex, relieving the pressure so that Rex can be freed. The man gets up and runs off. Adriana pulls Rex from the pool and holds him in her arms while he tries to get a breath. Spencer arranges for David to come to his room to talk. He gives Blair pills and tells her that she will get a good night's sleep. She spits the pills out and pretends to be sleeping later when David shows up for his little visit. Spencer tries to convince David not to plead guilty but David will do it. He wants to face what he has done and he will admit to the shooting. Spencer says that he has been covering for his brother for twenty years and that there isn't any reason for him to be giving himself up this way. David tells him not to worry as he will be confessing but not about anything that Spencer has done in the past. Spencer gives all the reasons why he feels that David should trust him and do as he says to be free. David can't help it. He doesn't trust Spencer. Spencer is sure that if David pleads guilty, they will both end up in jail for twenty- five years, but if David does as his brother tells, Spencer can see David going free for the crime of shooting John's father. David gives in. He will do as Spencer tells him and plead 'not guilty'. Spencer is pleased. He says that he did what he did because he cares for his brother and he still does. David isn't sure about that. He leaves the apartment now. Blair has been listening the whole time. She hears that the meeting is over and she runs to the bed and fakes sleeping. Spencer lets David out and joins Blair in bed."

        "Rex: Agh --",
        "Adriana: No -- leave him alone! Please stop it! Stop, please! Please!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: This is getting to be a habit.",
        "Cristian: Yeah -- one I don't want to break.",
        "Evangeline: Cris, I've never had good timing when it comes to relationships. It always seems like it's -- it's the wrong guy at the right time, or the other way around, you know?",
        "Cristian: So which one am I?",
        "Evangeline: Definitely the right guy.",
        "Cristian: Ok, then stop talking.",
        "Evangeline: If I stop talking, we're going to kiss again, and if we kiss again, we'll--",
        "Cristian: We're going to make love?",
        "Evangeline: That was direct.",
        "Cristian: Well, if you ask me, I think we need to be a hell of a lot more direct a lot more often.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: John, stop! You can't do this!",
        "Vincent: Hey. Yeah, this is all on you, lieutenant. See, the thing is you came after me first. You know, I should press charges on my employee's behalf. But, you know, I'm not going to do that because I'm a nice guy, and I'm not really looking for any trouble.",
        "Natalie: All right, come on, come on, come on. Let's get out of here. Don't take the bait, come on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: So that's it, Spencer. I'm changing my plea to guilty.",
        "Spencer: Just tell me you haven't made up your mind about this. This is not your final decision. I mean, you are going to actually put some very serious thought into this, aren't you? All right, there's Blair. Don't say a word, all right?",
        "David: You want me to keep my mouth shut.",
        "Blair: So, what did I miss, guys?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What the hell did I just do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Come in. Hey, Hugh. Could you close the door, please?",
        "Hugh: Sure.",
        "Bo: You know why I called you down here.",
        "Hugh: Doesn't have to come to this, Bo. We're still investigating --",
        "Bo: No, Hugh, I don't have a choice, all right? But I want to thank you for standing by me. I know that the mayor's all over you right now about me still being in the job while all these accusations are flying around. Anyway -- my -- my gun, and my badge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You look shocked.",
        "Evangeline: Do you blame me? You kind of caught me off-guard a little bit there.",
        "Cristian: Well, does it make you feel uncomfortable, you know, talking about sex?",
        "Evangeline: No. No. But where did that come from all of a sudden?",
        "Cristian: Well, I don't think it was sudden at all. I've actually been thinking about it for a while. Haven't you?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. I mean, sometimes. But, Cris --",
        "Cristian: But you're all stressed out with, you know, trying to adjust to what's happened to you, thinking you're not a good lawyer and all -- which is bull, by the way. But my point is I just think -- I mean, I know things have been tough for you, but maybe we should stop worrying about what we can't control and maybe start focusing on what we can.",
        "Evangeline: Wait, wait, wait. So what you're saying is that if we make love, the whole blind, unemployable thing will just go away, you know, disappear from my overactive mind? You sure give yourself a lot of credit there, player. And you can stop smiling now.",
        "Cristian: How do you know I'm smiling?",
        "Evangeline: Because I just know.",
        "Cristian: I'm sorry, I can't help it.",
        "Evangeline: And what exactly do you find so amusing about me, senor Vega?",
        "Cristian: Bueno, Senorita Williamson. It's just that every time we talk about things, you kind of turn it into lawyer terms.",
        "Evangeline: I do not.",
        "Cristian: Yes, you do, all the time. You're very lawyerlike.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I wonder why. And if you don't like it, why are you so hot to sleep with me?",
        "Cristian: Oh. Well, that's because you're brilliant and beautiful and kind and very funny, that's why.",
        "Evangeline: Is this what you do -- all this talking, you know -- during --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hugh: We have to fight this, Bo, and I'll back you all the way.",
        "Bo: Hugh, I'm not going to let you ruin your career. I'm going to step down to an inactive status. That's by the book, that the only thing I can do.",
        "Hugh: There has to be another way.",
        "Bo: Not unless I can prove that I was set up. Hugh, I do appreciate your faith in me, and I know the pressure you're under right now, but you got to treat me like you would any other suspect.",
        "Hugh: I wish I knew how to stop this. I wish I knew how to prove that it all traces back to Spencer Truman.",
        "Bo: Hugh. You're not alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Well, it is getting late. I think we should take off. What do you say?",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Spencer: See you later, David.",
        "Blair: David, you know what? If I were you, I really wouldn't hang out anywhere near John McBain, because you don't need a public scene.",
        "David: Finally, some levelheaded advice. Thank you, Blair.",
        "Blair: You're welcome.",
        "Spencer: Wait 30 minutes, come to my room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Let's go somewhere we can talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: I tell you --",
        "Layla: W did you do that?",
        "Vincent: How did I do what?",
        "Layla: You managed to make it look like that altercation with John wasn't your fault at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Let him go! Rex! Hey! Rex, are you ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Look, just understand what you did, all right? This -- this guy, he's a known criminal in Atlantic City.",
        "Natalie: I know, I know, ok? I should've have kept it from you. Look, what happened at Capricorn -- it's all my fault, totally on me.",
        "John: No, I'm the e who lost it and popped the bodyguard. That's my responsibility. But getting mixed up with this Vince Jones -- that's on you.",
        "Natalie: So what happened? Why -- why did you go off on him?",
        "John: I don't know. You know, guys like that, they just represent everything that's wrong to me, you know? No one wants to make it honest anymore, you know. Everybody just wants to be a thug. You know, why work for it when you can steal it? It's no excuse. I carry a badge and I should know -- I should know better, you know? Hell, Bo right now -- he's fighting for his job and his reputation, and then I go and risk everything, all for nothing.",
        "Natalie: You know, I have a theory. I'll tell you, if you promise not to throw things around. Ok, my theory is you didn't go off on him because you hate him so much. You went off on him because of how much you like me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Ah. How out a toast? Hmm.",
        "Layla: What are we celebrating, almost getting in a fistfight with a cop?",
        "Vincent: We can celebrate whatever you like.",
        "Layla: What a gentleman. Has anyone ever told you that you're full of yourself?",
        "Vincent: Well, you have to forgive me for feeling a little vindicated. You know, this man attacked me and my employee. It's not my fault he did it in front of a room full of witnesses, you know? What's wrong? Is my good mood bothering you?",
        "Layla: No, not really. I've never been a big fan of John or Natalie.",
        "Vincent: Really? Why?",
        "Layla: John used to date my sister.",
        "Vincent: Evangeline?",
        "Layla: They were really hot and heavy until Natalie broke them up. Vange was devastated.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Wow! You can be really detail-oriented when you want to be.",
        "Cristian: Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't -- don't misunderstand. Just because I'm explicit doesn't mean that this is a casual thing. It's just that I want you.",
        "Evangeline: It's a lot of pressure.",
        "Cristian: No, no, no, no. No pressure at all. Just you and me -- the way I think we should be -- and I really want you.",
        "Evangeline: I love this. I love being wanted this much, Cris. I swear, I'm not trying to play any games with you. I really want you, too. But would it kill you -- I mean, would it make you crazy if we just -- if we just wait a little bit longer? I mean, after my last relationship, I think I just --",
        "Cristian: Whoa, whoa, no relationships. We're not going to talk about the past. That's done, finished, finito.",
        "Evangeline: I know.",
        "Cristian: Good.",
        "Evangeline: And I don't want to repeat the past, so I think we could just maybe take this a little bit slower, you know? Bask a while in the yearning, wait.",
        "Cristian: Well, it has been a while for me.",
        "Evangeline: Cris --",
        "Cristian: For you, I can wait a lifetime.",
        "Evangeline: Don't worry. I'm not going to make it nearly that long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hugh: Bo, you don't need to do this yet. Why don't -- why don't we wait another day or two?",
        "Bo: You know, I usually play by the rules. Anything else, it just doesn't seem right. And I don't make a move without thinking about this office and about that badge over there. And to have that questioned, even if it's based on a lie --",
        "Hugh: I'll do whatever I can to help you get your life back.",
        "Bo: Thank you, Hugh.",
        "Hugh: We just need to prove that Truman's fingerprints are all over this.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, Spencer, I don't know if this is such a good idea.",
        "Spencer: What? I thought you said the kids were at Dorian's.",
        "Blair: Well, they are, but I'm -- I'm exhausted.",
        "Spencer: Look, I'll tell you what -- you can rest here, all right? Just come on -- I'll tell you what. I'll give you a mild sedative, all right?",
        "Blair: You know, Spencer, that's really not necessary.",
        "Spencer: Listen, who's the doctor here, huh? You haven't been sleeping at all, you said.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I'm -- I kind of had insomnia lately.",
        "Spencer: Right. Taking a sedative one night, and your life is certainly not going to hurt you.",
        "Blair: Huh.",
        "Spencer: I promise. Here. This is guaranteed to help you sleep for a solid eight hours. Understand? When you wake up in the morning, you will feel so much better.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Spencer: Trust me.",
        "Blair: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Ok. So I guess if we're going to wait, we better sit out of arm's reach.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Cristian: Don't answer it.",
        "Evangeline: I have to, it's -- it's the police station.",
        "Cristian: How do you know that?",
        "Evangeline: Well, my coach made me give a distinctive ring to every important caller.",
        "Cristian: Right. So what rings when I call?",
        "Evangeline: Uh -- yeah, yeah, maybe I'll tell you someday, you know, if you're as good as you say you are.",
        "Cristian: Ooh, the pressure.",
        "Evangeline: Evangeline Williamson.",
        "Bo: Evangeline, it's Bo. I need to meet with you tonight. It's urgent.",
        "Evangeline: What's going on?",
        "Bo: Well, I'll explain when you get down here. Hughes arranged a car to pick you up.",
        "Evangeline: Hugh? Why?",
        "Bo: Well, it's kind of complicated to go into on the phone. So is that ok? I know it's really late, but can you come?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. Sure. You know, if it's important, of course.",
        "Bo: All right, where are you?",
        "Evangeline: 1534 Fairhaven Street.",
        "Bo: All right. Thank you very much. I -- I really do appreciate it.",
        "Evangeline: Are you all right, Bo?",
        "Bo: No, I'm not. I'll see you later, ok?",
        "Evangeline: I'll be there. I have to go. God, I'm so sorry.",
        "Cristian: Why? What -- what's going on?",
        "Evangeline: Bo sounded really upset, he wouldn't tell me why. They're -- they're sending a car here to pick me up. God, I don't want to go, Cristian. I haven't felt this good in a really, really long time.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, neither have I. Neither have I.",
        "Evangeline: I want to feel this way again soon.",
        "Cristian: You will. Come on, I'll take you downstairs.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What are you babbling about now?",
        "Natalie: I'm trying to get you to admit how you feel.",
        "John: Well, I'm -- I'm here with you, right?",
        "Natalie: You are the most bullheaded, annoying man on this planet. You know that, right?",
        "John: Yes, I do.",
        "Natalie: You know what else?",
        "John: Hmm?",
        "Natalie: Vincent was right.",
        "John: Oh, was he? Vincent was right?",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: What was he right about?",
        "Natalie: He said that you were protecting your woman. Let's face it, John, you were.",
        "John: I'm not going to do this.",
        "Natalie: Ok, ok. All right, I get it. I know. I never should've gotten involved with that guy. But, John, he is the reason I was able to help you find your father's killer. I'm sorry. Can I just take that back now?",
        "John: Just forget about it, all right? Look -- you know, your theory about why I lost it tonight -- you're not even close.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Then why?",
        "John: I thought I'd feel better.",
        "Natalie: \"Better\"?",
        "John: Most of my life I've tried to find my -- my father's murderer, and now we have a suspect. He's been arraigned and there's a -- there's a good bet we'll get a conviction. I don't feel any better, you know? I don't feel redemption. I still have this emptiness inside and I -- I don't know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Blair? You asleep? Don't you worry. I'm going to take care of everything for us. Come on in.",
        "David: Where's Blair? Did she finally wise up and go home?",
        "Spencer: She's asleep. Don't worry, we can talk freely. She won't be waking up.",
        "David: Why, did you kill her?",
        "Spencer: No -- but I am going to kill you if you don't change your mind about pleading guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Rex! I can't believe he attacked you like that.",
        "Rex: He's gone?",
        "Adriana: He ran off after I tried to choke him. Are you ok?",
        "Rex: I'm fine. I swallowed about a gallon of water, but other than that -- I'm going to go find him.",
        "Adriana: No! Please don't -- don't go, ok? He's probably long gone by now.",
        "Rex: We've got to check the property, make sure no one's hanging around, and then we're calling the cops!",
        "Adriana: No, please don't call them! Please don't call the cops, I'm begging you.",
        "Rex: Look, it is time to get the cops involved in this, ok? It has gotten way too big for us.",
        "Adriana: I thought you said Bo already knew.",
        "Rex: I told him a little. But this guy is raising the stakes. It could be a lot worse next time. I am not taking the chance.",
        "Adriana: What would my mom say if she found out about this --",
        "Rex: Hey, we can't handle it on our own anymore, it has gotten way too big.",
        "Adriana: I know. You're right.",
        "Rex: Right now, we need to worry about stopping this guy, ok, before things get any worse. I'll talk to Bo. I'll see if he can help us out without setting up a full-blown investigation, ok, or putting a cop on you.",
        "Adriana: Thank you.",
        "Rex: I am so sorry.",
        "Adriana: You're sorry? My God, Rex, you could've been killed!",
        "Rex: Come here.",
        "Adriana: Why is this happening?",
        "Rex: I don't know. But it's not going away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Evangeline, thanks for coming.",
        "Hugh: Here, here, come and sit.",
        "Evangeline: No, no, no, got it, I got it. Thanks. So, Bo, what's going on?",
        "Bo: I need a defense attorney, and I want the best I can get, so the only one I really want is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: John, I think I know why you feel this way. All those years you thought of your father's killer, and you've built him up in your mind as some sick monster. But instead, you find out it's someone you know. Someone who was very young, stupid, scared, who's been running from it ever since.",
        "John: I've been thinking a lot about it. Man, there's something about it that still doesn't add up, you know? It's just a little too neat, too simple.",
        "Natalie: What are you saying?",
        "John: We still don't have the whole story, that's -- what I'm saying is it's not over. I don't know why",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Spencer, the magnitude of your threats is diluted by the sheer volume that I receive. You should try a little good old-fashioned diplomacy.",
        "Spencer: You don't leave me much of a choice, David. If you cop a guilty plea with this thing, you're going to blow the lid off of everything that I've covered up for the last 25 years. Are you really willing to risk everything over a Crisis of conscience? It's a cold case, David, as cold as they come. And I don't care what McBain or the D.A. think they have against you. They don't have enough evidence to convict. So why don't you just have a little faith, and you will be a free man.",
        "David: That's probably what Todd Manning was thinking, too.",
        "Spencer: Just stick to the not-guilty plea, David. Let your high-priced attorney do the dirty work and you'll get out of this.",
        "David: Are you aware that McBain has a witness? That's how he arrested me in the first place.",
        "Spencer: Well, perhaps he had enough to arrest you, but certainly not enough to convict. Look, the witness only heard a gunshot. No one actually saw you pull the trigger.",
        "David: But I did. That's the thing, Spencer. I'm aware that I pulled that trigger. And ever since that night, I think that's why everything in my life has gone wrong, but no more. I'm not going to live with this secret any longer.",
        "Spencer: That's the wrong decision, David.",
        "David: Well, you can relax. When I finally confess, I'm not going to mention your name. I'm going to leave you out of it. So, get this...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ah. This isn't a blanket out of the trunk of a car, is it? Oh.",
        "Natalie: You want a beer?",
        "John: No, you know what? I think I'm -- I think I'm good right now. This is good.",
        "Natalie: Is there anything I can do?",
        "John: No, thanks.",
        "John: Did you see that?",
        "Natalie: It's a shooting star.",
        "John: Yeah. You know, I think you're supposed to make a wish when you see one of those.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Done.",
        "John: What'd you wish for?",
        "Natalie: I can't tell you that, or else it won't come true.",
        "John: No, I think that's -- I think that's when you're blowing out your birthday candles or something like that. Don't think there's any rules about shooting stars.",
        "Natalie: You sure?",
        "John: I'm positive, I think.",
        "Natalie: Fine. I wished that it could be like this -- happy and quiet -- forever.",
        "John: Yeah, sometimes quiet is good.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Sometimes. So how about you? Going to make a wish?",
        "John: Hmm. Well, I think it's a little late for me.",
        "Natalie: Oh, it's never too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hello?",
        "Vincent: Hey, it's your boss.",
        "Cristian: Hey, what's up, man?",
        "Vincent: What's up is good news. I got you a new fight.",
        "Cristian: Yeah?",
        "Vincent: Mm-hmm. Hey, I had three promoters call me tonight trying to put their boy versus mine.",
        "Cristian: Cool. I could always use the money.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. But the last two, I turned down.",
        "Cristian: What? Why?",
        "Vincent: Because for the first one was for a title fight.",
        "Cristian: You're serious?",
        "Vincent: Yeah, I'm serious. Lien, this is your big chance, so make the most of it.",
        "Cristian: You got me a fight with Rick Abbott?",
        "Vincent: Ho-ho-ho! Yeah, that's right, the one and only. Listen, the first thing in the morning, I need you to start training, and I mean hard. You hear me? Hard.",
        "Cristian: Wow. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, you -- listen, Vincent, thank you. I really appreciate this, man.",
        "Vincent: All right, man. See you at the gym.",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Vincent: Huh. Hey.",
        "Layla: Keep it up. It's good.",
        "Vincent: Keep what up?",
        "Layla: The way you're working so hard for Cris, promoting his career.",
        "Vincent: Hey, you know something? This guy got some loyal fans.",
        "Layla: Yes, I am a fan. I'm just worried about my sister. If she keeps losing clients, Cristian just might have to give her some financial help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: So in light of the circumstances, I decided to turn in my badge and my gun to Hugh.",
        "Evangeline: Well, that was a little premature, don't you think? And what's he still doing here?",
        "Bo: Well, no -- Evangeline, it was my idea to step down. Hugh's on my side. As a matter of fact, he thought it'd be a good idea if I delayed this for a few days.",
        "Hugh: I've got a call in to Judge Warner's office. I'm trying to get a court order to put a wiretap on Spencer's hotel room and office.",
        "Evangeline: What about that guy from Kentucky? The -- the morgue attendant? The one that said you picked up the bodies? I mean, obviously, he was paid off.",
        "Hugh: No, we did a background check. There were no suspicious deposits to any of his known bank accounts.",
        "Evangeline: I have a friend from law school who practices in Louisville. I'll give her a call and see what she can dig up.",
        "Bo: We, thank you.",
        "Evangeline: I just wish there was something more I could do.",
        "Bo: Well, there . You could take my case.",
        "Evangeline: I can't. Bo, I'm not the right attorney for you.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Hugh: It's Judge Warner's office. Hugh Hughes. All right. Thanks for getting back to me. The judge denied my request for a court order.",
        "Bo: I'm not surprised. You know, I never thought that figuring out what Spencer is really up to was going to be easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: David, look, I realize our relationship has suffered over the years because of this whole thing. I mean, look at the magnitude of the secret we had to keep between us. How it could it not? We were bound to feel the -- the strain of it all.",
        "David: The strain of it all? That's a bit of an understatement, wouldn't you say?",
        "Spencer: I wasn't referring to anything that has happened recently, David. I was talking about what did to protect you 25 years ago, something that's been buried up until now. Unfortunately, now we have to deal with it. I mean, you were just a kid. Man, do you realize if I hadn't done what I did 25 years ago, you would have had no life? You wouldn't even have had an opportunity at a life. David, what do you think, I'm going to turn my back on you now, after everything I've done for you? What, you think now that I'm not on your side? You can't trust me?",
        "David: Yes, I really think that I can't trust you, Spencer. You've been holding this over my head for years. And now you want me to turn around and just blindly trust you? Because you helped me \u0096 or think that you helped me -- 25 years ago not to mention the fact you've been blackmailing me ever since.",
        "Spencer: Come on, David, use your head, man. I'm all you've got, you understand? You don't have any place else to turn. David, I -- listen, without me, you're probably going to spend the rest of your life in prison. With me, and if you do what I say, you'll be a free man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ok, no one's here. Let's try to reach Bo one more time. Maybe he's out of his meeting.",
        "Adriana: Please, Rex, I thought about it a little more, and -- couldn't we just keep this between us just a little while longer?",
        "Rex: It's too dangerous. We have to call the cops!",
        "Adriana: Please, just for another day or so, ok? I'm begging you. If the cops are brought in, then my mother's going to find out, and my life will be ruined. Seriously. Not only will she hover over me day and night, I won't be able to leave my room. She won't let me see you anymore. It'll be worse than this. I'd rather be scared than totally trapped.",
        "Rex: Ok. We'll hold off on calling the cops. But I am not letting you out of my sight from now on. Tonight, I'm going to have to sleep on the couch.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Couch, huh? Rex, my mom has, like, 500 rooms.",
        "Rex: The couch thing is a figure of speech.",
        "Adriana: She's going to want to know why you're here.",
        "Rex: Maybe we can time it out so that Dorian never knows I'm around.",
        "Adriana: Ok. What? What does it mean, Rex? What does he want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: If you hadn't come along, Cris would still be fighting for $50 purses and getting his face smashed in. I mean, if you're going to get beat up, you might as well make decent money at it, right?",
        "Vincent: That's my sentiment exactly.",
        "Layla: I'll be back.",
        "Vincent: All right. Then we'll have that toast?",
        "Layla: Yeah.",
        "Vincent: Don't be long.",
        "Shaun: So what's up with this title fight? What's really going on?",
        "Vincent: What's really going on?",
        "Shaun: Yeah.",
        "Vincent: Well, you know I bet against my guy. And I came this close, man, I'm telling you, to win big. But then he got divine inspiration from his girlfriend. Huh.",
        "Shaun: So what? You going to bet against him again?",
        "Vincent: Well, you're right. But this time, this fight is for insurance. So even if his angel of mercy comes down and tries to perform one of those miracles, this man's going down. And I mean down with the crap beat out of him. Because you and I both know Vega can't take on Abbott.",
        "Shaun: How can you be so sure?",
        "Vincent: Have I ever had a problem getting what I want before? And I ain't about to start now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hugh: Ok, we are all in agreement that Spencer is the bad guy. We need to try something else. I can try again. But once a court order has been denied, there's not a lot you can do.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I'm glad you finally agree that Spencer's the bad guy, Hugh. Welcome to the party.",
        "Hugh: Thank you.",
        "Evangeline: But you know what? You're never going to get a court order. No. Look at Spencer. He's a prominent surgeon, he's well respected. He's -- no previous record. I mean, there's no way you're ever going to show cause to have his place bugged.",
        "Bo: All right, but what about you? Are you willing to help me, Evangeline?",
        "Evangeline: Bo, I'll do whatever I can, but I can't be the lead attorney on your case. Look, I still haven't figured out how to get around on my own. I mean, this is the first time I've ever used this thing in my life. And I haven't mastered Braille yet, so I can't read. I'd be happy to give you advice. I'll even be second chair, but I can't risk your freedom to take on this case by myself. You need the best possible attorney. Someone -- someone that can do a really good job for you right now.",
        "Bo: I know. And I think that that someone is you",
        "Evangeline: Well, thank you. But you're wrong. Look, believe me, I know you're going to beat this thing. So, promise to give me a call and let me know who you find to represent you.",
        "Bo: Ok. If worst comes to worst, though, and this does go to trial --",
        "Evangeline: We're going to pray that it never goes to trial. Ok.",
        "Hugh: Let me help you.",
        "Evangeline: No, no. I got it.",
        "Hugh: Can I get the door?",
        "Evangeline: You can get the door.",
        "Bo: Thank you for coming, Evangeline.",
        "Hugh: Now what?",
        "Bo: I'm not sure. One thing I do know is I'm going to use everything I've got, and I'm going to fight this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: As usual, you're right, Spencer. I have no choice, so I guess I'll trust you.",
        "Spencer: Good. Listen, I didn't bail you out of jail because I had an obligation to do so. I didn't do what I did 25 years ago because I had to. I did it because I care about you.",
        "David: Spencer, I shot and killed a man. I'm guilty. No amount of help is going to change that. You know where to find me.",
        "Spencer: I always have.",
        "David: You looking for me? This is what you wanted, isn't it? Eye for an eye?",
        "John: I can't hear you.",
        "David: Shades of Todd Manning?",
        "John: I can't hear you. What are you trying to say to me?",
        "David: You've got the wrong guy, lieutenant. Do you hear me now? You've got the wrong guy!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Vincent: I need to see you right away.",
        "Dorian: I just want you to tell me what's going on.",
        "Rex: I really need your help.",
        "David: Spencer's reign of terror is almost over.",
        "Blair: I'm with Spencer now.",
