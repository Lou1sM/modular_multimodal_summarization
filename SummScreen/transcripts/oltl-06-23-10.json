        "Ford asks Todd if they are done now that he has identified Hannah as his attacker. John tells Todd that Hannah's involvement in Ford's attack has nothing to do with Marty' case and that Todd is still a suspect. John issues a press release and an APB on Hannah. Marty is worried about what Hannah might to do Cole. Blair is worried that Hannah might have Starr. Hannah takes Cole to her grandfather's cabin to show him that Starr is there with James and when they find the cabin empty, she sends him to a local diner to ask around while she plants evidence in the cabin. She listens to his phone messages while he is gone and discovers that Ford named her as his attacker. She calls Ford and demands to know what he thinks he is doing. Cole later finds Starr's diploma and a condom wrapper that Hannah planted and she offers sympathy.",
        "Charlie throws lemonade on David Vickers when he sees him sunbathing naked in the yard at Llanfair. Charlie wants to take Viki to the cabin for some alone time, but Dorian arrives and announces that they have a meeting with a philanthropist about a grant for building a greenhouse next to the municipal building so Viki tells Charlie that he has to go to the meeting and that they can go to the cabin another time. Starr and James are at Viki's cabin. Starr plans to sell her car to get the money that James owes his father. James walks in on Starr when she is in her underwear. She yells at him, but then they clear the air. When they are ready to leave, they notice someone is coming into the cabin. Starr hides and James hits the intruder with a fireplace poker. Starr comes out of hiding and is horrified that James knocked out David Vickers."

        "David: Lois, is that you? Say, while you're here, could you pour me some more of that delicious, ice-cold lemonade--",
        "[David gasping, spitting]",
        "Charlie: Jeez.",
        "[David sighing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I just need some time to myself to think things through about Cole. Kiss Hope for me and tell her that I'll be back soon and don't worry about me.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Dorian: Well, that must be a load off your mind. Any word from John about that Hannah whatever her name is? Has she been apprehended yet?",
        "Blair: No. I just got off the phone with John. They haven't found her yet.",
        "Dorian: Honestly, I don't understand what's taking so long. She couldn't have gone very far.",
        "Langston: Why not?",
        "Dorian: Because I would just bet that that lunatic is wandering the hospital right now, waiting for the perfect opportunity to finish Robert Ford off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Are you here to give me a sponge bath?",
        "Nurse Tiffany: Not until you're out of that hospital gown.",
        "Ford: All right.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Ford: Hey, can you come back in a few?",
        "Nurse Tiffany: You'd better be ready for me then.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Ford: What the hell do you want now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I want to know what the hell's going on with Hannah O'Connor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay, forensics confirmed the blood found on Hannah O'Connor's sweater is a match for Robert Ford's. This is a list of all the locations she's most likely to show up at. Let's get a uniform on every one of them.",
        "Cop: Yes, sir. Anything else?",
        "John: Yeah. Uh, track down Price, all right? Have him canvass all of Hannah's friends. Make sure he questions every one of them. And get Lovett on the phone. Have him expand the APB.",
        "Cop: You got it, boss.",
        "John: Don't call me boss.",
        "Marty: Yeah, and please call me back. Let me know that you're all right.",
        "John: Another message for Cole?",
        "Marty: Yeah, if he's not checking them, he doesn't know that--that Ford named Hannah as the attacker.",
        "John: I know he's okay.",
        "Marty: How do you know that? What if Hannah got to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: So you sure this is where Starr and James said they were going?",
        "Hannah: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Okay, then.",
        "Hannah: Wait! When you find them in there, what are you gonna do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Noise outside]",
        "James: [Whispering] Starr, Starr. Wake up. Wake up. I think someone's outside. I think Bull found us.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: What the hell was that for?",
        "Charlie: What do you think-- Llanfair is some kind of a nude beach?",
        "David: I was waiting for Viki.",
        "Charlie: Naked?",
        "David: Are you saying Viki's naked?",
        "Charlie: Hey--",
        "David: Relax. I'm just here. I'm waiting to find out more about that job she offered me. You have any ideas? Style editor? Fashion guru? I know she wants to use my brain. Does \"The Banner\" have a centerfold?",
        "Charlie: There is no job, Vickers!",
        "David: Buchanan.",
        "Charlie: So why don't you just get back into your knickers and scurry off to London and get the hell out of here!",
        "Viki: Sweetheart.",
        "David and Charlie: Yes?",
        "Viki: Charlie? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, if Hannah wants to take a shot at Ford, she's gonna have to be creative. Because John said he has cops all over the hospital in case she shows up again.",
        "Langston: At this point, I wouldn't put anything past her.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Langston: Mm. Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Thank goodness you weren't home when that lunatic decided to vandalize your apartment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: She's gone after Cole. I know it. You saw her at the courthouse. And then she ransacked his apartment.",
        "John: There's no proof it was her.",
        "Marty: Who else could it have been? My son has been missing for nearly 24 hours. You really think she hasn't gone after him? Can you honestly tell me that he is safe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Yeah, I really wasn't expecting Hannah to trash our place. Kind of freaked me out.",
        "Dorian: As well it should have. Honey, really. I don't want you to leave this house until that lunatic is behind bars.",
        "Blair: I just wish Starr hadn't lost her phone. I'd like to be able to talk to my daughter, tell her not to go back to your apartment, to come here instead or just stay wherever she is.",
        "Dorian: Didn't she say where she was?",
        "Blair: Didn't leave a clue. No.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. That isn't like her.",
        "Blair: No. Go off and not tell us where.",
        "Langston: Well, she hasn't really been herself since Cole told her to stop coming to see him in jail.",
        "Blair: Cole was out on bail yesterday.",
        "Langston: And she told him she didn't want to see him.",
        "Dorian: Maybe she's had a change of heart. Honey, I want you to call Cole, please.",
        "Blair: Okay. I guess it's worth a shot.",
        "Dorian: Darling...I'm so glad that Ford finally told everybody that Hannah was his attacker.",
        "Langston: Because you were still thinking I did it?",
        "Dorian: No. Of course not. Though honestly, after what he did to you, nobody would blame you or Markko for wanting him dead.",
        "Langston: It's another thing to actually do something about it.",
        "Dorian: True. And since, unfortunately, he's going to survive, will you promise me this? If he tries to contact you, if you see him on the street and he takes even a step toward you, get in touch with me right away and I will see to it that he is taken care of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I did what you asked me. I told the cops yesterday that Hannah's the one that attacked me. No. How should I know why they haven't arrested her yet? That's not my problem! If the cops call me with any more information, you'll be the first to know. Now, are we done yet? Is this over?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, it's not over, as long as that psycho bitch is out there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You raised a smart kid. He knows how to take care of himself.",
        "Marty: Mm. I'm sure Robert Ford thought he could take care of himself. Look what she did to him.",
        "John: She went after him because he rejected her. Cole hasn't done that.",
        "Marty: No, but he was cold with her yesterday and she noticed. That's why she's so angry with me. She's accusing me of turning him against her.",
        "John: You didn't.",
        "Marty: What if I did and now Cole's paying the price for it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I don't know what I'm gonna do. I mean, I'm not sure that I believe that Starr and James are in there... or if they're together.",
        "Hannah: All right. It's great that you have faith in Starr, but I did hear him say that they were coming here. I don't know. I mean, maybe I just misunderstood.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Cole: Starr? Starr! See? I knew it. They're not here.",
        "Hannah: I'm so glad. At least now you know for sure.",
        "Cole: We drove all night to get to this place...in Delaware! Hannah, what's going on?",
        "Hannah: What are you talking about?",
        "Cole: Why would you drag me all the way over here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Sit down. Get down. Get down.",
        "Starr: Is he here? Is it Bull?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: David, why don't you go clean yourself up? You look rather wet.",
        "David: You say that like it's a bad thing.",
        "Viki: Go.",
        "David: Somebody's in trouble",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I thought you were fine with my decision to hire David.",
        "Charlie: Oh, come on, Viki. The only thing that that guy is capable of working on is his tan, and I doubt that that is in the job description.",
        "Viki: You ordered him to go back to London?",
        "Charlie: Look, all I have wanted to do since I woke up this morning was to whisk you off to the cabin, so that we could get away from David and Dorian and just...spend some time alone together.",
        "Viki: That's a lovely thought.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. And then I come out here looking for you and who do I find but, you know, David Vickers buck naked and oiled up like a rotisserie chicken. So yeah, I'm afraid I--I kind of lost it a little, I guess. But-- what do you say? Can't we just go up to the cabin, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Well, luckily Ford's gonna be in the hospital for a while, so you don't have to worry about me running into him.",
        "Dorian: Sweetheart... you are still the same fabulous, talented, beautiful girl you were before you met Ford. And nothing that he could ever do to you...will ever change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You haven't answered my question. When Hannah goes down for attacking me, are we done? Hello? Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I have to get to writers' workshop.",
        "Dorian: What? Excuse me. Were you listening? I told you I didn't want you leaving this house!",
        "Langston: Okay. If I put my life on hold for Hannah, then the terrorists win.",
        "Dorian: Wait, wait. At least let me have one of my security people keep an eye on you, tail the car. I mean it. I want you to be safe. And if you see Cole or Starr...",
        "Langston: I will have them call you.",
        "Dorian: Good. And you call me, too, you hear--",
        "Blair: Well, Cole didn't pick up.",
        "Dorian: Good.",
        "Blair: Why is that good?",
        "Dorian: C'est absolument parfait!",
        "Blair: What does that mean?",
        "Dorian: Perfect. It's perfect, darling. It means that Cole and Starr met up and now they've gone somewhere to... kiss and make up. Ohh!",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Blair: I hope you're right.",
        "Dorian: I know I'm right. And I have to go. Bye-bye.",
        "Blair: Bye.",
        "Dorian: Oh, um, ahem. Is...you know. Eli still here?",
        "Blair: Yeah, he is. He's getting dressed.",
        "Dorian: I see. Would you make sure to tell him how much I appreciate everything that he did for Langston when she was still a suspect?",
        "Blair: I'll give him the message, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: You do that. Bye-bye.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Eli: So...have you heard from Starr?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, you can't blame yourself for something you don't even know happened.",
        "Marty: The girl threatened me and now I can't find my son. It's hard not to fear the worst.",
        "John: Let me show you something. This is the jail visitor's log.",
        "Marty: Looks like Hannah visited Cole nearly every day.",
        "John: Up until the bail hearing, which means they were still friends.",
        "Marty: Exactly. \"Were.\" Cole's starting to consider the possibility that Hannah pushed me down the stairs and pinned it on Todd. What if he confronts her? Sets her over the edge, just like something did with Ford.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Todd: Why haven't you arrested that little nutjob yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hannah, did you really hear Starr and James saying they were coming here?",
        "Hannah: I wish I hadn't, but I saw them leaving graduation together and I heard him say that he wanted to take her someplace where they could be alone. And then he said something about \"the only house on blue crab inlet.\"",
        "Cole: Well, that's definitely this place.",
        "Hannah: I understand how you're feeling. I wouldn't want to believe me, either, but you called Starr back and you got James' voicemail. How could I make that up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Come here. You gotta see this.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? Is that Bull?",
        "James: It's a bunch of deer and they're feasting on your aunt's garden. Come here. Look. They're getting real close to the house.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? I just lost 10 years of my life because of Bambi and friends? Aww. Look at the little fawn.",
        "James: I'm really sorry that I scared you. Bull's just really got me spooked.",
        "Starr: We have a guy threatening to kill us if we don't give him back his money. We'd be crazy if we weren't spooked.",
        "James: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Starr: I'm gonna grab a shower. The faster we get ready, the faster we can get out of here. Then we can go pick up the car, turn it into the money that you owe, give it to Bull to get him off our backs, and then I can get back to Cole and my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Is it working yet?",
        "Cole: Nothing much I can do until it's charged.",
        "Hannah: For your own peace of mind, you should find out that James and Starr weren't here.",
        "Cole: How do I do that?",
        "Hannah: There was a little diner on the way in. You should go there, ask around, and if no one's seen them, you could stop worrying.",
        "Cole: All right, let me take this. I'll show them the picture on the phone and ask around.",
        "Hannah: Okay.",
        "Cole: Be right back.",
        "Hannah: Sorry, Grandpa, but I knew you wouldn't be here..",
        "Cole: Well, no one at the diner saw James or Starr.",
        "Hannah: That's great. I'm really sorry for worrying you. I must have just misunderstood.",
        "Cole: You were just looking out for me. But we should probably go.",
        "Hannah: Well, don't you think we should rest first? I mean, we've been driving all night. We should sleep for an hour or 2 before we hit the road.",
        "Cole: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",
        "Hannah: Where are you going?",
        "Cole: To the car? We can't sleep here. We're trespassing as it is.",
        "Hannah: Right. Well...I mean, we are already here, and... doesn't really look like anybody actually lives here, so...",
        "Cole: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Hannah: Come on. I mean, we're college students. People expect us to wander into the wrong house. We're both exhausted.",
        "Cole: You're not kidding.",
        "Hannah: I'll take the couch. You can curl up in the bed.",
        "Cole: No, no, no. You get the bed. I'll take the couch.",
        "Hannah: No. Seriously. It's fine, Cole.",
        "Cole: Okay. Thanks. But holler at me if anyone shows up, okay? Oh, and here. Thanks. I checked my messages.",
        "Hannah: Oh, yeah. No problem. Did you--did you get through?",
        "Cole: The reception here stinks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Bull, don't worry. I'm getting you the money I owe my dad. By the end of the day. I promise.",
        "Starr: Sorry. I just forgot my stuff. I left a towel out for you, though.",
        "James: Oh, thanks. I made some coffee, by the way.",
        "Starr: Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Voice on phone: Message one.",
        "Marty on phone: Cole, where are you? Did you get John's messages? Ford named the person who attacked him, and it was Hannah.",
        "Ford: Oh, yeah. You have made me forget all my you know, it almost makes it worth having my skull cracked.",
        "Nurse Tiffany: Really?",
        "Ford: Yeah. You are that good. But you know, I think you missed a spot.",
        "Nurse Tiffany: I'll have to take care of that.",
        "Langston: New girlfriend?",
        "Ford: She's just doing her job, Langston. One that I bet you'd be pretty good at, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: I was sure by the time I got down here you'd have figured out where Starr is.",
        "Blair: Well, apparently, Starr needs some time alone to figure out what she's gonna do about Cole, but Dorian thinks that Starr and Cole are together.",
        "Eli: That is a distinct possibility.",
        "Blair: But you know, it's not like Starr to go off. And then with Hannah out there, you know, on the loose--",
        "Eli: Cops are gonna find her.",
        "Blair: No. Todd and Starr both think that Hannah pushed Marty down that flight of stairs so it would break up Cole and Starr. And then she tried to kill Ford? No telling what she would do to Starr.",
        "Eli: I don't think that's happening.",
        "Blair: She's a lunatic. She's a psychopath. She could--she could do something to Starr. In fact, you know, maybe she already has Starr. Maybe she's the one that forced Starr to make that phone call to tell her that she needed some time.",
        "Eli: Oh, Blair, I doubt that.",
        "Blair: God, am I just being paranoid here?",
        "Eli: Of course not. You are Starr's mother. It's your job to worry about her. We will do everything we need to do to find her.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I just got off the phone with my P.I. and he informed me that an arrest warrant had been issued for Hannah O'Connor.",
        "John: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Todd: Where is she?",
        "John: Well, not that it's any of your business, but we're working on it.",
        "Todd: What's none of my business? Are you aware that Ford ID'd her as his attacker?",
        "John: I'm sorry--what does this have to do with you?",
        "Todd: Well, it's proof, man. It proves that he's the one who attacked Marty and killed your kid.",
        "John: No, it doesn't.",
        "Todd: You guys are unbelievable. You just don't--you don't care about the truth, do you? You just want to stick to the story that I did it because that's the version you really like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I know that things have been a little tense between us since we got back together again and it's all these stupid, ridiculous conversations about David and Dorian.",
        "Charlie: Look, I am not jealous of David. It's just that he does seem to get naked around you an awful lot.",
        "Viki: I know, but you can't take David being naked seriously.",
        "Charlie: I know I shouldn't, but sometimes I'm--I'm sorry. It just kind of gets to me.",
        "Viki: Well, I do know how you feel, because it really bothers me when Dorian monopolizes all your time.",
        "Charlie: You know what I think? I think that all this tension will disappear if we just have a little relaxation, a little romance, and so I talked to Lois and had her make a little picnic basket for us.",
        "Viki: I don't think the weather's going to cooperate.",
        "Charlie: It's gonna be cloudy down here, but the forecast says up on Llantano Mountain, it's gonna be nothing but blue skies.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, in that case, you're a genius, and I love you for it.",
        "Charlie: And I love you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, my! Am I interrupting anything?",
        "Charlie: Dorian, what are you doing here? You know this is my day off, and you know that Viki and I are planning to go to the cabin.",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes. The cabin. But I have some absolutely wonderful news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Starr, you used all the hot--",
        "[Starr gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Wonderful news? This had better be spectacular news.",
        "Dorian: As I'm sure Charles has told you--",
        "Viki: \"Charles\"?",
        "Charlie: Uh...",
        "Dorian: I have applied for a grant from the Shaw Foundation.",
        "Viki: Yes. He has mentioned that.",
        "Dorian: Yes, and he has a dream, as I'm sure you know, of building an ecologically friendly greenhouse as an annex to the civic center, a place where, year round, children can grow their little vegetables and flowers.",
        "Viki: Yeah. I'm familiar with the concept, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: What, are you saying that we got the grant?",
        "Dorian: Not quite, but we're in the top 3, and Mr. Henderson, the head of the foundation, wants to interview us and look at your blueprints today.",
        "Charlie: What, today, without any notice?",
        "Dorian: Well, he e-mailed me this morning.",
        "Viki: Oh, please.",
        "Dorian: He did. I have it right here. He tells me, us, that he is going to be in Philadelphia in the morning and would we mind if he came here to see us, so naturally, I told him no, we did not mind.",
        "Charlie: And you couldn't just call me?",
        "Dorian: I didn't think I need to. I mean, this is the chance of a lifetime. Your concept of that greenhouse is absolute genius, and the Shaw Foundation could give us the money to realize it. We cannot pass this up.",
        "Charlie: You are absolutely right, Dorian, and you'll just have to take that meeting alone.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no. No. Mr. Henderson is very specific. He wants to see you, as well.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm sorry, Dorian, but I already have plans with Viki today.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I think you should go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: What are you doing down here?",
        "James: What? Nothing.",
        "Starr: You're supposed to be in the shower!",
        "James: I was. You used up all the hot water.",
        "Starr: No, I didn't, and don't look at me. What, did you try to come down here and see me naked?",
        "James: I didn't see anything, I swear.",
        "Starr: You didn't?",
        "James: Besides, it's not like I've never seen a girl naked before. Trust me, okay? I don't need to sneak up on women to see them in the buff.",
        "Starr: Oh, please. Ew! You are so full of yourself. What did you do, take a lesson from your pig of a brother?",
        "James: Hey! You don't know a damn thing about my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Thanks again, Tiff. Same time tomorrow?",
        "Tiffany: If you're lucky.",
        "Ford: I take it you're not here to wish me a speedy recovery.",
        "Langston: I heard Hannah was the one who put you in here.",
        "Ford: Yeah. I never saw it coming. I thought I could handle her after I dumped her.",
        "Langston: I know just how she felt. I was a suspect, too, you know, and they arrested Markko.",
        "Ford: He's not still in jail, is he?",
        "Langston: No. Now he'll never want anything to do with me again.",
        "Ford: You probably blame me for that, don't you?",
        "Langston: Why should I? It's not your fault. It's mine. I went against everything I believed in to be with you. I lied to my friends. I lied to my family. I lied to myself. One person that I never lied to was you. I trusted you. That's my fault, too.",
        "Ford: Why are you here, Langston?",
        "Langston: I came by before while you were still sleeping, but I didn't get any answers.",
        "Ford: Okay. What do you want to know?",
        "Langston: You said that I never really meant anything to you, so why did you say that you loved me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: She was arrested for attacking Ford. This time, it has nothing to do with you.",
        "Todd: Okay. Did you even bother to question Hannah about whether she attacked Marty?",
        "Marty: Of course he did. She stuck with her story.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's a shocker. She's only been making up this lie about me for months. What were you gonna do, brood at her and she was gonna cave?",
        "Marty: Whoever did this made me lose our baby. You don't think that John and I want answers? You don't think we want to find Hannah?",
        "Todd: \"Whoever did this,\" is what you said. So you don't think I did it. Wonderful. I'd like these charges dropped, please, and I'd like you to find Hannah.",
        "Marty: Is that all you think about, what's at stake for you? My son is missing.",
        "Todd: Really? I think I know where he is.",

        "Hannah: What's wrong?",
        "Cole: I found this in the bedroom.",
        "Hannah: Okay. It's Starr's diploma. That doesn't mean that she and James, you know--",
        "Cole: This does.",
        "Hannah: I'm so sorry.",

        "Viki: What?",
        "Charlie: You mean more to me than any grant, okay? You and I have plans.",
        "Viki: I know, darling, but the cabin is not going anywhere, and neither am I. Sweetheart, the Shaw Foundation is one of the most prestigious environmental philanthropies in the world. You've been talking about this greenhouse for weeks. I know how much it means to you.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, not as much as you do.",
        "Viki: I would like to see you be able to realize this dream. If the interview is today, you need to go.",
        "Charlie: Viki B. ...",
        "Viki: Hmm?",
        "Charlie: You never cease to amaze me.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on.",
        "Dorian: Henderson is on his way. We can't keep him waiting.",
        "Charlie: I'll call you when it's done. Okay.",

        "Dorian: Come, Charles.",

        "Viki: Mm?",
        "David: What do you say you, me, and that pic-i-nic basket take a long drive up to love cabin?",
        "Viki: Aw, thank you, David, but no, thanks.",
        "David: Ah.",
        "[David sighs]",
        "David: Oh, for crying out loud, would you look at that? It's all cloudy now...but it's sunny up on Llantano Mountain.",

        "Starr: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.",
        "James: Yeah. Well, whatever you think of him, Starr, he's still my brother.",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "James: I haven't seen him in a really long time, so I don't know what he did to you to make you not like him, but you have no idea what he's been through.",
        "Starr: You're right. I don't.",
        "James: However bad he's been, whatever he did, it's not his fault, all right? He is who he is because my dad made him that way.",
        "Starr: Trust me, James... I know what fathers can do to their children.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No. I don't think you need to worry about Cole.",
        "Marty: You said you know where he is. Where is he?",
        "Todd: Well, I'm sure he's getting his itch scratched by Hannah. What, you don't think so? They probably ran away together, our own little Bonnie and Clyde. Ah, yeah. They were pretty hot between the sheets, right?",
        "John: All right. That's it. Get the hell out of here.",
        "Todd: What? Come on. You know it's true.",
        "John: Now! Move.",

        "Blair: Hey, John. Okay, Todd. What was that about?",
        "Todd: Whoa, my two favorite people--my ex-wife and Cole's lawyer. Nice to see you guys.",
        "Eli: Always a pleasure to see you, too, Todd.",
        "Todd: I got to call T\u00e9a, get these charges dropped.",
        "Blair: Have you heard from Starr?",
        "Todd: So long. You have any idea what I've been going through?",
        "Blair: Todd, would you stop making all this about you?",
        "Todd: What's wrong, Blair?",
        "Blair: I want to know if you've heard from Starr.",
        "Todd: Well, not recently. I was supposed to meet her at the car dealership. Why? What's wrong? Where is she? Don't tell me you don't know where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm sorry if your father messed you up and your brother, but you have to understand that Ford hurt my best friend really badly.",
        "James: And now he's lying in a hospital bed. Look. I'm sorry that I yelled at you and for walking in on you when you're almost naked.",
        "Starr: Well, it's okay. I mean, you didn't see anything, so--",
        "James: Well, actually, I--",
        "Starr: You are a piece of work. Do you know that? Oh...",
        "James: Oh, and you're not so bad yourself, twinkle.",
        "Starr: What did you just call me?",
        "James: Oh, come on. All these years, no one has ever called you that?",
        "Starr: Not twice. Oh, all right. I am going to go upstairs and get changed, and I am going to lock the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You didn't have to tell me that you loved me. All you had to do was snap your fingers, and I would come running over to have sex with you. So why'd you say it?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Langston: Forget it. I already know the answer. I shouldn't have come.",
        "Ford: What do you want now?",
        "James: To see how my big brother was doing.",
        "Ford: James, I'm sorry.",
        "James: Who did you think it was?",
        "Ford: Uh, doesn't matter. Are you okay?",
        "James: I was calling to see how you were doing.",
        "Ford: Better. I'm getting better, actually. How are you? You disappeared on me the other day.",
        "James: Yeah. I just had to go. That was it.",
        "Ford: Are you in trouble? Is it Dad? What did he do now?",
        "James: Nothing. I'm fine.",

        "Cole: I was in the bedroom. Sheets and blankets were all over the place. I tried to straighten up the bed, and I got in and found Starr's diploma and...that.",
        "Hannah: Cole, I'm so sorry. I was really hoping that I was wrong about Starr and James.",
        "Cole: God, I can't believe this happened. D'oh! But I know why she did. It's my fault.",
        "Hannah: Cole, no.",
        "Cole: Look. I told her not to come see me in jail. I pushed her away.",
        "Hannah: Hey, don't do this to yourself. I'm sure that guy did a number on her when she was feeling really vulnerable.",
        "Cole: It doesn't matter how it happened, all right? It did, and now... I don't think things are ever gonna be the same between us again.",
        "Hannah: Hey... I'm so sorry.",

        "Eli: Marty, I know you're worried that Cole might be with Hannah, but there's more. He doesn't check in soon, he may be charged with jumping bail.",
        "Marty: Well, that's the least of my worries right now. My son could be fighting for his life, just like Robert Ford had to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I need to go for a walk.",
        "Hannah: You want some company?",
        "Cole: No, than. I just need to clear my head.",
        "Hannah: Okay. Um...I'm sorry.",
        "Cole: For what?",
        "Hannah: For starting this whole mess, you know, with showing you the picture of Starr and James. You so did not need to see that.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Yeah. I did. I didn't tell Markko when Langston was sleeping with Ford, and I regret that, so you did the right thing.",

        "Starr: Oh, it's about time. Bull could've shown up and dragged me away 3 times for how long you took up there.",
        "James: Oh, yeah? Well, too bad he didn't. 5 minutes alone with you, and he'd be paying me 50 grand to take you back.",
        "Starr: Oh, only 50? I must have been on my best behavior.",
        "James: All right. Come on. Let's go take care of this, and you can get back to your baby, your boyfriend, and your life. Come on. Let's go.",
