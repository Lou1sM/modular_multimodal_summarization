        "T\u00e9a: He does not need to be handcuffed. He is a kid. He's not dangerous, John.",
        "John: Tell that to Gigi Morasco.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I know it won't bring you back, but if I sign your name here, I can keep your heart from beating inside Clint Buchanan's chest. I'm doing it, Morasco.",
        "Echo: Rex? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I miss you so much.",
        "David: I've missed you, too, Pa. You should probably focus on Matthew right now, but I've missed you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deanna: Nate! Matthew's coming around. He opened his eyes. He's gonna be ok.",
        "Nate: I heard.",
        "Deanna: So why do you look so depressed?",
        "Nate: No. I'm happy for him, but now it's only a matter of time before he tells his parents that I'm the one that put him in that hospital bed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Hey, Twinkle. It's me. Listen, I think I forgot to tell you that graduation is outside this year. But don't worry. My mom's gonna save us some seats. So I'll be waiting inside for you, right by where I grabbed you last year after you got your diploma. Remember that? Hurry up. Maybe we can relive it.",
        "[Footsteps]",
        "James: Bob, what's going on? What's wrong? Did Tess break up with you?",
        "Ford: Jessica's back. Go ahead and say it. You told me so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baz: A McMansion? Seriously? Damn! Is that my cousin?",
        "Dani: Hi.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Daniella, I'd like you to meet my son. Sebastian.",
        "Dani: Your son? Since when?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Last night. It was a sort of a surprise, right?",
        "Baz: To me, too.",
        "Dani: Whoa, welcome to the club.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't know what you're talking about, John. Jack didn't lay a finger on Gigi Morasco.",
        "John: His prints were all over the basement where she was found.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's because the house belongs to a family friend, Detective. Jack spends a lot of time there. I'd be surprised if prints weren't found there. It doesn't prove a thing.",
        "Todd: That's right, so the party's over. Let him go.",
        "John: What do you think, Jack? Are you innocent?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Man: Yo! You called for a delivery?",
        "Old Todd: Guessing you've heard 'em all.",
        "Man: To be frank, yeah.",
        "Old Todd: Keep it all. You deserve it.",
        "Man: Thank you.",
        "Old Todd: Mm-hmm. Not my money anyway. It belongs...to Agent Kent, who, sadly, I had to kill last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: This has nothing to do with you.",
        "Echo: I'm your mother, and I want to help. What is this?",
        "Rex: Just leave me alone!",
        "Echo: What, and-- and let you end up in jail? Do you see this woman lying here? My grandson has already lost his mother. I'm not about to let him lose his father, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Innocent until proven guilty. Isn't that how it works, T\u00e9a?",
        "John: Is that the road you wanna go down, Jack? Maybe weasel your way out of the system? Maybe you want to tell the truth right here and now. I don't think you meant for this to happen. I don't. I think you were playing an innocent prank on Shane when you lured him to that basement. But his mom showed up instead, and you didn't realize that had happened. You didn't realize the generator was leaking carbon monoxide. You didn't mean to hurt anyone, did you, Jack? You just wanted to get back at Shane, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: How freaked out are you, finding out that Tom\u00e1s is your dad after all these years?",
        "Baz: It's not like I can do anything about it.",
        "Dani: You're handling this well. I mean, I lost it.",
        "Baz: Oh, yeah? Tell me more.",
        "Dani: Oh, maybe another time. It's not really a \"meet your long-lost cousin for the first time\" kind of story.",
        "Baz: How about the second?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm sure you'll hear all about it in good time.",
        "Baz: What's the matter, Dad? Afraid I'll tell your niece our story?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How was New York? Did you find out what's going on with Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Blair: Well, not exactly, but I did meet someone who gave me a little insight.",
        "Starr: Who?",
        "Blair: His wife.",
        "Starr: His w--",

        "David: Pa! Oh, my God! Pa!",
        "Bo: David, my ribs.",
        "David: I'm so sorry I couldn't get here any sooner.",
        "Bo: That's ok. You're here now.",
        "David: You should know, your daughter-in-law is beside herself.",
        "Bo: My--ahh. Dorian.",
        "David: Loves Matthew.",
        "Bo: She's gonna be happy to know he's showing signs of improvement.",
        "David: Has he asked for me?",
        "Bo: No. But he hasn't spoken to anyone yet, David. He's making eye contact with us, and his brain functions are improving, and he's breathing on his own. Doctors aren't sure how much... Nora's talking to a specialist right now.",
        "David: Hey, Matthew is going to be fine. Better than ever. I know it.",
        "Bo: I appreciate your confidence, David.",
        "David: Gotta get that boy back on his feet in time for the premiere.",
        "Bo: The premiere?",
        "David: Of my movie. I need him on the red carpet.",
        "Bo: I know that he'd love to be there.",
        "David: You have any idea who did this to him? Because I will eviscerate the yellow-bellied sapsucker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: If he tells his dad that I'm the one who decked him, it is over for me.",
        "Deanna: No, but don't forget why you were there in the first place. He killed your dad, remember? He's not gonna want to go public with all that.",
        "Nate: His uncle already confessed.",
        "Deanna: And if you start talking again, it'll all blow up again, ok? He's not gonna want to make any accusations, if he even remembers what happened, which a lot of people with brain trauma don't.",
        "Nate: Really?",
        "Deanna: Yes, I did some research online. In most cases, people don't even remember how they got hurt.",
        "Man: Nathaniel Salinger? Your cap and gown.",
        "Nate: Yes, sir.",
        "Man: Today.",
        "Deanna: Listen, you're graduating. This should be one of the happiest days of your life! I know it was for me. You're free until you get a job or go to college and all the bills start piling up and--",
        "Nate: This is you cheering me up?",
        "Deanna: This is me reminding you of what's important. Today. And what it means.",
        "Nate: All right. Thank you for everything, for having my back. I'm really glad you're here, Deanna.",
        "Rick: Hey, baby.",
        "Deanna: What are you doing here?",
        "Rick: I am in preproduction, casting my new movie. I need a hottie for the lead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Echo, this is none of your business.",
        "Echo: You were gonna forge her signature, weren't you, to make it look like you had the power to make the decisions about what, her medical care? Organ donation? I'm sorry, Rex. It's not going to work. You forge her name, and you're going to end up in prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on, Jack, be a man. Tell the truth.",
        "T\u00e9a: Not one word. Do you hear me?",
        "John: You know, Jack, by refusing to cooperate, it makes me think you're hiding something, that you planned all this, that you knew what you were doing. You knew what you were doing when you left that generator on--",
        "Jack: I didn't even see the generator!",
        "T\u00e9a: Jack! Not another word.",
        "Jack: It's my life. What if I want to tell him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Mmm! Mmm! This is not so bad, right? Got two guns and a dead guy's wallet, dead guy's phone, some newspaper published by Todd Manning. Agent Kent, I'm so sorry I had to kill you, but you did say that you were gonna kill that kid who said that Todd Manning was his father, which does not make any sense. If Todd Manning has a kid named Sam, and I'm supposed to be Todd Manning...I don't have a kid named Sam. Do I have a kid named Sam? Hmm. Well, Agent Kent... I know there's more of you out there. The place was crawling with you when I woke up. You all wanna kill me. I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm here now, and this is where I'm gonna stay.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You and I are gonna find the varmint who did this to Matthew. Strike up a posse. Drive him to the ground, string him up by his privates.",
        "Bo: David, we don't know how Matthew got hurt. For all we know, he could have just tripped and hit his head. So, until he can tell us what happened...",
        "David: No posse?",
        "Bo: Not yet.",
        "David: Can I talk to him?",
        "Bo: Yeah, sure. I bet he'd love that, but just take it easy with him, ok? Don't pressure him into talking, and don't ask him how it happened. We don't want to rile him up.",
        "David: Pa, you can trust me. I would never do anything to hurt Matthew. I love that kid.",
        "Bo: I know, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deanna: You're recruiting for porn in a school?",
        "Rick: Oh, please. Half these kids are giving it away as it is. Check out their phones. Like it's worse than sexting? \"Hold the Diploma\" is a step up. At least they'll be in focus.",
        "Deanna: \"Hold the Diploma\"?",
        "Rick: New title. New series. I owed some people for \"Hold the Pepperoni.\" I just had to temporarily retire the franchise. It's really sad. I don't even want to talk about it.",
        "Deanna: I'm not saying sexting's great or anything, but that's somebody's choice.",
        "Rick: So is this, and I pay cash at the end of any day, a lot more than you can make by showing your ta-tas to your boyfriend. So all these seniors bound for college with loans to pay...I'm your man.",
        "Deanna: I don't know if the counselors would agree with that.",
        "Rick: I challenge them to find a better paying job for kids with nothing but a high school diploma and a great pair of--",
        "Deanna: I'm calling security.",
        "Rick: You know what. You're not calling anybody. You want to know why? Because I know what your boyfriend did to the police commissioner's kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: So you had sex, and then Jessica came back?",
        "Ford: I don't know why she's back. All I know is that she's not letting me near my son. I can't lose my boy and... my girl.",
        "James: There's gotta be something you can do.",
        "Ford: I don't know enough about Jessica's condition to know where to start. And Ryder comes first, right? I have to do whatever it takes to be a good dad.",
        "James: Yeah. Hey, want me to get back in that nun's habit? Just say the word, buddy, I'll help you out.",
        "Ford: No, no. I appreciate what you're trying to do. I do. But I think you just need to enjoy every minute you can with Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Tom\u00e1s is married? When was he planning on telling you, your 19th date?",
        "Blair: Actually, we haven't been on even the first date where it hadn't been interrupted.",
        "Starr: He lied to you. I hope you told him where he could stick his paintings and his music and that beard of his.",
        "Blair: I kind of like his beard.",
        "Starr: Hello! Snap out of it. He is a snake.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, it's not that simple. He's been separated from the woman for years.",
        "Starr: Separated is not divorced.",
        "Blair: Exactly, because she wouldn't sign the papers.",
        "Starr: Why? Because her snake of a husband is just that much of a gem?",
        "Blair: Look, Tom\u00e1s is not the guilty party here. She has been using their son as a weapon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Dani, the truth is, my ex-wife was having an affair, and she told both me and Sebastian that her lover was his father. I had no reason to suspect any different.",
        "Baz: No reason? She lied to you for months. She had an affair. Why would you trust her about anything, unless of course, it was convenient.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Convenient?",
        "Baz: Sure. If you believed her, you didn't have to get stuck with a kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Tom\u00e1s has a son?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. His name is Sebastian.",
        "Starr: And he didn't tell you about him either?",
        "Blair: Starr, he didn't find out until yesterday, 'cause his very French wife decided she didn't feel like being a parent anymore and admitted that they had a child together. And she did decide that she would sign the divorce papers if Tom\u00e1s would take Sebastian off her hands.",
        "Starr: I feel sorry for Sebastian.",
        "Blair: I would, too, if there was anything to really like about the boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baz: I get it. I would have ruined your life as an artist, and you know it. Anyway, it doesn't matter. What you don't know can't hurt you.",
        "Dani: Only you do know, and I think it matters a lot.",
        "Baz: Only if you think about it, which I don't plan on doing.",
        "Baz: When you said we had a lot in common, I didn't think you meant Daddy issues.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I was talking about your interest in music. Danielle happens to be a wonderful singer.",
        "Dani: Oh, I'm ok, but my sister, she's amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: What don't you like about him?",
        "Blair: I'm not going to rush into judgment here.",
        "Starr: Oh, come on. Tell me.",
        "Blair: Ok, well, I think he's lot like his mother. I think he's sarcastic, arrogant, snooty, but he's young, so hopefully he'll grow out of it.",
        "Starr: Guess it just depends on what he does next.",
        "Blair: I guess we're gonna find out, 'cause I convinced him to come back to Llanview with his dad. I figured T\u00e9a will certainly give him the attitude adjustment that he needs or maybe you or Dani.",
        "Starr: Me?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. I kind of promised that you'd hang out with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Ok, I'll tell you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ok. This interview's over.",
        "Jack: You can't do that.",
        "Todd: She's your lawyer, Jack.",
        "Jack: So? What if I want to tell him?",
        "Cop: Lieutenant? We have something.",
        "John: Hang on.",
        "Todd: She's your lawyer. You want my help, you do what I say. Understand me?",
        "John: Jack, you were saying?",
        "[T\u00e9a clears throat]",
        "Jack: Nothing. I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Cop: Lieutenant, you're gonna want to see this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: T\u00e9a wouldn't help me marry Gigi, so I'm doing what I got to to protect her.",
        "Echo: Rex, listen to me. In order for a power of attorney to hold up in court, Gigi has to have been of sound mind when she signed it. It has to be witnessed by two people. It has to be certified by a notary, not to mention a copy of it has to be placed on file. Simply forging it is not going to work.",
        "Rex: So, how am I supposed to stop Clint from getting Gigi's heart?",
        "Echo: Is that really what you want? Your father--I know there's no love lost between the two of you, but he is dying. Gigi's heart can save him. Honey, she signed the donor card. She wants to be of service.",
        "Rex: If they want to give her heart to some 10-year-old in a car crash, that's fine, but not Clint Buchanan. No way.",
        "Echo: Honey, you cannot play God here.",
        "Rex: No, he's the one playing God. How do you think he got to the top of the list? This is his hospital, his town. I'm surprised he hasn't sent his thugs in here to drag her down to the O.R.",
        "Echo: He is a powerful man. There's no question there.",
        "Rex: He never got to know Gigi and Shane. He never tried to start any kind of relationship with them. He thought that I was after his money.",
        "Echo: He is a terrible man. He's been terrible to the two of you.",
        "Rex: Clint is not getting her heart. End of story. If you're not with me on this, get out.",
        "Echo: I am with you. Always and forever. I'm gonna prove it to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Where is Starr?",
        "James: Oh, she's probably off listening to some music.",
        "Ford: What does that mean?",
        "James: She met this guy, and he came on to her--not that I blame him, but he took her mp3 player, and he wipes out her entire playlist and puts his own stuff on there without even asking her.",
        "Ford: Did she delete it?",
        "James: She likes it.",
        "Ford: Huh.",
        "James: No, I'm not worried. The guy sounds totally desperate.",
        "Ford: I don't know, dude. As a former player, I'd watch out for him.",
        "James: Yeah? I would, if he lived here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Thanks a lot, Mom. It's not like I don't have to take care of Hope or go to school or find time for James. Now I have to babysit your boyfriend's son who is a snobby little kid from Paris who thinks he's cooler than everyone else?",
        "Blair: Why don't you just back it on down? 'Cause he is kind of cool, and I think that you would like him. He's somewhat of a musician.",
        "Starr: Yeah? Is he snobby or cool?",
        "Blair: He's young. I think that's what I said. Besides, you know what, his mother dumped him off on someone he doesn't even know, so why don't you give him a chance?",
        "Starr: Why don't you give him a chance?",
        "Blair: Maybe I am giving him a chance, 'cause I'm gonna let him use Capricorn to work on his music.",
        "Starr: Right. You said he's a musician.",
        "Blair: That's right, just like his dad.",
        "Starr: That's funny.",
        "Blair: What's funny?",
        "Starr: I just met a musician the other day.",
        "Starr: Really? Who?",
        "Starr: Doesn't matter. He doesn't live here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baz: You have a sister? I have another cousin?",
        "Dani: No, she's my half-sister. You'll meet her someday. So do you sing or--",
        "Baz: I compose. Lyrics and music.",
        "Dani: Oh, just like your dad. I haven't heard a lot of your stuff, but he played me a really beautiful piece once. Anyways, it blew me away. Listen, I'm sorry. I've gotta run. You guys probably need time to get to know each other, so I'll see you later.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So you hungry? You want to get something to eat?",
        "Baz: Not hungry. Dani! Wait up. I'm coming with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deanna: Nate is just a friend. He didn't do anything.",
        "Rick: Will you save it? I heard you and Nate talking at the Buenos Dias about he put Matthew Buchanan in the hospital. I'm sure the Commish would love to know the down and dirty about why his son almost died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Matthew. Hey, little bro, it's your big bro! Matthew, it's safe. All the grownups are gone. You can open up your eyes now. Come on! Little bro! Don't you want to go out and have some fun? What's that--looks like we got you. Oh, we got you. Matthew! Matthew, blink once if you know me and twice if you love me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deanna: Nate didn't mean to hurt Matthew. It was an accident.",
        "Rick: Then why didn't he come forward? Because maybe it wasn't an accident, and you know about it, which makes you an accessory. I could go to the Commish, and then you and your graduate go to jail. Or I can just forget about it.",
        "Deanna: What do you want?",
        "Rick: Take a wild guess. I want to make you a star.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: My side says Clint dies. You're not on my side.",
        "Echo: I may not agree with you, but I will back you up.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Echo: Because you're my son, and Shane's my grandson. If you go to jail, what happens to him? He's already lost his mother. I'm not gonna let him lose you, too. Please, just let me take care of this.",
        "Rex: No--",
        "Echo: Yes. Rex. I abandoned you when you were a child. When I finally found you, I lied to you about your father. Please, I have a chance to make up for it now. Please, just let me do that.",
        "Rex: How?",
        "Echo: First things first. Do you know if Gigi has anything around here that might have her signature on, it so that I can forge this baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Should have just confessed.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, Jack. You're innocent until the police prove otherwise.",

        "Jack: Yeah, I guess so.",

Do you remember those escorts that I hired for us way back when, when Dani dumped you, and Dorian didn't think I was her number-one anymore? Do you remember that? Guess what. I still got 'em here on speed dial. Pa told me I'm not supposed to push you, but doggone it, sometimes a man needs to be pushed. Why do you think I married Dorian the first time? Or the second time? Or the third time for that mat--that's not important, Matthew. What's important is I got 'em all right here on speed dial. Pound 1 is Fawn. Pound 2 is Mandy. Pound 3 is--I don't remember her name, but she's hot. Matthew, you just--",

Oh, Matthew, I'm so glad you're back with us. Don't you tell Dorian this, but you're my best friend, and we got you back... All thanks to me.",
