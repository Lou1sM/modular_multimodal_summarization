        "Clint: Dr. Evans, I've been telling the family the wonders that you've worked with other cases like Matthew's.",
        "Nora: It's certainly a pleasure to meet you.",
        "Bo: I appreciate your taking the time to look into my son's case, Dr. Evans.",
        "Dr. Evans: Oh, call me Greg, please.",
        "Matthew: This may sound weird, but are you related to Destiny Evans?",
        "Greg: She's my sister.",
        "Matthew: Wow. Cool.",
        "Rachel: So, you're the hotshot who left home and never looked back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Okay, tell me what happened, little sister. How did you get fired from the country club?",
        "Destiny: I dumped a pitcher of water on that jerk weed from school -- Justin.",
        "Shaun: What for?",
        "Destiny: For dissing me, and for doing what he did to Matthew Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay, we're here. Hey, are you ready for your first ballet class? What's wrong, honey?",
        "Bree: I wish Chloe was here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Hey, Rex, it's me again. Look, you just -- you got in so late last night and you left so early this morning, I didn't even get to see you. So, I'm teaching my first class today and I just want you to know how much it means to me that you let me use your club. Maybe we can hook up later. Give me a call. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So, how does it feel, Lovett? Gigi's done with you. She used you like she used me.",
        "Schuyler: I'm telling you, Gigi never slept with me. She never slept with Kyle and she never slept with Brody.",
        "Natalie: Right, Gigi's pure as driven snow.",
        "Gigi: Okay, Schuyler, I --",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, you know what? You don't know everything.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, but Rex caught Gigi in the sack with Brody. She is just telling you more lies, just like she told lies to Rex, because she's trying to make herself look like she's not as big of a slut as she really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: Are we ever going to get to dance?",
        "Second Girl: Yeah, are we?",
        "Stacy: Oh, all righty then. Who wants to be a ballerina?",
        "Girls: I do, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I can't believe Markko's mom got it. I mean, she actually understands that Markko and I didn't just do it to do it. We really love each other.",
        "Dorian: Of course she understands that. It's written on both your faces.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but -- I mean, I've met her before and she's always been really nice, but today I felt like she was rooting for us, like she was on our side.",
        "Dorian: I had the same feeling, too.",
        "Langston: You were right. Inviting her here alone was definitely the way to go.",
        "Dorian: Oh, without Ernesto -- es verdad. Oh, claro. Please, testosterone gets in the way of clear thinking. Yes. It's not about conflict resolution. But having Aurelia here, I thought she clearly saw the truth.",
        "Langston: I just hope it works.",
        "Dorian: It's going to work. Oh, yes, I think she is prepared to fight this ban against you and Markko. I imagine she's doing battle right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ernesto: My son will never ever see Langston again.",
        "Markko: No, just -- wait, wait, wait. Ma just had T\u00e9a with Dr. Lord and \u0096",
        "Aurelia: Ernesto, Dr. Lord is a lovely woman. What is wrong with you?",
        "Ernesto: There is nothing wrong with me. It's Dr. Lord who destroys the lives of everyone she knows, including her daughter who is corrupted and who clearly has corrupted our son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: It was a sweet job, though. I mean, how many jobs are that easy with mad tips?",
        "Shaun: Not that many.",
        "Destiny: I hate being broke in the summer.",
        "Shaun: You'll get another gig.",
        "Destiny: You know, it sucks to be fired. But I'm not sorry I stood up to those morons.",
        "Shaun: I feel you. I did the same thing, and I got axed for it, too.",
        "Destiny: Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Sweetheart, why don't you let me give you a refill, and in the meantime, why don't you call Markko and see if his mother has worked her magic.",
        "Langston: Mr. Rivera ran over his cell phone, remember? On purpose, to keep Markko from calling me and me from reaching him.",
        "Dorian: You know, people used to find a way of contacting each other before cell phones were invented. And please remember that you are the Cramer woman in this equation. Just find a way. I'll just bet that you're going to find that Mr. Rivera is going to be far less resistant from now on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ernesto: You will not believe what I heard about Dr. Lord.",
        "Waitress: Markko, take out order.",
        "Markko: Look, Papi, Langston and Dr. Lord are two separate people.",
        "Ernesto: Langston lives under this woman's influence. This is a vain, selfish shrew of a woman who will stoop to --",
        "Markko: Okay, that's harsh.",
        "Ernesto: Well, speak to the people this woman has harmed, as I have. Obviously, she passed her lack of morality on to Langston, who in turn, corrupted you.",
        "Markko: Stop saying that. Look, Langston didn't corrupt me any more than I corrupted her.",
        "Ernesto: You never lied to us before you met this girl.",
        "Markko: I was never in love before.",
        "Waitress: Today, Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Yeah, what do you want to order?",
        "Langston: I'll have an order of you with you on the side.",
        "Markko: Hey.",
        "Langston: Dorian and I worked a miracle on your mom today, and she's on our side now. I'll bet your dad eases up on you, too.",
        "Markko: Langston, we have a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi's with Schuyler Joplin now. What, you didn't know? Kind of like how I didn't know she was with you until I walked in on the two of you in bed together. Hey, maybe we can bond. I -- I really love you, man.",
        "Brody: You done?",
        "Rex: For now.",
        "Brody: Good, because now it's my turn to tell you something you don't know.",
        "Rex: I'm all ears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh, honey, I miss Chloe, too. Do you remember how she smiled when you danced for her? Remember how much she loved that, huh?",
        "Stacy: All right, my little prima donnas, let's go over to the mats and start with some tumbling.",
        "Jessica: Sorry, we're late.",
        "Stacy: Hi, welcome to my school of dance.",
        "Jessica: Go ahead, Bree. I'm Jessica Buchanan.",
        "Stacy: Stacy Morasco.",
        "Jessica: Gigi's sister Stacy? The one that wouldn't help Shane unless Gigi broke up with Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: There is so much about this you don't know.",
        "[Natalie scoffs]",
        "Jared: Yeah, well, if that's true, why won't Gigi just tell us what that is?",
        "Jared: Because she thinks she can't.",
        "Natalie: Yes, well, I wouldn't cross the street for Gigi, much less drop the blackmail charges against Kyle Lewis for her, so --",
        "Jared: What do you say we get out of here?",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, tell them. Tell them.",
        "Gigi: Wait.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Gigi: What if I told you that dropping the charges against Kyle was a life and death matter, that I'm trying to save my son's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, if this is the gory details, or how and why you did my ex, I'm not really --",
        "Brody: Do you really think Gigi hopped from your bed to my bed to whoever this guy is you're talking about? The same girl that waited 10 years for you without ever once being with another guy?",
        "Rex: All I have is Gigi's word about that.",
        "Brody: And you think she'd pick now to sleep around on you? Does that make any sense to you?",
        "Rex: No, it's completely messed up, but it's what happened. I saw it.",
        "Brody: Well, sometimes the things you think you see --",
        "Rex: No, no, do not give me that bull. Gigi admitted it. See, she slept with you because she was mad at me. She used you and has moved on to somebody else. Deal with it, or keep believing in saint Gigi, I don't give a damn. Just stay the hell out of my way.",
        "Brody: After everything you guys have been through, this is what you think of her?",
        "Rex: She ripped my heart out.",
        "Brody: Rex, you --",
        "Rex: Hey, it's done. It's over. It's like what Stacy said.",
        "Brody: You listen to Stacy?",
        "Rex: How many times do I need to be punched in the face by reality before I get it? Gigi is not who I thought she was.",
        "Brody: Did you ever think there might just be another explanation?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You're right; the truth is the only thing I have left.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I know it's a risk, but it's worth it if it means getting them to understand why you need this favor so badly.",
        "Natalie: Truth from you? I'd love to hear what that sounds like.",
        "Gigi: Natalie, I love your brother. I have never stopped loving him and I never will.",
        "Natalie: Cheating on him while his son is fighting cancer, is that the way you show love? Because if it is, I -- I'd hate to see --",
        "Jared: Sparky.",
        "Schuyler: Tell them. It's okay.",
        "Gigi: My sister forced me to give Rex up.",
        "Jared: Forced you. How?",
        "Gigi: She refused to give Shane the stem cells that saved his life unless I gave Rex up.",
        "Jared: You're kidding.",
        "Schuyler: She's been obsessed with Rex since they were in, like, high school.",
        "Gigi: And I didn't have any idea about that. And all of a sudden, my son's life is on the line, and he needed a transplant as soon as possible, and the one donor we got from the registry fell through.",
        "Schuyler: And Stacy said she was a match.",
        "Gigi: And she made it real clear that she would only donate under one condition.",
        "Jared: That you broke up with Rex.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, Stacy told me to my face that she wouldn't lift a finger to save my son's life unless she was sure that I had broken up with Rex.",
        "Natalie: That's -- hey, but couldn't you have --",
        "Gigi: Have faked it? My sister is not an idiot. Not when it comes to men. And she was watching Rex like a hawk. Any fake-out, she would have smelled it from a mile away. I had no choice. I had to make Rex believe that it was over between us or she would have let Shane die. So I fixed it so that Rex would walk in on Brody and me. I was pretending to have an affair so I could -- so I could break Rex's heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You know, Gigi kept saying that I don't understand, that someday she'd explain it to me. But how am I supposed to wrap my head around the fact that the woman I love stepped out on me while our son was fighting for his life? What am I supposed to do?",
        "Brody: You're supposed to trust the woman you love.",
        "Rex: Oh, give me a break. It is all I can do to not shove your face through that wall, you son-of-a-bitch.",
        "Brody: Well, there is another explanation.",
        "Rex: Then, dammit, explain it to me.",
        "Brody: I can't, but she has her reasons, okay? Just trust her.",
        "Rex: You can take your advice and shove it. There's only one person I trust anymore, and that is Stacy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jessica: You can save it. Brody told me all about you.",
        "Stacy: Really? Well, the newspaper told me all about you.",
        "Jessica: I didn't know you were teaching this class. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. Do you have any idea how much suffering you've caused? All because you wanted Rex.",
        "Stacy: Excuse me, the suffering I've caused?",
        "Jessica: Shh.",
        "Stacy: I didn't lock my sister in the basement and I sure didn't try to blow up her and her boyfriend and I didn't steal someone else's baby. You took whatever you wanted and you didn't care who you hurt, so who the hell are you to judge me?",
        "Jessica: I was mentally ill. What's your excuse?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Got it, yeah. House salad, one omelet, and fries -- well done.",
        "Langston: Is your dad there?",
        "Markko: Yes, uh, yeah, dressing on the side. Sure, we can do that.",
        "Langston: What happened? Your mom was totally on our side.",
        "Markko: Sure, we'll get that to you ASAP. I've got to make a delivery.",
        "Ernesto: Where to?",
        "Markko: Across town. Are you going to follow me there, too?",
        "Ernesto: I might.",
        "Aurelia: Ernesto, let our boy do his job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Destiny slurps drink]",
        "Destiny: He won't stop calling me \"Density,\" and then he throws a quarter on the ground for me to pick up like a dog.",
        "Shaun: The manager let that maggot do that to you?",
        "Destiny: He wasn't even trying to hear my side. \"The member's always right,\" right?",
        "Shaun: Did they at least pay you for the work that you put in this week?",
        "Destiny: I didn't even get to collect my tips. But getting bounced just proves what I already know. I'm a loser.",
        "Shaun: Stop that. No, you're not.",
        "Destiny: The kids at school hate me. Matt just thinks of me as a good friend, and our brother's never going to come to Llanview just because I asked him to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: You must have been talking to my brother Shaun.",
        "Rachel: Maybe.",
        "Greg: Well, there are two sides to every story. And I'm sure you'll hear mine someday. But right now my family's dirty laundry is irrelevant.",
        "Clint: Well, I certainly agree with that. And here, as promised, Doctor, your consulting fee.",
        "Greg: Let's just focus on the patient for right now, shall we? Now, I've looked over his record \u0096",
        "Rachel: Matthew. My brother's name is Matthew.",
        "Greg: I've looked over Matthew's records and films. Of course, I'll need to examine him myself. But I do know enough to be able to give an informed opinion.",
        "Nora: And what do you think?",
        "Bo: Can you help our son?",
        "Greg: I can absolutely help your son.",
        "Bo: You're sure?",
        "Greg: Well, given the nature of Matthew's injury, I'm very confident.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. That's fantastic. Isn't that fantastic?",
        "Rachel: I don't understand. No other doctor has been as optimistic as you are.",
        "Greg: Well, they were wrong. Matthew's spinal cord was compressed, but it wasn't severed.",
        "Rachel: But Matthew's regained no sensation from the point of his injury since the accident.",
        "Greg: As I said, I've reviewed the case.",
        "Rachel: All of the other doctors have told us that if a person doesn't regain feeling within 24 hours, it's highly unlikely --",
        "Greg: Highly unlikely isn't the same as never. Now, what I'd like to do is \u0096",
        "Rachel: Is your optimism based on reality or the size of that check?",
        "Nora: Rachel.",
        "Greg: Did I hear you say you were a doctor?",
        "Rachel: This is my family. I'm trying to protect them.",
        "Destiny: Oh, my God, it's you.",
        "Greg: Hey.",
        "Destiny: It's really you.",
        "Greg: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I really wish Dr. Lord hadn't fired Shaun. He could have given me a heads up if my dad was following me. And this was the only way I could get my dad off my back. I missed you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, Markko. I'm so glad you're here. And this gives me the chance to apologize to you in person. I really am sorry that I did not know that your parents were unaware that you and Langston had decided to move your relationship to the next level. Obviously, not everybody has as open and honest a relationship as Langston and I do. But I've done everything I could to make up for that and, obviously, it worked because you're here, right? Your father has decided to back off this ridiculous stand that he took about you not seeing Langston.",
        "Markko: No, no, Llanview's grapevine got to him first.",
        "Dorian: What does that mean?",
        "Markko: He heard about what you did after the grad party. Firing everybody and giving Moe your house and then taking it back and something about drugging some alcoholic guy.",
        "Dorian: Those have to be the -- the vindictive ramblings of Viki Davidson. Oh, my goodness. You know, I could give your father an earful about Viki and her daughter and their multiple personalities and this little tendency they have to steal babies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: My husband died in an accident and I had a breakdown. And you're right, I caused more heartbreak and grief than anyone, but I paid the price. Not only did I lose my husband, I lost our baby girl.",
        "Stacy: And you're telling me this, why?",
        "Jessica: Rex and Gigi love each other.",
        "Stacy: Loved. It's past tense.",
        "Jessica: Well, they're going to find their way back to one another and the truth is going to come out about you. And when it does, you're going to end up with nothing.",
        "Stacy: You know what? I really have a class to teach.",
        "Jessica: You shouldn't be allowed anywhere near children.",
        "Stacy: No, honey, that's you.",
        "Jessica: Bree, come on, sweetie. Let's go to the community center.",
        "Girl: Are we ever going to get to dance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I had no idea what you were dealing with.",
        "Jared: Oh, we owe you a major apology.",
        "Gigi: No, you don't. I'm the one who's been trying to convince everyone I'm the town pump.",
        "Jared: This is nuts.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I had to make Rex believe it so he wouldn't get on to Stacy. I mean, he's not a stupid guy. He's a P.I., for God's sake, so I -- I had to fix it so Rex would see it with his own eyes. Brody was there. He loves Shane, so he went along with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You -- you trust Stacy, are you kidding me?",
        "Rex: Look, I've already gotten this advice before from someone who means a hell of a lot more to me than you.",
        "Brody: Then -- then listen to that person, okay? I mean, the last person you need to be listening to is Stacy Morasco.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Brody: I -- I can't tell you without breaking Gigi's confidence.",
        "Rex: Screw Gigi's confidence and screw you.",
        "Brody: Hate me all you want, but if you don't wait for Gigi, if you hook up with Stacy, you're going to wreck Gigi and yourself, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Well, Jared and I have a lot of experience in the secret-keeping business.",
        "Jared: It never really seems to work out too well.",
        "Gigi: I swear, though, I am this close to being able to blow this secret up and tell Rex the truth.",
        "Jared: How? What's changed?",
        "Schuyler: Well, first of all, Stacy's my ex.",
        "Jared: Who exactly are you?",
        "Schuyler: My name is Schuyler Joplin. I'm from Llanview, actually, but I -- I moved out and I went to live in Las Vegas for a little while and that's where I met Stacy. But, anyway, I came back here and that's where I ran into her and so I let her stay with me for a little while.",
        "Gigi: After I kicked her out because she came on to Rex.",
        "Schuyler: Right, yeah, and so when she told me that she was a match for Shane, I was like, \"oh, my God, that's a miracle.\" Because usually a parent's sibling is never a match.",
        "Jared: How do you know that?",
        "Schuyler: I'm a -- I'm a biology teacher. I was a biology teacher. It's -- it's irrelevant. It was too good to be true, okay? She was never a match for Shane.",
        "Natalie: Excuse me?",
        "Schuyler: Stacy switched her stem cells with somebody who was actually a match.",
        "Jared: Are you kidding?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I wish I was. No, I -- I have proof.",
        "Gigi: We went to a lab, took Shane and Stacy's DNA samples. There's no way.",
        "Natalie: Then what are you waiting for? Blow this psycho sister of yours out of the water.",
        "Gigi: I can't, not yet. She'd bolt.",
        "Natalie: Say good riddance.",
        "Gigi: All right, but what if Shane needs more of those stem cells? Stacy could be the only person who could get us to the real donor. So I can't lower the boom on her, yet.",
        "Jared: Time-out. Where does Kyle Lewis fit in?",
        "Gigi: He knows who the real donor is. And he won't tell me unless I can convince you to drop the charges against him. I know he's scum. I know that he deserves to be in jail for what he did to you guys. But I'm asking, I'm begging, really. Will you help me save my son's life? Will you help me find my way back to Rex?",
        "Jared: You're sure there's no one else that knows who the real donor is?",
        "Gigi: I think Roxy does.",
        "Natalie: Roxy?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. And I think Stacy's blackmailing her, too.",
        "Natalie: About what?",
        "Gigi: I don't know, but Roxy was in here knocking back vodka like she was real upset. And she clammed up fast when I tried to talk to her about it. I couldn't get her to budge.",
        "Natalie: I'll bet. I mean, Roxy's got a big mouth, but when she decides she's keeping a secret, forget about it. I mean, look how long she's refused to tell anyone who Rex's biological father is.",
        "Jared: She knows that Shane's life is at stake.",
        "Gigi: Yes. Her own grandson. I told her everything.",
        "Natalie: Well, if you told her all of that and she still won't talk, I hate to say it, but there is nothing I can say that will get it out of her.",
        "Schuyler: Right. Which makes Kyle our only option.",
        "Jared: No. There is one other option.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex. Rex's voice: Look, you're just not who I thought you were. You've been doing some really crazy things.",
        "Gigi's voice: And pretty soon, I'll explain all of that to you.",
        "Rex: Gigi said that someday I would understand what happened, like it would ever make sense that she cheated.",
        "Stacy: Maybe she just didn't want to hurt your feelings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: Stacy? Miss Stacy?",
        "Rex: I've got some bookkeeping to finish this week. End of the fiscal year kind of stuff.",
        "Stacy: Okay, well, I'll go with you.",
        "Rex: I won't have time. You should just go home.",
        "Stacy: How about I have some chicken parm waiting?",
        "Rex: No, I'll be late. Don't wait up.",
        "Girl: Miss Stacy's a big, fat liar.",
        "Second Girl: She's never going to teach us ballet.",
        "Third Girl: She probably doesn't even know how to dance.",
        "Stacy: Okay, shut up. All right? You want to learn something? Learn this. You come in here in your frilly tutus and your brand-new little pink shoes, and you think you're going to end up in \"The Nutcracker\" in Lincoln center? Yeah, that's not going to happen. You're going to end up on a pole, stripping for some sleazy creeps in Vegas, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Do not despair, Markko. I'm going to find a way to tell your father my side of all that vicious gossip.",
        "Langston: What side? It's not gossip, Dorian. You did all those things.",
        "Dorian: Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.",
        "Langston: Oh, please.",
        "Markko: Look, that's definitely not an argument you want to use with my dad.",
        "Dorian: My point just is that all of us have made mistakes, but that does not negate all the good we've done. I am a very, very loyal, generous to a fault person. And it's just a matter of getting Markko's father to see that.",
        "Langston: Um, how?",
        "Dorian: Look at how well our morning meeting with Markko's mother went. We just have to do the same thing with his father.",
        "Markko: My father's heard too much gossip about you. He's not coming within two miles of this place unless it's to drag me out of here.",
        "Dorian: Well, then. The mountain will have to go to Mohammad.",
        "Langston: Okay, now I'm scared.",
        "Dorian: Your father thinks I've wounded so many people? All right. I will just invite all of those people over here. Moe and Noelle. Charlie and Viki. Yes, and Shaun, too. He adores me. He's going to be the easiest one of all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I can't believe you're really here. You look great, by the way. And you don't have to say it, I know I look fierce. But how come you never called or e-mailed to say you were coming? I was supposed to set up this meeting between you and Matthew. How did you find him anyway? This is my big brother. I didn't say anything about him because I wasn't sure he'd come. But he did.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it's great.",
        "Destiny: He's the bomb. Greg's worked on all kinds of famous people. And he's in a bunch of medical magazines. But I don't get it. How'd this meeting happen without me arranging it?",
        "Nora: You know, it doesn't really matter, sweetheart.",
        "Destiny: Yeah, it kind of does.",
        "Shaun: I don't think Greg came here because you asked him to. I think it has something to do with that check that's on the table, with a dose of the Buchanan's fame and fortune thrown in.",
        "Destiny: Is that true? You're not here because I asked you to come?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I intend to charm the pants off your father -- figuratively speaking. I will prepare a meal meticulously myself that will -- that will overwhelm the senses with delight. They'll see how much I care, and they will forgive my transgressions.",
        "Langston: And how do you expect to get all those people to come over here after what you did to them?",
        "Markko: Look, no offense, but I don't see how it's going to happen. I mean, why -- why would these people go to bat for you?",
        "Dorian: Oh, they won't. They'll go to bat for the two of you. Trust me on this. You get your mother and father to come here. I'll do the rest. And I'll start with Shaun. Because when he says yes, all the rest will follow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: If you have proof that Stacy's not the real donor, why not just go straight to Rex?",
        "Gigi: Can't. My God, she has wormed her way into living with Rex. If he found out what Stacy has done, he would kick her out so fast, she wouldn't know what hit her.",
        "Natalie: I can get behind that.",
        "Gigi: So could I. I mean, I would love for Stacy to be out of all of our lives, but she's still holding all the cards. As long as she knows who the real donor is and I don't --",
        "Natalie: Do you really think that Stacy would refuse to help your son again?",
        "Gigi: As much as Stacy claims to love Rex, if she lost him, she would absolutely burn him. She would never tell him who the donor is, even if that meant Shane could die.",
        "Jared: I just can't believe this.",
        "Gigi: I can. Shane was in serious trouble. And she waited until the last minute, until she was sure that Rex and I were done before she donated.",
        "Jared: Who thinks like this?",
        "Gigi: My sister. And I need to know the name of the real donor before what I told you gets out.",
        "Schuyler: So, guys, I mean, it's up to you. Will you drop the charges against Kyle, just so we can find out what we need to know from him?",
        "Natalie: We'll do anything to help you and Rex and Shane, but we can't. We just can't keep another secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It feels good to not have to pretend that we're not seeing each other.",
        "Brody: Hey, lady. How was your dance class?",
        "Bree: They were full.",
        "Brody: Oh, really? That's too bad.",
        "Jessica: Sweetie, why don't you go in the kitchen and see if Carlotta has a cookie for you? Okay?",
        "Bree: Okay.",
        "Jessica: The real story is Stacy Morasco's the dance teacher.",
        "Brody: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, and I really kind of gave it to her. And she gave it to me right back.",
        "Brody: Well, whatever she said, you just forget it. Anyone who could refuse to help Shane unless his mom breaks up with his dad, that person's not playing with a full deck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You know, we start off with so many dreams, don't we? Don't we, girls? Yeah, and you think if you just work really hard and you smile pretty, you're going to get them. That's exactly what I did. I worked really, really hard. And I almost got what I've been wanting my whole life. I felt him wanting me when he put that suntan lotion on my body. We ran into the hot cabana and kissed. I had my dream. I had him. Then that snobby manager came and had us arrested. They bring us to the police station. His pseudo-dad's there -- the commissioner. If only you knew who his real dad was. Anyway, he says something, and then bam, it's over. Then there I am, climbing the walls, trying to figure out where I stand. And he doesn't even call me.",
        "Girl: I want to go home.",
        "Stacy: Did I let that get me down? No. We don't give up, do we, girls? Now, listen. You cannot give up when you're this close, not when you know he wants you. Everybody's going to try and tell you you can't do it. But if you work hard enough, you can. You could have all of your dreams. So just don't let anyone tell you you can't.",

        "Greg: Are you kidding me? You're absolutely responsible for my being here. You know, Clint Buchanan had been trying to reach me, but I sort of blew him off until I got your e-mail about Matthew and realized this was someone my little sister cared about.",
        "Bo: It seems we owe Destiny a big thanks.",
        "Nora: Yeah, from the bottom of our heart. Your brother has given us some hope.",
        "Destiny: You can help him, right?",
        "Greg: I'll do my very best to help your boyfriend.",
        "Destiny: He's not my boyfriend.",
        "Greg: Oh.",
        "Matthew: You did this for me, and you didn't tell me?",
        "Destiny: Yeah, it was supposed to be a surprise. From me.",
        "Shaun: Oh, it's a surprise, all right. Come on, little sis. Let's go get the money you're due.",
        "Destiny: Call me later?",

        "Matthew: Hey, Destiny. Thanks.",

        "Jared: Natalie and I were like you. We had a hundred reasons for keeping the secret that Jessica's baby was really dead and that Chloe belonged to someone else.",
        "Natalie: And we had reasons for keeping the other secrets that we kept, too.",
        "Jared: Yeah, like when I pretended to be a Buchanan. And like when we let Rex believe that Charlie was really his father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: That was nice, what you said to the girls earlier -- to follow their dreams.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, well --",
        "Rex: It was nice.",
        "Stacy: Look, did you happen to get my message, because I haven't seen or heard from you since the country club.",
        "Rex: Yeah, well, I've been avoiding you. I didn't know what to do.",
        "Stacy: About me?",
        "Rex: Yeah, everybody's trying to give me advice. You know, they're telling me that I should understand Gigi. I've got these voices in my head, Stacy.",
        "Stacy: Believe me, I've got the same thing. What are yours saying?",
        "Rex: Well, they're trying to tell me what I should do, what I should want.",
        "Stacy: And what do you want, Rex?",

        "Clint: Dr. Evans, there's a Buchanan wing on the hospital. So whatever you need, you name it.",
        "Greg: Will do.",
        "Bo: You know, Rachel's right. We didn't get just a second opinion; we got a whole bunch of them. And all the doctor's said the same thing. Matthew's injury is inoperable.",
        "Greg: Obviously, I need to do my own examination, but I honestly think I can help him.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. Is this really happening?",
        "Bo: Yep, it sure is. Rachel: If you play my family the way you played your little sister, you will be sorry you ever stepped foot back in your hometown.",

        "Shaun: I know you earned every penny of this.",
        "Destiny: Thanks.",
        "Shaun: My pleasure.",
        "Destiny: Shaun, Greg didn't come because I asked him to, did he?",
        "Shaun: He said he did.",
        "Destiny: Yeah, he said. Matthew's mom's right. It doesn't matter why he came. If he can help Matthew, then who cares whether it's me or the Buchanans who got him here? Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Oh, it feels like a hundred years since we've been alone together.",
        "Markko: I know.",

        "Markko: Look, I want to. I can't. I still have a few hours left on my shift.",
        "Langston: So tell them that you have car trouble.",
        "Markko: And what am I going to tell my dad? He's probably sending out a posse right now to come look for me.",

        "Langston: Has anybody answered yet?",
        "Dorian: Well, actually, I'm having a little trouble reaching people, but don't worry. They're going to come.",
        "Langston: Dorian, you have to pull this off. You have to get Markko's parents to let us see each other again.",
        "Dorian: For you, darling, I will do anything. I swear. Come on. Good girl.",

        "Brody: I ran into Rex today at the gym. He laid into me, too. But since I couldn't tell him the truth, I just had to take it.",
        "Jessica: Well, if anyone deserves to be punched out, it's Stacy. God, I hope that Gigi can tell Rex the truth soon. You know, she thinks that she's protecting Shane, but Natalie and Jared thought that they were protecting me, and --",
        "Brody: I know.",
        "Jessica: No. It wasn't right. It wasn't fair, and a lot of people got hurt.",
