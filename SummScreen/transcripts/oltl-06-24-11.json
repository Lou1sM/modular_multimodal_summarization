        "John does not want to let Jack get away with what he did and contacts Jack's friend Brad to interrogate him alone. Todd and Tea want to protect Jack from legal charges but can see that Jack has no remorse and nobody want to let him get away with what happened to Gigi. Todd manages to pull strings with Brad's father to get his son take the rap in order to spare Jack. Rex presents a \"proxy\" to Clint, Viki and Natalie that he tells them Gigi drew up with her lawyer that authorizes him power of attorney if something were to happen to her. And he says he refuses to let Clint have his heart. Natalie cries and urges her brother to reconsider if not for Clint, for her. Viki tells Rex he needs to honor what Gigi would have wanted. Bo also questions the validity that Rex could so conveniently prevent Clint from having a heart transplant. Matthew regains consciousness and is ready to tell his parents what happened. Nate is afraid that he will get in trouble if Bo or Nora find out what he did to Matthew. Starr finds out that Tomas' son is her new acquaintance who wants to \"educate\" her to a different type of music. Sam is talking to original Todd who hides from all the people who know him and asks Sam where he would find \"Todd Manning\"."

        "Sam: It's you!",
        "Dani: This is--",
        "Starr: Baz.",
        "Baz: Starr?",
        "Dani: Your mom told you about him? This is my cousin Baz.",
        "Starr: Your what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You remember that you hit your head? Matthew... can you tell me what happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: What's going on? Who was that guy that James and Ford just dragged out of here?",
        "Deanna: This guy I met when I lived at the motel. Rick. He knows, Nate. He heard us talking. He knows what you did to Matthew Buchanan.",
        "Nate: What? Who is this guy?",
        "Deanna: He thinks he's a film director. It doesn't matter. He was sitting by us at the Buenos Dias. He heard you say you put Matthew in the hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Did you fall? Or did something hit you?",
        "Matthew: No. No. Some...someone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: There's an eyewitness who puts you in the house where Gigi Morasco got carbon monoxide poisoning. Says you're behind the whole thing.",
        "Todd: He's bluffing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd.",
        "Todd: There's no witness. This is a big game to try to make--",
        "Jack: Brad? What the hell did you tell them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Does it feel different? Having someone else's heart?",
        "Viki: In your mind, at first, but the body adapts quickly. The thing is that you never forget that every day you get forward is a gift.",
        "Natalie: Hey. Joey's with Jess at the doctor, and as soon as she's done, they'll be here.",
        "Viki: Good, because they're going to be prepping your father for the transplant shortly.",
        "Rex: No, they won't. Surgery's off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Hey, Sam. How's it going?",
        "Sam: Did you get rid of the dead guy?",
        "Old Todd: Yeah. He's pushing up what I think are geraniums.",
        "Sam: Good. He shouldn't have tried to shoot you.",
        "Old Todd: You didn't tell anybody about that, did you?",
        "Sam: No. You told me not to.",
        "Old Todd: Thanks, Sam. You're a good friend.",
        "Sam: Are you hungry?",
        "Old Todd: Sure. Thanks. I gotta ask you a question, ok? It's about your dad. About Todd Manning?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I didn't say anything.",
        "John: Yeah, yeah. Put him in interview room 2, will ya?",
        "Todd: It's a bluff.",
        "T\u00e9a: Detective, if there's a statement, we're entitled to see it.",
        "John: Absolutely, all right? But I think Jack knows what Brad's gonna say, so--",
        "T\u00e9a: So if you have an offer to make--",
        "Todd: He doesn't need an offer. John, stop bullying my son.",
        "John: Your kid is the bully, Manning. Everybody up at the high school knows it, don't they, Jack? We got people up there right now taking statements. Those kids, they think you're a jerk, man. You really think they're gonna lie for you now?",
        "T\u00e9a: John, this is harassment.",
        "John: You really think they're gonna protect you anymore and be afraid of you? They're not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did you hear what I said?",
        "John: I heard you the first time, all right? You might want to ask your lawyer one thing, all right? Ask her how they treat bullies in court. I don't think they like them very much. You think you're a tough guy, Jack? I promise you you're not. No matter what happens with all this, you're about to come up against something a hell of a lot tougher.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I just told Gigi's doctor. They're probably telling yours right now.",
        "Natalie: Rex?",
        "Rex: I'm not gonna let them cut open Gigi just to save your miserable life.",
        "Clint: This is not up to you.",
        "Rex: Yes, it is. This is Gigi's health care proxy. She gave me the power to make all of her medical decisions for her, even if she couldn't, and I've decided you're not getting her heart.",
        "Clint: That proxy just appeared out of thin air?",
        "Rex: Gigi had it done before the wedding. Her lawyer just sent it.",
        "Natalie: Rex, think about it.",
        "Rex: I'm done.",
        "Clint: Wait.",
        "Rex: Forget it, old man. For once your money and power can't save you. There's nothing you can do to change this.",
        "Clint: I know. Let me say something to you-- father to son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Baz is your cousin?",
        "Dani: Yeah. He's Uncle Tom\u00e1s' son.",
        "Starr: My mom told me that Tom\u00e1s just found out that he has a son. You're Sebastian?",
        "Baz: It's Baz. Your mom's Blair. She told me about you, too.",
        "Starr: This is too weird.",
        "Dani: I can't believe you guys already know each other.",
        "Starr: Yeah. We met at the student union at L.U.",
        "Dani: You were already in town?",
        "Baz: Yeah. I heard my dad was crashing in Llanview, so I thought I'd check it out before I got dumped here.",
        "Starr: And now you're just checking out a high school graduation?",
        "Baz: Why not?",
        "Dani: He was totally desperate to get out of the house. Oh, I gotta go find Nate. Can you hang with Baz for a little while? Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I should've turned myself in when this happened. It would've been the right thing to do.",
        "Deanna: Don't start this again, Nate, ok? I didn't make sense then, and it doesn't now.",
        "Nate: Matthew is getting better, and he could remember, and now there's somebody else that knows. It's gonna get out.",
        "Deanna: No, Nate. What happened to Matthew was a freak accident. You shouldn't have to pay for it, and you won't. Rick hasn't told anyone.",
        "Nate: Yet.",
        "Deanna: He did say he'd go to Matthew's parents.",
        "Nate: Yeah, yeah--the D.A. and the commissioner, who are gonna be more than happy to put away the guy who almost killed their son. Why does this guy Rick want me in jail?",
        "Deanna: He doesn't. He's just using this information to get what he wants. After that, he'll keep his mouth shut.",
        "Nate: So, what does he want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Did someone hit you or make you fall and hit your head?",
        "Nate: You killed my father, you son of a bitch!",
        "Bo: Son, can you tell me who hurt you? Who did this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I am broke. If Rick wants blackmail money, I can't pay it, so...",
        "Deanna: He doesn't want money. He wants--",
        "Dani: Nate! Hey. What's up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, it's ok. It's ok. Don't worry. We don't have to do this now. You got plenty of time.",
        "Matthew: He knew.",
        "Bo: Who knew? Who knew what?",
        "Matthew: Eddie.",
        "Bo: Eddie? Eddie Ford? It's ok, Matthew. I need a doctor in here now!",
        "Nora: I found Dr. Pryor. David said that-- my God. What's going on?",
        "Dr. Pryor: Could you two please wait outside while I examine him?",
        "Bo: We'll be right outside.",
        "Nora: Bo, are you sure he understood you?",
        "Bo: I'm positive. He was answering questions.",
        "Nora: He responded?",
        "Bo: Yes.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. What is it?",
        "Bo: He was trying to figure out what had happened to him. He asked me how he got here.",
        "Nora: That makes sense. Bo, this is a miracle.",
        "Bo: I'm just worried that I was pushing him too hard, but he wanted to tell me something.",
        "Nora: What did he say?",
        "Bo: Someone hurt him.",
        "Nora: He said that?",
        "Bo: He said that someone caused his injury.",
        "Nora: Who?",
        "Bo: I don't know. That's when he started having trouble. And the only thing that he could get out was \"Eddie.\"",
        "Nora: Eddie? Eddie Ford? He's been dead for months. This just happened.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Nora: Maybe he--oh, God. Maybe he remembers about what happened with Eddie, and he's feeling guilty.",
        "Bo: Maybe.",
        "Nora: You think it's something else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Deanna was just congratulating me.",
        "Deanna: Yeah. Graduating with honors. That's something.",
        "Dani: Yeah, it is. I got you a graduation present. Do you mind if we have a minute alone?",
        "Deanna: Yeah. I'll go find a seat. See you later.",
        "Dani: Are you ok?",
        "Nate: Yeah, I just wish this was over.",
        "Dani: What? Graduation? I mean, yeah, the ceremony will probably be lame, but it's graduation! You've got so much to be proud of.",
        "Nate: Not really.",
        "Dani: Not really? Come on. Nate, you were president of the film club, you made the Honor Society, and that's after transferring over in the middle of junior year. And you dealt with all that craziness with your dad.",
        "Nate: You sound like you're running for president of my fan club.",
        "Dani: I already am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baz: If you're Dani's sister, right, and I'm her cousin, that makes me...",
        "Starr: The same jerk that erased my music last week and replaced it with his own tracks.",
        "Baz: Did you delete my stuff?",
        "Starr: No. And we're not related.",
        "Baz: Good.",
        "Starr: Is it?",
        "Baz: Yeah. You know, I mean, it's just impressive. I wouldn't have been able to do all that math in my head. I would've needed a diagram.",
        "Starr: This is so random. I meet you a week ago and now you're living at my dad's? I thought I would never see you again.",
        "Baz: Now it looks like we'll be seeing each other a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It doesn't matter what anyone says about Jack at the high school, right? That's got nothing to do with this case.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd is correct. Unless one of the kids at Jack's school saw him at the scene of Gigi's accident...",
        "John: Well, let's go see what Brad has to say. If you need anything, there's an officer right outside the door.",
        "Todd: In case we want to order a pizza? Nice defense, Counselor.",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you think it would gain us by provoking Detective McBain? If I'm gonna defend you, I need to know everything, ok? What could Brad possibly say, huh?",
        "Jack: That it was all my idea. He's gonna put me in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Father to son? That's a bunch of--",
        "Clint: Wait. Wait. Viki was just telling me that once you get a heart, you never take another day for granted. That's especially true when you don't have many days left. I was a fool to have wasted so much time. I can see that now.",
        "Rex: What's your point?",
        "Clint: I wish that there was more time to make things right for you, so you could have the father that you deserve.",
        "Rex: You're saying that's what would happen? You'd welcome me home with open arms and slap a cowboy hat on me and say I was a chip off the ol' block?",
        "Clint: You are my son.",
        "Rex: Yesterday, I was a piece of garbage. You were lying here, half-dead already, and you still couldn't wish me well on my wedding day. And now you're asking me to give you Gigi's heart. You'll say anything. I don't blame you. Gigi was an amazing person with an amazing heart, but you never saw her like that. You just saw her as a bargaining chip, another person you could use. You never cared about her. How many times did you threaten to ruin her life just so you could keep me in line?",
        "Clint: That was wrong.",
        "Rex: Take it up with your next stop. Maybe God can forgive you. I sure as hell won't.",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint.",
        "Natalie: Rex.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Natalie: Look, I understand how you feel about him, especially with the way he's treated you. I get it. But I'm not ready to lose my father.",
        "Rex: Natalie...",
        "Natalie: He'll die without that transplant. So if you won't do it for him, please... please do it for me.",
        "Rex: Don't ask me.",
        "Natalie: I shouldn't. But I am.",
        "Rex: Natty, the guy's a bastard, ok? I'm not gonna let them cut open Gigi just to keep Clint Buchanan breathing.",
        "Natalie: She's gone, Rex. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I wish it wasn't true. But that is not Gigi lying in that bed. Not-- not really. Everything that made her that incredible person that you loved is gone.",
        "Rex: She'll never be gone to me.",
        "Natalie: I know. But she's never coming back. And letting Dad die is not gonna change that.",
        "Rex: Maybe not, but it still feels like justice to me.",
        "Natalie: How can you say that?",
        "Rex: It's been that kind of week.",
        "Natalie: You know what? Ok, Rex, forget about Dad. It's me. I'm your sister. I --I've always looked out for you. I've always had your back.",
        "Rex: That is not fair.",
        "Natalie: No. No, it's not fair. I wish I could make this fair. I wish more than anything I could bring Gigi back, but I can't, and I don't have any other choice.",
        "Rex: Guess it's a good thing I do.",
        "Viki: Natalie... would you go be with your father, please?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I guess I should. While he has some time left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baz: Were you listening to my music? I saw you when I came in. That looked like my beat.",
        "Starr: You did put my music back on there.",
        "Baz: Yeah, but you don't seem like the type that was listening to Justin Bieber.",
        "Starr: Uh, no. I wasn't. His music is much too sophisticated for my musical taste.",
        "Baz: It's not that bad. Are you really a singer?",
        "Starr: Where'd you hear that?",
        "Baz: Dani says you're awesome.",
        "Starr: I don't know. Don't flatter me.",
        "Baz: Let's find out. Your mom said that I could use the equipment at her club.",
        "Starr: She did? Yeah. She told me that. I told you that it wasn't really your audience.",
        "Baz: It's just for practice. But who knows--they might surprise me. And I have a track that needs vocals. Ha ha! You were listening to my song.",
        "Starr: Oh, great. Now you're stealing my player again.",
        "Baz: Here. Try this one. It's this whole new sound landscape. It's way better. What do you think?",
        "[Music playing through earbuds]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Oh--whoa. Dani.",
        "Dani: Is it the right one?",
        "Nate: The one that I've been lusting after online for 6 months? Yes. This is the one.",
        "Dani: Ah! Ok, good.",
        "Nate: This is awesome, but it's too much.",
        "Dani: Don't say that, ok? I wanted to. Hey, let's get a picture together in your cap and gown before everything starts. Let me see. Ok, we're taking another one.",
        "Nate: No good?",
        "Dani: Come on. That looks like your mug shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Just before Matthew collapsed, he said that someone else knew that he shot Eddie. Now, do you remember?",
        "Nora: Yeah. You think that's who hurt him?",
        "Bo: That was on his mind. And it seems like that he found out just before he got hurt.",
        "Nora: So just now, when you think he was trying to tell you who hurt him, and the only word he could get out was \"Eddie\"?",
        "Bo: I wish I'd gone easier on him. Then maybe he wouldn't--",
        "Nora: No, no, no. This is good news. He's communicating with us. My God, a week ago, we were talking about his--the end of his life, and now?",
        "Bo: Our son's on his way back.",
        "Nora: Yeah! Ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Just don't say anything, ok? I know you're on Clint's side.",
        "Viki: I'm actually thinking about Gigi right now. And you should be, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Can I get you anything else? Tuna fish sandwich? Maybe a cup of coffee?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "John: So you want to tell me what went down in that house?",
        "Brad: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "John: You don't know what I'm talking about. Let's go over it. Gigi Morasco was found in a house that your family owns. There's a string of e-mail messages sent from your computer to Shane Morasco, and that's what got her to the house. Comicgurl15's profile was created on your account.",
        "Brad: I didn't do that. I didn't do anything.",
        "John: Really? Because that's what Jack said.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're not going to prison.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'll give you the best defense I can.",
        "Todd: That's real encouraging.",
        "Man: Excuse me.",
        "Jack: That's Brad's dad.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: I got a call that my son is here. Brad Kozinski.",
        "Cop: Down the hall.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Was this serious? Because I'm meeting with my bank. They're gonna foreclose.",
        "Cop: It is serious, sir. Interrogation 2--down the hall. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Be right back.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey. Where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: What time does your dad get home?",
        "Sam: Maybe now.",
        "Old Todd: Your dad's here now?",
        "Sam: No. My dad's not married to my mom.",
        "Old Todd: Blair? You mean Blair?",
        "Sam: Yeah, but I don't call her that. I call her Mom.",
        "Old Todd: Right. Sorry. Sometimes I get a little confused in my head.",
        "Sam: That's all right.",
        "Old Todd: So where does your dad live?",
        "Sam: With my stepmom.",
        "Old Todd: You have a stepmom?",
        "Sam: Yeah. T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Pryor: It looks like Matthew got a little overloaded.",
        "Nora: Did he say anything?",
        "Dr. Pryor: Yes. Matthew's communicating, which in itself is remarkable.",
        "Bo: He understands, doesn't he?",
        "Dr. Pryor: He does, and he wants to speak, but every word takes a lot of effort.",
        "Bo: We won't push him.",
        "Dr. Pryor: Right now we don't want to frustrate him.",
        "Nora: We'll be patient.",
        "Dr. Pryor: Good. We have a long road ahead. He'll have to do a lot of rehab.",
        "Nora: Can I see him? I won't push him. I promise I won't. I just--if he says anything, I really want to be there to hear it.",
        "Dr. Pryor: I gave him a sedative. He was pretty agitated. He's going to be sleeping for a while.",
        "Bo: Will he be clearer when he wakes up?",
        "Dr. Pryor: We'll have to wait and see. Excuse me.",

        "James: What's up?",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "James: Hi.",
        "Starr: James, this is Baz. Baz, this is my boyfriend James.",
        "James: Good to meet you. Nice hat.",
        "Baz: Yeah.",
        "Starr: This is that guy. Remember? I told you that I met him at L.U.",
        "James: The one who wiped out all your music?",
        "Baz: Guilty, but not sorry.",
        "James: Oh, really? You are exactly the way she described you. I'd know you anywhere.",
        "Baz: I'm glad I leave an impression.",
        "Starr: Baz is living here now.",
        "James: Really? I thought that you were just visiting or something. Starr even said that she didn't think she'd ever see you again.",
        "Baz: Neither did I, but now we're totally connected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What did Jack say?",
        "John: Jack said that you came up with the whole plan, that you set up the online identity, that you sent the messages to Shane, that you picked the place to try and trap him.",
        "Brad: That's not true.",
        "John: That's not true? Then maybe you want to set the record straight.",

        "Todd: Excuse me. Mr. Kozinski.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Yeah?",
        "Todd: Todd Manning. Jack's father.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Oh, they called you, too, huh?",
        "Todd: Yeah, actually, my wife and I have been here for some time. So this thing's getting really out of hand.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Do you know what happened? All they told me is that our kids caused some accident and someone was badly hurt.",
        "Todd: It was a really stupid prank, and definitely they should be grounded for a month, but this chief detective in this department is a real son of a bitch. John McBain.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Yeah. I've heard of him.",
        "Todd: Yeah. training or something like that, but he's determined to turn this into a major crime. And he would like to charge our boys with kidnapping and attempted murder.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Oh, my God are you serious?",
        "Todd: Yes, I am serious, and we are gonna have to get our stories straight, or this is gonna get really ugly.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Brad's never been in any trouble.",
        "Todd: Well, I'm not sure that's gonna hold much water, because this happened on your property.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: It did?",
        "Todd: Yeah. But as long as you've got a good lawyer...",
        "Mr. Kozinski: I can't afford a lawyer anymore.",
        "Todd: That's a shame.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How are you gonna get me out of this?",
        "T\u00e9a: First I have to see the evidence the police come up with.",
        "Jack: I can't go to prison.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that the worst thing you can see coming out of this?",
        "Jack: Yeah. If I go to prison, my life's over.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I'm sure Shane feels the same way. He's facing his life without his mother.",
        "Jack: Gigi's not dead.",
        "T\u00e9a: I saw her in the hospital. She is on life support. She has no brain function. Gigi's not gonna get better, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why are you telling me this?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: All I've thought about is Gigi and Shane.",
        "Viki: You know, when I first met Shane, he barely came to Gigi's chin. Look at him now--he's so tall.",
        "Rex: He's still a kid, especially now.",
        "Viki: Did you know that Gigi used to buy me lottery tickets?",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Viki: When we first met in Paris, Texas, she used to buy me lottery tickets. Whenever she bought one for herself, she bought one for me, despite how little money she had. She wanted to share her good fortune. That was Gigi.",
        "Rex: Is Gigi.",
        "Viki: And it's how I will always remember her. Gigi Morasco is one of the most generous, loving souls I've ever met in my life. That's why she signed an organ donor card. Most people don't even bother to look at the back of their driver's licenses. She did, because she wanted to help someone else live.",
        "Rex: Not Clint.",
        "Viki: Do you honestly think that's what she would say? Do you think she would say, \"Let him die. Good riddance to him\"? Do you think that she would want someone, anyone, to die if they didn't have to? Do you think that she wouldn't want to give your father the chance to make up to you for everything that he's done to you? Gigi forgave. You know that.",
        "Rex: She forgave me for running out on her. I'm not Gigi.",
        "Viki: No, I know you're not, and I'm not asking you to forgive. I am asking you to think about Gigi and to honor who she was and to honor her wishes because trust me, next week or month or next year, that's going to be all that matters. And that's going to be what you will want to tell her son.",
        "Bo: Hey, Balsom. Are they in surgery?",
        "Rex: No, it won't be happening. There's not gonna be a transplant.",
        "Bo: Why not?",
        "Rex: This is Gigi's health care proxy. She took care of all this stuff when we decided to get married. I didn't even know. It just showed up in the mail. Lucky I got it in time.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: So you're sticking around. That's great.",
        "Baz: Looks like it, as long as Tom\u00e1s is paying my rent.",
        "James: Oh, well, if you hate it that much...",
        "Baz: I don't hate it that much. At first, I wasn't looking forward to Llanview, but now I see the possibilities.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I gotta go. I'm not gonna get a good seat. Here, give me the camera. I'll take pictures.",
        "Nate: Thank you for this.",
        "Dani: Yes.",
        "Nate: And for everything. You're amazing.",
        "Dani: See you later.",
        "Deanna: Nate. I just--I just heard from Rick.",
        "Nate: I don't understand. He overheard us at the Buenos Dias. That was weeks ago. Why is he doing this now?",
        "Deanna: I don't know. . It might be about his production schedule.",
        "Nate: You mean his porno? Whatever. What do I have to do to keep Rick quiet?",
        "Deanna: You are not gonna like this.",
        "Nate: Probably not. But whatever he wants, I'll do it.",
        "Deanna: You're sure?",
        "Nate: If I don't, then Matthew's parents are gonna find out that I nearly killed their son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Go ahead. Take your shot. I know you said it was up to me, but every other Buchanan thinks that Clint should get Gigi's heart, so it's ok if you do, too.",
        "Bo: He's my brother, Balsom. But I know how you feel. A week or so ago, Nora and I were in the same position you're in right now. We were looking at having to make the same choices for Matthew.",
        "Rex: I just want to do right by Gigi.",
        "Bo: And you will... because Gigi trusts you. And she left these decisions up to you for a reason, and whatever you decide to do, it's not gonna change our friendship.",
        "Rex: Thanks. Hey, how's Matthew, by the way?",
        "Bo: He's... he's doing a little better. He said a few words to us.",
        "Rex: That's great. What'd he say?",
        "Bo: He tried to tell me that... someone did this to him.",
        "Rex: Someone you'll be happy to lock up.",
        "Bo: You got that right.",
        "Rex: Jack Manning was arrested for attempted murder and kidnapping. I'm on my way to watch them throw the little punk in lockup now.",
        "Bo: You're going there right now?",
        "Rex: It's the only thing that could keep me from Gigi's side. I just want to be able to tell her that the person who put her in that bed is gonna pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know what, Brad? We don't have a lot of time. You want to go down for this alone? Kidnapping and attempted murder?",
        "Brad: That won't happen.",
        "John: There's a woman in the hospital right now, and they say she may never recover. That's what attempted murder is.",
        "Brad: It wasn't.",
        "John: Brad? Because you know, Jack says you're responsible for the whole thing. And that makes my job easier, because all the evidence points to you.",
        "Brad: This is a trick. Jack didn't say anything. You're trying to get one of us to flip on the other. I've seen this on TV.",
        "John: Yeah? Have you ever seen prison on TV? It's nothing like that, unless you're watching \"Oz.\" It's kind of like that. All I can say is you're gonna be very popular on the inside, and that's gonna be your whole life, Brad. So let me ask you this. Would Jack go to jail to protect you?",
        "Brad: Jack won't have to go to jail.",
        "John: Oh, no, of course not, not if he can get you to do it for him. Does that sound good to you? Hmm? You know, I know this was all Jack's idea. And I understand if you are afraid of him. There's a way here, Brad. Tell me the truth. You can make sure this whole thing comes out right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So you're all set, Mr...",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Kozinski.",
        "Todd: Kozinski. Right.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: All right. Thanks.",
        "Todd: Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So what's it gonna be, Brad? Are you gonna take the fall for what someone else did?",
        "Brad: No! Fine. I'll tell you.",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Brad! Don't say another word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What were you doing?",
        "T\u00e9a: Where'd you go?",
        "Todd: Just doing what I had to do.",
        "T\u00e9a: Which was what?",
        "Todd: I called Blair. I didn't want her to hear about this from someone else.",
        "Jack: You talked to Mom?",
        "Todd: I actually didn't talk to her. I just left a message. But...the way things are going now, I doubt that we'll have to tell her at all.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really?",
        "Todd: Well, yeah. You got it handled. The way things are looking, I'm sure this will all be over before she has to know about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Kozinski: I have a lawyer. Morgan Guthrie. He's on his way.",
        "John: Guthrie, huh?",
        "Mr. Kozinski: Yeah. My son is not entitled to have representation?",
        "John: Yeah. Sure. By the time I'm done with you, you're gonna need it.",

        "Clint: Not much to say.",
        "Bo: No matter what's gone down this past year, this is-- this is not how I wanted things to go.",
        "Clint: Aw, come on. You always loved justice, and here it is. My judgment day. You gotta love it.",
        "Bo: Clint...",
        "Clint: How's Matthew?",
        "Bo: He's better. He even talked to us.",
        "Clint: He's a good boy. He's tough. He's gonna pull through this. Now, I want you to promise me something.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Clint: When Matthew gets better, he's gonna want to clear my name...confess to Eddie Ford's murder. Do not let him do that. He's a good boy. Deserves a clean slate. Bo...it's my last good deed. Let it stand.",

        "John: Brad confessed. He said that he's the one that set up the account to lure Shane to the house and that he locked Gigi in the basement. Jack had nothing to do with it.",
