        "David: Roxy, you asleep?",
        "[Snoring]",
        "David: Drinks are on me. The five male strippers standing behind me all need rooms and female companionship -- preferably an experienced blonde. She's asleep.",
        "Rex: Hey! Hey!",
        "David: Ow! Oh.",
        "Roxy: Oh, I don't think so, David.",
        "David: Ah! Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hi. Um -- I -- I was just wondering. I got back to my desk a few minutes ago -- has anyone called for me? Oh, ok. Thanks. Hello, this is Natalie Buchanan. Ms. Buchanan's office. Natalie Buchanan. I'm really busy -- don't bother me.",
        "Natalie: Hi. You want some coffee?",
        "Woman: I'll get it. That's what I'm here for.",
        "Natalie: But, I'll --",
        "Woman: Oh -- oh, please. Let me go for you.",
        "Natalie: All right. Well, I want a venti skim, sugar-free vanilla --",
        "Woman: That's why god invented expense accounts. Please, just go back and focus on your work.",
        "Natalie: Right. I'll just focus on my bellybutton.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Natalie: Venti skim, sugar-free.",
        "Miles: \"Venti\" what?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- come in. No, it's -- it's just sugar-free is much healthier for me. Ok, right. If you have any more questions, give me a call back. Bye. Miles.",
        "Miles: Hi.",
        "Natalie: Hi. I'm sorry -- Grandpa's not here today.",
        "Miles: I'm not here to see Asa. I'm here to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: He swore to me he would never give you that tape.",
        "John: I didn't get it from him. I got it from Dr. Young. Subpoena, search warrant, murder",
        "Marty: Then you know.",
        "John: I do now. Relax, there's nothing on that tape -- it's blank. But I'm betting Miles' tape isn't blank. He blackmailed you into this, didn't he?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "John: He found the tape, he heard your confession, then he switched that tape with the real one. Isn't that what happened?",
        "Marty: Why would he do that?",
        "John: Don't insult me. He threatened to release the tape if you didn't marry him. He forced you into this, didn't he?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Who is this?",
        "Girl: Does it matter?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Girl: He's right here with me and that's what's important.",
        "Blair: How did you get his phone?",
        "Girl: I told you, he's right here, and so is his phone.",
        "Blair: If you don't give me some straight answers, I'm calling the police right now.",
        "Girl: No, you won't.",
        "Blair: Oh, you think not?",
        "Girl: You call anyone and I'll hang up and you'll never hear from me again. You won't find Todd without me. And right now, only one keeping him alive.",

        "Viki: Clint?",
        "Clint: Hello, Viki.",
        "Viki: Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Viki.",
        "Viki: What is all this?",
        "Clint: Ah, some stuff for Jessica. Dorian and I wanted to drop it off before she gets out of the hospital -- you know, lift her spirits a little bit.",
        "Dorian: Yes, and we thought this would be something that would help you.",
        "Viki: Me?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Clint: Yeah, lighten your load. You know, you're going to have your hands full when she's here recuperating.",
        "Viki: No, I won't.",
        "Clint: Oh, now, don't try and downplay it now. It's going to be a strain and that's why I hired a private nurse.",
        "Viki: You should've called me first.",
        "Clint: Well, I know you. You would've said no.",
        "Viki: That's right, I would have, because Jessica is not staying here. She checked herself out of the hospital and she's gone home with Nash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Ow! Please let go of my finger!",
        "Roxy: You were trying to snag one of my room keys, weren't you?",
        "David: No -- ow!",
        "Roxy: I'm not letting go until you admit it.",
        "David: Ok. Yes, I was, I was. I was trying to steal a key. Now please let go of my finger. Ah. I most certainly was not.",
        "Roxy: You just said that you were.",
        "David: A person will say anything when their life is on the line. That confession was forced -- it will never stand up in court.",
        "Rex: Then what were you reaching for?",
        "David: You. I dropped a cufflink or a contact. I thought it might've dropped behind there.",
        "Rex: You were trying to snake a room. Vintage Vickers.",
        "David: I've change you know, since your son mentions it, though, do you happen to have a room available?",
        "Roxy: No.",
        "David: What if the president showed up?",
        "Roxy: This president?",
        "David: Eisenhower.",
        "Roxy: Oh, him. Oh, yeah, well, I think I could find a room for him.",
        "David: Ok, well, he's not going to show up, so I'll take his room.",
        "Roxy: No, you won't.",
        "David: Look, Roxy, come on. I'm desperate. Don't you even have a broom closet, only much larger with a king-size bed and a view of something that's not a crime scene?",
        "Roxy: You know, I'm thinking here. I'm thinking there's a real nice place that you could flop.",
        "David: Really?",
        "Roxy: Yeah. You can bunk with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Here for dinner or just the show?",
        "Lindsay: Oh, I have to admit, we're just a little bit curious.",
        "Marcie: I know, but David?",
        "Lindsay: And Roxy.",
        "Marcie: I'm not sure I want to know anything else.",
        "Rex: Wise decision. Besides, we have more important things to think about.",
        "Marcie: Did you bring the candles?",
        "Rex: I'll show you the candles if you show me the cake.",
        "Marc: Ok.",
        "Rex: Oh, yeah! Come to papa.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Marcie: Isn't it beautiful?",
        "Rex: Hmm.",
        "Marcie: Put that over there.",
        "Marcie: You ready, Lindsay?",
        "Lindsay: You can light it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: How do I know he's really there?",
        "Girl: I'm using his phone. Isn't that enough?",
        "Blair: No! Because maybe you stole it or maybe you found it or maybe it's a twisted trick of Miles Laurence.",
        "Girl: What are you talking about? You want me to start counting scars or root around for birth marks on him? Look, lady, he's unconscious -- otherwise, I'd put him on the phone right now. So, either you believe me when I tell you he's here, he's sick, and he's hurting, or you call me a prank caller and we leave it at that. So what do you think?",
        "Blair: What's wrong with him?",
        "Girl: I'm not a doctor or anything, but when a stab wound starts oozing, I know it's not a good sign.",
        "Blair: Well, you got to get him to a hospital. You got to help him.",
        "Girl: I'm doing as much as I can. As far as getting him out of here, that's on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Laurence blackmailed you and you lied to me about it.",
        "Marty: Yep, I did. And if I hadn't, he would've turned the tape over and I would've lost Cole. I did what I did to protect him.",
        "John: Yeah? Well, now you and Cole are in more trouble than you ever were.",
        "Marty: From your perspective.",
        "John: Yeah, damn right, my perspective.",
        "Marty: Look, I married Miles. I know what he feels about me and I know he won't hurt me.",
        "John: You sure about that? You willing to bet your life on that? Look, if you don't mind me asking, how far has this little sham union gone? I mean, has he made you --",
        "Marty: No. And if he tries, I'll kill him.",
        "John: You know, you wouldn't be in this mess if you would've come to me in the first place.",
        "Marty: No, it -- it would be worse. I -- you know, I would be in jail, Cole would be a ward of the state, and you would --",
        "John: I'd be what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Wait -- Jessica checked herself out? When?",
        "Viki: This morning.",
        "Clint: It's not a hotel.",
        "Viki: Really? I wanted her to stay longer, but her doctor said it was all right.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I really think that was premature. Was she advised about how important proper convalescence was?",
        "Viki: I know perfectly well what a transplant operation entails, Dorian, and, yes, Jessica was told about the need for care. But I'm not in her body. I mean, I -- I don't know how she feels. Obviously, she felt well enough to go home and be with her daughter.",
        "Dorian: I still say it was a mistake.",
        "Clint: So, she just went over to Nash's?",
        "Viki: That's where she wanted to be.",
        "Clint: Now, how the hell is Nash going to take care of Bree and Jessica?",
        "Viki: Well, I expect he'll be just peachy once he gets your gifts and your nurse.",
        "Clint: Why didn't you let me know about this?",
        "Viki: Hello? I left a message with your secretary. What, didn't you go to the office today?",
        "Clint: Yeah, I went to the office, but it was Natalie's first day, if you recall.",
        "Viki: Yes, I'm aware of that.",
        "Clint: Well, then you should be aware that I was showing her around, didn't get to my desk, so I never got your message.",
        "Viki: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Clint has been very busy.",
        "Viki: Really? Well, I also left a message at Asa's, and I also left a message on your cell phone.",
        "Clint: Well, my cell phone was turned off, and I wasn't at Pa's this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: So, congratulations on the job.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. How -- how did you know?",
        "Miles: Oh, Jessica told my wife.",
        "Natalie: Your wife?",
        "Miles: Marty.",
        "Natalie: Right. Right. Sorry -- just -- it happened so fast, I -- anyway, congratulations.",
        "Miles: Thank you. Marty and I are so in love.",
        "Natalie: That's -- that's really nice. So, what are you here for?",
        "Miles: Well, I'm sure you're aware that Spencer left me a lot of money.",
        "Natalie: I heard.",
        "Miles: And, well, it's just sitting around in a bank account earning interest, and I want to do something with it to help people.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Miles. Have a seat.",
        "Miles: Oh. Thank you. Well -- ahem -- I've sponsored a couple of kids that were born with deformities and things. But, you know, there's only so much I can do by myself.",
        "Natalie: And you were thinking?",
        "Miles: I was thinking a foundation would have a huge impact, and it would continue to help long after I'm gone.",
        "Natalie: And you were thinking of having corporate backing?",
        "Miles: Exactly. And I thought enterprises would be perfect, and now that you're part of the machine --",
        "Natalie: Oh, ok. I -- I've been here one day. I would hardly say I'm part of the machine. I -- I don't even know how to do any of this stuff.",
        "Miles: I don't, either, so we can learn as we go.",
        "Natalie: Ok. All -- all right. Well, we're going to have to jump through a bunch of hoops for my grandfather, but if you're willing to do that, sure.",
        "Miles: What kind of hoops?",
        "Natalie: Well, my grandpa holds the key to the vault, all right? And I know my grandfather well enough to know he's not going to just throw money at you. He is going to look at your proposal, then he's going to have you checked out from your finances to your last colonoscopy.",
        "Miles: Um -- well, I don't have anything to hide, but I do draw a line at the latter.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What else you been holding back?",
        "Miles: You killed Spencer. Do you really want John McBain's blood on your hands, too?",
        "Marty: I'm just -- you know, you could lose your badge in this mess somewhere, ok? You -- you've already arrested David and I -- I just don't want anybody else to get hurt, ok? Especially you.",
        "John: I can handle myself. I sure as hell can handle Laurence.",
        "Marty: Yes, you need to be careful about him.",
        "John: Guy's a little fish. Believe me, I've swam with the worst, and he's a shrimp.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm. Hey, don't you and Blair think he had something to do with Todd's disappearance?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Well, maybe Todd thought that he could handle Miles, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: He's hurting pretty good.",
        "Blair: Well, where is he?",
        "Girl: Chicago.",
        "Blair: Chicago? That'll take hours for me to get there! You've got to get him some help!",
        "Girl: I'm doing as much as I can.",
        "Blair: Well, you got to do more! You got to take him to a hospital, drop him off in an emergency room or something.",
        "Girl: You think? What, I -- I pull up to the hospital and pull a half-dead stabbing victim out of my car, prop him up. The cops are going to say, \"Good afternoon, Miss. Can I lend you a hand?\" Sorry -- I don't think so. I'm not getting arrested for something I didn't do.",
        "Blair: I'm not saying that you did, all right? But if you don't do something, then you will be responsible for him dying.",
        "Girl: If I try to move him on my own, he'll probably die anyway. You know, you're not helping by guilting me. I'm sorry I even called.",
        "Blair: No, wait -- wait, wait, wait. Just -- for Todd's sake, just give me your address and I'll -- and I'll come get him.",
        "Girl: So you can call the police -- I don't think so.",

        "Rex and Lindsay: This is your birthday song it doesn't last too long hey",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Marcie: Yay!",
        "[Marcie claps]",
        "Rex: Huh!",
        "Marcie: You know, I'd probably still be a receptionist at Llanview Hospital if it wasn't for Jen.",
        "Rex: She definitely changed our lives.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lindsay: And all for the better.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Marcie: Yeah. You know, without Jen in my life, I don't think I ever would've written that national bestseller, I certainly wouldn't be married to Michael, and I wouldn't have this little amazing guy here as my son, would I? Huh?",
        "Rex: You know, you may find this hard to believe, but there was a time where I wasn't the greatest influence on girls.",
        "Marcie: No!",
        "Lindsay: Get out.",
        "Rex: Really.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Rex: There was something about Jen that made me do some insane things to impress her. And I know it wasn't in her nature, but she did some pretty insane things to impress me.",
        "Lindsay: Like what?",
        "Rex: Well, it's not my proudest moment, but we were at The Palace one night -- don't ask me why we were there.",
        "Marcie: Why were you there?",
        "Rex: To help the rich.",
        "Lindsay: Are you buying this, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Rex: So, I pretended to be a room-service guy. Don't ask me where I got the uniform.",
        "Marcie: Where'd you get the uniform?",
        "Rex: Da-da-da-da-da-da -- anyway, we were able to get into some of the rooms.",
        "Marcie: Wait, wait, wait -- let me guess. You were there to surprise them, do a little spring cleaning of the rooms.",
        "Lindsay: By cleaning out their wallets.",
        "Rex: I prefer \"lightening their loads.\"",
        "Marcie: Oh, my god -- I cannot believe you ripped them off.",
        "Lindsay: What a kind and benevolent man you are.",
        "Rex: Not my proudest moment, like I said, but what I was getting to was the way Jen went along with it. It was fun. She was a little shaky, but it was exciting, the way she just put herself out there to please me -- Rex Balsom, delinquent. Anyway, your turn, Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Ok. When Jen was born, I was afraid that the nurse was going to bring her in and put her in my lap and that she would look at me and not know me and that we would go through life as strangers. But when she put her down in my arms, she looked up at me and she smiled and she grabbed me with her little hand, you know, and she squeezed my finger, and right then I knew everything was going to be ok. Later on, when she was a little bit older and we'd get mad at each other, she'd reach out and squeeze my fingers to let me know that things were ok. I don't know, I just -- I still feel her with me. I'm sorry.",

        "Roxy: You're going to be staying with me, so you should see where the spare key is. It's right over there, right on the right.",
        "David: Uh-huh, I see. Ok. Ahem -- you know, maybe it'd be better if I just stay out here on the couch.",
        "Roxy: No, I think it would be so much better if you slept with me. Of course, I don't think we're going to get much sleeping done.",
        "David: You know, actually, maybe it would be better --",
        "Roxy: No, I think it would be better if you admit that there's a lot of heat between the two of us. It's like we're kind of, like, kinky spirits. I've seen hard times, you've done hard time. Every girl likes a bad boy, somebody that she's got to tame, so what do you think? I could be the sexy warden, you could be the naughty inmate, and if you're bad -- and I mean really, really bad -- you could spend a couple of days in the hole. What do you think, huh? Hey, stop -- come on! Hey! Hey-hey! Hey, the prison break comes later!",

        "Viki: Well, I guess it's a very good thing that nobody was dying. I'll know to try you at Dorian's from now on.",
        "Dorian: Yes. My maid is very good at giving us messages.",
        "Clint: Viki, I am sorry that you couldn't reach me.",
        "Viki: Yes, well, why don't you go and visit your daughter and your granddaughter now? I'll call Jessica, and \"if\" -- if she answers her phone, I'll alert her that you're coming.",
        "Dorian: Oh, really, Viki. Do you have to take such a sarcastic tone?",
        "Viki: I'm sorry -- is anyone talking to you?",
        "Dorian: Oh. Clint, it is obvious that Viki's disapproval of our relationship is, how shall we say, coloring this discussion? Viki, face it -- Clint and I \"are\" in a relationship and the sooner you accept it, the better.",

        "Marty: What are you thinking?",
        "John: Just weighing our options.",
        "Marty: John, I can handle this, ok? This isn't your battle.",
        "John: Huh. With all due respect, all you've done is made things more complicated. Believe me, I know how hard it is to ask someone for help. But you're not making things easier for you or Cole by shutting me out.",
        "Marty: Look, just promise me you won't confront Miles, ok? It puts Cole at risk.",
        "John: You realize what you're asking me to do?",
        "Marty: Yes. And if not for me, just for Cole, please. Just do what I ask.",
        "John: Ok. For now, I'll focus on finding who really killed Truman. But if this guy crosses the line, he so much lays a hand on you or Cole, I'll put an end to him.",

        "Girl: How much what?",
        "Blair: Money! How much money do you want?",
        "Girl: This isn't about money. This is about Todd not dying and me not going to jail.",
        "Blair: Where is he?",
        "Girl: No cops?",
        "Blair: No cops.",
        "Girl: Or ambulances, either. If the guy -- guys who did this find out, they'll kill him before you even get here.",
        "Blair: Well, what's to stop these guys from killing him when I do arrive?",
        "Girl: I'll take care of them. Just get here. He can't hold on much longer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: But the problem with your plan is we already knew who killed Spencer.",
        "John: No, we don't. I have my doubts.",
        "Marty: Why -- John, why don't you believe me? I -- I remember. I was there in Blair's room, the scissors in my hand.",
        "John: Doesn't prove anything. You know? Where were you before you got there? Where'd you go after you left? You know, you got this snapshot in your head, maybe 10%. What happened the rest of the time we won't know for sure unless you can connect the dots.",
        "Marty: And if I can't? And if this is all that I can remember?",
        "John: Then we go with what you remember, all right? And we just try to connect it in that timeline.",
        "Marty: Don't you think I have tried that? Look, it didn't get me anywhere.",
        "John: I'm getting the feeling you don't want this to work. Why are you fighting me on this?",
        "Marty: There is a reason people block out memories. Ok? Traumatic memories. It's -- it's a defense mechanism.",
        "John: I get it. But this way, at least we get the truth. All right? And that's better than not knowing. So what do you say? You with me?",

        "Natalie: My grandfather is a very cautious man. I mean, if he doesn't shoot you down because of your last name, he is going to hire a team of investigators to dig up as much dirt as they can on you.",
        "Miles: There's no dirt.",
        "Natalie: Ok. But he's going to look into your days at the institution, your relationship with Spencer, and your marriage. I mean, are you comfortable with a bunch of guys barging in and asking a bunch of personal questions to Marty?",
        "Miles: Why would Asa be concerned with my marriage?",
        "Natalie: I don't know -- maybe because it happened so fast, and he would want to make sure that you don't just jump into things without thinking them through.",
        "Miles: Why would he be upset about me marrying a woman I love? And why are you so interested in my marriage?",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Miles: Well, you -- you brought it up. You keep talking about it.",

        "Natalie: I don't know -- it's just that relationships don't come easy for me, and I don't have a great association with getting marriage.",
        "Miles: We love each other, we got married, and we're not kids. We know what we want. Marty is what I've always wanted.",
        "Natalie: Miles, I understand that for you. And look, I don't know her very well, but Marty seems to me to be very conservative. I just find it hard to believe that she would marry a guy that she's only known for a few months and dated for a lot less.",

        "Dorian: No! No, I think it's time for us to take the gloves off, ok? So why don't you just tell us how you really feel? And that way, maybe Clint and I can get on with our lives in some peace.",
        "Viki: I don't care about you and Clint, I don't care. I will tell you, however, I find it highly embarrassing that you feel the need to flaunt your sex life whenever you're around me.",

        "Dorian: We do not flaunt the fact that we really enjoy each other's company, but we are certainly not going to disguise the fact that we care for each other just because you happen to be around.",
        "Viki: See? Now you're doing it again. You grab what you think I want, and then you try and taunt me with it.",

        "Lindsay: But it's not a bother. I love spending time with him, and it makes me feel better, especially today.",

        "Dorian: Here we go.",
        "David: Before you say no, please, just hear me out. I'm not asking for much. Say, the carriage house, maybe a car. You'll never even see me except when I'm at the pool. And I remember, if I'm going to wear my slingshot, I have to wear it in the backyard from now on when I lay out.",

        "Blair: Look, I've got to do it, all right? Todd is alive, and I'm doing this for Jack and Starr. I told them that I would find their father and that's what I'm going to. It's my only lead I've got! I'm going!",
