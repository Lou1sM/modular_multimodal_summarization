        "Todd: Then get out.",
        "John: You got painkillers? You in pain, Manning?",
        "Todd: No, he's not your husband. He's the one who left you to die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Just give me two minutes to change, okay, for Nash's funeral.",
        "Antonio: You still have a gun in your bedroom, right?",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: All right, stay behind me, okay?",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: I have to call you back. Bye. Aw, did my little David Vickers do his royal duty?",
        "Cristian: Yes, he did, and you know what the fine is for not scooping royal duty? 100 bucks. 100 bucks.",
        "Tina: Oh, well. Oh, I -- I didn't know that, see, because usually my serv -- uh, assistants do that for me.",
        "Cristian: You have assistants?",
        "Sarah: Cris, I think we should get going.",
        "Cristian: Where are your assistants when you can't find a place to crash?",
        "Sarah: Cris, please.",
        "Cristian: No, really. Where the hell are your assistants when somebody's holding a gun at your daughter, looking for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonas: Congratulations. In a few short hours, you'll have everything and everyone you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: I have everything I've ever wanted. This is the best. Dad and I killed in that three-legged race.",
        "Gigi: I'm sure Brody did okay, but, uh, I think you got your field game skills from the Morasco side.",
        "[Brody chuckles]",
        "Shane: Dad did better than okay. Halfway through the race, I almost tripped and ate the dirt.",
        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Shane: But then, Dad grabbed me and did this somersault thing, and the next thing I knew, we were going even faster.",
        "Gigi: Well, I guess we ought to pin a cape on him, huh?",
        "Shane: It was sort of like a superhero move. Dad's the coolest.",
        "Rex: He'd have to be to have a kid as cool as you. I don't think we've been formally introduced. I'm Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: How about this one-bedroom down by the river? It sounds like it could be cool, you know?",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry. I'm just not into looking at any more apartments today. There's only one other place I want to be today. I want to go to Nash's funeral, and I just wish that Jessica would want me there.",
        "Jared: Yeah, me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I can't do this.",
        "Viki: Yes, you can, sweetheart. Yes, you can. And we'll help you, I promise.",
        "Clint: Honey, we'll be with you every step of the way.",
        "Clint: It's going to be a while before we get started. Why don't we take a walk?",
        "Jessica: Uh, you guys go ahead.",
        "Viki: No, darling. No, we're not going to leave you alone.",
        "Jessica: You know, I could use a couple moments alone.",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Okay. But, honey, if you need us --",
        "Jessica: I'll just call your cell phone.",
        "Viki: Okay. Will you be all right if people arrive early?",
        "Jessica: Oh, yeah. There's no one I can't face on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey. How come you're not dressed for the funeral?",
        "Jared: Oh, we decided not to go.",
        "Natalie: I'm the last person Jess needs to see today.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, funerals suck, especially when the person is so young.",
        "Natalie: How are you holding up?",
        "Roxy: Not so great, but I figured I'd do a little pre-gaming, so I hit the liquor store, and look what I got.",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Oh.",
        "Roxy: Yeah. It's all they had left. The last of Nash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Brody Lovett.",
        "Shane: Lieutenant Brody Lovett, U.S. Navy.",
        "Rex: Heard a lot about you.",
        "Brody: Heard a lot about you, too.",
        "Rex: Well, that's how it goes with ex's, I guess.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry about throwing the monkey wrench in your wedding.",
        "Rex: Hey, who could resist a pretty girl and a paycheck?",
        "Shane: Look at what my dad and I won.",
        "Rex: Sweet. First place, three-legged race, father-son champions. Well, I need to get me one of these someday.",
        "Shane: You have to get one of these first. I'm sure you will, though. Chicks dig guys like you.",
        "Gigi: Shane --",
        "Shane: What? They do. Sorry about Adriana, though.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Gigi: You guys been in touch?",
        "Rex: She's doing her thing in Paris.",
        "Shane: Were you ever stationed in Paris, dad?",
        "Brody: I was all over the world, kid.",
        "Rex: Llanview must be kind of a slow pace for your tastes.",
        "Brody: I'm actually -- I'm liking it just fine.",
        "Shane: He's liking it so much, he's going to stick around.",
        "Rex: Putting down roots?",
        "Shane: He moved in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, those are for my tennis elbow or my golf elbow -- one of those elbows.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Todd: I'd invite you to the country club but --",
        "John: Yeah, no, of course. Actually, I'm, uh, I'm here on business anyway. I wanted to talk to you about the woman from the penthouse. You know, we found her records in Ramsey's office. She's severely injured.",
        "Todd: Okay, and?",
        "John: And she's in need of medical attention.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: Okay, what does this have to do with me?",
        "John: Oh, boy. You know that Ramsey was keeping the woman in his place before he was killed.",
        "Todd: Uh, so Ramsey was into cripples, huh?",
        "John: I don't know, you tell me. Hey, look. You were in the penthouse at some point and so was she, and then she just up and disappeared.",
        "Todd: Would you like to ask me something?",
        "John: Yeah, I would. Who's the woman, and what have you done with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: It's all clear. Television, stereo, electronics --",
        "Talia: Not one of the computers were touched.",
        "Antonio: Anything else missing?",
        "Talia: Not that I can see. I mean, I don't think this makes any sense.",
        "Antonio: Whoever was here was looking for something very specific.",
        "Talia: Like what?",
        "Antonio: Not what -- who.",
        "Talia: Antonio, what do you mean?",
        "Antonio: McBain saw a woman charging out of Ramsey's the day he was murdered.",
        "Talia: The same woman that that guy was looking for in the park.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, that's right. The same woman who threatened Sarah. We need to find Sarah, now.",
        "[Layla screams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Would you please keep your voice down? David Vickers has a very nervous bladder.",
        "Cristian: Do you care that you put Sarah's life in danger?",
        "Tina: Of course I care. I would die if anything happened to her. I love her with everything I have.",
        "Cristian: What about common sense? Do you have that?",
        "Sarah: Cris, it's not her fault that someone held a gun on her.",
        "Cristian: That someone was looking for her.",
        "[Tina scoffs]",
        "Tina: What, so blame the victim? I mean, since when did I become the criminal here?",
        "Sarah: Guys, could you please just stop?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Sarah: Hello?",
        "Talia: Sarah, hi. It's Talia. Where are you?",
        "Sarah: Um, I'm at Cris's studio. Why?",
        "Talia: Sarah, is anyone there with you?",
        "Sarah: No, it's just me and Cristian. What's up? You sound funny.",
        "Talia: Okay, um, brace yourself.",
        "Cristian: I know all about the trouble that follows you around. What I don't get is how you can do this to Sarah.",
        "Tina: What am I doing to Sarah?",
        "Cristian: It seems to me you're choosing this scam you got going over her own safety.",
        "Tina: Look, who the hell do you think you are?",
        "Sarah: Someone just broke into my apartment.",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Sarah: I just got off the phone with Talia. She and Antonio are there, and they think it's the guy with the gun from the park.",
        "Cristian: You need to come clean now.",
        "Tina: Yeah, all right.",
        "Tina: Look, the guy with the gun in the park? His name is Jonas Chamberlain and he is the U.S. Ambassador to the country of Mendorra and he's looking for these.",
        "Cristian: We need to tell Antonio.",
        "Tina: No! Do you know how long it's taken me to get my hands on these?",
        "Cristian: Four people are dead because of those things. I'm not about to let Sarah be number five.",
        "Tina: What, so now you're saying I'm a killer?",
        "Cristian: We can't put off contacting the police anymore. You know that, right?",
        "Tina: Look, you're taking this too far.",
        "Sarah: Mom, people have died.",
        "Tina: And they were trying to steal these from me.",
        "Cristian: Ramsey stole those jewels. What were you doing, helping him move them?",
        "Tina: No! No, I was trying to buy them back.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, right. You and what money?",
        "Tina: The Royal Bank of Mendorra.",
        "Cristian: You're serious?",
        "[Tina scoffs]",
        "Tina: Yes. Look. \"R-B-M.\"",
        "Sarah: What is the \"h-r-h\" in front of your name?",
        "Tina: Her royal highness. I'm a princess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Didn't I hear that you tried to run down some woman in Ramsey's place the day he was murdered, but you lost her? How does that happen? How does a woman with all these broken bones outrun a cop?",
        "John: Different woman.",
        "Todd: Oh. Oh, so a cripple and a murder suspect. You ought to try online dating.",
        "John: Yeah, yeah. Why don't you just tell me what you've done with her?",
        "Todd: [Shouting] What are you going to do, John, torture me? I'm not going anywhere with you, not without a warrant.",
        "John: Okay, have it your way.",
        "Todd: Can't you see I'm in mourning, John?",
        "John: You should be. Well, good luck with the new place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Wait, um, Brody did not move in with us. He -- he's just staying on the couch for now.",
        "Brody: You know, until I find a more permanent solution.",
        "Shane: Like moving upstairs.",
        "Gigi: Shane --",
        "Shane: What? You're my mom and he's my dad. Where else is he going to go?",
        "Gigi: Okay, you remember that certain kind of conversation we talked about, the inappropriate kind? Well, this is officially one of those.",
        "Rex: Hey, well, wherever he's staying, you're a pretty lucky guy. Just having your dad around can make all the difference. Well, I should -- I should get going to the church.",
        "Gigi: Let Viki know I'll be by later?",
        "Rex: Sure.",
        "Shane: You should stop by sometime and we can play video games.",
        "Rex: As long as you're ready to get creamed.",
        "Shane: Yeah, right.",
        "[Rex grunts]",
        "Shane: Hey, Dad, catch.",
        "Gigi: Will you two grow up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Guard this for me 'til after.",
        "Jared: No problem.",
        "Roxy: Listen, no matter what happens, you still got a mom.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Roxy: Hey, you look great.",
        "Rex: Hey, Natty, Jared.",
        "Roxy: Could we take a walk to the church together?",
        "Rex: I'll pass.",
        "Roxy: Hey, look, don't do that, not today. Can we just talk for a minute?",
        "Rex: I have absolutely nothing to say to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: This family has had quite a run lately, hasn't it? First, we lose pa, then B.E., and now Nash.",
        "Nora: I don't want to bring up business at a time like this, but you said, \"B.E.\" I haven't had a chance to go through those company papers yet. Do you need the brief right away?",
        "Bo: What are you doing?",
        "Lindsay: Um --",
        "Bo: No, we can figure that out later.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah, something like that isn't important on a day like today, is it?",
        "Bo: Hmm-mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, are you ready?",
        "Jessica: I -- I don't know. I don't know what that feels like.",
        "Viki: Darling, I promise you --",
        "Jessica: That I can do it. I know. Everybody keeps on saying that I can do this, but nobody tells me how. Nobody tells me how. How am I supposed to bury the love of my life? How am I supposed to do that?",
        "[Jessica sobs]",
        "Viki: You just do it, sweetheart. Life goes on whether we want it to or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Antonio sighs]",
        "Antonio: You sure, uh, you sure they didn't take anything else?",
        "Layla: Not that I can tell, but you told me not to touch anything.",
        "Antonio: Right.",
        "Layla: We better get going or else we're going to be late. Tal?",
        "Talia: Um, you know, why don't you guys just go ahead? I'll wait here for the unit so I can give them a statement.",
        "Antonio: You sure?",
        "Talia: Yeah. And I'll, um, I'll hustle that other angle while I'm at it.",
        "Layla: What other angle?",
        "Antonio: This might be connected to another case we're working.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So you're a princess now? How did that happen?",
        "[Tina scoffs]",
        "Tina: You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Nothing I say seems to be good enough for you.",
        "Cristian: No, it's not good enough for Sarah.",
        "Tina: All right. All right, already. I get it. I'm a bad mother.",
        "Sarah: No, we settled this.",
        "Cristian: No, we haven't. Look, she's not back in Llanview because of you. She's here for those jewels. And if things had gone the way she planned, she'd probably be off in Mendorra, some made-up country, playing princess.",
        "Tina: It's not made up. It's Mendorra, look it up.",
        "Sarah: Mom, how did this happen?",
        "Tina: Well, uh, last year, I met the prince of Mendorra. Well, I mean, to be honest, I thought I had given up on love, but he was so handsome and charming and --",
        "Sarah: You married him, and you didn't tell anyone, including your children.",
        "Tina: No, I know. I should've told you -- of course I should have. But I don't deal very well with guilt, I -- I never have. And now that I think about it, that's probably why I got David Vickers, so I could shower him with all the love and affection that I should've showered on you.",
        "Cristian: Priceless.",
        "Tina: But, you know, when he was born, he needed me 24/7. His mother died giving birth to him, and I had to bottle-feed him. And of course he -- he grew up and he didn't really need me any more.",
        "Cristian: Why are we talking about the freaking dog? We need to involve Antonio.",
        "Tina: No. No, we can't. Look, this bogus ambassador is responsible for the deaths of four people. He stole the heritage of the whole country of Mendorra. Now he wants me, too.",
        "Cristian: My brother is already investigating this. He needs this information.",
        "Tina: No, no, no. No, what we need is to have our two governments handle this on their own, all right, quietly. But that can't happen until I leave the country safely with the jewels.",
        "Sarah: You just got here.",
        "Cristian: Being a princess is obviously more important than being a mother.",
        "Tina: It's more dangerous for you if I stay. I mean, look, Jonas already pointed a gun at Sarah, and he would've killed me if he had the chance. Now, this man is capable of anything.",

        "Cristian: You all right, then?",
        "Sarah: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: Okay, we'll give you until tonight to get yourself out of town. After that, I have to go to my brother.",
        "Tina: Thank you.",
        "Tina: Oh, honey. We still have time.",
        "Sarah: No, we don't. We have to go.",
        "Tina: Where to?",
        "Sarah: Nash's funeral. Jessica's husband?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, too bad you can't be there. She is your niece.",
        "Tina: I wish I could be there for Jessica, for all of them, but they don't even know I'm here. I just -- I can't.",
        "Cristian: If you leave this place for any other reason than to get out of town, the deal's off.",

        "Todd: Yeah, he was here.",
        "Marty: Well, did he find out -- did he find out that I'm alive?",
        "Todd: No, no, he has no idea you're alive, and, uh --",
        "Marty: What?",
        "Todd: The truth is, he seems happier that way.",
        "Marty: Well, then why was he here?",
        "Todd: Oh, he just hates me, and he won't stop until he's taken away everything and everybody that's dear to me.",
        "Marty: Oh, is that why you're taking care of me, because you hate him?",
        "Todd: If you only knew what he's done.",
        "Marty: Well, tell me.",
        "Todd: No, I don't want that stuff in your head when you're trying to get better.",
        "Marty: I'll just lay here and imagine the worst if you don't tell me the truth.",
        "Todd: Okay, I'll tell you when I get back.",
        "Marty: Where are you going?",
        "Todd: A funeral.",
        "Marty: Is it Lee's?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I doubt John will be man enough to show his face. But you just lay here and rest, and Janet and Keys will be back any minute, okay?",

        "Jessica: It's the worst when I wake up at night.",
        "Viki: I know. Because that's when you're really alone. And lying there in the dark, you hear Nash's voice, and you want to go to him.",
        "Jessica: I can't.",
        "Viki: No. And you're afraid of the path ahead. You're afraid that going forward is going to hurt more than standing still. But, sweetheart, you -- you will come out on the other side. You have to.",
        "Jessica: Mom, I'm not as strong as you are.",
        "Viki: No, that's not true. You are stronger. You are so much stronger.",
        "Clint: Jessie, do you need any more time?",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: No, no, I'm ready. Let's do this.",
        "Minister: I am the resurrection and the life, says the lord. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. They are new every morning. Great is his faithfulness. I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God, in Christ Jesus, our Lord. We brought nothing into the world, and we take nothing out. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. God so loved the world that he gave his only son so that everyone who may believe in him may not perish, but may have eternal life.",
        "Minister: Lord, let us welcome our brother Nash into your house.",

        "Gigi: Shane, you're a mess. Please, go clean up.",
        "Shane: Okay.",
        "Brody: We should probably rein him in, huh?",
        "Gigi: I can handle my son. Can you rein yourself in?",
        "Brody: Where'd that come from?",
        "Gigi: This mess is hard enough to deal with without you getting in Rex's face.",
        "Brody: I was polite. Rex is the one that brought up Adriana.",
        "Gigi: You mean, you brought up the fact that his fianc\u00e9e bribed you to come back into my life.",
        "Brody: Look, not my most shining moment, but this is hard on me, too. I'm trying to do my best to do what you set me up to do.",
        "Gigi: I set you up?",
        "Brody: Do you want me to leave?",
        "Gigi: I didn't say that.",
        "Brody: Good, because I don't want to. I don't want to impose on you, but I don't want to disappoint Shane, either. I dig that kid.",
        "Gigi: He likes you, too.",
        "Brody: I know I'm not \"Dad of the Year\" material, but I like learning how to be. I don't know where I'd be if you weren't giving me this chance.",

        "Talia: You're under arrest, Mr. Ambassador.",
        "Jonas: I don't think so. You're not on the force any more, Officer Sahid.",
        "Talia: How do you know who I am?",
        "Jonas: I know all about you, Talia, every last detail.",
        "Talia: If you take one more step, I will shoot you.",
        "Jonas: No, I really -- I don't think you will.",

        "John: All right, Manning. Let's see what you're hiding.",
        "Jared: I know it'd be disrespectful for us to show up with everyone else, but maybe we can be there. What if we just went to listen?",
        "Natalie: If my sister sees me, she'll freak out.",
        "Jared: She won't see you. We won't go inside. We'll get just close enough to listen and just close enough to say a prayer for Nash. And then maybe, hopefully, just close enough that Jessica can feel your love, even if she doesn't see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Yes, I'm fine. We both are. Sarah's hiding me. Oh, yes. You should see how beautiful she is. It's going to be so hard to leave her. And well, maybe -- maybe I could stay just a little while longer? For Sarah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Falling past memories falling like autumn floating downstream I wish I could carry you in my arms but we falter to think how this could be this is our last chance this is only one life don't leave us here uncertain we need you tonight and for the rest of our lives",
        "Minister: Thank you for that lovely tribute, Ms. Roberts.",
        "Minister: I would like to extend a heartfelt welcome to all who have come here today. We are here to remember and to celebrate the life of Nash Brennan. To give thanks for that life, to commit his body to be buried, and to comfort one another in our grief.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, you're right. It's too dicey to stay here. I know, but maybe -- maybe after all this has blown over, maybe we could visit? Promise me, okay? All right. I'll call you from the airport.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonas: Good news. Talia Sahid was no problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Gigi: You are on thin ice, little man.",
        "[Shane sighs]",
        "Shane: What now?",
        "Gigi: The smart comments, the spying.",
        "Shane: There's nothing wrong with being happy that my parents are getting along, right, Dad?",
        "Brody: Oh, a tricky move, Cadet. You know what we call that in the navy? Divide and conquer -- and it won't work on me. Mind your mother.",
        "Shane: Is this how it's going to be, you and dad always teaming up on me?",
        "Gigi: What if it is?",
        "Shane: I can live with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: At this point, I'd like to invite anyone to share a story, a memory, or simply a kind word with us about Nash.",
        "Clint: When I first met Nash Brennan, I didn't like him -- not at all. I thought he was reckless, antagonistic, combative -- and on top of that, he claimed to love my daughter. Now, what father wouldn't be terrified? But after a while, I found that these traits that I thought I hated -- they had a different side. And in a certain situation, recklessness became fearlessness and his readiness take up arms -- well, that just meant that Nash wasn't about to walk away from the woman he loved just because she had a disapproving daddy. I was proud to call him family, and I'm sorry I wasted time thinking that he could be anything less.",
        "Viki: And Nash saw Jessie through an illness that could have been fatal, but he never ever stopped believing that his love could save her, that she would pull through. And she did.",
        "Bo: All it took for me to know that Nash was an extraordinary guy was to take a look at Jessie. I've never seen anyone so completely in love and that's all any of us really want. It's -- there's nothing better than acting like two fools completely in love and not caring at all.",
        "[Roxy sniffles]",
        "Roxy: There aren't a lot of people in this town who know how to take me as I am, warts and all, but Nash was one of them and he had a big heart. And I feel really lucky that I got to know him well. Hey, not in the biblical sense. Maybe next life.",
        "[Roxy laughs]",
        "Jessica: Sorry.",
        "Jessica: Nash, um, was my husband, um, the father of my daughter. And, uh --",
        "[Jessica exhales]",
        "Jessica: I guess I just, uh, want to say a few words about him and, uh, why he's gone.",
        "Jessica: If it wasn't for Nash, I wouldn't be here. When I was lost, he -- he was my guide. When everything that I was doing was either hurting myself or my family, he --",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: He healed me. He saved my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd's voice: No, John has no idea you're alive and, um --",
        "Marty's voice: What?",
        "Todd's voice: Well, the truth is, he seems happier that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Okay, David Vickers, come on. Do your business because we have to go back inside.",
        "Jonas: What's a royal like you doing in a slum like this? Greetings, Princess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: If it weren't for Nash, um, I'd be dead, and I know that like I know the sun is going to rise tomorrow. I was on a path straight towards oblivion, and he found me wanted me and then he took care of me. And, um -- and then he forgave me when I wasn't the woman that he fell in love with. And the miracle of all miracles, we fell in love a second time. But his ability to forgive is what I really think brought us together. And I thought about how that ability would have been tested because of what's brought us here today. And I thought about what Nash would do and how he would react if he were here -- if he had to -- if he had to say something about someone that he loved and he lost, and I think I know what he would say.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "John: I think you're going to tell me the truth. Who do you got up in that room?",
        "Tina: You'll never find out where the jewels are.",
        "Jonas: Maybe I can think of a way to change your mind.",
        "Jessica: I need to talk about why he died, why you killed him."
