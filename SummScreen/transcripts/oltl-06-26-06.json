        "Blair is home alone. She thinks about the night before and overhearing David and Spencer talking. Suddenly she realizes that Todd is at the house. He has come there to reclaim his home. He asks her where she was the night before. She admits that she was with Spencer. \"See that wasn't so hard was it? Get the hell out of my house,\" he orders. Blair says that she still loves Todd but confirms that she is with Spencer still. \"Get out!\" Todd orders. She starts heading to the stairs. She wants to get some things for the kids. Todd points a finger at her, so that she knows that he is being serious. He tells her that he will never allow his children to go anywhere near the likes of Spencer Truman. Blair goes to see Bo who is still hanging out at the station. She tells that things are getting worse and that Todd is talking about getting custody of the kids. She has to get more information on Spencer and make things right. She tells Bo that she overheard David talking to Spencer the night before and he confessed to killing John's father. Todd calls to find out about getting full custody of his children. As he talks, he gets so angry that he slams a picture of Blair that he sees into the wastebasket in front of him. After that call, he calls David. They have some business to finish up and he invites the man over to talk about that. David comes for his two million but Todd won't pay that out until he gets information on where his kid is. Spencer gets a call from the man from Kentucky who gave him the bodies. He is calling to make sure that his sister will be taken care of like Spencer promised. Spencer assures that all is fine. The man promises that he will keep his mouth shut as they discussed his would. \"Good man,\" Spencer says smiling."

        "Bo: Come in.",
        "Rex: Look, I know you're still pissed at me about all the bonehead things that I've done lately, but I need your help. Adriana has this -- what -- what are you doing?",
        "Bo: I'm packing. I'm out of a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "John: I got your note.",
        "Natalie: I thought maybe we should do breakfast up here.",
        "John: Yeah, I like the idea. I like it up here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Which one of us had the worse week? I went looking for Todd's kid, got arrested for murder. You danced the Lambada with an S.U.V. despite your head wound, I think I win.",
        "Paige: How are you?",
        "David: Well, I'm better, now that I'm out of jail.",
        "Paige: Is this nightmare ever going to end?",
        "David: Actually, Spencer's reign of terror is almost over.",
        "Spencer: Well, well, well. Lookie what we have here.",
        "David: Spencer, I shot and killed a man. I'm guilty. No amount of help is going to change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I got to tell Bo.",
        "Todd: You'd better be calling a cab.",
        "Blair: Todd? When did you get home?",
        "Todd: Last night. Yeah, you probably missed , out with your boyfriend. Yeah, I moved back in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Some hick from nowhere-ville steps up and they take his word over yours?",
        "Bo: The mayor says that he's going to appoint a temporary commissioner sometime later this week.",
        "Rex: This doesn't make any sense. Well, what about motive? Anybody bother to ask why you would even care about setting up Manning?",
        "Bo: I'll tell you, Balsom, motive really isn't much of an issue because Manning and I do have quite a history. What's important here is that all these charges -- they're bogus, and I'm going to beat them. It's just a matter of time.",
        "Rex: How can they force you out after everything you've done for this town? Wait -- is Hughes the one driving this?",
        "Bo: No. This is my call. Look, after everything that happened with Colson, the last thing that Llanview needs is another high-profile -- scandal going on, all right? I talked to the mayor -- on the phone. I could even hear in his little voice that he was really sweating bullets. He was going to make a move, so I just beat him to the punch, that's all.",
        "Rex: This is messed up. Bo I know, but that's why it's important that I step back now. Because the longer this takes, the -- the harder it's going to be to really focus on finding out who framed Manning.",
        "Rex: Spencer Truman. Damn him.",
        "Bo: Balsom, you let the police handle this.",
        "Rex: I'm not going to sit back and let Truman do this to you.",
        "Bo: You know, I thought you had a lot on your plate right now. What, Claudia Reston -- she doesn't have enough work for you to do?",
        "Rex: Ok, I know you're not happy that I'm working for her. But it's a one-time deal. She was going to hire somebody. At least this way, I know what she knows.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, yeah. When are you going to learn not to get burned by trying to work both ends, huh?",
        "Rex: There's no way I'm going to let her hurt your family.",
        "Bo: Yeah. You know what? I wish I could believe that.",
        "Rex: Look, it is killing me that I let you down. Ok, and this, you having to step down -- it's just not good.",
        "Bo: It's temporary, that's all.",
        "Rex: It's just beyond bad Not to mention, bad news for this whole town. Especially me. I really need your help.",
        "Bo: So you have something else that I need to know about, right, Balsom? Ok. I know, this is a butterfly. But what is this?",
        "Rex: Somebody left it for Adriana, right after he attacked her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: What are you doing?",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry, darling. I didn't mean to startle you.",
        "Adriana: You scared me.",
        "Dorian: It's just that I -- I saw you from the window out here alone, looking so forlorn. Is there something wrong? Honey, you're shaking like a leaf.",
        "Rex: It could be a lot worse next time. I am not taking the chance.",
        "Adriana: What about my mother, Rex? If she found out about this --",
        "Rex: Hey, we can't handle it on our own anymore. It has gotten way too big.",
        "Dorian: Ok, talk to me.",
        "Adriana: You're right, something is wrong.",
        "Dorian: Is it something to do with Rex? Because I did see his car here last night.",
        "Adriana: Why do you always blame Rex? Don't you even care that he's been the one protecting me?",
        "Dorian: Protecting you? From what? Now you really are -- you're frightening me.",
        "Adriana: You always do this. This is why I didn't want to tell you, ok? You get hysterical.",
        "Dorian: I am not hysterical. I am very calm, ok? I just want you to tell me what's going on.",
        "Adriana: Someone broke in here last night. The guy that's been stalking me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I think he's a little sleepy. A little ti-ti, hmm?",
        "Vincent: Hey, good morning, Mary.",
        "Mary: Hi.",
        "Vincent: You're wearing your hair up.",
        "Mary: You're the first one to notice, Mr. Jones.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, well, it's very becoming.",
        "Mary: And you're becoming a regular. Cup of coffee to go, right? Light with one sugar? Vincent. Well, I think I'll have it to stay today. I have a few phone calls to make. Is this your paper?",
        "Daryl: It's all yours, Mr. Jones.",
        "Vincent: Excuse me, do we know each other?",
        "Daryl: Everybody knows Vincent Jones. Your reputation precedes you.",
        "Vincent: Huh. And what reputation might that be?",
        "Daryl: Well, that of a shrewd and successful businessman, of course. Please.",
        "Vincent: Thanks for the paper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What'd you go and do that for?",
        "Natalie: Oh -- no paper this morning.",
        "John: Then why'd you bring it up here?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Decoration?",
        "John: Oh are the bagels decoration, too?",
        "Natalie: No, you can eat those.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Natalie: You're welcome. Sleep all right last night? You were kind of fidgety.",
        "David: You looking for me? This is what you wanted, isn't it? Eye for an eye.",
        "John: I can't hear you.",
        "David: Shades of Todd Manning?",
        "John: I can't hear you. What are you trying to say to me?",
        "David: You've got the wrong guy, lieutenant. You've got the wrong guy!",
        "John: I slept ok.",
        "Natalie: Sure you didn't have any bad dreams about beating up Vincent Jones?",
        "John: Not that I remember.",
        "Natalie: I still feel really bad that I kept that from you.",
        "John: Forget about it, all right? Just stay clear of that guy and we won't have any problems.",
        "Natalie: Fine by me. So, to change the subject --",
        "John: Oh, boy.",
        "Natalie: You know, I've got to get all these hours of fieldwork --",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Natalie: For my forensic class, and --",
        "John: And?",
        "Natalie: I was wondering if I could shadow you on one of your cases.",
        "John: Not going to happen.",
        "Natalie: Why not?",
        "John: Not going to happen. Because that's business. And it doesn't mix well with this.",
        "Natalie: We do all the time.",
        "John: This is different. Uh-uh-uh. No cell phone, no paper.",
        "Natalie: Fine. Like, five minutes?",
        "John: Go ahead.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. Hello?",
        "Vincent: Miss Buchanan, I'm glad I could track you down. I need to see you right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I -- I didn't know you were being released last night.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Thought I'd come take my life back. Sleep my own bed. Ah. When was the last time I did that? Oh, yeah, that's right. It was right before I was arrested for a murder I didn't commit. Miss me?",
        "Blair: Of course I did.",
        "Todd: Yeah, of course. Yeah, I felt that as I was lying alone in our bed.",
        "Blair: Come on, Todd, don't do this, please.",
        "Todd: Don't do what?",
        "Blair: Look, you don't understand. Last night, I wasn't --",
        "Todd: You weren't what? With Spencer? Oh, what's the matter, cat got your tongue? It's a pretty simple question. Were you with Spencer last night, yes or no?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Todd: There, you see? It's not so difficult, is it? Now get the hell out of my house. Did you hear what I said? Get out, now.",
        "Blair: Come on, Todd, don't be like this. We loved each other once, and I still love you.",
        "Todd: Oh, you still love me, do you? But you continue to sleep with what's-his-name? The guy that tried to get me killed?",
        "Blair: You can't prove Spencer did anything. S, I'm -- I'm with Spencer now. But it doesn't mean that I've stopped caring about you, Todd.",
        "Todd: Well, care about me somewhere else. You just make me want to puke, you know that? Get out.",
        "Blair: Ok. I just have to get some things.",
        "Todd: No, whatever you need to get, I'll send to you.",
        "Blair: The kids are over at Dorian's, and they're going to need their clothes for tomorrow.",
        "Todd: You listen to me now. You are out of your mind if you think I'm going to let Spencer Truman anywhere near my kids. Starr and Jack are going to live with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: I'm truly hurt, David.",
        "David: You're also ugly. Next complaint?",
        "Spencer: You know, I really thought we'd gotten through all this nastiness, you know? I mean, I bailed you out of jail, I offered to help you with this whole Thomas McBain mess, and the first thing you do is run to my ex-wife to try to plot my downfall. I mean, that is very disappointing.",
        "David: I already told you, Spencer, I'm getting out from under. I want my life back.",
        "Spencer: Well, we all want the same things, don't we, David? And if you two had any brain cells to rub together, then you would both keep your mouths shut and let me help.",
        "David: Spencer, I'm entering a plea of guilty. It's over.",
        "Paige: And I've already told the truth about what I did. You've got no hold over either one of us anymore.",
        "Spencer: Well, I only have two words for you -- \"Bo Buchanan.\"",
        "Paige: David, could you give me a minute alone with your brother? I'll be fine.",
        "Spencer: Hey, Dave, you know, in spite of all the bad blood between us, I really don't want to see you spend the next 20 years in jail. I mean, I bailed you out, right? I mean, I really am trying to help, if you would only let me.",
        "Paige: That almost sounded sincere.",
        "Spencer: That doesn't mean I'm going soft. And if you have any sincere feelings for Bo Buchanan -- if you truly care about him --",
        "Paige: Just save it, you bastard. I told Bo everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: The creep took off before I had a chance to catch my breath.",
        "Bo: When were you going to call us in on this, Balsom? After one of you got hurt, huh? Or worse?",
        "Rex: I came in now. You're the only one Adriana wants me to talk to about this.",
        "Bo: Well, I can't do you much good without my badge, can I?",
        "Rex: So, what do I do?",
        "Bo: I say you turn that over to John McBain. He's the best cop I know. He'll take care of it for you.",
        "Rex: Oh -- Adriana wanted to keep this quiet.",
        "Bo: Hey, you can trust John, all right? I'll tell you what. You don't try to take this stalker on yourself, though. He's already committed assault, breaking and entering. He's working his way up. You let the police handle it. Hey, look at me. I don't want anything to happen to you, Balsom, you got that?",
        "Rex: I need to get back to Adriana.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Rex: They need to get you back on as Commissioner before this whole town bites it. And I don't care how good McBain is. You're the best cop I know. And best man.",
        "Bo: Thanks kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: This isn't a good time right now.",
        "Vincent: It's a perfect time. And I suggest that we leave your boyfriend out of it.",
        "Natalie: So what do you need?",
        "Vincent: We can discuss that when you get here. I'm at the Angel Square Diner. 15 minutes?",
        "Natalie: No, that's impossible.",
        "Vincent: I don't believe in impossible. And as this is in everyone's best interest, I know you'll find a way to get here. Unless you want me to offer my invitation again -- say, in front of your boyfriend? See you in 15 minutes.",
        "John: Who was that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, you may be able to kick me out of here, but there's no way in hell you're going to take my kids, you got that?",
        "Todd: Hmm. I'm surprised you haven't moved them in with Spencer already.",
        "Blair: I told you, they're at Dorian's! Do you listen to me?",
        "Todd: I wonder what a judge would say, Blair. You pawning your children off on some relative while you whore it up at the palace hotel.",
        "Blair: I may have failed you, Todd, but I have always been there for our children. And I have custody.",
        "Todd: For now.",
        "Blair: Hasn't this family seen enough courts, enough judges? I told you, you can see the kids whenever you want.",
        "Todd: I want them away from Spencer Truman.",
        "Blair: I'm not going to move in with Spencer! I'm not. I'm telling you that right now. Not now, not ever!",
        "Todd: Don't make promises you can't keep, Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: And that's when we found the dead butterfly.",
        "Dorian: Adriana -- oh, we -- how in the world could you not have told me?",
        "Adriana: I was afraid you'd overreact.",
        "Dorian: Overreact? To what? The fact that my daughter is being stalked by a lunatic? That you were attacked right here in your very own backyard, as it were? I'm going to fire the security force right away. I mean, Jack and Starr were in the house then. And you -- you must be traumatized. You said you got hit on the head. Maybe you've got a concussion.",
        "Adriana: Mom, please, stop it, ok? I was more worried about Rex. He almost drowned trying to protect me.",
        "Dorian: And I'm very glad he didn't drown, but my main concern is you.",
        "Adriana: I see. As long as Rex is on the unsuitable boyfriends list, it's ok if he gets killed.",
        "Dorian: No, of course not, darling. I'm very happy that he was here with you last night.",
        "Adriana: Huh. Yeah, right.",
        "Dorian: What do you want me to do, write it in blood? I will thank him the very next time I see him.",
        "Adriana: Here's your chance.",
        "Dorian: Well, Rex. What in the hell were you thinking, not telling me that my daughter is being stalked by a lunatic?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Do you want one of these? They're really good. Look.",
        "Michael: I can't believe they haven't tried to contact us yet.",
        "Marcie: Who?",
        "Michael: Child services. It's a little strange they haven't called.",
        "Marcie: Uh, yeah. You know, actually, they -- they called this morning. What do you want?",
        "Michael: Really? What'd they say?",
        "Marcie: Oh, something about a potential family wanting to meet Tommy. Yes.",
        "Michael: When, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Um -- I think it was sometime today, but I told them we were busy. You know, we have so much to do.",
        "Michael: Busy doing what? I have the day off. Marcie, we have nothing to do.",
        "Marcie: Yes, we have lots of things to do, Michael. We have to go shopping, we have errands to run.",
        "Michael: Shopping?",
        "Marcie: Yes, shopping. Do you believe how much of this he drank? Look, this is such a hungry little guy, weren't you? Yes, you were.",
        "Michael: What shopping, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: We have to go to save-more today.",
        "Michael: We can go tomorrow.",
        "Marcie: No, we can't go tomorrow. We can't go tomorrow because we have to buy paper towels and --",
        "Michael: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: And there's coffee, you know. We only have instant. You hate instant.",
        "Michael: So we'll go to the corner store, we'll pick up some coffee, some paper towels. It'll take all of 10 minutes.",
        "Marcie: No, we cannot go to the corner store. They always have lines. I hate that they don't have enough people behind the counter, and it drives me crazy.",
        "Michael: Come on, Marcie, this is getting a little --",
        "Marcie: Huh. I -- I can't even believe this one. Here. You'd better take Tommy. Take Tommy.",
        "Michael: Why? Marce -- Marcie, please?",
        "Marcie: Do you have any shame? You know, I can't even believe that you can possibly show your face in public.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So that was my lab partner from my Forensics class. I totally forgot, I was supposed to meet him for this assignment.",
        "John: Ok. You got to do what you got to do.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. So I'd better go. I'm really sorry.",
        "John: No worries. Say hi to your -- your lab partner for me.",
        "Natalie: John, my heart belongs to you.",
        "John: I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Bo, I wanted to tell -- wow, you're packing.",
        "Bo: That's right. I'm stepping down as commissioner.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I know. The newspaper said it was evidence of some impropriety, and -- I know that's not true.",
        "Bo: No. No, it's not. But I'm not going to say anything about it.",
        "Blair: Who would believe that you would frame Todd, anyway? You think Spencer set you up, don't you? Hmm?",
        "Bo: Nice try, Blair.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Bo: But you're not going to get me to say anything -- except that I will tell you that this whole Nancy Drew thing that you're doing -- it's dangerous. Spencer is not going to buy it, and you're going to end up getting hurt.",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, I told you that I have to do what I have to do. Otherwise, my life is going to unravel even more than it already is. In fact, it's getting worse by the minute.",
        "Bo: What happened?",
        "Blair: Todd -- he's talking about suing for custody again.",
        "Bo: Tell him the truth.",
        "Blair: I can't, Bo! Look -- how am I going to get Spencer to open up? The only way I'm going to get him to open up is if he thinks that I'm with him. And Todd's never going to go with that.",
        "Bo: Huh. So you're doing all this for Manning, but you're pushing him further away in the process, huh?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I'm doing it for Todd, but I'm also doing it for me. Look, I'm the one that bought Spencer's act. I let him into my life, I let him into my kids' life, and I'm going to make it right. In fact, I actually already got some really good information.",
        "Bo: Nah, I don't want to hear it.",
        "Blair: Oh, I think you do, Bo. I do, yeah.",
        "Bo: No.",
        "Blair: Why? Why don't you -- because I'm not playing by your rules? I'm disobeying? Ok, you can ignore me, but it's really, really good information. I mean, really --",
        "Bo: All right, fine. Tell me, what is it?",
        "Blair: David came over to Spencer's hotel suite last night and confessed to killing John McBain's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hey, Van, it's me. Call me, please. I want to sue for custody of my children -- full custody. I want to make sure Blair never sees them again, ok? Uh -- call me back, please, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: I told Bo everything.",
        "Spencer: You're bluffing, Paige.",
        "Paige: Am I? Why don't you ask him who delivered Margaret's baby? Why don't you ask him who planted evidence to make it look like he killed Margaret?",
        "Spencer: All right, enough. It doesn't matter what you told Bo. I mean, it's your word against mine, Paige, and my hands are clean.",
        "Paige: Huh. It's over for you, Spencer. Between what David and I know, you are going to burn.",
        "Spencer: Did it ever occur to you that your and David's reputations might be an issue? I mean, do you really think anyone's going to take the word of a couple of murderers?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Not here, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: \"Not here\"? I'm sorry, where are my manners? I guess that I'm not supposed to confront a murderer in public, am I? No, no. You -- you are not out of here. You are not out of here until I tell you how much I hate you. I hate you for what you did to my husband. You've deprived him of his father, the one person -- the one person in his life who was supposed to give him a sense of security and love and support, and guess what -- Michael didn't get any of that because of you! You destroyed his family. They have suffered and they have grieved, and do you want to know the worst part of it is? The worst part of it is not because you killed his father --",
        "Michael: Marcie, enough.",
        "Marcie: Because you're a coward! No! It is not enough. I hope that you pay for what you did. You destroyed the McBain family, and you know what? You're never going to suffer half as much as they did. You made them suffer the worst possible pain imaginable!",
        "David: As -- as trite as it may sound, my heart goes out to Michael and John and to their mother. It should not have happened. Thomas McBain's death was senseless, it was a tragedy.",
        "Michael: Too little too late, Vickers.",
        "[Tommy cries]",
        "Marcie: Me on, we'll get away from him.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Todd: Vickers? Vickers, you there?",
        "David: Yes.",
        "Todd: I'm back at the penthouse. I need to see you. We have some unfinished business to settle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Stop it, Mom, ok? Do not blame Rex for any of this.",
        "Rex: That's ok, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: No, it's not ok! Rex wanted me to tell you from the beginning about the stalker, but I wouldn't let him.",
        "Dorian: I respect that. I wish he hadn't deferred to you.",
        "Adriana: Well, he did, because he knew how miserable you'd make my life. And what happened to \"thanking him the very next time I see him\"?",
        "Dorian: Rex, thank you very much for protecting my daughter.",
        "Rex: That's -- what I do.",
        "Dorian: Good. Now, no more procrastinating. We're calling the police.",
        "Rex: No, I just got back from seeing him, but he's not going to be around for a while. He's stepping down as commissioner.",
        "Dorian: What? Why?",
        "Rex: Well, it's kind of a long --",
        "Dorian: Well, never mind. Who has the time? Never mind about that. Who are we going to call? Who are we going to?",
        "Rex: I left a message for John McBain.",
        "Dorian: Ok. All right. And -- and I will hire bodyguards to -- to watch you, Adri -- yes, 24/7.",
        "Adriana: No! No bodyguards, Mom, please.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Adriana: Don't make me regret telling you about this.",
        "Dorian: Am I supposed to do nothing when my daughter is being stalked by some madman?",
        "Rex: No one's going to get near her while I'm around, I promise.",
        "Dorian: I know that I have been ambivalent about your relationship with my daughter. But I realize now that I have to accept the fact that you two have become very close in your special way, and I'm not going to fight it anymore. No. Not now when we really have something to fight here.",
        "Adriana: Oh, God, I'm late. I told Carlotta that I'd help her with Jamie this morning.",
        "Dorian: No, you are not going to leave the house.",
        "Adriana: Mom, I am not going to let this jerk keep me from living my life. Ok?",
        "Rex: I'll drive her there myself.",
        "Dorian: All right, but don't let her out of your sight. Please, stay with her.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Daryl: What's up, boss?",
        "Dorian: I need to see you right away. It's about Adriana. Oh, oh -- and I'm not at the office yet. I -- I'm still here at La Boulaie.",
        "Daryl: I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Vickers confessed to killing Thomas McBain? This is big.",
        "Blair: Yeah -- what are you doing?",
        "Bo: I'm calling John.",
        "Blair: No! No, you're not, Bo. No.",
        "Bo: What are you talking about?",
        "Blair: If Spencer finds out that I'm spying on him, no telling what he'd do!",
        "Bo: Hey, John has the right to know.",
        "Blair: No, you're not going to do this. Don't do this to me.",
        "Bo: You would let Vickers skate on a murder rap just to get back at Spencer? What about Michael and John McBain? Don't they have a right to justice, too?",
        "Blair: Look, you know that David did it. Use it to get more evidence. Just say that you got it from an anonymous witness.",
        "Bo: That wouldn't hold up in a court of law. No, we need you to testify.",
        "Blair: Well, I am not going to do it. Not yet. Now, come on, just -- just keep it quiet for me. Well, if not for me, then for my kids, please? Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You ok?",
        "Michael: Yeah. How about you? You got pretty worked up there.",
        "Marcie: Well, David hurt you. You know, he hurt you and John, and I'm sorry, but I really had to say something. Please don't be mad at me.",
        "Michael: Mad at you? Sweetie, I love you for it. Your loyalty, your amazing commitment to the people you love.",
        "Marcie: What? Why are you looking at me like that for?",
        "Michael: Marcie, I know you're falling head over heels for this baby, and that's why --",
        "Marcie: No, no, I am not. You think you know me. You know, I like you. I do, I like you a lot. Ok, fine, I am falling head over heels in love with him, but look at his face. I mean, who wouldn't, right?",
        "Michael: It's cute.",
        "Marcie: But if you're thinking what I think you're thinking -- the only reason that I told the caseworker that we couldn't meet with them today was because we have to go shopping. Did I mention it's double-coupon day?",
        "Michael: Double-coupon day, huh?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Well. We'd better get our butts over to the save-more.",
        "Marcie: Are you ready to go shopping? Yes, you are. We're going to buy you a toy!",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Yes, we are! What do we get him?",
        "Michael: Get him chocolate jellyfish.",
        "Marcie: Jellyfish? Ooh.",
        "Natalie: Oh, wait -- is this Tommy?",
        "Michael: In the flesh.",
        "Natalie: Hello. He's so cute.",
        "Marcie: Yes, and he's really good, too. He didn't make a peep at lunch time at all.",
        "Natalie: Aw.",
        "Michael: You meeting John here?",
        "Natalie: No, no, a friend.",
        "Marcie: Well, we better get going, ok?",
        "Natalie: See you later. Nice to meet you, Tommy.",
        "Michael: See you.",
        "Marcie: Bye.",
        "Michael: Get the door for me, Hon?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, sure.",
        "Natalie: All right, so I'm here. What the hell do you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I hate this, Bo -- seeing you forced out.",
        "Bo: Well, John, it's only temporary. After I prove that I didn't frame Manning, then I'll be back on the force.",
        "John: I still think you should let me beat some sense into that morgue attendant from Kentucky.",
        "Bo: Well, Hughes is on that, but thanks anyway.",
        "John: Between the two of us, we're going to find something.",
        "Bo: Hey, John, you know, you -- you got enough to think about right now.",
        "John: Still, Bo, if there's anything I can do --",
        "Bo: There's something that you need to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Where is it? Where's the satchel with my 2 million bucks?",
        "Todd: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "David: The $2 million you promised for saving your life. I hope you got large bills. I don't want to carry a turkey out of here with my back and all.",
        "Todd: Oh, as I recall, the $2 million was for evidence on Spencer.",
        "David: You're alive because of me. You're out of jail, alive. That's worth $2 million.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm alive, but I'm alone.",
        "David: Is that why you called me over here, to -- keep you company?",
        "Todd: No. I want to know where my son is. I want you to tell me what Margaret did with him.",
        "David: You give me the $2 million, I'll tell you.",
        "Todd: Tell me, I'll give you 10.",
        "David: Damn, why do they always offer to pay more when I'm bluffing? I don't know. If you want to find your kid, you're going to have to talk to Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: One minute you were offering David and me the olive branch, and the next minute you're calling us murderers.",
        "Spencer: Well, if the shoe fits --",
        "Paige: I know too much.",
        "Spencer: Oh, Paige, it's so nice to see you feeling better. It really is.",
        "Paige: Well \u0096 [Phone rings]",
        "Mr. Moore: Hello? Dr. Truman?",
        "Spencer: Oh, dear God, I pray to God you're on a pay phone.",
        "Mr. Moore: I'm doing everything just like you told me. Now, you're going to take care of my sister like you promised, right? She'll die without that operation.",
        "Spencer: Your sister's life is as good as saved.",
        "Mr. Moore: I don't like lying to the cops, especially about something like that. Even creepier than the usual stuff I deal with -- dead pregnant woman, bodies taken from the morgue.",
        "Spencer: All right, quiet. Look, this might not be a secure line. Now, listen, what are you going to do if the cops start to question you further?",
        "Mr. Moore: Mum's the word, I promise. They won't hear the truth from me.",
        "Spencer: Good man. I knew I could count on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Daryl, for goodness sake, what did you do, crawl here?",
        "Daryl: Traffic's a mess.",
        "Dorian: Listen, my daughter Adriana is being stalked. Her life is being threatened by some sociopathilunatic, and she refuses to let me hire bodyguards to watch her.",
        "Daryl: Well, what do you want me to do?",
        "Dorian: I want you to help me find someone who can watch her without being detected.",
        "Daryl: I know just the guy -- me.",
        "Dorian: Daryl, that's what you've been doing all along -- following her -- but this isn't to keep her away from her boyfriend. This is to protect her life from a stalker, for goodness sake, and I did not see \"bodyguard\" or \"surveillance expert\" on your resume.",
        "Daryl: It's the kind of skill you keep on the low.",
        "Dorian: Are you good at it?",
        "Daryl: I know six different ways to kill a man with my bare hands.",
        "Dorian: Have you ever killed someone?",
        "Daryl: Not yet, but I'm open to new experiences.",
        "Dorian: Good. Follow my daughter, and protect her from this lunatic. I have to make some phone calls. Excuse me.",
        "Daryl: Nice work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So what was so important that you had to order me around like I'm one of your employees?",
        "Vincent: Well, was it not very gracious of me to lead you to the man who killed McBain's father?",
        "Natalie: Your point?",
        "Vincent: I thought of a way that you can thank me for my efforts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What do you want to tell me?",
        "Bo: I talked to someone who heard Vickers confess to shooting your father.",

        "Spencer: Right. I'll be in touch. Hey, how are you?",
        "Blair: Hi.",
        "Spencer: This is a nice surprise. What's going on?",
        "Blair: I -- I wanted to let you know that the kids and I will be at Dorian's until we find a place of our own.",
        "Spencer: What about the penthouse?",
        "Blair: Well, it -- you know, it was Todd's, and now that he's out of the hospital, he -- um -- he kicked me out.",
        "Spencer: Oh, Blair, I'm so sorry. Listen, you don't have to go to Dorian's. You -- you and the kids could move in with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Spencer knows where my son is?",
        "David: He stashed Margaret in Thailand. He probably knows where your kid is. I'm telling you Spencer's your guy, but you didn't hear that from me. So now that I've been helpful yet again, what do you say -- give me 1 million, we'll call it even.",
        "Todd: Forget it.",
        "David: Blair really picked a winner.",
        "Todd: Yeah -- Spencer. And that's going to cost her, but it's nothing compared to what I'm going to do to your brother.",
        "David: A grudge match between you and Spencer? Why do I see all of Llanview burning? I'll tell you one thing -- when this whole thing's over, only one of you will be left standing.",

        "Matthew: Grandpa, are you going to die?",
        "Antonio: I've got some news about Norman Leeds.",
