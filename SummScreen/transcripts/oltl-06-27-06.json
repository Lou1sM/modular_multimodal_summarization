He suggests that they talk about this another time over dinner maybe. She reminds him that she is seeing someone. He doesn't care. He promises not to tell if she doesn't. Spencer tells Blair to move in with him. She says that she can't. Her kids are confused and she doesn't want Todd to get angrier than he is. He is thinking of suing for custody.

        "Jessica: Hello.",
        "Antonio: Did you miss me? Because I missed you and your mommy.",
        "Jessica: Mmm. Well, we missed you, too. But I'm really happy that you and Jamie had some one-on-one time.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, it was nice.",
        "Jessica: So what did you do?",
        "Antonio: Oh, we -- we colored and we played go fish. And we read some picture books.",
        "Jessica: No fair. Me and Brennan always miss the go stuff. Well, so where is she?",
        "Antonio: Oh, my mom's picking her up from preschool.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Antonio: I was hoping that maybe you and I could have a minute alone to talk.",
        "[Brennan coos]",
        "Jessica: Why, what's wrong? Shh, shh, shh.",
        "Antonio: I've got some news about Norman Leeds.",
        "Jessica: Oh, God, he's not going to get better, is he?",
        "[Brennan fusses]",
        "Antonio: He's dead, Jess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: I know you're so anxious to show your gratitude, so I thought of a way that you can thank me for my efforts. For helping you track down Tom McBain's killer?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know what I'm supposed to be eternally grateful for, Vincent. No need to remind me. So lay it on me. How do I help you? How do I thank you?",
        "Vincent: Well, you're into forensics work, right? So I'm assuming that you'll be dealing with a lot of dead bodies.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, so?",
        "Vincent: So, I was hoping that you can tell me how to commit the perfect murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: If Vickers confessed to shooting my father, I want to know who heard it. Bo, just give me a name.",
        "Bo: I can't. I'm sorry, John, but I can't tell you who it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You want me to move in with you?",
        "Spencer: Well, we have been seeing each other for quite a few months, and it just seems like the next logical step in our relationship.",
        "Blair: Oh, well, I can't. I can't move in with you, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: Well, why not?",
        "Blair: Because of Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Can I get you anything?",
        "Evangeline: No.",
        "Todd: Something to drink, something to eat?",
        "Evangeline: I'm great.",
        "Todd: Okay. I want to get started right away on this custody suit.",
        "Evangeline: I know exactly what you want. But if you think I'm going to help you rip those beautiful children away from their mother, you better think again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You'd think that the suntan lotion would make these things go on a little easier.",
        "Starr: Isn't he a little too big for those?",
        "Kelly: Look, I'm just doing what your mom told me to do.",
        "Jack: Can I go in now?",
        "Kelly: Yeah, but stay in the shallow end so I can keep an eye on you, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Kelly: Look, I know you're bummed out about having to be here, but your mom's just doing what she thinks is best.",
        "Starr: My mom's best is pawning us off on her family so that she could be with Dr. Dirtbag.",
        "Kelly: Oh, Starr, please don't talk about Spencer that way. It's disrespectful.",
        "Starr: You want me to respect that jerk? He set my dad up and sent him to death row.",
        "Kelly: You don't know that.",
        "Starr: Yes, I do. That's what my dad told me. I believed my dad when he was innocent, and I believe what he says about dr. Truman.",
        "Kelly: It's not that simple.",
        "Starr: Why does my mom have to be this stupid? Why can't she just break up with Dr. Truman so that she can be with my dad?",
        "Kelly: You can't control your feelings. You can't help who you fall in love with.",
        "Starr: My mom said that she was in love with Dr. Truman? Did she tell you that?",
        "Kelly: No. No, it's just that she obviously has feelings for him.",
        "Starr: This sucks so bad.",
        "Kelly: Look, your mom and dad had problems way before Dr. Truman came to town.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but they always worked them out because they love each other.",
        "Kelly: I just don't want you to get your hopes up, hoping that your mom and dad might get back together, because it might not happen this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're siding with Blair over me?",
        "Evangeline: I didn't risk my life and my career to help you just to turn my back on you now.",
        "Todd: I have no idea what that means.",
        "Evangeline: I'm trying to save you from yourself.",
        "Todd: I don't need saving. I'm the same person I was before the execu-- I'm the old Todd. He's back.",
        "Evangeline: Apparently. Yeah, I got -- I got your voicemail message, Todd. \"I need to talk to you right a I -- I want to sue for custody of the kids -- full custody. I want you to fix it so that Blair never sees the children again.\" I mean, do you ever listen to yourself talk? I mean, stop and listen to what you say? Because I actually listen to you. And what I hear is pain and torment and hatred. To want a mother never to see her children again? A good and caring mother? Those children are Blair's just as much as they are yours. They need her, and she needs them. But you told me that you want me to help you take them away from her. No, you're right. That is the old Todd talking, and I don't want to have anything to do with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: You're saying you can't move in with me because of Todd? Blair, do you have any idea how silly that sounds? I mean, is there something you're not telling me, like you're still in love with him?",
        "Blair: No, of course not.",
        "Spencer: What is it, then?",
        "Blair: I told you, he kicked me out of the penthouse. He hates me.",
        "Spencer: And how does that keep you from moving forward with your life and forming something more permanent with me?",
        "Blair: That's exactly what Todd thinks that I'm going to do. Look, he's just looking for ammunition to -- to try to take the kids away from me. He's going to sue for custody, and I think staying at Dorian's is the best thing for us. And your little suite is too small for the four of us, anyway.",
        "Spencer: We'll get a bigger one.",
        "Blair: Spencer, I just explained --",
        "Spencer: Blair, it's the 21st century. Do you really think moving in with me is going to hurt your chances of keeping your kids?",
        "Blair: Well, yeah, I -- it could.",
        "Spencer: Why? Because we're living in sin? Come on.",
        "Blair: Well, yes. I mean, a judge might not use those exact words, but -- but, yeah.",
        "Spencer: All right. I can see your point. I -- I guess that's why I love you. If it's going to pose a problem for you, then -- of course, there is a very simple solution to all this.",
        "Blair: Yeah? What?",
        "Spencer: Marry me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Is it Paige? Did she tell you?",
        "Bo: Nah, come on, John.",
        "John: Why can't you tell me who heard Vickers confess?",
        "Blair: What are you doing?",
        "Bo: I'm calling John.",
        "Blair: No! No, you're not, Bo! No.",
        "Bo: What are you talking about?",
        "Blair: If Spencer finds out that I'm spying on him, no telling what he'd do.",
        "Bo: Hey, John has the right to know.",
        "Blair: No! No, you're not going to do this! Don't do this to me.",
        "Bo: If I told you who told me, then I would be compromising their safety.",
        "John: Is it someone I know or a stranger?",
        "Bo: I can't say.",
        "John: Then why'd you tell me in the first place, Bo?",
        "Bo: Because it's your father, John. You have the right to know that we are looking at the right guy.",
        "John: You just won't help me take him down.",
        "Bo: No, I am helping you. I gave you information that they don't know we have. You can use that.",
        "John: How?",
        "Bo: It's going to keep you from spinning your wheels, following leads that are going to take you absolutely nowhere. All right? And I'm going to -- I'll keep you up to speed on anything that I hear.",
        "John: Who's helping me, Bo? All right? For that matter, why do we even need help if we already got Vickers? I mean, why does someone need to keep digging?",
        "Bo: Because they don't set bail on somebody that we know we can bury. What we have on Vickers right now -- it's very thin. If the right lawyer comes along, gets the right jury, Vickers could take a walk.",
        "John: It's not going to happen.",
        "Bo: All right, let me ask you -- are you willing to let Spencer Truman walk just to nail Vickers? Yeah, that's what I thought. Right now, we might be able to get Spencer on obstruction. We know he's been driving Vickers and Paige for 25 years. And I have my own personal reasons to want to bring that guy down.",
        "John: I thought you were -- I thought you were off the job.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, with Paige involved in this, I've got more than just the job on my mind right now. I'm going to follow this new information, all right? It's going to take some time. But until I get this all wrapped up, I'm not going to be able to tell you who's feeding me information, okay? You're going to have to trust me.",
        "John: You know I trust you. If there's one thing I hate, it's when people -- when friends start keeping secrets from one another.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I am not going to help you commit murder.",
        "Vincent: Who's planning on killing anyone?",
        "Natalie: Well, you just said --",
        "Vincent: I'm just asking out of curiosity.",
        "Natalie: So you forced me down here to talk about forensics work? You know what, honey? I'll just -- I'll have the school send you a catalog. I'm out of here.",
        "Vincent: I forced you here?",
        "Natalie: I don't have time to sit in a diner and talk forensics shop with you, okay?",
        "Vincent: You know, I can respect that. You're a busy woman. I'm a busy man. Let's do this another time -- say, over dinner.",
        "Natalie: Are you asking me out on a date?",
        "Vincent: Why not?",
        "Natalie: Because I'm seeing someone, that's why not.",
        "Vincent: John McBain.",
        "Natalie: Yes.",
        "Vincent: So, I won't tell if you don't.",
        "Natalie: Do you have a death wish or something? You saw how crazy John got the other night.",
        "Vincent: Then that means you'll think about it?",
        "Natalie: No. No, I am not going to have dinner with you, and I am not going to keep anything from John.",
        "Vincent: Then McBain knows that you're here with me now?",
        "Natalie: No. But because you warned me not to tell him.",
        "Vincent: But you're the one that lied to him.",
        "Natalie: Okay, well, I'm not lying anymore. I'm not. And I am sure as hell not going out on a date with you.",
        "Vincent: Relax. I promise you, romance is not part of this. And my proposal is strictly friendly.",
        "Natalie: Really?",
        "Vincent: Really. I had a very interesting evening with Layla Williamson the other night. And I'm curious to see where that's going.",
        "Natalie: Okay, well, then the best of luck to you. We're done here.",
        "Vincent: Though I find it very interesting that you were so eager to call it a date. Perhaps maybe you're secretly attracted to me?",
        "Natalie: There is only one man for me, and that's John.",
        "Vincent: Well, that hasn't always been true. What about my fighter?",
        "Natalie: Okay, I'm not talking about my ex-husband with you -- or anyone else. We're done",
        "Vincent: I don't think we're done, Natalie. It's only a matter of time before you come back to me. I won't even have to ask. Huh.",
        "Natalie: That's not going to happen. So why don't you do me a favor? Lose my number. Don't call me again.",
        "[Vincent laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: John, you need to trust that I've got your back. Understand it. Hey, I've got to go pick up Matthew. I'm going to take him to the hospital so he can visit Asa. And -- plus, I want to -- want to drop in to see Paige. I don't know when I'm going to be getting back, so can you hold down the fort while I'm gone?",
        "John: You got it, boss.",
        "John: Hey, Bo? You're going to have your badge back before you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Marry you?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, it's perfect. It's the perfect solution, Blair. It would make me the happiest man in the world.",
        "Blair: Well, Spencer -- gosh. That is -- that's so sweet. And it's -- it's tempting.",
        "Spencer: No, wait a minute, it's perfect. Why do we have to wait about this? It would allow you to maintain custody of your children. It would be like a dream come true for me.",
        "Blair: Well, my kids -- that's just it. It's -- this has been a terrible time for them. It's -- you know, they had to say goodbye to their father. It's been traumatic. And -- well, I just think it's too soon.",
        "Spencer: Do you think Jack wouldn't love the idea? Honestly? And Starr, you know, she would come around in time. You know that.",
        "Blair: Well, you're probably right about that -- in time -- but right now, it's -- she's -- look, I'm not getting along well with Starr, and she really doesn't like the idea of us together. And the fact that we would, you know, get married -- it would -- I just don't want to do anything that would push her over the edge. Well -- I really -- it -- I think it's me. I -- I -- I need time right now, okay? So just don't pressure me on this.",
        "Spencer: No pressure.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So you were in the room when he died?",
        "Antonio: The nightmare's over, honey.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. No, no, it's not. Because Tess is still with me, and she can come out at any time and stake claim on her baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa: Oh, hey. Matthew, how long have you been here?",
        "Matthew: I just got here. I didn't want to wake you up.",
        "Asa: Oh, oh. I -- I was -- I was just resting my eyes.",
        "Matthew: That's what my dad says when he falls asleep in front of the TV. Except he snores.",
        "[Asa chuckles]",
        "Asa: Back up a little bit.",
        "Matthew: Why?",
        "Asa: I just want to get a good look at you. You are the next generation of Buchanans. You're going to take my place one day.",
        "Matthew: Grandpa, are you going to die?",
        "Nurse: Hi, Mr. Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Carol.",
        "Carol: Matthew's with your father.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I know, thanks. Hey, how's my dad doing today?",
        "Carol: He's just fine.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, thanks for taking such good care of him. Because I know that can be a challenge.",
        "[Carol chuckles]",
        "Carol: Mr. Buchanan and I get along just fine. We make each other laugh.",
        "Bo: Well, good. That's -- that's the right medicine, isn't it?",
        "Carol: Yeah.",
        "Bo: I'm going to see him in a little while, but I want Matthew to have a little more alone time with his granddad.",
        "Carol: Yeah. That's good.",
        "Bo: I'll see you.",
        "Carol: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: This is our baby, Jess. Okay? And once you recover all your memories, Tess will be gone, and we can raise our children in peace.",
        "Jessica: Hmm, Tess gone -- huh. I wish that that could happen. And what about Nash? Do you really think that he's going to give up hope of raising his daughter?",
        "Antonio: Why don't you let me deal with Nash?",
        "Jessica: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Antonio: It means that, honey, I don't want you worrying about this right now. Okay? I -- I want you to focus on yourself, on getting better.",
        "Jessica: I love you.",

        "Jessica: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Antonio: She's doing so good at school.",
        "Jessica: Oh, that's so good to hear. I missed her so much.",
        "Antonio: Oh, hey, come here. Come here, I'll show you something. Come on. She's sleeping, right, so you can -- you can say hi to her later, but isn't she beautiful? Just like you.",
        "Carlotta: Antonio is so proud of his girls.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Well, they're both really lucky to have him as a dad.",
        "Carlotta: Jessica, that baby -- she is Antonio's child in his heart. Where it matters. And believe me; I know very well that it's not biology that makes a father or a mother. It's the love a person has in their heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Oh, I should just take the damn test. It's better to know.",
        "Jack: Hi, Mom.",
        "Blair: Hey, bud. Kelly, thanks for watching the kids again.",
        "Kelly: Sure.",
        "Blair: I really appreciate it.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I -- I got to spend some time with Starr, and --",
        "Blair: Yeah?",
        "Kelly: You know, Jack's happy as long as there [a few words missing]..",
        "Blair: Yeah. Well, you're going to be a great mom someday. I'm sorry. I know that it's not even time for you to think about that. I didn't mean to be insensitive.",
        "Kelly: It's fine. I took it as a compliment.",
        "Blair: Well, that's exactly how I meant it, okay? Hey, you cold? Got some big news. Your dad's out of the hospital and -- and back at the penthouse.",
        "Starr: Can we go visit him? Come on, let's go!",
        "Blair: What's wrong, Jack?",
        "Jack: Does he still have to wear that orange suit?",
        "Blair: No, he doesn't.",
        "Jack: Is he in hospital clothes?",
        "Starr: No, Jack, he's back home, and he's back to normal.",
        "Jack: What about Spencer?",
        "Starr: Would you stop mentioning his name? He's not our dad, and he's not even related to us. Why do you have to be such a moron?",
        "Blair: Starr Manning, you stop it right now! Don't talk to your brother like that! And I want you to apologize to him.",
        "Starr: Why should I apologize to him? He should be the one apologizing to me! He brings up Spencer's name when -- when --",

        "Starr: Dad just got out of --",
        "Blair: I mean it.",
        "Starr: I don't want to talk anymore, okay? I just want to go home.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm sorry, that is not going to happen, all right? The penthouse is your father's home. And for at least right now, you, Jack, and me are going to stay here at Aunt Dorian's, got it?",

        "Todd: Ticked off.",
        "Evangeline: Outraged, hurt, disappointed? Maybe even bitter, but all this aggression?",
        "Todd: I am so sick of being jerked around! I get jerked around from this person and this person! I am so sick of being played for a fool! The people in this town used to fear me. Used to envy me. Used to hate me, and I want them to again. I want them to see me and say \"Todd Manning -- look out, he's a force to be reckoned with.\" I'm going to reclaim my life. And I'm going to start with my children. Now, are you going to help me do that or not?",
        "Evangeline: No. I will not help you do that.",
        "Todd: Fantastic. So you've turned on me, too? That's a big surprise.",
        "Evangeline: Is this what you do, Todd? What, you push people in a corner, and then you cry \"poor me\" when they walk out of your life? Fine! But I'm not going to help you put your children through any more hell, and I'm not going to indulge your stupid little revenge fantasy. You were given a second chance at life, and I would like to help you make the most of it.",
        "Todd: Yeah? You're going to help me? When was the last time you actually were able to help me? Let's see, what did you get me? Convicted. And what did you get me? Sentenced to death. I mean, were you freaking blind through all that stuff, too? Yeah, I can't wait for you to help me.",

        "John: I kind of figured as much. So you want to tell me what's so important you felt the need to lie to me about going to see Vincent Jones?",
        "Natalie: John, I don't want you to freak out.",
        "John: I'm not going to freak out. Why'd you go see him?",
        "Natalie: He called me. He kind of pressured me into seeing him.",
        "John: Okay. I'll reword the question. Why did he want to see you?",
        "Natalie: He wanted to ask me about my job. He wanted to know about forensics work.",
        "John: That's the best you can do?",
        "Natalie: I thought it was lame, too, but that's what he wanted.",
        "John: It's lame, all right.",
        "Natalie: And also --",
        "John: And also what?",
        "Natalie: He asked me out to dinner. But of course I told him no. I basically told him to go to hell.",
        "John: Here we go again.",
        "Natalie: I blew it, didn't I? Look, John, I'm sorry. I know that I shouldn't have kept this from you. But I owed him one. And I felt like with everything that's going on -- with Uncle Bo and David Vickers -- I didn't want to upset you more.",
        "John: I just got done telling Bo how much I hate it when people are deceptive with one another.",
        "Natalie: Why did that come up?",
        "John: First, let's get one thing straight. You ever lie to me like that again, we're done, you got it?",
        "John: Someone heard Vickers confess to shooting my father. Bo won't tell me who heard it. Obviously, he's -- he's protecting someone.",
        "Natalie: Well, John, you -- you know my uncle wouldn't do -- do that without good reason. So, I mean, he's obviously working something.",
        "John: Yeah. But, you know, Bo has got so much on his plate right now, I don't want to add to his stress. I'll tell you one thing, I'm going to do everything I can to try to clear his name. There is no way that Truman's going to get away with what he's done to him.",
        "Natalie: I'm in. I want to help.",

        "Asa: Everybody's going to die, Matthew. Living -- that's what's important.",
        "Matthew: But you haven't taught me to ride yet. You promised.",
        "Asa: And I will. I'm going to throw you on a horse, whack it in the rump, and watch you take off. Worked for your father, all your uncles. Believe it or not, even little Jessie. You fall off, you get right back up. No need to be scared.",
        "Matthew: I get scared all the time.",
        "Asa: Really? So do I. I -- I'm scared right now.",
        "Matthew: Of what?",
        "Asa: Oh, being in this bed, all cooped up. You know, being brave doest mean that you'll never be scared. You just cannot let it stop what you're doing.",
        "Matthew: My dad told me something like that when my mom first got sick.",
        "[Asa chuckles]",
        "Asa: Boy, you've got something to live up to, Matthew. A hell of a legacy. And I'm counting on you, boy, to make this family proud of you.",

        "Bo: I'll wait outside.",
        "Spencer: I'm really sorry to hear about your legal problems, Commissioner. I really am. If there's anything at all I can do --",

        "Todd: Okay. I'm sorry. I am so sorry for what I just said to you. I don't know why I said that. No, that's not true. I do know why I said that. I'm just so angry. I'm so angry, and -- and I took it out on you, and I'm so sorry. What I said was shameful and stupid and hurtful. And you're the last person I want to hurt. You are the last person I want to hurt, do you understand me?",

        "Blair: I sent Jack back inside because I didn't want him to hear me say this. Look at me, Starr. I'm not going to tolerate that kind of language. And I'm not going to let you disrespect me like that. I don't care how mad or angry you are at me. It doesn't matter. I'm still your mother, and I get to decide where you live. You got it?",
        "Starr: I'll go to the judge and tell him that I want to live with my father.",
        "Kelly: Starr, your mother's just trying to do what's best for you. Through all of this, I have always heard her say that you and Jack are the most important things in the world to her.",
        "Starr: I'm not trying to hurt my mom, okay? I just -- I miss Dad.",
        "Blair: Sweetie, I know you do. I know you do. And I know he misses you, too. But it's complicated right now. Very, very complicated. And you have to trust me that I am going to do the right thing, okay?",
        "Starr: I can't. Not when you pick Spencer over Dad.",
        "Blair: But I didn't, and I haven't, and I won't. I promise you.",
        "Starr: You don't? So you're going to break up with Dr. Spencer? Are you going to get back with Dad? I didn't think so.",

        "Todd: You name it, it's yours.",
        "Evangeline: I want you to admit that you still love Blair.",
        "Todd: Why is it so important to you?",
        "Evangeline: Just say it, Todd. It's a simple admission.",
        "Todd: But why?",
        "Evangeline: \"I still love Blair.\" That's all I need to hear.",
        "Todd: Why do you care?",
        "Evangeline: You can't figure that out? Because if you admit that you still love her, you will stop trying to dream up ways to hurt her, and maybe you'll start dealing with your real feelings.",
        "Todd: I cannot get past the fact that she chose Spencer Truman over her own -- I thought she was stronger than that. I thought what we had together was stronger. So if you want me to say I love her, I'm sorry, I can't, because I don't. I mean, is that -- does that mean you're not going to forgive me for what I said?",
        "Evangeline: No, I know you didn't mean it.",

        "Starr: Dad, are you really home?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm standing right here, honey.",
        "Starr: Mom's being so mean. She says that we have to live here with Aunt Dorian. She won't let us come home.",
        "Todd: Don't worry about it. I'll be right there. That was Starr. She wants me to come get her.",
        "Evangeline: Ah, and you're going to go over to Dorian's house loaded for bear.",
        "Todd: Uh -- I'm going to handle it my way.",
        "Evangeline: Is that the old Todd talking?",

        "Spencer: You know, Commissioner, your accusations are just about as baseless and pathetic as Manning's.",
        "Bo: Is that right?",
        "Spencer: Everybody knows, Commissioner. You can't blame this fiasco on me. Everybody knows that you and Manning have been going at it for years. You saw your opportunity to get rid of him, and you took it.",
        "Bo: I know what you did, Truman, and I'm going to prove it. And then I'm going to bury you.",

        "Matthew: You mean, you were poor?",
        "Asa: Yep. I was a cowboy with -- with just a horse. Oil was struck on the ranch not far from where I was working. And I was as smart as you. And I took off and went to work in those oil fields. And I worked hard. And I learned as much as I could. Huh, before you knew it, I owned that damn ranch and all the oil underneath it. And now Clint and Kevin -- they run my company. But I keep an eye on them. But I'll tell you, the boys are doing a fine job. But don't you ever tell them I said that.",
        "Matthew: I won't.",
        "Asa: You know, Matthew, the oil business has been very good for me. But if there's something -- something else that you want to do, like, say, maybe you want to be a doctor, or a lawyer, like your mom, or president of these United States -- this family will back you. And you will not -- I'll say it again -- you will not fail.",
        "Matthew: Being a Buchanan -- it's a big deal.",
        "Asa: Well, it's the only deal in town as far as I'm concerned. You're quite a boy. What I meant to say, Matthew -- I love you.",

        "Antonio: Okay. Thank you. Hey. What's going on?",

        "Antonio: At Leeds' place?",

        "Spencer: Todd -- he's a vindictive bastard, all right, yeah. Just can't really seem to handle the fact that Blair's in love with me, that she chose me over him.",
