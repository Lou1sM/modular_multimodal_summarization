        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: My mother is driving me nuts. I never should have told her about the stalker.",
        "Rex: Well, she's worried about you. And in this case, she may --",
        "Adriana: Don't say it, Rex.",
        "Rex: Be -- you know I'm no fan of Dorian's. But it makes me feel better knowing she's watching you when I'm not around. Once I bring McBain in on this, you'll be covered.",
        "Adriana: Thank you for doing this.",
        "Rex: Well, I'm not done yet. Not till I make sure this creep never gets near you again.",
        "Adriana: What if you can't stop him?",
        "Rex: Why would you say that?",
        "Adriana: I did some research on the internet. 77% of stalking victims know their stalker.",
        "Rex: You're kidding.",
        "Adriana: Rex, do you think this guy could be somebody I know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Where the hell have you been?",
        "Claudia: I was out savoring the grapes.",
        "Nash: The grapes?",
        "Claudia: What's your problem?",
        "Nash: You were gone for over an hour. I got to know if you're on board or not before anything goes down. Oh.",
        "Claudia: I told you, if you can prove my father threatened Brennan's life, then yes, I will help you stop him.",
        "Nash: Oh, good. Well, if it's proof you need, the proof is just about to walk into that door. So are we going to have a deal, or not?",
        "Claudia: If my father is capable of threatening a baby, then yes, of course I'll help you. Deal?",
        "Nash: Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Wow.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my goodness, what's all this?",
        "Antonio: Wow.",
        "Clint: Well, there's been so much going on lately that we haven't had the time to officially welcome our granddaughter into the family.",
        "Viki: Yeah, we thought a little celebration might be in order. And hopefully, nothing will get in the way.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Clint, I'm so glad to find you at home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It's all right.",
        "Starr: Dad -- oh.",
        "Todd: Hey, what's happening?",
        "Jack: Mom, will you and Daddy hate each other forever?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well, maybe you do know the guy. Can you think of anyone sick enough to do this?",
        "Adriana: No, no one.",
        "Rex: Well, it could be somebody you don't really notice. The dry cleaner, some kid in the mail room at work.",
        "Adriana: I can't think of anyone.",
        "Rex: Anyone you know ever call you \"butterfly\"?",
        "Adriana: Never. The website also said that 60% of stalkers eventually turn violent, but only 25% of them ever get caught. Which means that this guy --",
        "Rex: Ok, Adriana, stop.",
        "Adriana: Could be out there forever.",
        "Rex: Stop just stop with the statistics.",
        "Adriana: I'm just trying not to become one.",
        "Rex: You won't. I'm going to start interviewing bodyguards first thing in the morning. Until then, I don't want you to be alone, not for a second. Which is why I planned a special evening for us.",
        "Adriana: Really?",
        "Rex: Guaranteed to take your mind off things. Tonight's going to be 100% about us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Nothing's wrong. What makes you think that?",
        "Evangeline: I heard a crash. What's going on?",
        "Cristian: Uh -- I just knocked over an easel. No big deal. Here, right -- stand up here. I thought you'd call me after were done with Bo last night.",
        "Evangeline: Oh. Well, it was pretty late.",
        "Cristian: What did he want?",
        "Evangeline: Bo's really upset. You know, they keep turning up more evidence that he's the one that faked Margaret's death and framed Todd for it.",
        "Cristian: Right, I did read something about that in the paper, but I thought it was bogus.",
        "Evangeline: It's ridiculous. But you know, he has to follow procedure, so he stepped down as police commissioner. And Hugh -- it looks like he has no choice but charge him.",
        "Cristian: So he wants you to be his lawyer?",
        "Evangeline: Well, he asked. And I turned him down.",
        "Cristian: Why? Don't you dare tell me you're not good enough anymore.",
        "Evangeline: I was great, Cristian, but everything has changed now.",
        "Cristian: Come on.",
        "Evangeline: Listen. Bo's freedom is at stake. I can't use his case as some sort of confidence-building exercise.",
        "Cristian: Look, he asked you for a reason. That means he trusts you.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, and I appreciate that. And I'm going to do whatever I can to help him, but I can't be first chair. And I told Todd the same thing.",
        "Cristian: Todd? What did he want?",
        "Evangeline: He wants to sue Blair for custody of the kids. My reasons for that were different.",
        "Cristian: Look, everything -- I don't give a damn about Todd, but I think you should take Bo's case. He's not going to find anybody better than you.",
        "Evangeline: Will you stop thinking about me for one second and start thinking about what it's like in a courtroom? You know, arguing a case for a jury -- it's -- it's a performance.",
        "Cristian: Yeah?",
        "Evangeline: How am I going to convince 12 strangers that Bo is innocent when I can't see their faces, I can't see my notes? I -- I'm not even sure I can approach the bench without bumping into something.",
        "Cristian: Hey, so we'll practice.",
        "Evangeline: I would need to be focused on my argument, not how many steps there are to the jury box.",
        "Cristian: We'll drill you till it becomes second nature. Come on, you know your way around the courtroom.",
        "Evangeline: Well, everything is different in the dark. I mean, even at home, it feels different. I have to relearn everything.",
        "Cristian: I can't imagine what that's like.",
        "Evangeline: That's just the way things are. What? Cris, why aren't you saying anything? I hate this. I hate when you stop talking.",
        "Cristian: I was just thinking. Maybe it's time I see the world through your eyes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Jack, I don't hate your father.",
        "Jack: Why are you always fighting?",
        "Blair: Well, sometimes grownups argue, that's all. But what's most important here is that you and Starr both know that your daddy and I love you very much.",
        "Todd: Jack -- hey, I'm back now. Daddy's back. And I'm not going to leave you again. And I want to make up for all the lost time, so why don't we all go out, you, Starr and I, we get some burgers and some fries, and we can catch up and we have some fun, huh?",
        "Starr: Yeah, yeah, let's go.",
        "Jack: I'm not hungry.",
        "Starr: Jack, 10 minutes ago, you told me you were starving.",
        "Jack: Do I have to go?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I think it would be fun, you know? And I know that your dad is probably dying to hear about your geode collection, right? It'll be fun. You'll have a little dinner, and then your dad will bring you and Starr right back here, ok?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'll bring you back tonight.",
        "Blair: Good.",
        "Todd: For tonight.",
        "Blair: It'll be fun.",
        "Jack: I guess so.",
        "Blair: All right. Starr, will you take him to change him into, you know, something nice for Dad?",
        "Starr: Let's go.",
        "Blair: Thanks for backing me up.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, enjoy it while it lasts. They'll be living with me soon enough.",
        "Blair: Look, I know you're angry with me, Todd, but please don't use our kids to punish me.",
        "Todd: This isn't about you, Blair. I want my children.",
        "Blair: You know, you can sue me for custody of the kids, but I will win. I don't want to see you get hurt again.",
        "Todd: Well, your concern's a little late, I think. I died, remember?",
        "Blair: Oh, you think I would forget that? Look, Todd, I meant what I said before. I don't -- I don't hate you. I've never hated you, even when --",
        "Todd: Even when you stabbed me in the back?",
        "Blair: I was -- I was confused.",
        "Todd: Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Blair: Is this the way it's going to be, Todd? I mean, it's really over? Are you going to hate me forever?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Thank you for coming all the way out here. You're close to your daddy. I know that. It's a big deal. It means a lot to me.",
        "Claudia: I could never turn you down when you ask me for something, and you know that.",
        "Nash: If there was any other way, I promise --",
        "Claudia: Oh, you wouldn't come begging me? You think I don't know that? But it's ok. It's ok. I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be. And I know where your heart lies.",
        "Nash: I care about you, Claudia. But as soon as this is all done, I'm going home. I'm going back to Tess and my little girl.",
        "Claudia: I haven't forgotten.",
        "Nash: He's here.",
        "Claudia: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Nash: Go. Ahem.",
        "George: I just drove around the grounds a bit. You seem to have invested in a great deal of new equipment.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, I had to buy a lot of new equipment after the fire. But then you know all about that, don't you?",
        "George: Be careful, Brennan. It's brushfire season, and this place is a tinderbox.",
        "Nash: I'm doing what you wanted. I'm here, about as far away from Llanview as I can get.",
        "George: That's a wise decision, since my daughter seems set on living there for the time being.",
        "Nash: She could do worse.",
        "George: Yeah, she has. You were the worst thing that ever happened to Claudia. And if you ever get within 10 feet of her again, I will finish what I started. What was that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Dorian -- um -- actually, this is not a good time. You know, we're having a -- a family celebration, so do you mind?",
        "Dorian: Viki, this is Asa's house. You certainly have no right to ask me to leave. Besides which, I'm here to see Clint.",
        "Clint: Well, Dorian, actually, we are having a little party for our new granddaughter.",
        "Dorian: Yes, so I see. And it's so lovely.",
        "Viki: Yes, as I said, it is a family celebration.",
        "Jessica: Mom --",
        "Viki: Family.",
        "Dorian: I heard you.",
        "Jessica: It's -- it's ok. Dorian, I'm glad that you're here.",
        "Dorian: Why, thank you, Jessica. It is Jessica, isn't it?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, it's -- it's me. Listen, I heard that Tess came to you and asked you to -- to hide her, but instead you called my dad. If you hadn't have done that, I might not be here.",
        "Dorian: Probably not. Because Tess was awfully intent on getting out of the clutches of the Buchanan's.",
        "Jessica: Thank you, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: It just seemed like the right thing to do.",
        "Jamie: Brennan got a lot of presents.",
        "Viki: Yes, Brennan did get a lot of presents. However, they're not all for Brennan. This enormous one --",
        "Antonio: Oh, wow.",
        "Viki: Is for you.",
        "Jamie: Really?",
        "Viki: Really, sweetheart, really.",
        "Antonio: Thank you, Viki.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. I didn't want her to feel left out.",
        "Clint: Yeah, that was very thoughtful of you.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Yeah, there we go.",
        "Dorian: Oh, by the way, did you happen to get my gift?",
        "Jessica: Oh, I'm sorry, Dorian, we didn't get a gift from you.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Oh, my goodness, how embarrassing. I wonder what happened to it? I'm going to ask you to excuse me just a moment. I'm going to call Logan's and see what happened to it.",
        "Viki: Well, that was very generous of you to ask her to stay, considering your history.",
        "Jessica: She took care of me when I -- I couldn't take care of myself. You all did. Especially you, Mom. I mean, you risked everything when you let Niki smith out. You could have lost yourself for good this time, and I know how hard that was for you.",
        "Viki: It's all right. I'm only sorry that it gave Niki the opportunity to create chaos in this family again.",
        "Clint: Well, she's gone now, thank God.",
        "Viki: I wish that were true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I knew you were going to say that. But someday, Todd --",
        "Todd: \"Someday, Todd, you'll forgive and forget.\"",
        "Blair: That's right.",
        "Todd: Did you do that for me, Blair, when I was on death row?",
        "Blair: I was wrong, Todd.",
        "Todd: You didn't lift a finger to help me. You testified against me. I spent all those nights in prison. Do you know that I was beaten on a daily basis by the guards?",
        "Blair: Todd --",
        "Todd: What do you think of that? You know what I did between those beatings? I thought about my last meal and my last words and my last breath and my last --",
        "Blair: I'm sure --",
        "Todd: Thought.",
        "Blair: I'm sure that it was hell. I know it was for you.",
        "Todd: You real turned your back on me, boy. And now you've turned our son against me.",
        "Blair: No, I never meant for that to happen.",
        "Todd: He's afraid of his own father!",
        "Blair: No, he's afraid of jail. And now that you're out --",
        "Todd: Did you see the way he was here? He wants nothing to do with me. I'm going to get him back, Blair. I'm going to get my family back. I'm getting my life back. My home, my newspaper, my children --",
        "Blair: Good.",
        "Todd: And there is nothing you can do --",
        "Blair: Good.",
        "Todd: Nothing you can do --",
        "Blair: Good! I hope you do!",
        "Todd: Or anyone to stop me.",
        "Blair: I hope you do. And I mean it.",
        "Todd: You can have them for now. But I'll tell you what -- the second you shack up with Spencer Truman --",
        "Blair: Look, I'm not going to live with Spencer. I can't.",
        "Todd: Oh. Well, why is that? I thought you were in love with him. I feel these tingling sensations",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Ready or not, here I come. Where are you?",
        "Evangeline: I'm over here.",
        "Cristian: Oh -- ow.",
        "Evangeline: What was that?",
        "Cristian: Nothing. Nothing. I just bumped into something. Um -- just keep talking.",
        "Evangeline: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Cristian: Just say whatever you're thinking.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I'm thinking this is insane -- and maybe the most supportive thing anyone's ever done for me. Careful. Be careful. You're almost here.",
        "Cristian: Ah.",
        "Evangeline: Ah. You did it.",
        "Cristian: Wow, that was tough.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, it takes some getting used to. Can you see me?",
        "Cristian: Mm-hmm. Perfectly.",
        "Evangeline: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: In my mind's eye. Is that the way you see?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. And when I worry that I'm going to forget what everything looks like, I just -- I think about you, actually. I remember your face and -- and then everything is clear again. It's like there's a light in the darkness. Color and -- and I can see everything.",
        "Cristian: God, you're beautiful.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I think you were inspired by something else before I got here.",
        "Cristian: What do you mean?",
        "Evangeline: Well, I smell paint.",
        "Cristian: Uh-huh.",
        "Evangeline: Were you working on the painting that you're making for me?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I was, but I didn't get too far.",
        "Evangeline: Ah. That's not surprising. I'm not feeling like much of a muse lately.",
        "Cristian: Are you kidding? You're incredible. In fact, why don't you let me paint you?",
        "Evangeline: I won't be able to see it, but ok. When?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Well, what do you have planned for us tonight?",
        "Rex: A table at the bayberry inn. Champagne on ice.",
        "Adriana: If we drink champagne, we won't be able to drive home, which means we may have to spend the night.",
        "Rex: I didn't think of that.",
        "Adriana: You're vibrating.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I know.",
        "Adriana: I meant your phone.",
        "Rex: Oh. Yeah, go. The country club? Yeah, I'll be right over.",
        "Adriana: Leaving?",
        "Rex: I got a lead on something that could help clear Bo. I'll make it quick, I promise.",
        "Adriana: You better.",
        "Rex: You sure you're going to be ok?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. Mary's going to be here till closing. Nothing's going to happen with all these people around.",

        "Blair: Spencer -- well -- it's -- it's just complicated, our relationship. It's --",
        "Todd: What's complicated about it? You take off each other's clothes, you jump into bed, you --",
        "Blair: Would you just stop it. Our kids could come back any moment.",
        "Todd: Poor Blair. Taken in by Spencer Truman.",
        "Blair: Look, Todd, you don't under--",
        "Todd: Don't worry about it. It's ok. He's going to get his. I'm going to see to that.",
        "Blair: Oh, you're going to see to it? What's that going to do to you? You're going to end up in prison again, huh?",
        "Todd: What do you care? You and I are over.",
        "Blair: Huh. You're just jealous.",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Blair: That -- no, you are so jealous. And you know what you do when you're jealous?",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: You do something stupid and dangerous! And that's why I'm not going to tell you what I'm doing. What are you laughing at?",
        "Todd: What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Oh, what are you doing?",
        "Cristian: I am painting you.",

        "George: Is somebody else here?",
        "Nash: No, it's mice. They've been coming out of the woodwork since the fire -- the fire that you set. It's a good thing I wasn't here. I might have been burned to a crisp. But then, of course, you had your goons come over here and beat me to a pulp and leave me for dead. You remember that?",
        "George: I did what I had to do to protect my daughter.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I get that. I'm trying to protect my daughter, too. That's why I'm here -- to protect her from you.",
        "George: Well, you just stay away from Llanview, Brennan.",
        "Nash: That's what I'm doing, right? I'm here. Alone and miserable, just like you wanted.",
        "George: Oh, and don't even think about double-crossing me, or your daughter's going to pay the price. You have my word on that.",
        "Nash: He's gone. There, you heard him. He's going to hurt my daughter, huh? Is that proof enough for you?",
        "Claudia: I can't believe daddy threatened a baby.",
        "Nash: You heard him! What proof do you need?",
        "Claudia: believe you, Nash Daddy shouldn't have done that. I'll help you stop him, whatever it takes.",
        "Nash: Thank you. Then I can go home.",

        "Clint: Viki, what are you saying? Has Niki come out again?",
        "Viki: No. No, no, no. No. I should never had said anything. No, the last time she came out was, you know, when I found out about the -- the tapes. And -- and I asked her to come out then. I guess what I meant was the mere fact that she was able to emerge. It means that I'm obviously not integrated and never was.",

        "Viki: Sweetheart, I would go through much, much worse for you. And, listen, I want -- I don't want you to worry. It's all right. You know, I know what I'm dealing with, and I'll take care of it. I'm going to call dr. Jamison, I'll start therapy again, and we'll all be fine. But this is Brennan's night, so let's try and enjoy it, ok?",

        "Blair: Come on, Todd, don't.",
        "Todd: What? I'm not doing anything. I didn't do anything. You're the one sleeping with him. The guy who wanted me dead. How am I supposed to feel about that, huh?",

        "Rex: Lab reports, medical forms, releases. The police commissioner's a good friend of mine. He's being accused of setting up a guy named Manning for murder. You've always got your ear to the ground. I was hoping maybe you heard something.",

        "Jessica: There's so much that I don't know about this disease. I mean, all this time, I thought that you were fully integrated, but Niki was just hiding, waiting for an opportunity to come out again. Does that mean that I'm never going to be rid of Tess?",

        "Clint: Kevin, too. I'm afraid Kevin may never recover.",
