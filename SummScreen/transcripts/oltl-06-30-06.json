        "All have arrived now for the meeting at the Country Club. Everyone seems surprised that everyone else is there. Evangeline finds this very strange. She wonders aloud who it was that called them all there. Todd arrives and announces that he is the culprit. He just wanted to thank everyone for helping to save his life. David moves forward curious then as to why Spencer isn't there. Blair comes to Spencer's place using her key. She calls out for him but no one answers. She goes to his computer and starts snooping. He surprises her by coming up behind her, joking that he might think she were spying. She says she was looking for a site for something for Jack's schooling. She can't pony up the name for him and he tells her that he has been feeling funny about her lately. Blair gets a text message and leaves Spencer to go to the Country Club. She arrives and finds the Country Club full of people who all stare at her strangely. Todd calls out to everyone announcing that she is there. Spencer walks in behind her. \"And look! She brought a date!\" Blair too is surprised to find that Spencer has followed her to her destination. Todd thanks everyone, one by one for helping to free him from being killed by the state. He even offers to help David find his freedom for his part in all this. Lastly, he tells Spencer that he doesn't mind him fighting for Blair. He says that the man can have her, and that she is only the consolation prize. He only cares that Spencer never get his hands on his kids. Natalie has a moment to herself and she goes over to David and asks him to please tell John the truth about his father being killed. She knows that it won't hold up in court if he confesses now. David goes to John. \"Spencer had nothing to do with it. He didn't kill your father. It was me. I killed your father.\""

        "Adriana: Will we ever go anywhere again where you aren't casing the place for stalkers?",
        "Rex: Well, if this creep shows up tonight, he's not leaving without a police escort and a pair of handcuffs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Spencer? Are you here? Spencer? Come on. Couldn't have been stupid enough to leave information on this. All I need is a name.",
        "Spencer: If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were spying on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Clint, this is such a nice surprise. What happened to your very special family celebration?",
        "Clint: Oh, well, my little granddaughter had to get home to bed, and then Viki took off for somewhere.",
        "Dorian: So you decided to come over here?",
        "Clint: Yeah. Hope you don't mind.",
        "Dorian: I mind so much, I'm going to pour you a drink.",
        "Clint: Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Lady, you trying to get me drunk?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hey. What are you two doing here?",
        "Natalie: Well, we got text messages saying to come right away.",
        "Viki: You did? So did I.",
        "John: Really?",
        "Viki: Who is it from, do you know?",
        "Natalie: No. You don't, either?",
        "Viki: No, I thought it was Nash, something to do with the baby.",
        "John: No, there's got to be something else. I don't know if we're going to have the time to stick around and find out, though.",
        "Viki: You two got text messages, as well?",
        "Cristian: Evangeline did. I'm just along for the ride.",
        "Viki: Whoa.",
        "Starr: This is really freaky. Everybody keeps getting these weird text messages.",
        "Viki: Hello, my sweet.",
        "Starr: Hi. This is Ricky.",
        "Viki: Hi.",
        "Ricky: Nice to meet you.",
        "David: Yeah, you can relax. I'm not crashing your party. I got a message to be here.",
        "Evangeline: Is that David Vickers?",
        "Cristian: In the flesh.",
        "David: What, is she blind?",
        "Evangeline: Ok, half the town is here and no one knows why. Who invited us?",
        "Todd: I did. I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Actually, I'm lucky you came at all. If everything goes as planned, this should be a night you'll never forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Well, I'm not -- I'm not quitting my job. I'm taking an administrative absence. That's all it is.",
        "Matthew: I know what that means, Dad. It means you're in trouble, like John.",
        "Bo: Not much gets past you, does it, bud?",
        "Matthew: Not really. So just tell me the truth. What's going on?",
        "Bo: Well, I don't really want to get into specifics.",
        "Matthew: Because it's official police business.",
        "Bo: Yeah, that's right. The bottom line -- somebody is accusing me of doing something that I didn't really do.",
        "Matthew: You mean, you're being framed, like Starr's dad?",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, but it's not quite that serious. But right now, I'm working real hard to prove that I didn't do it.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but they should automatically believe you. You're the police Commissioner.",
        "Bo: If only it was that simple.",
        "Matthew: Does Mom know?",
        "Bo: Uh -- probably.",
        "Matthew: Mom?",
        "Nora: Matthew. Bo.",
        "Bo: Hi, Nora. Listen, I'm going to let you two visit for a while. I want to run and check on something. Don't forget that Marianne is going to come by and she's going to pick you up here to take you home.",
        "Matthew: All right.",
        "Bo: I'll see you later.",
        "Nora: Hug?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Hi.",
        "Bo: Hi. Just thought I'd stop in and see how you're doing.",
        "Paige: Well, they're sending me home tomorrow.",
        "Bo: Good. Good. I'm glad you're feeling better.",
        "Paige: You know, doctors make lousy patients. It was either discharge me or disconnect my call button. It's good to see you.",
        "Bo: Well, I was here. You know, Matthew and I, we were visiting pa and Nora.",
        "Paige: How's Matthew doing?",
        "Bo: Uh -- life keeps pitching him curves, but he keeps hitting them.",
        "Paige: Hmm. Yeah, well, that's because he's -- he's got a big heart, like his daddy.",
        "Paige: I really screwed up.",
        "Bo: I won't argue.",
        "Paige: Lying here all this time, I've -- I've had a lot of time to think about how I've -- how I've ruined everything. And now you've lost your job, anyway, the job that you love.",
        "Bo: Well, I think I've lost more than just my job. I think we both have. I think the day that you decided that you couldn't trust me enough to tell me everything about Spencer, that's the day we lost it all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I was looking up a website. At Jack's school today, some parents were talking about this awful video, violent game that kids are -- are downloading.",
        "Spencer: Really? What's it called?",
        "Blair: Well, that's the problem. I can't seem to remember it, so that's why I was kind of looking it up.",
        "Spencer: Hmm.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Spencer: Funny thing about the internet, you know, you just can't trust it, can you? I mean, something as seemingly harmless as that and it could potentially be very, very dangerous.",
        "Blair: Yeah. You didn't think that I was spying on you, did you?",
        "Spencer: Of course not. But you keep looking through my things like this, I am going to start to wonder. So what did you want? Why'd you stop by? What's going on?",
        "Blair: Well, I wanted to show you my fabulous red dress. And I thought maybe I could take you to dinner.",
        "Spencer: All right. I'll get dressed.",
        "Blair: Ok. Oh. Well, that's funny, I never get text messages.",
        "Spencer: What is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If it weren't for all of you, uh, I'd be -- well, I'd be dead, thanks to the great state of Pennsylvania.",
        "Viki: Todd --",
        "Todd: Don't worry, sis, this is a celebration. I'm not going to be morbid. I just -- you know, I'm alive thanks to everyone in this room. And I -- and I want to thank them.",
        "David: Wait a minute. Where's Spencer? Didn't he save your life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: It's glad to see you smile.",
        "Clint: Well, it's been a while since I felt like it. Ever since I got back from London, I have been doing nothing except putting out fires. And then, losing Duke -- I truly didn't know if my family was going to make it through that intact.",
        "Dorian: I know how much you miss him.",
        "Clint: Yeah. And it should never have happened. But now I'm trying to focus on the living.",
        "Dorian: It can't be easy.",
        "Clint: No, it's not. But for better or for worse, life goes on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: See, it wasn't that I didn't trust you. It was -- it was just that I couldn't trust myself. I didn't really believe that somebody could -- could love me, no matter what I did. I don't know, I'm not big on faith. I never have been.",
        "Bo: You know, we can't change what we've done. We can only change what we do from here on out.",
        "Paige: We?",
        "Bo: I want to beat him, Paige. I want to nail Spencer. And I want you to help me do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: So what's the text message, huh?",
        "Blair: It's -- it's Starr. She wants to meet me at the country club for dinner. So I guess I'm going to have to take a rain check.",
        "Spencer: No, nonsense. I'd love to go to the country club for dinner.",
        "Blair: Oh, no.",
        "Spencer: I could use a change of pace.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no, no. Starr has a hard enough time dealing with the idea of the two of us. I need to do this by myself.",
        "Spencer: Ok. I understand. As long as you're sure that's all it is.",
        "Blair: Well, yes. I mean, one rebellious teenager is enough, don't you think, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: Oh, yeah, I think so. It's just that lately -- I don't know, ever since Todd was released from prison, you and I just haven't seemed as connected, you know?",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Spencer: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: Well, we are. We are. But I have to admit -- I mean, you know, with Todd back in the picture, things definitely have changed.",
        "Spencer: Todd's back in the picture?",
        "Blair: Well, don't read too much into that, Spencer. All I mean is that Todd and I have a history. We were married, we have children. And I thought that he had killed his own child. And now that I know that he didn't, things are different.",
        "Spencer: How so?",
        "Blair: Nothing that will affect us, ok? It's important to me. And I don't want to walk away from that.",
        "Spencer: You really believe that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, Spencer has been left absent from the guest list tonight. I believe everybody's here except one.",
        "Viki: Todd --",
        "Todd: Yeah?",
        "Viki: What are you doing?",
        "Todd: You can relax. This is a celebration. It's the new-and-improved Todd Manning, and I am back from the dead and better than ever, right?",
        "Viki: No, no, no, no. Come on, I know you.",
        "Todd: Well, it's like you said, I got a second chance. I appreciate it. I'd like to share that with everyone here. That's all this is.",
        "Viki: I hope so.",
        "Todd: Ok. All right, so, you all had a part in saving my life, whether you like it or not.",
        "David: Hey, bring me two of these every 10 minutes till I pass out.",
        "Waiter: Yes, sir.",
        "Todd: John?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Uh -- between the two of us, we brought down a plane.",
        "John: You shot the pilot.",
        "Todd: That's right. That's right, I did. It turned out ok, didn't it? I'd like to say to you that I'm glad that I didn't kill you when I had the chance.",
        "Adriana: That's how your friend says thanks, \"glad I didn't kill you\"?",
        "Todd: Uh, you really fought like hell to bring back Margaret in time to save my life.",
        "John: Well, I was just doing my job. Don't take it personal.",
        "Todd: No, no. I just wanted to say, you're ok for a cop. And, Nat, you're ok for a niece. Although I've really been a rotten uncle, haven't I? I've been a nasty son of a bitch.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you tried to sell my heart.",
        "Todd: Well, that's not going to happen again. So, I'm going to make things better for you -- for you and your mom.",
        "Viki: Todd, this is so unnecessary.",
        "Todd: Would you shut up and let me thank you. See -- I abuse her, I know it. But she sticks by me, anyway, even when her own life is falling apart. I tell you, you must have gotten all the good genes.",
        "Viki: Would that were true.",
        "Natalie: My mom is a saint for putting up with him all these years. I mean, if I had a brother like Todd who pulled all those stunts, I'd write him off.",
        "Todd: Balsom --",
        "Rex: Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: You aided and abetted like a pro.",
        "Rex: Happy to oblige.",
        "Todd: Rick, thank you for sticking up for my daughter when she was taking heat for being my daughter. And of course, I have to thank my daughter, don't I? Because she's a beautiful girl. You're the toughest nut in the room, you know that? You know, you we the only person whoever questioned whether I was guilty or innocent. And -- and I love you for that. And I don't know how somebody who's half me can be so good.",
        "David: Is this where he pulls the pin?",
        "Todd: No, David, I'm going to spare your life.",
        "David: Oh. Well, actually, not necessary. The way things have been going lately, a blaze of glory might be the way to check out.",
        "Todd: I want to return the favor.",
        "David: What favor?",
        "Todd: If you're innocent, I want to help you prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Dad's got big problems, Mom, not just work.",
        "Nora: Paige?",
        "Matthew: She had a car accident. She was hurt really bad.",
        "Nora: Is she ok?",
        "Matthew: She's going to be. But they broke up. I mean, I asked her why and she told me to ask Dad. But he couldn't really explain it. I liked her. And Dad seemed really happy when they weren't fighting. I just don't get it.",
        "Nora: Well, sometimes, it's hard to understand.",
        "Matthew: Don't say because I'm a kid.",
        "Nora: Well, forever-- for everyone.",
        "Matthew: I mean, I saw some bad stuff on the internet about Dad. He doesn't want me to know how bad things are, but everyone's talking about it.",
        "Nora: He's try-- he's trying to protect you.",
        "Matthew: I don't need protecting, he does.",
        "Nora: Then you take care of him. And let him take care of you. It's nice to be protected, even at my age.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Bo, you don't even have to ask. I want to nail Spencer as much as you do. I will do anything. I will -- I'll testify against him in court. I will -- I could spy on him.",
        "Bo: Just talk to me. Just talk to me, ok? Just trust me with the truth, all of it, ok? Maybe that'll even help put Spencer behind you.",
        "Paige: I have missed you so much.",
        "Bo: I missed you, too.",
        "Paige: And I know that we can't just pick up where we left off. I know -- I know it's going to take time, and we're going to -- we're going to have to work at it.",
        "Bo: No, we can't go back, though. I mean, what we had before, it's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You hate my guts.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "David: You hit me with a rock.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "David: You sent me to prison in Africa.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "David: But now you want to help me?",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "David: Ok.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I figured you hate your brother as much as I do, if that's possible. And I thought we could team up and try to clear your name. Oh, good, Blair's arrived, right on time. Oh, excellent. She brought a date, too.",
        "Viki: Ok. Now this is starting to make sense. My name is Ruben Martinez and this is my story. I still love looking at her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Clint, things have been dreadful for your family for the past few months. Why wouldn't I be happy that things are looking up?",
        "Clint: In a word, Viki.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please. All right, I'm -- I'm very, very happy for you. And if things are also looking better for Viki, well, then, I'm also happy for her.",
        "Clint: She said through clenched teeth.",
        "Dorian: It's no secret I'm not the president of Viki's fan club.",
        "Clint: Dorian, you loathe Viki, and she feels the same way about you.",
        "Dorian: Our relationship is a bit complicated.",
        "Clint: Like a couple of cats fighting over a can of tuna.",
        "Dorian: Viki is judgmental and withholding, pompous and superior.",
        "Clint: Well, there you go. That's more like it.",
        "Dorian: Oh, you like my trashing Viki.",
        "Clint: No, I am being real, because I can guarantee you, if I were with Viki right now, oh, she'd have some choice things to say about you.",
        "Dorian: Are you enjoying this?",
        "Clint: I don't know. No, I don't know. Give me a hand. What's the right answer?",
        "Dorian: How entertaining is it, your playing Viki off against me?",
        "Clint: That's not what I'm doing. It didn't even occur to me to do that.",
        "Dorian: Well, then you're doing it by instinct.",
        "Clint: Dorian, this is not a competition. I don't want you to pretend to like Viki in order to impress me. No, I'm not interested in a woman with no edge, and I am not carrying tales back and forth between the two women in my life.",
        "Dorian: The what?",
        "Clint: My ex-wife and mother of my children.",
        "Dorian: Right, of course. Viki comes first, as usual. You're not married to that woman anymore and yet she's holding you hostage. How in the world can you ever start over with somebody else?",
        "Clint: I don't know. Got somebody in mind?",
        "Dorian: You said there were two women in your life. Would it be presumptuous to assume that the other one was me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: When you said you wanted to work together to nail Spencer, I -- I don't know. I thought you were saying -- never mind. Just forget it.",
        "Bo: Well, no, no, you know what? I don't think you understand --",
        "Paige: No, I understand. You couldn't have been more clear. You said, what we was based on a lie. See? I mean, that doesn't -- Are you -- are you talking about somehow starting over? I mean, is that even possible?",
        "Bo: Look, I know that I have this -- this reputation, you know, as being a real, like, a hard-liner. Rules are rules. There's no getting around them and, you know, maybe -- maybe I don't really feel differently about that except about this.",
        "Paige: \"This\" meaning what?",
        "Bo: Us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "R.J.: I have brought you some things to help while away the hours between visits. We have magazines, we have some books, and many of your favorite songs have been downloaded, all completely legally, which cost me a small fortune. But it's worth it if we're going to rehab your spirit and mind along with those legs.",
        "Nora: I want to go home.",
        "R.J.: Soon, you will.",
        "Nora: Now.",
        "R.J.: You're not ready yet.",
        "Nora: Matthew needs his mother.",
        "R.J.: He's got her. I'm looking right at her.",
        "Nora: No, not like this. Not like this. I've been gone too long. I need to go home. I need to make it up to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, why did you invite them?",
        "Todd: I invited your mother.",
        "Blair: Did you follow me here?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, I was concerned about you, and for good reason.",
        "Todd: Ok, uh, where -- thank you. Now that everyone's here, there's one more person I want to thank, the most important person of all as far as I'm concerned -- Evangeline.",
        "David: Hear, hear. Evangeline, I'm going to need a good lawyer soon.",
        "Evangeline: Is everybody looking at me?",
        "Cristian: Yep.",
        "Todd: Evangeline, you have more heart than any lawyer should probably ever have. You risked everything you had because you believed in me, and that's something that no one has ever done for me, ever. You are such a good person that I -- I'm a little surprised I can even stand you. But you E. You're a good person. You're a hell of a woman.",
        "Evangeline: Todd, thank you, but you don't have to do this. I know how you feel.",
        "Todd: No, no. I just want to tell you that, you know, you never abandoned me and you never cared what anyone thought about it. And that makes you either the most courageous woman in the world or the craziest, and I think it's probably the former. You are brilliant and kind and beautiful, inside and out. And I'm really happy you're in my life. All right. To Evangeline.",
        "All: To Evangeline.",
        "Todd: Uh -- but last and certainly not least, my former wife, the mother of my children, and her illustrious boyfriend, Dr. Love.",
        "Spencer: You want me to take you home?",
        "Blair: No, it's all right.",
        "Todd: Uh, thank you both.",
        "Blair: For what?",
        "Todd: For setting me free, although I think the lethal injection was a little -- a little extreme.",
        "Spencer: You're making an ass out of yourself, Manning.",
        "Todd: I figured you'd love this. I mean, if Blair hadn't betrayed me, I still might be in love with her, and then you wouldn't stand a chance.",
        "Viki: Todd, don't do this. Starr is here. Don't.",
        "Starr: No, really, it's fine. I agree with him.",
        "Todd: Look, he started this war, but he can't finish it. You know what? Take her. I want you to have her as a consolation prize. But I want you to know, you can't have my children or any other aspect of my life.",
        "Starr: Dad, I think that's enough.",
        "Todd: Yes, you're right, that's enough. I've made my point. Have some N. Everybody have some fun. All the drinks and all the food is on me. Dancing will begin, yes? Uh -- all right. Sorry to interrupt. May I have this dance?",
        "Evangeline: Todd, is this for Spencer and Blair's benefit?",
        "Todd: No, it's for mine. It's my party and I want to dance with the best- looking woman in the room. Is that ok with you?",
        "Cristian: Sure. Go ahead.",
        "Evangeline: Uh, just so you know, I like to lead.",
        "Todd: Of course you do.",
        "Blair: So what's all this about, Starr?",
        "Starr: This is Dad's way of saying thank you to everyone that helped him.",
        "Blair: Well, that's not why he invited me.",
        "Starr: Obviously. Maybe it wouldn't have been as bad if you didn't bring along Dr. Truman.",
        "Blair: I didn't invite Dr. Truman. He followed me.",
        "Starr: Like anyone believes you. Know what time it is?",
        "Blair: Let's dance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Now I'm really confused. At first, I thought you were saying that we had a chance, and then -- then you said that what we had together is dead. And now you're -- well, I don't -- I don't get what you're saying.",
        "Bo: Well, what I want to say is that I -- I want -- I want to say that, you know, we'll work it out, you know? We'll get past everything that's happened, you know? We'll fight Spencer, we'll beat him. I mean, we'll make sure, we'll stop him from ruining us. You know, I want to say all of that stuff, but then I -- I get stuck.",
        "Paige: Because you can't -- you can't get past what I did.",
        "Bo: But I try, you know. I try.",
        "Paige: Well, then maybe -- maybe there just isn't an \"us.\"",
        "Bo: I don't know. You know, this is all new territory for me. It's -- it's hard to admit things about yourself sometimes, but I know sometimes -- well, I'm unforgiving. And it's hurt. It's caused me a lot of problems, caused me a lot of heartache. But I miss my friend. There's so many things that I want to tell you.",
        "Paige: Well, you can tell me anything.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but see, I'm not sure when.",
        "Paige: Bo? I miss my friend, too, and I -- I'll do anything, anything it takes to make this right. But if we can't forget the past, how can we even hope for a future?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You'll be happy to hear that both John and Cristian have got their knickers in a twist about us dancing.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, please. That's the last thing on my mind.",
        "Todd: You love it just a little bit.",
        "Evangeline: Maybe just a little.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh. You should see the looks Blair is shooting me.",
        "Evangeline: Hey, wait. I thought you said this wasn't about Blair.",
        "Todd: It's not about Blair.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. What is this, Todd? What is the point of all of this?",
        "Todd: Y can't a party just be a party?",
        "Evangeline: All right, fine. Don't tell me what it is.",
        "Todd: I will tell you this. I meant what I said about you, every word.",
        "David: Adriana, care to dance?",
        "Adriana: I would love to. Give us a minute. Bet you didn't expect this when you woke up this morning.",
        "David: I don't know that to expect anymore. You're having fun. Or trying to have fun? What's going on? Is Dorian still giving you a hard time about Rex?",
        "Adriana: Mom is the least of my problems right now.",
        "David: So talk to me. You can trust me. As a matter of fact, as your former stepfather-to-be, I demand to know. Maybe I'm pushing the envelope a little bit, but I love you, you know. I want you to be happy.",
        "Adriana: And I want that for you, too. But do you really think you can be?",
        "David: My happiness hinges on Todd and Spencer.",
        "Spencer: You remember when I told you about the night I first fell in love with you?",
        "Blair: Yeah, what about it?",
        "Spencer: Right here at the country club, right out on the terrace. You were out there with Todd, and I'll never forget the way you were looking at him.",
        "Blair: Why are you bringing it up now?",
        "Spencer: Well, I just -- I knew if I was ever going to have you, that you would have to choose me over him. And lately, I've been wondering if you ever really made that choice at all. I mean, perhaps we really only do have true love once in our lives.",
        "Blair: What do you think, Spencer? Just because I chose Todd once that I can't choose you now?",
        "Spencer: All I know is that I love you and there will never be anyone else.",
        "David: So, do you think your brother really wants to help me, or is this just diabolical plan number 6902?",
        "Viki: Oh, David. Are you sucking up to me?",
        "David: Is it that obvious?",
        "Viki: Yes, I think that Todd is serious. I think what you have to question is why. Does he want to help you because he believes that you are innocent, or does he want to help you because he believes that Spencer is guilty?",
        "David: Does it matter?",
        "Viki: Yes, David. It does, to me.",
        "David: Viki, how is it that you always make me feel like I just got caught cutting class?",
        "Viki: Did you?",
        "Natalie: Does that bother you?",
        "John: Evangeline's a big girl. She can handle herself. I still don't trust Manning.",
        "Natalie: Well, you shouldn't. Although I am still glad that we did what we did, I mean, at least for Starr's sake. She didn't lose her dad. I'm sorry.",
        "John: No, it's -- it's all right. You don't have to apologize to me every time you mention someone's father.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, at least you got justice for your Dad.",
        "John: If Vickers really is the shooter. Hey, look, I'm going to go check in with the station, all right? You'll be all right for a minute?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, let me know.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "Natalie: I need you to do something for me.",
        "David: For you or for John?",
        "Natalie: The same thing, really. Look, I love him and he's never going to be able to get past his father's death until he knows who killed him.",
        "David: That would be Paige Miller.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but you are the one who put him in that hospital, so just admit it. Look, he can't use it against you. It won't hold up in court. And maybe it'll help end the pain that he's been dealing with for 25 years that you caused.",
        "David: You're assuming that I did it.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Well, didn't you?",

        "R.J.: Ok, we just need to work harder, get you out of here faster.",
        "Nora: You have done so much.",
        "R.J.: Hey, I am just getting started.",
        "Nora: Why? Hmm? Why do you care?",
        "R.J.: You mean besides the fact that Matthew's a great kid and -- and you're a pretty great mom?",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "R.J.: Well, um -- I'm just trying to get you back in fighting form, that's all. And you're giving me grief about it already?",
        "Nora: R.J., I'm a lot of work.",
        "R.J.: Well, yeah, that you are.",

        "Paige: No, you never have. You never -- you never could.",

        "Dorian: And yet, here you are, back in Llanview.",
        "Clint: Look, I came back here because of my children.",
        "Dorian: And you stayed because of Viki. You have always done everything for Viki, for Viki's sake. It's always about Viki, and I'm telling you, it drives me crazy.",
        "Clint: Oh, really? Why?",
        "Dorian: Isn't it obvious?",
        "Clint: I like to hear it.",

        "Starr: Ricky, don't you think my dad's amazing? I mean, he gets how cool you are to me, unlike my mom.",
        "Ricky: Cristian thinks I shouldn't trust him.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, Cristian's just jealous because Evangeline's spending more time with my dad than him.",
        "Evangeline: Are you going to keep me out here all night or just until Blair's head explodes?",
        "Todd: Blair who?",
        "Evangeline: Todd, you are loving getting a rise out of Blair.",
        "Todd: What I'm loving is dancing with you.",
        "Blair: You know what, Spencer? My feet are just killing me. Let's go home.",
        "Spencer: Wait, wait, wait. Not yet, not yet. I want everyone to see how much I love you. It's not very often I get to express my feelings for you in public, now, do I?",
        "Blair: Is that what this is all about? You just want to make some kind of statement?",
        "Spencer: What's the matter, Blair? Don't we want the same things?",
        "David: John, there's something I want to say to you. I didn't know you were going to be here tonight. I didn't know Todd was going to come to my defense. He's a loose cannon. You never know what --",

        "David: Can we talk off the record?",

        "John: What about my dad?",
        "David: Don't waste your time trying to pin anything on Spencer. He had nothing to do with your father's death.",
        "John: How do you know?",
        "David: Because I was there. I want to come clean. I killed your father.",
