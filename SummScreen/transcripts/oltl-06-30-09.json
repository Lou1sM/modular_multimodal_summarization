        "Destiny, Matthew, Shawn and Rachel sit at the palace and wait for Greg to join them for dinner. When he does not show up, they are disappointed and suspicious. Meanwhile, we see Greg at Capricorn with an attractive woman. Clint, Nora and Bo notice him. Clint and Nora are hopeful that he can help Matthew walk. But Bo admits he is skeptical. Rex admits to Gigi that he has never stopped loving her and has to \"play\" Stacy so that she believes what they want her to believe in order to get her to tell Rex who the real donor is. Yet, Kyle, Natalie and Jared go to the hospital and find out he died. They still haven't a clue who he is. Only Roxy knows. A nurse from the hospital knocks Roxy out and takes the spare bag of blood with Shane's stem cells that Kyle has gotten for her. And the woman brings it to Stacy."

        "Stacy: Oh -- finally.",
        "Man: Chef-To-Go --",
        "[Stacy sighs]",
        "Man: A couple orders of chicken French.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, that's me. Smells great.",
        "Man: We aim to please. How was that chicken parm you had the other night?",
        "Stacy: It was great. Now let's get you paid and out of here before my guy gets home.",
        "Man: Okay.",
        "Stacy: Thank you very much.",
        "Man: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Don't you get it now, Morasco? I believed every word you said about Stacy -- how she wouldn't give her stem cells to save Shane until you broke up with me, and how she used somebody else's blood to save Shane's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: What are you doing with that needle?",
        "Nurse Charles: What does it look like?",
        "Roxy: Nurse Charles, are you insane?",
        "Nurse Charles: Get out of my way or you'll be sorry.",
        "Roxy: You better give me that blood or you're going to be the sorry one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared -- Jared, who's in there?",
        "Jared: Uh \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I got your message to come here. To what do I owe this surprise?",
        "Nora: Um, you are my hero. And I thought you deserved a night out for bringing Dr. Evans here to examine Matthew. And we should know something soon.",
        "Clint: I know. I talked to the doctor.",
        "Nora: Well, Mr. Buchanan, you have given me more hope than I've had since Matthew's accident.",
        "Rachel: You drive a hard bargain, bro.",
        "Matthew: Hey, a deal's a deal. You said that if I played the piano after my accident, that you'd buy me a steak dinner.",
        "Rachel: How did it happen? You've been refusing to play for months.",
        "Matthew: So you thought you were in the clear?",
        "Rachel: I'm just curious. Who or what convinced you to rock that concert at the community center the other day?",
        "Matthew: She did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: But --",
        "[Gigi gasps]",
        "Gigi: You were so horrible to me today when Stacy walked in on us.",
        "Rex: I -- I -- I know. And I hated doing that, Geege, but I had to. If what you're saying is true --",
        "Gigi: It is true.",
        "Rex: I know. I believe you. But that means that I'm going to have to pretend to be into Stacy. Otherwise, we'll never get the full story out of her and we will never find out whose stem cells she used to save Shane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. What are you doing in here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: It killed me letting you believe I was sleeping with Brody and Schuyler.",
        "Rex: It killed me to have to see you with them.",
        "Gigi: I was so scared, Rex. If I didn't stick to my promise to let that psycho have you, she would have let Shane die.",
        "Rex: I know. I get that now.",
        "Gigi: But being with other men, breaking up with you, that was all an act.",
        "Rex: And it was all an act for me when Stacy walked in on us.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God -- I thought --",
        "Rex: I never meant to --",
        "Gigi: I know. I know. Now I know how you felt, what I did to you all those months. And Shane, he can't even look at me. He thinks I'm a tramp. Oh, God. I'm sorry.",
        "Rex: You love me! You love our family!",
        "Gigi: I would do anything for you and Shane. Anything. And I'm going to make all of this up to you.",
        "Rex: We'll make it up to each other.",
        "Gigi: Shane's on his way to a baseball game with Moe. Let's call him and tell him.",
        "Rex: I -- no, I think we better wait.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Rex: I have to play Stacy. Get her to tell me who the real donor is in case, you know, Shane gets sick again.",
        "Gigi: God forbid.",
        "Rex: She's the only one who knows who saved Shane's life, right?",
        "Gigi: Wrong. Somebody else knows. Rex, this could all be over tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Renee, are you sick?",
        "Jared: We didn't even know.",
        "Renee: I'm all right. I'm just in for minor cosmetic surgery. I wanted to keep it quiet. You can't even tell, can you?",
        "Jared: What'd you get? Liposuction?",
        "Natalie: You look beautiful, as always. I am so sorry that we barged in here. We were looking for someone who was supposed to be in here. Are you sure that you're all right?",
        "Renee: Yes, as a matter of a fact, I just got the okay that I can get dressed and go home. And I think I'd like to do that, if you don't mind.",
        "Jared: Oh, of course. Uh -- yeah.",
        "Jared: I'm assuming Natalie's grandmother wasn't the person whose blood you took?",
        "Kyle: No way. The donor was in --",
        "Jared: You'd better not be playing us, you son of a bitch. Where's the owner of the stem cells? Who saved Shane Morasco's life?",
        "Natalie: You lied to us, and that's a bad move, seeing as how we got the D.A. to drop the charges.",
        "Kyle: I swear, the patient was in that bed and was in no shape to go anywhere. Except maybe the I.C.U. Because Shane's donor is here somewhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse Charles: Careful, Roxanne. You wouldn't want anything to happen to this.",
        "Roxy: I don't know what you want with that blood and I really don't care. But my grandson may need those stem cells and that's all that's left of them.",
        "Nurse Charles: It's your own fault you have this problem, you know? You were too much of a coward to tell your son who the donor really was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Kyle Lewis -- he's a lab tech at the hospital.",
        "Rex: Wait a second. Kyle Lewis? The one who got fired? Wait -- isn't he the bastard who blackmailed Jared and Natalie about Jessica's baby being dead?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, he's a real gem. He also helped Stacy fake being Shane's stem cell donor.",
        "Rex: Why? Money?",
        "Gigi: No. She doesn't have any. I'm guessing, she leaned over his desk and he saw the Promised Land.",
        "Rex: Okay, sit tight. I'm going to pay that S.O.B. a visit --",
        "Gigi: Wait. Natalie and Jared are with him. They're trying to cut a deal.",
        "Rex: What kind of deal? What do they have to do with this?",
        "Gigi: Well, Kyle dragged them into it. Okay, when Schuyler and I put together that Kyle knew who the real donor was, I went to see him at his room at the Angel Square. He promised me he would tell me, but only if I could convince Natalie and Jared to get him out of those blackmail charges.",
        "Rex: So, Jared and Natalie -- they know the truth.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler made me tell them. And they helped me see that I couldn't keep all this from you anymore. I was so scared. I had put you through so much already. I didn't even know if you would believe me. But they were right.",
        "Rex: I wish you'd come to me earlier.",
        "Gigi: I know. I know I hurt you.",
        "Rex: I -- I couldn't even see straight, Morasco. I didn't know which way to turn.",
        "Stacy: Well, you got him, Stace. Finally got him.",
        "Gigi: Stacy pounced on me when I thought our son was dying. She told me she could save him. Only there was a condition.",
        "Rex: You giving me up.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, and I'm such an idiot.",
        "Rex: You're not an idiot.",
        "Gigi: I knew she was after you. I mean, I was pretty sure she had drugged you to get you into bed that time, but I -- I just took her word for it that she was a match. I didn't make her prove it. So I just -- I dumped you and I kept my mouth shut while she tried to make you fall in love with her. I know -- it's disgusting to think about. I mean, you would never -- but I got to admit, for a while there, I was not so sure. I mean, the way you defended her all the time, which made me ill. And the way she moved in with you and you let her. And then my heart just stopped when Schuyler and I walked in on you in bed with her. I was so afraid she had gotten to you, but everyone told me that you would never be unfaithful. That you would never stop loving me.",
        "Rex: I -- I never did. I never stopped being crazy about you, Morasco. I love you so much.",
        "Gigi: I love you, too.",

        "Destiny: My brother Greg invited Shaun and me for dinner here tonight. But he's running a little late.",
        "Matthew: How late is he?",
        "Shaun: We're on our second bread basket.",
        "Destiny: You don't think he forgot, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "Nora and Clint: Oh, hi.",
        "Bo: Clint, uh, I talked to Matthew after he saw Dr. Evans and I can't thank you enough for bringing him to us. You know, I can't tell you --",
        "Clint: Bo, no need to thank me. It's the least I could do.",
        "Bo: It means a hell of a lot to Nora and me.",
        "Clint: I thought you told me you were working tonight.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I was, but I thought this was more important. Nora invited me to join you. We just wanted a chance to thank you properly.",
        "Clint: Great. Did you also invite Dr. Evans and his date?",
        "Nora: No -- no. But, you know what? Maybe they have some news for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: I'm sure he's real busy working on Matthew's case.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, he ran a bunch of tests on me today.",
        "Destiny: Yeah, that must be it. How did it all go, by the way? Isn't my brother awesome?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, he's a great guy. I really like him.",
        "Destiny: See?",
        "Rachel: Could I pull you away from your lovely date just for a second?",
        "Shaun: Sure.",
        "Destiny: So, uh, yeah -- about this morning. I never told Greg that you were my boyfriend.",
        "Matthew: It's okay. I already set him straight. I told him we were just friends.",
        "Shaun: Baby girl, Rachel and Matthew are going to join us, okay?",
        "Destiny: But where will Greg sit?",
        "Rachel: Oh, we'll just get a bigger table.",
        "Destiny: I don't see one.",
        "Matthew: Don't worry; the maitre d' will hook us up. My grandma owns the place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: Hey, you two, I would really appreciate it if you could keep this whole thing to yourselves.",
        "Natalie: Oh, um, it's just that after the whole thing with Jessica and the baby, Jared and I have -- we've sworn off the secret-keeping business.",
        "Renee: I see. It's just --",
        "Jared: But this isn't really a secret. This is nobody else's business, right?",
        "Natalie: Right. That's right.",
        "Renee: Thank you so much.",
        "Natalie: Don't mention it. You take care.",
        "Renee: Will do.",
        "Natalie: Love you.",
        "Renee: You, too.",
        "Natalie: You are so busted. Jared, do you have Nora's number in your phone?",
        "Jared: I have a better idea.",
        "Kyle: Wait, wait, wait a sec --",
        "Jared: Excuse me, Miss, um, the patient in 302 before Renee Divine was --",
        "Kyle: Comatose. Long-term. Non-responsive.",
        "Nurse: Oh, yes. I know who you're talking about.",
        "Jared: Great. Can you tell us where to find that person?",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry. That patient died a couple of months ago.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse Charles: You killed the real donor, Roxy. And now it's time to pay the piper.",
        "Roxy: What the hell do you want with that blood?",
        "Nurse Charles: Don't ask me. Ask my employer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What do you mean, the patient's dead? Who was it? Who was in that bed?",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry. I can't give out that information.",
        "Jared: Why not? You said the person's dead.",
        "Nurse: We maintain confidentiality regardless.",
        "Kyle: What? It's not my fault the donor --",
        "Jared: What was the name, Kyle?",
        "Kyle: I told you, I don't -- I don't remember.",
        "Natalie: Bull.",
        "Kyle: I -- I put it out of my mind. What I was doing was unethical enough, so --",
        "Natalie: Really? Because you have such a problem with that.",
        "Kyle: Look, okay -- I held up my end of the bargain. I brought you here. Okay, a deal's a deal. Charges stay dropped.",
        "Jared: You know more than you're saying, so unless you can convince us that there's nothing left --",
        "Kyle: There's nothing left!",
        "Jared: Deal's off.",
        "Natalie: I'm calling Nora.",
        "Kyle: Wait, wait, wait. There's one more thing, okay? Roxy asked me to draw some extra blood just in case.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Roxy? Roxy knows about this? She knows the name? She lied to us.",
        "Jared: She sure as hell did.",
        "Kyle: All I know is, Roxy and Stacy Morasco brought me here to room 302. I drew the blood. I gave the extra to Roxy.",
        "Jared: You better pray Roxy still has that blood.",

        "Stacy: Didn't I tell you to knock?",
        "Shane: I forgot. Cripe.",
        "Moe: What are you yelling at the -- kid?",
        "Moe: We thought we'd take Rex to the ballgame. Looks like he'll be back soon. We'll wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: God, how did I live without this?",
        "Rex: Just a little while longer, okay? Who else knows about this?",
        "Gigi: Well, Brody. Natalie, Jared, that creep Kyle Lewis, Schuyler Joplin. He is a great guy, Rex. He's the one who figured out what Stacy was up to, and he came to me. He's the reason we're standing here like this.",
        "Rex: Got it. Anybody else know?",
        "Gigi: Your mother.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, it's true. We think she's been in on it since Stacy first started blackmailing me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Employer? Who the hell do you work for? What kind of sicko would want that blood?",
        "Nurse Charles: Who's the sick one here?",
        "Roxy: You give me that blood or I'm going to fry you.",
        "Nurse Charles: Someone's at the door.",
        "Roxy: What? Ow!",
        "Nurse Charles: Gotcha.",
        "Roxy: Nice try. I don't even feel a thing.",
        "Nurse Charles: You want to know who I work for? The patient in room 302, who you think you killed. But you screwed that up like you screw up everything else. That'll teach you to mess with my patients.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Good evening.",
        "Nora: Good evening.",
        "Greg: I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Wright.",
        "Dr. Wright: Hello.",
        "Clint: Well, in your line of work, that's a great last name.",
        "Dr. Wright: It does come in handy.",
        "Greg: Vivian's a fellow neurosurgeon working at the hospital. She's helping me work up Matthew's case.",
        "Nora: Oh, so you know our son?",
        "Dr. Wright: He is a great kid. You must be so proud.",
        "Bo: Actually, I'm Matthew's father. I'm Bo Buchanan.",
        "Dr. Wright: Nice to meet you.",
        "Greg: And this is Nora Hanen.",
        "Nora: Hi, how are you?",
        "Clint: And I'm Clint Buchanan. I'm Matthew's uncle.",
        "Greg: Clint's the reason I'm here consulting on Matthew's case. The man tracked me down, wouldn't take no for an answer.",
        "Dr. Wright: Well, I guess that makes you the man of the hour.",
        "Nora: Well, that's exactly what I've been telling him.",
        "Clint: Well, I knew somewhere, somehow, there had to be some hopeful news about my nephew. And for his parents.",
        "Greg: Well, I know you're all anxious for my prognosis, but I haven't received all the test results back just yet.",
        "Bo: This morning you said that you could help Matthew walk. Has anything changed?",
        "Greg: No. No, not at all. I just need to see all the cards, know exactly the hand I've been dealt. Well, if you'll excuse us --",
        "Clint: Oh, yes -- yes. Enjoy your night.",
        "Nora and Clint: Nice to meet you.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. Could this really be happening? Could Matthew really walk again?",
        "Bo: I hope this guy's not blowing smoke.",
        "Clint: Bo, why would you say that?",
        "Bo: Well, this Dr. Evans -- seems like a bit of a showman to me. All right, I know -- hey, speaking of showmen, did Nora tell you about Matthew? His concert at the community center? He stepped in and took over, played the piano for the first time since the accident. I tell you -- blew everybody away.",
        "Clint: No, actually, Nora didn't mention anything about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: So, how are you folks tonight?",
        "Destiny: Good.",
        "Rachel: Uh, yeah, I'd like --",
        "Destiny: No, thanks. We're waiting for one more person. But we'll have some more bread.",
        "Waiter: Bread it is.",
        "Rachel: I think I'm going to go to the bar and get a drink.",
        "Shaun: All right. We'll be right back.",
        "Shaun: If my brother doesn't show, I am going to kick his narrow ass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Why don't you tell me what's good here? And then, after we order, you can tell me what else is good here.",
        "Dr. Wright: You are a very naughty boy.",
        "Greg: Ooh, sorry. I'll be right back.",
        "[Cell phone vibrates]",
        "Greg: Dr. Evans.",
        "Shaun: Where the hell are you?",
        "Greg: Shaun, what's happening, player?",
        "Shaun: What's happening? Did you forget you invited your little sister out to dinner tonight?",
        "Greg: Look, tell her to order whatever she wants. Charge it to my room.",
        "Shaun: Hell no.",
        "Greg: Look, Shaun --",
        "Shaun: Don't \"look, Shaun\" me. Destiny got all dressed up for you. She's counting on this. I don't care who you have to blow off, you just get it done, player.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Remember I called and said I couldn't meet you? Anyway, Bo -- Bo called me and if I hadn't raced down there, I would have missed the whole thing.",
        "Bo: Yeah, he played like a pro, Clint.",
        "Nora: Yeah, he sure did.",
        "Clint: Hey, wait a minute. Do you think Matthew would play the piano at our wedding? I mean, how great would that be? We'd have to run it by Charlie and Viki, of course, but I can't imagine that they would -- it is a double wedding. You know that, right?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah, I heard that. Uh, is it going to feel a little strange, though? You're up there at the alter with your ex-wife?",
        "Clint: I don't know, you tell me. Are you going to feel strange being up there with yours?",
        "Bo: Me? No. I'm not the groom, Clint. I won't be up there with Nora.",
        "Clint: Of course, you're going to be up there. Because, little brother, you're going to be my best man.",

        "Natalie: Roxy better be straight with us this time and she better have the blood.",

        "Stacy: Well, Rex is working at the club tonight, so he won't be home until very late. You don't want to miss the opening pitch, do you?",
        "Moe: You should probably grab some rain gear. We're in the grandstand. Forecast said showers.",
        "Moe: Looks like you cooked for two. Oh, but Rex won't be home for din-din, right? What did you make for your lonesome?",
        "Stacy: Hey!",
        "Moe: Oh, chicken fran\u00e7ais, huh? Do you dip it in flour first or egg?",
        "Stacy: Ahem. Well, uh, that depends, so --",
        "Moe: Uh-huh. And what proportion lemon juice to wine do you use? You can't fool me, missy. This is all from that new place down the street, Chef-To-Go. You're trying to pass off restaurant food as your own, just like you're trying to pass off yourself as someone who could take Gigi's place in Rex's heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You think Stacy and my mother teamed up to make us believe that Stacy was saving Shane's life?",

        "Gigi: Coming to you today was the first right thing I've done in a while. You know the truth now. You're on my side. I didn't lose you. I can't believe I finally have you back.",
        "Gigi: Is something wrong? You look funny. I mean, I know we don't have the real donor yet, but I didn't lose you, did I? I mean, you wouldn't have come here tonight if I had, right? Okay. At the club earlier, before I poured my heart to you, you said you had something to tell me. What was it?",

        "Roxy: What's going on? Where the hell am I?",
        "Natalie: Hey, Rox. Guess where Kyle took us today. The Boutet Clinic, room 302. Ring any bells?",
        "Kyle: It was either that or jail.",
        "Roxy: I'm going to throw you out of my hotel --",
        "Natalie: Hey, wait! Forget about getting even with Kyle for one damn minute, okay? You lied! You know who donated those stem cells -- in fact, you set it up, and now that donor is dead and I think you know about that, too.",
        "Roxy: I don't know nothing. My head is all fuzzy.",
        "Jared: Maybe this will clear it up. We will forget that you lied about this rather dire situation, you agree to help us out.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Why don't you help out your grandson, for God's sake!",
        "Jared: See, Kyle claims that he gave you an extra bag of blood from the patient in room 302.",
        "Roxy: I love my grandson -- I would do anything for Shane. I thought maybe someday he might need more blood.",
        "Natalie: Give us the blood and I will forgive you for every stinking lie you've been telling us.",
        "Roxy: I don't have it anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I -- feel like a world-class idiot, Morasco. I believed that you cheated on me; I believed you didn't love me anymore. You said you didn't trust me, you said you couldn't trust me. And -- and maybe you were right. But I swear, Gigi, I'd never have slept with Stacy --",
        "Gigi: I know, I know. That night that I found you in our bed with her, I know she set you up. I lied when I said your test results proved she didn't drug you -- I never got any test results. I was just looking for any excuse to make you think I was breaking up with you, and I'm so sorry.",
        "Rex: I'm sorry, too.",
        "Gigi: For what? You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I did. I blew it.",

        "Shane: No, I'm good!",
        "Moe: You want my advice? Order up some dessert. Rex is going to need something sweet to cut the bitterness of the lies you've been feeding him.",
        "Stacy: You know, you've got some nerve.",
        "Moe: Missy, you can put all the fake home-cooked food on the table you want in front of Rex, but he'll never stop loving Gigi.",
        "Stacy: Huh.",
        "Shane: I was stalling, hoping Dad would come home early.",
        "Moe: Hmm. Looks like your aunt was doing the same thing. But, it's just not working out, is it?",
        "Shane: Later, Aunt Stacy.",
        "[Door closes]",

        "Stacy: Yeah, hi. I need a delivery now, please. I'll take one of every dessert you have.",

        "Roxy: That wacko nurse stuck me with a needle and she stole the blood that could save Shane's life someday.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Roxy: I'm telling you the truth, Nattie. That's how I ended up on the floor.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Jared: You for real?",
        "Natalie: I mean, I -- I think she has to be because I don't even think Roxy would make this up.",
        "Jared: So who's this nurse and what the hell did she want that blood for?",
        "Roxy: I don't know. She said it was for someone she worked for, but she didn't tell me who.",
        "Kyle: What about me? We're straight, right? You're not going to reinstate the charges?",
        "Natalie: God, you know what, Kyle? You are the least of our problems right now.",
        "Jared: Kyle, get out of my sight before I give you the beating you deserve. Get going.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Roxy: Nattie? I didn't mean for this to happen. I love Shane. I would do anything for him. I tried to protect that blood with my life!",

        "Greg: Look, Shaun, just tell Destiny I'll make it up to her tomorrow.",
        "Shaun: I'm not telling Destiny a damn thing for you because we both know the promises you make ain't worth the air it takes for you to spit them out.",
        "Greg: So you're just going to let her sit there waiting?",
        "Shaun: If you have something to say to Destiny, you say it yourself.",
        "Greg: Fine. Put her on.",
        "Shaun: Greg called. He wants to talk to you.",
        "Destiny: Hey, Greg. Where are you?",
        "Greg: Hey, gorgeous. Look, sorry about dinner tonight. I got so wrapped up on your boyfriend's case that I completely lost track of time --",
        "Destiny: He's not my boyfriend.",
        "Greg: Right -- sorry. Anyway, I'm meeting with a colleague. We're talking over Matthew's options right now.",
        "Destiny: How long before you get here?",
        "Greg: Oh, sweetie. Look, I really want to devote tonight to Matthew's case. After all, that's what you asked me to come here for, right?",
        "Destiny: Right. Destiny out. My brother's with another doctor, working late on your case, 'cause he knows how much it means to me.",

        "Matthew: Yeah, what's the rush?",
        "Shaun: Rachel and I want to catch up on some music after we drop you two home.",
        "Destiny: So the youngins get the shaft?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it's summer. We could stay out late, and I want dessert, too.",
        "Rachel: I'm sure Nigel can make you a treat at home.",
        "Matthew: And I'm sure your mp3 player would love to play your favorite tunes but not now because you want to stay out, right? And so do me and Destiny.",
        "Shaun: Man, this kid can argue.",
        "Matthew: My mom's the D.A. It's genetic. And you know I'm right -- it's not fair for you to send us home just so you guys can listen to music.",
        "Shaun: Watch it, kid. Rain check?",
        "Rachel: Not even close. One of the advantages of staying with my mom is having a full-time staff, so I'll call Nigel and ask him to pick these two up when they're ready to go home.",
        "Shaun: Sounds good to me.",
        "Destiny: Man, you're good.",
        "Matthew: Hey, it gets me from A to B. So, have you seen the aquarium in the private dining room?",
        "Destiny: Now how would I have seen that?",
        "Rachel: And keep your cell phone on so Nigel can reach you.",
        "Waiter: Here you are, sir.",
        "Destiny: Greg told us to charge it to his room.",
        "Shaun: I wouldn't let my brother buy me water if I was in the desert, but I hope you'll let me buy you and Matthew dinner.",
        "Rachel: No, we horned in on your night.",
        "Shaun: Ah, it would've been a flop if you guys didn't show up. Let me spring for this.",

        "Greg: No, no, I'm sorry. It's -- and it's cool and the phone is off.",
        "Dr. Wright: Does that mean that you're mine now?",
        "Greg: All yours.",

        "Nora: Oh, my gosh. Between this morning and now, what a difference.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Bo: I'm going to call it a night, I think.",
        "Clint: Yeah, it might not be a bad idea. You ready to go home?",
        "Nora: Yeah, I'm a little tired.",
        "Clint: Well, before we turn in, I'll give you a foot rub.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, the shoes are a little much.",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "Nora: They spoil me.",

        "Rex: It's just --",
        "Gigi: I know! I know it has been hell since we found out Shane was sick, but he's better now. The bad times -- they're almost over. Hey, we are so close to having the life we always dreamed about, okay? We just have to make sure that we have backup cells for Shane, and then we can kick Stacy's ass to the curb.",
        "Rex: Thing is, I thought Stacy was on my side.",
        "Gigi: Sure you did. She was working you 24/7, and I couldn't tell you that she blackmailed me to break up with you without Shane paying the price.",
        "Rex: You -- you don't understand. I thought Stacy was the only person that I could trust.",
        "Gigi: I do. Trust me, I get it. I know that I broke your heart into a million pieces. I should've leveled with you from the very beginning.",
        "Rex: I really wish you had.",

        "Rex: So it's okay now, right? It's over? Gigi told me you guys went to Kyle Lewis to cut him a deal and tell us who Shane's real donor is, so that's what you're here to tell us, right? You know the truth about Shane's real donor?",

        "Matthew: Excited, but kind of scared, too. I mean, what if your brother can't help me?",
        "Destiny: Greg can help you.",
        "Matthew: I know, but it's still --",
        "Destiny: A lot to handle? There might be surgery and all that.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I'm glad you get it.",
        "Destiny: This is supposed to be a banana split? Two half-slices of banana, a teaspoon of ice cream, and chocolate dribbled around the edge of the plate?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I know. Mine's a bust, too.",
        "Destiny: Where are you going?",
        "Matthew: It's a surprise.",
        "Destiny: For me?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Wright: I, for one, am glad the Buchanans convinced you to come to Llanview. I've read all of your articles, but I never thought we'd get the chance to work together.",
        "Greg: Well, I certainly hope that we can do more than just work together.",
        "Shaun: Yo, Romeo! So this is the reason why you stood up our little sister tonight?",

        "Destiny: My granddad owned an auto body place once, but it got torn down for those mcmansions on Route 8.",
        "Matthew: That sucks.",
        "Destiny: Tell me about it. It must be nice to have a grandma who owns a restaurant and a hotel.",

        "Renee: Do you know who they were looking for?",
        "Nurse: Yes, but that patient's long gone.",
        "Renee: As in dead?",
        "Nurse: That's what the records say.",

        "Rex: You're telling us the person who saved Shane's life is dead, Roxy knows about it, and she won't talk?",
        "Natalie: No, I know, Rex. I mean, I was so mad at her, I just -- I could scream.",
        "Jared: But I did believe her when she said whatever she did, she did for Shane.",
        "Natalie: I mean, she -- she kept the blood.",
        "Rex: Yeah, except somebody came in and stole it from her.",
        "Jared: Yeah, well, Natalie thinks that it's too crazy even for your mother to have made up.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I mean, she claims that someone drugged her, the nurse stole the blood and -- and then just took off, so --",
        "Gigi: So she has no idea where it is now?",
        "Rex: The blood's gone, the donor's dead. Are you telling me that there's nobody to save Shane if he relapses?",
