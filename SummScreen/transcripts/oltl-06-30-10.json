        "Blair warns Ford to stay away from Langston. Eli reveals to Tea that he knows about her cancer. Todd assures Dani that Bull will not hurt Nate. When Tea sees Todd consoling Dani, she thinks Todd told Dani about T\u00e9a's cancer. Bull increases his ransom demand to $500,000 Blair and Eli go into the cabana to have sex and find Nate and Bull in there and Blair recognizes Bull as the man that returned Starr's phone at her graduation. Bull says he is Nate's father. After she and Eli leave, Blair sees Todd at the country club.",
        "Natalie and John look for evidence at Hannah's grandparents' cabin and find Cole's cell phone battery, a strand of hair, and a condom wrapper. They conclude that it seems unusual that Cole would sleep with Hannah. John finds out that a bus driver dropped Hannah and Cole off in Maryland. Layla and Cristian wake up in Maryland in the hotel room next to Hanna and Cole's. Cole decides to go back to Llanview. Cristian sees him in the hallway and promises to keep quiet about seeing him. Ford calls Layla and asks her what the police are doing to find Hannah. She tells him she is on vacation and he'd better be out of her apartment when she returns. Layla tells Cristian that Ford told her that Hannah attacked him. Cristian shares with Layla in confidence that he saw Cole. Cole discovers that his cell phone battery is missing and that Hannah's \"lost\" phone is in her purse. Hannah admits that the police aren't after him but are after her because they think she attacked Ford. He asks her if she did. Ford reads a note that someone left him lamenting that Ford lived, but saying he is in charge now anyway and instructing to follow his instructions because he will be watching him. Ford then gets a call from someone and confirms that he told the cops that Hannah attacked him even though it was a lie."

        "John: Had eyes on the house since Hannah escaped?",
        "Lynch: No one has gone in or out.",
        "John: Okay. Let's have a look. Chief, did you see anyone else with Hannah yesterday?",
        "Lynch: No, but she didn't let me inside. This the guy you're looking for?",
        "John: Yeah. It's Cole Thornhart. Any sign of him?",
        "Lynch: Hmm. I'll have my men ask around. What's she gonna do?",
        "John: Find any sign of him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Hey, T\u00e9a, how you doing?",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair told you, huh?",
        "Eli: Don't get angry. I dragged it out of her. You know me. I keep secrets for a living, just like you. Anything I can do?",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't stare.",
        "Eli: Sorry. Listen. You need anything at all, don't hesitate to call me, especially if you need help with Danielle.",
        "T\u00e9a: I got it covered.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: We should've heard by now.",
        "Todd: No. What time is it? Yeah. It's too early for a kidnapper.",
        "Dani: Well, you sure he didn't call back last night? Check your phone again.",
        "Todd: I checked it. I checked it last night. I would've called you if he called. You didn't sleep last night, did you?",
        "Dani: I'm scared for Nate.",
        "Todd: Don't be scared for Nate.",
        "Dani: That Bull guy could hurt him.",
        "Todd: Now, I made it clear to him that if he hurts Nate, he doesn't get any money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bull: Rise and shine, cupcake. It's time. Do or die.",
        "Bull: Let's go. Up and at 'em.",
        "Nate: You're letting me go?",
        "Bull: What, are you still dreaming? Why would I let you go? I'm trading you in. Cash refund.",
        "Nate: Mr. Manning called back.",
        "Bull: I do the calling, kid. I'm ready to do business.",
        "Nate: You think he has the money?",
        "Bull: Yeah, yeah. His little girl wants her boyfriend, so daddy will buy you back. What?",
        "Nate: It's nothing.",
        "Bull: What, you don't think daddy will cough up the cash? Well, he better, or you're not going home ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Uh-uh. I never should've told you about this.",
        "Todd: You wouldn't have your ransom without me.",
        "Dani: You yelled at Bull. You gave him orders.",
        "Todd: And?",
        "Dani: And he hung up the phone on you.",
        "Todd: Eh, he doesn't have very good manners. Kidnappers are not the better class of people.",
        "Dani: You turned off your phone.",
        "Todd: Maybe that'll teach him a lesson.",
        "Dani: What if he took off with Nate?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Okay. What would happen?",
        "Dani: He would kill him.",
        "Todd: Well, what good would that do him? Nate is worth nothing to him dead.",
        "Dani: So he keeps Nate.",
        "Todd: Oh, honey, do you have any idea what a pain in the ass it is to keep a hostage? Oh, they're terrible. They're whining all the time. They're complaining about how they're hungry, try to escape. No. Believe me, he wants to unload your friend as soon as possible, and I made it clear that it's gonna be worth his while to do so.",
        "Dani: You sure?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I've done this before. You did the right thing coming to me, by the way.",
        "Dani: How can you be so calm?",
        "Todd: That's what dads do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: So how's Danielle taking the news?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, it's hard to say, really.",
        "Eli: It's for the best that you told her. I mean, once Todd found out, it's gonna be pretty hard to keep it from her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair told you that Todd knows? You know, that girl cannot keep her mouth shut.",
        "Eli: T\u00e9a, I'm sorry, but everyone needs a confidant, even you, T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh...",
        "Eli: So how's Todd handling everything?",
        "T\u00e9a: Great, actually. He's gone with me to treatments. He's stayed with me when I've been sick after.",
        "Eli: Todd Manning nurses you when you're sick?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, believe it or not.",
        "Eli: Keeps up this behavior, even Dani might give him another chance, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: I hope so because once I'm gone, Todd is the only family she'll have.",
        "Eli: You know, I'll always think of her as a niece.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thanks, Eli.",
        "Eli: You'll call me if you need anything, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Okay, so call.",

        "Todd: Dani...trust me on this, all right? Everything is gonna be fine.",
        "Dani: You don't know that.",
        "Todd: I'm not gonna let anything happen to your boy Nate, all right? I know it looks bad, but--",
        "Dani: This is a nightmare.",
        "Todd: Here I am. You're not having to go through it on your own, right? We're gonna go through it together, you and me.",

        "Cristian: Well, we'll wait to tell her that we're getting married until after lunch.",
        "Layla: Well, then we need to grab a good breakfast, just to be on the safe side.",
        "Cristian: What do you think is gonna happen?",
        "Layla: I don't know.",
        "Cristian: Your mom could surprise you, you know?",
        "Layla: Or she could throw us out.",
        "Cristian: Or she could be happy that you're happy.",
        "Layla: No. That's your mom.",
        "Cristian: Your mom wants her daughter to be happy, too.",
        "Layla: Both daughters. She spent the last 3 years being Evangeline's voice, her protector.",
        "Cristian: Evangeline would be okay with us, Layla.",
        "Layla: I keep telling myself that.",
        "Cristian: Well, believe it. She'd give us her blessing. I'm sure of it. You know what? We won't leave until your mom does, too.",
        "Layla: Mm. Come here, you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: We can't go back to Llanview yet. Don't you want to find Starr?",
        "Cole: She can't stay away forever.",
        "Hannah: But if she's with that guy--",
        "Cole: She'll go home, okay? She has to. That's where I should be.",
        "Hannah: Look. Don't--",
        "Cole: Hope needs me.",
        "Hannah: I'm sure that Starr left Hope in good hands.",
        "Cole: I'm her dad, okay? I need to stay out of jail, but if they catch me out of state, I'm in big trouble unless John McBain helps me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Luminol didn't pick up anything in the bathroom or the kitchen.",
        "John: Good.",
        "Lynch: Luminol? You're looking for blood?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Lynch: Wait a minute. Wait. Hannah O'Connor can't be a killer, okay? I watched this girl grow up. Now, she is good people.",
        "John: Yeah, chief. That's what we heard, but, you know, this attack didn't come from nowhere.",
        "Natalie: I want to dust for fingerprints because I got nothing clean in the kitchen and the bathroom.",
        "John: Yeah. Go ahead.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "John: Look. Hannah, she had a relationship with this guy that she attacked, all right? He dumped her, and she didn't take it well.",
        "Lynch: All right. It's interesting. She told me that you're the one that had a thing for her.",
        "Natalie: Ha! She's good, but that's not true.",
        "John: No. Hannah had a well-documented history with the victim. He turned her loose and, like I said, she didn't handle it very well.",
        "Lynch: Well, it sounds like a lot of women could have it in for this guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You're certainly much better.",
        "Ford: Oh, yeah. They're probably gonna let me go home tomorrow. I need to get back in shape. I used to have a 10 pack.",
        "Blair: You are a shrunken, little man.",
        "Ford: Yeah. Well, you want to help me get back into shape?",
        "Blair: No. I don't, but I will give you a tip on how to get healthy.",
        "Ford: What's that?",
        "Blair: Stay away from Langston.",
        "Ford: Oh.",
        "Blair: Dorian says you're sniffing around her again.",
        "Ford: Hey, she came to see me.",
        "Blair: Well, it is not gonna happen again, and if you were smart, you'd stay far, far away from her.",
        "Ford: Or what, you're gonna take my head off?",
        "Blair: Think lower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Chief, I'm sorry, but Ford ID'd Hannah as his attacker. We have to bring her in.",
        "Lynch: Well, if Hannah is hung up on this Ford guy, then where does Cole Thornhart fit in?",
        "John: Well, it looks like she latched onto Cole after Ford dumped her.",
        "Lynch: And you're convinced that she could hurt him, too.",
        "John: Well, we have to rule that out, don't we?",
        "Lynch: Wait. You don't even know that he's with her.",
        "John: Chief, they disappeared around the same time, all right? No one has heard anything from either one of them since. Natalie... have a look at this.",
        "Lynch: What is it?",
        "Natalie: It's a cell phone battery, Smartphone, next generation.",
        "John: Exactly what Cole has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Well, what could John McBain do?",
        "Cole: I don't know. Sneak me back in town, go to bat with the judge if I get caught. I just don't want to put him in that position. You know, I just need to get back in town before anyone realizes that I'm gone. I just need to check my messages, and I'm sure my mom is looking for me.",
        "Hannah: It's too bad your phone is dead.",
        "Cole: Maybe I can talk to the front desk. Maybe they have a charger.",
        "Hannah: No. Don't go out there.",
        "Cole: What? There's no phone here. You lost your phone. What else can we use?",
        "Hannah: Let me go check the front desk.",
        "Cole: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look. It's just down the hall, okay? It's not like anyone knows us here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm gonna pick up some breakfast, and then we hit the road, okay?",
        "Layla: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: You gonna be here when I get back?",
        "Layla: Um, I'm the one who started this road trip, aren't I?",
        "Cristian: Not exactly.",
        "Layla: I'm not going anywhere but the shower.",
        "Cristian: All right.",
        "Layla: See you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Cristian: Cole... what are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I didn't mean that--",
        "Bull: What?",
        "Nate: I'm sure Dani's father will come through.",
        "Bull: Heard a lot of stuff about Manning.",
        "Nate: It's not all true.",
        "Bull: Yeah? Well, what about the part that he thinks he's God almighty and everyone else a cockroach that he can step on?",
        "Nate: He loves Dani, all of his kids.",
        "Bull: Even them he screws over. I figure it's 50-50 that he does right by you at best.",
        "Nate: He'll come through.",
        "Bull: You can hope, and I can plan in case Manning blows it.",
        "Nate: What is your plan?",
        "Bull: You don't want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I know this is rough for you, but I think you can take it, right? You're tough. You're a Manning. I know it feels like hell, but you'll survive.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd...",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "T\u00e9a: How could you? How could you tell her? How?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Cole's phone is still going straight to voice mail.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Well, now we know why. Serial number on the back of this battery is showing us this phone.",
        "John: That looks like Cole's.",
        "Natalie: We can contact the carrier to confirm.",
        "John: That'll take time.",
        "Natalie: Okay. So we keep looking. This bed looks like it's been recently used. If Hannah wanted Cole all to herself, maybe she got her wish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: This is weird.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: I've never been to Aberdeen, Maryland, in my life...",
        "Cole: Me, neither.",
        "Cristian: And there's somebody I know right next door.",
        "Cole: Yeah. So, um, what's going on?",
        "Cristian: Layla and I are on our way to see her mom to tell her that we're engaged.",
        "Cole: Oh, you are? Really? That's great. Congratulations. I think she's gonna be really happy.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Thanks, but she's not.",
        "Cole: Why?",
        "Cristian: There's a lot of history, long story, kind of like you and Todd.",
        "Cole: Oh, right.",
        "Cristian: It's lucky you made bail.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: You being in Maryland, you jumped bail, didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You're really focused below the belt, Blair.",
        "Blair: It's not like that, you little weasel.",
        "Ford: Too bad. It'd be the ride of your life.",
        "Blair: You are unbelievable.",
        "Ford: Hey, you want to think the worst about me, I'll give it to you.",
        "Blair: You know what? You're not gonna give me anything, and you're not gonna give Langston anything. She's not a toy that you can play with, Ford.",
        "Ford: No. She's an amazing woman.",
        "Blair: Who's off limits to you, and it's not gonna happen again.",
        "Ford: Why are you trying to scare me off?",
        "Blair: Fair warning. Back off.",
        "Ford: Why would I want to do that?",
        "Blair: Well, let's see here, maybe because your dirty laundry is all over town. Yeah. Every woman in town knows exactly what you did, and little Miss Hannah here, I mean, they're just praying that she is set free.",
        "Ford: Wait. Hannah is still out there?",
        "Blair: Are you scared, Ford? Angry Hannah is nothing compared to the wrath of the Cramer women. Stay away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Now, don't go ruining a beautiful, sunny day by reading the news. It's all bad.",
        "Eli: Admittedly, this is a better view.",
        "Blair: So, you have to be a lawyer today?",
        "Eli: Not today. Courts are closed. It's why I'm all yours, and it still gives me enough time to track Cole down.",
        "Blair: Want some help?",
        "Eli: No. I got some people on it, thank you. Don't worry. What about you? Anywhere you need to be today?",
        "Blair: Nope. Took care of a little business this morning at the hospital, but now I'm free as a bird.",
        "Eli: Yeah? What kind of business?",
        "Blair: I took care of Ford.",
        "Eli: Robert Ford? You went to see Ford?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Layla: What do you want?",
        "Ford: How did that nut job get away?",
        "Layla: What nut job?",
        "Ford: Is your boss even looking for Hannah?",
        "Layla: What are you talking about?",
        "Ford: Hannah O'Connor. She's the girl that attacked me. John McBain is supposed to be tracking her down.",
        "Layla: She's the one who tried to kill you?",
        "Ford: Yes.",
        "Layla: Why?",
        "Ford: I don't know. She's a confused little girl. I'd like to know what's going on over there.",
        "Layla: I'm not at the police station, Ford.",
        "Ford: Well, if you were, would you tell me? Come on, Layla. I almost died.",
        "Layla: That's the only reason I didn't hang up on you 5 minutes ago. You know, you're one of the skeeviest manwhores I've ever met, Ford, and I lived in L.A.",
        "Ford: I just want to know what the police are doing to track down Hannah.",
        "Layla: Then call John McBain. I'm on vacation, and your stuff better be out of my apartment before I get back, or I'll burn it. Good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You're supposed to be in Llanview, right, or at least Pennsylvania.",
        "Cole: Right. I've been looking for Starr. She took off a few days ago.",
        "Cristian: Is she okay?",
        "Cole: Well, we've been having our problems.",
        "Cristian: Right, so you jumped bail to find her. How does that help?",
        "Cole: I know. I know. That's why I'm heading home. I swear. I'm checking out and going back to Llanview.",
        "Cristian: Good call.",
        "Cole: You gonna turn me in?",
        "Cristian: As far as I know, you're still in Llanview, but make sure nobody else catches up to you.",
        "Cole: Thanks, man.",
        "Cristian: Yep.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Layla: You'll never believe what I just heard. Where's breakfast?",
        "Cristian: Well, the food in the lobby looked kind of stale, so I figured we'll just pick something up on the way. What'd you hear?",
        "Layla: Ford just called me. He remembered who attacked him.",
        "Cristian: Who?",
        "Layla: Hannah O'Connor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Well, the guy at the front desk had my same phone. Finally, something is going my way...",
        "Hannah: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Only he wanted $20 an hour for charging fee, but it's not gonna take long. All I have to do is check my messages and call John, see if he can get me back in town under the radar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lynch: I'm gonna check in with my men, see if they've picked up Hannah's trail.",
        "John: Thanks, chief.",
        "Lynch: It's my job.",
        "Natalie: Chief Lynch does not love his job today.",
        "John: Yeah. Well, you know, he thinks he knows Hannah. This doesn't sound like her. I know the feeling.",
        "Natalie: Think this sounds like Cole?",
        "John: I wouldn't have thought.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Me, neither. I mean, I didn't know Cole all that well, but I thought he and Starr were pretty solid.",
        "John: Might have been rough. You know, once Cole went after Manning, Starr was caught between them.",
        "Natalie: And Hannah was right there for him.",
        "John: Mm.",
