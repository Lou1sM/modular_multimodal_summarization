        "Marcie calls her lawyer friend Judy over to discuss the \"hypothetical\" situation of a pregnant teenage girl giving her baby up for adoption to her and Michael. But she does not reveal just whom this girl is. Meanwhile, the fortune teller whom Dorian has invited to the house reveals to Starr that there is some sort of \"conflict\" involving her baby. Blair doesn't want her daughter to believe a word the fortune teller says. But she has some insights about how Starr needs to go and talk to Cole. And she also reveals to Blair that Todd is involved in some sort of \"business\" with a woman from his past, although she does not reveal whom the woman is. Meanwhile, Marty is beginning to trust Todd, still with no memory of him. Cole tells Markko he won't let Starr give the baby up for adoption. Markko tells Cole he must attempt to reach out to Starr and see it from her point of view. Jessica has turned into Tess and is ready to make Natalie and Jared believe she is herself, (not Tess), that she is no longer angry at them nor blames them for Nash's death. Natalie buys right into that although Jared does not. The fortune teller finds herself right at the place where Marcie and Michael live, as if she knows that there is some significance between them and Starr's baby."

        "Todd: Hey, what do you want for lunch? What are you doing?",
        "Marty: I'm getting the hell out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Are you okay?",
        "Delphina: Me? Phew -- I'm fine. It's the kid who's in trouble.",
        "Starr: Okay, well what's wrong? What do you see?",
        "Delphina: Well, I -- I -- do you think I could have a glass of water? And not the cheap stuff, bottled.",
        "Langston: Yeah, sure.",
        "Starr: Listen to me. If there is something wrong with my baby --",
        "Delphina: Oh, well, your baby -- oh, thank you, sweetheart. Your baby, not to alarm you, is in grave danger.",
        "Blair: Starr, sweetheart, what's wrong? You're as white as a ghost. Delphina?",
        "Starr: She says that the baby is in trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey. What?",
        "Markko: Where have you been?",
        "Cole: Around. I had stuff to do.",
        "Markko: Like what? Langston's been driving me nuts. She said Starr's tried to call you like 900 times.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I know.",
        "Markko: So why don't you call her? Text or something.",
        "Cole: Because we'd just end up in a fight. That's why.",
        "Markko: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, I don't. I've never gotten a girl pregnant before. And that's probably not going to happen any time soon. Langston won't even let me look at her, thanks to you, bro.",
        "Cole: Sorry.",
        "Markko: I mean, it's bad enough Dr. Lord thought I got Langston pregnant. The woman came after me with scissors. And to have all this adoption stuff to deal with --",
        "Cole: Hey, you know what? There's not going to be any adoption. Nobody's taking my kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Thank you so much for coming.",
        "Judy: Any time you need me, Marcie. I'm always happy to help. How have you been?",
        "Marcie: Not bad. Pretty good, actually, all things considered.",
        "Judy: You look good, calmer.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well, my life's changed since I last saw you last.",
        "Judy: Sam's placement hearing.",
        "Marcie: Thank you. Thank you for that. A lot of people that feel for me, they still call him Tommy. But that's not who he is anymore. And you helped me to see that. You walked me through all the way to the end, and I will always be grateful to you for that.",
        "Judy: Marcie, what happened to you wasn't your fault. And I'm not saying you didn't make mistakes. But you were the victim of circumstances. Thank goodness you were strong enough and smart enough to start over.",
        "Marcie: That's kind of why I wanted to talk to you. I was wondering -- do you think it's possible for Michael and I to adopt another child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jess, how did you find us here?",
        "Tess: You can't hide from me, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: No, no, I'm not hiding. I mean, we came to the church.",
        "Tess: And hid in the back.",
        "Natalie: Because we didn't want you to see us. We were trying to respect --",
        "Jared: It's okay. Is there a reason you're here, Jessica?",
        "Tess: Do you mean why am I not at the cemetery? Why am I not at Nash's grave?",
        "Jared: No, that's not what I meant.",
        "Tess: Anyway, I just came from there. It's over. They buried him.",
        "Natalie: Jessica, we're so sorry.",
        "Tess: And nothing you can say will change that.",
        "Jared: So why are you here?",
        "Tess: May I?",
        "Natalie: Of course, please -- come in.",
        "Tess: Must be tough living here after what you've been used to.",
        "Jared: We'll survive.",
        "Tess: Yeah, you're good at that. Both of you. You wish I wasn't here.",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Jared: We wish things were different.",
        "Tess: They're not. They're not different. This is what we have to work with, two very guilty people and me. I'm surprised you'd even let me in here, given the way I feel, what I said at the church.",
        "Natalie: You're my sister.",
        "Tess: It's too late for that now. It's way too late. Are you scared? Because if I was you, I'd be terrified.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Look at you, you can barely sit up. Where are you going to go?",
        "Marty: Outside.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh. If you fall, you know, you're going to wind up in a hospital.",
        "Marty: I've fallen once and I probably will again.",
        "Todd: You don't have the strength to stand. You go outside and fall, you're going to blow those vertebrae again, who knows what else might happen? Your lupus could turn up again.",
        "Marty: Thanks, but I think I know my body better than you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What the hell are you doing here, Delphina?",
        "Delphina: Yo, yo, Mama, chill. Your aunt invited me. In fact, she paid me to do a reading on your mother.",
        "Langston: It was a wedding gift.",
        "Blair: Well, she should have given her a toaster. Because my daughter and I don't take advice from sideshow queens.",
        "Delphina: I've never worked a sideshow in my life.",
        "Starr: Okay, Mom, she gave a really great reading.",
        "Langston: She knew the color of David Vickers' boxers.",
        "Blair: Along with half the population of Las Vegas.",
        "Langston: And there was the thing with the dog.",
        "Delphina: You know, sweetheart, do you think I could get some ice with this?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Delphina: Thanks.",
        "Starr: The point is that she knows things.",
        "Blair: Starr, that's what she wants you to think, because she wants to scare you. My daughter doesn't need to be scared right now. She's pregnant.",
        "Delphina: Yeah, well, you don't need a psychic to tell you that.",
        "Starr: Am I really showing that much?",
        "Blair: Starr, excuse me. Delphina, please, get out.",
        "Delphina: Hey, I am just the messenger.",
        "Blair: You're a scam artist. And how dare you stand here and tell her her baby is sick.",
        "Delphina: Did I say sick? Did I use the word sick? Girls, back me up here.",
        "Langston: She never said sick.",
        "Starr: She said grave danger.",
        "Delphina: See, the baby is fine, physically. But spiritually, the deck's stacked against him. And, no, I don't know if it's pink bootie time or blue bootie time. All I know is that there's going to be a war fought over this child, and no one's going to win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: So you're still thinking about keeping the kid.",
        "Cole: No, I'm not thinking about it, Markko. The baby's mine.",
        "Markko: Well, I get that. It's just -- it's a lot. I mean, I see what my parents have to go through just to take care of us.",
        "Cole: Yeah, because that's wt parents do, all right? And that's what I'm going to do.",
        "Markko: All I'm saying is, it's hard.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I know it's hard. All right, so what? It's all going to be worth it.",
        "Markko: Hey, I want to have a kid. I do, someday, eventually. But there's a lot of stuff that I want to do first. I mean, I've got this friend, Bobby Ramone. You know him, right? So he just got this Japanese motorcycle. Man, I started saving up to get one, too. And we were thinking about, you know, maybe taking some time off next summer. Just cruising down all the way to where the Atlantic meets the pacific. How cool is that?",
        "Cole: Have fun.",
        "Markko: Look, I don't mean to get you down, man. It's just what you're saying, it's a lot. All right? It's life over, man. You can forget about college. You can forget about, well, anything, except for working some crap job and taking care of a kid. And I mean 24-7. You ready for that? I'm not. I mean, if a kid and me had to live off the salary that I make right now, and if I couldn't just kick back and have some time to do stuff, like something just for fun -- no, no, no, no. I am way too young to stop living. You're too young.",
        "Cole: Hey, come on, man. Listen to me. You never had anything bad happen to you in your life. Huh? Besides getting that D in physics, right? But nothing really bad. My dad got murdered. I watched my mom blow up in a van right in front of me. Yeah, I had people take care of me and look after me, which is great. And I'm not saying that jumping on a motorcycle and heading all the way down to Patagonia is bad or is wrong. That sounds great, go for it. Have fun. But for me, having a son or daughter, starting something new, that's the adventure for me, man.",
        "Markko: And if Starr doesn't feel the same way?",
        "Cole: Starr's too scared of her dad to feel anything.",
        "Markko: Well, hey, the guy hung me on a meat hook. He's sick. And I mean in the bad way.",
        "Cole: I know, tell me about it. But you know, he's done a lot worse to me, s--",
        "Markko: So, how is this going to go, you know, after she has the baby? I mean, if she decides to put it up for adoption --",
        "Cole: I'd take custody. See, I'm not giving up my kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I didn't come here to fight. I came here to give you these. They're from the burial.",
        "Natalie: I don't know what to say.",
        "Tess: There's nothing to say. Mom bought them. Anyways, everybody dropped one in the grave and said something. It was nice. Horrible, but nice. So I thought maybe you guys would want to go to the cemetery and say something. Or you can just toss them.",
        "Natalie: No, we'll go to the cemetery. Thank you.",
        "Tess: You came to the church. I thought maybe you wanted to be a part of it -- anyway.",
        "Jared: Thank you, Jessica. This is kind of you.",
        "Tess: No, it's what Nash would have wanted. I'm doing it for him. It's what he deserves. He deserves to hear both of you say how sorry you are. What you said at the church.",
        "Natalie: Listen, um -- I'm sorry. We just shouldn't have just come without asking you. That was wrong. We should have asked first. I'm really sorry.",
        "Tess: No. I'm the one that should be sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judy: I thought you and Michael had decided not to pursue adoption.",
        "Marcie: I know that we discussed the chances of adopting through an agency and that, given my record, it really wouldn't be an option.",
        "Judy: Agencies are responsible to their boards, their clients, and the law. And you're right. Given your record, you wouldn't meet their requirements.",
        "Marcie: So then there's no chance? I mean, we couldn't even maybe go through another state that's more lenient, or another country?",
        "Judy: I'm no expert in international agencies, but any agency here at home would probably discourage you. And as your attorney, I'd have to advise against you expending any energy and money in pursuing something that probably wouldn't work out.",
        "Marcie: So then there's no chance. I mean, there have to be other options, though. Right? I mean, if we knew someone who was willing to give us a child, we wouldn't have to go through an agency, would we?",
        "Judy: Are we talking about private adoption?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about -- I mean, what I'm asking you. I'm asking you if that's an option for people like us. Good parents. If we could find a girl who was willing to give us a child and she couldn't keep her child for whatever reason -- I mean, hypothetically -- could you transfer the custody of the baby over to us if the mother agreed and then --",
        "Judy: Do you know someone who's willing to give you her child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: You'd just take the baby?",
        "Cole: It's my kid, okay? I spoke to a lawyer and if the mother doesn't want to raise the child --",
        "Markko: Whoa, whoa -- you got a lawyer?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I got a lawyer. I needed to know where I stood. And it turns out that in the state of Pennsylvania the father does have rights, okay? So if Starr doesn't want to raise the child, she can't give it away to strangers unless I sign off on it, which is not going to happen.",
        "Markko: All right, so I'm just trying to wrap my brain around this. You're going to sue Starr?",
        "Cole: No, I'm not going to sue Starr. I don't have to, because once she has the baby, all I have to do is prove I'm the father and then she can't stop me from raising my own kid.",
        "Markko: By yourself.",
        "Cole: Nora said she would help out, you know? And she said we could live with her in that big place, and then John said he could help out when he could.",
        "Markko: No, no, I mean without Starr. Because you know what will happen. You go after her with some sort of lawsuit, and you will lose her. Are you ready for that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: We're talking a teenage pregnancy here. It doesn't take a psychic to figure out it's a very serious situation.",
        "Starr: Okay, but Mom, I want to hear what she has to say.",
        "Blair: Come here. That's exactly what she wants. This is how she operates. She wants to scare you, get you to buy into it. That's how she makes her money.",
        "Delphina: Ha! That's what Asa said about you.",
        "Blair: Ha! When's the last time you talked to old Asa? He's dead.",
        "Delphina: I read his book.",
        "Starr: So wait, who is going to be in this war? I mean, is it my dad?",
        "Blair: Come on, Starr. Of course your dad's going to want to fight over this baby once he finds out. It doesn't take a psychic to tell you that. And you can keep your mouth shut.",
        "Starr: But it's not just my dad, is it?",
        "Delphina: No, it's someone else. Todd? But not yet. He's got other fish to fry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Of course not. No, I don't know anything about your body -- or your fractures or anything. I just know that you're in no way healed and that if you try to walk you could fall and set yourself back months. Is that what you want?",
        "Marty: I want some fresh air. I want to feel the sun on my skin.",
        "Todd: Well, you definitely will when you're ready.",
        "Marty: What am I supposed to do in the meantime?",
        "Todd: Well, you can watch television, you could read.",
        "Marty: No, I can't concentrate.",
        "Todd: Well, what did you do up until now?",
        "Marty: Lee used to read to me.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry, I don't read.",
        "Marty: So tell me a story.",
        "Todd: I don't know any stories.",
        "Marty: Tell me the truth. Huh -- about you. Let's start with why did you take on the responsibility of caring for me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: My God, Jessica, you have no reason to apologize to us.",
        "Tess: Yes, I do. I said some pretty cruel things.",
        "Natalie: You're grieving.",
        "Tess: And so are you. I was angry and I shouldn't have taken it our on you. You know, you've stood by me so many times. You didn't deserve that, no matter how I felt.",
        "Natalie: So you don't hate me?",
        "Tess: How could I hate you? You're my sister. I was just looking for someone to blame and it was convenient to blame you, seeing as you lied to us all about Jared and, you know, you're the reason that we lost B.E. and the vineyard. But, you know -- the truth is, Nash's fall was an accident. You didn't mean for it to happen.",
        "Natalie: Jessica, no, I would never want to hurt you or Nash. I mean, I love you. I loved him. I'm so sorry, Jess.",
        "Tess: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I know that Starr and I aren't getting along right now, but we'll get past it.",
        "Markko: How, by siccing lawyers after her? By taking her kid? This is not the kind of thing that is just going to blow over.",
        "Cole: Okay, Markko, it's my kid, too. And Starr's the one who wants to back out. Okay, you know, I'm not making her keep the kid. If she doesn't want the kid, that's fine. But if she's going to give it away, she's going to give it to me.",
        "Markko: All right, all right. So, how's this going to work? She gives you the kid, you raise it, and then she comes over and her kid is there, like with you?",
        "Cole: I'm not going to let her give my kid up for adoption. I mean, that's it, end of story.",
        "Markko: So talk to her.",
        "Cole: What do you think I've been doing? I did that already.",
        "Markko: Then talk to her again. Cole, this is huge.",
        "Cole: I know that, what do you think I've been talking about this whole time?",
        "Markko: Cole, this is huge, for both of you, all right? I've seen my mother get pregnant, and it is hard, all right? She yells more, she cries more, her ankles get all swollen and gross. I wouldn't want to have to deal with it. That's for sure. But my dad, my dad, he was always there for her. He was, like, giving her back massages and cooking her dinner. And I swear that's why they're still married.",
        "Cole: You know, Markko, I was ready to do all that. I get that Starr's going through a lot right now. I get that. But when we came back from the beach, it's like she just -- she completely folded. It's like we're on complete opposite sides now.",
        "Markko: That's what I'm saying. You're going to lose her. And I know you don't want to lose your kid. This is your girl. You've got to reach out to her.",
        "Markko: I've got to get back to work. You will work this out. Just don't do anything stupid. Hold off on the lawyers until you talk to her. And whatever happens, I've got your back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How much do you think it would cost for a reading?",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no, no, Starr. I want you to take your little tarot cards or whatever voodoo things that you have here and leave, okay?",
        "Delphina: I don't need props for a reading. The boy with two strikes against him is trying to reach you. You should go to him, and you too.",
        "Blair: See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. You put out this vague garbage and then she waits around for you to make it mean something.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Langston: It's Markko. M-A-R-K-K-O. Two Ks. That's how you write a strike in baseball.",
        "Delphina: Ha.",
        "Blair: Oh, please.",
        "Starr: Wow, that is crazy.",
        "Delphina: I'm just the messenger.",
        "Starr: See, Mom? She knows things.",
        "Blair: No, she knows how to reel you in.",
        "Langston: Hello?",
        "Markko: What's going on?",
        "Langston: Nothing, just some people over. What's up?",
        "Markko: I just wanted to give you a heads up. I'm going to be a little late. Jimmy called in sick today and I'm stuck here until the manager gets in.",
        "Langston: No, that's fine. Starr's psychic actually said we need to come see you, anyway.",
        "Markko: Starr's what?",
        "Langston: Never mind. We'll be right over.",
        "Markko: Wait, wait. Uh, that might not be such a good idea.",
        "Langston: Why?",
        "Markko: Because Cole's here.",
        "Langston: No, that's perfect. Don't let him leave. We'll be right there.",
        "Starr: It's just information, Mom.",
        "Blair: It's just a scam.",
        "Langston: We've got to go.",
        "Delphina: Remember, sweetheart, your family's watching you.",
        "Langston: Thank you.",
        "Starr: Okay, where are we going?",
        "Blair: You, too. You, too, Mrs. Know-it-all.",
        "Delphina: No, no, no, I am not through with you yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Cole's at the diner. You can finally talk to him.",
        "Starr: Wait, Langston. The last time I talked to him he was really mad at me.",
        "Langston: He's calmed down by now.",
        "Starr: Then why hasn't he called me back?",
        "Langston: Come on.",
        "Starr: Langston?",
        "Langston: Because he thinks he knows exactly what you're going to say. You've made up your mind. And I'm not saying that it's easy to give up your kid, but you're willing, and he's not. So you may have to be the first person to reach out.",
        "Starr: But I'm not going to change my mind, okay? And what is Cole going to think when I've decided to give the baby to Marcie McBain?",
        "Blair: You know, you can take Dorian for everything she's got. See if I care. But you will not get your claws into my daughter. You got it?",
        "Delphina: You're not mad at me.",
        "Blair: No?",
        "Delphina: No. You're mad about the divorce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Who are you, Todd Manning?",
        "Todd: It depends on who you ask.",
        "Marty: Oh, married? Kids? Tell me something interesting then.",
        "Todd: Like what?",
        "Marty: Like how do we know each other?",
        "Todd: I told you. We went to college together.",
        "Marty: You didn't tell me what college. It was Llanview University, wasn't it?",
        "Todd: Do you remember?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judy: Do you know someone who is willing to give you her child?",
        "Marcie: I just wanted to know if it was possible, hypothetically.",
        "Judy: We've known each other a long time, Marcie. If you want my advice, you're going to have to trust me.",
        "Marcie: I do trust you, Judy. There's just other people involved.",
        "Judy: So? Talk to me as a friend.",
        "Marcie: There's a girl. She's 16. She can't keep her baby, obviously. She's a kid herself, and she approached me about adopting her baby because she knows that Michael and I would take really good care of it.",
        "Judy: And what did you tell her?",
        "Marcie: I said no. I just -- I didn't think it would be fair to Michael to stir up all those emotions again, but then I started thinking --",
        "Judy: You started thinking about it. Is this girl aware of your history?",
        "Marcie: Yes. She knows everything. In fact, I think that's partly why she wants to do this, because she thinks everything that happened was unfair. And she knows Sam. She knows how much we loved him, and she knows that we would be really great parents, and I sound absolutely pathetic. I sound pathetic.",
        "Judy: No, never. But what I have to say to you, as a friend, is that 16-year- old girls are notoriously unreliable, and while she may love you and Michael and want to make things right for you, that doesn't mean that when push comes to shove, she won't back down. I just don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Marcie: Judy, I know the downside here. You -- you know I know it. But given our other options, that there aren't any -- I know that it's risky, and I know that we may be disappointed. But I don't want to live my life like this anymore, Judy. I don't want to go through life being afraid of pain. So if there is a chance, even if it's a small chance that I could have a child, and that we could have a family, I -- I think that it's worth it.",
        "Judy: So what are you asking me, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Was I wrong? Was I wrong to turn her down? If she's willing, and we're willing, then do you think there's any chance at all that we could do a private adoption?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You're going to give your baby --",
        "Starr: Shh.",
        "Langston: To Mrs. McBain?",
        "Starr: That's my plan.",
        "Langston: And she agreed? She's going to adopt your --",
        "Starr: She didn't exactly agree, but --",
        "Langston: What do you mean, she didn't exactly agree?",
        "Starr: Okay, she said no.",
        "Langston: Starr!",
        "Starr: Langston, look, I know she really wants to, okay? Losing Sam, it broke her heart.",
        "Langston: Hold on. And why did she lose Sam again? Because he was your dad's son, and this is what, your dad's grandchild? Do you really think he's going to --",
        "Starr: Okay, it's not up to my dad.",
        "Langston: You're a minor, Starr.",
        "Starr: So what?",
        "Langston: He's your father. I know about this stuff. The courts are going to want to side with him. And you know the way your dad is. Do you really think the McBains are going to want to go up against him again after what happened to Sam?",
        "Starr: Okay, wait, Sam was my dad's son. This is my baby.",
        "Langston: And Cole's.",
        "Starr: You're right, and Cole was so worried about giving the baby to strangers, but the McBains, they aren't strangers. They're like -- they're like family, and they would be the best parents in the entire world. And this way, Cole could see the baby. I'm sure Mrs. McBain would let Cole be a part of the baby's life.",
        "Langston: Okay, look, all I'm saying is it's not going to be easy. And you've got your dad. I mean, who knows what your mom's going to say when it really comes down to it? And Cole, I mean --",
        "Starr: You know what, Langston? It's not up to them.",

        "Delphina: Your mother's worried about you.",
        "Blair: You told my mother?",
        "Delphina: No, mothers -- they just know about these things.",
        "Blair: My mother hasn't -- she always has had a very soft spot for Todd.",
        "Delphina: You know, Blair, it's you that has the soft spot, in your head. That's why she's worried about you. You say that you're done, but you're really not.",
        "Blair: Look, I've been married to the man more times than I can count. We have two kids together. I mean, it's very difficult for me to walk away from him. But he has the emotional maturity of a hamster, and he has zero impulse control, okay? And -- oh, my God, I can't even believe I'm defending myself to a total hustler. Oh, my God.",

        "Todd: Football.",
        "Marty: You're kind of skinny for a football player.",

        "Todd: No, not exactly.",
        "Marty: What, a nerd?",
        "Todd: No, no, no. You were smart but you weren't a nerd.",

        "Cole: Yeah, what did you tell her?",
        "Markko: Nothing. Man, I didn't even talk to her. In fact, I told Langston to hold up, but they're on their way over. If you don't talk to her, if you just sic some lawyers after her --",
        "Cole: Come on, would you stop saying that? I'm not siccing anyone on her.",
        "Markko: That's what it's going to feel like to her.",
        "Cole: Who are you?",

        "Cole: Okay, okay, so I don't have a say?",
        "Markko: You do. That's my point. You got to tell her how you feel. Make her understand. That's your plan, man. I'm telling you. Look, you're always saying how Starr is like the best thing that's ever happened to you. Are you ready to lose her?",

        "Natalie: Yeah, the last few days, knowing that I couldn't talk to you or be there for you, I mean, I -- I felt so awful.",
        "Tess: Well, we can't have that, now can we? You know, we should be moving forward, not backwards. We shouldn't dwell on this. Anyways, I should --",
        "Natalie: Wait, I'm sorry, Jess, I -- okay, I know this is asking a whole lot, and I want you to know how much I really appreciate your forgiveness, but -- Jared's sick over what happened.",
        "Jared: Nat --",
        "Natalie: He won't ask you for forgiveness because he thinks he doesn't deserve it.",
        "Jared: I don't. The fall was an accident, but the rest of the stuff I did -- buying into the vineyard and taking over your lives, it was selfish.",
        "Natalie: Okay, but you were --",
        "Jared: I put this plan in motion, and I wasn't willing to back down. Not for anyone.",
        "Natalie: Because of Tess, Jared, okay? But when you were here for a while, you know, you changed, and we were planning on telling everyone as soon as Charlie told Mom.",
        "Jared: That doesn't change the fact that I put Nash's business, his home, and his family, and as it turned out, his life at risk. And I have to carry that for the rest of my life. So do you. So I just want to say I'm sorry. And I'm not asking for anything.",
        "Tess: Good, because I don't know if I can forgive you, Jared. But I have to move on. I can't dwell on it. I have my kids to think of, so -- besides, you know, you didn't hold those two years in jail over me, so I owe you one.",

        "Judy: Knowing Michael, I'd say he's not worried for himself, he's worried for you.",

        "Delphina: Look, lady, you want to mock me? Do it on your own time. All I know is, your soon-to-be ex-husband is up to his eyeballs with another woman, not your daughter. Though, she will be affected.",
