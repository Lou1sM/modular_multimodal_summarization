        "Ricky: You don't look glad. You look upset.",

        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: You got to make sure he clears everything you say? I don't remember you doing that with me.",
        "Blair: I wasn't doing that, Todd.",

        "Natalie: So does this mean you're going to change your plea to guilty?",
        "David: Can we just dispense with the legalities for a minute? John, I stood in front of your father with a gun in my hand. I was sweating, I was scared, and I remember the look on his face. Because it's the same look that I see on your face, knowing that I'm the guy that you've wanted to kill for 25 years.",
        "John: So you're the guy, you should have no problem telling me every detail about the night my father was killed.",

        "Kevin: You keep saying you want to have a child with me? Well, maybe fate has done me a favor, huh? Maybe you can find someone else to experiment with, huh? Maybe someone else is willing to roll the dice with an innocent life, but not me. Better yet, why don't you run out and find Duke. What the hell, he's only my son. I'm sure he would love to give you what you want.",
        "Hugh: Kelly? Kelly? Are you ok? Did you hurt yourself running? Why are you sitting alone on a park bench this late at night?",
        "Kelly: I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Liquor's not really going to solve this problem. It just postpones the pain.",
        "Kevin: Oh, believe me, I am feeling no pain.",
        "Viki: I so don't believe you.",
        "Kevin: You're right. You're right. I came here tonight because -- because I'm so mad. I'm just -- I'm just as mad as hell at my dead son, and I don't know what to do about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I would do anything to make you feel safe again, anything.",

        "Rex: I'm going to make sure you always feel like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: What kind of a man is angry at his dead son?",
        "Viki: Kevin, of course you're angry. Sweetheart, you were betrayed on just about every level I can think of. And then you were forced to make a horrible, untenable decision, and then you were left pretty much alone.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, but he's my son.",
        "Viki: He screwed up, honey, big-time. And you never had the chance to get back what you had.",
        "Kevin: I just can't stop thinking about them together. It just --",
        "Viki: I know. And I can understand you wanting to forget, block it out. But that -- that doesn't work.",
        "Kevin: He said he was sorry, before -- before he died. All I can feel is anger.",
        "Viki: Well, lots of people are angry at death.",
        "Kevin: It's just ironic, isn't it? I mean, I had to choose Duke or Kelly, and I lost them both. I mean, it's like Duke -- it's like everything that mattered died with him. And I'm never going to have anything like that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I'm sorry. I don't -- I don't know why I said that or why I told you that.",
        "Hugh: Maybe because you had to tell somebody.",
        "Kelly: We barely know each other.",
        "Hugh: How long have you known?",
        "Kelly: About a half an hour.",
        "Hugh: No wonder why you're still reeling. Have you seen a doctor?",
        "Kelly: No.",
        "Hugh: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh -- attorneys ask a lot of questions.",
        "Kelly: I -- I haven't seen a doctor. I took a home pregnancy test.",
        "Hugh: Well, I -- if you want me to go, I can go. I won't tell anybody.",
        "Kelly: Thanks.",
        "Hugh: But I could stay.",
        "Kelly: Please, just -- please stay for just a little while, just a little while, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Hey, what'd you want to talk about?",
        "Starr: How do you feel about my mom and dad being together?",
        "Spencer: Oh, well, I'm not so sure that they are together, Starr.",
        "Starr: It's just a matter of time.",
        "Spencer: Think what you want. But did you hear what your father said to your mother? I'm sure that must be very painful for you, huh?",
        "Starr: He's mad at her for now. So am I. We get mad a lot, but then we get over it -- always.",
        "Spencer: Might be different this time.",
        "Starr: I doubt it, so I think that you should start to change your plans. You know, maybe find other kids to fake parent?",
        "Spencer: You know, it's really not helpful for a teenage girl to harbor all that resentment. It just isn't. I understand that this is a very difficult time for you, and --",
        "Starr: What was difficult for me was thinking that you could've pulled off getting my father executed for a murder that he didn't do. But this? No, it's not too difficult, because unlike you, I'm going to get exactly what I want.",
        "Spencer: Well, don't be too disappointed if it doesn't work out for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I understand your wanting to tell me off in public, Todd.",
        "Todd: That's so big of you.",
        "Blair: Oh, thank you. But I thought that you would be big enough to see through all of this and see that I am doing everything I can to make things right for all of us.",
        "Todd: Does that include Spencer? You like making things right for him?",
        "Blair: Why don't you think, Todd, just think.",
        "Todd: I think that there's no way to fix this. I think we should just let go.",
        "Blair: Really? Then why are you still standing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: There's a glass of champagne that's sitting right in front of you, about one or two hands' length.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you. Thank you for not handing it to me.",
        "Cristian: You're a very independent woman. Anyone can see that.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, anyone except me. And that's a joke. You can laugh.",
        "Cristian: Not to me. You know, I'm dead serious about finding out everything I can about getting your sight back.",
        "Evangeline: I know.",
        "Cristian: And until then, making sure your life changes as little as possible.",
        "Evangeline: Well, you've already changed my life, a lot.",
        "Cristian: I meant your job, your independence -- stuff like that. You'll live your life exactly like you did before. Well, except for the fact that you're like, you know, crazy, head over heels for me.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. I don't know about that, now that I'm dealing with both a jealous boxer and a jealous painter.",
        "Cristian: No, no, no, Manning. I mean, I know he didn't kill that woman, but -- I don't know, I just don't like him.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian? Give me your hand. Give it to me. We were getting so close tonight, you know, before Todd paged me. This isn't how this evening was meant to end.",
        "Cristian: Who says this is the end of the evening?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Start talking.",
        "David: Not here.",
        "John: You're playing games again?",
        "David: I'm not playing a game, John. You want to hear about your father's death, God knows I owe you that much, but I'm not going to tell the story in a room full of people who know both of us.",
        "John: Ok. My room, angel square hotel, one hour.",
        "David: Fine.",
        "Spencer: Where do you think you're going?",
        "David: Nowhere. I'm going home.",
        "Spencer: If you go anywhere with those people, you're a dead man. You hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You know what I want?",
        "Adriana: I think I know.",
