        "Kelly is at Duke's grave. She talks to him, telling him that the baby is his and not Kevin's. She has no idea how she is to feel. She would like to be happy but she can't be. She hears something behind her and turns to find Kevin walking up behind her. He asks her if she is there to tell Duke how much she loves him. He tells that he comes there everyday, and that he keeps hoping that one day he will come and Duke will not be there. Viki keeps telling him that Duke's death serves a purpose but he can't see what that purpose is. There is just nothing left now that Duke is gone, Kevin says. Kelly tells him that he is wrong. There is something left. David gives John and Michael the confession they asked for. David explains that his father had an operation set up and he did the collections. He took a gun with him to be like his dear old dad. He showed up and Thomas just appeared. David admits that he shot the man unintentionally and that he did say something about his sons that he had boys like him, and they were waiting for him at home. Rex and Adriana are about to make love. He can't. He would be doing this with a lie between them. He tells he made sure everyone heard that they were going to a certain inn, but in fact he had taken Adriana elsewhere. The trick worked. The stalker showed up and they chased him, but he hasn't been caught. Adriana has no problem with making love under these circumstances and so they do! After David confesses, John tells him to change his plea to 'guilty'. David will not do that. He will deny everything that he has just said, in fact. Michael wants to beat him up but John intervenes. John says that he will be at the courthouse at 1pm and expects to see David there. Afterwards, John can't help that feel like he doesn't have the whole story still. David heads home and packs his bags"

        "Rex: Adriana!",
        "Adriana: Rex.",
        "Rex: Oh. I thought -- I thought --",
        "Adriana: How about this time you put the deadbolt on?",
        "Rex: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I miss you so much, Duke. You said you'd give me everything I always wanted. I guess this is it. This is what I've always wanted -- to have a baby. But it's not Kevin's baby, is it? It's yours. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this. This is supposed to be the happiest day of my life, and I don't know how to feel. What's Kevin going to do when he finds out? What am I going to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Oh!",
        "Michael: Nora!",
        "Nora: Oh! Don't touch me. Please don't touch me. Don't touch me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You made it.",
        "David: Excuse me.",
        "John: Ok, Vickers, you didn't want to talk in public, it doesn't get much more private than this. Come on, you already admitted you shot him. I just want to know the story, beginning to end.",
        "David: You already know most of it.",
        "John: I want to hear it from you. I want to hear about my dad's last day on this earth from the man who took it from him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You sure?",
        "Adriana: I have thought about it so many times.",
        "Rex: Yeah, me, too -- like, a million times. I just -- I wanted to wait till the right moment.",
        "Adriana: I don't want to wait any longer, Rex. Make love to me.",
        "David: I'm aware that this is probably going to sound shallow, but it wasn't just your life d your family's lives that were affected that night. I've been running a long time, but not anymore. I'd like to say what happened that night out loud to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm not your priest, man. None of what you're doing gets you off the hook with the man upstairs or anybody else.",
        "Natalie: John --",
        "John: What?",
        "Natalie: You want to know what happened to your father, right? Don't scare him off.",
        "John: Maybe that's exactly what he needs.",
        "Natalie: No. You need him to tell you what happened, all of it. This is not just about peace for him.",
        "John: Ok, Vickers, let's see what you have to say. But there's someone else who should be here, someone else that needs to know what happened the night my father died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: How did you fall, anyway?",
        "Nora: I have to walk.",
        "Michael: Ok, but not on your own.",
        "Nora: I have to walk for Matthew.",
        "Michael: I know it's frustrating.",
        "Nora: It's impossible. I -- I missed too much.",
        "Michael: Split the difference -- you take it easy tonight, I promise I will step up your physical therapy in the morning. [Phone rings] I -- I'm sorry, I -- I have to take this call. I'll be right back. Yeah, Dr. Mc Bain here.",
        "John: Hey, Mike look, can you come over to my place right now?",
        "Michael: Uh -- yeah, sure. Is -- is everything ok?",
        "John: I just can't get into it over the phone, all right? Can you make it?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "John: Good. We'll wait. My brother lost his dad that night, too. He deserves to hear this as much as I do.",
        "Michael: Nora?",
        "Nora: Yeah?",
        "Michael: I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Nora: Ok. My leg?",
        "Michael: Oh. Sorry. Tomorrow. Ok?",
        "Paige: It's good to see you doing so well, Nora.",
        "Nora: You, too. I heard about the accident.",
        "Paige: I know it's been a long time since we've talked.",
        "Nora: Since before the aneurysm.",
        "Paige: I don't know how much of that you remember.",
        "Nora: I fought with Bo about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Come on, Tommy, please. Please, come on, you'll be ok. Oh -- Roxy, you scared me.",
        "Roxy: I'm sorry to bust right in here, but, you know, I practically had to beat down the door.",
        "Marcie: I know, I didn't hear you.",
        "Roxy: You know what? That kid's got a major set of pipes, and I think the building is painfully aware of it.",
        "Marcie: I know, I'm so sorry. You know, I thought maybe he might have a fever and that I'd have to take him to the hospital, and then I checked his wet diaper, but it's not wet, and -- and I fed him and I don't know what else -- I don't know what's going on, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: He's a baby, that's what's going on.",
        "Marcie: Yes, but he's been screaming like this for an hour. How do I get him to shut up? I'm sorry. Come on --",
        "Roxy: Hey, you got a vacuum cleaner?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, it's back in the bathroom. What -- what do you need that for?",
        "Roxy: Ok. No, just leave it to me, ok? All right, just, you know, stop worrying and just suck it up.",
        "Marcie: What? Tommy -- oh, Tommy, come on, please? Mommy will do anything you want.",
        "Roxy: Hey, hey, baby hey, hey, little baby",
        "Marcie: Little baby it seems to be working -- us singing.",
        "Roxy: Ok, well, wait a minute, this'll really --",
        "Marcie: Oh, no. Oh, no, he's doing it again!",
        "Roxy: Hey, I got the cure.",
        "Marcie: Roxy, what are you doing with that thing, anyway? Come on, please, Tommy.",
        "Roxy: Ta-da.",
        "Marcie: How -- how did you know to do that?",
        "Roxy: That ought to hold him for a couple hours.",
        "Marcie: Wow!",
        "Roxy: Yeah. See, when Natalie was a baby, she was a real screamer -- boy, not a lot has changed -- and it was like a trial-and-error thing, and I figured out through the process of illumination -- you know, I would do anything to keep her trap shut.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I'm not even going to ask what you had to do with Rex.",
        "Roxy: Ah, that wasn't too bad. I threw him up in the air a coup of times, he was good to go.",
        "Marcie: How many times did you drop him?",
        "Roxy: Oh, once or twice. Well, it didn't seem to do him any harm.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I guess not. I guess not. Thank you for helping me with Tommy. At least now I know that there's nothing wrong with my baby, right? There's nothing wrong with you.",
        "Roxy: Hey, Marcie --",
        "Marcie: You're just being cranky.",
        "Roxy: I got a news flash for you.",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Roxy: He's not your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: What's wrong?",
        "Rex: Ok, I'm going to shoot myself for this later, but I can't do this.",
        "Adriana: Rex, if you're worried about protection, don't. I thought of that.",
        "Rex: No, I did, too. I've -- I've been ready for this for a while. But --",
        "Adriana: What?",
        "Rex: As -- as much as I want to do this -- and I still do, I really do -- I would be a jerk if I made love to you right now.",
        "Adriana: Why?",
        "Rex: I lied to you, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Well, what did you lie about?",
        "Rex: Us being here -- it's part of a plan.",
        "Adriana: What plan?",
        "Rex: All right, you know how I told you that we were going to the bayberry inn?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, you told just about everybody who would listen.",
        "Rex: Including the stalker.",
        "Adriana: Wait a minute --",
        "Rex: I figured that he might've followed you to the country club, so I set him up into thinking we were going to the bayberry. And that's why when I knew he wasn't tailing the car, I doubled back into town and we came here.",
        "Adriana: So this whole thing was a plan to catch the stalker?",
        "Rex: My hunch turned out to be right. He showed up at the bayberry. I have a guy there waiting for him.",
        "Adriana: He caught him?",
        "Rex: No. The creep took off, but my guy went after him. I'm hoping we catch this sicko tonight.",
        "Adriana: Why didn't you just tell me all this before?",
        "Rex: I didn't want to freak you out. Look, I am sorry. I didn't want our first time to be because of some lie or because we were thrown together. I want it to be special. I hope you'll understand.",
        "Adriana: Like hell I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: What were you doing, Kelly? Hmm? Telling Duke how much you love him? Maybe how guilty you feel because he took the hit for you?",
        "Kelly: Well, obviously you've been drinking.",
        "Kevin: No, actually, I was in the church. I was trying to find some comfort.",
        "Kelly: Did you find any?",
        "Kevin: No. No, apparently my welcome has run out with the guy upstairs. I was here before. You know, I -- I can't seem to stop coming here. I mean, I come here every day. I -- I walk up to his gravesite to -- I -- I think maybe today, you know, he won't be there. Maybe I'll wake up from this nightmare, you know, and realize it was a dream and that -- that Duke is still alive.",
        "Kelly: I wish he were.",
        "Kevin: And I wish you hadn't slept with him.",
        "Kevin: My mom was here earlier. She kept trying to convince me that there was meaning in Duke's death. That because we loved him, he would live on. Yeah. All I could think about is that he's gone. There's -- there's nothing left of him.",
        "Kelly: That's not true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: I tried to tell you back then. I never intended to take your place with Matthew.",
        "Nora: Aneurysm?",
        "Paige: Yeah, well, it -- it can do that.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Paige: I'm sorry if I contributed to that.",
        "Nora: No. Upset then, not now, you know? Matthew told me you -- you helped him. You told him the truth.",
        "Paige: Well, not about everything.",
        "Nora: He said you and Bo broke up?",
        "Paige: Well, actually, we're -- um -- we're going to try to make another go of it. I -- I don't know how, it's -- it's a little complicated, but we both want it to work.",
        "Nora: Good, I'm glad.",
        "Paige: Well, I'm glad that you said that because I really need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Michael, come on in.",
        "Michael: What's he doing here?",
        "John: Vickers decided to come clean. I thought you'd want to hear his confession.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I would.",
        "John: Ok. We're all listening.",
        "David: The first thing you need to know is I wasn't acting alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Ok, I don't want to hear \"Duke will live on in our hearts\" crap, ok, especially from you.",
        "Kelly: But --",
        "Kevin: I don't need it, ok, because I feel him around me every day, all the time. I walk by his room and I can still see him there. His stuff is everywhere -- it's in the mansion, it's in the office, it's -- you know what I do? I call his voicemail just to hear him say \"leave a message.\" I can't cancel it. I -- I paid the bill the other day. I just can't come to grips with the idea of a future without him in it. There'll be no milestones for him. He'll never fall in love again. He's never going to -- never going to get married, never going to have children. There's no legacy. I will have no grandchildren to bounce on my knee. Just like me, there will be no one to carry on for him.",
        "Kelly: Kevin, there's something I should tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: It's just going to be hard when child services rips him out of your arms and gives him to somebody else. But, you know, Marcie, maybe it's not the worst thing in the world to happen, you know, because a baby can really put a cramp in your love life. You two are newlybeds, you know, and that should be the time when your love life is really smoking, you know?",
        "Marcie: Look, I think that Michael and I can handle being newlyweds and raising a baby.",
        "Roxy: So you're saying you're not going to give the baby back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, I thought you'd understand why I wasn't completely honest with you.",
        "Adriana: I do. And I love you for it. What I don't get is you not wanting to be with me because of some maniac. Rex, I don't care how we got here. All I care about is that we're here and we're together, and it doesn't get any more perfect than that. At least not for me.",
        "Rex: But I wanted to give you champagne and flowers and --",
        "Adriana: Just give me you, Rex. You know, people say it all the time, but it's true -- life is short. And I don't want to waste another day, another minute not having been together. I love you, Rex. I really do. And I just want to show you how much.",
        "Rex: Wow. I love you, too. I didn't think that I ever could -- I mean, love somebody again. But this, you, I -- I just don't want to screw it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: My help?",
        "Paige: See, Bo is doing everything he can to -- to fight the charges against him.",
        "Nora: Spencer behind this?",
        "Paige: Yes, that's right. Spencer set the whole thing up.",
        "Nora: Because of you?",
        "Paige: Oh, gosh, no. He has been over me for years -- I mean, if ever loved me, which I highly doubt. But he's really smart. It's going to be very hard to trip him up.",
        "Nora: Huh. If anyone can --",
        "Paige: Right.",
        "Nora: It's Bo, you know?",
        "Paige: If anyone can, Bo can.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Paige: But Bo is going to need a lot of support, and I may not be here to give it to him.",
        "Nora: Why?",
        "Paige: Well, I may be going to prison -- for my part in Thomas Mc Bain's death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I know it sounds like I'm trying to pass the buck here, but I'm not.",
        "John: Then what are you talking about?",
        "David: As good as your father apparently was, my father was the polar opposite. The two of you may have grown up trying to be just like your dad. Well, I did the very same thing. My exception is that Ned Truman was someone not to be emulated. When he died, Spencer and I inherited what I guess you would call the family business. Part of that business was making book. That night, I went on a collection run. I carried a gun because I wanted to be just like my old man. I took the money. I -- I was running out, and that's when your father arrived. He was in plain clothes, but he said he was with ACPD. I got scared. I hightailed it out of there and he followed.",
        "Michael: Then you killed him in cold blood.",
        "David: I didn't mean to.",
        "John: What happened next? Did he -- die he say anything before you fired?",
        "David: He said something about his sons.",
        "John: What'd he say, Vickers?",
        "David: Told me to freeze. I didn't. I ran, but then I stopped just -- just for a split second. I was trying to figure out which way to go, and that's when he called out to me again.",
        "Thomas: Freeze! Don't do this, kid. You've got your whole life ahead of you.",
        "David: And then he told me about you.",
        "Thomas: Look, it's Christmas. I got two boys waiting for me at home. Let's make this easy on both of us. Just drop the gun.",
        "David: That's it. That's what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: The situation with Tommy is only temporary. I am well aware of that.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, it doesn't mean you're ok with it.",
        "Marcie: I am ok with it. Totally. I mean it. Why are you looking at me like that? Uh -- look, I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be permanent.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, right. Who you trying to convince?",
        "Marcie: Look, even if I wanted to keep him, we can't keep him, anyway, so it doesn't matter.",
        "Roxy: Hey, look, I'm no one to judge, you know? It's just I know how attached you can get to those little boogers -- you know, it happened with Natalie, and she wasn't even mine. So I just want to tell you, when you have the kid and you need some advice, you can come to me. You can have your own Mr. Spock.",
        "Marcie: I'll remember that when I beam him up to sickbay. Forget it, it doesn't matter. Forget it, goodbye.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, I'm going to miss this cute little thing hanging around here. See ya.",
        "Marcie: Bye. Yeah. Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: People keep secrets for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes it's because they care too much.",
        "Nora: Yes, I know.",
        "Paige: So then you'll forgive Bo?",
        "Nora: You love him, don't you?",
        "Paige: Yes, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: That was definitely worth the wait.",
        "Rex: You think?",
        "Rex: Look, what you said before -- if something ever happened to one of us -- it's not going to. I am never going to let anything happen to you, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: What about you? Who's going to keep you safe?",
        "Rex: Shh. I can take care of myself. I've got too much to live for. Much as I hate to do this, it might be about the stalker.",
        "Adriana: Go ahead.",
        "Rex: Hello? Yeah. No. Ok. Yeah, I understand.",
        "Adriana: Got away?",
        "Rex: The trail went cold.",
        "Adriana: Did your guy get a look at him at the bayberry inn?",
        "Rex: No. It was too dark. The guy had his head down. My guy couldn't make out his face. Damn, I -- this whole plan was a bust.",
        "Adriana: Not totally.",
        "Rex: I just -- I wanted to get this guy tonight. I want you to feel safe again.",
        "Adriana: I felt safe when we were making love.",
        "Rex: How would you like to feel safe again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I've heard it all before, Kelly, ok? You're sorry, you wish you could go back in time, you love me and only me, you and Duke made a mistake. It's just --",
        "Kelly: No, you should listen to me --",
        "Kevin: Why? Why should I listen to you?",
        "Kelly: What your mom said about --",
        "Kevin: My mom's got no idea, all right? Yeah, she loves Megan, I know, but she -- she didn't send her to her death, ok? Her daughter didn't screw around with her husband the way my n did with you. I'm going to have to deal with this -- with Duke's death and the way this happened -- for the rest of my life.",
        "Kelly: So will I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Bo and I aren't really broadcasting the fact that we might get back together.",
        "Nora: Because of Spencer?",
        "Paige: Yeah, Spencer, and also it -- it could be confusing to Matthew, you know, especially if I have to go to prison.",
        "Nora: Thank you for thinking of my son.",
        "Paige: He's amazing.",
        "Nora: He's the best.",
        "Paige: Listen, I -- I hope that you keep trying to walk. You know, determination is -- is a huge part of the battle.",
        "Nora: Back at you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What'd you do with the gun?",
        "David: It felt hot like it was burning. I got rid of it as fast as I could.",
        "John: Where?",
        "David: I don't remember.",
        "Michael: What do you mean, you don't remember?",
        "David: Everything that happened after I opened my eyes and saw what I did is a blur. I ran. I've been running ever since. That's what happened, now you know.",
        "Natalie: Where you going?",
        "David: I did what I came here to do.",
        "John: What you should do is change your plea to guilty.",
        "David: That was not part of the deal.",
        "John: There's no deal! You want to clear your conscience? Stop running, be a man, and see this through to the end.",
        "David: I'm not going back to prison.",
        "Michael: That's just too damn bad, isn't it?",
        "David: Anybody asks, this conversation never happened.",
        "Natalie: We all heard you.",
        "David: I'll say it was coerced.",
        "Michael: You want coercion? I'll show you coercion.",
        "John: Mike, I'll handle this. Because you can do this, you have to.",
        "David: So they'll go easier on me, maybe give me life instead of a needle?",
        "John: You'll go easier on yourself. I'll be at the courthouse tomorrow at 1:00 with a judge and the D.A. I think you should be there, too.",
        "David: I'm not making any promises.",
        "Natalie: Do you think he'll go?",
        "John: If he wants to save what's left of his soul, he will. If not, he can go to hell. Hey --",
        "Michael: Hey.",
