        "David: We push and we pull at the same time. Don't look at me -- do it on your own. That's why we call this the gazing-at-the-moon pose. And relax.",
        "Viki: Whoo.",
        "David: How do you feel?",
        "Viki: David, I feel wonderful. Do you know I've seen people do this in the park? I had no idea what it was all about.",
        "David: Well, now you know. Tai chi gives us a sense of peace and harmony and focus.",
        "Viki: Ah.",
        "David: Now, we're going to do \"the beautiful woman turns at the waist\" pose.",
        "Viki: David --",
        "David: Don't give me that -- it's not the lambada. Save that for the cruise ship. Now -- I want you to focus on your hips. And turn from your hips, look to your left. Hips only, look to your right. That's it. Oh, that's good.",
        "Jessica: Mom?",
        "David: Left -- oh, yes.",
        "Jessica: Well, what are you doing?",
        "David: Quiet, please. I'm trying to qi gong your mother. Left.",

        "Nash: Yeah? Well, thank you so much for watching Bree today.",
        "Viki: Oh, of course. Honey, are you sure you're up to this?",
        "Jessica: I can handle it.",
        "David: You look tense, Jessica. I should probably qi gong you, too.",
        "Nash: Uh-huh.",
        "Jessica: Um -- well, we're on our way to the courthouse. Antonio and I are getting a divorce today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Antonio, what -- hi.",
        "Antonio: Hey, Talia. What are you doing here?",
        "Talia: Drug bust. What are you doing here? You're not trying to come back to work yet, are you?",
        "Antonio: It's not that.",
        "Talia: Oh -- it's personal.",
        "Antonio: Well, if everything goes according to plan, I should be single within an hour.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: You want me to go back to Llanview with you two and be treated like some chick in the witness protection program? Hmm -- yeah, that's going to happen.",
        "Cristian: Actually, it is.",
        "Sarah: Um -- how do I say this in a way both of you will understand? Go away.",
        "Rex: Wow. You are more worried about your boyfriend than I thought.",

        "Blair: Who are you?",
        "Hunter: Doesn't matter who I am. I'm here because I know where you can find Todd Manning.",
        "Blair: You're Sarah's boyfriend, aren't you? You're -- you're Hunter.",
        "Hunter: Look, I came here because I've got what you're looking for. Well, do you want it or not?",
        "Blair: Oh, just like that? No strings?",
        "Hunter: Just like that \u0096 there is a price.",
        "Blair: Huh. Let me get this straight -- you come all the way from Chicago to ask me for money, then send me back to Chicago to find Todd?",
        "Hunter: Who said Manning's still in Chicago?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: We've been over this before. I can handle Miles.",
        "John: Yeah? What about your son?",
        "Marty: What about him?",
        "John: Take care of him.",
        "Marty: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "John: You willing to sacrifice him to Laurence?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Mr. Manning? Mr. Manning! Come on, wake up!",
        "Miles: I wouldn't get too close, Cole.",
        "Cole: You did this?",
        "Miles: You should've never come down here, Cole -- never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Oh! That hospital is exhausting. I guess that's why all the coma patients are sleeping so soundly, huh?",
        "Vincent: Hey, I'm glad you said that and not me.",
        "Layla: Yeah, I would've slapped you.",
        "Vincent: Well, exactly.",
        "Layla: These things are torture devices. Oh.",
        "Vincent: Well, why don't you wear sandals or flats, you know? It's not like Evangeline cares what's on your feet.",
        "Layla: They're not for her. If I get dressed up when I go see her, it's like I haven't given up hope. I'm still making an effort, you know? I mean, I don't take it for granted that she won't see me.",
        "Vincent: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "Vincent: Hey. Why don't you let Dr. Jones take care of those tired feet for you?",
        "Layla: Ok.",
        "Vincent: All right?",
        "Layla: Oh, my God.",

        "Layla: Oh. Oh.",
        "Vincent: Is it good?",
        "Layla: Heaven. Why didn't you tell me you could do this?",
        "Vincent: Every man needs a little mystery.",
        "Layla: You have more than your fair share.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Are you saying Todd's in Llanview?",
        "Hunter: I'm saying that I need to be paid for this key piece of information.",
        "Blair: Oh. What, you sneak onto this property, get behind the bushes, and jump out and say, \"Hey, Todd's here!\" What am I supposed to do -- open my checkbook up to you?",
        "Hunter: Do you want proof?",
        "Blair: You got any?",
        "Hunter: Check it out.",
        "Blair: Oh, that's Todd.",
        "Hunter: Yeah, that is Todd. And in case you're wondering, yes, he's alive, because I've been taking care of him, but if you don't fork over some cash soon, I can't vouch for the people that have him.",
        "Blair: Who has him? Tell me who has him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What is that? You're drugging him?",
        "Miles: Look, Cole, you don't understand.",
        "Cole: Yeah, hell, right I don't! What, are you trying to kill him?",
        "Miles: No! I -- you shouldn't even be down here!",
        "Cole: Neither should Mr. Manning! Has he been here this whole time?",
        "Miles: No.",
        "Cole: Then -- then when'd he get here? Where's he been?",
        "Miles: Look, Cole, you got to listen to me.",
        "Cole: No! No, I'm not going to listen to you, you freak!",
        "Miles: Hey, just -- where do you think you're going?",
        "Cole: I'm going to the cops! All right, John McBain will have your ass in jail so fast!",
        "Miles: I can't let you do that, Cole.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and what are you going to do, huh? Shoot me up with that stuff, too?",
        "Miles: I will do whatever I have to, whatever it takes, to keep this between us. Do you understand?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Have you heard something? Has Miles threatened Cole?",
        "John: If he had, I would've dealt with it already.",
        "Marty: Then why are you sitting here saying these things to me? What, because you don't like Miles?",
        "John: What are you doing, hmm? What are you thinking about, bringing this guy into your home?",
        "Marty: I did it for Cole.",
        "John: No. He hates Laurence, he's pissed at you for marrying him, and it's setting Laurence off.",
        "Marty: Cole and I have talked. And he is trying to handle it, deal with it.",
        "John: Let me tell you something, he's not handling it and he's not dealing with it. He's a kid. And Laurence -- I'm not sure what the hell he is, but I know he's unstable. Look, if he could do what he did to get you to marry him, what do you think he's capable of if he thinks Cole is getting in his way?",
        "Marty: I know Miles and I know how to handle him.",
        "John: Maybe in the office, all right, but not here! Look at me -- you didn't kill Truman. I know it and you know it. What I don't get is, why are you lying here and taking it? Why aren't you fighting back?",
        "Marty: Who do you think you are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Darling, I really wish you would let me go with you to the courthouse.",
        "Jessica: I can handle it, Mom.",
        "Viki: But I want to go. It's upsetting you.",
        "Jessica: I know, but Nash will be there with me.",
        "Viki: Are you sure that that's a good idea?",
        "Nash: I know what you're thinking.",
        "Viki: Well, it's going to make a terrible situation much worse.",
        "Jessica: Especially for Antonio, and we've thought about that.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm thinking about you, too, you know? You've been through a lot.",
        "Nash: I will be there, but I promise you I will lay low.",
        "Viki: All right.",
        "David: Mmm, mmm.",
        "Nash: Is that Bree's baby food?",
        "David: I guess that means Lois is giving Bree my foie gras.",
        "Jessica: Uh-oh, ok. I better go check on her.",
        "Nash: I'm on it.",
        "David: I probably should, too. I charged the fancy stuff with the truffles to your account. Keep that unappreciating baby away from my food.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Viki: Baby? Do you really think you're ready for this? This is happening so fast.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm. Well, it was Antonio's idea. And he's right, you know? We should just get this over with. It should be easy, you know? We have no financial assets to split, no custody issues. It's just a formality.",
        "Viki: No, it's not.",
        "Jessica: I know it's not.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I'm so sorry you have to go through this. But when it's over, you'll -- I hate the word \"closure,\" but it -- it exists for a reason.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. It's just a ruling, just a piece of paper.",
        "Talia: Yeah. No big deal.",
        "Antonio: I loved her so much.",
        "Talia: You still do.",
        "Antonio: I can't.",
        "Talia: You won't as much, in time. But you've got to walk through this one particular hell. I just hope it's not too soon after your surgery.",
        "Antonio: You know, if I could've done this the day she told me she was in love with Nash, I would have.",
        "Talia: So the court just decided? Uh, I'm -- why didn't you tell me last night?",
        "Antonio: Oh, well, because I -- I didn't want to talk about divorce while watching fireworks and get into the whole symbolism of independence day and all that crap.",
        "Talia: Well, you can talk to me. You can talk to me any time, even on holidays.",
        "Antonio: Last night it was -- it was just easy, happy. And, well, I -- I had a great time.",
        "Talia: So did I.",
        "Antonio: And running into you here, it -- it helped. You've been a good friend, Talia. Thank you.",
        "[Antonio groans]",
        "Antonio: All right, take it easy there, killer.",
        "Talia: If I take it any easier, princess, I'll have to cut it off of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: How come I'm the only one of your friends who doesn't own a single piece of exposed merchandise?",
        "Layla: Well, you can just go to the store and buy some just like everybody else.",
        "Vincent: Oh-ho-ho-ho! I'm hurt.",
        "Layla: Well, if you want some so badly -- oh, shoot.",
        "Vincent: What? What happened?",
        "Layla: I have to put in a fabric order before 5:00 or else the manufacturers won't get it, and if they don't have it, then the retailers won't and the distributors -- it's like a house of cards.",
        "Vincent: Ok, or a domino effect, I get it, so what can I do to help you?",
        "Layla: You know fabric?",
        "Vincent: I got good taste. Would that help?",
        "Layla: That depends. Are you willing to take your pants off?",
        "Vincent: Hell, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Huh. I am not going within smoke signals' distance of Llanview.",
        "Rex: What if Hunter comes back?",
        "Sarah: I'm not scared of him.",
        "Cristian: You should be.",
        "Sarah: Well, even if I was, Llanview would be the last place on earth I would think to hide.",
        "Rex: Ok, what about somewhere else?",
        "Sarah: Like?",
        "[Cristian chuckles]",
        "Rex: Your mom?",
        "Sarah: She's off doing one of her \"things,\" God knows where.",
        "Cristian: What about your dad?",
        "Sarah: Why do you think I left London?",
        "Rex: Ok, we can't stay here open-ended.",
        "Sarah: Then leave.",
        "Cristian: We're not about to do that, Sarah. We've waited this long for answers, we're not leaving now.",
        "Rex: Look, we're not asking you to come back to Llanview on a permanent basis.",
        "Sarah: Oh -- just long enough to mess up my life?",
        "Cristian: Like it's not already.",
        "Sarah: Ugh. I didn't ask for any of this, ok? So if you guys want to stick around to see if Hunter shows up, go for it, but I am not going back to Llanview.",
        "Rex: I know how we can settle this.",
        "Cristian: Stun gun?",
        "Rex: Ah -- ha-ha. We call your dad and tell him everything.",
        "Sarah: You wouldn't.",
        "[Rex whistles]",
        "Sarah: Huh. Like I'm supposed to believe my Dad is one of your five faves?",
        "Rex: No, but my sister is. She works for B.E. now. She can get me your dad's phone number in about four seconds.",
        "[Sarah snickers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Look, I'm a businessman, so you show me the money and I'll show you where you can find Todd.",
        "Blair: Is Todd here in Llanview?",
        "Hunter: Yeah, but without the address, he might as well be in Moscow, right?",
        "Blair: All right. I'll go get my checkbook.",
        "Hunter: Uh -- sorry, babe. I only take cash.",
        "Blair: Oh, what are you talking about? How much cash do you think I have lying around here?",
        "Hunter: Well, from the looks of things, plenty. I'll take whatever you have as long as it's 10 grand.",
        "Blair: Fine. Just wait here.",
        "Hunter: I'll just soak up some rays, and a drink would be nice.",
        "Blair: Go to hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You realize this -- this guy, this lunatic, is sleeping next to you every",
        "Marty: Trust me, I will never let him touch me.",
        "John: Oh, that's -- that's great. So what's the plan -- you got one?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "John: I'd love to hear it.",
        "Marty: I'm buying time.",
        "John: Buying time.",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: Till when?",
        "Marty: Until you get some answers about Spencer's murder, ok? In the meantime, don't make me crazy about the safety of my son. That's why I married Miles -- to protect Cole.",
        "John: He used Cole to get to you -- what makes you think he's going to stop there? If he doesn't get what he wants, what makes you think he won't do something worse?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Marty: Starr.",
        "Starr: Hi, Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "Marty: Hi, come in.",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "John: Hey, Starr.",
        "Starr: Is Cole here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I mean, come on -- did you really think you could pull this off? Half the town is looking for Mr. Manning, including my girlfriend. What the hell is the matter with you?",
        "Miles: Look, I -- I didn't expect it to get this far. I don't want that, but it did. We're stuck with it.",
        "Cole: No, no, we're not! This could be good for you -- think about it. I mean, if he wasn't -- if he wasn't out of commission, you wouldn't even be with Starr right now.",
        "Cole: I can't believe -- I can't believe you're saying that.",
        "Miles: But it's true.",
        "Cole: So you're doing this for me? That's what you want me to think?",
        "Miles: No, this is going to help a lot of people. You've got to trust me on this.",
        "Cole: This is sick.",
        "Miles: You say you love Starr. If you love her as much as I love your mother, you will forget that Todd was even here.",
        "Cole: Yeah -- yeah, I love Starr, enough to tell her the truth and give her father back. Now, get the hell out of my way, you sick son of a bitch!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Well, so much for getting here early.",
        "Talia: That anxious?",
        "Antonio: Do I look it?",
        "Talia: You look unbelievably together for someone who just got out of the hospital and who is only starting to feel like his old self again.",
        "Antonio: Well, I don't know if I'll ever feel that.",
        "Talia: Yeah, it takes time.",
        "Antonio: If ever. I do know this -- the signs were there, it was right in front of me and I just didn't want to see it.",
        "Talia: Well, you know the old saying -- \"love is blind.\"",
        "Antonio: \"Blind\" -- yeah, I know. I know.",
        "Talia: Antonio, your wife left you for another guy and you flew back from halfway around the world to save her life, and now you're giving her a quickie divorce. I'm sorry, but what more could you do?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, that's what I keep thinking.",
        "Talia: Well, if it were me, I -- God, I probably would've egged Jessica's house, let the air out of her tires, you know?",
        "Antonio: And then, I would have to cite you.",
        "Talia: You wouldn't, so -- no.",
        "Antonio: Thank you, again.",
        "Talia: For what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Mmm. Now, this -- much better.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Bree thinks so, too.",
        "David: So tell me, Nash, you and Jessica -- you're really setting up shop in that vineyard?",
        "Nash: Yeah, it's home.",
        "David: Too rustic. Now, this -- this, my friend, is a home -- everything you want at the snap of your fingers.",
        "Nash: Yeah, and those -- those tai chi lessons, they're paying your room and board, huh?",
        "David: No, no. That's a freebie. Viki just likes the pleasure of my company, and to tell you the truth, she doesn't seem to be able to get enough of me.",
        "Viki: Honey, this is so much stress right after the surgery.",
        "Jessica: I can handle it, Mom, really.",
        "Viki: Are you taking all your medicines and doing everything the doctors asked you to?",
        "Jessica: If I weren't, Nash would hit the roof.",
        "Viki: He really loves you, doesn't he?",
        "Jessica: About as much as I love him.",
        "Viki: You loved Antonio.",
        "Jessica: Mom, I know you think I'm making a mistake.",
        "Viki: Darling, I don't want you to be hurt again, that's all.",
        "Jessica: I'm not the one that's hurt, ok? I hurt Antonio, I broke his heart. I just -- I hope to God I don't do the same thing to Nash.",
        "Viki: Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Jessica: No. No, no, no. I -- it's just something Antonio said that -- it just won't go away. What if I'm not the woman that I -- I think I am, you know? What if Nash is in love with somebody that just doesn't exist?",
        "Viki: Oh, honey.",
        "Nash: Sorry to interrupt. We really better get going.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I --",
        "Nash: We're going to miss the hearing.",
        "Jessica: Lost track of time. Um -- ok. Thank you for taking care of Bree, and, um, I will call you the second the hearing is over and tell you how it went. And you behave yourself.",
        "David: What would be the fun if I did that? You all right?",
        "Viki: I just hope that my daughter is.",

        "Rex: Huh. I liked that phone.",
        "Sarah: Me going back to Llanview was not part of the agreement.",
        "Cristian: Who said anything about an agreement?",
        "Sarah: Look, you guys can't make me go back, and neither can my parents.",
        "Rex: Did you say \"stun gun\"?",
        "Sarah: Oh, will you guys just leave me the hell alone! Look, I did my part -- I told you about my uncle Todd.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, a little late.",
        "Sarah: Well, how was I supposed to know Hunter was going to move him first?",
        "Rex: But you can help us find Hunter.",
        "Sarah: I'll let you know if he calls, ok? Assuming he doesn't kill me first.",
        "Rex: You know what? Forget it. You're not staying here, we can't stay here, so you're going back to Llanview today.",
        "Sarah: Like Llanview will be any safer.",
        "Cristian: Look, you could stay at your aunt Viki's or at the Buchanan mansion. That's a nice place.",
        "Sarah: I am not staying at either.",

        "Blair: That's all I had in the house.",
        "Hunter: I'll take it.",
        "Blair: Now where's Todd?",
        "Hunter: Right under your nose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Have you and your mom heard anything about your dad?",
        "Starr: Um -- no, nothing.",
        "John: Well, look, Starr, let me know if there's anything we can do.",
        "Starr: Thanks.",
        "Marty: Well, actually, Cole is just down in the storage area getting a summer box of clothes. You know, actually he should be back by now. I wonder what's taking him so long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Get out of my way! What are you going to do, kill me, huh? Yeah, that will really seal the deal with my mom, won't it?",
        "Miles: I'm not going to kill you. God! Don't you see I'm trying to help you and your mother?",
        "Spencer: Oh, no. Don't you go soft on me, Miles. Make the kid do it, Miles. Maybe you can't kill Todd, but he certainly can. Think about what Todd did to the woman you love, think about who this boy is and how he can help you. Think it through, Miles.",
        "Cole: What's going on with you?",
        "Miles: You can fix this.",
        "Cole: Just let me out of here.",
        "Miles: No. There is something that you need to do. This man tried to kill you, he raped your mother, he kept you away from the girl that you love. You can solve all your problems, Cole. Just kill Todd.",
        "Cole: You want me to kill Mr. Manning? Are you crazy?",
        "Spencer: Tell the boy that it's the best way for him to get back at Todd for what Todd did to his mother. Go ahead, Miles. Tell him.",
        "Miles: This is the best solution, Cole. You can be with Starr. And more importantly, you can get revenge against Todd for raping your mother.",
        "Cole: I'm not going to do that.",
        "Miles: Why not? He ruined your mother's life. Look, he went to prison, but he deserves more. There's enough dope in here to take down an elephant. Do it, Cole. Avenge your mother. Your father would want you to.",
        "Cole: You know what? Stick it in your own arm and do all of us a favor.",
        "Miles: That's not going to happen. And I'm sorry to see that you're not a man of your word.",
        "Cole: My word?",
        "Miles: You say you love Starr and your mother. Letting Todd live when you can end the suffering is proof that you don't love them at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm going to go see what's taking Cole so long.",
        "Marty: Um -- you know what? Why don't we just give him another second? You and I can have some girl talk.",
        "Starr: I don't want to interrupt you and Lieutenant McBain.",
        "Marty: Oh, no, no, it's ok.",
        "John: I think that was the point.",
        "Starr: You know what? Actually -- um -- I wanted to tell you something. I know that things between you and my mom are still a mess. But thank you for letting me and Cole be together.",
        "Marty: You're welcome, sweetie. You know, the history between me and your parents should never have anything to do with you and Cole.",
        "John: Hey, look, I'm going to get going, but there's one thing I wanted to run by you before I do.",
        "Marty: Um -- ok, you know what? Why don't you go grab a soda?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Marty: The kitchen's -- it's right through there.",
        "Starr: Ok. Bye, Lieutenant.",
        "John: Bye, Starr. Look, I know you think you don't have any choices in this, but you do. You don't have to spend another night with this guy.",
        "Marty: What else am I supposed to do?",
        "John: Throw him out. I'll make sure you never see him again. Think about it. Ok?",
        "Starr: Ok. I got one for you, too.",
        "Marty: Thanks.",
        "[Starr giggles]",
        "Marty: What's so funny?",
        "Starr: I was just thinking what my mom would say if she saw the two of us having a soda together.",

        "Blair: What do you mean, Todd's right un--",
        "Hunter: It's been a pleasure doing business with you, babe.",

        "Nash: You know what? I think I'll be right there.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Maybe you shouldn't have come.",
        "Nash: I wasn't going to let you do this alone. And that's why I'm going to be right there. Good luck.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Nash: How's Antonio?",
        "Talia: How do you think?",
        "Lawyer: This should be pretty simple. Neither one of you is contesting it. It's what you both want.",
        "Second lawyer: It'll be clean and simple. Over real fast.",
        "Judge: Good afternoon, everyone.",
        "Lawyer: Good afternoon, your honor.",
        "Second lawyer: Hello, your honor.",
        "Judge: Um -- well, there's nothing here to prevent this divorce. It's a no- fault request. Due to the brevity of your marriage, I have to ask -- especially since you have two children.",
        "Jessica: Yes, your honor?",
        "Judge: What is the reason for this divorce? You've been married about six months. Huh. What could possibly have gone so wrong since your wedding day?",
        "Antonio: Your honor, we -- our feelings just changed for each other. It's -- it's not any more complicated than that.",
        "Jessica: The truth is, your honor -- oh -- I fell in love with another man. And everything that went wrong was because of me.",

        "Vincent: Hey. You did tell me to drop my pants, right?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm. You didn't have to take off your shirt -- not that I'm complaining.",
        "Vincent: Uh-huh. I could put it back on.",
        "Layla: No. No, no, no, no. It's ok. I mean, if you're comfortable.",
        "Vincent: Oh, I'm comfortable. I also took the liberty of turning down the A.C.",
        "Layla: Just don't sweat on the silks. I have to send these samples back.",
        "Vincent: Ok.",
        "Layla: All right. So, here -- take this. Write down everything I tell you to.",
        "Vincent: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Layla: Ah. You're much more polite than our normal fit model.",
        "Vincent: And much more manlier, too.",
        "Layla: Uh -- one thing you have in common -- no shortage of ego.",
        "[Vincent chuckles]",
        "Vincent: Ok, so what am I modeling here? Is this like a miniskirt or something?",
        "Layla: No, it's part of our men's' line. I just have to see how the fabric hangs and how it will look against your skin.",
        "Vincent: Well, it's a little scratchy.",
        "Layla: Beauty is pain, baby.",
        "Vincent: Oh, beauty is pain?",

        "Rex: No -- uh-uh!",
        "Cristian: Sorry, not happening.",
        "Sarah: Well, those are my terms. What's the problem anyway? You guys both got dumped, you live alone. I can hide out at your places from my family, and nobody would even know. What? You won't even notice I'm there.",
        "Rex: Well -- what -- I would. You are a slob.",
        "Cristian: Right. And I didn't get dumped, he did.",
        "Sarah: Look, you guys said you wanted to keep me on a short leash. It doesn't get any shorter than me being your roomie, huh? Deal or not? I love it when I get my way. The question is, which one of you two lucky guys gets me first? Huh?",

        "Cole: I'm not going to kill Mr. Manning. You can't make me a killer like you.",

        "Miles: I know this isn't your nature, Cole. I'm not a killer, either.",
        "Cole: But you want me to be one!",
        "Miles: Look, I -- I didn't want it to be this way. You weren't supposed to come down here. You weren't supposed to find Todd. But now that you have, I have no choice but to protect my interests.",
        "Cole: If you kill me, they'll find out, and my mom will hate you forever.",
        "Miles: I am not going to kill you.",
        "Cole: Then you can't stop me from going to the cops.",
        "Miles: Actually, I can. If you go to the police, your mother will go to prison.",

        "David: I have very few legally marketable skills, but I can actually boil water. Your granddaughter's in the kitchen throwing around the rest of my foie gras with Lois.",
        "Viki: How politically correct of her.",
        "David: Yeah, runs in the family. I'm sorry, is it something I said?",
        "Viki: No, David, no. I'm worried about Jessica. I mean, she's -- the divorce, and -- and the transplant, and the hearing, and the baby, and it's so much stress. I mean, she just had this transplant.",
        "David: I often wondered what it would be like to be a father. I know you're thinking I'd probably be very good at it, but deep down, I'm actually pretty selfish. You have to be a very giving person to be a parent. From everything I've seen, you're the greatest.",
        "David: Yikes. It's the cops.",
        "John: Hello, Mrs. Davidson.",

        "John: Yeah. Reluctantly, I need to speak to Vickers here.",
        "Viki: Ok. Well, why don't I go help Lois clean up the foie gras? David, thank you.",
        "David: You miss me?",
        "John: Terribly.",
        "David: Hmm. Well, this can't be good. Unless, of course, you're here to tell me that you have a lead on who actually killed my brother.",

        "Talia: This is none of my business, but I am Antonio's friend, and if you mean what you just said -- and I think you do -- keep your distance from him.",
        "Nash: Yeah, well -- when Jessica and Antonio come out of there, they'll be divorced, won't they? That'll be the end of all that.",
        "Talia: It better be.",

        "Judge: Marriage is a legally binding commitment. While the system obviously has the means to dissolve a marriage when it doesn't work, I feel compelled to say that marriage is not something to be entered into lightly.",
        "Jessica: We didn't, your honor. I made a mistake, and I'm sorry -- mostly because I hurt Antonio. Because he's a very, very good and wonderful man, and he deserves better. He deserves better than me.",
