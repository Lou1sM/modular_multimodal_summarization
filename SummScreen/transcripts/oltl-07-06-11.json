        "Clint: It's good to know.",

        "Rex: What?",
        "Patient rep: For where the hospital should send the remains.",
        "Rex: Just give me the damn dress. Where's Shane? Where's my son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I've sent the children home. Joey and Jessie and Natalie were here all night. Oh, God, Clint, they were so happy.",
        "Shane: Just tell me why.",
        "Viki: Shane, are you all right?",
        "Shane: Why do you get to live when my mom had to die?",

        "Shane: Answer me. Why should you get my mom's heart?",
        "Viki: Shane, Shane, you shouldn't be here.",
        "Shane: We weren't good enough for you when my mom was still alive. You did everything you could to make sure that we wouldn't be in your family, and now, what, you think you can just use us for spare parts?",
        "Viki: Honey, you're upset. This is not the time for this. Please.",

        "Nora: I remember. I remember.",
        "Bo: So we just have to be careful and not try to push him too hard. He'll talk to us again in his own time.",
        "Nora: I don't think it was his trying to talk that tired him out. I think it was what he was trying to say.",
        "Bo: How the accident happened.",
        "Nora: Yeah. You said before the seizure that he said the name Eddie, but that doesn't make any sense. Eddie was dead long before Matthew hit his head.",
        "Bo: Yeah. I know, but we just have to give him time to recover on his own, because the doctor told us we have every reason to believe that he will talk again.",

        "Nate: I don't know, but it's only a matter of time. So tell his parents. Don't tell his parents. I'm screwed either way. So leave me and Deanna alone. Got that?",

        "James: Not really.",
        "Deanna: But?",
        "James: He's from Paris, you know? He's totally impressed with himself. He's appeared in night clubs. He's traveled all over the world, and blah, blah, blah. Well, now he's here in Llanview, and he wants to record music with Starr.",
        "Deanna: And you think it's a come-on?",
        "James: Uh, yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. Starr is an incredible singer, but he's never heard her. It's totally obvious.",
        "Deanna: But wait. Aren't they cousins?",
        "James: Not by blood, unfortunately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: This is a little girl. Her name is Hope, and she's my daughter.",

        "Baz: So how do you deal with all that, you know, with school and stuff?",
        "Starr: My family helps out a lot. I've really lucked out. A lot of people in my situation aren't as fortunate.",

        "Dani: You and Matthew didn't--",
        "Destiny: Didn't use any.",
        "Dani: Oh, my God. So then-- have you actually taken the test? Des, are you pregnant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: If we want him back as good as new, we're gonna have to be patient.",
        "[Nora scoffs]",
        "Bo: No. Patient. You can be patient, can't you, Red?",
        "Nora: Patience is not my virtue...",

        "Bo: All right. Be right back, bud.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: No. I haven't actually taken the test yet, but there's no way I could be pregnant.",
        "Dani: Des, if there's no way, why did you buy it? Are you late?",
        "Bo: Hey, Destiny, Danielle, what's going on?",
        "Destiny: Oh, nothing. How's Matthew doing?",
        "Bo: He's hanging in. You know, I want you girls to know how much we appreciate you taking time to visit.",
        "Dani: Oh, you don't have to thank us.",
        "Destiny: Yeah. We want to be here. Matthew is our friend.",
        "Bo: Well, with any luck, your friend will be back real soon.",
        "Dani: It's gonna be some day for Matthew when you tell him he's your baby daddy.",
        "Destiny: Stop it. I'm probably not even pregnant.",
        "Dani: Probably? I thought you were sure.",
        "Destiny: I'm just a little late. So what? I only bought the test because Starr freaked me out. Now I'm sorry I wasted the money. I'll probably just throw it away.",
        "Dani: Oh! Oh, my God, I'm supposed to meet Nate in, like, 5 minutes. He just started working for the park maintenance crew. I was supposed to bring him his lunch.",
        "Destiny: So you should go.",
        "Dani: No. No. It's ok. I can stay here with you while you take the test.",
        "Destiny: And what's Nate gonna do, eat bark?",
        "Dani: I can call him.",
        "Destiny: It's really ok. You should just go. I'm not gonna do the test, anyway.",
        "Dani: Are you sure?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. I told you, I already know I'm not pregnant.",
        "Dani: Ok, but you call me if you change your mind. Des, I hope you do. It's better to know one way or another, ok?",
        "Destiny: Don't worry, ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Doctor said a book would be good, stimulate your brain. I used to do this all the time when you were a kid, read to you. So let's start, shall we? \"Tale of Two Cities\"? \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\" been there, huh? \"It was the spring of hope...\"",
        "Matthew's voice: Ugh! Aah!",
        "Nate's voice: You killed my father, you son of a bitch!",
        "Nora: \"It was the winter of despair...\"",
        "[Matthew speaks indistinctly]",
        "Nora: Matthew? Matthew, are you trying to say something?",
        "[Matthew speaks indistinctly]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Yeah. Wow, that's good news for Matthew Buchanan. Sucks for me, though, and you end up in Statesville, and you'd have missed your chance to star in \"Hold the Diploma.\"",
        "Nate: I think I can live with that.",
        "Rick: Yeah. You say that now. Once the franchise takes off-- so, hey, call me if you change your mind.",
        "Nate: I won't, so get lost.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nate: Don't come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Deanna: So...sounds like you're jealous.",
        "James: Not jealous. \"Suspicious\" might be a better word, but I'm definitely not jealous.",
        "[Cell phone chirps]",
        "James: Something important?",
        "Deanna: Um, it's your mom. She needs me to run an errand. Shouldn't take long.",
        "James: Yeah. Well, it shouldn't take long for me to see how Starr is getting along with God's gift to music, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: If you refer to my daughter as \"it\" one more time, I will remove your tongue.",
        "Baz: Got it.",
        "Starr: And she's been clingy lately, so I wanted to bring her along. Is that all right?",
        "Baz: Yeah. That's cool. In fact, she can help. You want to hold that?",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "Baz: All right. Good.",
        "Starr: Go ahead. Play.",
        "Baz: Can you shake it? Shake it.",
        "Starr: Wow.",
        "Baz: See? She's a natural.",
        "Starr: Whoa, she really likes you. She's not usually good with strangers. In fact, she's been having problems with James lately.",
        "Baz: Then she and I have a lot in common.",
        "Starr: And what do you have against James?",
        "Baz: Nothing. I just don't think he likes me.",
        "Starr: Well, with Hope, I think it's because she misses her father.",
        "Baz: And where's her father?",
        "Starr: In prison. When she sees James, she sort of takes it out on him, which is hard because Hope is the center of my life and I want him to love her like I do.",
        "Baz: Wow, you really are a mom, aren't you? Cool. Can we stop talking and get to work now? You ready to try this thing?",
        "[Tambourine rattles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Why'd you do it, Dad? If we hate Clint so much, why did you give him mom's heart?",
        "Viki: Shane, I'd like to talk to you just for a minute. Please come outside with me. Please, just for a minute.",
        "Clint: You couldn't tell him, could you?",
        "Rex: Tell him what?",
        "Clint: That you sold me his mother's heart to make yourself rich.",
        "Rex: That's not why I did it.",
        "Clint: No? Then why?",
        "Rex: What do you care? You want to think I'm a gold digger, go ahead. The kid is right. You don't deserve to live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Maybe you didn't hear me, Jack. I said, we have an agreement.",
        "Jack: Yeah, a verbal agreement. Like you always say, they're not worth the paper they're written on.",
        "Todd: That's what you decide to listen to?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why should I work for you at the \"Sun\"? What's the point?",
        "Todd: What does that mean, \"What's the point?\"",
        "Jack: Gigi Morasco is dead. Last night, they gave her heart away to someone else.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I understand the implications of that. Do you?",
        "Jack: There's stuff about me in here, too, Dad, about how the cops let me go. Look. \"No charges have been filed against initial suspect Jack Manning, son of local tabloid publisher Todd Manning.\" Look on the next page. \"When asked why Jack Manning was released, Chief of Detectives John McBain stated, \"You'll have to ask the kid's father.\"",
        "Todd: Why do you read this garbage?",
        "Jack: Dad, everyone reads it, and they're all gonna think I'm guilty, no matter what.",

        "Blair: What's going on?",
        "Starr: So you gonna show me whatever it is you want me to sing?",
        "Baz: No. No. That's not how I work. See, I use what I hear and find, and then I put it all together. Sing something.",
        "Starr: Like what?",
        "Baz: Anything. Here use the kid. Sing something to her, anything you like.",
        "Starr: Is it ok if I sing to you, sweetie? Ok. Ready? Is it hard to give? Is it hard to take when you won't let anyone in? Well?",
        "Baz: I've heard worse.",
        "Starr: Gee, thanks. Oh, wait. That's what I said to you when I first heard your music. All right. You got me. Now what?",
        "Baz: Listen. I recorded while you were singing.",

        "Deanna: Nate, hey, I got your text. What's up?",
        "Nate: I just wanted you to know that I told Rick it's over. We're not making his movie.",
        "Deanna: That's great, but what's gonna happen to you?",
        "Nate: I don't know, but even if I go to jail, at least Rick can't use what I did to manipulate you anymore.",
        "Deanna: Thanks, and if there's anything I can do to help out, just say the word. I'm here for you.",
        "Dani: Hey.",
        "Nate: Uh, Dani, hey.",
        "Dani: Hi.",
        "Nate: I was just thanking Deanna for helping my mom out with something.",
        "Dani: I see.",
        "Deanna: It was no big deal. I should head back to work.",
        "Dani: Bye. What the hell, Nate?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Honey, I know how much this hurts--I really do-- and I can tell you that in time, it will get a little easier, ok? It won't hurt quite so much. You have to know how much I loved your mother. I think the time that I spent in Texas with you and Gigi was one of the happiest times of my whole life, and it was because of you two. I will never ever forget her, and I know that a part of her will always live inside me, and a big part of your mother will always live inside you, too, ok? You're gonna be ok.",
        "Shane: Thanks.",
        "Rex: You ok?",
        "Shane: How could you do it, Dad?",
        "Rex: Look. I know this doesn't make much sense right now, but it will, ok? I promise.",
        "Shane: When?",
        "Rex: Ok. All right. You deserve to know everything. We're in this together, you and me. Let's go home, and I'll tell you everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So what were the two of you talking about?",
        "Jack: Nothing.",
        "Blair: Really? Then why did I hear you say when everybody reads it, they're gonna think you're guilty, anyway, huh?",
        "Todd: He's worried that people are gonna think he's responsible for what happened to Gigi, even though the charges were dropped.",
        "Blair: Is that right?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Look at this. Look at this crap that my sister is printing in her rag.",
        "Blair: You're calling the \"Banner\" a rag now?",
        "Todd: She's smearing her own nephew.",
        "Blair: What she printed isn't true?",
        "Todd: Well, they released Jack. There was no evidence, no charges filed.",
        "Blair: Doesn't it say that in the article?",
        "Todd: Yeah, except for this quote by John McBain which makes him look guilty.",
        "Blair: Well, why would John say that?",
        "Todd: Well, you know John. He's trying to protect his own ass, trying to make himself look good.",
        "Blair: Really? You think so?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Why would they let Jack go if they had something on him?",
        "Blair: Well, I don't know, Todd. Why would they?",
        "Todd: Don't you look at me like that. He is innocent.",
        "Blair: Is that true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: That boy's been through so much. I can't really blame him for being angry and lashing out. His whole world is shattered.",
        "Clint: Believe it or not, I don't blame him, not at all. It's so tough to lose your mother. But at least Shane and Rex have all my money to cheer them up.",
        "Viki: What really happened between you and Rex?",
        "Clint: You know what happened.",
        "Viki: No. Actually, I have no idea what happened. When he agreed to give you Gigi's heart, what did he really want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Just let me put this down. We need to talk. I need you to understand why I did what I did.",
        "Shane: Maybe later.",
        "Rex: Shane--",
        "Shane: No.",
        "Rex: Ok. You need to hear this. We're in this together, remember? I never wanted to give Clint your mom's heart.",
        "Shane: Then why'd you do it? He hates us.",
        "Rex: And we hate him, too, but I got something out of it. I got control of the company he owns. I got his house, his plane, his bank accounts. Everything.",
        "Shane: That's why you did it? For money?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You know what Balsom wanted--my money. And he took it all.",
        "Viki: No, that's not what I mean. Why did he want it? What was driving him?",
        "Clint: Same thing that's always driven him--greed. Balsom is the gold-digging son of a bitch I always knew he was.",
        "Viki: Please stop this. Please. Please let it go. Clint, you've gotta let go of all this hatred, this resentment. He's your son. And if you can get past it, maybe he can, too.",
        "Clint: That's a beautiful theory.",
        "Viki: Ok, fine. Then I'll stick to the facts. Despite how you two feel about each other and whatever his reason for giving you the heart, the point is, you have it. And with that heart comes a second chance at life. I'm begging you not to waste it.",
        "Clint: Viki, what kind of a life can I have now? When I thought I was gonna die, I confessed to-- hell, just about everything. Looks like I jumped the gun.",
        "Bo: You beat the reaper again. You're gonna be ok.",
        "Clint: I'm fine. How's Matthew?",
        "Bo: He's holding his own. I'm glad you're ok.",
        "Clint: Thanks. So now you're happy. The kids are happy. Viki was just telling me about my magnificent second chance. Looks like everybody conveniently-- they've forgotten all my crimes.",
        "Viki: Oh, for heaven's sakes, this is not the time to talk about that.",
        "Clint: One thing I've learned from all this, that right now is the perfect time to do everything. When I thought I was going to die, confession looked like a good thing, but now that I'm not going to die, time to pay the piper. Right, Bo?",

        "[Matthew groaning]",
        "Nora: Ok, you know what, sweetie? You gotta stop this now. You're gonna make yourself sick, honey. No. Oh, God, no. Somebody help me! Somebody! He's having a seizure. Go find a doctor now! Oh, God. Matthew!",

        "Nate: Look, Dani, it wasn't--",
        "Dani: What? Not what it looked like?",
        "Nate: No. And I know...",
        "Dani: You know, I'm not sure what's worse--that you're lying to me or that you're so bad at it.",
        "Nate: Dani.",
        "Dani: No. Just tell me the truth. Are you messing around with Deanna behind my back?",

        "Rex: I didn't do this for the money. Not exactly.",
        "Shane: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Rex: Shane, the money is a means to an end. I wanted the money so that I could protect you.",
        "Shane: So you sell Mom's heart for a big house and a private jet?",
        "Rex: Shane, listen to me. You are the most important person in the world to me now. And now nobody can hurt either one of us again the way Jack and his father hurt your mom. Besides, it's not so bad--we get to live in that big mansion.",
        "Shane: But I want to stay here, where we lived with Mom.",
        "Rex: This really isn't our house. But now we own the Buchanan Mansion. It's got a million rooms, it's got a pool, a gym, and we have horses and cars.",
        "Shane: No! I don't want it! I don't want any of it! And I know why you're doing this. You just want to forget all about Mom!",

        "Jack: It's like Dad said. I didn't do anything.",
        "Todd: That's right. So we've cleared that up. We're wasting time now, right? I want you to get dressed for work.",
        "Blair: What? Dressed for what?",
        "Todd: Jack's coming to work with me at \"The Sun.\" Put on a suit.",
        "Blair: Why am I not surprised that you don't discuss this with me?",
        "Todd: Blair, he's gonna take over the paper anyway someday. I'm gonna show him the ropes. What's to discuss?",
        "Blair: You don't discuss anything with me lately.",
        "Todd: Like what, for instance?",
        "Blair: Why didn't you tell me that Jack was arrested?",
        "Todd: I tried. I tried to contact you. You were in New York.",
        "Blair: With a phone. You didn't even leave a message.",
        "Todd: That's not something you leave a voice mail--",
        "Blair: You didn't leave a message because you didn't call, Todd. I found out from T\u00e9a, as a matter of fact.",
        "Todd: So what's the problem?",
        "Blair: The problem is that you didn't tell me because you did something that you didn't want me to know about. You covered up the fact that Jack's responsible for Gigi's death. Why don't you just admit it?",

        "Deanna: Go away. I just saw Nate and I know he told you we're not doing your stupid movie.",
        "Rick: Because Matthew Buchanan's gonna tell his parents about Nate anyway, right?",
        "Deanna: Right. So if you don't mind...",
        "Rick: The thing is, Nate doesn't know that the Buchanan kid took a turn for the worse. Think it--seizure or something.",
        "Deanna: What?",
        "Rick: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Doesn't look good. I felt so bad for the parents. I was gonna tell them about Nate anyway. What? But they have a right to know what happened to their boy. You know how to reach me. Don't take too long. \"Hold the Diploma\"'s gotta go into production ASAP. Hey! Cheer up. You and Nate are gonna be stars after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Dani: Then tell me the truth. What were you and Deanna talking about?",
        "Nate: I promise it has nothing to do with--",
        "Dani: Then why can't you just tell me?",
        "Nate: Because it's Deanna's personal business, ok? She told me in confidence.",
        "Dani: I don't believe you.",
        "Nate: Dani--",

        "Bo: No, no. It can wait.",
        "Viki: Well, thank you. Thank you. Despite all the things he's confessed to, I do not believe that he committed murder. What--ok, what was that look?",
        "Clint: I stand by my confession. Nothing's changed.",
        "Bo: I gotta get back to Matthew. We'll talk later.",
        "Clint: Yes. Yes, you go take care of your son. Matthew needs to get better so he can live a long and happy life.",
        "Viki: Ok. What was all that about?",
        "Clint: What was what about?",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint, come on. I'm not stupid. Something's going on between you and Bo. You didn't kill Eddie Ford. I know that. And Bo knows it, too. But he's allowing you to confess to it. He's letting you.",
        "Clint: Bo doesn't let me do anything.",

        "Clint: Viki, let it go.",
        "Viki: No. I'm not gonna let it go. And thank heavens you're not in any position to argue with me. So I suggest you tell me. Who did it? Is it Nora? I know she couldn't remember anything about that night. Was it Nora?",
        "Clint: No. It wasn't Nora.",

        "Destiny: Commissioner Buchanan, Matthew had a seizure.",
        "Bo: What happened?",
        "Nora: I tried to calm him down, I did, but he was determined to talk. He was just desperate to tell me something.",
        "Bo: Is he ok?",
        "Doctor: That's what I'm trying to determine. I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to step out.",
        "Destiny: Is Matthew gonna be all right?",
        "Bo: They don't know yet.",

        "Rex: Shane, no! Your mother was the love of my life. And I will never, ever forget her. That is not why I did this.",
        "Shane: Then why? Why take Clint's money?",
        "Rex: I did this to remember her. To honor her. Jack Manning got away with what he did to your mom, because his father is rich and powerful. We're rich and powerful now, too.",
        "Shane: Great! So now we all have money. So what?",
        "Rex: It's not about having the money. It's about what we can do with it. The law couldn't touch Jack. They couldn't make him pay for what he did, but we can. We are going to get them.",
        "Shane: How?",
        "Rex: I have some ideas. But we're gonna live in the mansion, and we're gonna let everybody in town know that they can't mess with us. You understand?",
        "Shane: It's still not gonna bring Mom back.",
        "Rex: I know. But at least the people who did this aren't gonna get away with it. Not after we're done with them.",

        "Rex: Yeah. We can take all of it. Whatever you want. What do you say? Let's pack up, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Ok, Blair, yes. I kept it from you. I don't know what you want from me. So our son killed someone.",
        "Blair: So he's responsible?",
        "Todd: No, he's not responsible, thanks to me.",
        "Blair: What'd you do, Todd?",
        "Todd: Blair, would you prefer him go away for murder for the rest of his life? You realize that what's-her-face is dead.",
        "Blair: \"What's-her-face\" had a name. She had a family. She had a life, Todd.",
        "Todd: John McBain wanted to put Jack away forever.",
        "Blair: Why would John do that? It was a freak accident.",
        "Todd: He doesn't care. He doesn't care if Jack's actually innocent or not.",
        "Blair: Why would he do that? Why? Why?",
        "Todd: I don't know. Why don't you go and call John and turn our son in? Or how about this? You could actually be Jack's mother.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: And we could put this thing behind us. What do you say?",

        "Blair: Are you gonna call the cops?",
        "Todd: No, unless you'd like to turn in your son for grand theft auto as well.",
        "Blair: The person who took the car was--",
        "Todd: Jack. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: That looks heavy. You got all your clothes in there?",
        "Shane: And some of Mom's stuff. But I couldn't fit all of it.",
        "Rex: Don't worry about it. We can come back for the rest of it. Actually, we can send somebody for the rest of it. How's that? Everything's gonna be all right.",
        "Shane: I know.",

        "Viki: No, I'm sorry. Oh, God, I can't let it go. Oh, my God. Now I know what you were doing. You were protecting your nephew...and trying to redeem yourself along the way and... you thought you were going to die, so...",
        "Clint: Whether I live or die, it doesn't matter. Matthew needs to have his life.",
        "Viki: What about your life? Seriously. You have been given another chance against all possible odds. Let me tell you something--you do not have the right to waste that life. You do not have the right to waste that heart, that young woman's heart, by confessing to something you didn't even do."
