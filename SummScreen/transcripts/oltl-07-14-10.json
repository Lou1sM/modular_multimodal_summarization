        "Cole: Hey. Here. It's black. The...the milk went bad, with everything else in the fridge.",
        "Starr: Well, I guess we've been gone for such a long time. I'll just go to the store later...if Hope ever winds down. She's been up since 7:00.",
        "Cole: Uh-uh. She started playing horsey on daddy's arm at 6:00.",
        "Starr: I didn't even feel the bed move. Hmm. We'll put her back in her bed tonight. I just think that she really wanted to be close as possible with us last night. Mm-hmm.",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Well, thanks for letting me sleep.",
        "Cole: Well, I didn't have the heart to wake you up. You looked like you were having a great dream.",

        "Langston's voice: Markko, I will be sorry for the rest of my life for hurting you.",
        "Markko's voice: I don't want to talk about this now.",
        "Langston's voice: Then when do you want to talk about it? You won't return my calls.",
        "Markko's voice: Oh, gee, I wonder why.",
        "Langston's voice: Please, can we just talk?",
        "Langston: What, are you following me or something?",
        "Ford: I was here first.",
        "Langston: But you know that this is where I come to write.",
        "Ford: Forgive me for wanting a little fresh air.",

        "Langston: So you're leaving?",
        "Ford: No.",
        "Langston: Then I do have to. I don't want to be around you, Ford. And I heard about all the crappy things you said to Blair about me.",
        "Ford: How is it crappy to say that I can't stop thinking about you?",
        "Langston: Because you're only saying it to jerk me around.",
        "Ford: All right, you know what? I don't blame you for thinking that, but you're wrong.",
        "Langston: It doesn't matter. It's too late.",
        "Ford: So you don't even want to hear me out?",
        "Langston: Why should I? There's nothing you could say that could change my mind.",

        "Todd: Well, I can't leave, so you're stuck with me.",
        "Dani: Yeah, and I won't go, either. It's the least I can do for you. Hey, Todd... um, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry that I believed you could have hurt Marty's baby.",
        "Todd: Oh, well, that's okay.",
        "Nora: Cutting it close, Counselor.",
        "T\u00e9a: We were having a... a breakfast celebration.",
        "Nora: Celebrating?",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles] Wouldn't you be?",
        "Bailiff: All rise. The Honorable Judge Shriver presiding.",
        "Judge: Have a seat. First, let me congratulate you on your marriage, Nora.",
        "Nora: Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you for the toaster oven.",
        "Judge: And we're on the record in the Commonwealth versus Todd Manning. Charges are attempted murder and murder of an unborn child.",
        "Todd: Hey, have you ever seen your mom in court?",
        "Judge: I thought the parties were ready to proceed, but this morning I received--",
        "Todd: It's a thing of beauty.",
        "Judge: Another motion to dismiss from the defense.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, we ask that all charges against my client be dropped.",
        "Judge: On what grounds?",
        "T\u00e9a: Someone else has confessed to the crimes.",

        "Blair: Oh. There you are! Mmm.",
        "Eli: As fast as I could.",
        "Blair: Mmm. Hope I didn't pull you away from your client.",
        "Eli: Well, I'm probably going to have to go back and see her pretty soon.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Eli: And while we're on the subject, I want to tell you this because you deserve to know.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Eli: The client in question...",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Can you tell me one more time?",
        "Hannah: I already told you. I told Dr. Levin, I told...",
        "Marty: Someone else?",
        "Hannah: No, you guys. I mean, everyone.",
        "Marty: Do you know why you're at Saint Ann's?",
        "Hannah: I did terrible things.",
        "Marty: You're here so we can help you. I know you said that you had attacked Robert Ford and you say that you pushed me down the stairs.",
        "Hannah: Yes.",
        "Marty: Why did you say those things?",
        "Eli's voice: It's very simple. If you want to keep Cole safe, you're going to tell the police that you pushed Marty Saybrooke down those stairs, and then you went on and attacked Ford, too.",
        "Hannah: I do what I'm told.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Blair, I'm sorry I didn't tell you before about representing Hannah. She actually requested me, though.",
        "Blair: She did?",
        "Eli: She did. I hope that's not going to be a problem for you. Because if it is, I--I'll tell you right now--",
        "Blair: No, no.",
        "Eli: You sure?",
        "Blair: Oh--yeah, I am sure.",
        "Eli: Good. So, about my proposal...do you have an answer for me?",
        "Blair: Eli, I have been thinking so much about my future, and what I want for the rest of my life, and whether or not having you in my life with my children is a good thing, or not.",
        "Eli: So? What did you decide?",
        "Blair: Ask me again.",
        "Eli: Blair Cramer, will you marry me?",
        "Blair: Yes. [Giggling] Yes.",
        "Eli: Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: First, you tell me that you love me, then that you never even cared about me, and now you... you know what? I don't care if you miss me because I don't miss the way you treated me.",
        "Ford: Wait a second, Lang. It could be different now. We could be friends.",
        "Langston: Friends? You don't even know the meaning of the word.",
        "Ford: Well, then I'll learn. I have to. I need you, Langston. I don't have anybody else.",
        "Langston: And whose fault is that?",
        "Ford: Mine, okay? I know. I get that, but give me a chance to fix things. Haven't you ever needed a second chance?",
        "Langston: Let me go.",
        "Ford: I can't.",
        "Markko: Hey! Get your damn hands off her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What do you think? Trash, or fixable?",
        "Starr: Oh...I think it's fixable. Where did you find that?",
        "Cole: Underneath the bed in Markko's old room.",
        "Starr: I thought that we cleaned up everything. I mean, how did it wind up under there?",
        "Cole: I don't know--ask your friend Bull.",
        "Starr: Hmm, we're not sure that it was him.",
        "Cole: Isn't that what your other new friend said?",
        "Starr: His name is James and he was just guessing. It could have been Hannah.",
        "Cole: Well, why would she? And you know what? She was really surprised when Natalie said that our place had been tossed.",
        "Starr: What, like Hannah's never lied?",
        "Cole: This Bull guy was actually looking for something. He had a reason to tear up the apartment.",
        "Starr: Hannah doesn't need a reason. I mean, she wants you all to herself. She wanted to trash our lives, and she did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Someone told you to confess?",
        "Eli's voice: And what about Cole Thornhart? Will he be safe, do you think?",
        "Hannah: Leave Cole alone.",
        "Eli: I'd like to. He's a good kid. It'd be a damn shame if something bad had to happen to him, and you had to spend the rest of your life knowing it was all your fault.",
        "Marty: Who told you?",
        "Hannah: He...well, he doesn't have a name.",
        "Marty: But it's a him?",
        "Hannah: Yeah, he's bossy. That's how I know him. You do what he says, or else...",
        "Marty: Do you hear any other voices?",
        "Hannah: Yeah, some of them are so sweet to me. Really nice.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm, and what do they say?",
        "Hannah: Well, they just want me to be better. To sleep and... they said the sleeping pills would fix everything. And they would have.",
        "Marty: But when that didn't happen, did you make another decision?",
        "Hannah: No, there's another one. She's... she's real bitchy, angry. She doesn't like it when people push me around.",
        "Marty: Yeah, well, what did she say?",
        "Hannah: She said that Ford needed to be punished. And that way, I would be free and Cole could be mine.",
        "Marty: How was that going to happen?",
        "Hannah: She told me to push you down the stairs and blame it on Todd. That would break Cole and Starr up, and then I could have Cole.",
        "Marty: How long have you been hearing these voices?",
        "Hannah: [Sighs] Well, when I moved here for school last summer. Maybe earlier.",
        "Marty: And what did they say then?",
        "Hannah: That I would have a great year. And that they would take care of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eli: I'm sorry, would you kindly repeat that?",
        "Blair: Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.",
        "[Eli chuckles]",
        "Eli: You've made me the happiest man alive.",
        "Blair: Mmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Am I going to wish I read the paper this morning?",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, last night, Hannah O'Connor admitted to having pushed Dr. Saybrooke down the hospital stairs.",
        "Judge: The prosecution's Hannah O'Connor?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Their star witness is under arrest.",
        "Judge: Counsel, is this true?",
        "Nora: Yes, Your Honor. Hannah O'Connor has been arrested for assault, but not for this crime.",
        "Judge: Why not?",
        "Nora: She is currently under observation at Saint Ann's, and she apparently had a mental breakdown last night, and we're in the process of determining the veracity of any of her statements.",
        "T\u00e9a: Which is not a recommendation for Ms. O'Connor as a witness, either. These are the affidavits of the people who were present when Ms. O'Connor admitted to having lied when she identified Mr. Manning as Dr. Saybrooke's attacker. This girl is the centerpiece of the D.A.'s case. Without her, they have nothing. They have to drop the charges.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Eli: I don't believe this.",
        "Blair: You can't back out now.",
        "Eli: Oh, I just can't believe my luck. Do you think I'd want to?",
        "Blair: Well, do you think I was going to say no?",
        "Eli: What, without a ring?",
        "Blair: Well, see, that's the best part. I get to help pick it out.",
        "Eli: Oh. All part of my master plan.",
        "Blair: Oh, are you kidding me? You've been flying by the seat of these gorgeous pants.",
        "Eli: It's true. I'm just glad it worked. Well, Blair, we got a lot of planning to do.",
        "Blair: I know. It's...",
        "Jack: For what?",
        "Eli: For the wedding. Your mom and I are getting married.",
        "Jack: Shut up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: [Whispering] She's awesome.",
        "Todd: [Whispering] Oh, yeah. She's just getting warmed up, too.",
        "Judge: Counsel, does the Commonwealth want to contest this motion to dismiss?",
        "Nora: Oh, we would love to, Your Honor, but the defense is correct. We're in no position to pursue these charges, so we are prepared to drop them.",
        "Judge: Done. Todd Manning, this court orders that the indictment against you be vacated, and your bail be remitted. We are adjourned.",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Um...",
        "Jack: So is this true?",
        "Blair: You know, Jack, this isn't actually the way that I really wanted you to find out, so I just--",
        "Jack: But it's true?",
        "Eli: I'm so sorry, it just--I was so happy, I just said it. It just happened.",
        "Jack: Well, yippee. So was it supposed to be a secret?",
        "Blair: No, it's not a secret, actually. No.",
        "Jack: So I'm the first one to find out for once?",
        "Eli: Yes, that's right, little buddy. So tell me, how does it feel to have me as a stepdad?",
        "Jack: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Can we please not talk about Hannah? Look, she's in jail. All right? And she's not going to bother us anymore.",
        "Starr: I guess so. I'm just glad that she didn't hurt you.",
        "Cole: Oh, she wouldn't have.",
        "Starr: Cole, she wanted you! That girl is dangerous when she doesn't get what she wants. I mean, she could have--",
        "Cole: Look, nothing happened.",
        "Starr: All right, I know.",
        "Cole: Looks like she's winding down.",
        "Starr: Hey, Hope, you ready for your nap?",
        "Cole: Come on, baby girl. Come on. There you go. Up and at 'em.",
        "Starr: Sleep tight, sweetie.",
        "Cole: Oh, she will.",
        "Starr: Hi, I'm calling about a patient who came in yesterday. His name is James Ford. I just wanted to see how he's doing. Well, no, I'm just a friend, but... never mind. Forget it.",
        "Cole: Hey, did somebody call?",
        "Starr: No. I called to check on James.",
        "Cole: Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I mean it, Ford. Get the hell out of here.",
        "Ford: Is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, maybe we shouldn't put Jack on the spot right now.",
        "Jack: No problem. I can roll with it.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay, as in...",
        "Jack: If you're happy, I'm happy.",
        "Eli: Yeah? Well...okay, I'm glad I passed muster. That's a relief. Listen, I better go see that client now.",
        "Blair: Oh, Hannah?",
        "Eli: As soon as I make sure she's okay, I will be right back. Take it easy, little buddy.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: I am so sorry. I...you weren't supposed to find out like this, you know.",
        "Jack: Okay, first, he needs to lose the \"little buddy\" act if he wants to live until sundown. Second of all, you seriously can't marry that clown.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Do you want me to go?",
        "Langston: Yes.",
        "Ford: And everything I just said...",
        "Langston: It doesn't matter. Even if I did believe you, it's way too late. Leave me alone.",
        "Ford: All right. She's all yours. Oh, guess not.",
        "Markko: Do I want to know what that was about?",
        "Langston: I don't...I'm so embarrassed that I ever even... you don't want to hear that. So why are you here?",
        "Markko: Looking for you.",

        "Todd: Well, you certainly got whipped, Nora.",
        "T\u00e9a: It is always a pleasure doing business with you, Nora.",
        "Nora: Well, don't make it sound like it's the last time. Next time won't be so easy.",
        "Todd: Oh, hey, I'm also going to sue you and the L.P.D. for wrongful arrest and--",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, ta-ta-ta-take it easy. You're free. Be grateful for once in your life.",
        "Dani: Yeah, Todd. You were great.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thanks. Court is my best event, but from here on in, it's very, very, very, very boring paperwork, so get out of here. Scram.",
        "Dani: No.",
        "T\u00e9a: Honey, it's a gorgeous day outside. You can't be with me 24/7. Come on, get out of here.",

        "Nate: Yeah.",
        "James: You look different without duct tape on your mouth.",
        "Nate: Huh. Or the look of terror that I'm about to be killed?",
        "James: That, too.",
        "Nate: Look, I'm sorry.",
        "James: You're the one who took the money.",
        "Nate: I found it, at the quarry.",
        "James: You figured 50k dropped out of the sky just for you?",
        "Nate: I didn't spend it right off the bat. I waited around for a while to see if anyone would come for it. Yeah, I know. I'm not here to make excuses.",
        "James: So what did you do with the money?",
        "Nate: It went to a good cause. Someone who really needed it.",
        "James: Yeah?",
        "Nate: Yeah. I mean, it's not like they were going to die without it, but close. I mean, they were going to be homeless. Which is not like being shot at, but... listen, I didn't know taking that cash would put so many people in danger. I am so sorry.",
        "Ford: Sorry?",
        "James: Hey, Bobby. This is that--",
        "Ford: The punk who got you shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Cole: It was an accident. But he...",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Cole: Never mind.",
        "Starr: Just say it.",
        "Cole: Look, you wouldn't have been in any danger if the guy hadn't put you there in the first place. Look, let's just...let's just not talk about James, either.",
        "Starr: What would you like to do instead? Would you like to write a grocery list? Or run some errands? Or talk about how we're going to redecorate Markko's room for Hope? Would that buy us some time?",
        "Cole: You know, a little normal would be nice.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it would be nice. Only we're still cleaning up after your stalker or my bounty hunter that trashed our apartment. Between that and taking care of Hope, we haven't said one word to each other about what really happened when we were gone. Instead, we just keep saying, \"no Hannah\" or \"no James,\" like it's going to... it's going to magically disappear.",
        "Cole: Look, Starr, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I--I should never have believed Hannah.",
        "Starr: About my dad?",
        "Cole: Yeah. And for once, I owe your dad an apology. I can't believe I'm saying it, but I do. And I don't know what else to say about Hannah or J...",
        "Starr: His name is James, Cole, and nothing happened.",
        "Cole: You're saying nothing happened between you two?",

        "Marty: I can't say.",
        "Nora: You know, this whole breakdown just feels very convenient to me. Is it an act?",

        "Eli: Excuse me.",
        "Nora: Ooh! Not so fast, not so fast, not so fast. The doctors haven't signed off yet.",
        "Eli: Come on, Nora, that's my client.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, you know... she's in the middle of evaluation--a psychiatric evaluation. You want the record clear, don't you?",
        "Eli: Are you implying that a conversation with her lawyer is going to somehow muddy the waters? Hannah has been evaluated.",
        "Nora: And the doctors may have more questions.",
        "Eli: Oh, and more questions, and more tests. And then the new doctor, right? And then on and on and on until you get the report you want. Don't you want a clear record, Counselor?",
        "Nora: Well, that would be helpful to both of us.",
        "Eli: Tell me this. Has Hannah changed her story?",
        "Nora: No.",

        "Cole: No, we haven't turned the TV on all day. Wait, wait--did you say Saint Ann's?",

        "Hannah: How can it be? I'm a loose end. You almost killed two people. You did kill a baby, and why would you let me live?",
        "Eli: Well, why not? You now officially have a history of mental illness, so even if you do turn your back on me, no one's going to believe you. All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you'll keep breathing, and Cole will keep breathing. And I'll check on you tomorrow.",

        "Marty: He thinks she shows classic symptoms of schizophrenia.",
        "Nora: But you don't?",
        "Marty: The way she talks about voices is right, I guess, but then she flips it to Cole, and it just doesn't fit with the aggregate of the other symptoms. Something just seems off to me.",
        "Nora: Okay, does that mean she's faking it?",
        "Marty: I--I don't know. I don't think we should trust my gut on this. I think I'm too close.",
        "Nora: I mean, because if she's faking it, she's doing a damn good job. She fooled Dr. Levin.",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "Nora: Okay, so, throw me a bone here. What do we do? What do we need?",
