        "T\u00e9a: Todd? Are you all right? Todd? What's going on? Oh--",
        "Todd: Okay--",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh! You're having sex with Blair?",
        "Todd: Well, technically, yes. But you have to--ohh!",
        "T\u00e9a: Bastard!",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Greg: Just a second.",
        "Greg: Hey, Des.",
        "Destiny: You shouldn't open the door without asking who it is first. That's dangerous.",
        "Greg: I'll--I'll keep that in mind for next time. So what brings my beautiful baby sister here?",
        "Destiny: I have a problem, and I need your advice.",
        "Greg: Sure. Lay it on me.",
        "Destiny: It's about Matthew.",
        "Greg: Oh, yeah. I know you're disappointed. I am, too.",
        "Destiny: About what?",
        "Greg: The surgery.",
        "Destiny: What about the surgery?",
        "Greg: Isn't that what you came to talk to me about?",
        "Destiny: I was gonna ask you how you know if a guy likes you. What about Matthew's surgery? He's having it, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: You two are total hypocrites. You know that, right?",
        "Bo: Okay, Matthew. You're angry. I get that.",
        "Matthew: Oh, do you?",
        "Bo: Yeah. And I know that you don't wanna hear any of this, but that doesn't give you the right to be disrespectful to your mother or to me.",
        "Matthew: What are you gonna do? Send me to military school? You think they'll accept a cripple at West Point?",
        "Nora: Don't call yourself that.",
        "Matthew: Or what? And saying \"physically challenged\" or \"disabled\"--that makes it all better? And I'm not being disrespectful. I'm being honest.",
        "Nora: Matthew, you need to try to see this from our perspective.",
        "Matthew: And what perspective is that? Standing up? Mom, you were in a wheelchair after you had your stroke. What if the doctors told you you'd never walk again or talk right or breathe on your own?",
        "Bo: That was different.",
        "Matthew: And then what if a new doctor comes along and says that he can fix everything? And--and there's a slight risk involved? Would you want me and Dad to turn our backs? Would you have let Mom stay like that?",
        "Nora: Okay, honey, after I had my stroke, I had to understand that there was a chance that nothing would be the same for me. And then I realized there were people out there that were far worse off than I was, that are far worse off than you are right now who lead wonderfully productive lives.",
        "Matthew: This is not wonderful! I don't wanna live like this!",
        "Bo: Are you saying that if you can't have the life that you want, then you'd-- you'd rather not have a life at all?",
        "Matthew: Yes!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: How serious is it?",
        "Michael: Generally speaking, a recurrence this soon after treatment isn't a good sign.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God.",
        "Shane: Am I gonna go bald again? I'm playing baseball this summer.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I don't know about any more baseball, Shane. I'm sorry. Another round of chemo is a distinct possibility.",
        "Gigi: So what now?",
        "Michael: Well, before we resort to chemo, I'd like to try another transplant. Fortunately for us, that won't be a problem.",
        "Rex: Stacy's our angel. She saved Shane's life once before, and she can do it again. Right, Stace? So what's next, Michael?",
        "Michael: Stacy, should we get started?",
        "Stacy: Wait. What?",
        "Michael: We need to extract your stem cells again.",
        "Stacy: Now?",
        "Michael: The sooner the better.",
        "Stacy: Oh--",
        "Rex: Stace, you okay? You okay? Poor baby. She doesn't feel good.",
        "Gigi: She's gonna feel a lot worse by the time we're done with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Matthew's not getting the surgery?",
        "Greg: I'm sorry, Des, no.",
        "Destiny: But you promised. You said you could fix him.",
        "Greg: And I believe I can. But--",
        "Destiny: But what? What's the problem?",
        "Greg: Wow. You really like this kid, don't you?",
        "Destiny: We're not talking about me. We're talking about Matthew and why you are going to fix him--like you promised?",
        "Greg: Believe me, it's not that I don't want to.",
        "Destiny: Did Matthew change his mind?",
        "Greg: No. No. He and I both wanna go ahead with the surgery, but his parents decided against it. And without their consent, my hands are tied.",
        "Destiny: They said no? How could they do that?",
        "Greg: There are risks involved, and they don't want to take any chances.",
        "Destiny: Then they're morons, and I'm gonna tell them so.",
        "Greg: Des. Des, wait. Des, come on. Look. Listen to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Matthew, look. We're not saying that you have to spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair.",
        "Matthew: Oh, boy, thanks!",
        "Nora: It's just we're passing on this one opportunity because we're afraid of what might happen to you.",
        "Matthew: And what if I don't care about that?",
        "Nora: Okay, you got to stop talking like that! I can't even believe--I can't--",
        "Bo: I know. I know. Son, you're not thinking clearly right now. That Dr. Evans --he sold you a bill of goods.",
        "Matthew: So I should just pretend I'm totally cool with you guys passing up an opportunity for me to walk again? Because, you know, I wouldn't want you guys to feel bad or anything like that.",
        "Clint: Hello, everybody. Is everything okay?",
        "Bo: We're just working through some stuff.",
        "Clint: Want me to step out?",
        "Matthew: No, that's okay, Uncle Clint. I was just leaving. I wanna thank you for having Dr. Evans come and see me.",
        "Clint: Matthew, it was my pleasure.",
        "Matthew: I know you went through a lot of trouble and spent a lot of money. I'm sorry it turned out to be a big waste of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I am going to say this once. You and me: Done. Never again. Got it?",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. T\u00e9a--hey?",
        "Blair: \"Hey, hey.\" You better do better than \"hey.\" Run after her, Todd. Run after her.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, wait a minute. Wait--",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't you touch me!",
        "Todd: Okay. Okay, I promise I won't touch you. Just hear me out, please.",
        "T\u00e9a: What for? So I can hear you apologize for making a fool out of me yet again?",
        "Todd: You're not a fool.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ho ho ho! But I am. So I can hear your lame apology for having screwed your ex-wife?",
        "Todd: It's not an apology. It's a--it's a reason this happened.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, it's a reason? Screw your reason!",
        "Todd: Hold on. Just--just-- if you leave, you're not gonna hear it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Give me one good reason why I should stay and hear it.",
        "Todd: So I can fix this.",
        "T\u00e9a: Huh. Oh, honey, there's no fixing this. Good-bye, Todd. Get the hell out of my way.",
        "Todd: 5 minutes. Just give me 5 minutes, please. That's all I ask--5 minutes. And then you can do whatever you want, and I'll respect you for it.",
        "Blair: Like that's ever gonna happen.",
        "Todd: Don't listen to her. Listen to me, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Don't worry, Stacy. There won't be nearly as many painful injections this time.",
        "Shane: How'd I do?",
        "Rex: We are getting you an agent. That look on your--",
        "Gigi: Shh, shh, shh.",
        "Rex: On your face when you talked about playing baseball? You are the best and cutest fake-sick kid ever.",
        "Shane: Yeah.",
        "[Stacy vomits]",
        "Gigi: I love that she's in there losing her lunch, because she knows once you find out what a sicko she is, she's gonna lose you.",
        "Shane: Like she ever had you in the first place. Right, Dad?",
        "Gigi: The only thing she can do now is pass off that bag of blood she has stashed away as her own.",
        "Rex: When she goes to get it, I will be right behind her.",
        "Rex: Hey. You okay?",
        "Stacy: No. The thought of all those needles coming at me again is freaking me out. Dr. McBain, are you sure another transplant's the way to go? I mean, if it didn't work the first time, then--",
        "Michael: The recurrence is probably a result of the few stray surviving cancer cells. It's not an indication that the transplant itself was a failure.",
        "Stacy: Oh, but don't you have to get rid of those cancer cells first? I mean, doesn't it go chemo, then transplant?",
        "Gigi: You never told me you became a stripper to pay for med school.",
        "Stacy: Okay, I just don't get what all the rush is about, all right?",
        "Rex: I know you're scared, honey, but Michael knows what to do. If he says Shane needs the transplant now, that's what we do.",
        "Stacy: And what if I say no?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Okay, okay, easy, now. Let's not do anything rash.",
        "Destiny: Like kill Matthew's parents?",
        "Greg: Now, Des...",
        "Destiny: I can't believe they said no. It's like they don't even want him to walk again.",
        "Greg: Of course they want him to walk again.",
        "Destiny: How could they say no? Doesn't Matthew get a vote?",
        "Greg: Look. I, too, think that his parents are making the wrong decision. But they're only doing what they think is best for their son.",
        "Destiny: What's best for their son is to walk again.",
        "Greg: It's a risky surgery, and I told them that. But for them it's a little too risky.",
        "Destiny: It's not risky if you're the doctor. You're the best, right?",
        "Greg: Yes. Yes, I am. But reassurance even from the best isn't enough for some people.",
        "Destiny: Did you tell Matthew's parents that you've never lost a patient? That you've helped thousands of people walk again?",
        "Greg: It doesn't matter. I made my case, and they didn't bite.",
        "Destiny: They're just scared. Maybe if we double-team them--",
        "Greg: Uh, no. But I'm confident that if anyone can make them see the light, it's you. But I'm afraid that this time you're gonna have to go it alone.",
        "Destiny: Why? Where are you gonna be?",
        "Greg: Not here. I'm moving on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I take it the meeting with Dr. Evans didn't go well?",
        "Nora: Uh, actually, he was--he was very hopeful.",
        "Clint: But you decided against the surgery anyway?",
        "Nora: When we asked him about the risks, he said that Matthew's life could be at stake.",
        "Clint: You're kidding.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, but he said there was nothing for us to worry about because he was the best and he could handle anything. Yeah, no, he did. So we thanked him for taking the time to review Matthew's case, and he went on his way.",
        "Nora: Bottom line, Dr. Evans couldn't convince us that the surgery was worth the risks.",
        "Clint: Did he give you a ballpark idea about what the odds of success were?",
        "Bo: He said there was a small chance, you see, but we don't need more optimism right now. We need to be sure.",
        "Clint: Okay.",
        "Bo: What, Clint? Is something on your mind? You don't have to hold it in. You can go ahead and say it.",
        "Clint: What's there to say? You're Matthew's parents. You've made the decision.",
        "Bo: And you think we made the wrong decision, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So what are you saying? You won't help Shane?",
        "Stacy: Of course I'll help Shane. It's just everything's moving so fast. Last time it took a while.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, fortunately, we don't have to run all the tests that we ran last time. We can harvest those stem cells tonight.",
        "Stacy: Tonight?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Stacy: No, no, no, I'm sorry. I've got stuff I got to take care of first. I got to pack an overnight bag. I have to cancel all my classes.",
        "Michael: You can take care of what you got to take care of, but just don't take too long, you know. I'm gonna get the ball rolling with Shane.",
        "Stacy: Sure. Whatever.",
        "Rex: Stace, you okay? You look kind of wobbly. How about I give you a ride?",
        "Stacy: I'll be fine.",
        "Rex: It's no trouble, honey.",
        "Stacy: Shouldn't you just stay here with Shane now?",
        "Rex: You are so sweet. You always put my needs ahead of everything else.",
        "Stacy: And you would do the same thing for me, right?",
        "Rex: You know I would. Why would you even ask?",
        "Stacy: I don't know. I guess I just needed to hear it.",
        "Gigi: All right, um, we're gonna go get Shane admitted. Come on.",
        "Rex: Uh, you sure you're okay? It's not just about the needles?",
        "Stacy: Oh, you're right. Something is wrong.",
        "Rex: What is it? You can tell me.",
        "Stacy: It's you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: 5 minutes. I promise it'll be worth it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine. Talk.",
        "Todd: Are you gonna listen to me?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. But I will enjoy watching you squirm. Your 5 minutes begin now.",
        "Todd: All right, so what you walked in on--God. It--it really wasn't what it looked like.",
        "Blair: Todd, this is a terrible start.",
        "Todd: Are you still here?",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. It's between the two of you. Don't mind me.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Blair: I'm just tidying things up. You know how Dorian hates the kids' stuff around the pool. I'm not listening. Go ahead. Whatever.",
        "Todd: What you saw was all out of context.",
        "T\u00e9a: You were having sex with your ex-wife, and you're talking to me about context?",
        "Todd: But you weren't here, though. I mean, you didn't see how it began.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, thank God.",
        "Todd: Well, she hired this pool boy to fawn all over her...",
        "Blair: No, it was a lifeguard to help the kids with their swimming.",
        "Todd: And he was trying to make time with her, and she ended up making a complete ass out of herself.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you got jealous.",
        "Todd: No, I wasn't jealous. That's the point. She's the one who's jealous--of you. Now, of course, instead of acting like an adult about it, she threw her clothes off in front of me.",
        "T\u00e9a: And?",
        "Todd: And.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you had sex with her?",
        "Todd: Yes. See?",
        "T\u00e9a: \"See\"? See what?",
        "Todd: See? It was an accident.",
        "T\u00e9a: I seemed to have missed the part where you slipped on a banana peel, feel over naked, and landed on top of her.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, you're missing my point.",
        "Blair: I got his point.",
        "Todd: What happened between Blair and me meant nothing. It meant nothing. Certainly not to me. Probably not to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Well, all I'm saying is that you should talk it through a little more and just give Matthew a chance to make his case. Where's the harm in that?",
        "Bo: But what's the point if I'm not going to let it happen? You know what? All I can think about right now is Nora and me sitting in a hospital waiting room, and somebody coming in and saying, \"We're sorry, but your son is gone,\" because you made the decision to end his life.",
        "Clint: Yeah, every surgery is risky. And if the two of you are looking for a guarantee that no harm will ever come to Matthew, you're not gonna get it. You might as well not let him out of the house.",
        "Bo: But come on. We talked to tons of other doctors about this procedure.",
        "Nora: They all agreed. They all said that the surgery wasn't worth the risks.",
        "Clint: Well, Dr. Evans isn't just \"other doctors.\" He's at the top of his field. And if he thinks that the odds are good that Matthew will come out of this surgery able to walk again, I think you should listen.",
        "Bo: The guy is an arrogant jerk, and I'm not gonna allow my son to go under the knife when he can end up dead.",
        "Clint: I'm not saying that you should change your minds. But if you just lay down the law and you don't seriously listen to Matthew, you're gonna lose him. I saw it in his face. I saw how angry he is.",
        "Bo: No, don't tell me about my son.",
        "Clint: Well, maybe I should.",
        "Nora: Okay, you know what we should do? Probably take a little time-out here. That's what we should do.",
        "Clint: Or do you wanna end up like you and Pa--spend half your life hating each other and the other half not knowing what you're doing with each other?",
        "Bo: Well, what I don't want is to visit my son in a cemetery. Now, I don't expect you to understand all this, Clint, because you've got 5 healthy kids, all right? I've got one.",
        "Clint: Or you could count David Vickers.",
        "Bo: I'm talking about the one in the wheelchair. And don't try to make decisions about Matthew. You're not his father. You never will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: What do you mean, you're leaving? You just got here.",
        "Greg: Look. I have patients all over the country who need the kind of help that Matthew's parents decided against. And it wouldn't be fair if I stayed here when I could be of some real good someplace else, right?",
        "Destiny: What makes you think you're not doing any good here?",
        "Greg: What do you mean?",
        "Destiny: I like having you around, even if you can't help Matthew. Or am I a waste of your time, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It was just sex. It meant nothing. Not to me, not to her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well?",
        "Todd: Go on, tell her.",
        "Blair: That's right. It's just sex.",
        "Todd: See? What did I tell you?",
        "Blair: Hot, dirty sex. The kind that when you start, you just can't stop. You know, the one that you compare all your other lovers against? That kind of sex.",
        "Todd: That's enough, Blair.",
        "Blair: The kind of sex that you could only have with someone you've had a long history with but you don't care about anymore. Because if you cared, then you'd ruin it. But that kind of history--you know it's gonna happen over and over again no matter who you're with. No matter if either one of you want it or not. But no matter how you spin it, it's still just that kind of sex. You know?",
        "Todd: What the hell is the matter with you, Blair?",
        "Blair: You asked.",
        "Todd: Don't listen to her. She's just a bitch. She's just a spiteful, hurtful bitch.",
        "T\u00e9a: At least when she hurts us, it's with the truth. Blair? I appreciate your candor.",
        "Blair: Your welcome, Ms. T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, you've just given me all the reasons why I need to cut ties with Todd forever.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, don't say that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you don't wanna hear that? Okay, hear this. I never want to see you again.",
        "Todd: No, sweetheart, you don't mean that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, God. Don't call me \"sweetheart.\" I'm so--I'm so stupid. You know, I'm --I-- ha ha ha! I thought that--that something had changed between us.",
        "Todd: Something has changed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, sure. That night, you know, the night that, um, before Starr's wedding, I thought that we'd actually gone to a new--a new place, you know? You made that stupid lie about coming over looking for your slippers because you wanted to--you wanted to see me.",
        "Todd: I did.",
        "T\u00e9a: And then after we made love, you--you didn't want to leave. Remember?",
        "Todd: Yes. That was one of the best nights of my life.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I actually thought, you know, it's not about sex. It's not about power. It's not about custody of the kids. I thought when you were holding me, that you really wanted to be holding me. And it wasn't just some physical need to hold someone, anyone. How--God, I'm so stupid! Ha. You're right. You know what? You're right, Blair. When you care about someone, it ruins everything.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, you are the one I care about here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh--",
        "Todd: You are. You're the only one I want.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. No, you want whoever's convenient. And I'm not convenient anymore.",
        "Todd: That's not what I want. That's not what you are to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no. No, no, no, no. We just need to admit there was never anything between us. Not really. Not really. Just like there was never anything between you and Blair. Right?",

        "Stacy: What now?",

        "Stacy: You know, Gigi, I'm gonna level with you. I never wanted Shane to suffer. But without Rex, I was suffering. Our deal was the only way to make things better for Shane and for me. Worked out pretty well, huh?",
        "Gigi: Yes. Enjoy it while you can.",
        "Rex: Is the coast clear?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. You had to give her the hard sell, huh?",

        "Clint: When did I ever do that?",
        "Bo: What do you call springing Dr. Evans on us without any warning?",
        "Clint: I felt I had to do that because you were just gonna turn me down. Now, what is going on here really, huh? Are you afraid that I might look good in Matthew's eyes?",
        "Bo: What, do you think I'm that petty? Do you think I would resent you helping my son to walk again?",
        "Clint: I think you resent me for more than you're saying.",

        "Bo: But I wanna hear what he has to say, okay? What do I resent you for, Clint?",
        "Clint: The very reason we're having this argument. You wouldn't be quite so defensive if I hadn't taken your place in Nora's life.",

        "Nora: We know you have.",
        "Clint: I have kept my distance. I've kept my opinions to myself. I have let you handle things as you see fit, despite the fact that I am a blood relative. I am Matthew's uncle. I am a part of this family! And if either one of you think that's overstepping, too bad. Soon I'm gonna be Nora's husband. I'm sure you'll be thinking I'm overstepping all over the place. Too bad.

        "Gigi: Yeah? His new doctor said there's no sign of the cancer coming back. But I got to say that, uh, hearing it from you today just made it real.",
        "Michael: Um, so listen. I know that this was all a setup, you know, but there still is the distinct possibility-- there always is the distinct possibility-- that the cancer could come back, all right? So we just need to be vigilant.",

        "Michael: Oh, please. You think I had any choice in the matter? When I told Marcie what we were doing out here, she said, \"Well, Michael, you just don't come back to Seattle until you kick that skinny bitch's butt.\"",

        "Shane: Much, much worse. She has sores all over her body and has the power to make people itch themselves to death. But no one sees her for what she is because she stole magic water from the fountain of youth and is using it to pretend that she's beautiful, when really...",
