        "Todd: Mmph! Oh!",
        "Dorian: Todd just peeled out of the driveway like he was in the Indy 500. What makes that man drive-- why does the cabana look like this? Blair, I asked you a question.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and I hear you.",
        "Dorian: What, may I ask, has been going on here?",
        "Blair: I slept with Todd in this cabana, okay? Why don't you deal with it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a! T\u00e9a, get down here. I need to talk to you.",
        "Shaun: How was your dip?",
        "Todd: Where is she?",
        "Shaun: Out.",
        "Todd: Out where?",
        "Shaun: That's on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. Don't give me that crap. Just tell me where she is.",
        "Shaun: I ain't telling, but she did pass along a message, though.",
        "Todd: And what would that be?",
        "Shaun: She said that you'd come here and that you would be storming through the house like a rabid dog--she got that right--and also she said it's none of your damn business where she is.",
        "Todd: She can't avoid me forever.",
        "Shaun: Oh, and she wanted me to tell you to drop dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gunshots]",
        "T\u00e9a: So annoying.",
        "John: Can I help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I'd give you a tissue if I had one.",
        "Destiny: It's okay. Nobody carries around tissues, except my grandma. She always keeps one tucked under her sleeve.",
        "Matthew: I really am sorry about your brother taking off.",
        "Destiny: Greg has got places to go, people to save, so fine. We don't need him in this stupid town, anyway.",
        "Matthew: I kind of did.",
        "Destiny: I know. I'm sorry. This whole thing sucks. I wish I could just order him to stay, not that he'd listen.",
        "Matthew: And if my parents said yes to the surgery, he wouldn't be going anywhere.",
        "Destiny: But even then, soon as it's over, he'd bolt. Greg doesn't care about me or my family. Shaun is right. All he cares about is himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: Hi there. Can I get you anything to drink?",
        "Rachel: Oh, I'm expecting someone. I'll just wait till they get here.",
        "Waitress: Okay. No worries.",
        "Greg: I guess that means I'm right on time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What's with the bag of blood, Stacy? Oh, I get it. You're one of those animal rights activists. You're just gonna toss that blood all over these fur coats, huh? Nah! Maybe the blood you've got is the same blood you've been passing off as your own again.",
        "Stacy: I don't know what you're talking--",
        "Rex: Shut up! Stacy, I know what you've done, you lying, evil bitch. Do you know who you are? Do you? You're a monster.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Hold on. Just take a couple steps back, all right? Obviously, this is just a big misunderstanding.",
        "Rex: Is that right?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, totally, really. I mean, I know it's weird I'm holding a bag of blood, but it's mine. See, the truth is, I'm a big wuss, and donating those stem cells was really, really hard, and I thought, \"What if Shane will need them again? I don't know if I'm gonna get myself to be able to go through this again,\" so I had the lab draw an extra bag of blood.",
        "Rex: Uh-huh, and just to keep it extra safe and secure, you stored it in a fur vault in a stranger's mink.",
        "Stacy: Well, I was worried that if you found out, you would judge me or something. I don't know. It's stupid.",
        "Rex: Yeah. It was.",
        "Stacy: But you believe me, right?",
        "Rex: It was stupid for you to think that I'd believe anything coming out of your mouth ever again.",
        "Stacy: Rex, I'm telling you the truth. This bag of blood can save Shane's life. We can talk about this on the way to the hospital. Come on. We've got to go, okay?",
        "Rex: We're not going anywhere.",
        "Stacy: Why?",
        "Rex: Shane isn't sick.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Rex: He's still in remission. Nothing is wrong with him. We all lied to you, and it worked. It got you to lead me right to this. Game over, Stacy.",
        "Stacy: You set me up? Why would you do that?",
        "Rex: I set you up? Are you nuts? You've nothing to say for what you did? You screwed with our lives. My son could've died because of you, and you're just worried about getting caught?",
        "Stacy: I can't believe you lied to me, you and Gigi and Shane.",
        "Rex: Michael, too. Everything we told you was a load of crap.",
        "Stacy: You pretended Shane was dying just to make me look like a horrible person?",
        "Rex: When my son was dying you blackmailed your sister about his life. You're a horrible person, Stacy. No. You're not a horrible person. You'd have to be human to be a horrible person. I know there can't be an answer to this question, but I'm gonna ask it anyway, Stacy. Why'd you do this?",
        "Stacy: I did it out of love... for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Hey, I saw you with your brother. I mean, he seems like he really cares about you.",
        "Destiny: All he cares about is his money and being a big man.",
        "Matthew: That's a little harsh.",
        "Destiny: He wouldn't even be in Llanview if it wasn't for your uncle paying him a boatload of cash to do your surgery, and your parents won't even let you have the surgery, so Greg is like, \"later.\" I'm sorry. You don't need to be hearing about my problems right now. You've got enough going on.",
        "Matthew: Please. After everything you've done for me? You helped me pass the math final, and when Justin and Becca were being jerks to me, you had my back, and, I mean, you made me play the piano again, and you were the only person my age to come visit me at the hospital.",
        "Destiny: It was the right thing to do.",
        "Matthew: Come on. I'm not exactly A-list. I mean, I'm sure people gave you crap for it.",
        "Destiny: Look at this face. Does it look like the face of a person who cares what other people think?",
        "Matthew: See, that's what makes you so cool. You're, like, the best friend I've ever had. I'm really sorry you're upset.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Shaun is a lucky man, but I've got to tell my little brother it's not cool to keep a beautiful woman waiting.",
        "Rachel: I'm early.",
        "Greg: Well, I hope he gets here soon. I'm sure he'll want to say good-bye.",
        "Rachel: Good-bye?",
        "Greg: I've got a plane to catch.",
        "Rachel: Oh, leaving so quickly?",
        "Greg: Yeah. Your brother's surgery isn't happening. Your mom and Matthew's father think it's too risky.",
        "Rachel: Yeah. I heard.",
        "Greg: Yeah, so there's no point in my sticking around. It's a shame, though. I don't think they understand what a big mistake they're making.",
        "Rachel: How was it a mistake to want to keep their son alive?",
        "Greg: I would never advise a surgery if I didn't feel confident that I could bring Matthew through it.",
        "Rachel: Confidence isn't a guarantee, and when you're talking about a son's life, guarantees are what you need.",
        "Greg: So, you're willing to see your brother confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life?",
        "Rachel: If it's between that and not seeing him at all, yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Take that filthy thing to a dump, one that will allow you to burn it.",
        "Handyman: Yeah, yeah. You bet, Dr. Lord.",
        "Second Handyman: Whatever you say, ma'am.",
        "Blair: Come on. Is that really necessary?",
        "Dorian: I'm having the entire cabana fumigated. You and Todd again? I mean, the man has lied to you, deceived you, dragged you through every court.",
        "Blair: Okay, okay. That is enough.",
        "Dorian: What is it that keeps you so attached to him? Oh, never mind. He's Mount Everest. He's there. He's a summit you have to climb.",
        "Blair: Okay. You know, actually, that part has never been a problem, all right?",
        "Dorian: So, was it worth it?",
        "Blair: Actually, yes, and not for reasons that you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I figured, \"how hard can it be? Point and shoot.\"",
        "John: Your aim is off. You're pulling to the left with your kickback.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine. How do I stop doing that?",
        "John: Just keep it steady. Support your wrist with your off hand.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thanks for the tip.",
        "John: Since when do they let civilians in here? I mean, last time I checked, you couldn't customize your target.",
        "T\u00e9a: I sweet-talked my way in, something I don't need much practice at...",
        "John: Right.",
        "T\u00e9a: And the target, ahem, I just needed a focal point.",
        "John: Well, targets with Manning's face on it could be a growth industry in this town. I think I used to have a dartboard.",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't think you were the type, John.",
        "John: I'm not. Marty gave it to me as a gift.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: All right. Tell me where she is.",
        "Shaun: Nope.",
        "Todd: You know, you work for me, not her.",
        "Shaun: She said that you'd tell me that, too.",
        "Todd: Such bull. Give me that thing.",
        "Shaun: No can do. You hired me to protect T\u00e9a against anybody who might mess with her, and right now, that'd be you.",
        "Todd: All right. Can you at least tell me when she'll be back?",
        "Shaun: She didn't say. She did pass along a message, though. She wants me to tell you that meeting you was the worst thing that could've ever happened to her, that Todd Manning was, quote, \"the biggest mistake of my life.\" The lady seems real clear on what she thinks of you.",
        "Marty: Yeah, and for once, I agree with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: You don't mind if I have a seat.",
        "Rachel: Actually, yes.",
        "Greg: No, but I'd like you to understand my side of this.",
        "Rachel: I think I do. I mean, it must be disappointing to come all the way to Llanview and not collect that exorbitant fee of yours.",
        "Greg: I have a waiting list of patients who would happily pay my fee. I came here to help your brother, to give him a chance to walk again.",
        "Rachel: And risk his life in doing that. Why don't you understand why my family said no?",
        "Greg: Because this operation would get him out of this chair to give him a real life.",
        "Rachel: He has a real life, thank you, chair or no chair.",
        "Greg: Well, he doesn't agree.",
        "Rachel: What if this was your brother? Would you want Shaun to take the chance that you're asking Matthew to take? Or maybe you would. Maybe Shaun is right. Maybe family just isn't that important to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What are you doing here?",
        "Marty: I went to Blair's first, but I pulled in the driveway, and you were screeching out at about 90. Nice hair, by the way.",
        "Todd: What do you want?",
        "Marty: I need a minute with Mr. Manning, please.",
        "Shaun: He's all yours. I'm late to meet someone.",
        "Todd: Can I get you anything?",
        "Marty: Can you get me something? How about my freedom from you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: It was either this or take a kickboxing class. I'm mad as hell.",
        "John: Never a good thing to pick up a gun when you're mad as hell.",
        "T\u00e9a: Give me a break, John. You've never come in here to just blow off some steam?",
        "John: No, never.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles]",
        "John: I just went back on the force, so I need to re-qualify.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm, and that's it? There's nothing else pushing you to the edge?",
        "John: Nope.",
        "T\u00e9a: Still seeing Marty?",
        "John: Some.",
        "T\u00e9a: Some. How's that working out for you?",
        "John: Fine.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd is not creating problems between you?",
        "John: Did I say there was a problem?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you didn't have to. After what Todd did to Marty in college, you don't get over that ever, and now the two of them have a grandchild together. They're connected forever.",
        "John: It's complicated.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Makes what he did to me seem like nothing, even after today.",
        "John: Yeah. Well, Manning finds a way to outdo himself.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. He slept with another woman, and, of course, I walked in on it.",
        "John: Were you really surprised?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you would've been surprised, too, John.",
        "John: Why's that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because the woman Todd Manning was having sex with was your wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Blair, what good can possibly come of having sex with Todd?",
        "Blair: It pissed T\u00e9a off so much--oh, my God, Dorian--her head was about to explode when she saw us.",
        "Dorian: She saw you? What?",
        "Blair: She saw it. She walked in.",
        "Dorian: How can you demean yourself with Todd? Let T\u00e9a have him.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. He still wants me, and now she knows all about it.",
        "Dorian: So what?",
        "Blair: Oh, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: May I ask how this disgusting incident happened?",
        "Blair: Well, it's actually kind of a long story, but it started this morning. We were having a lovely family breakfast--Todd, me, and the kids--just, you know, very peaceful, which is rare. T\u00e9a comes up with this lame excuse to come over there, and then Todd starts slobbering all over her, and we kind of have a fight. We bring it out here with bathing suits and all, and then--I don't know--the next thing you know, we're in there having sex, and that's about it.",
        "Dorian: You're leaving something very important out.",
        "Blair: Dorian, there is nothing else to say.",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes, there is. You're still in love with that man, aren't you?",
        "Blair: Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You actually think what you did was out of love?",
        "Stacy: How can you say that? I'd risk anything just to be with you.",
        "Rex: Even my son, your nephew.",
        "Stacy: No. No, no. You have it twisted, okay, which I know is my sister's fault. That bitch got you--",
        "Rex: Don't you ever use that word about Gigi again.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Okay.",
        "Rex: You give me one good reason why I shouldn't strangle the last lying breath out of you, Stacy. You talk about love. I have never hated anybody more than I hate you right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: That's a low blow. Look. I love my family.",
        "Rachel: Really? Is that why you're leaving?",
        "Greg: Look. You can skip the lecture, okay? Thanks. I've already heard it from my sister.",
        "Rachel: Destiny idolizes you. Can't you see that?",
        "Greg: All I know is, you both have given me some choice words here. You implied that I came here to pocket some money and pump my ego.",
        "Rachel: Oh, I didn't imply it. I flat out said it.",
        "Greg: Well, and then Destiny accused me of trying to buy her off with fancy gifts, thought I gave her that phone so that she wouldn't be mad at me when I decided to leave here, but the truth is--",
        "Rachel: Yeah?",
        "Greg: Truth is, she was right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You ever look up to someone like they almost seem perfect?",
        "Matthew: Sure.",
        "Destiny: That's how it was with my brother. He taught me stuff.",
        "Matthew: Like what?",
        "Destiny: Well, he liked music from back in the day, like Stevie Wonder. One night, I got scared during a thunderstorm, and he played \"Isn't She Lovely\" for me. Forgot all about the thunder. He used to call me his little boo.",
        "Matthew: That's nice, I guess.",
        "Destiny: Then he just left, forgot all about little boo. Shaun tried to tell me what a jerk Greg was, but I didn't believe it, kept defending him like a fool.",
        "Matthew: You're not a fool. You wanted your brother to act like a brother.",
        "Destiny: He used to. Then he graduated from med school, thought he was all that. Then he kept coming up with lame excuses why he couldn't see me. \"Sorry, Destiny. I have a conference. Sorry, Destiny, but here's a fancy cell phone to keep you quiet.\"",
        "Matthew: He got you a phone?",
        "Destiny: I gave it back. I don't need it, and I don't need him.",
        "Matthew: I'm sorry. I wish I could fix this for you.",
        "Destiny: Why? I can't fix your situation.",
        "Matthew: Well, you tried. You hungry? Let's go get some burgers.",
        "Destiny: With fries?",
        "Matthew: I think I can cover that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: That's it? No response? I just told you that the man you hate more than anyone in the world had sex with Blair. You remember Blair, the woman that you are married to. Any, uh, thoughts? Any comments? Any feelings, John?",
        "John: Step back.",
        "[Gunshots]",
        "[Shell casings clatter]",
        "T\u00e9a: [Exhales]",
        "John: Does that answer your question?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: For heaven's sake, would you like to tell me how in the world you and Todd ended up in the sack together?",
        "Blair: Uh, well, maybe because I was flirting with the guy that I hired to give the kids swimming lessons, you know, that really good-looking guy at the club.",
        "Dorian: The one built like an Olympic champion?",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, he has gold medal written all over him.",
        "Dorian: And that's what made you want to have sex with Todd?",
        "Blair: Well, I was kind of making out with him.",
        "Dorian: With Todd or the swim instructor?",
        "Blair: Swim instructor, Dorian. Todd got bent out of shape about it, and he just kicked him out.",
        "Dorian: The fight you were referring to earlier.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and then, you know, things just kind of happened.",
        "Dorian: Revenge sex.",
        "Blair: It was just sex. Are you happy now?",
        "Dorian: No. I am not happy. I'm not happy at all, and I don't think you are, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, really, because it seems to me that you've been free of me for some time now.",
        "Marty: Physically, maybe, but mentally, it's a different story. You're still in my head, Todd, and I want you out.",
        "Todd: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Marty: I'm trying to move on with my life and be happy--ha!--for once with John, and I can't because of you.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry. I can't change what I did to you.",
        "Marty: I'm not talking about what happened in college. I'm talking about last year. You made me fall in love with you, you son of a bitch, and it seems I can't forget it.",
        "Todd: So, are you saying that you're still in love with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Don't say that you hate me. What we have is amazing, Rex. We're meant to be together. You're just mad right now.",
        "Rex: Oh, my God, you seriously don't get it, do you? Do you see the way I'm looking at you right now? You make me sick.",
        "Stacy: You're just guilty. You feel guilty about us making love. That's it.",
        "Rex: There's something seriously wrong with you. You have no idea the hell you put me and my family through.",
        "Stacy: I could be your family, okay? You're my whole world. I love you more than Gigi, more than Shane. Don't you see that? We're meant to be together. This is fate.",
        "Rex: Did you not hear me? I said you make me want to puke.",
        "Stacy: No. You want me, Rex. You feel something for me. I know you do.",
        "Rex: What we had in that moment was based on lies.",
        "Stacy: No. No. You took care of me, and I cooked for you. We laughed together. That was real.",
        "Rex: You told Gigi that you would let Shane die unless she ditched me. You made me think that I had lost her. You broke me down so much and got into my bed when I was at my lowest. Is that the best you could hope for?",
        "Stacy: No. You're the best I could hope for. I would do anything. I just want you. I thought that since the day you stood up for me when those kids were picking on me.",
        "Rex: Okay. That was a million years ago. We were teenagers.",
        "Stacy: No. I dropped all my most personal things--my diary, my tampons--and there you were, the most popular guy, and you didn't care. You just picked them up, and you put them in my bag for me, and you just gave me the sweetest smile.",
        "Rex: I don't know how to tell you this, Stacy, but I don't remember anything from that day. I barely remember you from back then.",
        "Stacy: Well, maybe you do somewhere. Maybe it's just all pent up, Rex. You threw me on the floor at ultra violet, and you wanted me so bad, you even said it, and I know you're gonna want me again. I know the truth, Rex. You don't hate me. You want me. You don't love Gigi. You love me.",

        "Rachel: Look. It may be none of my business, but giving a kid a lovely parting gift isn't the same thing as being in her life.",
        "Greg: You want to judge me? Go for it, but you have no idea how much I love my family. I would do anything for Destiny and for Shaun.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, as long as it doesn't interfere with your schedule.",
        "Greg: I have a career, a responsibility. I can't just tell my patients, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all booked up right now. You'll just have to deal with being an invalid.\"",
        "Rachel: Is that what it is? Or maybe it's your need to keep up your golden-boy image.",
        "Greg: It has nothing to do with image. Look. Knowing that I can help these people, that's what gets me out of bed every morning.",
        "Rachel: Well, then it seems as if you are torn between what you're trying to achieve and your family. If they really matter to you the way you say they do, maybe you should try fixing things with them.",
        "Shaun: What's this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm almost afraid to ask this question, but did you have sex with Todd because you knew T\u00e9a would walk in on you?",
        "Blair: No, but, I'm telling you, it was just pure luck it happened. Well, it serves her right. She shows up at Starr's wedding. She comes over here and ruins my morning bragging about how she's sharing a bed with Todd.",
        "Dorian: Well, that's nothing for either one of you to brag about.",
        "Blair: She told a whole courtroom full of people something that I told her in confidence.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that nauseating bit about Todd being the love of your life.",
        "Blair: All right. You know what? She's the one that said all of that. I just-- I agreed to it. Anyway, he runs off now every night to be with her, and, you know, what am I supposed to do, just sit here and act like it's okay and be happy about that as she goes on about how their relationship is all meaningful and how they cuddle? I mean, ugh. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, okay, and if that's immature, well, then fine. That's who I am.",
        "Dorian: You felt like you lost your power, so you slept with Todd to get it back.",
        "Blair: That's sick.",
        "Dorian: Hmm, yes, but it makes sense in a sick kind of way. You don't want Todd, but you don't want anybody else to have him.",

        "T\u00e9a: Was it good for you?",
        "John: It's your turn.",
        "T\u00e9a: You expect me to do what you just did, forget it. I'm not a trained professional.",
        "John: Bend your knees a little bit. Aim just below where you want to hit. Allow for a slight upkick.",
        "T\u00e9a: If the target was wearing a belt, you know where I'd be aiming.",
        "John: All right. When you're ready, just breathe and squeeze.",

        "Todd: Are you? Are you still in love with me?",
        "Marty: No. Ha ha! In love with you? Oh, my God, don't flatter yourself.",
        "Todd: What are you doing here?",
        "Marty: Well, I got this problem because I can't-- I doubt everything I feel now. I can't trust myself because you ruined me, Todd, once with violence and once with love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Not only do I not love you, I never did.",
        "Stacy: No. That's a lie, Rex. You made love to me.",
        "Rex: That wasn't love. It was sex from somebody who was lying to me. Do you have any idea how much that makes me hate you? I've known some people who have done some really horrible things, but what you did, you had your sister scared to death for months with nobody to comfort her. You toyed with Shane's life, and that wasn't enough. Somehow, you dragged my mother into this, and you say it was all out of love.",
        "Stacy: Rex, you took me in. You said yourself, \"I don't know what I would do without you, Stace.\"",
        "Rex: No, no, without this, which I thought was yours. I thought you were saving my son's life.",
        "Stacy: But what about the money you gave me to save me from Stan? Why would you do that if you didn't love me?",
        "Rex: He beat the hell out of you. I would've done that for anybody.",
        "Stacy: You got to know me. You said you wanted to be with me. You know you did.",
        "Rex: I thought my son was dying. Do you have any idea how crazy that makes a person? Probably not because you have never for one second thought about anybody but yourself. It doesn't matter what I said before. I just want to make this clear. I have zero--you got it?--Zero love for you. Yes. All the time we spent together, I was in love with one woman, and that's Gigi.",
        "Stacy: No, Rex. She messed with your head. Don't you get that? If what you guys had was so strong, then why was I able to blow it apart so easy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Your brother here was just telling me that he's leaving town.",
        "Shaun: You are?",
        "Rachel: My mother and Bo decided not to put Matthew through the surgery.",
        "Shaun: I see. So, what's to keep you here now? Mom and Pop are planning a big dinner, you're going to call from the airport and tell them the guest of honor can't make it, and what about Destiny?",
        "Greg: Do you want me to answer that?",
        "Shaun: You always like having the last word. Why not have it now?",
        "Greg: I'm not leaving. I've decided to stay in Llanview for a little while longer.",
        "Destiny: Come again?",
        "Greg: I'm staying in Llanview.",
        "Destiny: Yeah. I heard that part. Why?",
        "Matthew: Did my parents change their mind about the surgery?",
        "Rachel: No, Matthew. They didn't.",
        "Greg: No, and I'm sorry about that, but the thing that's keeping me here is my family.",
        "Shaun: Family. Since when have we ever been a part of your life, Greg?",
        "Greg: Since two very wise females gave me a good talking to.",
        "Destiny: But what about your job, those people who need you?",
        "Greg: I've got a few colleagues who can take over my cases. I'll make it work, but right now, I'd really like to spend some time with my little sister. Is that cool with you?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. I guess it's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't know what you want me to do. I simply can't change the past. Do you want me to tell you that I'm sorry for loving you? I can't say that, really, because of all the things that I'm sorry for, that's not one of them.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Oh, you don't know how to love anyone, Todd. You just damage people like me. It's why I wanted to see you die, but John saved you so I wouldn't have to live with that. He did that for me, and now I can't be with him because of you.",
        "Todd: Well, I am sorry.",
        "Marty: Don't. Just don't because there's nothing you could say. Why do I waste my breath? Why? I should know by now. Doesn't change anything.",
        "Todd: Marty, Marty, you know, if I could fix things with you, I would. So many things I'd like to fix-- with you, T\u00e9a.",
        "Marty: T\u00e9a? What did you do to T\u00e9a?",
        "Todd: I slept with Blair, and she walked in and saw us.",
        "Marty: You're unbelievable.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I thought I could smooth things over, but--",
        "Marty: You can't stop yourself, can you? You are-- it's, like, textbook. Any psychiatrist would have a field day with you.",
        "Todd: And what about you? Why don't you tell me what you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What we have is real, Rex. I'm not willing to throw it away.",
        "Rex: You're not willing? Are you out of your-- there's no we to throw away. We are not real.",
        "Stacy: I'm really starting to worry about you, Rex. You're just not thinking clearly. I mean, whatever it is you're going through, we can work through this together.",
        "Rex: You're certifiable. You know that, Stacy?",
        "Stacy: What do you want, Rex? I'll do anything.",
        "Rex: I don't want anything from you ever, nothing. Got it?",
        "Stacy: Good. Then you don't want this, either.",
        "Rex: Stacy, come on. Give that back to me.",
        "Stacy: And why should I?",
        "Rex: There's no point to this. It's over.",
        "Stacy: So, then I lose everything. How come I always have to be the one who loses?",
        "Rex: We didn't have anything.",
        "Stacy: That's a lie. What we had was wonderful. You destroyed that. Maybe I should return the favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: So, what do you say, little bro? Think we could start over?",
        "Shaun: Sure.",
        "Destiny: Mom and Dad are gonna be so psyched. Hey, maybe we can have a big family barbeque on Sunday like we used to. I'll be right back.",
        "Shaun: You want to go talk to your brother?",
        "Rachel: No. I think your sister has got it covered.",
        "Destiny: Hey, Matthew, wait up.",
        "Matthew: I called Nigel. He's coming to pick me up.",
        "Destiny: Why?",
        "Matthew: I've got stuff to do, but listen. I mean, I'm really happy for you. You thought your brother was leaving, but now he's not, so that's pretty cool.",
        "Destiny: Doesn't change things for you. I wish it did.",
        "Matthew: Yeah. Me, too. I mean, if I was 18, I wouldn't need my parents to make a decision for me. I would tell your brother to do the surgery tomorrow.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, Matt, how are you?",
        "Matthew: Good. How are you?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm on the mend. Ha ha!",
        "Destiny: I'm Destiny.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi.",
        "Destiny: You're a lawyer, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh.",
        "Destiny: I'd like to hire you. Actually, Matt would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well, that's all I'm going to say in the matter...",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm sure you'll think of something very soon.",
        "Dorian: And, you know, if you ever think of sleeping with Todd again, take a cold shower. Eat chocolate. Put a rubber band on your wrist and then snap it. Do something, anything else. I'm sorry, honey. I really do think it's a shame that things didn't work out with you and John.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Well, you know, he's not the marrying type.",
        "Dorian: Hmm, he was willing to do that so that you wouldn't lose your children.",
        "Blair: He was willing, but he wasn't able. He's in love with Marty Saybrooke, but not me.",
        "Dorian: Huh. Well, that I will never understand, never.",
        "Blair: Me, either. Me, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You really expect me to stand here and analyze your personality?",
        "Todd: Why not? You're an expert, right?",
        "Marty: Did you hear anything I said to you?",
        "Todd: Yeah, every word, so why not listen to me?",
        "Marty: What a narcissist.",
        "Todd: Okay. There you go. Tell me about that. Tell me why I keep ruining everyone's lives all the time, including yours. Go ahead. Shrink me.",
        "Marty: A narcissist, Todd, is someone who has no concept of the feelings of others, and as far as what motivates you, maybe you should try to figure that out because one day, you're gonna have to explain everything you've done to our granddaughter Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You really made Destiny's evening telling her you're staying in Llanview.",
        "Greg: Well, it's a start.",
        "Rachel: She wants her big brother around.",
        "Greg: Yeah. She the only one?",
        "Shaun: I'll let you know in a couple of months if you're still here. Sorry.",
        "Greg: Seems I've got a lot to make up for.",
        "Shaun: It's not like you aren't trying. Just can't do it all in one night.",
        "Greg: I still owe you and Destiny a nice dinner.",
        "Shaun: So, you're treating us to green chili burgers at Buenos Dias?",
        "Greg: No. I thought we'd go back to the Palace.",
        "Shaun: Right now?",
        "Greg: Sure. Why not? You haven't ordered yet. Oh, unless you two would rather be alone.",
        "Rachel: Uh, no. It's okay.",
        "Shaun: We have a date.",
        "Rachel: We can do it some other time. You should really spend time with your brother and sister.",
        "Greg: Actually, I was hoping that you'd join us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Please, Stacy. This isn't about you and me. This is about Shane, your nephew.",
        "Stacy: Someone else you love more than me.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and you love him, too, and he needs that blood. It might be the only thing that can save him.",
        "Stacy: He doesn't need saving, remember? You lied to me. He's fine.",
        "Rex: This checkup was good, but what if there's one that isn't? What happens then? The donor is dead. We can't find another one. All we have is that blood. We're talking about Shane's life.",
        "Stacy: Yeah. It's torture, isn't it, to want something so bad and to see somebody else get it, someone who doesn't Deserve it as much as you do, who's just gonna throw it away.",
        "Rex: Stacy, please don't do this.",
        "Stacy: It hurts so bad. When you finally get something that you've always wanted, you're gonna hang on to it. You're gonna do anything you can to keep it. Wouldn't you?",
        "Rex: What do you want me to do?",
        "Stacy: Make love to me again."
