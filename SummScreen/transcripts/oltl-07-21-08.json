        "While it looks like Viki has died in the car crash, she finds herself talking to people in the \"afterlife.\" Her deceased infant granddaughter, Megan is now a young woman. She is Viki's guide. Viki meets Asa. She also hears from Niki Smith (who goes wherever Viki goes) that she is taking care of Viki, and Tess is taking care of Jessica. Viki also meets her deceased husband, Ben. Dorian also sees a \"ghost.\" Mel comes back from the dead and tells her he knows all she's been up to and that she must atone. Meanwhile, Rex and Bo get \"rescued\" by the Texas ranch hands. But they find themselves living in 1968. Bo is Asa. Rex is Bo. And they wonder what they are going to do with their present situation. In Mendorra, Carlo Hesser tells Tina and Cristian they must watch Sarah go over the waterfall in a raft and there is nothing either will be able to do about it."

        "Dorian: This isn't my fault. I wasn't even --",
        "Mel: I'm not talking about that, Dorian. You drugged Viki's boyfriend and poured a fifth of vodka down his throat. You know what a terrible time I had staying off the booze. And you do to this kid what? When he's doing everything he possibly can to stay away from the booze, you pour it down his throat. It's obscene, girl.",
        "Dorian: It was necessary. I had a really huge deal riding on his silence.",
        "Mel: Well, then why didn't you just shoot him? After all, you are Dorian Lord. You deserve whatever you get. I'm sure the jury would be most understanding. After all, it's you.",
        "Dorian: I hate it when you're sarcastic.",
        "Mel: I hate it when you demean yourself by hurting other people. You preyed on that man's weakness.",

        "Dorian: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Mel: You don't care about Buchanan Enterprises or Cramer Enterprises -- whatever you call it. That was a little coup you pulled to hurt Clint, to hurt Clint for hurting you.",
        "Dorian: And he was supposed to walk away unscathed?",
        "Mel: What were you doing with Clint Buchanan anyway?",
        "Dorian: What was I supposed to do? Throw myself on a funeral pyre just because you were -- gone?",
        "Mel: No. You're supposed to find yourself a warm, compassionate guy with a decent sense of humor and try and let him make you happy.",
        "Dorian: You're a very difficult man to replace.",
        "Mel: It's not about me, is it? Because you're doing it again, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: What are you talking about?",

        "Viki: I'm so sorry about B.E.",
        "Asa: I've got Clint working on it. The boy turned out to have a real knack for getting things done. He reminds me of --",
        "Asa: Of me.",
        "Viki: That's what I'm afraid of.",
        "Asa: What's that supposed to mean?",

        "Rex: Okay, if this isn't heaven where the hell are we?",
        "Bo: We're at the ranch.",
        "Rex: And it's 1968.",
        "Bo: Well, let's -- let's start with what we do know. You're Rex, I'm Bo.",
        "Rex: And I came down here to stop you from taking a certain ride, which you took, and here we are. Delphina was right. This is a serious disaster.",
        "Bo: Well, it could be worse.",
        "Rex: How?",

        "Rex: Little brother?",
        "Jared: [As Man] You're growing, but you still got a ways to go. Ain't that right, Pa?",
        "Bo: Balsom?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa: Everything Clint did was for his family. I don't want you or anybody saying anything against him.",
        "Asa: What are you smiling about?",
        "Viki: I've missed you and your temper.",
        "Asa: Well, I missed your stubborn, uppity --",
        "Asa: Think-you-always-know-best -- beautiful face. Don't you worry. Everything is going to be all right.",
        "Viki: Thank you, Asa.",

        "Mel: You're such a terrific woman in so many ways.",
        "Dorian: Time out here. Did you come back in order to lecture me? Because if you did, you wasted a day pass.",
        "Mel: Why are you so insecure?",
        "Dorian: Me? Insecure?",
        "Mel: Yes, you. You liked Charlie Banks.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Mel: Come on, admit it.",
        "Dorian: He had a little rough charm.",
        "Mel: He was kind to you after Alex Olanov ran you down. You invited him back to Llanview, and you wanted to put him up in that pile of bricks you call -- what? La poum-bai-yay.",
        "Dorian: La Boulaie. That was before I found out that Viki wanted to realize her lifelong dream of being a waitress.",
        "Mel: And when you found out he was interested in Viki you got scared. You couldn't pursue him, because what if you lost? So instead of taking a risk you tried to destroy the man. Not your finest hour, my love.",

        "Viki: Because our lives have changed now. I know you feel that everything has been pulled out from underneath you, and you're terrified, but I think that I can help you now.",
        "Megan: I don't need your help, Viki, I don't want your help. I don't want your friendship.",

        "Megan: Because she wanted you to remember what it was like to love someone and have them turn you down.",
        "Viki: Why?",
        "Megan: So you could think about it, maybe give them another chance. You've made mistakes. People have forgiven you. I mean, can't you do the same for him?",
        "Viki: You're talking about Charlie.",
        "Megan: For all his lies, weren't there just as many sweet and tender moments? For all his cowardice, wasn't he brave? For all the pain, wasn't there just as much love? You asked Aunt Megan to give you another chance, and eventually she did. Can't you give Charlie one?",
