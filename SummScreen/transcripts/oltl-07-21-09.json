        "Langston and Markko are wondering how they are going to see each other while he stays at Viki's and she stays at Dorian's. Starr and Cole have similar concerns regarding the fact that he must go undercover and not tell her where he's going to be staying. Cristian goes looking for information about Fish. He runs into Brody who tell him maybe he shouldn't trust what Kyle Lewis says. Meanwhile, Fish is indicating to Layla that he wants the \"idea\" of being with her. But in reality, he may be gay. Gigi and Stacy have a confrontation and Stacy falls down the stairs of the parking garage. Rex confronts Roxy for covering up the secret for Stacy. And he concludes that he bets that his biological father would have to have bean the donor for Shane and that is why his mother couldn't tell him anything about the situation."

        "Starr: Can you believe that Uncle Markko told off his daddy and then ran upstairs with Auntie Langston?",
        "Langston: Yeah. It was such a scene: Dorian and her mea culpa.",
        "Starr: I can't believe Markko's dad wasn't impressed.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? He kicked Markko out of the house.",
        "Starr: Where's he gonna go?",
        "Langston: You didn't hear? For now he's gonna be staying at your Aunt Viki's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Charlie, the steak was wonderful.",
        "Markko: Yeah, it was really good.",
        "Charlie: Well, thank you.",
        "Viki: Grill master! One of the many reasons I'm marrying you, by the way. Markko, salad?",
        "Markko: No, no. Um, but thank you. Everything was really delicious.",
        "Viki: Good. Sit, sit, sit. You don't have to do that.",
        "Markko: Oh, yeah, yeah, I think I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Kyle, are you there?",
        "Brody: Can I help you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Look, I was just--",
        "Layla: I don't want to hear it! I said don't tell anyone at the station that we're dating. I said I didn't want people thinking I got the job because you're a cop!",
        "Oliver: I know.",
        "Layla: Well, so why did you just announce to the entire station that I'm your girlfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: It's really over?",
        "Rex: Stem cells are in the cooler.",
        "Gigi: And Stacy knows that's it? She's busted?",
        "Rex: Don't worry about Stacy. She's not an issue anymore.",
        "Gigi: How did you get the stem cells away from her?",
        "Rex: I caught her red-handed. Look, all that matters now is that Shane is safe and you and I are back together again.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God!",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: I totally forgot I have to work tonight.",
        "Rex: Call in sick.",
        "Gigi: I can't: Brody's off. Unless you can't stay with Shane?",
        "Rex: It's okay. I will get the stem cells into cold storage, take Shane home, get him fed.",
        "Gigi: You'll be there when I get home?",
        "Rex: Where else would I be?",
        "Gigi: And you'll wait up?",
        "Rex: Count on it. You have your keys?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Ah. Okay. You're next, Gigi.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God.",

        "Langston: I think your Aunt Viki felt bad for hanging Dorian out to dry.",
        "Starr: Yeah. After saying no to the dinner party?",
        "Langston: Yeah. She was probably just trying to make up for it. But, still, that's got to be kind of weird for Markko.",
        "Starr: Well, why? My Aunt Viki likes helping people. Gigi and Shane have stayed in the carriage house for months. And whenever David comes to visit, he usually stays in the west wing.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but Markko barely knows them. And, plus, with everything that's been going on with his parents, he must feel like--I don't know--a refugee. I mean, we had sex one time, and this is what happens.",
        "Starr: Uh, no. This little girl is what happens after having s-e-x one time.",
        "Langston: Do you know how long it's been since Markko and I have been together? 2 months.",
        "Starr: Try waiting a year and a half, and then talk to me.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Starr: Ha ha ha ha!",
        "Cole: What's so funny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Cleaning up is the least I can do. You've been so nice taking me in. You don't even know me.",
        "Viki: Listen, we all know what it's like to need a place to stay, okay? Besides, this gives us a chance to get to know you. You're the class valedictorian, aren't you, and a filmmaker.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Really? Maybe you can help me figure out how to use my new camcorder. I'm trying to make these videos of Bree to send to Nash's parents, and there's all these menus.",
        "Markko: Yeah. Sure. No problem.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Thanks.",
        "Viki: You done?",
        "Charlie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Viki: Who's for ice cream?",
        "Charlie: You have to ask?",
        "Jessica: Oh, not me. Um, Aunt Natalie and Uncle Jared are playing babysitter, so I should go. Thanks, Charlie, for dinner.",
        "Viki: You do this very, very well.",
        "Markko: Well, it's almost 2 years working at the diner.",
        "Viki: Do you enjoy it?",
        "Markko: The food is good and the people are nice.",
        "Viki: I enjoyed my time as a waitress.",
        "Charlie: I did, too.",
        "Viki: Markko? I really appreciate you helping out. I mean it because it's Lois' bowling night. But I want you to know something. This is a huge house. We have so much room. Please know that you're welcome to stay just as long as you'd like, okay?",
        "Markko: Thank you, Mrs. Davidson.",
        "Viki: No. \"Viki.\"",

        "Cristian: You work security here?",
        "Brody: No. I live here. I just-- I thought you might need a hand.",
        "Cristian: I was just looking for Kyle Lewis.",
        "Brody: Ah, the blackmailer.",
        "Cristian: Really?",
        "Brody: You don't read the papers? He tried to blackmail Natalie Buchanan. His sister was working with that serial killer.",
        "Cristian: What else do you know about this guy?",
        "Brody: That's not enough?",
        "Cristian: Good point. Look, uh, I don't know why I'm sharing this, but do you know Layla Williamson?",
        "Brody: Really pretty girl? Friends of Adriana's?",
        "Cristian: That's right--well, Adriana's my cousin. I'm Cristian Vega, by the way.",
        "Brody: Brody Lovett. Nice to meet you.",
        "Cristian: Good to meet you, too, man. Look, this is the thing. Layla--she's my roommate, and this guy Kyle told me that my other roommate--Fish, who's a cop --is using her. So--",
        "Brody: Using her how?",
        "Cristian: Well, that's what I'm here to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Okay. I told Manetti.",
        "Layla: And Keeton and Denby, who told Morrison and Katz.",
        "Oliver: It was bound to get around.",
        "Layla: But by then they would've gotten to know me, and that I deserved to have this job because I'm smart and organized!",
        "Oliver: Are you ashamed to be dating me?",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Oliver: Because it sounds like you don't want people to know that we're together.",
        "Layla: No! Of course not! You're a great guy!",
        "Oliver: Then what's the problem?",
        "Layla: Oliver, we agreed to keep our relationship under wraps.",
        "Oliver: Oh, to hide it, you mean?",
        "Layla: No, that's not what I mean. You keep putting words in my mouth!",
        "Oliver: Look, I don't see why this is such a big deal.",
        "Layla: Because I specifically asked you not to say anything. I just took a job where you work, and I don't want people thinking the only reason I got hired is because of you. And the fact that you can't hear that, it's starting to make me feel a little used.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Where's Shane? Why didn't you call? I had to find out he had a relapse from my hair colorist?",
        "Rex: Why would I call you?",
        "Roxy: \"Why would you call me?\" I'm his grandmother! What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Rex: Shane's fine.",
        "Roxy: Well, was it a false alarm like when he ate that junk food?",
        "Rex: No. This time he was faking.",
        "Roxy: Well, why would he pretend that he was sick? What the hell is going on?",
        "Rex: How about you tell me, Roxy? Why the hell would you team up with Stacy and risk your grandson's life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God. Oh, my--oh, my God. Oh--",
        "Stacy: Going somewhere?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I just met you. But maybe I don't have the whole story about Kyle Lewis, but he's bad news. And to get yourself all wound up on his say so--",
        "Cristian: Well, that's why I want to talk to him about it. He was pretty vague when he said Fish was using Layla, and he didn't say how or why.",
        "Brody: Did you bring this up with Fish?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah. He said that he and Kyle were frat brothers in college, but that's it. He also said that maybe Kyle was trying to start problems between Fish and Layla because Kyle wants a shot at Layla.",
        "Brody: But you don't buy it?",
        "Cristian: No, no. It was more like he was warning me about Fish and his history with women.",
        "Brody: But Layla doesn't have a problem with him?",
        "Cristian: No.",
        "Brody: So why do you care so much?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You feel I used you? How?",
        "Layla: To prove something to the guys?",
        "Oliver: Like what?",
        "Layla: I don't know--that you're a playa? You tell me. Why was it more important to impress the guys than to respect my feelings?",
        "Oliver: I can't be proud of you? Look at you. You're--you're gorgeous. Layla, you're the kind of girl that every guy dreams about, and you're dating me. I still can't wrap my head around that.",
        "Layla: But you're an amazing guy. You're smart and successful and funny and--",
        "Oliver: I am a tech geek. You should've seen me in high school.",
        "Layla: This isn't high school.",
        "Oliver: Don't kid yourself. You should hear the locker room talk at the precinct. It's beyond juvenile: You know, who's scoring? Who's not?",
        "Layla: But you're not like that.",
        "Oliver: Well, I have to be, or--",
        "Layla: Or what?",
        "Oliver: Or I won't survive there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Why would I hook up with that lying piece of--",
        "Rex: Just stop it! Roxy, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Stacy has been blackmailing Gigi for months, threatening to let Shane die if Gigi didn't break up with me.",
        "Roxy: What? Oh, no, that's terrible.",
        "Rex: Oh! And you knew all about it! You helped her!",
        "Roxy: Rex, wait--no, I swear I--",
        "Rex: No, no, don't. No swearing. No begging. No promising. It's over, Roxy. I know what Stacy did. She admitted it. What I don't get is why you helped her. Why did you help Stacy blow my family away to pieces?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You look scared, Geeg.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I'm scared: Somebody just trashed my car.",
        "Stacy: Aw, that's terrible. Now, why would anybody do such a thing?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. Maybe because she's jealous and selfish and evil.",
        "Stacy: I saw Rex first.",
        "Gigi: What are you? 6?",
        "Stacy: You can't just do whatever you want and get away with it. Take Rex and just go back to your perfect little life?",
        "Gigi: \"Perfect little life\"? Raising a kid for 10 years all alone?",
        "Stacy: You lied to me.",
        "Gigi: About what?",
        "Stacy: You told me Shane was sick.",
        "Gigi: He is sick! He has leukemia.",
        "Stacy: It's in remission!",
        "Gigi: And we want to keep it that way, not that you care. You were willing to let your own nephew die so you could get your hooks into a man who can't even stomach you.",
        "Stacy: He loves me.",
        "Gigi: Okay. Right. You hang onto that, Stacy. Because now that we have the stem cells and Rex and Shane know just how sick you are, it's over. There's nothing left for you here. So why don't you do yourself a favor and get out of town before we press charges?",
        "Stacy: If you think I'm just gonna crawl back to Vegas while you snuggle up with Rex, you are so wrong. You may have won the first round, sister, but I promise you-- the fun has only begun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Well, I'm not giving up Langston. I don't care what he does.",
        "Viki: Well, she seems like a lovely young woman.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I'm sure your dad will come around.",
        "Markko: I hope so. My mom got him to meet with this new priest--Father Diaz. He's young, progressive.",
        "Viki: It sounds very promising.",
        "Markko: My mom said she's gonna try to get my dad to call me so we can at least talk about it. So with a little luck, I could be out of your hair by tomorrow.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, Cole, when do you start community service?",
        "Cole: Uh, tomorrow.",
        "Langston: Do you know what you're gonna be doing?",
        "Cole: No. Not yet.",
        "Langston: Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it's a lot safer than prison. Well, um, I got to go. So bye. Oh, beautiful.",
        "Starr: Say hi to Markko for me.",
        "Langston: Yup.",
        "Starr: So did John tell you anything about your undercover assignment?",
        "Cole: He's setting me up in an apartment.",
        "Starr: What? You're getting your own apartment? That's great! Hope and I can move in and we can all live together!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Everybody likes you. Why are you so insecure?",
        "Oliver: I'm not insecure.",
        "Layla: Okay. Well, nervous about what the other guys might think?",
        "Oliver: No, it's--it's not that. Maybe it's--it's a guy thing. We're men. We're constantly testing each other, especially cops, and you just want to keep up, you know? You just want to be one of the guys.",
        "Layla: And what if you're not? What happens then?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: See, the thing is Layla has been jerked around by a couple of guys, including Fish. And if he's coming back for more, I want to know about it.",
        "Brody: You're looking out for her?",
        "Cristian: That's right.",
        "Brody: You know, I should go. I got some studying I got to do.",
        "Cristian: In school?",
        "Brody: Actually, I just got accepted into the police academy.",
        "Cristian: Oh? Right on, man. You gonna be a cop?",
        "Brody: Man, I hope so.",
        "Cristian: Cool. Good for you, man. Listen, maybe you can do me a favor. Maybe you can pull Fish's file and see if there's anything in there that's a little fishy?",
        "Brody: Yeah, those files are classified.",
        "Cristian: Right, right, right. Of course. Sorry. I didn't mean to try to drag you into this.",
        "Brody: Look, I know you say Layla's your friend, but I got to tell you. It seems like she means an awful lot to you. See you around.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Thanks.",
        "Brody: How'd you get in here?",
        "Jessica: Who? Me?",
        "Brody: Heh heh heh!",
        "Jessica: My boyfriend's a Navy Seal. He taught me a few tricks.",
        "Brody: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Stacy is a damn liar!",
        "Rex: Oh, is Natalie a liar? Your pal Kyle Lewis took Natalie and Jared to see Shane's real donor.",
        "Roxy: He couldn't.",
        "Rex: Oh, because the donor's dead? Why are you in this up to your eyeballs, Rox?",
        "Roxy: Listen, everything I did, I did for Shane. I even saved another bag of blood just in case he needed it. And I don't know who it was, but someone paid that psycho nurse to steal the blood. Is that it? Is that the blood? Stacy had it, didn't she? Oh, good. Oh, good. Then Shane's gonna be okay.",
        "Rex: You want to tell me why you've been lying to me all these weeks?",
        "Roxy: Because I would've done anything for Shane, anything at all. If he wanted my heart, I would've just cut it out and given it to him. I just--I felt bad because I wasn't a match.",
        "Rex: But you knew somebody who was?",
        "Roxy: Yes. I did, and I wanted to tell you. But then Stacy came to me and she said she wanted to be the hero. And I thought, well, you know, maybe it's okay. What harm would that do? I didn't know she would try to bust you up.",
        "Rex: And when you found out? Why didn't you tell me that Stacy wasn't the real donor?",
        "Roxy: I couldn't because it was too late and she was blackmailing me.",
        "Rex: With what: The name.",
        "Roxy: Whose name?",
        "Rex: The donor's.",
        "Roxy: The donor's dead!",
        "Rex: Who was it, Roxy? Who saved my son's life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You need help.",
        "Stacy: I need Rex.",
        "Gigi: Well, then you're in big trouble, because you're never gonna get him.",
        "Stacy: We'll see about that.",
        "Gigi: You honestly think that you have a chance with Rex after threatening his son's life?",
        "Stacy: He knows I would never let anything happen to Shane.",
        "Gigi: No, I don't think he does know that, Stacy. And I can tell you for a fact that he hates you for what you've done.",
        "Stacy: Well, he'll get over it. And when he does, you better look out, Geeg. Because when he's tired of eating burgers in front of the TV and 5 minutes of straight-up sex before you strap on your little waitress uniform and head out the door, he'll come back to me. Because if there's one thing I know for a fact is that when a man has a taste of what I have to offer, he always comes back.",
        "Gigi: Ha!",
        "Stacy: What's so funny?",
        "Gigi: You! I think that you're actually starting to believe your fantasies. That story about Rex having on the floor of ultra violet? That's about as true as what I said about me and Brody.",
        "Stacy: Well, I don't know what you and Brody got up to, but Rex and I shook the roof.",
        "Gigi: In your dreams.",
        "Stacy: Oh, I do dream about him every night.",
        "Gigi: And that's as close as you'll ever get.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, keep telling yourself that. I know what I know.",
        "Gigi: It never happened, Stacy. Rex told me you're lying.",
        "Stacy: And you believe him?",
        "Gigi: Over you? Oh!",
        "Stacy: Well, that just proves my point. If a man's gonna lie and be dishonest about what he's got going on with another woman, it's not over.",
        "Gigi: Why are you doing this to yourself?",
        "Stacy: You need to face the facts--that's your problem. Your dream life, your --your perfect family? That's your fantasy. Rex is bored. He wants me now.",
        "Gigi: You see yourself as this goddess, but you're nothing but a tramp, Stacy. Men run through you like traffic through a tunnel.",
        "Stacy: Well, listen up, Miss homemaker. You may bake a perfect muffin, but that's as far as it goes, and you know that. When was the last time that Rex asked you for anything more than a hug? When did he tear your clothes off because he just couldn't wait to have you? I had to walk home in just my coat because he ripped my clothes into shreds.",
        "Gigi: You're lying.",
        "Stacy: Well, I'd be happy to give you a blow-by-blow.",
        "Gigi: Oh!",
        "Stacy: Ugh!",
        "Gigi: Huh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Oh, we could put her to bed every single night if we lived together. We could do whatever we wanted. We could be a little family. Wouldn't that be amazing?",
        "Cole: Mm-hmm. I want that, too, but not like this.",
        "Starr: Oh. But why not? It doesn't have to be perfect. It'll be ours.",
        "Cole: But, Starr, it won't be me living there. It'll be whoever the cops want me to be. I can't have you and hope in the middle of all that. It's too dangerous. Besides, you know, you're all set up here. You've got your family, all the stuff you need for the baby. I mean, look. Look at all this stuff. It would take a moving truck to move her out of here.",
        "Starr: I just wish we could all be together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hey, Langston! Hi. Come on in.",
        "Langston: Oh, thank you. I hope it's okay that I came over.",
        "Viki: Yes, it's fine. Oh, honey, you're always welcome. Always. Well, Charlie and I have to have a very serious discussion about floral arrangements--in the library.",
        "Charlie: Oh, yeah. Um, those floral arrangements, yeah. Um, so you guys enjoy your ice cream.",
        "Markko: Thanks, Charlie.",
        "Langston: Hi! Oh--",
        "Markko: Oh, I've got to get out of here.",
        "Langston: Have you heard from your parents?",
        "Markko: My mom. She's working on my dad. Look, he better give in soon. I can't stay here.",
        "Langston: Look, I know it's weird, but they seem pretty cool about you staying here.",
        "Markko: Oh, they're great. But they're about to get married, and I'm just--I'm in the way.",
        "Langston: So come back to Dorian's.",
        "Markko: She said she doesn't want me.",
        "Langston: I can talk her into it.",
        "Markko: Sleeping under the same roof as you? I wouldn't get any sleep at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Keep it up, Cristian, you're gonna get arrested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: So what are you saying? I'm not one of the guys?",
        "Layla: No, of course not. But you're implying that if you're not bragging about me or some other woman, then the guys would think less of you.",
        "Oliver: No, I've been single for the last 8 months, and it was fine and nobody said anything. But now Morrison's getting married and Katz is dating this gymnast and--",
        "Layla: You just want to be one of the guys.",
        "Oliver: Is that so bad--to want what they have?",
        "Layla: No.",
        "Oliver: Look, I've wanted to be a cop for as long as I can remember. I love my job, and I'm really good at it, too. But you need more than a string of arrests. You got to fit in. So if I want to brag about my smart, sexy, beautiful, hotter-than-hot girlfriend once in a while--",
        "Layla: I guess I wish you didn't have to play those games.",
        "Oliver: Me, too. You have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Who was Shane's donor, Mom?",
        "Roxy: Look, I told Gigi to tell you the truth after Shane's transplant, and she was gonna do that. But then he got this stomach cramps, and then she got scared. And then I was gonna try again, and then you gave Stacy the flowers, and then Gigi showed up.",
        "Rex: The flowers were from Shane.",
        "Roxy: Right. And I told you she was nuts not to tell you the truth, but Gigi wouldn't do it.",
        "Rex: So this is Gigi's fault?",
        "Roxy: Well, I'm not saying that. The point is that I tried. And I didn't want to see the two of you broken up, and I hated Stacy for doing that.",
        "Rex: Forget Gigi. All you had to do was tell me that Stacy was playing me, that she wasn't the real donor.",
        "Roxy: I couldn't!",
        "Rex: Because she was blackmailing you?",
        "Roxy: Yes.",
        "Rex: What did she have on you, Roxy? What was so terrible that it was worth it to risk Shane's life and ruin mine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You stole my life, the man I love, my son. You made me break their hearts, and I will never, ever forgive you for that.",
        "Stacy: Like I care what you think.",
        "Gigi: You should! I'm your sister, Stacy! For you to treat me like this, I don't know what happened to you after you left home, what turned you into this monster. But you know what? I don't even care anymore. You're too far gone. You've got no soul, no conscience, no nothing!",
        "Stacy: I'm not afraid of you.",
        "Gigi: You should be.",
        "Stacy: Ugh--",
        "Gigi: Because you know what? Now that I know what you've turned into, it's only gonna make me stronger. You've threatened my family for the last time. You come anywhere near us again, and I swear to God I'll kill you.",

        "Starr: I don't mean to be pushy.",
        "Cole: You're not pushy.",
        "Starr: I just want us to live together in a place where there's no parents telling us what to do.",
        "Cole: We'll get there, but you have to graduate.",
        "Starr: You do, too.",
        "Cole: And I have to clear my record. John went way out on a limb for me. I can't let him down.",
        "Starr: Could we at least visit you?",
        "Cole: I don't want you anywhere near this.",
        "Starr: Maybe we should've gotten married.",
        "Cole: It's not like I'm shipping out.",
        "Starr: Feels like it.",
        "Cole: Okay. I should go.",

        "Markko: Sometimes I wish that we had never had sex.",
        "Langston: Why?",
        "Markko: Because then I wouldn't know what I was missing. God, I want you so much.",
        "Langston: Me, too.",
        "Viki: Oh--I'm sorry. Charlie forgot his glasses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So what do you do when you see a vehicle with a broken taillight? But I want to help you study.",
        "Brody: You will--after you tell me how you're doing.",
        "Jessica: I'm fine.",
        "Brody: How'd it go with Cole and Starr?",
        "Jessica: They were gracious and, um, honest. I'm glad I went. I saw Chloe--I saw Hope. Um, Starr offered to let me hold her, and it took everything in me not to just grab her and snatch her up. But I told her it probably wasn't a good idea.",
        "Brody: Why didn't you call me?",
        "Jessica: Because you're supposed to be studying.",

        "Layla: Yeah, I was thinking that.",
        "Oliver: Manetti's a player.",
        "Layla: Which only means he hasn't found a woman willing to date him more than once.",
        "Oliver: No, he's a good guy.",

        "Oliver: How do you know he has a hairy back?",
        "Layla: Oh, come on. Women know these things.",
        "Oliver: And if Cristian walks through the door?",
        "Layla: He's at work, and he won't be home for hours.",
        "Oliver: You know, maybe we should...",

        "Roxy: Rex, I'm telling you drop it. It's over.",
        "Rex: So just move on?",
        "Roxy: Yes! Move on! It's not gonna help sticking your nose into business where it doesn't belong!",
        "Rex: I need to know. I--I can't keep pretending that it doesn't matter you lied to me about everything that's important.",
        "Roxy: It's not true.",
        "Rex: Like my father's name? Why'd you kill him? Maybe I should just ask Stacy.",
        "Roxy: No!",
        "Rex: Because that's what she had on you, huh? She found out you murdered my father?",
        "Roxy: No, no, no. She doesn't know anything about it.",
        "Rex: But she knows who the donor was, right? And we all got tested because chances are the donor's related.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but that woman who was the donor from Australia? She wasn't related to you.",
        "Rex: But the donor was, right? Oh, my God.",
        "Roxy: What?",
        "Rex: You didn't kill my father. You just hid him in that nursing home. He was the man in bed. He was the donor. My father saved my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You? Kill me? You don't have the guts.",
        "Gigi: Try me. You could've made something out of yourself, Stacy. Could've made our parents proud.",
        "Stacy: Oh, don't worry. They were very proud, especially after you got knocked up. I was the only daughter they had left.",
        "Gigi: And look at you now: A stripper who threw herself at her sister's man. It's just sad.",
        "Stacy: Hmm. We'll see about that one.",
        "Gigi: Right. And you know what's funny? That you'd hang that polyester rag in a fur vault. But, then again, it's all real to you, isn't it?",
        "Stacy: Ooh, but did Rex tell you what happened in that fur vault? I confessed. I told him how much I loved him, how much I would do anything for him. And you know what? It turned him on. We did it right there on the floor.",
        "Gigi: Ha!",
        "Stacy: What do you have to say now, Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Ahem. You're a lot sicker than I thought?",
        "Stacy: Huh. Okay. Well, you know what? Let's go ask him. He's right downstairs in the E.R. Let's find out who the liar is, really.",

She's a great a girl and I want to be with her, so please back off. Whatever you think you know about me, it was a long time ago. I'm not that guy anymore. For both our sakes, get on with your life and stop messing with mine. Oliver.\"",

        "Roxy: I saved his life! I saved his life! If you got down on your hands and your knees and you begged, he wouldn't even help you. So I took blood from his stinking arm and I killed him. Have you got that? That is the truth! I swear! Are you happy?",
