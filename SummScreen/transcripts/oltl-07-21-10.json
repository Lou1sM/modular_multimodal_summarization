        "Todd and Tea tell Daniela that they are getting married and Daniela accepts it gracefully. Daniela goes to Dr Evans to ask him about new medications that might help her mother. When he tells her not to trust information she finds online, she tells him that he is being negative because he doesn't want them to find out that another doctor is better. Todd and Tea finally make love. Gigi receives an acceptance letter from Llanview University. John McBain overhears Eli discussing Ben Thompson. Eli follows Rex to Rodi's and eavesdrops on Rex and Gigi discussing whether they can afford for her to go to college. John intercepts Eli as he tries to follow Rex out of Rodi's. Charlie and Viki are disappointed that their plan to reconnect David and Dorian didn't work and that Dorian fired Charlie but decide it is a good opportunity to take a vacation. They think Jessica and Natalie are both sick because they ate David's muffins but the twins discover they are both two months pregnant. Natalie realizes that either Brody or John could be her baby's father and Jessica recalls that either Brody or Ford could be her baby's father. Jessica ignores Brody's calls. Natalie runs into Brody at Rodi's and he can tell that she is acting oddly around him because they hooked up. Jessica runs into Ford and when she tries to bring up the topic, he insists nothing happened. Jess goes to Kelly and tells her that she is pregnant and isn't sure if Brody is the father. Gigi surmises by Natalie's behavior and refusing a drink that she must be pregnant. Natalie confides to Gigi that she isn't sure if John is the father."

        "Greg: Jessica, did you hear me? You're pregnant.",
        "Jessica: Are you sure?",
        "Greg: I take it this wasn't planned?",
        "Jessica: No, it's not that, it's just -- I don't know -- I had no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, what did you just say?",
        "Doctor: You're pregnant.",
        "Natalie: Uh, no, no, no, no. No, I can't be.",
        "Doctor: You can't be?",
        "Natalie: I mean, I -- I \"can\" be, but I just -- I -- are you sure?",
        "Doctor: Yes. So, I'm assuming this wasn't planned.",
        "Natalie: Hell no. I mean, I got nothing against little babies, but -- I had no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: This came for you.",
        "Gigi: I never get mail here.",
        "Waitress: Well, it's got your name on it. It's from Llanview University. You apply?",
        "Gigi: No, of course not. Me apply to college? I'm a little old for that.",
        "Waitress: Well, the last time I checked, a book is lighter than a tray.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Everything okay?",
        "Eli: Yeah. Excuse me.",
        "Rex: Well, I am going to fly out to Boston tonight and start checking out these Bennett Thompsons.",
        "Kelly: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Just one second, Mrs. Williamson. I'm going to step outside so we can speak more privately. So you say you're looking for Bennett Thompson?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, Dani. Do you have a minute? Um, we wanted to tell you something.",
        "Dani: Oh, God, not more bad news.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, no, no. No, no. This is actually really good news.",
        "Dani: You're in remission? You're not going to die?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I could have sworn Dorian would take the bait.",
        "Viki: Yeah, me, too. I know. I'm just sorry you lost your job. I know how important this project is to you.",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, it'll still get built.",
        "Viki: Well, don't be too sure. A Dorian scorned --",
        "Charlie: No, is no match for \"The Banner\" and she's still a public official. And if she tries to renege on this project, then we'll just have to remind the public.",
        "Viki: And we can do that. Yes, yes.",
        "Charlie: I just knew it wasn't going to last very long, anyway, over there, working with her. Sooner or later, she was going to realize that I truly love my wife. Oh, God.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Charlie: This Vickers?",
        "Viki: Ah. [Laughing] Yes.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Viki: Um -- this is actually the Christmas model. And it lights up.",
        "Charlie: Oh, great. Maybe he'll fall in the pool and electrocute himself.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Brody: Hey, Charlie, Viki.",
        "Viki: Hi, Brody.",
        "Charlie: Oh, hey.",
        "Brody: Have you seen Jess?",
        "Viki: No, not since she went off to the doctor. She wasn't feeling well. She's sick.",
        "Brody: She's sick?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I thought maybe I had a virus.",
        "Greg: Nope. You're having a baby.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Yeah, apparently, she started feeling nauseous after eating a muffin.",
        "Charlie: Baked by David Vickers.",
        "Brody: David bakes?",
        "Viki: David made muffins. Huh.",
        "Brody: And Jessica ate one? What was she thinking?",
        "Viki: Well, Natalie ate one, too.",
        "Charlie: And she's sick, as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I -- well, I thought it was just food poisoning.",
        "Doctor: No. You're having a baby.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So you're telling me David Vickers poisoned both your daughters?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Charlie: That's exactly what she's saying.",
        "Viki: No! Come on. To be fair, David had a muffin and he's no worse for wear.",
        "Charlie: Depends on who you ask.",
        "[Viki scoffs]",
        "Brody: So if it's not the muffins --",
        "Viki: Then why are they sick? I have no idea. That's why they went to the doctor, to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: I realize this is a surprise, but I have to say, this is the kind of news I'm happy to deliver. Congratulations. This is good news, isn't it?",
        "Natalie: I'm not sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Congratulations, Jessica. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to assume -- is this not good news?",
        "Jessica: I'm not sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: She's not picking up.",
        "Viki: Well, maybe they're still at the doctors. Or maybe they're feeling better and they went out somewhere. I mean, Natalie likes to play pool.",
        "Brody: Oh -- hey, Jess, I'm at your house. Your mom says you're not feeling too good and that you went to the doctor. I hope you're feeling better. I'm going to go over to Rodi's. Why don't you give me a call, let me know how you're doing. Okay.",
        "Viki: Well, let me know if there's a problem, okay?",
        "Brody: Sure thing. All right. See you.",
        "Viki: Okay. Ha ha ha. Well, now, that blue matches your eyes.",
        "Charlie: And you're saying that a grown man actually wore this?",
        "Viki: No. David Vickers wore that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You know what? Let me call you right back. Hey, John. You looking for someone?",
        "John: Yeah, have you seen Kelly or Rex?",
        "Eli: Yeah, they're inside. Come in.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Eli: Oh, you know, I still haven't gotten that file on my client, Hannah O'Connor, from Saint Ann's. Your office hasn't heard anything, have they?",
        "John: As far as I know, she's still being evaluated, but I'm not here about her. I'm here about Bennett Thompson.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: No, honey, I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to get your hopes up.",
        "Todd: Of course, we'd all love some good news on that front, but no, this is about something different.",
        "Dani: So nothing's changed?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, mija, I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: But you're feeling good today, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Todd: And she's continuing with the treatments and everything.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Dani: So what's the good news?",
        "T\u00e9a: You tell her.",
        "Todd: You sure?",
        "Dani: Somebody tell me.",
        "Todd: Your mom and I are getting married.",
        "[T\u00e9a giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay. Is there a possibility that you could be wrong here?",
        "Doctor: This isn't a home pregnancy test, Natalie. The results are conclusive.",
        "Natalie: Okay. And how far along am I?",
        "Doctor: 2 months.",
        "Natalie: 2 months?",
        "Natalie: Oh, no. Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no --",
        "Doctor: Natalie, are you all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Is there anything that might have caused a false positive?",
        "Greg: Well, the test is pretty accurate.",
        "Jessica: I -- just never expected -- how far along am I?",
        "Greg: About 2 months.",
        "Jessica: 2 months?",
        "Greg: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ford: Are you okay, baby?",
        "Jessica: Yes. I want this.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no.",
        "Greg: Are you all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm fine. I just -- I'm a little blown away. I -- this is not what I was thinking about. I was not thinking about children. I mean, I ju -- I just started a new job.",
        "Doctor: I understand. But in my experience, there's never a right time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's just that, you know, I'm still recovering from everything that happened with Mitch Laurence and -- I just started this new job. This was the last thing that I expected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Look, I can recommend a couple of great OBs here at the hospital. Lots of people, like Morrison and -- Marks is terrific. You'll be fine.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I'll -- I'll make an appointment. Thanks, Doc. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: I understand it's a little overwhelming. Who was it you saw when you had Bree? I want to send the test results over.",
        "Jessica: Um -- I'm not sure who I'm going to use this time.",
        "Greg: It's just that you have these underlying health concerns. I really do think that you need to be seen sooner than later.",
        "Jessica: Right, of course. Thank you, Doctor.",
        "Greg: Of course. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Jessica: So, um, what did the doctor say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Darling, I know that David Vickers is not exactly your favorite person.",
        "Charlie: Well, the guy's a parasite.",
        "Viki: Well, sometimes, yes. But he's also very amusing, and he's loyal.",
        "Charlie: Oh, loyal? You call that loyal? He's supposed to be in love with Dorian, but he's rolling around in the sack with you?",
        "Viki: That was our plan.",
        "[Charlie groans]",
        "Viki: Come on. I know it must have been disconcerting to find us together, but, sweetheart, it didn't mean anything. I mean, you do know that, don't you?",
        "Charlie: Just do me a favor, okay? Burn those sheets.",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie --",
        "Charlie: No, I -- I know it was my fault. So next time I come up with a brilliant idea like that, just throw me in the pool.",
        "Viki: [Chuckles] What if I had found you and Dorian together?",
        "Charlie: But no, there is no \"me and Dorian.\"",
        "Viki: And there is no \"David and me.\"",
        "[Charlie groans]",
        "Viki: There is only you and me. May I tell you a little secret?",
        "Charlie: Maybe.",
        "Viki: [Laughs] When I was taking pictures of -- he who must not be named --",
        "Charlie: Vickers.",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm. It made me think of that time last summer when you and I were out by the pool. Remember, just the two of us? And I was putting sunscreen on your shoulders and -- remember?",
        "Charlie: And when are we ever going to be just you and me by that pool again, hmm?",
        "Viki: That's a good question. We should do something about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Bennett Thompson? So you think he's a suspect?",
        "John: Oh, I just need to speak to Kelly.",
        "Eli: Unless this has anything to do with, you know, me and --",
        "John: No, not yet.",
        "Kelly: Oh, hey, John. I didn't hear the doorbell.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Eli: Yeah. I let him in.",
        "John: I -- I just wanted to drop this off. It's -- it's a copy of the case file. There's a copy in there of the baseball card and the paper that was found in the vase.",
        "Rex: Now, you're sure this is not a problem, John -- me working this?",
        "John: Yeah, no problem. I got a lot going on here, and no jurisdiction in Boston, so -- just let me know what's going on.",
        "Kelly: Of course he will. Rex will let you know whenever there's a development. That's for sure.",
        "Rex: Well, there's not much to report yet. We've located 3 Bennett Thompsons in the Boston area. One's a marketing guy, one's a teacher, the other's a lawyer. But with the baseball card and the fact that Rodney was a huge Sox fan, apparently from Boston, I figured that was a good place to start.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Rex: Anyway, I should get going.",
        "Kelly: Okay. I'll call you. Thank you.",
        "Rex: Okay. As soon as I know anything --",
        "Kelly: All right. Bye.",
        "Eli: I got to go, too.",
        "John: Hey, uh -- call my office later, will you, Counselor? There's a couple things we need to go over.",
        "Eli: Oh, absolutely, as soon as I'm done with this appointment.",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eli: Thanks.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: What do you mean, you're getting married?",
        "Todd: Well, for some strange reason, I asked your mom to marry me, and she said yes.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "Todd: So, now I'm stuck with her. No, of course, the truth is that I should have asked her a long time ago, and never should have left her. It was a big mistake.",
        "[T\u00e9a scoffs]",
        "Todd: So what do you say, squirt? You want to give me a chance?",
        "Dani: Okay, first, don't ever call me \"squirt.\"",
        "Todd: Ah, sorry. Done. Dani -- Daniella.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "Todd: But really, I need to know you're -- you're okay with it. I have to have your blessing, or this is a no-go.",
        "Dani: Well, it's not up to me.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, it is, because if you're unhappy, your mom's unhappy. And if your mom's unhappy, then I'm just miserable.",
        "Dani: You're not just doing this because of me?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, sweetheart, I'm doing it because of me.",
        "Dani: Okay, look. I know that I've been hard on you since I got here. But you really came through for me with Nate. And you've been taking good care of my mom. And now that I know that you didn't hurt Dr. Saybrooke, maybe you're not as bad as I thought.",
        "Todd: Tsk. Aw, shucks. Is that a yes?",
        "Dani: Just keep making her smile.",
        "[T\u00e9a giggles]",
        "Todd: Job one.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hmm! [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: The doctor said it was nothing. That it was just probably a stomach virus.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Why? What did Dr. Evans say to you?",
        "Jessica: Um -- same thing. Um, stomach virus, and I probably got it from you.",
        "Natalie: I don't think so. Besides, I think it was still those muffins.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, me, too, but I wonder why David didn't get sick, huh?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Yeah, maybe because he's immune to his own cooties.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, you're probably right.",
        "Natalie: Right. You know, I -- I got to run, so I'm --",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I have lots of stuff to do, so --",
        "Natalie: Okay, so I'll catch you later.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'll call you later. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: John, I really appreciate you coming over here. I can't thank you enough for giving Rex the file.",
        "John: Well, hopefully, he's on to something.",
        "Kelly: Oh, I just hope I'm not on to a wild-goose chase. I mean, we're assuming that the name means something in the vase, but you know what? Bennett Thompson could have nothing to do with my mother, so -- I don't know.",
        "John: Hmm. What was Eli doing here?",
        "Kelly: He just stopped by to see Blair.",
        "John: Mm-hmm. They're getting close.",
        "Kelly: Is there a reason why you're interested in Eli?",
        "John: No. Just had a couple questions for him.",
        "Kelly: John -- I am a reporter, so if there's something you would like to know, all you have to do is just ask me.",
        "John: Oh. Being that you're a reporter, don't make too much out of it. Eli is defending the lead suspect in 3 open cases I'm working. He's got -- he's got Cole for attacking Todd Manning, and then he's got Hannah O'Connor for supposedly assaulting Marty and this guy Ford --",
        "Kelly: Supposedly? Wait a minute. Wait, she -- she confessed to that.",
        "John: She did, and then she -- she unspooled and somehow, Eli got her assigned to Saint Ann's for evaluation.",
        "Kelly: So you don't think she did it?",
        "John: I'm not thinking anything.",
        "Kelly: John, look, if there's something you know about Eli, tell me now. Because Blair is not just seeing the guy, she's going to marry him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Yo, yo. You know what you want?",
        "Brody: Oh, just an order of fries.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Brody: Thanks, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: You okay?",
        "Natalie: Why?",
        "Gigi: You look down.",
        "Natalie: No, I'm -- I'm just really hungry. Yeah, can you get me some fries?",
        "Gigi: I'm going to ask Jeff to make a new batch.",
        "Natalie: Well, then don't bother.",
        "Gigi: No. Brody wants fries, too. Hey, Brody, your fries will be just a minute because I'm going to have Jeff make a fresh batch for you and Natalie.",
        "Brody: No problem. Natalie?",
        "Gigi: I'll bring your fries to his table, okay?",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] I'm sorry, what did you just say?",
        "Doctor: You're pregnant.",
        "Brody: You okay?",
        "Natalie: Why does everyone keep asking me that?",
        "Brody: Well, I'm sorry. Your mom just told me that you and Jessica got sick from some poisoned muffins.",
        "Natalie: Right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. I just -- really, really rough day.",
        "Brody: Those muffins?",
        "Natalie: No. It was, I think, a stomach virus.",
        "Brody: Well, I left your sister a message, but she hasn't gotten back to me.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's weird. She left the hospital at the same time I did.",
        "Brody: So where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Ford: Taking some food to my brother -- who's here because your cousin shot him. What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Straight to voicemail. Hey, Jess, it's me. I'm at Rodi's. Call me back. You want to tell me what the hell's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Oh, Deb, I'm going to take my break now. Hi. You got my text?",
        "Rex: Yeah, on my way to the airport. I was going to call you when I got there, but then you said you needed to see me.",
        "Gigi: Where are you going?",
        "Rex: Boston -- for that case that I'm working on for Kelly, but just for a day or 2. What's going on?",
        "Gigi: Ahem.",
        "Rex: L.U. office of admissions? You applied?",
        "Gigi: I've been thinking about it for a while. I don't really want to be a waitress all my life. And they have this rolling admissions plan for older students so you can take two classes at a time and still work. Anyway, I talked to Viki about it, and she told me to go for it.",
        "Rex: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Gigi: Because if I don't get in -- which I probably didn't -- it's just -- it's too embarrassing.",
        "Rex: Gige?",
        "Gigi: I'm telling you now, okay?",
        "Rex: So --",
        "Gigi: I don't know. I couldn't open it. It's probably a rejection letter. It's really thin.",
        "Rex: I can't believe you didn't open this.",
        "Gigi: I was waiting for you. No. No, you open it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Look, I know you guys are trying to pretend like everything's all normal.",
        "Todd: Me, normal?",
        "Dani: Look, you know what I mean. And I'm trying, too, but it's hard.",
