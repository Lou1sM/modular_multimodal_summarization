        "Bo returns and has lunch with David and Dorian who want him to go after Echo for kidnapping and attempted murder. But Rex wants him to release his mom from jail and reminds Bo that the cops have failed to bring Dorian's nephew to justice for having Rex's son's mom killed. Bo is thereby torn between his loyalties to his biological son and his friendship to Rex. Jessica is still furious with Natalie and Brody. They are tired of her hostility toward them and her failure to accept responsibility for her actions. But Robert comes by to visit Ryder and Jessica is happy to see him and agrees to take Bree with her to the park with Robert and Ryder. Vimal has left the note for John to inform him that Liam is his son and is ready to resign from his job working for Todd. But before John can notice what he's written, Brody sees it, removes it so John does not get to see it and goes to talk to Vimal asking him what he knows. meanwhile Vimal's parents have travel around the world to see their son, daughter in law and new baby unaware that Rama lied about being pregnant and Vimal is ready to divorce her. Rama is staying at The Minuteman with Aubrey and Cutter. Aubrey is clearly not over Joey nor ready to get back with Cutter. Joey, however, is moving on with Kelly."

        "Natalie: Thank you for coming with us. It was nice having breakfast as a family.",
        "Brody: I'm glad I could. You know, I feel like I saw you more when we were just friends.",
        "Natalie: You're probably right.",
        "Brody: I could stay over tonight. Or not.",
        "Natalie: I just don't want to rub it in Jessica's face.",
        "Jessica: Oh! Well, I have an idea. Why don't you move out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, son.",
        "David: Pa.",
        "Bo: Sorry I'm late, but Nora and I spent the night in Philly. We hit a ton of traffic.",
        "David: How's Matthew?",
        "Bo: He's about the same. They've got him settled into a rehab schedule.",
        "David: He's gonna get his miracle, Pa. I'm sure of it. You never know where it's gonna come from.",
        "Bo: I hope you're right.",
        "David: Mine came from Spiderman. Your daughter-in-law the mayor? She could have been killed yesterday, if not for a hero.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Rise and shine, Kelly! I've got something to make you smile.",
        "Joey: Oh!",
        "Kelly: Aah!",
        "Cutter: Rise and shine!",
        "Aubrey: Oh, forget it.",
        "Cutter: Come on. Is that any way to greet the day?",
        "Aubrey: It cannot be morning. I couldn't sleep at all on this stupid lumpy mattress.",
        "Rama: At least you had the blanket. She took all the covers.",
        "Cutter: Whatever. You're lucky we even let you stay here. You're also lucky that I'm a gentleman and slept on the couch. Here, princess. These came for you. What?",
        "Aubrey: It's official. Joey and I are divorced.",
        "Rama: I'm gonna be soon in the same boat. I'm sure Vimal has filed for divorce, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: \"Dear Mr. Manning, please accept my resignation, effective immediately. You will no doubt soon learn that I wrote a letter to John McBain telling him the secret you entrusted to me. Lieutenant McBain needs to know that he is Liam's father.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: McBain.",
        "John: What's going on, Rex?",
        "Rex: How could you put my mom in jail?",
        "John: She apparently kidnapped the mayor.",
        "Rex: You can't believe that. So let her go.",
        "John: I can't. She's being arraigned this morning.",
        "Rex: What do I have to do to get her out?",
        "John: Post bail at her arraignment. I warn you, it could be high.",
        "Rex: I can afford it. How do we make the charges go away?",
        "John: At trial. You want to throw some money around, get a good lawyer.",
        "Rex: Or maybe I'll find the real kidnapper, the way that Todd found Gigi's real killer.",
        "John: Ok, ok. Look, your mom was at the scene. The mayor's made a statement. There's evidence.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and there was evidence that Jack Manning lured Gigi to her death, but that didn't stop Todd or you.",
        "John: Hey, you think I wanted to let that kid go? I know he's guilty, all right? I hated that as much as you did.",
        "Rex: No, you don't.",
        "John: All right, Rex. I'm not gonna argue with you about this. All I can say is this case isn't over, and for now I'm sorry.",
        "Rex: I don't have time for sorry. I have to take care of my family.",
        "John: Yeah, you should focus on that.",
        "Rex: Why? What else do you think I'm focused on?",
        "John: Revenge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Yeah, I heard about what happened to Dorian. I'm glad she's safe and sound.",
        "David: Echo tied Dorian up in a motel. That's my job.",
        "Bo: I don't want to hear about--",
        "David: Sorry, Pa.",
        "Bo: It looks like we caught Echo red-handed. Wish all cases were this easy.",
        "David: Are you working on a tough one right now?",
        "Bo: I'm thinking about Matthew.",
        "David: Any clues who did this to him?",
        "Bo: A gum wrapper. And that's it. We found a gum wrapper there in the living room. Nora doesn't chew gum. I don't chew gum. So we figured chances are it belonged to whoever hurt Matthew.",
        "David: You want me to check it out?",
        "Bo: No, that's ok.",
        "David: No, it's no problem, Pa. I was the brainy one on the \"Supermodel Crime Club,\" remember?",
        "Bo: Yeah, we'll call you if we need any help, but I think right now it's good if you stick to acting.",
        "David: It's good that I did. There's some really great news on that front.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I see you're up and about.",
        "Kelly: Yep!",
        "Dorian: And celebrating.",
        "Kelly: Ok, enough talk about that.",
        "Joey: I'm sorry if you saw anything.",
        "Kelly: Dorian, you can come in.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha ha! Don't be silly. I'm thrilled to see the two of you together.",
        "Kelly: Good. Would you mind giving us just a little bit of privacy, please?",
        "Dorian: Of course, honey, but I want to give you this first. Sorry, Joe. I had no idea that you were here. I'm delighted to report that David's back home and you two aren't the only ones who've been celebrating. It turns out that Echo set him up. Yeah. Made it look like David was cheating with that stripper pole-dancing co-star of his.",
        "Kelly: Oh. Now you know.",
        "Dorian: Right, and when I confronted Echo, she kidnapped me.",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Kelly: What?",
        "Dorian: Luckily, my great-nephew is a superhero.",
        "Kelly: Oh, let me see that. Oh, let me see that. I am so framing this.",
        "Joey: That is genius.",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes, and look, look. Echo behind bars. Yes, yes, that is genius.",
        "Kelly: You know what, Dorian, you should have trusted David.",
        "Dorian: And...Joe should have trusted you when you told him what a schemer his wife was.",
        "Joey: Ex-wife, actually. Aubrey is officially out of my life.",
        "Dorian: Well done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Did you at least fight Joey for alimony?",
        "Aubrey: Really? How well do you think our scam would have gone over in court?",
        "Cutter: That sap would have given you something just to keep it out of court. You should have pushed him.",
        "Aubrey: No, he hates me already.",
        "Cutter: So you had nothing to lose. Rama, tell her.",
        "Rama: I understand.",
        "Cutter: You guys are both hopeless.",
        "Rama: I went to congratulate Vimal on his new job.",
        "Aubrey: Was he happy to see you? Oh, that bad, huh?",
        "Rama: He could barely even look at me, Aubrey. He told his parents about the baby. I put him in such a bad position.",
        "Aubrey: It's ok, it's just one phone call.",
        "Rama: No. His parents are coming here, to America. They expect to see him with a pregnant wife.",
        "Cutter: It's not that big a deal. Couples split up all the time.",
        "Rama: Not in the Patel family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: \"I'm truly sorry, but I cannot live with any more secrets, especially about children and their fathers. I will save you the trouble of firing me--\"",
        "Mr. Patel: Vimal!",
        "Vimal: Amma! Pappa! What are you doing here?",
        "Mrs. Patel: A fine way to greet your parents after a long flight.",
        "Mr. Patel: You knew we were coming.",
        "Vimal: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, of course, but I didn't expect you to come so soon.",
        "Mrs. Patel: You know your father. We were at the airport 6 hours early.",
        "Mr. Patel: And lucky for us because we were able to take an earlier flight.",
        "Mrs. Patel: Come and give a proper hug to your mother.",
        "Mr. Patel: You're surprised?",
        "Vimal: Very, very.",
        "Mrs. Patel: Vimal, your office is spectacular.",
        "Vimal: Oh, no...",
        "Mr. Patel: Oh, don't be modest with us, son. It is obvious you've done very well for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You want me to move out?",
        "Jessica: If you're that uncomfortable around me, maybe you should.",
        "Brody: She's trying to be sensitive to your feelings.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I can see that.",
        "Brody: You broke up with me. It's not like I walked out on you.",
        "Jessica: Brody, I didn't break up with you, but it's ok 'cause it didn't take you that long to find happiness. You just had to walk down the hall to my sister.",
        "Natalie: That is not how it was. No one wanted to hurt you.",
        "Brody: Jessica's right. This isn't working. What were we just saying about not seeing each other?",
        "Natalie: Brody.",
        "Brody: No. You should be comfortable in your own home, Natalie. So move in with me.",
        "Natalie: Can we talk about this privately?",
        "Jessica: Great! Great! What's there to talk about? That's a perfect solution. Natalie, I'll go pack your things.",
        "Natalie: Brody.",
        "Jessica: Wait. You're worried about John, aren't you, and how he's gonna feel about living down the hall from your new instant family.",
        "Brody: Let's talk outside.",
        "Natalie: Jess, this isn't your business.",
        "Jessica: If I was you, I wouldn't worry about his delicate feelings. I would worry about John.",
        "Natalie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Jessica: If Liam were John's, where do you think your new girlfriend would be right now?",
        "Brody: Don't let her get to you.",
        "Natalie: None of us can live like this.",
        "Brody: We'll figure it out later, ok? After work. I'll take Liam up.",
        "Natalie: See you later.",
        "Jessica: I came out here for some peace. I could really use a break right now.",
        "Natalie: We all could, but I guess that's not gonna happen, is it?",
        "Jessica: Not if you don't get out of my face.",
        "Natalie: Jess, do you really think that I tried to hurt you?",
        "Jessica: I don't know what to think, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry you were sick. I tried to be sympathetic.",
        "Jessica: This is you trying?",
        "Natalie: Yes! This is everyone trying.",
        "Jessica: Don't put this on other people. This is about what you did.",
        "Natalie: We all walk on eggshells around you, trying to protect you.",
        "Jessica: I didn't ask you to.",
        "Natalie: Really? Because that's exactly what happens when you're sick. But you don't know. You're gone. But we're all still here with our lives on hold waiting for you until you came back.",
        "Jessica: You really think that you're the injured party here?",
        "Natalie: All I'm saying is you're not the only victim.",
        "Jessica: Go to hell.",
        "Natalie: No! No! You do not get to walk away this time, Jessica! Fine. You don't want to be protected anymore? Then the gloves are coming off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: This isn't my office, Pappa. It belongs to my boss, Todd Manning.",
        "Mrs. Patel: Still, yours must be very nice as well.",
        "Mr. Patel: Our cab driver told us this is a very important media company. Very popular?",
        "Vimal: Oh, yeah. We do sell a lot of papers.",
        "Mr. Patel: We were very pleased to hear about your new job.",
        "Mrs. Patel: You looked so unhappy at Statesville Industries. Even now, look at your face when you hear that name. Smile, my darling son. All is well. You have a wonderful new job and your Rama will be glowing with pregnancy. Yes?",
        "Vimal: Mmm...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: The Patels arranged this marriage. They expected a dutiful wife.",
        "Cutter: So just tell them they didn't get what they paid for.",
        "Rama: I suppose you would know all about that, wouldn't you? Did you get the newspaper this morning?",
        "Cutter: No, I haven't been out. The divorce stuff was under the door.",
        "Rama: Well, I have to check the classifieds, 'cause I, Rama Patel, need a job, believe it or not.",
        "Cutter: You had to know this was coming.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah.",
        "Cutter: You're free, Aubrey.",
        "Aubrey: You mean no jail?",
        "Cutter: I mean no husband. You can do anything you want.",
        "Aubrey: Nowhere to go from here but up.",
        "Cutter: Look, we've been in way tougher jams and we've gotten out of 'em all. We were good together.",
        "Aubrey: Are you actually making a play for me right now?",
        "Cutter: Don't flatter yourself. We can work together and that's it. All right? You were really good, at least until you fell for Joey. That's not gonna happen again now, is it?",
        "Aubrey: No, it's not, but I can't, Cutter.",
        "Cutter: Are you just gonna stay here? Don't tell me you think you can get Joey back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Glad to hear your divorce is final, Joe. Now this means you can marry Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Ok, we're not having that conversation with you, Dorian. And we're definitely not having it naked.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha! All righty, then. I want to make sure that I give you these.",
        "Joey: \"Vicker man: The David Vickers Buchanan story.\"",
        "Kelly: \"Starring David Vickers Buchanan.\"",
        "Dorian: We're having a gala opening premiere tomorrow night. I'm inviting you, both of you.",
        "Joey: Uh...",
        "Kelly: It's just that I've really been missing Zane.",
        "Joey: We were gonna go visit him while he's at camp.",
        "Kelly: They're putting on a show for parents, and I know it's not gonna compare to \"Vicker man,\" but...",
        "Dorian: Fine. I'll wait until you get back. You can see the movie, give me your opinion.",
        "Kelly: You're not upset?",
        "Dorian: No. Of course not. I'm thrilled that Zane has decided to follow in David's footsteps, go into show business. In fact, you just let me know if you want David to give him any tips.",
        "[Joey giggling]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: It's strictly a black-tie affair, but full dress uniform works, too.",
        "Bo: I have a tux.",
        "David: You and Step-Nora, you got primo seats--4th row center.",
        "Bo: Actually, David, we might not be able to make it.",
        "David: What are you talking about? You're the hero of the \"Vicker man\" story.",
        "Bo: I'm sorry, but Nora and I want to spend just as much time as we can with Matthew.",
        "David: I understand.",
        "Bo: You sure?",
        "David: Yeah. You're a real-life hero, Pa. Harrison Ford was pretty good in the role, but he kept ignoring my suggestions.",
        "Bo: Wait. Harrison Ford played me?",
        "David: Huh.",
        "Bo: Wow! Who played Balsom?",
        "David: Rex didn't make the cut. We took dramatic license.",
        "Bo: I couldn't have rescued you without him.",
        "David: Yeah, well, maybe you would have found me 6 months sooner if he had stepped up.",
        "Bo: Yeah, ok, ok.",
        "David: Balsom never paid for that.",
        "Bo: I know. Maybe not, but trust me, he's suffering now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Jack Manning got beat up at his father's office the other day. You know anything about that?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "John: Manning thinks it has something to do with corporate espionage. Some company beat him out on a big satellite deal.",
        "Rex: So what's that got to do with me?",
        "John: The name of the company is Origami Cogs.",
        "Rex: Yeah?",
        "John: Rex, it took me about 10 minutes to figure out that Origami Cogs is an anagram for Gigi Morasco. We all have internal plumbing.",
        "Rex: Ok, yeah, I set up a company in Gigi's memory.",
        "John: Used it to grab a business that Manning was after.",
        "Rex: I beat him on a deal. That's all.",
        "John: You want to go after the guy's money, more power to you.",
        "Rex: So why does this sound like a warning?",
        "John: Let's just say if your path for revenge starts to become a little more personal, say, physical, well, all I want to tell you is you step over the line too far, then I have to get involved.",
        "Rex: What are you gonna do, arrest me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I didn't mean that Rex should have lost Gigi. I wouldn't wish that on anybody.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Dorian: Buenos dias... hello! There you are, ma ch\u00e9rie.",
        "David: Ma ch\u00e9rie.",
        "Dorian: Bisou.",
        "David: Bisou. We like to French-kiss.",
        "Dorian: TMI, darling.",
        "David: I been out, handing out my invites.",
        "Dorian: Oh!",
        "David: Pa had to extend his regrets.",
        "Dorian: Really? Did you remember that you work for me?",
        "Bo: Every day.",
        "David: It's ok, baby. Pa and Step-Nora, they need to spend some time with my little bro.",
        "Dorian: That sounds like a viable excuse, however, I hope you will assure me that you and Nora will devote your business hours to making sure that Echo DiSavoy ends up in Statesville prison for 10 to 20 years.",
        "Bo: I'll see what the charges carry.",
        "Dorian: What about your brother Clint?",
        "Bo: What about him?",
        "Dorian: On television, in front of everyone, he confessed to committing murder and kidnapping. If he's not incarcerated the minute he's well enough, the public will question--",
        "Bo: You know what, I think if we want to talk about business, maybe we should set up a meeting at the station.",
        "Dorian: Good idea. Ha ha-ha and I'm in too good a mood to argue. Bisou, Bisou, encore.",
        "David: Bisou.",
        "Dorian: Justice can wait... but not for long.",

        "Aubrey: Joey's already moved on. I'm sure he's planning on marrying Kelly Cramer right now.",
        "Rama: Did you know Spiderman was in the building yesterday?",
        "Cutter: No, I must have missed him in the parking lot.",
        "Rama: There are just two little, tiny columns of classifieds.",
        "Cutter: You better hope your dream job's in there, 'cause I'm almost out of money.",
        "Aubrey: What? How is that possible?",
        "Cutter: I didn't think the Buchanans would take back the payoff, so I didn't stash that much.",
        "Aubrey: What does that mean?",
        "Cutter: It means that we all need to get jobs, 'cause even this luxurious lifestyle won't last us long.",
        "Aubrey: How could we all be broke?",
        "Rama: Because we were all greedy for money and security. I have no idea how rich I already was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: I need to explain about Rama. She's not--",
        "Mr. Patel: Not what?",
        "Mrs. Patel: She's not glowing?",
        "Vimal: No.",
        "Mrs. Patel: I was often queasy, too. Everyone thinks you should be radiant all the time, but it's a heavy business to carry a child. She needs a woman who understands.",
        "Vimal: No, Amma, that's not what I--",
        "Mr. Patel: Is there a problem with my grandson?",
        "Vimal: No, no. I'm trying to tell you. You're not going to have a grandson.",
        "Mrs. Patel: A-ha! I knew it! I told you, Surajit. It's a girl, right?",
        "Mr. Patel: A girl will be a blessing to us all, son. What a wonderful surprise.",
        "Mrs. Patel: I can't wait to see Rama. Shall we go home and see her now?",
        "Vimal: No! No, no. I just have some business that I need to take care of.",
        "Mrs. Patel: Of course.",
        "Mr. Patel: You see? We interrupt him in the middle of the business day. He can't just run around and cater to us.",
        "Vimal: No, I want to. It's just--here, take whatever you like. Make yourself at home, and I will be back as soon as I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jessica, this victim thing is getting old.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. So what is the timetable for me to get over you sleeping with my fianc\u00e9?",
        "Natalie: About as long as it took me to get over you trying to kill me and locking me in that basement.",
        "Jessica: I was sick, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Jessica, I'm sorry, but I am tired of hearing how sick you were. It's too easy.",
