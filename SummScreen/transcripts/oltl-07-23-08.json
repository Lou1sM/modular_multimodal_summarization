        "Dorian: I'm a physician, this woman is a transplant. She's in cardiac arrest. She needs immediate attention.",
        "David: I'm a V.I.P.",
        "Dorian: Oh, shut up, David.",
        "David: Viki, you hold on there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What's wrong?",
        "Todd: Nothing.",
        "Marty: You always watch TV with the sound off?",
        "Todd: Yeah, when there's nothing good on.",
        "Marty: All right, well if you're going to camp out in my room in this mood, I'd appreciate knowing what's going on.",
        "Todd: All right. You want me gone, okay.",
        "Marty: No, no. I didn't say that. But can I help?",
        "Todd: No, I don't think anyone can help me with the fact that my 16-year-old daughter got pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Starr: Come in.",
        "Langston: I hope that's retail therapy you're working on.",
        "Starr: Mm-hmm.",
        "Langston: Talking to Cole all night?",
        "Starr: I want to but I don't know what I would say.",
        "Langston: \"I love you,\" is always a good start.",
        "Starr: I told him that at court.",
        "Langston: And?",
        "Starr: Well, then I sort of gave him an ultimatum.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Starr really wants you to sign away all your rights to your kid?",
        "Cole: Mm-hmm. She said that if I really loved her and the baby, then I would do it.",
        "Markko: Whoa.",
        "Cole: I mean, how could she say that to me after everything we've been through together?",
        "Markko: No dude, maybe you heard it wrong.",
        "Cole: No, no, she said it.",
        "Markko: Hormones, man. It's got to be hormones. I don't think Starr really gets what she's saying anymore.",
        "Cole: I would give my life for her and that baby. I would do anything for them.",
        "Markko: Does that include letting her give the baby up for adoption?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marcie: Hey.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marcie: Um, is Mike here?",
        "John: He's at work.",
        "Marcie: Oh, well, I thought I would just bring him some clean clothes. So maybe you can --",
        "John: Oh, yeah, he could use these. He's pretty smelly. Come on in.",
        "Marcie: Thanks a lot.",
        "John: All right.",
        "John: Is there something else you wanted?",
        "Marcie: Uh, yeah. I'd like my husband back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Get her in there.",
        "EMT: You got it.",
        "David: Take good care of her.",
        "Michael: What happened?",
        "Dorian: Viki and I were together in Natalie's car. Viki was driving. She lost control of the car because the brakes didn't hold. On impact she went into cardiac arrest. I injected epi directly into her heart. She regained consciousness almost immediately.",
        "Michael: And she's been stable ever since?",
        "Dorian: As far as I know.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Dorian: And remember, she's a transplant.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I want you to get checked out, too.",
        "Dorian: Right.",
        "David: Is Viki going to be all right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You know, it's very, very late. I bet I could come up with something far more interesting to wrap yourself up in besides those papers.",
        "Clint: Well, the chances of that happening are good, most nights.",
        "Nora: Oh, not tonight? Why? What's up?",
        "Clint: I just got off the phone with cord.",
        "Nora: Is he okay?",
        "Clint: Yeah, he's fine. We had a very good talk. But I wanted to tell him that we had found a way to kick Dorian out of B.E., but the more I go over these contracts, the more I find out that there is no fast way to nullify this takeover.",
        "Nora: Well, certainly not in court. It's going to be years of litigation.",
        "Clint: Yeah, and you're the attorney I trust. And if that's your conclusion, I think we should move on to a more personal approach.",
        "Nora: You're going to tell David that he's a Buchanan?",
        "Clint: That's a drastic step and I'd need Bo's approval, and I still haven't been able to reach him.",
        "Nora: You said that Rex was looking for him?",
        "Clint: Haven't been able to reach Rex, either. And I don't want to wait another day.",
        "Nora: So what kind of an offer are you going to make to David?",
        "Clint: Oh, something that David can't refuse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Again, Dorian, thank you so much. Thank you for what you did.",
        "Dorian: Thank you doesn't cut it, David. A deal does. We made a deal. I saved Viki's life. I did that. And now you are going to divorce my sister.",
        "David: I said that? Even so, you should know better than to trust me. You must have had another reason for helping Viki.",
        "Dorian: And why in the world would I help anyone who has made my life miserable from the day we met?",
        "David: Well, Viki isn't exactly your biggest fan, either. But I don't think I would have had to blackmail her into saving your life.",
        "Dorian: Oh, of course not. Because saint Viki is better -- better, better, better, better. I get it.",
        "David: Do you think, just maybe, by saving Viki's life you were actually saving your own?",
        "Dorian: You're going to have to get yourself a television show and start dispensing this wonderful wisdom.",
        "David: Face it, cookie, you did a good deed. And the reason that you did that good deed was because it was the right thing to do. Is she okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Michael shouldn't be here. He shouldn't be here with you. He should be at home with me, not on your couch.",
        "John: Please, take him. You're not going to get any arguments from me.",
        "Marcie: Did he say how long he was planning to keep this up?",
        "John: Marcie, I don't think I can --",
        "Marcie: I know. I know you can't break his confidence. I shouldn't have asked.",
        "John: He loves you.",
        "Marcie: I love him, too. I love him more than anything, you know that. And I know that it seems like I'm choosing adopting a baby over him, but Michael is the one who is making it a choice, John. I want to do this. I want to do this together, with him.",
        "John: You know Michael would be on board with this if it wasn't Manning's grandchild.",
        "Marcie: I know.",
        "John: And you of all people should know what Manning's capable of.",
        "Marcie: Oh, God, John, it's seared into my brain permanently.",
        "John: I don't want you involved with this guy again.",
        "Marcie: Well, it's too late.",
        "John: What does that mean?",
        "Marcie: Because Todd is already set to block me from adopting Starr's baby.",
        "Marty: Wow, 16 and pregnant. I -- no wonder you're upset.",
        "Todd: [Chuckles]",
        "Marty: Ah, the father?",
        "Todd: Father? This moron kid who obviously doesn't have the sense to use protection. Sorry.",
        "Marty: No, it's okay.",
        "Todd: Bastard. I knew what he had in mind, too. I knew it all along. And I warned him to stay away from my daughter, but --",
        "Marty: Is he at least taking some responsibility?",
        "Todd: Oh, I don't know. I guess you could call it that. I mean, I know we agree on one thing -- we don't want to see Starr give up the kid.",
        "Marty: That's what your daughter's planning on doing?",
        "Todd: You know who she wants to give him to? John McBain's brother and his wife. His wife was the one that stole my kid, kidnapped him. I'm not the bad guy here. I'm always made out to be the bad guy, though. That son of a bitch John, that's what he does. He always spins everything so Marcie and Michael look like saints, and I look like the devil.",
        "Marty: Well, how does he do that?",
        "Todd: Oh, you should see him. He's got this wounded thing, this thing he plays. You know, all the women fall for it. My soon-to-be ex-wife fell for it. But you know, I love my daughter. And I just want to protect her. No one can see that.",
        "Marty: I can see it. There are things that happen in this world that we just have no control over, and the trick is to figure out what you can do about the situation and then move forward.",
        "Todd: [Chuckles] Spoken like a true shrink.",
        "Marty: What? I'm a shrink? I'm a shrink, and you didn't -- you didn't bother to tell me? My God, what else have you been holding out on me?",
        "Starr: Marcie decided that she wants to adopt the baby.",
        "Langston: You're kidding me.",
        "Starr: I know, but then I ran into Cole and my dad and his lawyer and they were trying to get the judge to stop me from giving away the baby.",
        "Langston: Can they even do that?",
        "Starr: Well, not yet. The judge said that Cole can't do anything until the baby's born.",
        "Langston: I can't believe Cole told your dad you're pregnant.",
        "Starr: I know. And I feel like if my dad wouldn't have found out, that Cole would have eventually changed his mind, you know? He would understand that we're not ready to have a baby yet. He just feels like this is his only chance at a family, and it's not.",
        "Langston: Maybe he'll still come around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: There's no way in hell I'm going to give away my rights to my child. Okay, I can't believe that Starr can even ask that.",
        "Markko: But, now you know she can't do anything unless you say she can, right?",
        "Cole: Pretty much.",
        "Markko: Then what's the problem?",
        "Cole: Well, it doesn't really settle anything between Starr and me.",
        "Markko: You're afraid she's going to hate you?",
        "Cole: It just sucks. If I exercise my parental rights, then --",
        "Markko: I'm sorry, dude. Time out, time out. Listen to us -- parental rights? It's like we're on some law show.",
        "Cole: It's pretty unreal.",
        "Markko: Or like one of those episodes where by the end you still don't know who to root for, and then they just roll credits and go to black and you're left there feeling like crap because you didn't see the bad guy get his -- because there was no bad guy, you know, just a bunch of people caught in a crappy situation.",
        "Cole: Dude, what are you talking about? Starr and I are both wrong or right? What's going on?",
        "Markko: Hey, hey, come on, I'm still trying to wrap my brain around paternal -- parental rights.",
        "Cole: Okay, well, wrap your brain around this. If I fight Starr for the baby, I could end up losing her forever.",
        "Markko: If? Dude, I thought it was a done deal.",
        "Cole: I can't stand the idea of someone else raising my kid, and I don't want Starr's dad to take over, either.",
        "Markko: Do you really think Mr. Manning's going to be hands off with y raising his grandchild?",
        "Cole: I don't want to think about that right now.",
        "Markko: Well, man, you got to.",
        "Cole: [Sighs] Oh, I just wish my mom was here. She always knew how to make things clear.",
        "Markko: From what you told me, your mom was crystal clear about one thing -- how she felt about Mr. Manning.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's true. And she wanted me to stay --",
        "Markko: To stay as far away from him as possible. Man, your mom hated Starr's dad.",
        "Cole: With good reason, wouldn't you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm not holding out on you.",
        "Marty: You knew what I did for a living and you didn't tell me?",
        "Todd: Well, it just never came up.",
        "Marty: It never came -- oh, give me a break. I've been begging you to tell me details of my life and what I was like since I --",
        "Todd: You don't have to get riled up about it.",
        "Marty: I am riled up, and you know why? It's your fault. Who the hell are you not to tell me what's going on, who I am?",
        "Todd: Well, it's not as if I kept it from you, really. I mean, I just didn't --",
        "Marty: A psychologist?",
        "Todd: Psychiatrist.",
        "Marty: Psychiatrist, okay. Minor detail. Why didn't you tell me sooner?",
        "Todd: Well, I didn't want you to freak out.",
        "Marty: That I help people for a living?",
        "Todd: No, that you can't help people for a living anymore. Not now. See, it doesn't feel so good now, does it?",
        "Marty: Yeah, well you know what? That's not the point. And no, I can't exactly help people when I can't help myself. Thank you for pointing that out.",
        "Todd: Well, you've helped me.",
        "Marty: Huh. Okay, psychiatrist, let's see. That is four years of college, four years of med school, internship, residency, specialty training.",
        "Todd: So is it -- is it coming back to you?",
        "Marty: Why? Does that worry you?",
        "Todd: No, no. Should it worry me?",
        "Marty: No, you know, because I'm just messing with you. Nothing is coming back to me.",
        "Todd: Okay, sorry.",
        "Marty: Okay, well, if I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor, a doctor, a doctor of the mind. Then maybe somewhere in there I have some ability, some knowledge to work my way backwards and find out who I was.",
        "Todd: Maybe.",
        "Marty: Is that why you didn't tell me what I was like in college? I was this big pre-med study geek, right?",
        "Todd: No, not exactly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So what exactly is the offer that you're going to make to David that he can't refuse?",
        "Clint: Oh, well, what does David Vickers want most in this life?",
        "Nora: Money.",
        "Clint: You're bright as a penny.",
        "Nora: Oh, you. But he's got all he wants from his wife.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, not necessarily. Because Dorian is still Addie's legal guardian, so she could cut her off at any time.",
        "Nora: But she hasn't done that yet.",
        "Clint: Well, she probably doesn't want to alienate her sister at this point. But even David must know it's just a matter of time. So I'm going to offer him enough capital to get him to jump ship.",
        "Nora: Oh, that's a brilliant plan. One problem -- you don't own the company. Where are you going to get the capital from?",
        "Clint: Dorian Lord.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Her EKG looks good.",
        "David: Oh, thank God.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I expect her to make a full recovery. She sustained no lasting trauma to her heart, and there's no other wounds.",
        "Dorian: That's wonderful.",
        "Michael: Yeah. You saved her life.",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Michael: Excuse me.",
        "David: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Saved her life.",
        "David: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. Oh, just in time. Hello, Carl Lodge. This is David Vickers. David, Carl is from my attorney's office. Yes, he's going to be handling your divorce from Addie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So I'll call your family and let them know you're here.",
        "Viki: No, please don't.",
        "Michael: Viki, you could have died.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but I didn't. And I really, really don't want to upset Jessica. She's dealing with so much right now, okay?",
        "Michael: Dorian told me a little bit about what happened.",
        "Viki: I just remember not being able to stop the car and crashing, and that's all. That's all I remember.",
        "Michael: Well, you've got a lot of bruising on your ribs. You must have hit the steering wheel or the air bag, or -- you went into cardiac arrest.",
        "Viki: Are you serious?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Viki: That means --",
        "Michael: You were clinically dead for a little while. You're lucky to be alive.",
        "Viki: Ben. Ben saved my life.",
        "Michael: You were right, Ben did save your life. His heart was strong enough to react to the epinephrine. You're a very lucky woman.",
        "Viki: He's taking care of me even now.",
        "Michael: So I'd like to keep you overnight and run some more tests and just monitor you.",
        "Viki: When do you think I can go home?",
        "Michael: Well, if you have a good night, maybe tomorrow.",
        "Viki: Dorian was with me in the car. Is she all right?",
        "Michael: Yeah, she's getting checked out, but it seems like she walk away from the accident pretty much unscathed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: When did you call him, from the ambulance?",
        "Dorian: Actually, I did. Carl, very good incentive. Making it an annulment rather than a divorce, much better. Thanks. David, sign right here, and it will be as if your marriage to my sister never existed.",
        "David: Addie's going to be really disappointed.",
        "Dorian: She'll get over it.",
        "David: I don't think divorce was on her to-do list.",
        "Dorian: Sign, David.",
        "David: I like Addie.",
        "Dorian: You like my money.",
        "David: No, I like her. She's nice and funny, and honest.",
        "Dorian: Oh, for heaven's sake, David. Will you sign?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm not surprised Manning's using Cole to his advantage.",
        "Marcie: Oh, you should have seen him. I mean, Cole didn't even know why Todd brought him to the courthouse.",
        "John: Oh, Cole has his own reasons for not giving the baby up.",
        "Marcie: I realize that.",
        "John: If he does, that's the end of it.",
        "Marcie: Starr thinks that maybe he'll come around, you know?",
        "John: Yeah. If he doesn't?",
        "Marcie: Well, then that fight is going to have to be between Cole and Starr, because Starr is committed to giving this baby to me.",
        "John: You sure you want to go through with this?",
        "Marcie: Oh, John, I've thought about everything you're thinking. I have. I've thought about everything that Michael is thinking. And I said no to Starr when she first asked me to adopt the baby.",
        "John: So what changed?",
        "Marcie: I want a kid. John, I have searched my heart and I have to fight this.",
        "John: Even if you fight it alone?",
        "Marcie: Mike is just scared. That's all it is. I really do think that when the idea of him becoming a father again becomes more real, I think -- no, look.",
        "John: Oh, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: John, I have to. I have to take this chance. Look, yes, I've been blessed. Yes, I've had some success, and with Michael I found the love of my life. But am I just supposed to say, \"okay, this is what I get, this is all there is\"? You know, people leave you. People you love leave you, look at my mother. Look at Nash. You don't know what can happen in life. But children -- children, they give everything meaning and that is what Tommy did for us.",
        "John: I know how much you loved Tommy.",
        "Marcie: People talk. They talk about eternal life but, John, that is what children are, that's what they give you. You know, you live on through them forever. I mean, think about Marty. Think about how you would feel right now if you have a kid with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So if I wasn't a classic pre-med, then what was I?",
        "Todd: You know what it's time for? Bedtime physical therapy.",
        "Marty: What? That's Janet's job.",
        "Todd: No, Janet has the night off. She told me what to do, so --",
        "Marty: All right, but don't think that the pain is going to get me off track here.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "Todd: Um, here and right in here.",
        "Marty: Mm.",
        "Todd: How's that?",
        "Marty: Yeah, okay. Was I popular?",
        "Marty: Friendly? Was I friendly? Did I like to party?",
        "Marty: Party up here!",
        "Todd: Yes. Yes, you liked to party. Everyone liked to party, it was college. But you were very smart. Actually, you were my tutor.",
        "Marty: Well, is that how we met?",
        "Todd: Um, no. We met before that.",
        "Marty: So we were friends.",
        "Todd: [Clears throat] We slept together.",
        "Marty: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: If David can force Dorian to give the company back in exchange for divorcing Addie, then C.E. reverts back to B.E. and I'll have enough money to pay him off.",
        "Nora: Oh -- but what if he wants his money up front?",
        "Clint: Well, that's too bad, because I don't pay in full until the job is done, but I will have enough assets that I can give him a nice little advance.",
        "Nora: A lot of \"ifs\" in this proposition, you know.",
        "Clint: There's also a lot of certainty, because Dorian will do anything to get David to divorce Addie. David will do anything for money, and I will do anything to restore Asa's legacy. So if this works, we all get what we want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I did my part, David. I saved Viki's life. Now it's time for you to live up to your part of the deal.",
        "David: Fine.",

        "David: There.",
        "Dorian: When you speak of this, and I'm sure you will, explain it to Addie without mentioning me.",
        "David: Or what? You'll put Viki back into cardiac arrest?",
        "Dorian: Or I will ruin you, and you know that I can.",
        "David: That would make you happy, wouldn't it?",
        "Dorian: Infinitely.",
        "David: Infinity is that squiggly little line that goes back and forth and around like this forever. That's not how you're happy, though. You're only happy when you've brought someone down, like ruining the Buchanans by taking over B.E., or ruining Viki's life also.",
        "Dorian: I saved her life tonight.",
        "David: None of your triumphs are ever enough to fill that empty little space.",

        "Viki: David, hi.",
        "David: How are you doing?",
        "Viki: Well, I guess I'm fine. They say I'm fine. They said they want to keep me overnight for tests and stuff, and observation, you know.",
        "David: You really had me scared there for awhile. You were kind of a goner, you know.",
        "Viki: So I hear. David, it was odd. It was really odd -- I don't know what it was.",
        "David: Well, obviously you came back for me. I just wanted to see for myself that you were okay.",
        "Viki: Yeah. How did you know I was here?",
        "David: Oh, I went back looking for Dorian, and I found both of you right after the crash.",
        "Viki: So you're the one who called for help? David, I owe you my life.",
        "David: No, no, not me. It was Dorian.",
        "Viki: Why Dorian?",
        "David: She happened to have her medical bag with her. She stuck you with something that brought you right back to life.",
        "Viki: Dorian gave me the shot of epinephrine?",
        "David: I don't know what it was, but the syringe was bigger than my arm. Don't scare me like that again, okay?",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "David: You have no idea how much you mean to me.",

        "Todd: No.",
        "Marty: [Laughs] Okay. Oh, and -- yeah, no, still nothing. Sorry, I can't remember.",
        "Todd: Actually I'm glad you can't remember. You actually told me that I wasn't very good in bed.",

        "Marty: That's a relief. I'm sorry, it's just -- it's -- it's -- I don't know what it is. Actually, I'm not sure what it is. It just seems strange that I'm learning about my past, but it almost feels like it's somebody else's.",
        "Todd: [Chuckles] I've gone through that, and I don't even have a brain injury.",

        "John: It's okay. It's okay, but you know, you need to know.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "John: It almost killed him. Mike -- you know, when you ran away with Tommy. Knowing that you were out there alone and scared. And it took everything he had to hold it together so he could be there for you when you got back.",
        "Marcie: I know, I know, and he was. And he made me feel like living again.",
        "John: He never wants to see you hurt like that again.",
        "Marcie: I know that, and I know how deeply I hurt him. He deserves better than me, John. He does -- he deserves to be happy.",
        "John: You both do.",
        "Marcie: You know, maybe if we can't be happy about this together, then maybe Mike is better off without me.",

I mean, I wonder if he'll be good at sports, what he'll look like, if he'll look like Cole or me. What he'll be like, you know? I wonder what he'll think about me, if he'll hate me for giving him up.",
        "Langston: That's heavy.",
        "Starr: I just wonder if I'll ever have the chance to tell him how I feel, you know? Why I did what I had to do.",

        "Markko: Dude, all right, check it out. So a few days ago, Langston actually convinced me to make a sex tape with her.",

        "Markko: It was a fake tape, all right? To help dr. Lord get some dirt on Vickers, so she could break up Vickers' marriage to her weird aunt.",
        "Cole: Okay, so Dr. Lord wanted you and Langston to make a sex tape?",
        "Markko: No -- oh, dude, gross. No. She didn't know anything about it. It was all Langston's idea.",
        "Cole: Oh, I was about to get child services on speed dial.",
        "Markko: No, Langston spun up this crazy idea to make it look like Vickers was trying to seduce her so she could use the tape to blackmail him into leaving Addie. Addie's -- she's Dr. Lord's sister.",
        "Cole: Okay, well, did it work?",
        "Markko: Complete disaster. Dude, okay, so Langston was playing her part, right? You know, sexy little teenage vixen.",
        "Cole: Langston sexy?",
        "Markko: Oh, she was into it, man, she was into it, trying to get Vickers to make the first move, but then I blew the whole thing.",
        "Cole: What, he did something?",
        "Markko: No, he was on to her, so she started trash-talking younger guys, saying we don't know what we're doing when it comes to sex, and -- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring up, like --",
        "Cole: It's okay, it's not a big deal. You know, sometimes I wish I could go back and change everything between Starr and me to the way it was before.",
