        "Matthew is adamant about having Tea represent him in court and confident that she can get the judge to authorize for him to have the surgery that can make him walk whether his parents approve or not. Rachel admits to Greg that she owes him gratitude for saving her client's life yet tells him that he needs to convince Bo and Nora to approve his operating on Matthew. Nora goes to confront Tea when she finds out that she is representing Matthew. But Tea tells Nora that she is not listening to her son. At that point, Nora admits to Bo that maybe Tea is right that Matthew is not ok with his situation and would rather die than accept being in a wheelchair. Starr and Cole spend their last night together before he goes under cover. After Dorian finds out that Blair and Todd made the mistake of sleeping together, she tells Todd she has an idea about how he can win Tea over. Todd goes over to see Tea with a ring."

        "Bo: I don't think it'll go to trial.",
        "Nora: But it could. And if he wins, he's going to get that surgery.",

        "T\u00e9a: How ever did you guess?",
        "Shaun: Ms. Cramer used to do the same thing. We put every phone on an insurance plan, bulk rate. You might want to think about that.",

        "Starr: Yeah, but I'd be happy to keep peace in this house.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, rise and shine, huh? I have an idea. What do you say you and I go see Aunt T\u00e9a? That way, she won't yell at grandpa. Hmm? What do you think? You want to go out? Is that a yes? I'll take that as a yes, but we should tell your mom, or she'll freak out, okay? Should we go wake up Mommy?",

        "Clint: Yeah. Well, you know, there's a job in the diplomatic corps for our girl.",

        "Rachel: Well, it's nice that you have friends here. You know what? I'll just -- I'm going to let you eat in peace.",
        "Greg: No way. You like French toast?",
        "Rachel: I couldn't.",
        "Greg: Why, you on a diet?",
        "Rachel: No.",
        "Greg: Uh -- well, I am. So eat this before it goes to waste. Besides, I like the company.",

        "Blair: I just thought I'd come by and clear the air.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fumigate the cabana is more like it. I have nothing to say to you.",

        "Blair: Well, see, I can't speak for Todd, but --",
        "T\u00e9a: But you just did, Blair. You said, Todd shouldn't have slept with you. I guess that makes you an innocent bystander? I mean, of course, if you had been standing, as opposed to horizontal.",
        "Blair: Okay, okay. It was a mistake. I shouldn't have slept with Todd, and it will never happen again.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wait a second.",

        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You know, I didn't just come here to embarrass myself and grab free food. I wanted to thank you for saving my client's life yesterday.",
        "Greg: Oh, you don't have to thank me. That's what I do.",
        "Rachel: You should have seen Brendan's parents when they got to the hospital. They wanted to throw you a parade.",
        "Greg: Really? With confetti and everything?",
        "Rachel: I told them a thank-you letter would be enough.",
        "Greg: Damn. You killed my moment.",
        "Rachel: Will you be serious?",
        "Greg: Look, like I said, it's my job.",
        "Rachel: And you are good at it.",

        "Rachel: So you have.",
        "[Greg chuckles]",
        "Greg: Well, maybe you'd like to come watch me in my operating room sometime. Some real tools and some real work?",
        "Rachel: Well, I'm a little squeamish, but I guess I could get over it.",
        "Greg: Sure you could.",
        "Rachel: Well, then when do we set it up?",
        "Greg: Just as soon as the Buchanans agree to let me operate on Matthew.",
        "Rachel: Ah. So never?",
        "Greg: Don't be so sure of that.",
        "Rachel: I can't see them changing their minds. You can.",

        "Bo: I beg to differ.",
        "Nora: You know, honey, I don't think you understand what a big step this is. I mean, legally speaking.",
        "Matthew: There are precedents.",
        "Nora: And precedents? Did you hear that from a lawyer?",
        "Matthew: Not a lawyer, my lawyer.",
        "Nora: Okay. Well, did your lawyer also misinform you by telling you that it was easy to become an emancipated minor?",
        "Matthew: I'm not doing that. I'm suing for the right to consent to surgery for myself. I mean, it's my only hope.",
        "Bo: Son, do you think that your mom and I just stopped caring about you all of a sudden?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Bo: Then maybe you could try to see that we're looking out for your best interests.",
        "Matthew: You're just scared. Whatever.",
        "Nora: \"Whatever\"?",
        "Matthew: Look, just because you're my parents doesn't mean you're right. Parents screw up all the time.",

        "Todd's voice on intercom: I have no idea what you're talking about, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: I'll give you a clue. These sexcapades are over. Here and now.",
        "Todd: You've made rules of sexual propriety? With your track record?",
        "Dorian: You are hereby on notice. Don't you ever have sex with Blair again.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Cole: Shh, shh. Deep -- deep breath, okay? Quiet.",
        "Starr: Did you hear what she just said? My mom had sex with my dad! Ew!",

        "T\u00e9a: This is a moment to remember!",
        "Blair: No, no! Stop that!",
        "T\u00e9a: You're apologizing! Let's have it!",
        "Blair: I just said that it's not going to happen again, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't go blabbing it all over town that it happened.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're not very good at apologizing, are you, Blair? I didn't hear the words, \"I'm sorry\" in there.",
        "Blair: Like any of that is going to take away the pain. I saw how hurt you were.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you don't know squat.",
        "T\u00e9a: And I know that you're invested in Todd and this fantasy that you could actually have a relationship with him.",
        "T\u00e9a: You have no idea what I want, Blair.",
        "Blair: Oh, listen, I saw it on your face. Todd hurt you, and he was a creep for doing it, but that's how he is. That's who he is. I know that, you know that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't talk about him.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Let's get back to what a creep you are, Blair, huh? What were you doing with him?",
        "Blair: Well, Todd and I have chemistry, T\u00e9a, and sometimes it just erupts.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. And you're just a bitch in heat? You can't control yourself?",
        "Blair: I am not the one throwing myself at men who are not worth it.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, you're the one taking whatever she can get. Right, Blair? 'Cause John dumped you because he loves Marty. You feel sorry for me? You haven't been able to carry on a decent relationship your whole, entire life, so you keep clinging to Todd.",
        "Blair: No, see, I'm not clinging to Todd. He wants me, and you are never going to be first with him. You saw it yourself. Oh, that look on your face -- all the hurt, all the pain.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ugh! You mean -- you mean that look?",

        "Dorian: Blair did nothing of the sort.",
        "Todd: Would you like a blow by blow account?",
        "Dorian: You just keep it zipped from now on. Oh, baby.",
        "Starr: Arguing about s-e-x in front of the baby? Very nice.",
        "Todd: Hey, sweetie.",
        "Dorian: Hi, honey. I don't know what you think you heard, but --",
        "Starr: I heard everything. Every word. Mom and Dad in the cabana? Ew.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, I'm having the place fumigated.",
        "Todd: Starr, your mom and I had a little nostalgic --",
        "Starr: Dad, please, save it. I do not want to hear it, and neither does my baby.",
        "Todd: I don't think she understands what we're talking about.",
        "Starr: It doesn't matter. Come here. Hope is coming with me.",
        "Todd: Well, wait a minute.",
        "Starr: What? What do you mean, wait a minute? Look, you and Mom can try things again if you want, but your sex life is your business, and my sex life is mine.",
        "Todd: Your sex life?",
        "Dorian: Darling, what is that supposed to mean?",

        "Clint: I just wanted to give Nora and Matthew another option. Now it's all gone to hell in a hand basket.",
        "Viki: Did you really tell Bo you would find another best man?",

        "Clint: Well, Viki, I'm not asking you to fix anything.",
        "Viki: Well, that's good, because I can't.",
        "Clint: I'm just giving you a heads-up and letting you know that you and Charlie might be having a single wedding, after all.",

        "Clint: I don't know how we can get married with things the way they are.",
        "Viki: Well, that's true. So apologize.",
        "Clint: For?",
        "Viki: For acting as if Nora chose Bo over you.",
        "Clint: If you had been there, you would have seen exactly that.",
        "Viki: Bo and Nora listened to Dr. Evans and decided that was not the right way to go for Matthew. It wasn't about you. And it wasn't about Bo. If Nora chose anyone, she chose Matthew.",
