        "Starr and Cole are still furious at each other and neither will call the other even though both Langston and Markko want them to. Todd concludes to Marty that it might be better for her to go away and start a whole new life. But she wants to know all about the rape, how it happened and whom the rapist was. Dorian looks like she is having an \"epiphany\" to atone for her recent wrong doings. Blair reflects that she wants to have more in her life than her family and she might have feelings for John."

        "Starr: I'm sure you have a lot of questions about why I did what I did. And I'm hoping that I can help you understand that. I thought that I knew what love was, but, um -- but having you grow inside me -- it was the biggest miracle. And the hardest thing that I've ever had to do was to give you up. And even though -- even though I am giving up my right to be your mother, I want you to know that I have never -- I have never, ever given up on you. And I am trusting a wonderful woman -- a wonderful woman that I am hoping will give you everything that I know that I can't. Not just a house, but -- but a home. Your mother, the woman that has been raising you, I know that she loves you so much. She loves you just as much as I love you. And that's a lot. I love you so much, and I want you to know that -- that the reason why I did this was -- was not because I don't love you. It was because I do.",

        "Markko: On the house.",
        "Cole: Thank you. I need to start work again.",
        "Markko: Why? Dude, between me and the Buchanans, you got the total hookup. You know it's true.",
        "Cole: I want to start doing things for myself. I mean, I have to if I want to be there for this kid. I mean, everybody keeps trying to make my life easier. You know, paying for stuff, telling me what I need --",
        "Markko: Dude, you think I'm bad?",
        "Cole: I don't mean you.",
        "Markko: Just wait until Mr. Manning gets started.",
        "Cole: Okay, I know that Mr. Manning didn't get that order for my sake.",
        "Markko: No, nothing Mr. Manning's ever done has been about anyone but Mr. Manning.",
        "Cole: Okay, he still hates me. I get that. Whatever. Starr knows -- Starr says that he's just using me. But I'm not going to give up my kid because she's afraid of her dad.",
        "Markko: Maybe you should be, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I was raped?",
        "Todd: You know what? You're in no condition to deal with this thing right now. Shouldn't have brought it up.",
        "Marty: You think you're going to tell me something like that and pour a glass of wine?",
        "Todd: An awful thing happened to you. That's -- leave it at that. I mean, you know one of the blessings of this accident, your brain injury, is that you don't remember it.",
        "Marty: Look at you. Tell me. What happened?",
        "Todd: I just don't want to get into it.",
        "Marty: I see. I'm sorry about that, because I'd like some answers.",

        "David: You're offering me $10 million for what?",
        "Nora: All you have to do is convince Dorian to return control of B.E. back to the Buchanan family.",
        "David: $10 million? That's what you said.",
        "Clint: Yes.",
        "Nora: Do we have a deal?",
        "David: How do you expect me to accomplish this?",
        "Clint: You divorce Addie. In exchange, Dorian gives control of B.E. back to us.",
        "Dorian: If I can save Viki, you've got to put it in writing that you will leave my sister.",
        "David: $10 million.",
        "Nora: You just have to end a sham marriage.",
        "David: You wouldn't happen to have a plan B would you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mel, a word.",
        "Dorian: I'm not in a particularly good mood. It's been a long day, and good works exhaust me. You've been popping up here and there, and now when I need you --",
        "Dorian: Okay, the point. I did exactly what you told me. I saved the sainted Viki's life. And that cancels out any minor transgressions that I may have committed. All right. I did a terrible thing to Charlie Banks. But today cancels it out. Right? Right? Mel, I am talking to you.",
        "Woman: So? What do you have to say?",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry, but I was not addressing you.",
        "Woman: You said you were talking to Mel.",
        "Dorian: You haven't lost your sense of humor, have you?",
        "Mel: Is there something I can do for you?",
        "Dorian: The Mel that I was referring to is a man. And he's dead.",
        "Mel: I see.",
        "Dorian: So, yes, you are talking to a crazy lady. And yes, you should be edging towards the door, and yes, then you should run.",
        "Mel: Are you sure I can't do anything for you? You seem upset.",
        "Dorian: Mel? That's a funny name for them to give such a pretty girl.",
        "Mel: It's short for Melinda.",
        "Dorian: That's my sister's name. Mel was my husband's name.",
        "Mel: Hmm. Lot of coincidences here.",
        "Dorian: Indeed. A far less cynical person than myself might think that you were --",
        "Dorian: Some kind of messenger from the beyond.",
        "Mel: And that's what you came here for, a message from beyond?",
        "Dorian: I always think that one should tell the truth in a chapel. No, I came to broker a deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: There is no plan B.",
        "David: Oh, Clint. I'm an Einstein when it comes to these kinds of schemes. There's always a plan B.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, we don't have one.",
        "David: Amateurs. Oh, I'm sure between our combined intellects we can come up with something.",
        "Clint: Now wait a minute. Are you saying that you want to stay married to Addie?",
        "David: I'm saying plan B shouldn't hinge on me asking for a divorce.",
        "Clint: I didn't bring you over here to play games. Now, this is your one and only chance for the $10 million. Do you want it or not?",
        "David: Want, very much want.",
        "Clint: All right. Then the plan is you divorce Addie, and you take it or leave it.",

        "Gigi: I thought you were helping me count my tips.",
        "Shane: Didn't he tell you where he was going? I always have to.",
        "Gigi: Well, baby, he is not 10 years old.",
        "Shane: You've got about $14.75 in tips in quarters. That'll last me a whole day at Video World.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, that's exactly why I was on my feet nine hours today at the diner, so my son could rot his brain playing video games.",
        "Shane: Well, how much did you count?",
        "Gigi: Well, if we add this to what you got, we might be able to get a pizza tomorrow night for dinner.",

        "John: You got a problem with that?",
        "Blair: I should have called first. Sorry. I'll go.",
        "John: Could use the company.",
        "Blair: Good. I could, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Okay, how about we start with this. Did someone grab me off the street?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Marty: Someone stalking me?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Marty: Oh, come on. Tell me what.",

        "Shane: It's not like I made any of that up.",
        "Gigi: Uh, it's time for you to hit the hay.",
        "Shane: Come on, Mom. I haven't been able to hang out with Dad all night.",
        "Brody: Mind your mom. We got all day tomorrow to hang out. Thought maybe I'd take you swimming.",
        "Shane: All right. Night, Mom.",
        "Gigi: Night, baby.",
        "Shane: Night, Dad.",
        "Gigi: You going to be sober when you take him swimming tomorrow, or you going to pack a cooler?",
        "Brody: He'll be doing something, Gigi. He won't be living in front of the TV like he did when you two were in Texas. You know what? Maybe it'd be better if I just clear out of here.",
        "Gigi: That's not what I was saying, Brody.",
        "Brody: Look, I know I've not been making all the right moves lately.",
        "Gigi: Like taking off and not telling us where you were going? Shane was pretty upset.",
        "Brody: I won't do that again.",
        "Gigi: So where were you?",
        "Brody: I went to A.A.",

        "Starr: You know what -- wait. Um -- I have one more thing.",
        "Langston: Yeah. It's still rolling.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Starr: I know that people have a lot of words to describe the decisions that I've made, the choices that I've made. But I -- I want you to know that even though you were not planned, you were -- you were never a mistake. Never. I know that you are the best of me and your father, and I love your father. And I will love him for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm the father. The law's on my side.",
        "Markko: You think Mr. Manning cares about the law? That guy's psycho. He does whatever the hell he wants.",
        "Cole: I guess I'm going to have to do whatever I have to do.",
        "Markko: Dude, I got your back, no matter what. You know that. I just hope that you teaming up with Mr. Manning doesn't end up being the mother of all mistakes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So I knew the man who raped me. Okay. Was it date rape? Oh, God, tell me please it wasn't someone I was related to.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. No, it was nothing like that. In fact -- I'm not going to tell you anymore. I just -- I shouldn't have brought it up. You -- you need to get some sleep, okay?",
        "Marty: That's a good bedtime story. Thank you. \"Oh, um, you were raped by a person you know. Nighty-night.\"",
        "Todd: Sorry I said anything. Listen, I'm going to find something for you to put you to sleep.",
        "Marty: No, I don't want any more drugs. I feel like I've been on drugs forever. I just want to know.",
        "Todd: Why? Why now? Why do we have to talk about this now?",
        "Marty: I got to get back to my life, okay? I'd like to get back sooner than later.",
        "Todd: But you don't have to remember this. You've been handed a gift. You can start your life over again. Do it!",
        "Marty: Okay. Okay, but what about my friends? And, oh, I'm a doctor, so let's see, I go and I have patients, I've got colleagues, and everyone in this town knows what's happened to me, but I don't know? I don't think so.",
        "Todd: You need to know, even if it only is going to cause you pain?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You working?",
        "John: Uh, no, more like staring at these medical reports and accident histories.",
        "Blair: That's funny. I was staring at, um, a murder mystery, and I never even got to the murder.",
        "John: Ah.",
        "Blair: You know, the house is really quiet with -- with the kids asleep and all, and I don't know. Dorian's house can feel so big, and as lovely, as lovely as it is, it can get lonely, and - I don't even know why I'm here.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Blair: Actually, that's not true. I'm here because I wanted to see you.",

        "Clint: Wait a minute. You're trying to drive up the price, aren't you, Vickers?",
        "David: You never accept the first offer, do you, Clint?",
        "Clint: This is the first offer and the last offer. $10 million. Not a penny more.",
        "David: What time's it getting to be? Addie's going to be home soon. What's today? Thursday. Thursday's the day that I greet her at the front door wearing nothing but -- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs-- cellophane.",
        "Clint: I'm not budging.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: And why, after saving someone's life -- someone who, may I say, I have been irritated by since the very beginning -- do I have to be wrestling with my conscience?",
        "Mel: But you do, don't you?",
        "Dorian: How do you know that?",
        "Mel: It's why you came to the chapel. Right?",
        "Dorian: And I did not just save Viki Davidson's life. I rescued my sister, Addie, from a treacherous and vile con man.",
        "Mel: And you're still feeling guilty?",
        "Dorian: You know, I really find it arrogant that you should assume the role of spiritual advisor to somebody you hardly know, young lady.",
        "Mel: Call me Mel.",
        "Dorian: Please don't tell me you've gone to heaven and become a cross-dresser.",
        "Mel: You want to know what I think?",
        "Dorian: No!",
        "Mel: You don't need to talk to Mel or God or anyone. You know what's bothering you. And I think you know how to fix it.",
        "Dorian: No, I don't.",
        "Mel: I'm going off duty now. It was nice talking to you.",
        "Dorian: But you don't have to go. The shifts don't change for another two hours.",
        "Mel: Depends on the job. Good night, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Mel, you are working on my last frayed nerve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You went to an A.A. meeting?",
        "Brody: You're the one who said I needed to go.",
        "Gigi: I just didn't expect you to actually do it.",
        "Brody: Maybe you'll expect a little bit more out of me from now on.",
        "Gigi: So how was it?",
        "Brody: It wasn't my thing.",
        "Gigi: Oh.",
        "Brody: Gigi, I'm not like those people. They wake up in the morning thinking about their first drink. That's not my problem.",
        "Gigi: So what is your problem exactly?",
        "Brody: I haven't figured it out yet. The last few years, I've just been avoiding it. Now I promise, I'm going to deal with it so no one else has to.",
        "Gigi: Good. Because I can't really trust you around Shane if you don't.",
        "Brody: I'm not just doing this so I can be around Shane. I'm doing it so I can be around you, too.",
        "Marty: Okay, I understand that you're trying to protect me, and I really do appreciate that, but I need to know everything about my past.",
        "Todd: Not about this.",
        "Marty: Especially about this. Oh, my God. All right. Yeah, because if I was raped, that had a huge impact on my life. And I want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Usually when people come and see me this late, there's usually something wrong.",
        "Blair: Well, my life is no worse than usual. I just -- I felt like having an adult conversation.",
        "John: And you picked me?",
        "Blair: You listen to me.",
        "John: I guess it's better than talking.",
        "Blair: Would you stop it? You've been a good friend to me. I mean, really good friend. It's actually nice to talk to somebody who doesn't, you know, threaten me or want something from me.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Blair: Dorian's house is, you know, sometimes it feels so big and empty and then -- God, tonight I just couldn't get enough air.",
        "John: Excuse me.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "John: You coming?",
        "Blair: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I don't know what to say.",
        "Brody: You can't be surprised. I'm crazy about Shane, but you had to know he's not the only reason I've been hanging around here.",
        "Gigi: Brody, if I've given you the wrong idea --",
        "Brody: I'm not saying that. Gigi, from the time I said goodbye to you at that bus station and went away on my first tour, all I thought about was you and getting back home to marry you and start a family. That's what kept me going. And then my mother told me that lie about you running off with another guy.",
        "Gigi: What a bitch she was.",
        "Brody: In spades. I'll never forgive her for lying to me about you.",
        "Gigi: I'll never forget the day she told me you were dead. Even though she knew it wasn't true. All I could think about was what you must have gone through. All the way on the other side of the world, what had to go through your mind.",
        "Brody: You were broken up?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I was almost eight months along. All the plans you and I made, the future I thought I had, it was just gone. I couldn't stop crying. And I really couldn't stop thinking about you dying all alone. So, when I made up that story about you dying a hero, I didn't just make it up for Shane, I made it up for myself, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Do you think I should redo the video?",
        "Langston: I think it's perfect just the way it is.",
        "Starr: Well, at least when the kid sees me all red and disgusting, he'll be happy that he wasn't raised by someone as lame as me.",
        "Langston: Okay, this isn't working.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: You don't need me, you don't need ice cream, you need Cole.",
        "Starr: No. Oh, my God. Langston, put the phone down.",
        "Langston: Okay, this is stupid. You shouldn't be going through this alone, neither one of you.",
        "Starr: Cole is not alone. He has my father.",
        "Langston: Starr, you know your father. The pressure he put on Cole -- I mean, couldn't you try and cut him some slack? Try to forgive him?",
        "Starr: Okay, the problem is, is that that's not the problem.",
        "Langston: No?",
        "Starr: No, it's the other way around. Because I decided to give the baby away, Cole can never forgive me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, you want to shoot some pool or something?",
        "Cole: Markko, you don't have to baby-sit me.",
        "Markko: I know you. You're just going to go home and you're going to stare into space.",
        "Cole: No, see, now, that makes sense. Because when you win the big game, you party. When your life sucks, you stare into space. It just works that way.",
        "Markko: Well, there is something you can do, something that would really work.",
        "Cole: Markko, that's enough.",
        "Markko: You could call Starr.",
        "Cole: No, no, forget about it.",
        "Markko: Oh, oh, right, you know, you might actually end up making each other feel better. Can't have that.",
        "Cole: Okay, Starr doesn't want to talk to me, all right? She's too mad at me.",
        "Markko: Because you're teaming up with her old man. That doesn't say anything to you?",
        "Cole: This has been nice. I think I'm going to take off.",
        "Markko: No, dude, you're helping him get to Starr, the man who raped your mother.",
        "Cole: You think I forgot about that?",
        "Markko: No.",
        "Cole: Hmm?",
        "Markko: I don't know.",
        "Cole: Well, I haven't, okay? I never forget that. When I found out what happened, even when my mom told me she was okay, I couldn't sleep at night. But I found a trick that helped. I would come up with new ways to kill the guy. But I'd make him suffer first, just like my mom suffered. And if he hadn't been Starr's dad, I might have tried one of them.",
        "Markko: And you still went to him for help?",
        "Cole: He was the only person that I could think of that might be able to stop Starr from giving the baby to Marcie. Haven't you figured it out yet? I'll do anything, even use someone I hate, to stop that from happening.",
        "Markko: But you can stop it. Just don't sign away any of your rights as a father.",
        "Cole: Okay, well, if I do that, Todd will kill me. And if I don't do that, Starr will probably hate me forever.",
        "Markko: Ah. Dude, you made a deal with the devil, man.",
        "Cole: I know. There's only one thing that keeps me from going nuts. Todd can't hurt my mom anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There's really no reason for you to go through this again.",
        "Marty: There's every reason.",
        "Todd: All right, if you'll let me, I would like to, uh -- like to give you a new life. One where you don't have to deal with this again.",
        "Marty: You're serious?",
        "Todd: Yes, I'm very serious.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Surely you can see how sweet my life is right now. I mean, I'm married to a wonderful woman and I'm living high on Dorian's hog.",
        "Clint: Well, how long do you think Dorian will put up with you being married to Addie?",
        "David: That's the best part. There's nothing she can do about it.",
        "Nora: Who are you kidding? She's Dorian Lord, she took over Buchanan Enterprises. If she wants you out of Addie's life, nothing is going to stop her.",
        "Clint: You know something? You could find yourself back behind bars in Morocco.",
        "David: I hate couscous.",
        "Clint: Do we have a deal?",

        "Dorian: Mel, you were showing off just now. That stunt with the pretty nurse? Yeah.",
        "Dorian: But you ma your point. Okay. \"Do no harm.\" That is the solemn oath that I took. And I did great harm to Charlie Banks. And I lied to Viki about sleeping with him. Okay?",
        "Dorian: I hate it when you're right.",

        "Brody: Why did you tell Shane I was his father instead of Rex?",
        "Gigi: I had a choice to make. I could either tell him that his father was a guy who got me pregnant in high school and ran off without a word, or I could tell him that his father was a guy who loved us and -- and only left us because he had to go serve his country.",
        "Brody: That's a better story for a kid.",
        "Gigi: It wasn't really a story, Brody, because you were willing to take care of the both of us. To raise another man's child. Brody, you came into my life and you took care of me when no one else gave a damn.",
        "Brody: That didn't make me a hero.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, in my eyes, it did. And -- and Shane loved the story. That's why every time I told it, I would add a little bit more to it.",
        "Brody: Like what?",
        "Gigi: Like --",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "Gigi: Like you saving all of the guys in your company. Like you risking your life to save an Iraqi child. To hear me tell it, you fought that whole war all by yourself. And now Shane's convinced that -- that you were something that nobody could ever hope to be. So, I -- I guess I set you up to fail. I'm really sorry about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Look, all this stuff about the baby, I know, I don't get it. Don't want to. Don't even want to think about it.",
        "Cole: Okay, so don't. Go home, play space attackers. Blow things up.",
        "Markko: You and Starr, you should be going through this together.",
        "Cole: I tried, all right? She won't listen to me.",
        "Markko: No, she won't do what you say. That's not not listening.",
        "Cole: I'm tired. I'm going home, okay?",
        "Markko: Just -- just ask yourself one question. Is the baby really more important than Starr? Does she just not matter at all in this?",
        "Cole: Of course she does. You know that.",
        "Markko: Well, you team up with her father, and that's exactly what you're telling her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay, that was a mistake.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: I started to get upset about Cole.",
        "Langston: Started?",
        "Starr: I just handled this all better mad than sad, that's all.",
        "Langston: Isn't that a form of denial?",
        "Starr: Okay, denial gets a bad rap. I think that denial works for me.",
        "Langston: Starr, he still loves you, you know?",
        "Starr: Please don't tell me that. Tell me that he went behind my back at court. Tell me that he teamed up with my father. Tell me that he has not listened to one word that I have said.",
        "Langston: But, Starr, he did listen. He just doesn't agree.",
        "Starr: No, he -- okay, you know what? Fine, if you want to keep saying that to me, that's all good. The next time you want to make a video to my future child, stop by, but for right now, I would really like it if you got the hell out of my room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You don't have anything to be sorry about.",
        "Gigi: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Look at this mess I've dumped in your lap.",
        "Brody: Gigi, you're wrong about all of that. Look, I've been drinking too much since I mustered out. A lot of officers do that. I'm pretty much the man you and Shane made me out to be.",
        "Gigi: Shane thinks you're a superhero.",
        "Brody: I came back from the dead, didn't I? Isn't that what superheroes do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You are a jerk.",
        "Starr: Langston, don't.",
        "Langston: You're sad, okay? You have every reason to be.",
        "Starr: I miss Cole.",
        "Langston: Call him.",
        "Starr: Don't you get it, Langston? That guy in the courtroom, the one who teamed up with my father, that's not Cole. I just -- I don't know what happened to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You just don't get it, do you?",
        "Markko: Oh, really? You know I'm right. Call her, because nothing's going to work out right between you two until you are back on the same page. Call her and prove that you're not like her psycho father.",
        "Cole: Maybe I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Better?",
        "Blair: Much.",
        "John: Good. I could use a break anyway.",
        "Blair: What would you do without your job?",
        "John: That's a funny question. I don't know.",
        "Blair: You know, even when you were suspended, you were, like, still on the job.",
        "John: I guess it's all I got.",
        "Blair: There you go.",
        "John: Gives me reason to wake up in the morning, I guess.",
        "Blair: I guess it beats lying awake at night, wondering, you know, if your life has any meaning.",
        "John: I still do that. You?",
        "Blair: My kids, you know, they give me meaning every day, but it's been a long time since I've done anything that I'm actually proud of.",
        "John: When was the last time?",
        "Blair: Ah. I think when I was working as a reporter. You know what? I was pretty good at it, too.",
        "John: Yeah? What happened with that?",
        "Blair: Hmm. What happened? Todd Manning happened. He became my full-time job. Even when I went back to \"Craze,\" I couldn't give it the time that it needed.",
        "John: You had two kids by then, right?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. Two kids, now I got Sam. So, I'm a wife, a mom, a daughter, soon-to-be grandmother. Yikes. Huh. I don't have much time to be just me.",
        "John: Still a wife?",
        "Blair: Hmm?",
        "John: You said \"wife.\"",
        "Blair: I did?",
        "John: Yeah, you did.",
        "Blair: Huh. Old habit.",
        "John: Well, it seems to me now you have lots of time just to be yourself.",
        "Blair: I think the problem is I don't -- I don't really know who I am anymore. I think I've spent so much time being somebody to somebody else, you know? To Todd, to my kids, to my mom. Even Marty Saybrooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I have contacts, I have money and I'd like to maybe put you up in a place. It could be somewhere that's far away from here and -- and you wouldn't have to deal with anything or anyone from your past.",
        "Marty: How can I start a new life when I don't know about the old one?",
        "Todd: You know, what you're going through right now with this injury, compared to what happened to you when you were in college, this is nothing.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God. You were there. You were there for me when it happened. That's -- that's why this has been so difficult for you, because you're the one with all the painful memories.",
        "Todd: Not exactly fun for me, no.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: You said I knew the man.",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "Marty: Who was it?",
        "Todd: It was another student at L.U.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Do you know why he did that to me?",
        "Todd: He hated you."
