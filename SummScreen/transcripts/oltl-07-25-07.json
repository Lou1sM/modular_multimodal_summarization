        "Rex: Something wrong?",
        "Michael: You know Todd's still missing, right?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I heard.",
        "Michael: I hope that doesn't mean that he's found out what we've been hiding from him. Todd? Can you hear me?",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Michael: Do you-- do you remember anything?",
        "Todd: Oh. I want my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: We came as fast as we could.",
        "Markko: What happened? Langston said you didn't sound so good.",
        "Starr: Um --",
        "Langston: Oh, right. Um -- hey, how about that pool in the back that I was telling you about, yeah?",
        "Markko: Are you ditching me?",
        "Langston: Do you need a lifeguard?",
        "Markko: Fine -- go comb each other's hair. But just so you know, I was down to listen or cheer you up or give advice. Whatever.",
        "Langston: Aw, how cute.",
        "Starr: Ok, wait, maybe you can help me with something.",
        "Markko: Let her rip.",
        "Starr: My dad was stabbed and kidnapped and held hostage, and Cole knew exactly who had him and where he was.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: So now, what do I do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: Dr. Saybrooke? You have a visitor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I'd like the filet mignon, charred rare. No, the one with the shiitake reduction. And a side of haricot vert, no mash, and bread pudding for dessert. My name -- David Vickers, and I'm at -- a takeout blacklist? What is the -- well, Renee is just kidding. Are you aware that I just donated my liver, which reminds me -- I'd like the foie gras appetizer. Hello? Hello? Ah -- oh, good. I'm glad you're here. You're the law -- they'll listen to you. I'm going to call the palace back. I want you to tell them that I'm with you.",
        "John: You're right -- you are with me. Get dressed.",
        "David: What? My liver is regenerating. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "John: You're going on camera to tell the whole world you know who killed Spencer Truman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Where the hell could it be?",
        "Rex: Calm down, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: That racist piece of crap went in the garbage can -- I saw it!",
        "Talia: Is it possible your roomed it?",
        "Adriana: Layla -- why would she do that?",
        "Talia: Maybe she's being considerate taking out the trash. Maybe she didn't see it.",
        "Adriana: There wasn't that much stuff in there. She would've seen the medal and she would've flipped out like I did and called me.",
        "Rex: What if Tate came back and took it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Wow. This is beyond beyond. Vincent Vincent -- Vincent? Vincent! Wake up! Vincent? Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Adriana: Still not answering?",
        "Talia: No, it's going straight to voicemail.",
        "Rex: Listen, if any of your staff or you sees Tate Harmon, you need to call the L.P.D. and let the commissioner know, and don't let him see you doing it. Yep. Still a no-show at the TV station.",
        "Adriana: They haven't heard from him?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: Look, the more I think about it, the more I'm positive Tate came back for that medal. There's no way he could let it go.",
        "Talia: There's no proof of that. There's no sign of forced entry.",
        "Adriana: I let him crash here on and off for weeks. Oh, God.",
        "Talia: What?",
        "Adriana: What if Layla let him in?",
        "Rex: Call her, now.",
        "Talia: I'm going to check in with the station.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Vincent, wake up! Wake up, Vincent! Wake up! Wake up.",
        "Tate: So glad you could join us.",
        "Layla: Tate.",
        "Tate: But I don't want you messing up my handiwork, ok? So -- uh-uh-uh-uh. No, you don't! Oh, no, you don't! All right. I'll tell you something -- if u scream, I'll kill him, ok? If you try anything, I will kill you -- you got it? Nod your head like a good little girl.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tate: Yeah. We'll have you trained in no time.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Tate: Get your phone but don't answer it. Get your phone out. Do not answer it. Oh, right on time. Hello, boss lady. Nice to hear from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Michael? How does he look?",
        "Michael: Well, as you know, Todd sustained a stab wound to the abdomen. Now, judging from the amount of scar tissue and his state of healing, I'd say that it occurred about 12 weeks ago.",
        "Viki: Oh, God.",
        "Blair: That was when he was in Chicago.",
        "Viki: What -- what's his prognosis?",
        "Michael: I think he's going to be fine.",
        "Blair: Thank God.",
        "Viki: He's going to make a full recovery?",
        "Michael: Well, it's going to take time -- I mean, not just the initial injury that's -- that's bad, but the patch job that was done afterwards.",
        "Blair: Right. Well, can we -- we see him now?",
        "Michael: You know, I -- I think it's best if we let him wake up. You know, I'd -- I'd like to examine him, you know, interview him, see if there's anything we missed. You know, maybe he could shed some light on the toxicology screen.",
        "Blair: Oh. Why he showed up drunk and we found him with a prostitute in his bed?",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Blair: Yeah. John found him in a seedy motel.",
        "Viki: With a prostitute? Oh, come on -- that's not him.",
        "Blair: Well, I know. It doesn't, you know, make any sense, but I think it has something to do with the scam that somebody's trying to keep him away from his son.",
        "Viki: Well, I guess we won't know till we get all the facts.",
        "Blair: And we should have that very soon because Todd's going to wake up and he'll tell us exactly what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: John, my flat-footed friend, surely you can see I'm in no condition to move. I'm barely on solid food.",
        "John: You'll be a cheap date.",
        "David: Hmm -- flattering.",
        "John: Get dressed.",
        "David: No, I'm serious -- they cut me. I'm still healing. Jo: So we'll prop you up. You'll be like a network anchor.",
        "David: I'm not supposed to move.",
        "John: Oh, yeah? Well, it must've taken some movement to toss this. \"Viki Davidson\" -- very nice.",
        "David: Yeah, it was, till Clint wrecked it.",
        "John: Well, it must be some kind of record.",
        "David: For what?",
        "John: Alienating the parents of the girl whose life you just saved.",
        "David: You know what? You can leave and you can take your leash with you.",
        "John: Let me tell you something. Marty Saybrooke's in jail for a crime she didn't commit, so you have a choice. You come with me now, or I'll bring the cameras to you.",
        "David: Oh, no. I ain't getting my close-up under track lighting, sitting next to a bedpan.",
        "John: I guess you should put some blush on. I'll be right back.",
        "David: Don't you do that, John.",
        "Man: Relax, David. This is one threat Lieutenant McBain's not going to make good on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Cole saw your dad with his own eyes?",
        "Langston: He knew his whacked-out stepfreak was holding your dad hostage?",
        "Starr: And he didn't do anything. He didn't tell me and he didn't tell the cops.",
        "Markko: Nobody?",
        "Langston: He is so going to juvie for this.",
        "Markko: That doesn't sound like Cole. He's too straight-up, you know?",
        "Langston: \"Straight-up\"? Ok, I don't think you get how twisted this is. Starr's dad --",
        "Markko: Yeah, I know -- you already told me, remember?",
        "Langston: So Cole comes to town, gets with Starr, goes totally steroidal on her, then does this whole big thing about how sorry he is and how he's going to go straight.",
        "Markko: And he did.",
        "Langston: And then he tricked Starr into believing he loves her.",
        "Markko: Yeah, the dude does.",
        "Langston: Oh, and that's when Starr's dad gets stabbed and held hostage, and it turns out that Cole knew what's up? It's a total setup.",
        "Markko: He'd have to be a complete psychopath.",
        "Langston: It's happened to better guys. Remember Henry?",
        "Markko: Nah, I'm telling you Thornhart's not like that. There's got to be something more.",
        "Starr: There is. Cole's mom killed a guy, and he lied about that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Did you find the money ok?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Uh, you know that there should be enough for a couple of days, if you spend it carefully. Did you get something to eat?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I grabbed something.",
        "Marty: Well, you know, I don't want you eating out all the time, so, you know, you can get some groceries and there's -- there's really easy recipes --",
        "Cole: Mom?",
        "Marty: They're in the kitchen by the --",
        "Cole: I can cook, remember? Dad taught me.",
        "Marty: I know you're disappointed in me.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Marty: And you have every right to be.",
        "Cole: Mom, stop. That isn't it. Huh -- this is so wrong. God -- I could kill Miles for doing this to you.",
        "Marty: Don't say that. Sweetie, I know you are hurting. But I did something wrong and I have to pay for it.",
        "Cole: You killed a man who was going to rape Starr's mom. How is that a crime, huh? Can -- can anyone answer me that?",
        "Marty: Look, Cole, please. I haven't been charged with anything, ok? They're just holding me for 48 hours.",
        "Cole: And if you are charged?",
        "Marty: Then I will hire a lawyer and I will post bail.",
        "Cole: Oh, this is nuts.",
        "Marty: Please, sweetie, I -- I'm doing everything I can to fix this, and if -- and if it comes to it, I will hire the best defense possible, but -- but in the meantime, I need you to take care of yourself.",
        "Cole: I am.",
        "Marty: And I -- I know you're worried and I can't ask you not to be, but I need you to, you know, go about your life like you normally would. Can you do that for me?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Ok. Well, have you talked to Starr?",
        "Cole: You're the only thing that matters to me right now -- you and Miles Laurence.",
        "Marty: Please, I told you --",
        "Cole: Mom!",
        "Marty: Don't --",
        "Cole: He did this to us! All right? And if they set him free, I don't know what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: John, let me introduce you to my very expensive lawyer, Howard --",
        "John: Yeah, I know who he is.",
        "Howard: Oh. Are you a fan of trial TV?",
        "John: No. What? Did you -- you win the lottery or something?",
        "David: Oh, I know better than to skimp on legal representation.",
        "John: I didn't know the Statesville laundry paid enough to hire a bigtime defense attorney. Howard: Uh, uh, uh -- the clever Detective's on a fishing expedition, but it's not going to work. You're in a leaking raft in open water.",
        "John: And you're the Moby Dick of this analogy?",
        "Howard: My client's finances are none of your business.",
        "John: No, they're not, but, you know, the I.R.S. is always curious about new money.",
        "Howard: Well, I was hoping to avoid any unpleasantness, but I see you're determined to make this a dialogue of threats.",
        "John: Lay it on me, slick.",
        "Howard: Cease and desist the harassment of my client or you'll be working the nightshift with mall security.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You know, I -- I really wouldn't expect too much from Todd when he wakes up. We're not going to know the full extent of his injuries until he's fully conscious.",
        "Blair: Oh. And he didn't get help for a long time.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, I mean, what if we just went and sat with him? Maybe hearing our voices would make him wake up, huh?",
        "Michael: I -- honestly, I would prefer to let the I.V. do its job, rehydrate him, get him stable --",
        "Paige: But Blair and Viki aren't going to interfere with that. They can go in -- go ahead.",
        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Viki: Oh. Thank you.",
        "Paige: Let me see this. You're doing a good job handling Todd's treatment.",
        "Michael: But?",
        "Paige: Well, I understand you want to manage the family's expectations regarding his recovery, but don't overdo it. You know, there's room for optimism here. Todd is recovering. Blair and Viki being in the room is only going to speed up that process.",
        "Michael: And if I find something more serious --",
        "Paige: Well, then we will deal with it then. But you do want him to recover, don't you?",
        "Michael: Of course I do. He's my patient.",
        "Paige: Well, good. Because if I didn't know you better, I'd think you had a different agenda.",
        "Viki: You know what? I -- I -- I can't believe this. He's done it again. He's cheated death. Gone all these months and in terrible trouble and then, all of a sudden, he's here.",
        "Blair: Yeah. He's really here.",
        "Viki: Does Starr know?",
        "Blair: No, I haven't contacted her yet.",
        "Viki: We, maybe -- maybe it's better that you wait for news on his prognosis before you bring the children here, huh?",
        "Blair: Viki, do you think something's really wrong with him?",
        "Viki: Oh -- you know, Blair, he's a survivor. We all know that. I don't think he would make it all the way back here just to leave again.",
        "Blair: I just wish he would wake up and tell me what was really wrong with him.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Yak, yak, yak. That's all you guys are good at",
        "Michael: You know, I -- I really should go and check on Todd.",
        "Paige: No. You know, let Viki and Blair have their time with him. The monitors will go off if he's in danger. Is something wrong?",
        "Michael: I'm fine. Why do you ask?",
        "Paige: I'm just checking. You know, your shift is almost over anyway. Why don't you just punch out and I'll take over?",
        "Michael: I'm fine. You know, I'd really prefer to see this one out.",
        "Paige: Huh -- ok. Now I know there's something wrong.",
        "Michael: Why, because I love to do my job?",
        "Paige: No -- because the Michael I know would jump at the chance to go home to his wife and kid.",
        "Michael: With all due respect, my family -- my business.",
        "Paige: I can't have you treating patients when your head is not in it.",
        "Michael: Why are you so sure there's something wrong? You know, right? You know about Marcie?",
        "Paige: Yes, I do.",
        "Viki: Hey, can we get you anything?",
        "Todd: More of these drugs.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Viki: Hey, I think we'll leave that up to the doctors.",
        "Blair: You know, they're right outside. They said you're going to be ok, Todd.",
        "Todd: Ow, my head. Why do I feel so --",
        "Blair: You feel drunk?",
        "Todd: Well, no, I feel, uh -- hung-over.",
        "Blair: Well, uh, John found you in a motel heavily intoxicated with a prostitute in your bed.",
        "Todd: Really?",
        "Blair: Uh-huh. You remember anything?",
        "Todd: A hooker -- no, no. Everything else, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Cole's mom killed Spencer Truman?",
        "Starr: She's in jail right now.",
        "Markko: Oh, Cole must be freaking.",
        "Langston: You don't think Starr's freaking? Her dad's still missing.",
        "Markko: All I'm saying is it blows for both of them.",
        "Starr: Don't compare me to Cole, ok? He could've helped save my dad, but he didn't do anything.",
        "Markko: Ok, but his dad is already dead. You know, Cole is an only child. His mom is the only person he has.",
        "Langston: Why are you defending him?",
        "Markko: I'm not defending him. I'm just seeing it from his side. I mean, what would you have done?",
        "Langston: The right thing.",
        "Markko: Oh, and screw the only parent you had left? I'm just saying if someone threatened to take away your mom right now, you and your little brother would be all alone. Are you telling me you'd let that happen? I mean, yeah, Cole was wrong, but his back was up against the wall, man. Does that help?",
        "Langston: Like a kick in the head helps?",
        "Markko: I just think you should give him the benefit of the doubt. But, whatever. So, are you going to stay with him or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Look, I mean it, Cole. Do not do anything about Miles. I don't want to have to get out of this jail cell and then bail you out of juvenile detention. So, please, just let Bo and John do their job. Promise me.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I promise.",
        "Nora: Marty? Hi, Cole. I just heard the news. I'm -- I'm speechless.",
        "Marty: I don't know what to say, either.",
        "Nora: Are you holding up ok?",
        "Marty: It's not so bad. Everyone's respectful and I get my meals on time.",
        "Nora: Well, this is a fine mess.",
        "Cole: My mom didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Nora: You know what? Don't worry. I'm here, I'm going to help her get to the bottom of this.",
        "Marty: Are you -- here in an official capacity?",
        "Nora: Um -- no. Actually, so far, there's been no official decision whether or not to press charges, so --",
        "Marty: But you have my confession.",
        "Nora: You know, honestly, I'm letting Bo and John sort through all of this stuff, and until they come into my office with an official decision to press charges, I'm keeping my nose out of it.",
        "Marty: Isn't that unethical?",
        "Nora: Hmm, no, not technically. I'm not going to prosecute you, my friend. I won't.",
        "Marty: I know this is awkward for you and I would understand if you need to keep your distance from me.",
        "Nora: Ok, that's my decision. And frankly, the whole idea of you killing Spencer Truman -- or anyone else, for that matter -- just doesn't make a lick of sense to me.",
        "Marty: That's what I remember.",
        "Nora: Well, memory is a tricky thing. I can attest to that.",
        "Cole: Yeah, she's right. Why won't you let us believe you're innocent?",
        "Marty: Cole --",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Nora: There is something suspicious about all of this. And we'll just let Bo and John -- if there is, they'll -- Bo and John will definitely get to the bottom of it, ok -- guaranteed? Guaranteed. In the meantime, is there anything I can do for either one of you?",
        "Marty: There -- there is one thing.",
        "Nora: Name it.",
        "Marty: You can take care of my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: If I were you, I'd be more concerned about a client who hindered the investigation of a capital crime. You see, whether we like it or not, he's ours.",
        "Howard: Then charge him.",
        "John: Don't have to.",
        "Howard: As long as he's working for you.",
        "John: Now you're catching on.",
        "Howard: You violated my client's civil rights when you enjoined him to take part in your dangerous sting operation against his will.",
        "John: Sting? What sting?",
        "Howard: Precisely. There will be no operation as long as I'm here to stop it.",
        "John: Vickers was temporarily released under my supervision. There is no way he's free and clear.",
        "Howard: Just try to get him back into prison. You're the one who proclaimed his innocence on national TV. My client's a free man. You can't force him to risk his life to bait a killer.",
        "David: What he just said.",
        "Howard: Besides, you already have the real perpetrator in custody, a dr. Margaret Saybrooke.",
        "John: She hasn't been charged with anything.",
        "Howard: Why? Is she also in your employ, earning hard pay? I'm well aware of your illegal conspiracy with the Warden at Statesville to show David in this reckless manner. If you don't cease and desist, I'll expose your entire department in front of those cameras you keep clamoring for. Now, please leave and take that ankle monitor with you.",

        "Adriana: What did you do?",
        "Tate: Oh, nothing yet, but I got to tell you, it's getting a little boring here without you, so listen up. If anybody's hanging around, you are talking to Layla, not me, ok, and she's yukking it up about the filthy good time she's having with Vincent tonight. Comprende, chica?",
        "Adriana: Sounds like a great time.",
        "Tate: Ok. So now, I am rassling up the posse, ok? Just me and the creators of exposed on the roof of the palace hotel. Come quick and come alone -- no Rex, no cops, no one.",
        "Adriana: Got it.",
        "Tate: You might want to hurry, though, because the winds are just blowing around up here and, you know, I'm trying to hold on to your roommate. But with this bum shoulder of mine, a good, stiff breeze could just blow her away.",

        "Paige: Marcie came to me to ask me about fertility doctors, and I gave her a list of names.",
        "Michael: She ever come back?",
        "Paige: No, I think she didn't want the situation to be any more complicated than it already was. Listen, Michael, if you or Marcie need any help or advice --",
        "Michael: We don't. Thank you for asking. What I do need is for my boss to allow me to do my job.",
        "Paige: Understood.",
        "Michael: Then I have your permission to check on my patient, after which, I will be going home?",

        "Todd: That woman from the adoption agency, Mrs. Bromley, gave me an address of this -",
        "[Baby cries]",
        "Todd: Smelly, abandoned crack house. So I get there, and I hear this cry of a baby.",
        "Viki: Did you find your son?",
        "Todd: No, there was no baby there.",
        "Blair: Was it a tape?",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. How'd you know that?",
        "Blair: Because John and I found it right outside in the garbage of that building. And the police spliced it together so we could listen to it. So you know, whoever lured you to that building, Todd, must have had it all planned out.",
        "Todd: Yeah -- yeah, it was playing on a tape recorder.",
        "[Baby cries]",
        "Todd: So I -- I come into the room, and then the next thing I know, some-- somebody jumps me. I never saw the person. They were wearing a mask. The last thing I remember from there was this person standing over me with a knife. I passed out.",
        "Viki: Who would do that?",
        "Todd: The only other thing I know for sure is that I was walking through the woods outside of town, and I must have passed out again, because -- now I'm here. I don't remember --",
        "Blair: You're alive, though. You're alive.",

        "Langston: Amen.",
        "Starr: How could you even think that I would want to be with him after he did something like that?",
        "Markko: Well, because when we first got here, you asked us what you should do next. I mean, call me crazy, but why would you ask that if you were sure you did the right thing?",
        "Langston: She wanted to know how she could stick it to Cole. Ok, dumping him was good, but now you need to go in for the kill.",
        "Starr: No, Langston, that's not even what I meant. God, how did this all happen? Cole and I were so happy at prom, and now -- my dad could be dead because of him.",

        "Nora: Ok, first of all, I live in a mansion. He could have a whole wing. I wouldn't even know he was there. And second of all, this is not a conflict of interest. I told you, if anything official comes down, I'm going to recuse myself from the case.",

        "Nora: Of course.",
        "Cole: What, you don't trust me, mom?",

        "John: You got a problem, file a complaint.",

        "John: Why didn't you just hand this over in the first place?",
        "Howard: Well, where's the fun in that?",
        "John: Hilarious. I'll see what I can do about his release.",

        "Talia: She threw out the trash, right?",
        "Adriana: Huh -- yeah.",
        "Talia: I thought so. An A.P.B. is premature, but you two should lie low and stick together if you can.",

        "Adriana: She -- she and Vincent got into it, ok? He said things and she said things, and now she's on her way back over here and she's upset. She feels like a fool for ever having trusted him again. And she's going to feel like an even bigger fool if you're here when she gets here. Is that what you want?",

        "Cole: Because he knows the whole deal of your case.",

        "Marty: I love you so much for wanting to take care of me. But I am the parent, and I have to do what I think is best, and staying with Nora and Matthew is the best thing, and that's final.",
        "Nora: I can -- I can talk to John and see about having him keep Cole in the loop whenever he can, you know? Hey, and you -- don't you dare let my son trick you into playing night hunter three, because he's a shark. Deal?",
        "Cole: Deal.",
        "Nora: Ok, we should probably get going. I'll bring him by first thing in the morning.",
