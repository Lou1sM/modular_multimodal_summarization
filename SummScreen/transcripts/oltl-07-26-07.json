        "Marty: There's just -- there's nothing, ok? Nothing is coming back to me.",
        "John: Hey --",
        "Marty: No, I know, I was in Blair's room -- and Spencer was there and the murder weapon was in my hand.",
        "John: You know you woke up in thon-call room down the hall?",
        "Marty: Yes.",
        "John: And we've already established you suffered some sort of head trauma in the last six months.",
        "Marty: But we don't necessarily know it happened that night.",
        "John: No, but it's a possibility.",
        "Marty: Yes, yes, and it's also possible that it happened the night the arsonist bombed the hospital and the ceiling fell on my head.",
        "John: What's wrong with you, huh? Don't you want to be found innocent?",
        "Marty: Of course, I do. Of course, I do! I want that more than anything for myself, for my son. But what if I'm not? Because the more we go over this, the more guilty I look even to myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I almost found you in Chicago the last time I was there.",
        "Starr: Yeah, Mom got a tip from this girl who said that her boyfriend had you, and then she got right on a plane to --",
        "Todd: Let her tell the story.",
        "Blair: Ok, fine. That girlfriend of that punk that had you in Chicago turns out to be Sarah Roberts -- you know, flash?",
        "Todd: No kidding, that was Sarah?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: I thought that was a dream.",
        "Blair: No, it was real. She called me using your cell phone.",
        "Todd: Yeah, she said she reached you. She said that you said to hold on.",
        "Blair: I did.",
        "Jack: Daddy!",
        "Todd: Whoa, whoa, hey, hi --",
        "Dorian: The reunion wouldn't be complete without the entire family.",
        "Todd: Easy with the -- the gut here, buddy.",
        "Jack: I grew another inch.",
        "Todd: Oh, I can tell. I bet a lot has happened since I've been gone. But I'm back now, and things are going to be different from here on out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I am truly sorry.",
        "Viki: Oh, I know you are. But for what, David? For extorting money from Clint, or -- much more likely -- the fact that I found out about it, right?",
        "David: Both.",
        "Viki: Yeah, yeah, but I expect the 10 mil will ease the pain, right?",
        "David: Actually, it won't. Not anymore.",
        "Viki: Oh, and what does that mean?",
        "David: Here. Read it while I weep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I'm going down to lockup to interview Laurence. While I'm down there, I'd like you to upgrade Tate Harmon's status from person of interest to suspect, and put out an APB.",
        "Talia: Yep.",
        "Bo: The longer he's AWOL, the better the chances of Balsom's theory being right.",
        "Talia: That thing with the medallion doesn't sit right. But is -- is it enough for a warrant?",
        "Bo: I don't know, that's up to a judge. But we can't take any chances. If Harmon is affiliated with the O.P.P., That means that Balsom and Adriana could be in real trouble.",
        "Talia: Oh, I told Adriana that if Tate contacts either one of them to call us immediately.",
        "Bo: Good, good. What about Balsom?",
        "Talia: He's with her. And Layla was on her way home with Vincent Jones, so they should all be safe at the girls' apartment by now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Get out of here, get help!",
        "Tate: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! Step away from the door or she dies. Now!",
        "Adriana: I told you not to follow me.",
        "Rex: Yeah, good thing I did.",
        "Tate: Good. Now things can get festive.",
        "Rex: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Tate: Oh, you'll see soon enough.",
        "Adriana: Why are you doing this, Tate?",
        "Tate: It's my mission. Haven't you figured that out yet?",
        "Rex: I want to hear what this mission's about.",
        "Tate: You? You're even worse than them -- you're a traitor to your own race.",
        "Rex: Don't you want to convert me?",
        "Tate: Please, don't insult me.",
        "Rex: What? Are you telling me you were always this -- enlightened? Didn't someone have to show you the path? A lot of us are lost. We don't have a purpose. But -- but you -- you gassed Cristian's studio, blew up half a hospital, tried to bomb Lindsay's gallery --",
        "Tate: Get to the point, Balsom, now.",
        "Rex: You're obviously highly motivated, and the fact that you did all this with your dad -- I -- I wish my dad was still around to show me the ropes.",
        "Tate: No, he was unenlightened till the end.",
        "Adriana: But they caught him at the gallery.",
        "Rex: Yeah, with the bomb.",
        "Tate: He took the fall for me, you idiots, so I can continue my work. Although, if he were here, he would argue that.",
        "Layla: You mean your sick, vicious acts --",
        "Vincent: Ah-ah-ah-- Layla, don't start --",
        "Tate: Oh, good. Kunta's awake, he can watch. Stay where you are! You -- tie him up. Do it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Todd, it's good to see you alive and well.",
        "Todd: Since when?",
        "Dorian: Take it at face value, I'm not sure I can manage to say it a second time.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Todd: I got to make up for some lost time with you guys.",
        "Starr: Yeah, thanks to Miles Laurence.",
        "Todd: What's he got to do with it?",
        "Starr: He was the one that kept you drugged and locked up.",
        "Todd: I thought it was that hunter dude.",
        "Blair: Hunter was being paid by Miles. And when the weasel got tired of taking care of you back in Chicago, he brought you here to Llanview and dumped you on Miles' lap.",
        "Todd: So that lead that Miles gave me about my kid was --",
        "Blair: Yeah, it's probably bogus. And it wasn't just Spencer manipulating Miles from the grave. Miles knew exactly what he was doing.",
        "Todd: How do you know that?",
        "Dorian: You mean, aside from the fact that he is Mitch Laurence's baby brother?",
        "Starr: Oh -- and he was blackmailing Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Todd: Marty?",
        "Blair: Todd, Marty murdered Spencer.",
        "Dorian: She should be canonized.",
        "Blair: Oh, hardly.",
        "Todd: Wait a minute here, am I hallucinating?",
        "Starr: No, Dad, I know. And Miles forced Marty to marry him in exchange for keeping her secret.",
        "Todd: Oh, this -- ahem -- this is too much.",
        "Blair: I suspected him. I knew Miles was involved in your disappearance.",
        "Dorian: He's behind bars now, so he can't harm any of you.",
        "Todd: I hope somebody slaps him with attempted murder.",
        "Blair: Just an obstruction of justice -- for not turning Marty in.",
        "Todd: And what about me? What about what he did to me? Who's going to make him pay for that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Wake up, Laurence. Nap time's over.",
        "Miles: Hey, Commissioner.",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "Miles: You here about my release?",
        "Bo: Who's Kandi Lane?",
        "Miles: I don't know. Why?",
        "Bo: Because she was with Manning when we picked him up.",
        "Miles: Well, if Todd spends his time with hookers, it's not my problem.",
        "Bo: I never said the woman was a prostitute.",
        "Miles: Well, I mean, with a name like Kandi Lane, what am I supposed to think?",
        "Bo: Yeah. So how are things going in here? They treating you all right?",
        "Miles: So far.",
        "Bo: You know, I have to apologize for the food, I know it's really not that great. Is there anything, maybe, that -- that you'd prefer from the outside?",
        "Miles: Really? You'd be willing to do that for me?",
        "Bo: Sure. It wouldn't be a problem at all. I'd just send an officer out and pick up whatever you want, bring it back here.",
        "Miles: You know, I'm dying for one of those kobe beef burgers from the palace.",
        "Bo: Ah.",
        "Miles: You know, the one they serve with a fried egg on top? They charge you 25 bucks, but it's comfort food, you know?",
        "Bo: Hmm. Who's Jordan Ames?",
        "Miles: What? Excuse me, I --",
        "Bo: I think you know the one -- you know, hangs out in The Palace a lot, very classy.",
        "Miles: I don't know him.",
        "Bo: It's not a guy, it's a woman.",
        "Miles: Hmm.",
        "Bo: See, Kandi lane says that her friend Jordan Ames got Kandi the job with Todd Manning.",
        "Miles: Hmm. I don't know.",
        "Bo: That's all right. I guess I'll just have to ask Jordan Ames.",
        "Miles: Wait, is there anything else you want to ask me?",
        "Bo: Why, did I miss something?",
        "Miles: No.",
        "Bo: Ah. Take care.",
        "Miles: Hey, Commissioner?",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Miles: Could you tell Marty, my wife, that I hope she's ok?",
        "Bo: Laurence, I'll be honest with you. I don't think that Marty really wants to hear anything from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Listen to me. All we have to do is fill in the lost time from when you picked up the scissors until you woke up.",
        "Officer: I got your food here, Lieutenant.",
        "John: Hey, thanks, Sam.",
        "Sam: No problem.",
        "John: Look, I -- um -- I thought maybe you'd like something better than the grub they serve down in lockup.",
        "Marty: Are you always this nice to all the prisoners?",
        "John: Uh --",
        "Marty: It looks great, thanks. John, there's something else I need to ask of you. Look, I don't know how much time I might be serving.",
        "John: Look, I --",
        "Marty: No, I -- I have to be realistic, and I might not ever fill in the missing pieces of my memory. And even if I do, I'm probably going to be going to prison for an extended period of time.",
        "John: And?",
        "Marty: And I need to make arrangements for my son. So I'm -- I'm considering my options.",
        "John: Consider proving your innocence.",
        "Marty: No, John, please listen to me. Cole is very fond of you, and he looks up to you. You know, he really enjoys talking with you.",
        "John: Well, I like talking to him, too. You know, he -- he's a good kid.",
        "Marty: So, you know, I was just -- I was hoping that wherever he ends up, you know, that you might be able to look in on him from -- from time to time and make sure that he's ok.",
        "John: What do you want me to say?",
        "Marty: I want you to say yes.",
        "John: To what?",
        "Marty: To helping my son.",
        "John: Really? It sounds like what you're asking me to do is to help you give up. I won't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd Manning, you listen to me. There is plenty enough time for you to get back at Miles. Right now, it's important that you get to feeling better. You hear me? Oh, just in time -- I was telling Todd that he needs to get his strength back, right?",
        "Starr: How is he doing?",
        "Paige: Well, he's improving, but I need to see some test results to be more specific.",
        "Blair: How long do you need to keep him?",
        "Paige: At least overnight -- we're working on getting him a room -- so I'll check back with you later.",
        "Blair: Thanks.",
        "Todd: What is that?",
        "Dorian: Blair asked me to bring over some fresh clothes for you.",
        "Blair: I'm sure you'll want to burn the ones that you were in earlier.",
        "Starr: No, shouldn't he give them to the police -- you know, for evidence that they can catch the guy who did it.",
        "Blair: Starr, what's important is that your dad is home safe. Why don't you fill him in on everything that he missed, huh?",
        "Jack: Oh, and where you're better, I want a rematch on night hunter three.",
        "Todd: Oh. Think you're going to kick my butt, yeah?",
        "Jack: I knew you were coming back.",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Starr: Do you need anything, dad?",
        "Todd: Oh, how about one of those monster shakes from Carlotta's with the --",
        "Starr: Vanilla, right?",
        "Todd: Vanilla, with the whipped cream.",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Jack: Me, too.",
        "Dorian: All right, I love the flan. Come on, kids. We'll give your parents some alone time.",
        "Starr: Ok. Bye.",
        "Todd: Bye. Why don't you go with them, Blair?",
        "Blair: I'll wait until Dr. Miller gets back with your results.",
        "Todd: No, I need a nap.",
        "Blair: Ok. All right, well, I guess it's to Carlotta's diner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I don't understand, David. What is this?",
        "David: I'm having the money that I received transferred back into Clint's name. I had my lawyer draw that up. I'd take it to Clint myself, but -- as you can see.",
        "Viki: This is real?",
        "David: It's legal and binding. I don't want the money. Not if it changes the way you feel about me.",
        "Viki: To what do I owe this change of heart, huh?",
        "David: Your eyes -- the way you looked at me when I agreed to have the surgery. You admired me.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I really did. I thought I had finally seen past all that narcissistic facade. I mean, I always knew you were decent. But giving and self-sacrificing? David, you blew me away.",
        "David: Me?",
        "Viki: You. Yeah, you.",
        "David: And I blew it.",
        "Viki: Yeah, you blew it. It's not a very nice feeling to know that you've just been played all along, the way you play everybody.",
        "David: I never intended to play you, Viki.",
        "Viki: David, you -- you don't have to intend something to do it, you know. You know what hurts the most, I think? I -- I thought that we had -- I don't know -- some kind of mutual respect at least.",
        "David: Oh, we did, we do. I still do. I can't believe I messed this up -- I mean, I can, but I can't, you know what I mean?",
        "Viki: Yes, I do.",
        "David: You know, I don't usually care what other people think about me, but somehow with you, it's different. You make me want to be a better man. I'm pretty sure I stole that line from a movie, but it's true. Anyway, that document is genuine. The money's out of my hands.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "David: There's one more thing. Will you please forgive me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: This is a cozy little party, don't you think? You done? Good.",
        "[Vincent groans]",
        "Tate: Now, move over to the ledge, right over there. You, too, sister, scoot.",
        "Adriana: I'm so sorry, Layla.",
        "Layla: It's not your fault. Just be strong. We'll get through this, ok?",
        "Tate: Hmm. Not bad. You guys do this often? Excuse me, did I tell you to stand over here? No, I told you to stand over there. You got to learn how to listen to the man.",
        "Vincent: You're the man, huh? What kind of man lets his father take the rap for his crimes, huh? What kind of man let's his father die for you?",
        "Tate: The kind of man who understands what it takes to sacrifice in the name of freedom.",
        "Layla: \"Freedom\"? From what?",
        "[Vincent groans]",
        "Rex: From anyone who isn't like you, right, Harmon?",
        "Adriana: Tate, don't do this. We were friends.",
        "Tate: You were my cover, Adriana. Don't you get that? You bought me a free pass so I could do my work all over this town. All I had to do was make nice, and you just lapped it up, huh? You opened up your home -- you would've opened up your bed if I wanted that, huh?",
        "Rex: Shut your mouth.",
        "Tate: Or what, huh? Do you really think someone like me would want to be involved with something like you -- a mutt, a mongrel?",
        "Rex: You're never going to get away with this --",
        "Tate: I told you to shut up now!",
        "Adriana: No, stop it, please! Don't hurt --",
        "Tate: Get back! Get back where I told you! You want to save your friends' lives, huh? Ok, let's make a deal.",
        "Tate: I'd be willing to trade their lives -- for yours.",
        "Rex: Shove it, we're not making any deals with you.",
        "Tate: Three lives for the price of one -- what do you say?",
        "Layla: She says no.",
        "Tate: Well, I think it would only be fitting, don't you? I mean, you saving their lives after it was your vanity that exposed them to me in the first place?",
        "Rex: Adriana, don't listen to him, he's working you.",
        "Tate: Well?",
        "Adriana: What would you do to me?",
        "Tate: Nothing. You do all the work yourself.",
        "Rex: Stop this.",
        "Tate: Three for one -- final offer. What's it going to be?",
        "Adriana: What do you want me to do?",
        "Rex: Adriana --",
        "Tate: Step out onto the ledge.",
        "Rex: No!",
        "Layla: Don't do this. No, \"no.\"",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry.",
        "Layla: No.",
        "Tate: Good. Now, jump.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What's the status?",
        "Talia: I cannot reach Adriana Cramer. Both of her numbers go straight to voicemail.",
        "Bo: And Balsom?",
        "Talia: Same deal -- for him, for Layla, Vincent Jones.",
        "Bo: All right, send a unit over to her place. Also, send somebody to Balsom's and Vincent's places, too.",
        "Talia: I'm on it.",
        "Bo: All right, thanks.",
        "Renee: Hello, Bo.",
        "Bo: Hi, Renee.",
        "Renee: I'm here on a personal mission from your father.",
        "Bo: Is he all right?",
        "Renee: He's -- fine.",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Renee: He wanted me to put this in your hands -- Kentucky single-barrel bourbon, the best there is.",
        "Bo: Well, what's this for?",
        "Renee: Actually, your father didn't tell me.",
        "Nigel: I believe Mr. Buchanan has 10 million reasons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, Lord, do I wish that you had not demanded $10 million from Clint. But the fact that you're willing to give it back -- I don't know -- that -- that goes a long way.",
        "David: So --",
        "Viki: You're a child, David, you behave like a child. When children do something wrong and get caught, they're very, very sorry. But that's who you are, so I expect -- we can't expect you to be any different. Yeah, I forgive you.",
        "David: Maybe I could work on entering adolescence. So what do you think? You forgive me? I've learned my lesson.",
        "Viki: Oh? Which is what?",
        "David: Don't do anything to change the way that you're looking at me right now?",
        "[Viki giggles]",
        "Viki: Yeah, that's a start. I'll see that Clint gets this, ok? Oh, David --",
        "David: What?",
        "Viki: You didn't even sign it.",
        "David: What? I didn't know there was a space to -- well, look at that.",
        "Viki: Here -- here's a pen.",
        "David: Handy little buggers, aren't they?",
        "Viki: Hmm.",
        "David: Thank you.",
        "Viki: No -- thank you, David. I thank you.",
        "Dorian: Viki.",
        "Viki: Dorian.",
        "Dorian: I missed seeing you. I was downstairs -- with your brother in the ER.",
        "Viki: Bully for you.",
        "Dorian: Well. Would you, uh, mind telling me what that was all about?",
        "David: Yes, I would, actually. You're going to tell me that I've lost my mind.",
        "Dorian: Try me.",
        "David: I just gave back the $10 million.",
        "Dorian: You're out of your mind!",

        "Viki: Paige, everything all right?",
        "Paige: Yes, yes. Todd's condition is improving steadily.",
        "Viki: No, no, I meant you. You seem troubled.",
        "Paige: No, it -- well, uh -- actually, Viki, could I -- could I speak to you for a moment?",
        "Viki: Yes, of course.",
        "Paige: Thank you.",

        "Miles: Todd.",
        "Viki: You know, I understand that you have mixed feelings. But it seems to me that this is what you have to do, and if you don't follow your heart, you're going to begin to resent it.",

        "Todd: No, you don't -- you know what? Spare me. Don't play stupid with me.",
        "Miles: Look, you're obviously angry about something, but whatever it is --",
        "Todd: Spencer wanted me dead so he could be with Blair -- that I get, but what's your excuse?",
        "Miles: I never said that I was looking to hurt you or anything else.",
        "Todd: You stabbed me, you son of a bitch. At least, you had me stabbed. You made me think my son was alive so you could ambush me. Then when you got me, you drugged me up for months. Why, Miles? What did I do to you, Miles?",
        "Miles: I -- I never did anything to you, either.",

        "Nigel: Mr. Buchanan did have a rather extreme aversion to the late dr. Truman -- particularly after the man claimed to be his son.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, pa admitted that he had an affair with Truman's mother. You know, that DNA test -- it could've gone either way. It went in pa's favor, but the fact that he would put a -- a hit on Truman? That was based on nothing more than just pure meanness.",
        "Nigel: Your father is very grateful you have decided to look the other way.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, he wouldn't last two days in jail. But that's not why I did what I did. Look, Vickers did not kill Truman, pa never actually paid him off -- that was all dumb luck, but I can live with that. But if things would've gone in a different way, I would have done exactly what I had to do.",
        "Nigel: Understood, sir. And thank heavens it didn't come to that.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, in the eyes of the law, pa got a pass. But I cannot tolerate what he did. So as far as his, uh, thank-you gifts are concerned, I don't want them, Nigel.",

        "Adriana: Oh, God --",
        "Tate: And the liberal media will wring their hands and blame the sick hate group -- not just for your death, but for the traitor's death, and for Kunta and his Nubian Princess. Everyone will think that Kirk Harmon's associates targeted his poor son's impure friends.",

        "Rex: Do not listen to him. He's going to kill us anyway, he just said so.",
        "Tate: Well, maybe I won't. Can you afford to take that chance? So what's it going to be, huh? A quick, clean suicide, or carnage\"?",

        "Renee: Hmm -- about 7:30. Oh, and he's been so excited the last few days planning this. He wanted the perfect wine, very specific about the table decorations. He wanted everything to be just right for his guest.",
        "Talia: May I ask, was his guest Layla Williamson?",
        "Renee: Yes, yes, it was. What's this about?",

        "Dorian: Since when has the right thing to do ever been your motivation? Though, truthfully, it made me very unhappy to see Clint suffer that way.",
        "David: \"Suffer\"? The guy barely felt it leave his bank account.",
        "Dorian: It was the principle of the thing that mattered. His daughter's life was on the line, and you were putting a price on it.",
