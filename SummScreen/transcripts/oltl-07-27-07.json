        "Jessica: Nash? I want to go home now, ok, so bend the bars, carve me a gun out of soap to break me out of here, but please, please tell me I'm going home.",
        "Nash: You're going home.",
        "[Jessica gasps]",
        "Jessica: You're a liar.",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, it's what you said you wanted to hear. I --",
        "Jessica: Well, come here and give me a kiss.",
        "[Nash growls]",
        "Nash: Ow, ow!",
        "Jessica: Liar. Liar. Liar! Ok. Come here for real now.",
        "Nash: No -- you got an anvil or something in there?",
        "Jessica: No, I don't.",
        "Nash: Crazy -- nah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: All right -- would you just work with me?",
        "Todd: Ow! I'm trying to work with you. Tell that to the 80 stitches --",
        "Blair: Don't hurt yourself. Oh, 80? I think you're exaggerating -- it's only 79.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and if you weren't running around trying to strangle people, then maybe you wouldn't feel so bad.",
        "Todd: Miles Laurence deserves more than a little strangle around the neck.",
        "Blair: Well, I heard you would've killed him if somebody hadn't stopped you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, and he'd deserve it, too.",
        "Starr: Yeah, no doubt, but then you'd be back in jail.",
        "Todd: Whew. I'll guarantee you he's not going to bother me anymore.",
        "Blair: Well, just be still, ok?",
        "Todd: Well, you know, these stitches? They hurt and they itch.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? I'll go get Nurse Ratched and she could come here and scratch them for you -- is that what you want?",
        "Todd: Now, Starr, I know you don't think I have any idea what I'm talking about, but just think what would've happened if you were still dating Cole -- you were dating some guy who had Miles Laurence for an evil stepfather.",
        "Blair: Do, um, you want to tell him, or should I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I had Nigel make up your room.",
        "Matthew: It's right down the hall from mine.",
        "Nora: Oh, and tons of DVDs.",
        "Matthew: And it's got one of those dance mat thingies.",
        "Nora: Yeah. And you -- and you've got your very own bathroom.",
        "Matthew: But don't drink out of the French water fountain.",
        "Nora: It's a bidet.",
        "Matthew: And it's not for washing your feet, either.",
        "Nora: Ok, ok. Enough. Gosh -- uh, food. We should get you something to eat. Are you hungry?",
        "Matthew: Pizza.",
        "Nora: Pizza? Pizza -- is pizza good?",
        "Cole: Yeah, sure.",
        "Nora: Ok. Well, Matthew, why don't you order it up for us and I'll go check and make sure Cole's room is ready?",
        "Cole: Sounds like a hotel.",
        "Matthew: Don't worry -- you'll like it here. Hi, Henri. Yeah. Yeah, pizza -- yeah, pepperoni. Yeah, thanks. Ok, bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I remember. Oh, my God, I -- I remember.",
        "John: What do you remember?",
        "Marty: The night Spencer died. It's all coming back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tate: \"I am not worthy to live\" -- say it!",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Talia: Freeze, Tate! On the ground, now!",
        "Tate: Oh.",
        "Rex: Adriana, are you ok?",
        "Adriana: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Just give it to forensics, see what they have to say. Right. I want you to hold all my calls, all right? I don't want to be disturbed.",
        "Paige: What if something important happens?",
        "Bo: This -- this is important. I mean, you come in here and you tell me like that -- that you're going to leave town and I'm supposed to say, \"ok, honey, just hold that thought.\" Ok? No. What happened, Paige?",
        "Paige: I got a call from doctors without borders.",
        "Bo: I thought that you already decided that you weren't going to do that.",
        "Paige: After I sent in the application.",
        "Bo: How long ago was that?",
        "Paige: Couple of months.",
        "Bo: Well -- but you did tell them that you weren't interested anymore, right?",
        "Paige: Yes, I did, but they must've processed the application anyway. They told me that they got a grant to open a clinic in Hindu Kush, and they want me to head the whole start-up operation. I don't want to leave, but I -- I feel like I need to do this.",
        "Bo: Ok. How long will it take?",
        "Paige: I've given this a lot of thought.",
        "Bo: No -- how long?",
        "Paige: It's open-ended.",
        "Bo: Well, then, the -- the question still remains. When are you going to come back?",
        "Paige: Maybe the question should be, \"will I ever come back?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: All right, I talked to Dr. Harrison --",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nash: And he said that you're doing really well, you're doing great, and that --",
        "Jessica: But I need more tests and they need to make sure that the immuno- suppressants are working and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I've heard it all before.",
        "Nash: Sorry I couldn't tell you what you want to hear.",
        "Jessica: Not as sorry as I am.",
        "Nash: You're going to get out of here soon.",
        "Jessica: Not soon enough.",
        "Nash: Hey, I got some good news. Your uncle Todd -- he's back, and he's alive and he's going to be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, I'm on pins and needles here. Somebody better cough up something pretty fast.",
        "Starr: Ok, fine, I'll tell you, but you better not freak. Cole and I --",
        "Todd: The next words out of your mouth better be \"can't stand each other.\"",
        "Starr: We were in a musical together at school. We barely had any scenes, we didn't even talk.",
        "Todd: Little ingrate can sing, eh?",
        "Blair: Starr?",
        "Starr: Mom, it's only going to make matters worse.",
        "Todd: Now I'm really interested.",
        "Blair: Ok, well, how long do you think you're going to keep your brother from blabbing it?",
        "Todd: Starr, if you don't want to make matters worse, you better fess up.",
        "Starr: While you were gone --",
        "Todd: You mean, while I was on vacation? With a festering knife wound and --",
        "Starr: Cole --",
        "Todd: Garbage heaps --",
        "Starr: Dad!",
        "Todd: Yes?",
        "Starr: Cole and I got back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Pepperoni's cool, right?",
        "Cole: Yeah, sure.",
        "Matthew: He said about 40 minutes. You want to -- you want to play a video game until it gets here?",
        "Cole: Uh -- no, actually, I was warned about that, so no, thanks.",
        "Matthew: How about -- ooh, how about some basketball? You play basketball?",
        "Cole: You know, maybe later. Hey, listen, I know you're trying to entertain me and all, but you don't have to. You know, it's ok -- I can just hang out for a while.",
        "Matthew: Oh, I'm sorry. Am I annoying you?",
        "Cole: No. No, no, that -- that's not it. I -- I'm just -- just trying to figure everything out, you know?",
        "Matthew: Can \u0096 can I say something?",
        "Cole: Yeah, of course.",
        "Matthew: Don't try so hard. My mom was in the hospital most of last year. I never got used to not having her around. I -- I pretended like nothing was wrong. Kind of like I was tricking into believing that. But one day, I just said, \"you know what? Things are going to be like this for a while.\" And before I knew it, she got better and came home.",
        "Cole: Hmm. That's -- that's probably good advice.",
        "Matthew: I don't think you're going to have to wait nearly as long for your mom as I did.",
        "Cole: Well, I hope you're right, Matthew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ok. Sit down, all right? You want me to get you some water? You want me to call Dr. Young or something?",
        "Marty: No, I -- I just need to say this before I lose my nerve or forget it completely.",
        "John: You sure?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Grab hold. Here, reach.",
        "Tate: Yeah, I can't. My shoulder --",
        "Talia: Come on, try!",
        "[Tate groans]",
        "Tate: God! Help -- help me. You know, if I fall, I'm going to die.",
        "Talia: You're not going anywhere. No way am I going to let you be an O.P.P. martyr! Jones, get over here. I can't reach him.",
        "Vincent: You mean that bastard's still alive? Well, well, well. Would you look at that?",
        "Talia: My arms aren't long enough.",
        "Vincent: You know, I just hope he doesn't land on innocent people.",
        "Talia: I called for backup on my way over here, but they're still five minutes out.",
        "Tate: I can't hold on that long!",
        "Vincent: Uh-oh.",
        "Tate: Ah!",
        "Talia: He'll fall and he'll die unless you can pull him up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Will you \"ever\"? You -- you make it sound like you'll never come back.",
        "Paige: I can't say for sure.",
        "Bo: Honey, I thought we were -- I thought we -- we had something. You know, it seems we -- that we were really going to make a go at it. I -- that's what I thought. Was I that wrong?",
        "Paige: Oh. You weren't wrong.",
        "Bo: Ok, then, you know what? I'm lost. I'm lost, I don't know what happened. All of a sudden, one day, without any warning at all, you come in here and you tell me that you are going to be leaving town and you're going to be going to a place that I've barely -- I've barely even heard of this place.",
        "Paige: Hindu Kush?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paige: It's on the northern border of Pakistan near Afghanistan.",
        "Bo: Oh, God. Oh, you know what? That happens to be one of the most dangerous places in this world right now, not to mention the fact that it's halfway around the world. That makes for a -- a very, very distant relationship. Paige, I don't -- I don't know that that can actually work.",
        "Paige: I know.",
        "Bo: Then what? Was it something I did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What is he doing here? What happened to him?",
        "Nash: He got stabbed.",
        "Jessica: Where?",
        "Nash: In Chicago.",
        "Jessica: No! Where on his body did he get stabbed?",
        "Nash: I -- come -- ow! I -- I don't know, all right? But it -- it doesn't matter. Come on, Todd -- he's going to be ok. He's got a thick hide. It'd take a lot to puncture that hide of his.",
        "Jessica: Well, who's with him?",
        "Nash: Uh -- when I went by the emergency room, it looked like pretty much your whole family was there, so don't worry. Blair is going to make sure he's ok.",
        "Jessica: Does my mom know?",
        "Nash: She was there, so, yeah.",
        "Jessica: Good. Good. She needs some good news.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. So do you think they're going to let me see him?",
        "Nash: You a flight risk?",
        "Jessica: Huh. No, I'm not -- I think that's more Todd's style, not mine. Besides, recuperating in bed is exhausting.",
        "Nash: Well, it will make it all the sweeter when you get out of here and go home.",
        "Jessica: When I get home to my family -- normal family, just like everybody else dreams of.",
        "Nash: \"Normal family\" -- wait a minute. First of all, we are not like everybody else, and nothing about us is normal.",
        "Jessica: I guess it's not.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jessica: And I wouldn't have it any other way. But I think that you could stand some conventional for a little while, couldn't you?",
        "Nash: \"Conventional\"?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nash: Hmm. Like what?",
        "Jessica: Like honeymoons, paying bills --",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jessica: Preschool applications.",
        "Nash: Yay.",
        "[Jessica laughs]",
        "Jessica: Oh, more tests.",
        "Nash: More tests -- come on.",
        "Nurse: More tests.",
        "Jessica: Boo.",
        "Nash: Let you go.",
        "Jessica: Ooh.",
        "Nash: You want conventional, I'll show you conventional.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know, you promised me. You promised me.",
        "Starr: Yes, Dad --",
        "Todd: You promised me over --",
        "Starr: Yes, I know!",
        "Todd: And over again that you would never see this jerk again.",
        "Starr: Do you hear me arguing with you?",
        "Blair: Ok. You know what?",
        "Todd: I see, so -- I see.",
        "Blair: Don't be a smart aleck.",
        "Todd: So if I'm laid up with a knife wound in some maggot-infested flophouse, it's ok for you to disobey me?",
        "Starr: Don't start popping stitches, Dad!",
        "Todd: I want an answer from you!",
        "Starr: You're making it sound so -- it's not even the way that it happened!",
        "Todd: Well, you've been behind our backs with this guy before, haven't you? But I guess if -- if I'm out of commission, it makes it easier. Is that right?",
        "Starr: You never listen to me.",
        "Todd: Should I listen to you? Should I trust what you say? Maybe I should listen to your mother -- did you catch her sneaking around with this guy?",
        "Blair: Um --",
        "Starr: She gave us her blessing.",
        "Blair: Not exactly.",
        "Todd: Is that right? That's fantastic. So here we are, trying to make decisions about raising our children together. That's just fantastic.",
        "Blair: Ok, but don't --",
        "Todd: What's this crap -- what is this crap about united parenting?",
        "Blair: Would you listen to me a minute? You know, you weren't here as I recall, and don't think that I didn't think about going looking for you because that's all I did -- I was obsessed with it. But, Todd, you didn't have to listen to our daughter every single night cry herself to sleep because -- because she missed her father again. And then, she couldn't talk to the boy she loved about it.",
        "Todd: Oh -- \"love.\"",
        "Blair: No, Todd, you would've changed your mind, too.",
        "Todd: Give me a break. \"Love\" -- she's a kid. She doesn't know anything about love yet.",
        "Starr: Don't even act like I don't know what love is!",
        "Blair: She was miserable, Todd. I thought it would help her through the whole ordeal if she had a shoulder to lean on.",
        "Todd: What's wrong with your shoulder?",
        "Blair: It was off looking for your shoulder!",
        "Todd: Did you stop to think about how I might feel about it?",
        "Blair: What do you think, Todd? Come on! You know what I did? I finally put our daughter's happiness above your pride, and you think it's funny.",
        "Starr: I don't even know why you guys are arguing so much. It's not even that big of a deal.",
        "Todd: Actually, I think it is a big deal.",
        "Starr: No, it's not because Cole and I broke up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Let's start from the beginning.",
        "Marty: You already know most of it.",
        "John: Let's hear it again -- for the record this time.",
        "Marty: Ok. Um -- I was looking for Cole because he had missed his community service. I -- I went to the park to look for him, but he wasn't there, so I thought that maybe he would be at the hospital with Starr.",
        "John: And you said you didn't think anyone saw you at the park or the hospital. Is that still how you remember it?",
        "Marty: Yes. Yeah, I -- I remember seeing Rex and Dr. Miller. They -- they were arguing, I think, but they -- they didn't see me.",
        "John: Ok. Afterwards, you told me you took the stairs to Blair's room.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Yeah, I didn't want to wait for the elevator.",
        "John: Then what happened?",
        "Marty: Then I went down the hall to Blair's room and I could hear something going on inside, but I couldn't tell what it was. So I pushed the door open, then went in, but the curtain -- it was drawn, so I -- I had to go all the way inside and -- and Blair was there on the bed, and she was in her wedding dress. And Spencer was on top of her. She was struggling, but I could tell -- it was obvious that she had been drugged.",
        "John: Then what happened?",
        "Marty: Then I knew I had to stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Vincent, please. I can't reach him. I need your help.",
        "Tate: Well?",
        "Tate: Please. I can't hold on. Help me! I'm slipping. Please.",
        "Tate: Ah!",
        "[Vincent groans]",
        "Tate: Ah -- ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah! Ow, my shoulder!",
        "Talia: After all the pain you caused --",
        "[Tate groans]",
        "Talia: Do you really think I give a damn?",
        "Tate: Ah!",
        "Talia: This is Officer Sahid. The perp is under control. We need medical assistance ASAP. Repeat, medical assistance ASAP. We are on The Palace hotel rooftop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So your romance with the steroid king only lasted a couple of weeks, huh?",
        "Starr: Yes.",
        "Todd: Good. Did you break it off with him?",
        "Starr: Yes, Dad, I broke it off with him.",
        "Todd: Good. Now, that's my girl.",
        "Starr: Oh. Todd just another in a long line of Starr Manning roadkills. Oh, wait a minute. Did he -- did he do something to you? Did he hurt you? Is that why you broke it off?",
        "Starr: Dad, are you kidding me? Why would that even matter? We broke up!",
        "Todd: Because I'm your father -- that's why it matters. If he hurt you, if he even laid a finger on you, I'm going to be pissed off!",
        "Blair: Hey, hey. Don't look at me, Starr.",
        "Todd: I want answers right now.",
        "Starr: Cole found out that Miles was holding you captive and he kept it a secret.",
        "Todd: Huh -- what?",
        "Starr: Only for a couple of days, and then he told everyone.",
        "Todd: Is that right? Wow. So I'm just lying there bleeding to death and --",
        "Starr: Dad?",
        "Todd: Crawling through the woods and he said nothing?",
        "Starr: Dad, he didn't lie --",
        "Todd: Lying little son of a bitch.",
        "Starr: Dad, he did not lie. He just didn't say anything.",
        "Blair: Yep. She is the spin doctor, just like her daddy.",
        "Todd: Oh, ok. Well -- huh-huh -- it's a good thing you're not going out with him again.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry -- do you guys want me to tell you about lies and liars, because you guys do it all the time. How do you even know what the truth is anymore? Do you want me start listing things?",
        "Todd: Hey, hey -- cool it now!",
        "Blair: Ok, that's enough.",
        "Starr: Cole did that to help his mom because he loves her -- unlike hurting her like you guys do. Cole wanted to protect his mom from Miles the psycho. And I would've done the same thing for you two even though you don't deserve it half of the time.",
        "Todd: She's a teenager.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You know, you got some wisdom little dude. Hey, if there's anything I can do for you, you just let me know, all right?",
        "Matthew: Well, actually, there is something down at the country club.",
        "Cole: All right -- what's her name?",
        "Matthew: What makes you think it's a girl?",
        "Cole: Because I'm not the guy that can help you with your golf swing.",
        "Matthew: Ok, you got me -- it is a girl.",
        "Cole: Ok, well, in that case, you should probably ask your dad because apparently I'm not too good with women.",
        "Matthew: I thought you and Starr were boyfriend and girlfriend.",
        "Cole: Right -- \"were.\"",
        "Matthew: What happened?",
        "Cole: It's complicated.",
        "Matthew: Screwed up, huh?",
        "Cole: Oh. Uh, yeah -- bigtime.",
        "Matthew: Well, did you at least say you were sorry?",
        "Cole: Oh, yeah.",
        "Matthew: Well, I'm really close with Starr. If you want, I can give you some props and give her a little call and tell her what she's missing and how cool you are.",
        "Cole: Really? Well, thanks.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nora: Hey. How's he doing? How's things going?",
        "Matthew: Kind of rough.",
        "Nora: Well, he's very lucky to have a friend like you to help him through it.",
        "Matthew: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Nora: Come here, you. Oh.",
        "Cole: Hey, I -- I was just thinking about you.",
