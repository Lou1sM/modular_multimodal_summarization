        "Renee talks to Madam Delphina who tells her that Asa has some \"plans\" and is unsettled about the decisions that family members have made. He tells her that Asa believes that one should go back to their original spouse and not think they can find a new one. At the lodge strange things happen. A banner mistakenly names Viki and Clint as one couple and Bo and Nora as the other. Jessica is remembering Nash and senses that Asa does not want her to move on. Matthew can sense Asa's presence and knows his grandfather would encourage him to go after what he wants regardless of what it involves. Bo admits to Rex that he's unsettled with his brother marrying Nora. Rex and Gigi tells Stacy that it's all over for her. But she reveals to them that she is pregnant with Rex's baby."

        "Brody: What do you think?",
        "Natalie: Maybe a little higher.",
        "Jared: That's where it was 10 minutes ago.",
        "Jessica: Oh, we just want everything to be perfect.",
        "Brody: Here?",
        "Natalie: Um, I don't know. Can you try it to the right?",
        "Jessica: Ooh, yeah.",
        "Jared: Yeah. How about now?",
        "Natalie: Perfect. Yeah, yeah. Great.",
        "Jared: Perfect.",
        "Brody: Heh heh heh.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "Jared: What?",
        "Brody: Should we move it back?",
        "Natalie: That's supposed to say, \"Viki & Charlie and Nora & Clint.\"",
        "Jared: Oh, my God.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Brody: Maybe nobody'll notice.",
        "Jessica: Uh, yeah, right.",
        "Natalie: How did this happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Renee: I'm sure. I have to talk to Asa.",
        "Delphina: You know, trying to contact someone who's moved on to another plane --I should warn you, this could be painful.",
        "Renee: I have to try.",
        "Delphina: Well...",
        "Renee: The family planned a party tonight at his lodge.",
        "Delphina: And you didn't want to go?",
        "Renee: I told them that I wasn't feeling well, but the truth is, I just miss him so much. Do you think you're going to be able to reach him for me?",
        "Delphina: Well, as my granny used to say, we never know until we try.",
        "[Renee chuckles]",
        "Delphina: Ahem, Asa... Asa Buchanan... Asa Buchanan, will you step up? Your wife would like to speak to you. Oh. Uh--",
        "Renee: What happened? Did you hear him already?",
        "Delphina: He said, \"Don't bother me now, woman. I'm trying to set things right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't know how this happened.",
        "Jessica: Maybe the printer just mixed up the names.",
        "Natalie: If he did that, then it would say, \"Nora & Charlie.\" I mean, how did Bo even get on there?",
        "Brody: You think it's someone who knew they were married?",
        "Natalie: Well, I mean, was it a joke, I mean, some sick idea of a joke?",
        "Jared: Look. It was probably just a mistake.",
        "Jessica: Stranger things have happened, I guess.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Our parents having a double wedding, to other people, is strange enough. We have got to get this down before m--",
        "Jared: Too late. Ahem.",
        "Viki: Hi.",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Clint: All right, all right. What have you kids got cooked up here?",
        "Natalie and Jared: Nothing.",
        "Clint: No. Get away. Let us see it. We're here.",
        "Nora: Come on.",
        "Viki: Come on.",
        "Clint: Well, the evening is off to a great start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Gigi doesn't know you had sex with her sister?",
        "Rex: And as long as I have anything to say about it, she never will.",
        "Bo: Oh...you don't want to tell her.",
        "Rex: What for? What's the point? It's never gonna happen again.",
        "Bo: What, you're afraid she won't forgive you?",
        "Rex: No. It's not that.",
        "Bo: Well, then, Balsom, tell her the truth. Tell her you made a huge mistake, but now--",
        "Rex: Okay. Look. I know that I am far from perfect, but this is not on me. It's Gigi's fault I had sex with Stacy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I am offering you a deal. Leave town, and I don't press charges.",
        "Stacy: You really want to see your little sister out on the streets.",
        "Gigi: I told you, it's because you're my sister that I'm even willing to make this deal.",
        "Stacy: No, I don't think so. I think it's because you're afraid of me.",
        "Gigi: Oh, Stacy, I have nothing to be afraid of.",
        "Stacy: You sure about that?",
        "Gigi: You tried to destroy my life. You tried to use Shane's life to come between Rex and me, but it didn't work. You can't hurt me.",
        "Stacy: Oh, no?",
        "Gigi: The only person you can hurt now is yourself, so if you don't want to do that, leave town and never come back.",
        "Stacy: You know, you're not listening, Geeg. You've got plenty to be afraid of. Don't you believe me?",
        "Gigi: Why the hell should I?",
        "Stacy: Because it's right here in black and white. I have everything I need to make your life miserable forever and ever and ever.",
        "Gigi: What is that, like, a \"get out of jail free\" card for 18 months?",
        "Stacy: More like a \"Stay in Llanview\" card for the next 18 years.",
        "Gigi: What the hell are you talking about? What is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: \"Nora & Bo,\" huh? Seriously?",
        "Nora: Okay. Obviously, somebody made a mistake.",
        "Charlie: Well, at least you rate a mention. My name is not even on the thing.",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie.",
        "Jared: You know what? Who needs a stupid banner?",
        "Natalie: Look, guys, I swear to you, I went over all of this with the printer.",
        "Viki: Honey, don't worry about it. No one is blaming you.",
        "Natalie: No, but I mean, I talked to the guy at least 5 times. I had to take the \"C\" out of \"Vicki,\" the \"H\" out of \"Norah,\" and I sure as hell never said, \"Bo.\"",
        "Clint: Natalie, it's all right. We know it's not your fault.",
        "Natalie: Well, I'm gonna find out whose fault it is.",
        "Jared: Natalie, let's--",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm gonna get us some refreshments.",
        "Jessica: We'll come with you. Heh.",
        "Viki: The lodge looks beautiful.",
        "Nora: Yes. They did a wonderful job, didn't they?",
        "Viki: I haven't been here in ages.",
        "Clint: Awful lot of poker has been played here.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Nora: I always felt that if Asa's ghost were to inhabit a place, it would be here.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Well, this is where he came to do all of his thinking and do all of his planning. And, oh, by God, he would've gotten a big laugh out of that banner.",
        "Nora: Okay, Clint. Enough with the banner, all right? Enough. It was just someone trying to be funny.",
        "Viki: Well, you know what? It wasn't funny, but it didn't mean anything.",
        "Nora: Yeah, because I'm here with you, and I'm marrying you, and that's all that matters.",
        "Clint: Oh, that's what I'd like to think. Yeah. Did Nora tell you that Matthew is suing her and Bo?",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Nora: Yes. He's suing for the right to consent to his own surgery, this miraculous surgery that could actually make him walk again, or also turn him into a quadriplegic, or kill him.",
        "Viki: He's suing you?",
        "Nora: Yes. A surgeon has filled his head with the thought that he could be playing basketball in no time.",
        "Viki: Oh, is this the surgeon that you brought, Clint?",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah.",
        "Viki: I'm so sorry.",
        "Nora: Well, it's not Clint's fault. It's just, it's-- it's what it is.",
        "Clint: Well, as Matthew would say, the timing really sucked, but I told Nora that we should go ahead with the wedding and-- because, you know, those occasions, they often bring families together, and it's-- that damn sign.",
        "Nora: I'll show you a sign. Come here. Come here, you.",
        "Clint: Hmm.",
        "Nora: That's a sign.",
        "Rachel: Oh. Oh, look.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Rachel: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: It's amazing. I can't even believe it. See with your eyes, not with your hands.",
        "Gigi: Just spit it out, Stacy!",
        "Stacy: You know what? I don't even know if I'm gonna tell you.",
        "Gigi: Why, too many big words, too hard for you to explain?",
        "Stacy: Oh, no. I can explain it. I just don't know if you can handle it.",
        "Gigi: Honey, I can handle anything you have to offer.",
        "Stacy: Okay. Fine. You want to know what's on the paper? I'll tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Let me get this straight. It's Gigi's fault that you slept with Stacy, huh? How does that work?",
        "Rex: Look, I know it was my decision, if you can call it a decision. It was more like a reaction, a mind-blowingly stupid reaction.",
        "Bo: All right, all right, all right. Let's forget about all that for right now.",
        "Rex: But I reacted like I did because Gigi--she didn't tell me the truth.",
        "Bo: About what Stacy was making her do, huh?",
        "Rex: Right. If she'd just been honest with me, we never would've broken up, and I could've gamed Stacy so Shane got what he needed. I would've never let her anywhere near me.",
        "Bo: Yeah, because you would've known who Stacy really is.",
        "Rex: Right. I feel like the sucker of all time.",
        "Bo: That's a new feeling for you, huh?",
        "Rex: She used my son as bait to get what she wanted.",
        "Bo: And Gigi let it happen.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Okay, Balsom. Here's what I think. I think Gigi was doing what she thought she had to do. She had to be scared to death, you know? She was trying to save her son's life.",
        "Rex: Why did she think she had to do it by herself?",
        "Bo: Maybe she just fell back on what she knew best because for 10 years, it was just her and Shane.",
        "Rex: I know. It's just, we could've outsmarted Stacy. When Gigi finally let me in and we were working together, we came up with a plan in, like, 10 minutes.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Well, there's no use playing \"what if\" now.",
        "Rex: I slept with Stacy. I lied about it. And now, I have to live with that for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So, are you gonna keep playing games, or are you gonna show me what's on that damn paper?",
        "Stacy: I said I would, didn't I? It's a list...",
        "Gigi: A list.",
        "Stacy: Of charges I'm gonna bring against you.",
        "Gigi: Ha ha! Oh, you are kidding, right?",
        "Stacy: No, actually, I met a lawyer when I was at the E.R., and he thinks the D.A. would be very interested to hear everything you did to me.",
        "Gigi: Oh, like bringing you into my home, trying to find you a job, breaking up with my boyfriend so you could have him?",
        "Stacy: You tried to kill me.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Stacy: You pushed me down the stairs.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God, I do not believe this.",
        "Stacy: Well, believe it, because my friend the lawyer says it's called assault, battery, and attempted murder.",
        "Gigi: Did you tell this ambulance chaser that you fell down those stairs because you came after me and that I still completely freaked out?",
        "Stacy: Because you thought you killed me.",
        "Gigi: Because you're my sister. It didn't matter what you tried to do to me. I didn't want you to die, okay? I'm the one who got help for you. I was afraid for your life. Why, I am starting to wonder.",
        "Stacy: See? You do want to kill me.",
        "Gigi: You want to call the D.A., fine. Go ahead. We'll see who they send the cops for.",
        "Stacy: Who's gonna send the cops for me?",
        "Gigi: Rex and his best friend the police commissioner. That doesn't worry you at all?",
        "Stacy: What is he gonna do?",
        "Gigi: Everything he can to protect us all from you, you raving lunatic!",
        "Stacy: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I guess Grandpa never thought he'd have to make this place wheelchair accessible.",
        "Nora: I'm so sorry. That's my-- we haven't come up here, so I forgot about ramps.",
        "Matthew: It's okay.",
        "Nora: No, it's not okay. It's not okay. You know what? I'll call a contractor, like, first thing next week.",
        "Matthew: You don't have to call anyone. I won't need it after my surgery.",
        "Nora: Um, okay. Well, this isn't the time or the place to get into that.",
        "Matthew: I'm just trying to be upbeat. I thought this was a party.",
        "Nora: Well, yes, but it's not just for us. It's Viki and Charlie, too, so--",
        "Matthew: I can't be happy about being able to walk again?",
        "Nora: You can be happy about whatever you want to be happy about, okay? We're not gonna talk about the surgery tonight.",
        "Matthew: Fine. Then we'll talk about it in court when I beat you and Dad.",
        "Nora: Oh, is that what your lawyer T\u00e9a Delgado is telling you?",
        "Matthew: She didn't have to.",
        "Nora: No, she's just telling you to sue your own parents.",
        "Destiny: It wasn't her idea, Ms. Hanen. It was mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I just can't believe things got this screwed up. That didn't even have to happen. I want this all to be over.",
        "Bo: Well, there's only one way to make that happen.",
        "Rex: Tell Gigi the truth.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: Yeah, well-- what if she can't forgive me?",
        "Bo: You thought that she slept with Brody, right? You were willing to forgive her. You tell her everything that you just told me. Tell her, \"I messed up big-time,\" you know? \"It's over. It'll never happen again.\" And then you tell her that you love her and you want to start over.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Rex: That simple, huh?",
        "Bo: Well, yeah. The truth is always simple. What's complicated is when you start lying.",
        "Rex: Yeah, tell me about it... or tell Gigi.",
        "Bo: All right. Let's look at it this way. Just because you don't tell her about it, there's no guarantee that she's not gonna find out, anyway, and that's the last thing you want, right? Is for Gigi to find out from somebody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You know, you really should be nicer to me. I'm in a very delicate condition.",
        "Gigi: And whose fault is that?",
        "Stacy: You're saying it's mine?",
        "Gigi: I didn't push you down those stairs.",
        "Stacy: That's not what I meant. It takes two to tango, you know?",
        "Gigi: Okay. I don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Stacy: Okay, let me just make this clear to you. I didn't get to where I'm at alone.",
        "Gigi: Okay, and where are you at? What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: Madam Delphina, what does it mean? What is he trying to set right?",
        "Delphina: A square dance?",
        "Renee: Square dance?",
        "Delphina: Yeah. Work with me here. He says, \"Who thought it would be a good idea to change partners dur--\" right. \"During the do-si-do?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I think Nora is right. It's almost as if Asa were still here.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, from what I heard, it wouldn't be a party without him.",
        "Viki: No. It wouldn't be a party without you.",
        "Charlie: You know, you don't have to worry about that stupid sign.",
        "Viki: Who said I was worried?",
        "Charlie: Well, good, because I'm not, either.",
        "Viki: Oh, good.",
        "Charlie: You know, you made it very clear a long time ago that you love me, and you also made it very clear that you and Clint are history.",
        "[Glass shatters]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: That doesn't make any sense. Oh, this is so frustrating. I wish I could talk to him myself.",
        "Delphina: Maybe he meant a hoedown.",
        "Renee: What would Asa try to fix at a hoedown?",
        "Delphina: Oh, you're asking me? Hmm? He said-- he says--",
        "Renee: What? What does he say?",
        "Delphina: \"Where I come from, you're supposed to dance with the one that brung ya.\"",
        "[Renee sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I still can't believe that the printer would make a mistake like that.",
        "Jared: All right already. Let it go. Accidents happen.",
        "Natalie: Uh, \"Viki & Clint and Bo & Nora\"? I mean, that's way more than an accident.",
        "Jared: What is it, a curse? I think you have been spending a little too much time around Roxy.",
        "Natalie: I know, it sounds stupid. I just--I wanted tonight to be perfect.",
        "Jared: Tonight is perfect.",
        "Natalie: You're right. You know--I don't know--I just-- sometimes in this house, I just feel a little stirred up.",
        "Jared: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Natalie: This is where you told me that you were my uncle, and after that, everything in my life changed.",
        "Jared: That was some night.",
        "Jared: Come on. Let's get back to the party.",
        "Brody: Natalie and Jared got rid of the banner.",
        "Jessica: What? Oh. Yeah. Good.",
        "Brody: Funny how a silly little thing like that can all of a sudden seem like some kind of a sign.",
        "Jessica: My mom loves Charlie, and my dad loves Nora. You know, it doesn't matter what's on that silly banner.",
        "Brody: You okay?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Yeah. I was just thinking about Nash. It was our two-year anniversary.",
        "Brody: You didn't even tell me.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, we-- you know, we got married in the hospital. It was really perfect.",
        "Brody: You still miss him like crazy, don't you?",
        "Jessica: Every day. Yeah. I do, but, you know, I know he's with me, and I can feel him in my heart, and, you know, every time I'm under the stars and, you know, I look at Bree and she has that grin on her face like she thinks she's getting away with something, I see her daddy, you know? I know my past will always be with me.",
        "Brody: Good. I'm glad.",
        "Jessica: But, you know, I look at you, you know, like when we were driving here tonight and you were singing along with the radio.",
        "Brody: Getting all the words wrong.",
        "Jessica: That was just--it was great. You were so happy. I look at you, and I see my future. I love you. I do. I love you, and I know that Nash would want me to.",
        "Brody: I love you so much, Jessica. I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: This is the most amazing day, the day I've wished for every day for the past 10 years, ever since it happened to you, and not me. Now do you know which day I'm talking about?",
        "Gigi: I...don't...care!",
        "Stacy: Well, you should, because see, my life is about to change forever, and so is yours.",
        "Gigi: What are you doing here? Why won't you just leave all of us alone?",
        "Stacy: Oh, don't worry, sis. You will be all alone. Well, I guess you'll have Shane. You guys can go back to being a little family, just like in the old days.",
        "Gigi: Wow, so you actually think that Rex is gonna choose you over me?",
        "Stacy: Oh, I know he will.",
        "Gigi: He hates you.",
        "Stacy: There's a very thin line between love and hate.",
        "Gigi: Well, whoever said that is full of it. Rex will never love you.",
        "Stacy: You don't know that.",
        "Gigi: Why are you doing this, Stacy? This doesn't have to be your life. You can start over. I'm giving you that chance. Just go away. Just go away and stop--",
        "Stacy: I am never going away! When I tell Rex what I just found out, he's never ever gonna leave me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: That whole thing about owning up to what you did, taking your licks, I hate that.",
        "Bo: Everybody hates that, Balsom.",
        "Rex: You know, when I was a kid, I remember playing king of the mountain, and I broke one of the legs on the coffee table. When Roxy came home, I told her that I broke it while I was vacuuming.",
        "Bo: She buy that?",
        "Rex: Well, it didn't hurt that she was drunk half the time back then in those days, but I knew what I did. But this-- I was just hoping that if Gigi never found out what happened between me and Stacy, it would just go away.",
        "Bo: Balsom, things like that never just go away.",
        "Rex: But I hate that part.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Tell her the truth, all right? Otherwise, if you wait, you just might find that the thing you want most, you missed it.",
        "Rex: You speaking from personal experience?",
        "Bo: I got to get over to Asa's lodge.",
        "Rex: Right now?",
        "Bo: Yeah, right now. There's a party over there. Nora and Clint are getting married tomorrow.",
        "Rex: You don't sound too thrilled about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I'll get Shaun to take me home.",

        "Destiny: Your mom doesn't look too happy.",
        "Nora: Sweetie, I know you meant well, and you're a great friend to Matthew. It's just, this probably was something you should've stayed out of.",
        "Destiny: See?",
        "Matthew: No. You're my guest, and I want you to stay.",
        "Rachel: Why don't we get you guys some soda?",
        "Matthew: No, not until mom says it's okay that Destiny is here.",
        "Nora: Of course it's okay that she's here.",
        "Rachel: This is supposed to be a happy occasion.",
        "Nora: Yes, it is.",
        "Rachel: So why don't we discuss this on another day? Right now, we need to focus on Mom's wedding.",
        "Matthew: Fine.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Clint: Is everything okay here?",
        "Nora: Yes, I think so.",
        "Destiny: Can we get those sodas now?",
        "Rachel: Right, and then we can make a toast.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, we shouldn't start the toasts. Bo is not here yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: The mother of my son is getting remarried. That's bound to happen sooner or later.",
        "Rex: To your brother.",
        "Bo: It is what it is.",
        "Rex: Hey, doesn't have to be.",
        "Bo: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Rex: If you don't want Nora to marry your brother, maybe you should do something about it... right now, before it's too late.",
        "Clint: I don't see any reason to wait for the toasts.",
        "Nora: Well, I just meant that Bo is your best man and he's probably got something prepared, don't you think?",
        "Clint: Well, who knows when he's gonna get here? Besides, he'll get his chances tomorrow.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Could I have everyone's attention, please? Whew. All right, so I'm gonna be the first one to make a toast. Everyone have a drink? Okay, good. Oh! Tonight we have a lot to celebrate, and I figure if I blow this, we've got 200 or 300 more to make up for it.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Natalie: Tomorrow is a very special day. I mean, my mom and dad are-- they're moving forward with their lives separately and together. I mean, the fact that they are such good friends and they wanted to share this day with each other, I mean, that's what makes this family--this big, complicated, blended family-- so special to me. So, Jessica and I, we would like to welcome Charlie, my father-in-law, to the family, and we'd like to welcome Nora back.",
        "Nora: Oh, ha ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Delphina: That was weird. Everything just went black.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Mom and Dad, we are just so happy that you are so happy. So, to Viki and Charlie and Nora and Clint, may your days be full of happiness and your nights be full of joy and your lives be full of light from now until--",
        "Charlie: Um--",
        "Natalie: Uh--",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Even if I wanted to do something about it, it's too late. Nora and Clint are getting married tomorrow. I'm the best man. I have to be at that party. I'm gonna call headquarters on the way and stay on top of that Stacy situation. I want you to get the ball rolling with that restraining order, all right?",
        "Rex: Bo--",
        "Bo: Go home to Gigi!",
        "Rex: Wait. What about what you just told me about you have to tell the truth before it's too late?",
        "Bo: I was talking about you and Gigi.",

        "Bo: You know, Balsom, in your life, sometimes you find that you've just missed the boat, you know?",
        "Rex: Fine. Don't tell me. You better tell Nora tonight... before that boat sails.",

        "Bo: 'Night, Balsom.",

        "Nora: What just happened?",
        "Clint: Oh, we probably blew a fuse.",

        "Matthew: What? I don't.",
        "Rachel: Come on, Destiny. Let's go see if we can find some candles.",
        "Destiny: You want one, Matthew?",
        "Matthew: What for? It's not like I can help, anyway.",
        "Brody: Have you seen Jessica?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I think she went to one of the bedrooms to get some candles.",

        "Gigi: All that paper proves is that you're out of your mind.",
        "Stacy: No. This paper is gonna give me everything I always wanted, finally.",

        "Clint: Well, it's not just that, although that is one more thing that will tie Bo and Nora together.",
        "Viki: I thought you'd worked through that.",
        "Clint: Yeah, so did I. But you know something? This whole wedding--I mean, our part of it--it's just starting to seem like it's jinxed.",
        "Viki: I'm sorry.",
        "Clint: Well, you got nothing to be sorry about.",
        "Viki: No. I mean, I'm sorry that you feel this way on the night before your wedding.",
        "Clint: Yeah, and I don't know what's gotten into me because I don't believe in jinxes. I mean, the lights go out the minute that Natalie is wishing us happiness and health, and, well, that was just a coincidence, and that banner, like you say, is just words on a piece of paper. It was a printer's error, so it's all meaningless.",

        "Rex: You asked her to leave town?",
        "Gigi: Stupid me, huh? She's not going anywhere.",
        "Stacy: Hello? I'm in the room.",
        "Rex: I showed Bo what you did to Gigi's car. The police are looking for you right now.",

        "Rex: We're pressing charges. Bo is getting a restraining order.",

        "Stacy: Well, I was gonna tell you earlier, but I wanted to wait for Rex.",
        "Rex: I'm calling the cops.",

        "Rex: You seriously think you can use what you did to Gigi to send her to jail?",
        "Stacy: I never said Gigi.",

        "Delphina: Asa wants me to tell you that 7 was always his lucky number. And 11 and 14? You know, most people only have one lucky-- all right. 7, 11, 14. Mean anything to you?",
        "Renee: No... except that maybe Asa is talking about weddings. I was his seventh wife.",

I mean, suing my mom and dad, it's what I got to do to get it. But I don't like doing this. I don't like the way it makes me feel. Oh, I really wish you were here with me.
