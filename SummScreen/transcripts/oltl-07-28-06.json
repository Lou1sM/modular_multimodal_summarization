        "Paige and Blair get fighting after their argument and they end up falling over furniture to the ground. Spencer and Bo separate the two, but the women still hurl angry comments at each other. Spencer buys Blair's act and Bo gets the details from Paige from across the room about the fake fight. Bo has good news. He has information on the forger he thinks set him up to fail and that could lead to Spencer's downfall. Hugh bumps into Vincent at the hospital. They talk about old times when they were college roommates and played football together. Hugh had heard that Vincent had gone over to the dark side, but Vincent says that he is just a businessman and nothing more. Vincent is surprised when he learns that Hugh knows Cristian, is the DA and is a friend to Evangeline. The two decide to get together for a drink real soon to talk more about old times. David is brought into John's office. He is told the good news. The gun that he had wasn't the one that shot Thomas. They try to figure out if Spencer had a gun with him when he was in the alley but David can't remember details like that. David is released and goes to the bar. Spencer is there and surprised to find his little brother out and about. \"They know that I didn't kill Thomas McBain and that you did!\" Bo leaves his cellphone on the table and Spencer answers it disguising his voice as he answers. It is John who says that he has a lead on 'Truman'. Spencer freezes, waiting for more information but John becomes suspicious and calls out for Bo to talk to him but no one answers. Paige catches Spencer with the phone. Bo arrives and takes his phone from the man. Bo checks his phone and finds that John was the one that was calling in when Spencer picked up the phone. Cristian is angry that Todd controls so much, but Evangeline doesn't mind waiting for him before taking off her bandages. Todd arrives and Dr. Simmons takes off the bandages. \"Can you see anything?\" Todd asks leaning towards her."

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You're saying that you'd be willing to let Tess out, but only long enough for me to say goodbye?",
        "Jessica: No. No, I'm sorry, I -- I can't ask you to do that any more than I can call Tess back at will. I -- I shouldn't have said anything. I'm sorry. It was a mistake. Sorry.",

        "Blair: Just -- leave me alone. I'm going to go freshen up.",
        "Todd: Hey, that's a pretty good jab you got there. Now all you got to do is go down to Rourke's and see if Cristian Vega needs a sparring partner.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and you'd like that, wouldn't you? Get Cristian out of the running so you could have Evangeline all to yourself.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You don't want to see me get hurt?",

        "Kelly: Oh, you're playing the baby card, really?",
        "Hugh: They say that babies can hear music even before they're born. You don't want a tone-deaf kid, do you?",
        "Kelly: Ok. Ok, I'll go. I -- don't expect too much.",

        "Layla: Aren't you going to go and say hi to Vange?",

        "Layla: She'll get used to it.",
        "Vincent: If you say so.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, it's me. Yeah, I'm at the hospital. I'm standing outside Evangeline Williamson's room. Bring it to me here. Good.",

        "Cristian: No, it's not ok. You've waited long enough.",

        "Jessica: Please don't do this. It's not fair.",
        "Nash: Tess, do you remember the last conversation we had before I went to California? Do you remember? You said that you understood. You understood why I was leaving. I was leaving to protect you.",
        "Jessica: Not going to work.",
        "Nash: And you said that you believed in me, and I believed in you, and I'm back. I made you a promise. I promised you that I would come back, and I'm back. I don't need to leave. Tess?",
        "Jessica: Stop it.",
        "Nash: Tess, we can be together forever. Look at me. Tess, do you remember this? You remember this? Look at it. It's a note. You left it for me on my pillow in Napa. Do you remember? You went for a walk. Tess, you went for a walk in the vineyards because you couldn't sleep. You couldn't sleep during the night, you went for a walk, and you left this --",

        "Nash: For me on my pillow.",
        "Jessica: Please stop it.",

        "Jessica: I am hanging on --",
        "Nash: I know you're in there.",
        "Jessica: By a very thin thread here. I'm going to have a breakdown. It's my mental health at stake here.",
        "Nash: Come on, let me know that you can hear me, Tess.",
        "Jessica: Nash, listen to me.",

        "David: And?",
        "John: The bullet didn't come from your gun.",

        "John: I'm warning you.",
        "David: But I like saying it.",
        "John: Last time.",
        "David: Just like Kevin Buchanan.",
        "John: The question is, whether that happened before or after the gun was fired.",

        "Antonio: Do you have any idea how many people are worried about you?",
        "Jessica: I know. I know you were worried, and I am so sorry, but I swear to you, I wasn't in danger the whole time. I just -- I want to go back home. I want to get the baby. I want to go home.",

        "Vincent: Oh. I'll remember that. Hmm.",
        "Hugh: Yeah, hey, we should -- we should go throw a football around, you know? It'd be just like old times.",

        "Hugh: Yeah, well, fortunately, the receivers didn't have that problem, o great quarterback. I did run some interference for you a few times, though.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, you did.",
        "Hugh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Vincent: Saved my ass, yeah. Oh, hey, let's get a drink sometime.",

        "Layla: Excuse me, I played nurse number one, and it was a recurring role.",
        "Evangeline: Seriously, Layla, this could take a while. And don't you have to get to work? Isn't the Mary J. Concert tonight?",
        "Layla: Are you kidding me? If it was a contest between you and Mary J., You'd win hands down.",
        "Evangeline: Layla, they're going to need you. The place is going to be packed.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, Antonio might not be there.",
