        "Todd: Yeah. I was in New York with T\u00e9a and Dani and her boyfriend.",

        "Kelly: You really think he met with Bennett Thompson?",
        "Rex: It's the only thing that makes sense. Thompson had to have taken those records from Glen before we showed up.",
        "Kelly: So then Thompson gets rid of all the pertinent info.",
        "Rex: And that leaves us with the boring stuff and throws us off the trail.",
        "Kelly: Well, one look at this and we would figure all the Bennett Thompsons were nothing but golly gee swell kind of guys.",
        "Rex: And we'd have no reason to believe anything else, not once he made sure I was out of commission when Glen showed up.",
        "Kelly: You're lucky all he did was drug you.",

        "Ford: Because the old man was such a loveable guy.",
        "Inez: Even if I wanted to cheat, the thought of what he would do to me...once something got in his head, there was nothing I could do to convince him that the child I was carrying was his. And then before I even knew it, I'm being dragged across the room by my hair, kicked out the door, and when that door was closed, I could never see you and James again.",
        "Ford: So you didn't call the cops, the courts, anybody?",
        "Inez: I had a friend who knew a lawyer, and we had just filed the custody papers when I got a knock on the door in the middle of the night, and there was a picture of Nate with a 6-inch butcher knife through it.",

Why wouldn't he believe that I pushed his mom down the stairs? Um, I don't think that gave him the right to assault me, but I know that if anybody hurt someone I loved that I would probably do the same thing, or actually I would do the same thing, and it would be me sitting there about to be sentenced...and I'd deserve it. But I love my daughter and my granddaughter most of all. I don't want anything or anyone to hurt them. And I would hate to see my granddaughter grow up without a father. That doesn't seem fair to me. So if you really want my opinion about this whole thing, then I actually think you should let him go home.",
        "Judge: Mr. Thornhart, while I appreciate your admission of guilt and your willingness to accept responsibility for your actions, I'm afraid no amount of remorse will change them. You severely beat and almost killed an innocent man, Todd Manning. Regardless of your motives or beliefs, the law cannot stand for such a crime. It requires me to mete out a just sentence, which I have no doubt is the maximum allowed, but I asked for the victim's point of view, and as such, I must consider it. Mr. Manning believes that the suffering of your family in your absence would be greater than that caused by your hand, which leads me to wonder if by sending you to prison I would be the one committing the larger crime. I'm inclined to answer in the affirmative. For this reason I'm choosing to accept the commonwealth's recommendation. I hereby sentence you to time served plus two year's probation and 5,000 hours of community service. But I warn you, Mr. Thornhart, if while on probation you should decide to disregard the gift that Mr. Manning has given you today and instead return to reckless action, consider committing any kind of malfeasance, get so much as a parking ticket, I will send you to jail. Don't test me. Court is adjourned.",
