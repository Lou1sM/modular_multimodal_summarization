        "Everybody is getting dressed in their formalwear and ready to attend David and Dorian's production of \"Vicker Man\". Markko is back in town after working on it but has not brought Langston with him although Dorian wants them back together. Dorian gets into a brawl with the woman who tried to seduce David knowing she is the actress to play Dorian. Blanca Morales hosts the television news show about all the Llanview residents and their gossip while they attend the show. Original Todd finds out about it and tells John he must attend although John had not previously planned to. Original Todd stays back and watches the show on John's television and is unable to accept seeing all of the people in his life with this \"other guy\" who calls himself Todd Manning. Rex is also home alone and distraught with Shane and determined not to let Todd and Jack get away with Gigi's death. Todd and Jack know that somebody out there wants their head on a platter. Rick, the porn producer shows up unexpectedly and makes Nate very uneasy. And as soon as we see the movie start with David narrating it, the screen goes blank and a new \"film\" appears with Nate stripping out of his cap and gown and ready to have a sex scene at The Minuteman."

        "Starr: Uh-huh. Aren't they beautiful? He gave them to me right before we got married. I love them, but I'm not wearing them for your father. I'm wearing them for Tom\u00e1s, because he painted me in these and that's when he said that he fell for me. Well, he said that, anyway.",
        "Starr: So things have been better for the two of you?",
        "Blair: Yeah. He's finally opening up to me about his past, which means maybe we can have a future.",

        "Baz: That's it? What about Todd? Did you shoot him?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, in fact, your father was trying to stop whoever shot him, and in the process he got wounded.",
        "Dani: That's why you were so weird after the shooting.",

        "Rex: Then Seamus turns out to be the hero, and he blasts through the cave and rescues his mother.",
        "Shane: Then he's supposed to blast the bad guys through the mouth of a volcano and leave them there to boil in a pit of lava, but what's the point! Bad guys never have to pay, not in real life! They just get away with it.",
        "Rex: Not this time, Shane. I swear to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's not that easy, Dad. You can't just decide to feel better when you don't.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. But you can't let it take over your life, either. Look at me. I've made a ton of mistakes, but I gotta live with them. You're gonna have to, too. You don't have a choice. All right. I'm gonna go see this lousy movie.",

        "John: What did I tell you, huh? Didn't I tell you not to touch the phone? Are you out of your mind?",
        "Old Todd: No, but let me tell you something. The blonde with the whiskey voice? Natalie's mom? Whoo! She is--let me tell you. She came in here with a stack of towels, right? So I took that towel and I threw it over my head and I pretended to be you and it worked great. So that gave me an idea. When the telephone rang and it was Delgado and he was talking about Todd Manning, I kind of pretended to be you [in gruff voice] You know what I mean? What?",
