        "Bo and Rex are still trying and failing to get out of 1968. But a new character appears who looks just like Lindsay and who reveals that she was Bo's mother, Olympia angry at her husband, Asa's infidelity and worried that her baby boy will be drafted to go and fight the Viet Nam war. Bo tells Rex there's nothing they can do to rewrite history. And he has already tried unsuccessfully to make a call to the present. But Rex finds his cell phone, makes a call and reaches Gigi in the present. Gigi finds that she might be out of a job after the diner has burned. In Mendorra, Carlo Hesser has arranged for Sara and Cristian to be killed and for Talia to marry Jonas Chamberlain. Blair and John have slept together but are agreeing not to \"jump into\" anything. Todd and Marty are growing closer. But it looks like Todd is going to go to the diner and run into Blair and John."

        "Blair: Am I awake? [Sighing] Oh, good. I was afraid it was a dream -- I mean, not that it wasn't dreamy.",
        "John: No regrets?",
        "Blair: No. You?",

        "Marty: No.",
        "Todd: Snoring?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Todd: Why are you laughing?",
        "Marty: 'Cause -- 'cause for the first time that I can remember, I feel good. And it's because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonas: How's my lovely bride today?",
        "Talia: I'm not marrying you, Jonas, so get over it.",
        "Jonas: I just came here to see if you had everything you needed.",
        "Talia: What I need is Antonio and, I don't know, maybe a gulf stream gassed up and ready for me on the tarmac, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, Antonio, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You must hate me.",
        "Antonio: Where is Talia? Where's Sarah and my brother?",
        "Carlo: You want to tell him, Tina? Or shall I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: Antonio, I know you're out of town, but I can't find the insurance papers to the diner. I have very bad news, mijo. Would you call me right away?",
        "Gigi: My God, what happened?",
        "Carlotta: There was a fire and nobody knows how it started.",
        "Gigi: Are you all right?",
        "Carlotta: I'm fine. I wasn't here when it started. Apparently it happened overnight. I know the wiring was up to code and the kitchen was recently inspected.",
        "Gigi: Was anybody hurt?",
        "Carlotta: No, thank God.",
        "Gigi: And they have no idea how it started?",
        "Carlotta: Those guys are investigating.",
        "Gigi: I'll call Rex. He's great with these kinds of things. Oh, wait. He went to find Bo. Uh, well I'll try his cell anyway. Maybe he's caught up with him and they're headed home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, Balsom. Wake up.",
        "Bo: Balsom",
        "Rex: Bo?",
        "Bo: At least somebody remembers my name.",
        "Rex: I had the craziest dream. I dreamt we were struck by lightning and sent back to 1968.",
        "[Knock]",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Chuck: Coffee's on.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Chuck.",
        "Chuck: Yes, Sir.",
        "Rex: [As Bo] Oh, thank God, we're home.",
        "Chuck: Hey, Dad.",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Son. How are these cowpokes doing today?",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Got the paper.",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Thought you'd like a look-see.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Thank you. LBJ's back from a conference.",
        "Rex: LBJ?",
        "Bo: The Soviet Union's holding military exercises. Mickey Mantle goes one for three.",
        "Rex: Mickey Mantle? What's the date?",
        "Bo: July 29 -- 1968.",
        "Rex: It wasn't a dream. We're stuck in 1968.",
        "Rex: Okay, this is really starting to creep me out. It's been two days. I was sure we'd wake up back in the future, or the present, now. Our now.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Coffee sounds good. Okay? Maybe a couple of eggs?",
        "Chuck: Sure thing.",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Asa, we've been friends a long time.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Yeah, we sure have.",
        "Rex: You sure have?",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Yeah. What's on your mind, Ni-- Chuck?",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Well, I just think that maybe you two boys -- how long has it been since you and your son took a vacation? I mean, it's been years by my count. Call up one of them fancy hotels and book yourself a suite. You know, take a trip, while you still can.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] You know what, Ni -- uh, Chuck? I just might take your advice.",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Good. Now, I'm glad.",
        "Rex: While you still can -- what does that mean?",
        "Bo: I don't know why I didn't think of this before. Balsom, we're going to phone home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: No regrets.",
        "Blair: Good. Because regrets are a waste of time",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Blair: You know, you spend so much time looking back, you can miss something wonderful that's right in front of you.",
        "John: That's true.",
        "Blair: I mean, everybody makes mistakes. Not that this was a mistake. I mean, far from it. I think it was just what the doctor ordered, you know? Good friends, good Kentucky bourbon, rainy night, and a chance to feel something. I think we both needed that. I know that I did, and you can just chime in, jump in, any time you want.",
        "John: You're doing fine.",
        "Blair: That's right, I'm the talker and you're the listener.",
        "John: That just about covers it.",
        "Blair: So -- what happens now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hey, you gave me back a piece of my past.",
        "Todd: Not a piece most people would like to remember.",
        "Marty: No, but at least I'm starting to learn a little bit about myself. I mean, that was something that had a huge impact on me.",
        "Todd: Breakfast?",
        "Marty: I know it was difficult for you to tell me.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it was a lot for you to take in.",
        "Marty: Yeah, it wasn't what I was hoping for. But even if you couldn't have saved me from that, I obviously survived.",
        "Todd: Well, it took you a while to get past it.",
        "Marty: But I did. Yeah, and I'll get past this with your help. Uh-uh, I am nobody's victim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fireman: Do you have more than one fuse box?",
        "Carlotta: Yeah, there's a second -- excuse me, Gigi. Yeah, there's a second one in the basement.",
        "Brody: What happened to this place?",
        "Gigi: There was a fire. Poor Carlotta, she said it's a total loss. Did you follow me?",
        "Brody: No. You left this on the counter.",
        "Gigi: I always leave it there. If Shane needs to reach me, he just calls me here.",
        "Brody: Not today. Besides, I wanted to talk to you. You snuck out.",
        "Gigi: I had to get Shane to day camp.",
        "Brody: You were supposed to wake me up, remember?",
        "Gigi: Oh, sorry. Yeah, I forgot. And you said you were going to look for work?",
        "Brody: I am. As soon as I say what I came here to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Yes, hello. I'm trying to reach a friend of mine in Pennsylvania. And they say that that's not a working number. And I happen to know for a fact that it really is. It's area code 267. Are you sure about that? Yeah, okay. No, no. Thank you.",
        "Rex: What did she say?",
        "Bo: She says that the area code 267 does not exist in the United States.",
        "Rex: That's ridiculous.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but it's true. Area code 267 wasn't really added until, like, the late nineties.",
        "Rex: So it's still 1968, everywhere.",
        "Bo: Looks like it.",
        "Rex: But how did we lose 40 years?",
        "Bo: I don't know, but we sure did.",
        "Rex: Okay, maybe -- maybe we're still asleep. Or we're in a coma somewhere. From the lightning?",
        "Bo: All I know for a fact is that you're you and I'm me.",
        "Rex: That depends on who you ask. Because according to everybody so far, you're Asa and I'm Bo.",
        "Bo: You know what really bothers me about all this? I mean, even if we did fall through the cracks and somehow we ended up in 1968, why isn't Chuck Senior himself? I mean why is -- why is Nigel under that hat?",
        "Rex: I don't know, nobody is who they say they are. Maria is Natalie. Jared is Clint. That's what makes this feel like some dopey dream. Everybody in our lives is here, only they're somebody else.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah -- so I'm Pa and you're me. That's just the way it's supposed to be.",
        "Rex: You're right. So what do we do? How do we get home?",
        "Bo: I don't think we can do that, just yet. I think we might just have to bide our time.",
        "Rex: Oh, while you stay here and sleep with Emma Bradley.",
        "Bo: No, I did not sleep with Emma Bradley.",
        "Rex: Well, according to her you did, Mr. Big spender.",
        "Bo: That was Pa, okay? You know, he pretty much bankrolled Renee's brothel there in Nevada.",
        "Rex: Now Emma's holed up here in Paris with Spencer Truman, waiting for you to come over and sleep with her again.",
        "Lindsay: Who's my husband been sleeping with this time?",
        "Bo: Lindsay?",
        "Lindsay: Well that's real cute, Asa. I'm Olympia. Your wife. And this Lindsay character, who you've obviously slept with, that slut better not come within a mile of this ranch if she values her life.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] No, I'm not sleeping with anybody, I promise.",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Asa, I'm sorry. I didn't realize Miss Buchanan's door was unlocked.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] You can keep me locked up, but you can't hide the truth from me.",
        "Bo: No, I'm not hiding anything.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] Don't you lie to me.",
        "Bo: Me, lie to you? Why do you judge me? You're the one who faked a mental illness to keep from going to prison for murder. No -- oh, no.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] Chuck!",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] I'm right here, ma'am.",
        "Rex: I know she looks like Lindsay, but she's not.",
        "Chuck: Here you go, ma'am, a nice glass of that mineral water you like.",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Asa, I know you've been holding out hope, but I don't think there's anything fake about your wife's condition. She's plumb lost her grip. Now, remember we talked about, you know, that sanitarium outside of Houston? We got the brochures. Real pretty place. Window boxes and bingo and everything. Now, I know you weren't keen on the idea, but she'll be looked after.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] I think maybe you might be right.",
        "Bo: That woman is not my mother.",
        "Rex: Why is she staring at me?",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] Oh, my baby. My little boy. You got married without telling your own mother?",
        "Rex: [As Bo] No, no. Of course not. No, I wouldn't do that. It's a -- it's a --",
        "Bo: [As Asa] It's a -- it's just a joke.",
        "Rex: [As Bo] Right, it's a joke.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] Well, that's not funny. 'Specially right now.",
        "Rex: [As Bo] Right now?",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] I'm not letting them take you away.",
        "Rex: [As Bo] What are you talking about -- um, Mom? I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] I know, because I'm not letting them take you.",
        "Rex: [As Bo] You're going to have to clue me in -- Pa. What -- do you know what she's talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Gigi, do you think we have what you'd call a normal relationship?",
        "Gigi: We don't have a relationship, period.",
        "Brody: Sure we do. We -- I mean, it's just not normal. We live together.",
        "Gigi: We're roommates.",
        "Brody: As far as everybody knows, I'm Shane's daddy.",
        "Brody: Would you please -- please. Look at what happened. I mean, when I met you, you were pregnant. And then before we could kind of get things sorted out, I shipped out. Then my hateful old mother told you I had died and told me that you had run out on me, which -- I mean, it took years for us to get to where we are now, which is not what you would call normal. Are you with me so far?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, what's the point, Brody?",
        "Brody: I'm trying to ask you out, woman.",
        "Gigi: You mean like, on a date.",
        "Brody: Yeah, a date. Like normal people. So what do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What's he talking about, Tina?",
        "Tina: I can't say it. I can't.",
        "Cain: What's going on, Hesser? Why is she so upset?",
        "Carlo: Perhaps it's best if Tina tells you herself. And besides, I've got to get ready. I'm giving my daughter away soon.",
        "Antonio: You hurt her, I'll kill you.",
        "Cain: What happened? Where's Sarah?",
        "Tina: She's -- she's gone.",
        "Cain: Gone? What do you mean, gone?",
        "Antonio: What, did they let her go?",
        "Tina: I wish.",
        "Cain: Honey, please just tell me what happened, okay?",
        "Tina: Carlo had the guards tie her to the boat.",
        "Antonio: And where was Cristian?",
        "Tina: The guards were holding Cristian back. And then the guards pushed the boat away from the dock.",
        "Cain: Where was this?",
        "Tina: Up above the falls. It was just like before. Like when I went over the Igua\u00e7u Falls in Argentina. Carlo knew that. That's why he did it. He wanted to torture me.",
        "Antonio: Sarah was in the boat?",
        "Tina: And Cristian. He -- he got away from the guards and he swam over there to try to save her, but it was too late.",
        "Cain: What do you mean?",
        "Tina: He couldn't stop the boat. And the boat with Cristian and Sarah in it, it -- it went over. They all went over the falls. They're dead. They're both dead.",
        "Antonio: No, they can't be dead. That's not possible.",
        "Tina: Antonio, I'm so sorry. This is my fault. It's our fault. None of this would have happened if we hadn't been so greedy. And -- and my baby would still be here.",
        "Cain: Okay, okay.",
        "Antonio: Tina, you need to tell me exactly what happened.",
        "Tina: I told you.",
        "Antonio: Did you see them drown? Did you see their bodies?",
        "Tina: I saw Cristian in the boat. Sarah -- he went there -- he went there to help try to save her and then -- but he couldn't and they -- they went over the falls.",
        "Antonio: And then what happened?",
        "Tina: The falls are so steep. And Sarah, she was tied up. They must have drowned.",
        "Antonio: You -- you didn't see it happen.",
        "Tina: Antonio, I know this is hard to accept, but they're gone.",
        "Antonio: No.",
        "Tina: They're -- they're both gone.",
        "Antonio: No. You went over the falls and survived.",
        "Tina: I was rescued before I drowned.",
        "Antonio: That doesn't mean they didn't survive.",
        "Cain: And I hope they did. But we are no use to anyone if Carlo gets a chance to shoot us. So, if you don't mind, I think we should concentrate on one thing. Getting the hell out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonas: Ladies, would you please help my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Talia: I'm not your frigging fianc\u00e9e. All right? You didn't even ask me to marry you. But if you had I would have turned you down flat.",
        "Carlo: Doesn't she have a marvelous spirit?",
        "Talia: I'm not marrying this.",
        "Carlo: A prince? Of course you are. It's going to be a lovely wedding. Here Bitterman is taking care of all the arrangements. The whole town is turning up.",
        "Talia: Yeah, because they know it's a fake. This is a freak show.",
        "Jonas: I beg you pardon.",
        "Carlo: Jonas, the bride has a point. She needs time to prepare, to calm her jitters. I want the imposters, Cain and Tina, to watch the ceremony.",
        "Jonas: And what about Antonio Vega?",
        "Carlo: Eliminate him.",
        "Jonas: Until later, my pet.",
        "Carlo: Now, now Talia. Didn't your mother teach not to mistreat the help?",
        "Talia: My mother taught me to think for myself, okay? So I'm not marrying that idiot.",
        "Carlo: But you are, darling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You haven't been anybody's victim for a long time. Of course, that doesn't mean you weren't upset by it, obviously. And that you wanted to kill those bastards.",
        "Marty: Yeah, good. I can't remember that either.",
        "Todd: I'll never forget it.",
        "Marty: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: You're sorry again?",
        "Marty: I am for that night, too. What, did I say something wrong?",
        "Todd: Nope. No, no.",
        "Marty: You've just been really good to me and you've helped me out of a situation at Lee Ramsey's, a bad one, and you've given me this great place to stay. You slept in a chair.",
        "Todd: I slept great, actually.",
        "Marty: No, you didn't. You're a liar. Anyway, when I do recover, I'll have you to thank.",
        "Todd: It's the least I could do.",
        "Marty: No. Well, okay, maybe. But I owe you one.",
        "Todd: No, you don't owe me anything. I've got to tell you, it's been really -- it's been really wonderful having you here. I know it's weird, but I -- I've got this -- you know, I've lost people in my life, most of the important ones. My wife, my kids. And, uh, you've kind of filled something for me and made me feel understood. Listened to me, listened to me rant about McBain. And I really can't tell you how important it is that you're here and how much you've helped me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I don't know if I'm very good at these kind of conversations.",
        "Blair: Okay, I'll go first. You're my friend. I trust you. And obviously I find you very attractive. And I think what happened last night was -- well, was probably inevitable, and I'm glad that it happened because -- well, for a lot of reasons, but it was wonderful. I know that I'm just not ready to get involved with anyone.",
        "John: Same here. You know, we were friends before this, so I wouldn't want to lose that. I like you. I like the way you stand up for yourself. I like the way that look comes over your face when you sing.",
        "Blair: But -- you're not over Marty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Woman, what is all this fussing about?",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] This is all your fault.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] What do you mean, my fault?",
        "Chuck: Don't you worry about a thing, Mrs. Buchanan. Bo and I will look after each other.",
        "Rex: [As Bo] Um, I don't need anyone looking out for me. Thanks, I'm not going anywhere. Except maybe 2008, if I'm lucky.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] Bo, son, I know you're just saying that because you want to make me feel better. But I'm not so far gone that I don't know what's really going on here. You are sending my boy to fight in that terrible Vietnam War.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I appreciate the thought, but you know, I really can't think about dating anybody until I find a new job. I can't believe I turned down that job with Dorian for one that barely paid the bills, and now I don't even have that.",
        "Brody: Now, we still have that money that Dorian gave me.",
        "Gigi: No, no. You put that away for Shane's future, and whether he knows it or not, that boy is going to college. We cannot touch that money, although how I'm going to put food on the table and pay his medical bills is --",
        "Brody: You're not doing it alone. We're in this together.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God, Brody, he is not your responsibility.",
        "Brody: Gigi, I signed up to be his dad before he was even born, so he is my responsibility. It'll be okay, we'll get jobs -- maybe even ones with health insurance.",
        "Gigi: Ah, dream on.",
        "Brody: We're smart, we're young, we work hard. We'll find jobs.",
        "Gigi: Ugh. It's the looking for work that gets me down -- having to put on a happy face and listen to people say, \"Why do you want to be in the restaurant business?\" And trying to sound bouncy and excited about working like a dog for minimum wage, just so they don't reject you.",
        "Brody: Anybody who rejects you has got rocks in his head.",
        "Gigi: All right, well, yeah, maybe doing it together isn't such a bad idea.",
        "Brody: So it's a date?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: [As Bo] Vietnam? I'm going to Vietnam?",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Yes, with my son, Chuck.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] Well, they're both babies, and you're letting the government put a gun in their hands?",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] They're serving their country, same as we did. They're going to be shipping out the end of this week. But don't you worry, Mrs. B., These boys are going to be just fine.",
        "Chuck: Yeah, they're having those peace talks now. May even be home by Christmas.",
        "Rex: What, are you ki-- the war's going to last another five years. Almost 60,000 Americans are going to die.",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] You boys are going to whup those commie bastards. You'll be home before you know it.",
        "Chuck: Yeah.",
        "Lindsay: [As Olympia] Five years?",
        "Nigel: [As Chuck, Sr.] Tell you what, Bo. Why don't you look in that crystal ball of yours and tell me when this son of mine is going to find a girl, settle down, and give me a grandson.",
        "Chuck: I already got the name picked out -- Chuck the third. Huh? Got a good ring to it.",

        "Marty: You know what I'm curious about? You said that my relationship with John McBain was a disaster. Were there men before him? I mean, was I ever able to trust anybody again, and fall in love, or --",
        "Todd: Let's talk about something else.",
        "Marty: Did I ever marry? Huh?",
        "Todd: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Marty: Okay, fine. You're right, you're right. You're right, I'm feeling good, and we'll just leave it for now.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I mean, you don't want to suffer through it again.",
        "Marty: And I trust you -- I know you'll tell me more when the time is right.",
        "Todd: Thank you very much.",
        "Marty: [Laughs] I must have been a fool to fall for a guy like John McBain, huh?",
        "Todd: Well, he played every woman he met.",
        "Marty: I didn't mean to bring up a sore subject.",
        "Todd: What, do you mean Blair? Oh, the hell with her -- I'm done with her.",
        "Marty: Ah, I don't think so. What -- she's got a screw loose if she's leaving you for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, we were good together. When Marty died, it hit me hard.",
        "Blair: I know.",
        "John: It's more than that. I'm not sure I'm cut out for this kind of thing.",
        "Blair: And what kind of thing is that?",
        "John: I don't have a lot to offer you. You or anybody else. I've been told more than once that I'm a workaholic. I'm a loner. It's nothing that you would want.",
        "Blair: Well, you have one thing that I never got from Todd, and that's honesty. And, John, let me tell you something, that means so, so much to me. And I like you, too, and I like you for a lot of different reasons. I like you because you're smart, and you listen to me, and I like being around you. And I do trust you, and these days, I even trust myself.",

        "Marty: Yeah, yeah, and you know what I want? I know what I want. I want a big stack of blueberry pancakes.",
        "Todd: I don't think I have the fixings for those. Janet's not here --",
        "Marty: It's okay, I'll eat anything.",
        "Todd: No, no, no. If you want blueberry pancakes, you shall have blueberry pancakes. I'll go to the diner. No problem -- 20 minutes.",
        "Marty: All right, well, I'll be here. [Laughs] Don't be stingy with the syrup.",

        "Cain: No, not now that we don't have any jewels.",
        "Antonio: You listen to me, you sorry excuse for a human being. I've got a brother that may be dead, a lover that may be married off to some Carlo Hesser lapdog, and you're the only one with ties or information, so you work with me.",
        "Cain: Excuse me; I was a fake prince, a phony, okay? Now I've been found out. What do you want from me?",
        "Tina: Yeah, this isn't all Cain's fault, I mean --",

        "Carlo: Jonas is authentic royalty, and I own him. You'll thank me in time.",
        "Talia: No, I won't. I already have a life. I'm a police officer.",

        "Bo: I don't know how it happened. We all end up back in the past in a weird rerun of my life, but everything so far -- I mean, Pa having an affair with Emma Bradley, my mother losing her mind, all of that really did happen. So even if we could change it, the future's at stake.",
        "Rex: Bo, read my lips. I'm not going to Vietnam.",
        "Bo: You don't have a choice. You volunteered. But you're going to be okay. I mean, I made it back in one piece.",
        "Rex: No, you don't understand. This is a lover, not a fighter. I'm looking out for this.",
        "Bo: No, you will adapt -- I did.",

        "Brody: I know how terrific you are.",
        "Gigi: So, how's it going?",
        "Carlotta: It's going. Maybe I'll be able to salvage some of this silverware, if I can ever get it clean.",
        "Gigi: I'm pretty good at polishing silverware.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, I wouldn't be able to pay you.",
        "Gigi: Honey -- oh, my God, that's okay.",
        "Carlotta: No, you need to get out there and look for a new job, young lady, not sit here with me polishing knives and forks that I may never use again.",
        "Gigi: I'm so sorry. I really am.",
        "Carlotta: Me, too. And thanks. But you know what? The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. Nobody died, and nobody was hurt, and that's the blessing, because what's important is people, not things.",

        "Chuck: What is it? Some kind of transistor radio?",
        "Bo: [As Asa] That's exactly right. He got it from a friend of mine who's into gadgets. He put it together, asked me to invest.",
