        "John: So this is it. What do you think of your new digs?",
        "Cole: All right, I just wish Starr and Hope could live here with me.",
        "John: Hopefully you won't have to be here for long.",
        "Marty: Yeah, just long enough to bring down a narcotics ring. John, I don't know about this.",
        "Cole: Mom, I can do this, all right? You just have to trust me on this.",
        "Marty: It's not you I don't trust, or John. But if anything ever happened to you--",
        "John: No, not on my watch. Okay? I know it's not your typical summer job, but it keeps Cole out of prison.",
        "Marty: Yeah, that's what I keep telling myself.",
        "Cole: Mom, I wrecked Matthew's life because I could buy drugs out of my own school. All right, maybe I can fix it where no one else can do that.",
        "Marty: I Hope so.",
        "Cole: I feel like if I don't do my part to get this garbage out of the schools, I'll never have a good life with Starr and Hope.",

        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Blair: Is Hope still asleep?",
        "Starr: Still? Don't you mean finally?",
        "Blair: She cutting another tooth?",
        "Starr: Yeah. Don't you just wish that you could take away that pain? Did you ever feel like that?",
        "Blair: Oh, all the time. Still do. You're still my baby girl, and I know you're exhausted.",
        "Starr: Mm. I know. Still want to be able to sleep anyway. I keep thinking about Cole's...",
        "Blair: He starts his community service today, right? Does he have any idea what they're gonna have him doing?",
        "Starr: Uh, no. He's not sure yet. I've just been thinking about everything that he's been through.",
        "Blair: You worried about him? I mean, trying to stay clean?",
        "Starr: No. No, Cole's really turned his life around.",
        "Blair: You know what? He has, and I'm so proud of him, and I'm proud of you, sweetheart. I'm proud of how you've handled all of this, and you stuck to your guns, you know, when he was spinning out of control, and then you stuck by him when he was serious about, you know, cleaning his act up. It's great.",
        "Starr: I really love him, Mom.",
        "Blair: I know you do, and I know sometimes when you love somebody it's really hard. I mean, it's hard to forgive their mistakes.",
        "Starr: Like mother, like daughter, right? Uh-huh. I heard about you and dad in the cabana. What's up with that?",
        "Blair: Ahh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, Todd, a word with you, please. I checked the guest room, and there's no sign of Miss Delgado. Am I to assume that she has declined your kind invitation to move in with us?",
        "Todd: No. I left her the key and she's thinking about it.",
        "Dorian: That's hardly a yes.",
        "Todd: It's not a no either. She's gonna call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: The judge put our case on the docket for the day after tomorrow.",
        "Matthew: Sweet.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yep. I'm compiling a list of expert witnesses who can testify about the safety of the operation and character witnesses who can back up our claim that you are mature enough to make decisions regarding your physical condition.",
        "Matthew: Awesome. One more thing that'll put the squeeze on them.",
        "T\u00e9a: One more thing? What's that?",
        "Matthew: I think we may be able to settle this out of court.",
        "T\u00e9a: Have your parents decided to let you have the surgery?",
        "Matthew: No. But they will.",

        "Nora: Hey.",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "Nora: Hey.",
        "Bo: I just came by to help Clint get ready for the wedding.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. Rachel's waiting for me at the church with my dress, so I, uh, should, you know, probably go over there and get ready.",
        "Bo: Is there something--",
        "Nora: Do you think we should talk about what happened between us last night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: What the hell are you still doing here? Didn't Rex throw you out already?",
        "Stacy: Throw out the mother of his child? I don't think so.",
        "Schuyler: Unbelievable. So you couldn't hold on to Rex any other way, and so you decided to make up a phony pregnancy--great.",
        "Stacy: It's not phony. I'm pregnant with Rex's child.",
        "Schuyler: Right, yeah, just like you were the stem cell donor to his real child.",
        "Stacy: Read it and weep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You were sleeping when I came in. I didn't want to wake you.",
        "Gigi: I wasn't really asleep. I just wasn't ready to see you.",
        "Rex: So when are we gonna talk about it?",
        "Gigi: About the fact that you slept with my sister, probably knocked her up and lied to me about it? How about now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I definitely think that we should talk about what happened between us last night.",
        "Nora: What happened at the launch last night. Between us?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: It was--",
        "Bo: Inevitable.",
        "Nora: Oh, uh, I was gonna say wrong.",
        "Bo: Inappropriate but, yeah--",
        "Nora: Yeah, and crazy. It was definitely--",
        "Bo: Crazy.",
        "Nora: Yes.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: [Sighs] I'm getting married today, Bo, to your brother.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Nora: And I love him.",
        "Bo: So do I. But--but that's why last night--",
        "Nora: Completely impossible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: What makes you think your parents will let you have the surgery? They've been intractable up till now.",
        "Matthew: Well, let's just say it wasn't in their best interests before.",
        "T\u00e9a: Actually, they didn't think it was in your best interests to have the surgery.",
        "Matthew: Everybody's best interest is about to change.",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you up to, Matthew?",
        "Matthew: I've got some leverage that I didn't have before.",
        "T\u00e9a: Leverage? Uh-huh. And where did you get this leverage?",
        "Matthew: I can't be the police commissioner and the D.A.'s son and not learn a few things.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha. Spill it. What you got, kid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: While we're in the land of wishful thinking, I certainly hope that T\u00e9a's non-answer turns itself into a yes.",
        "Todd: There's a vote of confidence.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I've got confidence in you, Todd, I really do. I have confidence that you're gonna destroy whatever feeling Blair may have for you.",
        "Todd: Don't worry, Dorian, I'll get T\u00e9a here.",
        "Dorian: Whatever it takes, just make sure that you and Blair never again have a...little indiscretion.",
        "Todd: You know, Dorian, I think you need to get some action. It would loosen you up a little bit.",
        "Dorian: Don't you dare alienate me. I am the only thing standing between you and grave bodily injury.",
        "Todd: Actually, you're not standing between me and anything. Blair's last words to me were, \"if you bring that tramp into this house, you're a dead man.\"",
        "Dorian: Oh, another reason to hope that T\u00e9a moves in. Ah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Where did you get an idea like that, sweetheart? Okay, your dad told you, didn't he?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Blair: No?",
        "Starr: He didn't. I overheard Aunt Dorian ripping into him about it.",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm just sorry you had to hear anything like that.",
        "Starr: Well, don't apologize to me for you having a sex life.",
        "Blair: Ah!",
        "Starr: I'm just surprised that it's with daddy. You guys have been at each others' throats lately.",
        "Blair: It's complicated, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: Well, obviously. I mean, what trick did Dad have to pull this time?",
        "Blair: He didn't. It was me.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I don't--I don't want to talk to you about this.",
        "Starr: Mom, I am an adult, remember? And if I have to live under the same roof as you and Dad, I have a right to know what's up.",
        "Blair: Okay. Well, what's up is that I got a little upset about what was starting up with your dad and T\u00e9a and what was ending with John and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Serial numbers have all been recorded and can be tracked, so don't go blowing it on pizza.",
        "Cole: Got it.",
        "John: Got the phone I gave you?",
        "Cole: Here you go.",
        "John: This is the number for a track phone that I'll have on me at all times.",
        "Cole: Tom?",
        "John: In case anyone takes it off you.",
        "Cole: Right, yeah, 'cause that would really suck if Llanview's Pablo Escobar found a cop's number all over my call history.",
        "Marty: Hey, that's not funny.",
        "Cole: Sorry. I shouldn't be cracking jokes. I know this is serious. And I am serious. Besides, John has me wired 15 ways from--",
        "Marty: I know, but you can still get hurt.",
        "Cole: Mom, I'll be okay.",
        "Marty: Being around these people is dangerous. Being around drugs for you is dangerous--you're still in recovery.",
        "Cole: What, you're worried that I'll backslide and start using again? It's okay, you can say it, 'cause I'm worried about it, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Okay, so what lab tech did you blackmail this time?",
        "Stacy: Nobody. A real doctor at the E.R. examined me and told me I was pregnant. You want me to pee on a stick for you or something?",
        "Schuyler: Ew. I'll pass.",
        "Stacy: How did you find about this news so fast anyway? Se I thought the only people who knew were my doctor, Rex, and... oh. Okay, so that's where my sister ran off to last night, straight to her pal Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: Stacy, we ran into each other and she was upset.",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, and your strong manly shoulders were just the place to cry.",
        "Schuyler: Cut it out.",
        "Stacy: Okay, listen, get your head out of the sand or wherever it is because this pregnancy, it's just as good for you as it is for me. It'll tear Rex and Gigi apart, and then Gigi will be free to be with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So why'd you lie to me? Did you think I wasn't gonna find out? Stacy was prancing all over town, crowing about the fact she had slept with you. I asked you point blank and you denied it.",
        "Rex: I didn't want to hurt you.",
        "Gigi: You didn't want-- at least then I was prepared, I was ready to hear it. Do you know how much worse it was hearing the truth the way I did, being humiliated by Stacy?",
        "Rex: I was--I was going to--",
        "Gigi: You should have just told me when I asked you, Rex. Even Schuyler told you to tell me the truth.",
        "Rex: Schuyler? You already talked to him about this?",
        "Gigi: This isn't about Schuyler, this is about us.",
        "Rex: Yeah, you're right, it's about us. Yeah, I made the choice to lie to you. I didn't want to tell you, Gigi. I didn't want to say it out loud because what I did--ahh... sleeping with Stacy, it makes me so damn mad. And the person I'm mad at is not just your sister. It's you, too.",
        "Gigi: You're mad at me?",
        "Rex: I was shoveled a load of bull for months by the woman who said that she loved me.",
        "Gigi: I was freaking out!",
        "Rex: Do you know that I was? I've never had a family, Gigi, not a real one, and that's what we were, and you blew us apart.",
        "Gigi: Stacy was blackmailing me.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I get it, but you should have come to me, you should have trusted me. We could have gotten through this together. But instead, you were breaking my heart day after day. You had me thinking that Stacy was this saint who's saving Shane. Like, what the hell was I supposed to do? You practically pushed me into bed with her.",
        "Gigi: I thought you understood that I did what I did for Shane.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I get that. But after Stacy gave you her ultimatum, why didn't you talk to a shrink or a priest or something? Instead, you had me go on thinking the worst, breaking my heart...over and over again. When I confronted Stacy about what she did, you know what she said? She said that we must have not been all that solid if we broke up as easily as we did.",
        "Gigi: Is that what you believe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: All I can tell you is that I found something that might be more effective than the law.",
        "T\u00e9a: Something legal?",
        "Matthew: Oh, absolutely.",
        "T\u00e9a: I hope you know what you're doing.",
        "Matthew: I do. Trust me. I got this.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. Break a leg-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean break a leg. I--",
        "Matthew: It's okay. I mean, it's not, but it's not your fault. All this pity and walking on eggshells around me--",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't pity you, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: You just don't want to say the wrong thing. Nobody does, and that's why this isn't okay, and that's why I need to do what I got to do.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, whatever it is you're doing, I wish you luck, but just in case, I'm not gonna cancel our court date just yet, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Bo, I've been giving this a lot of thought.",
        "Bo: Me, too.",
        "Nora: And I'm marrying your brother Clint because I love him.",
        "Bo: I know that.",
        "Nora: And what...what happened between us, whatever it is now--",
        "[Door opens]",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. Hello. Bo.",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "T\u00e9a: Nora, you look gorgeous.",
        "Nora: Thank you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Congratulations. It's your wedding day, isn't it?",
        "Nora: Yeah. You're doing everything you can to screw that up, though.",
        "T\u00e9a: I took a case, that's all. Oh, your son has something I think he wants to share with you.",
        "Matthew: Mom, Dad. Take a seat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, my marriage to John didn't start out as, like, real, but I don't know, I just thought maybe it might end up being something, you know?",
        "Starr: I'm sorry, Mom.",
        "Blair: That's okay. You know, a divorce is just tough no matter how you look at it. It's-- anyway, I was telling this story.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Blair: We were having that great family breakfast. We were having a lot of fun, all of us together, and then T\u00e9a walks in. She's rubbing herself all over your dad--",
        "Starr: Yeah, I saw that.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Well, I didn't like it, and I just felt a little bent out of shape about it, and one thing led to another, and... now you think I'm a green-eyed monster.",
        "Starr: No, no, no. I don't...",
        "Blair: Yeah, you do.",
        "Starr: Think that at all. No, I don't. Remember how tough of a time I was having deciding whether to give Hope to Marcie?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Starr: And you said that if I changed my mind, you would be behind me 100%?",
        "Blair: I would.",
        "Starr: Well, listen, if you have changed your mind about Dad, then I will be behind you 100%. Just forget about what I feel, okay? So, is Dad what you really want?",
        "Blair: Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You believe what Stacy said? That there wasn't enough between us to hold us together?",
        "Rex: I don't want to. But every time I think about how far you went to push me away and keep me away...it's like a knife in my heart...and I don't know where to put all that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You know, Matthew, we really need to be getting ready for the wedding.",
        "Matthew: This will only take a second. I just wanted to let you know that I'm gonna drop the lawsuit against you guys.",
        "Nora: Really?",
        "Bo: Oh, son, you know, I am so proud of you. I knew that you would see that the risks involved in this surgery, you know, they far outweigh any supposed benefits.",
        "Nora: Thank you, sweetheart. That's the most wonderful wedding present you could have given--",
        "Matthew: Not so fast. I'm not finished yet. I'll drop the lawsuit against you guys as soon as you sign this.",
        "Nora: This is a consent form for surgery.",
        "Bo: I don't get it. Your mom and I already refused to sign this.",
        "Matthew: Today's a new day.",
        "Nora: With the same parents who haven't changed their mind.",
        "Bo: There's no way that we'll risk your life for this surgery.",
        "Matthew: Fine. If me wanting to walk again isn't a good enough reason to sign it, I've got a better one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What I want with your father--",
        "Starr: Dad.",
        "Blair: How long have you been standing there?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I just walked in. But don't let me interrupt you.",
        "Blair: You're not. Because what I was about to tell your daughter is what I want with her father is absolutely nothing, even if you were the last man on earth, thank you very much.",
        "Dorian: Now that is music to my ears.",
        "T\u00e9a: Am I interrupting something? Hi. I Hope you don't mind. I let myself in with the key Todd gave me.",
        "Starr: I'm going to go check on Hope.",
        "Todd: So I guess this means you're moving in.",
        "T\u00e9a: Heh heh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Believe it or not, being around drugs 24/7 is gonna make it easier for me to stay clean.",
        "Marty: How?",
        "Cole: Because I'll be on the other side of it. You know, I'll be dealing with people who made their lives about drugs like I did. I mean, it'll be a huge reminder of what my life would be like if I hadn't quit. Plus, the first number I put on this phone even before Starr's was Rachel's, and I'm not afraid to call her if I need her.",
        "Marty: I'm proud of you. But just remember this is dangerous.",
        "Cole: Mom, I'm not gonna make any stupid choices. I'm a dad now, and there's no way I'm gonna let Hope grow up without her old man.",
        "Marty: Huh.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Cole: It's Starr.",
        "John: Go ahead.",
        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hey, you. Have you started bringing down the drug lords of Llanview yet?",
        "Cole: Not yet. John put me up in a pretty decent pad. I just wish you and Hope could be here with me.",
        "Marty: This is a mother's nightmare, you know that?",
        "John: I get it.",
        "Marty: He's a kid.",
        "John: I'm just asking you to trust him. And trust me that I'll keep him safe.",
        "Marty: I do trust you. In spite of the fact that when we were getting close I pulled away.",
        "John: Because of [Indistinct], Yeah. And I told you it's gonna be okay.",
        "Marty: I want it to be. I want it so badly I've forced it the worst way possible.",
        "John: How's that?",
        "Marty: I went and saw Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You know, I am honestly worried about you, Stacy. I mean, I thought once Rex knew the truth, once he turned his back on you that you would at least give up this little obsession of yours.",
        "Stacy: It's not an obsession.",
        "Schuyler: Well, what would you call threatening to let his son die if you can't have him?",
        "Stacy: What Rex and I had was real. It meant something, not just to me, but to him, too.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, you're deluding yourself.",
        "Stacy: So if making love to me didn't count, then why did he have to lie to Gigi about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I love you with all my heart...and soul. I've made such a mess of things. I don't blame you for sleeping with Stacy. I hate it...but I don't blame you. I blame me. And I just hope that I haven't lost you because of it.",
        "Rex: I'm here now.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, physically, but if you can't forgive me, then we're just going through the motions.",
        "Rex: Dammit, Morasco--",
        "Gigi: Dammit what?",
        "Rex: I love you. I want all this bad stuff to go away.",
        "Gigi: So do I. We can do it, Balsom. We can... forgive each other and start over.",
        "Rex: I want that. I want that more than anything.",

        "Schuyler: Who knows why Rex is pulling the crap that he does? He's not the first guy who's ever cheated and lied about it, but at least his lie is nothing compared to yours, and the truth came out.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, with a little help from you.",
        "Schuyler: Stacy, you would have gotten caught anyway. And you're gonna get caught again.",
        "Stacy: I told you, this is real. If-- if I weren't pregnant, why would I be looking at this, hmm?",
        "Schuyler: \"All you need to know when you're having a baby.\" Ha ha.",
        "Stacy: I want to know what to expect.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, or fake it believably.",
        "Stacy: Argh, my God, I told you I will take another pregnancy test if it will get you off my back. Just when you find out I'm telling the truth, you need to step up and do the same.",
        "Schuyler: Do the--tell the truth about what?",
        "Stacy: Your feelings for Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: We cannot let anything come between us again.",
        "Gigi: Even this baby you're having with Stacy?",
        "Rex: W-we don't even know that there is a baby, and if there is, we don't know that it's mine.",
        "Gigi: Rex, you saw that paper from the hospital.",
        "Rex: Oh, you're going there again. Stacy has all the power, and there's nothing we can do to fight her.",
        "Gigi: Okay, okay.",
        "Rex: Seriously, we had sex one time. What are the odds that she got pregnant?",
        "Gigi: About the same as when I got pregnant after my first time with you. Look, if Stacy is pregnant, then she's never gonna be out of our lives.",
        "Rex: Well, I'm sure as hell not gonna take it on her say-so. I'm gonna find out the truth for myself.",
        "Gigi: How?",
        "Rex: I'm a P.I., remember?",
        "Gigi: Uh, yeah. I'm gonna come with you.",
        "Rex: I meant what I said. We cannot let anything come between us. Whatever we find, whatever comes of this, we're solid.",
        "Gigi: Solid, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, I knew you couldn't resist getting in my face about this. You better sleep with one eye open.",
        "T\u00e9a: Heh heh.",
        "Todd: Where are your bags?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I didn't bring any bags. I just stopped by to return the key. Much as I think it would be a blast to share clothes and girl talk with this one over here...",
        "Blair: Stop.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm afraid I can't move in here, but thank you, Dorian, and thank you, Todd, for the invite.",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I wish I could be there, too. There are crazy things happening here with my parents.",
        "Cole: Did they figure out I spent the night there?",
        "Starr: No, trust me. They have other things on their minds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What is that conniving witch up to now?",
        "Dorian: I would think you'd be happy that she isn't moving in.",
        "Blair: Oh. You know what? I don't trust her as far as I could throw her, but I just want to know what she's saying to Todd right now.",
        "Dorian: Or are you really concerned about what Todd is saying to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Why won't you move in with me?",
        "T\u00e9a: After all these years, you still don't know me, do you?",
        "Todd: I want to know you, but you don't give me the chance.",
        "T\u00e9a: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Why'd you go see Todd?",
        "Marty: Because it's been over a year and I'm still stuck. And I guess a screwed-up part of me thought that I...well, that he could set me free.",
        "John: Man, he couldn't free a hamster from its cage.",
        "Marty: Huh. Yeah, I quickly figured that out. At least I got the chance to vent.",
        "John: What did he do?",
        "Marty: Oh, he made it all about himself.",
        "John: Big surprise.",
        "Marty: Yeah, he actually asked me to psychoanalyze him. Yeah. But I didn't really want to help him. I was there to help myself, but that wasn't gonna work either. Yeah, I'm the only one that can do that.",
        "John: [Sighs] You're not alone.",
        "Marty: I know.",
        "John: I saw Blair when we signed the divorce papers. The marriage is officially over.",
        "Marty: Well, that's a relief because I want to do everything I can to move on, and I would hate to start by having an affair with a married man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We've been over this.",
        "Nora: Sweetheart, your father and I love you so much. Until this surgery comes without all the risks, there's no reason in the world we would ever sign this consent form.",
        "Matthew: Well, how about this for a reason: If you guys don't sign this and let me have the operation, I'll tell Uncle Clint about you guys making out at Grandpa's lunch the night before his wedding to you.",
        "Bo: What are you talking about?",
        "Matthew: I saw you two kissing outside last night.",
        "Nora: Oh, that. That was--that was nothing. Your father was--",
        "Bo: I was just congratulating your mom on her wedding.",
        "Matthew: That's not what it looked like to me. But sure, maybe Uncle Clint will buy that right after I tell him about it. And you know what's funny? For a while, I would have thought that that was the coolest thing in the world, you and Mom getting back together.",
        "Bo: Matthew, your mom and I aren't getting back together.",
        "Matthew: Ah, whatever. I can't even think about that right now. Right now, I have to think about what I want, what I need, and that's this surgery that will help me walk again.",
        "Nora: Okay, so instead of suing us, you're blackmailing us?",
        "Matthew: You know, blackmail is such an ugly word. It's just business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I just don't want your life to be hell because of me.",
        "Starr: Cole, I'm the luckiest girl in the world because of you.",

        "Starr: Well, I don't care what anyone else thinks of you. I know who you really are.",
        "John: Hey, Cole.",
        "Cole: Hey, listen, I got to go. I don't know when I'm gonna be able to talk to you again.",
        "Starr: I love you, Cole.",
        "Cole: I love you, too. Kiss Hope for me, okay?",
        "John: Come on, we need to get started.",
        "Marty: Okay, okay, okay. Going, going, going.",
        "Cole: Mom.",

        "Blair: Okay, I don't even care what they're talking about. I don't.",
        "Dorian: You do so care.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Dorian: You know, there's only one proven cure for lovesickness, and that is find yourself somebody new.",
        "Blair: Tried that. It didn't work.",

        "T\u00e9a: I don't want to be used as a pawn in the eternal game between you and Blair.",
        "Todd: You won't be.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, all right, let me put this another way. I don't want to just be, you know, a willing sex partner for you whenever you want that. You know, I need more than just, \"hey, baby, let's do it.\" I--believe it or not, I want--I want to be wooed, okay? I want to be romanced. I want to be swept off my feet by a man. I want the whole thing. I want flowers and dinner. Champagne. Ha ha. I want to go on a real date with you before we decide your place or mine. But more than anything, I want a man who has eyes only for me. Do you think you could be that man, Todd?",

        "Doctor: I'm sorry. That's confidential information.",
        "Stacy: It's okay, Doc. You can tell them. Better yet, I'd like to have another blood test taken just to be sure, you know.",
        "Doctor: Oh, certainly. That can be arranged through the lab.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, and if it's okay, I'd like to sit with her and hold her hand.",
        "Stacy: Well, actually, I'd rather Rex be there. I mean, this involves you.",
        "Doctor: Fine. Well, whoever's coming, please come this way.",
        "Gigi: Go ahead. Make sure she doesn't pull a fast one.",
        "Rex: Don't. Don't even talk to me.",
        "Schuyler: So how are you doing?",
        "Gigi: Better than I was last night. Thanks for letting me spill my guts to you.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, no problem. Glad I was there. So you and Rex, I mean...",
        "Gigi: We had it out, and... we're stronger now than we ever were.",
        "Schuyler: That's great. That's really great.",

        "Cole: Hey, Asher, it's Cole Thornhart. Yeah, yeah, it's been a while. Hey, listen, man, I need to see you.",
        "John: Just relax, all right. This is just stage 1. Don't push to get everything we need on the first day, got it? Stick to the script. All right, don't be going all maverick on me. All right, you're not to do anything we didn't specifically talk about.",
        "Cole: I won't.",
        "John: Anything else you need?",
        "Cole: I don't think so.",
        "John: Okay, I'll check in later.",

        "Todd: I'd like to make another proposal. Would you, T\u00e9a Francesca Delgado...do me the honor of becoming my date tonight--ha ha--at my sister's wedding? And by date I mean--",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I would love to go on a date with you. Um, you can get up now. Huh.",
        "Todd: I'll pick you up at 7:00. What kind of flower do you like?",
        "T\u00e9a: Figure it out. See you later.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Bye, Blair. Ha ha ha!",

        "Bo: It is.",

        "Bo: I hope we raised our son better than this. What can we do?",
        "Nora: Guess it's out of our hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I watched her and the doctor like a hawk every step of the way. There's no way this blood test was tampered with.",
        "Gigi: Good. Then we can expose Stacy for the liar she is and dropkick her out of our lives for good.",
        "Doctor: I have the results of your blood test. If you'd like to come with me.",
        "Stacy: No, no. It's okay. You can tell me right here in front of my friends and family.",

        "Stacy: How soon can I have a sonogram? I just can't wait to see my baby.",
        "Doctor: Oh, we can take a look at about 12 weeks.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asher: Heard you got busted. What happened with that?",
        "Cole: I got caught with the drugs you gave me after graduation. Thought for sure I was heading to prison, but the judge cut me a break, gave me community service instead.",
        "Asher: Wear one of those orange suits and pick up garbage on the highway?",
        "Cole: Whatever keeps me out of prison.",
        "Asher: Yeah, I hear ya. Nice crib. Who's footing it?",
        "Cole: That's, uh, sort of what I want to talk to you about.",
        "Asher: First things first, though, right? What's your pleasure?",
        "Cole: I'm not interested in using. I'm interested in selling."
