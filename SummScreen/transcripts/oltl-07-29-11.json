        "During the premier of \"Vicker Man,\" everybody is shocked when David's movie is erased and replaced by the porn film of Nate and Deanna. Nate has no way to explain himself and Dani is distraught and furious. Yet nobody knows where the porn film came from until Rick stands up and introduces himself assuming that he will become a success after showing all the movie patrons his brilliant work. David and Dorian tell him they will arrest him since she is the mayor, his father is the police commissioner and he destroyed \" Vicker Man.\" But he tells them that he does not have access to the porn film. It's now in the possession of \"that bootlegger who did it\". Little does Nate know what he did when he let Rick give him the DVD. Rex is on the warpath with Jack Manning and goes to confront him with a gun although everyone is distracted and cannot see Rex. Original Todd is ready to reveal himself when Baker finds him and is ready to kill not only him but current Todd, Tomas and John and any or all people who know \"the secret,\" but original Todd manages to subdue Baker, tie him up, then appears to reveal his identity at the theater to all the people in Todd Manning's life."

        "John: Why?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Because it's illegal. And because the people he works for are extremely dangerous.",

        "Mr. Patel: This is not family- friendly entertainment! My daughter-in-law and son had no idea they were exposing their unborn child to x-rated smut! Vimal, take your wife out of here.",

        "Old Todd: I prefer to deliver my messages in person.",

        "Markko: Did you think this would be funny?",
        "David: Do you see me laughing?",
        "Markko: Good. Because there's nothing to laugh about. You have destroyed both of your careers and taken me and Langston down with you, not to mention turning Renee's hotel into some sort of porn palace.",
        "David: We don't have to worry about that. For Renee, this is kind of like returning to her roots.",
        "Dorian: Oh, David, please don't make things any worse. Just get the thing unplugged.",

        "Markko: What? No, no, no. Don't you turn this back around on me.",
        "Dorian: I didn't give it to anyone. David didn't give it to anybody. For goodness sakes, that is certainly not our film.",

        "Cristian: Like that mustard.",
        "Shaun: Hey. I'm glad you took my advice, but--",
        "Cristian: She's not really pregnant.",
        "Shaun: So it's like it was before? I thought you said she was pretending that it was her husband's?",
        "Cristian: She still is. Vimal knows the truth, but he hasn't had the courage to tell his parents.",
        "Shaun: So you stepped in.",
        "Cristian: Exactly.",
        "Shaun: I'm almost afraid to ask, but how?",

        "Rick: Whoo! Oh, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, may I please have your attention? In fact, I think I already have it, but can you please just keep it down for a little bit? I am sorry to interrupt, but I would like to introduce myself. Rick Powers, president and CEO of Rick Powers Productions, the finest purveyor of adult entertainment east of Las Vegas and north of the big easy. And tonight, I give you a sneak preview of \"Hold the Diploma,\" the next entry in the famous \"Hold the\" series, starring the brand-new discovery, up-and- comer buster ridge! Where are you, buster? There you are, buddy. Let's give it up for buster! Whoo!",

        "John: Who's Baker?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: He worked for the CIA. Then he went rogue.",
        "John: And he's hooked up with Manning?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Todd's been answering to him for years.",
        "John: That's funny--Manning claims he doesn't answer to anyone.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Who he claims to be and who he is are like night and day. And when he finally got the guts to push back, Baker tried to have him killed.",
        "John: So Baker's behind Manning's shooting?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And he doesn't like to fail. So he's come here to finish the job.",
        "John: When?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: He's here now. And as long as he is, people that Todd cares about, and more importantly, the people that I care about? Potential targets.",
        "John: That's some story. So what's a guy like Baker-- what's he want with Manning?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Honestly can't say.",
        "John: You can't or you won't?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I can't. I don't know everything.",
        "John: Don't sell yourself short. When you're not lying, you know a lot. Were do you get your information?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I used to work for Baker, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: Drag him inside.",
        "Old Todd: I'm-- Ok. So now what?",
        "Baker: Don't get ahead of yourself.",
        "Old Todd: How did you even get here?",
        "Baker: We knew you had help from somebody on the dock. When we found out he was McBain's informant, it wasn't too difficult to figure out where to look.",
        "Old Todd: Do you have a decoder ring?",
        "Baker: How much did you tell him?",
        "Old Todd: Tell who?",
        "Baker: McBain.",
        "Old Todd: I told him that the guy running around town with my name is a fake.",
        "Baker: Oh, that's a shame.",
        "Old Todd: Why?",
        "Baker: It would've been so much simpler just to have to dispose of you and Tom\u00e1s. But now I'm gonna have to add John McBain to the list.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: T\u00e9a spoke to you. I know that. So my CIA connections can't come as a surprise.",
        "John: If they're real.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You think I'm lying?",
        "John: I don't know. Have to look for some verification.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Forget it. Company's not gonna acknowledge me.",
        "John: No? Why is that?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Because of the things I did under Baker's command. I don't like to think about those days.",
        "John: Why didn't you go to your higher-ups? Why didn't you talk to your handlers?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Because Baker led us to believe those missions were sanctioned. When I realized they weren't, it was too late.",
        "John: Too late for what?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: To make things right. A lot of people paid a huge price for those missions.",
        "John: What people? What did you do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm sure she's being careful.",
        "Shaun: With a water balloon?",
        "Cristian: What if it's not just any water balloon? Did you know I was an artist?",
        "Shaun: And what she needed was an engineer.",
        "Cristian: It'll be fine.",
        "Shaun: If you say so. I just hope it doesn't blow up in Rama's face.",

        "Mr. Patel: Yes, our Vimal is a lucky man. We can always count on Rama.",
        "Vimal: She does have a way of coming through.",
        "Rama: It's nothing. For my family, I'll do anything.",
        "Mr. Patel: Are you feeling a little stronger?",
        "Mrs. Patel: I just need a few minutes to clear my head.",
        "Vimal: Rama, thank you for being so-- thoughtful and caring.",
        "Mr. Patel: We'll just try to forget what happened here tonight, all right? We'll go home, we'll have a nice, hot shower, and then we'll just-- what was that?",
        "Rama and Vimal: What was what?",
        "Mr. Patel: Something must have spilled. I'm all wet.",
        "Rama: That's strange. How strange. I mean--",

        "Baker: Use your imagination.",
        "Old Todd: You're not gonna kill a cop.",
        "Baker: I wish you hadn't made it necessary, but we can't have people spreading ugly rumors that there are two Todd Mannings.",
        "Old Todd: There's only one. Me.",
        "Baker: If that's what you want to believe in your last few minutes on this earth, you go right ahead. Now move.",
        "Old Todd: You're not gonna terminate me here?",
        "Baker: And have you be found wearing that face? No. Too many questions. What we need is a nondescript location where no one will intervene and where your body will not be found. Now go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So there's a rogue CIA agent, and he's gonna start killing people if he's not stopped. Why are you telling me this? What do you want from me?",

        "Vimal: Stop. It's over. It's over.",
        "Mr. Patel: What's over? What's going on?",

        "Mrs. Patel: Vimal, it is not like you to deceive us.",

        "Dani: Well, isn't it obvious? He got tired of waiting for me to have sex with him, so he just did it with the first available girl. God, I'm an idiot. I'm such an idiot. Every time I would ask about Deanna, he'd say that they were just friends. He said that she was still hung up on James.",
        "Starr: She was. That's why this doesn't make any sense, Dani. Why would he do it on camera where someone could see? Why would he do something like that?",
        "Dani: I don't know and I don't even care. I just want to get that picture out of my head and I never will. I'm-- I need to go home. I really need to go home.",

        "Starr: Then I'll go. I'll go.",

        "Vimal: No. Statesville prison, where I was incarcerated. Mrs. Patel: What? Why would you be in prison?",
        "Rama: Because of me. I convinced him to take responsibility for a crime that he did not commit, because I thought it--I thought it would benefit us in the long run.",
        "Mr. Patel: What kind of benefit does a man derive from having a criminal record, I'd like to know.",
        "Rama: None. But Vimal trusted me and I betrayed his devotion by letting him believe that I was pregnant with his child when I wasn't. There's no excuse. It's unforgivable what I did.",

        "Rama: It was crazy. I know that now. It was stupid.",
