        "Gigi: Rex, I was just thinking about you.",
        "Rex: Oh, you don't know how glad I am to hear your voice.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Rex: Okay, listen, listen, I need to talk to you.",
        "Gigi: Oh, Rex, I can barely hear you. It's a terrible connection. Where are you?",
        "Rex: Just -- just answer me this. Is it 2008 where you are?",
        "Gigi: Uh, yeah. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Where's Jared this morning?",
        "Natalie: He's on a job interview and then he's having lunch with his dad. Have you seen Mom?",
        "Tess: No, but, um, I went to bed early last night.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, so did we.",
        "Tess: She probably just went out early this morning, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Okay, well, I thought the same thing, except for my car is still gone, and she took my car last night when she went to go get Nash's wine.",
        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "Tess: She's probably all right, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Okay, so where's Mom? I mean, where's the car?",
        "Tess: Do you really think something could have happened to Mom?",
        "Viki: It did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlo: Once my daughter and Jonas are married, I want her image on every banner and tea towel in this place.",
        "Bitterman: Yes, Sir. Is everything going as planned?",
        "[Carlo laughs]",
        "Carlo: Indeed, the groom is just now tending to a nagging last-minute problem.",
        "Tina: So, any news about Sarah, and what about Cristian?",
        "Jonas: Did you honestly think that your daughter and that boyfriend of hers were going to survive jumping the falls? Guards, take the impostors and get them ready for the wedding.",
        "Tina: We're invited?",
        "Jonas: Oh, well, of course you are. You and the phony prince are practically guests of honor.",
        "Cain: Ahem, thanks for the invite, but how about Tina and I just send you a fondue pot and we'll call it even, huh?",
        "[Jonas laughs]",
        "Jonas: And miss all the festivities? I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Cain: That's what I thought.",
        "Jonas: Guards, take them away.",
        "Cain: Excuse me, I am the prince of Mendorra. Prince Helmut Krakoff, get your hands off me!",
        "Antonio: It will be a cold day in hell before I let you marry Talia.",
        "Jonas: There's no way in hell you can stop me, Vega. Talia will get over you. She'll have no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You guys slept together last night?",
        "John: You know, I don't think it's any of your business.",
        "Todd: Oh, I don't care who she hops in bed with, really. It's tiring to try to keep track of them all.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: If you want to be the next down the line, then that's fine with me.",
        "John: Can we get out of here?",
        "Blair: Sure.",
        "Todd: So, it's true, huh?",
        "Blair: You know, Todd, you can think whatever you want because you will anyway.",
        "Todd: All right, I will. I guess this means you won't get on my case for sleeping with a chick last night myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: God, that's a hell of a thing, isn't it? The diner burning down?",
        "Brody: Yeah, it says here they don't know what started it.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Let's just hope everybody got out all right.",
        "Brody: They did. A friend of mine works there.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, mine, too. Gigi Morasco.",
        "Brody: You know Gigi?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I'm, uh, Charlie Banks.",
        "Brody: Brody Lovett. Wait, I know you. Last night.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Charlie: Yeah, A.A. meeting.",
        "Brody: Where I spilled my guts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, are you still there?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I'm here.",
        "Gigi: What's going on? Where are you?",
        "Rex: Look, this is going to sound really weird. Uh, I'm -- I'm stuck.",
        "Gigi: Stuck where?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It bothers you, doesn't it, Blair?",
        "Blair: What, that you slept with someone what was her name, Todd, Inflatable Betty?",
        "Todd: No, actually, it's not.",
        "Blair: How much did that set you back?",
        "Todd: How does it feel, John, to be with someone who's still in love with me?",
        "Blair: Yeah, you wish.",
        "Todd: She's the most amazing, most understanding woman I've ever known.",
        "Blair: What's amazing -- that you could find any woman that would want to go to bed with you.",
        "Todd: Who said anything about that? We're just sleeping in the same room.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Blair: And you're sharing this, why?",
        "Todd: Just to let you know how important she is to me. I really respect her. You know what, John? You may want to have Blair checked out by a doctor. You don't want to contract anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Mom.",
        "Viki: Hey.",
        "Natalie: Where were you? We were getting worried.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm fine, I'm fine now.",
        "Natalie: \"Now\"? Did something happen?",
        "Viki: Yeah, I was in a car accident.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, an accident?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Are you okay?",
        "Viki: Yes, darling, I'm fine, but I was in the hospital overnight.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, why didn't you call us?",
        "Viki: Well, because it was late and it wasn't really anything you needed to deal with. Especially not you, darling.",
        "Tess: Me? Why me?",
        "Viki: Well, I didn't think you needed any more upsetting news.",
        "Tess: Oh. Okay.",
        "Natalie: How bad was it?",
        "Viki: Technically, for a little while, I was dead.",
        "Natalie: Dead?",
        "Viki: Yeah. I went into cardiac arrest, and -- but Dorian got my heart started again, so --",
        "Natalie: Dorian was there?",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah. Listen, I was driving to the vineyard and I found her hitchhiking on the road and so, of course, I gave her a lift.",
        "Natalie: I can't believe that we didn't know about any of this happening.",
        "Viki: Well, you know what? I had a battery of tests last night and this morning, and I am totally fine. The problem is, darling, and I'm really very sorry, your car, it's destroyed, it's totaled.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, Mom, I don't care about that. How in the world did this happen?",
        "Viki: Your brakes failed.",
        "Natalie: Are you kidding me? I just had this car completely checked out. It was -- it was -- the brakes were fine.",
        "Tess: Are you sure that was it?",
        "Viki: I think so, but the car is in the shop now, so I'm sure they'll figure out what happened to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You heard everything about my kid.",
        "Charlie: Everything about Gigi and Rex's kid.",
        "Brody: Oh, man. Well, why didn't you stop me?",
        "Charlie: No crosstalk at A.A. meetings, it's one of the rules.",
        "Brody: I promised Gigi I wasn't going to let it get out.",
        "Charlie: It won't.",
        "Brody: Yeah, I'm supposed to believe you won't say anything?",
        "Charlie: What you hear at a meeting stays at a meeting, another rule.",
        "Brody: A hard and fast one?",
        "Charlie: Unless it's something illegal, like murder.",
        "Brody: Raising somebody else's kid isn't illegal.",
        "Charlie: It's not illegal.",
        "Brody: Here it comes, the lecture.",
        "Charlie: No, no lecture, but I do have a question. Do you think that you're doing Shane or Rex a favor by lying to them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Rex, you're stuck on route 68? Where is that?",
        "Rex: No, no, not route 68, the year '68.",
        "Gigi: Sorry, Balsom, I'm not copying.",
        "Rex: It's really hard to explain. I -- I need your help.",
        "Gigi: Did you say you need help?",
        "Rex: Everyone thinks that Bo is Asa and that I'm Bo and I'm being shipped off to Vietnam --",
        "[Phone static]",
        "Gigi: You're in Vietnam?",
        "Rex: No, I'm in --",
        "[Static]",
        "Gigi: Balsom? Balsom, are you there?",
        "Rex: Morasco -- Gigi, it's Rex, wait.",
        "Gigi: Please answer me, Rex.",
        "Rex: No, don't hang up, okay? Don't let me lose you, Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Mom, are you sure you're all right?",
        "Viki: Yes, honey, I'm -- I'm actually just a little tired, that's all. I -- I don't -- don't really remember much about what happened, but I do remember it was painless. It was actually almost pleasant.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Hopefully, Nash had a pleasant death.",
        "Viki: Darling, I'm awfully sorry. I didn't -- you know I didn't mean that.",
        "Tess: No, no, no, it's okay, I'm just -- I'm happy you were able to come back to us.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Natalie: Mom.",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm?",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry to bother you with this now, but I just wanted to let you know that International Heart Organization called like three times this morning.",
        "Viki: I promised to give them an answer today.",
        "Natalie: An answer to what?",
        "Viki: I've been asked to be a sort of ambassador for them, to go and visit heart patients and talk to their families about my transplant and actually try to get some support for the organ donor program.",
        "Tess: And you're going to go, aren't you?",
        "Viki: I don't know, sweetheart, after last night, I mean, they want me to go to Africa.",
        "Natalie: They do?",
        "Viki: Yeah, for several weeks. I think I'm just going to turn them down.",
        "Tess: Well, why?",
        "Natalie: Well, after what she just went through --",
        "Viki: Well, darling, I don't think it would be right to leave you.",
        "Tess: No, no, no, you have to do it. You have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Rex Balsom left Gigi flat, never looked back. Charlie Banks -- same guy that said he was Balsom's father.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, that would be me.",
        "Brody: So, you got a lie or two under your own belt.",
        "Charlie: I did, and my lies hurt Rex very badly.",
        "Brody: Look, it's Gigi's call, it's not mine.",
        "Charlie: Okay.",
        "Brody: I mean, what if Balsom found out and he didn't want Shane. You think that's not going to hurt the kid?",
        "Charlie: Look, I don't know, but I would bet serious money, if I had any, that Rex would like to know if he had a son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm here, Morasco, can you hear me?",
        "Gigi: Hello, Rex?",
        "Rex: Damn, damn, we got cut off!",
        "Bo: There's nothing Gigi could have done anyway.",
        "Rex: I got to try again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: God. Come on, Balsom, pick up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm not even getting a signal now.",
        "Bo: Because there's no signal in 1968.",
        "Rex: Well, I got through before.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, it's not happening now.",
        "Rex: What are we supposed to do?",
        "Bo: Plan B.",
        "Rex: What's plan B?",
        "Bo: I'm working on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: He's making all this up, anyway -- let's go.",
        "Todd: No, no, it's true. Remember the fortune teller who said I had a woman over at my place that day? And you come over all crazed like a --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Oh, a woman who would boil a live rabbit.",
        "Blair: Oh, shut up.",
        "Todd: You should have seen her, John. She marched over, checked it out for herself. If that isn't not over me, I don't know what is.",
        "John: Yeah, she told me, so what?",
        "Todd: Doesn't that bother you a little bit?",
        "John: Not as much as it seems to be bothering you.",
        "Todd: You were right that day, Blair. There was a woman there and she was close enough you could smell her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What's that feel like?",
        "Jonas: Hmm?",
        "Antonio: To force a woman who can't stomach you to marry you.",
        "Jonas: I'm going to make Talia royalty. I'm going to give her things that you couldn't possibly imagine. Jewels, castles --",
        "Antonio: Talia would rather spend the afternoon with a .357 plugging your silhouette.",
        "Jonas: Hmm.",
        "Antonio: She's going to make your life hell for making my brother and Sarah go over those falls.",
        "Jonas: Guards.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlo: Are you satisfied with the punishment we have in store for the faux prince and princess?",
        "Bitterman: They made fools of their loyal subjects, and none were more loyal than I.",
        "Cain: Yeah, bug off, Bitterman. Best I can do.",
        "Tina: Carlo, I know you want to see Cain and I dead, but my Sarah -- why did you have to kill my little girl?",
        "Carlo: An eye for an eye, Tina.",
        "Tina: Sarah was an angel. Johnny Dee was a bastard, just like you. I hope you rot in hell.",
        "Carlo: You'll be there to greet me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: What about Antonio? What have you done with him?",
        "Carlo: You look absolutely ravishing.",
        "Talia: I want to see Antonio, and until I do, this wedding is not happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jonas: On your knees. You have that little value for your life, huh?",
        "Antonio: I got one thing to say. You treat her right.",
        "Jonas: Or what? Are you going to come back from the dead, Vega, and save her?",
        "Antonio: Just do it. Say you'll do it.",
        "Jonas: Of course. Of course I'll do it. Just until I get rid of her father.",
        "Antonio: Jonas. No, you -- you tell her -- tell her I love her.",
        "[Antonio moans]",
        "Jonas: Goodbye, Vega.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Darling, you said that you moved back here so that you could have your family around you. How could I go off to Africa?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] I know, but I have dad, I have Bree, I have Natalie, even Jared. You know, they've been amazing. So, I'm -- I'm covered.",
        "Viki: But still, sweetheart --",
        "Tess: Mom, I would never be able to forgive myself if I kept you from doing something worth while. And Nash, you know -- Nash would have wanted you to go. You'd be honoring his memory.",
        "Viki: Well, that's a very sweet thing to say.",
        "Tess: And what about you, you know?",
        "Viki: What about me?",
        "Tess: Well, you know, after all that's happened, don't you think it's important that you get some distance from Charlie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Rex had his chance with Gigi, and he threw her under the bus.",
        "Charlie: Wait -- he didn't even know she was pregnant, right?",
        "Brody: He took off. She didn't know how to find him to tell him. You weren't there when I met her. She was just a kid, pregnant, alone.",
        "Charlie: And what you did, offering to be the father of her son, that was a pretty stand-up thing to do.",
        "Brody: I was in love with her. I -- I'm the only dad that kid knows. It's all Gigi's doing -- that she wanted a dad Shane could be proud of, not some creep who bailed on her.",
        "Charlie: Well, maybe if he had known that Shane was his son --",
        "Brody: Look, I know you feel guilty about what you did to Rex and you want to make it up to him.",
        "[Charlie sighs]",
        "Brody: But find another way and leave us alone. Rex didn't even bother to say goodbye to her. What makes you think he would have stuck around if he'd known she was going to have his kid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Forget it, Balsom.",
        "Rex: Damn it, damn!",
        "Bo: Now, cool off. Hey, this isn't helping.",
        "Rex: Cool off? Cool off -- you see this? Look. Over 1,000 soldiers were killed in Vietnam last month -- one month.",
        "Bo: And over 16,000 by the end of the year. 58,256 names are on that wall. I know some of those names. Guys are alive right now. They won't be here this time next year.",
        "Rex: I don't want to die, Bo.",
        "Bo: I told you, I --",
        "Rex: I know -- I know. I'm you and you were fine. But what if I screw up? Then Asa loses a son, Clint a brother. Drew will never have existed. And what about Matthew? Huh, what happens to him? Does he just disappear in 2008? Look, we got to do something. I need to get through to Gigi somehow.",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Bo: I've an idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I have no way of knowing how Rex would have dealt with Gigi's pregnancy.",
        "Brody: That's right, you don't. And let's leave it that way and keep that kid happy, okay? And he is. I'm his hero.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, you couldn't ask for much more in a dad, could you? But let me ask you something else. You said something else last night at the meeting. You said that Gigi is really not into you. So, now, do you really want to live with a kid that is not yours and a woman who is in love with someone else?",
        "Brody: I'm working it out.",
        "Charlie: What, by going to A.A. meetings?",
        "Brody: I did that for Gigi.",
        "Charlie: Why?",
        "Brody: Look, you've got that code of silence thing going on. So, we're good, right? Lips zipped.",
        "Gigi: I just got off the phone with Rex, he needs my help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I don't care whether you have a woman in your house that day or any other day, Todd.",
        "Todd: You cared before.",
        "Blair: Why are choosing now to rub my face in it? Why didn't you do it that day, hmm?",
        "Todd: I don't want to break your heart, again.",
        "Blair: The only person whose heart is going to break is that new little girlfriend of yours when she finds out what a bastard you are, unless she's a bigger idiot that I already think she is.",
        "Todd: She's actually very smart.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Todd: Good education -- she's classy.",
        "Blair: Oh -- I know, like tea. Were you going to use her to try to take my kids away from me again?",
        "Todd: I'm not using her at all for anything.",
        "Blair: Really? You use everybody for everything, Todd. You get off on hurting women.",
        "Todd: I'd never hurt her. You know what? You and John can just go at it like monkeys. What I have with this woman is pure and sweet.",
        "Blair: Oh, \"pure and sweet.\" Hmm. Does she know that you're a convicted rapist?",
        "Todd: Did John tell you that you're nothing but a stand-in for Marty Saybrooke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Do you remember how Emma and her son showed up here last night?",
        "Rex: Little Spencer Truman? Yeah, I remember.",
        "Bo: Yeah, and they looked exactly like Gigi and Shane.",
        "Rex: I think that freaked me out more than any of this.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, I know it. Emma said she was staying at a little crummy hotel that was across from a cafe.",
        "Rex: You think she was talking about the Bon-Jour?",
        "Bo: Well, everything connected with this whole nightmare has something to do with someone or something that we know from 2008.",
        "Rex: So?",
        "Bo: So Delphina told you, \"follow the pie.\"",
        "Rex: Oh, so now you're taking Delphina seriously.",
        "Bo: It's 1968. I'm my Pa -- you're me. What choice do I have?",
        "Rex: Good point.",
        "Bo: So I say we follow the pie. We follow it to Paris, Texas. We find Emma.",
        "Rex: Wait, why, so you can sleep with her and father David Vickers?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Did something happen to Rex?",
