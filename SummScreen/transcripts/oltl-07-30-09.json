        "Bo and Nora are both \"curious\" about whether Matthew will go through with informing Clint that he saw the two of them kissing before Nora's wedding day to Clint. He tells them no, he'll stay out of it. But he still won't accept their decision not to approve the surgery. When Rachel finds out her mother kissed Bo, she asks her if she really should marry Clint after all. Viki tells everybody she wants to marry Charlie. But she relives all of her many marriages. Langston and Markko are very disappointed that his father won't let him come home. Starr is missing Cole while he goes undercover. Cole goes and attempts to \"work\" Asher so that Asher will lead him to the drug dealers. John asks Brody to help the police station investigate the drug trafficking. Jessica doesn't know what to do when she notices Bree with an unidentified stuffed elephant. Bree tells her mom it's from Daddy. Jessica remembers that Nash gave their daughter elephant toys and only he would know about that. And she can tell that an unseen person is outside that could be Nash."

        "John: Come on in.",
        "Brody: John, you wanted to see me?",
        "John: Yeah, close the door.",
        "Brody: What's going on?",
        "John: We need to talk about this.",
        "Brody: My acceptance from the L.P.D.?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: You're out of the academy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm interested in selling.",
        "Asher: Selling what? Chocolate bars for the soccer team?",
        "Cole: This is no joke. I want to start dealing. I need money.",
        "Asher: Really? Looks like you're doing pretty good.",
        "Cole: Maybe to you, but it's not good enough for my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How does this sound for Markko? \"Cozy studio in up-and-coming neighborhood. Needs T.L.C.\" Tender loving care?",
        "Starr: It's a dump.",
        "Langston: Yeah, no wonder the rent's so cheap. Oh, it doesn't matter anyway. Markko still can't afford it.",
        "Starr: Well, don't worry. I'm sure my Aunt Viki will let him stay.",
        "Langston: Well, I know, and she's really cool, but imagine you're Markko. Your parents throw you out, cut you off, and you get thrown in a house where people drink T\u00e9a and have lunch at the country club.",
        "Starr: That's what everyone in our house does.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but your Aunt Viki's getting married today. Markko just really feels like he's in the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, which color? I need classy enough for a wedding, but sassy enough for a reception.",
        "Markko: Uh--",
        "Jessica: Natalie, leave Markko alone.",
        "Natalie: What? I need advice.",
        "Jessica: No, no, we need to get these dresses in the car and get out of here.",
        "Markko: I'll do it.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no, you don't have to.",
        "Markko: No, I want to. It's the least I can do.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Thanks. Huh. So, where's Jared?",
        "Natalie: He took his father out for a little father/son bonding before the wedding.",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, I'm delighted that the fish are biting, and I'm delighted that you and Jared are having a wonderful time, but I want to make something very clear. I'm not cleaning fish on my wedding day. All right, just make sure you leave in time to get to the church. Well, I can't wait to marry you, either. I love you. Bye.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Viki: Come in.",
        "[Disconnects phone]",
        "Viki: Hello!",
        "Noelle: Hi.",
        "Viki: Hi, honey! So good to see you!",
        "[Noelle chuckles]",
        "Noelle: Oh, I'm sorry to stop by without calling first, but I had to see the bride on her wedding day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hi, is this--oh, God, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "Rachel: It's fine, Mom.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God, everything--everything just went wrong. Hi, sweetie.",
        "Rachel: Hi.",
        "Nora: I mean, first, the clasp on my necklace broke. No necklace. And then I forgot to put pantyhose in the bag and I didn't realize that until I got in the car, and then I had to go back to the house to do that. I'm running so late.",
        "[Rachel sighs]",
        "Rachel: Mom, relax. You have plenty of time, okay? Everything is set for the wedding. All you have to do is get dressed.",
        "Nora: Yeah, sure--if there's actually going to be a wedding.",
        "Rachel: What are you talking about?",
        "Nora: Go ask your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Hey, how's it going, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: Not well. I've searched every inch of your uncle's room for your grandfather's cufflinks.",
        "Matthew: Oh, I borrowed them for the prom. They're on my dresser.",
        "Nigel: Oh. Thanks heavens. We don't need any bad omens today.",
        "Matthew: Is Uncle Clint in his room?",
        "Nigel: Yes, he is.",
        "Matthew: How's he doing?",
        "Nigel: Well, he's genuinely thrilled to be marrying your mother today. Simply put, he's on top of the world.",
        "[Matthew sighs]",
        "Bo: Well? If you're going to rat me out to your Uncle Clint, go ahead. Do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Can you believe Mom and Dad are getting married today?",
        "Jessica: To different people.",
        "Natalie: Different people--I know.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Natalie: Oh, can you get that? I'll be right back.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Bree, honey, you stay inside, okay? I'm just going to see who this is. Hello?",
        "Jessica: Hey, little girl, I told you to stay inside.",
        "Bree: I lost my ball.",
        "Jessica: Did you find it?",
        "Bree: And this, too.",
        "Jessica: Did Grandma give this to you?",
        "Bree: Daddy did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aurelia: Geraldo--",
        "[Markko sighs]",
        "Markko: Didn't you hear what Papi said? I'm not your \"Geraldo\" anymore.",
        "Aurelia: Your father's wrong.",
        "Markko: Mom--are you finally going to get in his face? Are you going to let me come home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I thought my parents were bad, but they would never disown me. I can't believe that Markko's parents did that to him.",
        "Langston: Yeah, well, it was more Markko's dad. I mean, he packed up a whole bunch of Markko's stuff and just dropped it at your Aunt Viki's.",
        "Starr: How could he do that? Markko is the perfect son.",
        "Langston: Well, he had premarital sex.",
        "Starr: So?",
        "Langston: To Markko's parents, sex outside marriage is a sin. And I'm some \"heathen girl\" who ruined their son.",
        "Starr: First off, they're going to have to get over that, because sex happens. It doesn't have to be some huge drama. As long as you're safe.",
        "Langston: Right.",
        "Starr: Right. And you and Markko were responsible, just like Cole and I, so you should get props for that.",
        "Langston: Okay, I'm sorry--aren't you sort of rewriting history here? There's a baby upstairs because you and Cole didn't use protection.",
        "Starr: Well, that was then. I mean, I'm not that stupid now.",
        "Langston: Now? Wait--you and Cole are having sex again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asher: What are you talking about? You don't even have a family to take care of, unless you mean your mom, which would be weird.",
        "Cole: I mean Starr and her daughter.",
        "Asher: Dude, you're losing it. Your kid died.",
        "Cole: No, we--we figured out that she didn't. It's a long story.",
        "Asher: Whoa, that's heavy. What's her name?",
        "Cole: Hope.",
        "Asher: That's a good name. Real optimistic. Where is the little thing?",
        "Cole: She lives with Starr and her parents.",
        "Asher: Oh, man. Jackpot for that kid. Those people own, like, half of Llanview, right?",
        "Cole: Maybe. So what?",
        "Asher: So why do you need to deal drugs if you could just let them foot the bill?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I don't understand. I just got accepted the other day.",
        "John: You and all the other new cadets.",
        "Brody: What happened? Did Bo change his mind?",
        "John: Bo didn't do this, I did.",
        "Brody: Look, if this is about my past, you know, just--",
        "John: I got everything I need to know about you right here.",
        "Brody: You don't think I'll make a good cop?",
        "John: Uh-uh. From what I've seen, you'd be a natural.",
        "Brody: Then why the hell are you booting me out of the academy?",
        "John: Because you're going to be working undercover.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Mom, Matthew is upset. That doesn't mean it's going to ruin your wedding.",
        "Nora: He's blackmailing us.",
        "Rachel: Oh--what?",
        "Nora: He came to Bo and me this morning and he told us that he would drop the lawsuit if we would consent to the surgery.",
        "Rachel: And if you don't?",
        "Nora: He said he would go to Clint and tell him that he saw Bo and I kissing.",
        "Rachel: Mom, Clint would never believe a lie like that.",
        "Nora: Problem is, it's not a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What are you waiting for?",
        "Matthew: Do you really want me to tell Uncle Clint what I saw last night?",
        "Bo: Do what you got to do.",
        "Matthew: You didn't answer my question.",
        "Bo: I didn't think that you really wanted an answer. This is all about you, right? It has nothing to do with me or your mom or Uncle Clint. What's it matter if you shoot your mouth off about something you think you saw and then somebody gets hurt? Take a few minutes and think about that.",
        "Matthew: Why, because that's how much time it took for you and Mom to decide that I'll be stuck in this chair forever?",
        "Clint: Nigel, time is running out. Hey, you two. You looking for me?",
        "Bo: Matthew was. He has something important that he wants to tell you.",
        "Clint: Well, I got a wedding to get to, so let's spit it out, kiddo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: What's this?",
        "Aurelia: Take it, mijo. There's money in there. Some of it is for you, and I want you to give some to Mrs. Davidson to cover expenses.",
        "Markko: So, you're not here to say I can come home.",
        "Aurelia: And I made you some churros. You look very thin. Are you eating?",
        "Markko: Yes, Mom, they're feeding me.",
        "[Markko sighs]",
        "Markko: I mean, it's not as good as your cooking, but what do you want? Um-- anyway, thanks. It smells good.",
        "Aurelia: I have to go.",
        "Markko: Why? I mean, you just got here.",
        "Aurelia: Mind your manners with these people, okay? No loud music. And no cursing.",
        "Markko: I would never.",
        "Aurelia: I know, baby. And please tell Mrs. Davidson that I'm very grateful for her to look after my son. I'll work on your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Don't hold out on me.",
        "Starr: Fine. You promise not to tell anyone?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I won't.",
        "Starr: Not even Markko?",
        "[Imitates zipper closing]",
        "Starr: Cole slept over the other night and we made love.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. Starr, why didn't you tell me? That's huge!",
        "Starr: I know. I know, I know, and it just happened. It was really risky, but we just didn't know the next time that we would see each other.",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Langston: Wait. Why is that? Starr, what aren't you telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look, I mean, Starr and this baby are my responsibility, okay? The minute Starr turns 18, they're moving in with me. And when that happens, I'm going to need money, and a lot of it.",
        "Asher: Well, can't Rivera hook you up with a job at the diner?",
        "Cole: What, waiting and bussing tables? I can't support a family on that.",
        "Asher: Well, I don't know what to tell you, dude.",
        "Cole: Look, come on, man. Look, no one--no one's going to hire me for something better without a G.E.D. and I can't get that because I'm too busy doing stupid community service crap. Getting busted for possession looks awesome on a job application, you know what I mean?",
        "Asher: Yeah, I get it, I just don't care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: We--we need an undercover who's not already in the department.",
        "Brody: You don't want to go after the target with cops?",
        "John: There's at least one cop we need to keep out of this.",
        "Brody: You got a mole?",
        "John: I didn't say that.",
        "Brody: You didn't have to.",
        "John: You know, I'm taking a big risk here. I need to know that I can trust you.",
        "Brody: You can.",
        "John: So you're saying you're on board?",
        "Brody: Whatever you need, I'm here.",
        "John: You don't even know what the job is.",
        "Brody: You trust me, I trust you. I want in. And I won't tell anyone. Except Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What did you say? Who gave this to you?",
        "Bree: Daddy did.",
        "Jessica: Bree--hey, what did mommy tell you about making things up? Okay? Now, I'm only going to ask you one more time. Who gave this to you? Was it Grandma? Was it Grandpa Charlie? Bree Brennan, you tell me the truth! Who gave this to you?",
        "Natalie: Jessica? What is the matter with you? Why are you yelling at Bree?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Noelle: I'm so sorry we missed your party last night.",
        "Viki: Oh, you didn't miss much. It was a very weird evening.",
        "Noelle: Oh.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Noelle: Well, Moe's father has taken a turn for the worst.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",
        "Noelle: Yeah. Jeremiah's real stubborn. He needs surgery and he's refusing to have it since he's too old for such foolishness.",
        "Viki: Oh, dear.",
        "Noelle: And Moe was on the phone with him, and his doctors, all night long, and--well, we're flying to Texas in a couple hours so Moe can see him face-to- face and talk some sense into him.",
        "Viki: Oh. You're not coming to my wedding?",
        "Noelle: I'm so sorry, Viki.",
        "Viki: Oh, I understand, I understand. It's just that you two, of all people, should be there. I'm disappointed.",
        "Noelle: Oh, so are we. I mean, I was the one who kept telling you to give Charlie a chance.",
        "Viki: I know that.",
        "[Noelle laughs]",
        "Viki: And I will be eternally grateful to you for not giving up.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Noelle: And a double wedding--I've never been to one of those.",
        "Viki: Neither have I. And I don't know that it's such a good idea. I mean, Renee--that's Asa's widow--she got all excited about it, and I think the four of us just went along with it to keep her happy, you know?",
        "Noelle: And you're really not bothered by the fact that the other bride is marrying your ex-husband?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Matthew, what are you waiting for, a drum roll? Speak your mind.",
        "Matthew: Well, I guess I just have to say it. This is about you and my mom.",
        "Clint: What about us?",
        "Matthew: Well, I saw something last night, and it made me think about you and my mom's wedding. And it was--it was the way you looked at my mom. I could tell you really love her, and I know she loves you, too. I just hope you take care of her.",
        "Clint: Matthew, you have my word that I will. Let me tell you something. It takes a real man to watch out for his mother like that.",
        "Matthew: Hmm. Well, that's all I had to say.",
        "Clint: And it means an awful lot to me to have your blessing. Now, I have got to go find Nigel because I need those cufflinks.",
        "Bo: I'm proud of you.",
        "Matthew: I didn't do it for you.",
        "Bo: Why'd you do it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You made out with Bo last night?",
        "Nora: Okay, no one said anything about making out. It was a kiss.",
        "Rachel: Okay, fine. Kissing. How did you end up kissing your ex-husband?",
        "Nora: I don't know. I have no idea. It was a bad night at the lodge all the way around. I mean, it started with the banner with Bo's name on it. And then Matthew had to be carried in. And then he and I had that confrontation about the lawsuit, and it was--",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Nora: I was so upset, I went outside to get some air. Bo was there, and we started talking, which we always do. And--then it happened.",
        "Rachel: \"It.\" You mean the kiss?",
        "Nora: Yes, the kiss.",
        "Rachel: Well, did you kiss him back?",
        "Nora: Yes.",
        "Rachel: Okay. Well, how do you feel about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: That's all you have to say, huh? \"I don't care\"?",
        "Asher: Yeah, pretty much. Like I said, with a place like this--",
        "Cole: Dude, forget this place. All right? My mom floated me the money--just for two months' rent, but she needs it back. I have to support Starr and this baby. All right? I need some serious cash.",
        "Asher: Dude, you have, like, the worst luck of anybody I've ever met. You're a bad investment. Cutting you in would be like digging my own grave.",
        "Cole: Why?",
        "Asher: Oh, come on. You and I both know in the end, you're going to wind up landing my ass in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You want to tell Jessica?",
        "Brody: I have to. I can't keep something like this from her.",
        "John: No one else.",
        "Brody: So what now?",
        "John: You tell everyone you were rejected from the academy. Only you, me, and Bo know the truth.",
        "Brody: What's my cover?",
        "John: Keep working at Rodi's. That's where we'll make contact, all right? As far as anyone else knows, you're just a bartender.",
        "Brody: And the details?",
        "John: Soon.",
        "Brody: Thanks--for trusting me with this. It means a lot to me.",
        "John: Nothing you didn't earn.",
        "Brody: So, as far as the academy goes--",
        "John: Consider this orientation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Bree, go on. Sit down, okay? Have you seen this before?",
        "Natalie: Not that I recall.",
        "Jessica: Are you sure?",
        "Natalie: I--I don't know. I mean, Bree's got so many toys. I don't even think she knows what she has.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Well, do you think that Mom gave it to her for Christmas or Easter or something?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I mean, why does it matter who gave it to her?",
        "Jessica: It does if it upsets her.",
        "Natalie: Aren't you the one who's upsetting her?",
        "Jessica: You're right, you're right. Bree, honey, I'm sorry I snapped at you, okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Mommy's just running late.",
        "Jessica: Would you mind taking her to the church?",
        "Natalie: Of course.",
        "Jessica: Okay, I have a couple of things that I have to do before I go.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Bye, sweetie.",
        "Jessica: Hey, Brody. Um--I really need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: No, where are you going?",
        "Matthew: What does it matter?",
        "Bo: I asked you a question.",
        "Matthew: You're just lucky I didn't spill your and Mom's secret.",
        "Bo: So that's it with this blackmail business?",
        "Matthew: Well, it won't get me what I want, so why bother? I'll beat you in court, anyway.",
        "Bo: Don't talk to me like that.",
        "Matthew: Like what? You said it yourself--the truth will only hurt people, especially Uncle Clint. He hasn't done anything but just try to help me. And the way I see it, you and Mom are doing a great job of hurting him. So you don't need any help from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Bo and I started to talk about it this morning, and then Matthew came out of nowhere with this whole blackmail scheme. The little pooper's probably giving Clint all the gory details right now.",
        "Rachel: You haven't stopped him?",
        "Nora: How am I supposed to do that? What am I supposed to do, get him to lie for us? Oh, I know. Or better yet, we're supposed to succumb to his blackmail and then pray he doesn't die on the operating table?",
        "Rachel: Okay, let me ask you something. If it is better to tell the truth, why don't you just tell him yourself? No, let Matthew do it. That way, you look like a liar and a cheater. I'd say that gives Clint plenty of reason to stop the wedding. But hey, if that's what you want--is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, I will always love Clint, but Charlie is my future. And I'm very, very happy for him and Nora.",
        "Noelle: And that's great. It's real civilized.",
        "Viki: Well--",
        "Noelle: I want no part of my ex-husband, and I certainly don't think I could share my wedding with him.",
        "Viki: You know, Clint and I--we share four children, so I think that motivates you to get over your grievances.",
        "Noelle: Mm-hmm, and I'm guessing you're not the kind of bride who needs to be the center of attention.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God--no, I've had more than my share of that kind of attention.",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "Noelle: Well, I know you've been married a couple times.",
        "Viki: A couple? Try eight.",
        "Noelle: Eight?",
        "Viki: Eight.",
        "[Noelle chuckles]",
        "Noelle: That's as many as Elizabeth Taylor.",
        "Viki: No, no, no. Because I married two of them twice.",
        "Noelle: Oh, yeah. So that's what, six different husbands?",
        "Viki: Six.",
        "Noelle: Oh. No wonder you ran off to Paris, Texas, to pour coffee for a living. Will you tell me about them?",
        "Viki: Honey, that would take forever. You have a plane to catch.",
        "Noelle: Yeah, I do. So you're going to have to give me the \"Reader's Digest\" version.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Rachel, I really need you to back off right now, please, okay? I'm not happy with the situation at all.",
        "Rachel: Mom, I don't mean to be in your face today. It's okay. You can talk to me. Do you want Clint to call off this wedding?",
        "Nora: Honey, I love Clint. What happened with Bo--I don't even understand it. Do you--",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nora: And that's Bo, and I have to get this, so-- so what's the verdict?",
        "Bo: Well, Matthew had his chance, but he didn't tell Clint anything. Are you there?",
        "Nora: Yeah, I'm here.",
        "Bo: Well, that's--that's good news, right?",
        "Clint: Hey, Bo?",
        "Bo: I got to go. I'll tell you later.",
        "Clint: Do you remember these?",
        "Bo: Sure I do. Pa wore them to every wedding.",
        "Clint: Yeah. They must have about 100,000 miles on them by now. Hmm. You look a little rattled. Who was on the phone?",
        "Bo: Ah, it was somebody at the station. Had a problem that they could have handled on their own.",
        "Clint: Oh. Well, some people always need guidance, don't they? Matthew, on the other hand--he takes the bull by the horns. Could you do this for me here?",
        "Bo: Sure. I hope he wasn't too pushy.",
        "Clint: No, he's just sticking up for his mom. Wanted to make sure I take good care of her. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?",
        "Bo: No.",
        "Clint: No.",
        "Bo: Nothing.",
        "Clint: And Matthew--thank you--has got nothing to worry about. I love Nora. I adore the woman.",
        "Bo: I know you do.",
        "Clint: Everything about her. Even the things that absolutely drive me nuts. Along with the fact that she still loves you, in the same way that I still love Viki. That says an awful lot about what kind of woman that she is. Well, I want you to know something. I couldn't marry anybody who didn't love my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Well?",
        "[Nora sighs]",
        "Nora: Matthew didn't tell Clint.",
        "Rachel: Okay. So Clint has no reason to call off the wedding.",
        "Nora: No.",
        "Rachel: But do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Come on, there's something I have to show you.",
        "Brody: What?",
        "Jessica: Well, Bree was in here. She was in here the whole time except for a minute or two. She went outside to go and get her ball and that must be when it happened. I don't know when--",
        "Brody: Whoa, Jessica--okay.",
        "Jessica: I--",
        "Brody: Slow down. What's going on?",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry, I'm just--it's--I'm a little freaked out because it's just--",
        "Brody: Okay. Tell me what happened.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: Bree was here the whole time. And then I--I got her to--I had to come get her to go to the church. But she wasn't in here. She went outside to go and get her ball. And when she came back inside, she--she had this.",
        "Brody: It's just a stuffed animal.",
        "Jessica: No. It's an elephant.",
        "Brody: Okay, I'm--I'm not following.",
        "Jessica: No, Nash gave her elephants, okay? It was kind of their thing. And look at it. It's brand-new. I asked Bree where she got it, and she said that her daddy gave it to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Okay, you know that you can't keep anything from me, so you might as well just spill.",
        "Starr: Cole's not going to prison, hopefully.",
        "Langston: Hopefully?",
        "Starr: Right. Well, John got him out of serving time, behind bars, at least.",
        "Langston: Yeah, with that whole community service gig.",
        "Starr: But that's kind of a trade-off.",
        "Langston: What does that mean?",
        "Starr: Nothing.",
        "Langston: Well, it's obviously something.",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Langston: What is it? I won't tell anyone.",
        "Starr: Langston, really, it's not just some little secret. It's actually a really big deal. And if I told you, somebody might get hurt, so please, just don't ask me about it.",
        "Langston: Fine.",
        "Starr: You really shouldn't even tell Markko that we had this conversation.",
        "Langston: Okay, I won't, I swear.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Langston: But promise me that if you need to talk, you'll let me know. I'm really worried about you.",
        "Starr: Okay. I'm sure that it'll all be okay. At least I pray it will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What, you think I'm going to narc on you or something?",
        "Asher: I didn't say that. But everywhere you go, you got that cop hovering around.",
        "Cole: John McBain?",
        "Asher: Yes, John McBain. That guy's a detective again.",
        "Cole: Look, all he wants to do is get with my mom. That's the only reason why he hangs around me. She's all he pays attention to. He couldn't care less what I do.",
        "Asher: Yeah? Prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Wait. What happened? What's wrong?",
        "Markko: My mom dropped by.",
        "Langston: Oh. Well, what'd she say?",
        "Markko: She's not going to fight my old man.",
        "Langston: Oh, Markko, I'm so sorry. You okay? Well, if you wanted to feel better, you came to the right place.",
        "Markko: Yeah?",
        "Langston: Oh, yeah. Starr, I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asher: You going to take it, or what? You said you could get away with anything right under McBain's nose. Don't be so sure of yourself before you can prove it.",
        "Cole: And popping that will do it, huh?",
        "Asher: It's a start.",
        "Cole: Me doing that would only guarantee one thing. Everything you supplied me would just go right down the hatch.",
        "Asher: Right. I see your point.",
        "Cole: You know what? Forget about it. It's just not worth the hassle. I'll find another supplier.",
        "Asher: Like who?",
        "Cole: Look, man, I was in rehab. Half the people in there as soon as they get out go straight to their dealer. I'll get them to hook me up. I just figured since I know you, that we could throw in together and make some real cash.",
        "Asher: No, hold up, hold up. That many people get out of rehab and still use?",
        "Cole: Those who don't...want to. Always. They just need a little push. Most of them have been around the block a few times, so they build up a tolerance. You know, they want more, better. Not like those amateurs at Llanview High. I know exactly how to nab them. 'Cause I live in their skin.",
        "Asher: Let's talk price point.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Anything?",
        "Brody: If anyone was here, they're gone now.",
        "Jessica: You don't believe me, do you?",
        "Brody: I didn't say that. I think someone gave this to Bree, and you don't remember seeing it. And if it helps, I don't remember seeing it before, either.",
        "Jessica: So why would they tell her that her daddy gave this to her, okay? Bree wouldn't make that up.",
        "Brody: You know what I think? Someone did give this to her when you were at Saint Ann's. They were probably trying to make her feel better.",
        "Jessica: Maybe you're right.",
        "Brody: All right, either way, it's weird. I totally get why you're freaked out.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I just--I guess I just have the--the creeps from what I saw at the lodge last night, or what I thought I saw.",
        "Brody: Maybe you'd feel better if you talked to Dr. Levin.",
        "Jessica: You think I'm losing my mind again?",
        "Brody: Whoa, hey, hey. No, no, I don't, okay? Look, you've got a lot going on. Your mom's getting married.",
        "Jessica: Huh.",
        "Brody: You just passed your wedding anniversary.",
        "Jessica: I told you I loved you.",
        "Brody: Yeah, that's huge. All right? Maybe--maybe you're feeling a little, you know, stressed. And it's never bad just to check in with someone.",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. I'm fine, really. I feel better already, now that you're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay. I'm going to give you the short version of a very long story. But I promise I'll fill in all the details another time, okay?",
        "Noelle: Okay.",
        "Viki: Okay. All right. This is Joe Riley.",
        "Noelle: Ooh, handsome.",
        "Viki: Oh, very handsome, very charming, very funny.",
        "Noelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Viki: Married him twice. He was a newspaper man--I honestly think that if Joe had lived, I'd still be married to him.",
        "Noelle: Hmm.",
        "Viki: We had two sons together.",
        "Noelle: Kevin and Joey.",
        "Viki: That's right. He died, though, just before Joey was born. Okay, this is Steve Burke.",
        "Noelle: Hmm.",
        "Viki: He was also a newspaper man. He was my father's choice for me. But I married him because at the time, I thought I'd lost Joe.",
        "Noelle: Lost him how?",
        "Viki: That's part of the long story, okay?",
        "Noelle: Oh. Okay. Keep going.",
        "Viki: Well, you know Clint. Married him twice, too.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Noelle: That's Clint? He looks so different.",
        "Viki: Well, it was a long time ago. And he was very different.",
        "Noelle: I'll say.",
        "Viki: Okay. This is Roger Gordon. He was actually my first husband, but--I'll save that for the long story, too.",
        "[Noelle chuckles]",
        "Viki: And this is Sloan Carpenter.",
        "Noelle: Ooh. He was a soldier?",
        "Viki: No, he was a general. He was a wonderful man. Very elegant. Unfortunately, he was very ill when we got married, and he died right afterwards. And this is my Ben.",
        "Noelle: Hmm. You told me about him. Ben Davidson, the bartender with the dreamy eyes who was secretly a doctor for the mob.",
        "Viki: He died so young. But I've got his heart, so he's always with me.",
        "Noelle: Oh.",
        "Viki: Okay, that's it. That's all my husbands.",
        "Noelle: Uh-uh. Not all.",
        "Viki: Oh--",

        "Nora: Why would I want to cancel the wedding?",
        "Rachel: Kissing your ex-husband, keeping it from your fianc\u00e9? I'd say that's at least a reason to postpone.",
        "Nora: No, Clint's the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.",
        "Rachel: But, Mom, you have to deal with this. What do you think, that it's just not going to follow you into the marriage?",
        "Nora: Oh, Rachel, come on. It was one kiss, one.",
        "Rachel: So you're saying that it's never going to happen again? That you don't want it to? Mom, I think you need to answer those questions.",
        "Nora: Okay, I can't! I can't answer them! Do you understand that? I don't know why it happened. It happened. I can't take it back. But I do know it doesn't mean I don't love Clint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: How do I look?",
        "Bo: You look great. Listen, there's something I have to take care of before the ceremony.",
        "Clint: You have the rings, don't you?",
        "Bo: Got them right here.",
        "Clint: All right. Bo, don't be late. I can't get married without you.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "Nigel: With all due respect, sir, you're not going anywhere. Not until we toast. It was Mr. Buchanan's wish that his sons \"knock one back\" with this 30-year-old Kentucky bourbon.",
        "Bo: Well--",
        "Nigel: Only to be served on the most momentous of occasions, like this one.",
        "Bo: How come we didn't have this little ceremony before I married Lindsay almost, you know, last year?",
        "Clint: Well, you can't blame Nigel. He probably just forgot. That whole thing was a fiasco. Now, to Pa, for remembering our love of good bourbon. And to Bo, the finest brother a man could ask for.",

        "Jessica: Well, I can't wait to hear it. Shoot. We're going to be late. We have to go, like, now.",
        "Brody: All right, you get your stuff. I'll--I'll pull the car around.",

        "Asher: No, I'm your supplier. You talk to me, no one else, you got it?",
        "Cole: I got it. Chill.",
        "Asher: It's for your own good. I'll be around in a few days. If you do well, we'll keep rolling. Don't screw this up. Like you said, show me some real cash.",

        "Clint: It's not like you to forget something that Asa Buchanan asked you to do. So this whole \"momentous occasion\" with the two brothers toasting--did you make all that up?",
        "Nigel: It was Mr. Buchanan's wish that his sons always remain close. And if you'll pardon me for saying, there's been a noticeable strain between the two of you of late. If a fond remembrance of your father coupled with a nip of alcohol might ease the tension, then...guilty as charged.",
