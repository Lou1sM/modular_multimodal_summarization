        "Clint: So, how has old London town been treating you?",

        "Cain: Oh, Mendorra, sweet, innocent child of mine! Civilized child, save us!",
        "[Crowd boos]",
        "Carlo: In these dark times of tyranny, all we have to hold on to is the law. It is the life raft in the face of a sinking ship.",

        "Renee: You know, your son's a real nice boy.",
        "Bo: Ah, he's no son of mine.",
        "Renee: Oh, that's funny because when you come up from Reno, all you can do is gush over your boys and what hell raisers they are. That is until one of them starts to give it back to you and then all of a sudden, you're a fit to disown them.",
        "Bo: See, you don't understand.",
        "Renee: Oh, oh, oh -- I don't? Poor you, is that it? You're unappreciated? Or could it be that you are just plum awful with words? I mean, seeing how you talk to your son, my girls, and even me --",
        "Bo: Did I do something to offend you?",
        "Renee: I'm over you. But Emma Bradley? She's got some notion that you are going to leave your batty wife and spirit her and her child off to fantasy land. Now, are you going to make good on that word or are you going to cut her loose like you cut me?",

        "Starr: Okay, all I'm saying is the next time you take the walk of shame, you should've come in from the back.",

        "Starr: Really?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I used to sing to you and Jack all the time.",
        "Starr: What'd you used to sing?",

        "Nora: Well, she believes that she's doing the right thing.",
        "Cole: How is giving our baby away the right thing?",
        "Nora: If you don't think this is the right thing, then you shouldn't sign these papers and you'll retain parental custody.",
        "Cole: But it won't stop there, will it?",
        "Nora: Not if Starr wants to challenge you.",
        "Cole: Okay, and if she does, what are my chances?",
        "Nora: Well, you'll win, but it won't be pretty. I mean, your lawyer's going to have to dredge up a lot of stuff on Starr and -- and use it against her.",
        "Cole: Wait, \"dredge up\"?",
        "Nora: Dirt, dirt. Filthy dirt, lots of it.",
        "Cole: Dirt about Starr? No, I'm not going to do that.",
        "Nora: Okay, to win these cases, it's not pretty. I mean, you saw what Todd did to the McBains when he was trying to win over Sam.",
        "Cole: Me and Starr aren't like that.",
        "Nora: Cole, sweety, this is family court and it's brutal, and it's personal, and once you start this, you don't stop at anything but winning.",
        "Cole: Hey, I don't want to win, Nora. I just want what's best for the baby.",
        "Nora: I know that's what you want. And I also know that's what Starr wants. But do you really think that's what Todd wants?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I don't want to be careless, you know, with my life here in Llanview.",
        "Charlie: Why would leaving be careless?",
        "Viki: Because I feel like I would be leaving everything to chance.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but what if the bigger risk is not taking the chance to sort out your life? Striking out for new experiences kind of worked out for you when you went to Paris, Texas, didn't it?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Viki: So you're telling me to -- to leave, huh?",
        "Charlie: Viki, the last thing that I want in this world is for you to go. But what I want isn't necessarily what you need right now.",
        "Viki: What do I need, Charlie?",
        "Charlie: Maybe you just need somebody to tell you that what you're worried about leaving here is going to be right here when you get back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: David, you did everything right. The music, the speech, getting down on one knee. It was all so empty.",
        "David: What? No, it's not. It's not empty. It's full. It's very full.",
        "Addie: But not of love.",
        "David: What -- come here a second. What happened to us? You were totally into me. Snagging me was on your list.",
        "Addie: So was dumping you. I just never got the chance till now.",

        "Addie: See?",

        "David: You were going to leave me just before taking a nudist cruise around the world?",
        "Addie: Well, I couldn't very well meet men on the cruise with my husband in tow, could I?",
        "David: Yeah, but when Dorian made me sign those papers last night, you were so upset. And I want to go on the cruise.",
        "Addie: Being upset is part of the divorce experience. David, you're loads of fun, and that body --",
        "David: Would look great on the cruise.",
        "Addie: Oh, it sure would. You'll make a wonderful husband for someone one day. But you don't love me. And I don't love you. And the last thing on my list is love.",
        "David: Okay, fine. But until you find love --",
        "Addie: It's over for us, David.",
        "Dorian: Thank you! Ah! You heard her, David. It's over. Okay, when are you going to finally get out of here?",

        "Starr: It's like a little flutter.",
        "Blair: How's it make you feel?",
        "Starr: It makes me feel wiped from all the fighting.",
        "Blair: What -- what do you mean, \"fighting\"? What happened before? Was Cole here or something?",
        "Starr: No, I haven't talked to him in a while. Marcie's lawyer sent him over the papers, and he hasn't gotten back to me.",
        "Blair: Well, it's a very big decision, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: I know, but I really know that it's what's best for my baby, you know?",
        "Blair: Well, maybe Cole will come around. But in the meantime, you know, if you push him --",
        "Starr: I don't want to push him, and I'm not pushing him. I just -- I want our child to have the life that it deserves, you know? But, I mean, what if he doesn't sign those papers, and the adoption doesn't go through? Then what happens? Is the baby just his?",

        "Dallas: I knew it. You and Viki got back together.",
        "Clint: Uh, no, no. Viki and I are just friends, and parents.",

        "Renee: Oh, I don't want to hear it. Jeremiah: Hey, you two are killing my high.",

        "Clint: I didn't know airplanes serve food anymore. Come on out to the kitchen, I'll make you something to eat and you can tell me all about it.",
        "Dallas: That's a done deal.",
        "Clint: All right.",

        "Dallas: [As Renee] Hmm. What a pickle.",
        "Moe: [As Jeremiah] I could eat 50 more brownies right about now.",
        "Renee: You know, I should just ban that man from my place. All he does is make chaos.",

        "Rex: [As Bo] So you going to slap me, Pa?",
        "Bo: Oh, knock it off, Balsom. I'll tell you what, I was a good kid.",
        "Rex: [As himself] Sounds like Asa didn't make life easy.",
        "Bo: Clint and I handled it the best we could. But the way he treated women, you know, Renee, my mother, that was tough.",
        "Rex: Was your mom always a little -- off?",
        "Bo: She had her good days. Mostly bad. It didn't help that Pa kept her locked up. Clint and I tried to do something. You know what? People think that being a Buchanan is a free ride. Nothing could be further from the truth.",

        "Dorian: Are you still here?",
        "David: Actually, the joke's on you. I had to sell Addie's golf clubs to pay for the minister and the virtuoso. Hope you're happy.",
        "Dorian: I am thrilled because Addie has kicked you like the bad habit that you are. However, you know, as a lovely little farewell gift, I'm going to allow you to keep all the designer clothes which you purchased at my expense.",
        "David: How can you be so heartless?",
        "Dorian: You are the one who left me at the altar.",
        "David: That again?",
        "Dorian: And you mocked me in front of Viki.",

        "Starr: Oh, there's going to be a lot more yelling to come, especially when Cole and Dad take me to court.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, you know, I think that it's inevitable, I mean, unless one of you gives in.",
        "Starr: Yeah, Cole. I mean, what do you think? Do you think I should keep the baby?",

        "Cole: It'll be theirs.",
        "Nora: Okay. So, yes, they will love it. And what do you think is going to happen with you?",
        "Cole: Just go back to the way it was before, being alone.",
        "Nora: Alone? Is that -- is that how you really feel? You don't feel like you're a part of this family?",
        "Cole: I feel like a rude guest that causes trouble 24/7 even though you've been nothing but nice to me.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, I certainly don't see you that way.",
        "Cole: You -- you and Clint were in the middle of having lunch when I barge in here and --",
        "Nora: Okay, you know what? You need to stop this now. Cole, you are so busy having a pity party, you don't even see the reality right in front of your face. I love having you in my life. I want you in my life, which means I want you to come to me when you're hurting. I see you trying to hang on to this baby and create a family for yourself and losing Starr in the process and it's killing me, killing me because there's Matthew and there's me and Clint and Nigel and Renee and we're all here offering you a family, a readymade family with our arms wide open and our hearts so full of love. But I can't promise you that we'll be there forever because you and I both know we can't back that up but I can certainly say, without any reservation, that you are so wanted and you are so loved and isn't that what a family is all about? Do you really need a baby to make you feel that way?",
