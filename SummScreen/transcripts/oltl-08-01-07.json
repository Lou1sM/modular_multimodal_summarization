        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Todd: What is with this wheelchair crap? Are you trying to get sympathy from everybody or something?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- yeah. I guess nobody told you.",
        "Todd: No, sir, I guess not.",
        "Blair: Well, I was going to once you were better. Jessica had surgery.",
        "Todd: Oh. A little -- little nip little tuck?",
        "Jessica: Huh -- no. No, it's a little -- a little liver transplant.",
        "Todd: No kidding -- a liver transplant? Well, what the hell -- isn't your husband taking care of you?",
        "Jessica: No, Nash is wonderful. He's, I mean --",
        "Todd: \"Nash\"? What the hell -- I thought she was married to Antonio.",
        "Blair: I told you, a lot happened since you were gone.",
        "Todd: Oh. All right, well, cough it up. Don't leave out anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: You want to talk about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Thank you. Hi.",
        "Marty: Nora. Hi. Have -- have you seen Cole? Has he heard? Does he know that I have been --",
        "Nora: Ok.",
        "Marty: Charged with Spencer's murder?",
        "Nora: All right. Cole is fine, and as far as I know, he hasn't heard a word. I left message for him to call me, and so I'm sure he will. How are you holding up?",
        "Marty: I'm ok. I'm ok.",
        "Nora: This can't be easy for you.",
        "Marty: You know, I -- I just don't think it's hit me yet. You know, but, yeah, it would really help me if -- if I could see Cole, you know, so that I can talk about what we are going to do about it.",
        "Nora: Ok, well, he can stay with us for as long as he needs to.",
        "Marty: Thank you. Nora, it means a lot to me. You're a really good friend.",
        "Nora: You have lot of friends, including John McBain.",
        "Marty: He put his career on the line for me.",
        "Nora: Well, he believes in you.",
        "Marty: I don't see how he could now. But at least, he will have the satisfaction of knowing at this case is finally closed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: John, I just heard my mom was arrested.",
        "John: Look, I'm sorry, Cole. I was going to call you.",
        "Cole: Well, what happened?",
        "John: Apparently, she remembered more about the night Truman died.",
        "Cole: What do you mean -- she remembered killing him?",
        "John: All right -- slow down, all right? She'll explain it to you. But apparently, there are some new details that suggest that she's guilty.",
        "Cole: I don't care what it suggests -- she's innocent and you know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: What are you doing?",
        "Natalie: Giving you a chance to tell your side of the story.",
        "Miles: That's what I was doing.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Miles, as a confession, and the second you do that, there won't even be a trial. You'll go straight to jail and you won't have the opportunity to explain yourself then.",
        "Miles: Why do you care? Hey, wait a minute. You're not doing this to help me. You're doing this to screw over John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Wow -- two liver transplants and two husbands in less than six months. And I thought you were the one in the family with her head screwed on straight.",
        "Blair: Todd.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no. It's fine, it's fine. I screwed up.",
        "Blair: Well, it's not like it was your fault.",
        "Jessica: Oh --",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Jessica: Some things were my fault. I really hurt Antonio and Jamie.",
        "Todd: What'd y do?",
        "Jessica: It's more like what I didn't do. I just couldn't be the wife that Antonio deserved.",
        "Todd: Because of Nash?",
        "Jessica: No, I was in love with him, and I realized that when you love someone the way that we love each other, it -- you can't fight it, you know? It doesn't work. Nothing can keep you from the person you're supposed to be with.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Todd: Huh.",
        "Sarah: Mind if I come in?",
        "Jessica: Sarah.",
        "Todd: My not-so-favorite niece.",
        "Jessica: My mom told me that you were back in Llanview. It's been so long.",
        "Sarah: I'm so glad your surgery went ok. And I'm glad to see you're all right, too, Todd.",
        "Blair: No thanks to your sleazeball boyfriend.",
        "Todd: Hey, there's something I want to say to you.",
        "Sarah: There is something I want to say, too.",
        "Todd: All right \u0096 Sarah I'll go first.",
        "Sarah: Oh.",
        "Todd: Huh -- thanks.",
        "Sarah: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I don't know what your kiss meant, but mine meant that I missed you.",
        "Rex: I missed you, Adriana. My God -- it killed me to see you with Tate.",
        "Adriana: Nothing ever happened between us.",
        "Rex: I -- I know you said you were just friends, but I still couldn't stand it.",
        "Adriana: Please, I can't stand it now. Even the thought of being around him just creeps me out like you wouldn't believe.",
        "Rex: Sorry to bring it up.",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry, Rex. I should've listened to you about Tate. I didn't just hurt you -- I put a lot of people in danger and --",
        "Rex: No, stop it right there, ok? Nothing, none of this, is your fault. Tate was slick. Even after we had him figured out, we still couldn't pin any of the O.P.P. stuff on him.",
        "Adriana: Ok, maybe all the things that Tate did weren't -- were not my fault, but hurting you? That was all me. You did nothing but love me, unconditionally, and I turned on you -- again. I wouldn't be surprised if you hated me.",
        "Rex: I could never hate you. Don't you know that by now?",
        "Adriana: But can you forgive me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, look, Cole, I don't believe your mom's guilty. But there was enough new information to justify an arrest. Bo's hands are tied.",
        "Starr: But it still doesn't mean that your mom is guilty.",
        "Cole: I know, I know, but she was charged with murder. So, what happens now?",
        "John: We have to follow procedure. If the court decides it has a case, we go to trial.",
        "Cole: Well, can't you stop it? Isn't there something you can do?",
        "John: Not unless we find new information that rules your mother out.",
        "Cole: Any chance of that happening?",
        "John: I'm working on it, Cole. That's all I can tell you right now. Ok? You know, I'd think she'd like to see you.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I want to see her, too.",
        "John: Then let's do that. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I am not helping you because of John. Please, give me more credit than that.",
        "Miles: Then why are you?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I guess I just want to. See, I know John and he sees everything in black and white -- well, black, mostly, if you lookin his closet. But with you, I just feel like -- I don't know, you're in the gray area.",
        "Miles: How would you know?",
        "Natalie: Hmm, hmm -- because I -- I lived there. I was -- I was you. I was new to town and everyone hated me.",
        "Miles: Like they hate me?",
        "Natalie: Pretty much.",
        "Miles: I can't believe that anyone would hate you. Not only are you a good person, but you're a Buchanan. That's like Llanview royalty.",
        "Natalie: You didn't know me back then. You would've hated me, too.",
        "Miles: Oh, I doubt it. No one hates you now -- how'd you swing that?",
        "Natalie: I changed. I decided instead of fighting with everyone, I was going to prove to them all I was not the bitch that they all thought I was. Long story short, I redeemed myself.",
        "Miles: What if I can't be redeemed? You're an animal -- a monster. What if I am the monster that people think I am?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Need a lawyer?",
        "Marty: Uh -- no, not yet.",
        "Nora: All right, I'll t you some names.",
        "Marty: I need your honesty about how much time could I actually serve?",
        "Nora: All right. You want it straight up or watered down?",
        "Marty: Straight up.",
        "Nora: Best-case scenario, the prosecution would go for voluntary manslaughter which is -- using deadly force, uh, out of the moment, a heat of passion, then brought on by provocation. Uh -- if you're convicted, it would probably mean up to 10 years in prison.",
        "Marty: 10 years? Oh. I know Cole isn't a child anymore, but he -- but he's -- I mean, he's not a man, either. I -- well, I -- I wouldn't be there for -- for his graduation, and then there is his 18th birthday and -- you know, I have to help him get ready for college. You know, Spencer -- he is getting the last laugh, even from the grave. He is taking my son away from me just like he took Todd's away!",
        "Nora: Oh, you know what? You're not convicted and you have a really, really good case. You saved Blair's life and probably your own life in self-defense, so you could walk free and clear.",
        "Marty: And what are the chances of that, really?",
        "Nora: I'm sorry, Marty. I can't even guess the odds at this point.",
        "Marty: That was the best-case scenario, so what's the worst?",
        "Nora: That prosecution goes for murder one, arguing motive.",
        "Marty: What motive?",
        "Nora: Spencer humiliated you, caused you professional embarrassment when he manipulated your testimony.",
        "Marty: But I -- I wouldn't kill m for that. He was about to rape Blair! I couldn't let him do that.",
        "Nora: Then why didn't you call for help?",
        "Marty: I mean, because there wasn't time. I had to stop him right now. I wasn't going to let Blair go through what I -- what you went through?",
        "Marty: I walked right into that, didn't I?",
        "Nora: Yeah, but if you walk through it again while you're on the stand, that could be points in your favor. Listen. You asked me not to sugarcoat anything -- that's just a taste of what the prosecution's going to do to you when you get on the stand.",
        "Marty: Maybe they won't be as good as you.",
        "Nora: Yeah, they will because I hired them. Don't give up, ok? We just don't know enough yet.",
        "Marty: You know, I know you probably have a lot of things to do and, um, you know, I know you need to go.",
        "Nora: I have to go to Miles' arraignment.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "Marty: Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Talia: Ok. What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were still on leave.",
        "Antonio: I came in to use the gym.",
        "Talia: Oh.",
        "Antonio: I thought I'd try and get myself back into shape so I could get back to work. And don't tell me not to push myself too hard.",
        "Talia: I wasn't going to. We need you back here.",
        "Antonio: Yeah? You sure about that? You handled the situation on The Palace roof all by yourself from what I hear.",
        "Talia: Well, it's about time I got the bastard, especially after blowing it the first couple of times.",
        "Antonio: Well, I want to thank you personally for saving my sister.",
        "Talia: Well, I'll -- I'll just be happy when Tate's behind bars like the animal that he is.",
        "Antonio: Well, and he will be because of you. So, how does it feel to be a hero?",
        "Talia: Oh.",
        "[Talia chuckles]",
        "Talia: I'm not a hero. I have a job to do, and I did it. I didn't jump the gun and I didn't freeze up, and I didn't let that son of a bitch get the drop on me this time.",
        "Antonio: Well, you got your edge",
        "Talia: Just in time, don't you think?",
        "Antonio: I know you've been through a lot -- 9/11 and this O.P.P. crap. But you came through on the other side and you got the job done.",
        "Talia: Well, I couldn't have done it without your help.",
        "Antonio: What?",
        "Talia: You were up there on that roof with me. I looked at the whole situation with a \"what would Antonio do\" standpoint. And when I didn't know what to do, I just, you know, put it through the Vega test.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. Well, I -- I'm glad I could provide backup.",
        "[Talia chuckles]",
        "Talia: You came through for me, too, you know -- not just as a boss, but as my friend. And I'd like to return the favor if, you know, you decide you want to talk after all.",
        "Antonio: Jessica and Nash -- they got married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Ok, you go first.",
        "Sarah: I'm sorry I didn't call the cops when you were apartment in Chicago. I was afraid of Hunter, but that's no excuse for being a coward.",
        "Todd: I don't remember much anyway.",
        "Sarah: Yeah. You were in pretty bad shape.",
        "Todd: Blair said you risked your neck to call her.",
        "Sarah: A little delayed, but kind of?",
        "Todd: So I almost bled to death. I don't always do the right thing on the first try, either.",
        "Sarah: Well, you didn't really give me much choice. You said \"Blair,\" like, 10,000 times in your sleep. It was kind of annoying.",
        "Jessica: Ok, I'm sorry. Now I'm feeling a bit out of the loop here. So what were you doing in Sarah's apartment, and who's Hunter?",
        "Sarah: He was some sleazeball I was hooked up with while I was in Chicago. Someone paid him to put Todd out of commission.",
        "Todd: Has this sleazeball been busted yet?",
        "Blair: No. He's probably long gone, but Clint and Viki don't want Sarah to leave town until Hunter is no threat to her.",
        "Sarah: Which means I am stuck here.",
        "Jessica: Well, maybe you'll find some reason to stay.",
        "Sarah: Not a chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Forgiveness isn't an issue. I can forgive you for not trusting me -- it's not like I haven't given you reason sometimes.",
        "Adriana: But you were right about Tate.",
        "Rex: I would've been jealous of any guy spending time with you.",
        "Adriana: So you didn't trust me, either?",
        "Rex: No, not you -- guys, especially when they're hanging around a -- a woman as smart and beautiful and sexy as you are.",
        "Adriana: I like that you said \"smart\" first.",
        "Rex: It's good that we're talking about this.",
        "Adriana: We need to get things out in the open -- that's been our problem.",
        "Rex: Since long before Tate showed up.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Trust has always been our issue. And as long as it still is, we can't be together.",
        "Adriana: You don't want to get back together?",
        "Rex: Do you?",
        "Adriana: All the time we were apart, Rex, I never stopped thinking about you. Every time I'd see you, I just wanted to run up to you and kiss you.",
        "Rex: Why didn't you?",
        "Adriana: Because I couldn't let myself trust you, because I'm a stubborn idiot. I get that from my mom.",
        "Rex: Which part?",
        "Adriana: Hmm -- all of it. When I found out my parents weren't my parents, that -- I had this whole secret identity. Everything I knew changed. Everyone in my life was in on it. Everything was a lie and I guess it kind of damaged me.",
        "Rex: That could give anybody trust issues.",
        "Adriana: But that's all in the past. I know you love me, and I should've trusted you.",
        "Rex: Can you trust me now?",
        "Adriana: I want to be with you more than anything, Rex. Please give me another chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: I know you think I should've gotten Todd to a doctor or called the cops or something.",
        "Blair: You think?",
        "Sarah: But I only thought that would make things worse. Calling you was the one thing I could think of.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Todd: She didn't have to do that, you know?",
        "Blair: And since when did you become so forgiving, Todd, hmm?",
        "Todd: I think it's the drugs.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: Lay off her. She's just a kid -- don't worry about it. It all worked out.",
        "Blair: All right. I'll try to get past wt you did, since Todd's here safe and sound.",
        "Sarah: Thank you.",
        "Todd: Hey, did Hunter ever tell you who hired him to stab me?",
        "Sarah: I asked, but he just said it was some rich guy.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Miles Laurence.",
        "Jessica: I still can't believe it. I mean, you're both my uncles.",
        "Sarah: Oh -- whoa, whoa, wait a second here. That Miles dude is your uncle?",
        "Jessica: Ah -- it's a long story.",
        "Sarah: I got plenty of time.",
        "Jessica: Trust me -- not that much.",
        "Blair: Listen, we don't have to worry about Miles Laurence because he's in jail and he can't hurt any of us, ok? But he is being arraigned today.",
        "Todd: Ok. Ah.",
        "Blair: No, no, wait, wait -- what do you think you're doing?",
        "Todd: I'm going to go to that arraignment, make sure that son of a bitch doesn't get away with what he did to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Are you doing all right? Are you eating?",
        "Cole: Yeah, mom.",
        "Marty: Ok. Um -- you know, my A.T.M. card, it's -- it's in the desk --",
        "Cole: Mom, I'm fine.",
        "Marty: In the kitchen if you --",
        "Cole: I'm fine.",
        "Marty: Need anything.",
        "Cole: Ok? You don't have to worry about me. All right? And soon, you're going to be out here take care yourself anyway.",
        "Marty: Whew. Well, I wish I could say that, but I've done something wrong and I'm going have to pay for it.",
        "Cole: I still don't get it. I mean, I -- there's no way you killed Dr. Truman.",
        "Marty: No, and -- and I wouldn't have under normal circumstances, but I couldn't let him take advantage of Blair. I had to stop him from doing that. Look, I am not sorry that I stopped Spencer. But I'm sorry for you.",
        "Cole: Don't be.",
        "Marty: I am. I won't be able to take care of you and I -- I won't be able to be your mother.",
        "Cole: Mom, you'll always be my mom, always -- the best one, too.",
        "Marty: No. What kind of mother would do what I did? I killed somebody and then -- and then I allowed somebody I despised -- I allowed them to blackmail me into marrying them so I don't go to the police?",
        "Cole: Well, I knew you were doing it for me.",
        "Marty: And then I let him -- I let him take advantage of you.",
        "Cole: He's going to pay for that, ok? He's going to pay for what he's done to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You're not a monster, Miles.",
        "Miles: Everyone thinks so.",
        "Natalie: I don't.",
        "Miles: Why? You haven't even asked me if I'm guilty.",
        "Natalie: You want to tell me?",
        "Miles: I didn't stab Todd. And I didn't -- I didn't ask anyone else to do it, either. But what I did do, I did for love and -- that sounds lame, I know, I know.",
        "Natalie: Not to me.",
        "Miles: It's just Marty -- she hates me for it, and I can't really blame her.",
        "Natalie: Look, you're not as awful as she's making you out to be.",
        "Miles: I forced her to marry me.",
        "Natalie: Well, your first mistake was wanting to marry her at all. Ok, I'm sorry. I know -- I know you love her, but I'm not a big fan.",
        "Miles: Look, I was wrong. I was wrong. No matter how much you love somebody, you can't make them love you. I know that now.",
        "Natalie: Good. Now that you know it, run with it.",
        "Miles: How? After everything I've done?",
        "Natalie: You have a good heart, Miles. I can see it in your eyes. You're not evil. You just made a mistake and you -- you deserve a second chance, just the same as I did.",
        "Miles: I can't believe that you did something as terrible as what I've been accused of.",
        "Natalie: Really? Ok. I came into Llanview, set out to destroy Jessica Buchanan, the entire Buchanan family. I lied, I stole, I hurt many innocent people because that's all I knew. You know, I -- I didn't know how normal people acted. And I guess in some ways, I'm -- I was just as ignorant to the world as -- as you.",
        "Miles: Well, I tried to learn everything I could about the outside world when I was growing up in the hospital? I mean, I tried. I read everything that I could get my hands on. I watched movies, TV, I went on the internet. But, you know, things are different in real life.",
