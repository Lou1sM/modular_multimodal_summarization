        "David: Just what we need -- the brothers McBain.",
        "Bartender: What'll it be?",

        "David: What are you talking about? Oh, him.",
        "Bartender: That's a him?",
        "David: I got divorced today, lost a lot of money, and I'm now traveling with a dog that emasculates me. Think I can have a drink?",

        "John: Sure I can't buy you a beer?",
        "Michael: Yeah. I'm on call today.",
        "John: What's that, a 72-hour shift?",
        "Michael: I grabbed a couple hours this morning, went back to your place, took a shower.",
        "John: Oh, yeah?",
        "Michael: Yeah. I, uh, saw you and Blair coming out of your room. Listen, if -- if I'm cramping your style at all, just say the word and I'll be out of there.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I -- I don't understand. You signed your rights to the baby and --",
        "Cole: I'm just doing what you asked.",
        "Starr: Which I think is the best thing for the baby and for us.",
        "Cole: There is no \"us.\" All right, you can give the baby to Marcie, but we're over for good.",

        "Rex [as Bo]: Buy you some ice cream?",
        "Shane [As Spencer]: I can be bribed, but it'll take a lot more than that.",
        "Emma: Renee, I came to speak to Asa privately.",
        "Dallas: [As Renee] And I came all the way from Nevada to make sure that nothing gets lost in the translation.",
        "Emma: I appreciate that. I really do. But I'm a big girl. Don't need a babysitter.",
        "Renee: Well, Asa, this is where you tell Emma the truth. Now, come on. You just spit it out. And don't you be a mean S.O.B. about it, either.",
        "Emma: Ahem, the truth?",
        "Bo [as Asa]: We have to end our -- thing.",

        "Spencer: You can't know something like that.",
        "Rex: Eat your ice cream.",

        "Bartender: And that's not even yours. So you got a place to live?",

        "David: What? Who might be a sucker?",
        "Bartender: I was going to say Carlotta Vega. She had a diner in Angel Square.",
        "David: Yeah, I know. I ate there last night. The asopao is still repeating on me.",
        "Bartender: Your luck must travel with you. You might have been their last customer.",

        "Todd: I don't want to bother you with my problems.",
        "Marty: Are you kidding me, after everything you've done for me?",
        "Todd: No, it's just the ink's barely dry on the divorce papers, and she's -- of course, I knew they were together, but I didn't know they were together together, you know? Not yet anyway. And then to rub it in my face like this.",
        "Marty: Yeah, well, she must have cared very deeply for you. To act out like this and try to hurt you?",
        "Todd: Is that shrink-speak?",
        "Marty: Well, you inflict pain when you're in pain. What other reason is there?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I ask myself that question every day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I don't want to lose you.",
        "Cole: This isn't what I want, either. But if you don't want to raise our baby together, if you just want to sign him or her away, then I'm not going to fight you anymore. I'm not going to put our baby in the middle of a war.",
        "Starr: I don't want a war.",
        "Cole: No, you just don't want a family with me.",
        "Starr: I do.",
        "Cole: Okay, just not with the one we already have, or with the baby we already made.",
        "Starr: Because I'm 16, and I'm just not ready to --",
        "Cole: Not ready to what? To what? Throw your life away? To raise our baby? See, I don't see it that way.",
        "Starr: Okay, Cole, I'm the mother, I'm the one who has to give birth, who has to --",
        "Cole: The one who has all the power over what decisions get made? You were going to have an abortion without even telling me you were pregnant. I should have known then.",
        "Starr: You should have known what?",
        "Cole: I should have known that you don't want this baby. Every time I look at you, I'll see what isn't there. Or better yet, who isn't there. All right, and when we see our baby, which we obviously can't avoid, we'll see him or her with a different mom. Maybe a different dad, but never, ever with us.",
        "Starr: Okay, but at least we can see our baby grow up, you know?",
        "Cole: From a distance? Sure -- yeah, sure, that should be really easy.",
        "Starr: Okay, but I'm okay with that, because I know that I was the best thing for our baby. And I know that deep down inside you know that, too. Cole, I keep telling myself that -- that we made this baby out of love. Are you saying that that's not true?",
        "Cole: I did love you. I still do.",
        "Starr: Cole. There is nobody in this world who knows what I'm going through except for you, okay? I need you. I can't do this on my own, but I know that we can do this together.",
        "Cole: What makes you think so?",
        "Starr: Because you're the love of my life, and I will never, ever let you go.",
        "Cole: You already did.",

        "Carlo: I have never been a prouder father.",
        "Talia: Great. So what power comes with this title again? When do I get to deport you and see my Antonio again?",
        "Carlo: I told you you would be queen. Go and greet your adoring public. Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I promise you, Antonio, I won't let you lose Talia.",
        "Antonio: Cris, you don't have to do this. Sarah could still be alive. You could try and go find her.",
        "Cristian: I don't see how. She was tied to that boat, Antonio. I must have dove down a hundred times.",
        "Antonio: Lamento.",
        "Cristian: This time we need a plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What'd you say to John?",
        "Todd: You mean, to make him hit me? Because, of course, it was my fault.",
        "Marty: I didn't say it was your fault.",
        "Todd: I told him he better not use Blair the way he used you.",
        "Marty: And then he hit you?",
        "Todd: Yeah, well.",
        "Marty: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, gosh, you hurt your hand, too?",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's okay.",
        "Marty: No, no, no. Here. I got to clean that up.",
        "Todd: Oh, I'm fine.",
        "Marty: Would you please let me help you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Let me know if it makes you uncomfortable crashing at my place, all right? I know how you feel about the Mannings.",
        "Michael: Uh-uh. No, no, no. Blair's not a problem. She's -- she's great. She's taken terrific care of Sam, and I'm really -- I'm grateful to her. And, uh, happy for you.",
        "John: There's nothing to be happy about.",
        "Michael: Well, at least one of us has a love life again.",
        "John: I talked to Marcie.",
        "Michael: You did?",
        "John: She came by to see you. I'm sorry I didn't say anything sooner.",
        "Michael: Well, you've barely seen me. So how'd it go?",
        "John: She misses you.",
        "Michael: But? She still wants to adopt Starr's baby.",
        "John: I don't know, Mike. Thing is, it may be out of her hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I did not give up on you, okay? And I know that you see this baby as the only family you have left, but what about me? You said that you wanted us to be a family someday.",
        "Cole: I love you, and I probably always will, but I can't be with you.",
        "Starr: Well, why not?",
        "Cole: Because we made a baby together, which is probably the biggest thing two people can do together. But we couldn't agree on the most basic thing -- whether or not to keep it.",
        "Starr: But I thought that we both agreed that our baby would come first. We just didn't agree on how.",
        "Cole: Okay, so let me -- let me get this straight. You want to give away our kid and wait a while, get married, have more kids, so that our firstborn child can grow up knowing that his parents had a family together. They just didn't want him or her. I can't do that. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, please. Don't give up on us, okay? Don't be the one to do that, please. Don't go.",
        "Carlo: In accordance with the laws of this great sovereignty, the fraudulent prince and princess, also known as Cain Rogan and Tina Lord-Roberts, are to be executed.",
        "[Crowd reacts]",
        "Carlo: As much as the newlyweds would like to remain with us to witness justice in action, they have other business to attend to.",
        "[Laughter and applause]",
        "Antonio: I'll kill the bastard.",
        "Carlo: To rightfully ascend to the throne, they must first consummate their union.",
        "Cristian: I've got an idea.",
        "[Crowd cheers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Slurping]",
        "Shane [As Spencer]: Hey, what's that?",
        "Rex: R.B. phone home.",
        "Spencer: Something wrong with you?",
        "Rex: You'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi [as Emma]: Well, that was blunt. Thanks.",
        "Bo [as Asa]: Uh -- no, please, here, um --",
        "Emma: So I guess he told you before he told me. That's why you hightailed it halfway across the country -- to run interference?",
        "Dallas [As Renee]: Well, Asa, I think that you owe her an explanation. Don't you think?",
        "Emma: I don't know if I want one.",
        "Renee: Oh -- trust me.",
        "Asa: Emma, you are a real amazing girl, and I'm so lucky, I feel, to know you. But I also know that you want to start a whole new life for you and with your son, and maybe it'd be a good idea for you if you did that somewhere else. Because, you know, I'm not the most available ol' cowboy in these parts.",
        "Emma: I know. I just thought any life would be a better life than the one I've got. No offense.",
        "Renee: Oh, honey. You don't want the man at your side to be going flying out of the nest. You know, you are strong. You're smart. And you're still so young.",
        "Asa: You are a beautiful young woman, and you have your whole life ahead of you. And I know you're going to find love again. Now, don't you think, uh, maybe it'd be a good idea if you found someone who was more your age?",
        "Emma: Like who? Your son? You want to match me up with Bo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Spencer: Your hair is weird. Your phone is weird. You're weird.",
        "Rex: Look who's talking, you little sociopath-to-be. Leave me alone. Freak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I keep wondering --",
        "Todd: Hmm?",
        "Marty: Well, I -- what if John had known that I survived the accident?",
        "Todd: Oh, do you mean, would he still be with Blair? Well, he did leave you to die. Maybe she was the reason.",
        "Marty: Yeah, maybe. And I know you were -- you were aware that your wife was leaving and --",
        "Todd: My ex-wife.",
        "Marty: Well, but you didn't really, really believe it until today.",
        "Todd: Oh, God. She's betrayed me so many times in so many different ways. This is actually not the first time she slept with somebody I hate.",
        "Marty: Well, what did I see in him?",
        "Todd: What every other chick saw. He plays this -- this wounded, tortured-soul routine and makes every woman he meets feel like, oh, \"I'm going to be the one who finally makes him happy.\"",
        "Marty: Ugh.",
        "Todd: I know. Even smart girls like you fall for it.",
        "Marty: Ah -- I guess I must have related to him somehow. Maybe it was just because I wasn't happy.",
        "Todd: I don't know about that.",
        "Marty: Well, what about you?",
        "Todd: What about me? Oh, I don't know. If you asked me a couple months ago, I'd say life is pretty good. Had a beautiful wife and three beautiful kids. And then who shows up? John McBain. Steals the wife. Turns one of the kids against me, who is now 16 and pregnant. He convinces her to give up my grandchild, my flesh and blood, to his sister-in-law.",
        "Marty: I bet you didn't even try to fight back today, did you?",
        "Todd: No. What's the point, really? I don't believe in violence. I never have.",
        "Marty: No, you -- you sound like the opposite of John McBain.",
        "John: You think maybe you should go back with her, maybe see this thing through to the end?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I know it seems like I'm being insanely stubborn, but --",
        "John: She's still crazy about you.",
        "Michael: Well, I'm still crazy about her.",
        "John: You want to let all that go?",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Let's try not to think about the fact that I may have started that fire. D.V., there's a saying that goes, \"if it's out of sight and you're out of your mind, you're not legally responsible\"? But I'm not out of my mind. But I am talking out loud to a dog in a bar. Bingo. I think we just established that I was legally insane when I started that fire. You're a genius. Give me five. Thanks, yo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: John told me you came by the other day. I'm sorry I missed you.",
        "Marcie: Me, too. I thought I'd bring you some clean clothes in case you needed them.",
        "Michael: I was wondering how those got there.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well, I figured you probably --",
        "Michael: Did you want to talk? You haven't changed your mind about adopting Starr's baby, have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: This isn't going to work.",
        "Starr: Okay, Cole, I don't understand.",
        "Cole: What do we do once the baby's born and we give it away? Hmm? We just go back to hanging out, going to movies and stuff?",
        "Starr: No, I know that it's going to be hard.",
        "Cole: Hard? It's impossible.",
        "Starr: Okay, you don't think that I don't understand how you feel? I left my entire family in order to be with you.",
        "Cole: Yeah, for about two minutes. Now you're back home in this nice house with your mom, your brothers, your aunt, your grandma. Maybe you won't miss that baby like I do.",
        "Starr: You still have me.",
        "Cole: All I asked of you was to think, just think about keeping that baby. That's all. But you never really did that, did you? You had your mind already made up, and that was that.",
        "Cole: I'm sure Marcie's a good mom. And I'm glad you got what you want. We can never -- we can never be happy. Not right now. And I wish there was some way that I could get over it, but I can't. I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: Even though -- even though you love me, and I love you more than anything?",
        "Cole: Just not enough. Not anymore.",
        "Starr: I waited to make love to you until I thought that we were ready. But we were so not ready. But I would have waited forever for you, Cole, because -- because I don't want to be with anybody else, okay? We're Starr and Cole, we can't --",
        "Cole: Starr and Cole made a baby and there's no going back.",
        "Starr: Okay, but you signed those rights because deep down inside you know that this is the best thing for the baby, right? I mean, what is it really about, then?",
        "Cole: I did what I did to keep my kid out of the middle of a lawsuit. When I look at you now I feel sad. I don't want that. I want to remember us the way we were, because that was the happiest time of my life.",
        "Starr: Cole, is there anything that I can say in order to make this right?",
        "Cole: No, thing, because even if you change your mind right now about giving our baby to Marcie, you still want to. That's why the best thing is to give our baby away, because you don't want our baby.",
        "Starr: Cole --",
        "Cole: And even if I try to raise our baby myself, the mom wouldn't be around, and that's not fair, either. I don't want our kid to feel unwanted. I don't want our kid growing up feeling like a mistake. And now he won't. End of the story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Now that we're finished thinking about starting fires, let's think about how to put one out. Maybe I can convince Clint that I'm still married to Addie. For $10 million, he just might check. I had the perfect leverage against Dorian, too. She wanted me to divorce Addie so badly. How do I get myself into these messes that lead me to talking to shih-tzus in bars? $10 million, that's how. Do you know what that kind of scratch can buy people like you and me? I guess it was worth it, saving Viki's life. I really do miss the good old days when I didn't have a conscience.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm going to let you two talk.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I, really -- I'll just --",
        "John: It's okay. Catch him while you can.",
        "Michael: Look, I don't want you to think that I don't have time for you.",
        "Marcie: But you don't want to hear that nothing's changed, right? Starr had Judy draw up the adoption papers, Michael. I still want to adopt Starr's baby if I can.",
        "Michael: So, I guess we really don't have anything else to say, then, do we?",

        "Talia: Groom, from hell.",
        "[Jonas laughs]",
        "Jonas: You have spunk. A bride with spunk. Remember, princess, after we consummate, you and I, well, you'll be my real queen.",
        "Talia: Eat some cake. I want to see Antonio now.",
        "Jonas: Well, that's too bad.",
        "Talia: Well, unless I do, the only thing that's going to be made in that bed is the coverlet.",

        "Marty: Is that hurting?",
        "Todd: Hmm. You know, I've done far worse to you.",
        "Marty: What? You've been wonderful to me. When you told me what happened to me in college. Gosh, thank you for being so compassionate. There you go. Ooh, sorry. Sorry.",
        "Todd: That's okay. I don't know what I would have done had you not been here to talk to. You even act like you care.",
        "Marty: I am not acting. I do care.",

        "Starr: I don't want our child to feel like a mistake either, so I actually made her a video so that she'll always know how much I love her.",
        "Cole: Her?",
        "Starr: Well, sometimes I think it's a boy and sometimes I think it's a girl, but I always think about her, Cole. And today, for the first time, I felt her kick.",
        "Cole: Really? What's it like?",
        "Starr: It's like somebody doing that, only inside of your stomach.",
        "Cole: Wow.",
        "Starr: Cole, I will always, always love this baby.",
        "Cole: I think -- I think I want to stop loving her. Knowing every time I see her I can't be her dad, it hurts too much.",
        "Starr: I'm so sorry.",
        "Cole: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Starr: Cole, I wish that there was something I could say in order to make this better. Is there anything I can say?",
        "Cole: You should just say goodbye.",
        "Starr: No, I won't do that, Cole. Please. I will always love you. Always, and even if you can't love me back, I would never give up on us, okay? Never.",

        "Michael: Imagine that, by some miracle, you do get to adopt Starr's baby. What do you think happens next? What happens? Does Todd try to kill you? Does he try to kidnap the baby? Do you go on the run again? How do you possibly think that this could work out for anyone?",
        "Marcie: Call me crazy, Mike, but I have faith that this was meant to be, that I was meant to be a mom, and I still have faith in us.",
        "Michael: What, are you thinking that your faith is going to make me change my mind?",
        "Marcie: No, that has to happen on your own.",
        "Michael: Well, it won't.",
        "Marcie: Hmm. Well, then it might not matter if Cole doesn't sign away his rights to the baby, because that would make you really happy, wouldn't it?",
        "Michael: I don't think there's any one thing that will make both of us happy right now.",
        "Marcie: Well, then I guess we just want different things.",
        "Michael: It didn't used to be that way.",

        "David: Look, my brother, Spencer, killed your father and I grew up thinking that I actually did it, so you and I don't have to chat.",
        "John: Exactly.",
        "Singer: You will never fade away",
        "David: Just for the record, I didn't have the luxury of having a father as nice as yours.",
        "John: I thought you said we weren't going to talk.",
        "David: I was sitting here thinking about fathers, actually. I lost a lot today. I wonder if things would have been different if I'd grown up, and instead of having a gun in my hand when I was young, I had a learner's permit.",
        "John: I'm sure I'm going to regret this, but what's your point?",
        "David: I'm pretty sure I lost my point somewhere around the gun. But I think Spencer and I would have been a lot better off if we had someone other than old Ned Truman. Maybe Spencer wouldn't have grown up to be such a psycho, and he and your dad would still be alive today, and I'd just be a normal guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: [As Emma] You said you don't want me, Asa. I don't want your son as a consolation prize.",
        "Dallas: [As Renee] Well, honey, your life is not over. There's always Spencer's daddy, right? Ned Truman? I mean, maybe you two ought to try it again.",
        "Emma: Where's Spencer?",
        "Rex: [As Bo] Little boys' room. Probably rigging the toilets as we speak.",
        "Renee: Asa, why don't we leave these two young'uns to talk?",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Yeah, sure, that's a great idea.",
        "Emma: Thanks for taking Spencer off my hands for a few minutes. He didn't need to hear all that.",
        "Bo: Is everything all right?",
        "Emma: Uh, this guy I really had a thing for just told me it's over.",
        "Bo: Sorry.",
        "Emma: He wasn't. He told me to look to someone closer to my own age. Ned Truman's my age. Look how that worked out.",
        "Bo: I -- I don't know. What happened?",
        "[Emma sighs]",
        "Emma: Ned is not the easiest man to love, but he is Spencer's father, even if he isn't the best influence on a child.",
        "Bo: I'm guessing that's why Spencer plays with matches and is trying to get me to buy him a kitten.",
        "Emma: Don't be so hard on him. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have Spencer to tell my troubles to. He needs a father. A real father, not a parade of guys who stay for 45 minutes and leave a 20 on the nightstand when he's done. Sorry if that makes you feel uncomfortable. That's what I do -- or did. I'm -- I'm going to leave that life, even if it won't happen the way I was hoping.",
        "Bo: Well, you have to do that. That life's no good for you.",
        "Emma: Why do you care? You don't even know me.",
        "Bo: But I feel like I do.",
        "Gigi: [As Emma] How could I expect your father to make an honest woman out of me? Introduce me to all of his society friends.",
        "Rex: [As Bo] That doesn't mean you have to settle for Truman.",
        "Emma: You have any idea what it's like to be in love with one person and -- and pretty much obliged to another?",
        "Bo: Oh, you have no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: [As Renee] Asa, you did real good thing with Emma, leveling with her. I'm proud of you.",
        "Bo: [As Asa] Well, you can be very persuasive.",
        "[Renee sighs]",
        "Bo: [As himself] But now David Vickers isn't going to be born.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'd rather not talk about Truman. I just ate.",
        "David: Yeah, sorry.",
        "John: See you around, or not.",
        "David: Sounds like a plan. What do you say, D.V.? Should we head over to old Clint Buchanan's house and see if we can't work out a deal? Maybe if I'm brilliant and you're cute, he won't stop payment on the $10 million. That's a great idea. There's almost no chance of it working. Let's give it a shot.",
        "David: That was weird, but explainable, right? I don't feel like a vampire. God, it'd be cool to be a vampire, wouldn't it? You think there's vampire dogs?",

        "Carlo: Now the circle of life will be completed. While the prince and princess, soon to be king and queen, are consummating their marriage, the fraudulent prince and princess will pay in blood for their treason.",

        "Talia: If you touch me, I will break your neck.",
        "Jonas: Oh.",
        "Talia: No, that's right, you should be the one afraid for your life, not Antonio.",
