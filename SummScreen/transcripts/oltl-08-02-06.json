        "Rex: Hey! What's the matter with you? Don't you listen? I told you not to come back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Well, there's salsa, R & B, and a little country -- oh, classical. You said you liked Beethoven, right? I almost forgot -- I also have a little surprise for you. Here, give me your hands.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian -- I bet you look beautiful. Sorry. I think I just want to be alone.",
        "Cristian: I'll come say good night later, ok?",
        "Evangeline: Ok. Cristian? Thank you for trying.",
        "Layla: How is she?",
        "Cristian: Ah. I don't know. She said she wants to be alone.",
        "Layla: She's depressed. How could she not be?",
        "Cristian: I wish I knew what to do about it.",
        "Todd: Here's an idea -- why don't you stay away from her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, I think we definitely got something. I'm -- I'm going to have Vickers explain it to you himself. Yeah, I think that's best.",
        "Natalie: Be right back. So, Nash Brennan. Why don't you give me one good reason why I shouldn't go over there and get John to arrest you for kidnapping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I figured that this would be a good place. It's secluded and all.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, for your safety, we can't be too careful.",
        "Blair: I just feel like I'm stuck, Bo. I can't seem to find anything on Spencer no matter where I look. I don't know what to look for. And I want to help Todd, but --",
        "Bo: There's a new development. Somewhere there's a gun.",
        "Blair: A gun?",
        "Bo: Spencer used it to kill John's father.",
        "Blair: Well, then we got to find it. I got to find it. You -- you just tell me where to look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey, what are you doing here? Hey, what are you doing out? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Adriana: What are you doing talking to my stalker?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Ms. Alvarez, where you going? Ms. Alvarez, wait!",
        "Nora: Let her go, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: You fired her?",
        "Nora: She -- she quit.",
        "Matthew: Why?",
        "Nora: I don't know. I guess I was annoying or something.",
        "Matthew: Mom, this isn't good.",
        "Nora: Oh, Matthew, I will be fine.",
        "Matthew: How? You need a nurse.",
        "Nora: Well -- why? Why? I can get -- I can get out of bed myself, I can walk, you know? I'm not running any 10-ks, but I'm doing pretty good.",
        "Matthew: That's not true. You need a nurse to help you get to the bathroom.",
        "Nora: Matthew --",
        "Matthew: You know you do.",
        "Nora: Oh, you know what? Enough. I am the mother and I make the decisions about me, ok? Having someone stand over me and watch me sleeping -- I can't stand it. I'm doing just great, ok? And the more I have to do for myself, the more I'll be able to do for myself. Listen, I -- I know you're worried about me, and I love you for that. But, sweet, I -- you have to trust me to know what is right for me, ok? You want to watch the -- let's watch the DVD, hmm?",
        "Matthew: Here. I'm not in the mood.",
        "Nora: Matthew -- Matt -- oh, honey, come on. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Natalie, I would never do anything to hurt Jessica.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't hurt Jessica if you thought it would help you get Tess to take over.",
        "Claudia: She's got a point.",
        "Natalie: And you -- do you have any idea how pathetic you are? Glomming on to Nash when he's in love with someone else and coming on to John the her day? I mean --",
        "Nash: Natalie, cut it out.",
        "Natalie: You cut it out, Nash. Stay away from my sister and her baby. And keep this psycho away from me and John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Spencer hid the gun somewhere -- a safe, safe-deposit box.",
        "Blair: It's a murder weapon, Bo. Why would he hold on to it at all?",
        "Bo: Because it was a gift from his father. Now, according to Vickers, it meant a lot to him. My gut says that he has the gun stashed somewhere.",
        "Blair: Well, then we got to find it. We got to expose Spencer. Just got to get this all out in the open so I can finally tell Todd. I mean, that's the only thing that's keeping me sane these days.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Just can't stay away, can you? Never mind that nobody wants you around, that you annoy the crap out of everyone.",
        "Todd: Only you. And I couldn't care less what you think of me. I'm here to see Evangeline.",
        "Cristian: Evangeline only tolerates you. She's too nice to tell you to get lost.",
        "Todd: Evangeline is not only happy to see me always, she's grateful to me that I'm not walking around here like her blindness is the end of the world, like you, which I'm sure is just doing wonders for her depression.",
        "Layla: Ok. Would you two stop? Your fighting isn't helping my sister's depression at all.",
        "Cristian: Hey, where do you think you're going?",
        "Layla: Let him go.",
        "Cristian: The more I see this guy, the more I hate him.",
        "Layla: Ok, look. I'm not sure what's going on between you and Todd and I really don't give a damn right now. All I re about is my sister, and if he can make her feel better, then he should be in there.",
        "Cristian: You don't get , do you? It's all about money. He pays for the surgery, he pays to get into her room, he pays for this damn hospital.",
        "Vincent: Maybe you'll be able to pay for stuff, too, Cristian, if your boxing career goes well.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, right. Just make sure you promote the hell out of my fight.",
        "Vincent: I'll do my job. You just do your job and win the damn fight.",
        "Cristian: I'll be back.",
        "Layla: Did you mean that? You think Cristian can make it big?",
        "Vincent: He's going to win me a lot of money.",
        "Layla: I'm starting to get the point. Anyway, I hope you're right about Cristian for Vange's sake.",
        "Vincent: How about you take a ride with me?",
        "Layla: Hmm, I -- I don't want to leave her here all alone.",
        "Vincent: Your sister's in there with a visitor, d you definitely need some air. Will you trust me? Half an hour, then I'll bring you right back here.",
        "Layla: Sure.",
        "Todd: I don't know what's the matter with you. You never gave up on me and now you're so willing to give up on yourself.",
        "Evangeline: I'm not giving up. I'm -- I'm just processing. When this first happened to me and all the doctors said they thought the blindness was permanent, I didn't believe it. I just -- I thought that one day I would open my eyes and it would all be over like a bad dream. And you know, I just -- didn't matter how unrealistic. I held on to that.",
        "Todd: And you still should hold on to it.",
        "Evangeline: No. No, I can't, because now I know that this will never change. This is who I am, this is my reality, and I have to make peace with that, Todd, and if you're my friend, you do, too.",
        "Todd: All right. Then I'm not your friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Whoa, you're stalker? What are you talking about?",
        "Adriana: I saw you, Rex, talking to the guy in the hoodie!",
        "Rex: No, no, no. Adriana, you've got this all wrong.",
        "Adriana: Rex, I saw you with my own eyes! What are you doing?",
        "Rex: Would you just listen to me a minute, let me explain?",
        "Adriana: This is crazy. I don't understand any of this.",
        "Rex: Not so fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nora: Matthew. Come on in. We can watch this DVD -- Paige, what are you doing here?",
        "Paige: I'm here to kick your ass.",
        "Nora: Well, that'll be difficult.",
        "Paige: Your home-care nurse quit? That's the third one in two days, so Matthew called in the big guns.",
        "Nora: Oh, I suppose that's you?",
        "Paige: Damn straight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Ok, ok. You're not my friend -- I get it because I want to accept my fate and you don't want me to. You're going to, what, give me a little dose of tough love and threaten to pull your friendship until I see it your way, Todd? Ok, you're right. You're right -- I'm still blind because I'm not fighting hard enough.",
        "Todd: What a defeatist you are.",
        "Evangeline: What a Pollyanna you are.",
        "Todd: Well, I talked to another doctor. I called this guy in Scotland. I talked to him a little while. Of course, he had this brogue so thick I could barely understand a word he said, but I'm going to fly him out here.",
        "Evangeline: Will you stop it? Will you just stop it? Please! I can't believe you care this much about me. Thank you. Thank you for trying so hard to give me hope, but it's not working, Todd. You're making me feel worse. You're making me feel guilty for not being able to be hopeful about seeing again. The best thing for me right now is -- is to accept my fate. This is who I am. I am a blind woman, Todd. And as my friend, I need you to help me embrace it, not fight it.",
        "Todd: You're entitled to your opinion. I -- I don't happen to share your opinion and I'm not going to give up.",
        "Evangeline: Well, you don't have a choice. But you don't have to worry about me -- I'm going to be ok. I'm -- I'm wallowing a bit right now, but I'm resilient. I bounce back.",
        "Todd: I'm going to make sure you don't have to. [Phone rings] I need to take this. Sorry. Yeah? All right, when? Yeah, ok. Thanks.",
        "Evangeline: Sounds important.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it is. It's something I have to take care of right now.",
        "Evangeline: Ok, then. Go. Get out of here.",
        "Todd: This isn't over.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Cristian: I've made a decision. I'm going to find you another doctor.",
        "Evangeline: You're as bad as Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: It haunts me every single day that I didn't believe in Todd.",
        "Bo: You know, you're too hard on yourself. There were reasons.",
        "Blair: None of them good enough. I love Todd. And when he needed me the most, I didn't believe in him. Now I got to make it up to him. I've got to take down the bastard who tried to take him down and I'm going to. I'm going to redeem myself. If I can do just this much, then maybe I can live with myself again.",
        "Bo: Everybody wants to see Spencer get what's coming to him, but the more time that he has, the greater the chances are that he's going to get away with it. I mean, he didn't hide the truth about Thomas McBain's shooting without a whole lot of planning.",
        "Blair: Yeah -- planning Margaret's death, setting you up, setting Todd up.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, he's a sociopath. He's smart. He's -- he's cold, and so we -- we just can't give him more time to figure out another way out.",
        "Blair: Well, I understand that much.",
        "Bo: You know, I'd hoped that there was a better way, a different way that we could go about this without you having to keep pretending with Spencer.",
        "Blair: No, look, I am going to get that gun for you. You can count on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You've got this all wrong!",
        "Adriana: I'm not stupid, Rex!",
        "Rex: No, no, of course not. I get you think what you think. It's totally understandable. That dude was wearing a hoodie and it was just like the hoodie the guy we were running from was wearing, ok? But this man is --",
        "Adriana: This better be good.",
        "Rex: Would you listen? He's a beach bum.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, right.",
        "Rex: He's homeless, begged me for money.",
        "Adriana: A homeless guy, out here?",
        "Rex: He sleeps on the beach somewhere right around here. I've been watching him. He hangs out and bums change off people. I saw him for the first time when I left to get the pizza, and every time I've left the house, I've seen him. So I gave him some cash and told him to get lost because I didn't want you to freak out again.",
        "Adriana: Good plan.",
        "Rex: Not so much apparently.",
        "Adriana: What were you doing out there in the middle of the night?",
        "Rex: The dude was lurking again, woke me up. So what you saw was me telling him to go find another beach to haunt -- period. Why would you accuse me of doing anything other than loving you? You know that I would do anything in this world to make you happy. You're my life, Adriana -- the best thing that has ever happened to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Your son is worried sick about you.",
        "Nora: Well, he shouldn't worry about me. I don't need 24-hour surveillance. I'm not an invalid.",
        "Paige: Do you still need help getting to the bathroom?",
        "Nora: Well, I really don't think that's any of your business, Paige. Will you just go, please just go? Leave me alone.",
        "Paige: Nora, the reason Matthew went this far -- I mean, he called me. He could've called Bo or R.J. or some of your friends. I think -- I think he thought I wouldn't let you off the hook. I think he thought that you would listen to me. So what do you say? Do we prove your kid right or wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: So this is your idea of showing a girl a good time -- taking her down to the docks?",
        "Vincent: It's quiet, nice and cool.",
        "Layla: Drive me back.",
        "Vincent: What?",
        "Layla: To the hospital -- I should be there.",
        "Vincent: Your sister's resting.",
        "Layla: Yeah, but she may need me, Vincent. She's all I have.",
        "Vincent: What about what you need?",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Layla: So, this is why you brought me down here -- to kiss me?",
        "Vincent: Shh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I am nothing like Todd.",
        "Evangeline: You're trying to manage my life.",
        "Cristian: Because I want to find you another doctor?",
        "Evangeline: Your words, exactly -- \"I'm going to get you another doctor.\" I'm perfectly capable of getting my own doctor if I thought it would do any good.",
        "Cristian: Right, so you're just going to give up?",
        "Evangeline: No. But I'm not going to live in denial anymore. It's too much work. I'm a blind woman. Oh, my god. That just sounds unreal.",
        "Cristian: There's a difference between \"real\" and \"permanent.\" I mean we haven't even started looking for a cure here.",
        "Evangeline: There is no cure, Cristian. I'm not a candidate for a corneal transplant -- damn it. I'm not going to do this anymore. I can't keep trying to fight reality. I really am ok with this.",
        "Cristian: No, you're not.",
        "Evangeline: You know me. I mean, I'm not giving up. I'm -- you know that I'm a fighter, too.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, that's right. You're the kind of person that doesn't start something unless you can finish it.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, what, that's supposed to be a compliment?",
        "Cristian: Well, it depends, because when it comes to helping others, you're unstoppable. But when the problem's in your own life --",
        "Evangeline: This is not a problem.",
        "Cristian: I think you're afraid to get your hopes up because you don't like to lose.",
        "Evangeline: Nobody likes losing, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: No, but most people can handle it. Think about it -- what would happen if you fought for your eyesight the way you fought for Todd's life or mine?",
        "Evangeline: It's different. My condition is, it's -- it's hopeless.",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on! What the hell's the matter with you? You've got absolutely nothing to lose.",
        "Evangeline: Time. I'm not going to waste any more running from doctor to doctor.",
        "Cristian: Well, you've barely even started looking.",
        "Evangeline: This conversation is over.",
        "Cristian: I am not done.",
        "Evangeline: Will you get out of my room? Can you just get out, please?",
        "Cristian: You're only a failure if you don't cry. You're strong. You could beat this. You can find a way to see again. And in the meantime, hey, you can learn everything there is to know about being a blind woman. I know how you love projects. Well, guess what -- now you've got two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I was completely out of line accusing you like that. I feel horrible.",
        "Rex: Hey. You were upset. Who can blame you? Just know that I would never, ever hurt you.",
        "Adriana: I do.",
        "Rex: I love you, Adriana -- more than I've ever loved anyone.",
        "Adriana: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Do you understand anything about the disease that Jessica has? I mean, you could have caused her to have a complete mental breakdown. This is not a phase -- it's an illness.",
        "Nash: I am quite clear on Jessica's illness.",
        "Natalie: You know, I -- I don't think you are or why would you risk her health by kidnapping her?",
        "Nash: Your sister's more than just Jessica. Tess is a very big part of her, and that baby is mine. She's my daughter, my flesh and blood, and I love her and I love Tess.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's heartwarming. So in order to get close to your sweet, little flesh-and-blood baby, you force her mother into a situation that is extremely dangerous for her?",
        "Nash: Natalie --",
        "Natalie: And then when that doesn't work, you come back and you hit on your ex? That's --",
        "Nash: Go away.",
        "Natalie: And, you know, she's a great gal and all -- slutty, but I guess that's her job.",
        "Claudia: Whoa. Your boyfriend kisses me and now you're out for blood? Sounds like someone's a little insecure.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I don't think so. You kissed him. He did not kiss you. Get the story straight -- we're not in high school.",
        "Claudia: Nope, not even close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Look, Vickers, for what it's worth, the fact that you weren't the one who actually killed my father --",
        "David: Listen, listen. If you can't get past the fact that I was involved in your father's murder, I can't blame you. I fired at the man. It doesn't really matter that it wasn't my gun that killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: All right, I'll get back to you. Blair, I got to check on something, then I'll walk you to your car.",
        "Blair: All right. Bo?",
        "Bo: Hmm?",
        "Blair: Thank you so much for everything. [Phone rings] Hey, Starr. No, sweetie, I'm not coming home tonight. You know I don't think that I have to answer that. Because I think it doesn't concern you what I'm doing and who I'm with, all right, sweetheart? Look, I am sorry that I can't tell you what's going on in my private life right now, but if you'll just -- if you'll just hold on and understand that I know what I'm -- Starr, please don't talk to me like that. Starr -- Starr?",
        "Todd: Does Spencer know you're here whoring it up at some dive bar?",
        "Blair: You following me, Todd?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Are you having me followed?",
        "Todd: That would be a waste of time. I'd have to care about what you were doing in order to have you followed. Clearly, I don't care about what you're doing.",
        "Blair: Hmm. Clearly.",
        "Todd: You saying I'm lying? Hmm? Just say it. You used to say it when you thought I was lying.",
        "Blair: I used to always know when you were lying.",
        "Todd: Well, I always knew when you were lying. I have never been wrong. I'm not wrong now.",
        "Blair: So what am I lying to you about, Todd?",
        "Todd: Us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Do you have any idea how sad you are hanging around Nash here, who doesn't love you, and in fact, didn't he dump you all those years ago because he didn't love you then, either?",
        "Nash: Natalie, you're mad at me because of my relationship with your sister. That's fine, give me hell, but leave her alone.",
        "Natalie: You just better watch your step around my family. And when I say \"family,\" I mean my sister and my niece. You may be her flesh and blood, but you will never be a father in the way it counts.",
        "Nash: Don't you dare talk to me about my daughter.",
        "Natalie: Oh, come on, Nash.",
        "John: What's going on, champ?",
        "Natalie: I've got it covered, John.",
        "John: You can't be doing this if you want to have the job --",
        "Natalie: John, don't do this to me right now.",
        "John: Come on. Come to the bar, I'll buy you a beer, we'll cool off.",
        "Natalie: I'm going home.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Claudia: I didn't expect that from you.",
        "John: Well, Natalie loves her sister and that's -- that's what that's all about.",

        "Vincent: I brought you down here so you can get away from the hospital for a little while. I know how worried you've been about your sister lately and I thought maybe you could use a break.",
