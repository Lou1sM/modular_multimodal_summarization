        "Destiny finally admits to Dani that she is pregnant from the one time she had sex with Matthew and now that they both know that Nate put Matthew in the hospital, Destiny tells Dani she mustn't let him get away with it. Bo and Nora know that the person who came to their house and assaulted their son has a gum wrapper which they are keeping for evidence although they cannot figure out who it would be. Nate secretly tells his brother that it's only a matter of time before Bo and Nora find out that he put Matthew in the hospital so he has to leave town in order to avoid a prison charge and he informs Robert that Rick \"motivated\" him and Deanna to do the porn flick by threatening to tell Matthew's parents what he knows if they refuse to do it. David finds out that Nate chews the gum in question although he is unaware that Nate assaulted Matthew. Bo discovers David chewing Nate's gum, asks where he found it and David tells him it's from the kid who got The Vicker Man erased by doing the porn flick."

        "Kelly: Hello! We're home!",
        "Dorian: Hi, honey. Welcome home.",
        "Kelly: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Hello, Joe.",
        "Joey: Dorian.",
        "Dorian: How was your trip?",
        "Kelly: Fantastic. Zane's camp show was awesome.",
        "Joey: My nephew had the best song in the show.",
        "Kelly: How was the premiere?",
        "David: There was no premiere, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no! What happened? Did you have to cancel?",
        "David: Oh, no.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no. There was a viewing.",
        "David: There was a viewing, all right!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Is this true? \"Hold the Diploma\" starring Nate?",
        "Dani: Yeah, unfortunately.",
        "Destiny: You actually saw this hot mess?",
        "Dani: Oh, yeah. All of it. Des, I can't believe this. It's like I don't know Nate at all.",
        "Destiny: You don't. There's a lot more about Nate that you don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Is this why you're hiding back here?",
        "Nate: You'd think that there was more important news in the world.",
        "Ford: It's Todd Manning's newspaper. What's more important than humiliating the guy that broke his daughter's heart?",
        "Nate: Did you come in here to cheer me up, 'cause it's not--",
        "Ford: Nate, what were you thinking? If you needed cash, why didn't you just come talk to me?",
        "Nate: I didn't do it for money. The director blackmailed us.",
        "Ford: What blackmail? How?",
        "Nate: He found out what I did to Matthew Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Can't believe that's happening today.",
        "Nora: It was almost a year ago that Clint had David kidnapped, and then it all began.",
        "Bo: Now he's being arraigned for all of it.",
        "Nora: Yeah. For months, I couldn't wait to throw the book at him.",
        "Bo: What about now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You didn't have to bring me. I could have gotten a wheelchair with a motor.",
        "Viki: You're welcome.",
        "Clint: Thank you. It'll be nice to have a friendly face around. So thank you.",
        "Viki: Jessica and Natalie would have come, if you had let them.",
        "Clint: They don't need to see their father carted off to jail.",
        "Viki: Our girls are much stronger than you think.",
        "Clint: I know they are. I know that all of my kids will be ok.",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Clint: Except Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Ah, free at last! Free at last!",
        "Rex: Hey.",
        "Echo: \"Hey\"? That's pretty low-key for the man of the hour.",
        "Rex: I'm not that.",
        "Echo: You got Dorian to drop the charges against me. You're my hero.",
        "Rex: I'm definitely not that. Sorry I couldn't get you out last night.",
        "Echo: Hey, lucky to be out at all. How did you and Shane get through the night?",
        "Rex: He hung out with Roxy.",
        "Echo: You were here alone?",
        "Rex: No. Gigi was here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Destiny was asleep when I got home last night. She was gone by the time I got up.",
        "Vivian: She's probably avoiding you. If I'm right and she's pregnant, she's probably afraid you'll find out.",
        "Shaun: I can't stand to think of little \"D\" scared to see me. If she's in trouble, I'm the guy she should come to.",
        "Vivian: Shaun, this is not ordinary trouble, though. If Destiny's pregnant, what are you gonna say to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Destiny, what do you know about Nate that I don't?",
        "Destiny: Maybe nothing. It could just be a coincidence.",
        "Dani: What could be?",
        "Destiny: You know how Matthew's parents have been trying to figure out who might have caused his accident?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Destiny: Well, they found this gum wrapper at their house from the day Matthew got hurt. I don't think it's very common.",
        "Dani: What does that have to do with Nate?",
        "Destiny: He had that same gum last night.",
        "Dani: Oh, God.",
        "Destiny: Nate knew Matthew killed his father. Do you think he could--",
        "Dani: I know he did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: What did you do to Matthew Buchanan?",
        "Nate: I decked him... the day he ended up in the hospital.",
        "Ford: Oh, man.",
        "Nate: I didn't know I'd hurt him. He got up. He was talking to me. He was fine when I left.",
        "Ford: Then it wasn't your fault.",
        "Nate: No, it was. That kind of injury--the person seems fine, but then a few hours later...",
        "Ford: Why did you hit him?",
        "Nate: I heard what he did, and I wanted him to pay.",
        "Ford: For what?",
        "Nate: He killed our dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Bo, I have to prosecute Clint for Eddie Ford's murder.",
        "Bo: There's no way around it.",
        "Nora: He confessed on television. It would look very suspicious if I didn't.",
        "Bo: What if he recants his statement?",
        "Nora: Then he recants.",
        "Bo: What'll you do then?",
        "Nora: What do you want me to say?",
        "Bo: Honey, we both know Clint didn't kill Eddie Ford. It's one thing to let him take the rap for Matthew when we let him spend the rest of his life in prison for something that he didn't do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're worried about Rex, hmm?",
        "Clint: You saw him the other day.",
        "Viki: When he came to visit you in the hospital?",
        "Clint: If that's what you call it.",
        "Viki: He left very quickly, and Natalie said he barely said a word to her when she caught up with him. Clint, he's grieving.",
        "Clint: No. It's far worse than that.",
        "Viki: Then do you want to tell me what this unfinished business was that he was there about?",
        "Clint: It's not the business. It's the way he does business. The boy now has ice water in his veins.",
        "Viki: You're worried about him. That's good. That's a lot better than not even wanting to recognize him as your son.",
        "Clint: He's still a greedy manipulator. He proved that when he blackmailed me and took everything I owned.",
        "Viki: His heart was broken.",
        "Clint: Doesn't change the fact that he's on a dark path. I know Rex doesn't want to hear advice from me, but I have seen what happens. I have lived what happens when there's nothing in your life but revenge. Shane just lost his mother. He now needs a father to take care of him.",
        "Viki: So this is about Shane.",
        "Clint: Of course it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Gigi was here? Last night?",
        "Rex: Forget it.",
        "Echo: Rex, you know, right, that--",
        "Rex: Yes, I know. She's dead. I remember. Like I said, just forget it.",
        "Echo: No, tell me. So you saw Gigi...",
        "Rex: I know how it sounds, but I saw Gigi outside last night. I ran out, but she was gone. You think I'm crazy.",
        "Echo: Oh, no, Rex, I don't. I'm surprised that you don't see her everywhere you look. I know it's not the same, but so many times I think I've seen Charlie.",
        "Rex: It wasn't that.",
        "Echo: No, it was probably an animal making noise or a branch or--",
        "Rex: No, it wasn't that! It-- you're right. I saw what I wanted to see. It couldn't have been Gigi. I'm",
        "Echo: Let us celebrate you getting me out of the hoosegow. How about that? I'll fix you some breakfast.",
        "Rex: Gigi used to make peanut butter smoothies. I don't even know how--",
        "Echo: I can figure it out myself.",
        "Rex: It's ok.",
        "Echo: I want to do something, Rex. I want to do something for you.",
        "Rex: You don't owe me anything.",
        "Echo: Well, I do owe you an apology. I put you in a terrible situation. You had to ask Clint for a favor for me.",
        "Rex: So? It's not like I care what he thinks of me.",
        "Echo: I'm still amazed that he even did it.",
        "Rex: It wasn't for you or me.",
        "Echo: I know. Whatever the reason, I promise I'll never put you in that situation again. It's just that Dorian made me so crazy about costing me Charlie that I couldn't think straight.",
        "Rex: Believe me. I know what that's like.",
        "Echo: Yeah, but you would never kidnap a woman and haul her off to the Minute Man motel.",
        "Rex: No, I'd go another way.",
        "Echo: I promise you won't have to compromise yourself to bail me out ever again.",
        "[Rex chuckling]",
        "Echo: Hey. What's so funny about that?",
        "Rex: You think you were desperate to get back at Dorian?",
        "Echo: Rex?",
        "Rex: I almost committed murder last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Echo DiSavoy walks?",
        "Joey: I thought you had her dead to rights.",
        "Kelly: How could they let her go?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: How about if we worry about you for a change, huh?",
        "Clint: Nah, there's no need to.",
        "Viki: You're about to be charged with a crime that you did not commit. Not just any crime-- murder.",
        "Clint: Viki, I decided when I confessed.",
        "Viki: I know, but you thought you were dying. It's one thing to protect Matthew then, but now?",
        "Clint: Now I'm going to prison for a lot of things I did do. Have you done the math on this?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Clint: Even without the murder charge, I will be 90 years old before I get out of prison. Another 20 years just doesn't matter.",
        "Viki: It matters to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We can't duck the question, Red.",
        "Nora: You think I slept last night? I didn't, and I know you didn't either.",
        "Bo: So what's the answer? Clint confessed. That's it?",
        "Nora: Do you know what keeps me going? Matthew. He's fighting back. He's trying to come home, you know. It may take years, but our son is coming home to us.",
        "Bo: Yes, he will.",
        "Nora: So he comes home to have this normal life, and what do we do, we throw him in prison? Can you stand that? 'Cause I can't. I don't think I could make it through next week, let alone a whole lifetime with that. This is a question we haven't answered, Bo.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Nora: Could you do it? Could you throw our son in prison?",
        "Bo: What if it's not up to us? Someone else knows the truth.",
        "Nora: The person who hurt Matthew.",
        "Bo: And they could expose him anytime.",
        "Nora: Yeah. The only thing we have to go on to figuring out who that person is is this. Any leads?",
        "Bo: Not yet.",
        "Nora: Yeah. So I think it's time that we accept the fact that we are never going to know who put Matthew where he is today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Matthew killed our father? You sure?",
        "Nate: He admitted it. He sat there while I was arrested, while our mother was arrested, didn't do a thing. He would have just let us go to jail.",
        "Ford: I probably would have hit him, too.",
        "Nate: Hard enough to make his brain bleed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Nate confessed last night. He told me it was the reason he did the porn film.",
        "Destiny: What? How does that make sense?",
        "Nate: That sleaze, Rick, found out what I did, and he was gonna go to Commissioner Buchanan.",
        "Ford: Whoa. Why didn't you go to him first, tell him the truth?",
        "Nate: I was going to, but Deanna kept saying it wouldn't help anyone if I went to jail.",
        "Ford: Deanna. You talked to Deanna about this?",
        "Nate: I had to tell someone. She was right. Matthew's parents are on the warpath trying to figure out what happened to him. If they knew that it was me--",
        "Ford: No, you're right. You're right but, dude, this movie-- really?",
        "Nate: We thought that it would solve our problems. Deanna would get the file on her mother, and I would get Rick off my back.",
        "Ford: So Deanna knows, but she's out of town. She's gone. What about this director, Rick?",
        "Nate: He left town after his big debut last night.",
        "Ford: Does anybody else know?",
        "Nate: I, um...told Dani last night.",
        "Ford: What's she gonna do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Dani, you have to tell Matthew's parents that Nate is the one who hit him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I decided--we decided to take the high road with Echo.",
        "Kelly: The woman kidnapped you.",
        "Joey: You said she would have killed you if Sam hadn't found you.",
        "Dorian: I perhaps overstated.",
        "David: You two don't know us very well, do you? We accentuate the positive. Dorian and I selflessly funneled that energy into our film, into my career.",
        "Dorian: And I was too focused on our premiere to give Echo any thought.",
        "Kelly: But now...",
        "David: But now, you two get to be the first people to see the premiere for the very first time. So, Joey, Kelly, have a seat. No pun intended. You get to be the first ones to see my movie.",
        "Joey: You know, we're really sorry, but we have to get over to my father's arraignment.",
        "Kelly: We actually just came by to drop off the luggage. I will see you guys later?",
        "Dorian: We'll be here.",
        "Joey: All right, bye.",
        "David: Why wouldn't they want to see my movie? It's about me. Do you believe that lame story about Clint's arraignment?",
        "Dorian: We're just gonna have to be ok with the fact that Clint is indeed gonna go to prison even if Echo is going to walk. But I'll tell you, I hate the fact that that beyatch is getting away with anything.",
        "David: It's a lot better than you having to go back to the slammer. Hey, I've got a great idea. Why don't we take the DVD, go over to Bo and Step-Nora's, have a private premiere over there?",
        "Dorian: I would love to spend time with the in-laws, but I just feel that that is an opportunity for you to have quality family time with them.",
        "David: You are so rip-roaring hot with your thoughtful.",
        "Dorian: You're rip-roaring hot anytime. I've got things to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: I didn't know you had a gun.",
        "Rex: It came with the house. Who knows. Clint's shotgun's probably around here somewhere. Might be a relief to a lot of people who don't know better.",
        "Echo: What happened last night, Rex?",
        "Rex: I had the TV on, not to watch it, just... anyway, it was the red carpet of the David Vickers movie.",
        "Echo: That must have been good for a laugh.",
        "Rex: Yeah, it was. Then Todd shows up on the red carpet with his whole family --T\u00e9a:, Blair, his kids. There Todd is, just grinning away with Jack. And then Blanca Morales asks them about Gigi. About how Jack was charged with the murder. And Todd--he just blows it off. He just blows it off, goes walking down the red carpet like it was nothing. So next thing I know, I grabbed the gun out of the safe and I'm at the premiere.",
        "Echo: Wow. What did you do?",
        "Rex: There they are, Todd and Jack in their tuxes with their perfect lives. Todd even gets to keep his ex-wife around. How fair is that? Everybody that Todd loves is around him. So I raised the gun, aiming it at Todd first.",
        "Echo: Why didn't you shoot?",
        "Rex: I got a text message from Shane.",
        "Echo: What did he say?",
        "Rex: Good night, and that he misses me. Then all I could think about is my son, my incredible son. Gigi's son. How I could kill Todd and his entire family, but then what would happen to Shane.",
        "Echo: That's a good question.",
        "Rex: Then I was thinking about everything that would have to happen next, how Bo would have to arrest me.",
        "Echo: He'd hate that.",
        "Rex: Believe me, I know what it's like to upset him. This would be so much worse. So the next thing I know is... I remember driving home in the car, and I'm having this conversation in my head with Gigi...chewing me out, yelling at me. I know exactly what she'd say.",
        "Echo: What did she say?",
        "Rex: \"So sure, you would go ahead and kill all these people, his whole family. So what? It wouldn't bring me back. How could you do this to Shane. Balsom, what were you thinking?\"",
        "Echo: That sounds like Gigi to me. I'm glad you listened.",
        "Rex: Me too.",
        "Echo: You did the right thing, Rex. You know that, right?",
        "Rex: I was so focused on revenge, I didn't have to think about anything else. Gigi's gone. She's not coming back. I just can't go on without her. What do I do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I don't know if I can tell Matthew's parents.",
        "Destiny: Dani, they deserve to know what happened to their son.",
        "Dani: I know, but Nate deserved to know what happened to his dad, too, and I kept my mouth shut because you begged me to.",
        "Destiny: So what? I have to protect \"Mr. Exposed\"?",
        "Dani: I don't know, ok? When I look at that picture, I don't ever want to see him again. Last night, I watched him having sex with another girl. How do you even get over that?",
        "Destiny: I don't know.",
        "Dani: I don't know either. Des, I can't help it. I still love him.",
        "Destiny: Are you gonna forgive him?",
        "Dani: I don't know. What happened with Matthew... I don't know if Nate should go to prison for that.",
        "Destiny: So what? Nate gets to just walk around after what he did?",
        "Dani: I told you, I don't know. I need time to think, ok? Just don't go to the Buchanans yet, please. Give me a little while. I know this is probably all you think about, and I'm asking a lot, but... Des, what?",
        "Destiny: I wish--Dani, Dani, I am so sorry.",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Destiny: I lied to you, Dani. I should have gone straight to my best friend, but I was so scared.",
        "Dani: Tell me.",
        "Destiny: I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: Ok, so, you'll tell Destiny that you love her and that you'll always love her and be in her corner, and then what? When she asks you \"what should I do?\" What are you gonna say?",
        "Shaun: I don't know. Am I supposed to have an answer to that?",
        "Vivian: She might ask.",
        "Shaun: When I went to check on Destiny this morning, she wasn't there, but her teddy bear was there in the bed. The girl's still a child herself. How can she be having a child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I don't know what Dani's gonna do. She was not in the mood to talk to me last night.",
        "Ford: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Ford: I don't understand why you didn't come to me as soon as you knew about Matthew. We could have figured something out.",
        "Nate: You were in the middle of that whole Tess thing and Ryder's custody battle. Besides, there was nothing you could do.",
        "Ford: Well, maybe we should go to Bo and Nora and explain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Nora, you know that I won't stop looking for whoever hurt Matthew. I can't.",
        "Nora: No, you can't. You have to keep investigating.",
        "Bo: But Clint gets arraigned today.",
        "Nora: He confessed, Bo. Unless that changes, I have to do my job. Now I'm due in court.",
        "Bo: Let me know how it goes.",
        "Nora: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I cannot believe that your first trip after a heart transplant is to court. That stress cannot be good for you.",
        "Clint: The ticker's fine, until the doctor gives me the bill. Oh, Higgins. This is my attorney, Mr. Higgins. Mr. Higgins, this is Victoria Lord, my ex- wife.",
        "Viki: Hello.",
        "Clint: Don't start in on me now. I confessed. On television. So I have to plead guilty.",
        "Higgins: No, you don't. I can make that confession disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Right, but yesterday Matthew was so alert. Has he responded to anything today? A light? Voices? Any... yeah, I know, I know. You'll let us know if there's any change. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Buchanans are good people, Nate.",
        "Nate: Yeah, they are.",
        "Ford: Might be angry, but they'll understand.",
        "Nate: Their son might never be all right again because I assaulted him.",
        "Ford: It was an accident.",
        "Nate: And I look even more guilty 'cause I kept quiet this long.",
        "Ford: It doesn't help that you're hiding back here. You gotta go out and face the world.",
        "Nate: The world saw enough of me last night.",
        "Ford: Fair enough, but you need to find out what Dani's gonna do. Call me if you talk to her, ok? I'll be at work.",
        "Nate: You can fit a phone in that hot dog suit?",
        "Ford: I will today. Call me.",
        "David: Well, well, well. I should have known you'd be related to the world's biggest wiener. Thanks for ruining my premiere.",
        "Nate: I didn't want anyone to see that movie.",
        "David: Oh, I'll bet you didn't. What were some of those line readings you gave? You are a horrible actor. You got any more gum? I like gum.",
        "Nate: You know what, keep it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Does Shaun know?",
        "Destiny: Nobody does.",
        "Dani: You haven't told anybody? Not even a doctor? Des, you have to see a doctor.",
        "Destiny: No! She already suspects something, and she'd just tell Shaun, if she hasn't yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: Destiny may seem like a child, but she's got a real grown-up situation to figure out.",
        "Shaun: But how?",
        "Vivian: Shaun, you better get it out with me before you--",
        "Shaun: The girl is responsible. How does she end up... if Matthew was walking around right now, I would be at his door so fast.",
        "Vivian: You don't know that they didn't use protection. It's not magic, Shaun. Even people who use birth control end up in the same situation.",
        "Shaun: Which is why no boy should have touched her till she was at least 30.",
        "Vivian: That would have worked. And make sure you say it with that look on your face.",
        "Shaun: Yeah.",
        "Vivian: Look, I get it. I do, but Destiny needs to feel safe to talk. There are decisions to be made and soon.",
        "Viki: Oh, you claim that you were not in your right mind when you confessed, that your heart failure and your medication left you confused and disoriented.",
        "Clint: That's what it says.",
        "Viki: Is it true?",
        "Clint: You had a transplant. Were you clear-headed all the time when your heart was failing?",
        "Viki: No, of course it wasn't.",
        "Clint: Then I could read that and plead not guilty.",
        "Joey: Dad.",
        "Clint: Oh, you made it.",
        "Viki: I'm so glad. I didn't think you'd make it in time.",
        "Joey: I wasn't gonna let my father go to court without me.",
        "Kelly: We caught the first flight after Zane's show.",
        "Joey: We wanted to be here.",
        "Kelly: So did I.",
        "Clint: It's good to see you so happy.",
        "Kelly: We are happy.",
        "Clint: You belong together. I'm glad you both figured that out at the same time.",
        "Joey: We're all gonna celebrate together when we take you home.",
        "Clint: You know something? I could be real happy just right here in this chair.",
        "Viki: Excuse me. Nora. How are you?",
        "Nora: Ready to work.",
        "Viki: Nora, I know the things that Clint did were just awful, especially what he did to you\u0097",
        "Bailiff: All rise. Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Lee presiding.",

        "Vivian: Given how long Matthew's been in the hospital, Destiny has to be near the end of her first trimester.",
        "Shaun: So she's gotta decide something soon.",
        "Vivian: Very soon.",
        "Shaun: How does this work out, Viv? Is any answer to this good for Destiny? I want to do what's best for her, but--",
        "Vivian: I know.",
        "Shaun: I don't know what that is. What am I supposed to tell her to do?",
        "Vivian: You can't tell her. Destiny has to decide for herself, but I'll talk to her, ok, and I'll make her understand everything, so she can make the right choice for her.",
        "Shaun: I don't know how I got so lucky.",
        "Vivian: I'm glad I'm here. I love you, baby. And I love Destiny, too.",

        "David: Hey, Pa.",
        "Bo: What's that?",
        "David: Since you couldn't come to the movie premiere, I decided the movie premiere would come to you.",
        "Bo: This isn't really a good time.",
        "David: Last night wasn't a good time either, if you saw the paper.",
        "Bo: We did.",
        "David: I decided after that fiasco, a private family premiere is really the only way to go. I can promise you something. We've got so much better production value in our movie than they did in \"Hold the Diploma\" for crying out loud. I also brought you a breakfast burrito.",
        "Bo: Thank you, but--",
        "David: Pa. It would really mean a lot to me if you're the first person to see my movie.",
        "Bo: Well, then, I would be honored.",

        "Bo: The hospital said he's well enough to go to court.",
        "David: Then he's well enough to do time breaking rocks in prison for a while. I know he's your brother, Pa, but he locked me away for no good reason. Clint should go to jail.",

In the matter of the abduction and incarceration of David Vickers Buchanan, you are charged with one count each of kidnapping, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, criminal conspiracy, and criminal solicitation.

        "Echo: It'll come back. And you still have your son.",

        "Echo: But eventually, you are gonna have to do right by Gigi.",
        "Rex: What does that mean?",
        "Echo: She waited 10 years for you, right? Because she knew you were worth it. To her, you were the greatest guy in the world.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Echo: Hey, listen to me. What do you think she'd want for your future, Rex?",
