        "Adriana looks at the laptop while Rex sleeps. She finds many, many messages from Rex to her email address. \"Oh no!\" she says suddenly realizing what this means. Rex still sleeps quietly on the bed a few feet away. Starr tells her father that she is afraid that her mother is about to marry Spencer. She spends all her time with him. Meanwhile, at the apartment, Spencer shows Blair plans of a house that he wants to show her. Blair tells Bo that she is going to get the goods on Spencer that night. She butters him up and talks about the similarities of their pasts. She asks about Lenny. Spencer tells where the man lives and how he has done well for himself with a could of scores he has made, and then investment deals. He watches Blair carefully when he tells EXACTLY where Lenny lives. Blair decides she needs to leave for cookies and while in the hall she calls Bo and tells him EXACTLY where Lenny is. John and Bo can tell right away that Spencer is onto Blair and they order her out of his building right away. She will not leave. She has to find the gun next. While she is on the phone, Spencer is in the apartment calling an associate and telling him to get to the condos and call back if the cops show up. Bo and John decide that they won't send a car up as that might blow Blair's cover. Instead they will just fax a picture of Lenny to see if he can be recognized that way. Spencer and Blair are making love and she has to envision that it is Todd that she is with to get through it. Spencer's man calls and tells that there isn't a leak and that no cops showed up at Lenny's. David mentions that when Spencer got David out of town long ago, he used a boat to do it. Bo and John decide that Lenny might be trying to do just that. They head to the pier and catch Lenny as he and the driver of the boat are making their way towards the boat. Rex wakes up as Adriana is getting her purse to leave. When he turns his back on her, she grabs the lamp and clocks him in the head with it."

        "Rex: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Adriana: Then again, we're not supposed to have secrets, are we? All right, Rex. What are you hiding from me? What don't you want me to know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, I can see. Can you believe it? I can see!",
        "Cristian: Really?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. You're wearing a black shirt. Right?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, right.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, and you -- you have on black jeans and black boots, right?",
        "Cristian: Wow, yeah, that's --",
        "Evangeline: I told you. I really can see! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!",
        "Cristian: I'm going to get dr. Simmons, ok? He should probably look at you.",
        "Evangeline: No. Don't go, not yet. Just stay and let me look at you. You're the most beautiful sight I've ever seen in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Starr? [Todd whistles] Starr?",
        "Starr: Dad.",
        "Todd: Hey. [Todd chuckles] Well, hey --",
        "Starr: Thanks for coming.",
        "Todd: You sounded upset on the phone.",
        "Starr: It's mom.",
        "Todd: What about her? Something happen?",
        "Starr: She's not coming home tonight -- again.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. Why, did she leave you and Jack here alone?",
        "Starr: No. Dorian's in her room. Jack and I are fine. It's just mom's been spending a lot of time with Spencer lately, and I'm starting to get worried. I'm afraid that mom might do something crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Look, Bo, I am so sorry Todd showed up when he did. I didn't even know he knew that place.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, we got to be more careful, Blair, because if Todd finds out what you're doing, then he's going to go straight for Truman.",
        "Blair: I know. It's like the walls are closing in. Every minute that goes by gives Spencer more time to cover himself. I mean, it has to be tonight. I have to find out where Spencer stashed that gun that he used to shoot John McBain's father. And I'm going to do it, Bo. I'm going to do it for you. I'm not going to let you down, ok",
        "Bo: All right, but you remember that I'm working unofficially on this. If you come across anything at all, you take it to John. And if you get the slightest inkling that Spencer's on to you, you get out of there. Now, you got that?",
        "Blair: No, Bo. I have to see this through to the end. I'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure Spencer's put away for what he did to Todd. He's gotten away with it way too long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Can I talk to you for a minute? I -- I need to talk to you. Look, I know you think Spencer shot your father. And I also know that doesn't absolve me of responsibility for my part in his death. But, John, I want you to know that I'm paying for it. I lost my job, I lost my medical license. And I'm paying with the guilt that I feel every day and will feel for the rest of my life.",
        "John: What is it you want, Paige? And don't mention the word \"forgiveness.\"",
        "Paige: No, I don't -- I don't expect that. But I do want us to try to find a way to peacefully coexist in this town, not for my sake but for Bo's sake. He cares about both of us. And if there's any way that I can help you with Spencer, I will.",
        "John: All right, maybe there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair and Spencer: Hey.",
        "Spencer: Come in. I'm kind of surprised to see you. I didn't think you'd be able to make it for sure. I guess it's my lucky night, huh?",
        "Blair: No, actually, I think it's going to be my lucky night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm afraid she might marry Spencer.",
        "Todd: Hmm. What makes you say that? Did he ask her?",
        "Starr: I don't know. They're not engaged or anything. It's just mom's been spending a lot of time with Spencer. Even tonight, when I needed her the most, she chose him over me.",
        "Todd: Oh. Yeah, well, don't worry about that, honey. I mean, even if they get married, I'm -- I'm not going to let you live with him. I promise you that.",
        "Starr: I want to come home and live with you now.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. You will. So, why'd you want to talk to her, anyway? I thought you guys weren't speaking.",
        "Starr: I just need to talk to a woman.",
        "Todd: Oh. Ok. I -- I can't help you there, can I? Is there anything that -- that you feel comfortable enough to talk to me about?",
        "Starr: It's Ricky.",
        "Todd: Oh, a boyfriend.",
        "Starr: He's not my boyfriend. He likes Langston.",
        "Todd: He likes Langston over you? What, is he crazy?",
        "Starr: You're just saying that because you're my dad.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. It's a fact. Look at you -- you're gorgeous. You're a -- you're a peach, you're a prize. So what about Ricky?",
        "Starr: He's moving to Puerto Rico, like tomorrow. And he gave me his email address -- me, not Langston, who I thought that he liked. But why should I even care? I mean, I'm probably never going to see him again.",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Starr: Dad? Am I completely crazy for caring about someone who left me in the dust for someone else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: I have a surprise for you.",
        "Blair: You do?",
        "Spencer: Come in and sit down. I got to show you something. Come here.",
        "Blair: Wow. House plans.",
        "Spencer: Yeah.",
        "Blair: What is this?",
        "Spencer: A floor plan for a house up on Longfellow Road. It's four bedrooms. It's got a huge playroom for Jack. He can set up his entire train set in there. It has a large office for the two of us. It's got plenty of room in the back for a pool or -- or whatever. It's --",
        "Blair: Wow, Spencer, did you -- did you buy this for us?",
        "Spencer: No, not yet, not until you have a chance to look at it, first thing in the morning, all right? And if you like it, of course, then I'll put in an offer on it.",
        "Blair: Ok, I'm -- I don't even know what to say.",
        "Spencer: Well, just say you'll take a look at it. That's all you have to do, Blair.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah. Ok. Wow. This is really something else, you know? It -- when I was a little girl, I lived in foster home after foster home after foster home, and I always dreamed of living in a beautiful house like this.",
        "Spencer: Well, if you like it, if you want it, it's yours. You hear me?",
        "Blair: It makes me think about you, too, Spencer -- you know, your background and how you ended up being the man you are.",
        "Spencer: Ahem. Well, I was very fortunate.",
        "Blair: Yeah. And brilliant, I might add. Smart. I bet some of those guys you worked with weren't that lucky, though, huh? That Lonny guy --",
        "Spencer: Lenny.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Spencer: Lenny.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Whatever happened to him?",
        "Spencer: You know, I'm sorry, Lenny. You're going to have to disappear -- permanently. So why all the interest in my old cohorts all of a sudden?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: What is it? What can I do to help?",
        "John: On the night you operated on my father, do you remember -- did he say anything?",
        "Paige: I'm sorry, no. He was already under anesthesia by the time I saw him. He -- he never regained consciousness.",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "John: Hey, boss. Uh -- can I get you something from the bar or --",
        "Bo: You know, a cup of coffee would be great.",
        "John: Coffee.",
        "Bo: Thanks.",
        "John: You got it.",
        "Paige: Hey.",
        "Bo: Hey. How'd it go with Nora? Any luck?",
        "Paige: Well, she's tough, but I think we made some progress. You know, right now, Matthew -- he's so incredible. He's the best medicine for her, and she miraculously agreed to have a nurse, tomorrow morning.",
        "Bo: Glad to hear it.",
        "Paige: Oh. So, what did you want to see me about?",
        "Bo: Um -- I just wanted to know if maybe you knew this guy right here -- maybe from when you were married Spencer. Now, this is a known forger who did some work for Spencer back in the days.",
        "Paige: This is the guy you think helped Spencer set you up?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah, but now we can't locate him.",
        "Paige: Spencer was always really careful to keep all the different part of his life separate, you know? After what happened to John's father, our marriage completely fell apart. We never talked about the shooting once Spencer sent David out of the country. You know, I'm -- I'm going to get a bite to eat.",
        "Bo: Ok. I'll talk to you later.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Bo: Lenny's place was picked clean, John. There's no known associates. The guy's in the wind.",
        "John: I got people at the airport, the bus station, the train station, all the rental car places. This guy's not going to slip through our fingers.",
        "Bo: I hope not. I don't care how hard a guy tries to disappear, chances are he'll be found eventually.",

        "[Rex groans]",
        "Adriana: All right. Oh. So? Rex already told me he's doing research on stalkers. I must be out of my mind. How could I not trust Rex after everything he's done for me?",
        "Adriana's voice: \"Dear Rex, when you find this, know that I'm thinking about you. Thanks for keeping me safe. I love you. A.\"",
        "[Computer beeps]",
        "Adriana: Oh, my God. No. - It's good. Terrific.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Tell me this is real. Tell me I'm not dreaming.",
        "Cristian: That was real.",
        "Evangeline: Oh. God, you look so good!",
        "Cristian: Hmm.",
        "Evangeline: I was so sure the surgery didn't work and that I was going to be blind for the rest of my life, but I was going to be ok with that.",
        "Cristian: No, you weren't. You were just doing a good job faking it.",
        "Evangeline: No. I was doing a terrible job of faking it. But I was trying. I was trying to get used to the idea of living my life in a new way. But a miracle has happened to me.",
        "Cristian: That's right. It's the miracle I was praying for.",
        "Evangeline: Me, too. And I have one man to thank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If a person, uh, can't see the truth standing right in front of them, then to hell with them. Right? I mean, he -- he doesn't deserve your love. Now, she -- she made her choice. She's going to have to live with it.",
        "Starr: \"She\"? I thought we were talking about Ricky.",
        "Todd: Ricky, yeah.",
        "Starr: So I should forget about Ricky the way you forgot about mom?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Starr: But you didn't forget about her. Did you? Dad?",
        "Todd: Huh?",
        "Starr: I hate mom for what she did to you. And I can't stand the sight of mom and Spencer together. But I can forgive her if you could.",
        "Todd: Well, sweetheart --",
        "Starr: I -- know that it'll probably never happen again, but the time that I was happiest in my life was when we were all together as a family. Do you think that we could ever be like that again? Is there anything mom could do to make it up to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm not interested in Lenny. I'm interested in you. I want to know so much about you, like just what made you the man you are today. You know, we're alike in a lot of ways, Spencer. You know that, don't you? We're both survivors. I mean, look at you. You were an outsider and you made it into mainstream, and that's just one of the things that I love about you most. That's why I want to know about all those guys that you worked with, because I want to know about you. I want to know about Lenny, Harry, Bluto --",
        "Spencer: Bluto?",
        "Blair: Yeah, Bluto.",
        "Spencer: There's no Bluto.",
        "Blair: Oh, there's no Bluto? Oh, too bad. It's a good name, though.",
        "Spencer: Yeah.",
        "Blair: I just -- I want to know, like, who your favorite teacher was and what the happiest day of your life was. That's what I want to know. And I want you to know all those things about me.",
        "Spencer: Ok.",
        "Blair: Ok?",
        "Spencer: Actually, I do know what happened to some of the old gang as a matter of fact.",
        "Blair: You do?",
        "Spencer: Mm-hmm. Yeah, like --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Spencer: I mean, for instance, Rudy the book, you know? He -- he stole some money that he was supposed to put down on a bet for a client, and -- well, he was dealt with.",
        "Blair: Dealt with? How?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, yeah. Well, details aren't important.",
        "Blair: Oh, my -- yeah.",
        "Spencer: Let's just say that he never made that mistake again.",
        "Blair: Well, Spencer, I'm really glad that you're not in that line of work anymore.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Spencer: I'd probably be in a cemetery somewhere -- or in prison, you know. Of course, Lenny seemed to do quite well for himself.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Spencer: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: Why? Where is he?",
        "Spencer: Oh, he's -- he's around. He -- had a couple of good scores, made some nice investments. In fact, he lives right here in Llanview. Right up near Llantano mountain, those condos up there, you know, off Long Acre.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: No. No, it can't be.",
        "Rex: What are you doing? Zero calls, to anyone.",
        "Adriana: He could've hurt me more than once, but he didn't.",
        "Rex: That doesn't seem to be his thing.",
        "Adriana: Yeah. It's more like he wants to possess me. Have me all to himself. How long are we going to have to stay here, Rex? All alone, cut off from the rest of the world?",
        "Rex: As far as I'm concerned, we can stay forever.",
        "Adriana: Oh, my god. Rex is the stalker.",
        "Rex: What are you doing?",
        "Adriana: I'm getting out of here.",
        "Rex: No, no -- no way. I'm not letting you leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I think there's only one way I could ever forgive your mom.",
        "Starr: What's that?",
        "Todd: Well, I think she'd have to build a time machine, see, and then she'd have to go back in time. And she'd have to do everything she did differently. She'd have to believe in me and trust me and see me for who I really am, and see Spencer for who he really is. Then maybe I could let this go, but -- I don't think time travel's possible now, do you? Of all the men in the world she could be with, she chooses the one I hate the most.",
        "Starr: Dad, mom doesn't love Spencer.",
        "Todd: That's irrelevant. And her feelings -- just none of my business anymore, anyway.",
        "Starr: I know things have changed, dad. But I can't get used to mom being with Spencer. And I can't imagine you with anybody but mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Sure, I understand. Todd got you the surgery, so, I mean -- you owe him your sight.",
        "Evangeline: Todd?",
        "Cristian: Isn't that who you were talking about?",
        "Evangeline: Todd made the surgery happen, and I'll always be grateful to him, not to mention the fact that I owe him a huge pile of cash. But I was talking about Dr. Simmons. He's the one that performed the surgery. But I'm more grateful to you than anyone.",
        "Cristian: Really? How's that?",
        "Evangeline: Well, you taught me to see the world in a way that I never had before. And you loved me. And it didn't matter whether or not I could see. And you made things all right for me. But it's going to be even better now because I've been given the most amazing gift, and I'm never going to take it for granted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: I never got a chance to tell you how happy I am that you're free.",
        "David: Yeah. How about that, huh? I've been living for 25 years with massive guilt, and I didn't do anything. Well, nothing fatal, anyway.",
        "Paige: Wow. I wish I could say the same thing. And I wish there weren't so many unanswered questions.",
        "David: Yeah, like how we're going to get back at Spencer for torturing us all these years.",
        "Paige: You know, I don't even care anymore about getting back at him. I just want John and Michael to find some peace, and I want Bo to be cleared of all the charges and to get his job back.",
        "David: Well, if you want all that, we're going to have to nail Spencer. So it looks like you and I want the same thing.",
        "Paige: I guess we do. We just might hold the key that will make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Spencer had to have started planning his part in all of this way before that. He's covered every detail.",
        "John: He blackmailed Paige and Vickers, set up Manning, framed you in the process. Probably had a fail-safe for every contingency.",
        "Bo: Yeah. He can anticipate how people are going to react to any given situation. He knew that Manning would meet Margaret down at the lake. He knew that Paige would keep quiet to protect me.",
        "John: So maybe we approach this like a profiler would.",
        "Bo: Think like he thinks.",
        "John: Hmm. He's proactive. That we know. All right? He foresees potential obstacles, and he eliminates them before they become a problem.",
        "Bo: Well, I think Lenny's our next step.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Bo: We need Lenny to admit that Spencer hired him to forge my signature. We have to do that before Spencer knows what we're up to.",
        "John: And what would Truman do to someone who's got the goods on him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Mmm.",
        "Spencer: What?",
        "Blair: You know what I feel like?",
        "Spencer: What?",
        "Blair: I feel like those gourmet chocolate chip cookies that they sell downstairs.",
        "Spencer: Oh, I don't --",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Spencer: I'll take you out and get some dessert if you want.",
        "Blair: No. No, no, no, no, no. I'll go down. I'll run down and get us some, ok? Be right back.",
        "Spencer: All right.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Spencer: If that's what you want.",
        "Blair: That's what I want! Be right back. Oh, man.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: McBain.",
        "Blair: Hey, John. It's me, Blair. I got Spencer talking.",
        "John: And?",
        "Blair: Well, I didn't find anything out about the gun, but I did find out something about Lenny. The guy, he lives up on Llantano mountain in a condo complex up there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Just get up to the condos on Long Acre and let me know if any cops show up, especially John McBain and Bo Buchanan. You got it? No, no, no, don't do anything. Just let me know if any cops show up there. I've set a trap. If they take the bait, I'll handle it from here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Spencer just came out and told you where Lenny is?",
        "Blair: No, John, I got him to open up about his past, just like you suggested.",
        "John: It's too easy.",
        "Blair: Well, what do you mean?",
        "John: I think he's setting you up. All right, you need to get out of there, Blair, now.",
        "Blair: No. Can't do that, John. We need the gun, and I'm the only way we can get it.",
        "John: Blair got an address in Llanview for Lenny.",
        "Bo: Right here in town.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Bo: Either the guy has decided to hide in plain sight or Spencer's knocking over another obstacle.",
        "John: Hmm. You know, I'm going to have someone at the station fax over Lenny's mug shot to the managing agent over at the property, all right, see if anybody's seen him around, but I'm betting he hasn't come within five miles of that place. And Blair's got to get the hell away from Spencer.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but we can't go after her now without exposing her.",
        "John: Ok. I'm going to put a man outside Spencer's room. You know have him hanging out in the hallway, do some flybys.",
        "Bo: Ok, that's all we can do. I don't like it.",
        "John: Me, either. The longer it takes for us to nail Spencer, the more danger Blair's in.",
        "Blair: Everything all right?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, yeah. Just -- uh, all this talk about my past, you know. Kind of got me thinking about the old man and his very strange code of honor.",
        "Blair: You mean, honor among thieves?",
        "Spencer: Yeah, exactly. You know, take, for instance, what happened to Rudy the book, you know? The old man always used to say there was no crime worse than betrayal. And you know all about betrayal. Don't you, Blair?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know what I feel like doing? I think I'm going to have a little chat with your pal Ricky. I'm going to go ho, I'm going to get my brass knuckles, I'm going to find him --",

        "Todd: And I'm going to have a little talk with him.",
        "Starr: Dad, I am not your little girl anymore, and if you go near Ricky, I will never speak to you again.",
        "Todd: Oh. Really?",
        "Starr: Really.",
        "Todd: Ok. I'm not making any promises about future boyfriends, though.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, don't hold your breath.",
        "Todd: Are you kidding me? Look at your reflection in that pool there. You are gorgeous. You're going to have dozens of boyfriends. You're going to have to beat them away with a stick.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Todd: Feeling better?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I'm better now. You can go home.",
        "Todd: Ok, I'll go home. Give your brother a kiss for me, too, will you?",
        "Starr: Sure.",
        "Todd: I love you both more than anything else in the world. You know that, right?",
        "Starr: I'll make sure that he knows that, too.",
        "Todd: Ok. And don't you worry about men. My gosh. You're going to find the guy that's right for you, the one you're meant to be with. But don't be in a hurry because you're meant to be with me right now. Come on.",
        "Starr: Hey, Dad? Do you think that a person could love more than one person in their life?",
        "Todd: Well, Viki has. And I didn't think it was possible for me, but now I'm not so sure.",

        "Evangeline: I'm going to call my mother. I'm going to call Layla. Then I'm going to call everybody and tell them the good news.",
        "Cristian: Right, and I should probably get the doctor. I think we've waited long enough. I'll be right back.",
        "Evangeline: Cris -- I love you.",
        "Cristian: I love you, too. Ok.",
        "Evangeline: Ok.",

        "Rex: What -- would you please just calm down and tell me what happened?",
        "Adriana: Just let me --",
        "Rex: Did the maniac find -- was he here?",
        "Adriana: Just let me go!",

        "Adriana: I have to get out of here.",
        "Rex: No, no, no, Adriana, you can't go. It's too dangerous.",
        "Adriana: It's a lot more dangerous in here.",
        "Rex: What's going on? Why are you so afraid of me all of a sudden?",
        "Adriana: I just need to get some fresh air.",
        "Rex: Fine. I'm going with you.",
        "Adriana: No!",
        "Rex: Why not?",
        "Adriana: I'm fine. I just, um -- I had a bad dream. That homeless guy you were talking to -- I guess he just really creeped me out, and I don't want to stay here anymore. I want to go home, back to Llanview.",
        "Rex: We can't do that, Adriana, not until this freak is caught.",
        "Adriana: When will that be, Rex?",
        "Rex: I wish I knew. Come on. Let's go back to bed. In the morning we'll figure out what to do next.",
        "Adriana: Look, I'm -- I'm fine. I shouldn't have gotten so worked up over a stupid dream. Could you get me a glass of water?",
        "Rex: That I can do. Just relax, ok?",

        "Blair: Why do you think that I know anything about betrayal, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: Oh, because of Todd. All the times he's lied to you. I mean, you know better than anyone what it's like to have someone you love turn on you and put a knife in your back.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Todd, he -- he betrayed me so many times. He lied to me. That's why I know I could never be with him -- even though I know he didn't kill Margaret. But you would never lie to me, would you, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: And you would never lie to me, would you, Blair?",
        "Blair: Never.",

        "John: Thanks for looking into it. You were right. No one at those condos has ever laid eyes on Lenny. Truman was testing Blair again.",
        "Bo: Which means that her cover is not blown yet, but Truman's getting suspicious.",
        "John: We'll nail him. Like you said, he can't hide forever. So, you and Paige, you -- you working things out?",
        "Bo: We're trying. You know, John, she's a good woman who just made a horrible mistake years ago. What are you thinking?",
        "John: I was thinking about something that Paige said earlier about Truman sending Vickers out of the country.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Look, I know there might be something that you overlooked that you still -- that you still haven't remembered.",
        "David: No, Paige, I've thought about this a million times. How many times are the cops going to grill me about it?",
        "John: Once more. I need to talk to you about the night of the shooting.",
        "David: I should start selling tickets.",
        "John: What happened after my father went down?",
        "David: John, I dropped the gun, I think I kicked it, and then I got the hell out of there.",
        "John: No, no, after. Paige said something about Truman getting you out of the country. How?",
        "David: He sent me to Venezuela. Which was fine by me. I wanted to get as far away as possible.",
        "Bo: But how did you actually leave Atlantic City?",
        "David: Spencer paid some guy to take me from New Jersey to Manhattan on a boat.",

        "John: Ok, keep me updated. The guys are on their way down to the docks right now. I'm thinking this Lenny -- I'm thinking he might want to take a more covert route. Where can you hire those private boats? Is that -- is that down at, what, pier 48?",
        "Bo: Yeah, let's get down there.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Here you go. Look, I know you're nervous and scared and everything, but it's going to be ok, all right? We're here, nobody knows that we're here. The beach is amazing. You're beautiful. Everything's going to be ok.",

        "Starr: Hey, Langston? It's Starr. Nothing, just hanging around my house. Yeah. Are you sure that's safe to do this time of night? Yeah -- no, I'm not scared! I'll go. I'm sure my mom won't even notice that I'm gone. Yeah I'll meet you there. Ok, bye.",

        "Cristian: Why don't you close your eyes for a while? Come on, you heard the doc. This isn't temporary. You will be able to see tomorrow. You don't have to take in everything all at once.",
        "Evangeline: Hmm. I want to stay up all night and look at you. The whole time I was blind, in my mind I could still see colors and art and beauty all because of you. You helped me see what I couldn't. I'm never going to forget that.",

        "Spencer: All right. Thanks for calling.",
        "Blair: What was that about?",
        "Spencer: Oh, it was just some very good news about a patient I've been seeing. I was starting to worry that I might lose her. But as it turns out, everything's going to be just fine. I won't have to take extreme measures.",
