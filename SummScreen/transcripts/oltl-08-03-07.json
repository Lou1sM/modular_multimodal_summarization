        "Marcie: Hey, my little man. What are you doing up so late, huh?",
        "Lindsay: I brought him out for ice cream because every time I put him in the crib he started crying.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Did you do that on purpose?",
        "Lindsay: I don't think he wants to go down until Mommy puts him down.",
        "Marcie: Come here, my little sweetheart. Oh, is it true, hmm? Is that true? You know, I don't know what I'd do without you. I don't. You're the only baby Mommy's ever going to have.",
        "Lindsay: Marcie, have you given up on more kids because you can't have one of your own?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on in. Hey.",
        "Michael: Hey. Listen, Johnny, Marcie's in a meeting, Lindsay's watching Tommy and I'm pretty sure she wants to go home.",
        "John: Let's get it done. Sit down.",
        "Michael: What's so important, John?",
        "John: Well, I have some questions for you -- about Truman's murder.",
        "Michael: Didn't we already do that?",
        "John: We're doing it again.",
        "Michael: Why?",
        "John: Look, I threw you and Balsom in a cell because I knew there was something you weren't telling me. It's connected to the murder, isn't it?",
        "Michael: I already told you everything I remember about that night.",
        "John: Mike, no one's going home until you tell me what you're holding back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "Antonio: Hey.",
        "Bartender: What can I get you?",
        "Bo: Ah -- I think I'll have what he's having.",
        "Bartender: No problem.",
        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Bo: You know what? I -- I just hate when they say that. Of course, it's no problem -- you know, it's the guy's job.",
        "Antonio: It seems like you're in the same kind of mood I am.",
        "Bo: Paige left town.",
        "Antonio: I'm sorry. Nash and Jessica -- they got married.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I know. I was at the wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Nora gasps]",
        "Nora: There she is.",
        "Talia: Hey. What's up? I got a call from your office to meet you down here when I got off duty.",
        "Nora: Yeah, that was kind of a ruse.",
        "Talia: A what?",
        "Layla: When a woman saves our lives, we think we ought to buy that woman a drink. Right?",
        "Adriana: Right.",
        "Talia: Oh --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why can't -- while your dad was missing, I had you guys all to myself, and now that he's back, it's time for me to share, so --",
        "Jack: It's not as much fun without you.",
        "Blair: Well, I appreciate that, Jack, but --",
        "Todd: All right, how about this -- how about Mom sticks around while we watch a movie or whatever we're going to do tonight, and then when it's bedtime, she goes home to Dorian's place and makes sure Dorian doesn't freak out? Is that going to be ok with you, sir?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Todd: And you, Mom?",
        "Blair: Yes, Dad, that's fine with me.",
        "Todd: Ok. Uh -- let's see. What should we have for dinner? It's a special night. Well, I know what you're having. I think you want two helpings of spinach --",
        "Blair: Mmm.",
        "Todd: And for dessert, maybe some green collard beans.",
        "Starr: Yum.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: Let's have pizza and popcorn.",
        "Todd: Oh -- ugh.",
        "Starr: \"Pizza and popcorn\"?",
        "Blair: Spinach and green beans.",
        "Starr: What is wrong with this kid?",
        "Blair: Pizza and popcorn?",
        "Jack: And -- and I want to build a fort --",
        "Todd: Oh --",
        "Jack: In the living room, and stay up after midnight.",
        "Todd: [As drill sergeant] All right. Private Manning, you will do reconnaissance! You get the blankets and sheets in this house! Do you understand me?",
        "Jack: Yes, sir!",
        "Todd: Good! Go! Move! Move, hog, move!",
        "Starr: Dad! Calm down.",
        "Blair: You're going to hurt yourself.",
        "Todd: [Normal voice] I don't think I'm going to be able to move this furniture back and forth.",
        "Blair: Well, you're not going to move this furniture, Starr and I will do it for you.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you know what? But, first, I'm going to help Jack, and then I'll come down and help, but thank you.",
        "Todd: For what?",
        "Starr: For letting Mom stay.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Thanks.",
        "Todd: It's what the kid wanted.",
        "Blair: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Please, just hear me out, all right? I'm not here to upset you.",
        "Marty: I confessed to what I did so I would never have to see you again.",
        "Miles: You don't want to be in here. What would you say if I could get you out of this? Don't you want to be with Cole?",
        "Marty: I plan to plead guilty, and to my knowledge, they don't let confessed murderers out on bail. Marty do you really remember killing Spencer?",
        "Marty: I don't remember actually stabbing him, but I know I must have.",
        "Miles: There are no witnesses. There's no way they can prove you did it.",
        "Marty: There doesn't -- there doesn't need to be, ok? I confessed.",
        "Miles: Yeah, but a lawyer could get that confession thrown out, and I will pay for the best one there is.",
        "Marty: You know, just forget it, ok?",
        "Miles: You would rather sit in prison than accept help from me?",
        "Marty: Yeah. I would rather do that than owe you anything.",
        "Miles: You wouldn't -- there are no strings attached. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You went to Jessica and Nash's wedding and you didn't tell me?",
        "Bo: Come on, Antonio, you know it wasn't my place to tell you. I mean, I may not like everything Jess does, but she's still my niece.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Bo: And you know the circumstances -- she thought she was dying. Thanks.",
        "Antonio: Let me get another shot.",
        "Bartender: No problem.",
        "Antonio: You're right, it is irritating. You know, this wedding -- look, I don't even want to talk about it. It is what it is.",
        "Bo: Ah. I'm not really sure that getting smashed is the right thing to do, though, because you're only operating on about 3/4 of a liver.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, you got a point.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm. And, Antonio, everybody knows that you did everything you could for Jess.",
        "Antonio: Mm-hmm, but it still wasn't enough. Hey, look, Bo, you don't have to worry about me, man, I didn't come here to drown my sorrows. Jamie's staying at my mother's tonight, I -- I just didn't know what to do with myself.",
        "Bo: All right. I know all about that. Matthew's at Nora's -- I get him on the weekend.",
        "Antonio: I didn't even know that you and Paige were having problems.",
        "Bo: Do you want to hear something funny? Neither did I.",
        "Antonio: Uh -- so, what -- what happened? Oh, you don't have to tell me.",
        "Bo: No, it's ok, it's all right. It's -- after she lost her son, you know, she just felt lost, and she'd put him up for adoption right after he was born so that Truman wouldn't know that he had a son. Then when she finally found Hugh again and she got to know him, all of a sudden -- bang there was that accident. And she sat with him for weeks at a time and it was the wrong man. You know, here she thought that she had a second chance, but it was the wrong man, and when she found that out, everything just came crashing in on her. So I think she wanted to get just as far away as she possibly could from here, and then throw herself right into her career, her profession, so she -- she took a position with Doctors Without Borders.",
        "Antonio: Well, do you think she'll come back?",
        "Bo: I don't know.",
        "Antonio: Well, if it's any consolation, at least you know that it was her problems that came between the two of you.",
        "Bo: Well, you had the same thing with you and Jess, right?",
        "Antonio: No. Well, I mean, I thought it was. But I think she just fell in love with another guy.",
        "Rex: Hey, guys.",
        "Bo: Balsom.",
        "Rex: These two don't pay for anything when I'm here.",
        "Bo: Did you hit the lottery or something?",
        "Rex: Better -- Adriana and I are back together. You're looking at a happy guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: This really isn't necessary, I was just doing my job.",
        "Nora: I believe the police have a thing called \"conduct above and beyond\"? Yeah.",
        "Talia: Yeah, but that doesn't --",
        "Adriana: No \"buts.\" Tate was out of his mind. Rex and I would be dead if it wasn't for you.",
        "Layla: So would Vincent and I.",
        "Vincent: They ought to give you a medal.",
        "Talia: I'll settle for Tate being off the streets.",
        "Layla: Hmm, I wish Vange could be here. She should be celebrating with us, you know?",
        "Nora: Honey, miracles happen, ok? Remember, she's a fighter.",
        "Layla: That's right.",
        "Adriana: Rex kept trying to tell me that there was something off about Tate, and I just wouldn't listen.",
        "Layla: Well, I mean, everybody looked up to him, he was a baseball star.",
        "Vincent: Big deal.",
        "Layla: Yeah, I know.",
        "Nora: We have to stop confusing success with character.",
        "Adriana: Amen, I'll drink to that.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Talia: I think Vincent is the real hero.",
        "Vincent: I'm nobody's hero.",
        "Talia: Well, somebody in the same position might've let him die just to get even, so --",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Vincent: I should've let him die.",
        "Layla: You did what was right, Vincent.",
        "Nora: You both did.",
        "Vincent: Look, ladies, you know, I'm starting to feel like a rooster at a hen party, you know what I mean?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Layla: Excuse me?",
        "Vincent: My tab. Order anything that you want, ok? Enjoy yourselves. I'll see you later.",
        "Layla: Ok. Excuse me, ladies.",
        "Nora: Think that man is hot.",
        "[Adriana laughs]",
        "Layla: Vincent? Are you ok?",
        "Vincent: I'm good. I'm fine. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Nora: How are you and Layla handling the fallout from the other night?",
        "Adriana: Oh, we've both had our crying jags and been having some trouble.",
        "Nora: Oh, I can imagine.",
        "Adriana: But Rex has been there to help me feel better.",
        "Talia: Are you two back together?",
        "Adriana: I couldn't be happier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Look, John, I don't know what you're getting at here, ok? Rex and I aren't keeping any secrets. And as far as Spencer Truman's murder is concerned, I was pretty sure that was over. Didn't Marty Saybrooke already confess?",
        "John: She's in custody, but there's a lot of questions.",
        "Michael: Oh. And you don't believe she did it? What do you want me to tell you, John?",
        "John: How about the truth?",
        "Michael: About what?",
        "John: Mike, you and Balsom both know something, and it's big.",
        "Michael: Rex and I suspected each other of being Spencer Truman's killer, John. That's all there is between us.",
        "John: Cut the crap, Mike.",
        "Michael: Listen, there is no big secret. You can ask Rex, he'll tell you the same thing. Johnny, I understand you want to clear Marty, but I can't help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Marcie?",
        "Marcie: I just don't want to talk about it, ok?",
        "Lindsay: Have you told Michael?",
        "Marcie: Yes, I have, and it was absolutely awful.",
        "Lindsay: So why are you saying that there aren't going to be any more children?",
        "Marcie: I don't know. I'm just -- it feels that way to me. You know, Michael wants to talk to the doctors and look at all the records, but it's pointless.",
        "Lindsay: So he hasn't fully accepted it?",
        "Marcie: No. He's having a hard time, and to be honest, I really don't know how to handle it.",
        "Lindsay: Well, when you think about it, you've known about this and you've had time to process it, and for him, it's new news. You know, he -- he hasn't had the time. So, is there -- is there something else that's wrong?",
        "Marcie: Remember I was telling you that every time I talk about Tommy or I bring up how lucky we are to have him, you know, Mike gets really weird. Well, it's happening now it's just getting worse.",
        "Lindsay: I think I know the reason why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Mike, this is the -- the log kept by Truman's guards at the hospital.",
        "Michael: Yeah? What's your point?",
        "John: Well, according to this, you saw Truman on the day he was supposed to be transferred.",
        "Michael: I was the resident on duty.",
        "John: It says here you were in the room for 45 minutes.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "John: Why?",
        "Michael: I was doing my job?",
        "John: Ok. Well, immediately after, you signed out of work.",
        "Michael: You've been a very busy boy, haven't you, John?",
        "John: Where'd you go, Mike?",
        "Michael: I don't remember.",
        "John: Did you see Balsom?",
        "Michael: Why are you doing this?",
        "John: You know why, Mike. Tell me what's going on before you're in too deep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: All right, ready for our first mission? It's time to go in there and have some fun. Let's go, move, move, move!",
        "Blair: Ok, wait, wait, wait! Take this rations with you. It's got to hold you till backup arrives.",
        "[Starr laughs]",
        "Jack: Did you get the pepperoni?",
        "Blair: What do you think? Ok, go, move!",
        "Todd: Starr, hold up, hold up. Your mom says I have to watch this.",
        "Starr: No, not that. No, not that! Give it to me.",
        "Todd: What is it?",
        "Blair: It's Starr's musical.",
        "Todd: Oh, really?",
        "Starr: Mom, I really don't want him to see it.",
        "Blair: No, come on, it's great!",
        "Todd: Hey, Jack?",
        "[Todd grunts]",
        "Todd: I know what we're watching on TV tonight.",
        "Jack: No way.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah. I tell you what, I'll make you a deal. You watch this with us tonight, you get to choose the next movie, even if it's PG-13.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Jack, you really don't have to watch it, it's ok.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes, we do. Yes, we do. Throw this in the machine.",
        "Starr: Do I have to?",
        "Blair: Yep.",
        "Starr: You guys stink.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Starr: There. Are you happy now?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marcie's voice: I want to thank you all for coming tonight for the first, all- original, Llanview High Musical!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So, I heard Jessica married Nash.",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Rex: You're not going to take off again, are you?",
        "Antonio: No, it is what it is. My life's about Jamie now and my job.",
        "Bo: Good luck with that.",
        "Antonio: I mean it.",
        "Bo: No, I know you do, and I'm saying good luck with it. And I'll tell you, if you ever find yourself -- you're all alone at night, you don't know what to do with yourself because you're boring the heck out of yourself, you know where I live.",
        "Rex: You're Adriana's big brother, you can always hang with us.",
        "Antonio: Well, I appreciate that, so long as I don't have to talk about my feelings.",
        "Bo: No kidding.",
        "Rex: Yeah, what's up with that?",
        "Bo: \"What's up with that,\" Balsom? That's like when you used to come and talk to me about Adriana.",
        "Rex: Not anymore. Everything is \"so\" good.",
        "Antonio: Hey, could we just change the subject?",
        "Bo: Oh, how about those daggum Red Sox, huh?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Vincent: At least they have pitching.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Nora: So you and Vincent back together again?",
        "Layla: Uh-huh. He came to the hospital that awful night Vange got hurt. He never left my side, and I forgot about being mad and remembered all the things that I loved about him.",
        "Adriana: Why do you think he really left tonight?",
        "Layla: Because we were talking about Tate.",
        "Talia: Yeah, I could tell he got uncomfortable when I called him a hero.",
        "Layla: He doesn't feel good about saving Tate's life.",
        "Talia: Well, he did the right thing, but I get it. If Tate had flown off the roof when I shot him, I wouldn't have shed a tear.",
        "Nora: Yeah, but that's -- that's different than looking someone right in the eye and giving them a death sentence.",
        "Layla: Yeah, I know -- that's what I told him, but I don't think it worked. I just wish I could make it stop bothering him.",
        "Nora: Well, why don't you distract him a little bit?",
        "Adriana: You are bad tonight.",
        "Nora: What? What'd I say? Get him a book, go to a movie.",
        "Bartender: This is compliments of Mr. Jones.",
        "Nora: Oh, the timing is perfect.",
        "Layla: Oh, wow! Wow, ok. To Mr. Jones.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. Ok.",
        "Talia: No, to Tate being behind bars, where he belongs.",
        "Adriana: To bad times being over.",
        "Nora: To brave and beautiful women like Talia.",
        "Layla: Mmm.",
        "Bartender: I'd drink to that.",
        "Layla: Um, I think you have an admirer.",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Talia: What are you talking about?",
        "Adriana: Oh, are you serious?",
        "Nora: My God, you've been in the squad room too long.",
        "Adriana: He was totally flirting with you.",
        "Talia: Oh, ok. Um, I didn't -- I didn't even notice.",
        "Layla: Hmm, why? Are you with someone?",
        "Talia: No.",
        "Nora: Well, do you want to be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Of course I don't want to go to prison, Miles. But, you know, when you say \"no strings,\" you never mean it.",
        "Miles: You need help.",
        "Marty: I have help.",
        "Miles: What, from who, John McBain? He stood back and let you get arrested.",
        "Marty: There was nothing he could've done.",
        "Miles: Sure he has this notion of justice. All I want is to see you free.",
        "Marty: I killed a man.",
        "Miles: There's a big difference between innocence and being found not guilty.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I -- I heard that's how you plead today.",
        "Miles: Yeah, because I have a good lawyer -- he got me out on bail, which no one thought would happen.",
        "Marty: Well, you might as well enjoy your freedom now because it's only temporary.",
        "Miles: There is no connection between me and what happened to Todd Manning.",
        "Marty: What about what you did to me?",
        "Miles: You're my wife. You won't be compelled to testify. And if you did, my lawyer would say it's hearsay -- your word against mine. You're a confessed murderer. That tilts the scales decidedly in my direction. Marty, let me help you. My lawyer can take this case over, and you won't spend another night in jail. Just say the word.",
        "Marty: You know, there is something I want from you.",
        "Miles: Name it.",
        "Marty: An annulment.",
        "Miles: Never.",
        "Marty: Hmm. Well, since you, you know, seem to know so much about the legal system, you know I don't need your permission. And even your sleazy, overpaid lawyer -- he can't do anything to stop me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What are you going to do, John, hmm? You going to shine a light in my eyes, huh? You going to -- you going to sweat me until I break, huh? No, I got a better idea -- maybe you can arrest me and throw me in a cell like you did last time.",
        "[John sighs]",

        "Michael: Yeah. And you know that Rex didn't kill Truman.",
        "John: Why are you so anxious to protect him?",

        "Marcie: Is there something you're not telling me?",
        "Lindsay: No. It's just that I know other adoptive parents, and it seems like the thing that they're afraid of the most is that the adoption is going to be contested, and then the child they love so much is going to be taken away from them.",
        "Marcie: No, no. Not us. Not anymore, anyway. I know that we went through that in the beginning. But we've had Tommy for over a year now, and nothing has happened.",
        "Lindsay: Well, maybe Michael just doesn't trust that yet, and that's why he's pushing you to have your own children.",
        "Marcie: No. No, you know what I think it is? I think it's that whole male thing. You know what I'm talking about? How they get that urge to, like, carry on the whole family gene pool? I think that's what it is. No, I -- I don't know, to be honest. I -- it's not that Michael doesn't love Tommy any less than -- or any more than he would our own kid. It's just different, you know? It just is.",
        "Lindsay: You know, in time, he'll get past this.",
        "Marcie: I hope you're right.",
        "Lindsay: I know so. Because I know he loves you and Tommy more than anything in the world. And look, he just found out that he's not going to be able to have a biological child, ok? That's probably something that he takes for granted, like most people do. So just give him time to mourn that loss, and before you know it, you'll be adopting enough kids to start a baseball team. Trust me, I know these things.",

I don't know anything about what Marty Saybrooke did that night. She's a nice woman, John. And if I could help her, I swear to you, I would. But I can't. I got nothing for you. I'm leaving.
