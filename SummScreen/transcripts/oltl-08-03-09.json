        "Nora stalls for a long time at the wedding. And everybody knows the reason why. AN unseen person appears at Nash Brennan's gravesite and observes the wedding announcement between Jessica and Nash. Stacy tells Rex he has to let her stay in his home if she is pregnant with his child. He tells her he is kicking her out but cannot actually go through with it realizing she may very well be carrying his child. He goes back to Gigi and she knows that he has not thrown Stacy out of his apartment. Schuyler is there for Gigi and Rex is not ok with that. Dorian tells Blair that the two of them are better off alone than with the wrong men. But Blair is not ok with that. A kitten appears out of nowhere. Dorian immediately takes it in and loves it in place of a man. And Blair is very worried what that could mean for both of their futures."

        "Matthew: Look, I'm getting the surgery. I don't care who tries to stop me. I'm gettin' out of this chair.",

        "Dorian: Well, hello, little fella. Wow. You see? He came here. He chose this house of all of the houses because he knows the good life when he sees it. He's cute. Oh, no, don't run away. This is the house you want to live in. This is--ooh, ooh, ooh--La Boulaie. Come, let me show you the inside. It's beautiful. Come on, paw paw. There you are, my little babies. And there you are. Oh. We miss you. Mwah.",

        "Blair: Oh, hoo-hoo, here it is. Oh. [Exhales] Are you ready?",
        "Dorian: Ooh, ooh I just want my voice to be exactly the way it was when I was 45 years old. Come, dear. I was never happier than when I was out doing my singing. Darling, how can you resist this? Oh, the soft shoe is all the rage. And one, and two, and three -- picture you upon my knee, just",
        "Dorian and Blair: T\u00e9a for two and two for T\u00e9a just me for you and you for me alone",

        "Bo: The last few months, you've said a few things about Nora and me getting too close, so I need you to know--",
        "Clint: Bo, she's marrying me today. I think that says it all.",
        "Bo: Okay, but last night, at the party--",
        "Clint: Yeah?",
        "Priest: Excuse me. Mr. Buchanan? Rabbi Rabinowitz and I would like to speak to the grooms.",
        "Clint: Whatever you need, Reverend.",
        "Jared: Well, I was up half the night writing my speech for my dad. You got yours? For your brother?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Classical music playing]",
        "Nora: What about last night?",
        "Viki: I think you were right, about Asa being at the party. He never could keep his opinions to himself.",
        "Nora: No. He'd share them with anybody who'd listen.",
        "Viki: Yeah. He thought that Clint and I belonged together and he thought that you and Bo belonged together. So, for all we know, he was responsible for that awful banner with all the mixed-up names.",
        "Nora: Well, I wouldn't put it past him.",
        "Viki: You know, later on, when Clint and I were looking for candles, we found a wedding gift that Asa had obviously intended to give us way back in 1982 when we were first married. It was a photo album. It was empty. But it--it really brought back memories.",
        "Nora: Viki, are you having second thoughts?",
        "Viki: About Clint? No. No. No, I love Charlie, and I want to marry Charlie. We are exactly the right fit. My point was that memories are just that-- they're memories. And they belong in the past. Charlie is my future. Clint is your future. And believe me, Nora, I wouldn't let my ex-husband marry just anyone. God knows what I would have done if he had proposed to Dorian. But I'm thrilled that he's marrying you.",

        "Destiny: See what I mean? My brother cleans up.",

        "Jessica: Uh, do you think I have enough time to light a candle for Nash before the ceremony?",
        "Natalie: Oh, that's right-- your anniversary just passed.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Just being here at the church--so many things happened here, you know. Weddings and christenings and Nash's funeral. It's the last time I saw his face.",
        "Natalie: Jared and I are so sorry--",
        "Jessica: No. I'm sorry that I tore into you that day. It wasn't your fault. Nash's death was an accident, okay? Nobody blames you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You're throwing me out?",
        "Rex: That's what happens when you play games with my son's life.",
        "Stacy: Shane's fine.",
        "Rex: No thanks to you! Go in and get your stuff and get out.",
        "Rex: But, Rex, I don't have anywhere to go.",
        "Rex: Not my problem.",
        "Stacy: Well, what about your baby? Is he your problem? You're gonna throw him out, too?",
        "Rex: We don't know that I'm the father.",
        "Stacy: Well, who else could it be?",
        "Rex: The cop--Fish. Remember? Your first night in town?",
        "Stacy: Oh, that was one night and it was months ago.",
        "Rex: Stan, from Vegas.",
        "Stacy: I never slept with Stan, thank you.",
        "Rex: But you slept with Schuyler.",
        "Stacy: That was, like, a million years ago, and besides, he's not even interested in me anymore. He's all hot for Gigi, if you didn't know already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Gigi: Come on in.",
        "Schuyler: So, how are you?",
        "Gigi: I'll be better once I find my slip. How are you?",
        "Schuyler: Fine. I was hoping to catch you at the hospital, but you and Rex took off really quickly.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. No point in sticking around. Stacy's pregnant. I mean, who knew she could actually tell the truth about something? Anyway, I have this wedding I gotta get to. Rex and I were supposed to get married. Not today. Eventually, I guess. I mean, that's what two people do, right? When you love each other, and you have a kid. I got this for Rex last year, when everything was still okay. And now it'll never be okay.",
        "Schuyler: Hey, Gigi, what happened? You and Rex break up?",
        "Gigi: No. We're still together. But we'll never be rid of Stacy--she and that kid of hers'll be in our lives forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: This isn't about Gigi. This is about you, and you are not welcome here.",
        "Stacy: Rex, I swear this is your baby. There was no one else, and we had unprotected sex.",
        "Rex: Don't remind me.",
        "Stacy: You loved it. You loved me.",
        "Rex: You let me know when you're far enough along to get a paternity test. We'll do it at the hospital. I'll pay for it. Until then, you're on your own.",
        "Stacy: And what if something happens to this baby? Your baby? Because you threw us out on the street? Is that a risk you're willing to take?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Look at us, Dorian. Did you ever think we'd end up like this?",
        "Dorian: Never give up. We're not finished.",
        "Blair: We're alone.",
        "Dorian: Blair, we have each other.",
        "[Bell rings]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Todd: Anybody home?",
        "Dorian: Who's that?",
        "Blair: Oh. Don't worry, Dorian, darling. I'll take care of it. Who's there?",
        "Todd: Sorry. The door was open.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Todd: I take it you fired the maid.",
        "Blair: Oh, we don't need anybody.",
        "Dorian: Just us chickens here.",
        "Todd: What are you wearing?",
        "Blair: This? Well, you know how I don't like women in skirts, so the best thing is to wear pantyhose or some pants underneath a skirt, so that way you have the pants under a short skirt and you can pull the stockings up over the pants underneath the skirt. Or you could just take the skirt off and use it as a cape.",
        "Todd: Where does that come from?",
        "Blair: Oh, my friend Edie, as she would say, this is a revolutionary costume. [Giggles] Yes, and I have such a great sense of style. Oh, and look at you. You are so handsome. But you never could tie the tie. I knew that you would come back for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: If you would stop fidgeting--",
        "Todd: Ah, I can't help it. This place is like a dentist's office to me. Let me ask you something--why is it when you're at a wedding, you always have to wait for the brides? What is going on? Are they forgetting? They forgot to mark it on their calendar? Where are they?",
        "T\u00e9a: [Giggles] For a man who's been married as many times as you have...",
        "Todd: That was the old Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm liking the new and improved version.",
        "Todd: He's awesome, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Oh, looks like it's about that time.",
        "Bo: Excuse me, Clint. Listen, I gotta talk to you a second, okay?",
        "Natalie: Dad, Charlie, you guys ready?",
        "Charlie: I've been ready since the moment I met your mother.",
        "Clint: And me, I'm forever waiting for Nora. She's my 20-minute girl. Always a crisis at the last moment. She's probably still trying to decide what to wear. But that's my lot in life. Forever waiting for Nora to decide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Nora?",
        "Nora: Did you want to try these earrings?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Viki: You seem very nervous.",
        "Nora: Oh. You know what they say, Viki. Marriage is forever. God, that's a big word.",
        "Nora: The last time I got married--to Daniel Colson--",
        "Viki: Oh, I remember.",
        "Nora: I thought I knew him. I ended up marrying a complete stranger.",
        "Viki: Look, you know Clint. There are no secrets. So, shall we go get married?",
        "Nora: I just have to put one more thing in my hair.",
        "Viki: Okay. I'll see you there.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Nora: Oh, God, Nora, what are you gonna do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I'm telling you right now this is your child. And I'm giving you the chance to do it right. To be there for this child. To help him or her grow up. Is that the way you want to start this relationship? By throwing us out on the street?",
        "[Keys clatter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I'll have to admit, my mother takes her time getting ready, but when she makes up her mind, she sticks to it.",
        "Natalie: Should we maybe go hurry them up? I'm gonna go.",
        "Brody: Is that for Nash?",
        "Jessica: I lit one for Chloe, too. I'm sorry about scaring you, thinking that I saw Nash. I know he's gone.",
        "Brody: I know you do. I also think there was someone there, someone who reminded you of Nash. Which makes sense. I mean, with your anniversary and this wedding today, no surprise he's been on your mind.",
        "Jessica: You don't know how much it means to me--to be able to tell you what I'm thinking, even if it's crazy.",
        "Brody: After what we've been through? I don't think there's anything you could do that'd scare me--and I hope you feel the same way.",
        "Jessica: You know I do.",
        "Brody: All right, we better grab a seat. I got my eye on one of the bridesmaids.",
        "Jessica: So why am I seeing you, Nash, when I know you're at peace?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Look, I'm not saying I need a man. I'm just saying I want a man. Come on, Dorian. Don't you ever, like, miss a man around the house? Somebody to love on you a little bit, yell at you a little bit, and then love on you some more, hmm?",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Ay, dios. But, Blair, really, if it's the wrong man, you're better off alone.",
        "Todd: I didn't come back for you, Blair. I came because Starr said she tried to call and the phone was dead.",
        "Dorian: Bills are such a nuisance.",
        "Blair: How are the children?",
        "Todd: The boys are sailing around the world and Starr seems very happy in New York.",
        "Blair: Oh. I could have gone to New York, you know. They wanted me to make a record. The producer heard me sing at Capricorn, remember?",
        "Todd: Ahem--we've all made our choices.",
        "Blair: And I could've been married, too. I mean, I had so many proposals. There was Asa, Cord, Max, and Sam, Spencer, and John.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd? Oh.",
        "T\u00e9a: What--what is that?",
        "Dorian: It's my portrait. Do you like it?",
        "T\u00e9a: There's a cat going to the bathroom behind it.",

        "Dorian: You can sit on newspapers.",
        "Blair: You know, everything seems to pile up after Labor Day.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no. We won't be staying. I just came to collect Todd. He and I are expected at a soiree this evening.",
        "Dorian: And who is giving a soiree?",
        "T\u00e9a: Charles and Victoria Banks.",
        "Todd: Dorian, people are starting to complain about this place. They want it condemned.",
        "Dorian: What? That would be the most atrocious and horrible thing to ever happen in America. What a nerve.",
        "Todd: I know that you lost everything in that Ponzi scheme, Dorian--that you can't afford to maintain this place. And that's too bad. But you can't live here. There's no A/C.",
        "T\u00e9a: It is rather warm, isn't it?",
        "Todd: There's no running water. And I've been told that Carlotta has stopped making food deliveries because you refuse to pay your bills.",
        "Dorian: Bills are such a nuisance.",
        "Blair: Dorian, darling--",
        "Todd: That's a problem. The fact is that people are beginning to talk. And it's a little embarrassing. And I can't have my ex-wife and her aunt living in squalor like this, so here's what's gonna happen. You're going to sell this place and move into a condo by the lake.",
        "Blair: Oh! Dorian, we can breed ducks. Oh. Won't that be cozy.",
        "Dorian: I will never sell this house.",
        "Todd: But you can't afford to keep it, though, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: The only way that we will ever leave La Boulaie is feet first.",

        "Stacy: I hate milk. Don't tell Rex. But all the books say you need to drink it, so here goes. Ugh. This just proves how much I love him--I'm willing to drink this for you.",
        "[Stacy sighs]",
        "Stacy: I would do anything for you, you know that? Rex'll see that. He'll be so proud of me. And then when we prove you're his, he'll come with us to all your checkups and see your little heartbeat and watch your sonogram. All that time together, we'll just get closer and closer. He'll be so excited, he'll forget all about Gigi. Just watch. We'll live happily ever after-- you, me, and Rex.",

        "Rex: Geeg! What are you doing here?",
        "Schuyler: Just stopped by.",
        "Gigi: Is she gone? Please tell me you threw her out.",
        "Rex: Can we talk about this alone?",
        "Gigi: You didn't do it, did you?",
        "Rex: I did. I mean, I tried. Look, she has nowhere else to go, she's flat broke, she's pregnant with my kid--",
        "Gigi: We don't know if it's yours.",
        "Rex: But if it's mine, I'm not gonna let her live on some park bench.",
        "Gigi: Oh, but she can live in your loft?",
        "Rex: Where else is there?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. Why is it our responsibility to provide shelter for Stacy? Why does she have to sleep in your bed?",
        "Rex: I'm not going to be there.",
        "Gigi: She's doing it all over again. She's using the baby to get exactly what she wants-- can you not see that?",
        "Rex: Okay, but what can we do? If it's my kid--",
        "Gigi: I gotta go.",

        "Rabbi Rabinowitz: In so doing, we will witness and bless the joining of these two couples in holy matrimony.",
        "Priest: Marriage is an honorable estate, not to be entered into unadvisedly.",
        "Rabbi Rabinowitz: Blessed be you that have come here in dedication to all that is loving, good, and sacred. We bless you and welcome you in joy. May the source of life sustain you in life. May all that is noble and true in this universe inspire your lives together and bring peace to all humankind.",
        "Priest: I understand that the couples have prepared some words that they would like to share with each other.",
        "Charlie: Oh! I guess that's my cue.",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "Charlie: Okay. Ah. Whew. Viki D., You changed my life. I walked into that diner in Paris, Texas and saw you, and that was it. Your belief in me, your friendship, those eyes... ah. If it weren't for you, I never would've found my son-- or anything else in this world that really matters to me. You're my rock, Viki. And I promise you that I'm gonna spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy.",
        "Viki: Ohh.",
        "Viki: Oh, Charlie, my Charlie, you already make me happy. I never thought I would ever feel this way again. Of course, I never thought anyone would build me a diner, either.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Viki: And now, we're building a life together. You have given me friendship and support and love and so much joy. I think it is highly appropriate that we met at the Bon-Jour, because that's what I'm going to say to you every single morning for the rest of my life.",

        "Dorian: Didn't you say there was ice cream?",
        "Blair: It melted.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "T\u00e9a: Darling, we could afford to fix this place up if it'll make you feel better. We are filthy rich.",
        "Blair: We don't need your charity. Do we, Aunt Dorian?",
        "T\u00e9a: Have it your way, Blair. I'll be in the limousine, Todd. Oh--and, Dorian, Todd and I just paid Ray Montez and his new gorgeous wife in Belize a visit. They send their regards.",
        "Blair: You know, I could've ended up with Todd, you know. It could've been me.",
        "T\u00e9a: But it wasn't. Todd?",
        "Blair: I'm not gonna allow you to end up with that two-timing ambulance chaser.",
        "Todd: Look, T\u00e9a doesn't work anymore. We just...relax.",
        "Blair: Todd, it could be so much better. Can't we try again?",
        "Todd: Oh, Blair, you threw away your chance with me after that one time in the cabana, remember?",
        "Blair: How?",
        "Todd: You gave up. You gave up and just...buried yourself here at La Boulaie. And now look at you.",
        "Dorian: Not ducks. We'll breed kitty cats. Won't that be fun?",
        "Blair: No. No, no, no. No cats, Dorian. No way.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, I appreciate your helping with Stacy, but what's going on now-- that's between Gigi and me. We are back together, and no one's gonna pull us apart.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Your point?",
        "Rex: I just want us to be clear.",
        "Schuyler: You and Gigi are back together. Got it.",
        "Rex: And if you think you can use the fact that Stacy is pregnant as some way to break us up--",
        "Schuyler: Dude, do you have any idea how torn up she is, and you can't do the one thing she asks you to do, which is get rid of Stacy?",
        "Rex: This is none of your business.",
        "Schuyler: I'm her friend. I was worried about her.",
        "Rex: She doesn't need you to worry. She has me. So you can stay the hell away from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What's that?",
        "Gigi: The answer to our little problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you honestly telling me that I can't be Gigi's friend anymore? What kind of Neanderthal are you?",
        "Rex: Enough of the games, okay? I know you have a thing for her. Now, all I'm saying is, we have enough problems. We don't need you getting in the way.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I think I'm gonna let Gigi decide if we're friends or not. Oh, and by the way, I would stop worrying about me and start focusing on Gigi. She's not happy, Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Almost $300? What do you expect me to do with this? This won't even cover a month's grocery bills, let alone rent an apartment.",
        "Gigi: Maybe not. But it's enough to make that pregnancy go away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Blair: Scat!",
        "Dorian: Oh!",
        "Blair: No--",
        "Dorian: What'd you do that for?",
        "Blair: I'm not gonna stay here, end up here alone, crazy in this house. Come on!",
        "Dorian: That's not nice. Kitties don't like to be scared like that.",
        "Blair: Upstairs. Let's go. Let's go.",
        "Dorian: Mean.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rabbi Rabinowitz: We're doubly blessed today in that such good friends are sharing their wedding. Clint?",
        "Clint: Nora, you've had such a rough time the last few months. I fully understand how difficult it is for you to think of your own happiness. So I know what it means for you to be here. And I understand the faith that you're showing by joining me here at the altar on this, our wedding day. I'm grateful and I'm honored. Honored because what I love about you is your honesty, your strength, your stubbornness. You are a challenge, sweetheart, but I love every second of it. So, my 20-minute girl, I love you, and I can hardly wait to see what happens next.",

        "Clint: Never stopped you before.",
        "Nora: Clint, the truth is... the only thing I know is that I love you. And that's the truth. And you deserve the best.",
        "Clint: And that's you.",
