        "Gigi drives Natalie to the abortion clinic and tells her that it's entirely possible that the baby is John's and not Brody's. At that point, Natalie envisions how great it will be to have a child with John and how hers', John's, Jessica's and Brody's lives can all turn out good, unlike she'd feared could happen if it's found out that she is having Brody's baby. At that point, she discover that she cannot go through with it. John informs Brody that he has reason to believe that Eli is Kelly's mother's murderer, the same as Bennett Thompson. When Kelly finds out that Blair is going to elope with Eli, she tells her that she believes he's a murderer although Blair does not want to believe it. So she persuades Blair to postpone the wedding. Meanwhile, Eli has threatened Hannah and she is unconscious at St. Anne's on sleeping pills when nobody knows what he's done. Cole can sense that she might be in danger. So he goes to St. Anne's to find out. Dorian and David want to convince each other that they have moved on. So she offers Clint a business deal if he helps her have David believe that Clint is in love with her. And David hires and pays Mandy to pretend that she's in love with him. But neither of them convince the other that their scams are true."

        "David: Ah, what is that? Do you hear that? Do you hear that, gorgeous? They're playing our song.",
        "Mandy: Oh, yeah. We love that song.",
        "David: That's right. They were playing this song the night that I first looked Mandy into her deep, blue eyes, and I just completely lost myself.",
        "Clint: They're brown, aren't they?",
        "David: What?",
        "Dorian: Your true love's eyes.",
        "Mandy: Contacts. I was wearing blue contacts that night.",
        "David: I knew that.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Of course. So the reason that we had to leave The Palace and come to this dump is because you needed to pretend that you were hearing your song?",
        "David: Who's pretending?",
        "Dorian: There is no song. You do not love Mindy.",
        "David: Mandy.",
        "Dorian: Whatever.",

        "Dani: Mom, what are you saying?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no. He may have fooled the rest of you, okay, but --ha ha--this man-- this man is your father, Dani, this man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Blair, I'm begging you. You can't go to Las Vegas tonight.",

        "Eli: Hannah? Still with us? Feels kind of nice, doesn't it, like a warm bath. When they find you in the morning, they're gonna say, \"Poor Hannah. She tried it once before. It was only a matter of time.\"",

        "Mandy: Me? You didn't know what color my eyes were.",
        "David: I am talking about my grandfather's widow. You didn't tell me that you and Renee knew each other.",
        "Mandy: Was I supposed to?",
        "David: She almost outed you. Mandy, I told Dorian that I was seeing a swimsuit model. I can't have her finding out that the woman of my dreams charges by the hour.",
        "Mandy: Why do you care what Dorian thinks?",
        "David: I don't. I'm just tired of her games. That's what tonight is all about, proving that I don't love Dorian.",

        "Dorian: You're a lot more convincing than David and his swimsuit model. Just hope you can keep it up.",
        "Clint: So long as I have your promise that that stadium is gonna have the Buchanan name on it, well, I'll do most anything you need.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. What I need most is for David to finally be convinced that I don't love him.",

        "Gigi: We don't have to stay, you know, if you don't want to go in.",
        "Natalie: Why would you say that?",
        "Gigi: Because I think you need more time to think.",
        "Natalie: No. No. I don't. I'm ready...because you know what? I can't have Brody's baby. Brody and Jessica are having their own baby, and nothing should take away from that.",
        "Gigi: What if it's John's?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Not sure where Natalie is. She was kind of vague on the phone earlier. What's the big news? You really wanted your sister to be here.",
        "John: Yeah. I don't know if she's gonna be able to hold it in, Brody. You look like you're about to burst.",

        "Kelly: I'm trying to keep you from doing something you'll regret.",
        "Blair: Regret? Oh, my gosh, Kelly, I finally found a man who makes me as happy as I make him. Tell me why I shouldn't grab on to him with both hands and never let go.",
        "Kelly's voice: The man has killed 3 people. One of them is my mother, and now he's planning to marry my cousin.",
        "John's voice: Which is exactly why you need to lie low, all right? We do not want to tip Eli off to this investigation.",
        "Kelly: I know you think this is the right thing for you.",
        "Blair: Yes. It's right. I'm not gonna let you second-guess myself just because you are jealous.",
        "Kelly: Blair, I promise this is not about me.",
        "Blair: It is about you. You just don't really know it because when things fall apart for you, you get disappointed, and you try to put everybody in the same boat because somehow that makes you feel better, but, sweetie, just because you're unhappy, doesn't mean that I have to be.",
        "Kelly: That's not it, not even close.",

        "Blair: What about the kids? They'll get used to Eli.",
        "Kelly: But why not let him get to know them better, you know? Do you really know him? Why-- what about giving yourself a little bit more time just to make sure?",
        "Blair: Stop. You're the one that said that Eli was a great guy.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, but you--",
        "Blair: Okay, Kelly. If you've changed your mind about Eli, I want to know now, and I want to know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Just let go. Good girl. Now, I want you to hold on to these, little something to remember me by. Ah. Remember, you're not a bad person. You gave up your own life so Cole could live his. I respect that.",
        "Sister Katherine: How is Miss O'Connor doing?",
        "Eli: Oh, much better, I think. As you know, she hasn't slept much for the last few days, just ridden with guilt, I'm afraid, but I promised her I'd tell the staff to not disturb her at all tonight. I think she's finally ready to get some rest.",

        "Jack: I don't get it. Is she sick, or what?",
        "Dani: Yeah. Mom, Jack is right. You're not making any sense.",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr! Starr! Tell them. Tell everybody. Tell everybody here that this man-- listen to me. I want you to tell them that this man is not your father.",
        "Starr: T\u00e9a, he is my father. He told me that a long time ago, and it was our secret for a while, okay? He is that man in the pictures. I'm telling you, I would not lie to you, T\u00e9a. I love you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I love you, too, mm, yeah, but my eyes-- my eyes, they don't lie, and I can tell that this man is not that man.",
        "Starr: He is. He is the man that loves you, T\u00e9a.",
        "Todd: It's true, more than anything.",
        "T\u00e9a: How did you do it? How did you get Starr to believe that you're her father?",

        "Starr: Jack, stop. Let Dad handle this.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, there's nothing to be frightened of. The doctor said that something like this would occur.",
        "T\u00e9a: Something like what?",
        "Todd: Well, that changes in the tumor would cause changes in your memory. When I got back to Llanview, I told you about what happened, that I'd had an accident and that's why my face is different, but I'm the same person. You know that. You'd just forgotten it for a second.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why should I believe you?",
        "Todd: Do you remember on the island and there was this crazy crab, you know, eyeballs? Remember? You thought he was looking at you. You remember that? Yeah. You do. How would I know that unless I was Todd, hmm? You see? It's me. It's me. It's me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sorry.",
        "Todd: No. It's okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sorry, Todd.",
        "Todd: It's okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys. I'm really sorry. I lost track. didn't know what was happening. I just--",

        "Dorian: Oh, Davey. Oh, really? And when is it that you and Davey met?",
        "Mandy: I don't really--",
        "David: It was last year on Queen Noor's yacht. Mandy was wearing the pink bikini by Stracciatelli.",
        "Dorian: Oh, really? You know, it's so funny. I own a magazine, and we sometimes do swimwear issues, and your picture has never crossed my desk.",
        "David: Well, that's because Mandy was taking a much-needed hiatus. Hmm-hmm.",
        "Clint: Why was that?",
        "David: You know, rehab.",
        "Clint: She's already back on the sauce. What kind of rehab was that?",
        "David: Not for alcohol.",
        "Dorian: Oh, David, give it up.",
        "David: Give what up?",
        "Dorian: Queen Noor's yacht? I mean, who would believe a word you say?",
        "David: No one cares if you believe anything, Dorian. Mandy and I, we're in love.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, sure.",
        "David: Of course, no one would expect you to understand, Dorian. Everyone knows that you'd rather have me love you instead.",

        "Jessica: Well, now you know why I was so anxious for Natalie to be here.",
        "John: She's gonna be so happy for you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, and Brody, too. You know, you guys really bonded during my weird high-school phase. Ha ha!",
        "John: That had to be rough. That's why it's important to have a good friend.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Brody: We should let John go back to work.",
        "Jessica: Well, do you think we should call Natalie and make sure she's okay? I mean, she wasn't feeling well this morning.",
        "John: She called in sick, but she seemed fine when I saw her at Rodi's a little while ago.",
        "Jessica: But...",
        "John: Nothing.",
        "Jessica: No, no. No, no. I noticed it, too. Natalie has seemed a little distant lately, hasn't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Natalie, you can't obsess over the worst-case scenario, not when there's just as big a chance that the baby is John's.",
        "Natalie: No. I can't-- I can't think about that.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Natalie: Because how great would that be?",

        "John's voice: For what?",
        "Natalie's voice: What do you think? The baby is coming.",

        "Natalie's voice: Yeah. Not for long if you don't get a move on.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, you're the one that told me to go for it with Eli. You're also the one that told me that I needed to make a clean break with Todd--am I right, or not? Who, by the way, did you know, is walking T\u00e9a down the aisle as we speak?",
        "Kelly: That is no reason to rush, so you can one-up Todd.",
        "Blair: I am not trying to one-up Todd, Kelly. I'm trying to trust my own heart, to give myself permission to be happy for once, and I'm not gonna let you ruin it for me. So you know what? I'm gonna go wait outside for Eli away from you. Uhh!",
        "Kelly: Okay. I wasn't supposed to say anything, but I have to. Blair, you are in danger!",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Kelly: The reason why you can't marry Eli is because he is not who he says he is.",
        "Blair: Well, then who the hell is he, pray tell?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Eli: You all set? Uh, am I interrupting something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, David, why would I be remotely interested in you when I have a real man back in my life?",
        "David: Really? Clint, weren't you stag at Pa's wedding, still mourning Kimberly Andrews?",
        "Clint: I am not discussing Kimberly with you.",
        "David: Ooh, you're not? I thought you were recently begging me for information on her whereabouts. He did tell you about that, right, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. Of course, he did, and I want him to have closure with Kimberly, and then that way, we can commit to each other body and soul.",
        "Clint: Body and soul, lock, stock, and barrel.",
        "Dorian: Mm, so now all we need to decide is whether I'll be moving into your mansion or you will be moving into La Boulaie. Oh, David, I wonder how Viki will feel--oh, not to mention Jessica and Natalie--about Mandy moving into Llanfair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Whatever happened before, I'm fine now. I got confused because of the picture. In the hospital, they're gonna want to put me in a room for observation, you know, stick me in a bed, and it's our wedding night, Todd. Please, please let me stay with you.",
        "Starr: Hey, Dad, the justice of the peace is here.",

        "John: I'm not sure what's going on, but Natalie has seemed a little subdued.",
        "Jessica: And that's not like her.",
        "John: No. Eh, forget about it, you know? It has nothing to do with you. Your sister loves you. Just this afternoon, she was saying that she would do anything, give up anything to make sure you were happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Gigi, if I could be certain that this baby was John's...",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Natalie: It would change everything.",

        "Natalie's voice: No, thank God, and no one has to know about that night.",
        "John's voice: Yeah. Look at that. Unbelievable.",
        "Gigi: That almost looks like a smile. Have you changed your mind?",
        "Natalie: Just daydreaming.",
        "Gigi: About what?",
        "Natalie: The perfect world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So what's going on with Elijah Clarke? You still think he talked his client into faking her breakdown?",
        "John: Oh, I'm starting to think that's the least of his crimes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Eli, you're not interrupting anything. I was just informing Kelly that we're eloping.",
        "Eli: Oh. Well, am I wrong, or isn't the point of eloping to keep it a secret?",
        "Blair: Well, I thought I could trust Kelly.",
        "Kelly: You can, Blair, I swear.",
        "Eli: Well, I am glad you're packed because we better get to the airport if you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning as Mrs. Elijah Clarke.",

        "John: If Clarke did what I think he did, it wasn't for a client.",
        "Brody: What do you think he did?",
        "John: You know I've been investigating the murder of Kelly Cramer's mother.",
        "Brody: I thought you were looking for some guy named Thompson.",
        "John: Yeah. Bennett Thompson. And it's starting to look like he and Eli are the same person.",
        "Brody: You think Clarke killed Melinda Cramer?",
        "John: And Rodney. He's the one who drugged Balsom last night in Boston.",
        "Brody: Rex? Why?",
        "John: He was scheduled to meet with a records clerk, and--a guy that had information about Bennett Thompson. Eli intercepted it, and he didn't stop there.",
        "Brody: What happened?",
        "John: Well, I had faxed the same records clerk a picture of Clarke, you know, and when I called up to get a positive I.D. on the guy, he had suddenly had a heart attack.",
        "Brody: Hmm. That would mean...",
        "John: Yeah, that would mean 3 victims and counting.",

The joy in your eyes is like a goal they can aspire to, something they, too, can hope to have one day. And that's what we're here to celebrate. Hope. I'm reminded of--",
        "Todd: Excuse me. I'm sorry. That was really good, really beautiful and all, but... if you knew how long I've been waiting to get this right, you'd understand. We need to skip to the vows and, you know.",

        "Todd: Oh, yes, of course I do, yes. I hope that was okay, skipping ahead like that. I just--recently I've--I've... been reminded how precious time is and so... you won't regret it, I promise. I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow. But we're not gonna live for tomorrow, we're gonna live for today. Right now. And...try to figure out how to make it last forever.",

        "T\u00e9a: I do. I don't really know what to say right now. God knows I didn't have enough time to write the vows. Um... a couple months ago, I never thought I would smile again. But you changed that. You showed me that we could find our way to each other. And if that can happen, anything can happen. Anything. I feel like the luckiest woman in the world right now. I have you...ha ha ha. I have our kids. And we all have this moment, a moment that will--that will live in our memories forever. And I am so grateful to you for that. More grateful than you'll probably ever know.",

        "Eli: You're not having second thoughts, I hope.",
        "Blair: No. Not about you. It's just Kelly reminded me of something which I actually brought up to you earlier, and that is Dorian. She would just have a conniption fit if...if we ran off and got married behind her back, and I know that she would never forgive me, and she absolutely would never forgive you.",

        "Blair: Yes, he does. But you know what? I wouldn't take it personally. I think I know what this is about. I think it's Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding, you know, happening so soon. All this change. It overwhelms him. So here's what I'm thinking. Let's let Jack get through Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding and then we can have ours, okay? Besides, do we really wanna share the same wedding anniversary as Todd and T\u00e9a?",

        "Clint: What'd he do?",
        "Dorian: He's the cheapest drunk in the world. After two drinks, it's gonna be \"Mandy who?\" And the truth will out.",
