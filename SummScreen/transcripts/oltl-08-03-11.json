        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Lee: Counselor, why would you drop the murder charge against Mr. Buchanan?",
        "Nora: Because Mr. Buchanan did not murder Edward Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: David, where did you get this gum?",
        "David: The star of \"Hold the Diploma\"--Nate Salinger.",
        "Bo: Nate Salinger gave you this?",
        "David: Yeah. I never pegged him to be a tastemaker, but he sure knows his movie snacks.",
        "Bo: He knows a lot more than that.",
        "David: What do you mean?",
        "Bo: Nate did it. He had to be the one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Thanks. I don't have the right to ask you anything, so I really appreciate--",
        "Dani: Look, I won't tell anyone that you hurt Matthew, but don't make a big deal out of it, ok?",
        "Nate: Ok.",
        "Dani: I'll keep your secret, but that's all.",
        "Todd: What secret's that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Blair, are you even here? Hello. I'm in the midst of telling you that David and I managed to get back the master of our film \"Vicker man.\" Are you even listening?",
        "Blair: Of course I'm listening.",
        "Dorian: Why do you look like you've seen a ghost?",
        "Blair: Because I just did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: You have a visitor.",
        "Old Todd: Who?",
        "Guard: A lawyer.",
        "Old Todd: I don't have a lawyer.",
        "Guard: Yeah? Tell that to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I didn't realize movie snacks had such an influence on you, Pa.",
        "Bo: This is about Matthew.",
        "David: How?",
        "Bo: Nora and I tried to piece together what happened the day that Matthew got hurt, so we tried to track all of his movements except for a few hours here. And he was supposed to be alone.",
        "David: So you think maybe he was hurt then?",
        "Bo: That's the only time it could've been, and then we started searching everywhere for a clue. Just to try to point ourselves in the right direction.",
        "David: That was always the hardest part of \"supermodel crime club\"-- getting a clue.",
        "Bo: Well, we found one. A wrapper from this kind of gum.",
        "David: You think Nate Salinger put Matthew in the hospital?",
        "Bo: I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Lee: Madam District Attorney, after several failed attempts to prosecute someone for this crime, I'd think you would welcome a televised confession.",
        "Nora: Yes, I wish I could, but it's a false confession.",
        "Judge Lee: Are you sure? After all, it's not as if you haven't botched this case before.",
        "Nora: Yes, well, your honor, that's exactly why I want to proceed with the most abundance of caution. Mr. Buchanan did not kill Edward Ford, and I can't in good conscience let this confession stand.",
        "Judge Lee: How do you know Mr. Buchanan lied?",
        "Nora: I can assure the court--",
        "Judge Lee: The only thing that would assure me is a real suspect. If Todd Manning, Inez Salinger, Nathaniel Salinger, and now Mr. Buchanan did not kill Edward Ford, then who did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Does your mom know that lover boy is here?",
        "Dani: I don't know--I haven't seen her since last night.",
        "Todd: Have you talked to her at all?",
        "Dani: She left me a message but that's it. Why? Is something wrong?",
        "Todd: Well, I heard that you were gonna keep a secret for buster here. That seems wrong to me.",
        "Nate: Don't call me that.",
        "Todd: But you've been called... what do you call, one of the most promising young loins to come along in years. Ha ha ha! You must be really proud. I don't care. Get out.",
        "Nate: Look, Mr. Manning, I know what I did...",
        "Todd: No, uh-uh. I don't think you do know what you did. Do you think your crime was whoring yourself out? No. Your crime was breaking my daughter's heart. No getting away from that.",
        "Dani: Ok, all right...",
        "Todd: Why would you give a promise to keep this kid's secret?",
        "Dani: That's between me and Nate.",
        "Todd: Oh, is that right?",
        "Dani: Yeah. And you should understand that, Dad. It's not like you've never kept a secret from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: He's all yours.",
        "Old Todd: Where have you been? You're late.",
        "T\u00e9a: Am I?",
        "Old Todd: Yeah. You should've posted bail. The charges should be dropped by now.",
        "T\u00e9a: You think I'm here to save you?",
        "Old Todd: That's what you do, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. The person I'll do anything to save is my husband Todd. Who the hell are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi! Gigi! Gigi! Look, it's ok! You can come out! Where are you? Gi-- Geeg!",
        "Echo: Rex, what's wrong?",
        "Rex: She was here!",
        "Echo: Who?",
        "Rex: Gigi! She was here!",
        "Echo: Rex--",
        "Joey: Dad is this true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Lee: Ms. Buchanan, are you just eliminating the citizens of Llanview one by one in this crime, or do the police have a genuine suspect?",
        "Nora: We have a strong indication as to the identity of Mr. Ford's killer.",
        "Judge Lee: Really? Do share with us, Madame D.A.",
        "Nora: I can't.",
        "Judge Lee: Why not?",
        "Nora: The suspect is out of our jurisdiction.",
        "Judge Lee: Give me a name and we can fix that.",
        "Nora: Your honor, as you have pointed out, this office has wrongly accused more than one person of this crime. So until we're absolutely ready to file charges, I must respectfully decline to name anyone.",
        "Judge Lee: I'll be happy to sign a request for extradition.",
        "Nora: If that becomes necessary, your honor, I will make application.",
        "Judge Lee: You're working to bring this suspect back to Llanview?",
        "Nora: It is all that Commissioner Buchanan and I think about.",
        "Judge Lee: I hope to see results soon.",
        "Nora: So do we.",
        "Judge Lee: Now, Mr. Buchanan. Why did you confess to killing Edward Ford when you didn't do it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Nate Salinger, the porn king, attacked my little bro? Why?",
        "Bo: It's a long story.",
        "David: You can tell me on the way.",
        "Bo: Hold it.",
        "David: No, you hold it. I understand. You're the Police Commissioner. You can't lay a hand on him. That's why you're lucky you have a son with no scruples.",
        "Bo: No! You leave Nate Salinger up to me.",
        "David: What are you gonna do?",
        "Bo: You're just gonna have to trust me on this.",
        "David: I always trust you, Pa.",
        "Bo: And you can't say a word to anybody.",
        "David: That's where it gets hard.",
        "Bo: David, if you say anything, you could hurt Matthew even more.",
        "David: How's that?",
        "Bo: I wish I could tell you, but I can't. Just please, promise me for Matthew's sake you're gonna keep quiet.",
        "David: All right. I promise.",
        "Bo: Do you know where Nate Salinger is now?",
        "David: He was leaving the Buenos Dias right before I came here.",
        "Bo: Did he say where he was going?",
        "David: His brother said something about Dani. I bet he went to her house.",
        "Bo: Thank you. Thank you. You have helped me more than you'll ever know.",
        "David: Hey, Pa...",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "David: One day you'll tell me how I helped you, right?",
        "Bo: One day. Thank you.",
        "David: Helped my Pa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're gonna compare me to this punk? If I have ever kept anything from you, it was to protect you, Dani.",
        "Dani: Well, maybe I'm protecting someone, too.",
        "Todd: This guy? This guy who humiliated you and himself in front of the entire town on a big screen? Why did you even let this trash into my house? That's what I'd like to know.",
        "Dani: You don't--",
        "Todd: You do not care about this jerk! Understand?",
        "Dani: And so what if I do? Some people think I'm crazy to care about you, and you know what? What Nate did isn't half as bad as some of the stuff that you have done. So should I drop you just because someone else says I should? Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I honestly couldn't tell you which Todd was which.",
        "Dorian: There must have been some way to test them.",
        "Blair: They both had Todd memories. Things that only Todd would know.",
        "Dorian: Impossible.",
        "Blair: Exactly, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: What was your gut? What was your first reaction?",
        "Blair: I couldn't breathe. He sounded like Todd. He acted like Todd.",
        "Dorian: Only this new guy... actually looks like your Todd.",
        "Blair: Does that make him real? If that's the case, what about this other guy that I let in my life for the last eight years? That helped me raise my kids? That I was married to? How could I let him in? How could I let that happen?",
        "Dorian: No comment.",
        "Blair: You remember how hard I was on Todd when he first came back to Llanview.",
        "Dorian: Starr was the only one who accepted him.",
        "Blair: Did I believe that because she believed it so much? Because she missed her daddy?",
        "Dorian: Starr was closer to her dad than anybody else. It was natural to trust her instincts.",
        "Blair: Unless we were all wrong. Did I want Todd back in my life so badly that I just let him in? Dorian? If I was that wrong, then my life's been a sham.",
        "Dorian: It has not been a sham if this new Todd is the one that's a fraud.",
        "Blair: Well, he certainly didn't feel like a fraud when he kissed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Come on, Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't call me that.",
        "Old Todd: Why? That's what I call you. Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't call me that.",
        "Old Todd: You can still call me sir if you want. That's what you called me when we first met.",
        "T\u00e9a: You read that somewhere.",
        "Old Todd: Is that what he told you? He's a fraud, you know.",
        "T\u00e9a: My husband is not a fraud. You're the fraud.",
        "Old Todd: You sure about that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I am.",
        "Old Todd: As sure as you were five minutes ago? Wait till five minutes from now.",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't plan on being here five minutes from now.",
        "Old Todd: Yeah, well, I didn't plan on being here at all.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really? Because the real Todd Manning, he's never surprised to find himself in jail.",
        "Old Todd: See, that's funny. I'm glad to see you haven't lost your stuff, Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't call me that! You don't know me.",
        "Old Todd: Then why are you here? If you have so much faith in that man that you lie with every night, why are you here? Why are you standing right here? Why? You're not so sure about anything, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Gigi was here, ok? Right here. Don't touch anything.",
        "Echo: Ok, ok, ok, but just slow down.",
        "Rex: She was right here. There might be a clue or something.",
        "Echo: Just tell me what happened.",
        "Rex: Gigi was here.",
        "Echo: Ok. I don't understand.",
        "Rex: I saw her in the mirror.",
        "Echo: Maybe you saw a reflection.",
        "Rex: No, no. I saw her. She was looking right at me. But then I must've scared her or something, because I took a step toward her and she ran off.",
        "Echo: She disappeared?",
        "Rex: No, not disappeared. Ran off. I'm not crazy.",
        "Echo: I didn't say you were.",
        "Rex: I saw her. Here.",
        "Echo: Ok, Rex, honey, then tell me this. You love Gigi, right, and she loves you.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Echo: Why would she run away from you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Lee: Mr. Buchanan, tell me why you confessed to a crime you didn't commit. Did the D.A. coerce your confession?",
        "Clint: No, your honor.",
        "Judge Lee: I can see the looks, sir. What's going on between you and the District Attorney?",
        "Clint: Your honor... I brought a lot of hurt into Nora Buchanan's life. There was bad blood between us and between me and my brother as well. It's kind of public. You probably read about it in the paper. And I chose to retaliate, and I brought a world of hurt upon them, which I lived to regret. I did a whole bunch of stuff that they just didn't deserve, and when I was told that I was dying, I wanted to make amends.",
        "Judge Lee: By confessing to a murder you didn't commit?",
        "Clint: Yes. It was the only way to protect--",
        "Judge Lee: Who were you trying to protect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You took a chainsaw to my life last night. Why the hell wouldn't I be here?",
        "Old Todd: Trouble at home?",
        "T\u00e9a: We will be just fine once we have you taken care of.",
        "Old Todd: So he didn't answer any of your questions?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd doesn't know why you're here, either, or what you want.",
        "Old Todd: You sure about that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. He's just as upset--",
        "Old Todd: He didn't twitch? Upset?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes!",
        "Old Todd: How about you? You upset?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. I will be fine once I get some answers from you.",
        "Old Todd: Me first.",
        "T\u00e9a: What, are we negotiating?",
        "Old Todd: Sure. Why not? That was always fun. You were always really--",
        "T\u00e9a: Who the hell are you? Huh?",
        "Old Todd: I'm Todd Manning. You're not so good at that...",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you want? What do you want?",
        "Old Todd: I want everyone to wake up and realize that they've been had.",
        "T\u00e9a: I haven't been had.",
        "Old Todd: Ok, now it's my turn.",
        "T\u00e9a: Fine. What's your question?",
        "Old Todd: Here's my question. How could you fall for his act? How could you do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I got a news flash for you. I am your dad. And I'm always gonna be your dad. You do not get to drop me.",
        "Dani: I didn't say I wanted to.",
        "Todd: Well, you can still drop him.",
        "Dani: No, that's for me to decide. My decision.",
        "Todd: No, no, no. You're too young to make your own decisions.",
        "Dani: That's great. You don't like what I decide so I'm immature?",
        "Nate: Dani, I don't want to cause any more problems, ok? I'm gonna go.",
        "Todd: Yes, yes, you're going to go. And you're never gonna come back. All right. See ya. You stay in there. Just want to have a word with you. Do you recall when I found you using Danielle to prepare-- you doing a little research for your big movie debut? Yeah. Do you remember what I almost did to you? Come back here sometime, try to make contact with my daughter again, and this time I'll follow through.",
        "Dani: I'll see you later, Nate.",
        "Nate: Later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I should've known better. I should've known better.",
        "Old Todd: You answered my question.",
        "T\u00e9a: Than to try to reason with you.",
        "Old Todd: How could you fall for that guy? How could you fall for his act?",
        "T\u00e9a: I love my husband. I have loved my husband for years.",
        "Old Todd: You came back to town because you heard that Todd Manning was in trouble.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I see you did your homework. Good for you.",
        "Old Todd: And then you see his face. How could you not know?",
        "T\u00e9a: I knew he was the man I loved.",
        "Old Todd: \"Loved.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I don't know what you're trying to do here, ok? I don't know if you're trying to get back at Todd for something or if you want to extort money from him. I don't know what it is you're doing, but I'll tell you one thing, whoever the hell you are. You are not gonna destroy my family.",
        "Old Todd: It's my family. My family. Starr is my family. Jack is my family. Danielle is my family, T\u00e9a.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I don't know why Gigi would run. We just have to find her.",
        "Echo: Rex, where would Gigi go?",
        "Rex: I don't know, but she's gotta be in trouble.",
        "Echo: Why?",
        "Rex: That's the only reason she'd run.",
        "Echo: Why didn't she ask you for help? Why would she be afraid of you?",
        "Rex: I don't know. We just have to find her!",
        "Echo: Rex, does any of this make sense to you, that she would show up here and then run?",
        "Rex: You think I'm hallucinating?",
        "Echo: You told me that you haven't been sleeping well.",
        "Rex: Gigi was here. In this room.",
        "Echo: Honey, listen to me. You were at the hospital. You were there when they took her into the O.R. Her heart is inside Clint right now. She couldn't have been here. Honey, she's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Lee: Mr. Buchanan, I'm waiting. Who would you protect by confessing to Edward Ford's murder?",
        "Clint: My brother and his wife. They were catching an awful lot of heat because the case was not solved, and I figured if I copped a plea, then I would-- they could clear the case.",
        "Judge Lee: You wanted to help their conviction rate?",
        "Clint: It was the least I could do. I owed them. Hell, I was dying and I was facing up to all the things I did wrong. Not only to them but to many other people that I loved. Since I was dying, one more charge against me didn't matter if I could make their life a little easier.",
        "Judge Lee: Convenience is not the standard for conviction in this court, Mr. Buchanan. Now, as to the other charges against you, what is your plea? Shall we take the charges one by one?",
        "Clint: No, your honor. To all the other charges, I plead guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Reality check, Blair. You need answers and you need them fast.",
        "Blair: That's easy for you to say.",
        "Dorian: True. I have no idea how I would feel if suddenly there were two David Vickers Buchanans knocking at my door.",
        "David: It'd be Christmas morning, wouldn't it?",
        "Dorian: Ha ha ha!",
        "David: I heard my ears burning. Could hear it myself. What's going on out here? Uh-oh. Looks big. Should I get a drink first? Do I need a lawyer? Lay it on me.",
        "Blair: Go ahead. Tell him. He's gonna find out sooner or later.",
        "Dorian: It turns out that Todd may not be Todd after all.",
        "David: What do you mean? There's no Todd?",
        "Dorian: There are two Todds. But that's a really long story. How did your--did Bo like \"Vicker man\"?",
        "David: Oh, Pa hasn't had a chance to see it yet. He had a major breakthrough on a case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Mr. Manning's inside.",
        "Bo: That's all right. I'm here to see you.",
        "Nate: Is it about that...movie thing last night?",
        "Bo: No. Would you like a piece of gum?",
        "Nate: Thanks.",
        "Bo: Do you like this gum?",
        "Nate: Yeah, it's my favorite.",

        "Bo: Yeah, it's rare. It's very, very rare. Do you know, Nora and I found a wrapper exactly like this in our living room? It's from the day that Matthew got hurt, so we started looking around, searching for signs of whoever might've been there, because that's where Matthew got hurt. We don't know what happened. We're not jumping to any conclusions or anything, you know. It could've been an accident. We know that Matthew walked away from whatever happened, so maybe that person thought that there really wasn't a problem. And then later, when things went really bad for Matthew, maybe they were afraid to come forward. But we don't know. And that's what eats at Matthew's mom and me, is that we just want to know. Does that make sense, Nate?",

So I lost it, ok? I--I lost it, and that's why I hit him. And that's not an excuse for keeping my mouth shut this whole time. I should've just stepped forward. But I was scared of what would happen.
