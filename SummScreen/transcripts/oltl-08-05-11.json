        "Everybody is awaiting the answer about who is the real Todd Manning. Starr goes to visit original Todd in the jail cell with a list of questions that only her father could answer. He knows all the answers but she suspects that this man \"did his homework\" and that is why he knows things that her real father may not remember from the distant past. Viki informs John that the man in question (original Todd) knows and remembers things about their relationship and history that an imposter could not know or fake. Dani accompanies destiny and Shaun to the Ob-Gyn clinic where Vivian confirms that Destiny is pregnant and explores the options. Yet nobody likes to face the fact that she can either abort, give her baby up for adoption or raise a baby as a teenager. And they remark that Matthew is not \"there\" for her."

        "Old Todd: Hey, Shorty, you're all grown up, huh? I knew you'd believe me.",
        "Starr: Ok. So you know my nickname. Let's see what else you know about my family and me.",
        "Old Todd: My family, too.",
        "Starr: That's what we're going to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Destiny is a smart girl. She'll figure this out. Just wish she'd told me sooner.",
        "Shaun: I don't think Destiny could admit to herself that she was having a baby --",
        "Dani: I think you're right.",
        "Shaun: But there's no denying it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: Your pregnancy is normal.",
        "Destiny: I guess that's good news?",
        "Vivian: Yeah, but now you have some tough decisions to make, and you need to make them right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, you have finally told me the truth about your history with Todd, no matter how horrible it is.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You've always deserved to know.",
        "Blair: No. What I deserved to know is which of these two men is the father of my children.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Once McBain gets the results of the DNA test, you'll know.",
        "Blair: Oh, Tom\u00e1s, I don't think you've noticed this about me, but patience is not one of my many, many virtues.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Meaning?",
        "Blair: Well, the way I see it, we need to figure out what happened to Todd from the time you dropped him off to that rogue agent Baker till he walked back into town with a new face 8 years ago.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yes. Fortunately, the only person that knows exactly what happened to Todd is Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're my father. I'm on your side, and I always will be.",
        "Todd: Thanks, Jack. I'm glad you believe I'm your father.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I do, even if Starr doesn't.",
        "Todd: Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: If you are my father, like you say that you are, then you won't have any trouble answering a few questions.",
        "Old Todd: Is this a test?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: The answers you're looking for are in this envelope.",
        "Viki: Why? What is it?",
        "John: It's the DNA test results on your brother and the man we have in our holding cell. This will tell us which one of them is the real Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: I can't even wrap my head around it. My baby sister is having a baby.",
        "Dani: I know. It's just --",
        "Shaun: Wrong, especially since Matthew Buchanan isn't here to help out.",
        "Dani: That's not his fault. Shaun, you know he would be here for Destiny if he could.",
        "Shaun: I know. It's just that it's bad enough that Destiny has to go through this at all. She shouldn't have to do it by herself.",
        "Dani: She's not by herself. She's got you and Dr. Wright, and she has me. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Shaun: I know that. Destiny is lucky to have you as a friend. She's gonna need you.",
        "Vivian: Destiny would like you to come in for a consultation. Not you, Shaun. She wants Dani.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Did McBain give you any idea when to expect the results from the DNA test?",
        "Blair: Oh, I don't know how long I can wait. My family is completely turned upside down.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: My family, too.",
        "Blair: Well, then we both have a lot at stake, don't we? We both need to know who the real Todd is. What we know for sure is that Baker ordered you to kill Todd 8 years ago.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: But then he changed his orders once I found Todd nearly beaten to death in that tomb. Instead, he told me to bring Todd in.",
        "Blair: And then months later, he shows his face in Llanview with a completely different face.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And the only person who knows what happened in between is Todd.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? We need to talk to Todd. I want to hear his side of the story right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What do you say we open these together?",
        "Viki: Do you know, I'm almost afraid to know the results? I mean, what if I find out that the man that I've been loyal to and been forgiving and defending all these years isn't my brother at all? He's an imposter.",
        "John: Sounds like the guy downstairs made quite an impression on you.",
        "Viki: John, that man not only has Todd's face. He has his memories, all of them. He knows things about our history that no one else could know. He knows details of private conversations between us.",
        "John: He does?",
        "Viki: Yes, he does. He reminded me of a time that I came upon him in the cemetery. This was 18 years ago. Starr was a baby. He had been gone for a long time. We all thought he was dead.",
        "John: Lightning strikes twice.",
        "Viki: He told me that I was the one person above all else and anyone else that he could trust. It's like he'd stabbed me in the heart because if he's Todd, and he seems to be, that means that I have been betraying my brother for years. I've been loving and loyal to an imposter. How could I have done that?",
        "John: You can't beat yourself up about that.",
        "Viki: Can't I?",
        "John: No. No. You can't. You know, the more interesting question for me is, how can someone like you go to bat for someone like him for all these years, no matter who he is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You are damn right this is a test.",
        "Old Todd: Oh, my God.",
        "Starr: I was in shock.",
        "Old Todd: Well, probably, but I could see in your eyes that you know who I am.",
        "Starr: Maybe you got me when you called me Shorty, but that is not enough to convince me. If you are and want to prove that you are who you say you are, then you are gonna have to come up with the goods.",
        "Old Todd: Ok. Fine. Go ahead.",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Old Todd: Fire away.",
        "Starr: First question -- when I was a little girl, how did we communicate when you were away?",
        "Old Todd: Through a stuffed frog.",
        "Starr: Name.",
        "Old Todd: Fred.",
        "Starr: That's not enough. Full name.",
        "Old Todd: Fred the magic frog. Next?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Jack, did Starr actually say that she doesn't believe that Todd is really her father?",
        "Todd: Of course she didn't, did she? What did she tell you?",
        "Jack: I don't know. She was saying all kinds of crazy stuff.",
        "Todd: Yeah? Like what?",
        "Jack: Like about, you know, how you were with your old face, how you acted different then.",
        "Todd: And where is she now?",
        "Jack: I don't know, but don't listen to her, Dad. She's wrong.",
        "Todd: All right. Thanks, buddy. Really means a lot that someone I know believes in me. So Jack is on my side. Apparently, the jury is still out on Starr. Where do you stand?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: So that's how it's gonna be? My little sister thinks I'm gonna sit out here in the waiting room while she goes through the toughest time in her life?",
        "Vivian: She asked for Dani. I'm sure she'll tell you all about it later.",
        "Shaun: I'm the one taking care of her now. I have the right to be in there.",
        "Vivian: I know, but she's my patient, and it's my job to make sure that she's comfortable and to protect her privacy.",
        "Shaun: And I'm not going to make her uncomfortable, and I'm not gonna sit out here and be quiet.",
        "Destiny: Shaun, I just want Dani in here, ok?",
        "Shaun: I get that. I'm glad that she's here for you, but I love you, little D.",
        "Destiny: I know. It's just --",
        "Shaun: You think I'm gonna embarrass you?",
        "Destiny: I don't know.",
        "Shaun: I can keep it in check. Little D. This family has had too many secrets, and it has torn us apart. So from now on, we shouldn't hide anything. So I'm asking you, please, let me come in and be a part of this.",
        "Destiny: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? You know what we should do is get Dani down here. We can take a vote, and maybe I can convince her that I'm really her father. Then I'd be ahead, 2 out of 4.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're absolutely right. I want to tell Dani about this. In fact, I was gonna tell her about it today, but she said she had to be somewhere.",
        "Todd: Oh, right. You couldn't stop her.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. I couldn't. She said she had an important appointment, and she ran out somewhere.",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. Well, she can weigh in later, but I'm just curious about you. You with me or not?",
        "T\u00e9a: Didn't McBain say something about a DNA test? He said he had a sample from you, right?",
        "Todd: Yes. He did. I'd like to know how he got it. I never consented to it, but the other day, I found him in my office ransacking my desk. So he must've stolen it. Is that legal?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why would it matter? If you are who you say you are, then some DNA sample McBain has shouldn't scare you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: With all due respect, I never understood why you gave Manning a free pass.",
        "Viki: Look. I know what you think about Todd, and, obviously, it's completely justified. When I first met him, I disliked him, and then my reservations about him were more than confirmed when he raped Marty and tried to implicate my son Kevin in the rape. That was unspeakable. And then I found out that he was my brother, and I was horrified, but after a while, I began to see him as a kindred spirit of sorts. John, we are both products, victims of our father, Victor Lord. You know the stories. You know what he did. The damage that he did to us manifests itself very differently in Todd than in me, but we are both very damaged people nonetheless.",
        "John: And yet you're not a sociopath.",
        "Viki: I know. He's a rapist. He's a child. He's a liar. He's a monster sometimes. He's also just a human being, and he is capable of great love and remorse and acts of kindness and courage that are completely unexpected. More than anything, he loves his family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: First snake.",
        "Old Todd: Boa constrictor.",
        "Starr: Name.",
        "Old Todd: Barney.",
        "Starr: Barney's favorite lunch.",
        "Old Todd: Mice, preferably white mice.",
        "Starr: Yes or no -- was a tarantula my favorite spider?",
        "Old Todd: That's, like, a trick question because technically, a tarantula, while an arachnid, is not actually a spider. Do you know why?",
        "Starr: Do you?",
        "Old Todd: A spider's fangs, they move on an axis, but a tarantula's are fixed.",
        "Starr: What was my favorite spider?",
        "Old Todd: Black widow because after it mates, it eats the poor sap.",
        "Starr: My favorite place?",
        "Old Todd: Reptile roundup.",
        "Starr: Favorite mode of transportation.",
        "Old Todd: Taxi, especially when you're grounded.",
        "Starr: These are all too easy. Who is my arch nemesis?",
        "Old Todd: Max Holden.",
        "Starr: What did I do to him?",
        "Old Todd: Piranhas in the bathtub. By the way, really great move. I never got a chance to tell you.",
        "Starr: There's no chitchat here, ok?",
        "Old Todd: Ok.",
        "Starr: We -- what did I buy with the credit card that I stole from Max?",
        "Old Todd: Horse poop.",
        "Starr: Asa Buchanan and I had a battle. What is it I used as a weapon?",
        "Old Todd: Silly string. How am I doing? You believe me now?",
        "Starr: Why should I? Everything I just asked you is right here in this book, and you read it, didn't you? You cheated.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Blair, Blair, Todd is not gonna tell us what happened after I delivered him to Baker.",
        "Blair: Why not?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Two reasons -- he lived with it this long already --",
        "Blair: Or he might not be the same guy.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Exactly.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? I got to try. If there's just the slightest chance it'll bring me closer to knowing who this guy is, then I'm gonna take it.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That kiss.",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s, I thought we were gonna drop the kiss.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: The guy with the scar on his face kissed you. You felt something, even though you haven't admitted it.",
        "Blair: I told you when I first met you that Todd Manning was the love of my life, and in that wedding, in that picture, he showered me with gold balloons. It was the happiest day of my life.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Dorian said something, that you never loved anyone as much as you loved Todd, and that's the reason you gravitate back to him.",
        "Blair: Well, what about it?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I want you to know that I hope that I can break that cycle, no matter who that guy is in the jail cell. You think that's possible?",
        "Blair: I can't answer that, not until I know the whole story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: I examined Destiny, and I've already told her that her pregnancy is progressing normally.",
        "Shaun: That's good, right? Her and the baby are healthy?",
        "Vivian: Very, but this was an unplanned pregnancy --",
        "Destiny: No kidding.",
        "Vivian: And the pregnancy is quite advanced. Right now, Destiny has a lot of options open to her, and we will go over all of those in detail, but as her doctor and her friend, I just want you all to understand that if Destiny makes the decision to terminate, this will have to happen very quickly.",
        "Shaun: Wait. What do you mean, terminate?",
        "Dani: Shaun, like if she decides to have an abortion.",
        "Shaun: Viv, what are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Some of those are very nice sentiments, but you know, in my line of work, you end up finding out that everybody has got an excuse. \"Daddy didn't love me, so I became a murderer.\" \"Daddy didn't show me any affection, and so I became a pedophile.\" And, yeah, you're right. When Todd's family is in trouble, he tries like hell to save them, but 9 times out of 10, he's the one that put them in danger in the first place.",
        "Viki: You don't have to say any more. I mean, I've said the same stuff to myself. I can't tell you how many times I've said, \"that's it. I give up. I am through with him,\" and I have never been able to go through with it because, basically, this is a child. He's a child who was hurt and damaged and fractured, and I guess I will always love him.",
        "John: Gigi Morasco was your friend, wasn't she?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Of course she was.",
        "John: Jack Manning is responsible for her death, and Todd paid to cover it up. Can you just ignore that one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm not afraid of the test. I am who I say I am, and, obviously, the tests are gonna prove it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Good.",
        "Todd: No. Not good. John McBain ransacked my desk and stole a DNA sample. That has got to be invasion of privacy or something.",
        "T\u00e9a: I think we got bigger problems than that right now.",
        "Todd: Well, I don't. I'm gonna go over there and deal with him, I think.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no, no. You're not. I'll go. You two are like oil and water, all right. Let me go before you start World War III.",
        "Todd: You know, what's nice is that you're still my lawyer, even if you're not sure I'm your husband.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'll be back. Jack, see you later.",
        "Jack: Dad, don't worry. The DNA test will prove that you're you because you are.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Ok.",
        "Jack: You know, I don't remember you with that other face, and I don't care what you look like now or what you looked like before. You're still my dad.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Yeah. You protected me from going to jail. You're my father. Only my father would do something like that for me, right, Dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: No. I can't ignore what Todd may have done to protect his son, but I can't turn my back on him.",
        "John: Most admirable. I guess I'll never understand your blind devotion. Then again, maybe it's not important that I do. What do you say we find out the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah. That's right. So I did what I did because you're my son and I love you and I believe in you, right? Ok. Now, don't forget that. Give me a hug.",
        "Blair: Oh, sorry to interrupt a father-son moment.",
        "Todd: What's he doing here? What was that stuff about my not being Todd Manning?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: We need to talk, Todd.",
        "Todd: No. I'd rather you just got the hell out of my house.",
        "Blair: Would you just listen, please?",
        "Todd: This has nothing to do with you. I don't want this freeloader in my house anymore, ok? I'm gonna give you 5 minutes to get out, or I'm gonna call the cops and have you arrested for trespassing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Can I see the book? Thanks. I've never seen this book before in my life. That's the picture you put on a book? Look at that photograph.",
        "Starr: You cheated. Admit it.",
        "Old Todd: I didn't cheat. I didn't. I remember everything because it's my life. I know it. Every moment, every detail.",
        "Starr: And that's the problem. After so long, most people would forget a detail here and there, but you memorized Todd Manning's life.",
        "Old Todd: I memorized my life because I had to relive it every day. It's the only way I could keep myself from going crazy.",
        "Starr: Good save. Did you prep that one, too?",
        "T.M.: I didn't prep anything. They're my memories. I had to hold on to something and I chose to hold on to you and Jack because you're the most important thing in my life.",
        "Starr: Don't. Don't do that. You're not my father. Jack was right. You just can't be.",
        "Old Todd: Why not?",
        "Starr: Because my dad loves us. And he loved me, and he might not be perfect, but he would've never stayed away from me for that long.",
        "Old Todd: I didn't have a choice. I would've come home if I could've.",
        "Starr: I don't believe you. I don't. And I don't know who you are or why you're doing this, but it is cruel!",
        "Old Todd: Here's your frog.",
        "Starr: It's not mine. It's Hope's.",
        "Old Todd: Who's Hope?",
        "Starr: My daughter.",
        "Old Todd: Your what?",
        "Starr: You -- you don't know about that?",
        "T.M.: No, I -- not entirely my fault, you know. News travels slowly to remote, top-secret, paramilitary outposts. You have a kid? You're a child. You have a -- a daughter?",
        "Starr: I got pregnant when I was 16 and it was an accident, obviously. But she is beautiful. She is perfect, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me.",
        "Old Todd: Well, there you have it. I know exactly how you feel. Can I -- can I ask you something? Who's the lowlife who knocked you up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: An abortion? You would do that?",
        "Destiny: Maybe. I guess. Look, I don't know.",
        "Shaun: Viv, please. You said there were other options. What are they?",
        "Vivian: If Destiny decides to carry the baby to term, I would immediately put her on a healthy prenatal regimen. After that, she would have time to consider giving the baby to a family for adoption or raising it herself.",
        "Destiny: There aren't any other options, like, say, going back in time and getting a do-over?",
        "Vivian: I know these are not easy choices.",
        "Shaun: Not easy? You're telling my little sister to give up her kid?",
        "Vivian: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Shaun: Or to farm it out to someone else? Or to give up her future to change diapers and clean up spit? Yeah. I'd say that's not easy.",
        "Vivian: Shaun, I promise you. I would never tell Destiny what she should do. All I can do is let her know what her options are.",
        "Destiny: Shaun, don't blame this on Vivian. It's not her fault.",
        "Shaun: I know whose fault it is. And if he wasn't in rehab over in Philadelphia, I would beat his ass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: I asked you a question. You answer me, young lady.",
        "Starr: Don't call me young lady.",
        "Old Todd: Who is the lowlife scum that knocked up my daughter?",
        "Starr: He is -- he is not a lowlife.",
        "Old Todd: I'll be the judge of that.",
        "Starr: No, you won't. Hope's father is a good person, a great person, and he was my first love.",
        "Old Todd: Was? Where is he now?",
        "Starr: That is a long story.",
        "Old Todd: You know what? I seem to have a lot of time on my hands, so go ahead. Why don't you tell me all about this -- ha ha! This pillar of society, this great person? You never heard of a condom?",
        "Starr: His name is Cole.",
        "Old Todd: Cole -- ?",
        "Starr: Thornhart. Cole Thornhart.",
        "Old Todd: Thornhart?",
        "Starr: Patrick Thornhart and Marty Saybrooke's son.",
        "Old Todd: I have a granddaughter with Marty Saybrooke?",
        "Starr: No. My father does. You don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Jack, will you excuse us? I need to talk to Todd for just a minute, all right?",
        "Jack: I want to stay with Dad.",
        "Todd: That's ok, Jack. Hustle up. So what is this -- divide and conquer?",
        "Blair: Listen, you can't kick Tom\u00e1s out.",
        "Todd: So what would you like me to do -- let people stay in my house who accuse me of being an imposter rent-free?",
        "Blair: Ok, I know things were confusing last night and --",
        "Todd: I have an idea what happened last night. If you recall, Tom\u00e1s gathered as much of my family as he could and he accused me of being an imposter.",
        "Blair: And he admitted that he might've been just a little bit hasty when he said that.",
        "Todd: Hasty.",
        "Blair: He also said that he was sorry.",
        "Todd: Isn't that nice to know? What do you want from me?",
        "Blair: He filled me in on your all's back history, and I just need to hear from you. What happened in the mausoleum after Mitch beat you and left you there?",
        "Todd: What do you mean?",
        "Blair: How did you get out? Because when I arrived at the crypt, it was empty.",
        "Todd: What is this guy telling you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So let's see what it says.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Viki: I may not like what I hear, but I have to know which one is my brother.",
        "Cop: [Indistinct]",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't open that. Well I always worry about what's in the food Are those the results of Todd's DNA test?",
        "John: Yes. Yes, they are.",
        "T\u00e9a: And how exactly did you procure Todd's DNA?",
        "John: Toothbrush from his desk.",
        "T\u00e9a: That sounds like illegal search and seizure to me.",
        "John: Oh, no. It sounds like probable cause to me. It was Police business.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really? And what business was that?",
        "John: Investigating the attack on Jack Manning.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's a load of crap and you know it. Your purloining of Todd's toothbrush had nothing to do with Jack's attack. You had no legal right to do that.",
        "John: Counselor, before you start popping that little vein in your forehead that's always so cute, do you want to know who you're married to or not?",
        "T\u00e9a: What I want isn't relevant.",
        "John: What about what Mrs. Lord wants? I think she has a right to know which one of those guys is her brother. What about what Jack and Starr want? I think they have the right to know which one of them is their father.",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a, please. One of those two men is lying to us. We need to know which one.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're right. We do need to know, especially Todd and the man in that cell.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "T\u00e9a: So -- how do we do this?",
        "John: I have an idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: It doesn't matter what Tom\u00e1s told me. I want to hear it from you. So how did you get out of the crypt? How'd you find your way out?",
        "Todd: Is this a test?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yes! Because if you're really Todd Manning, you'll know all the details.",
        "Todd: I see. So if my story lines up with this guy's, then I'm really who I say I am?",
        "[Todd scoffs]",
        "Todd: All right. I'll tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: Would you two mind taking a little walk so that Shaun and I can talk about some things?",
        "Dani: Sure.",
        "Vivian: Thank you.",
        "Destiny: We'll be outside. Anywhere but here.",
        "[Shaun breathing heavily]",
        "Vivian: Here, here. Breathe into this.",
        "[Shaun exhaling]",
        "Destiny: I don't know what I'm gonna do.",
        "Dani: I wish I could tell you.",
        "Destiny: I wish anyone could. Every decision just seems like the wrong one.",
        "Dani: Ok, why don't we try to talk it out? Maybe we can come up with something.",
        "Destiny: Sure. Why not?",
        "Dani: All right. Let's start with adoption.",
        "Destiny: It seems like the right thing to do, and generous. Like, you can help someone and know that your baby is going to someone who really wants her, but --",
        "Dani: But?",
        "Destiny: She'll end up just like me -- not knowing who her mother is.",
        "Dani: There are all kinds of adoptions. You know, some people grow up knowing who their birth mothers are.",
        "Destiny: I know, but isn't that kind of weird? Watching someone else raise your baby knowing it's yours?",
        "Dani: Ok, well, we can come back to that one. Next option.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Whew.",
        "Vivian: I think you might be the biggest baby of all. And I mean big.",
        "Shaun: I can't help it. I'm crazy about my baby sister.",
        "Vivian: I know, sweetie.",
        "Shaun: It just kills me to even think about her getting hurt or throwing away her opportunity to live the life that she deserves.",
        "Vivian: No one says she has to.",
        "Shaun: I just want what's best for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I think the easiest thing for me to do is to just keep the baby.",
        "Dani: Des, I don't think \"easy\" is the best word to describe a single teenage mother.",
        "Destiny: Why not? Your sister's fine.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but she's also really lucky. And she's rich, and everybody helps her. I mean, I know that Shaun would help you. But you're not speaking to your parents.",
        "Destiny: Please, Dani, please don't call them that. Please.",
        "Dani: Ok. And even with everything Starr has, she still has to give up a lot. It's gonna take her longer to finish college, and she can't just go on a road trip or pull an all-nighter at the library like other college kids can do. Every decision she makes every day of her life, she has to think of Hope.",
        "Destiny: I think I know what I want to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Do you have a picture? Do you? Do you have a photograph of Hope? Can I see it? She has your smile. [Sniffles] The first time I ever held you, Viki put you in my arms, and you smiled. Like this. It was the first time in my life that the sun came out. [Sniffles] Thank you, my little Starr.",
        "John: Let him out.",
        "Old Todd: What's going on?",
        "John: You can come with me. Both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vivian: Shaun, look at me. Destiny is gonna be fine, all right? She is smart and she's got a good head on her shoulders. Ok, they should've used a condom, but --",
        "Shaun: No kidding.",
        "Vivian: But she's bright, and she's ambitious, and she's so talented.",
        "Shaun: That she is.",
        "Vivian: And it's terrible that Matthew isn't available to help her and that she's still estranged from your parents, but she's got Dani to lean on and to share her thoughts and her feelings with, and she has you. Destiny knows that you'll be there for her through this.",
        "Shaun: Always.",
        "Vivian: Just like I will be there for you. Always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Are you sure this is what you want to do? Because I will support you in anything. You know that.",
        "Destiny: I know, but -- I think this is the right thing to do, out of all of the options.",
        "Dani: Yeah, all 3 of them.",
        "Destiny: I know this is gonna be extremely hard, but this is the best decision.",
        "Dani: Just as long as you're sure about this.",
        "Destiny: I am. Now -- I just have to tell Shaun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: You know what I don't get?",
        "Vivian: There's only one thing?",
        "Shaun: What is a beautiful, brilliant woman like yourself doing with a guy like me?",
        "Vivian: Mm. Well, I will tell you. This beautiful, brilliant woman is with you because she is very lucky.",
        "Destiny: I've made up my mind.",
        "Shaun: Already?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. I've decided what I want to do.",
        "Vivian: Ok. What's your decision?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. I just wish Dani would answer her phone. I feel like we should all be together for this.",
        "Viki: You know, I'm actually going to wait until I know exactly what's going on before I tell anyone.",
        "T\u00e9a: That might be a really smart thing to do. We are making the right decision, aren't we, Viki?",
        "Viki: Absolutely. Come on. We don't have a choice.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm really terrified right now.",
        "Viki: That makes two of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Not that I owe you or anybody else an explanation, but I guess I could tell you. So what'd you do about squashing that DNA test? What the hell is she doing here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, she has a right to be here, too.",
        "Todd: Here for what?",
        "Jack: Dad, there's a Police car out front. What's going on?",
        "T\u00e9a: We agreed that this was the best way to do this.",
        "Blair: What? What is -- what is this about?",
        "Todd: Would someone like to tell me what's going on?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um --",
        "Todd: What's he doing here?",
        "T\u00e9a: We are now gonna hear the results of the DNA test.",
        "John: Time to find out who the real Todd Manning is."
