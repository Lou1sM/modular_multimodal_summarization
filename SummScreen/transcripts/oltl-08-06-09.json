        "Viki: Finally.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, finally.",
        "Viki: Amazingly.",
        "Charlie: Oh, I don't know. The last couple weeks, I think I would've given you even odds.",
        "Viki: I don't know why we ever agreed to a double wedding. There was so much more drama than was necessary.",

        "Oliver: Why are you asking me?",
        "Layla: I was hoping for a compliment.",
        "Oliver: What, like I should know fashion?",
        "Layla: Like you would notice if I looked good, not like I think you're gay.",
        "Oliver: I gotta go.",
        "Layla: Fish, wait. I thought this was going somewhere. I like you, okay? And I said a wrong and stupid thing, and I'm sorry. Can't we forget it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You job hunting?",
        "Kyle: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Hospital won't take you back?",
        "Kyle: Yeah, and if I don't find something soon, I'm gonna have to drop out of medical school.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You didn't sleep.",
        "Marty: No. Not much. I just kept thinking about all the things that could go wrong. I mean, what if--what if he says something wrong? Or what if they figure out that he's working for the police?",
        "John: Cole's ready. I gave him a contact no one will make as a cop. He's in good hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: These bills are marked and we have the serial numbers. So don't mix it with your own money. Give exactly these bills to Asher.",
        "Cole: No problem. This is everything Asher gave me to sell.",
        "Brody: All right. When you get more, you call me direct. It's okay if they see my number in your phone. As far as anybody knows, I'm still a bartender at Rodi's.",
        "Cole: I can't believe you're a cop now.",
        "Brody: Yeah, John pulled me out of training for this.",

        "Rex: He was conked out, earbuds in, game player still on.",
        "Gigi: Guess he seriously wanted the world to go away last night.",
        "Rex: Yeah, or just me.",
        "Gigi: Oh, you don't get all the blame. I'll talk to him. Oh, it was so good waking up with you.",
        "Rex: Same here.",
        "Gigi: It must've been a whole minute before I remembered.",
        "Rex: Hey, no -- hey, that's a great minute. Let's camp out in that minute forever.",
        "Gigi: I wish. I still can't believe my sister is having your baby.",

        "Rex: Will you marry me?",
        "Stacy: Yes. Yes! Yes! Of course, I'll marry you! Ahh. Ohh.",

        "Stacy: Oh, my God. It's true. My baby's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: My sister is having your baby. My sister is having your baby.",
        "Rex: Are you trying to make me feel worse?",
        "Gigi: No, I'm just trying to make it normal, make it part of our lives.",
        "Rex: We agreed.",
        "Gigi: I remember.",
        "Rex: Stacy does not come between us.",
        "Gigi: [Sigh] I hope not.",
        "Rex: We make it true, Morasco.",
        "Gigi: Then I need to fix my mistake.",
        "Rex: Where are you going?",
        "Gigi: To apologize to Stacy for suggesting she have an abortion.",
        "Rex: No! Really, bad idea. Just stay away from Stacy.",
        "Gigi: We'll never get to normal that way.",
        "Rex: You've done enough --",
        "Gigi: Damage?",
        "Rex: I was not going to say that.",
        "Gigi: Then what?",
        "Rex: You do not need to try to fix it, Geeg. Please, just stay out of it.",
        "Gigi: Stay out? Who are you trying to protect, Stacy or me?",
        "Rex: You! She tried to shove you down a flight of stairs.",
        "Gigi: That's when she was desperate. Now she's winning.",
        "Rex: She's not.",
        "Gigi: Oh, trust me, Balsom. She's not the least bit worried about me. She has your baby growing inside her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Help. Help. It can't be. I didn't lose the one thing that's gonna make Rex love me. My baby's not gone.",
        "Stacy: That bitch Gigi. She wanted me to get an abortion. She wanted my baby dead. She got what she wanted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I'm not mad at you, Layla, okay? I just don't like when people say things about me that aren't true.",
        "Layla: I know. You're right. And I'm sorry. This is so typical of me. I meet a man who treats me like a lady and I ask him if he's gay. No wonder I'm single.",
        "Oliver: No -- it's okay. Just stop beating yourself up about it.",
        "Layla: You forgive me, then? You don't hate me?",
        "Oliver: Of course I don't hate you. Far from it.",
        "Oliver: I gotta get to the cop shop.",
        "Layla: I'll see you at work. You sure we're all good?",
        "Oliver: Yes.",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Cristian: So that's the big secret? Fish is gay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Don't ask, don't tell? Is that the trouble that you're having with Officer Hunk?",
        "Kyle: Oliver's parents are really conservative, so he'd be dead to them if they knew. Plus, he always wanted to be a cop. You know, that's a tough crowd.",
        "Roxy: So Fish is hiding in plain sight. And you know what? That don't work. The one thing I know in life -- you gotta be yourself. You gotta let your freak flag fly. Anything else is like a bad wig -- ugly, itchy, and foolin' nobody.",
        "Kyle: Well, obviously, Oliver made his choice and it's not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Cole's gonna be fine.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I know, but you could let me know that. Hourly.",
        "John: I'm not gonna let anything happen to him. Hey.",
        "Starr: John. Hi.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marty and Starr: Hi.",
        "Marty: There's my beautiful girls. Hello.",

        "Brody: Come on, you don't want to do that.",
        "Cole: Look, man, they're cool, all right?",
        "Brody: But this is not.",
        "Man: You're a very twitchy man.",
        "Brody: I got places to be.",
        "Cole: Look, you're harassing my best customer. Hey, listen, call me whenever, all right?",
        "Brody: Yeah, not till you get some security.",
        "Cole: Look, it won't happen again, all right? Don't you knock?",
        "Asher: Your boy is seriously jumpy.",
        "Cole: Look, the guy's an Iraq war vet, all right? He's having some trouble with reentry, okay? The guy's a goldmine.",
        "Man: Who's already been here twice today. Why would that be?",
        "Cole: Look, he didn't have enough cash the first time. He had to hit up an atm. He just bought the last of my supply.",
        "Cole: Asher, who is this?",
        "Man: I am Asher's boss. Which means I am also your boss.",
        "Cole: Do you have a name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You're sweet to try and protect me, Balsom, but I can handle myself with Stacy.",
        "Rex: [Stammering] Can you just let it go for now?",
        "Gigi: Why don't you want me to apologize to my sister?",
        "Rex: I don't see it going well.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Rex: Okay, you two set each other off.",
        "Gigi: I will be humble. I will grovel and beg her forgiveness. How can that make it worse?",
        "Rex: Just seeing you will set her off.",
        "Gigi: Well, then I'll apologize more.",
        "Rex: Okay, you gave her money to abort the baby! She's not gonna forgive you for that, Geeg.",
        "Gigi: Will you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I wish we could hide in here all day.",
        "Charlie: Hmm. I'm game.",
        "Viki: Charlie? I did something not so good. I promised Bree a trip to the zoo today. I'm surprised she hasn't come in already.",
        "Charlie: Well, I locked the door. I figured this was the official start of our honeymoon.",
        "Viki: A honeymoon?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Do we get one of those?",
        "Charlie: Hey, we are gonna plan it today.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, I get that you just wanted the problem to go away.",
        "Gigi: Don't you?",
        "Rex: The problem, yes.",
        "Gigi: But not the baby?",
        "Rex: Do you, honestly? Is that what you wish for?",
        "Gigi: I wish it never happened.",
        "Rex: Me, too.",
        "Gigi: I wish our lives could be just us and Shane. We've been through hell. We deserve that.",
        "Rex: We will have our lives. We will have normal.",
        "Gigi: I don't want to share you. With anybody.",
        "Rex: You won't. There's room, Gigi. For the baby, not for Stacy.",
        "Gigi: Yeah? Well, for the next 9 months, Stacy and the baby are the same thing. Are you ready for that, Rex?",
        "Rex: We don't know that it's mine. There's still a chance that it isn't.",
        "Gigi: Don't!",
        "Rex: But if it is mine, I'm going to make sure that the baby is provided for.",
        "Gigi: And you don't think that's gonna take your time and your energy and your heart? What happens the day the baby's born, Rex?",
        "Rex: Gigi, stop.",
        "Gigi: No, really, picture it. Stacy will want you in the delivery room and you'll be there because where else would you be? And then Stacy's gonna hand you your son or daughter and you'll both be crying.",
        "Rex: Why are you doing this?",
        "Gigi: Because it's coming, Rex! You'll look at your child and a piece of your heart will leave this family. It has to. And then Shane and I will spend the rest of our lives competing with Stacy and her baby.",
        "Rex: It's not a competition.",
        "Gigi: Yes, Rex, that is exactly what it is. And it feels like Stacy's already winning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Any trouble?",
        "Brody: Asher showed up with some muscle. No knock, they just walked in.",
        "John: While you were there?",
        "Brody: Yeah. It was close, but they didn't make me.",
        "John: Good.",
        "Brody: It looks like Asher works under this guy.",
        "John: Asher's a punk. He works under everybody.",
        "Brody: Did you expect this or no?",
        "John: No, not this quick. It means Cole's got their attention, moving so much so fast. Can you describe this guy?",
        "Brody: I could. But I took some pictures, instead.",
        "John: Let's have a look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, what the hell --",
        "Man: You do not ask questions. I do.",
        "Cole: What is this?",
        "Man: Saying hello.",
        "Cole: Asher, dude --",
        "Asher: It's standard, man.",
        "Cole: Dude, what are you looking for? I gave you all the money.",
        "Asher: A wire.",
        "Man: Never answer for me.",
        "Cole: Hey, what do you want? Why do you think I'd be wearing a wire?",
        "Man: That's four -- four questions when I say, \"no questions.\" Your friend, the twitchy man -- he says John got him out of his training for this. John means John McBain, does it not? McBain the cop. So, I have to ask, who and what the hell are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Okay, here's the deal, Kyle. I float you on the hotel until you get a job, and then, when you get one, you pay me rent just like everybody else.",
        "Kyle: Thanks, Roxy. You're, like, the only person who's even been decent to me.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, I really don't know why. Obviously, I don't take blackmail too personally. At least in the end, everything turned out okay for my kids. I'll be right back.",
        "Roxy: Whoa. Speak of the devil.",
        "Oliver: Excuse me?",
        "Roxy: You know, you were a little rough on your friend over there. Why don't you give him another chance? By the way, he's crazy about you.",
        "Oliver: We need to talk in private, right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I can't believe you were eavesdropping.",
        "Cristian: What? I live here. I was walking through. I couldn't help it. So, is that what I walked in on the other night?",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Cristian: When you were having it out with Fish.",
        "Layla: We weren't fighting or anything. Something happened and I jumped to the wrong conclusion.",
        "Cristian: That he's gay?",
        "Layla: But he's not. It was a total misunderstanding.",
        "Cristian: Okay.",
        "Layla: We talked it out and everything's fine.",
        "Cristian: Sure.",
        "Layla: I have to get ready for work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: [Sigh] You don't have a lot of faith in me.",
        "Gigi: It's not that.",
        "Rex: Gigi, I love you and Shane. Nothing is going to mess that up.",
        "Gigi: It's simple math, Balsom. There are only so many hours in a day and only so many ways you can stretch and -- I'm sorry, Rex.",
        "Rex: Don't be. I understand you're worried.",
        "Gigi: I'm just trying to protect my son, and me. I know that you're going to do your best, but we both know Stacy.",
        "Rex: I won't let her hurt us.",
        "Gigi: You're not gonna let her work you again?",
        "Rex: No!",
        "Gigi: Where is she living?",
        "Rex: My -- my loft. And she only stays there if she behaves herself. She messes with any of us, she's gone.",
        "Gigi: She'll use the baby, Rex. She doesn't give a damn about that kid for itself. She wants to pull you in. She practically said it right out.",
        "Rex: All the more reason I have to look out for it.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Rex: I'm gonna go over there and lay down some ground rules.",
        "Gigi: And you don't want me to come with you? The more she sees us together as a unit...",
        "Rex: Not today. Just let me smooth things over for now.",
        "Gigi: Right.",
        "Rex: Morasco, everything will --",
        "Gigi: Be fine. I know, I know.",
        "Rex: It will.",

        "Charlie: Hmm, yeah.",
        "Viki: Except it's really hot there now.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Okay. Oh, Europe is covered in tourists until October. You don't want to go there.",
        "Charlie: Well, now, is there any place you haven't been?",
        "Viki: Galapagos!",
        "Charlie: Ooh. You are game, girl.",
        "Viki: I'm game for anything. Charlie, do you realize something? This is the very, very first time since we met that there is no crisis anywhere. We can just take off for months.",
        "Charlie: Oh, months?",
        "Viki: Sure. I mean, the paper runs itself, and you've got Walt and you've got Henry at the construction office. They can cover you, right, while you're gone? We can just get on a boat. Go around the world.",
        "Charlie: Well, it sounds like a dream.",
        "Viki: What is your dream, Mr. Banks?",
        "Charlie: I am living my dream every day. I only wish it had been you... us...all along.",

        "Cristian: He was with Kyle.",
        "Kyle: Fish cared more about what people thought about him than he cared about who he was with.",
        "Layla: [Sigh] See you later.",
        "Cristian: Layla, wait. You got a minute? There's something I think you should know.",

        "Oliver: What, you told her that -- that we --",
        "Kyle: We what? You can't even say it, can you? We were lovers, okay? I loved you. I still do.",

        "Marty: There you go. Are you cruising the furniture?",
        "Starr: Yes, she is. It's gonna be really soon. Then she's gonna start walking. I just want Cole to see her first steps.",
        "Marty: Well, he will, now that he doesn't have to go to prison.",
        "Starr: Yeah. I keep telling myself that him working with John, it can't be worse than prison, right?",
        "Marty: No. No, honey. John's not gonna let anything happen to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look, John McBain is a cop, all right? But he also owns a bar. That guy works for him. John -- John wouldn't train him as a manager because he thinks he's unreliable because of the drugs, but John doesn't know about that.",
        "Man: You and McBain are close.",
        "Cole: Yeah, we -- we were. He's dating my mom, and he acts like a father figure for her sake. I got busted and he didn't do a damn thing to help me.",
        "Man: And yet here you are, out on the street.",
        "Cole: My mom bought a good lawyer.",
        "Man: And now you're tempting the fates.",
        "Cole: Look, I have a felony conviction and no job. Okay? I have expenses. Are we done here?",
        "Man: That's another question. Set the briefcase down.",

        "Schuyler: Well, after you left last night, it wasn't pretty. He actually ordered me to stop being your friend. Yeah, that's what I thought. So, um, yeah, I just -- I came to check up on you. I mean, how was your friend's wedding?",
        "Gigi: I didn't go.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Why not?",
        "Gigi: Because I got this brilliant idea to convince Stacy to get an abortion.",
        "Schuyler: What?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, you heard right. I even showed up with money to pay for it.",
        "Schuyler: Wow. Wow.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. And she looked at me about how you're looking at me now.",
