        "John: Hi, Blair.",
        "Blair: What the hell are you thinking?",
        "John: Something wrong?",
        "Blair: Yeah--you. Is it true?",
        "John: Is what true?",
        "Blair: You're investigating my fianc\u00e9.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Hey, Nora. Just got your message.",
        "Nora: Oh, hi, Elijah. If you just give me a minute, I do have to talk to Bo first.",
        "Eli: Sure.",
        "Nora: Never mind. He's busy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: Nate, why are you here?",
        "Nate: Delivery for the commissioner. You said you're keeping a secret from me. What is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: We need to talk.",
        "Ford: Yeah? What are we gonna talk about? Oh, let me guess. Starr Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: What are you doing here?",
        "James: I had to see you.",
        "Starr: No, this is--this is a bad idea.",
        "James: Why? Is Cole around?",
        "Starr: No. It's bad for me.",
        "James: So he's not here.",
        "Starr: I thought that we agreed that we were going to steer clear of each other.",
        "James: This can't wait. Are you gonna let me in or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm--I'm glad you're here. Um... I have some news.",
        "Todd: Okay, so?",
        "Dani: Yeah, we could use some good news.",
        "T\u00e9a: So could I, mijita, but... but this isn't it.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, just spit it out, okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: I am a little short on time.",
        "Todd: How short?",
        "T\u00e9a: I have a few weeks at the most.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I had a meeting with the commissioner.",
        "Bo: And hey, thanks for getting here so fast with the food. Did they remember the chili fries?",
        "Nate: It's all there. What's wrong?",
        "Bo: Nothing.",
        "Nate: If there's a problem, it's me. My mom never did anything wrong in her entire life.",
        "Inez: Well, that's not true, so just--",
        "Nate: Well, whatever she said, it was probably me. Is she under arrest?",
        "Bo: No.",
        "Nate: Then what's the problem? And why do you look like you're in trouble?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: How'd you find me? I just moved in.",
        "Cole: Your brother made sure Starr knew where he was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Don't look too excited.",
        "Starr: Shh. Would you keep it down? Hope is napping.",
        "James: How's she doing?",
        "Starr: She's great.",
        "James: Bet she's glad to have her mommy back home.",
        "Starr: And her daddy, too. Y-you look better.",
        "James: Bullet-free since July 9th.",
        "Starr: Is that the actual bullet?",
        "James: Yeah, they asked me if I wanted to keep it.",
        "Starr: And you said yes?",
        "James: To remind me how precious life is. No, it gives me mad street cred. I mean, people can be like, \"what is that?\" I'm like, \"it's the cap that they dug out of my gut. What?\"",
        "[Starr laughs]",
        "Starr: Wow. That's great if you're trying to be all gangster.",
        "James: Yeah. Not really. But I guess I'll have to keep it since it reminds me of you.",
        "Starr: Is that what you're doing here.",
        "James: No.",
        "Starr: Then why?",
        "James: I don't know. I was out walking, and I ended up in the park where we first met. And then I ended up at your front door.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "James: Looks like I can't stay away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look, I'm not here to talk about Starr.",
        "Ford: Then what?",
        "Cole: You owe Hannah O'Connor.",
        "Ford: How do you figure that?",
        "Cole: I know what you did to her.",
        "Ford: No. Other way around. She put me in the hospital, nearly killed me. She can rot for all I care.",
        "Cole: Well, you almost got your wish.",
        "Ford: What?",
        "Cole: Hannah tried to kill herself last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: It's about Hannah O'Connor.",
        "Eli: Oh, good. Then I hope you're ready to plead this out, because clearly that girl needs mental health care, not prison time.",
        "Nora: Eli, there's nothing to argue.",
        "Eli: Why not?",
        "Nora: Well, that's why I wanted to talk to you. I got a call this morning from --from St. Ann's.",
        "Eli: What's wrong?",
        "Nora: Hannah O.D.'d last night.",
        "Eli: What?",
        "Nora: Yeah, apparently she got her hands on a bottle of sleeping pills and took all of them.",
        "Eli: She's supposed to be on 24-hour suicide watch in a secure wing. How is that possible?",
        "Nora: I don't know, but there'll be an investigation.",
        "Eli: Yeah, well, an investigation's not gonna bring my client back.",
        "Nora: Oh. Hannah's not gone. Oh, Elijah, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. No, no, no, no, no. Hannah survived.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Why don't you sit down and we'll talk about--",
        "Blair: I don't want to sit down, John. I want you to stand here, look me in the eye, and tell me the truth. Are you investigating Eli?",
        "John: I don't know where you get your information, but--",
        "Blair: Kelly. I'll take that slight hesitation as a yes. Oh, my God. Whose idea was this, anyway? Was it hers? It probably was hers, because I know when she gets an idea in her head, she goes with it and tries to--",
        "John: What exactly did Kelly tell you?",
        "Blair: That the both of you think that Eli is some mass murderer. Oh, my God. You do believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: No. No way. Mom, how can he even know that? You can fight.",
        "T\u00e9a: I-I have...",
        "Dani: No, you will. No, there's gotta be some other treatment that he can do.",
        "Todd: Well, what exactly did he say?",
        "T\u00e9a: He said that I am deteriorating, that treatment can't help me, not now.",
        "Todd: So that's it? We're just supposed to wait?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. No. Um, there is one option, one...one really, really good option.",
        "Dani: Finally. What is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um, it's a hospice. Um, Greg told me about a place that has experience in dealing with cases like mine. Okay, they can take very good care of me and they can keep me comfortable for the next couple weeks.",
        "Dani: So it's like you wouldn't be in any pain?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not much.",
        "Todd: It's okay with me. Is it okay with you?",
        "Dani: Yeah, yeah. Mom, we just want you to be okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, this place sounds like a really excellent facility. They have very good equipment and the best care. They're gonna--they're gonna take care of me and they'll know what to do when things...",
        "Todd: No, no, no. We get it. We're on board. It's fine.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Todd: What's the deal?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, Greg said that he can make arrangements for me to go whenever I want to go.",
        "Todd: When do you want to go?",
        "T\u00e9a: Now.",
        "Dani: Like, tonight?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Okay. Yeah. That means we just have to pack.",
        "Dani: Yeah. Yeah. I can be really fast.",
        "Todd: Me, too.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't have to pack.",
        "Todd: Really? So you gonna go on a shopping spree once we get there, or what?",
        "Dani: We just have to throw some stuff in a bag. Doesn't matter what we wear, right? I mean, we're gonna be spending all our time with you. Where are we going?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um, I can't say.",
        "Todd: Why is that? Oh, no.",
        "Dani: What? What?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mija... your father and you, um, you can't come with me.",
        "Dani: Why won't they let us come to the hospice? That's so stupid. We're your family. You can make them, though, right?",
        "Todd: This has nothing to do with them. This is your mother. She just wants to leave us here.",
        "Dani: No. No way.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, it will be best for everyone, okay?",
        "Dani: How? How would it be good for you to go off and--and no one be there when--no, no, no. That's not the best. That's not the best.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mija, mija... I know this is hard to hear, but it is the truth. When I die, I will not be myself. Whether or not you guys are there with me, I will die alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: I'm sorry. My son is a good boy who worries too much.",
        "Nate: Mom.",
        "Inez: It's fine. I'm not under arrest.",
        "Bo: No, but it might start to look like it. Your mom's coming to work for me.",
        "Nate: Wait, for--for real?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Inez: I have a job.",
        "Bo: Yup. She's my new assistant.",
        "Nate: That's amazing. Ha! I mean, um, that's great news, not that it's surprising. You saw her resume. But still, thank you.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, let's see if you still wanna thank me when she starts putting in all the overtime that we have around here.",
        "Nate: Overtime. Ahem.",
        "Inez: I am going to be the best assistant you've ever had.",
        "Nate: And I guarantee you she won't have anything at home distracting her.",
        "Bo: Ah. So you're not gonna get into any more trouble. No more shootouts.",
        "Nate: No, sir.",
        "Bo: No--for the record, I can't fix parking tickets, okay? Okay. Can you start first thing in the morning?",
        "Inez: Bright and early. Yes.",
        "Nate: So why was this a big secret? Why couldn't you tell me you got the job?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: And she didn't last one night without telling you.",
        "Blair: Come on. You really expected Kelly to keep her big mouth shut? Kelly? I'm just surprised that you even listened to her in the first place.",
        "John: She asked me to investigate Melinda Cramer's murder.",
        "Blair: And since when did my Aunt Melinda's death become a murder?",
        "John: When corpses started showing up every time someone asked a question about her.",
        "Blair: Well, that's just Kelly's conspiracy theory. Why did you buy into it?",
        "John: Do you hear the words coming out of my mouth? We have 2 related deaths.",
        "Blair: Oh, and that makes my fianc\u00e9 some serial killer, John?",
        "John: Blair, I'm just following the evidence.",
        "Blair: No, it doesn't make any sense. Eli is a good man. He's a very successful attorney. Why in the world would he go off to California and kill 2 people he didn't even know in some mental home, or to Boston for some clerk? I mean, what possible reason would he have?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hannah O.D.'d. Now, if I hadn't found her, she would've died. They had to pump her stomach.",
        "Ford: She okay?",
        "Cole: She'll live. They're still trying to figure out how she got her hands on those pills.",
        "Eli's voice: Well, you're right about one thing. No one's ever gonna believe her story because, well, no one's ever gonna hear it.",
        "Ford: What do you mean?",
        "Eli: Let's just say Hannah has been dealt with.",
        "Ford: They sure it would've been a suicide?",
        "Cole: What else would it be?",
        "Ford: I don't know. It's just messed up, even for Hannah.",
        "Cole: Yeah. It just doesn't add up.",
        "Ford: What do you mean?",
        "Cole: Well, I spent a lot of time with Hannah before she confessed. We were on the road together. We talked a lot. And not once did she mention you.",
        "Ford: So?",
        "Cole: It just didn't make sense that she would attack you. A lot of things were bugging her, but not you.",
        "Ford: You don't believe that?",
        "Cole: I just want to hear it from you.",
        "Ford: What?",
        "Cole: Tell me exactly what happened the night she attacked you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Pretty twisted, huh? I'm crazy about the girl who shot me.",
        "Starr: Yes, it is. That's why you should go.",
        "James: If being into you is crazy, I don't want to be sane.",
        "Starr: Did you really just say that? You just sounded crazier than when you were trying to be all gangster.",
        "James: I'm not good at lines. You're making me feel really stupid right now. God, this is bad.",
        "Starr: Okay. That's why you should go.",
        "James: No. How can I go? Look what you're doing to me.",
        "Starr: I have a boyfriend.",
        "James: Do you want that boyfriend?",
        "Starr: This is unbelievable.",
        "James: Okay, I'll go if you want me to, but you need to tell me which Starr is throwing me out.",
        "Starr: Which Starr?",
        "James: Yeah. I mean, there are 2 of you. The girl that I met at the park, she was all emo and she was sad and lonely, but that girl that I went on the run with, I mean, she was kickass and she was passionate and-- and she--she twinkled. And my bet--that's original recipe Starr. And there's no sign of that girl when Cole's around.",
        "Starr: Y...you--you don't-- you don't know.",
        "James: Maybe. Maybe you're right. But if you give me one shot, I can tell you this much-- I'll have one thought every morning that I wake up. That is to make sure...that that sad and lonely Starr never shows her face again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Damn. Yup. You know what? They forgot the salt. I think Carlotta and Nora, they must-- they have this secret plot to keep me on a diet.",
        "Nate: They did send the chili fries.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. Yeah, hey, can you do me a big favor and go over to our break room? See if you can bring me back some salt.",
        "Nate: Sure.",
        "Inez: You're good.",
        "Bo: Hmm. Hmm. Looked like you needed a minute.",
        "Inez: Yeah. He's not gonna let this go.",
        "Bo: Seems like a smart kid.",
        "Inez: He is. I can't say that I'm hiding his brothers from him, but I have to think of something that's not an outright lie.",
        "Bo: Well, Inez, why don't you just tell him the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Are you okay?",
        "Eli: Yeah, yes, I'm just--just worried about my client. You sure Hannah survived?",
        "Nora: Yes. She's--she's unconscious, but--",
        "Eli: Has there been any brain damage?",
        "Nora: They--they don't know, you know? They--they expect her to make a full recovery.",
        "Eli: How is that possible? You said she swallowed an entire bottle of pills, enough to kill her.",
        "Nora: Well, and she would have died, too, had Cole Thornhart not found her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I'm done with this. Go read the police report.",
        "Cole: Why don't you try being a man for 5 minutes?",
        "Ford: All right. Well, there isn't even that much to tell. I was at home asleep and I heard a noise and I woke up. Hannah was standing over the bed and... she has the award in her hand. And I don't even get a chance to ask her why she's there, and she clocks me over the head with it. End of story.",
        "Cole: Did she say anything?",
        "Ford: No. I already told you.",
        "Cole: That you didn't say anything. Did she?",
        "Ford: No. Why are you interested in playing detective all of a sudden?",
        "Cole: Just want to know the truth, that's all.",
        "Ford: Dude, she pushed your mother down the stairs and killed her baby. Then she tried to break up you and Starr?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Ford: All right, so she belongs in St. Ann's or jail. God, you should be spending time with your girl, or somebody else is gonna try and break you up.",
        "Cole: You mean your brother.",
        "Ford: No. No way that happens. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know I can't discuss an ongoing investigation.",
        "Blair: You discussed it with Kelly. You got her in the middle of it.",
        "John: Oh, no, no. She did that and look what happened. Did you say anything?",
        "Blair: I told her she was crazy to suspect Eli of anything.",
        "John: Did you say anything to Clarke?",
        "Blair: That's why you're all clammed up. You're afraid that I'm gonna blab something to Eli, right?",
        "John: That's one reason.",
        "Blair: Well, I would've if it were--it's nonsense!",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "John: It's nonsense? Let me ask you something. Why are you here?",
        "Blair: Because I want you to back off. It's beginning to mess with my life.",
        "John: I hope so.",
        "Blair: Wait a minute. Is this personal, John?",
        "John: Blair...",
        "Blair: Do you have some vendetta against Eli because of me?",
        "John: Listen to me. 3 people are dead. 3. And we have reason to believe that Elijah is involved. So my suggestion to you is keep your distance for now and don't let him suspect anything.",
        "Blair: I won't, because I don't.",
        "John: Good. You want me to talk to you? This is me talking to you. Because you know what? I have no idea how he's gonna react.",
        "Blair: I'm not afraid of Eli. I'd be married to him right now if it weren't for Kelly jumping in the middle of it all.",
        "John: What did you say?",
        "Blair: I said I would be married to him. And I'm not gonna let you and Kelly stop me again, because I will marry Eli.",
        "John: What is--",
        "Layla: Hey, John. I'm back. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "John: No. No worries. How's everything with your mom?",
        "Layla: Not great.",
        "John: What's up?",
        "Layla: Listen, there's no easy way to say this. Evangeline died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: At least I can still hear her. Ha. This is what I have in store for me, okay? In a week or two, I may not even be able to recognize either one of you. I will probably not be able to hear either one of you, and even if I can hear you, I will not be able to understand most probably what you are saying to me. I will most probably be blind at that point, so I won't even be able to see you. And I will have dementia that will make my wedding day look sane, okay?! I know this is harsh and I am very sorry. I'm very sorry. But I want you...to remember me the way I am now. I want you to remember me... as myself.",
        "Dani: What about what we want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You don't know me, James, or Cole. Okay? You have the wrong idea about us. We're good.",
        "James: So all those problems you had before just disappeared when you got back?",
        "Starr: Pretty much.",
        "James: I'm not trying to ruin your life or break up your family. I just got the feeling that that was already happening and not because of me.",
        "Starr: That--that is not fair.",
        "James: No. No, it's not fair. If you don't have any doubts about Cole, then I'll go, okay? But if you do, if what you got is not gonna last, Starr, I mean, couldn't you picture us? Is there any chance for you and I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Evangeline died? How?",
        "Layla: Her respiratory system failed. When Cris and I got there, Vange was on a ventilator. And the doctors said she will never be able to breathe without the machines again. That's not how she wanted to live...so we honored her wishes.",
        "Blair: I'm so sorry, Layla. We will finish up with this later. Excuse me.",
        "Layla: Is there--is there anything I can get for you?",
        "John: Hmm. [Sighs] I should be asking you that.",
        "Layla: Um...I'm gonna go and see if...see what's on my desk. See if my desk is even there. I think it's buried under that mountain of paper.",
        "John: Hey. Layla, no, it's... it's okay. It can wait. Why don't you come in? You have a seat. Please.",
        "Layla: Wine? I thought cops only kept a bottle of scotch or something.",

And... when Evangeline got hurt, I went out and I found a bottle... and I thought, you know, when she got better, when she came home, we'd open it together. So this bottle is for her.
