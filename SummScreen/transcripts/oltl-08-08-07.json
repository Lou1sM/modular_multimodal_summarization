        "Natalie is holding firm on being Miles' loyal friend no matter what anybody says or thinks. At Capricorn, Cristian risks his life to save Sara and it looks like he might have killed Hunter. She is in awe about Cristian risking his life to save hers. Todd is ready to stop at nothing to get into the hospital to see Evangeline. John tells Michael he's found out that Tommy is Todd Manning's child. He tells Michael he is committing a serious crime and regardless of everything, Todd is his real father and Michael is just as bad as Spencer is for taking Todd's son from him. Michael tells his brother that he cannot take Tommy from the only parents he's ever known nor ruin Michael's marriage. John reluctantly agrees to keep his mouth shut."

        "Todd: Hey. Excuse me.",
        "Vincent: I don't think so.",
        "Todd: No, I'm going to see Evangeline.",
        "Vincent: You can't.",
        "Todd: Says who?",
        "Vincent: Me. Now, beat it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: All right, this is it -- your new pad. Not bad, huh?",
        "Miles: Well, it's more than \"not bad.\" But, are you sure your mother's ok with this, because she didn't seem happy about it.",
        "Natalie: Look, she may not be happy about it, but she will be once she gets to know you.",
        "Miles: Todd's her brother, Marty's her good friend.",
        "Natalie: And I'm her daughter -- I hold a much higher rank.",
        "Miles: I can't -- I can't thank you enough for all that you're doing for me, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: It's ok, I'm really glad to help. So, make yourself at home here. You can use it as long as you need it.",
        "Miles: Well, won't be very long if John McBain has his say. He's on a mission to send me to prison for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Don't stop talking on my account, now that I know the truth.",
        "Rex: What truth?",
        "John: Don't play games with me, I know what's going on. Oh Mike. The last thing I want to do is stand in judgment. Mikey, you're my brother and I love you. Tommy's my nephew. But I'm also a cop and this is police business now. Mike, I know who Tommy really is. I know he's Todd Manning's lost son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Groaning]",
        "Sarah: Cristian, no!",
        "[Moaning]",
        "Hunter: Son of a --",
        "Sarah: Hunter. Hunter, say something.",
        "Hunter: Oh --",
        "Sarah: He's dying! Is he dead?",
        "Cristian: He's got a pulse, but it's -- it's weak. If we don't stop the bleeding, he's going to die.",
        "Sarah: What do we do?",
        "Cristian: Call an ambulance. Sarah, call 911 now! Go!",
        "Sarah: Hi. Um -- yeah. There -- there's been a stabbing at the Capricorn club. Someone's hurt really bad. Hurry up, please! What? What -- what's going on?",
        "Cristian: He's gone.",
        "Sarah: Oh. Oh, my God. This isn't happening. This can't be happening. Hunter? Hunter -- why did you do this? Why?",
        "Cristian: Give me your phone. Your phone, Sarah!",
        "Cristian: This is Cristian Vega. I need a cop at -- at Capricorn. I just killed someone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't answer to you, or anyone else for that matter. I'm here to see Evangeline, so you can step aside.",
        "Vincent: Look, I heard you the first time, ok? But unless your name is Williamson, you're not going anywhere near her.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know about the \"family-only\" crap, but I'm an exception.",
        "Vincent: You have to get it cleared by the family and Evangeline's doctors first.",
        "Todd: Did you?",
        "Vincent: No.",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Vincent: Why do you think I'm out here standing here with you?",
        "Todd: You know, I have not seen her for months. So, there's no way I'm not going to visit her.",
        "Vincent: Do you want me to call security, or handle this myself?",
        "Layla: What's going on?",
        "Todd: I'm trying to see your sister.",
        "Layla: Oh, I appreciate it, but we're keeping it to family only.",
        "Todd: You -- you know, this is crazy. She and I are very close -- you know that.",
        "Layla: Hmm. Yeah -- it's doctor's orders, too. Sorry, Todd. You can't go in there.",
        "Vincent: You want me to show him the exit?",
        "Todd: All right, what -- are you going to pick me up and throw me out?",
        "Vincent: Nah. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to have my man Shaun do it for your ass.",
        "Layla: Wait -- no, wait, wait. Todd, just go, all right, and don't cause a scene because you know Evangeline would not like that.",
        "Todd: Well, she wouldn't want her friends kept from her, either.",
        "Layla: You know what? Babe, you better make that call.",
        "Vincent: You know, I think I'll save Shaun the trouble. Why should he have all of the fun, right?",
        "Layla: Thank Y. I'm going in to see Vange.",
        "Vincent: So you still want to do this the hard way?",
        "Todd: All right, how about this? There you go. Will that buy me in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, this is all of it -- not a bad place to park, huh?",
        "Miles: Yeah. I wish I knew for how long.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Here's how it goes, Miles. John can make as much noise as he wants about sending you to prison, but he cannot make that jury convict you.",
        "Miles: Well, he wouldn't have to do much. It's not looking good -- we both know that.",
        "Natalie: Ok, well, I have seen much worse and I have seen them walk. Make yourself comfortable here. Might be here a lot longer than you think.",
        "Miles: I still can't believe what a truly amazing friend you are, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Hey, I'm -- I'm really glad to help. What do I got to lose?",
        "Miles: A lot. I mean, your mother's not comfortable with this, your uncle Todd may never forgive you, John is furious with you. When he finds out you're doing this --",
        "Natalie: Ok, John's going to blow a gasket, I know, but he's mad at me 90% of the time. I am so used to it.",
        "Miles: You sure that's not part of the appeal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It's over, Mike! You know it and I know it.",
        "Michael: No, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "John: Oh, you don't? With this guy's help, you've been carrying this around with you for almost a year now.",
        "Rex: Wait --",
        "John: Shut up. I knew it had to be something big for you to risk everything, and now that I know, I understand why.",
        "Rex: John, listen to me. There's no secret, there's -- there's nothing going on --",
        "John: Don't speak. I only want to hear what my brother has to say. Come on, Mike. Come on. This has been going on since the night Truman got killed. All right? And the way you two were covering for each other, I thought it had something to do with the murder. But that's not it, is it? You were worried because you thought Truman would tell everybody that Tommy is Todd Manning's son.",
        "Michael: Tommy is my son -- mine! I am the only father he has ever known. I am the only father he \"will\" ever know.",
        "John: So it's true?",
        "Michael: I'm your brother, John. If that means anything to you, this will never come up again. You'll take it to your grave.",
        "John: I can't do that, Mike, and you know it.",
        "John: Oh, Mike. I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through right now. But it's out there. Tommy's adoption is completely illegal.",
        "Rex: Is it exactly? I mean, if Michael and Marcie didn't know who Tommy's father was when they adopted him, then it --",
        "John: Mike, I know you don't want to lose him.",
        "Michael: Do you really? Have you ever in your life loved somebody so much that you would break any law in the world for them, to care for them? Do you know what's best for them?",
        "John: What you thought was best.",
        "Michael: Tommy is my son. Marcie and I have raised him since he was practically an infant. We're a family. And I have done what I had to do to keep my family together -- you, of all people, should understand that. You know what it's like to have a family ripped apart!",
        "John: I don't think it's quite like our family, Mike. I don't think you can compare it to the old man being killed.",
        "Michael: Really? Why the hell not? And what's the difference if the end is the same -- a child losing his father? You know what kind of hell that is. You never come back from it, Johnny. You are damaged goods for the rest of your life.",
        "John: I could've helped you, Mike. Why didn't you come to me with this?",
        "Michael: Why the hell do you think? It's always the same thing with you, John. The law comes first, everything else is secondary. I knew what you were going to do, John. I always know what you're going to do, so why the hell would I come to you with this? Why -- so you could take my son away from me a couple months early?",
        "John: I don't want to do it!",
        "Michael: Then don't! God, John, is that going to stop you? He's your nephew. Doesn't that mean anything to you? To take him away from two parents that love him, that he loves so much?",
        "John: If not now, then later! If not me, then somebody else! Think about it, Mike -- is that what you want? You want to spend the rest of your life waiting for some government agency to walk through the door, because that's what's going to happen. And what about Manning? It's his boy. Not only is it illegal, it's morally wrong, as well, Mike.",
        "Michael: You think that Marcie and I are doing wrong by Tommy by giving him more love than any parent ever could? Tell me the truth, John. Do you really believe that Todd Manning could do a better job? Yeah, right! Have you seen his kids? I wouldn't wish that on a rabid dog, let alone a child! But, hey, man, who cares so long as it's all legal!",
        "John: Mike? You think this is easy for me? You think this is what I want?",
        "Michael: Then don't do it!",
        "John: What are you asking me to do? What do you want me to do -- just keep my mouth shut? Is that what you want?",
        "Michael: Yeah, John. It's what I'm asking you to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Who exactly have you been talking to about me?",
        "Miles: What do you mean?",
        "Natalie: Well, I just find it funny because my mom and John both think that the only reason I'm helping you is to stick it and frankly, it's getting insulting.",
        "Miles: I asked you about this before, you remember?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, yeah, and I told you then that this has nothing to do with him, that this is everything about helping you.",
        "Miles: I -- I guess I just don't understand why.",
        "Natalie: Because you've never had a friend before, Miles, and I am not talking about Spencer. I mean, a real friend.",
        "Miles: Look, I'm sorry that I'm even questioning it.",
        "Natalie: Don't worry about it. Hmm. You know how long it took me to trust people?",
        "Miles: How long?",
        "Natalie: Well, I don't know. I can't give you an exact date, but I can tell you it was after months and months of me being a bitch.",
        "Miles: Whew -- come on, I doubt that.",
        "Natalie: Oh, you have no idea. I was manipulative and extremely insecure -- I mean, the whole ugly package. But, for whatever reason, there were these people who took me in and helped me out to be a good person, and I was definitely not easy, but I couldn't shake them. And you know what? I finally just realized that they just cared. Some people are like that.",
        "Miles: Well, you're obviously one of them, but --",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Miles: Well, aren't you worried about what those people are going to think about you for being friends with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: I'm going to let that one slide -- this time.",
        "Todd: All right. What do I have to do, then?",
        "Vincent: Nothing. It just ain't happening. Get over it.",
        "Todd: If Evangeline knew you guys were shutting me out --",
        "Vincent: Well, she doesn't know, ok? She doesn't know anything right now.",
        "Todd: Actually, you're wrong about that. You know that I was in a coma? Yeah. Come to think of it, everyone I know has been in a coma, and I distinctly remember -- and everyone else does, too -- hearing voices from the people that came to visit me. It was -- it was quite a help.",
        "Vincent: It is not your call.",
        "Todd: Whew -- ok. If family doesn't want me there, I'll go. Uh -- may I send flowers?",
        "Layla: What's all this money on the floor?",
        "Vincent: This? Manning tried to buy his way in to see your sister.",
        "Layla: Is he for real?",
        "Vincent: Hmm -- I think he seemed to finally get the message.",
        "Layla: Then he's gone?",
        "Vincent: Yeah. I don't think you'll have to worry about him bothering you or your sister anymore.",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "Vincent: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at you. You're beat. How about if I take you home?",
        "Layla: I'm not tired -- I'm just sad.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, sure you are.",
        "Layla: You know, I don't know what I would do without you here with me. You have been so perfect.",
        "Vincent: That's probably the one thing that nobody has ever called me before.",
        "Layla: No, you are, and thank you for being that right now.",
        "Vincent: Any time, any place. , If you're ready to go, I can drop you off at your home.",
        "Layla: Actually, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: No, Cris. Sorry, buddy, but we can't let either of you go yet.",
        "Second Officer: Not until we get a detective on the scene.",
        "Cristian: Don't worry about it, guys. When your brother's a cop, you know how it works. Excuse me. Can I get you anything? A glass of water, maybe something stronger?",
        "Sarah: Ahem.",
        "Cristian: Look, I'm sorry you had to go through this. But you're going to be ok.",
        "Sarah: Will you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: We came here together. How do you plan on getting home unless I drop you off?",
        "Layla: I don't want you to drop me off, Vincent. I want you to stay.",
        "Vincent: Ok. I could do that. Hey, we could order some food in.",
        "Layla: I'm not hungry.",
        "Vincent: Cool. We could hang. We can watch a movie.",
        "Layla: Vincent --",
        "Vincent: You know --",
        "Layla: Vincent? I don't want to watch a movie or eat or anything. I just want to be with you. Do you get what I'm saying here?",
        "Vincent: Oh, I get what you're saying here. I hope so, but are you sure? You know I don't want to rush you, I don't want to push you, I don't want to do --",
        "Layla: Vincent, I'm a big girl. Shh. Nobody's pushing me or rushing me into anything. I know exactly what I want, and it's you. Come on.",
        "Nurse: What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm fine. I'll be all right.",
        "Sarah: It could've been you, Cris. One random turn of the knife and you would be the one who was dead.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, it -- it wasn't that close.",
        "Sarah: It totally was. I even thought you were the one who got stabbed at first, for trying to save my life. Why -- why would you do that?",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on. I wasn't going to let him kill you.",
        "Sarah: There's this culture somewhere -- I don't really remember, but they say if -- if somebody tries to save your life, then you have to save theirs in return.",
        "Cristian: Let's just hope it doesn't come to that.",
        "Sarah: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Don't make this about us, Mike.",
        "Michael: How can I not? You're my brother. We're talking about my kid. This is all about family.",
        "John: That's what makes this so hard. But as painful as it's going to be for you and Marcie --",
        "Rex: And Tommy -- let's not forget Tommy.",
        "John: You can't keep it secret.",
        "Michael: Why the hell not?",
        "John: Because he's not your kid.",
        "Michael: Well, there you go again with the law. Guess what, Jack -- I don't give a damn about your laws!",
        "John: But I do, Mike! I do -- it's what separates us from the animals! Put yourself in Manning's place for a minute, all right? Whether you like him or not, he thinks his kid is gone, that he's dead. No one deserves to go through that.",
        "Michael: Todd Manning already has two kids. Marcie and I? This is our only shot.",
        "John: Mike, I would do anything to protect you. But you got to give Tommy back, it's the right thing to do.",
        "Michael: Not for Tommy.",
        "John: That's not for you to decide.",
        "Michael: I am as much Tommy's father -- he is as much my son any day of the week as Todd's!",
        "John: No, you're not! You're not, Mike! All right? He didn't give him up. Truman \"stole\" him. He took his kid! Don't you get it? By keeping Tommy from his real family, you're doing that son of a bitch's dirty work for him! And I know -- I know you're too good of a man for that.",
        "Michael: I was. But, Johnny, I love my son. I love him more than I love my own life. And Marcie? This is going to kill her. So, you tell me -- you tell me how I give him up. Huh? Tell me.",
        "John: I don't --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: I'm on call. This is an emergency. Yeah, McBain. Ok, give me the details.",
        "Rex: What do we do now?",
        "Michael: I can't lose my son. My life. And Marcie? This is going to kill her. So, you tell me -- you tell me how I give him up. Huh? Tell me.",
        "John: I don't --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: I'm on call. This is an emergency. Yeah, McBain. Ok, give me the details.",
        "Rex: What do we do now?",
        "Michael: I can't lose my son. I can't lose my wife.",
        "John: Look, there's a -- there's been a stabbing at Capricorn. I got to go. I'm the only detective on duty.",
        "Michael: Please, John. I am begging you -- as your brother, don't do this. If you do this, we lose everything. If we lose Tommy, we lose it all. Marcie and I -- we can never have children. And they are sure as hell never going to give me another adoption, not after what I did. This will kill my wife. It might kill me. So, please, John, if you love me at all -- let me live my life with my child and my wife. Can you do that for me?",
        "John: You do what you got to do, Mike. I got to go.",
        "Michael: Huh. John! John -- what -- what are you going to do?",
        "John: I don't know, Mike.",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "Rex: Maybe you got through to him.",
        "Michael: Oh, God. I hope so. Because if I didn't, I just lost my whole life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Do I look like I give a damn about what other people think about me?",
        "Miles: Uh -- from what you've told me, no.",
        "Natalie: Never have, never will. And if they don't like the fact that I'm helping you -- they're not a real friend.",
        "Miles: Look, I just hope you have some when this is all over, because I'm not going to be around much longer.",
        "Natalie: Ok, stop being so negative. I told you, there's a way out, we'll find it.",
        "Miles: Look, I want you to know that I never meant to hurt anyone. I just -- I messed up.",
        "Natalie: I know. I know that.",
        "Miles: And I keep doing it. I keep hurting the people I care about.",
        "Natalie: God, she really got to you, didn't she?",
        "Miles: Look, if -- if you're going to put Marty down again --",
        "Natalie: I'm not -- I'm not putting her down, ok? You know how I feel about her, but a broken heart is a broken heart, no matter who gave it to you.",
        "Miles: So, what was it like when you lost John?",
        "Natalie: It killed me. Like getting hit by a truck. And I guess after time, the pain wasn't as excruciating. More like a chronic pain that you learn to live with. Like arthritis. Anyway, what are you going to do?",
        "Miles: Oh, great. At least I have something to look forward to.",
        "Natalie: Hmm.",
        "Miles: You know, I'd like living here. It's just I -- I don't want to cause you any more trouble, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Will you chill?",
        "[Miles sighs]",
        "Natalie: Look, I know that my mom's not totally thrilled about it, but she's not going to back out on the deal.",
        "Miles: Maybe not, but when Todd finds out you're putting me up here, he's going to lose it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I was just -- I was visiting my mom, Mary McDonald.",
        "Nurse: Mrs. McDonald is 102.",
        "Todd: Well, no -- did I say \"Mom\"? No, no, no, no. I meant -- I meant -- I meant -- I meant my grandmom.",
        "Nurse: Hmm.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I -- I know it's past visiting hours, but -- but I was -- I was just leaving, I promise.",
        "Nurse: Well, Mrs. McDonald doesn't get a lot of visitors. I'll let it go. But you need to leave now.",
        "Todd: Ok, I -- I'm just very concerned about my -- my grandmother, Mary McDonald.",
        "Nurse: Yeah. Don't push it.",
        "Todd: Evangeline, it's me, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Fellas, give me a couple of minutes. I want to talk to Cris.",
        "Cristian: What do you want to know?",
        "John: First off, how are you?",
        "Cristian: I'll be ok.",
        "John: No easy thing, killing a man.",
        "Cristian: Well, it's not like I haven't done it before.",
        "John: Yeah, well, it messed you up pretty good last time, I recall.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I think this is different.",
        "John: Same end result. It tears you up inside, even for a cop.",
        "Cristian: Whew.",
        "John: Look, go home. Get cleaned up, all right? We'll talk about this later. Better take her with you.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Thanks for being cool about this, huh?",
        "John: Hey, look, just one -- one thing. While you were fighting, this guy happen to say anything to you?",
        "Cristian: Like what?",
        "John: I don't know. He happen to mention Miles Laurence? Anything like that?",
        "Cristian: No. No, all he wanted was money.",
        "John: Ok. Maybe this is just about the money, then. The way this day's been going --",

        "Layla: Ahem.",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "Vincent: You have never looked any more beautiful than you do right now. And I'm not just saying that because, you know --",
        "Layla: I know. I know, Vincent.",

        "Sarah: So what was John McBain asking you about?",
        "Cristian: He was hoping hunter knew something about Todd. It would have explained why he was holding him for all those weeks, and if someone was paying him to do it.",
        "Officer: C.S.U. has the place sealed off. They have more to do here.",
        "John: Looks like everything's by the book. Thanks.",
        "Officer: Is that the guy that held Manning hostage all that time?",
        "John: Yeah, but he was too dumb to do it on his own. Now I got to nail the guy behind it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I really hate that you were in Cristian's studio when that -- freak racist hit town. That was bad timing, wasn't it? And I -- I keep wondering, God, if I had just -- if I had just brought you with me to Chicago, I -- I wonder, would it have happened? Would you still have been there? Yeah, that's a stretch, isn't it? You're always telling me, you know, \"Todd, you're not God.\" And you're right. I'm just a control freak who has no control over anything. Even himself. Especially himself. God, this is -- if there was just something I could have done to keep you out of this room, out of this bed. You know -- when I got the death certificate -- hmm -- my son was -- you know, he was no longer alive -- I -- I really lost it that day. I really -- I really fell apart, and you put me back together. And if it hadn't been for you, I don't think I would have made it through that day. You know, you --",
        "Todd: You gave me strength. You gave me strength. And I'm going to need it now, because I'm starting to -- I'm starting to accept the fact that my son's really dead.",

        "Rex: John's not going to tell anybody Tommy is Todd's son.",
        "Michael: You don't know him like I do. He can't not say anything.",
        "Rex: Ok, there is one thing that we're not considering here. Even if this does all shake out and Todd finds out that you have his son, all it's going to take is one look from him to -- to you and Marcie and Tommy and for him to know that he's better off where he is.",
        "Michael: Come on, you don't believe that any more than I do.",
        "Rex: It's a long shot, I know.",
        "Michael: Todd Manning almost died looking for his son. He wants his little boy back. And when he finds out that we've got him, he's going to come and take him. That is a done deal.",
        "Rex: Not necessarily.",
        "Michael: What are you talking about?",
        "Rex: You remember what we were talking about before John got here? About how, if you took some time off work, and you went out of town with Marcie and Tommy, and never came back?",

        "Miles: I'm an early riser. All the years in the hospital.",

        "Todd: And I know what you'd say if you could talk, though. You'd say, \"Todd, you don't know what happened to your son. You may never find out what happened to your son. Just -- just deal with it. Don't -- don't fly off the handle. Don't go and try to exact revenge on Miles Laurence, or anybody, for that matter. It's pointless.\" And you're right, sweetheart. It's not going to change the fact that my son is gone. But you know me, and I just -- hmm. Somebody out there took my son from me. I just don't know how I'm going to go on living unless I can -- unless I can make that person pay.",
