        "Adriana is with Bruce in his car. He has stopped driving for a while and they talk. She is comfortable with him. He has a lot of questions and she answers most of them. She asks now if she can borrow his phone as she needs to call someone to tell she is coming home. She has left her purse and cellphone back at the cottage since she ran off so fast. Blair wakes realizing that she has slept far too long. Todd says that he probably needs it after spending all that time with her boyfriend. Todd is sure that Starr will get better. Blair wonders if he is going to buy positive results like he did for Evangeline. \"She owes you know.\" Todd denies that. He was simply paying off a debt. \"Mom?\" Todd and Blair turn to Starr and see that she is awake. She falls back asleep right away but her getting up was a good sign. Blair sees the picture that she took from Spencer's apartment, in her purse and she decides that she has to take care of something. \"I will be back!\" she says. Todd tells her to give Spencer his best. Blair calls John arranging to leave the picture for them at the front desk in the hospital. Bo and John pick up the picture and can see right off that the guns in the picture are identical and the same type as the type that shot Thomas McBain. Adriana and Bruce talk for a while. He listens to her story of her boyfriend turned stalker and calls Rex a real sick-o for being that way. She is dying of thirst and asks him if she could possibly buy her something to drink. He returns with water. She guzzles it down and asks if she can use his cellphone again to see if they can get service, so she can call home. \"Whoa,\" she says. She asks if it is hot all of a sudden. He just smiles at her. She can't see straight. Her vision is blurry. \"I have to call home to tell my mother what Rex did.\" Bruce smiles as the effect of the drug take hold. \"Rex didn't do anything It was me!\""

        "Claudia: I don't want a fraction of your kiss to fill my empty heart I will sail on my own don't you have people to do that for you?",
        "Antonio: Oh, a little manual labor never hurt anyone.",
        "Claudia: Hmm. And it sure builds those muscles, huh?",
        "Antonio: Well, I didn't mean to interrupt your rehearsal. Go on, keep singing. You sounded great.",
        "Claudia: Thanks, but I could use a break. So, how's Jessica? Recovered from the trauma?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, pretty much. I'm not sure I am.",
        "Claudia: And yet you let him get away with it. I will never understand that. Kidnapping Jessica and the baby?",
        "Antonio: Well, now, excuse me, Claudia, but i didn't let him get away with it. If you remember, I wanted to have him arrested, but Jessica refused. She felt sorry for him, I guess.",
        "Claudia: Could it be the Tess part of her is still in love with Nash?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Good morning.",
        "Jessica: Hi, Nash.",
        "Nash: Came here for breakfast?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but actually --",
        "Nash: But if you'd known I was here, you would've gone somewhere else.",
        "Jessica: No. Actually, it's fine.",
        "Nash: Who's taking care of Brennan?",
        "Jessica: Antonio's mom and actually, it's Bree.",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- Antonio and I decided to start calling her Bree instead of Brennan, so it's going to be Bree Buchanan.",
        "Nash: So now my daughter doesn't have any part of my name at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Welcome back, boss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Starr?",
        "Todd: No, there's no change. Sorry.",
        "Blair: Todd, you were -- you're not supposed to let me sleep this long. You were supposed to wake me up so you could get some rest.",
        "Todd: No, that's ok. I'm sure you need it more than I do. I don't imagine you get much sleep when you spend the night with your boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Clint! I -- I -- I was just hoping that you would stop by. I -- well, you must've read my mind. Bless your heart.",
        "Clint: How's Starr?",
        "Dorian: Much the same. Uh -- Blair and Todd are in there with her now. Did you have a chance to see Asa?",
        "Clint: Yeah. I stopped by there. There's no change there, either.",
        "Dorian: , I'm so sorry.",
        "Clint: Yeah. I was wondering -- does Adriana know about this?",
        "Dorian: About Starr?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: No -- no, she doesn't.",
        "Clint: Well, when she finds out, she's going to want to come back.",
        "Dorian: Oh, oh, certainly. But then, of course, in the meantime, I know that Rex is taking very good care of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Damn it! All I did was try to protect you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: This is the last station for a while.",
        "Adriana: It's not open yet.",
        "Man: Doesn't look like it.",
        "Adriana: So, what do we do -- wait?",
        "Man: Can't get anywhere without good old gas.",
        "Adriana: None of this looks familiar. I don't think this is the way Rex and I drove up. Is it a shortcut?",
        "Man: No, actually, it's a slightly longer route, but it avoids a lot of the early morning commuter traffic.",
        "Adriana: So what time do you think it opens -- the station, I mean?",
        "Man: I don't know -- there's no sign anywhere. It shouldn't be long, though.",
        "Adriana: Let's hope.",
        "Man: So, if you don't mind me asking, why would a nice girl like you be hitchhiking alone so late at night? Don't you know, young lady, how dangerous that can be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Place is blue.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Bo: I almost didn't recognize it.",
        "John: That'll teach you to leave.",
        "Bo: Oh, man, you know what? Bad thing -- they took out all the -- all the nails when they painted the place.",
        "John: Yeah, I got a -- I got a hammer and some nails in my office. I'll drop it by later.",
        "Bo: All right. You know what? Um -- all of this can wait. Do you know what I want to do right now? I want to get back to doing my job.",
        "John: I understand. I'll tell you what -- I'll let you get back to work then, Commissioner. Hey, actually, I meant to ask -- how's Starr doing?",
        "Bo: No change, really, but, you know, I'm sure as soon as she comes around, then Blair's going to be right back on her mission to nail Spencer.",
        "John: She is determined to make it up to manning, isn't she?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Truman's messed with a lot of people's lives.",
        "John: It's going to end, Bo -- soon.",
        "Bo: You got something on him?",
        "John: I haven't got a handle on it yet, but I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Don't start in about Spencer, not now.",
        "Todd: I just want him away from my daughter.",
        "Blair: Well, I don't think you're going to have to worry about that, Todd. Spencer -- well, Starr doesn't want anything to do with him, and that's just fine with me.",
        "Todd: Well, you don't mind she doesn't like him, huh?",
        "Blair: I didn't say that. I just don't think that we should be talking about it right now, that's all. Hey, baby. Can you hear me?",
        "Todd: She's going to be fine.",
        "Blair: You sound confident.",
        "Todd: I am.",
        "Blair: What are you going to do, Todd -- bring in one of those expensive specialists and buy a positive outcome?",
        "Todd: What is that supposed to mean, Blair?",
        "Blair: Well, you did it for Evangeline -- bought her eyesight. Must've been mighty expensive.",
        "Todd: Do you have a point?",
        "Blair: Just that she's going to owe you now.",
        "Todd: No, I owed her. And I always pay back my debts.",
        "Blair: Yeah, well, so do I.",
        "Todd: Hmm. Too bad you and I don't want the same things anymore, Blair.",
        "Blair: Oh, I think we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah, I forgot -- the \"new and improved\" Dorian.",
        "Dorian: I beg your pardon?",
        "Clint: Well, the other day, you went on about Rex, how if he's making your daughter happy, you're all for it.",
        "Dorian: And you don't think I meant it?",
        "Clint: Oh, no, I -- I think you meant it in the moment, but I was just wondering how long this is going to last.",
        "Dorian: I hope for a very long time, a long while. She said she's in love with him, and, well, he's obviously very committed to her, so who -- who am I to object?",
        "Clint: Yeah, he has gone out of his way to protect her.",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. Um -- you know, this -- this danger does seem to be ongoing, and, well, I've put aside my personal concerns for Adriana just for the greater good, besides which I'm very grateful to Rex for taking this whole stalker threat very seriously.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I know hitchhiking's risky, but I was desperate.",
        "Bruce: I could see that.",
        "Adriana: You were right before. It was my boyfriend -- well, ex-boyfriend.",
        "Bruce: Oh, what happened? Did he hurt you?",
        "Adriana: No, not physically. Look, I don't want to bore you with the whole story.",
        "Bruce: You bore me? I don't think so. Go for it. It might help to vent, you know? Besides, I'm one of those really good listeners.",
        "Adriana: Look, I'm really grateful that you came when you did and that you were my neighbor from down the beach. Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten in the car with a strange man.",
        "Bruce: I'm not that strange, at least not until you get to know me -- bah!",
        "Adriana: Um -- I have another favor to ask.",
        "Bruce: Sure.",
        "Adriana: I left in such a hurry that I didn't take my phone, my purse, nothing. And I was wondering if I could borrow your phone. I'd really like to call home and tell my mom I'm on my way. You mean you haven't tried honey bunches of oats yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Tess hasn't been out in a while.",
        "Claudia: But what if she were to come out?",
        "Antonio: She won't. She won't, all right? Jessica's close to being integrated, and when she is, she'll finally have all of Tess' memories. All right? And then she'll finally realize that Nash used Tess the same way he used you.",
        "Claudia: Nash is pretty smooth. It's really hard for a girl not to believe every word he says.",
        "Antonio: Well, you know how dangerous he is. Otherwise, you wouldn't have helped me find him in New York.",
        "Claudia: I was glad to do that, but please, Antonio. Nash cannot know that I helped you.",
        "Antonio: I understand.",
        "Claudia: Yeah, I mean, his scary temper -- god only knows what he would do to me.",
        "Antonio: Listen, no worries, ok? I'm not going to let Nash get anywhere near you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Nash, we didn't change her name.",
        "Nash: Antonio put you up to this?",
        "Jessica: No, he didn't! Let me explain --",
        "Nash: I should have known!",
        "Jessica: Nash!",
        "Nash: He couldn't take my daughter having my name.",
        "Jessica: Stop it, ok? Let me explain. We didn't change her name. It's just --",
        "Nash: It's just at Antonio --",
        "Jessica: It's a nickname!",
        "Nash: Ah.",
        "Jessica: That's it! It's a nickname.",
        "Nash: It's a nickname.",
        "Jessica: We just thought it would be nice.",
        "Nash: Because Antonio hated calling her Brennan because it reminded him that she's my daughter.",
        "Jessica: Is that really so hard for you to understand?",
        "Nash: No. And I promise not to cause any more trouble, and that's all I'm going to say.",
        "Jessica: Well, I appreciate that.",
        "Nash: Sure. You know, you're lucky I'm being a lot cooler about this than Tess would have.",
        "Jessica: Well, tell me -- what would Tess be saying and doing right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What is it we both want, Blair?",
        "Blair: For Starr to wake up. What'd you think I meant?",
        "Todd: I don't know. All right. U don't want to tell me, doesn't matter.",
        "Starr: Mom? Dad?",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bruce: You're more than welcome to use my cell phone, but you're going to have to hold off till we get back on the main road. I drive this route all the time -- signal in this area is pretty shaky.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Ok, I'll -- I'll wait.",
        "Bruce: So, if you're up for it, you could tell me your story. It'll pass the time, right? You seem pretty upset about something, so, like I said, it might help to talk about it. I know it always helps me.",
        "Adriana: It's so strange.",
        "Bruce: What is?",
        "Adriana: I thought Rex and I were really connected. You know? It just felt right. We had the same sense of humor, we're attracted to each other. It just worked, you know? We loved each other and totally trusted each other.",
        "Bruce: So what happened?",
        "Adriana: Well, I'd done some modeling and --",
        "Bruce: I knew it, I knew it. You sure are pretty enough.",
        "Adriana: Thank you, but it's not like I had a career or anything. I mean, I had done a couple of magazine covers, nothing big, but it was enough to get me a stalker. Can you believe that?",
        "Bruce: A stalker? No, you're kidding.",
        "Adriana: I wish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Blair, that is so wonderful. She woke up, she said your name.",
        "Blair: She did, and, well, she passed right back out again, but the doctor's in there, and we'll just have to wait and see. I -- I know I'm a mess.",
        "Dorian: Well, I -- I do have tissues --",
        "Blair: No, I've --",
        "Dorian: Compact?",
        "Blair: I've got a bunch of them right here, actually. Um -- tell you what. I actually need to take care of something, so if you'll excuse me. Todd? I'll be right back. I'm going to go get some fresh air.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Give my love to Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Truman seems to have covered all his tracks, huh?",
        "John: He's feeling confident right now. That's when guys like that make mistakes.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "John: Look, I -- I'll let you get back to work.",
        "Bo: No, no, no, no, no. Come on, no, no, no. You know what it is -- Balsom. I -- I thought he'd call me this morning.",
        "John: Why is that?",
        "Bo: Well, Adriana took off from where they were staying.",
        "John: Took off?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah -- ok, what Balsom said, which really didn't make a lot of sense -- I'll give you the short version. Apparently, she thought he w hooked up with this guy that's been stalking her, and she freaked and -- and took off. She didn't have a wallet, no cell phone, no -- no anything. And this ferry boat captain? He said nobody matching her description took the ferry back to the mainland last night.",
        "John: So she must still be on the island.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Hopefully, she's just hiding from Balsom, and then she's going to reach out. She's going to call Dorian -- soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey! Hey, hold up! Stop! Why are you -- I just want to talk!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bruce: You must've been scared out of your pretty little head.",
        "Adriana: More scared than I've ever been in my entire life. And I thought like an idiot that my boyfriend was trying to protect me from the big, bad stalker.",
        "Bruce: Well, if he's any kind of man, I'm sure he was.",
        "Adriana: That's what he wanted me to think, too. Then, I found out that the emails fm the stalker came from Rex's computer.",
        "Bruce: Oh, wait. Are you trying to tell me you think your boyfriend was stalking you?",
        "Adriana: No. I mean, that's what I thought at first, then I realized that that's impossible, but I do think that he set it all up -- the emails, the attacks, everything.",
        "Bruce: Why would he do that?",
        "Adriana: So he could rescue me and be my hero.",
        "Bruce: That's sick. No wonder you ran away. And believe me, honey, you are better off without him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Sorry, Bo. I know you're against this, but have no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I know exactly what Tess would be saying, but I don't think you want to hear it.",
        "Jessica: Well, I asked, didn't I?",
        "Nash: All righty. Ahem. She would be pissed that you decided to give her daughter, who she named, a nickname. She would think that was completely unfair. So, she'd get upset. She would call Antonio a jerk and a creep and a sneak, and then I would try to calm her down, and she'd throw her hands in the air and get pissed at me and call me a jerk and a sneak and a creep and probably worse. But then she would realize that I'm not the one she should've been mad at, so she'd start apologizing for having lashed out at me. And then we'd make up, and we'd end up in bed, making love. That happened a lot.",
        "Jessica: Is that supposed to make me jealous or something?",
        "Nash: Now, why would that make you jealous?",
        "Jessica: Hearing about all of the wonderful sex that you and Tess have, ok? Why would I be interested in that? Why would I care?",
        "Nash: I don't know -- you asked. I was just about to ask you why you were so curious. You've never wanted to talk about this before.",
        "Jessica: Well, because I had another memory last night about Tess when you were on the phone to that lawyer guy.",
        "Nash: The one who put the drug in Tess' drink?",
        "Jessica: I got to go. Carlotta needs to --",
        "Nash: Jessica, please -- hey. After Bruce put that drug in Tess' drink, do you remember what happened next?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: It's sweet of you to be so protective of me, Antonio. But I -- I'm not in any danger from Nash.",
        "Antonio: But you just said that if Nash found out you helped me --",
        "Claudia: That he would lose his temper, and he would, but I can take him. You know, I mean, I've learned how to handle his little temper tantrums.",
        "Antonio: Hey, I'm sorry. We're closed. I said we're closed.",
        "Claudia: Oh, no, I must've forgotten to relock the door after I came in.",
        "Man: You the owner?",
        "Antonio: Well, that depends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well, what do you want me to be -- hysterical? And how would that possibly help anything?",
        "Clint: I don't know, but are you telling me that you're not the least bit worried about your daughter?",
        "Dorian: Well, of course I'm worried about her. I always worry about all of my girls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. It plays into all his insecurities.",
        "Bruce: How so?",
        "Adriana: Well, Rex always saw himself as the bad guy, you know, the screw-up, and I think this w his way of turning himself into the good guy in my eyes. He's totally warped, but I guess he was desperate -- so desperate that he didn't care about the nightmare he was putting me through.",
        "Bruce: Sounds to me like you're not going to be able to forgive him.",
        "Adriana: I really shouldn't be going on like this. All I want to do is get home, although I don't know why. All my mother is going to do when I get there is say \"I told you so.\"",
        "Bruce: Yeah, but at least you know your mother loves you and that she's only looking out for your best interests.",
        "Adriana: I suppose.",
        "Bruce: Well, looks like someone's pulling in -- must be the guy who runs the station. I'll get us some gas, we'll be on our way.",
        "Adriana: Great. Would you mind -- I'm so thirsty. Um -- would you mi getting me a bottle of water? I'm sorry that I can't even pay you for it --",
        "Bruce: Don't even finish that sentence. I'd be more than happy to get you anything you want.",
        "Adriana: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Mc Bain.",
        "Blair: Hey, it's me, Blair.",
        "John: What have you got?",
        "Blair: I found a photograph -- it was in Spencer's dresser. He was much younger, he was with his dad, and they had matching guns.",
        "John: Where are you?",
        "Blair: I'm at the hospital with Starr.",
        "John: How is she?",
        "Blair: She's the same. But I left the picture in an envelope at the main desk for you, ok?",
        "John: Right. Hey -- thanks.",
        "Blair: Ok. Got to go.",
        "Evangeline: Yes? Oh.",
        "Blair: I'm sorry. I should've knocked. I'm just a little rattled.",
        "Evangeline: Of course. How's Starr?",
        "Blair: There's no change.",
        "Evangeline: You must be out of your mind with worry. I just -- I pray you get some good news soon.",
        "Blair: Well, I pray it's as wonderful as you getting your eyesight back.",
        "Evangeline: I can't -- I can't even describe how I feel.",
        "Blair: Hmm. All because of Todd, right?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I'm -- I'm just so grateful to him for everything he's done for me.",
        "Blair: And why do you think that he's doing all of this for you, Evangeline?",
        "Evangeline: I'm not sure I follow.",
        "Blair: Hmm. Maybe you can follow this -- do you think he's having real feelings for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Hey, you said you wanted to remember.",
        "Jessica: I have to go.",
        "Nash: Jessica, please. Bruce put the drug in your drink at my place.",
        "Jessica: Not my drink -- Tess' drink!",
        "Nash: Ok. He put the drug in Tess' drink. Then?",
        "Tess: This looks like mine.",
        "Bruce: Yeah, bottom's up.",
        "Nash: Don't! Get your slimy mitts off of her.",
        "Bruce: See, she's not worth it. She's all yours.",
        "Tess: Just a 411 -- I'm not yours, not even a little.",
        "Nash: Oh, I know. And that is just about the one good thing about this day.",
        "Tess: Well, then, what was that about just then?",
        "Nash: He slipped you a roofie, all right? You're about to hit the dirt in two -- seconds.",
        "Jessica: He tried to rape her. How could you get involved with somebody like that?",
        "Nash: Because Bruce gets stuff done and I was desperate to get back with the woman I love, the woman you're trying to remember being.",
        "Jessica: That's not what I said, Nash! Ok? I -- I want to know about your memories --",
        "Nash: Why?",
        "Jessica: Of your time with Tess.",

        "Jessica: Because I need those memories.",
        "Nash: Why?",
        "Jessica: Can you let me finish?",
        "Nash: You were about to say that you need those memories to help you integrate, but I think you're curious. You're curious about what your life was like when you were with me.",
        "Jessica: No!",
        "Nash: Well, what do you want me to say? We were happy. We were good together. We trusted each other, we relied on each other and I hate to tell you this, but we made each other happy in bed, but then I already told you that, didn't I?",
        "Jessica: Stop it, Nash!",
        "Nash: Why? Why is it so hard for you to hear, Jessica?",
        "Jessica: Because you keep on using words like \"we,\" like I was there, like you made love to me, and that's not true! I wasn't there!",
        "Nash: Well, I guess it depends how you look at it, doesn't it? I mean, it sure looked like your face and your body, so if it wasn't you, who was it?",
        "Jessica: You're unbelievable. You don't want to help me, you don't care about me. You just want your precious Tess back.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I do! I want Tess back. I'm being honest with you -- I always have been.",
        "Jessica: This conversation's over.",

        "Dorian: Yes. Uh -- I mean, I -- I -- I was all right about it as long as Rex seemed to be making her happy, but now that that's no longer true, well, I not only feel vindicated, I feel relieved.",

        "Todd: Oh, well, I appreciate that, but I don't think that's going to be necessary. She's looking better, and she's going to wake up anytime, I think, and she's -- be back to her old, beautiful self.",
        "Evangeline: She is such a strong kid.",
        "Todd: Yeah, she really is. She and jack -- man, I'll tell you what. They're the best things that ever happened to me. You know, when I was on death row, thinking about them, that was the only thing that kept me going.",
