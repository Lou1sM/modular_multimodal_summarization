        "Judge: Dr. Saybrooke, how do you plead?",
        "Cole's voice: If you plead guilty, that's it. Then the only question left is how much time you have to serve. Then John will have to stop looking for the real killer.",
        "John's voice: Listen to me -- the only way you can legitimately plead guilty is if you remember delivering the fatal blow, which you can't. You know that means? It means the real killer is still out there. Do you really want to take the rap for whoever that is?",
        "Tara: Your honor, my client pleads --",
        "Marty: Not guilty. Your honor, I wish to plead not guilty.",
        "Judge: I will now hear arguments for and against bail.",

        "Judge: A.D.A. Pollock, save the editorializing for the trial.",
        "Griffin: Given the nature of this crime and the defendant's subsequent actions, I have no choice but to request remand. Anything less would put the citizens of Llanview at risk, most notably the defendant's own husband.",

        "Miles: Yeah, right -- like pictures of me with my lawyer, my trial, and brainstorming with him.",
        "Natalie: You and me shooting pool.",
        "Miles: Really? I've never played pool before.",
        "Natalie: Well, there's a first time for everything.",

        "Natalie: Miles, I'm sorry -- you don't have to accommodate me. I mean, this is your home. You' here as long as you want to be here.",
        "Miles: No, look, you've been so generous, and I'm going to try to make this stay as short as possible.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- well, did someone give you some grief?",
        "Miles: No, I haven't even been here a week and I'm already causing trouble.",

        "Todd: Yeah, she's fine -- there's no change there. It's just Viki.",
        "Dorian: What? There's something wrong with Viki?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Yeah, we, you tell me, man. I -- whoever's squatting at Llanfair is not my sister. I just -- I don't know what's going on with her.",
        "Blair: What do you mean by that?",
        "Todd: Well, I don't know. She's just -- she's crazy, she's out of her mind. I don't recognize her.",
        "Blair: Well, Todd, her daughter, Jess, is getting over liver cancer.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but Jessica's fine now, isn't she?",
        "Dorian: I'll tell you what's wrong with Viki. Two words -- David Vickers. Yes. She made a play for him.",
        "Blair: Hmm -- Dorian.",
        "Dorian: She was trying to make me jealous so she could sabotage my relationship with Clint, so -- yeah. She invited him to move with her.",
        "Blair: That's ridiculous!",
        "Todd: At Llanfair?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm, yeah, absolutely. That's how desperate she is for male companionship.",
        "Blair: Dori-- Dorian, that is not how it happened, no. Dorian kicked David out, so Viki asked David -- he had no place else to go, so she let him stay there. She's still the sanest woman we know.",
        "Todd: Not since she let Miles Laurence move in.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Yes. Miles Laurence is now living at Llanfair -- yes. I need your help to save my sister and bury that son of a bitch.",
        "Blair: All right, back it up here a minute. Are you telling me that Miles Laurence is living at Llanfair?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I found him raiding her fridge this morning.",
        "Dorian: Viki has always been unpredictable, but --",
        "Todd: Yes, tell me about it. I don't know -- maybe she just snapped under all the pressure with Jessica.",
        "Dorian: Number eight and counting.",
        "Blair: Oh, stop it! Viki's not having some kind of personality split.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: Did it ever occur to the two of you that maybe she's doing this to help you, Todd? Maybe she's lulling Miles Laurence into some kind of false sense of security so he'll spew about what happened to your son!",
        "Todd: No, no, that's not it. According to Viki, she's doing it for her idiot, redheaded daughter.",
        "Dorian: Natalie?",
        "Todd: Yes, and when I am done with Natalie, she's going to wish she never crawled out of that trailer park.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, what exactly did Todd say?",
        "Miles: He wasn't thrilled to see me in Viki's kitchen ready to make breakfast.",
        "Natalie: So, basically, he just huffed and puffed?",
        "[Miles sighs]",
        "Miles: No, he -- he made some embarrassing accusations. And he forced Viki to take sides, which she did. She chose yours, so I'm still here.",
        "Natalie: Look, don't be scared of Todd.",
        "Miles: Look, I -- I'm not. It's just the only reason I care about him is because he's part of your family. I mean, you and Viki -- you're going to have to deal with the fallout from all of his --",
        "Natalie: Temper tantrums? Yeah, I know -- we're used to it.",
        "Miles: Well, you didn't just see him now. He -- he feels betrayed.",
        "Natalie: Huh -- betrayed? That's a laugh.",
        "Miles: Look, I'm serious.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, so am I. Letting your friend stay somewhere when they have no other place to go is not betrayal, but what is would be oh, I don't know -- your uncle handing you over to some maniac to cut your heart out?",
        "Miles: What, Todd did that to you?",
        "Natalie: Let's just say he doesn't have a leg to stand on. Like I told you before, I can handle him. Tara: Your honor, please direct counsel to stick to the crimes with which my client has actually been charged.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Wow. They're really going after your mom hardcore.",
        "Judge: A.D.A. Pollock.",
        "Griffin: Your honor, the defendant has accused her husband of coercing her into marriage.",
        "Tara: I don't see what relevance that has to this matter \u0096",
        "Griffin: She believes he blackmailed her using his knowledge of the crime. Now, is it so far-fetched to think that, if freed, Dr. Saybrooke would exact revenge on her husband in the same manner that she did the deceased victim?",
        "Tara: Dr. Saybrooke is a respected medical professional with no criminal history.",
        "Griffin: So was Spencer Truman.",
        "Tara: The prosecution's case is based on a shaky, unsubstantiated confession.",
        "Griffin: Which Dr. Saybrooke took months to make, allowing an innocent man to languish in jail for her crime.",
        "Tara: Didn't that man confess, too?",
        "Griffin: The bottom line, your honor -- Dr. Saybrooke just moved to Llanview last year. Her connections to the community are few.",
        "Tara: She's from Llanview. She has a thriving practice here and is raising her son here.",
        "Griffin: Yeah, who is a material witness in this and another pending case. Your honor, if you release her on bail, you run the risk of her flight.",
        "Judge: All right. Thank you both. I've reached my decision.",

        "Michael: Uh-huh.",
        "Marcie: You know, when I took that gig at Llanview High School, I thought, \"oh, my God. Two months of vacation. Do you know what I could do with two months of vacation?\" I -- I could start my next novel, I could check out preschools for this little guy here. I could go to the gym, although who wants to go to the gym? Let's be serious. And now it's almost two months later and I haven't barely scratched the surface of any of those things.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: And then the sky turned green and it started raining gargoyles.",
        "Michael: Oh -- terrible.",
        "Marcie: You haven't heard a word I said to you.",
        "Michael: I'm sorry, Marcie. I -- I guess I'm just -- Michael and",
        "Marcie: Worried about a patient.",
        "Michael: Jinx?",
        "Marcie: Michael, what's going on here?",
        "Michael: I just said --",
        "Marcie: Yeah, you just said what you always say to me. This patient isn't in a hospital. It's me, it's you, and our son. Our family is this close to being on life support and you don't even know it.",

        "Jessica: Yeah, you have no idea.",
        "Antonio: Oh, actually, I think I do.",
        "Nash: You comfortable? Could I get you something? Could I --",

        "Jessica: Oh. Really? She loves that.",

        "Jessica: Oh, she's great. She's talking up a storm. I know that she would love to see Jamie at some point, if that --",
        "Antonio: Look, I don't want to punish the girls for what happened. I really don't, but I don't want to confuse them, either.",
        "Jessica: Of course not.",
        "Antonio: Look, the -- to be perfectly honest with you, we've severed just about every tie between us except one. And I think it's time to cut that one, too. So this is the first room that I've worked on.",

        "Antonio: I had my share of the place appraised. That's what it's worth.",
        "Nash: You're selling out.",
        "Antonio: Yes.",
        "Nash: Just like that?",
        "Antonio: A lot of things happen just like that.",
        "Jessica: Antonio, if you want to punish someone --",
        "Antonio: It's fair market value.",
        "Nash: Ha -- for a controlling share in my business?",
        "Antonio: That's why I came here first -- to make you the offer. That's what I'll sell it for.",
        "Nash: Well, it's -- I'll work it out. Give me a week.",
        "Antonio: I don't have to give you anything. That's the last tie between us. If you can come up with the money, fine. I'm glad you're out of the hospital. I hope David's liver serves you better than mine.",

        "Miles: Hmm.",
        "Natalie: It's Monte Carlo night, you know. You get to gamble -- for a good cause, for the children in Angel Square -- and it's also my coming out party as a representative of B.E. so I just thought it'd be kind of cool to have a friend there to celebrate with or run interference, whichever comes first.",

        "Marty: Yeah, I know. I know you don't need me, you don't need my help -- I understand, but if I don't find some way to feel useful in here, I think I'm going to go crazy, so -- what do you say? You want to help me out and tell me what's eating away at you?",

        "Michael: Then you know what I'm talking about.",
        "Marcie: Then you need to give me some credit here! Whatever's going on between you and John, it's just not a couple of brothers throwing back beers and going at it! This is serious, and it is frustrating because you refuse to tell me what's going on!",

        "Nash: Ca-choo-choo! There we go -- no, that is my signature wine. We don't skimp on it. Eat -- ok.",

        "Jessica: But if we subcontract the bottling phase of the operation, then we can save some money that way.",
        "Nash: Choo-choo! Absolutely not -- it's too risky, all right? They -- they miss a shipment, something gets into the wine -- no. We got to keep the entire operation here so that we can control the quality. All right?",
        "Jessica: Ok, well, then I'm out of ideas.",

        "Nash: No -- sorry. It smacks of my relationship with Claudia, all right?",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I know that you're not comparing me to Claudia, right?",
        "Nash: No, I am not. I am comparing me to the man I used to be when I was with Claudia -- taking advantage of rich women for their money.",
        "Jessica: Well, you're not that man anymore.",
        "Nash: No, I'm not, and the only way to make sure that I am never confused for that man again is to never put myself in that situation again, ok? No.",
        "Jessica: So your mind's made up?",
        "Nash: Yep. Mad?",

        "Natalie: Your wife is having your marriage annulled. I really don't think you're going to be hurting her feelings.",

        "Natalie: My other guests are going to be worried about Texas hold 'em all night. They're not going to be paying attention to the man that's on my arm. Come on! Come out and have some fun, stop hiding.",

        "Clint: Ah. All right, now this fourth card I'm turning over -- ahem.",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "Clint: It's called \"the turn.\" Now, honey, um, do you remember what hand beats what hand and everything like that, or do we need to review?",
        "Dorian: Well, you know, um -- there are -- there are pairs, there are -- there are straights.",

        "John: Well, if you knew them, I'm not sure you could compare our situations.",
        "Marty: I don't know -- the principle sounds pretty much the same. I had a choice -- keep quiet, protect my son, or come clean. Well, I kept quiet and I ended up hurting my son, anyway.
