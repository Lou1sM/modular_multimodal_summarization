        "Rachel: Hello to you, too.",
        "Schuyler: Rachel, what the hell am I doing around people? I belong on a mountaintop somewhere way the hell away from anything remotely connected to human civilization.",
        "Rachel: What happened?",
        "Schuyler: I did something stupid. I did something really, completely, totally stupid.",
        "Rachel: Well, don't go running off to a monastery just yet, okay? Everybody is entitled to a bad day.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Yeah, see, that's the thing. It actually wasn't all that bad. I mean, for this brief shining moment I was on top of the world.",
        "Rachel: When was that?",
        "Schuyler: When I kissed Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Schuyler kissed you?",
        "Gigi: It really isn't a big deal, Rex.",
        "Rex: Well, if it isn't a big deal, why are you telling me about it?",
        "Gigi: Because I don't want there to be any secrets between us.",
        "Rex: Great! I'll sleep much better knowing that you were making out with another man.",
        "Gigi: I didn't make out with anyone; Schuyler kissed me.",
        "Rex: What were you doing encouraging him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Blair: Stop it. Stop it. Just--oh, please.",
        "Dorian: How--how could you do that to me? How could you ever, ever do such a thing to me? Do you have any idea where I spent the night? Well, I well tell you. I woke up in the rectory! In the rect--I hope my former son-in-law doesn't hear about this. Oh, yes! Some well-meaning priest found me asleep in the church, and he thought I'd be better off sleeping it off in the rectory! So that's where I-- how could you do that?!",
        "Blair: I am sorry, but I wasn't in my right frame of mind. Okay?",
        "Dorian: Oh, yeah. But I can tell you this much. No matter how bad your night was, mine was 10 times worse, okay?",
        "Dorian: Really?",
        "Blair: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Honey, tell me what happened.",
        "Blair: Oh. Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Ah. Wow. Some honeymoon.",
        "Viki: I can think of worse places to go.",
        "Todd: It's not really what I would expect after the--what do they call it?-- The highly anticipated nuptials.",
        "Viki: For your information, Charlie's working on a huge construction project. Once he is free, I promise you we are going to go to some wonderful, exciting locale, huh?",
        "Charlie: Though probably not as exciting as the wedding.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Todd: Hey, I have to mention I'm sorry about Blair last night. I mean, she's just--",
        "Viki: She was upset with you.",
        "Todd: Did she tell you that?",
        "Viki: She didn't have to. What happened?",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Do you think T\u00e9a's gonna use that info about my mom and dad kissing to try to drop the case?",
        "Matthew: Hey, Mom. Dad.",
        "Bo and Nora: Hi.",
        "Bo: You mind if we talk to Matthew?",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course. Nora, I'm sorry that you have to spend your first day of married life in court.",
        "Nora: No, you're not.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "Bo: Son? You know whatever happens, we love you.",
        "Nora: Always. Always.",
        "Matthew: I love you guys, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: T\u00e9a Delgado, attorney for Matthew Buchanan.",
        "Elijah: Elijah Clark. Looking forward to sparring with you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I don't think there'll be any sparring.",
        "Elijah: No need for false modesty, Ms. Delgado. Your reputation precedes you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not modest, false or otherwise. And as much as I enjoy going mano a mano, there won't be any sparring. You are gonna withdraw your appeal.",
        "Elijah: Now, why would I do that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because it's in your client's best interests...unless you want me to reveal their secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Matthew's hearing is gonna start any minute now. Destiny told me that she was gonna go for moral support.",
        "Greg: Yeah. I know she wants more than friendship with that boy.",
        "Shaun: So?",
        "Greg: His parents are no joke.",
        "Shaun: In case you haven't noticed, neither is Destiny. You may be the surgeon, but if Matthew walks again, it's because of her.",
        "Greg: Yeah, I just don't think she did herself any favors by encouraging Matthew to sue the D.A. and the police commissioner.",
        "Shaun: I've been keeping an eye out. So far, they've been chill. At least they haven't gotten all up in her face about this.",
        "Greg: They've been too busy getting into mine. Bo went after me with both barrels last night.",
        "Shaun: Whoa! Hold up.",
        "Greg: No, no, it's okay. Rachel told me it wasn't about me. Apparently, the guy had something else on his mind.",
        "Shaun: Rachel? Rachel didn't tell me anything was up with Bo. And since when did you two get so buddy-buddy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You kissed Gigi?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. I didn't mean to. I mean, I wanted to for, like, a long time. But it was just--oh, it was just the worst possible timing.",
        "Rachel: What do you mean?",
        "Schuyler: Well, Gigi and Rex just got back together, you know? So they're, like, trying to make up for all that lost time.",
        "Rachel: So Gigi didn't react very well.",
        "Schuyler: I don't think she expected her friend to suddenly turn into the kissing bandit, no.",
        "Rachel: What did you say?",
        "Schuyler: I started with, \"I'm sorry. It was a stupid, spur-of-the-moment thing, and I'm not trying to break up you and Rex.\" But--",
        "Rachel: But?",
        "Schuyler: But I can't help thinking that things might be different between us if Rex wasn't in the picture.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You think I led Schuyler on?",
        "Rex: Well, what made him think he could kiss you?",
        "Gigi: Just because he was feeling a certain something doesn't mean I was, too.",
        "Rex: So how do you feel?",
        "Gigi: We're friends! He was really there for me when I needed him.",
        "Rex: Well, you don't need him now.",
        "Gigi: Oh, for Pete's sake, Rex! Schuyler's the reason we got back together.",
        "Rex: And I'm sure he hates that.",
        "Gigi: Okay, he just got his wires crossed for a split second.",
        "Rex: Yeah, with your lips!",
        "Gigi: Oh, my gosh! Okay, as soon as he did it, he told me how sorry he was. He admitted it was a mistake and that it would never happen again.",
        "Rex: Damn right it won't, because that jerk is not gonna get close enough to cross anything with you ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, man. Our life flashed before me last night, and I saw us turning into 2 old ladies sitting around talking to cats.",
        "Dorian: So you--you thought it'd be a better idea for us just to go to Viki and Nora's wedding, huh?",
        "Blair: Look, I wasn't in the best frame of mind, all right? I told you that. And you really don't remember anything? Ugh.",
        "Dorian: No. Wait, wait, wait. I have a vague, vague memory of--ahem--Charlie and Viki and Nora and Clint saying their solemn, solemn vows. But by the way, after you abandoned me in the church, darling, where'd you go?",
        "Blair: Well, I--I went on to the reception like an idiot. Got there just in time to catch Nora's wed--wedding bouquet, and T\u00e9a was catching Viki's, and-- and there was Todd standing there right between the two of us.",
        "Dorian: So what's the biggie? You know, so you caught the bouquet, right? That just means you're the one who's gonna be getting married next. Doesn't mean you're going to be marrying Todd. And, of course, you don't want anything to do with Todd anymore, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So I can assume that Blair's condition had something to do with you bringing T\u00e9a to the wedding, hmm?",
        "Charlie: Look, I can just read the paper here if it'll make you feel any better.",
        "Todd: No, that's all right. I guess you're family now. You don't have a problem signing a confidentiality agreement, though, do you?",
        "Viki: Why did you bring T\u00e9a? Was it just to hurt Blair?",
        "Todd: No, no. I'm sure that's what you think, but it was a date. It was a real date. Picked her up. I--I got her a corsage, a big old corsage. I was a perfect gentleman.",
        "Viki: Hmm.",
        "Todd: I got her a private concert.",
        "Charlie: He's starting to make me look bad.",
        "Viki: Oh, sweetheart, not a chance.",
        "Todd: Well, T\u00e9a was impressed, man. Swept her off her feet. Just blew her away.",
        "Viki: Did you?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Yeah. Did I mention the private concert?",
        "Viki: You did.",
        "Charlie: Todd, you know, it takes a lot more to win over a woman than just one great date.",
        "Viki: Especially T\u00e9a, who has been down this road with you before. Remember?",
        "Todd: Hey, man, I'm not some one-trick pony. There's more where that came from.",
        "Viki: Really? What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Ms. Delgado?",
        "T\u00e9a: Hmm?",
        "Elijah: What is this secret information you know about my clients?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, if I told you, then it wouldn't be a secret, now, would it?",
        "Elijah: And you said we wouldn't be sparring. So you expect me to withdraw my appeal simply because you say so?",
        "T\u00e9a: Just let your clients know that I'm aware of a certain event that they wouldn't want entered into the public record. Especially now that Nora has married Bo's brother. I am confident that they will more clearly see their son's point of view.",
        "Elijah: Wow. You know, usually reputations are full of hot air, but you're living up to everything I've heard.",
        "T\u00e9a: Happy to oblige.",
        "Elijah: But I'm not withdrawing my action. In fact, I'd advise you to back out of this right now: Drop your case.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh-oh-oh. Why would I do that?",
        "Elijah: Because I might just have some secret information, too--about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What are you saying? That I can't see Schuyler anymore?",
        "Rex: No. I just figured that you wouldn't want to hang around a guy who thinks he can come on to you whenever he feels like it.",
        "Gigi: Oh, he didn't come on to me. I told you, Rex, it was a mistake!",
        "Rex: Come on, Morasco, he's been all over you for weeks. He wants you. Even Stacy said--",
        "Gigi: Stacy! You're listening to Stacy?!",
        "Rex: No, I didn't. But I'm not blind. Every time I turn around, this guy is here along with you. You think that's a coincidence?",
        "Gigi: He's my friend.",
        "Rex: A guy who's trying to break us up is not your friend.",
        "Gigi: He is not trying to break us up!",
        "Rex: And he's doing a pretty good job of it. You have to see that having him around is bad for us. Now, promise me that you won't have anything more to do with him.",
        "Gigi: Or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: If Gigi were free, you would probably have a shot with her. But she's not.",
        "Schuyler: I know. I know. She loves Rex. He's, you know, her kid's dad. And the last thing I want to do is break up a family. I just--",
        "Rachel: Can't help how you feel about her.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna have to--I'm gonna have to try. After I apologized for, like, the zillionth time, she said we could be friends.",
        "Rachel: Well, that's good. Isn't it?",
        "Schuyler: I--I want to be able to be just friends with her, Rachel. I really do. I just don't know if I can stand it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Look, Rachel wandered into the Palace bar just as the commissioner was accusing me of forcing the surgery on Matthew.",
        "Shaun: But she told you that really wasn't his problem?",
        "Greg: I don't know what was. Aren't people supposed to be happy at weddings?",
        "Shaun: That's why you were with her when I came in.",
        "Greg: Uh-huh--bringing her dessert.",
        "Shaun: What's so weird about that?",
        "Greg: Nothing. Like I said, it was nice. Now, from what I hear, nothing gets a woman in the mood like bringing wedding cake.",
        "Shaun: Why do you got to be such a dog? Rachel and I are still getting to know each other.",
        "Greg: What, by passing notes? \"Do you still like me? Yes, no, maybe so.\"",
        "Shaun: Please. Just because that worked for you in the fourth grade.",
        "Greg: Oh, well, what works for you, huh? What have you gotten to know, so far?",
        "Shaun: That Rachel's smart, funny, sexy as hell, and I like her a lot.",
        "Greg: Maybe too much.",
        "Shaun: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I really care about her, honestly, and I want to make it work with her.",
        "Viki: In that case, Todd, you're gonna have to do a lot more than flowers and chocolates.",
        "Todd: Like what?",
        "Charlie: Look, Todd, I made some mistakes that tore Viki and me apart for a while.",
        "Todd: Yes, I know. Like lying about your identity, which helped get Jessica's husband killed? He brought it up.",
        "Charlie: Hey, no, it's all right. I mean, uh, what I did was unforgivable, no matter what my justifications were. But what I'm trying to say is that I had to work overtime to prove that I had changed, that I wasn't just doing this all as a show for Viki. That I had really actually become a new man, the man that I wanted to be, the man worthy of her. And then I just had to wait and see if she'd feel the same way about me.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, I think T\u00e9a and I are beyond that already. Yeah, I kind of screwed up having sex with Blair the other day, but...",
        "Viki: Oh, my God.",
        "Todd: That's not gonna happen again. I think T\u00e9a's over it.",
        "Viki: Is Blair?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I don't want Todd, okay? But I didn't appreciate being humiliated by him last night.",
        "Dorian: Right. Humiliated. I'm gonna need lots more strong coffee for this story. Go on.",
        "Blair: Ohh. He said right in front of T\u00e9a that he didn't want me, that he wanted her. In fact, his exact words, \"I'm with T\u00e9a.\" Then they went off to some surprise, I guess, that he had planned for them. I don't know.",
        "Dorian: Is that everything?",
        "Blair: No. He planted a very nasty, wet kiss right on her just to make his point.",
        "Dorian: What's your point?",
        "Blair: I don't have a point because I don't want him.",
        "Dorian: Then why are you so upset?",
        "Blair: Because I don't want T\u00e9a Delgado to have him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: What secret do you think you know about me?",
        "Elijah: Come on. Everybody has secrets. Don't you? Or are you saying your past is squeaky clean? Nothing to hide?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. So you're just playing the odds?",
        "Elijah: You said you had a trump card. So do I. If you play yours, I'll be forced to play mine.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're bluffing. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me.",
        "Elijah: You may be right. But are you willing to take that chance?",
        "Bailiff: This court is now in session, the Honorable Judge Avery Henson presiding.",
        "Judge: Good afternoon, everyone. This hearing is to assess the merits of a suit brought by the minor, Matthew Buchanan, to compel his parents to authorize spinal surgery. I'll hear presentations from both attorneys, and then I'll decide whether or not this case will proceed. Shall we begin?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Or what? Is that an ultimatum? That if I don't stop hanging out with Schuyler, you'll what, leave?",
        "Rex: Of course not. I love you, Gigi. I'm not leaving. Not ever again. But haven't we been through enough? How many more people are we gonna let try to break us up?",
        "Gigi: So I have to ditch a friend like Schuyler who made one little mistake that he's sorry for, while you're stuck to my crazy sister like glue? Stacy has done everything she can to get her hooks into you. And if you think she's through, you've got another thing coming.",
        "Rex: It doesn't matter what Stacy does. I don't want Stacy.",
        "Gigi: And I don't want Schuyler. But the difference is Schuyler respects what I want. Stacy is psycho into you. And you're gonna be with her 24/7, doing whatever she needs.",
        "Rex: 24/7 no. I have to a little. She--she's pregnant.",
        "Gigi: I know. But if I have to tolerate Stacy being in your life, you better find a way to accept Schuyler in mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I guess I'm just gonna have to dust off everything I learned in recovery about giving into temptation.",
        "Rachel: There is a big difference between substance and people, okay? I can sit at a bar and handle having a drink in front of me, but I play it safe with men. Well, at least, that's what that arrogant, full-of-himself jackass--",
        "Schuyler: Whoa. Whoa. Who are we talking about here?",
        "Rachel: Oh, Shaun's brother Greg.",
        "Schuyler: That's the guy that saved Brendan's life, right?",
        "Rachel: Yeah. I ran into him at my mother's wedding last night.",
        "Schuyler: Oh. Fun. Did he try to crack open anybody's skull with a drill?",
        "Rachel: No. But he thought he could get into mine without one. You know what? I don't care how many lives he saves. I don't need an armchair psychiatrist, no matter how fine he is.",
        "Schuyler: I thought--I thought Shaun was your date.",
        "Rachel: He was.",
        "Schuyler: Uh-huh. So where was he when you were talking to his \"fine\" brother?",
        "Rachel: In another room, thank you very much. I saw Greg at the bar, and he had the nerve to say that the only reason I was dating his brother was because he was a nice guy, a safe choice, not what I really wanted deep down inside.",
        "Schuyler: Is he right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Look, I get why you dig Rachel. She's a beautiful woman. But are you sure you guys are in the same place?",
        "Shaun: You're asking if she's as into me as I'm into her? Why? You don't think a woman like Rachel can be into a bodyguard? She needs a superhero surgeon like you?",
        "Greg: Wait, chill. This has nothing to do with me. I'm looking out for you. We're family. We should have each other's backs, right?",
        "Shaun: If you got something to say, come with it.",
        "Greg: Shaun, you're a good man. I know you take relationships seriously. But I don't want to see you get hurt by some woman if y'all are not in the same place.",
        "Shaun: Don't worry. Yours truly cannot be fooled again.",
        "Greg: Meaning?",
        "Shaun: Meaning there was a girl named Talia. She went around telling everybody that I was her boyfriend. In reality, she was into some other papi chulo. I learned my lesson right there and then.",
        "Greg: See, that's the thing about women. Sometimes they'll say one thing and mean something completely different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't ask me to interpret what's going on in Blair's mind. I'm still trying to figure out what's going on in my own.",
        "Viki: Tell me about it.",
        "Todd: All right. Well, first, having sex with Blair really gave me some perspective. I just don't want her. I really don't want her anymore. I want T\u00e9a, and I want to make her happy. I want to do it right.",
        "Viki: You know something? You're getting very good at this \"sincere.\"",
        "Todd: I'm being sincere. Don't make fun of me.",
        "Viki: Okay. In that case, be careful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Let's begin with counsel representing the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Buchanan.",
        "Nora: Oh, Your Honor, we're not Mr. and Mrs. Buchanan. Well, I mean, I--I am Mrs. Buchanan, and--and he's Mr. Buchanan, but we're not--well, I'm Matthew's mother, and he's Matthew's--but we're not--Bo?",
        "Bo: She's married to my brother Clint Buchanan.",
        "Judge: I get the picture. Mr. Clark?",
        "Elijah: Your Honor, the law is very clear. The authority to consent to or refuse medical treatment for a minor lies with the parents or legal guardian, and it is presumed they will act in the best interest of the child. But by challenging that authority of the parents in question--2 upstanding citizens and, might I add, professionals within the justice system-- Ms. Delgado is asking that we all disregard the law. She's asking that you legislate from behind the bench because she has no legal case. There are no secrets here. Everything's out in the open, plain for the world to see. Your Honor, the law is the law. Thus, I am requesting that this case be thrown out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Let T\u00e9a have Todd. That way, maybe we'll finally get him out of this house and--and out of our lives forever.",
        "Blair: Todd is not going anywhere, Dorian. He wants his kids, remember? And he's having such a good time flaunting that little relationship right under my nose.",
        "Dorian: The man is shameless.",
        "Blair: Well, T\u00e9a Delgado is worse. I just want to wipe that smug...smirk off of her face.",
        "Dorian: T\u00e9a is beneath you.",
        "Blair: Dorian, I know that. She just gets to me. I can't help it! I just can't believe that I actually had any sympathy for her or she had any sympathy for me even.",
        "Dorian: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That night in the frat house when the two of you thought you were dying.",
        "Blair: Oh, I cannot believe I actually said out loud in front of her that I had--that Todd was the love of my life. Now that bitch has something to hold over me.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but she confessed the same thing to you.",
        "Blair: Well, yeah, but it's--",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Blair: I might just have a way of showing little Miss Delgado what happens when she messes with a Cramer woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, I don't need a reminder of the statute regarding medical treatment for minors. In fact, I have a whole list of cases in which the law was challenged successfully. The minors in question all won the right to have control over their own bodies. They weren't simply dismissed because their parents said no. The cases examined the minor's competency to make decisions, as well as the particular medical facts. Now, Matthew Buchanan is a bright young man. He is an honor student and an athlete denied use of his legs by a tragic accident. He has a simple wish, to walk again, a wish that can be granted by an operation. Why his parents will not allow him to have that operation? Are they not listening to their son? Are they too distracted--uh, uh--",
        "Destiny: [Whispering] I thought she wasn't gonna say anything about that kiss.",
        "Judge: Ms. Delgado?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Um, I was about to say, are his parents too distracted by reading internet articles, by filling their heads with anecdotal evidence that they are failing to see the hard medical facts involved in this case? There is legal precedent to allow my client to make the decision whether or not to have surgery for himself. That is the right thing to do. That is the only thing to do.",
        "Judge: I'll be the one to decide that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course, Your Honor. Thank you very much. That is all I have to say at this time.",
        "Judge: This court will take a brief recess, and I'll return with my determination as to whether this case will proceed any further.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: And the two of you declared your undying love for Todd. I blame the gas.",
        "Blair: No. T\u00e9a told me something else. She told me she had this deep, dark secret that she never told a soul. And I guess that we were dying--that's why she wanted to tell me.",
        "Dorian: And what was it?",
        "Blair: I don't know. Passed out before she could tell me.",
        "Dorian: And you haven't brought it up since?",
        "Blair: I brought it up. I talked to her later about it in the hospital, but she denied even saying it. But I'm telling you right now, she said it.",
        "Dorian: A deep, dark secret. I wonder what it could be.",
        "Blair: I don't know. Maybe she's an alien. Maybe she's a man.",
        "[Blair giggles]",
        "Blair: I don't know, Dorian, but it's big. It's big, and she does not want it to come out.",
        "Dorian: And you'd like to do the honors.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: Is that because you think it'll get you Todd back?",

        "Viki: Todd, look, you've gone from \"a\" to \"z\" very quickly.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but why would I wait? I know what I want right now.",
        "Viki: Well, that's wonderful. But Charlie's right. It takes more than one wonderful date to make a relationship.",
        "Todd: Okay, Viki, what do I do?",
        "Charlie: Todd, all I can tell you is what worked for me. And it was I let Viki know exactly how I felt.",
        "Todd: Check.",
        "Charlie: And then I left her alone.",
        "Todd: But I don't understand. Why would I wait? I have the ability right now to wine her and dine her and buy her whatever she wants, make her see that last night wasn't a fluke.",
        "Viki: You don't get this, do you? If you want it to work this time, Todd, you're gonna have to do something that you're not very good at.",
        "Todd: Such as?",
        "Viki: You have to be patient. You have to slowly let T\u00e9a see that you have actually changed. You have to give her time.",
        "Todd: How much time?",

        "Shaun: Why are you so down on her? You don't even know her. Rachel is a great girl.",
        "Greg: You're right. She is-- at least from what I've seen, so far. I just want you to be happy, man.",
        "Shaun: I appreciate that. I'm sorry I keep coming on so strong about her. I was way off when I accused you of going after her.",
        "Greg: That's water under the bridge.",
        "Shaun: You know, it's been a while since we just straight-up hung out. Feels like I'm just starting to get to know you again.",
        "Greg: That's all me.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I am dating Shaun because I like him. End of story. Greg has no idea what he's talking about. He doesn't know me. He has no idea what I want. You know what? Why should I care what he thinks anyway?",
        "Schuyler: Because you do, Rachel. A lot, it sounds like.",
        "Rachel: I have no idea what's gonna happen with Shaun. We have a good time together. So he's a nice guy. So what?",
        "Schuyler: Oh! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Schuyler: \"Nice guy\"? You know that's like a kiss of death when a girl says that.",
        "Rachel: You think I only picked him because I knew nothing would happen?",
        "Schuyler: I would not presume to play armchair psychiatrist.",
        "Rachel: You know what? Maybe I should loosen up. Why not see what can happen with Shaun?",
        "Schuyler: Why not?",
        "Rachel: Why not?",
        "Schuyler: Why not? You know what? I think we should go to Rodi's and I think we should celebrate.",

        "Schuyler: Yeah. What up? You don't like their burgers?",
        "Rachel: Are you kidding me? I love them. But isn't that where Gigi works?",
        "Schuyler: Um, yeah. Trial by fire? I don't know. I guess I'm not gonna know if I can be just friends with Gigi unless I am around her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: The situation with Schuyler is completely different than the one with Stacy. I don't have a choice.",
        "Gigi: I know you want to do right by your child. But it still means that you're gonna be spending time with its mother.",
        "Rex: What does that mean?",
        "Gigi: I need someone to spend time with! I need a friend!",
        "Rex: I'm not your friend?",

        "Rex: Yeah. And you have--",
        "Gigi: Yeah. Marcie's gone, and Viki just got married, and they both have families of their own to focus on. I need someone to--",
        "Rex: Focus on you.",
        "Gigi: To talk to, bounce things off of, to vent my messed-up feelings to every once in a while, and that's all it is with Schuyler.",
        "Rex: Does he know that?",
        "Gigi: I think so. But even if he doesn't, if you trust me, then it shouldn't matter what he thinks or feels. Because I don't want him, Balsom. I want you. I love you, only you. I have to get to work. Are we good?",
        "Rex: We're good.",

        "Rachel: Wait! Uh-uh. What happened to trial by fire?",
        "Schuyler: Uh, yeah. I think I'd rather live in a monastery. You know what? Um, why don't you have a burger on me?",

        "Viki: No. Look, you have to--you have to pay attention to her. See what she wants. See how she's feeling, you know? But take it slowly.",
        "Charlie: If it's worth having, it's worth waiting for. You know, look where it got us.",
        "Todd: Right. I'm happy for you, sis.",

        "Elijah: Well, that judge must want to make a name for herself. I mean, we had grounds for dismissal.",
        "Bo: You gave it your best shot.",
        "Elijah: Well, I hope you're not worried? I still have plenty of tricks up my sleeve.",
        "Clint: It's T\u00e9a that I'm worried about. You can never tell what that woman is hiding.",

        "Elijah: Let gather my papers. I'll meet you outside.",
        "Clint: You are Matthew's mother and father, and you're damn good parents. And when all is said and done, that judge is gonna have to rule in your favor.",
