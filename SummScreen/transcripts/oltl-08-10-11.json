        "Viki laments to original Todd that the only person who knows the answer to the mystery of the two Todds is his mother, Irene Manning, who has been dead for 30 years. Original Todd thinks regular Todd altered the DNA results. He asks Viki if she believes he is her brother. She says yes, but she also believes that the other Todd believes he is her brother. He says she hasn't even offered him a hug yet. She says her brother doesn't like hugs. Tea wonders if Starr hit upon something when she suggested the two Todds could be twins. Todd accuses her of tampering with the DNA test. He says the other Todd is already taking over his life and the only person that doesn't doubt him is Jack. Irene Manning is angry that a DNA test is destroying her plan. Malcolm apologizes for losing the prisoner, but says the situation is still salvageable and no one will ever know who the real Todd Manning is. She says it's too bad he let Tomas Delgado go; he would have taken care of it. She tells him that she knows Viki will come looking for answers. Malcolm says Viki thinks Irene is dead. She presses a button under the desk and pulls a pistol from the drawer. She tells Malcolm he knows too much. Two security guards come in and take Malcolm away. Tomas asks Blair where they stand while she figures out which Todd is her children's father. She asks him to wait to have this conversation until after the new DNA test results come back. When she brings up Tomas's past, he asks her if it is about him or the man with the scar on his face. She tells him not to blame anyone else when he has continuously lied to her. He says the only truth he has withheld is that he is falling in love with her.",
        "David wants to know why Nate is not being charged with assaulting Matthew. Bo says it was an accident. David feels that Bo is keeping secrets from him because he isn't worthy to be a Buchanan. Bo assures him that he is a Buchanan and that he is just as important to him as Matthew is. Nora overhears Destiny telling Matthew that she has decided not to keep their baby. Destiny admits that she is pregnant. Nora wants her to have the baby because it is her grandchild. She tells Destiny that if she will have the baby, she and Bo will raise him. Destiny says she can't do to her child what her father did to her and that her appointment is tomorrow. She runs away. Nora tells Bo about the pregnancy. Starr tells James about the two Todds. She reveals that Baz kissed her. Starr and James make love."

        "Old Todd: Viki, you can't possibly believe that there's two of me.",
        "Viki: I don't know. I don't know. There's only one person qualified to answer that question, and that's the woman who gave birth to Todd.",
        "Old Todd: Irene?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Irene. She was my college roommate for 4 years and my very, very best friend. But unfortunately, she's been dead for--God, at least 30 years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: This is inexcusable. I did everything in my power to make sure the truth never came out. And now you're telling me that all my hard work is unraveling because of a DNA test?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "New Todd: I don't care what the test says! This other guy and me. You can't say that we're the same person, right? Oh, man. Leave it up to John McBain to screw up this badly.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, you saw the results.",
        "New Todd: I don't care! I don't care about the results. They're fake. They're a fake, like this other guy is a fake. I'm gonna get this other test back. I'm gonna look at it and you'll see. I'm Todd Manning. I'm Todd Manning. What's with you?",
        "T\u00e9a: I was just thinking about what Starr said. The possibility that you guys could be twins.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Hey, Pa!",
        "Bo: David. I didn't know you were visiting tonight.",
        "David: What, are you kidding? I'm the guy who got Matthew to talk the first time. I'm not going anywhere until that kid's his self again.",
        "Bo: I'm sure he appreciates it.",
        "David: Yeah, I hope he wakes up soon. I've got some major plans for our overdue brother bonding.",
        "Bo: Oh, no.",
        "David: I'm probably not gonna hire hookers this time. I hope you're cool with that.",
        "Bo: I'm cool with that.",
        "David: So is",
        "Bo: Nate's not in prison.",
        "David: What? Did that punk make bail?",
        "Bo: No. We're not charging him.",
        "David: Why the hell not? After what happened to my little brother, why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Anyway, I wanted to let you know what I've decided. I'm not gonna have our baby.",
        "Nora: Destiny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: Even if Irene Manning were alive, she probably still wouldn't know what's going on.",
        "Viki: You could be right. I just wish we could ask her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: This is my responsibility. The prisoner escaped under my watch and I failed to retrieve him from Llanview. I can't tell you how sorry I am, Ms. Manning.",
        "Irene: Malcolm...after all of these years, you really must call me Irene.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "New Todd: If I was a twin, don't you think I would know about it?",
        "T\u00e9a: You didn't know that Victor Lord was your biological father for half your life, ok? I am not saying I believe it, but there are still a lot of questions about your birth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: We could call a psychic.",
        "Viki: You can call a psychic.",
        "Old Todd: Hey. I don't need a psychic or anybody else to tell me that I'm your brother, but I wouldn't mind hearing from you that you believe what's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Mrs. B, I didn't know you were there. I was just...",
        "Nora: A baby. You were talking about a baby. You aren't gonna have Matthew's baby?",
        "Destiny: What? How could I have Matthew's baby?",
        "Nora: Destiny.",
        "Destiny: I was just talking-- I was hoping that one day we could start a family...",
        "Nora: Destiny, stop, please.",
        "Destiny: I'm sorry.",
        "Nora: Sweetie, honey, you've been trying to tell me something for weeks now. Is this it? Destiny, are you pregnant?",
        "Destiny: Yes. I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Hey.",
        "Blair: Hey, Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: May I come in?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, I thought we kind of agreed that you were gonna give us some space because of everything that was going on with the family.",
        "Starr: Mom. Jack and Sam are asleep. I'll give you guys some privacy.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, you don't have to. It's gonna--",
        "Starr: Actually, I was on my way to go see James anyway. You two have a lot to talk about.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Bye. She's right, you know.",
        "Blair: She always is.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: We have a lot to talk about. But if you want me to leave, I will.",
        "Blair: No. Come on in. Would be nice to talk to someone who's not looking for answers, because I certainly don't have any, and Starr and Dorian want to know how I feel about Todd.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm afraid I'm looking for an answer, too, Blair, but it's not about him.",
        "Blair: What about, then?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "New Todd: He forged the results.",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you finished?",
        "New Todd: No. Are you done siding against me?",
        "[Clattering]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not siding against you. I'm siding against your ridiculous conspiracy theories. Why don't we entertain Jack's theory that you were cloned? Yeah, that sounds very viable, don't you think? You were cloned. Sure. Why not?",
        "New Todd: So no one in this town has ever tampered with a DNA test?",
        "T\u00e9a: I--I know that that is a possibility, but there is no indication that that is what happened.",
        "New Todd: I don't care if he's a clone or he's a twin. He's an obsessive admirer. I don't care. It doesn't change the fact that he's trying to steal my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: You do believe I am who I say I am?",
        "Viki: In my heart, yeah, I do believe it. I can't say it until we get the results of the new test.",
        "Old Todd: You know, he tampered with the results of the first test. It's the only possible explanation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: Thank you, Irene. And as I told you before, I believe that the situation in Llanview is salvageable.",
        "Irene: You are an optimist.",
        "Baker: A realist. So the DNA results match up with both men. That doesn't tell us who they really are. No one in Llanview will know who the real Todd Manning truly is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I was so worried Blanca Morales would tell everyone that Matthew was Eddie Ford's killer. I didn't think it was true at first, but then Matthew told me it was.",
        "Nora: He told you what he did?",
        "Destiny: He was upset. He said you didn't want him to confess. And I just wanted to make him feel better. And then it-- just happened.",
        "Nora: And protection?",
        "Destiny: No. We weren't thinking about that.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. You're having Matthew's baby and he's lying in this bed. You're having his baby. Destiny... you're carrying my grandchild.",
        "Destiny: Mrs. B. I'm not having this baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Matthew and Nate, they had an argument. It turned physical.",
        "David: So Nate crushed his skull?",
        "Bo: No, he punched him. Matthew hit his head. It was an accident.",
        "David: Accident? My well-sculpted butt. It was assault, plain and simple. You saw what he did to him. I hate to see him like that.",
        "Bo: I do, too.",
        "David: So why aren't we arresting him, Pa? What is it? There's gotta be something else going on. Do we not have enough evidence against him?",
        "Bo: No.",
        "David: Pa, I am telling you, you should use me. Remember how well we worked together-- me with the gum, you with the wrapper? Put a wire on me, Pa. If there's one thing that I learned in \"Supermodel Crime Club,\" it's how to run a sting operation. I should probably wear a disguise. I'm good in disguises.",
        "Bo: No, David, there's not gonna be a sting. When I told you about all of this, I asked you to trust me.",
        "David: That's before you told me you let the kid go!",
        "Bo: But there's a good reason that I did. I can't tell you what it is.",

        "Starr: James! Ha ha ha!",
        "James: Oh, my God.",
        "Starr: [Indistinct]",
        "James: I was just listening to you.",
        "Starr: You were?",
        "James: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Oh.",
        "James: And I gotta admit, it's not bad.",
        "Starr: Not bad?",
        "James: It's good. It's really good. And you were great, of course. It almost softens the blow of us never seeing each other.",
        "Starr: I know. Between your job and my crazy life, there's always something. What?",
        "James: Nothing. I just-- I miss you.",
        "Starr: I miss you, too.",
        "James: Yeah?",
        "Starr: Mm-hmm.",
        "James: Come here. Let's catch up.",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "James: All right. Tell me about your life. What's going on?",
        "Starr: Well, there's my dad.",
        "James: Uh-oh. What did he do now?",
        "Starr: More like \"what did they do now.\" James... you're not going to believe this, but there are two Todd Mannings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey.",
        "[Clattering]",
        "T\u00e9a: No one's gonna take your life away from you.",
        "New Todd: He already started with Viki.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's not true, Todd.",
        "New Todd: Don't tell me it's not true. She's already made up her mind. She wants him as her brother. Not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Look, I understand your feelings about my-- the man who calls himself my brother, ok? But I swear to you, that's who he really thinks he is. Besides, if he were gonna alter your test, he would not have made you Todd Manning as well.",
        "Old Todd: He's got you fooled, sis. He's good. Maybe he's got Victor Lord's blood in him after all.",
        "Viki: If he does, then there's your answer. I just wish we could talk to Irene. Although she wouldn't give me a straight answer, would she? Do you know, she was my close, close friend for years, and I never once suspected she was having an affair with our father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: Maybe you're right. The DNA test won't give them any answers.",
        "Baker: If anything, it'll only raise more questions.",
        "Irene: Yes. But I know Victoria Lord. She was my best friend. And Viki is no fool. This little mistake of yours is going to point her right in my direction. If only you hadn't let our best man go. Tom\u00e1s Delgado would've done the job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Are you serious? I can't even think straight, much less try to figure out how I feel about you.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Come on.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Is it really that difficult? You said you weren't gonna pursue things with me while there were still questions about Todd. Well, now we have answers. Well, some kind of an answer. Saw the DNA test, right?",
        "Blair: Yeah, and they're both identical, and I'm not buying that any more than you are, so why don't we just wait till the new DNA tests come back in?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What if they say the same thing? You're still gonna have questions.",
        "Blair: Of course I am, because we're talking about the father of my children.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And while you're trying to figure out who that man is, where does that leave us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: So how are you doing? This has gotta be tearing you apart.",
        "Starr: That pretty much sums it up. I don't know who to believe.",
        "James: That's understandable.",
        "Starr: I thought so, too, and then Jack was giving me a rough time, saying that I was being disloyal to our dad. Next thing you know, I was at a jail cell questioning this man who looks exactly like my dad used to about every moment of our lives.",
        "James: How'd he do?",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "James: Just ok?",
        "Starr: He answered everything correct, but we got the test-- the DNA test results back. There's no way that there can be two Todds.",
        "James: There can't be. That's impossible.",
        "Starr: I know. Tell me about it. Are you sorry that you got involved with my family? I mean, we bring crazy to a whole other level.",
        "James: There's nothing I can't handle.",
        "Starr: Are you sure? Because I wouldn't blame you for wanting to steer clear of all of this.",
        "James: Is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I can't have a baby. I'm only 17 years old. I mean, and I'm all alone. Matthew--he's like this.",
        "Nora: Are you gonna have an abortion?",
        "Destiny: Yes. I am.",
        "Nora: No. I mean, you can't. You need your parents' permission.",
        "Destiny: Mrs. B, I have permission. This is the best choice for me, and my mom agrees.",
        "Nora: Please don't do this, Destiny. Please don't let this baby go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Fine. I get it. You don't trust me.",
        "Bo: No. That's not it.",
        "David: Why should you trust me, huh? Half my life, I've been a jerk. I've been a liar. Hell, I made Clint pay for half my liver.",
        "Bo: David--",
        "David: How did I come here in the first place? I came to this town pretending to be Viki's bastard brother just so I could get my hands on Victor Lord's fortune.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: When I found out about the affair... I was so--I felt so betrayed, not just by him but by her as well. We had shared everything. And unfortunately, as a result of finding out, every single memory I have of our time together is tainted. There's a photograph in here of us-- Irene and me at our homecoming dance--and I look at it and I think, \"oh, well, I'm sure she was going to meet father right after the dance.\" And I have to wonder about the boyfriend that she had the summer that I was away. You know, if she had been alive when I found out the truth... I would have given her a piece of my mind.",
        "Old Todd: I've seen you when the gloves come off. It's a good thing she's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Baker: Does it really make a difference if you're on Viki's radar? She thinks you're dead. Everyone in Llanview does.",
        "Irene: True. But what's that old saying? \"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.\"",
        "Baker: Twain. Mark Twain. But that quote's been mangled over the years.",
        "Irene: Why, Malcolm, you have always been full of surprises... Right up to the end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Let's not get into this now, ok? Let's just wait until the DNA tests come back, ok?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Blair, why does that test even matter? Why are you letting either Todd dictate your relationship with me? 8 years ago, before Todd showed up with a new face, you weren't even together, were you?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And the Todd we all know now is married to my sister. You're not too broken up about that, are you?",
        "Blair: Of course not.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I know he's the father of your children, and I don't take that lightly. But Blair...what does it matter who is and who isn't Todd Manning? You're over both of them, aren't you?",
        "Blair: Of course I am.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Good. Good. I just wanted to make sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: I don't understand. What was the betrayal? That it was your father or that it was your best friend?",
        "Viki: They were both equally awful.",
        "Old Todd: Ok, fine. But if you had to choose one, what would it be? Choose one. Come on. Just one. You're no fun at all.",
        "Viki: For heaven's sakes, she was young enough to be his daughter.",
        "Old Todd: Oh, and Victor, you know, he had such a strong sense of morality otherwise. The guy never met a line that he didn't cross. What? That hurts your feelings? There's something on my shirt?",
        "Viki: No. God, you're so much like the brother I used to know.",
        "Old Todd: I'm not like your brother. I am your-- Viki, I'm your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Viki is not siding with him over you. She offered him a place to stay. She'd do that with anyone.",
        "New Todd: Yeah, she likes to take in strays. But she's not making him stay in the carriage house. And I can tell you he's taking advantage of it. Viki doesn't even think I'm me anymore.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't know that that's true.",
        "New Todd: Yeah, I do. The only one who still believes in me is Jack. Everyone else thinks I'm an imposter. Starr. Have you seen the way she looks at me? Do you have any idea how that feels, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: This is hard on everyone.",
        "New Todd: Really?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "New Todd: You see Blair. She's started to act like I'm a stranger.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, she hasn't.",
        "New Todd: Let's focus in on you. Shall we? Tell me you're not thinking about him right now. Come on. Tell me. Tell me that you're not wondering if he's really the man you love. Can you look me in the eye? Tell me that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Now, look. You made your share of mistakes. You know what? So have all of us. But that was a long time ago, and I am proud of the way that you changed. You made Dorian my daughter-in- law, but nobody's perfect. But don't you ever think that I don't consider you a Buchanan. You're family. But this isn't about keeping it all in the family, this decision we've made to not go after Nate. That's private. That's between Nora and me, and we did it for Matthew. Ok?",
        "David: Ok.",
        "Bo: David... You are as much a son to me as Matthew is. All right? Don't--look at me. Don't ever think that you're not.",
        "David: Thanks, Pa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Don't you think I would keep this baby if I thought I could give it a good life?",
        "Nora: I know this is a lot to ask...",
        "Destiny: This wasn't an easy choice to make, and I'm sorry if you have anything against abortion.",
        "Nora: No, it has nothing to do with that. Destiny, this is about--this is about my son. This is about Matthew. Don't you see? Bo and I have been putting up a pretty good front. You know, we've been telling everyone he's gonna get better, but in truth, no one has made that promise to us. No one. We don't know if Matthew's ever gonna come back to us. We don't know if we're ever gonna get our Matthew back, but now you--your baby. His baby. This may be the only piece of him I have left.",
        "Destiny: Mrs. B, please don't ask me to do this. I can't be a mom. I'm too young to be a mom. I can't raise a baby.",
        "Nora: I can. I will. I can. Bo and I can raise the baby. We'll raise him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Did you really think that I wanted to break up with you? Come on.",
        "James: I don't know. Even when my dad was making our lives a living hell way back then, we were growing closer. Now it just feels like we're growing apart.",
        "Starr: Why would you say that?",
        "James: Because. I used to be the guy who was there for you, and now that's Baz. You work with him, he lives at your dad's house, now he's the one who's around all the time.",
        "Starr: Oh, please. I avoid Baz like the plague.",
        "James: Really? You do?",
        "Starr: Yes. Because he kissed me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I can't do this. I--",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Why not?",
        "Blair: I feel like it's going too fast.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Ah, Blair. You know, it wasn't that long ago we were trying to spend the night together.",
        "Blair: I know. I remember.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So what's stopping you? Hmm? I've told you everything you want to know about my life. What's it gonna take to make you trust me?",
        "Blair: Trust you? How could I trust a man whose job is to murder my ex- husband? Huh?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I told you I was lied to. I thought Todd was an enemy of the state. I thought you understood that.",
        "Blair: I did.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Really? Then why is it still coming up? Hmm? Maybe this has nothing to do with my past or what I did. Maybe it has everything to do with the guy with the scar on his face.",

        "Old Todd: It kills me that my own kids won't accept me. He has completely brainwashed Jack against me.",
        "Viki: He's the only father that Jack has ever known.",
        "Old Todd: ...Came and gave me a pop quiz. She tried to catch me, like I'd forget something, some important detail. I remembered everything.",
        "Viki: And did she believe you?",
        "Old Todd: Well, yeah, she chalked it up to me having read Todd's unauthorized biography. It's not just her. Blair. T\u00e9a...Said that I will never meet our daughter.",
        "Viki: It's a complicated situation for all of us.",
        "Old Todd: That's one way to put it.",
        "Viki: Well, how would you put it?",
        "Old Todd: Here's the thing. I fought really hard to get here, to come home. And I didn't think that everybody would welcome me with open arms, but I was counting on you. You haven't even offered me a hug.",
        "Viki: My brother doesn't like being hugged.",
        "Old Todd: Right. Ok, you caught me. I'm nothing but a great, big fake.",

        "Nora: Don't you see? This could work. This is--it'll be brilliant. Bo and I will raise him. We'll raise your baby.",
        "Destiny: I'm not gonna do that. Greg dumped me on my grandparents. I don't want that kind of life for my child.",
        "Nora: It won't be the same. It won't be the same, Destiny. There won't be any lies. The baby will always know that you're his mother. And you can be as much a part of his life as you want to be. Anything you want, you have it. Bo and I, we'll raise it, we'll pay for the education, we'll do everything. We'll love it very, very much, you know? And you--you can go to school and you can do everything in your life that you want to do.",
        "Destiny: With my baby stashed away with you? I couldn't do that. It just wouldn't feel right.",
        "Nora: And this does?",
        "Destiny: I've already made up my mind. I'm not having this baby. My appointment is tomorrow. This is just something I have to do.",

        "Bo: And you understand why we needed to let Nate go?",
        "David: Not really, but I'm cool.",
        "Bo: Ok. Cool is good enough.",
        "David: Hey, Pa, while I got you here, you want to see a screening of \"Vicker Man\"? Han Solo cannot hold a candle to you, but then again, who could?",
        "Bo: What, did you bring the movie?",
        "David: I've always got a copy on me. Wait till you see the entertainment system I got set up in Matthew's room.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Destiny, I realize I have no right to ask for this, so I'm begging. I'm begging you, please don't do this. Please. Please reconsider. Please. It's not too late. What if Matthew never comes back to me? What if--what if this baby is the only piece that I have left of him? Please, sweetie. Please, please, don't do this. Please. Please reconsider. Don't do this. Don't let this baby go, ok?",
        "David: Ok, who's ready to see this baby? Apparently, she read the reviews. Everybody stay put. Destiny, come back here.",
        "Bo: What's going on? Did something happen to Matthew?",
        "Nora: [Sniffles] No. No, Matthew's fine--well, in a way it's about Matthew.",

        "Starr: Yes.",
        "James: I knew something was going on.",

        "James: But you didn't tell me about it, Starr.",
        "Starr: I didn't tell you about it because it didn't mean anything and I didn't want to make a big deal out of something that just wasn't.",
        "James: You mean you didn't want me to make a big deal out of it.",
        "Starr: Yes. I didn't want you going after him after I'd already slapped the hell out of him.",
        "James: You did?",
        "Starr: Yes. I did. And he never saw it coming. James... I may not know which man is my father, but I know the man that I want to be with, and that is you. I love you.",
        "James: I love you, too, twinkle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Old Todd: You know what's gonna happen, right? The other DNA test is gonna prove that I am your brother, and then you're gonna want a hug, and I don't know if I'm gonna be in the mood.",
        "Viki: What if the results are the same? What do we do then?",
        "Old Todd: I can't think about that. I've got so many questions, and nobody has any answers.",

        "Irene: Irene.",
        "Baker: We've worked together for years, and I have been nothing but trustworthy and loyal.",
        "Irene: A dog is trustworthy and loyal. I needed you to be competent. You were sloppy instead.",
        "Baker: The prisoner got the better of all of us.",
        "Irene: For which you took full responsibility. I gave you an opportunity to make it up to me, but you failed. Besides, you know far too much about me...and him. Take care of him.",

        "Tom\u00e1s: So this has nothing to do with either of those two men?",
        "Blair: No! And even if one of them were lying to me, you're the biggest fraud of all. You're trying to pass yourself off as some kind of Bohemian artist.",

        "Tom\u00e1s: You don't have to say anything. I know I have a long way to go before you'll trust me. But I'm not giving up on you, Blair. You want to know things about your ex? I'll find them out. I will do whatever it takes to make you forgive me. And then I'll make you forget everything there is to know about both those guys calling themselves Todd Manning.",
