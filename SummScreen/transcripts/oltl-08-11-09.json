    "Recap": [
        "After Tea has convinced the judge to hear Matthew's case, Bo and Nora talk to their lawyer, Elijah Clark about how that could happen. He admits he doesn't have a clue but knows that Matthew shared a \"secret\" he had about them with Tea and they were going to use it against them. He, however, reveals that he has a \"secret\" on Tea. And Tea reveals she is worried. Blair right then remembers that Tea almost revealed a deep dark secret to her when they both thought they'd die in the basement of the frat house. And she goes to get Rex to find out what it is for her. When Matthew talks to Greg, at first Greg reveals that even if they win the case, he is \"not comfortable\" doing the surgery without his parents' consent. But as soon as he finds out that Matthew and Destiny know a secret about Bo and Nora, he seems to change his mind and tells Matthew he will testify in his behalf if subpoenaed. David Vickers appears out of nowhere and reveals to Dorian that he has an idea for a new reality television show about her home life. Yet, she tells him no way. Markko reveals to Langston that in order for him to afford what he needs he has to work overtime which means he has no time for her. But when she sees that David is back in town, she reveals that she has \"an idea\"."

        "Dorian: Ooh. David.",
        "David: You miss me?",
        "Dorian: Huh. I thought that, um, you were in California.",
        "David: I thought I would be, too, but I've come to learn that some things aren't meant to be...and some things are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Yeah. So it starts at 7 p.m.",
        "Shaun: There's a new trio at Capricorn tonight. There's a full bill at Ultraviolet. I don't think Greg's ever been there before.",
        "Rachel: You're very excited.",
        "Shaun: Greg and I never double-dated before. This is new ground.",
        "Rachel: Well, don't get your hopes up. I mean, Greg might not find a date.",
        "Shaun: Ha ha ha! You think.",
        "Rachel: It's short notice. Dr. Wright might be busy.",
        "Greg: We're set. Vivian's in for tonight.",
        "Destiny: Hey, guys.",
        "Shaun: All right. Hey.",
        "Rachel: Hey, kids.",
        "Shaun: Des, Matt.",
        "Greg: Yeah. What's up?",
        "Destiny: We won.",
        "Rachel: The whole case?",
        "Matthew: Not yet.",
        "Greg: But there'll be a trial?",
        "Matthew: I get to make my case. And once the judge hears my side of the story, my parents will lose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Elijah, what do you think happened here today?",
        "Elijah: Truth? I don't know. Matthew has no case.",
        "Bo: Then why are we going to trial?",
        "Elijah: Couldn't tell you. Anyway, we will win, based on the law, facts, and precedent. Don't you agree?",
        "Nora: Well, I certainly think so.",
        "Elijah: Most likely, this judge was just being overly cautious. She probably wants to hear the whole case before she makes her ruling.",
        "Bo: Yeah, or she's just being a jerk. What? What, that doesn't happen? Ask Blair Cramer.",
        "Elijah: Listen. The good news is we don't have the burden of proof, so...",
        "Bo: Okay. Good. What does that mean here?",
        "Elijah: Well, they have to prove that the two of you are unfit to make decisions regarding Matthew's surgery, and I just don't see that happening.",
        "Nora: Yeah, well, don't--don't write him off just yet. T\u00e9a Delgado will do anything to win. She fights dirty.",
        "Elijah: Well, I wouldn't worry about Ms. Delgado. She's under control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: 3 for 3 against Nora Buchanan--that's got to feel good. How do you want to celebrate?",
        "T\u00e9a: Celebrate what?",
        "Todd: Wiping the floor with that other lawyer.",
        "T\u00e9a: What secret do you think you know about me?",
        "Elijah: Everybody has secrets. Don't you? Or are you saying your past is squeaky clean, nothing to hide?",
        "Todd: Bo and Nora are probably asking for their retainer back by now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why?",
        "Todd: Because their fancy mouthpiece got absolutely outlawyered by you today. They're gonna lose now.",
        "T\u00e9a: That loser's better than he looks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a Delgado has a secret, and you're gonna find out what it is.",
        "Rex: I am?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. You're still a P.I., aren't you?",
        "Rex: Yes.",
        "Blair: Okay. You investigate people, take cases, cash checks?",
        "Rex: Sure.",
        "Blair: Well, then you're hired.",
        "Rex: Hold on. What do you want me to find out about T\u00e9a Delgado?",
        "Blair: She's got a big secret, and I need to know what it is, yesterday.",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a almost told me herself. That's how I know that there's a secret.",
        "Rex: Well, maybe she was yanking your chain.",
        "Blair: No. It was like a near-death thing when we were locked down in the basement of the K.A.D. house. All that gas coming in, and she was this close to telling me, and then we both passed out, I guess.",
        "Rex: Yeah, tough break on that.",
        "Blair: Uh-huh.",
        "Rex: Uh, did you ask her later?",
        "Blair: Of course! I've brought it up a million times, and she just kind of looks at me like I don't know what I'm talking about, you know?",
        "Rex: Well, maybe that's the truth. You guys were breathing in all that gas. Maybe T\u00e9a wasn't in her right mind.",
        "Blair: She doesn't have a right mind, but she does have a secret, and it's got to be big.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You can go now.",
        "Todd: Are you sure? I mean, I don't know if I should, with the extent of your injuries.",
        "T\u00e9a: I have officially been given a clean bill of health. I am fully recovered from the explosion.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh. Did a doctor say that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. All my doctors said that, yeah.",
        "Todd: See, I think--I think that the only way we'll know for sure that you're recovered is if we give you a little road test.",
        "T\u00e9a: What exactly do you mean by that?",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "T\u00e9a: You have got to be kidding me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay. I've got the list of experts willing to testify to the risks of the operation, and you have all the statistics, correct?",
        "Elijah: And all the exhibits ready to go.",
        "Bo: Okay. Listen. Um, we want to win.",
        "Elijah: Uh-huh.",
        "Bo: But when it comes to dealing with Matthew directly, go easy on him, okay? We don't want him in shreds at the end of this.",
        "Elijah: It's just too bad your son doesn't feel the same way about not hurting you.",
        "Nora: Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Elijah, what is that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: What's wrong with you guys? Didn't you hear?",
        "Matthew: Ah, we get a trial. This is good news.",
        "Greg: You're right, Matthew. Now you'll get your shot. Congratulations.",
        "Matthew: Thanks. I mean, it's still a fight, but we have a good chance. I'll probably need you to testify.",
        "Greg: That may not be the best plan.",
        "Matthew: What do you mean? You're the doctor. You're the reason why I'll make it through the surgery. You have to testify.",
        "Greg: Look. Matthew, if asked, I'll have to say honestly that I'm not comfortable doing the surgery without your parents' consent.",
        "Matthew: You're telling me this now?",
        "Greg: Well, I hoped that they would agree without a judge.",
        "Destiny: But you'd still do the surgery, wouldn't you?",
        "Matthew: What if Rachel says I should get the surgery?",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Matthew: I need you to stand up for me, Rachel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hey. What's up?",
        "Markko: Table 4. Busy. Mrs. Vega called an extra shift, and it's overtime, and I need the extra cash.",
        "Langston: Well, what about our date? Are you bailing?",
        "Markko: Come on, don't say that like I want to.",
        "Langston: No. It's--it's fine.",
        "Markko: This is the way it is.",
        "Langston: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Markko: I wish I could hang out with you all day all summer, but I'm working two jobs, and I still can't afford to pay for even a crap apartment.",
        "Langston: Okay, but isn't living at Viki's okay?",
        "Markko: They're great, and they're also total strangers who took in a charity case. I can't stay there. I can't go home.",
        "Langston: Yeah, because your parents hate me. No, it's all my fault.",
        "Markko: Look. I didn't say that. But this is reality now, and if you can't hack it, then just dump me and find another guy who's more fun. Damn it! I'm sorry.",
        "Langston: Looks like neither one of us is much fun right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Why are you here?",
        "David: Isn't it obvious? I've missed you.",
        "Dorian: Your agent cut you loose.",
        "David: Heh heh! Bev? Oh, no. She's heartbroken I'm not out there.",
        "Dorian: The hemorrhoid commercial money ran out.",
        "David: What, are you kidding? Hemorrhoids and a bad economy go hand in hand, or cheek to cheek. People are sitting around on their duffs more than ever. The royalties are pouring in. You look more beautiful than ever.",
        "Dorian: I know you're a liar, but you're the best thing that's happened all day.",
        "David: Tell me more about it. Tell me every sordid detail. David Vickers is listening.",
        "Dorian: Another time.",
        "David: No, now. Now's a good time. Tell me all about it now.",
        "Dorian: Oh, you don't really want to hear all about me.",
        "David: I should never have let that Rico suave seduce you away from me. I'm here to win you back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You want me to testify for you?",
        "Matthew: Look. There's no other adult who knows me like you do.",
        "Rachel: What do you expect me to say?",
        "Matthew: That Mom and Dad keep saying I'm not thinking clearly and that I don't know what I'm talking about. You know that. You get it.",
        "Rachel: What do you think I get?",
        "Matthew: That I can't spend the rest of my life in this chair. Look. You know how hard it is every day to get out of bed. And I'm still young. It'll only get harder the older I get.",
        "Rachel: You don't know that.",
        "Matthew: I hate being in this chair, Rachel, and you know that. You know it's not just a mood or a phase I'm going through. You can tell the judge that that's why I'm unhappy and the only way to make me better is with this surgery.",
        "Rachel: Matthew, what if I don't want to testify? Are you gonna blackmail me like you did Mom and Bo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Why do you think that Matthew's not worried about hurting us?",
        "Elijah: Before the hearing, T\u00e9a Delgado said--suggested, even--that we should withdraw our appeal. If we didn't, she had some damning information about the two of you that she'd gleaned from Matthew.",
        "Nora: I think I'm gonna be sick.",
        "Elijah: And she was willing to use it in open court.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "Nora: I'm definitely gonna be sick.",
        "Bo: Well, thanks for the warning, Elijah.",
        "Elijah: So, then, it's true, hmm? Matthew has some serious dirt on the two of you?",
        "Nora: We didn't say that.",
        "Elijah: Come on, now. It must be pretty damning if Matthew thinks he can control you with this information.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Uncle. Uncle!",
        "T\u00e9a: Say it.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a's the champ.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of all time.",
        "Todd: Today.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of all time!",
        "Todd: Ow! T\u00e9a's the champ of all time. T\u00e9a's the champ of all time! God! Ow.",
        "T\u00e9a: You had your fingers crossed, didn't you?",
        "Todd: Yes. Well, I'd say you're officially recovered.",
        "T\u00e9a: And here I thought you were gonna put the moves on me.",
        "Todd: What? A gentleman like moi?",
        "T\u00e9a: The thought never crossed your mind?",
        "Todd: No. I--I engage in only wholesome activities.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "Todd: I probably wouldn't turn you down, though.",
        "T\u00e9a: Probably?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I might not. Or I might. I might, seriously, because I like where this is going.",
        "T\u00e9a: You do?",
        "Todd: Yeah, definitely.",
        "T\u00e9a: Me, too.",
        "Todd: You're not waiting for me to screw up, are you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not every minute.",
        "Todd: That's nice to hear. You know, I've been listening to my sister now, probably for the first time ever.",
        "T\u00e9a: You talked to Viki about us again?",
        "Todd: Yup. She told me not to push, and maybe things will work out for me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Smart lady.",
        "Todd: Are you feeling the same way? All right. I like our chances.",
        "T\u00e9a: If it were just us. But there's always Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay. So you want me to dig up a secret that T\u00e9a has guarded with her life?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: Doesn't that bother you?",
        "Blair: Why would I care?",
        "Rex: Well, that's what I want to know. Why do you have it in for T\u00e9a?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So you're moving back to Llanview?",
        "David: For 13 weeks. Longer if you'll have me.",
        "Dorian: You'd give up your acting for me?",
        "David: Is that so hard to believe?",
        "Dorian: But you were following your bliss.",
        "David: My bliss led me back to La Boulaie.",
        "Dorian: You would give up fame and fortune for me?",
        "David: I want the complex yet fulfilling life that you and I were building with each other, with your accessible family and those quirky, 3-dimensional friends we had.",
        "Dorian: What friends?",
        "David: Oh, like Moe and Noelle. You know, I have really missed Moe's no- nonsense attitude. And right about now, I could use a dose of Noelle's homespun wisdom.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I, uh--I fired them after a graduation party debacle.",
        "David: Speak up. Is it a lurid story?",
        "Dorian: Oh! And it ends with Markko's family disowning him because they found out that he was having sex with Langston, and me being thrown in the pool.",
        "David: Wow! I have missed out on so much. You're gonna have to recreate every detail for me.",
        "Dorian: No. No, I'm afraid it was painful enough the first time.",
        "David: What about, uh, your Latin lover Ray Montez? Was he defending your honor in all this?",
        "Dorian: No, he was taking care of his disturbed daughter.",
        "David: He has a disturbed daughter?",
        "Dorian: She took L.S.D. at the senior prom. She poked holes in condoms. She killed her mother. Not in that order.",
        "David: My goodness. That's horrible. Are they here?",
        "Dorian: No. Ray took her out of state to an institution where she could get treatment.",
        "David: What about Addie? She's here, isn't she?",
        "Dorian: Yes. Yes. She just got back from the Amazon.",
        "David: And Langston, that sassy orphan who's so lucky you took her in?",
        "Dorian: Well, sometimes she feels lucky. Other days, not so much.",
        "David: And the ever-promiscuous Blair--she still raising hell around here?",
        "Dorian: Blair is not promiscuous.",
        "David: Eh...",
        "Dorian: But...she sure can raise hell when she feels like it.",
        "David: What about her brood? I sure like that Starr. How is my would-be favorite mother?",
        "Dorian: She's not would-be. No, Starr's baby was found alive and well and is living with us.",
        "David: Starr's baby...",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "David: Is here?",
        "Dorian: It's a long story.",
        "David: My goodness. I've missed out on all the good stuff. But surely there's lots of conflict, lots of complications, what with the baby and all.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no, the baby's easy. No problem.",
        "David: No trouble from anyone?",
        "Dorian: Todd is a pain. I just wish I could brick up that entire wing he's in.",
        "David: Wait a second. Todd Manning, Blair's ex-husband, who tried to sell his own son, is living here?",
        "Dorian: By court order. Yes, some family court judge, who I can assure you will not get re-elected--he ordered that they live under the same roof, that they be civil to one another, or they'd both lose the children.",
        "David: That's it. That's why I'm here: To protect you from that nut job. I'm going to make sure he doesn't harm anyone in your family.",
        "Dorian: You really mean that.",
        "David: I would do anything to protect you, Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Do you really want to break up?",
        "Markko: No. No. Do you?",
        "Langston: I think about it. I mean, your life would be so much easier.",
        "Markko: Don't.",
        "Langston: No. You could move back home. You wouldn't be broke and worried about money.",
        "Markko: I'd still be broke. Look. Don't make decisions because of me, okay? I don't want to lose you.",
        "Langston: I don't want to get lost.",
        "Markko: It's just a bad day.",
        "Langston: Well, what happened?",
        "Markko: I got the syllabus for my film class, and it's 300 bucks' worth of books, which is, what, 70 hours of extra work that I have to squeeze in before this semester starts. I feel like I'm drowning.",
        "Langston: So let me help.",
        "Markko: Like how?",
        "Langston: Like let me loan you some money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mmm. Ahem. David, why are you doing this?",
        "David: You say the word, I will move in today.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I don't know, David. I really don't. Do you...",
        "David: What?",
        "Dorian: What is that?",
        "David: Oh, that? What that?",
        "Dorian: That.",
        "David: It's a phone.",
        "Dorian: It looks like a microphone.",
        "David: No, it's just a phone.",
        "Dorian: Looks a lot like a microphone! Hello! [Screeching] You! What do you...yeah! Hello! Come out, come out...",
        "David: I come here...",
        "Dorian: Wherever you are!",
        "David: And give you my heart, and you react like this?",
        "Dorian: Here it goes!",
        "David: Don't be ridiculous, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Take that! Take that. Take--ha ha ha!",
        "David: Don't mind the people in the bushes.",
        "Dorian: Whoa! More, more, more! All right. Who are you people? Huh? Fine! Security!",
        "David: Wait a second.",
        "Dorian: Security!",
        "David: You have security? That's fantastic. Get them on camera.",
        "Dorian: Who are they?",
        "David: This is my production crew. Now smile into the camera, Dorian. You're on television.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What my son believes is so awful has no bearing on this case.",
        "Elijah: Want to let me be the judge of that?",
        "Bo: Do you expect us to tell you something?",
        "Elijah: I am your lawyer. You know it goes no further than me.",
        "Nora: Well, it's personal.",
        "Elijah: And tomorrow, it will be entered into the court record, okay? Unless Ms. Delgado is bluffing.",
        "Nora: No, she doesn't bluff. As a matter of fact, she'd enter it into the court record just to be spiteful.",
        "Bo: Unless it hurt her case. So let's let it go for now.",
        "Elijah: All right. Well, since I have no further explanation, I'll just assume the two of you are having an affair, and we'll just deal with it.",
        "Bo: No, no. That is not true. Just keep that in mind.",
        "Elijah: All right. Well, if it is, you keep in mind that Ms. Delgado will use it as an example of bad judgment. Not only can she say it, she can most likely get it entered into evidence, so...one last time, anything you want to tell me?",
        "Nora: There's nothing impairing our judgment, Elijah.",
        "Elijah: Good. You've trusted me with your son's life. What's bigger than that?",
        "Nora: Well, if it comes up again, let us know?",
        "Bo: No, it won't. It won't. Matthew doesn't want to hurt us. If he intended to use this information, we would have heard about it today.",
        "Elijah: We almost did. T\u00e9a Delgado didn't back down because Matthew told her to. I stopped her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Well?",
        "Matthew: Look. We already talked about this.",

        "Rachel: You want a medal?",
        "Matthew: Look. Mom cheated on Uncle Clint.",
        "Rachel: That is none of your business. What if somebody blackmailed you?",
        "Matthew: With what?",
        "Rachel: I don't know. Maybe that reading material you have under your bed?",
        "Matthew: How do you know about that?",
        "Rachel: You just told me.",
        "Matthew: Look. That's got nothing to do with this. Mom and Dad, I mean, that could have clouded their judgment, and that's relevant to my case.",
        "Rachel: Where did you get that line from?",
        "Matthew: My lawyer.",
        "Rachel: You told T\u00e9a Delgado?",
        "Matthew: Yes. She's my lawyer. They have to know everything.",
        "Rachel: Who else have you told?",
        "Matthew: Nobody, and I won't. Neither will T\u00e9a.",
        "Rachel: Oh!",
        "Matthew: Look. I made her promise not to use it.",
        "Rachel: Well, Matthew, even if T\u00e9a said that, she will find a way to use it against Mom.",

        "T\u00e9a: Don't. Don't make promises you can't keep.",
        "Todd: Listen. I--I certainly can't tell you what's going on inside her head, and I don't know what she's gonna try next, but I can tell you that I won't let her get to me. All right. What do you want me to do?",
        "T\u00e9a: Nothing.",

        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "Todd: Give me a test.",
        "T\u00e9a: That is your test. Do nothing. She flirts with you, she sheds her bikini, you walk away. She picks a fight with you, you walk away.",
        "Todd: No problem. For how long?",
        "T\u00e9a: Forever.",
        "Todd: That's a long time to go without a fight. Come on, give me a little room.",
        "T\u00e9a: Until I can look at you and not think about seeing you and her in the cabana.",
        "Todd: That's not gonna take forever, is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: It was a pretty nasty image.",
        "Todd: Blair is out of my system, completely.",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe, but you're not out of hers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I have my reasons for disliking T\u00e9a Delgado. They're my reasons.",
        "Rex: You don't think I need to know?",
        "Blair: No, I don't. You just dig up the information, and then I will take care of the rest.",
        "Rex: Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.",
        "Blair: What is your problem?",
        "Rex: Well, you're looking for a way to ruin T\u00e9a Delgado's life.",
        "Blair: And?",
        "Rex: Well, I can't be a part of that if there's not a good reason.",
        "Blair: Well, she's seeing Todd, okay?",
        "Rex: So?",
        "Blair: So that means she's gonna be around my kids, and I need to protect my kids!",
        "Rex: You're not worried about your kids. You're trying to break up Todd and T\u00e9a. You want Todd for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What if I move out of Dorian's?",
        "T\u00e9a: You'd lose your kids.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but what if I got the court ruling overturned? Which I should have a shot at, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: It was a pretty strange decision. The right judge might reverse it, given the right argument.",
        "Todd: It's a good thing I have a great lawyer.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you can't use me on this one.",
        "Todd: All right. I'll get another lawyer. Hey, why don't I use the one that almost kept up with you today? What's his name? Elijah Clarke?",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Yeah, you said he's better than I think he is, and he specializes in family law, right? So--",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, but--",
        "Todd: All right. Give me his number.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. You stay away from him.",

        "Nora: What do you got on her?",
        "Elijah: Want to trade stories? Okay, then. Let's go get ready for the trial. I'll work on the expert testimony. You two make sure every member of your family is on board.",
        "Nora: Okay.",

        "Destiny: Oh, he will win.",
        "Shaun: You already opened up a world of hurt in that family.",
        "Greg: I gave them an option. Let me worry about the surgery, okay? If it even happens.",
        "Matthew: I need you. You see that, right?",
        "Rachel: You know what I see? You have so much fight in you. You have guts and determination. I see that you get ready in half the time it took you after the accident. Every challenge you get, you meet. You can have a full life, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: I'll be a kid forever.",
        "Rachel: That is not true. You can be independent. You'll be driving soon. There are special cars.",
        "Matthew: As long as someone has to pick me up and put me in this chair, I'll need a babysitter for the rest of my life.",
        "Rachel: Not true. And you're a lucky guy in at least one way.",
        "Matthew: How's that?",
        "Rachel: You have the money and resources to do and be whatever you want.",
        "Matthew: A basketball player?",
        "Rachel: Okay, almost anything. That's why I can't testify in court for you. I don't think you should have this surgery. You can have a full, great life just the way you are now.",

        "Ford: Now, if the network wanted us to start live, then we would all sit down--",
        "Dorian: What are you two babbling about?",
        "Ford: Our new show. This is the pilot.",
        "Dorian: What new show?",
        "David: Ours, yours, and mine--although that billing may change.",
        "Dorian: David!",
        "David: Come on, think about it. It's going to be so much fun. Look. The prodigal award-winning actor comes home and moves back in with the gorgeous yet quirky women, and now we have a baby and a crazy ex-husband. That's a bonus.",
        "Dorian: Wait a minute. Are we talking about a slice-of-life reality show or one of those shows where the audience votes who gets to stay in the house and who leaves?",

        "Ford: Hmm. Nah, it's too done.",
        "David: Yeah. I always find voting confusing.",

        "David: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We got plenty of peril. Todd Manning is a walking crime spree.",
        "Dorian: Oh, David!",
        "David: Come on, think about this. You're going to have your very own show that I'm the star of. We're still thinking of the name.",
        "Ford: How about \"Real Lords of Llanview\"?",
        "David: Or \"Cramer vs. Cramer vs. Cramer\"? Which do you like?",
        "Dorian: David! You want me to star on a reality show?",
        "David: No, I want you to be my co-star on a reality show.",

        "Markko: Still...",
        "Langston: Markko, what's the alternative? Because you can't keep this up. You can't work two jobs and go to school. You gonna give up school?",
        "Markko: I'll put it together.",
        "Langston: Markko, I was alone for a year after my parents died because I couldn't ask for help. And when I see how happy people were to help, I wish I would have spoken up sooner. People have been so generous to me. Do you know how happy it would make me to be able to give that back? Just let me help you.",

        "Woman: She probably gave him a black eye.",
        "David: Don't be a baby, Priscilla. This is real-life drama!",
        "Ford: All right. Order some Band-Aids. Did we get all that on tape?",
        "Dorian: Oh, speaking of tape, I would like that tape, right? Give me the tape. Give me the camera!",
        "Cameraman: She's crazy. I'm out of here.",

        "David: Sure. I'm doing this for both of us, Dorian.",

        "David: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll keep the slapfights to a minimum to make it real.",
        "Dorian: No! No! I--I will not have my family used to fuel some basic cable train wreck.",
        "David: Bite your tongue. This is going to be a network train wreck.",

        "T\u00e9a: Get someone else, okay?",
        "Todd: Well, I want you. I guess that is a conflict. Not to mention the fact that last time you and Blair were in a courtroom together, you were at each other's throat. She went on, I recall, about some little secret you had.",
