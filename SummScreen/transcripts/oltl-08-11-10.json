        "Todd and Dani spend time with Tea before she goes to hospice. Tea tells them that she named Blair in her will as Dani's guardian in the event that anything should happen to Todd. John warns Kelly and Rex to drop the Bennett Thompson case. Eli returns to his room at the Palace while Kelly is in there snooping. He shreds evidence of his police record while she is hiding under the bed. She texts Rex and he pays a bellhop to call Eli down to the lobby. She puts the shredded documents in her purse to reconstruct later. Eli shreds Tea's will and replaces it with a false document.",
        "Viki and Charlie return from vacation and David spills the beans about Jessica's pregnancy and asks her if Brody is the father. Natalie tells Brody that she is pregnant and he is shocked that she is keeping the baby even though she doesn't know if he or John is the father. He tells her that he feels obliged to tell Jessica that he could be the father of Natalie's baby. Rex asks John if he knows why Natalie is acting strangely. John overhears Natalie asking Brody not to tell anyone about her baby."

        "Viki: Okay. Hello? Anybody home? Jessie!",
        "Jessica: Hi! Haven't you two done enough relaxing?",
        "Charlie: After what David and Dorian put us through, we deserve another month off. Mwah.",
        "Jessica: Well, I'm just so happy that you guys are back.",
        "Viki: Oh, me, too, darling. Oh, it's so good to see you. So tell us. What did we miss? Ah? What's been going on while we were away?",

        "Cop: Eli Clarke is back at the Palace.",
        "John: When?",
        "Cop: He just picked up his mail at the front desk.",
        "John: Okay. So he was out at the time that Cris was attacked and the Thompson file was stolen.",
        "Cop: Yeah. What should we do next?",
        "John: I'm gonna call around. I'm gonna see if Eli has got an alibi.",
        "Cop: Okay.",
        "John: Hey, Murph. If Natalie calls, put her right through, okay? I need to know if she turned anything up.",

        "Natalie: Brody, I'm pregnant.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry. What did you say?",
        "Natalie: I'm pregnant.",
        "Brody: Oh. Uh...",
        "Natalie: You okay?",
        "Brody: Yeah, yeah. I'm just surprised.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I was, too.",
        "Brody: And this baby, it's John's, right, not mine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: John, I'm glad you're here. I need to talk to you.",
        "John: Kelly sent you. I'm gonna tell you the same thing that I told her. Drop the Bennett Thompson investigation.",

        "Dani: No. All we want-- we just want to say good-bye.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's all?",
        "Todd: Yeah. That's all, but if you'd like us to put up a fight, we'd be happy to oblige you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Please, please, please don't put up a fight, okay? It's better this way. I need to go to hospice by myself.",
        "Todd: No. It's not better this way. You're wrong about that, and no matter how much you try to convince me, you never will. You shouldn't be dying alone.",
        "Dani: Todd.",

        "Eli: Hey, Blair, long time, no see. Actually, I just got back to the Palace. Yeah. I had to get out of the office for a while. Oh, I was starting to feel kind of trapped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Here on out, you, Kelly, everyone else, leave the investigating to us.",
        "Rex: Okay.",
        "John: I'm serious.",
        "Rex: No. So am I. Ever since Bennett Thompson paid me a visit in Boston and drugged me without me even seeing him, I was just lucky to get out of there alive.",
        "John: You should be. You got lucky.",
        "Rex: Don't get me wrong. I like adventure just as much as the next guy, but I got a kid to think about. You know what I mean. Sorry. I guess you don't know, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You're pregnant. Are you sure this isn't one of those sympathetic twin things?",
        "Natalie: I had a blood test done and then redone.",
        "Brody: Okay, but Jessica is pregnant, too. We're gonna be a family.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I'm well aware of that.",
        "Brody: And you and me, we only slept together that one time.",
        "Natalie: Brody, that is all it takes, okay? We were hammered, and we were heartbroken. We weren't exactly thinking about protection.",
        "Brody: So are you saying this baby is mine?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I don't know anything. I mean, the truth is, this baby could just as easily be yours as it could be John's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So tell us everything that happened while we were away. Come on. What have we missed?",
        "Jessica: Oh, it was pretty quiet, except there was this one little thing.",
        "Viki: Uh-huh.",
        "Jessica: You guys should sit down for this.",
        "Viki: Everything all right?",
        "Jessica: Everything is great--sit--better than great, actually.",

        "Jessica: Here it goes. Mom, Charlie--",
        "David: Well, well, well, well, well, look who's here. Didn't think you two would have the guts to show your faces around here again.",
        "Viki: David, this is our house. We live here.",

        "Dani: You're not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay. Listen. I--",
        "Todd: Why don't we just drop the whole thing, okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: Let's drop it, okay? Let's just drop it. There is one thing, Todd, you need to know.",
        "Dani: Oh, I don't think I can take any more.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not, relatively speaking, bad news. Todd, I have asked Blair to be Dani's legal guardian.",
        "Todd: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "T\u00e9a: In case you can't do it. Blair cares about you. She loves you. I gave her a book on all things Daniella, so in case something happens, she'll know what to do.",
        "Todd: Nothing is gonna happen. She's not gonna lose me.",
        "Dani: You can't say that. You don't know that for sure.",
        "Todd: Well, no. I do. Here and now, I promise I'm gonna do my best to make sure you never lose me or anyone else you care about, for that matter.",
        "Dani: I don't even know how to say good-bye to my mom.",
        "T\u00e9a: Neither do I, but we'll figure it out together, okay?",

        "David: Miss a day, miss a lot, huh, Viki?",
        "Viki: Jessie, is this true?",
        "David: Of course, Jessica is not the only one with great news.",
        "Charlie: What, you're pregnant, too?",
        "David: I'm in love. Her name is Mandy, and she's smoking hot.",
        "Viki: That's very nice, David. I want to talk about Jessica.",
        "David: Did you also hear that hell froze over? Clint and Dori are back together, too.",
        "Charlie: Look, David. I realize you're hungover.",
        "David: If you realize that, you wouldn't be screaming.",
        "Viki: Jessie?",
        "Jessica: Surprise.",
        "Charlie: Congratulations.",
        "Viki: Oh, sweetheart, I can't believe it!",
        "David: Why can't you believe it? Maybe it's just me, but fertile Phoebe over there seems to be pregnant every other year. I mean, when are you gonna start sharing the stage? Poor cousin Natalie, she needs her turn in the spotlight, too, you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Oh, I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I know.",
        "Brody: Jessica and I just got back together. We're gonna have a baby of our own. We're gonna get married. I can't have a baby with her and another one with her twin sister.",
        "Natalie: Whoa. We don't know anything for sure.",
        "Brody: Except that we can't be sure either way, right?",
        "Natalie: It'll be a few months before we can get a paternity test.",
        "Brody: How long have you known?",
        "Natalie: I found out when Jessica did.",
        "Brody: That's why you were sick. Why didn't you say anything?",
        "Natalie: Because I was still trying to wrap my mind around all of this, okay, and I didn't tell you because obviously you had a lot going on.",
        "Brody: Well, if you were worried about how I'd handle it, why tell me at all?",
        "Natalie: Because when I was done freaking out, Gigi made me realize I couldn't keep this from you.",
        "Brody: Gigi knows?",
        "Natalie: Yes, Brody. I needed someone to confide in who wasn't gonna tell John or Jess or my mom or Roxy. Come on. Gigi is not gonna say anything to anyone, not even Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Wow. I am so sorry.",
        "John: Forget about it.",
        "Rex: Just so you know, I'm also sorry about the way things went down in Boston, too. I hope this hasn't thrown a wrench in your investigation.",
        "John: From here on out, I think I'll keep the details to myself.",
        "Rex: I understand. I'll just stick to tracking down birth parents from now on.",
        "John: That's a good idea. You're still here. Is there something else?",
        "Rex: Yeah. I didn't come here to talk about Bennett Thompson. I came here to talk about Natalie.",
        "John: What about her?",
        "Rex: Have you noticed anything weird with her lately?",
        "John: She's always a little weird. That's one of the things I like about her.",
        "Rex: Weirder than usual, because I think it's pretty obvious that something is up with her.",
        "John: No. I hadn't noticed anything.",
        "Rex: Really? Is that because you don't think anything is wrong or because you've been too busy with the Bennett Thompson case to notice?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: I actually have a few more things I need to finish up here. Yeah. I'm gonna be working from the Palace for the rest of the day. Sure would love to see you later, though. Everything okay over there? Is jack still going on about how I'm some kind of crazed murderer? Oh, of course he's freaked out. I'm about to be his new stepdad. What kid wants that? It's okay. I promise I'm gonna talk to that Jack, and I'm gonna get him to see the real me. Ha ha ha! He really has a wild imagination.",

        "Todd: All right.",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't want to leave with you guys feeling this way, feeling bad.",
        "Dani: I don't think there's any other way.",
        "Todd: Oh, man, I have to kick some ass.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, don't. I don't know what you have in mind, but I don't think it's appropriate.",
        "Todd: No. It's totally appropriate to kick someone's ass, humiliate them, make them feel bad about themselves. Who's up for it?",
        "Dani: You like money honey?",
        "Todd: I'm the champion.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're not serious, are you?",
        "Todd: I'm always serious about schooling someone.",
        "Dani: No, no, no, no, no. I rock this game. You're gonna be the one getting schooled.",
        "Todd: Big words.",
        "Dani: How about big game?",
        "T\u00e9a: She got it from her mama.",
        "Todd: All right. So would either of you chicks care to put your money, your money honey, where your mouths are, hmm?",
        "Dani: I call banker.",
        "Todd: No. I'm the banker.",
        "Dani: Right. Like you can be trusted around money.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "Todd: Like mother, like daughter, eh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: David, perhaps you should bypass the bar temporarily.",
        "David: I didn't go to law school.",
        "Viki: Abstain from imbibing.",
        "David: My teeth are stained? Where?",
        "Viki: Oh, David, for heaven's sakes, quit drinking for a while.",
        "David: Absolutely not. It's a lot fewer calories than food.",
        "Jessica: He's been like this for days.",
        "David: And why shouldn't I be? Life is a big bowl of suck.",
        "Jessica: Yours is maybe.",
        "David: There's no point to it. You're born. Then you start losing definition, and you die. Hey, did you hear that, little one? You stay in there as long as you can because once you get squeezed out, it's all downhill from there.",
        "Charlie: David, just step away from the baby, huh?",
        "David: I am telling it like it is. Somebody has got to.",
        "Viki: David! Look. I don't know what you and Dorian have done to each other this time, but that is absolutely no excuse for this boorish behavior! Now, unless you can get over it and be happy for Jessica, I suggest you take your misery elsewhere!",
        "David: Like another wing?",
        "Charlie: Like another zip code.",
        "Jessica: Or solar system.",
        "Viki: Don't you have something to say?",
        "David: You're right. You're absolutely right. Jessica, this baby--this miracle, this gift-- is it Brody's?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Look, Natalie, I'm sorry. I overreacted.",
        "Natalie: I'm not sure if that's possible in this situation.",
        "Brody: Yeah, but I acted like you'd done something to me, and the truth is, you wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for me. It's not your fault.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. You're right. Thank you for that, but it doesn't change the fact that there are two people that this could really devastate.",
        "Brody: I know. We have to think about Jessica and John. It's up to us to make sure they don't get hurt.",
        "Natalie: And we don't really have a lot of options.",
        "Brody: I know, and I want you to know, whatever you decide, I won't leave you hanging.",
        "Natalie: Thanks, but you don't have to do anything. I've already decided. I'm keeping this baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Well, you know, I'd like to think that no matter how many cases I was working, if there was something wrong with Natalie, I'd know.",
        "Rex: See, that's what I thought. So what's wrong with her?",
        "Natalie's voice: I'm pregnant. And you're okay with not telling anyone?",
        "John's voice: For Jess and Brody's sake.",
        "Natalie's voice: At least in the first trimester or until at least I start to show. It's cool, right? It's our little secret?",
        "John: Nothing's wrong, Rex.",
        "Rex: Come on. John, Natalie has been a bundle of nerves for weeks now, okay, and it's getting worse. And for some reason, she's confiding in Gigi rather than her own brother.",
        "John: Maybe you should ask Gigi.",
        "Rex: I did. She won't tell me.",
        "John: Then maybe it's private.",
        "Rex: Natty and I don't keep secrets from each other.",
        "John: You know, Rex, I don't know what to tell you. If Natalie's keeping something from you, then that's between the two of you.",
        "Rex: So, you're saying you know what's up or that nothing's up?",
        "John: What I'm saying is, you're being a good brother for worrying, but you probably can stop.",
        "Rex: Stop? Just like that?",
        "John: Truth is, Rex, Natalie's great. And when she's ready to tell you, I'm sure she will. All right? So, why don't you just let her be?",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Rex: I'm sure you can find something else to occupy your time.",

        "T\u00e9a: No. You know what? I don't want to go on a farewell tour of Llanview. I mean, can you imagine going to see Viki or the Vegas and dropping the bomb on them that I'm dying of a brain tumor? Come on, now. That wouldn't be fair to them.",

        "Natalie: Yeah. I mean, I wasn't going to at first. I got as far as the clinic, and then I changed my mind.",
        "Brody: Why?",
        "Natalie: Because by the time this baby is born, John and I will have started our family.",
        "Brody: But it might not even be John's. You said so yourself. There's as much a chance this baby's mine.",
        "Natalie: Yes, there is a--a chance that this baby is yours, but a very small chance, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm convinced this baby is John's.",

        "Jessica: Excuse me?",
        "David: I mean, one day you're Bess, another day you're Tess. Then you're a teenager. Now you're pregnant. Who knows what your others have been up to? I am saying this for your own protection.",
        "Viki: Okay, Jessica, ignore him, darling, please. Just ignore him.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, he'll be living somewhere else soon. Hopefully tonight.",
        "Jessica: It's okay. I'm fine, really, because I have even more good news. And David cannot ruin this because I know for a fact he doesn't know what it is.",

        "Rex: A minute or 2. Maybe less.",
        "Kelly: Hold that.",
        "Rex: Okay. I had a bellhop tell him that there was a mysterious person downstairs waiting to see him. Although as soon as he gets there and sees the only people there are the ones waiting for the annual meeting of the Llanview society of decorators, he's gonna come running back up.",

        "Brody: No. Of course not.",
        "Natalie: It has taken years for John and me to get back to where we are now, and I don't want to risk losing that, either. But it's too late.",

        "Natalie: As far as I'm concerned, this baby is John's, no matter what, and the only reason I am telling you is so that when John and I go around telling everyone the news, you're not blindsided.",

        "Natalie: It doesn't have to.",
        "Brody: It is one thing not to tell them that we slept together. We both thought we had lost the people we loved most. We took comfort in each other. If they found out about that one indiscretion, they'd probably forgive us, but this? I don't think I can justify keeping this a secret.",
