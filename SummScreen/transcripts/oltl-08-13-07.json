        "Clint: One last hand, and then you've to get ready for Monte Carlo night. I'm very glad that you're going with me this evening.",
        "Dorian: I wouldn't miss it. It's going to be our first official appearance together as a couple, and at a grand gala. I bet we'll be the center of attention.",
        "Clint: I know how much you hate that.",
        "Dorian: But I will only have eyes for you.",
        "Starr: Um --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: What are you looking at, porn?",
        "Cristian: No, I was just looking at some shots I took the other night in Angel Square.",
        "Sarah: Can I see?",
        "Cristian: No. No, you can't. See, I -- I can't do this with people around. It's just one of my things. I don't like anyone seeing my work till it's done.",
        "Sarah: I get that. I mean, I could never work on a song unless I was alone, too. I felt like it ruined the magic, or the moment or -- I know it sounds cheesy, but I was really superstitious about it.",
        "Cristian: Oh, believe me, I understand. So, how are you doing? You ok?",
        "Sarah: Yeah. I keep thinking about Hunter. He turned out to be such a jerk, but he didn't deserve what he got.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Sarah: Saved by the bell.",
        "Cristian: Yep.",
        "Antonio: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Come in, man.",
        "Antonio: Got a minute?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, sure. I'm just hanging out with Sarah.",
        "Antonio: Flash?",
        "Sarah: Uh-huh. The Sarah formerly known as Flash. How are you doing?",
        "Antonio: I'm great. Great. I barely recognized you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Hmm. Did you know we had a message?",
        "Jessica: I didn't even hear the phone ring.",
        "Nash: Huh.",
        "[Answering machine beeps]",
        "Natalie's voice: Hey, guys, Jess. It's Natalie, your evil twin. Look, I know you just got home from the hospital, and I -- I just wanted to remind you -- tonight's the Monte Carlo benefit at The Palace. And I -- I'd really love it if you could be there because I'm a little nervous. You know, planning this thing is my first official duty as a B.E. employee. Whatever. Anyway, send good thoughts. Love you.",
        "[Answering machine beeps]",
        "Nash: She sounds nervous.",
        "Jessica: Well, she planned that entire event herself, and I cannot believe that I forgot. Oh.",
        "Nash: Well, you've had more important stuff on your mind.",
        "Jessica: Want to go?",
        "Nash: No. We just got back.",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Nash: Oh -- but -- I mean, hey, if you're up to it, then -- I mean, it would be an amazing chance for me to scrounge up some investors for this place. But only if you're up to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey, Mom.",
        "Viki: Hey. So, is everything all right down at the carriage house, hmm?",
        "Natalie: Look, I heard about what happened this morning. And I'm sorry that Miles staying here is causing problems between you and Todd.",
        "Viki: Oh, Natalie -- darling, we talked about this. Please, don't pretend you didn't know exactly what was going to happen when Todd found out that Miles was living here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You are so handsome.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Blair: Yes, you are. Isn't he, Todd?",
        "Todd: They all look alike to me.",
        "Blair: They do not.",
        "Todd: Yeah, a baby's a baby.",
        "Blair: Well, he's not a baby anymore. My goodness, look how big he is. Gosh, it -- he reminds me a lot -- I mean, he looks a lot like Jack did when he was that age. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Forgive me, father. It's been a while since my last confession.",
        "Priest: And by \"a while\" --",
        "John: A while. I probably don't have the time to give you a rundown of all the sins I've probably committed in that time.",
        "Priest: Well, then why are you here?",
        "John: To confess to one I may be about to commit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Uh -- Dorian and I were -- we were playing cards.",
        "Starr: Is that what you call it?",
        "Clint: Say something.",
        "Dorian: Clint and I are going to casino night at The Palace. And -- he was giving me a few pointers.",
        "Langston: Oh.",
        "Starr: Right, because Aunt Dorian has always been a card shark. Didn't she tell you that?",
        "Clint: No, but I figured that out when she hustled me for all my grapes.",
        "Markko: Rich people like them bet for fruit?",
        "Langston: Well, I guess that's why they're rich.",
        "Starr: Um -- we were going to hang out at the pool, but --",
        "Cole: But -- but -- but we can -- we can go to the park or something.",
        "Dorian: Don't be silly. You -- we're through here, anyway. Enjoy yourselves. Hang out. Order a pizza. I have cash hidden in the usual place.",
        "Starr: I have my own cash.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but this way, I'll feel like, you know, it's my treat, and -- uh -- I am really very sorry that the judge denied your mother bail. I don't know what he was thinking.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I heard that she changed her plea to not guilty, which I assume means she's going to fight the charges.",
        "Cole: Yeah. You know, she should never have confessed in the first place.",
        "Dorian: Never confess to anything. Certainly not in circumstances like this. Oh, but you -- you must remember that, kids.",
        "Clint: Yeah. On that wise note, I'm going to go. And I'll come back and pick you up in about half an hour.",
        "Dorian: Good. Because if you stay, I'll never get ready.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Clint: Uh -- good night, all.",
        "Langston: Good night.",
        "Dorian: So, are you going to be all right?",
        "Starr: Yes, I'll be fine.",
        "Dorian: Oh -- half an hour? How do you men do that?",
        "Markko: Sorry we interrupted you and your boyfriend making out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So you want to go schmooze?",
        "Nash: Don't think I can?",
        "Jessica: I know that you can.",
        "Nash: Uh-huh.",
        "Jessica: You're very smooth when you want to be.",
        "Nash: Oh, hardly.",
        "Jessica: Of course you are. When we first met with Tess, you know, you borrowed that rich guy's car so you could look fancy for your business lunch, remember?",
        "Nash: I remember you stole it.",
        "Jessica: Good thing I did.",
        "Nash: Not complaining.",
        "Jessica: See? Our life is perfect.",
        "Nash: Hmm. Except for one thing. I need to scare myself up an investor for this place, don't I?",
        "Jessica: Why the rush?",
        "Nash: I need to be able to support my girls.",
        "Jessica: Bree and I have everything that we need.",
        "Nash: Yeah, but it's -- it's -- ok, it's not really about my girls. It's kind of about me. Look, I need to be able to get this place up and running. This place is our future. So that I can give you a wonderful life.",
        "Jessica: You already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Look, I knew that Todd was going to be upset, but I had no idea that he was going to go off on you the way he did.",
        "Viki: Are you kidding? What did you expect?",
        "Natalie: I don't know.",
        "Viki: Well, darling, you knew it wasn't going to be good. Look, I said Miles could stay here. I will accept responsibility. But you have to try and understand Todd.",
        "Natalie: I don't know if that's possible.",
        "Viki: Well, honey, you say that you know what it's like to feel like an outcast -- that the whole world is against you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Well, that's how Todd has felt his entire life. He doesn't even know how to behave if he isn't fighting with somebody. And he finds it really, really hard to trust people. But when he does, he's the most loyal human being on earth -- until he feels he's been betrayed.",
        "Natalie: And he feels betrayed by seeing Miles here?",
        "Viki: I would in his shoes, wouldn't you?",
        "Natalie: So did it get ugly?",
        "Viki: It was what I expected, ok? I mean, I tried to tell him what you said about Miles being an outcast the way you and Todd are, but he doesn't want to hear that. He sees it that I chose Miles over him.",
        "Natalie: So does that mean that you've changed your mind about Miles staying here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You want to hold him?",
        "Todd: Will that shut you up?",
        "Michael: Well, you know what? I'll -- I'll take him.",
        "Blair: No, I'm fine.",
        "Michael: No, no, no, he looks like he's going to start crying. I -- you know, we wouldn't that, would we?",
        "Blair: No --",
        "Michael: Ok, come here. Come here, buddy.",
        "Marcie: Michael, I think you need to relax. I mean, Tommy actually likes Todd.",
        "Michael: Look, he's my son. I think that -- I think he wants to be with his daddy.",
        "Todd: Hey, I don't care. I was just trying to shut her up.",
        "Blair: They grow so fast, don't they?",
        "Marcie: I know. Makes you want another one.",
        "Todd: Oh, God -- enough about babies. I just -- I want to find your brother. Do you know where he is?",
        "Michael: John? Why?",
        "Todd: Well, this Hunter guy's dead, so if we have a prayer of nailing Miles Laurence, we're going to have John coerce a confession out of him. You think your brother's up to that?",
        "Michael: I don't know. I mean, why you asking me?",
        "Marcie: If Miles did everything that you said he did, then John is not going to let him get away with it.",
        "Blair: He did it, Marcie. He tortured Todd to the point of death, practically. And he gave him false hope that his son was still alive. He's sadistic.",
        "Todd: So am I. And that son of a bitch is going to pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I know something about a kid, who in a way is being kept from his real father.",
        "Priest: A kidnapping?",
        "John: No. No, nothing like that. The people who are raising him now -- they -- they didn't know. They thought he was an orphan when they adopted him. These people are good people. Good parents -- the best. And they love their son. And this -- this other family -- they're -- they're something of a mess, but they're also torn up about it, too. And I can change that. But doing that -- it'll destroy these other people if they have their son ken away from them. Priest: What do you need from me, son?",
        "John: I guess, father, I'm -- I'm asking you if I have the right to make that decision. If I have the right to make that call.",
        "Priest: You sound personally involved in all this.",
        "John: The boy's my nephew. My brother and his wife will do anything for him. I don't know what to do, Father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: How are you two holding up after what happened at the club?",
        "Cristian: You mean after I killed a guy? Ok, I guess. As ok as I can be.",
        "Sarah: Cris, you didn't have any other choice. And besides, the whole thing was my fault, anyway. Hunter would have been long gone if he didn't think he could get some Buchanan money from me.",
        "Antonio: You know, the guy had a jacket a mile long, Sarah.",
        "Sarah: What's that? Cop speak for \"you were sleeping with a lowlife\"? I already figured that one out, but thanks.",
        "Antonio: I was trying to be a nice guy. You almost got my brother killed.",
        "Sarah: He saved my neck. I won't forget it.",
        "Cristian: Whatever. We're all ok.",
        "Sarah: My Uncle Todd is not going to be ok.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, he actually thought that this guy could --",
        "Sarah: Hunter. His name was Hunter.",
        "Antonio: Right, he thought that Hunter could help nail Miles to the wall.",
        "Cristian: Todd's got a wild imagination.",
        "Sarah: He's not your favorite person, is he?",
        "Antonio: Well, nobody can stand Todd except for Blair and his own kids.",
        "Sarah: He's not that bad.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah, he is. If I never see him again, it'll be too soon.",
        "Sarah: Whatever that's supposed to mean.",
        "Antonio: Well, you may not look the same, but you still have the same Flash attitude.",
        "Sarah: Dude, I changed my hair color, I didn't get a personality transplant.",
        "Antonio: Dude, that's good.",
        "[Sarah chuckles]",
        "Sarah: Good?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, good. You can take care of yourself.",
        "Sarah: Huh. Usually. Like I said before, Cristian saved my life. Look, I'll -- I'll talk to my Uncle Todd about all of this. I'm sure he'll be pissed for a while, but he'll get over it.",
        "Cristian: Losing his kid? I doubt it.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, no, not Todd. Hey, you really think that your boyfriend would have given up Laurence?",
        "Sarah: For the right price, definitely, without a doubt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Let's go to the party.",
        "Nash: You sure you're up to it?",
        "Jessica: I'm not an invalid, Nash. Listen, you go get the first shower, and I will call the babysitter and see if she can keep Bree for a little while longer.",
        "Nash: Nah, you take longer. You go first, I'll make the call.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, right, mirror boy.",
        "Nash: \"Mirror boy\"? No, no, I wake up like this. I have done a full day's work around here by the time you're done drying your hair. You go.",
        "Jessica: Well, let's see. Let's see about that. Let's take off these clothes.",
        "Nash: Oh, really?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Nash: Oh, yeah. Well, two can play that game, honey bunny.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's what I had in mind.",
        "Nash: Oh, yeah?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Where are you?",
        "Jessica: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Yeah, Marcie, you know, we should probably get him home.",
        "Marcie: No. We haven't even eaten yet. Don't be silly.",
        "Michael: We'll get them to pack it up.",
        "Marcie: It's not late, Michael, please. The waitress is bringing over our food right now.",
        "Waitress: Here you go.",
        "Marcie: Thanks.",
        "Todd: God, I had the death certificate right in front of me. Why didn't I believe it? Why did I believe some stupid note from Spencer Truman? I mean, the guy's dead! He's still jerking my chain!",
        "Blair: Todd, you did everything you could to find your son.",
        "Todd: Everything's not good enough.",
        "Marcie: Is he ok?",
        "Blair: He will be. He's, I think, accepting the fact that his son's really dead.",
        "Marcie: Well, I can't imagine that.",
        "Blair: Yeah. I just hope that nothing else happens to give him false hope, you know?",
        "Michael: Yeah. I hope not, too. Priest: This is a very difficult situation because your brother and his wife would be devastated to lose their child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah. Thing is, I also know the kid's real father. He thinks his boy is dead. It's tearing the guy up.",
        "Priest: What does your conscience tell you?",
        "John: Hmm. I don't think anybody should be playing God. Well, it never turns out too good. I just don't know what to do, father. I can't handle this on my own.",
        "Thomas' voice: Maybe I can help you, Son.",
        "John: Dad?",
        "Thomas: Talk to me, Johnny. Maybe we can solve your problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: We were not \"making out.\" No -- Clint was about to leave, and he was kissing me goodbye.",
        "Starr: You can save it, Aunt Dorian.",
        "Langston: You know what? It's ok. It's actually kind of cool.",
        "Dorian: Kind of cool? That people of a certain age still do things like that?",
        "Markko: Yeah. I didn't know it was possible.",
        "Langston: Oh --",
        "Dorian: You got a lot to learn. And in case you're wondering -- it does get better with time.",
        "Markko: Huh.",
        "Dorian: Enjoy.",
        "Cole: Just --",
        "[Langston chuckles]",
        "Langston: She is so cool.",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Cole: Whew.",
        "Starr: Are you worried about your mom?",
        "Cole: Yeah. You know, it's not fair that we're here hanging by this fancy pool and she's in that dungeon.",
        "Starr: I know how you feel. You know, you don't have to stay here if you're too upset.",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Cole: No, they won't let me see her anymore tonight, so I'll just hang. I have to get used to the whole idea, all right? Being here is definitely helping.",
        "Starr: Good. Do you want to go swimming?",
        "Langston: Ew.",
        "Markko: What?",
        "Langston: Those were on the ground.",
        "Markko: They're fresh. Here.",
        "Langston: No! Ew. I don't want one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: So, how did you get mixed up with a jerk like Hunter, anyway?",
        "Sarah: Default.",
        "Antonio: No. No, no, no, I don't buy that. You've never had trouble getting guys.",
        "Sarah: So you've never gotten with anyone without knowing her whole story? Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot about you and Jessica.",
        "Antonio: It's ok. It's over.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, me and Hunter, too. You can't get any more over than dead.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. So, how long are you going to be in Llanview? You going to be here for a while?",
        "Sarah: Looks like it. I have a minor cash flow problem. But I do have an idea.",
        "Cristian: She's going to work as a waitress at Capricorn, if that's ok with you, of course.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, you 21 yet?",
        "Sarah: Yes.",
        "Cristian: I checked.",
        "Sarah: Huh. Unbelievable.",
        "Antonio: And what about your -- your singing career? I thought you had a record deal.",
        "Sarah: Flash did. But when I got strangled, that option ran out. I don't sing much anymore. It just doesn't feel the same. But I am not going to leave the business completely, no thanks to friends of mine.",
        "Antonio: I see. Well, is there anything I can do to help?",
        "Sarah: Actually, there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: No, I gave you my word. I won't go back on that. Miles can stay, temporarily.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. I just -- look, Mom, I don't want to cause problems for you.",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm. You should have thought of that before. Ok? Look, I'll handle Todd. But you have to make sure that Miles does not provoke him. Ok?",
        "Natalie: It won't happen, Mom. Miles is a good guy. I know that.",
        "Viki: Yeah. Well, I hope he deserves your trust in him.",
        "Natalie: So anyway, are you going to come to the benefit tonight?",
        "Viki: Yes, of course I am. It's your official coming out as an officer of B.E. Enterprises. I wouldn't miss that.",
        "Natalie: Cool. Well, I got to get there early, so I guess I -- I better get dressed.",
        "Viki: Ok.",
        "Natalie: Mom? Are we good?",
        "Viki: Of course we are. Always.",
        "Natalie: Just so you know -- I don't take that for granted.",
        "Viki: But you should. Go get dressed.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Miles: Hi.",
        "Viki: Natalie's getting dressed.",
        "Miles: Oh. Should I wait back at the carriage house?",
        "Viki: No, that's not necessary. Come in.",
        "Miles: Thank you. Yeah, I wanted to tell you -- I'm really sorry for causing trouble between you and your brother.",
        "Viki: Are you? You know, I'm not really worried about my relationship with my brother. But I am worried about Natalie. And that's quite another matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: All right! This must be my lucky night. All my favorite high rollers in the same place at the same time. Just show up at the door. There's plenty of room for everybody. And bring your bucks and your tux.",
        "Todd: Buchanan enterprises, huh?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, what is this?",
        "Roxy: This is the shindig at The Palace.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Roxy: Monte Carlo night. In other words, that translates to g-a-m-bling. And Natty arranged everything. And she and big daddy Clint -- they're the hosts with the most.",
        "Blair: Yeah? Are -- are you going?",
        "Roxy: Hell, yeah! I am the main wheeler dealer. Like, you know, Blackjack or sump'n sump'n like that.",
        "Todd: We should go. It's for a good cause.",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "Todd: Well, you know, Natalie's been hanging out with Miles a lot lately, so he'll be there. You know what I mean?",
        "Blair: Ok.",

        "John: Michael says losing Tommy will break Marcie's heart. Because they can't have kids of their own. If they take -- they take Tommy away, they probably won't be able to adopt again. As far as they're concerned, Tommy is their son. He's a McBain all the way.",
        "Thomas: It sounds like you know what to do.",
        "John: I love my brother. And this little guy -- Tommy, he's a hell of a kid. You know, you should see him. And if it was just the matter of the adoption being illegal, then -- then I would know what to do, but that's not it. If there's right and a wrong in this situation, I wish I knew which is which.",

        "Dorian: Hmm. But still, if -- ahem -- they are dating each other, if you object, it may just push them closer together. And on the other hand, it's much more likely that she invited him here so that she could separate him from some of -- well, Spencer Truman's money. Yes, and all in a very good cause.",
