        "John: Thank you.",
        "Bartender: Congratulations, Dr. Saybrooke.",
        "Marty: Thank you.",
        "John: To the newest member of Llanview hospital's psychiatric staff.",
        "Marty: I did it. Got my life back, all of it.",
        "John: To work and not work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Viki, please be honest. Did you miss me like a plant misses the sun?",
        "Viki: Actually, I finally saw your commercial.",
        "David: Oh. So you do watch television?",
        "Viki: David, you were on the classic movie channel.",
        "David: So, what did you think?",
        "Viki: I was very proud of you.",
        "David: Hmm.",
        "Viki: I think you must have helped a lot of people with your--your wit and your charm. A product like that can be a very tough sell.",
        "David: You know, I shadowed a proctologist to make my performance more...authentic.",
        "Viki: Okay, so tell me, what projects have you got in the works?",
        "David: Oh, I read scripts from time to time, but I find the dialogue can be so constraining. I like to think of myself more as an auteur. A provocateur. One of those European words. I find it so much easier just to be myself.",
        "Viki: Isn't it very hard to make a living just being yourself?",
        "David: Not necessarily. A handsome man with a charming personality and a wide range of entertaining friends, for example, might find himself--",
        "Viki: The star of his own reality show?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Nash? What do you want from me?",
        "Ford: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Jessica: Who are you?",
        "Ford: My name is Ford.",
        "Jessica: What are you doing hiding in my bushes?",
        "Ford: Relax. I'm a friend of a friend of yours.",
        "Jessica: No, no, you've been following me, you've been stalking me for days! You've been leaving presents for my daughter!",
        "Ford: Your daughter? No, you have the wrong guy. Look, let me show you.",
        "[Plant pot shatters]",
        "[Viki gasps]",
        "David: Oh, my God, you killed Ford. I'll never work in this town again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Greg chuckles]",
        "[Dr. Wright gasps]",
        "Dr. Wright: I'm sorry we're late.",
        "Greg: Yeah, something came up. Wow, look at you, bro. You do clean up, huh? And don't you look lovely as always?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, I'm going to spoil you, but don't get used to it, because I cleaned a couple old ladies out at bingo. Now, listen, I just want to cheer you up. And if I haven't said I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. If I knew you and Fish were going to start kissing in the alleyway, I would have sent out champagne, not Cristian Vega. Speaking of which--can we have a couple of drinks, please? Hey.",
        "Kyle: It's not your fault.",
        "Roxy: Hmm. So what happened after Cristian left?",
        "Kyle: Well, according to Oliver, it was just in the nick of time.",
        "Roxy: For what? A three-way?",
        "[Roxy laughs]",
        "Kyle: No, more like a no-way. Oliver told Cristian that he's not gay, never was.",
        "Roxy: Oh, man. What is that? You know, Rex gets mad at me, and when he does that, he says I'm not his mother. Fish can swim under any shell that he wants to, but it don't change the fact that he's as queer as a three dollar bill.",
        "Kyle: Why don't you tell him that? You're liable to get arrested.",
        "Roxy: Hmm. I love it when a man in a uniform likes to use his cuffs--on you, not me.",
        "Kyle: That's not going to happen. Not at all. I mean, according to Oliver, what happened between us in college was a--just a phase.",
        "Roxy: Hmm. Must be hell pretending to be something that you're not.",
        "Kyle: I don't feel sorry for him. Not anymore. He made his bed, he can lie in it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Yeah, I was green, but I was never that green.",
        "Layla: You think Marino will ever live this down?",
        "Oliver: No way. They'll never let up. He won't know what hit him.",
        "Layla: Cris? I thought you'd be at Capricorn by now.",
        "Cristian: You trying to get rid of me?",
        "Layla: We kind of thought we'd have the place to ourselves.",
        "Cristian: Oh, you did, huh?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm. Are you done with the bathroom? I want to take a quick shower.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah, sure, go ahead. I'm all done. Have fun.",
        "Cristian: You didn't tell her?",
        "Oliver: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Cristian: I caught you kissing Kyle this morning.",
        "Oliver: Look, I told you that--",
        "Cristian: No, I know--no, you were not assaulted, okay? You were kissing him back.",
        "Oliver: That's bull, Vega.",
        "Cristian: You can lie to yourself all you want, but lying to Layla stops right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I didn't know.",
        "Brody: John.",
        "John: You didn't know?",
        "Brody: Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want me to come back?",
        "John: No, no, it's okay. Would you give me a minute here?",
        "Marty: Uh-huh.",
        "John: You sure? It won't be long.",
        "Marty: Yeah, it's okay.",
        "John: What's up?",
        "Brody: So, I caught up with Cole in the park.",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brody: I did my bit, like I was eager for a fix. And Sergei was there.",
        "John: He recognize you from Cole's apartment?",
        "Brody: Oh, I don't think this guy forgets a face. And just so you know, it seemed like the two of them were getting into it about something when I walked up.",
        "John: All right, I'll ask Cole about it. What else?",
        "Brody: I came on strong, like you told me to. You know, told Cole to fix me up.",
        "John: And?",
        "Brody: And he did exactly what you told him to do. Said he was tapped out, that I should take a walk.",
        "John: He knew Sergei would be suspicious of you blowing through the first stash.",
        "Brody: That's what I was thinking.",
        "John: This guy is watching Cole like a hawk.",
        "Brody: Cole knows what to do.",
        "John: He does.",
        "Brody: By the way, what was that show about for the mayor before?",
        "John: Are you okay?",
        "Brody: I don't bruise easy.",
        "John: Yeah? All right, good. Well, look, I'll--I'll tell you about it some other time, all right?",
        "Brody: Yeah, cool.",
        "John: Good job.",
        "Brody: All right, thanks. We'll work that out.",
        "Marty: Everything okay?",
        "John: Yeah, everything's okay. Just a little problem with his scheduling. Could I have one more minute?",
        "Marty: Yes, take your--",
        "John: You sure?",
        "Marty: Yes, take your time. You mind if I play deejay?",
        "John: Knock yourself out.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "John: Hey. It's McBain. That file on the mayor's anti-drug campaign? It's on my desk? Genius.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Wright: So Greg was filling me in on the way over. The judge ruled in Matthew's favor. Your little brother is going to get his day in court.",
        "Rachel: Yeah. But whether he wins the right to have a surgery that can kill him, that remains to be seen.",
        "Dr. Wright: So you agree with your mother and Matthew's dad?",
        "Rachel: It's too risky.",
        "Greg: For you.",
        "Rachel: For Matthew.",
        "Greg: Well, Matthew's willing to take those risks, which aren't nearly as great as you think they are.",
        "Rachel: And I shouldn't think so, why, because you say so?",
        "Greg: No, I know so.",
        "Rachel: You don't know. You can't possibly--",
        "Greg: Everything has risks.",
        "Rachel: And risks have consequences. We're talking about my brother's life.",
        "Greg: No, we're talking about getting Matthew out of that chair because that's what he wants. Look, I know you love your brother. I just wish you wouldn't--",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Greg: That you weren't teaching him to be afraid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Look, I'm not lying to anyone, okay? I--I'm not gay.",
        "Cristian: I don't really care how you roll. Who you sleep with isn't the issue here.",
        "Oliver: Oh, except when it comes to Layla?",
        "Cristian: Because she's my friend.",
        "Oliver: But you want it to be more, so that's why you're all over this gay thing, because--",
        "Cristian: You're using her, Fish!",
        "Oliver: What, because Kyle said so? Look, you don't even know the guy, okay?",
        "Cristian: I know what I saw. You know what Layla told me, right before I found you and Kyle playing \"spin the bottle\"? What a great catch you are. That she's been looking for someone like you her whole life. You're funny, you're smart, you're someone with integrity. If you had any integrity, you'd tell Layla the truth.",
        "Greg: Yeah, well, you and Kyle don't get to decide what's true.",
        "Cristian: Okay, you're right, so why don't we let Layla decide? Tell her everything. If she wants to keep seeing you, then fine. If not--",
        "Oliver: What, what? Then you'll be waiting?",
        "Cristian: You know, I'm going to be late for work, so I'll make this real simple. Tell Layla, or I will.",
        "Layla: What's going on?",
        "Cristian: Nothing. Nothing. I was looking for my keys, but they were in my pocket the whole time. See you later.",
        "Layla: When will you be home?",
        "Cristian: I don't know--late. Why?",
        "Layla: No reason.",
        "Layla: Alone at last.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You know this guy?",
        "David: Ford's my producer. I already lost my cameraman. He was just trying to get a shot of my reunion with your mother.",
        "Jessica: Mom?",
        "Viki: Yeah, apparently David is scouting locations for a proposed reality show.",
        "Ford: Who's the ditzy blond?",
        "Viki: Excuse me--her name is Jessica. She is my daughter. And she's not ditzy.",
        "Jessica: I heard a noise out here, and when I came out, I found this guy hiding in the bushes.",
        "Ford: Uh--checking some camera angles. I was trying to get a shot through the window.",
        "Viki: Without permission! Darling, you had every right to be frightened. David, you put him up to this, right?",
        "David: Viki, considering our close bond, I thought--",
        "Jessica: No, no, no. He's been following me for days. He's been stalking me.",
        "Ford: That's not true. David, please tell them.",
        "David: Jessica, we just took the red-eye in from Los Angeles. We got here today.",
        "Ford: Here's my ticket.",
        "Jessica: Oh. My mistake. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.",
        "Viki: Someone has been stalking you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I am not teaching my brother to be afraid. Right now, my brother is so scared of the unknown, of what life in a wheelchair might be like that he's actually willing to endanger his life at an outside shot at--",
        "Greg: It's not outside.",
        "Rachel: At walking again.",
        "Greg: Look, this surgery's success is very much inside the realm of possibility, but you can't even entertain that thought.",
        "Rachel: The thought of my brother dying? You're right, I can't.",
        "Greg: You're older than Matthew. Your life experience is different.",
        "Rachel: Meaning what? He's not a recovering addict?",
        "Shaun: What do you guys want to order?",
        "Greg: That's not what I meant.",
        "Rachel: You don't know me. You don't know my mother or Matthew's father. You barely know Matthew.",
        "Greg: Which is why I'm not biased. I've studied Matthew's case. I've checked and rechecked his tests--",
        "Rachel: I'm not questioning your ability.",
        "Greg: No, you just want a 100% guarantee that he'll be safe.",
        "Rachel: Yes. Safe is good. Safe works for me.",
        "Greg: This isn't about you, Rachel.",
        "Dr. Wright: I get the feeling that it is. What's going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: So Cristian's standing there, and instead of manning up and admitting that he wanted to kiss me, Oliver says that I assaulted him.",
        "Roxy: Did Cristian believe him?",
        "Cristian: Of course not. Look, Fish is a cop. If you had really assaulted him, he would have arrested you.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, well, I think he might have if he hadn't been so desperate to get away from me.",
        "Roxy: Damn, this is so depressing. Blair, where are you? With all this unrequainted love going on, I think we need a good old torch song.",
        "Cristian: You know what? I get it. He wants to be accepted on the force.",
        "Kyle: There's more to it than that.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but I don't really care. It's Layla I'm worried about here. I mean, she doesn't deserve to be used and lied to.",
        "Roxy: Hey, easy, champ.",
        "Cristian: You know, I just had it out with Fish before coming over here. And I told him point-blank, if he doesn't tell Layla the truth tonight, I will.",
        "Roxy: Okay, I feel like you're a little angry. So what are you still doing here? Layla's going to need a serious friend tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Here you go, Officer.",
        "Oliver: Thank you. Oh, you smell good.",
        "Layla: You like it? It's lavender.",
        "Oliver: You know, I should probably take a shower.",
        "Layla: Actually, I was hoping that you'd keep the uniform on a little longer. It's kind of a turn-on.",
        "Oliver: Um--you know, next time. It was really hot today. I should--I should probably rinse off. Oh, hey, do you mind if we order in?",
        "Layla: You're hungry?",
        "Oliver: Well, I skipped lunch.",
        "Layla: Okay. We have some salad stuff. I can make some dressing. Oh, wait. Didn't you want to tell me something?",
        "Oliver: Did I?",
        "Layla: Yeah, you said we'd talk after work, and now it's after work. So, what's on your mind?",
        "Oliver: Um--you know, it can wait till after my shower.",
        "Layla: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: How long has this been going on?",
        "Jessica: It's nothing. Mom, it's nothing.",
        "Viki: No, it's not nothing. If you're being stalked, that is not nothing. We have to go get the police.",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. I'm fine. I made a mistake, and I'm really sorry, but it's nothing. I just--you know, can I just talk to Brody for a minute?",
        "Viki: Yes, okay. David--",
        "David: Hmm?",
        "Viki: Why don't you and your friends join me inside?",
        "Brody: What happened?",
        "Jessica: I--I heard a noise on the terrace, but I thought it was--",
        "Brody: Nash.",

        "[Song plays]",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "John: Why are you beating up my jukebox?",
        "Marty: Huh. Remember when I said I had my life back? I think I was wrong. Part of me seems to be back living in that house with Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Are you quite sure you're all right?",
        "David: Oh, don't worry, Viki. We probably won't sue you.",
        "Viki: Oh, really? To be frank, David, I wasn't terribly worried about that. And to show that there are no hard feelings, I will not have Mr. Ford arrested for trespassing.",
        "Ford: Thank you, Mrs. Davidson.",
        "Viki: Banks, Mrs. Banks.",
        "David: Oh, that's right. You married Charlie.",
        "Viki: Yes, I did.",
        "David: My goodness. I got the invitation. I thought the ceremony was next week, and I--I've had back to back Have-a-Seat promotional events.",
        "Viki: Ah. Well, I'll tell you what, you missed quite a wedding--a double wedding.",
        "David: Stop talking. Save those words. This is it. This is the magic. We have to get it on camera. Priscilla, audio, over here, foot of the couch. Ford, camera. Living room, downstage center. Viki--",
        "Viki: Hmm?",
        "David: You're in my light. All right. Okay. Uh--try to keep up with me. I'm very good at this. Are we rolling?",
        "Ford: Yep.",
        "David: Viki, you were just telling me about marrying Charlie.",
        "David: Okay, let's cut for a second. Um--Viki, that was--we call that your cue, okay? Now, you're going to start talking about the double wedding. Skip all the boring stuff. Just go straight to the stuff about who got drunk, who was sleeping with who--that sort of thing. We got to sell this puppy, okay? And if you listen to me, you just might get nominated for an Emmy. Are we rolling?",
        "Ford: Okay. Five, four, three--",
        "Viki: Turn it off, please.",
        "David: Well--what's wrong? Do you want better lighting?",
        "Viki: David--David, you are my dear friend. I'm extremely fond of you. There is no way that I would subject myself, or any of my family to this invasion of privacy.",
        "David: Well, now, hold on a second--",
        "Viki: David, no! No! Flat out no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Matthew asked Rachel to testify on his behalf. She refused. He asked me, and I said--",
        "Rachel: You believed in him, the implication being that I don't.",
        "Greg: I said I believe he could walk again.",
        "Rachel: As far as he's concerned, it's the same thing. For your information, I do believe in my brother. I believe that he has the ability to live a long and happy life exactly the way he is.",
        "Greg: You mean on your terms.",
        "Rachel: You think that I'm the control freak? You're the one who wants everyone to believe what you believe, and if they don't, they're narrow- minded, frightened little idiots.",
        "Greg: I never said that.",
        "Rachel: You don't have to. The condescension just pours off you. The great Dr. Evans who knows what's right for everyone else.",
        "Dr. Wright: I'd say she's got your number.",
        "Rachel: Excuse me; I need to use the ladies' room.",
        "Dr. Wright: How about I go see if I can salvage what's left of this evening?",
        "[Dr. Wright sighs]",
        "Shaun: Matthew is Rachel's brother, right?",
        "Greg: Ah, Rachel's fine.",
        "Shaun: Do me a favor, all right? Back off.",

        "Oliver: Yes. Why do I smell pizza?",
        "Layla: I found some leftover pizza. It'll be done in a minute.",
        "Oliver: Sorry, one-track mind.",
        "Layla: No worries. So, why don't you tell me what you were going to tell me?",
        "Cristian: Tell Layla, or I will.",
        "Oliver: Remember when Cristian told you that I was keeping secrets from you?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm. Kyle told him something happened when you were in college?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. I--I was involved with someone--pretty seriously involved.",
        "Layla: It's not a big deal. So was I in L.A.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but it was--it was complicated.",
        "Layla: Life's complicated. You were with other women, I've been with other men. Hopefully, you learn from it and work out all the kinks so you're ready when you meet someone special.",
        "Oliver: I don't know--I mean, I don't know how to say this.",
        "Layla: Hmm. Hey, we have both done things that we regret. But we're starting over. So why can't we just let the past be the past?",
        "Oliver: Huh. I wish it were that simple.",

        "Oliver: Hello? Mom, Dad, hi. No, it's okay. We were just about to have some dinner. Layla, the girl that I told you about. Yeah, hang on a second. They want to talk to you.",
        "Layla: Your parents? Why? I've never even met them.",
        "Oliver: I don't know. They feel like they know you.",

        "John: It's either \"Heart and Soul\" or \"Cat Scratch Fever.\"",
        "Marty: \"Heart and Soul\"--very funny. I know, it's stupid. It's stupid, it's just a song.",
        "John: Tell me.",
        "Marty: It was when Todd had me at his house. He got me a keyboard. I was restless, being in bed all the time, not doing anything, not remembering anything, and he knew that I used to play the piano. It was actually one of the first things I started to remember--playing. So, it kind of gave me a little hope, and I taught him a few--I mean, one song.",
        "John: \"Heart and Soul\"?",
        "Marty: Yeah, it was like our song. Isn't that lovely?",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: I'm sorry.",
        "John: For what?",
        "Marty: For bringing it up. You know, what he did to me, what I did to myself.",
        "John: Hey, you lost your memory.",
        "Marty: I know. Otherwise, none--it would never have--you know, the rational part of my brain really gets that, but it still really bothers me. And--part of me can't help but wonder...just how long you're going to wait before you give up on me.",
        "Marty: I mean, can you believe it? I fight to get my job back to practice psychiatry again and I can't even get past my own issues.",
        "John: Well, you know, it's going to take a little time.",
        "Marty: How much time?",
        "John: I don't know. What would you tell yourself?",
        "Marty: What, if I--if I were my own patient?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marty: I guess I would...say that any woman that had been raped physically and mentally by the same man might have some difficulties trusting people.",
        "John: You know what? I'm not giving up on you. As a matter of fact, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get rid of that damn song. I am going to ban that song from Rodi's forever.",
        "[Marty chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Viki, you're making a huge mistake. We're talking about television here, not the classic movie channel. Real television. Now, if the network likes our pilot, they will green light it. If they green light it, we go to series. This could be very big for you. And to tell you the truth, the camera loves you.",
        "Ford: It really does.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, it is your dream to be famous, not mine.",
        "David: No, not true. I need you, Viki. Those Have-a-Seat commercials--they gave me my start, but I need to break out now. I need to make a name for myself.",
        "Viki: You don't need me for that.",
        "David: No, but I do! I--I told my producer that I'd find a great big house and wonderful, colorful characters to fill out our show.",
        "Ford: You know, he did promise.",
        "Viki: Uh-huh. And you came to me?",
        "David: Who else would I go to?",
        "Viki: Dorian.",
        "David: Old habits die hard. But Dorian and I have parted ways.",
        "Viki: David, she turned you down.",
        "David: That's when I had my epiphany. I mean, think about it. La Boulaie's got nothing on Llanfair.",
        "Ford: Wait. So a mother and a daughter with multiple personalities? If we can get one of those--",
        "[Ford snaps fingers]",
        "Ford: What did you call them? Alters? If we can get one of those on tape, then we'd be set.",
        "Viki: I think it is time for all of you to leave.",
        "David: Why, what's wrong? Your alters are more interesting than you.",
        "Viki: I beg your pardon?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So I told Marty everything. I told her about the night at the lodge. I told her about finding Bree with that stuffed elephant that she says that her daddy gave her, I told her about the heart on the window--no, I didn't tell her about the heart on the window.",
        "Brody: Wait a second. What heart on the window?",
        "Jessica: The glass door on the terrace. I saw a heart, but then the other day when I saw him out here--",
        "Brody: Nash, you mean?",
        "Jessica: Yes. No--I don't know. I don't know if it's Nash. I mean, his face is always obscured by the bushes or shadows. I mean--maybe I'm not seeing anything at all. You know, maybe I really am losing my mind.",
        "Brody: Is that what Marty said?",
        "Jessica: No. Well, she's a shrink. She's not going to give me any answers.",
        "Brody: Yeah. My favorite part of therapy. Spilling your guts to a total stranger so they can tell you you're the one that has to figure everything out. But we're going to figure this out, Jessica, I promise you.",
        "Jessica: Brody?",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: If I ask you something, can you be brutally honest with me?",
        "Brody: Shoot.",
        "Jessica: Do you really think that someone's stalking me, or is it all in my head?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Wright: Hey, you okay?",
        "Rachel: Oh, I just needed a breather. I'm sorry if I spoiled your evening.",
        "Dr. Wright: You? I'm the one that stuck my foot in my mouth by bringing up your brother's surgery. Some people should teach you that religion and politics aren't the only thing you shouldn't bring up at dinner.",
        "Rachel: It's not your fault. I think Greg and I would be at each other's throats discussing the weather.",
        "Dr. Wright: I got to say, though, you give it as good as you get it.",
        "Rachel: Maybe. But then again, I'm not one of those women who thinks arrogance is attractive.",
        "Dr. Wright: And you think I am?",
        "Rachel: That is not what I meant.",
        "Dr. Wright: No, it's okay. I'm attracted to confidence, and Greg has that in spades. You know, he knows what he wants. And I think he wants you. Oh, come on. Isn't that what all that sparring is? Foreplay?",
        "Rachel: No. I can't stand Greg, and I think the feeling is mutual.",
        "Dr. Wright: Hmm.",
        "Rachel: No offense, but your boyfriend's an egomaniacal jerk.",
        "Dr. Wright: He's also one of the most exciting men I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. And by the way, he's not my boyfriend. Our relationship is purely casual, so if you're interested in him, I won't stand in your way.",
        "Rachel: I am dating Shaun.",
        "Dr. Wright: Uh-huh. From where I'm sitting, it's pretty obvious that you're into Greg. All I'm saying is, if you just want to--",
        "Rachel: You are way off base, okay? There's nothing going on between Greg and me.",
        "Dr. Wright: My mistake.",
        "Rachel: Maybe next time you should check yourself before insinuating something that isn't true.",
        "Dr. Wright: I'm sorry if I offended you. I'll see you back at the table.",
        "[Rachel sighs]",

        "Cristian: Layla knows where to find me. If she needs me, she'll call.",
        "Roxy: Looks like Fish ain't the only one swimming in that river in Egypt.",
        "Kyle: What?",
        "Roxy: Denial.",
        "Kyle: I told him the same thing. Maybe they should get together.",
        "Roxy: Okay, we're going to look on the brighter side. Fish is going to tell Layla, and Layla's going to hook up with Cristian. And then you and Oliver can be best buds again.",
        "Kyle: No. I'm--I'm done with Oliver. I can't be with somebody who's too afraid to be who he really is.",
        "Roxy: You know, it's so weird, because he puts his life on the line every time he puts on that manly uniform. And maybe he's not giving the Llanview P.D. credit for being--what's that word? Progresso about stuff. 'Cause once he gets out of the closet, it's just going to feel so good.",
        "Kyle: No, that's never going to happen. Oliver's whole family is just ultra conservative.",
        "Roxy: Well, what's the big deal? Your kid's your kid.",
        "Kyle: Huh. Yeah, you try telling that to Mr. and Mrs. Fish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Your son is a wonderful man, Mr. and Mrs. Fish. Yes, he's treating me right. You raised him well. Okay. I will. I promise. Okay, nice talking to you, too. Okay, bye.",
        "Oliver: Hi. Yes, I told you she was special. Really? That would be great. Just let me know, okay? Okay, bye. Whew.",
        "Layla: What's wrong? They didn't like me?",
        "Oliver: Uh--no, they love you. They love you so much, they want to come for a visit.",
        "Layla: Is that a problem?",
        "Oliver: No, no, it's cool. It's just--",
        "Layla: Are they high maintenance?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, sort of.",
        "Layla: They were so sweet on the phone. I thought you told me your dad was scary.",
        "Oliver: Well, you know how it seems when you're a kid.",
        "Layla: Strict?",
        "Oliver: Super strict.",
        "Layla: Mine were, too. But that's only because they had high hopes for Vange and me. They didn't want us to screw up. I'm sure your parents are really proud of you now.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, they are. They are.",
        "Layla: Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Oliver: I know it will.",
        "Layla: So? What did you want to tell me?",

        "Layla: Are you sure?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Let's just enjoy the night together before Cris comes home.",
        "Layla: If you're worried about being interrupted, we can go to my room.",
        "Oliver: Um--your room?",
        "Layla: No pressure. We've both had a long day.",
        "Oliver: I'm not pressured. I'm just blown away that I lucked into a girlfriend as great as you.",

        "Viki: Are you out of your mind? Have you completely forgotten what Jessie's just been through, and Natalie and Jared have been through?",
        "David: Ooh, no, of course not.",
        "Ford: The long lost twin from the wrong side of the tracks, and the guy that pretends to be her uncle.",
        "Viki: And besides, Charlie and I just got married.",
        "Ford: Yeah, the recovering alcoholic who builds an exact replica of the diner where they first laid eyes on each other.",
        "David: Okay, you can probably stop now.",
        "Viki: David, I've spent more than enough of my life in the public eye. I do not need cameras in my home.",
        "David: You're not even going to see the cameras--except maybe in the confessional room. We should probably have a confessional room, right?",
        "Viki: I wish you all the luck in the world. You are not filming here at Llanfair.",
        "David: All right. Um--folks, I guess we have to find another mansion and a few other zany characters to flesh out our show. But if you don't mind, would you just throw me out one more time on camera? We could probably use it for \"b\" roll.",
