        "Todd comes through the window to Starr's room in an attempt to get her to understand that he wants what is best for her and wants his family back. She is still angry at him but doesn't let Blair know he came by. Blair is seeing John. Bo and Rex are still stuck in 1968 and dependent on the professor to get them back to the present. It looks like Bo has gone back and has been able to get in touch with Matthew. But Rex cannot get back. Gigi is also trying unsuccessfully to find Rex and dependent upon Madam Delphina until she gets struck by lightning and then wakes up in 1968 and she goes to enter the old Buchanan ranch."

        "Starr: How did this --",
        "[Starr gasps]",
        "Todd: Shh. Don't scream.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I never do this. It's -- it's so not me.",
        "John: What's not you?",
        "Blair: That was Dorian on the phone. I mean, she called you and then handed me the phone.",
        "John: Why would she do that?",
        "Blair: Is this, uh, a bad time? You know what, we can -- we can talk tomorrow or -- or something, you know.",
        "John: What, you don't want to talk to me?",
        "Blair: No, I -- that's not what I'm saying at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pres. Nixon: I have the highest honor of accepting your nomination as president --",
        "Gigi: [As Emma] I would definitely not buy a used car from that man.",
        "Dallas: [As Renee] Ugh, I don't know what's scarier -- I mean, the G.O.P. nominating tricky Dick for president or those California folks voting for some B-movie actor as governor.",
        "Chuck: Be quiet, would you? Some of us are trying to listen to this.",
        "Emma: Hmm. You like what he has to say now, but just wait till he's elected.",
        "Renee: Yeah.",
        "Chuck: What has gotten into you girls? This man is going to change this country around.",
        "Renee: Oh, yeah, right. With his secret plan to end the war?",
        "Emma: Campaign gimmick, that's all it is.",
        "Chuck: Mm-hmm, well, be as cynical as you like, ladies, but mark my words. That man is going to end this war real soon.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Renee: What was that?",
        "Chuck: Oh, great.",
        "Emma: Real soon is not soon enough for some guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: All right, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. After we get struck by lightning, what?",
        "Bo: We end up back in 2008. Is that right?",
        "Delphina: [As Prof. Fina] Well, that's, ah -- yeah, you could say -- well, that's the theory.",
        "Rex: \"Theory\"?!",
        "Bo: It will be okay, Balsom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Hang in there, Balsom. I'm on my way.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Delphina: Don't let go!",

        "Matthew: Yes, yes. Bite the curb. Bite it. Yes, kiss the floor. Done. Adios, buddy.",
        "Cole: You so lucked out one.",
        "Matthew: Hey, you want to play again?",
        "Cole: Double or nothing.",
        "Matthew: I don't think you can handle two weeks of my chores.",
        "Cole: Fine. Fine, be that way. Whatever.",
        "Matthew: It's up to you.",
        "Cole: Listen, the truth is, I let you win.",
        "Matthew: Oh, yeah, that's why you were sweating and cursing the whole game, right?",
        "Cole: I was just trying to be nice to the little incoming freshman. But let me tell you something -- once school starts, the honeymoon's over.",
        "Matthew: Oh, I'm so scared.",
        "Cole: Nothing but nonstop swirlies from day one.",
        "Matthew: Swirlies? They don't really do that. Do they?",
        "Cole: You'll find out.",
        "Matthew: Well, hey, I'm friends with Starr. No one crosses her.",
        "Cole: Good point. Let's, uh, let's do another round. Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Oh, my God. Shaun!",
        "Todd: No, no, wait. Please --",
        "Starr: Shaun! Shaun!",
        "Todd: No. No, no. Starr -- no, shh, shh -- no, don't yell. Don't yell. Right here. See?",
        "[Todd Chuckles]",
        "Todd: Nothing to worry about. Ah. Yeah, I'm not going to hurt you. Not going to even kidnap you.",
        "Starr: Then what are you doing here, Dad? You trying to scare me into losing my baby?",
        "Todd: No, I hate sneaking up on you like that. But, uh, I figured it was the only way I could see you. That's really all I want to do. I just want to see you. I miss you so much. How are you? How's Jack and Sam?",
        "Starr: Hmm, they're just fine.",
        "Todd: And how are you?",
        "Starr: I'm doing fine, too.",
        "Todd: Yeah? I didn't mean to startle you like that. I just -- I know you don't want to see me. I got to tell you, though, not a minute goes by in my day I'm not thinking about you. Oh, here.",
        "Starr: What is that?",
        "Todd: Don't you recognize the craftsmanship? I had Senorita Lena --",
        "[Todd laughs]",
        "Todd: Yeah, she made that for you. It's custom-made.",
        "Starr: It's a voodoo doll?",
        "Todd: Yeah, of Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: And here I thought those days were over.",
        "John: What's that?",
        "Blair: Oh, apologizing for other people. It feels like I spent half my life doing that for Todd, and now that he's out of the picture, well, Dorian steps in.",
        "John: Don't apologize. I like hearing your voice.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "John: Really.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what, I'm still -- you know. It just bugs me that Dorian feels like she has to take matters into her own hands.",
        "John: What's that got to do with her dialing my number for you?",
        "Blair: Well, I just guess I'm not moving fast enough for her.",
        "John: So she knows?",
        "Blair: Uh, look, John, there are -- you know, there are secrets in the Cramer family that have a shelf life longer than, like, a couple of weeks, but they're usually life-or-death.",
        "John: As opposed to?",
        "Blair: Well, \"the hooking up with a guy\" kind of secret. Those are sniffed out just like that, you know.",
        "John: Is that what we're doing? Hooking up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: Oh, whoa! Oh, God. Oh, God. Gi-- Gigi? Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: [As Prof. Fina] Mr. Buchanan? Uh, Mr., uh, Mr. Balsom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: Look at this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Prof. Fina: Ha ha ha! We've done it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Prof. Fina: Yes. Ah. It was a race against time, but we --",
        "[Prof. Fina sings, laughs, hacks]",
        "Prof. Fina: Or maybe not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: [As Emma] Someone get the candles.",
        "Dallas: [As Renee] How are we going to find 'em?",
        "Emma: I can't see a blessed thing. Just what we need with everyone drunk.",
        "Chuck: All right, everybody, just calm down. Candles are, uh, right up here.",
        "Emma: Thank heavens.",
        "Chuck: Yeah.",
        "Emma: Well, candles, matches. We got everything we need here at the Buchanan ranch.",
        "Moe: [As Jeremiah] Except a vengeful God. See what happens when Nixon gets the nomination?",
        "Renee: The whole place is going to go to the dogs.",
        "Jeremiah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Chuck: All right, now, would you two please just cut it out?",
        "Jeremiah: Imagine what's going to happen if he gets to the White House?",
        "Renee: Oh, imagine that.",
        "Jared: [As Clint] Well, what the hell?",
        "Shane: [As Spencer] Sorry, didn't see you there.",
        "Emma: Oh, my God, Clint. I am so sorry for my son's very bad behavior.",
        "Spencer: It was an accident, Ma.",
        "Emma: Well, you better learn to be more careful, Spencer Truman, or you are going to be grounded for life.",
        "Spencer: You do that to me, and I'll stop listening to all your troubles.",
        "Clint: Well -- kid's a real piece of work, isn't he?",
        "Emma: Well, he's right. I do talk to him too much about my troubles. But he's got that little mean streak. But all his teachers love him 'cause he's so smart, but none of the other kids like him.",
        "Clint: Oh, he's going to be okay. He's just a kid. You know, storm's probably got him all freaked out.",
        "Emma: Well, hey, let me go find you a towel.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Emma: Are you wondering where your brother is?",
        "Clint: Ah, he's off with Pa somewhere.",
        "Emma: Well, I'm sure he's fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: [As Prof. Fina] Rex?",
        "[Prof. Fina clears his throat]",
        "Prof. Fina: R-- Rex? Rex, can you hear me?",
        "Rex: Gigi --",
        "Prof. Fina: Ah. Well, snap out of it.",
        "Rex: What -- what are you doing here?",
        "Prof. Fina: Me, I -- I'm pretty sure I live here.",
        "Rex: 40 years ago you did, but not here, not in 2008.",
        "Prof. Fina: Oh, well, I think you're confused.",
        "Rex: Don't argue with me. Okay, you need to get back before you change history. Maybe you already have.",
        "Prof. Fina: Oh, now, you know, that's true, but in this particular case, what I'm trying to say is --",
        "Rex: How -- how do you know? The Russians could be taking over as we speak. Okay, this is, like, 20 episodes of \"Star Trek.\"",
        "Prof. Fina: Oh, is that show still on? I love that show.",
        "Rex: Whatever you did to get here, you need to undo it, okay? It could be a catastrophe. Bo will tell you the same thing.",
        "Prof. Fina: Ah, well, you see, Bo -- Bo's gone.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Prof. Fina: You never actually, uh, left. It's still 1968.",
        "Rex: No. No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: How long am I supposed to wait? To hell with that. I'm going in. No, no, I can't be expected to know everything. What -- oh, my -- you think that's funny? You could have told me about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, you must be exhausted. I should probably let you get some sleep.",
        "John: Overrated, sleep.",
        "Blair: You probably have some work to do, though, right?",
        "John: What, are you giving me the bum rush now?",
        "Blair: No. No, I'm not. I just -- you know, at this time of night, most people are either sleeping or working.",
        "John: Are you sleeping or working?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "John: So what are you doing?",
        "Blair: Nothing. You?",
        "John: Nothing. Want to do nothing together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You come all the way here, you climb a tree, you sneak into my window, you risk getting in trouble by breaking a restraining order, all to give me a voodoo doll of my boy-- of Cole?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Starr: I really -- I don't get you.",
        "Todd: I heard Cole broke up with you.",
        "Starr: So what? You thought that I could use this to get even?",
        "Todd: Right.",
        "Starr: You're unbelievable.",
        "Todd: I just wanted to do something nice for you, you know. Maybe see a smile. Give me a smile.",
        "Starr: Don't do this to me, Dad, please.",
        "Todd: It's killing me that I can't be here for you right now when you're going through this thing with Cole, and it makes me so angry at him. He doesn't appreciate how amazing you are.",
        "Starr: Since when have you ever appreciated me? You hate Cole. You tried to kill him.",
        "Todd: I regret that. I'd take it back if I could.",
        "Starr: You're playing me, aren't you?",
        "Todd: No, I'm telling you the truth.",
        "Starr: No, you're playing me. How can you stand there and say that you want to take it all back, that you're sorry that Cole broke up with me? This is exactly what you wanted. You got your way. You should be happy.",
        "Todd: Do I look happy?",
        "Starr: No. What's wrong? Did you getting everything you've ever wanted cost you everyone and everything you've ever cared about?",
        "Todd: Don't do this to me.",
        "Starr: You're the victim now?",
        "Todd: You know, you and your brothers are my world, and I will do anything to fix things with you guys.",
        "Starr: Anything?",
        "Todd: Yes. Try me.",
        "Starr: What if it meant being okay with Cole and me being together?",
        "Todd: Yeah, if it meant getting my kids back, that's fine.",
        "Starr: Okay. And would you tell Cole that you thought it was good idea if Mrs. McBain should adopt our baby? See, that's exactly what I thought. You hate Cole, but you would be okay with the idea of us being together because you hate Mrs. McBain even more.",
        "Todd: You're so wrong.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry, because now that Cole's out of the picture, you lost your little ally against Marcie and me.",
        "Todd: I do despise Marcie McBain, and I don't want her to raise your child, but not because I'm out for revenge.",
        "Starr: Oh, no. No, of course not because that just wouldn't be you, right?",
        "Todd: God, you're starting to sound exactly like your mother.",
        "Starr: Good. I'm glad. Because I wouldn't have been able to get through these past few months without her. But the reason why I'm pregnant is because of you, because you made Cole and I believe that we were never going to see each other again.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, I think it's time you looked at this from my point of view!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Are you inviting me over?",
        "John: Unless you're busy.",
        "Blair: No, I'm not doing anything.",
        "John: So I'm inviting you over.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "John: Then it's a date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I get your point of view. The whole world revolves around you. It's all about what you feel, right? And what's good for you? We're all just extras in your little movie. How am I doing, Dad?",
        "Todd: You've got a pretty smart mouth on you.",
        "Starr: I'm 16, knocked up, and I've had great role models growing up.",
        "Todd: Oh, you -- come on, you're going to be a dynamite adult. You're just going to be dynamite. And I want to watch it happen. I want to be there with you as you grow up, so I need to win back your respect, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes, however long it takes.",
        "Starr: Okay, then -- then don't make me feel guilty for making my own decisions, because I'm taking responsibility for what I've done, and I think that you should do the same.",
        "Todd: Okay, deal. Now, hey, I just -- I want -- I want you, Jack, and Sam and that little baby and me together, because, you know, we're all Mannings. And that baby inside of you is part of me, you know. And everything I've done is to try to protect him or her. And protect you, of course.",
        "Starr: How can you call what you've done in the past protection?",
        "Todd: Because I know something you don't know.",
        "Starr: And what does that mean?",
        "Todd: Because I know what it's like to give up a kid. I -- I gave up Sam before he was even born. And I pay for it every day that I missed with him, and the last I want is for you to wake up years from now and say the same thing to yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Hey, Cole. I'm really sorry, man.",
        "Cole: For what?",
        "Matthew: For talking about Starr before. I mean, sometimes I really put my foot in it. My mom says I get it from her.",
        "Cole: Hey, it's okay.",
        "Matthew: I mean, I was just thinking about her, and it just came out.",
        "Cole: Well, I guess I'm going to have to get used to it. There's going to be tons worse when I go back to school, and everyone's talking about it.",
        "Matthew: So why did you -- never mind.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Matthew: No, it's none of my business.",
        "Cole: You want to know why Starr and I broke up, right?",
        "Matthew: It's because of the baby, right? And I thought you both wanted to have it.",
        "Cole: Well, I thought we both felt the same way. But we didn't. And I kind of made it hard for Starr to tell me that she didn't want what I wanted.",
        "Matthew: You think you two will ever get back together?",
        "Cole: I don't see how. I mean, although I think about it nonstop, and I miss her like I miss my parents -- I just can't help it.",
        "Matthew: I know what you mean. I have no idea where my dad is. He's never gone this long without calling me before. I miss him, too. I can't help it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: Bo. Hey. Can you hear me?",
        "Bo: Delphina?",
        "Delphina: Yeah, that's right. It's Delphina. And you're Bo, aren't you?",
        "Bo: Do I look like Bo? Or like Asa?",
        "Delphina: Asa? Buchanan?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Delphina: Asa Buchanan's dead, Bo. Remember? Come on. Let's get you up. That's all right. You look like you had a pretty rough ride there, huh, cowboy?",
        "Bo: What happened to me?",
        "Delphina: What's the last thing you remember?",
        "Bo: I was at the fence.",
        "Delphina: Go on.",
        "Bo: Well -- Balsom was here. He was arguing with me. And there was a storm. And then I touched this gate, and there was a flash. Here I am.",
        "Delphina: Oh. It worked.",
        "Bo: What worked?",
        "Delphina: Where's Rex? And Gigi?",
        "Bo: What are you talking about? Where -- where is Balsom?",
        "Delphina: Huh? He's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Damn it, don't you see me? I'm right here! Hit me! Take me! Take me back!",
        "Delphina: [As Prof. Fina] Oh, uh, sorry about that.",
        "Rex: I got to get back. Don't you get it?",
        "Prof. Fina: Oh, well, of course I get it. I -- it's just that you can't -- you can't go back that way. You need a conduit.",
        "Rex: Cell phone. My cell phone. Conduit. That's the -- I got to find the phone, then I get back to my life, my real life with Gigi --",
        "Prof. Fina: Uh, I don't know how to tell you this. Well -- well, yes, I do. Cell phone is in the future. With Bo. You threw it to him. He caught it. It's not like I can -- huh! -- Build another one.",
        "[Prof. Fina Chuckles]",
        "Rex: Okay, but that means --",
        "Prof. Fina: Well, that means that -- well. Well, let's just go inside. We'll get you dried up, talk about your options. Huh! Yes.",
        "Rex: What options? My option -- other than to live Bo Buchanan's life without Gigi?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What are you talking about? Where is Balsom? Is he okay?",
        "Delphina: Well, that's difficult to say.",
        "Bo: Well, what does that mean? What, is he at a hospital?",
        "Delphina: I honestly don't know.",
        "Bo: Well, you're a psychic, aren't you? Aren't you supposed to know everything?",
        "Delphina: Well, I know you're wearing blue boxers, but about Rex, I don't know. I can't say. I know he's not here.",
        "Bo: Well, what in God's -- what -- what does that mean? What are you doing here?",
        "Delphina: Gigi Morasco hired me to come and save you and Rex from 1968. You know, 1968? L.B.J., Nixon, peace and love, sock it to me.",
        "Bo: No, I know -- I know everything that happened in 1968, but what does that -- what does that have to do with where Balsom is right now?",
        "Delphina: You see, somehow, you and Rex went through a portal of twin paradoxes in a perfect universe, which took you through a time warp back to 1968. And if it wasn't for Gigi and I, you'd still be stuck there.",
        "Bo: Are you feeling okay?",
        "Delphina: Am I feeling okay? This from a guy who just traveled 40 years? Look, are you honestly telling me that you have no memory of the last 3 1/2 weeks? Because that is how long you have been trapped in the past.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: [As Prof. Fina] I'm not really sure what our next move should be. I mean, I didn't really expect that you -- I mean, I didn't think that -- well, you let go of the conduit. Maybe we could get a team together. Yes, we can go to the fence and take some measurements and find evidence of the portal.",
        "Rex: Yeah, sure, whatever you -- whatever you say. Just tell me one thing; what the hell am I supposed to do?",
        "Prof. Fina: What you -- what, you're coming with me. I mean, you've just traveled through, what, 40 years through time. One can only imagine the sort of cosmic rays you might be exposed to.",
        "Rex: Right, one can only imagine.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "Prof. Fina: No, no, no, no. See, you must be studied.",

Forget about everything and everyone that makes me Rex Balsom? Well, I don't know how to do that and I won't!",

        "Todd: I tell you, you just don't know what it's like when they hand you that new baby and you're holding it in your arms. You never want to let it go, and you will regret every day of your life if you do let it go.",
        "Starr: You are so sure of how I'm going to feel, but you've been wrong about me for a long time now.",
        "Todd: No, on this, I'm dead on. I really am. Because if you give up this kid, you're always going to wonder. You're going to think to yourself, \"How's she doing? Is she sitting up yet? Has she got her first tooth? Is he okay? Is he getting enough to eat? Is he being loved enough?\" And I'm telling you, it -- it keeps you up at nights.",

        "Starr: How can I feel for you? What you're doing to me is completely unfair.",
        "Todd: You may think that now.",
        "Starr: Oh, no, I know it is. You standing here telling me what family means to you, then not listening to me when I tell you what it means to me, that's unfair. And you putting me in a position to lie to my own mother --",

        "Delphina: Look, I've been trying to tell you, that's not going to happen, at least not through any action of ours. The portal's, yeah, it's definitely closed. I can sense it.",
