        "Viki: Yes. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Natalie: Well, you lost $10 million last night, Mom.",
        "Viki: No, I -- I did not lose $10 million. I donated it, to a very worthy cause, at your event.",
        "Natalie: Because Dorian goaded you into it.",
        "[Viki sighs]",
        "Jessica: Mom, I am sorry. I had absolutely nothing to do with this morning's headline.",
        "Viki: What headline?",
        "Jessica: You mean you didn't see \"The Sun\"?",
        "Viki: No.",

        "Blair: Let me see it.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Blair: Oh, I can't believe Todd would do that.",
        "Dorian: After all the things that Todd has done, you -- you don't believe that he has done this?",
        "Blair: But that's his sister, he loves her.",
        "Dorian: Oh, oh, I could kiss him for this. Ah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Hey, morning, Bo.",
        "Bo: Good ride?",
        "Clint: Oh, it was a great ride. I'm back in the habit of riding in the morning before work. Pa said it always cleared his head, which it does. You should try it. Can you believe he still has that old hat after all these years?",
        "Bo: Pa's the reason I'm here, Clint. Look, I can't avoid this any longer. I'm going to have to arrest him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: Good morning, everyone.",
        "Nora: Hey -- look at you, all ready to go.",
        "Renee: Oh, good luck getting Asa up this morning. I didn't want to disturb him. He didn't even move when I got up.",
        "Nigel: I'm equal to the challenge.",
        "Nora: Nigel is equipped with a cattle prod for the really big bulls.",

        "Matthew: Do you want me to go in for some backup?",
        "Nigel: Too risky. If I'm not back in 10 minutes, call 911.",
        "[Nora laughs]",
        "Renee: Oh, it's so wonderful to have the two of you here. If Asa had his way, you would never leave.",

        "Natalie: I can't believe Todd did this.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I told you what he's like when he feels betrayed. He's just trying to get back at me.",

        "Langston: Well, that's harsh.",
        "Starr: Yeah, no kidding. Did dad do this?",
        "Dorian: Yes. Isn't it wonderful?",
        "Starr: No, it is not wonderful. If it wasn't for Aunt Viki, Cole and I would've never gotten back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Hey, you want to go fishing with me later? My Grandpa said we can use some gear. My Dad has never even touched his gear.",
        "Cole: Yeah, sure. Sounds like fun. Let's go for it.",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "Renee: Did you get the old bear out of bed?",
        "Nora: It's not like Asa to sleep this long, is it?",
        "Nigel: No, it's not like him at all.",
        "Renee: Nigel, what is it?",
        "Nigel: Mr. Buchanan is --",

        "Clint: I thought we agreed to look the other way about what Pa did.",
        "Bo: What he did was order a hit on Spencer Truman.",
        "Clint: Which never came to fruition.",
        "Bo: That doesn't matter, Clint. Come on! How am I supposed to call myself the commissioner of police when I give him a pass?",
        "Clint: I'm as upset with pa as you are.",
        "Bo: Ah -- you know what? You don't seem to be having too tough a time with all of this.",
        "Clint: Well, I thought it was settled. I mean, what are you doing? What good is it going to do to dwell on this?",
        "Bo: How can you not dwell on it? It's not right, ok? He arranged to have Truman murdered. He intended for that to happen. Marty Saybrooke is sitting in jail right now for that crime.",
        "Clint: One big difference.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Clint: She actually killed the guy.",
        "Bo: Oh -- so what do I say to her kid, huh? \"The law applies to your mom, but not to my dad\" -- no, come on. It's not right!",
        "Clint: All right, let's talk about what's right.",
        "Bo: Ah.",
        "Clint: What do you think you're doing, huh? At Pa's age, with his health as bad as it is, he wouldn't last a day in prison -- you know it.",
        "Bo: Hey, Nora. What? What is it -- something wrong?",
        "Nora: Something's happened.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: It's your Pa.",
        "Nora: He -- his heart stopped. He died in his sleep, so he didn't suffer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I can't believe that was my Grandpa's body. He looked so -- little.",
        "Nigel: His spirit was what made him big.",

        "Dorian: I also helped Starr. Viki isn't the only one that uses her power for good. Someday I'll tell you the whole story, over pedicures.",
        "Langston: Am I missing something?",
        "Starr: I told you that my Aunt Dorian and Aunt Viki are mortal enemies, right?",
        "Langston: Right. Um -- ok. Well, I'm going to go. Thank you.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Blair: You can't leave -- wait -- no, there's breakfast here, come on. You need to have something to eat.",
        "Langston: No, I -- I really should go, but thank you.",
        "Dorian: At least take a croissant for the road.",
        "Langston: Thanks, Dr. Lord. I'll give this back to you tomorrow, ok, Starr?",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah, don't worry about it. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Langston: Bye, sweetie.",
        "Dorian: I'm worried about that girl. Do you get the feeling she's neglected?",

        "Starr: Hey.",
        "Cole: Good morning.",
        "Blair: Good morning.",
        "Starr: Ooh.",

        "Starr: It's ok.",
        "Cole: Asa just died. He had a heart attack in his sleep.",
        "Starr: Oh, my God.",
        "Dorian: Poor Clint. I better get dressed and go to him. I'll have the car and driver take me. Blair? Why are you so upset? I thought you loathed Asa.",

        "Viki: Oh, Clint, good morning. What can I do for you? Oh, no, the -- the girls are actually both here with me. Yes, I'll call Kevin and Joey right away. Oh, Clint, I'm so, so sorry. If there's anything I can do, please call.",
        "Jessica: What happened?",

        "Clint: No.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, well, I didn't come here to see you anyway. I want to talk to Asa.",
        "Clint: You can't.",
        "Sarah: You can't keep me away from him.",
        "Clint: Sarah, you don't understand.",
        "Sarah: Oh, I totally understand. You're afraid that Asa's going to give me my money back and you won't be able to hold me hostage in dullsville, P-A, anymore.",
        "Clint: Asa's died.",
        "Sarah: What?",

        "Bo: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Rex: Really?",
        "Bo: Really. My father lived a long and very prosperous life, I -- he died in his sleep, very peacefully so -- I'm fine.",
        "Rex: Ok. How's Matthew?",
        "Bo: This is really tough on Matthew because he worshipped his grandfather.",
        "Rex: Sure. The guy was a legend.",
        "Bo: Yeah. He was bigger than life. Thank you.",
        "Waitress: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: I never knew my father. He was nothing like Asa, obviously. Actually, Roxy said he was pretty despicable. But, still, I wish I'd known him.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Asa Buchanan was no saint. You know something, Balsom? I was right on the verge of having to arrest him on a felony charge, right before he died.",
        "Rex: That must've been hard.",
        "Bo: No, that was life with Asa.",

        "Dorian: Honey, what's wrong? You have been moping since yesterday.",
        "Blair: I'm not moping -- I'm reading. Did you know that Asa bought his first oil well at 22?",
        "Dorian: I'm only reading my favorite paper these days -- \"The Sun.\" I can't say this to Clint, but I'll tell you, I cannot wait to see what fitting tribute Todd has thought up for Asa. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa's voice: You have no idea how great it feels to be home, to see your beautiful face and your sister's.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. Just when I thought I understood Todd, he goes and does something like this. I thought he was going to go for the jugular.",
        "Jessica: I think he did it for me.",
        "Natalie: Well, he didn't do it for me -- that's for sure. He hates my guts.",

        "Nigel: If you have any flaws, I've yet to encounter them, ma'am.",
        "Renee: You are such a sweet man, Nigel Smythe. Asa was so lucky to have you.",

        "Clint: I know, but it was Dorian's fault.",
        "Viki: Fine -- let her kick in half.",
        "Clint: Can you really spare 10 million?",
