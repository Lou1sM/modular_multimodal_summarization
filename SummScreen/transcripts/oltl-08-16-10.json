        "John manages to get Hannah to admit that she lied about pushing Marty and trying to kill Ford. Eli did it and threatened her and threatened Cole if she did not confess that she did it and keep his secret. Meanwhile, David manages to get Clint to confess on tape that Dorian got him to help her pretend that he is in love with her in exchange for Dorian giving him a stadium. Dorian gets Mandy to admit on tape that she and David scammed their engagement to make Dorian jealous when Dorian offers Mandy her diamonds. Both Dorian and David have the goods on each other. Natalie admits to her parents that she is pregnant along with Jessica although she and Brody are both aware that it's possible he's the father and have no way of knowing nor a clue what to do. Jessica goes to find out from Robert Ford that they did, in fact have sex. And that means it's possible that he could be the father of her baby. Tea gets Shaun and Greg to help her get settled in the hospice care facility. Shaun manages to prevent Todd's men from finding her. Yet she has her doubts about whether she should die without Todd and Dani there and they are determined not to give up on finding her. Blair is beginning to suspect Eli but wants him to believe that she trusts him and defends him to Kelly and John."

        "Todd: But this will do for you and me, right?",

        "Shaun: You wanted to lose Mr. Manning's tail.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did we? Are you sure Todd can't track me down?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I can't decide.",

        "Eli: Oh, just wanted to make sure you were here. You want a drink?",

        "John: Oh, Hannah, I don't think you tried to kill yourself.",
        "Hannah: I O.D.'d.",
        "John: I talked to the doctor. He told me when you took the pills.",
        "Hannah: After rounds.",
        "John: And visiting hours. Did you have a visitor?",
        "Hannah: I don't remember much of the day.",
        "John: Do you know how close you came to dying?",
        "Hannah: Not close enough.",
        "John: So now you're talking like you have to die and you don't. I can help you, if you let me.",

        "Natalie: Hmm. Looks like Jessica's making plans for your baby.",
        "Brody: Are you making plans for our baby?",
        "Natalie: Don't. This is John's baby and that is the only way to look at it.",
        "Brody: What if it's mine?",
        "Viki: Natalie? Finally!",
        "Natalie: Hi, Mom!",
        "Viki: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Natalie: How was your trip?",
        "Viki: Oh, it was perfect, sweetheart. Just the two of us, and far away from all that David and Dorian foolishness.",
        "Natalie: That sounds great.",
        "Viki: It was. What are you up to? Oh, you are bonding over the baby.",
        "Natalie: Heh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: We had sex, didn't we?",
        "Ford: Again?",
        "Jessica: And I'm going to keep on asking you until you tell me.",
        "Ford: I told you over and over--",
        "Jessica: You got tested for Hepatitis C. A nurse told me.",
        "Ford: Wait, somebody at the hospital gave you my personal information?",
        "Jessica: No. You just did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Dorian: Got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mandy? Do come in.",
        "Mandy: Did you call me about David? Because you can't have him back. He's deeply in love with me.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please. I know that David is paying you to work me. I also know the two of you are not in love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Cards on the table--I want you to admit it. You and Dorian aren't really in love.",
        "Clint: Why would I do that?",
        "David: Well, I'll let you know what happened to your stripper/assistant/ex- real housewife of Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: You sent someone after Mom?",
        "Todd: Hell, yeah. So where is she?",
        "Man: I lost them.",
        "Todd: Them? What do you mean? She's got someone helping her? Who?",
        "Man: I don't know. They must be real pros.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: I lost that chump in 3 moves.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd hired a chump?",

        "T\u00e9a: But you're better.",
        "Shaun: I wouldn't let you down, Ms. Manning, but you just ran from your daughter and your husband.",
        "Greg: T\u00e9a made a hard choice, but thanks for helping out.",
        "Shaun: Ms. Manning, it's none of my business, but if I were going to meet my maker, I'd want Destiny, Vivian, my family--I'd want all of them right next to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: How did you find out I got tested?",
        "Jessica: You just told me.",
        "Ford: Well, you knew to ask, so I'm assuming--",
        "Jessica: Who cares, Ford? It doesn't matter how I know, it just matters that we had sex!",
        "Ford: I never said that.",
        "Jessica: You lied to me, you lied to Brody, you lied to Kelly. I saw your face! You didn't even blink!",
        "Ford: So it was a setup?",
        "Jessica: I knew if we had sex, that you would go get tested for hepatitis C, and you did. So please, tell me--did we have sex?",
        "Ford: Yes. Well, what are you going to do now, go run and tell your boyfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Jessica told me about the baby and the engage--well, actually, no. David blurted it out, but we're going to try and forget about that.",
        "Brody: Well, I hope you approve.",
        "Viki: Oh, Brody, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, so completely. We are so lucky to have you in the family. Congratulations. Oh, I should warn you, though. I want a houseful of grandchildren, okay?",
        "[Brody laughs]",
        "Viki: Congratulations. Isn't it wonderful?",
        "Natalie: Yes, it's perfect, just the way it should be.",
        "Viki: You know, who'd have thought that we'd be saying this even a few months ago?",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Viki: I guess you did, because you never gave up on Jessica, not for a minute. Thank you for that.",
        "Brody: Oh, it wasn't hard. It's what I wanted.",
        "Viki: Well, unfortunately, those two things don't always go together. Thank you so much for sticking with our girl. Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It seems your memory's coming back. So what do you say we start from the beginning?",
        "Hannah: Why are you doing this?",
        "John: Hannah, I just want to try to understand why you'd want to kill yourself.",
        "Hannah: You know what I've done. I attacked Ford. I pushed your girlfriend down the stairs and I killed your baby. You should want me dead, too.",
        "John: But you were adamant to me you didn't commit either of those crimes. And here you are confessing to it all over again.",
        "Hannah: It feels good to come clean.",
        "John: Is that what Eli said?",
        "Hannah: Yeah.",
        "John: Your lawyer told you to confess?",
        "Hannah: He said it would make things easier.",
        "John: What else did Eli tell you? Did he tell you killing yourself was the only way out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So, what is going on with you and John?",
        "Eli: Nothing. He's just doing his job.",
        "Blair: Eli, that's never bothered you before.",
        "Eli: You know what, Blair? It's actually always bothered me. I'm a defense attorney. John McBain is the other team.",
        "Blair: Okay. Okay, time out. You do not get to do this.",
        "Eli: What am I doing?",
        "Blair: I'm going to be your wife very soon, and I need to know what's bothering you. Eli, come on, I can tell that something's bothering you. What is it?",
        "Eli: Okay. I went to St. Ann's to visit Hannah. She tried to kill herself last night.",
        "Blair: That's awful.",
        "Eli: It's okay.",
        "Blair: That's sad.",
        "Eli: She's fine. They found her in time. But I just wanted to go in and talk to her, give her a pep talk, let her know that no matter what she did, life is worth living. But John McBain wouldn't have any of that.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, he wouldn't have any of that?",
        "Eli: He wouldn't let me go in the room to talk to my own client. He--then he started giving me a line of questioning about my last visit. He was treating me like a criminal!",
        "Blair's voice: And since when did my Aunt Melinda's death become a murder?",
        "John's voice: When corpses started showing up every time someone asked a question about her.",
        "Blair's voice: Well, that's just Kelly's conspiracy theory. Why did you buy into it?",
        "John's voice: Do you hear the words coming out of my mouth?",
        "Eli: I don't know why John McBain is all over me, but...",
        "Blair: I do.",
        "Eli: Really?",
        "Blair: I know exactly why John's all over your case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Why did you go along with Dorian? What does she have that you want?",
        "Clint: Oh, Dorian is the whole package.",
        "David: Yeah, and she's ticking.",
        "Clint: You're so jealous, you reek.",
        "David: I'm a little concerned about you, Uncle Clint.",
        "Clint: Yeah, concerned enough to dangle information in front of my face about my ex-wife? Well, I've come to the conclusion you don't have it.",
        "David: Oh, I do.",
        "Clint: Show me.",
        "David: See, you do want the stripper. You don't love Dorian.",
        "Clint: No, you tell me about Kimberly. How did you get her to leave?",
        "David: You don't love Dorian.",
        "Clint: David, tell me.",
        "David: All right, all right. First, you got to promise you're not going to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Why are you pretending to be in love with David?",
        "Mandy: Pretending? Have you seen that body?",
        "Dorian: There's no way that David could afford your rate, not 24 hours a day.",
        "Mandy: We're in love.",
        "Dorian: Even with a bulk discount, he can't afford you.",
        "Mandy: David and me are forever. Like those diamonds of yours that turned green, you're so jealous.",
        "Dorian: These are emeralds.",
        "Mandy: Gorgeous. They'd look even better on me.",
        "Dorian: You want them? They come with a price.",
        "Mandy: You can have David all to yourself.",
        "Dorian: Oh, he's the last thing I want.",
        "Mandy: So what's the catch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Why did you lie to me?",
        "Ford: I don't know--I didn't want your Navy Seal cop boyfriend to come and kill me. For all I knew, you'd tell everyone it was rape.",
        "Jessica: You lied to Kelly.",
        "Ford: Well, I--I had my story. No reason to change it.",
        "Jessica: You shouldn't have lied.",
        "Ford: Look, I already had one crazy dude bash my head in. I didn't need someone else chasing me around town.",
        "Jessica: A dude? I--I thought it was Hannah O'Connor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: That's crazy. No lawyer would say \"kill yourself.\"",
        "John: Agreed. No lawyer should.",
        "Hannah: Eli had nothing to do with...with what I did.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: Suicide attempt--that's--that's what it looked like.",
        "Hannah: Leave me alone.",
        "John: If it's not what it looked like, then we can help you.",
        "Hannah: No, you can't.",
        "John: You wanted to tell someone, didn't you? You wanted to tell Cole. He told me you called him.",
        "Hannah: That was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking.",
        "John: Yeah? Well, it's a smart move. You think keeping quiet's helping?",
        "Hannah: I'm tired.",
        "John: Cole told me you had something important to tell him, and then you shut up the minute Eli walked in the room.",
        "Hannah: I'm going to sleep!",
        "John: If you are afraid of Eli--if you never want to see him again, you don't have to. Whatever he is holding over you, whatever he is threatening you with--",
        "Hannah: It's not me. I'm not the one Eli's threatened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You know why John McBain is treating me like a criminal?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I do.",
        "Eli: Would you care to tell me?",
        "Blair: It's idiotic.",
        "Eli: Well, I could use a good laugh right now.",
        "Blair: It's not funny.",
        "Eli: Tell me, Blair. You just said we're getting married. We don't hide things from each other.",
        "Blair: Okay, okay. It... happens to be about Kelly, actually. She convinced John that you're some kind of criminal.",
        "[Eli scoffs]",
        "Eli: I don't even know what to say. That's--that's beyond ridiculous.",
        "Blair: I know.",
        "Eli: What exactly is it that Kelly thinks I did?",
        "Blair: Oh...she thinks that you played some part in her mother's murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: T\u00e9a's doing a brave thing. She's sparing her family--her husband and daughter--a lot of pain. You'd do the same for your family.",
        "Shaun: I'm sure you would.",
        "Greg: I'll be here with her every step of the way.",
        "T\u00e9a: I still can't believe you're going to do that for me, Greg.",
        "Greg: I wouldn't leave you here alone.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you.",
        "Greg: Of course.",
        "[Shaun sighs]",
        "Greg: I'm going to go finish checking you in, okay? Introduce myself to the doctors on staff. Shaun, would you stay and help her get settled?",
        "Shaun: Sure.",
        "Greg: Thanks.",
        "Shaun: Does it make it better? Having my brother here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, he's a professional. He won't be hurt or get upset by anything that happens or anything I become.",
        "Shaun: Can I help you unpack?",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, I didn't know how to pack for my own death. I went with lounge wear.",
        "Shaun: You're still funny.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha. For today.",
        "Shaun: The grounds are beautiful. You can even hear the surf.",
        "T\u00e9a: Dani misses the ocean. She'd love it here.",
        "Shaun: Then call them. Tell them where you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You lost her in Indiana? It's next door, man.",
        "Man: Actually, Ohio is next door.",
        "Todd: No, that's like losing her across the street. Apparently, you didn't remember how important this was to us. All right, well, just give me their destination and I'll take care of it from here.",
        "Man: I don't know where they were going. They booked multiple tickets and--",
        "Todd: Okay, you're fired. Get lost yourself. Get lost in Indiana.",
        "Dani: You're brutal.",
        "Todd: You better believe it.",
        "Dani: Look, I thought you said we had to let Mom go. You talked me into this.",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dani: You said we had to love her enough to give her what she wanted.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I didn't want to fight her. I just thought if we went along with her...",
        "Dani: That she'd let her guard down and she'd be easier to trail. Only, she wasn't.",
        "Todd: I wonder who she's using.",
        "Dani: Mom knew you were playing her, so she hired someone to throw you off track?",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's how we roll.",
        "Dani: You don't trust each other.",
        "Todd: We trust that we're not going to give up on each other.",
        "Dani: So what's our next move? We have to find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What dude hit you?",
        "Ford: Or fruitcake or psycho--whatever Hannah is.",
        "Jessica: I can't believe I ever let you touch me.",
        "Ford: You did, and you consented. Don't you forget it. You begged me.",
        "Jessica: Did we use a condom? Tell me that we used a condom. Oh, no.",
        "Ford: I--you didn't say anything. I figured you had birth control covered.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Ford: I don't know. You were going off about some Mitch guy doing you, so-- look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. Is that what you want? I'm sorry this whole thing happened.",
        "Jessica: That's not going to help.",
        "Ford: Look, it was one time. You don't even remember, and you're back with your--your Navy Seal boyfriend. It's over.",
        "Jessica: No. It's not.",
        "Ford: Well, it's not cheating if you don't even remem--",
        "Jessica: I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So, we are going to have to start planning. So have you and Jessie decided what kind of a wedding you want?",
        "Brody: Oh, we don't--we don't need much.",
        "Viki: Oh, bite your tongue. Sweetheart, what do you think? It's got be at least two showers, right? One for the wedding, one for the baby.",
        "Natalie: Definitely at least two.",
        "Viki: You okay, honey? You look a little pale.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I'm good.",
        "Viki: Really? Now that I think of it, before we left on vacation, you weren't feeling all that well, were you?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I wasn't--I wasn't sick.",
        "Viki: No, it was that whole business about David's muffins, wasn't it? But then, of course...with Jessie, it was--it was because of the baby. So what was wrong with you?",
        "Natalie: You're not going to believe it.",
        "Viki: Try me.",
        "Natalie: I'm pregnant, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: I never even met Melinda Cramer.",
        "Blair: I know.",
        "Eli: So the idea that I would want her dead doesn't make any sense. What's Kelly thinking?",
        "Blair: Not you, actually. A guy named Bennett Thompson that Kelly says is you.",
        "Eli: Oh. Oh. That is wild.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Believe me, you are a lot calmer than I was when I heard. I mean, when she was going on about you being this murderer, I thought, \"What--Kelly, what are you talking about? You're talking about my Eli as being some sociopathic murderer?\"",
        "Eli: This is why we didn't elope and go to Vegas, isn't it?",

        "Hannah: It'll be okay.",
        "John: You know, if you want to stop Clarke, you need to help me. I can put him away, but not without evidence.",
        "Hannah: Well, there isn't any.",
        "John: Well, there's you. We can get there. But I need your help, Hannah.",
        "Hannah: You're right, okay? Eli told me that if I didn't confess to pushing Marty and attacking Ford, he was going to kill Cole.",
        "John: He said it directly?",
        "Hannah: Then he decided I was a loose end. He brought me the pills, held a gun on me, and said if I didn't swallow them, he would kill Cole. So I took the pills to save Cole.",

        "David: If--if you kill me, my pa will have to arrest you, and I'm not worth it. You don't want to go to jail.",

        "David: I was protecting the family name, and the family fortune. I sent her packing.",
        "Clint: How?",
        "David: It's all on there. You'll see some blacked out stuff. That's from homeland security. Maybe it was from animal control.",
        "Clint: Where's Kimberly now?",

        "Eli: Well, I'd love to hear some of these details.",
        "Blair: No, you wouldn't. It was just Kelly. It's just the way that she grieves. I just wish she hadn't focused on you.",
        "Eli: It doesn't matter. Kelly can't hurt me.",
        "Blair: Really? What about Todd? Some mixed-up girl says a lie and Todd ends up in jail.",
        "Eli: I am not Todd. Although now, I kind of know what it feels like to be him.",
        "Blair: Hmm. John was that awful to you?",
        "Eli: Well, it makes perfect sense, if your cousin's trying to convince him I'm serial killer.",
        "Blair: Well, I told him it was a load of bull.",
        "Eli: What, you spoke to John?",
        "Blair: Absolutely. I went over there and said, \"You know what? Kelly's crazy. She's mixed up.\" He needs to back off.",
        "Eli: Oh, I bet he loved that. Come on, I can take it. What else did John say?",
        "Blair: Eli, John's fair. He's got to go through protocol, he's got to do his thing, and then when he finds out there's no evidence, he'll just drop it.",
        "Eli: And there is no evidence, is there?",
        "Blair: Not one bit.",

        "John: Huh. Well, Hannah, you don't know what will turn up. So let's just go through it again. Did you even see anyone push Marty down the stairs?",
        "Hannah: It was Eli Clarke. I'm so sorry about your baby.",
        "John: Tell me what happened.",
        "Hannah: I saw Dr. Saybrooke go into the stairwell. I was a minute behind her, maybe. And I saw a man wearing gloves push her down the stairwell.",
        "John: What did you do?",
        "Hannah: I ran. I'm sorry. I just--he started to turn around and I thought he was going to see me.",
        "John: Did you recognize him?",
        "Hannah: Not then. I had never seen Eli before.",
        "John: So you never thought it was Todd Manning?",
        "Hannah: No. I know I should have told the police the truth. I wanted to break up Starr and Cole and I knew that if she took her father's side...",
        "John: Hannah, listen to me. Was there anyone else in that stairwell that day that might have seen Clarke?",
        "Hannah: No. And there definitely wasn't anybody there when he threatened me. See? I can't help you.",
