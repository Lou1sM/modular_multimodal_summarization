    "Recap": [
        "Irene goes to face Viki and her \"two\" sons to tell the entire story of her pregnancy, birth of her \"twins\", how she gave up one and put him to use working for the CIA and then conspired to have him killed. And that is how original Todd turned into the completely different face of current Todd in 2003. She also speaks about how she was able to brainwash and program them both so that they have the \"same memories\" and the same lives and each believes that only he is Todd Manning. Brody goes upstairs to see \"his\" baby and reveals, privately to Liam that he has destroyed the tape that reveals that Marty switched the DNA so that people falsely believe Liam is Brody's when in fact he is John's. Downstairs, Natalie finds John, still not consciously aware of what was revealed on the tape nor having any clue that her baby is John's and not Brody's. But Roxy has urged her to find out the secret about what is revealed on the tape and seems to know that there is something Natalie has to realize regarding John. Delphina has also made a comment about that. Yet neither Natalie or John or anyone else have a clue that Liam is John's son."

        "Dorian: Oh! Oh! David! David!",
        "David: What? What is it?",
        "Dorian: We've been robbed. I'm calling the police. I know who did it.",
        "Dorian: Who?",
        "David: It was me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "New Todd: Eh, you're wasting your time. The mystery page is gone. Whatever my mother wrote on it died with her a long time ago.",
        "Viki: My God, you're Irene.",
        "Irene: Hello, Victoria. Long time no see.",
        "Old Todd: Irene Manning was my mother, not yours.",
        "New Todd: Eh, if we could go back in time and ask her, she'd tell you.",
        "[Footsteps]",
        "New Todd: Wait a minute here.",
        "Old Todd: Are you--",
        "Viki: Irene Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Whoa, it didn't take long for my father to get back to his old self. He's barely settled in. He's already complaining about his doctor's orders to get some sleep. ok? What's wrong? Hey, hey, hey, you ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: What's his problem?",
        "Aubrey: He's friends with the Buchanans. You remember them, don't you, the people we used and manipulated?",
        "Cutter: Vaguely.",
        "Aubrey: Face it, Cutter. We are now the town pariahs. Can't believe we got kicked out of that movie premiere. That was so humiliating.",
        "Cutter: Who cares? The big event didn't even happen.",
        "Aubrey: So much for reeling in a catch.",
        "Cutter: [German accent] Well, when one door closes--",
        "Aubrey: What are you talking about?",
        "Cutter: [Normal voice] Our next mark.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey, Shane, you having a good time with Echo? Good. No. I'm fine. I just have a lot of work to do.",
        "Natalie: Hey, Rox, are you in here? Rox?",
        "Roxy: Uh, coming. What's wrong? Tell me. What's wrong?",
        "Natalie: What makes you think something is wrong?",
        "Roxy: Listen. I'm a mama. I know when something is bothering our kid, so spit it out.",
        "Natalie: It's Rex. I'm worried about him.",
        "Roxy: Oh, tell me about it. He's having such a rough time. He misses Gigi so much.",
        "Natalie: It's worse than that.",
        "Roxy: How can it be worse?",
        "Natalie: He sees dead people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "New Todd: You're--",
        "Old Todd: Dead.",
        "Viki: I don't understand this at all. Last time I saw you, you left Tina in my care, and you told me that you had cancer and you were dying.",
        "Irene: Except I wasn't. I wanted to give my daughter a better life and to reunite two sisters who knew nothing about each other, and now two brothers have been reunited, as well--my sons.",
        "Todd: You're my mother?",
        "Old Todd: My mother, apparently. You want to explain where you materialized from?",
        "John: Yeah. Well, look. We'll get into all that later. Right now, the important thing is, she's in police custody, and we've made arrangements for her to come here and tell you all the truth.",
        "Viki: Something that we're all rather anxious to hear.",
        "Irene: Well, if you have my diary, then you already know.",
        "Old Todd: We know nothing. The page where you explain what happened to your second son Victor is missing. There's--",
        "Irene: Yes. I gave birth to two babies, identical twin boys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Rex is seeing dead people, like Elvis, Marilyn, Anna Nicole?",
        "Natalie: No! Gigi. Ever since she died, Rex has been seeing her everywhere in the house.",
        "Roxy: Well, that makes sense because he misses her. Sometimes the mind plays very funny tricks on you.",
        "Natalie: No. No. Rex isn't just seeing her, Rox. He believes that she's really there, and we both know that that's impossible.",
        "Roxy: No. That's not impossible, not if you believe in the para-abnormal. No. Maybe her ghost is trying to tell him something.",
        "Natalie: Well, Rex thinks it's more than that, and I just want him to have peace, you know, with Gigi's death, so I called Delphina.",
        "Roxy: What a great idea because the woman is a genius.",
        "Natalie: Eh, well, not this time. She got a message from Gigi.",
        "Roxy: Well, that sounds great. What was the message?",
        "Natalie: \"Spotted pony.\"",
        "Roxy: \"Spotted pony\"?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: What the hell does that mean?",
        "Natalie: Exactly. It doesn't mean anything.",
        "Roxy: If Delphina got a message from Gigi, dollars to donuts, spotted pony means something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Hey, Rex.",
        "Rex: Hey, Cris, what's up?",
        "Cristian: Hey, listen. I've been meaning to stop by. I have this for you. It was a class assignment. Everyone had to do a self-portrait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Rex Balsom? Are you kidding me?",
        "Cutter: Why not? The guy is loaded. He got all of Clint Buchanan's cash and holdings. Besides, he stole the mansion out from underneath me, which makes it personal.",
        "Aubrey: I don't know.",
        "Cutter: He's perfect, as long as you don't fall in love with him like you did with Joey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I'm fine.",
        "Joey: You sure?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "Joey: Ok.",
        "Kelly: It's just looking at these sweet, little guys. You know, they-- it feels like just yesterday Zane was this tiny. All these moments go by so fast, I don't want to miss one more of them.",
        "Joey: I know. I know. Look. He was pretty amazing in that camp play, wasn't he? He was.",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "Joey: He was.",
        "Kelly: Oh, he's so happy to spend the summer up there, you know, and seeing him on Parents' Day, it made me miss him so much.",
        "Joey: Oh, I know, sweetie. I know how hard it is for you to be away from Zane for so long.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I'm so glad you understand...",
        "Joey: Of course.",
        "Kelly: Because that means you're also gonna understand why I have to leave Llanview and go to London as soon as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Why would you ransack our living room?",
        "David: I ran into the two Todds this afternoon.",
        "Dorian: Like one isn't enough?",
        "David: I had to figure out which one was the real one so I could broker a movie deal.",
        "Dorian: Any luck?",
        "David: Not yet, but I got the ball rolling. I just had to find Irene's diary.",
        "Dorian: Irene Manning's diary, absolutely. And?",
        "David: Mission accomplished. Took a little digging, but I found it.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Oh, I remember Irene Manning's diary. Wow, it saved my life.",
        "David: Strictly speaking, I saved your life. The part where Irene confessed to killing Victor Lord didn't forge itself, you know.",
        "Dorian: One of your finest moments. I was exonerated.",
        "David: Of the murder you didn't commit.",
        "Dorian: Or so Viki chooses to believe.",
        "David: What was that?",
        "Dorian: Victor Lord deserved to die. He needed killing after all the terrible things that he did.",
        "David: Yeah, the least of which was foisting two Todd Mannings on this unsuspecting world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So it's true? They're twins?",
        "Irene: The male heirs of Victor Lord.",
        "New Todd: But--",
        "Viki: Wait, wait. Do you want t explain this?",
        "Irene: When I told Victor that I was pregnant again, I thought he'd be happy. Needless to say, he was not. In fact, he told me he wanted nothing more to do with me, cut me off without a dime. So I gave birth alone. That's when I discovered that I'd been carrying twins. I could barely afford to take care of one child, never mind two, so I gave one of my baby boys to Peter to raise, the one I'd named Todd.",
        "Old Todd: I remember.",
        "New Todd: Yeah. Well, so do I.",
        "Viki: Hang on a minute, ok? Well, what happened to the other one?",
        "Irene: Ah, the other one. He was quiet, different, what some might call special. I raised him myself, named him Victor--Victor Lord, Jr.",
        "Viki: So is this the first time that you have been together with your twin sons since they were born?",
        "Irene: No, actually, not the first time at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Backup units are here. We got men posted outside.",
        "John: Good. Hey, thanks for your help on this one, man. You did good. Look. Why don't you head on home? I got it from here.",
        "Brody: Thanks.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "John: McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "New Todd: This is absolutely ridiculous. I have no idea what this woman is talking about. I have never laid eyes on her before in my life.",
        "Old Todd: And I just met this guy.",
        "Irene: Please, boys, be patient. Everything will be explained.",
        "Viki: By all means, explain.",
        "Irene: I was alone with Victor Jr. No money, no security--so I turned to desperate measures. I met a man who worked for the CIA, and he got me involved.",
        "Old Todd: Got you involved in the CIA?",
        "Irene: I climbed the ladder quickly, but more importantly, I was finally able to provide for my son who wasn't able to take care of himself.",
        "New Todd: Well, like I said, I have never seen you before, so obviously, I'm the one that you gave away, and this is the one you raised, right?",
        "Old Todd: No. I was raised by Peter Manning, and I remember every second.",
        "Viki: Irene, both of these fellas insist they're Todd Manning. Both of them seem to be able to back up that claim. Do you want to explain that?",
        "Irene: Be patient, Victoria. I'm getting to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: I'm not hitting on Rex.",
        "Cutter: Why not?",
        "Aubrey: He just lost his fianc\u00e9e. He's in mourning.",
        "Cutter: Yeah, which means he's lonely now and desperate for a pretty shoulder to cry on. Come on. There's no harm in testing the waters.",
        "Cristian: Gigi had a lot of talent. She had an unusual gift for conveying what was under the surface.",
        "Rex: Wish I knew what she was trying to convey now. Hey, do you guys have a wireless printer here?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, in the office.",
        "Rex: Could I print something out from my laptop?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. I don't see why not.",
        "Rex: Thanks.",
        "Aubrey: She was beautiful.",
        "Rex: She still is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: Look, Kelly. I know how much you miss Zane, all right? I mean, I love the kid, too.",
        "Kelly: I know, and you're so good with him.",
        "Joey: I know, ok, but we literally got back together, like, 10 minutes ago, all right? We have had no time to establish any sort of a relationship or--",
        "Brody: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you guys were in here.",
        "Kelly: It's ok. You know babies. Everybody loves them. Ha ha ha!",
        "Brody: Yeah. Hey. I just came to see my son--come here, buddy-- take him out for a little while. What you got attached to? Little toy.",
        "Kelly: Brody, he is so beautiful.",
        "Joey: Yeah.",
        "Kelly: Treasure every single moment because it goes by so fast.",
        "Brody: Yeah. I'll see you.",
        "Joey: Bye. So...",
        "Kelly: Look. I know what you're gonna say, and I know what my leaving means for our relationship.",
        "Brody: Don't look at me like that. I know we got a little problem. Manning, at least the Todd Manning I know, he knows the truth, that John is your biological dad. Don't you worry, Liam. I won't let him destroy our family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't know, Roxy. Spotted pony? I don't see what that has to do with Gigi or how that's gonna help with Rex's grief. I just don't know. I feel like maybe Delphina is a little off her game. Although--",
        "Roxy: Although what?",
        "Natalie: Well, she was there to help Rex, but she kind of did say a little something about my future with Brody.",
        "Roxy: What? What did she say?",
        "Natalie: Was a little vague, but it didn't sound good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I just got off the phone with the lab. The second DNA test confirms the first DNA test. She's telling the truth. You are twins.",
        "Old Todd: But how is it that we have the same memories?",
        "Irene: I must admit that I would feel more comfortable speaking openly without the lieutenant present.",
        "Viki: Is that all right, John?",
        "John: Yeah. Yeah. That's more than all right. I'll give you a few minutes if-- you can tell me the story down at the station.",
        "Irene: I appreciate it.",
        "John: I'll be right outside. The cuffs stay on.",
        "Irene: Things changed over the years. What the agency was offering was no longer enough, so I turned to special activities.",
        "Old Todd: You mean, illegal activities.",
        "Irene: During this time, I kept close tabs on Todd's life from afar. Obviously, Victor did, also. You can imagine my surprise when I learned that he had named Todd in his will and left him somewhere close to $30 million.",
        "Viki: Anyone else would have come forward then, made it known there was another son to share the inheritance.",
        "Irene: But to come forward meant explaining where I had been and what I'd been doing, and I was not willing to jeopardize what I had built, but I did want my son Victor to get what was rightfully his and more. So that's when I realized that there was another way Todd could be useful to me. My people approached Todd. They told him how he could serve his country.",
        "New Todd: You were behind that?",
        "Viki: Behind what?",
        "New Todd: These people said there was some kind of business deal and that I'd be doing my patriotic duty by funding antiterrorism. Now, that certainly was me. That was me, and I said no.",
        "Old Todd: I said no. I figured out where the money was going.",
        "New Todd: No, bro. That happened to me.",
        "Old Todd: Some crazy rogue organization.",
        "Viki: Ok. What then?",
        "Irene: Todd refused to be part of our operation. He even threatened to expose us. As a result, he had to be eliminated. So my people contacted a legitimate CIA agent and told them that Todd was an enemy of the state.",
        "Old Todd: A legitimate CIA agent. Tom\u00e1s Delgado.",
        "New Todd: Right. So he did try to kill me. That would prove that I'm me, right?",
        "Viki: Irene--",
        "Irene: There's more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: He's getting big.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Heavy, too.",
        "John: I didn't realize you'd moved back in here.",
        "Brody: No. It's still too crowded. Look. You're gonna find out eventually. Natalie and I are looking for a place of our own where we can live with Liam. [Slurp]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So what are you gonna do about what Delphina said?",
        "Natalie: Nothing.",
        "Roxy: Nothing? You're gonna do nothing?",
        "Natalie: There's nothing to do. I mean, yeah. I'm sure Brody and I will have a few bumps in the road. What couple doesn't?",
        "Roxy: Well, how often is a couple on a bumpy road and a psychic is standing on the corner going, \"Look out!\"?",
        "Natalie: She didn't say, \"Look out.\" I really don't know what she said, but you know what? Whatever. Why sit there and focus on the future when there's nothing you can do about it? Right now at this present time, Brody and I are just fine. I'm just sorry that Delphina couldn't help Rex.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. So am I. You know, before you got here, I was thinking about Gigi, you know, and the last time I saw her, she was so crazy. You know, she's getting ready for the wedding, and I found this tape recorder, and I gave it to her because I thought maybe there was some groovy music on it for the wedding.",
        "Natalie: Wait. That turned out to be my tape player.",
        "Roxy: Yours?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. We recovered it after Gigi died.",
        "Roxy: Well, what was on it?",
        "Natalie: I don't remember.",
        "Roxy: Do I got to do all the heavy thinking for you? All you got to do is hit play.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I did... and it was blank.",
        "Roxy: What? That doesn't make any sense.",
        "Natalie: Why not?",
        "Roxy: Because when I found it, I had to rewind it.",
        "Natalie: But you didn't hear what was on the tape?",
        "Roxy: No. I didn't get a chance to listen to it. I don't know. Maybe Gigi erased it.",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Maybe. You know, John practically accused Brody of tampering with it, that he thought Brody erased it.",
        "Roxy: Why'd he think that?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Maybe John was a little angry about Brody and me, but what's really bugging me is, I could've sworn whatever was on that tape had to do with the fight that Marty and I had up on the roof.",
        "Roxy: When Marty stole Liam. Delphina said something about you two arguing about the baby's daddy.",
        "Natalie: It doesn't matter now. Marty is gone. Liam is fine.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but you're not because you got a hole in your memory that is eating you alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: All right, Aubrey. Work your magic.",
        "Aubrey: So how are you doing?",
        "Cristian: Everything you ever wanted to know about spotted pony on the net.",
        "Rex: Thank you. Just got to find the right one.",
        "Aubrey: Wow, that's quite a stack. If you tell me what you're looking for, I could maybe help you.",
        "Rex: That's ok. I'm just checking with something Gigi is interested in. Was interested in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: It was that diary that first brought us together.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. You blackmailed me into not revealing that the entry which saved my life was actually a forgery.",
        "David: And then we got married for the very first time.",
        "Dorian: Yes, due to dire circumstances, mostly involving Viki, because we hated each other.",
        "David: You tricked me into a divorce without alimony.",
        "Dorian: Aw, poor David.",
        "David: Button, button. We sure knew how to push each other's buttons, didn't we, baby...",
        "Dorian: Oh, we sure did.",
        "David: Like maybe this button here?",
        "Dorian: Oh, and that button there.",
        "David: That button there.",
        "Dorian: Oh, honey...",
        "David: Oh, baby, there's buttons everywhere.",
        "Dorian: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You ordered your own son killed?",
        "Irene: I had long since stopped thinking of Todd as my son. As I said, I kept watch, and I had seen what kind of man he had become. Ultimately, it didn't matter. By the time Tom\u00e1s Delgado got to him, someone had beat him to the punch, quite literally. He found Todd beaten, bloody, and left for dead.",
        "Viki: That was Mitch Laurence.",
        "Irene: Yes. I was informed of the situation, and it gave me a brilliant idea. Instead of having Todd killed, I arranged to have him brought to me, and for the first time since I had given my son to Peter, all 3 of us were together-- me and my sons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: If you're leaving Llanview--",
        "Kelly: We have to put our relationship on hold. You have to stay here for your father.",
        "Joey: Kelly, I'm not putting our relationship on hold.",
        "Kelly: I don't want that, either.",
        "Joey: All right. Look. I thought my father was going to prison, but he didn't end up there. I mean, I'm thrilled and relieved that he's not, ok, but between my mother, my sisters, the army of doctors and nurses he has downstairs, he's gonna be well taken care of, and the last thing he's gonna want is for me to be hovering over him.",
        "Kelly: Don't you think he wants you here, too?",
        "Joey: Well, what he wants, what he's always wanted, is for the two of us to find a way back together, and now that I have you, I'm not-- I'm not gonna let you go again. So if you're moving to London, I guess I'm just gonna have to go with you. I mean, is that ok?",
        "Kelly: It's more than ok.",
        "Joey: Good. Well, ok, then. Well, let's go tell my dad the news.",
        "Kelly: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I just--",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Kelly: I need some time to think about what I'm going to say to her. I'm not looking forward to telling my aunt she'll have one less Cramer under the roof.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, I'm so glad we thought to lock the living room doors.",
        "David: Yeah. At least this mess isn't my fault now.",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "David: Ah, hold on a second.",
        "Dorian: No.",
        "David: I'll get that.",
        "David: David Vickers Buchanan Productions, David Vickers Buchanan speaking. What? Really? Of course. That was Bev Altman.",
        "Dorian: Who is Bev whatever?",
