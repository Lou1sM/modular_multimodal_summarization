        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Todd: Hey. That is one stunning evening dress.",
        "Evangeline: You're early, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I was going to stay with Starr a little longer, but she finally fell asleep. Plus, she told me I needed to go home and take a shower. I was getting a little --",
        "Evangeline: Well, she must be feeling better.",
        "Todd: Yeah, a little bit. They don't know what's wrong with her mentally, still, but -- god, the poor thing's been through so much.",
        "Evangeline: So have you.",
        "Todd: So have you. And that's why we're going to party tonight, am I right? We're going to have a good time, am I right? No one else might have a good time, but you and I are going to have a good time.",
        "Evangeline: I'm worried about Cristian.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes, Cristian.",
        "Evangeline: I haven't -- I haven't called him yet to tell him I'm home. I feel too guilty. I mean, we get to get dressed up and go to the ball, and he's stuck at the gym training -- not that he'd want to go.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Todd: Oh -- hold on. Let me get that. That's a surprise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Bo, you got to do something. She's still missing -- Adriana.",
        "Bo: I know, I know. Dorian just told me.",
        "Rex: Well, did she also tell you she set up the whole thing? Hired someone to terrorize her own daughter just because she didn't like me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Oh, hi.",
        "Antonio: Nash.",
        "Nash: Hi.",
        "Antonio: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Jessica: I had to get out of the apartment, so I decided I'd tag along with Nash and Bree.",
        "Antonio: That's great.",
        "Jessica: Did you talk to Bo?",
        "Antonio: I did, I did, and I should be reinstated any day now. But it's not official yet. Surprisingly enough, they have some paperwork to be processed.",
        "Jessica: Oh, amazing.",
        "Antonio: Go figure. But Bo did tell me where I'm going to be working -- Vice -- and I think you should know about it, since it's about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: Excuse me. I'm looking for John Mc Bain?",
        "Natalie: What do you want with him now?",
        "Claudia: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I love you, too. Spencer's out. He's not going to be in his suite for a while.",
        "John: Doesn't give us a lot of time.",
        "Blair: We don't need a lot of time, John, we just got to get a move on it.",
        "John: Just so you know --",
        "Blair: It's dangerous. I know. I also know if I want my family back -- and I do -- this is the only way that I can nail Spencer.",
        "John: All right. You think you can get your hands on the safe-deposit box key?",
        "Blair: I'll find it.",
        "John: Ok. You get the key, you get it to me, I check the box. If I get the gun, I get you back the key, you put the --",
        "Blair: Look, John, don't worry about that. You just haul Spencer in.",
        "John: I can't.",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "John: It's an illegal search, all right? If the gun is there, I need to get a search warrant. It's not enough that we get the gun. The gun needs to be admissible evidence, all right? So this stays just between you and me.",
        "Blair: Absolutely.",
        "John: Another thing.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "John: After tonight, you're out, you're done. You got me?",
        "Blair: No. No. I am not done until Spencer pays for what he did, and Todd knows that I'm doing all this for him.",
        "John: I'll make sure -- I'll make sure he knows, all right? You just keep Spencer busy during the gala. This is what you're looking for. Good luck.",
        "Blair: Well, if that gun isn't admissible, I know another really good use for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claudia: I'm here on police business. I witnessed a crime.",
        "Natalie: You don't need the chief of detectives for that.",
        "Claudia: And I don't need your permission for anything.",
        "Natalie: You used John once. It ain't going to happen again.",
        "Claudia: Listen, Kim Possible, I am not out to use anyone. I -- I am the victim here.",
        "Natalie: A role you played to the hilt, I'm sure.",
        "John: Natalie. Why don't you let me handle this? What is it you want now?",
        "Claudia: I -- um -- was held at gunpoint during the attempted robbery at Capricorn and I -- I made a statement, but I guess I forgot to sign my name.",
        "Natalie: You don't need to talk to the chief of detectives about signing your stupid name!",
        "John: Excuse me. If you'll take a seat over there, I'll be with you in a minute.",
        "Claudia: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Natalie: You think she's going to try to get away with it? Who's she kidding?",
        "John: What are you doing? You can't do this and work here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: This is twisted, even for her. She did all this to make Adriana think that I did all this, that I'd come out looking like some kind of hero --",
        "Dorian: You are delusional.",
        "Rex: And you're sick and cruel.",
        "Bo: Is this true?",
        "Dorian: Bo, how can you even ask me such a thing?",
        "Bo: Oh, I have some nerve, don't I? I mean, you've always been so truthful, so aboveboard.",
        "Dorian: You should be looking for Adriana instead of abusing me.",
        "Bo: If this turns out to be some kind of hoax --",
        "Dorian: It isn't. Bo, it isn't. Honestly, I have no idea where ad-- Adriana is. I -- no idea at all.",
        "Rex: Oh, crap.",
        "Bo: What, you don't believe her?",
        "Rex: No, I do. And if she doesn't know where Adriana is, then this whole thing is even worse than I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What are you doing out of the hospital?",
        "Evangeline: I was going to call you. I just haven't had --",
        "Cristian: The doctors said tomorrow.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I talked them into today.",
        "Cristian: I should've been there.",
        "Evangeline: No, Cristian, you were training. It's ok.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you were training. I drove her home. It's ok.",
        "Evangeline: That's -- that's a pretty formal training outfit you have there.",
        "Cristian: Well, when I found out you got released, I remembered you wanted to go to that big bash the hospital was throwing. So I'm taking you. You can go.",
        "Todd: That's funny -- you don't want her to leave the hospital, but you want to take her dancing?",
        "Cristian: Don't you worry. I'll make sure she doesn't push herself too hard.",
        "Todd: You know, you said that your training session's more important than her, but she comes in here last minute and you want to take her to the gala?",
        "Cristian: I never said that.",
        "Evangeline: Ok, you guys, remember we said we weren't going to do this anymore at the hospital? I'm sorry, Todd, this is between me and Cristian.",
        "Cristian: See ya.",
        "Evangeline: Actually, no. Cristian, I said I would go to the gala with Todd, and that's what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Hey, baby.",
        "Blair: Oh!",
        "Spencer: How are you doing?",
        "Blair: You're here!",
        "Spencer: Yeah, well --",
        "Blair: I wasn't expecting that.",
        "Spencer: My last appointment finished a little early, so, you know, I -- wow, wow, wow. Look at you -- deja vu.",
        "Blair: Well it better not be. They told me this dress was an original. They better not have been lying.",
        "Spencer: Well, I mean, about a year ago in July when you walked into the country club, you were wearing something, you know, kind of similar to this. I must say, it wasn't the dress that knocked my socks off, though.",
        "Blair: Oh, right, it was just my natural beauty, right?",
        "Spencer: That's right. You're darn right it was. I've never seen anything so beautiful in my life.",
        "Blair: Well, you -- kind of clean up nice yourself there, Doctor.",
        "Spencer: Wait a minute. What's going on with you? What, are you a little on edge or something, huh?",
        "Blair: No -- no, I just -- I think, with Starr in the hospital and everything, it's -- it's kind of ridiculous that I get all gussied up with my little girl in the hospital.",
        "Spencer: I understand. Look, I reviewed her file myself, she's going to be fine. I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure of it.",
        "Blair: Hmm. Ok.",
        "Spencer: All right?",
        "Blair: What about me?",
        "Spencer: Oh, I have something very special planned for you tonight.",
        "Blair: What -- you e a renowned doctor.",
        "Spencer: Yes, I am.",
        "Blair: You cannot go out looking like this.",
        "Spencer: Wait a minute --",
        "Blair: You can't even tie your tie right?",
        "Spencer: Hey, hey -- whoa, I left it that way on purpose.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, I messed it up. Oh, I messed your shirt up.",
        "Spencer: I'll fix it, but --",
        "Blair: Sorry, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: It's all right.",
        "Blair: You need to button your tie and --",
        "Spencer: I don't like ties, anyway.",
        "Blair: I know, but --",
        "Spencer: Since when are you so worried about ties?",
        "Blair: Well, you're right, I am on edge. I hope you can fix it. I'm sorry.",
        "Spencer: I can fix it --",
        "Blair: Yeah, I --",
        "Spencer: I'm thinking if I could get a little champagne or something--",
        "Blair: Oh, that sounds great. We should have that, like, before, you know, we go.",
        "Spencer: No, after we get to the gala. I've got a welcome speech to give, remember?",
        "Blair: Well, then, they'll just have to wait for us, I guess.",
        "Spencer: I'm a little bit nervous about it because I haven't really prepared much for the evening because I have this surprise for you.",
        "Blair: Great! Really? Well, what -- what's the surprise? I can't wait to see it.",
        "Spencer: Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be much of a surprise, now, would it?",
        "Blair: Oh, that's right, that's right.",
        "Spencer: All right. How's this? Pass inspection?",
        "Blair: You look marvelous, just marvelous. Shall we go?",
        "Spencer: Let's go.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Spencer: Absolutely.",
        "Blair: All right. Thank you. Oh --",
        "Spencer: Hey, hey, hey --",
        "Blair: Oh, Spencer --",
        "Spencer: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Because of what happened to you, Jess, when you were a kid, we've decided to form a task force targeting child pornography.",
        "Jessica: Those tapes?",
        "Antonio: Yes. We're going to find all those tapes and the creeps who bought them.",
        "Jessica: I don't like talking about this.",
        "Nash: There's other tapes? You drop that on her -- did you know that there's other --",
        "Jessica: I knew there were other tapes, Nash. Antonio's right. We have to do this.",
        "Antonio: I want this to be over --",
        "Jessica: I know.",
        "Antonio: Completely over for you.",
        "Jessica: I know. It sounds like a horrible job, but thank god you're doing it.",
        "Antonio: Well, anyone who uses kids that way should pay the price. [Phone rings] I have to take this.",
        "Jessica: Go ahead.",
        "Nash: You ok?",
        "Jessica: I have to be.",
        "Nash: Can you fix this?",
        "Jessica: Well, Dr. Jamison says that I have to face it. I can't use -- Tess can't be the keeper of those memories.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, on my way. I'm sorry, but I have to go.",
        "Jessica: It's ok. It's ok. Thanks for telling me.",
        "Antonio: All right.",
        "Nash: Well, he sure slipped into the cop thing pretty quickly.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's Antonio. When he finds out what's important, he makes a decision.",
        "Nash: I get that. And I know what's important to me, and I just made my decision.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What's our motto? \"Protect and serve.\" You know, a civilian -- they come into this station. Whether we like them or not, we don't treat them that way.",
        "Natalie: \"Civilian\"?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Natalie: Yeah -- if that's what you want to call a conniving slut. See, you know I'm right.",
        "John: Yeah, you're right. You're -- you're right about everything.",
        "Natalie: Ok, now I'm getting a little scared.",
        "John: I'm not going to fight with you. I need your help.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. Gosh, you know, I wish I could, but I got to study for my exams. I'm kind of busy.",
        "John: Oh, you're busy? Ok, well, then I won't even bother asking.",
        "Natalie: Oh, stop. Come on, you know I'll help you. Just don't be so smug about it.",
        "John: Well, when this is done, I'll help you study. How's that?",
        "Natalie: What am I going to do?",
        "John: Well, you're going to go to the gala. What do you think about that?",
        "Natalie: Ooh. Undercover at the gala, some gritty police work.",
        "John: Yeah. The thing is, Truman would be suspicious if he saw me with Blair, but not you. So she's going to slip you the key and you're going to give it to me, ok?",
        "Natalie: Ok. No problem.",
        "John: \"No problem\"? This is serious. I need you to take it serious.",
        "Natalie: Ok. I will.",
        "John: All right. I -- I'm going to go deal with the \"conniving --\"",
        "Natalie: Slut?",
        "John: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Thank you. Ok. Pictures of Adriana are being distributed on the mainland across from where she left on the boat. There are units that are canvassing the area, seeing if anybody saw Adriana. If they did see her, they want to know if she was alone.",
        "Dorian: Of course she was alone. She's just so angry at Rex for his betrayal that she -- she's taking some time to be alone before she comes home.",
        "Bo: Well, I hope you're right.",
        "Rex: She's got no money, no phone, no I.D. where do you think she's taking this time?",
        "Bo: All right, this is being treated as a missing-persons case. Now, I want all the correspondence from this stalker.",
        "Rex: Well, then confiscate her hard drive because there is no stalker. He's just another one of her brilliant ideas -- like setting me up to look like a junkie.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Rex: You remember that? That was her, too. Paid someone to shoot me up with heroin, almost killed me, but, hey, anything to keep me and Adriana apart, right?",
        "Clint: Dorian? Is that true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Spencer, I told you, I just feel a little weird going out tonight, that's all.",
        "Spencer: Ok, then we won't, then.",
        "Blair: Yes, we're going to go. You have a very important speech. I just -- if you could maybe just get me some -- some water, I'm --",
        "Spencer: Water?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Spencer: Blair, come on, now --",
        "Blair: Spencer, I will be fine. There's nothing I want more than to walk into that gala on your arm tonight, ok? Some water.",
        "Spencer: I want that, too. I'll get you some water.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Spencer: Water, coming up.",
        "Blair: Thank you. Ahem. I'm fine. I was looking for clues.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: We got evidence that Norman Leeds wrote several checks to you over the course of 10 years --",
        "Man: Can I get something to drink?",
        "Antonio: Starting about 20 years ago. Bob, I want to know what he was paying you for.",
        "Bob: Whoa. Am I going to get into trouble?",
        "Antonio: Well, that depends on how much help you are.",
        "Bob: I -- I wasn't doing anything wrong.",
        "Antonio: Well, then you got nothing to worry about. But, bob, if you don't tell me, I'm going to get pretty upset, and you don't want that and neither do I.",
        "Bob: I delivered stuff. That's what he paid me for.",
        "Antonio: \"Stuff\"? Like videotapes?",
        "Bob: I wasn't supposed to look inside the envelopes.",

        "Bob: Yeah -- guys.",
        "Antonio: Do you remember their names?",
        "Bob: Yeah. There -- there was a Stanley Hill, and a guy named Hagan -- he was a regular stop -- and -- oh, a doctor. A Snyder, Dr. Eugene Snyder.",
        "Antonio: That's good, bob. That's real good.",
        "Bob: Can I have something to drink now? A lemonade?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. Yeah, bob, anything you want. Look, this is almost over. I just got a couple more questions.",
        "Bob: My head hurts. I don't like this.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I know. Look, bob, did you ever see what was inside the envelopes?",
        "Bob: He told me not to look.",
        "Antonio: Leeds can't hurt you now.",
        "Bob: I just wanted to see what -- what was so important.",
        "Antonio: They were videotapes, right?",
        "Bob: Yeah.",
        "Antonio: Was there any printing on any of them?",
        "Bob: No. All it said was girls' names.",
        "Antonio: Like?",
        "Bob: Like \"Rose,\" \"Donna,\" \"Tess.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I have always had a dream of running my own vineyard, and Tess -- Tess made that happen. But I've been trying to run it from here to hold on to it.",
        "Jessica: Well, you should hold on to your dreams.",
        "Nash: Yeah, but things change. And you got to change with them.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. Yeah, I take that concept to extremes.",
        "Nash: Wow. You're more like Tess than I knew.",
        "Jessica: So does this mean you've changed your mind and you're going back to Napa?",
        "Nash: No. I'm not going to let go of the vineyard. It meant too much to Tess. But I'm going to try to get involved with a business closer to home. Close to Brennan -- that's where my home is.",
        "Jessica: Ok, Nash, listen. If you think that you're just going to set up camp here and wait for Tess to come back out, that's not going to happen and I'm going to make sure of it.",
        "Nash: I know that.",
        "Jessica: It's not enough to know it. You have to accept it. I'm going to go move the car.",
        "Nash: Don't worry, she's wrong. Tess will be back, and you and I will be right here waiting for her.",

        "Cristian: You're going with him?",
        "Todd: Yeah. See ya.",
        "Evangeline: No, actually, you will see him, because I'm going with both of you.",
        "Todd: That sounds fun.",
        "Evangeline: It will be fun. It will be fun, unless one of you chooses to act like a jerk.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Todd: That's Starr's nurse. I got to take it.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, you can take it in the other room if you want.",
        "Todd: Thanks. Hey, Starr.",
        "Cristian: Is this payback?",
        "Evangeline: For what?",
        "Cristian: I know -- I know I shouldn't have surprised you, but do I really deserve a night with this guy?",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, you being here is a wonderful surprise. And -- look, Todd -- he's going through a really hard time right now and I want to be there for him. I mean, when I was going through a really hard time, he was there for me. And look at you. I mean, I didn't think this was possible, but you look even better than I remember. And I can see you because of him.",
        "Cristian: Right. And I know how loyal you are.",
