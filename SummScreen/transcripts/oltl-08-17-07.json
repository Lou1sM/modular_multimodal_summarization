        "Natalie, Joey, Kevin, and Jessica spend some quality time together. Blair wants to know why Max kissed her. Sarah tells Cord that she doesn't deserve to be in Asa's house, since she never found the time to visit him. When Lindsay asks where Bo is, Nora informs her he went for a walk with a bottle of bourbon and Clint went to him, so she doesn't have to run after him. Asa's ex-wife, Alex, arrives and is quite upset that no one notified her of Asa's death. Matthew wants to know who this woman is, so Alex tells him that she is his grandmother. Renee shakes her head at Matthew that she is not his grandmother. A claustrophobic Dorian tries frantically to get free of the wine cellar while Viki wonders what she ever did to deserve being confined with her. Viki doesn't believe Dorian when she confesses to killing Victor Lord and is relieved when Nigel rescues them. Everyone still grieves over the death of Asa. Even though Clint assures his brother that their dad was proud of him, Bo is angry at Asa for never showing him any respect. Bo drinks himself to oblivion and falls asleep in the barn with Matthew by his side. Nora finds them and covers them up. Nigel shares the secret of David Vickers being a Buchanan with Max who decides not to tell the family just yet. Having overheard, Alex begins to search for David. Clint pours a drink and sets it in front of Asa's picture on the mantle. Dorian hugs Clint as he cries over his father. Viki goes to the airport and buys a one-way ticket to anywhere."

        "Kevin: To Grandpa.",
        "Natalie: To Grandpa.",
        "Joey: To Grandpa.",
        "Jessica: To Grandpa.",
        "Natalie: So, who do we pick on first?",
        "Kevin: Oh, that's easy.",
        "Jessica: Ah -- hmm.",
        "Joey: Oh, no. Uh -- listen, guys, I have -- believe me -- nothing interesting to say.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no, no, no, Joey. That's not going to work with this group.",
        "Natalie: That's right, she's right. We want to hear all about your love life, so spill it. Come on. Come on, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh -- what was that for, Max? You know what -- don't answer that. I mean, you know -- things like this happen at funerals. People are upset, they're emotional, and -- and I know how you feel about Asa.",
        "Max: That kiss was not about Asa. It was about you, Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: Honey, how can you say that you don't deserve to be here?",
        "Sarah: Because it's true. I mean, I have been here for weeks, and I've never come to see Asa, not even once and when I finally decided to, it was too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: Oh. I want you to know I forgive you.",
        "Renee: For what?",
        "Alex: For not telling me about Asa. I know you didn't do it on purpose. You were just grief-stricken -- we all are.",
        "Matthew: Grandma? Who is this?",
        "Alex: I used to be your grandmother.",
        "[Music ends]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: Where's Bo now?",
        "Nora: Last I saw him, he was heading out for a walk with a bottle of bourbon.",
        "Lindsay: We should go find him.",
        "Nora: Clint went after him. He'll handle it.",
        "Lindsay: Rex said that he was really concerned about Bo's state of mind.",
        "Nora: No offense, Lindsay, but Bo's state of mind right now is none of your concern.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Is destroying Pa's favorite old hat going to do anything for anybody? Bo, what is the matter with you? Why are you so angry at Pa?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Hello! Hello, can anybody hear me? We're locked in here! Someone, open this door right now!",
        "Viki: Why is this happening to me?",
        "Dorian: To you? I'm the one who's claustrophobic.",
        "Viki: Yeah? Right on cue. Hmm.",
        "Dorian: And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Viki: Oh, Dorian, come on -- we've been over this routine countless times. It's like some sort of cosmic joke by now. We get stuck somewhere together, we fight like cats and dogs, and then somebody rescues us. I don't know about you, but I find this very old. There is nothing left to fight about.",
        "Dorian: I wouldn't be so sure of that.",
        "Viki: Of what?",
        "Dorian: Maybe -- maybe this was supposed to happen. Maybe the universe meant for us to have it out, once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Max: You're so beautiful -- and so difficult, but undeniably beautiful.",
        "Blair: And you are still so smooth.",
        "Max: I missed you. I missed being with you.",
        "Blair: Now, come on, Max. You're telling me there's not one woman down in Argentina that wants to keep you warm at night?",
        "Max: Nobody special. Nobody like you, but then there is nobody like you, Blair Cramer. You're one of a kind. I just don't want to lose you -- not again.",
        "Blair: What are you saying, Max?",
        "Max: I'm leaving to go back home tomorrow. I want you to come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: If Bo's in trouble, I want to help.",
        "Nora: The situation is under control, Lindsay. You can go.",
        "Lindsay: I'd feel better if I could stay until I know he's all right.",
        "Nora: Well, I'd feel better if you would go.",
        "Lindsay: The last time I looked, this isn't your house. Bo's not your husband or even your boyfriend.",
        "Nora: I live here, and Bo's the father of my child. And to be perfectly honest, Lindsay, you have a way of turning everything into the Lindsay show and that's not what Bo needs right now.",
        "Lindsay: I would never do anything to upset him.",
        "Nora: You wouldn't mean to, but you're Lindsay Rappaport -- it just goes with the territory. Now, if you'll excuse me --",
        "Lindsay: You have no authority. I'm here because Rex asked me to be and because Bo is my friend.",
        "Nora: Bo is your friend?",
        "Lindsay: Every bit as much as he is yours. Bo and I are friends and that's that.",
        "Alex: Are you two still fighting over Bo? I guess some things never change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "Clint: You might want to take it easy on the bourbon.",
        "Bo: I got a good idea, big brother. Why don't you grieve your way, and I'll grieve mine?",
        "Clint: You're not grieving -- you're brooding. You have been ever since we got the news. I know that you and Pa had your differences. But the man was our father. Now he's dead and gone. For God's sake, show him some respect.",
        "Bo: Why should I show Asa Buchanan any respect? He never showed me any.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Actually, I think the universe has more important things to do than to set up yet another pointless grudge match between us.",
        "Dorian: \"Pointless\"? Hmm. I'm not so sure it's pointless. And how can you be so certain that we don't have something really important to discuss?",
        "Viki: Well, the thing is, I don't want to discuss \"anything\" with you! My children are upstairs, two of whom I never get to see!",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Viki: And their grandfather just died! I should be spending today with them, not you. Hello, hello!",
        "Dorian: You're not my favorite person, either. But there really is something very important that I need to say to you.",
        "Viki: Oh, I doubt it.",
        "Dorian: You better hear me out, Victoria, because I've kept this to myself far too long.",
        "Viki: For God sakes, I really don't \"care\" about what goes on between you and Clint, and I wish to hell you would leave me out of it!",
        "Dorian: This has nothing to do with Clint. This is about your father, Victor.",
        "Viki: \"Victor\"? Dorian, we've covered that subject ad nauseam!",
        "Dorian: But we haven't covered the fact that I'm the one who killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: Let me tell you something. Asa was crazy about you. And I know that he would understand that you didn't get a chance to see him before he died. I didn't get a chance to see him, neither did Kevin and Joey. And C.J. --",
        "[Cord sighs]",
        "Cord: C.J. couldn't even make it here for this today. But I do know one thing -- I know that Asa knew exactly how much we all loved him.",
        "Sarah: But that's what's wrong, dad. When I finally did decide to come by, it was only so I could sucker him into overruling you and Grandpa about the trust fund thing. Asa was so good to me. He believed in my music. I loved him so much.",
        "Sarah: And I never got a chance to tell him that. In the end, all I cared about was the money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joey: And I'm just trying to pick them all up. She throws a drink in my face, and I'm not sure what she's screaming at me, but by the looks of the people around us, it wasn't good. It was not -- yeah -- the love connection I was hoping for.",
        "Jessica: You're -- no, no, you, you're making it up. You're making it up.",
        "Joey: No, Kevin, back me up.",
        "Kevin: Hmm. I was there, I was there. If Zane wasn't sick, Kelly would be here to vouch for the fact that we tried to stop the insanity, but we were just laughing too hard.",
        "Jessica: Oh, you are truly, terribly pathetic.",
        "Natalie: Well, at least he tried!",
        "Joey: Well, thank you, thank you. Now, Kevin's pathetic.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, it is pathetic.",
        "Jessica: Easy, there.",
        "Kevin: Oh!",
        "Joey: So, I would like to hear a little bit about your love life.",
        "Jessica: Well, what about it? I am a very happy newlywed, and I have a gorgeous husband and a beautiful but fussy daughter that my husband is understanding enough to take care of so I can hang out with you guys.",
        "Joey: Well, that's a nice try, but what about your love life?",
        "Jessica: Oh, let's just say it was a long time coming, and next.",
        "Joey: All right.",
        "Natalie: Ok, ok -- new topic. What do we all think about Dad dating Dorian Lord?",
        "Kevin: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Kevin: Whoa.",
        "Natalie: What, bad subject?",
        "Kevin: Oh, I don't know -- ask Dustin Hoffman over here.",
        "Natalie: Huh?",
        "[Kevin chuckles]",
        "Jessica: You didn't know that Dorian and Joey were an item back in the day?",
        "Natalie: Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, I think I blocked that out, like the memory of a car accident.",
        "Joey: Ah, it wasn't like that.",
        "Kevin: Yes, it was.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Kevin: Yes, it was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Are you insane?",
        "Dorian: No. You cornered that market a long time ago. Think about it. Why would I lie?",
        "Viki: Why would you lie? Oh, I can think of about a million reasons right off the top of my head.",
        "Dorian: Name one.",
        "Viki: I am not having this conversation with you.",
        "Dorian: You know, I would think that you'd be thrilled that I'm letting you off the hook.",
        "Viki: I don't want to be let off the hook, ok? I accepted a long time ago that I murdered my father.",
        "Dorian: Except you didn't -- I did.",
        "Viki: Actually, Dorian, neither one of us did. You can't have forgotten his triumphant return from the grave a few years ago.",
        "Dorian: If it really was him.",
        "Viki: Oh, for heaven's sakes! You know, I know that everything in your life is a competition. But I cannot believe you seriously expect me to argue over who killed Victor and that you want to win! You want to rehash Victor, you go right ahead. You're on your own -- I want no part of it. I refuse to define my life by how it relates to yours.",
        "Dorian: Oh? And how do you define your life?",
        "Viki: Excuse me?",
        "Dorian: We've just been to Asa's funeral. We've heard speeches, eulogies. We -- we've heard all about his dreams, hopes, and accomplishments, a virtual tour of what defined that man's life, so I'm asking you again -- what defines yours, Viki? Because from where I'm standing, it looks pretty damn empty to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Of course Pa respected you.",
        "Bo: How do you figure that? Huh? All he ever tried to do was show me up -- first, women, you know? He'd always try to go after all of them just to show that, you -- to prove that he could take them. And then when that got old, all of a sudden it became my jobs. I ran security for Buchanan Enterprises, worldwide, but not good enough -- no. And then there was the football team -- no, not good enough. The TV station -- no, nothing I ever did was ever good enough for that old man!",
        "Clint: That is so far from the truth.",
        "Bo: Oh, gee, Clint, come on. Stop trying to turn him into some kind of a saint now just because he's dead.",
        "Clint: And don't you make him out to be the devil.",
        "Bo: He mocked everything I tried to do -- everything! I became the commissioner of police, so what do you think he did? He -- he made it his mission to try to break the law just as many times as he possibly could. Then I'd -- I'd get in his face, he'd turn around and he'd laugh in my face! Why? Because the Buchanans don't have to play by any rules. Because the Buchanans are above the law, the Buchanans are royalty!",
        "Clint: You don't even know what you're saying.",
        "Bo: You don't know what you're talking about! You don't! Listen to me, big brother -- you face it! The job that I do right now, I'd do it for one dollar a year -- one! Why? I love that job! You know what he did? He laughed at it! He laughed at it all the time -- you want to know why? He was embarrassed by it!",
        "Clint: That's bull.",
        "Bo: Ah.",
        "Clint: And you -- you got to know that. After all these years, you've got to see that. There's a reason Pa was so hard on you -- it's because he was jealous.",
        "Bo: Of \"what\"?",
        "Clint: Of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Max, I can't just hop on the next flight down to South America with you.",
        "Max: Why not?",
        "Blair: Well -- I've got kids, Jack and Starr, for starters.",
        "Max: So bring them. Why not? They'll love it -- your kids, my kids. It'll be fun. Yeah, we'll see how it goes and, you know, maybe in a few months, you can come back down again, make it a regular thing.",
        "Blair: Like a timeshare?",
        "Max: Will you -- I'm trying to be serious here, ok? I miss you. I think we should give this a shot, you know? We'll take it slow. We'll, you know, get to know each other and see how things work out.",
        "Blair: I don't -- I don't know. It -- it's -- it's --",
        "Max: It's right. Feels that way to me. How does it feel to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: Asa's in a better place, although, this is a very nice place as places go. But this should be a day we put aside our petty differences and focus on what's really important. I know that I missed the funeral, but have they had the reading of the will yet?",
        "Renee: I knew you were dressed for Halloween. You always came as a vulture.",
        "Alex: Oh. Poor Renee -- you must be prostrate with grief. Now, don't fight, not today. I'm going to roam around my old house. I want to feel closer to my Asa.",
        "Renee: Excuse me. I better warn security.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Mom?",
        "Nora: Yes, love?",
        "Matthew: Where's Dad?",
        "Nora: He went for a walk with your Uncle Clint -- you know, brother stuff.",
        "Lindsay: Matthew? I'm really sorry about what happened to your grandfather. And I want you to know that if you or your dad need anything, you are both welcome to call me. You have my number.",
        "Matthew: Ok.",
        "Lindsay: Goodbye, Nora.",
        "Nora: Lindsay. You're leaving?",
        "Lindsay: You're right -- I don't belong here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Pa's jealous of me? Huh -- you're drunk. Yes, Clint -- you're drunk! You're drunker than me!",
        "Clint: The reason Pa went after you the way he did was to prove that he could beat you, but he couldn't. Listen to me. You were the only horse Asa Buchanan could never break. Bo, he loved you. I think he loved you the most because you took after him, blazed your own trails just like he did. Difference was, you didn't take any shortcuts like he did, and by God, he hated that -- hated it. And yet, he was so proud of it too.",
        "Bo: Pa was proud? Of me?",
        "Clint: I know he was because you became the man he always wished he could be. He did. He loved you, Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: How dare you say my life is empty.",
        "Dorian: I have found happiness, at long last. What about you?",
        "Viki: My life is very full, thank you very much.",
        "Dorian: Oh, is it? With what? I'm asking you a question, Viki. What is your life so full of?",
        "Viki: Oh, brother. Ok, fine, Dorian -- let's start with four children.",
        "Dorian: Right, two sons who you hardly ever see, two daughters whose lives are so busy that -- what else?",
        "Viki: I have a newspaper!",
        "Dorian: Which runs itself. What else?",
        "Viki: This is ridiculous.",
        "Dorian: Ah -- nothing else.",
        "Viki: No! Gracious! I mean -- I -- I have -- I have my home, I have my family, I have my -- my paper. I have my work at the hospital. I have --",
        "Dorian: And what about love?",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Dorian: Is there any love?",
        "Viki: Well, I am not pining for Clint, if that's what you're getting at.",
        "Dorian: Maybe you are, maybe you're not. But let's just put Clint aside for the moment.",
        "Viki: Just make your point, would you?",
        "Dorian: My point is that you only have one life to live. Asa's life is over, but yours isn't, not yet. You've had a successful career -- husbands, children. What's next? What are you going to do with the rest of your life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Max, I can't go to Argentina with you. I mean, it's a lovely offer, and I'm touched and flattered but --",
        "Max: Oh, oh -- \"flattered\"? Woman says that, it's the kiss of death.",
        "Blair: No, it's -- it's just complicated. Hey -- I will always care about you, you know that. But --",
        "Max: You're still in love with Todd?",
        "Blair: He's -- he's in my blood --",
        "Max: Oh.",
        "Blair: And always will be.",
        "Max: Ahem. So, you would rather be miserable with him than happy with me?",
        "Blair: Sorry.",
        "Max: No, no -- no, please. Huh. I understand -- don't have to explain to me. I've been there, believe me. Uh -- you know, I was -- I was just caught up in the moment there, you know, with what happened to Asa and -- and being back here after so long and seeing you -- you know, what can I say? Todd is a very lucky guy, and I hope you two work it out, I really do. You deserve to be happy.",
        "Blair: So do you, Max. So do you.",
        "Blair: I'll be rooting for you.",
        "Max: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Bo? Clint? Are you down here?",
        "Clint: Yeah, um -- we're here.",
        "Nora: Um -- huh -- that was pretty intense, huh?",
        "Bo: Yeah -- ahem. It was a lot of people in there.",
        "Nora: Alex Olanov is there.",
        "Clint: You're kidding.",
        "Nora: That woman has got an infallible nose for drama.",
        "Clint: She in one of those crazy outfits?",
        "Nora: Do you remember when she wore the gold turkey on her head when she married Asa? How are you guys doing down here?",
        "Clint: We're all right. We just needed to get away from the chaos.",
        "Nora: Yeah. I think it might be a good idea if you start thinking about putting your faces in up at the house. Poor Renee, she's just --",
        "Clint: Yeah, you're right. It's not fair to leave her there alone.",
        "Nora: Matthew's been asking for you, Bo.",
        "Bo: Ahem -- I want to talk to him, but I think I'm going to stay down here just a little bit longer, ok?",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just don't want to -- I don't feel like diving back into all that right now, but I'll be up in just -- just a little while.",
        "Clint: All right. We'll expect you in a bit.",
        "Bo: Hey, Clint?",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Bo: Thanks.",
        "Nora: Hey, is he really going to be ok?",
        "Clint: He will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Please, please, \"please\" just leave me alone! My God, are you incapable of minding your own business?",
        "Dorian: Fine, don't listen to what I have to say.",
        "Viki: Believe me, I'm not. I mean, where is everybody? I told Nigel I was going to be here -- somebody must be missing us.",
        "Dorian: But could I say one more thing?",
        "Viki: Is it about my father?",
        "Dorian: Maybe.",
        "Viki: Go ahead.",
        "[Key turns in lock]",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Nigel: Oh, Mrs. Davidson, I'm so very sorry. I should've warned you about this key.",
        "Dorian: Thank heavens you remembered that she was down here.",
        "Nigel: The two of you were in here together? Oh, dear.",
        "Viki: It's all right, I'm fine. Let's get this champagne upstairs so we can honor Asa's wishes.",
        "Dorian: But, Viki?",
        "Viki: Dorian, I think it's enough for today, don't you? In fact, I think it's enough forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, but I just can't picture you as Dorian Lord's boy toy.",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, it was quite a picture, especially after Mom found out, right?",
        "Kevin: Right.",
        "Natalie: Ah! I can only imagine!",
        "Kevin: I'm telling you, Joey was priceless and clueless. Matter of fact, I think he was shirtless most of the time.",
        "[Natalie laughs]",
        "Joey: Oh.",
        "Kevin: [As Benjamin Braddock] \"Oh, Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?\"",
        "Joey: Ok. I think it's somebody else's turn on the hot seat.",
        "Jessica: No, no, Joey, come on! You give us so much great material. We could talk about you and Dorian for hours!",
        "Joey: Oh, that's great. How about a new topic, and by the way, you all suck.",
