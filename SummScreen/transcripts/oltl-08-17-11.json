        "Blair, T\u00e9a, and Tomas wait impatiently for word from John McBain about the Todds. T\u00e9a brings up Blair kissing Todd. T\u00e9a throws Blair out. T\u00e9a admits to Tomas that she overreacted. Irene Manning tells Viki and the two Todds that one of them is her son Victor and that she went to great lengths to make them identical, including giving Victor Todd's memories and scar so he could do the work that the agency needed. Viki wonders why they now look so different. Irene explains that when Mitch Lawrence thought Todd was dead after leaving him in a cave, she realized that sending Victor looking like Todd would be a death sentence. She says she gave Victor the face of Mitch's brother Walker so he could get to know Viki, Blair, and Starr as Walker before approaching them as Todd. Viki tells Irene that she has scarred her two sons in so many ways that the least she can do is tell them who is who. She reveals that Current Todd is her son Victor and Original Todd is her other son Todd. \"Victor\" says she is a liar and orders John McBain to arrest her. John takes her away. Viki tells \"Victor\" that she is sorry and he tells her not to be; he knows who he is. Todd (Victor) goes home to T\u00e9a. she asks him what Irene told him.",
        "Natalie asks John for the tape in the evidence room so she can have Madame Delphina try to determine what was on it or who erased it.

Delphina sees a sharp object and the have-a-seat guy. Natalie rushes in with the tape and interrupts Delphina's psychic connection. Delphina says the tape is too hot to touch, many people have touched it, and the information that was on it could change lives, but she doesn't know what was on the tape. The psychiatrist that Marty murdered contacts Delphina and says she was robbed. She gets a message from another spirit that tells her Todd knows. Aubrey wants to know why Cutter's ears pricked up when Rex mentioned the spotted pony. He mentions the Buchanan stables and suggests she put the move on Rex. Cutter eavesdrops on Rex's conversation with David. David notices the spotted pony in the newspaper. Rex asks him if it means anything to him. David tells Rex that when he was a kid, the kid that spat on him every day had a spotted pony named Rex. Rex knows David made that story up and tells him the Buchanan creed is \"Family first.\" David reveals that he may or may not have been at a place for discerning gentlemen in Anchorage KY called the Spotted Pony, but asks that Rex not tell Dorian. Rex asks Delphina if she can pick up anything about the Spotted Pony strip club. She says she can't but that it is no coincidence that he ran into David and David recognized the name.",

Dorian explains that she is going to Washington DC as interim senator because a scandal is forcing the current one to resign. Kelly tells Dorian that she is going back to London to be near her son, Zane and Joey is going with her. Dorian tells Kelly that she hasn't told David yet but she knows he will be thrilled.

        "Irene: Eventually, I had transferred all of my son Todd's memories to my son Victor. Now they were truly identical, except for one thing.",
        "Irene's voice: Victor...you have been with me every day of your life, and I cherish that bond. But now that bond has to be broken. I'm so sorry. But this has to be perfect, right down to the last detail. Forgive me, my son.",
        "T.M.: If you went to all that trouble...to make us look identical, why do we have different faces?",
        "Viki: Irene, which of these men is Victor, and which is Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Look, I don't want to give you one more thing to deal with. I know you've got a lot going on with the whole Todd Manning thing, but I really want to get this tape out of the evidence room. I think that Delphina can use it to figure out what was erased off the tape.",
        "John: Delphina? Come on. You can do better than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Aah!",
        "Delphina: Shh! Aw, that's sweet. She's with her baby daddy.",
        "Roxy: Delphina! Natty and I were just talking about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Do you hear yourself? I mean, you. Forensics Natalie, are gonna hire a psychic to try to figure out what's on a blank tape?",
        "Natalie: I really trust Delphina. She helped me when Liam was missing.",
        "John: I thought you were done with all that.",
        "Natalie: Like I said before, Marty tried to kill me for whatever was on that tape. Gigi had the tape when she was found. There's something important on there, and I need to know what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You are so right. Natty's with Brody. She said she was gonna see him later.",
        "Delphina: To get the tape?",
        "Roxy: That is so freaky. You know about the tape?",
        "Delphina: You mean that it was erased? Yeah, I know all about that.",
        "Roxy: Is that what you're doing here?",
        "Delphina: Well, it's not like I'm here to get my roots done. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm getting to it. So. Who do you think erased that tape?",
        "Roxy: I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure. Gigi was the last person who had it, so maybe she erased it. I'm so heartsick about this, she was Rex's soul mate. Now Gigi's gone to the grave, and everything that's on the tape has gone with her.",
        "Delphina: Not necessarily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Thanks, Vickers. You made me miss Gigi.",
        "David: You got your papers all over my headshots.",
        "Rex: You got your headshots all over my papers.",
        "David: Get these out of my face. Wait a second. The spotted pony?",
        "Rex: Yeah. Why? Does that mean something to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: What does that look mean?",
        "Cutter: What look?",
        "Aubrey: That look. When I mentioned that Rex said something about the spotted pony, your ears perked up.",
        "Cutter: My ears perked up?",
        "Aubrey: Yes, your ears. What does that mean to you?",
        "Cutter: Why should \"Spotted Pony\" mean anything to me?",
        "Aubrey: You tell me.",
        "Rex: David, if \"Spotted Pony\" means something to you, you gotta tell me. It's a matter of life and death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Aunt Dorian. I'm glad you're here. I have something to tell you.",
        "Dorian: Kelly, I'm glad you're here. I've got something to tell you.",
        "Kelly: Ok, well, you go first.",
        "Dorian: No, you go first.",
        "Kelly: Come on. I insist.",
        "Dorian: All right. I'm leaving Llanview.",
        "Kelly: Shut the front door. I am leaving Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Either of you gonna tell me what that was about? You're gonna wear out the carpet.",
        "Blair: Look. You walk in here and you tell us that Todd's dead mother is alive.",
        "T\u00e9a: And that she's somehow responsible for the...",
        "Blair: You just can't expect us...",
        "T\u00e9a: To just sit here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: These men. Your sons. You have scarred them in so many ways. The least you can do is tell them who they are, and do it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I've got this hole in my memory.",
        "John: And you think that a tape can fill it in.",
        "Natalie: We know that Marty took Liam and the tape to your place, but we don't know why. And we know that I ran into Marty on the roof. We know that she went nuts and pushed me off. I just know that that tape, it has something important on it, especially because--especially because Marty kept saying that she was responsible for breaking us up.",
        "John: Marty's gone.",
        "Natalie: I know she's gone. I know that we've all moved on. But don't you want to know why I needed to see you, especially since Marty was willing to kill me to keep that from happening?",
        "John: Ok. Take the tape. Just make sure you log it back in when you're done.",
        "Natalie: Thank you. And you'll fill me in with the Todd Manning thing?",
        "John: Later. Good luck with all that.",
        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "John: Don't let the voodoo lady string you along, all right?",
        "Natalie: It's worth it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: I have a convention in Atlantic City next month and this will knock them out.",
        "Roxy: Hey, baby, I got a set with stars on them.",
        "Delphina: Sold. Ooh, sorry about the cancellation.",
        "Roxy: What cancellation?",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Roxy: Excuse me just a second.",
        "[Ringing]",
        "Roxy: Foxy Roxy's hair haven. Can I help you? Oh, yeah, Midge. Oh, yeah, that's no problem. You can come next week. You are good.",
        "Delphina: She cancelled.",
        "Roxy: Just like you said. Listen, honey, I gotta tell you, I am very happy about Natty calling you for Rex. Because that information that you got from Gigi? The spotted pony stuff? Gotta know it's important.",
        "Delphina: It is important, and to a hell of a lot of people. Not just Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: I know you, Cutter. You know something about spotted ponies.",
        "Cutter: I believe the technical term is appaloosas.",
        "Aubrey: Funny.",
        "Cutter: Look, all I know is Rex Balsom doesn't seem like the horse kind of guy. Well, maybe got the Buchanan spread now, he's taking an interest. Buchanans had stables, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: And that's why spotless ponies can run faster. Speaking of which, why did you run out of here like a crazy person? Have something to do with Gigi?",
        "Rex: Yes, I saw her. She was standing right there. I could've caught her, but you got in my way.",
        "David: Rex, I am really sorry about that, but didn't your fianc\u00e9e bite the dust?",
        "Rex: I know it sounds crazy, but I swear to you. I keep seeing her.",
        "David: You see dead people. I should've been in that picture.",
        "Rex: No, you're too old, and this isn't a movie, David, ok? It's real. I've seen her.",
        "David: Dorian is a real sucker for those ghost romantic movies. She says when I die, I'm gonna come back to her. She should really check out that clause about till death do us part.",
        "Rex: The point is Natalie had me talk to this psychic.",
        "David: Delphina? She's a genius. I went to her to see how I was going to become rich and famous. As soon as I walked in, she said, \"Have a seat.\" Have- a-seat. The hemorrhoid commercial that made me famous. It launched my career.",
        "Rex: Yeah. The only clue that Delphina gave me was \"Spotted Pony.\" You see? You know something.",
        "David: Rex, I assure you. I know nothing.",
        "Rex: David, I am begging you. You gotta help me.",
        "David: All right, keep pressing me. I know the name.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: What do you mean you're leaving Llanview?",
        "Dorian: You just said you're leaving.",
        "Kelly: I'm not gonna say one more word about it until you tell me what's up with you leaving La Boulaie, your job, your family.",
        "Dorian: Job. Job. I have just been offered the job of a lifetime. It's a promotion of sorts.",
        "Kelly: Ok, but you're mayor. It's an elected office. How are you possibly promoted?",
        "Dorian: The governor just called and he says that the country needs me, and I can't say no to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What's important is that we brought Irene back. We can interrogate her and force her to tell us why there are two men claiming to be Todd Manning.",
        "Blair: So John's with Irene right this very minute.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: He's at Llanfair. Viki's there, too, and the guy with the scar on his face.",
        "Blair: Then Todd must be there, too, because when I saw him before, he said he was gonna go over to his sister's and see her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Where are you going?",
        "Blair: I'm gonna go over to Viki's. No. If they're trying to figure out who the two Todds are, I should be there.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I should be there, too.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No one's going anywhere. Listen to me!",
        "[Blair and T\u00e9a talking at once]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: McBain and I were both shot at, all right? We were almost killed. So nobody's going anywhere, got it? Just be patient. We will know when McBain knows.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: Lieutenant McBain. I thought this was to be a private family meeting.",
        "John: Don't mind me. Then again, you are in police custody and every word you've said has been recorded.",
        "Irene: For all the good it will do you.",
        "Todd: Can we just get on with it, please?",
        "Irene: Of course. As I mentioned, Victor was a very quick study, and in no time at all, he knew all about his brother Todd--his life, his loves, his history. And with his new scar, he looked exactly like him.",
        "T.M.'s voice: I killed a man by accident. His name is Suede. Luna gave me this scar.",
        "Irene's voice: Perfect. Of course, I expect nothing less than that from you, Victor.",
        "Irene: It was time to send Victor in, as Todd, to do the work the agency needed. However, there was one slight, little problem. Mitch Laurence. He'd left Todd for dead in that tomb. If Mitch were to find Victor very much alive and looking like Todd, he'd kill him. I couldn't let that happen. I needed to find a way to neutralize Mitch. And then I stumbled on the perfect solution.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I don't understand. Where are you going?",
        "Dorian: Washington, D.C.",
        "Kelly: D.C.? Why?",
        "Dorian: Because when the governor called, he told me that my party's senator has gotten into a scandal. Sexting. I didn't ask for the details. He's resigning, and the governor asked me to take over.",
        "Kelly: Ha ha ha! O.M.G., you're gonna be a U.S. senator. Give me high-five.",
        "Dorian: Ok! Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I knew you recognized the name. Now, what does \"Spotted Pony\" mean?",
        "David: Well, now, I'm only guessing here. You may or may not know this, but an actor's face can never lie. It interprets. It channels. You may be on to something.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "David: That look of recognition you saw on my face, it can only mean one thing. Spotted pony. My best friend when I was a boy.",
        "Rex: So you had a spotted pony?",
        "David: No, but the kid who spit on me at recess did. I loved that pony. His name was...Rex.",
        "Rex: That's my name. Stop lying to me, idiot!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delphina: I'm getting something. Uh-huh. Yeah. Wait a minute. I see it. I'm seeing a pair of scissors.",
        "Roxy: Hello. We're in a hair salon.",
        "Delphina: No, no, something sharp, like a knife.",
        "Roxy: Like a knife?",
        "Delphina: Mm.",
        "Roxy: Maybe a butcher shop?",
        "Delphina: That's weird. Why am I seeing the have-a-seat guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Are you calling me an idiot?",
        "Rex: No, I'm just--stop being an idiot.",
        "David: Oh, ok. I'll be at the bar waiting for my agent.",
        "Rex: No, no, no. Come on, David. We are cousins. You gotta help me.",
        "David: Are you threatening me with physical violence? I'll have you know that I've seen more \"Kung Fu\" movies than any other leading man I know. I've conducted a survey in my own head, and apparently my death stare is legendary.",
        "Rex: Well, that's great, David, but will it work against the Buchanan creed?",
        "David: The what?",
        "Rex: You're telling me you don't know about the Buchanan creed? Passed down from Asa? Upheld by the Buchanans? \"Family comes first.\"",
        "David: There's a creed? No one told me about the creed.",
        "Rex: How will your pa react when I tell him you wouldn't help me?",
        "David: You'd go to Pa?",
        "Rex: You mean Uncle Bo? Of course, I would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: You weren't thinking about Rex or the Buchanan stables when I mentioned \"Spotted Pony.\" You recognized the name.",
        "Cutter: Aubrey, we've got a golden opportunity here. Rex is clearly losing his mind over Gigi. He's lonely, he's single, he's rich--",
        "Aubrey: I don't care about any of that.",
        "Cutter: Since when?",
        "Aubrey: Since right now. I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. I fell in love with Joey and I lost him because I had gone after him for the wrong reasons.",
        "Cutter: Maybe he didn't really love you after all.",
        "Aubrey: Thanks, Cutter.",
        "Cutter: Where are you going?",
        "Aubrey: Not after Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I can't do this! I can't just sit here when everything's going on at Viki's. I'm going over there.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you can kiss my husband again?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Excuse me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Your girlfriend came on to my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Viki, this is-- this is nuts. We're just gonna stand here and listen to some strange woman? What if this is all lies?",
        "T.M.: We should at least hear it first, don't you think?",
        "Irene: Thank you. I can assure you that everything I am telling you is the truth. Why would I lie? The agency has been exposed. There are no more secrets.",
        "Viki: Then how did you neutralize Mitch Laurence?",
        "Irene: The solution was staring me right in the face. Literally. There had to be a way to fool Mitch and give Victor more time to become Todd. I'd found the answer.",
        "T.M.: What are you saying about Walker Laurence?",
        "Irene: You have to admit, it was an inspired idea. I could fool Mitch into believing that his long-lost brother had resurfaced, and Victor would have a chance to know Viki, Blair, and Starr-- as Walker--before he had to approach them as Todd.",
        "T.M.: And Victor just went along with this?",
        "Irene: Well, I assured him that he was still going to get what he was entitled to. He just had to be someone else first.",
        "Todd: You said someone else. What are you saying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I did not come on to Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: You kissed him!",
        "Blair: It was a test. I was just trying to figure out who the real deal was.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So that's why the two of you were tearing at each other when I showed up?",
        "Blair: Your sister is overreacting.",
        "T\u00e9a: Let's see if Tom\u00e1s agrees, all right? While you were out risking your life, Blair was making out with my husband.",
        "Blair: It was a kiss!",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, is that all it was?",
        "Blair: Why are you being-- why are you so insecure?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why are you so desperate?",
        "Blair: I don't want your husband!",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh! Then maybe you don't make out with him.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: All right, enough!",
        "Blair: She started it.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm ending it. Get the hell out of my house, Blair. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You are not gonna go to my pa.",
        "Rex: Sure I am.",
        "David: You wouldn't dare, and you do not want to me to give you the death stare.",
        "Rex: Try me.",
        "David: Wow, your death stare's really good. Hey, my agent's coming over here. Do you want me to introduce you to her?",
        "Rex: I am warning you, David. I will go to your pa if you don't tell me what you know about the spotted pony.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: What does David Vickers have to do with Gigi or Rex or spotted ponies or scissors or knives? I mean, how is that gonna help Rexy get over Gigi's death?",
        "Delphina: Shh! I'm getting something. It's coming. It's...it's...",
        "Natalie: Guess what I got?",
        "Delphina: Gone. It's gone. Sorry, Roxy. The spotted pony has galloped away. For now.",
        "David: There's this place called The Spotted Pony, where I may or may not have been. But I prefer you not tell Dorian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: The governor said he needed me, and how can I say no?",
        "Kelly: Ok. You know, you're right, you're right, but-- now, correct me if I'm wrong. When you ran for mayor as a lesbian and then married David, which might not count as a flip-flop in some circles--",
        "Dorian: I am proud of my record on marriage equality. I am. I'm also proud of the fact that I've created jobs in Llanview, I've strengthened the infrastructure, and boy, did I turn the public school system around, and I am sure that has not escaped the notice of the governor.",
        "Kelly: Well, you know what? All I can say is you go, Senator Lord.",
        "Dorian: Senator Lord! Senator Lord. Oh, oh, oh. That is gonna stick it to Viki.",
        "Kelly: So when do you leave?",
        "Dorian: The governor said as soon as possible.",
        "Kelly: I'm proud of you.",
        "Dorian: Oh! Ok, enough of that. Now. Ahem. What's the story behind you leaving Llanview?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I can't believe that you are actually kicking me out of your house.",
        "[T\u00e9a speaking Spanish]",
        "[Tom\u00e1s speaking Spanish]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: A little space might be a good idea.",
        "Blair: Ok. Fine. You know what? I'm gonna leave if I'm not welcome. But please, would you do me the common courtesy to give me a call if this Irene woman decides to enlighten us about Todd one and Todd two?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why don't you just try your taste test again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What exactly are you saying?",
        "Irene: You are my son, my beloved Victor. And you are Todd.",
        "Todd: That's a lie. I know who I am. I'm Todd. See, you're a liar.",
        "Viki: The story is very far-fetched.",
        "Irene: But true, nonetheless.",
        "Todd: I don't remember any of it. Why is that?",

        "T\u00e9a: You're right. It's not her fault. I was just attacked--or I did attack her. I don't care if she kisses Todd or not. It's not like I'm threatened. I mean, he loves me and I-- I love him, too. It's just-- what if he's not Todd? Hmm? Then what, huh? What happens to my marriage?",

        "Todd: That's not my name.",
        "Irene: Bravo. I am really proud of myself. It was a brilliant plan. Victor had months and months as Walker Laurence before he had to be convincing as Todd. Blair fell in love with him, his children fell in love with him, all the while thinking he was Walker. And soon, Todd was free to surface. Of course, we couldn't have him announce himself. We let one of his loved ones do it for him. He started dropping hints, knowing that Starr was smart enough to figure it out. All Victor had to do was play his part. It was the perfect plan.",
        "Todd: No. It's a lie. It's all lies.",
        "Irene: Of course, I don't expect you to remember any of this, darling. Just know you were magnificent. You became Todd, and you helped the agency with all kinds of nasty, little jobs.",
        "John: Well. I don't know about your story, lady, but you are a piece of work.",

        "Delphina: Huh. What about it, Doc? Cough it up, huh? You're kidding. She's saying doctor-client confidentiality.",
