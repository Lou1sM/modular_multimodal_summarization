        "There is a real dilemma for all of Todd's \"loved-ones\" in determining which of the two Todds is the \"real\" one. Original Todd goes to talk to Starr and informs her all of what Irene revealed to himself, to current Todd and to Viki about how he is the real Todd and current Todd has only been \"programmed\" to be him. Although she later leaves when current Todd asks her to \"come home\", she seems to be bonding with original Todd and lets him put Hope to bed after she leaves. Meanwhile, current Todd is able to \"reassure\" Tea and Dani by telling them what Irene revealed. We know, however, that she's revealed that he's \"Victor Jr.\" while original Todd is the real Todd. When Starr returns to current Todd's home after hearing the \"truth\" from original Todd, she is very alarmed to find out that it appears that current Todd has lied to her stepmother, half sister and brother and they are unaware. Blair admits that she still has \"mixed feelings\" about whether to move on and reveals she may trust original Todd when she overhears him telling the story to Hope about his romance with Blair when they were young.",
        "Rex somehow believes that he may find some information about The Spotted Pony and can get some answers about why he keeps \"seeing\" Gigi. So he is ready to fly to the place he's found out about in Kentucky and asks Natalie to come with him. We also see that Cutter and Rama both know a secret regarding The Spotted pony in KY that could get Cutter into a lot of trouble if Rex ever finds out. Meanwhile, Brody is very worried that Delphina might reveal to Natalie that she knows that John is Liam's father and not himself. And when Natalie reveals that she heard that Todd knows the answer to the \"unanswered questions\", and Brody is also aware of that, he is determined to prevent Natalie from finding out that he is not her baby's father."

        "Brody: Come on, little man. You ought to be wiped. I've tried everything. Why are you still awake? Huh? You as worried as I am? Don't be. I'll make sure Todd doesn't tell anyone I'm not your dad.",

        "Dani: You mean you know? We know who's who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Saying you're my dad doesn't make it true.",
        "Todd: I'm not just saying it. And it really is true. It's a proven fact. I am your father. I'm Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: What took you so long?",
        "Rama: I was in the middle of a romantic dinner with my husband. Why are you bothering me?",
        "Cutter: Oh, you know.",
        "Rama: No. I assure you, I have no idea.",
        "Cutter: You sold me out.",
        "Rama: Nobody wants to buy you, Cutter. How could I sell you out?",
        "Cutter: You told Rex Balsom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You know? Remember and write yourself a note, jar of change in my.. hey jet ready. Tonight. Yeah. Right away. I have to go to Anchorage. No, not Alaska. Kentucky.",

        "Jack: No, wait, wait!",
        "Shane: What?",
        "Jack: Just give me two minutes.",
        "Shane: What do you want?",
        "Jack: School's starting in a few weeks.",
        "Shane: So?",
        "Jack: Are you coming back to Llanview High?",
        "Shane: What, are you that desperate to get--",
        "Jack: No, that's not what I meant.",
        "Shane: That's not what you do? Jack, that's all you do.",
        "Jack: No, not anymore. I just want to let you know, if you come back to school, no one's gonna bother you anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, my goodness! What are you doing up so late?",
        "Brody: He was missing his favorite redhead.",
        "Natalie: Aw! I'm so sorry, baby.",
        "Brody: Well, so was I.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I'm so sorry. I totally forgot I was supposed to meet you here.",
        "Brody: That's ok. Were you at the station?",
        "Natalie: No. Actually, I had a meeting with Delphina.",
        "Brody: That wack job.",
        "Natalie: The psychic.",
        "Brody: Like I said.",
        "Natalie: Actually, she was a big help.",
        "Brody: Yeah? How?",
        "Natalie: With Rex. He's been having a really hard time.",
        "Brody: I'll bet.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, and it turns out she actually had information for me. Yeah!",
        "Brody: What about?",
        "Natalie: About Marty and what happened before she pushed me off the roof.",
        "Brody: You asked Delphina about that?",
        "Natalie: Well, we were talking about Gigi and the tape that she had and how I believe that whatever was on there will tell me why Marty and I were fighting.",
        "Brody: But the tape was blank.",
        "Natalie: I was hoping Delphina could sense what used to be on it. Isn't that right?",
        "Brody: So?",
        "Natalie: So, she did. She gave me my first clue. Yeah, yeah...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Good?",
        "Blair: Very.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: On a scale of 1 to 3?",
        "Blair: 1 to 3?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah. Compared to your two possible ex-husbands you were kissing.",
        "Blair: Oh! I thought I explained that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, you did. I heard it was all a test to determine who was the real Todd. But you're still kissing other guys trying to provoke a reaction.",
        "Blair: Are you jealous?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Should I be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: If you're my father, then who--",
        "Todd: Victor is my twin brother. And as such, he's your uncle. I know, I know. It's probably a lot for you to deal with. And I...we could call Aunt Viki. She's better than I am at some uncomfortable... I wanted you to be the first to know. I...Shorty, it's me. I'm me. I'm just... you can kick me in the shins if you want. I'll probably be-- it's fair. It's been a really long time, and...there's proof.",
        "Starr: I don't need proof. It's you, Dad. You're home.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm home.",
        "[Starr sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Why are there two of you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Were the DNA tests rigged? Hello?",
        "Victor: DNA tests? No. No, they weren't. It turns out that Starr was right. This guy and I are brothers.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wait. So you have a twin?",
        "Victor: Yeah, a twin brother, an identical twin brother. Only, we were identical when we were born. And the story goes that Irene took one of us and gave us away and then kept the other one, and one of us is named Todd. One of us is named Todd, and the other one was named Victor.",
        "Dani: Why did she... Why didn't she keep both of you?",
        "Victor: That's a good question. She said something about how she couldn't afford it. Not sure.",
        "T\u00e9a: So there's, um... there's a Todd.",
        "Victor: Yes.",
        "T\u00e9a: And there's a Victor.",
        "Victor: Right. Yeah. Here's the thing. Irene brainwashed Victor into believing he was Todd.",
        "Dani: That's sick.",
        "Victor: Well, it's tough, you know, because you can't really hate Victor for that, right?",
        "Dani: So, why would she do that?",
        "T\u00e9a: It doesn't matter, mija. So there's Todd and there's Victor. Who are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What kind of a clue did Delphina give you?",
        "Natalie: Well, I already told you that she knew that Marty and I were fighting about Liam.",
        "Brody: But that's just logical. Marty thought Liam was hers. She's crazy.",
        "Natalie: There's more to it than that.",
        "Brody: Yeah, according to the lady who hears voices.",
        "Natalie: Ok, I felt that there was more to it than that, and Delphina confirmed it.",
        "Brody: How?",
        "Natalie: She said that whatever was on the tape would change people's lives.",
        "Brody: That's the big clue? Of course, she's gonna say that. You tell her you think the tape's important, she's gonna confirm it. And she can say anything she wants about it, because the tape is blank. Nobody can prove her wrong.",
        "Natalie: Ok, have you always been this skeptical?",
        "Brody: Comes with the job. And you should be, too.",
        "Natalie: Brody, Delphina knew that that tape was from Marty's therapy session. I didn't tell her that because I didn't even know that's what it was. And she knew that people heard what was on the tape before it was erased.",
        "Brody: Did she say why?",
        "Natalie: Well, Gigi, for one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How soon can you be fueled and ready? Ok, yeah. Cash? $5,000? Great. Ok, thank you. See ya. Thank you.",
        "Cristian: What for?",
        "Rex: For reminding me I'm rich.",
        "Cristian: I just hope I didn't make a mistake.",
        "Rex: What do you mean?",
        "Cristian: I heard you and David before. This whole Spotted Pony stuff is about Gigi, isn't it?",
        "Rex: Yeah, it's a lead.",
        "Cristian: You know, Rex, what you--I get why you want it to be Gigi, but...",
        "Rex: It couldn't be. I know. I still have to go.",
        "Cristian: Just seems like you're chasing a ghost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: I didn't tell Rex Balsom anything. I don't even know the guy.",
        "Cutter: Then who did?",
        "Rama: I don't know. How do you know someone did?",
        "Cutter: Someone had to tell him something. He's on his way to the Spotted Pony.",
        "Rama: Not everything's about you, Cutter. Maybe he has his own reasons to go to the Spotted Pony.",
        "Cutter: Maybe he does, but look at him. He's on some mission. If he gets down there and starts asking questions...",
        "Rama: It's gonna be very bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, I get that you're worried, but I promise you, I'm sane.",
        "Cristian: I wasn't trying to give you a hard time.",
        "Rex: I know. I appreciate it, really. This is just something I have to do.",
        "Cristian: Then good luck, man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Nobody's gonna bother me at school?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Shane: Right. How stupid do you think I am?",
        "Jack: Seriously. Everyone's gonna leave you alone.",
        "Shane: Why?",
        "Jack: Because it's over.",
        "Shane: What is?",
        "Jack: Everything. Like I said, no one's gonna bother you anymore.",
        "Shane: Yeah? How can you be sure?",
        "Jack: I'll tell them to leave you alone.",
        "Shane: And they'll listen to you, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Shane: Right. 'Cause you're the leader. Except the one night when my mom got locked up and left to die. That was all Brad. You had nothing to do with it. Did you? Huh? Did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know how complicated things are right now.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Not really.",
        "Blair: What are you talking about? There are two guys walking around saying that they're Todd Manning, father of my children, man I used to be married to.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: More than once. Who you say you're over and done with.",
        "Blair: I am over Todd.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: It shouldn't matter which one of them actually turns out to be Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Starr sniffles]",
        "Todd: You're crying. Look at you.",
        "Starr: I'm not crying...",
        "Todd: You are. I can see it.",
        "Starr: Fine. You caught me. I'm a big...I'm a big crybaby now. Can't believe that you're here.",
        "Todd: We haven't spent much time in the last 8 years...",
        "Starr: I... why would he do that to me?",
        "Todd: He didn't really know, not exactly. Somebody brainwashed him and put him in my place. I know. It's a really long and really screwed up story, but it turns out that Addie is actually the sane grandmother in our family, because--",
        "Starr: So is...",
        "Todd: Irene Manning is alive, and she spilled her guts. And John McBain has her in custody.",
        "Starr: Where is, um...",
        "Todd: Victor. His name is Victor. And he's not taking it so well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: I don't like the way you're looking at me right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Come here. We just want to know, all right?",
        "Victor: I love you guys so much.",
        "Dani: You're not him. Are you? You're not my dad.",
        "T\u00e9a: Daniella--",
        "Dani: You're not my dad! After everything we've been through, you're not my--",
        "Victor: Wait a minute, Dani! I am! I am your father!",
        "T\u00e9a: What? What?",
        "Victor: That's what I was trying to say. I'm Todd. Ha ha ha! I'm your father. I'm your husband. The other guy's nobody. I'm Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Is Liam asleep?",
        "Natalie: Finally. Brody you should turn in, too.",
        "Natalie: I am too wired trying to figure out how I'm gonna get the information that was on that tape.",
        "Brody: You said Gigi knew, for one.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Brody: So, who else?",
        "Natalie: Ha! I thought you didn't believe in psychics.",
        "Brody: I don't, but sounds like you do, so tell me.",
        "Natalie: You don't want to know.",
        "Brody: No, really. I'm curious.",
        "Natalie: Delphina said that my Uncle Todd knows the truth.",
        "Brody: Todd.",
        "Natalie: Which makes sense. Marty was hiding on his property before she escaped.",
        "Brody: Manning said he never saw her.",
        "Natalie: Does anyone actually believe that. He must have seen her. He was at the airstrip from where she took off.",
        "Brody: But that's not when we found the tape. It wasn't at Todd's. Marty didn't have it.",
        "Natalie: Ok, so, I don't know. Maybe Marty told him what was on the tape. She had to have known. It was her therapy session.",
        "Brody: If Delphina's right about that.",
        "Natalie: One way to find out.",
        "Brody: What are you doing?",
        "Natalie: Calling my Uncle Todd.",
        "Brody: You can't do that.",
        "Natalie: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: What's the deal, Manning? Everyone follows you except for the one time when it really counts? The big plan to get Shane, then you're nowhere in sight?",
        "Jack: Look, no one knew your mom was gonna show up at the house, and no one knew about the carbon monoxide. Ok?",
        "Shane: No one knew, or you didn't?",
        "Jack: I was just trying to--",
        "Shane: Trying to what?",
        "Jack: Look, no one--",
        "Rex: What's going on? What are you doing here?",
        "Shane: Jack was just getting to that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: Sit down. Stay calm. And let's just think, all right? As you say, Rex Balsom is on his way to the Spotted Pony. But from what we know, it has nothing to do with you.",
        "Cutter: Yeah, but he's still a P.I., and he knows how to ask questions and he knows a loose end when he sees one. So if he uncovers anything...",
        "Rama: It happened years ago. Do you think anyone at the Spotted Pony even remembers what happened?",
        "Cutter: I remember. So if anyone's still there--",
        "Cristian: You guys need drinks? Everything ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I may be over Todd, but he's still the father of my children, so, yes, it matters which one is the real Todd, because he's always gonna be in my life now. You are a parent. Thought you'd understand that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, I get it.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You need answers. So do I. I just want this all to be over. I don't want to think about the agency or any of those years. I don't want to look back anymore. Blair, you're the first person who's made me believe I could have a normal, real life. And you are everything that I have ever wanted. I just want to look forward, and when I look there, I want to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So after they gave all of your memories to Victor, you were what, asleep?",
        "Todd: Not really. I was... I was in limbo.",
        "Starr: For 8 years? How did you not go crazy yourself?",
        "Todd: The only thing that kept me halfway sane was you. And Jack and your Aunt Viki and your mom. I just kept telling myself that there were people in this world that I loved.",
        "Starr: Hey! What are you doing out of bed? What are you doing, you crazy girl?",
        "Todd: Guess that's...",
        "Starr: This is, um... this is Hope. This is your granddaughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Thank God!",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, what she said.",
        "Victor: That would have been bad, huh?",
        "Dani: Bad? Bad? If everything turned out to be a lie, if you weren't my father, I don't know what I would have done.",
        "Victor: I don't know either, but it's ok. It's ok. This is the way it's supposed to be.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd?",
        "Victor: Hmm? That's me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank God.",
        "Victor: Let's celebrate.",
        "T\u00e9a: Celebrate?",
        "Victor: Yes, absolutely! I'm--I'm--I'm Todd. I'm--I'm the love of your life. I'm the guy who writes the checks around here. Come on! I'm the guy--hear this.",
        "Dani: What?",
        "Victor: I'm the guy who can just like that-- book extended beach vacations.",
        "Dani: For real?",
        "Victor: You bet.",
        "Dani: Don't--",
        "Victor: Don't you like the beach?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Victor: Did you grow up there?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Victor: Huh? Come on! Let's do it. I'm taking the family to Hawaii. What do you say?",
        "T\u00e9a: How soon do we leave?",
        "Victor: Oh, tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You want to call Todd Manning and ask him about something a psychic told you?",
        "Natalie: Why are you so down on Delphina? She's helped the department before.",
        "Brody: It's not just that. Why would Todd tell you the truth. He says he saw her and--",
        "Natalie: Right. He was harboring a fugitive.",
        "Brody: His story is he never saw Marty. He never had contact with her. Why would he admit to lying to us?",
        "Natalie: You're right, you're right. He wouldn't. Which means I have to figure out another way to try to find out what Todd knows.",
        "Brody: I don't think now is the time to get into it with him. We still don't know which one of those guys is really Todd.",
        "Natalie: Maybe Delphina does.",
        "Brody: Actually, we brought somebody back from Louisiana who should be able to clear it up.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I saw John earlier.",
        "Brody: They're probably still figuring it out.",
        "Natalie: Ok, you're right. I'm gonna have to wait to talk to Todd.",
        "Brody: Does it really matter. Compared to what's going on with the two Todds?",
        "Natalie: I know, but Delphina said it was really important.",
        "Brody: Look, you're back. Liam's safe. Marty's gone. What's more important than that?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. But that's why I have to find out.",
        "Brody: Or you could let it go. Natalie, I hate to see you get so obsessed about this thing for sure. And in the end, it won't matter. I want to focus on our son, on us. What's more important than that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
