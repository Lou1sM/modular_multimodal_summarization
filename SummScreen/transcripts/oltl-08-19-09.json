Cole suggests that he sell to freshmen at Llanview University.",

Matthew agrees that he made a mistake, but asserts that everyone makes mistakes, mentioning his parents. After court, Bo tells Nora that if he is going to bring up their secret in court, he should allow them to tell Clint first because Clint doesn't deserve to be blindsided. David Vickers takes his reality show to the Buchanan family. When he won't leave, Clint points a rifle at him. As David backs away from Clint, he backs into his father, Bo.",

        "Starr: Oh, I hate it any time. Can you believe how cute she is?",
        "Langston: She's adorable. I say we get the hard classes out of the way in the morning.",
        "Starr: What are you doing?",
        "Langston: Picking our AP classes so that we can have free periods together.",
        "Starr: No, you don't need to do that.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Matthew, enlighten us. Why do you think you have the maturity to make a decision of this magnitude about your health? Wasn't it your own bad judgment that put you in this wheelchair in the first place?",
        "T\u00e9a: Objection, Your Honor! That assumes facts not in evidence. That would be irrelevant even--",
        "Elijah: This 15-year-old boy is petitioning for the right to make a critical medical decision. His judgment, or lack thereof, is at the very center of this case.",
        "Judge: Establish a foundation.",
        "Elijah: Thank you, Your Honor. Matthew, the night of the accident, after you left the dance, exactly what did you do?",
        "Matthew: I got a ride from my friend Cole Thornhart. We got into an accident and I was thrown from the car.",
        "Elijah: Well, how could that have happened if you were wearing your seat belt?",

        "Jessica: I'm not sure.",
        "Brody: So where have you been?",
        "Jessica: Well, you know how I said I didn't want to talk to Dr. Levin about it? I talked to Dr. Levin about it.",
        "Brody: Okay.",
        "Jessica: I don't want to lose it, Brody. I can't, so I have to face that I have a problem now.",

        "Ford: You're getting this, right?",
        "Markko: Yeah, we're good.",
        "David: Favor me. Kill the fatted calf, Nigel. The prodigal Buchanan son is home at last, and this time I'm here to stay.",

        "Clint: How the hell did anybody get their hands on this? Somebody mailed this to you?",
        "Jared: Hand-delivered.",
        "Clint: So what about the logbook?",
        "Jared: Well, the name was a scribble, of course. I tried to chase the guy down when I saw what it was, but he was already gone.",
        "Clint: What about security?",
        "Jared: We went over all the security tapes. There's only one shot, but nobody could ID him. He had no clearance to be in the building.",
        "Clint: Can you tell who it is?",
        "Jared: No.",
        "Natalie: I mean, who would want to do something like this?",
        "Clint: Does Jessie know about this? Because this could destroy her.",

        "Jessica: How do you know it's not all in my head?",
        "Brody: Remember when you told me about the heart outline on the French doors at your house?",
        "Jessica: Yes, yes.",
        "Brody: Okay, I checked. I fogged up the glass and the outline was still there. You didn't imagine it, Jess. There is somebody real stalking you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Yeah, I work for you, but that doesn't mean I have to explain every minute of my life to you.",
        "Sergei: It is friendly question, Cole.",
        "Cole: Okay, how can we be friends if I don't even know your name?",
        "Sergei: Call me Sergei.",
        "Cole: Okay, Sergei.",
        "Sergei: Now tell me why you are hanging out with the authorities.",

        "Sergei: Ah. Very wise.",
        "Cole: Now I'm gonna ask you a question, Sergei, if that's okay? Why--why are you here?",
        "Sergei: I have great interest in your life...and recovery. How it works, this is our competition.",
        "Cole: Okay, there'll be plenty of other customers.",
        "Sergei: Some of them right here.",
        "Cole: Maybe. But if I give you all of my customers, you wouldn't need me, would you?",

        "Starr: So I'm supposed to take notes while someone else is taking care of my baby?",
        "Langston: Um, yeah.",
        "Starr: What? I've already missed out on so much of Hope's life already.",
        "Langston: So you're gonna miss out on the rest of yours instead?",
        "Starr: I can't imagine leaving her all day.",
        "Langston: But you can imagine being a dropout teenage mother?",
        "Starr: Okay, you make that sound really awful.",
        "Langston: Hello! Don't you want to be independent, be able to take care of yourself in the world?",
        "Starr: Yes, I do.",
        "Langston: Or do you just want to depend on handouts from your family for the rest of your life?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Langston: Don't you want to set a good example for your daughter?",
        "Starr: Yes. I want to take responsibility for her. How can I go back to school and do that?",

        "Nigel: Do you have an appointment?",
        "David: Nigel, loyal retainer to the Buchanans for generations. Ford, should we do on-screen titles?",
        "Ford: Absolutely. We need to build brand and audience loyalty. Priscilla, write...",
        "Nigel: Now, if you'll excuse me...",
        "David: Nigel, dude!",
        "Nigel: I am not by any known latitude of the word a \"dude.\"",
        "Ford: Genius. Write that down.",
        "David: It is I, David Buchanan. You can no longer keep me from my birthright. It was Nigel who moved heaven and earth to prevent me from knowing that I was a Buchanan.",
        "Nigel: And I was correct. You are not Asa Buchanan's son.",
        "David: He speaks nothing but the truth. It turns out I was the last stateside roll in the hay for a young...",
        "Nigel: Undoubtedly drunken...",
        "David: Bo Buchanan, who went to war.",
        "Nigel: I must insist that you leave.",
        "David: Give it a rest, Nigel! I've come back to my ancestral home, the home of my granddaddy. My handicapped little brother needs me here, and most importantly, we have to be ready for a fall-season launch.",

        "Elijah: Matthew, was your seat belt defective?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Elijah: Did it break in the crash?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "Elijah: I mean, your mom and dad taught you to buckle up, didn't they? You do know it's the law, don't you?",
        "Matthew: Yes.",
        "Elijah: So then how were you thrown from the car?",
        "Matthew: I wasn't wearing my seat belt.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, this is harassment. Matthew is in no way responsible for the accident that paralyzed him.",
        "Elijah: Again, this speaks to his judgment and maturity.",
        "Judge: I'll allow it.",
        "Elijah: Matthew, why weren't you wearing your seat belt?",
        "Matthew: I wasn't thinking.",
        "Elijah: Why not?",
        "Matthew: I--there was this thing at the dance.",
        "Elijah: \"A thing\"?",
        "Matthew: Uh, I don't know. Like a joke. These kids were making fun of me. I had to get out of there fast.",
        "Elijah: So you ran out of that dance, jumped in the first car you saw, and then just didn't buckle your seat belt?",
        "Matthew: No, it didn't happen like that.",
        "Elijah: Would you call that sound judgment? Would you say it was a mature decision?",
        "Destiny: Matthew's not the one who made the big mistake here. It's his parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Why don't you look convinced?",
        "Jessica: Because I know myself, or, my selves. I could've drawn the heart, Brody.",
        "Brody: Okay, you've been doing great. I haven't noticed anything off about you. Have you had any signs?",
        "Jessica: No, no. I'm not losing time. And I've been dealing with Chloe's death, and I've been handling it. I've been handling everything until now.",
        "Brody: So do you think you're doing this to yourself?",
        "Jessica: No. No, I don't. But that's why the heart on the window freaked me out so much. It was--it was our thing.",
        "Brody: What do you mean?",
        "Jessica: Well, Nash would draw a heart on my hand with his finger to tell me that he loved me. You know, it's the last thing he did before he died.",
        "Brody: I'm so sorry that some creep would use that.",
        "Jessica: No, no. No one knew about it except Nash and me. Not even Natalie. You're the first person that I've told. There's only one person who could've known to draw a heart on that window, and that's Nash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: I must insist...",
        "David: Oh, relax, Nigel. Come on, this is gonna be fun!",
        "Nigel: Who are these people?",
        "David: This is my 3-man crew: Ford, Priscilla, Markko.",
        "Markko: I don't have a card yet.",
        "David: You see that? We're bringing jobs into the community.",
        "Nigel: But why? How--why?",
        "David: Nigel, it's a reality television show.",
        "Nigel: Ah!",
        "David: I know. Brilliant, right?",
        "Nigel: No. I would die before you make a mockery of this family.",
        "David: Ford, do you love this guy? Nigel, I see a whole spinoff for you, some sort of a \"out of the pantry and onto the red carpet\" sort of makeover deal.",
        "Ford: David?",
        "David: Huh? Uh, everyone, hold your marks.",
        "Ford: This isn't working.",
        "David: Oh, no. No, no. I'm not taking off my shirt on television.",
        "Ford: No, you promised us crazy rich people.",
        "David: We've been knee-deep in crazy rich folks since we got to town!",
        "Ford: Yeah, but that does us no good if we can't film. We've been kicked out of 2 houses already.",
        "David: No, this is my family. We're good here.",
        "Ford: Then why didn't we come here first?",
        "David: Because I owed it to Dorian to give her a shot at fame. And Viki and Jessica--they would've made great reality television. I mean, between the two of them, there's at least 7 characters.",
        "Ford: Wait, so this family's boring?",
        "David: Boring? Did you see the moat? Ford, my father is the commissioner of police. My uncle is a genuine cowboy. My grandmother was an ex-madam at a brothel! My little brother is the Tiny Tim of Llanview High! Look at this! We have expensive locations, a laundry list of characters. And if you insist, I will reluctantly take off my shirt.",
        "Ford: Your family also seems to hate you.",
        "David: Of course they do. A big dramatic arc: \"An epic journey home by a hero.\"",
        "Ford: Yeah, but if they won't cooperate, then we're back right where we started. We have to start all over.",
        "David: No. This is my family. They can't kick me out! Come on! Nigel, who's home?",
        "Nigel: You will not pass.",
        "David: Move or I'll make you move.",
        "Nigel: So be it!",
        "David: Ford?",
        "Ford: Priscilla?",
        "Markko: No. If you hurt him, I quit.",
        "Priscilla: I'm not hurting anyone. I wouldn't dream of it. No animals or butlers were hurt in the making of this picture. They were tickled pink.",
        "Nigel: No, no, no, no! Please...",
        "[Nigel laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Is that some--somebody's sick idea of a joke? Or is it a threat that's gonna lead to blackmail?",
        "Natalie: Everyone knows that Nash's death was an accident.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Anybody out to get back at you for it?",
        "Natalie: You mean besides Tess?",
        "[Nigel laughs]",
        "David: Uncle Clint.",
        "Clint: What--what the hell--what are you doing here, Vickers?",
        "David: It's Buchanan now, remember?",
        "Clint: How'd you get in?",
        "Nigel: No, please! No--just cease and desist! Oh, I tried to stop them, sir. They're making reality-TV programming!",
        "Clint: Oh--Vickers, I don't have any time for whatever it is you're doing. So you and your little friends, get out. Nigel, I want a word with you.",
        "David: Cousin Natalie. Cousin Natalie, former trailer trash and pool hall hustler, now the dainty flower of the Buchanan house. Like Natalie, I came to the Buchanan family picnic late.",
        "Jared: Take your hands off of her, you freak!",
        "David: Speaking of freaks, these two were having sex while he pretended to be her uncle.",
        "Natalie: No, no, he never touched me while--while he was doing all that.",
        "David: Angle on Jared Banks. He came to town posing as the Buchanan heir.",
        "Ford: Hold your shot. Hold that shot.",
        "David: Almost foiled your plan there, didn't I, Banks?",
        "Natalie: Oh, you're an idiot.",
        "David: So you tied me up half naked in the barn and stashed me with the horses.",
        "Jared: And I'm gonna do a lot worse if you don't leave my family alone.",
        "David: And we certainly know you're capable of violence, don't we, Mr. Banks? For this man pushed Natalie's sister's husband through a skylight and caused his death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Okay, you drew a heart on your baby's casket. I saw that, and so maybe it wasn't as secret as you thought. Maybe somebody picked up on you and Nash using it before.",
        "Jessica: Maybe.",
        "Brody: I tried to get a fingerprint. It was too smeared for a lift, but there was a fingerprint. A human hand drew that heart. There's somebody real out there messing with you.",
        "Jessica: Right.",
        "Brody: So focus on that.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Okay, I will. Um, I have to--I have to go and drop Bree's paperwork off at her preschool, so--",
        "Brody: Be careful, okay? If you think you're being followed, you call me immediately.",
        "Jessica: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Vickers, you know that-- would you turn that thing off? You're making me crazy! You know that Nash's death was an accident.",
        "David: That's your story. But is it true or is it a mystery? Secret treachery that I will expose.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. Were you the one who sent that DVD?",
        "David: What?",
        "Natalie: Pictures of Nash's death.",
        "David: Footage or stills?",
        "Jared: You want to shut him up, or I will.",
        "Natalie: Because, you know, they showed up the same day you did.",
        "Clint: I hope you're not trying to make money off that young man's death.",
        "David: Vengeance from beyond the grave...jackpot! We'll kick ratings butt with this!",

        "Delphina: You read the door?",
        "Jessica: Yes. So you know who I am?",
        "Delphina: Well, I met Tess last summer. She's not around anymore, right? Or the other one: Prissy, glasses?",
        "Jessica: How do you know Bess?",
        "Delphina: Maybe we should go back to the door, start over. That might save us some questions.",
        "Jessica: Okay, so you know things.",
        "Delphina: That's why you pay me. For example, I know that you think I'm a fraud.",
        "Jessica: My grandmother is Renee Buchanan. She believes in you, and she said that you reached my grandfather the night before my mom's wedding.",
        "Delphina: Uh-huh. Well, that wasn't much of a conversation. Yes, Asa was into a lot of, shall we say, mischief. Didn't have time for me.",
        "Jessica: \"Mischief\"?",
        "Delphina: Mischief: Making the lights go out, mixing up the couples' names on the banner. He's not really taking that heavenly rest thing very seriously. But that's not why you're here, is it? About the other one.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Delphina: The other presence I felt that night.",
        "Jessica: You felt someone? There was something...",

        "Jared: You need help tossing these clowns?",
        "Clint: No. This may be the only thing I enjoy all day. Look, I want the two of you to find Jessica. Warn her about this DVD, but do it nice and gently, okay?",

        "Starr: So you think that someone else should take care of my kid?",
        "Langston: Starr, people in this house are in line fighting over the chance to change Hope's diapers. I mean, hot and cold running babysitters. You are so covered on that front.",

        "Starr: I--I don't know. I don't know what I want right now...except to see Cole.",
        "Langston: Well, all he has to do is pass the GED exam and he gets his diploma. I mean, graduate high school, and in a year we can all be in college together.",

        "Elijah: But that wasn't the worst of it. You knew Cole Thornhart was using drugs, didn't you?",

        "Elijah: A fact you never bothered to share with your parents, right?",

        "Elijah: So let me get this straight. The drug user that you've chosen to drive you home tried to get you out of the car, but yet you insisted on riding anyway?",
        "Matthew: Look, I just wanted to get home!",
        "Elijah: You would've done anything to get out of that dance, huh? Just like you'd do anything to walk again? What do you think that says about your judgment, Matthew?",
        "Matthew: Okay, I'm sorry! I made a mistake! Everyone makes mistakes. Why don't you ask my parents? I'll bet you they did something that they regret.",
        "Elijah: We're talking about your judgment, Matthew. Once you realized or even suspected that Cole was in an altered state, you didn't try to get out of the car. You didn't ask him to pull over and let you out.",
