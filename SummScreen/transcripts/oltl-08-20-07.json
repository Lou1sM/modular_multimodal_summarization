        "Banks: Well, if you consider where I was living before, this is actually a step up.",
        "Man: Where were you -- prison? Never mind -- I don't want to know. I just need my money at the end of each week.",

        "Nora: I'm not talking about work, Bo.",
        "Bo: Ok. What?",
        "Nora: You. Your father just died. Why don't you take some time?",
        "Bo: Because I got too much to do.",
        "Nora: You think burying yourself under work is going to make everything better?",
        "Bo: No. No, you're right. I just can't believe he's gone.",

        "Miles: Oh. Good, I hope so -- I'm new at this.",

        "Marcie: What? Come on! I'm sorry, but even in his worst nightmares, for your brother to think that I killed Spencer Truman -- don't get me wrong. I didn't love the guy, but murder him? What possible motive would I even have?",

        "Marty: John.",

        "Marty: You have proof it was somebody else, hard evidence?",

        "Marty: Well, what if you're wrong?",
        "John: I'm not.",

        "Marcie: Well, then why did he even bring it up?",

        "Marcie: Why didn't he look at Marty Saybrooke? She confessed.",

        "Marcie: Oh.",
        "Michael: Unfortunately.",
        "Marcie: Uh-uh. She had means, she had motive. And, ok, you know, maybe I did tell him that I would kill anyone who hurt my son, but, you know, come on! What is he thinking? He knows I know better.",

        "Blair: No, you know what?",
        "Max: But, no, no -- he can take pot shots at me all he wants, but once he starts on you --",
        "Todd: You've got the hots for her, man. Why don't you just admit it and get over it? You lost.",
        "Blair: Stop it! We're here to fight Miles Laurence today, not Max, all right?",
        "Todd: It seems like he started it. So, what do you want anyway? A little -- a little quickie? You know, blow the dust off the --",
        "Blair: Uh -- for your information, Max is on his way back to Argentina.",
        "Todd: Oh. And he was going to give you a \"companion flies free\" ticket?",
        "Max: Well, since you brought it up, yes. I asked Blair to come back with me.",
        "Todd: He did?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Todd: So isn't that winter down there or something? It's -- it's not conducive to vacation.",
        "Max: Oh, no, actually, it's great in the winter. I'm sure that Jack and Starr are just going to love it, and I told Blair that if she and the kids like it, they could stay.",
        "Todd: Oh --",
        "Blair: Don't even think about it, Todd.",
        "Max: No, why don't I just give you two a moment.",
        "Blair: You know, when are you ever going to get over this?",
        "Todd: When that son of a bitch stops jerking you around.",
        "Blair: Maybe he wasn't doing that.",
        "Todd: So you're -- you're really considering this?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, I did.",

        "Miles: Don't you have enough to deal with? Your grandfather died, you have a new job. You don't need to be holding my hand at my hearing.",
        "Natalie: Did it ever occur to you that maybe I need a distraction?",
        "Miles: Today's no big deal. The judge is going to decide whether my case goes to trial. It's a foregone conclusion.",
        "Natalie: And you would do it for me.",
        "Miles: Well, yeah -- definitely. But what makes you so sure I'm not guilty?",
        "Natalie: You have a good heart, Miles.",
        "Miles: Hmm. You're an incredible friend. I have to get ready for court.",

        "Nora: Yeah, a little bit, you know? Nigel's been helping him to feel better. Wow -- he loved his grandfather like crazy.",
        "Bo: They both did.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Bo: I think those two were probably Pa's best friends.",
        "Nora: Well, look, don't cut yourself off that list.",
        "Bo: No. No, we weren't friends. He was my father.",
        "Nora: Can't be both?",
        "Bo: Sure you can. I try with Matthew, I try to be his friend and his father because I don't want to make the same mistakes Pa made. But, you know, now, I -- I don't know. I have so many questions.",
        "Nora: Well, that happens, you know, when -- when somebody dies. You start looking at life very differently. This is none of my business, but if you need the time, take it. Don't force things. I'll let you know what's going on in court.",
        "Bo: Hey.",

        "Antonio: It's good to be back.",
        "Talia: It's good having you back. The Commissioner really missed you.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, he said as much at the funeral.",
        "Talia: Well it was a really tough day for him yesterday, and for you.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, I was there to support Bo.",
        "Talia: I'm talking about you having to dodge Jessica and Nash.",

        "Nash: Don't you ink this is something we should've talked about?",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, you -- you'd want to come with us.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Well, you can't right now, Nash, not with the vineyard and trying to buy out Antonio.",
        "Nash: Jessica, you -- you shouldn't be traveling right now. You just got out of the hospital from a liver transplant, what --",
        "Jessica: Well, I'll be going on the family jet, and there's going to be a nurse waiting for me on the other end.",
        "Nash: The other end? Where -- where is that, exactly?",
        "Jessica: Well, I want to go and see Kelly and my brothers, and, you know, Bree is Zane's cousin, or his aunt or something, and --",
        "Nash: London. You're talking about London.",
        "Jessica: Yes -- I know it sounds impulsive.",
        "Nash: \"Impulsive\"? Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Well, I talked to Kelly for a long time on the phone last night, and you know, Michael cleared me to go.",
        "Nash: Jessica, what is all this about? I mean -- except for our night at Niagara Falls in your hospital room, we haven't even had a honeymoon yet.",
        "Jessica: This has nothing to do with you. I promise.",
        "Nash: Oh, ok, yeah, sure. I -- I know you'd never lie to me. I just don't understand.",
        "Jessica: I just -- I need a little space. Can you give me that?",

        "Marcie: Well, you se the thing is, you weren't exactly the committee's first choice.",
        "Lindsay: It was Nora, right? Nora got it again and she turned it down, right?",
        "Marcie: No, it's not Nora. Do you know Martha Winston -- you know, the lady who runs the Llanview charities?",
        "Lindsay: Well, of course, I know who Martha Winston is. She's -- she's second only to Viki Davidson as patron saint of Llanview.",
        "Marcie: Not anymore.",
        "Lindsay: What?",
        "Marcie: Apparently, she had a fling with her hottie assistant guy, you know?",
        "Lindsay: What?",
        "Marcie: Yes, and now she's leaving her husband for him.",
        "Lindsay: No way!",
        "Marcie: Yes, so, they made you the Woman of the Year instead.",
        "Lindsay: How did my name even come up?",
        "Marcie: Guilty. I nominated you, but I didn't want to tell you because I wanted it to be a surprise.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not surprised -- I'm shocked.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Lindsay: I can't believe it.",
        "Marcie: Believe it. Look at all the amazing things you've done this year, Lindsay, especially that advocacy group for moms and children? Believe me, it wasn't a tough sell, ok?",
        "Lindsay: I -- I just don't know what to say.",
        "Marcie: You deserve this. You've helped so many people. It's a testament to the kind of woman that you are. Jen would've been really proud of her mom right now.",
        "Lindsay: I'm not really so sure about that.",

        "Natalie: Um -- ok, Michael. I mean, I just don't have too much time. I'm going to Miles' hearing.",
        "Michael: No, I'll -- I'll be really quick. I just -- I didn't -- I didn't know who else to come to.",
        "Natalie: About what?",
        "Michael: Well, do you have any pull left with John -- I mean, like any at all? Because if you do, I -- I could really use your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Jury selection starts today -- did your lawyer talk to you about that?",
        "Marty: Yeah, yeah. She said she was going to try to get a lot of women on the jury, said they might be more sympathetic towards my motive.",
        "John: Well, you pled not guilty. There really isn't a motive.",
        "Marty: Why are you so sure I'm innocent?",
        "John: Well, for starters, your memories don't include the actual stabbing.",
        "Marty: There's a lot of reasons for that.",
        "John: Really? All right. Well, how about you explain how you woke up in the on-call room, passed out with a head injury we can't explain? And I just know.",
        "Marty: Yeah, well, that's not going to quite cut it in court.",
        "John: Yeah, but reasonable doubt will, and there's a lot of that.",
        "Marty: It doesn't mean a jury is going to see it that way.",
        "John: Look, you love your son. I think anyone can see that. A murder conviction takes you away from him. I think that alone means there's no way you could've killed Truman.",
        "Marty: Not necessarily.",
        "John: What are you, opposing counsel today?",
        "Marty: Look, I'm playing devil's advocate.",
        "John: Yeah, ok, I'll play. So let's say you killed Truman because you're trying to defend Blair. Would you really have stabbed him nine times and then run away?",
        "Marty: Look, I must have.",
        "John: You don't know that for sure.",
        "Marty: You know what -- and neither do you. The D.A. considers this case closed, so if you are using department time to try to find another suspect, you could get in a lot of trouble.",
        "John: If the truth comes out, I don't care.",
        "Marty: Yeah, well, I do.",
        "John: All right. Well, then maybe you can understand where I'm coming from here, all right? You're already in a lot of trouble, and I'm going to get you out of it, no matter what I have to do.",

        "Nash: Yeah, you can have anything you want -- even space. Just -- tell me why you need it.",

        "Nash: You sure?",
        "Jessica: Oh -- of course I'm sure. I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life.",
        "Nash: Then who Antonio?",
        "Jessica: I knew it would be bad, but I --",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Jessica: It's like he's everywhere, you know? Our families are so connected, I can't get away from him. Losing Asa, my Grandfather -- I mean, I miss him so much. It's not the same around here without him.",
        "Nash: Yeah. You know, losing Asa -- I'm just not sure the traveling, that's really going to help you with that.",
        "Jessica: A little time and distance might help with things a little.",
        "Nash: How about work?",
        "Jessica: Todd said I could write from London.",
        "Nash: Hmm. So that's it? You're sure?",
        "Jessica: Honey, nobody knows me there, you know? I can go shopping and I can take the kids to the museum and not worry about somebody around the corner whispering about me, about what I've done.",
        "Nash: What you did -- marrying me?",
        "Jessica: No. No! But let's face it, I -- I cheated on Antonio. And everybody knows it.",
