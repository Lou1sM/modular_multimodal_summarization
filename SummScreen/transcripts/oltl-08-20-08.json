        "Tina: Ow. Oh! Ow, ow. So much for domesticity.",
        "[Tina sighs]",
        "Tina: Oh, no. You know, I don't think Lois likes me. That's why she didn't make me any coffee. Aw, sweetheart, you miss the palace, too, don't you? Well, don't you worry. As soon as I figure out how to fence those jewels, we are gong back to the lap of luxury. Jessica? What on earth were you doing down there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hey, guess what?",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Nora: Matthew heard from Bo last night. He's fine.",
        "Clint: You're kidding?",
        "Nora: No, I was going to tell you last night, but you came in so late.",
        "Clint: Where is he?",
        "Nora: Well, he's been down at the ranch this whole time.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, Chuck said he wasn't--",
        "Nora: No, no, he wasn't staying at the house. He was apparently camping out on the grounds. I don't know why.",
        "Clint: Camping? Is he coming home soon?",
        "Nora: Uh, so I gather.",
        "Clint: Oh, this is great news.",
        "Nora: Yes. Cole, are you okay?",
        "Cole: Oh, yeah, no, I just -- I woke up with this really bad headache. It's weird. I never get headaches.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You know what, Sam? I don't think you should be playing with this, okay? It's not a regular toy.",
        "Langston: He's been in a mood since you brought him down.",
        "Starr: Well, I know he's been cranky because he woke up and my mom's not here. Do you know where she is?",
        "Langston: Mm-mm.",
        "Starr: Oh, Grandma? Do you know where my mom is?",
        "Addie: I think I saw her drive away.",

        "Addie: Last night.",
        "Starr: Mom.",
        "Blair: Y'all are all up early this morning.",
        "Langston: Thank Sam.",
        "Blair: Um, I -- I just ran out for bagels.",
        "Starr: Oh, where are they? I'm starving.",
        "Blair: Well, those cinnamon raisin bagels you love so much? They were out of them this morning, so I just didn't bother to get any.",
        "Starr: Nice try, Mom.",
        "Addie: Blair?",
        "Blair: Hmm?",
        "Addie: There's no shame in admitting you were out on a booty call.",

        "John: Morning.",

        "Officer: The info you requested on Ramsey.",
        "John: Thanks. What's this?",
        "Officer: Desk sergeant says some lady left it behind for you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Mm, morning.",
        "Todd: Morning.",
        "Marty: Oh, my, for a guy who says he doesn't sleep, you sure know how to snore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Like you know what a booty call is, Mama.",
        "Addie: They did have movies at St. Anne's. And when David and I were married --",
        "Blair: Okay, that's enough. We have children here. And how's my big little man this morning?",
        "Starr: Oh, he's grumpy.",
        "Blair: Yeah?",
        "Starr: So is it true you were out with another guy last night?",
        "Langston: Another guy? As in more than one?",
        "Blair: Well, Starr, you're certainly, like, expanded. A little bit more than, like, yesterday.",
        "Starr: Don't try to change the subject on me. You are hooking up with someone and don't act like it's not going to effect me and Sam and Jack.",
        "Addie: If she won't tell us who it is, we could always guess. Let's go alphabetically. Bo Buchanan?",
        "Blair: Oh, Mother, please.",
        "Langston: The brother, maybe?",
        "Starr: Oh, no. My mom would never go for Aunt Dorian's seconds.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? I'm in the room here. Why don't you all stop?",
        "Starr: You know what? I know exactly who it is. It's Cristian.",
        "Langston: Vega? Ooh.",
        "Addie: Would that be a \"C\" or a \"V\"?",
        "Blair: Oh, stop.",

        "Marty: You don't remember me asking you to roll over?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Marty: Twice. God, I thought I was the one who had the memory loss.",
        "Todd: That's strange. Why has no one ever told me?",
        "Marty: I don't know.",
        "Janet: Okay -- oh, excuse me. I'm sorry --",
        "Marty: Why the hell don't you knock?",
        "Janet: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: Jeez, just give me the tray and get out. Get out!",
        "Janet: Well --",
        "Todd: I'm sorry, I don't like her. I have no idea why Ramsey hired her.",
        "Marty: I think someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.",
        "Todd: Who, me?",
        "Marty: Yeah, you. It should've been me.",
        "Todd: Why?",
        "Marty: Because I had another weird dream.",
        "Todd: Oh, about what happened in college?",
        "Marty: No, not this time. This time I dreamt about John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, it's McBain. Get a unit to pick up Keyshawn Reddick. He goes by the name \"Keys.\" He works for Todd Manning, but Manning can't know anything about it. Parole violation or something. I don't care what you tell him; just get his ass down here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Isn't that the way to the mausoleum?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Yeah, it's also the way to the, um, breaker box. I was drying my hair and the lights went out.",
        "Tina: Wow. And you know how to fix that? Huh. I would have just put on a hat.",
        "Tess: Uh, it looks like you failed dog training, too.",
        "Tina: Ah, David Vickers, shame on you. You know, I was going to take him for a walk, but I really needed a cup of coffee and then there wasn't any. Where is Lois, anyway?",
        "Tess: On vacation.",
        "Tina: Viki gave her time off when she was going to be away?",
        "Tess: No, I did.",
        "Tina: Why would you do a thing like that?",
        "Tess: Because I didn't want anybody hovering, okay? If you want to be waited on, maybe you should go someplace else.",
        "Tina: Um, well, no, I mean, I really love spending time with you and Natalie and little Gouda.",
        "Tess: Bree. It's Bree.",
        "Tina: Oh. You know, I never could get those cheese names right. Um, but you know, now that Viki's gone --",
        "Tess: Look, I don't need a babysitter, okay?",
        "Tina: Honey, look, your husband just died. You're pregnant. You have a little girl. You need somebody.",
        "Tess: I have Natalie and Jared.",
        "Tina: And you know, Viki, she was so torn about leaving you right now. So you know what? I think I'm going to call her.",
        "Tess: I don't want my mother.",
        "Tina: Why not?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] What I meant was is my mother is halfway around the world and, uh, she doesn't need to be bothered.",
        "Tina: Jessica, I'm worried about you. I mean, I heard you walking around down here at 2 A.M.",
        "Tess: I was hungry. Happens when you're pregnant.",
        "Natalie: Hey, is everything okay? We smelled smoke.",
        "Tina: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I tried to make muffins. You know, I never really understood that there was a difference between bake and broil.",
        "Natalie: Oh, well, you know what? I can make breakfast if you guys want it.",
        "[Scoffs]",
        "Jared: Uh-oh, what?",
        "Natalie: Nothing. There's water on the -- I hope it's water.",
        "Tina: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. David Vickers isn't entirely potty trained just yet.",
        "Natalie: Ew. Can I get a paper towel or something?",
        "Jared: Yeah. There you go.",
        "Natalie: Thanks.",
        "Jared: I hope no one wants to read the paper today.",
        "Tina: Oh, use \"The Banner.\" I really want to read that article in \"The Sun,\" the one about the new police commissioner.",
        "Natalie: God, Todd is such a jerk.",
        "Tess: Tina, I was trying to keep Natalie from seeing that paper.",
        "Tina: Why?",
        "Tess: Well, because John McBain, he -- well , he was the one that got away.",
        "Tina: Oh, honey, honey, I am so sorry.",
        "Natalie: No. No, it's okay, really. John and I were friends.",
        "Tina: Yeah, why pine over him? Especially when you have this fine specimen.",
        "Jared: You know, I should probably get going. I'm chasing down a few leads on jobs today.",
        "Tess: Oh, from what I read in the paper, I hear that Dorian's hiring.",
        "Natalie: Why would you say that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Nora: No, I'm just --",
        "Cole: I'm not hung over, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "Nora: No. Do you want me to get you some aspirin or anything? That's all.",
        "Cole: I took some. I'm starting to feel better already.",
        "Nora: Okay, good, good, good. Because I wanted to take you to the country club for brunch. You up for that?",
        "Cole: Yeah, sure.",
        "Nora: Perfect, great. Hey, Clint, you want to come with Cole and me? We're going to go have brunch at the country club.",
        "Clint: Where?",
        "Nora: Do I even need to ask what you're reading about?",
        "Clint: No, B.E. stock was up another $2 this morning.",
        "Nora: Ah, swell.",
        "Clint: Yeah, swell.",
        "Nora: I'm sorry. It must be kind of hurtful to your ego to know that the shareholders have such faith in Dorian, but she'll fold. She will. She just has this uncanny knack for destroying everything that she touches.",
        "Clint: And we have to stop her before that happens.",
        "Nora: So how's that plan going?",
        "Clint: It's now in its final stage.",
        "Nora: Ah, so I guess you won't be joining Cole and me for brunch.",
        "Clint: No, Nora, I'm sorry, but I have an appointment. Well, you two have a nice time.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "Clint: Good morning, Simon.",
        "Simon: Nigel told me that I'd find you in here.",
        "Nora: Simon, we have excellent news. We found Bo, and he's fine.",
        "Simon: That's great.",
        "Nora: Yeah, so I'm sorry that you had to do all that work for nothing.",
        "Simon: Well, it's never for nothing. Just wait until Clint gets the bill. Well, I'll leave you with what I've got. You never know what could come in handy and when.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: It's not like I'm going to marry the guy. I wouldn't even call him my boyfriend. I don't even want a boyfriend.",
        "Starr: Okay, then what was last night?",
        "Blair: I was enjoying being single.",
        "Starr: What's there to enjoy about being single?",
        "Blair: A lot.",
        "Addie: If your life is so enjoyable, why don't you tell us who this new man is?",
        "Blair: I don't want anyone to know who this new man is because I do not want my life to be more complicated.",
        "Addie: If you're so happy, then it's already complicated. All right, fine. This sounds like a job for Madam Delphina.",
        "Blair: Oh, oh, oh. Okay, everyone, listen up. That woman is not allowed back in this house, not after last time.",
        "Langston: But she knew things.",
        "Addie: What do you have against fortune tellers? Or yoga instructors?",
        "Blair: I do not want anyone to take advantage of this family, and that's exactly what she did. She's a con artist.",
        "Addie: Blair --",
        "Blair: Don't \"Blair\" me, Mama. She's bad news. Starr, we need to get to your ob-gyn appointment this morning.",
        "Starr: Okay, I've been ready. I've just been waiting for you.",
        "Blair: Well, you're not waiting on me anymore, so come on. Let's go. Mama, you'll continue to watch Sam? You guys have a good morning. Come on.",

        "Receptionist: Which doctor are you here to see?",
        "Marcie: Oh, I'm not a patient. Uh, I'm here to meet someone, Starr Manning?",
        "Receptionist: Okay. Um, you can have a seat and wait for her.",
        "Marcie: Okay, thanks.",
        "Receptionist: Are you a relative or something?",
        "Marcie: No, um, I'm just here for moral support really.",

        "Todd: What was this dream about?",
        "Marty: Uh, John was there in the room with me and I wanted answers from him.",
        "Todd: About what?",
        "Marty: About what he'd done to me. How he left me to die.",
        "Todd: What did he say?",
        "Marty: I don't know, it's weird. It -- it was almost like he was challenging me.",
        "Todd: Challenging you? I don't know what that means.",
        "Marty: I don't know. I really don't remember much more.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, forget about him. Forget about John McBain.",
        "Marty: Oh, I don't know if I can do that.",

        "Jared \"The judge's ruling leaves the Buchanan family with little legal recourse, all but cementing Dorian Lord's future as CEO of the newly-renamed company, Cramer Enterprises. Judging by the uptick in C.E.'s stock price, Wall Street has no objections.\" And there's even a picture of Dorian ringing the bell at the New York Stock Exchange.",
        "Natalie: Bitch. I'll ring her bell.",
        "Tina: Why don't you let me talk to Dorian for you?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Tina, this really has nothing to do with you.",
        "Tina: Of course, it does. I am part of this family, all right? And I happen to know what makes Dorian tick.",
        "Jared: Like a bomb.",
        "Natalie: Uh, you know what? Thank you very much, Tina, but Dorian has been planning to do this to our family for a very long time and I really don't think she's going to listen to reason.",
        "Tess: Reason? From Tina?",
        "Natalie: Jess, Dorian's the enemy, not Tina. I mean, the only way we're going to be able to fight her is together. And believe me, for Dad's sake, I really hope I can figure out a way to do this.",
        "Tess: You know, Nash would always tell me that he wished he'd grown up like we did, you know, with a family. And the only time he felt like he was part of a family is when, you know, he joined our family. I'm sorry that Dad's being so cold to you still. You know, it's just really hard.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Tess: He'll get over it. I did.",
        "Natalie: Thank God for that.",

        "Nora: Okay, well, then I'll see you soon.",
        "Clint: All right. And, Cole, when you get to the club, order the eggs benedict -- cures what ails you.",
        "Cole: Great.",
        "Clint: Thank you for not saying anything in front of Nora.",

        "Addie: Weren't you saying just now that you were upset because Madam Delphina wasn't welcome in this house?",
        "Langston: Well, Delphina's okay, I guess, but voodoo?",
        "Addie: Are you starting to doubt her because of what she was trying to tell you?",
        "Langston: She just says stuff.",
        "Addie: Like what?",
        "Langston: Like stuff you can't even figure out.",

        "Receptionist: The doctor can see you now, Starr.",
        "Starr: Okay. Could you hold this stuff? You know, I'll be a couple of minutes, but you guys can come in for the fun part.",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: About what?",
        "Marcie: I should have called you. I should have called you when Starr first brought up the idea of my adopting the baby.",
        "Blair: Well, Marcie, maybe it's a good idea that you didn't. I probably wouldn't have been in a good frame of mind to talk about it, you know?",
        "Marcie: And now? You wish it was anyone else who was adopting Starr's baby, don't you?",

        "Starr: Wait, did you go to Llanview High?",
        "Receptionist: Yeah, I graduated last year. My mom's a nurse here, so this is my summer job.",
        "Starr: Oh, okay. I just thought that I'd seen you around before.",
        "Receptionist: Yeah, I didn't want to say anything, you know, in case you were, like --",
        "Starr: Keeping it a secret? Right, no, I figured out once I go back to school in September, it's going to be pretty obvious.",
        "Receptionist: Wow, you're going back? How are you going to do that, I mean, with the baby and all?",
        "Starr: I'm not keeping the baby.",
        "Receptionist: Is that why Mrs. McBain --",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Receptionist: It's great that your parents were cool with, you know, letting her adopt after everything --",
        "Starr: Oh, no, no. My parents were not cool at all. But it's too bad because I'm the only one that has to be okay with it.",

        "Marty: No, I just wish I knew more about him.",

        "Marty: In my dream, he just didn't seem like such a bad guy.",
        "Todd: It's just a dream.",
        "Marty: I guess so. It's just that -- I don't know, I felt like he was trying to tell me something. And I thought maybe if I could confront him in real life --",

        "Keys: What?",
        "John: You're disgusting. You're a disgusting human being. You know, I have a signed complaint from Blair Cramer saying you held her captive at her ex- husband's residence and forced her to wear a nightgown.",
        "Keys: Well, she came on to me.",
        "John: You don't want to go there. Lest we forget, you're an ex-con on parole.",
        "Keys: What are you trying to do to me?",
        "John: You're doing it to yourself. See, I have enough probable to get a search warrant for the gown. While we're over there, say we turn up a dime bag or a piece, you know that's enough parole violation to send you straight back to Statesville.",
        "Keys: Whoa, I'm the victim here. I got caught up in the middle of some bad business between the Mannings.",
        "John: So why drag you into it?",

        "Simon: So I imagine you'll be able to put some of that information to good use.",
        "Clint: Well, there's definitely a lot here. Whether I can turn it to my advantage, that remains to be seen.",

        "Nora: Listen, you've had a really bad time of it, kiddo, but you've made it through.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I guess. You've got all the rest of this year to figure out what it is that you want and where you want to do it. So believe it or not, you have a future.",
        "Cole: I have a feeling this is going to be a long lunch.",

        "Tina: Well, you know, I have been in Natalie's position lots of times, and it's amazing. I mean, people forgive and forget a lot faster than you'd ever think.",
        "Jared: You know, I've got to get going.",
        "Tina: Oh, so soon?",
        "Jared: Yeah, I've got to get a job. I'm sick of sitting around here waiting for Clint to forgive Natalie for something I did.",

        "Jared: Well, I'm going to take the bull by the horns, as Asa would say, but I'll be back.",

        "Keys: You're not even giving me a chance?",
        "John: Why should I?",
        "Keys: All right, look. If Manning was keeping a woman at his place, then maybe he could have taken her from Ramsey's penthouse after we found him dead.",

        "Todd: Good. I want you to make sure Marty sees this.",
        "Janet: I -- I thought you didn't want her to see any newspapers. You said it would agitate her.",

        "Starr: Me? I've done one stupid thing right after another. My parents -- they're broken up because of this. My boyfriend -- he can't even look me in the eye. I've done so many stupid things, and now I've realized that I need to do what's right, you know? And bringing something so amazing to somebody who deserves it, that's what I think is right.",

        "Blair: I really just try not to feel anything. I mean, that's my flesh and blood in there, and -- well, if I'm not going to be a part of that baby's life, I just don't want to -- I don't want to get too attached, you know?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, like I did to Sam.",

        "Marcie: I'm going to take really good care of that baby.",
        "Blair: Marcie, you don't have to tell me that. I know that. I look at Sam, and I know what kind of mother that you are. But this is Starr's choice, and what I feel about the adoption really doesn't matter.",

        "Keys: Yeah, the dude's crazy. I'm lucky all I got was fired after that thing with Ms. Cramer.",
        "John: He fired you?",
        "Keys: Yeah, he practically threatened to slit my throat, too. I mean, he's got some weird things going on in that house. I'm better off being unemployed.",
