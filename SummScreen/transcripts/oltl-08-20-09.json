        "David: See, bye-bye.",
        "Clint: Yes, yes, you're going bye-bye, but not before you give me all the footage that you shot today.",
        "David: Now you take it easy.",
        "Bo: Watch it.",
        "David: Dad. Thank God you're here. My dad's here.",
        "Clint: Bo, Nora. You're in the line of fire. You want to get out of the way?",
        "David: He's off his meds, Pa. Put him down before he shoots me.",
        "Bo: Get off--get off me.",
        "Markko: Should I keep rolling?",

        "Clint: I am saving our family's good name.",
        "Nora: From what?",

        "Cristian: So what did you want to talk about?",
        "Layla: It's your party.",
        "Cristian: My party. You texted me.",
        "Layla: Excuse me? You texted me.",
        "Layla: \"Meet me at Rodi's at 8 2 talk. Important.\" You sent me the same message. Look.",
        "Cristian: Somebody's screwing with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: So wait. How did you get rid of his roommates?",
        "Kim: Any fool can spoof a text message. Look it up.",
        "Stacy: Okay, later. Right now, I got a Fish to fry.",
        "Kim: Ha ha! Okay, girl. Ring that bell, get your ovulating self in there. You've got about half an hour to get pregnant. Otherwise, it's hello Schuyler or good-bye Rex.",
        "Stacy: Ahh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Wow, Ryan, I am really proud of you.",
        "Ryan: I just bought half a gram of coke.",
        "Schuyler: No, you turned it in. Is this the whole bag?",
        "Ryan: I couldn't touch it. No even a bump. I--",
        "Schuyler: You see that, that right there, that's real change when you can just --you know, you just step back and think it through.",
        "Ryan: Well, you know it helps being able to come here and talk to you. And you don't think I'm a failure?",
        "Schuyler: Oh, God, no. You're not a failure, Ryan. You have a disease. You're an addict just like me, and that is why we need each other. So I'll see you at the next meeting, yeah?",
        "Ryan: Thanks.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, all right, I thought we settled this. I agreed, I'm not gonna see Gigi anymore.",

        "Schuyler: Well, if you have a substance abuse problem, come right--",

        "Jared: Nash? Uh, it's a little too blurry to say for sure.",
        "Natalie: And even if it was crystal clear, Nash is dead.",
        "Brody: I never met the guy, so I'm just asking.",
        "Natalie: But why?",
        "Brody: 'Cause if this guy, whoever he is, looks like Nash, odds are he's trying to make us think Nash is back.",
        "Jared: Wait, bro, you think the guy in the photo...",
        "Natalie: If it's even the same guy.",
        "Jared: ...Is trying to make us think Nash is alive?",
        "Natalie: But who would do that?",
        "Jared: Okay, that's a bit of a jump to go from sending us to get photos to a conspiracy to bring Nash back from the dead.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Where'd you get that idea?",
        "Brody: Jessica.",
        "Natalie: Excuse me?",

        "Kyle: They're not my friends.",
        "Nick: We can go someplace else.",
        "Kyle: Nah. This is fine. I mean, unless you want to go someplace else. It's kind of a dive bar, and the juke box is from the Jurassic era.",
        "Nick: Oh, come on, it's okay. I don't think a little Credence Clearwater ever killed anybody.",
        "Kyle: Sorry. I'm not usually this hyper.",
        "Nick: Yeah. You seem a little on edge.",
        "Kyle: Yeah. I haven't been on a date in...wow. I don't know how long.",

        "Layla: You seem to have a lot to say about my life these days.",
        "Cristian: You're right. So please excuse me for being concerned and telling you straight out, for not trying to trick you into realizing that Fish is no good for you.",
        "Layla: Not going there.",
        "Cristian: Did it ever occur to you that he might have done this?",
        "Layla: Sent the two of us to Rodi's? Now, why would he do that?",
        "Cristian: I don't know. Maybe he wants a little privacy.",

        "Kim: So it's lunchtime, babycakes.",
        "Stacy: Okay. But I can do this, right? 'Cause I've just really been out of the action, so...",
        "Kim: It's like riding a bicycle.",
        "Stacy: Okay.",
        "Kim: Look at you, you're a sex machine. There's not a red-blooded man on the planet that could resist that.",
        "Stacy: But what if his roommates come back home?",
        "Kim: Don't worry. I'll be out here, standing guard.",
        "Stacy: Kimmy, they live here. How are you gonna tell 'em they can't go in their own apartment?",

        "Schuyler: Okay. Whatever.",
        "Rex: Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hassled you and said what I said. But I'd just come off of an argument with my mother, and seeing you with Gigi--",
        "Schuyler: You know, she was hugging me good-bye, Rex.",
        "Rex: And I acted like a jerk. I should have realized it was nothing. Gigi's in love with me, and that will never change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: No one listen to Uncle Clint. You're becoming a bit of a camera hog.",
        "Bo: You're taping a reality show?",
        "Nora: Here?",
        "David: Aunt Nora, shalom.",
        "Nora: Ahh...",
        "David: May I? Eh, you're a lefty. But then again, you would be, wouldn't you? Aunt Nora is my favorite former step-mother. She's also a reformed Jew.",
        "Ford: Hey!",
        "Priscilla: Rivera, snap to.",
        "David: Talking points. She's Llanview's D.A. She also has a half-black daughter with a history of drug abuse, and she's the mother of the paralyzed kid here, who also happens to be my brother. I'm sorry they cancelled \"Queen for a Day.\"",
        "Clint: All right, I've had it. Everybody duck except David.",
        "David: Easy. Matthew, what's up, bro? How's it going?",
        "Matthew: Good to see you, bro.",
        "David: Look at this kid, huh? Look at him. Is he a star or what? Thanks to the slow demise of serialized television, there are more and more time slots available for important programming, like my reality show. So from my home to yours, I give you my family, the Buchs.",
        "David: Welcome back. That's the beauty of reality television-- we are always here. Why don't we take a peek at what Uncle Clint is up to?",
        "Clint: Stand up, you little coward.",
        "Bo: Come on; give me the gun, Clint.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, it's not gonna happen, Bo.",
        "Bo: What, are you crazy?",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Nora: Oh!",
        "Clint: Now look what you made me do.",
        "Ford: Markko, I want a shot of that mantel. Go.",
        "Bo: Give me the gun. You do something like that again, I'll have to arrest you.",
        "Clint: Why don't you try arresting Vickers?",
        "Nora: Do you have a permit?",
        "Ford: Ah, yes, ma'am. Actually, from his honor himself, Mayor Lowell.",
        "Bo: Son of a bitch.",
        "Matthew: What channel will this be on?",
        "David: Bro, by the time we're finished, we'll have our own channel. All Buchs, all the time. What do you say?",
        "Nora: Clint? Reload.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You think Oliver set us up?",
        "Cristian: Somebody sent us those messages. Who else do we have in common?",
        "Layla: Mmm. Why would he do that? Just so he could be alone?",
        "Cristian: I said he wanted privacy. I didn't say he was alone.",
        "Layla: Now you think he's cheating on me.",
        "Cristian: I wouldn't be surprised. I'm sorry.",
        "Layla: No, you're not.",
        "Cristian: Look, Layla, I don't want to be right about this, I really don't, but I just can't stand by and let you get hurt.",
        "Layla: So you did send those messages?",
        "Cristian: No, I didn't. I wouldn't do that. Hey, look, if you're 100% happy with Fish, I'll back off, but somebody sent us here, so we should at least try to find out why.",
        "Layla: And how are we gonna do that?",
        "Cristian: I don't know. We could start by going back to our place.",
        "Layla: And catching Oliver with some other woman? You know what? You're right, I'm gonna go back to the apartment...to see my boyfriend. Bye.",
        "[Christian exhales deeply]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: This really isn't a good time.",
        "Stacy: Candles and wine? I'd say it's pretty perfect.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, only it's not for you.",
        "Stacy: Fish, you knew I was coming over. I told you I had to see you.",
        "Oliver: And I told you I was busy.",
        "Stacy: Aw, you're still mad at me, aren't you?",
        "Oliver: For what?",
        "Stacy: For blowing you off last winter.",
        "Oliver: No. Actually, in fact, that was--you know, our time together really great for me in so many ways. You have no idea.",
        "Stacy: Well, here I am, big boy.",
        "Oliver: Right, only I've moved on.",
        "Stacy: I know. That was my fault. I was sort of hung up on someone I could never have. You know the feeling. But I came to my senses and I realized what I lost.",
        "Oliver: I'm--I'm sorry. It's just not gonna happen.",
        "Stacy: You're not gay, are you?",
        "Oliver: No, of course not.",
        "Stacy: Okay, 'cause you didn't seem gay that night on the couch and on the floor and on the table.",
        "Oliver: I have a girlfriend.",
        "Stacy: I won't tell if you don't tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, well, thanks for the apology and the subtle reminder that Gigi's with you. I get it. I really do. Really...really get it. And I intend on respecting her request that we avoid each other. Now for some reason you obviously can't handle us being friends, which makes life harder on Gigi, and I don't want that, so...anything else?",
        "Rex: Thank you.",
        "Schuyler: For what?",
        "Rex: I know you helped Gigi get the drop on Stacy, and if it hadn't been for you, we would be in an even worse mess than we are now. So... anyway...thanks.",
        "Schuyler: Rex, Gigi put you up to this?",
        "Rex: No. Why?",
        "Schuyler: 'Cause it kind of sounds like you're going through the motions.",
        "Rex: Look, I don't like you, and I'm sure you don't like me.",
        "Schuyler: Ha ha!",
        "Rex: I just didn't want to have to owe you anything. So if you ever need anything--",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, uh, keep your distance. Just like I'm doing.",
        "Rex: I will, but we both live in the same town, so unless one of us moves away --heh heh--I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Schuyler: What? W--so you came here to suggest that I should?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Well, how long has someone been stalking Jessica?",
        "Brody: Since that night at your family's lodge.",
        "Jared: The night before the wedding?",
        "Brody: Jessica says she saw someone outside that night. She said it was Nash.",
        "Jared: Whoa, wait. Jessica claims she saw Nash?",
        "Brody: She was pretty freaked out, and it's happened more than once.",
        "Jared: She talk to Dr. Levin about this? 'Cause I don't want to end up locked up in the basement again. What?",
        "Brody: I think at first what she thought she saw was, I don't know, some kind of a spiritual thing, like Nash was letting her know it was okay to go on and live her life. But then things just kept happening.",
        "Natalie: So this is real?",
        "Brody: Jessica says whoever this is, he knows stuff about her and Nash that nobody else can know. Somebody is out there messing with her head. I have proof.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay, if I'm being completely honest, I didn't think this was gonna work, so I don't know what to say.",
        "Delphina: Well, you better figure it out. This connection's only gonna last for, like, a second. You wanted answers, ask the questions.",
        "Jessica: Okay, okay. Nash, the night at the lodge, the night before the wedding, was that you in the woods?",
        "Jessica: Did you write the heart on the window? I--I need a sign. Are you picking anything up here?",
        "Delphina: It's a little garbled... but the feeling isn't.",
        "Jessica: What feeling? What? What is it?",
        "Delphina: Fear. He's afraid for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Whoever this is who's been appearing to Jessica, trying to make her think he's Nash, he's ramping it up.",
        "Jared: Okay, what do you mean?",
        "Brody: He's leaving signs for her, evidence that he's real.",
        "Natalie: And you are sure it's not in her head like Jared said?",
        "Brody: Jessica's not the only one who's seen it. I've seen it. And so has Bree.",
        "Natalie: Bree?",
        "Brody: The day of the wedding, Bree wandered out onto your terrace, and she came back inside with a toy.",
        "Natalie: The toy elephant. Jessica was freaking out about it. She kept wondering who it came from. She'd never seen it. I thought--",
        "Brody: Bree told Jessica that daddy gave it to her.",
        "Natalie: Wh...",
        "Jared: If this is the same guy that brought us the DVD and the photos...we got to do something.",
        "Natalie: But what? We don't even know who's doing this.",
        "Brody: Well, I can think of two people right off the top of my head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: So, uh, sounds like this last guy really took it out of you.",
        "Kyle: Yeah.",
        "Nick: Just a guess.",
        "Kyle: Been a little gun shy ever since.",
        "Nick: What's he like?",
        "Kyle: Uh, you know, he's a really good guy. A little repressed. But I can't believe I'm talking about my ex-lover.",
        "Nick: Aw, come on, I started it. Keep talking.",
        "Kyle: Did I mention he wasn't gay?",
        "Nick: What, he's not out?",
        "Kyle: No. Look, I--I'm usually way better than this, you know. I can handle myself.",
        "Nick: So I've heard.",
        "Kyle: Really? How's that? We just met.",
        "Nick: Look, after you left the gym, this guy comes up to me, says he's a cop. He warns me about you.",
        "Kyle: Was this cop, you know, short blond hair, cute?",
        "Nick: So you do know him?",
        "Kyle: Yeah. We go way back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Ah, no, I can't. I already broke up with Layla for you once. I'm not gonna do it again.",
        "Stacy: I'm not asking you to break up with her. I just-- I miss you. Don't you miss me even a little bit?",
        "Oliver: I'm taken, okay? Off limits, out of bounds, not for sale.",
        "Stacy: What about a short-term rental, like, say, a half hour?",
        "Oliver: Look, Stacy, I understand what it's like wanting something that you can't have, but I can't help you. I won't hurt Layla. She means too much to me.",
        "Stacy: Oh, that what makes you so special.",
        "Oliver: What are you doing?",
        "Stacy: Saying good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: All I'm saying is--",
        "Layla: If Oliver is cheating on me, I guess we'll find out.",
        "Kim: You can't go in there.",
        "Cristian: Who are you?",
        "Kim: Uh, your neighbor from down the hall. It's just a sublet, but don't tell management.",
        "Layla: Not a problem and nice to meet you. We'll catch up with you later.",
        "Kim: No. I'm telling you, you can't go in there.",
        "Cristian: Why the hell not?",
        "Kim: Because you'll die.",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Kim: See, management, I kind of complained about the water bugs.",
        "Cristian: What water bugs?",
        "Kim: You don't even want to know. So anyway, the exterminator's in there and he's fumigating--",
        "Layla: Oh, my God, Aziza is in there. Move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Let me ask you a question. Why are you staying here? Seriously. Half the town thinks you're a drug addict. The other half thinks you're a pedophile. You've got no job, no support team. No--",
        "Schuyler: No family? 'Cause my mom killed herself?",
        "Rex: I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.",
        "Schuyler: Ha ha! No, you're right, you're right. I really don't have a lot going for me. No job other than the hours that I put in here. Now that I'm barred from seeing Gigi, I'm down to one friend. I don't have any family. You really--you really put a lot of thought into this, didn't you? You came all the way down here to share your insight with me. It's too bad you didn't put that kind of energy into your relationship with Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Nora, my TV show is what the networks call high concept. I don't know what that means, but talk loud and don't look directly into the camera.",
        "Nora: You know what? I don't want teamsters traipsing through my house.",
        "David: T\u00e9amsters. Technical term. Please, not on camera. And besides, this is a non-union shoot. Don't worry.",
        "Clint: Vickers?",
        "David: Yes, Uncle Clint?",
        "Clint: I don't think you heard my wife. She said get out.",
        "David: Dad, will you please explain to Uncle Clint that you and I have to spend quality time on camera?",
        "Bo: If you keep it up, I'm gonna give him his gun back.",
        "David: All I ever wanted was a father's love. Is that so much to ask?",
        "Clint: You had a father. His name was Ned Truman.",
        "David: And what did he teach me? How to count cards and deal from the bottom of the deck? A boy needs his father to teach him how to fish. Tell me, Matthew. Tell me the truth. Did our father Bo teach you all the things that a father should teach his son?",
        "Matthew: Like what?",
        "David: Like how to throw a baseball, what a balk is. What is a balk anyway?",
        "Matthew: It's complicated.",
        "David: No kidding. Did he teach you how to bait your own fishhook?",
        "Matthew: Sure.",
        "David: See, that's what I want. To be a son and big brother. To have a family. Is all of that really so much to ask?",

        "David: Nora, the Have-a-Seat money only goes so far, and with all of the legal bills...",
        "Clint: Really? Who's suing you now?",
        "David: Why, no one. Here's our hook. Ahem. Matthew's the one doing the suing, and I've been footing the legal bills.",

        "Ford: You've been doing what?",
        "David: Oh, relax. We'll get the money back when the show sells. Here, Markko, get this. I'm opening my heart to my television audience so that one day my horribly disfigured little brother might one day walk again, and if all goes well and the show sells, we might secure the movie rights. I will play myself. You will be played by Zac Efron.",

Look, Layla, I'm not stupid. I wouldn't do this in your living room. I wouldn't even do this period. I love you. I would never throw away what we have.",
