        "Dorian: Why, Viki, there you are! Lois let me in. Oh! Don't you look soign\u00e9e.",
        "Viki: Soign\u00e9e?",
        "Dorian: [Speaking French]",
        "Viki: Okay, Dorian, I get it. You're speaking French.",
        "Dorian: I'm just happy to see you. It's been so long.",
        "Viki: We saw each other at the library board meeting yesterday.",
        "Dorian: Oh, it seems ages ago. Hmm. Oh, my. I love--I mean really love--what you have done with this room.",
        "Viki: What I did with this room two years ago.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Well, it's taken me this long to really see it, but then again, my heart was shut down, and now all my senses are alive again. I mean, I can actually smell the deliciousness of those roses you've just cut and the new- mown grass and the sound of the birds in the trees.",
        "Viki: Dorian, have you been at the T\u00e9a again? Are you high?",
        "Dorian: [Speaking French] Yes, I'm high...on love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: No, no, no, you are not wearing that to my wedding.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I'm gonna change.",
        "David: My double wedding--me and Dorian, Eli and Blair--it is a classy event. None of that Little Nikita stuff you think is so hot.",
        "Kelly: Got it. Look. I need your help.",
        "David: Are you even listening? Today is my day. Don't you screw it up. Like talking to a chunk of cheese. And do not be late.",
        "Kelly: Just tell me where Blair is! David!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Dani?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: How you doing?",
        "Dani: Fine.",
        "Nate: You hear from your mom?",
        "Dani: Look. Can we not talk about my mom, okay? She's gone. She's not coming back.",
        "Nate: Got it.",
        "Dani: How's your mom? Did she start her new job?",
        "Nate: Yeah, which is good. She's gone all day. It's just when we're both home --I mean, it's just different. I've got these two brothers, and I don't even know them.",
        "Dani: Yeah, I remember what that was like.",
        "Nate: It's weird, right?",
        "Dani: It's gonna take some time. At least, it did for me.",
        "Matthew: Oh, towel boy?",
        "Nate: I got to go. You around later?",
        "Dani: Yeah. Yeah. Call me.",
        "Matthew: My ice melted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: You on a break?",
        "Destiny: No.",
        "Shaun: So why aren't you working?",
        "Destiny: Darren won't let me.",
        "Darren: My lady doesn't lift a finger, not while I'm around.",
        "Shaun: So what was so important that I had to come running right over?",
        "Destiny: Dani, and why you won't help her find her mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: How are you doing?",
        "Dani: Fine.",
        "Blair: You feel like coming to my wedding this afternoon?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: According to Hannah, Clarke was the one that pushed Marty down the stairs.",
        "Bo: And attacked Robert Ford.",
        "John: Ford was blackmailing him. Ford knew that Clarke was actually Bennett Thompson, so Clarke tried to kill him and then had him pin it on Hannah.",
        "Bo: What about the evidence that Kelly found in Clarke's room?",
        "Nora: The mug shot is inadmissible.",
        "Bo: Well, we probably don't need it. All it proves is that he has a record.",
        "Nora: If he's got a sheet, I want to see what's on it.",
        "Price: Dig in.",
        "Nora: Okay. Fellas, we don't have a lot of time here. If Elijah gets wind of what we're doing here, he'll blow dodge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I thought I told you to leave me alone.",
        "Inez: I got you a lawyer.",
        "Ford: I don't need a lawyer!",
        "Inez: You are in handcuffs, Bobby. Just talk to him. Please!",
        "Ford: Hello.",
        "Eli: Hello, Bobby. I hear you've been a bad boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: But you just got engaged.",
        "Blair: I know! That fianc\u00e9 of mine, you know--he's in a hurry, and who am I to deny him? He wants to make it legal. We love each other. We're happy. So why wait?",
        "Dani: You sound just like Todd when he talked my mom into marrying him.",
        "Blair: I know that that wedding made her very, very happy, Dani.",
        "Dani: So where are you going on your honeymoon?",
        "Blair: You know, we haven't even talked about it.",
        "Dani: At least you'll have one.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Hey, come on, let's go pick out a pretty dre--",
        "Dani: No, Blair, I can't go to your wedding. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I changed my mind. Just get me a can on ice.",
        "Nate: A can on ice?",
        "Matthew: You know, so it doesn't get all watery but it stays cold? Sorry, is there a problem? Do I need to talk to a manager?",
        "Nate: Why are you being such a bitch?",
        "Matthew: Come again?",
        "Nate: Ahem. Why...are you... being such...a bitch?",
        "Matthew: Okay, first of all, I don't know if they let you talk to guests like that, but that's one more thing on my list to talk to your managers about-- that along with how you're making your little personal calls to your girlfriend on company time.",
        "Nate: Now you're just embarrassing yourself.",
        "Matthew: Oh, Salinger, summer's not over yet, and I intend on making it as painful as possible for you. So get used to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Destiny: Yeah, you do, and it doesn't make any sense. You would never turn down a job like that, which tells me you're up to something.",
        "Darren: You have to get up pretty early to sneak one past my ladylove.",
        "Shaun: Son, you need to take a swim or shower or something. You're pathetic.",
        "Destiny: Don't change the subject.",
        "Shaun: I don't know what your friend told you.",
        "Destiny: Dani told me her dad came to you and asked you to help her find her mom. You said no.",
        "Shaun: T\u00e9a wants her privacy. That's why she went away.",
        "Destiny: And if it was our mom who was dying all alone and we just wanted to be with her?",
        "David: All right, all right. Homeslice Shaun, Little D, Dawson. Thank God I found you guys.",
        "Destiny: Now what?",
        "David: Big news. You're never gonna guess.",
        "Destiny: You're marrying Dorian.",
        "David: Oh, no, you didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Well, my goodness, this is sudden.",
        "Dorian: Currents of emotion run deep. Sometimes it just takes a little spark to ignite them.",
        "Viki: And short-circuit the whole system.",
        "Dorian: Love is a gift.",
        "Viki: Let's hope it keeps on giving.",
        "Dorian: If one is lucky.",
        "Viki: And who might the lucky man be? I'm going to assume that this time it's a man.",
        "Dorian: Touch\u00e9. David Vickers Buchanan.",
        "Viki: Oh, thank the Lord. And I can assume that he is returning your feelings?",
        "Dorian: That man got down on his knees and begged and pleaded with me to take him back.",
        "Viki: And you did.",
        "Dorian: Yes. And then he wanted more.",
        "Viki: Oh, too much information. Don't want details.",
        "Dorian: Oh, you want this detail: He proposed.",
        "Viki: You're getting married?",
        "Dorian: Yes! This afternoon, in a double wedding extravaganza, which, I tell you, just based on sheer impulsive passion, is gonna put all other weddings to shame.",
        "Viki: Which, of course, would be the point. And the other lucky couple?",
        "Dorian: My niece Blair and that charming, handsome lawyer fianc\u00e9 Elijah Clarke.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Price, you got all this from one mug shot?",
        "Price: Yeah. Soon as I punched in his booking number, the computer just started spitting it out.",
        "John: This man is Craig Pattison.",
        "Bo: I thought he was Bennett something or other.",
        "John: Says here Pattison was arrested in connection with the death of his wife.",
        "Nora: Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Was there a trial?",
        "John: He was charged and then released when the M.E. found out she died of natural causes.",
        "Nora: Let me guess, heart attack?",
        "John: Mmm.",
        "Bo: All right. So he was cleared, but he still has a sheet.",
        "Nora: Okay, so he changes his name to Bennett Thompson?",
        "John: That's the way it looks.",
        "Nora: All right. Well, all of this is very colorful, but it's not gonna get us a warrant. Changing your name is not evidence of wrongdoing, and the fact that we're in possession of this as a result of a crime--it's a non-starter.",
        "Bo: Do we have anything else?",
        "Nora: Yeah, I got Robert Ford. He's agreed to testify.",
        "Bo: Will his story hold up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: It's no big deal. I'll be out of here in an hour.",
        "Inez: Bobby.",
        "Ford: Shut up! They're just looking for some info about something else. It's no big deal. No need for you to get involved.",
        "Eli: That's not how I hear it. According to your mother, you've been singing your little heart out, Bobby.",
        "Ford: My mother. The woman you talked to has no idea what she's talking about. I haven't said anything.",
        "Eli: Well, I certainly hope not, Ford, because you and I have an agreement, and I am a man of my word. If you talk to the cops, your brother, your mother, even your little friend Langston--everybody you care about will die. And don't make the mistake, Ford, of thinking the police can protect you. Look at Hannah. Is that how you want to end up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Where are we?",
        "Nora: Well, we can keep digging, but Elijah is a flight risk.",
        "John: We need to lock him down.",
        "Nora: I say we go for the assault. I'll go to a judge. He'll get a warrant. We tie him up on attempted murder, and buy us some time.",
        "Bo: But do you think an arrest will stop him? I mean, he's an attorney.",
        "John: With a lot to hide.",
        "Nora: Well, yeah--two aliases. That means there's got to be more out there. I say we arraign him. Let's make it public, and while we're building a case, maybe someone else will come forward.",
        "John: What Kelly found--will that help you at trial?",
        "Nora: Well, I don't think it could hurt if we could follow it somewhere.",
        "Bo: It's tainted.",
        "John: If I can find a way around it?",
        "Nora: You do, and I'll eat my hat.",
        "Bo: Red, you don't wear hats.",
        "Nora: Well, you know what? For John, I'll buy one.",
        "John: I hope you're hungry. Price, you're with me. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: So we're on the same page?",
        "Ford: Yeah. Anything happens to anybody, I mail a certain letter.",
        "Eli: And I'm sure that'll be a great comfort to your mother.",
        "[Click]",
        "Inez: Is he coming?",
        "Ford: No. Don't you ever speak to him again, you understand me? And if you see him coming, you run the other way.",
        "Inez: I don't even know what he looks like.",
        "Ford: All the more reason for you to stay the hell out of my business!",
        "Inez: But you needed help.",
        "Ford: And you could have gotten me killed!",
        "Inez: What are you saying?",
        "Ford: Just get the hell out of here, okay?",
        "Inez: Bobby\u0097",
        "Ford: Leave me alone!",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Congratulations, Eli. I hear today is the happy day.",
        "Eli: Oh. I didn't know you approved.",
        "Kelly: It's not up to me.",
        "Eli: So then, that little heart-to-heart you had with my fianc\u00e9e--you know, the one where you told her you thought I was a murderer--that was just small talk, then?",
        "Kelly: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Eli: Blair and I have no secrets from each other, Kelly. She told me everything--that you think my name is Bennett Thompson and that I somehow gave your mother a heart attack and, oh, about the janitor in California and the file clerk in Boston. Do you know how deranged you sound?",
        "Kelly: John McBain didn't seem to think so.",
        "Eli: I'd be careful if I were you. You're slandering my reputation. I could bring you up on charges.",
        "Kelly: Or you could change your name and start over somewhere else. It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Eli: Back off, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Or what? You'll give me a heart attack, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You have to come to my wedding. It won't be the same without you.",
        "Dani: It's not that I don't want to, but I can't. I need to be here in case my dad finds my mom. He went to go find her and bring her home, and I have to be here. She'll need me.",
        "Blair: I know. Your dad called me, told me he was going out of town. He told me you were gonna be here, told me that you were gonna be waiting for his call. But he also told me that I needed to check in on you.",
        "Dani: I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: What are you sorry about? You know, just...I want your dad to find your mom. Oh, look at that. Money honey. I am so good at that game, and I am so gonna win.",
        "Dani: Don't you have to get ready for your wedding?",
        "Blair: I'm not getting married without you, beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Thanks for ruining my surprise, Destiny. I thought we were supposed to be BFFs.",
        "Destiny: What surprise? You blabbed it all over myface.",
        "David: Is nothing private anymore?",
        "Matthew: That's the point. You post stuff so everyone can see it.",
        "Darren: See, at first, I thought that you'd been hacked, because last I heard, you and the mayor were at daggers drawn.",
        "Destiny: Please. Those two? That's their idea of foreplay.",
        "Darren: Be still, my heart.",
        "Destiny: Somebody's been doing his summer reading.",
        "Darren: But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Destiny is my sun.",
        "David: That's just funky.",
        "Destiny: That's just Darren.",
        "Darren: And you love it. So, did you o'erleap her garden wall, David, or did her honor come after you?",
        "David: Need you ask, Darwin? When it comes to me, Dorian always comes crawling back for a little bit more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, Dorian, I don't want to put a damper on things, but the last I heard, you were seeing Clint and David was seeing some sort of model.",
        "Dorian: A swimsuit model...",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Who turns out to be a pro--yes, that David hired to make me jealous.",
        "Viki: Imagine that.",
        "Dorian: And Clint, well, he was just wining and dining me because he wanted the naming rights to the new football stadium.",
        "Viki: As if you could be bought.",
        "Dorian: That is what I said to him. And thank goodness all that foolishness is over and done with, and David and I are back together again, and we're getting married. And you know, believe it or not, the person we most have to thank for this is you.",
        "Viki: Dorian, is this really you under all this happiness?",
        "Dorian: Ah...are you sounding a little judgmental?",
        "Viki: Well, it's just that it's just not like you to apologize.",
        "Dorian: I wasn't apologizing.",
        "Viki: Oh, no, you're right. No, you're right, you weren't, because you don't do that. But at the same time, I just heard you thank me, and I've never heard those words before.",
        "Dorian: Thank you for nothing.",
        "Viki: Oh, no, no, no! Don't go! Please, Dorian. Please don't go. Please don't. See? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. See how easy that is? I'm sorry. I'm sorry? I'm sorry? What I really meant to say was, you have nothing to thank me for.",
        "Dorian: Au contraire. If it were not for that childish charade that you and Charlie perpetrated, well, David and I never would have gotten back together.",
        "Viki: But that's nonsense. You just admitted that you and David have been in love from time immemorial. It was only a matter of time before you found your way back to each other.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but if it were not for your desire for revenge, well, then, it could have taken us years and years to find our way back to each other.",
        "Viki: Revenge?",
        "Dorian: Oh, yes. It was the appalling sight of David in bed with you that brought me back to reality. And of course, you know all about that, having found me in bed with your Joey.",
        "Viki: Wow. That thought had never even occurred to me. But I think you're right, and I guess I deserved that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Listen up, you Neanderthals. It doesn't matter who made the first move. The point is, David and Dorian admitted the truth, and they're finally gonna put us all out of their misery.",
        "Shaun: Amen.",
        "David: And you're all invited to the wedding. Now, the ceremony will be held here at the lovely Llanview country club in one hour. So hit the showers. Ow.",
        "Shaun: I've got to be going.",
        "David: No, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere. This wedding celebration would not be complete without the Cramers' favorite family bodyguard. Plus it's gonna be a really big event. Someone will probably get shot. Matthew, listen, little bro. I really wanted you to be my best man, but pa insisted on it.",
        "Matthew: Oh. That's--that's okay.",
        "David: No, no, no. You cheer up. It's a double-billed wedding. Blair's marrying Elijah Clarke, so Danielle will be there. This is the perfect opportunity for you to show little Miss smarty-pants that you're over her by walking in with Miss Fawn on your arm...unless, of course, you still want to make another run for Miss smarty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Stop. You can't cancel your wedding.",
        "Blair: I'm not canceling it. I'm just postponing it.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but I don't want to be the reason that you postpone.",
        "Blair: Listen. Your dad told me to come check on you, and I'm so not gonna leave you here while I'm off sipping champagne.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but Uncle Eli\u0097",
        "Blair: He will understand. We love each other. He loves me. I love him. He'll completely understand if we have to wait just a little while--you know, until your dad finds your mom. Believe me, there is not a mean bone in Uncle Eli's body.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Hostile and paranoid. Whew! Then again, your mother was crazy, wasn't she? Are you following in her footsteps, Kelly? I certainly hope not, because you're a real catch--very attractive. If only you weren't so angry.",
        "Kelly: You know, it really is unlike Blair to play a fool.",
        "Eli: She wasn't fooled by any of the malicious lies you told her, Kelly. Luckily, she trusts me more than she trusts you.",
        "Kelly: Like I said, a fool.",
        "Eli: All right. Now you're just being rude, because Blair loves you, you know. She's concerned about you. And I'm sure she and Dorian would spare no expense if it came to institutionalizing you.",
        "Kelly: Ho ho ho! Are you calling me crazy? I must be so crazy that I can see right through your act.",
        "Eli: What act? Kelly, the only thing I did was fall in love with your cousin.",
        "Kelly: Really? You're after her money.",
        "Eli: What do I need money for? I have a very successful practice.",
        "Kelly: Oh, really? I think you're trying to break into the big leagues, and you'll kill anyone who stands in your way.",
        "Eli: And you have proof of this? Right. No, you don't. So if I were you, I'd let it go. Besides, as far as Blair is concerned, you're the killer, not me. Yeah, she told me about that unfortunate incident where you killed her unborn child.",
        "Kelly: Oh, man. You would bring that up, wouldn't you? But then again, that's because you are feeling so desperate.",
        "Eli: I'm not the desperate one, Kelly. You are, throwing around these wild accusations about me. If there were any proof to any of them, John McBain would be on my doorstep right now with a warrant for my arrest.",
        "John: Hi. The door was open.",
        "Kelly: You were saying? Do it, John. Arrest him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Inez: Do you have a minute?",
        "Bo: Yeah, sure. Come on in. Is something wrong?",
        "Inez: Yeah. I just found out that my son Robert has been arrested. He's handcuffed to a table in the interrogation room.",
        "Bo: I just found out about that myself. And that's standard procedure--you know, the handcuffs. I was just about to come and get you. Here, why don't you please sit down?",
        "Inez: You know, they won't even tell me why they're holding him.",
        "Bo: Well, we're trying to work things out right now, and if Robert cooperates, which we expect, he'll be free to go within an hour.",
        "Inez: Okay. So what do I do? I don't have to hire the lawyer that I called?",
        "Bo: No. No, no. You didn't pay him anything?",
        "Inez: No, I mean, I--no. I just told him the little that I did know, and then I put him in touch with Bobby.",
        "Bo: So your son talked to a lawyer?",
        "Inez: Yeah, but he won't need him, though, right? That's the plan? You're gonna release him, which I really hope that you do because I can't afford Elijah Clarke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Mr. Ford? You remember me, don't you--the district attorney, Nora Buchanan? I understand you've made a statement to one of my officers and he's asked that you write it down and sign it. Is it finished?",
        "Ford: No.",
        "Nora: Okay. Um...Mr. Ford, my office is preparing an arrest warrant for Elijah Clarke based on your statements, but we can't proceed without your cooperation.",
        "Ford: Uh, I'm sorry. I can't sign it.",
        "Nora: Why not?",
        "Ford: It's a lie, all of it.",
        "Nora: Mr. Ford, you told Detective McBain that Elijah Clarke fractured your skull.",
        "Ford: No. Um, that was Hannah O'Connor. She's the one that attacked me.",
        "Nora: Mr. Ford, did Elijah Clarke threaten you?",
        "Ford: No.",
        "Nora: Then why are you recanting the statement that you just gave the officer?",
        "Ford: I'm--I'm sorry. I can't sign this statement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Cuff him. You don't even have to read him his rights.",
        "John: Kelly Cramer, you're under arrest.",
        "Bo: John? Hold off. Don't go near Clarke until I talk to Ford.",
        "Price: Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk...",
        "John: Too late.",
        "Bo: Clarke knows we're holding Ford.",
        "Nora: I knew it.",
        "John: That's too bad.",
        "Bo: All right. From what I gather, he doesn't know why. So we may be able to cover it.",
        "John: I hear you.",
        "Nora: I just came from Ford. He recanted.",
        "Bo: Damn it!",
        "Nora: What happened? How in the world did Elijah Clarke find out we had Ford in custody?",
        "Inez: It's my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Why the hell am I being arrested?",
        "Eli: Yeah, I'd like to know the same thing myself.",
        "John: You're under arrest for breaking into Eli's hotel room.",
        "Eli: What? When the hell did this happen?",
        "John: Yesterday management informed us that you were caught on tape breaking into the room.",
        "Eli: Yesterday? That's why I was called down to the front desk. The clerk said I had a visitor. I went downstairs. No one was there. I don't think anything was taken, but, Kelly, why would you do such a thing?",
        "John: She thinks you killed her mother.",
        "Eli: Well, John, that is just ridiculous. I don't even know the woman. I thought she died of a heart attack.",
        "John: That's what the M.E. said.",
        "Eli: So wait a second. You took Kelly seriously?",
        "John: She didn't agree with my conclusions, and apparently she didn't follow my advice to drop the matter.",
        "Eli: Wow. Blair had mentioned that her behavior had grown a bit erratic, but I never dreamed it was anything like this. It's so sad, really. Like mother, like daughter.",
        "John: Yeah. Here you go. Detective Price, would you escort Ms. Cramer out?",
        "Price: Yeah.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Eli: Detective, one more thing. You arrested a client of mine--Robert Ford, I believe?",
        "John: No, he was cut loose. The commissioner just mentioned something about that.",
        "Eli: Oh. They dropped the charges?",
        "John: There was no charge.",
        "Eli: Then I don't understand. Why was he being held in the first place?",
        "John: Oh, he said he had some information about a drug dealer at the L.U. campus.",
        "Eli: Oh.",
        "Kelly: John, what's going on?",
        "John: You know what to do.",
        "Price: All right. I'll be in touch.",
        "Kelly: Are you seriously arresting me?",
        "John: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: For what it's worth, David had a very similar reaction when he saw you with Charlie.",
        "Dorian: Not quite. Yes, he was furious enough and staged that preposterous scene in your bedroom, but he would never have gone through with it. You are not his type. I'm his type. You...are not.",
        "Viki: Dorian, just be careful.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha! What's important is David belongs to me and Charlie belongs with you. So it's win-win. Now, then, I hope the two of you will come to our wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Hold on. Fawn's holding her 8:00 open. You want me to book it, or are you gonna take another run at Miss smarty?",
        "Matthew: Miss smarty could rotate for all I care. As long as she doesn't bring that loser she's dating, I could care less.",
        "David: Never mind. Wait a second. I thought you said that you and the loser had turned a corner.",
        "Matthew: Hey, I tried to be nice to the guy, but let's just say he's a jerk. Plus I wouldn't want my big bro's day to be ruined.",
        "David: Thanks, little bro. See? Now, that's caring. Let's see. Hey! Pool boy! You ever been to a big society wedding?",
        "Nate: No, sir.",
        "David: Well, today is your lucky day. You're gonna be Miss smarty's plus one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: If you're just trying to guilt me...",
        "Blair: I am not, really. If this is where you feel that you need to be, well, this is where I belong.",
        "Dani: Look, I appreciate your offer, I really do, but you need to go marry Uncle Eli.",
        "Blair: I will.",
        "Dani: Today. Look. I'll be okay alone for a couple hours. Besides, you don't want me there, anyway. I'd just bring everybody down.",
        "Blair: No, you wouldn't.",
        "Dani: Yes, I would. I'm a reminder to everyone. And no one wants to go there, especially not at a wedding.",
        "Blair: Well, since my cousin Kelly is gonna be there, anyway, downer is already on the menu. I swear that girl is just a dark cloud walking.",
        "Dani: So then you'll have your hands full and you won't need to deal with me, too.",
        "Blair: Okay. Obviously I can't say anything to change your mind or cheer you up, so...if you really want to stay here, I'll go off and marry your Uncle Eli, all right? And then we'll come back after our reception and check on you.",
        "Dani: What about your honeymoon?",
        "Blair: Honeymoon? Did you say \"honeymoon\"? See, we took care of that little tidbit a long time ago. Yeah, that's one of the reasons I married your Uncle Eli, because every night with him...",
        "Dani: Oh! Okay! Stop! Stop! Too much information.",
        "Blair: Look at that, though. At least I made you smile. I'll go, and you can stay here. But listen. If you do change your mind, just know that your dad will call. He'll call you and reach you wherever you are. So you're not gonna miss a thing, okay?",
        "Dani: I miss her so much.",
        "Blair: Oh, baby, I know. I know. I do, too. I do, too.",
        "Dani: No. No, no, no. You can't cry. You can't have puffy eyes on your wedding day.",
        "Blair: Hey. You know your mom would probably have a huge laugh if she knew that I was even shedding a tear over her.",
        "Dani: You mean a lot to my mom. She wouldn't have asked you to, you know, look after me if she didn't love you.",
        "Blair: We've come a long way, Dani. We were mortal enemies, and...and now we're really close friends. Okay. You know what? I have to get to my wedding. I cannot be late for my wedding.",
        "Dani: Well, they can't start without you.",
        "Blair: Oh, you don't know Aunt Dorian. She probably would. You want me to give a message to Nate?",
        "Dani: Nate?",
        "Blair: Yeah, Nate. He works at the country club. That's where the wedding's gonna be. Hmm? Listen. I read the complete Dani file cover to cover. So I know all about Nathaniel Q. Salinger. So maybe you might just want to give me a message I can pass on to him, or maybe you want to change your mind and come along.",
        "Dani: Maybe we should go find me a dress.",
        "Blair: That is my girl! Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: So, what time should I be here for the ceremony?",
        "David: Well, it starts at\u0097",
        "Matthew: Get over here. Uh, earth to David. That's Nate.",
        "David: Nate who?",
        "Matthew: Nate, the guy who stole Dani.",
        "David: I thought you said he was ugly. He's your average good-looking person.",
        "Matthew: The point is you're my brother. You're supposed to have my back.",
        "David: You're right. I'm sorry. You're uninvited.",
        "Destiny: Way to be the bigger person, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: He'll still be at the wedding--serving us.",
        "Nate: I'm not embarrassed by my job.",
        "Matthew: Well, you should be. I mean, you're picking up dirty dishes in front of Dani.",
        "Nate: So what are you saying? Destiny should be embarrassed about her job, too?",
        "Darren: Not cool, dude.",
        "Nate: And why does everyone think Matthew is so cool? He goes out of his way to make people feel bad.",
        "Matthew: I thought you weren't embarrassed by your job.",
        "Nate: I'm not talking about myself. Danielle's totally fragile right now, and if you try to embarrass me, you're only gonna upset her.",
        "Matthew: Dani can take care of herself.",
        "Nate: Her mother's dying.",
        "Matthew: Good lie.",
        "Destiny: No, it's true.",
        "Matthew: S-since when?",
        "Nate: She has an inoperable brain tumor. She just told Dani good-bye and left for some hospice somewhere. Dani doesn't even know where she is. So go ahead, drop your napkins all over the floor; shout at me to bring you ice, clear your plates, whatever. I can clean up after you and take care of Danielle. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.",
        "Matthew: Why didn't you tell me this?",
        "Destiny: And spoil your fun? Excuse me. I have work to do, too.",
        "Darren: It's a wise man who knows he's a fool.",
        "David: Leave it to T\u00e9a to upstage my wedding. Dorian's not gonna like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You want Charlie and me at your wedding?",
        "Dorian: It wouldn't be the same without you.",
        "Viki: Oh, my goodness. Uh...I'll have to obviously run this by Charlie. When is the big day?",
        "Dorian: This afternoon.",
        "Viki: Oh, of course it is. You said that. Yes, you did say that. You're getting married this afternoon?",
        "Dorian: Barring any unforeseen circumstances. Of course, I do have contingency plans to cover just about anything. But then again, I am the mayor. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Price: Clarke just left.",
        "John: Listen. Don't let him see you, and don't lose him.",
        "Price: All right. I got it.",
        "Kelly: You want to tell me why you are arresting me?",
        "John: It's the only way Nora can use the evidence that you collected. It's the only way she can get a warrant against Clarke and go after him.",
        "Kelly: Okay. All right. Would you take the cuffs off me, please?",
        "John: Sit tight.",
        "Kelly: John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: My God, do you know what you've done? You torpedoed a major case. Because of you, a serial murderer could go free!",
        "Bo: Hey, honey, Inez had no way of knowing about this. She was trying to do right by her son, just like we would Matthew.",
        "John: I take it this has something to do with Clarke?",
        "Nora: Oh, yes, and Hannah O'Connor and Robert Ford and Melinda Cramer and Rodney Gilbert and Glen Carlin--",
        "Inez: I am so sorry.",
        "Bo: It's okay, Inez. Listen. Why don't you take a break, okay? This is my fault. I should have brought her right into the loop when we picked up Robert Ford.",
        "John: What the hell happened?",
        "Nora: Well, apparently, Bo's lovely new assistant is the mother of Robert Ford, and when she got wind of the fact of Ford's being in custody, she hired a lawyer.",
        "John: Eli Clarke.",
        "Nora: Bingo! And now we--",
        "John: Ford recanted.",
        "Nora: Bingo. And now we got nothing. Nothing. No way to get an arrest warrant.",
        "John: What about the evidence that Kelly found?",
        "Bo: It's a start.",
        "Nora: I hope it's enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Gosh, Dorian, I don't know. For now, I'll have to say it's a definite...maybe?",
        "Dorian: I'll take that as a definite... [Speaking French] Now, then, excuse me. I have a million things to do.",
        "Viki: Dorian? Wait. Very, very, very best wishes.",
        "Dorian: Thank you, Viki.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God, there are those words again.",
        "Dorian: David and I are registered online. Don't stint. This is gonna be my last wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Destiny? I'm really sorry.",
        "Destiny: Yes, you are.",
        "Matthew: I don't know what happens to me when I'm around that guy. I just can't help myself.",
        "Destiny: Then just zip it. I mean it, Matthew. You're a mess!",
        "Matthew: Have you talked to Dani? Is she all right?",
        "Destiny: How is she all right? Her mother is dying!",
        "David: Yes, yes, that's terribly tragic and all, but we have a wedding to attend--mine. Dagwood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: All right. I'm going to see Judge Runyon. See if I can scare up a warrant.",
        "Bo: Good luck.",
        "Nora: I'll need it.",
        "John: Not if I can get Ford to come around.",
        "Nora: Really? And how are you going to do that, John, really? I mean, it's obvious that Clarke threatened him. Clarke put him in the hospital once. What do you think Clarke's gonna do if he thinks Ford gave him up?",
        "John: It's a long shot, but I've got one more card to play.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Never a dull moment over at Casa Cramer.",
        "Destiny: You know? You should go back to working for Snoop Dogg. It's safer. Hey, I'd hug you, but I'd wrinkle you. You look amazing. Are you here for the wedding?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Destiny: Dani, you remember my brother Shaun.",
        "Dani: Yeah, I know who he is. You refused to help my dad find my mom. You want to tell me why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I assume this means I can go?",
        "John: No, not yet.",
        "Kelly: Come on. Are you serious, John?",
        "John: I don't like it any more than you do, but you're right. I need your help. I can't bust Eli without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Eli! What are you doing? It's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony.",
        "Eli: There's been a change of plans."
