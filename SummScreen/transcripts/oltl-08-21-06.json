        "lair is at a loss for words. The whole room waits for her answer. \"Yes,\" she says. Spencer tells all that he had to go to his safety deposit box that night to get it. John and Natalie wonder now if that is all that he went to the box for. Later, Blair and Spencer hug and she rummages in his pocket and gets the keys without him noticing. She rushes off and gives them to John and Natalie who sneak out to see what is in the safety deposit box. Todd can't deal with Blair marrying Spencer. Spencer gloats and goes to get his fiancee smiling meanly at Todd. Todd clears off a table and stands on it. 'I want to make a toast! To Spencer who tried to set me up to get killed for murdering a pregnant, so that he could marry that whore over there.\" He holds a knife to his chest but then does nothing with it. John and Natalie head to the bank and Natalie pretends she is going to throw up so the bank employee rushes off for a bucket. They open Spencer's box Langston brings Starr what she has asked for. It is information that she has printed off to continue faking her amnesia. She has to research this in order to fool Spencer into thinking that she is really ill. Lindsay has had a few too many and she is sarcastic to Nora that second that she sees her at the gala. RJ says Nora looks nice and that is enough to set Lindsay off. \"Why don't you just kiss her again?\" To get back at RJ, Lindsay goes to the first man that she sees, (Michael), and she lays a big hot juicy one on him. Marcie freaks out. She thought that Lindsay was her friend. \"I only did it as he was the first man I saw. He is a good kisser though.\" Marcie rushes off to have a shower now that she knows that Lindsay has put her mouth on Michael. RJ gets mad, but the truth is that Lindsay loves seeing passion finally from the man. \"You want to see passion?\" he asks. He goes to Nora and bends her over kissing her hand on the lips. \"Why do you keep doing that?\" Lindsay asks. Nora would like to know that too. Later while talking alone with Claudia, Nora says that she is starting to have feelings for something that she shouldn't and it is all wrong. Claudia says that she knows exactly what that feels like. Todd isn't ready to go and so he sits staring at Spencer and Blair. Spencer wants to continue their celebrating upstairs. He walks ahead of Blair. Blair stalls now, getting up slowly. \"Damn you John,\" she says under her breath. \"I need that damn key!\""

        "Spencer: This is a very important evening for the hospital. But it also happens to be a very important evening for me, as well.

        "Claudia: Remember the person I was before you left me? She was a nice girl, wasn't she? You weren't just trying to set me up. I know that you really had feelings for me. Didn't you? Didn't you?",
        "Nash: What are you trying to do? Hmm? What are you doing?",
        "Claudia: I'm just -- I'm trying to convince myself that everything that happened wasn't for nothing.",
        "Nash: Well, stop it. God, how many times do I got to tell you that --",
        "Claudia: If you tell me your heart belongs to Tess one more me, I will scream so loud, they will shut this place down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You don't want to finish your bottle? How come? Hmm? [Phone rings] Oh. Ok, let's get the phone. Let's get the phone, ok? Whoa. Hello? Oh, Antonio, hi. Where are you? Yep. I forgot, you're a vice cop. I can't ask those kind of questions anymore. Yeah, no, we're ok. Everything's fine. Oh, new guy has to work late, huh? Well, it's ok. You be careful. Love you. Ok. Let's see what this book says about little girls who don't want to finish their bottle, ok?",
        "Nash: According to this book, in your second trimester, you should start to feel pretty great -- that's where you're at right now, second trimester.",
        "Tess: You read this already?",
        "Nash: Well, you know, I had to kill a little time while the guy was getting all this stuff ready, so -- want to know what else it says?",
        "Tess: I don't know.",

        "Langston: They told me at the nurses' station that you were asleep.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? This place is way too noisy to sleep. People are constantly coming in and out checking if I'm alive or not. Did you get what I asked for? Did you read it?",
        "Langston: Yeah, but I forgot what it said.",
        "Starr: That's not funny.",
        "Langston: It was. Printouts about amnesia? Forgot what it said? Don't you laugh anymore?",
        "Starr: This is serious, Langston. Is there anything important in there that I need to know in order to fake out the doctors?",
        "Langston: Nothing special. There's a broad spectrum of causes.",
        "Starr: Good. That means they're clueless.",
        "Langston: What's the point of all this?",
        "Starr: Duh -- if my parents are worried enough about me, maybe they'll realize how much in love they still are.",
        "Langston: You think?",
        "Starr: It already seems to be working.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Did Blair tell you that they were talking about marriage?",
        "John: I don't think she had a clue about any of this.",
        "Spencer: Blair couldn't understand why I wanted to stop by my safe-deposit box on the way over here. Can't really have an engagement without a ring, though, right?",
        "Natalie: The ring -- he went to go get the ring. He didn't take the gun.",
        "John: It's still there.",
        "Blair: I don't really know what to say.",
        "Spencer: It's very simple, honey. You just say yes.",

        "Todd: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Viki: I had no idea that Blair was discussing marriage with Spencer.",
        "Todd: Not just discussing it. The bitch is doing it. And now, thanks to you, they got a nice laugh tonight about me saying, \"honey, can we have a little talk? I'm getting out of here.",
        "Viki: Todd --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I can't believe it.",
        "Paige: Has Blair lost her mind?",
        "David: Absolutely. After everything he's done, he gets exactly what he wants. He always wins.",
        "Paige: Well, not for long. Bo's not going to stop until he brings him down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I need to speak to Blair. You think you can distract Truman for a minute?",
        "Natalie: Absolutely.",

        "Natalie: I need to talk to you.",
        "Spencer: What is your problem?",
        "Natalie: Todd is my uncle.",
        "Spencer: Well, my sympathies, Natalie.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I had no idea that he was going to do this in front of everyone here.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: She is worth it. Let's get some champagne, come on. What's going on with those two? Were you getting the same thing from John I was getting from Natalie?",
        "Blair: Spencer, I think everyone is surprised by your little announcement tonight, especially me.",
        "Spencer: Yeah? I hope I didn't upset you.",
        "Blair: No. You hinted that it was going to be a -- an important event, and I should have known that that's what you had in mind.",
        "Spencer: Well, I didn't know exactly. It was sort of impulsive. Blair, listen, I've always been a fairly private person. I have. But for some reason, I just felt compelled to share the most important moment of my life with other people, that's all.",
        "Blair: You seemed pretty sure that I was going to say yes.",
        "Spencer: You know what sealed the deal, don't you? When I made up my mind? It's when you insisted on -- on sewing this button on my Jacket before we left. I mean, it was just such a -- a sweet and simple gesture.",
        "Blair: Well, I am just full of those.",
        "Spencer: Yeah?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I can't wait to marry you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, that book is absolutely no help. Why can't they have a book that'll help me explain why I'm remembering things about Nash and Tess? You know, Dr. Jamison says that it's a good thing, but it's confusing me. I love Antonio. I love him. I don't want to know how Tess felt or who she loved. I know one thing for sure. I'm going to raise you right, so when you grow up, you're not going to have any of these problems, ok? I promise. Hey. I know why you're off food. You have a fever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You don't want to hear me say that my heart belongs to Tess?",
        "Claudia: No, I don't.",
        "Nash: Well, maybe you better stop hanging around me, because when it comes to the subject of Tess, my heart is like a broken record.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well, here we are. Can I get you ladies something to drink?",
        "Nora: No, I will fend for myself from now on. It was just nice enough for you guys to bring me. Thank you.",
        "Marcie: We were happy to do it.",
        "Nora: Well, you're newlyweds, you know, so --",
        "Marcie: Actually, we might be parents very soon.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Michael: Foster parents -- to a little boy named Tommy. We put the paperwork in last week. We're just waiting to hear back.",
        "Nora: Oh. That's wonderful. I'm so -- oh, that's wonderful. Well, even more reason why you should be on your own tonight. Because the next time you go out, you may have to call a sitter.",
        "Marcie: Well, I think we'll be ok with that.",
        "Nora: Well, you know, you can always call me, because I'm very good at sitting.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, you know, we might just take you up on that, Nora.",
        "Nora: Oh, of course. Ok, your last official act as my doctor tonight -- will you help me stand up?",

        "Nora: I almost took my dress with me. Thank you. Oh, gosh. Marcie, how do I look? No, seriously. Seriously, how do look?",
        "Marcie: I think every woman in this place better hold on to her man. That's what I think.",
        "Nora: You know you're such a liar.",
        "Marcie: No, I'm not.",
        "Nora: Yes, you are.",
        "Marcie: You look beautiful.",

        "Spencer: Can I see it?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Spencer: The ring. I want to see how it looks on your beautiful little hand there. What's going on here? It's like a vice. Loosen up a little bit.",
        "Blair: No, I'm fine.",
        "Spencer: What are you doing?",
        "Blair: I'm not, you know --",

        "Todd: Not really much to talk about, you know. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: This better work. I do not want to marry that son of a bitch.",
        "John: I'll get a copy made and get it right back to you.",
        "Blair: Ok, he's watching my every move. Thinks I'm headed to the ladies' room.",
        "John: As far as getting married to this guy, I'm not going to another wedding.",
        "Blair: Just find what you need in the safe-deposit box.",

        "Langston: So how long do you think you can keep this up?",
        "Starr: The amnesia bit? As long as I have to.",
        "Langston: It could get hairy.",
        "Starr: I haven't been able to get through to either one of my parents for months. Now I have the power.",
        "Langston: What power?",
        "Starr: I got them to kiss and hold hands, all in one day. I figure if I fake brain dame now, I'll have them running off to do it.",
        "Langston: Ew.",
        "Starr: Look, it's either that, or I'll have Dr. Truman as a stepfather.",
        "Langston: But you keep saying your parents hate each other's guts.",
        "Starr: Spencer made that happen. Everything was fine until he came to town. My parents were getting married again. And this time, for good. We were going to be ok. Really ok. I just have to make them remember that now.",
        "Langston: One question.",
        "Starr: Shoot.",
        "Langston: This Truman guy's a doctor. A good one, right?",
        "Starr: If \"good\" means \"homicidal.\"",
        "Langston: How do you know he's not going to figure you out?",
        "Starr: That's why I made you do the research. He already thinks I'm up to something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Oh, hello, Paige. Hey. David, how are you doing? What a pleasant surprise.",
        "David: Well, you didn't think we'd miss your big night, did you, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: I didn't think you could afford the tickets.",
        "Paige: Well, it would be worth going into debt just to see you up there proposing to Blair.",
        "David: Knowing how much she's going to hate you once she finds out all the evil things that you've done.",
        "Spencer: Well, now, listen, David, I haven't done anything wrong. We both know that. But even if I had, unlike you two, I would know how to cover my tracks.",
        "Paige: Well, arrogant people make mistakes. Bo and John Mc Bain -- they hate arrogance.",
        "David: You shouldn't have put that bullet in Mc Bain's father.",
        "Spencer: I didn't shoot anybody, David, you did. You so much as admitted it in a court of law.",
        "David: Mc Bain did a ballistics test on the gun that I was holding that night. The slug didn't match what they pulled out of Mc Bain's father.",
        "Paige: I told Bo that you set him up, that you set Todd up.",
        "Spencer: Oh. Nobody believes anything you have to say anymore.",
        "Paige: Huh. You know, the funny thing about having absolutely nothing to lose is that people tend to listen when you talk.",
        "David: It's over, Spencer. You got sloppy. And pretty soon, Blair is going to drop you like a -- starts with a B.",
        "Spencer: Bunch of bricks?",

        "Mr. Sharp: If you can come back tomorrow morning, I'll handle this personally.",
        "John: Ooh.",
        "Natalie: Bank wasn't willing to bend the rules. I mean, you know --",

        "Lindsay: \"Friend\"? Right. Is that why you've been fawning all over her since we got here?",
        "R.J.: There was no fawning. I was complimentary. I said she looks beautiful, and -- and you do.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, thank you, R.J. That's very nice of you.",
        "Lindsay: Do you know in the beginning, when R.J. would come to visit you in the hospital, I was there right next to him. I came every single time. And then one day, you came to and batted your eye at him, and all of a sudden, he didn't want me to come anymore, because he thought my being there would be awkward.",
        "R.J.: Lindsay, watch your mouth.",
        "Lindsay: I catch you kissing -- I -- I catch you kissing another woman, and you want me to watch my mouth? How would you like to see me kissing another man?",
        "R.J.: Well, I would not start drinking and then make up a federal case out of it!",

        "Langston: That's not good.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but I played it off pretty well, but the thing is, is that it seemed like he was trying to figure out whether I was faking or not. And when it comes to faking, he's an expert.",

That man right there, our esteemed Dr. Truman -- he helped a pregnant woman fake her own death and he set me up for murder. And you want to know why he did that? For that whore in that white dress sitting next to him. That was my son! That was my child! I have a son somewhere -- I don't know where he is. What else would you like me to do?",

At first, I thought Mr. Manning was simply imploding, but now I can see that this was a nasty little conspiracy by three very poor, pathetic individuals, and Blair and I are not going to spend our engagement like this.
