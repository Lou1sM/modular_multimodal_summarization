        "Starr goes to have her ultrasound and later has lunch with Blair and Marcie. The three of them are ready to agree to all be a part of the baby's life. But not everybody is ok with that. Cole somehow seems to know that something is going on behind his back. And Todd threatens the nurse with blackmail, informing her that he knows her son got in trouble and he can send him back to prison if she does not \"cooperate\" with him. Meanwhile, Jared attempts to get into the good graces of Clint. Clint tells Jared they might be able to work together in order to overthrow Dorian. But it might involve some \"dirty business\" involving taking Langston from her. Tina seems to know how to make Sara and Cristian appreciate her when she shows them how she can help Antonio get Talia back. But she senses something is \"not normal\" about Jessica. Tess is really there and she rips into Tina with hostile abusive verbiage that her aunt knows is not who Jessica really is. And Tess also \"displays\" that she is not the real Jessica when she goes to the OB-GYN clinic and causes a scene, when Todd overhears her."

        "Tina: [Scoffs] Look, Jessica, I know you're upset right now, but all I was going to do is let David Vickers sniff around that basement. What's wrong with that?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] What's wrong? He pees on things. He -- he has fleas. Listen, just keep him on a leash, keep him off the counter, and keep him out of my way.",
        "Tina: But you used to love dogs. I mean, you were always bothering your parents to get you a dog.",
        "Tess: Okay, that's not a dog. That's a rodent. And if you want to let him down in the basement, that's fine. Let a big rat bite him, then he won't come back.",
        "Tina: Don't ever talk to my dog that way. What has gotten into you?",
        "Tess: Nobody invited you here, Tina, let alone your little David Vickers' namesake. Listen, Lois is on vacation, and I'm not going to be cleaning up after you, okay? And I'm sure as hell not going to be cleaning up that one's --",
        "Tina: Hey, hey. Nobody ever asked you to.",
        "Tess: Look, you came here to get a free ride off my mother, and she's not here. So why don't you just go and sleep on your daughter's couch, if Sarah even wants you.",
        "Tina: This is my home, too, and Natalie and Jared told me to make myself at home.",
        "Tess: Of course they did. Of course they did. You suck up to them every chance you get, and Natalie hasn't figured out that you're going to hop into bed with her little boy toy quicker than she can say uncle.",
        "Tina: You know, Viki's heart would be broken if she knew that you were talking to her sister like this.",
        "Tess: Please, it's not even her heart, lady.",
        "Tina: Look, I know you're upset. I know you're mad at the world, but this is not the Jessica that I know and love.",
        "Tess: You never loved me, Tina.",
        "Tina: I love you enough to be worried about you. I'm going to call your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: I'm so glad we could wait with you at the gate.",
        "Antonio: One of the perks of being on the Llanview P.D. I get to keep my badge, even if I am on a leave of absence.",
        "Carlotta: Well, you're doing what you think is right. That's just how your Papi is.",
        "Antonio: I'm sorry I'm leaving you again. I'll be back soon. I promise, okay? Mami, I'm sorry that I have to leave during this whole mess at the diner.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, it's okay. There's nothing to be done except wait for the claim to be paid.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, okay. You know, I want you to think about a souvenir you want me to bring back from Mendorra.",
        "Jamie: I want you to bring Talia home.",
        "Antonio: Come here. You are the most special girl in the whole, wide world. I have the best family a man could ever, ever want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Clint, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to help Natalie get welcomed back into this family, even if she needs to prove herself to earn your love.",
        "Clint: No, she doesn't. But she keeps on telling me that she's part of a package deal, which includes you. Therefore, Natalie and I have a bit of a problem.",
        "Jared: So I do a little mercenary work for you, and all is forgiven?",
        "Clint: Oh, my God. Please don't act as if you're on some sort of moral high ground, okay? Do you want a job or not?",
        "Jared: Fine. I'm in. What exactly do you want me to do?",
        "Clint: Well, if we're ever going to get this company back from Dorian, we're going to have to do to her what you helped her do to us.",
        "Jared: Which means...",
        "Clint: Hit her where she lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hey, how'd it go?",
        "Markko: Oh, I just finished filling out this application, and they said they'd call me for an interview if they were interested.",
        "Langston: Why wouldn't they be interested?",
        "Markko: Everybody from the diner is applying here.",
        "Langston: Well, I'd pick you.",
        "Markko: Thanks. So what questions do they ask when all I'd be doing is getting towels and helping hot chicks in bikinis put suntan lotion in places they can't reach?",
        "Langston: Oh, really? Is that so?",
        "[Langston laughs]",
        "Markko: Oh, sorry, did you want this?",
        "Langston: Yes, I did.",
        "Markko: Yo, man.",
        "Cole: Hey, what's up, guys?",
        "Langston: Hey, Cole.",
        "Markko: You a member?",
        "Cole: No, Nora dragged me here.",
        "Markko: Where is she?",
        "Cole: She's parking the car. She wants to grill me about my college plans.",
        "Markko: You got plans?",
        "Cole: Yeah, just get as far away from Starr as I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I -- I want to thank you again for asking me to join you. I just -- I can't stop looking at that little nose.",
        "Starr: Looks like an alien, right?",
        "Blair: You think it does? There was a picture of Starr in one of her sonograms, where you were sucking your thumb. And that's when I knew I had this real human being right inside me.",
        "Starr: Yeah?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Starr: Well, I know.",
        "Marcie: Starr, I -- I asked your mom a question while you were in the doctor's office. I probably should've asked you, I should've talked to you about it first --",
        "Starr: Okay, what?",
        "Marcie: Well, I told her, as far as I'm concerned, that she's welcome to be a grandmother to the baby.",
        "Starr: You did?",
        "Blair: I did not give her an answer yet.",
        "Starr: Wow. Wow.",
        "Marcie: Uh, well, what I haven't asked is, do you want to be a part of the baby's life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I want my grandchild. And you're going to make sure I get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I guess that's something we should've talked about a long time ago.",
        "Marcie: Whatever you want to do, Starr, that is completely up to you. I just -- I just wanted you to know that I am fine with you being in the baby's life.",
        "Blair: You don't have to give any answers today, sweetheart. You've got months to figure this out, okay?",
        "Starr: More like two months, Mom. And I think that Mrs. McBain has a right to know what to expect.",
        "Marcie: You are letting me adopt your child, Starr. I think you can call me Marcie.",
        "Starr: Okay, Marcie. When you ran away with Sam, I know that we felt that Sam should be with my dad because of blood and everything. But I so get now that you were his mother. And -- and my dad didn't think about what was best for Sam. He just, you know, did what he wanted.",
        "Blair: Uh, you know, Starr, I kind of feel like I need to come to your dad's defense here. At the time, your dad didn't know where Sam was, he was looking for him, and he wanted him. You know, we didn't want to confuse Sam either.",
        "Starr: I don't want to confuse -- I don't want to confuse this baby. Of course, I love this baby so much, and I do want to be a part of his or her life, but I also want what's best for the baby.",
        "Marcie: Honey, why wouldn't it be what's best?",
        "Blair: Come on, Marcie. You know the answer to that already. If Starr and I are involved with this baby and in his life, Todd's going to want to be, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm Todd Manning, by the way.",
        "Joplin: I know who you are. I'm bound by confidentiality laws in regard to your daughter's case, so there's nothing to discuss. Please leave my office now.",
        "Todd: Didn't you discuss this case with Marcie McBain and Starr's mother?",
        "Joplin: I can't confirm or deny.",
        "Todd: I can tell you that Starr is not going to give up her baby to a felon.",
        "Joplin: Isn't that what you are? I suggest you take this up with your lawyer.",
        "Todd: I'm taking it up with you. Yeah, I'm a felon, and you don't want to cross this felon, lady. When I want something, I generally get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Todd isn't even allowed to see his own children, right?",
        "Starr: But trust me, Marcie, he will find a way. And I want what's best for this baby. And I think that is for him or her to have one mother. And that's you. And one day, I think he'll be old enough to understand. You know, like maybe my age. I actually made a video.",
        "Blair: You did?",
        "Starr: Yeah, you know, I love this baby so much, and I don't want him or her to think that I don't love it, you know? You know, even though I didn't want to get pregnant, I really do think that this baby is a miracle.",
        "Blair: Oh, sweetie.",
        "Starr: Well, I -- look, I mean, if you don't want the baby to see the video, then I -- I'll understand.",
        "Marcie: No, no, of course I do. Of course, I want this baby to know what an amazing birth mother you are, and what a brave and unselfish thing you did.",
        "Starr: And Cole did, too. He loves this baby so much that he's given up everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I guess Nora thought you needed to ease back into school mode, huh?",
        "Cole: I can't wait for summer to be over.",
        "Markko: Yeah, but you ready to see Starr at school every day?",
        "Cole: Just wish I could fast-forward to next year.",
        "Langston: Well, you know, Dorian hasn't even started talking to me about where to apply to college yet.",
        "Markko: You've got two whole years.",
        "Nora: Not quite. Actually, early decision applications are due in the fall, and for that, you got to have your sats, your teacher recommendations all gathered up, your college essay. Am I just raining all over this pool party here? Sorry.",
        "Markko: Cole's lucky. Guidance counselor talked to my mom about college visits, and she was all, \"Well, with the price of gas, you can afford the virtual online tour.\" She's all about me going to college, but I don't want my family going broke or to be paying off loans for half my life.",
        "Nora: You know what? There's always a way.",
        "Langston: Well, don't go too far, okay? I'm stuck in Llanview, permanently.",
        "Nora: Oh, come on, Langston. What about college?",
        "Langston: I'm pretty sure Dorian's going to want to home school me for college. The classics.",
        "Nora: Okay. Do you want some unsolicited advice? Never mind, you're going to get it anyway. I think it's really important for everybody to leave the nest.",
        "Langston: But I already did that once before and not by choice. I mean, Dorian's been so good to me. If I leave now, I don't want her to see it like a slap in the face.",
        "Nora: Why would she see it that way?",
        "Langston: Well, after what happened with Adriana, I mean, I feel like I'm all she has left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Clint, what I don't understand is how is Dorian's foster daughter going to help us -- pardon me, help you and your family get the company back?",
        "Clint: You know something? I worked at a newspaper once where the editor always said, \"There's no such thing as a business story. All business stories are personal stories.\" Do you know the lengths that Dorian has gone to to protect her daughters and her nieces?",
        "Jared: Blackmail, murder?",
        "Clint: Now those girls have grown into women, and every one of them except Blair have done everything they could to get out from under Dorian's thumb as quickly as they could.",
        "Jared: Leaving Langston.",
        "Clint: You know, dysfunctional as it is, Dorian's family is everything to her.",
        "Jared: Ah, so you're saying that even Dorian wouldn't disown her kid the way you've done to Natalie.",
        "Clint: Don't get cute with me. I haven't disowned anybody except you. Now if you're not with me, I'm --",
        "Jared: Who said I wasn't with you, Clint? Keep talking.",
        "Clint: When I was with Dorian, there came a point where she just put up this wall. And at the time, I didn't understand it, but I understand it now. Because now I know that she has set her sights on taking in Langston, and nothing else mattered. Particularly me. And then when Starr got in trouble, Todd threatened to lean on Langston. That was a big mistake, because Dorian threatened to kill him, and I'm quite sure she meant it.",
        "Jared: So you think if she's in danger of losing Langston, she may do anything, including give the company back to you?",
        "Clint: Not quite as simple as all that, but that's the general idea, yeah.",
        "Jared: Ah, but I thought Asa's cardinal rule was never to make empty threats.",
        "Clint: I wouldn't dream of doing that.",
        "Jared: You're actually going to take Langston away from Dorian.",
        "Clint: No, no, I'm not. But I know somebody who could.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Thank you, Mami. I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here for Jamie.",
        "Carlotta: Well, I'm counting on you to get back safe and sound.",
        "Antonio: No te preocupes.",
        "Carlotta: That's easy to say. But I'm your mother, and worrying and praying is what I do.",
        "Carlotta: I hope you can tell me that you have a plan to get Talia out of Mendorra.",
        "Antonio: The less you know, the better, Mami.",
        "Carlotta: Why does that not put my mind at ease? And what am I supposed to tell your brother? Ah, let me guess. You don't want him or Sarah knowing anything since her mother's responsible for getting all of you in this mess in the first place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You are not calling my mother.",
        "Tina: And why not?",
        "Tess: Because she's in Africa, okay. She's doing really important work, and she doesn't need to hear your bitching about how Lois isn't here picking up after your mutt.",
        "Tina: Well, you know, I was going to call her about you, not me. But now that you mention it, I wonder how she's going to feel when she finds out that you tried to throw her sister out on her ass.",
        "Tess: Lady, you can sit around all day on your ass. I don't care. Just stay out of my way!",
        "Cristian: Jess?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dorian became Langston Wilde's foster mother because, supposedly, the child was all alone in the world after her parents died.",
        "Jared: Supposedly?",
        "Clint: Yeah, turns out, she does have one blood relative, her mother's brother, but they were estranged, so Langston has no idea he exists, and vice- versa.",
        "Jared: So where is this guy?",
        "Clint: In Colombia.",
        "Jared: South Carolina?",
        "Clint: South America.",
        "Jared: Oh, what's he doing down there?",
        "Clint: Why don't you read the file and find out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Nora: Oh, Cole, I have to take this. Will you excuse me?",
        "Cole: Sure.",
        "Nora: Excuse me, I'm sorry. Hello? Yes.",
        "Cole: Uh, sorry about that. She cares.",
        "Langston: She doesn't know anything about my life.",
        "Cole: Did you guys have a good summer?",
        "Langston: You're not even going to ask about her?",
        "Cole: What, Starr? Is there something wrong?",
        "Langston: Of course there's something wrong. I mean, no, she's fine health- wise, and so is the baby. But she misses you. I mean, are you done wanting to punish her, you big jerk?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: A lot of people involved have sacrificed a lot.",
        "Starr: I know. Nobody's really together anymore. Me and Cole, you and Dad, you and Dr. McBain.",
        "Marcie: I've tried and tried to talk to Michael over and over again, and, you know, look, I wish that it wasn't this way, but Michael is afraid of having Todd in our lives if we take the baby.",
        "Blair: Well, he is right to worry about that.",
        "Marcie: Well, I'm just going to have to deal with what happens. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry that you and Cole aren't together anymore. Maybe someday --",
        "Starr: You know what; I don't want to talk about the future. I don't want to talk about this at all. I want to talk about now, okay?",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Starr: I mean, I -- I have to schedule myself for birthing classes. And I need a coach. Would you --",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah.",
        "Starr: Look, I -- I know you wish that I wasn't pregnant, but you've been there for me --",
        "Blair: Stop, you stop, Starr. I'll be there for you today, tomorrow, any time you need me, okay? Any time.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Starr: And Marcie, I would really, really, really like it if -- if you would be there for the birth. I mean, if you want to.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no, Starr. I'd be honored.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joplin: Used to getting what you want?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I am.",
        "Joplin: Because of that, you've lost your family. Your life is sad and pitiful, and you've got nothing you want. Well, you're not getting this, either. You don't scare me, Mr. Manning.",
        "Todd: I don't?",
        "Joplin: If you have your daughter's and your grandchild's interest at heart, you'll leave and never come back. Oh, and in case you think this is up to you, I'm calling security.",
        "Todd: I'd put that phone down if I were you.",
        "Joplin: And why would I want to do that?",
        "Todd: Because if you don't do exactly what I say, you're going to know what it really means to have a sad and pitiful life.",
        "Joplin: You're not going to bully me into betraying your daughter or my code of ethics.",
        "Todd: Are you willing to protect my daughter over your own son?",
        "Joplin: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Todd: I'm talking about your dirty little secret. And how much it's worth to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What did you do to Jess?",
        "Sarah: Cris -- Cristian, please.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Oh, wait, guys -- guys, it's okay. I'm sorry. It was my fault. I'm a little bit on edge, and I stepped on the poor dog's tail, and he yelped, and I don't know, it's just pregnancy hormones. You know how it is.",
        "Tina: Yeah, I do.",
        "Tess: Yeah, well I -- I'm going to see my ob today, and I'm going to talk to her about it.",
        "Tina: Oh, good idea.",
        "Tess: I'm going to go get ready.",
        "[Dog barking]",
        "Sarah: Bye, Jess. Mom, I -- I think it's kind of great that you're staying here while Aunt Viki's gone, because Jessica's kind of not herself.",
        "Tina: Yeah, you're telling me. Come here. Oh, I am so happy to see you. Oh, and I like your hair.",
        "Sarah: Thanks.",
        "Tina: So how is everything?",
        "Sarah: Good, it's good.",
        "Tina: And, ahem, your father, is he still around?",
        "Sarah: Uh, no. Sorry, mom, he went back to London for work.",
        "Tina: Yeah, right.",
        "Sarah: I'm guessing he didn't say goodbye.",
        "Tina: No, but, uh, that's okay. I wouldn't want to share you with anybody now anyway except for this handsome young man here.",
        "Sarah: Hey, hands off.",
        "Tina: I wouldn't think of it. So why don't you two come here and sit down and talk?",
        "Sarah: Actually, we don't have a ton of time.",
        "Tina: Why?",
        "Cristian: Antonio's going back to Mendorra.",
        "Tina: He is?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, he's going to get Talia out of there. But he's flying kind of solo.",
        "Sarah: So you know, Mom, you lived there. Maybe there's something you could tell us to help us out, anything?",
        "Tina: Like what?",
        "Cristian: Well, you know Jonas, what he's into. Whatever is it he's trying to get out of this marriage to Talia, maybe what Carlo wants with both of them? Anything, anything to help us or help Antonio get her out of there.",
        "Tina: Yes. You know what? I have just the thing that could make your job a whole lot easier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Cris knows everything I'm doing.",
        "Carlotta: He does? And Sarah?",
        "Antonio: What about Sarah?",
        "Carlotta: That mother of hers is an unusual --",
        "Antonio: I know Tina isn't perfect, Mami, but the only person I blame for what's happened to Talia is Carlo. I can understand in spades what she's going through. I -- I know what it's like to realize that your father is a monster.",
        "Carlotta: Of course, I know.",
        "Antonio: I just want to get her out, Mami. I want to do for her what you did for me. And for the same reason, I love her.",
        "Carlotta: Thank you.",
        "[Carlotta sighs]",
        "Carlotta: Finished? Oh, my.",
        "Jamie: It's a prince and a princess.",
        "Antonio: I see that.",
        "Jamie: Airplane, castle, then home.",
        "Antonio: I think it's a great map, and I'm going to follow it to the letter.",
        "Jamie: Will Talia still be a princess when you come home?",
        "Antonio: Only to us.",
        "Jamie: And we'll live happily ever after.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm not punishing Starr.",
        "Langston: Oh, right.",
        "Markko: Lang, chill.",
        "Cole: You don't think I miss Starr, too?",
        "Langston: Well, then it's pretty stupid for you guys to be broken up, then, isn't it?",
        "Markko: It's not all Cole's fault.",
        "Cole: All right, I don't want you two fighting over me and Starr, okay?",
        "Nora: Sorry about that. Okay. I know you must be starving, but back to work.",
        "Cole: Yep.",
        "Nora: I thought what we'd do is we'd start with the colleges locally and, you know, near here and then work our way west. How's that sound?",
        "Cole: Sure.",
        "Nora: It's a plan?",
        "Cole: Mm, yeah.",
        "Nora: It's a plan, okay. Should we go get a table? Bye, guys. Good to see you.",

        "Joplin: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Todd: You did an excellent job of covering your son's tracks when he stole drugs from this hospital. Nice work. He could've gone away for that. Five years probably. He would've been a different kid when he got out, huh? Bet you made sure that didn't happen. So you can spout off all you want about professional ethics. I know what you did. If you want your career and his life to end up in the toilet, you keep resisting me.",
        "Joplin: Look, my son made a mistake. It was years ago. He had treatment. He's a teacher now. How dare you.",
        "Todd: Hey, I get it. You're trying to protect your son. I would've done the same thing. I'm just trying to protect my daughter here. I'll do the favor of keeping what I know about you between you and me, and all you have to do in return is a little favor for me.",

        "Tina: Here, I think I have exactly what you need.",
        "Cristian: What's this?",
        "Tina: It's a book that's, uh, all about Mendorra but what you were afraid to ask. Cain put it together. He had me study it before we pretended to be the heirs to the throne. It's kind of like a how-to list on palace life.",
        "Sarah: How organized.",
        "Tina: I know, it's the German side of him.",
        "Cristian: This is great. Look, the change of the palace guard at 11:00 A.M. Inspection of parade stallions, 4:00 P.M. Menus, servants' names --",
        "Tina: Oh, yeah, and the name of the servants who won't poison your schnitzel. Oh, but, you know, nothing happens in Mendorra by accident. It's according to schedule.",
        "Sarah: Wow, thank you, Mom, that's awesome.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, let us know if there's anything else you think of that we can use.",
        "Tina: Oh, of course, of course I will.",
        "Sarah: I knew we could count on you, see?",
        "Tina: Oh, yes, now you give my best to Antonio.",
        "Cristian: Okay.",

        "Markko: There's plenty of good schools around Philly. I don't think it's so bad if I stick close to home. You, either.",
        "Langston: Yeah, Ms. Hanen so does not get my life.",
        "Markko: Oh, just forget about her. You're doing good.",

        "[Markko sighs]",
        "Markko: Delphina?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I keep thinking about her telling me that I'm not alone.",
        "Markko: Which you're not.",
        "Langston: Maybe she was talking about you.",
        "Markko: What, you need a psychic to tell you that? You're not alone, not ever.",

        "Jared: Well, this uncle of Langston's wasn't exactly a white knight.",
        "Clint: Well, that'll be my role when I make sure he gives up the rights to Langston and her trust fund.",
        "Jared: In exchange for Dorian giving the company back to you and your family.",
        "Clint: If nothing else, you've always been a quick study.",
        "Jared: Aha, but what happens when Dorian offers this uncle more than you do?",
        "Clint: You leave that to me.",
        "Jared: One thing, remember that she's an orphan and she seems pretty happy with Dorian, as happy as you can be in that house, but it doesn't bother you to screw that up?",
        "Clint: No more than it bothered you to screw up the lives of my family, including Matthew, who idolized you. And you had no problem manipulating your father, risking his future with Viki just so you could get what you want. You know, you are the reason that Dorian has that company and you are the reason that Jessica no longer has Nash.",
        "Jared: I get your point, Clint.",
        "Clint: But you know something? You and I have two things in common, and they trump everything. We both love Natalie, and Dorian is our common enemy. So are you in or out?",
        "Jared: You're sure this is the only way?",
        "Clint: If it will assuage your attack of conscience, keep telling yourself the girl is going to be okay. If everything goes according to plan, she's going to end up right where she is now.",
        "Jared: Yeah, if everything goes according to plan.",

        "Marcie: Well, if lunch is this awkward, imagine what it will be like going through childbirth together.",
        "Blair: Well, a lot about this situation is awkward and uncomfortable, starting with my baby having a baby of her own. But I'm very proud of her. All these decisions, she's putting the baby first.",
        "Marcie: Starr is very special. She's always been special to me.",

It's going to make rescuing princess Talia a breeze. Oh, but, honey, did you see the way that Sarah looked at me? I mean, she loves me, she really does. And I have her, I have the jewels, and I have you. For once in my life I don't have any problems. Oh, except for my niece, who apparently hates me. I mean, what did I ever do to Jessica?",

        "Todd: The first thing I want you to do is keep me updated on every procedure, every appointment that my daughter makes with you. Anytime she walks in here for any reason, I want to know about it. And, secondly, I want a phone call the minute she goes into labor.",
