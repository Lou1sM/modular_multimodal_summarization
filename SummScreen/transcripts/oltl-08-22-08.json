        "Bo has returned to the present in Llanview but is worried that Rex and Gigi are still stuck in 1968 at Asa's ranch. And there's a reason for that which neither of them is aware of. Rex is still living the life of young Bo and ready to go off to war. Gigi knows she cannot let that happen to him but does not know what to do. Back in Llanview, Brody somehow knows that Gigi is gone and fears she may not come back. And he knows she has some sort of \"secret\" involving DNA. Bo is still processing the significance of his dream and how all of the modern-day people who played the characters in 1968 were similar to them. But he believes that playing Asa really motivated him to smarten up and not follow in his father's footsteps. Tess runs into Todd at the clinic. She knows that he has secrets that could get him in trouble. He knows that she is Tess and only playing Jessica."

        "Starr: Okay, well, then let's talk about it.",
        "Cole: And for the first three seconds, I was, like, you know, this is great. Then it hit me. How am I supposed to just play with my kid, and then just give him back? It's not possible.",
        "Starr: Oh, I get it. I mean, I said pretty much the same thing.",

        "Prof. Fina: You know, I'm, uh, a scientist, not a poet, but seeing you two together makes me want to say that love is, well, it's timeless. Hmm. And it's a tribute to your love that it was able to transcend space and time. Now having said that, I feel the need to mention that you're going to have to find a way to love each other in 1968, because, uh, you won't be able to go back to 2008. The portal's closed.",
        "Gigi: No. That -- that can't be true. I have a little boy.",
        "Rex: There has to be a way for us to get back.",
        "Prof. Fina: You know, I told you that if you didn't make it through last night, it would be another, what, twenty years before you'd be able to jump through again.",
        "Gigi: Okay, I can't wait 'cause not seeing my son for a few days kills me. If I have to wait another twenty years, I -- I will die. I swear to God, I'll die. I will die.",
        "Gigi: This can't be happening.",
        "Rex: There has to be another way.",
        "Delphina: [As Prof. Fina] I, uh, well, I wish there were.",
        "Gigi: You do something. Anything, okay? You can't tell us that there's no hope.",

        "Prof. Fina: Well, it was a conversation I had with some colleagues about, well, it was a remarkable S.P.O.",
        "Rex: What the hell is an S.P.O.?",
        "Prof. Fina: You see, it's scientific terminology. Spontaneous portal opening. What I like to call an anomaly. Well, everyone calls it that. When the portal, it just suddenly opened.",
        "Rex: It has to happen again. How do we do it? How do we make it happen?",
        "Prof. Fina: Well, it would take a force that is, well, greater than physics and nature.",
        "Gigi: Okay, what kind of force?",
        "Prof. Fina: I don't know.",

        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Jared: You look kind of funny.",
        "Bo: Well, I had a dream, and you were in it. And so were you, sort of.",
        "Clint: It seems to have upset you.",
        "Bo: No, no. No. I'm all right.",
        "Clint: Listen, you had us all worried, of course, but especially Matthew.",
        "Bo: I know. I feel bad about that. I called him last night, and I told him that I just -- I needed some time to think things over.",
        "Clint: Well, we understand that, but just wish you had let us know where you were.",
        "Bo: What's he doing here? Did you decide to just forgive and forget?",
        "Clint: No, far from it.",

        "Clint: Well, Pa's way is not my way and never will be.",

        "Nigel: Sir, you're looking at me rather strangely. Food between my teeth?",
        "Bo: No, no, no, no. You just -- you're fine. Nigel, is Matthew around?",
        "Nigel: Freshman orientation. He's expected home soon.",
        "Bo: Ah.",
        "Clint: There's that look again.",
        "Bo: Well... Nigel was in the same dream that Jared was in, only Nigel -- Nigel was Chuck Sr.",
        "Clint: Nigel was a hell raising old cowboy?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm. Yeah, he played the part real well.",
        "Nigel: Sometimes dreams do contain a soupcon of truth, so perhaps it's that both Chuck and I were extremely loyal to your father, often to the detriment to those around us.",
        "Bo: You know, Nigel, you just hit the nail right on the head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Runyon: Who exactly is this witness?",
        "John: Manning's former bodyguard. Guy's name is Keyshawn Reddick.",
        "Judge Runyon: Keys Reddick? I see him more than I see my wife, he's in my courtroom so much. Let's see his statement.",
        "John: He refused to swear to anything. Said he's afraid of Manning.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Listen, I know that you've been going through a rough time lately, but the Jessica I know and love would never call a nurse, or anyone for that matter, a lazy bitch.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Yeah, well, the Jessica that you know and love has never been widowed before, pregnant without her mom in town, so -- [Tess sighs] What are you doing at an obstetrician's office, Todd?",
        "Todd: I'm here for Starr. Joplin's her doctor, too.",
        "Tess: Oh, yeah, I heard Starr's pregnant. Sorry about that.",
        "Todd: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Tess: Mm. So are you taking her to an appointment? Is that why you're here?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Tess: Oh, yeah. You're not allowed anywhere near your kids these days.",
        "Todd: That's nice of you to remind me about that.",
        "Tess: Huh. But you were coming out of an examination room. Are you the reason I'm standing out here with a full bladder? Oh! You were in there trying to get information out of Dr. Joplin about Starr's pregnancy, because -- that's it. Right. 'Cause no one else will tell you what's going on.",
        "Todd: Okay, you can shut up now.",
        "Tess: Oh, it's okay. I realize you're grumpy. I would be, too, if, you know, somebody was giving away my grandbaby up for adoption. Make me a little angry.",
        "Todd: Okay. Nice to see you. Gotta go.",
        "Tess: Oh, no, it's all making sense to me now, Todd. You were in there talking to Dr. Joplin, 'cause the Todd that I know wouldn't give up his grandbaby to strangers without a fight. So you were there giving her an earful of something. What happened in there, Todd?",
        "Todd: Listen, uh, Jessica, I wouldn't press me on this. Because I'll press right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. I wish there were something I could say to make this better.",
        "Cole: You can. Say you changed your mind.",
        "Starr: I can't do that.",
        "Cole: Okay, then, there's not a whole lot more for us to say.",
        "Starr: You know what? I'm just going to go, okay?",
        "Karen: Hey, Starr and Cole.",
        "Darryl: We missed you guys on the school trip.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah. Sorry. We couldn't make it.",
        "Liz: We haven't seen you all summer. Where have you been?",
        "Cole: Just hanging out.",
        "Liz: Together? Karen: Starr, you look different. Have you gained some weight?",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah. Definitely.",
        "Liz: I guess we know why you didn't want to ride the roller coaster.",
        "Karen: Oh, my God. You're right, Liz. Starr's not getting fat. Starr has a baby bump.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You threatening me, Uncle Todd?",
        "Todd: Just advising you not to press me.",
        "Tess: Or what? You'll tell everybody I'm stressed out? Everybody already knows, and I have good reason to be. You see, Nash is dead. Jared and Natalie are living at Llanfair, so every morning I get to wake up with a reminder that Nash is gone, and it's Jared and Natalie's fault. And they're just fine.",
        "Todd: I thought Nash's death was an accident.",
        "Tess: It was an accident. It was -- it was because of Jared's lies. And even better, now Llanfair's got a little bit jollier because Auntie Tina has stopped by to live with us.",
        "Todd: Tina is here?",
        "Tess: You didn't know?",
        "Todd: I wasn't -- I wasn't sure. I thought I saw her the other day, but --",
        "Tess: Yeah. She's at Llanfair, and... hey. Why should she stay somewhere that she's not wanted when she can stay with her favorite brother and his big house?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: All I have is what I heard from Reddick.",
        "Judge Runyon: You know that's not enough.",
        "John: He helped Manning move the woman from Ramsey's to Manning's.",
        "Judge Runyon: I need a sworn statement to issue you that warrant.",
        "John: So what? Manning wrote that.",
        "Judge Runyon: I know that. And you know that, McBain. But the good citizens of Llanview tend to believe what they see in a newspaper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't even want to have a drink with my sister, let alone share a house with her.",
        "Tess: Oh, come on. You have that big, huge house, and it's gotta be lonely now that your wife and kids went bye-bye.",
        "Todd: Forget it.",
        "[Tess sighs]",
        "Tess: Todd, please? She's, like, the closest relative that you have besides your kids. She might even speak to you.",
        "Todd: No. End of discussion.",
        "Tess: Unbelievable. You are so selfish, Todd. So I'm saddled up with that cow and her disgusting little mutt? Thanks a lot. You know, all you ever think about it is yourself. This is why you lost your entire family, you arrogant little bastard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm going to go inform the rest of the family so they can stop worrying.",
        "Bo: Okay. Think I'll see if any one has heard from Balsom.",
        "Nigel: Oh, just a moment, Sir. It's fortunate that you returned at this moment.",
        "Bo: Why?",
        "Nigel: Well, Mrs. Buchanan asked me to find something in the attic, and I stumbled on these. Letters you wrote from Vietnam to your father. I thought you might like to have them.",
        "Matthew: Dad!",

        "Matthew: I'm so glad you're back.",

        "Matthew: It's okay. It's weird. I just thought maybe you were mad.",
        "Bo: What, at you? Never. No, son. I'm going to try to do better from now on, okay? I'm going to try to be a better father.",

        "Rex: You know something, Fina? You're working my last nerve here.",
        "Gigi: Mine, too. Rex is about to go to war maybe, and you're standing here shrugging your shoulders.",
        "Prof. Fina: Well, uh, maybe he won't have to serve his full two years. I mean, how long does this war last?",
        "Gigi: Till April 30, 1975.",
        "Prof. Fina: 1975? By Neptune's trident. Who wins?",
        "Rex: Nobody.",
        "Prof. Fina: Well, uh, keep your head down. And look me up in twenty years when the portal opens again. Try not to change history more than you, well, already have.",
        "Gigi: Thanks for the advice.",
        "Prof. Fina: Well, I wish you both the best of luck.",

        "Todd: I'm not hearing any opinions there; I just hear hostility and aggression.",
        "Todd: It's rather Tess-like.",
