Original Todd stands outside the door and observes them together shocked.",

        "Starr: Here's to another chapter of \"Growing up Manning,\" to the day we found out our dad is really...",
        "Dani: Our uncle.",

        "T\u00e9a: You were worried that when those kids found out you weren't really their father, they wouldn't love you anymore. But they do.",
        "Victor: What about you? That's ok. I know the answer.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're not gonna let me speak for myself?",
        "Victor: What difference does it make? You love Todd, don't you? I'm not him. I'm just this-- I'm just an idiot whose mother sold his soul without his permission.",
        "T\u00e9a: How could she do that to you?",
        "Victor: That was supposed to buy me everything, wasn't it? But it's... it's done just the opposite. I've lost everything, haven't I?",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't say that.",
        "Victor: I have.",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't say that.",
        "Victor: I have. I lost-- Everything I had was his, including you. The woman I love. I... I don't want to drag this out, ok, so if you're gonna go, I'd prefer you just went.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What the hell do you think you're doing? What, are you trying to rip us off now?",
        "Todd: Rip you off?",
        "Jack: Yeah. You're standing in front of the safe. That's where people keep things that they don't want other people to steal.",
        "Todd: I'm not stealing anything.",
        "Jack: Just admit it, Scarface. You're not only a fake, you're a crook, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: That's it! We have a truce because of Ryder, but you're just taking advantage of it the same way you took advantage of Tess. And the last thing that I need is some leech that sleeps with everything that moves lecturing me about my feelings. Get out.",
        "Ford: Oh!",
        "Jessica: Ow! What the hell was that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Theo: All right! And now for the main event. The moment you've all been waiting for. That's right. The hottest dancer from here to eternity...Gigi.",

        "Todd: The safe was open when I didn't open the safe.",
        "Jack: Like I'm gonna believe that.",
        "Todd: What are you doing?",
        "Jack: Get your hands off me, freak.",
        "Todd: I can't let you make that phone call.",
        "Jack: What are you gonna do? Knock me out? Hit me. Just like you did last time?",
        "Todd: That was a mistake. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: You're not sorry. You're so messed up, you probably enjoyed it.",
        "Todd: Jack, you're my son. I would never do anything...",
        "Jack: Don't call me your son.",
        "Todd: But I am your father.",
        "Jack: No, you're not my father. You'll never be my father.",
        "Todd: There's proof. Look. Nobody told you. You can ask Aunt Viki if you like. You can talk to Starr. They'll explain the whole story.",
        "Jack: I know the whole story. Your name's supposed to be Todd. His name's supposed to be Victor. You think I care?",
        "Todd: You don't care about the truth?",
        "Jack: Oh, I know the truth. I already have a father, and he loves me. You're a stranger. I don't know you, and I don't want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: You know what really got to me?",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Dani: The look in Dad's eyes. I mean--",
        "Starr: Uncle Victor's eyes.",
        "Dani: Yeah. It was this look that I've never seen before. It was like he didn't understand what was happening to him.",
        "Starr: How could he? How could anyone?",
        "Dani: To be brainwashed into thinking that you're someone else. To find out that your whole life--your memories, your everything--that none of that happened to you.",
        "Starr: At least for Dad, it's like he's getting back something that he's missed, but for Victor, he loses everything.",
        "Dani: No, it doesn't. He still has us.",
        "Starr: I felt so bad when I had to tell you that he wasn't our dad.",
        "Dani: You started making things better when you told him you still loved him. I love him, too, and both of us will make sure that he knows we'll always be in his life, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah. He was my dad for 8 years. I'm not going to stop loving him, but--",
        "Dani: But what?",
        "Starr: I have this feeling like I should've known that he wasn't my dad.",
        "Dani: Starr, how were you supposed to know that?",
        "Starr: Because I should've sensed it. And-- actually, maybe I did.",
        "Dani: What do you mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: I mean it. You don't have to-- I think it would be worse if you gave me a lot of apologies or explanations.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're not the only one who made a vow. I vowed to love you forever.",
        "Victor: When you thought I was Todd. Now you know that everything that happened, all those years, everything I did, everything I So you're free to go. You're-- you're off the hook.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that what you think I want?",
        "Victor: I know you. It doesn't matter what I call myself, I know how you think. And there's nothing you hate more than being lied to. So I think that kind of puts the kibosh on the whole \"till death do us part\" thing, doesn't it?",
        "T\u00e9a: Do you even want to hear what I have to say? Or are you just gonna stand there and put words in my mouth?",
        "Victor: Oh, I get it. Sure. Yeah. You need your day in court, is that it? You need to have your closing argument like every good lawyer? Ok, that's fine. Go ahead! I don't care! Let's hear it. Let's hear about all my--all of my sins. All my crimes. Lay it out for me, T\u00e9a. Don't forget, though, when you get to the closing argument, you gotta ask the jury the one question...\"Ladies and gentlemen, how could a woman like me love a sham like this guy?\"",

        "Kim: Rex, what are you doing here?",
        "Rex: Me? What are you doing here? And why are you using the name \"Gigi\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Here you go. Knock yourself out.",
        "Ford: I think you already did that.",
        "Jessica: I barely touched you.",
        "Ford: Frozen peas?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Bree uses them for all her boo-boos.",
        "Ford: Ow.",
        "Jessica: Oh, come on. It can't be that bad.",

        "Ford: I don't know how it happened. Ok? You reminded me so much of--",
        "Jessica: Don't say it.",
        "Ford: She had her good points, you know.",
        "Jessica: Except she's not a person. She's just a piece of me. A fragment.",
        "Ford: I know that.",
        "Jessica: Then respect me enough to remember it.",
        "Ford: I didn't mean to insult you! It's just when you start yelling like that, you sound exactly like her.",
        "Jessica: And that's foreplay for you.",
        "Ford: I know this sounds weird, ok, but there was something about the way that she-- you know what? Never mind. I get it. I'm not gonna talk about Tess like she's-- like she's a person.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Ford: Jessica, you've been really wonderful about all this. You've let me see Ryder. You've given me my life back. I would like very much if we could just-- if we could just go back to the way things were before and forget this whole thing happened. We can do that, right?",
        "Jessica: Honestly? I don't know if that's possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What's the matter, Kim, huh? Why are you calling yourself Gigi?",
        "Kim: Hey, my boss is here. If he catches me talking with you--",
        "Rex: What? You can't talk and dance at the same time?",
        "Kim: Gigi was Stacy's stripper name when we worked together in Vegas.",
        "Rex: So?",
        "Kim: So she was my best friend. I'm paying my respects.",
        "Rex: So using Stacy's stripper name is what, like paying a tribute?",
        "Kim: I'm trying to keep her memory alive.",
        "Rex: But you and Stacy hated Gigi. Why are you using the name?",
        "Kim: I just told you. I'm paying a tribute to my best friend.",
        "Rex: Well, not like this, ok, so find another stripper name, starting now.",
        "Kim: Why? Are you afraid if Gigi wants to become a stripper someday, she'll want to use it?",
        "Rex: Gigi isn't becoming a stripper. She's not becoming anything at all, ok? She's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Listen. I get it. This has been a lot to deal with. For everyone.",
        "Jack: Is that supposed to make me like you now? You trying to be all \"Oh, I totally get what you're going through\"? You don't even know me.",
        "Todd: You're right. I don't know you. I don't know anything about you. I was taken from you when you were tiny.",
        "Jack: So what? Is that supposed to make me feel sorry for you?",
        "Todd: No, it's not. It's just-- it's understandable that you wouldn't remember me. You were very young.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I was. So why can't you just leave me alone?",
        "Todd: Because I do remember. I remember my son.",
        "Jack: I thought all your memories got zapped when you were locked up.",
        "Todd: When I was locked up, my blood was pumping, and I was breathing, but my brain was not working right. And they gave me drugs to keep me that way. But every day, there would be moments where it would all come back to me, and you're my Jack. I have a son, his name is Jack, and I'm gonna do everything I can...",
        "Jack: Don't give me that crap. I know all about you. You don't even want me.",
        "Todd: What are you talking about?",
        "Jack: You tried to give me away to nuns, in a Mexican airport!",
        "Todd: Yeah, that happened. I didn't know. I didn't know the truth.",
        "Jack: Don't give me that crap. Come on. You might have Starr fooled into thinking you're some great dad, but you can't fool me. So stop trying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I told this to Jack but he didn't take it very well because Victor is the only dad that he has ever known. He doesn't remember another one.",
        "Dani: But you do.",
        "Starr: Yeah. Dani, I hate to say this, but there were times with Victor where it just-- he didn't seem like the dad I knew before.",
        "Dani: Like when you got together with Cole? All that stuff. That was in the play.",
        "Starr: And he hurt Cole so badly. He threw me down a flight of stairs.",
        "Dani: I can't believe that. He loves you so much.",
        "Starr: It didn't stop here. That's what's bothered me. It didn't make sense. Even still, when he got involved with Marty Saybrooke, he had a different face, she didn't know who he was, and he didn't tell her. He just let her fall deeper and deeper in love with him, and I should've known then. I should've known that he wasn't my dad.",
        "Dani: Why didn't you ever bring this up before? I mean, you say it was bothering you, but until this other guy showed up, you never had a problem.",
        "Starr: I did have a problem. I just thought that it was mine.",
        "Dani: So when I first came here, and you spent all that time trying to convince me to accept him...how could you do that if you secretly thought that he was some kind of monster?",
        "Starr: That's not what I mean.",
        "Dani: Well, what do you mean? When you were trying to get me to love him as my dad, you never suspected that he wasn't, so why is it ok for you to totally change your mind now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: If you think when I look back on these last 3 years, all I see is a sham, you don't know me very well. When we thought that I was dying, and we got married anyway, did you not love me?",
        "Victor: Of course, I loved you. How can you even ask me that question?",
        "T\u00e9a: Right. When I went away to that clinic. When I pushed you away because I wanted to die by myself. Did you just cut and run? No! No! You came after me. You came looking for me. That was real. That was as real as it gets. That was not a sham.",
        "Victor: But...the man you married is not the man you thought he was.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. No. No, you're not the man I thought you were. No. No, I didn't marry you for $5 million. No. You were not the man on that island with whom I conceived a child. There are a lot of things you are not. You are not the man who kicked me out of my own house naked in the middle of winter. You're not the man who nearly burned me down in a cabana. Oh, a lot of the things that we thought we shared that was good, we didn't share, but a lot of the bad things, we didn't share those, either.",
        "Victor: [Chuckles] I'm sorry. Is your way of kind of saying, you know... always look on the bright side? Is that what it is? Because it's really kind of messed up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Our whole life is really kind of messed up. [Laughs]",
        "Victor: I don't need any of this. I don't need your explanations. I don't want to make it worse.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not explaining anything. I'm not trying to make you feel better.",
        "Victor: Ok, then. Before, I asked you a question. It was a very simple question. I haven't heard an answer yet. I love you. I know that I am not who you thought I was. I'm not who I thought I was. But I know that I love you. However... if you don't feel the same way about me... I need to hear it right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know it feels like everything has changed. But in the most important ways, everything is still the same. You are the man I married. Which is why when I look at you, this is what I see. My husband. My partner. My soul mate. I didn't marry you because your name was Todd Manning. I married you because I loved you. And I still love you, Victor. [Laughs] Victory! Ha ha ha!",
        "Victor: Vic.",
        "T\u00e9a: Victorious. It's a good name. A strong name. I love you...Victor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I wasn't trying to hide anything, Dani. It was this feeling that I got every time Uncle Victor did something that I didn't understand. We can both agree that he has done bad things, Dani.",
        "Dani: There's one thing that he didn't do. Uncle Victor never convinced his frat buddies to attack some girl. Marty was in college, Starr. Like you are right now. And they ganged up on her, and they took turns forcing a her to have sex with them.",
        "Starr: Wait a minute.",
        "Dani: No, you wait a minute. When I first came to Llanview, and I found out that I had a father named Todd Manning, I looked him up online and I couldn't believe what I saw. Rape and prison and murder. It made me sick. I wanted to throw up.",
        "Starr: I understood that.",
        "Dani: I wanted to make him suffer like he made other people suffer. So I pushed him away. And I told him that I hated him. And I did everything but spit in his face, and he didn't deserve it! Because he didn't do any of those things! He couldn't, because he wasn't around. The guy that raped Marty Saybrooke--that was your precious Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There's things you don't understand. There's a lot more to this story than just Mexican nuns.",
        "Jack: It's a fact. You tried to dump me. Hand me off to the first person who would take me.",
        "Todd: That was before I knew that you were my son.",
        "Jack: Yeah? Well, I'm still not your son.",
        "Todd: Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm not trying to stop you from having a relationship with your uncle. I think it's great that you have a relationship with Victor. I'm not trying to tell you what to feel.",
        "Jack: I don't need permission to care about my father. He would do anything for me.",
        "Todd: So would I.",
        "Jack: No. You couldn't do what he did. You don't have a clue how far he's gone to protect me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Rex, oh, my God. I had no idea. I'm so sorry.",
        "Rex: Not as sorry as Jack's gonna be. He thinks just because his father threw around his money, he's not gonna have to pay for what he did, but he's wrong.",
        "Kim: Nobody should get away with something like that. Even if he is a kid.",
        "Rex: Well, don't worry. He won't. Not as long as I have anything to do about it.",
        "Kim: So you and Gigi were on your way to get married? So sad.",
        "Rex: Don't overdo it, ok? You didn't give a damn about Gigi.",
        "Kim: Yeah, but I know how you feel. I still miss Stace so much. She was the best friend I ever had.",
        "Rex: It's not the same.",
        "Kim: Maybe not, but I know how much you loved her. Rex, I'm so sorry.",
        "Rex: I didn't tell you the clincher.",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Rex: Gigi was an organ donor. When she die somebody got her heart.",
        "Kim: Who?",
        "Rex: Clint.",
        "Kim: My Clint?",
        "Rex: Well, he wasn't yours for long. I mean, that marriage...",
        "Kim: Rex, what happened? What happened to Clint?",
        "Rex: He had a massive heart attack. If he hadn't gotten a transplant, he would've died.",
        "Kim: But he's ok now?",
        "Rex: Oh, yeah. He has a whole new lease on his miserable life. Because of Gigi.",
        "Kim: Maybe you thought our marriage was a joke, but it wasn't. I really cared about him.",
        "Rex: Not to mention his bank account.",
        "Kim: I'm serious. I would've stayed if that bastard David Vickers didn't make me leave town. He was so worried I would suck up all his Buchanan money.",
        "Rex: Yeah, about the Buchanan money. There isn't any. Well, not for Clint, anyway.",
        "Kim: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Somebody else has it.",
        "Kim: What? Who?",
        "Rex: Me.",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Rex: Well, he got Gigi's heart. I think it was a small price to pay. I took him for everything he was worth.",
        "Kim: Ok.. Now I've heard everything.",
        "Rex: Not yet.",
        "Kim: What else is there?",
        "Rex: Clint and I seem to have more in common than we thought. I'm his son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Ford, listen. I know that you thought that Tess was a real person, and I know that you miss her very much.",
        "Ford: Can't help it.",
        "Jessica: I understand. But if you can't figure out a way to get over her, then we can't go back to the way things were.",
        "Ford: So what am I supposed if do? Concentrate really hard on getting over her, and then when I do, give you a call?",
        "Jessica: Sounds good, doesn't it? Because I have to get over Brody, and right now, I'm not even close.",
        "Ford: It just takes however long it takes.",
        "Jessica: Well, in the meantime, I can't worry about you jumping on me every time I remind you of Tess.",
        "Ford: Jessica, please, don't take me away from my son. Without Tess, Ryder is all I have.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I'm not trying to hurt you. But if we're gonna have this arrangement, everything between us has to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: You're Clint's son? No way.",
        "Rex: Trust me, I don't want to believe it, either.",
        "Kim: So that means that if I would've stayed, I would've been your--.",
        "Rex: Yes, my wicked stepmother, which sounds like the beginning of a fairy tale nobody wants to hear, especially me.",
        "Kim: But I still don't get it. What do you want with me? Why are you even here?",
        "Rex: I don't know. A psychic sent me.",
        "Kim: A psychic?",
        "Rex: Ok, this is gonna sound crazy, but--",
        "Kim: Crazier than the psychic? Sorry.",
        "Rex: I've been having these... sightings.",
        "Kim: What do you mean? Like a UFO or something?",
        "Rex: No, like Gigi or something.",
        "Kim: You saw Gigi? Like, after she died?",
        "Rex: I don't understand it, either, ok? I know it sounds crazy, but it's so real. The way she stands, the way she walks, and she's got this look on her face like--",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Rex: Like she wants to tell me something.",
        "Kim: What do you think she wants to tell you?",
        "Rex: I don't know. All Delphina the psychic said that she heard was \"Spotted Pony.\"",
        "Kim: So you're here because Gigi's ghost sent you?",
        "Rex: Pretty much. Any ideas why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: My dad really came through for me a while ago.",
        "Todd: Ok. You want to tell me what happened?",
        "Jack: I got arrested, ok?",
        "Todd: Ok. Why?",
        "Jack: Gigi Morasco. She died. Stupid McPain tried to throw me in jail for it.",
        "Todd: McPain?",
        "Jack: Yeah. That's what dad and I call him.",
        "Todd: That's great. That's funny. I gotta chalk one up for Victor...",
        "Jack: Don't even try.",
        "Todd: Ok.",
        "Jack: You're not bonding with me. Ok? I'm just trying to tell you what type of man my dad is. He kept me out of jail. He protected me.",
        "Todd: That's what fathers do.",
        "Jack: What do you know about it? Huh? Nothing. Because you're not my dad, and you never will be. So back off, Scarface.",
        "Todd: Ok, let's get one thing straight right now, ok? That is the last time that you call me Scarface. And second of all, before you go passing out the father of the year awards, you might want to ask yourself why you needed to be protected in the first place.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Todd: I'm saying that if Victor had done a halfway decent job in raising you, maybe you wouldn't have turned to be such an obnoxious little brat!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: What are you asking me for? I don't know why some psychic sent you all the way to Anchorage, Kentucky.",
        "Rex: Gigi wanted me to be here for some reason. I'd never heard of this place. You know who has?",
        "Kim: Who?",
        "Rex: David Vickers. And when I told him what the psychic said, he knew all about this place. It was probably because of you, not Gigi.",
        "Kim: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Rex: The psychic probably thought that Gigi was here because you were using her name.",
        "Kim: Oh. Yeah. Right.",
        "Rex: She was talking about a totally different Gigi.",
        "Kim: Yeah. That must be it. That's gotta be what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Jessica, Ryder needs me. He depends on me now. He's gotten used to having me in his life. You don't want to take him away from that.",
        "Jessica: I won't. You can see Ryder whenever you want.",
        "Ford: Then I guess don't understand. What's changing?",
        "Jessica: You and me. I don't think that we should see each other anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Do not call him \"my Todd.\" There's only one Todd Manning and he's our father, no matter what crime he has committed.",
        "Dani: I already forgave him once. I don't know if I can do it again.",
        "Starr: Do you know who can't forgive Todd Manning? Todd Manning. He has spent his whole life torturing himself over what he did to Marty.",
        "Dani: That doesn't make it ok!",
        "Starr: Ok, maybe it doesn't, but Uncle Victor isn't exactly a saint, either. Look at what he has done. He convinced Cole that his mother was dead. He planned on stealing my baby and raising it with Marty. How about that? Isn't that a little sick, Dani?",
        "Dani: You'd be sick, too, if you had to live inside his head. Starr, he was programmed to think that he was someone else.",
        "Starr: Dad was locked up. He was locked up. He was injected with drugs.",
        "Dani: You know what? Whatever.",
        "Starr: What? If you're gonna make excuses for Victor...",
        "Dani: I'm not making excuses.",
        "Starr: Why are we fighting about this, Dani? What the-- what are we doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Sorry. Yeah. I didn't mean--",
        "Jack: Oh, the hell you didn't. You finally told the truth. You finally said what you think of me. Well, you want to know what I think of you, Scarface?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: Did I hear you say that you loved me?",
        "T\u00e9a: I love you, Victor.",
        "Victor: Thanks. I haven't lost you.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're never gonna lose me. Ha ha! I should've learned that lesson when I didn't die according to plan. That was a joke.",
        "Victor: I can't smile right now.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "Victor: I know, but I don't know if I can trust what I hears or see. I can't-- I have these memories, but I don't know whose they are. They're mine or they're someone else's. You have any idea what that's like?",
        "T\u00e9a: You want to know what's real? Come here.",
        "Victor: The ottoman?",
        "T\u00e9a: [Laughs] This is real. Right here. Right now. I'm real.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I think maybe we just kind of got off on the wrong foot. Can we start again?",
        "Jack: Go to hell.",
        "Todd: Is that a \"go to hell\" yes or \"go to hell\" no?",
        "Jack: You don't belong here. So get out of my house before I call the cops.",
        "Todd: Way to go, Manning. Call the kid names. Great stuff. It's not his fault he's an obnoxious, little brat. It's the son of a bitch who raised him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Theo: Hey.",
        "Kim: Hey.",
        "Theo: I had to put on another girl in your place there, Gigi. If you're not gonna work, then get the hell out of here.",
        "Kim: I'm working. I'm just saying good-bye to an old friend here.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Kim: I gotta go. Please, just don't tell anyone you saw me here. Promise?",
        "Rex: Mm-hmm.",
        "Kim: Clint's really ok, right?",
        "Rex: Yeah, he's alive. Damn lucky. He confessed to a whole bunch of crimes, and his only punishment is having to spend the next 20 years in the lap of luxury.",
        "Kim: What crimes?",
        "Rex: You don't want to know. One of the highlights, though, is messing with his kids' paternity tests.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Even when you don't say it, sometimes the way you look at me, I can tell what you're thinking. You're pretending that I'm Tess. You're pretending that she's back.",
        "Ford: I don't do that. Ok, maybe once or twice.",
        "Jessica: Well, it's too much, Ford. I can't have it. It's not good for me. Not if I want to stay healthy.",
        "Ford: Healthy. Ok. I guess I can see that. But I will...",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Ford: I will miss you. You're a lot of fun to hang out with.",
        "Jessica: Even though I'm only Jessica?",
        "Ford: Even though you're only Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I knew Clint was really upset when I left, but it sounds like he went off the deep end, huh?",
        "Rex: I don't think that was all about you. But it probably had a big part to do with it.",
        "Kim: I'm just glad he's ok now. If anything had happened--do",
        "Rex: You better go if you don't want to get fired.",
        "Kim: Right. Well, bye, Rex. Like I said before, I'm really sorry about Gigi.",
        "Rex: Yeah, aren't we all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: There's just so much that we have to sort through, and it's all so confusing.",
        "Starr: Doesn't mean I should be taking it out on you.",
        "Dani: I was doing the same thing. I'm sorry, too. [Giggles] We're so lucky to have each other, especially now.",
        "Starr: Let's just never fight again, ok?",
        "Dani: Yeah, like that'll happen.",
        "[Dani and Starr giggle]",
        "Dani: Wow, if we're this upset, imagine how our dads are feeling.",
        "Starr: Oh, I know. They're' freaking out, too--and we both know they don't like to feel cornered.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: No one's home. It's just the two of us. Let's go upstairs. My, my. What have we here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: This might come as a surprise, but I've enjoyed hanging out with you, too.",
        "Ford: You don't have to say that.",
        "Jessica: It's true. Sometimes I think you're the only person I can talk to. I can't talk to Natalie. I obviously can't talk to Brody. But I can talk to you and you know what I'm going through.",
        "Ford: So are you sure you want to make this deal to not see each other?",
        "Jessica: I don't think that we have a choice. I mean, we're friends, we're Ryder's parents, but when you add in the whole Tess thing...things could get little intense in a way that we don't want it to.",
        "Ford: Ok. Well, how should we work out my visits? What are you gonna do? Look out the window and hide if you see me coming?",
        "Jessica: I guess we'll just work out the details after, but for now, do we have a deal?",
        "Ford: Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey, do you guys validate parking-- Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Don't give up.",
        "Waitress: That's $17.50.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Oh, my God, girl. You'll never believe who walked into the club tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: It is so weird having to get used to another man being my dad. Especially since all I know is the stuff that I read online.",
        "Starr: I'll help you with the other stuff.",
        "Dani: You promise?",
        "Starr: I promise. You want to start now?:",
        "Dani: Sure.",
        "Starr: Ok. Well, once upon a time, there was this little girl named starr. She had a stuffed frog. Her dad named him fred the magic frog.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: This is so strange. I have no memory of my actual life. All I know is todd Manning.",
        "T\u00e9a: You can't be him anymore.",
        "Victor: No. Guess I'm starting from zero.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's ok to be scared. I'm scared, too. We have a lot of work ahead of us. But we have each other. We're strong. We're healthy. And we've survived a lot worse.",
        "Victor: Have we?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, we have. And as long as we're together, and we love one another, we'll survive this, too."
