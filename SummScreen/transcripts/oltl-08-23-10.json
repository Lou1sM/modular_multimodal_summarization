        "David is getting ready for his wedding and boasting. Dorian is doing the same. John and Detective Price are ready to find Eli and arrest him before it's too late. John knows that Robert Ford is their key witness who can testify against Eli. Yet, he knows that Eli has gotten to Robert and caused him to chicken out. So he takes Kelly down to the station and locks her in the room with Ford where she persuades him to do the right thing and help the cops nail Eli by writing a sworn statement. Yet, Eli is very clever. He overhears Destiny and Daren talking to Dani about how if Destiny's brother Shaun won't find her mom for her, then maybe Daren's brother, the cop can. Eli knows that Price is looking for him. He persuades Blair to elope with him. And we wonder if the cops will be able to stop him in time."

        "David: No, Pa, I'm fine. I can get myself ready. I just want to make sure that you and Matthew get here before the ceremony. And bring the garter. I've got the ring.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "David: That was fast. Hey, I got to go.",
        "Cabana boy: Did you need something?",
        "David: Maybe you should come in here and ask me that question.",
        "Cabana boy: Did you need...",
        "David: Champagne, Be--maybe you should write this down. Champagne; Beluga caviar with those little toast things; a mirror, preferably full length. I need napkins with \"Davian\" spelled the traditional way embossed in gold. It's my wedding day, man. Come on! Snap to!",
        "Cabana boy: Yes, sir.",
        "Viki: David, is everything all right?",
        "David: Viki? It's so nice to see you. Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to hide in the bathroom if you hear footsteps approaching.",
        "Viki: Why?",
        "David: Does Dorian know you're here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Oh, oh! And the wedding cake--double check on that. Thank you. Handle it. Oh! Oh, Starr, darling.",
        "Starr: Hello.",
        "Dorian: Oh, my dear. Oh. You gorgeous creature, you. Cole, I'm so glad to have you here.",
        "Starr: Well, sure. We wouldn't miss your wedding.",
        "Cole: It's nice to be at a family event. I missed too many this year.",
        "Starr: Well, this will be better than graduation.",
        "Cole: Hey, look. Llanview's new super couple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Oh, I know who he is. He refused to help my dad find my mom. You want to tell me why?",
        "Shaun: You get it, right?",
        "Destiny: Actually, no, I don't, but you better have a good reason. I have to go get ready. See you in a few? Don't take no from him.",
        "Shaun: Des!",
        "Dani: Shaun, you have to help us.",
        "Shaun: I'm sorry, but I can't.",
        "Dani: What? \"You can't.\" That's no answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Ah! Eli! What are you doing? It's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony.",
        "Eli: There's been a change of plans. There will be no wedding for us here today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Price: Clarke's in the cabana with his fianc\u00e9e.",
        "John: Does he look agitated?",
        "Price: No. He doesn't seem suspicious.",
        "John: Good. Keep it that way. Don't let him out of your sight, but don't alert him either.",
        "Price: All right, I got you.",
        "John: Call me back in 15.",
        "Kelly: Okay, so is Price following Eli? Does he have him in sight?",
        "John: He's doing his job, Kelly, he's doing his job.",
        "Kelly: Do you think Eli's gonna try to hurt Blair before the wedding?",
        "John: No. No. I'm worried he's gonna run if he gets spooked.",
        "Kelly: You apologized to him. You arrested me.",
        "John: I am not sure he even bought that. All right, look, I want this guy locked up today, and that's where you come in.",
        "Kelly: I gave you everything that Rex and I found about Eli.",
        "John: Yeah. And Nora's gone to the judge with it, trying to get a warrant.",
        "Kelly: Good!",
        "John: Not good. She sent me a text. She's bombing out.",
        "Kelly: Damn it. John, we need more. We need more. We need more cooperation--",
        "John: What we need is a statement from this guy Ford, and you're gonna help us get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Darling, you do look wonderful.",
        "Langston: Well, thank you. Look at you. You, too!",
        "Dorian: Oh, not yet. I'm not in my wedding dress yet. Listen, listen, I'm gonna need my Cramer women with me, so will you please come to my cabana in just a few minutes? Please? Thank you! I've got things I have to do. Come on.",
        "Langston: She looks so happy.",
        "Starr: It's hard to believe that David Vickers does that for her, but he does.",
        "James: This place is insane!",
        "Langston: Well, it's done up for the weddings. It's not usually like this.",
        "James: Yeah. It's still a country club.",
        "Cole: Hey, James, uh, why don't we get everyone some drinks?",
        "James: Sure.",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Langston: Oh, wait. What?",
        "Starr: Well, you actually brought James here?",
        "Langston: Yeah? Why not?",
        "Starr: There doesn't really seem to be a point. It's not like Ford's here to see it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey. We need to get a few things straight. You showed up at my apartment, hit on my girlfriend--",
        "James: Wait. That's what she said?",
        "Cole: Yeah, she told me.",
        "James: No. I mean, she calls herself \"your girlfriend\"?",
        "Cole: She told me what you said, what you did. Give it up, James. She's never gonna leave me for you, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Dani, I'm not a detective.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but Todd says you're smart and you know people. You could find her.",
        "Shaun: Your mom left and said she wanted to be left alone.",
        "Dani: No, no. She doesn't know what she's doing, okay? She's scared, and she thinks that this is best for me, but she's wrong.",
        "Shaun: You want me to come between you and T\u00e9a Delgado?",
        "Dani: Yes! Shaun, if you don't help us, my mother is going to die alone. How can you let that happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You changed your mind about getting married?",
        "Eli: No. Only about the venue. Do you really feel right sharing a wedding day with David and Dorian?",
        "Blair: Well, not really, but I thought that you couldn't wait to marry me.",
        "Eli: I can't. I just feel like we got ambushed by Dorian's decision, and we couldn't really say no.",
        "Blair: You know what? It will be fine.",
        "Eli: Yeah, well, fine doesn't sound like a great wedding day to me.",
        "Blair: Eli, I told you I didn't want a big wedding anyway.",
        "Eli: But you deserve to be the belle of your own ball, and so does Dorian. And anyway, double weddings are a little strange, don't you think?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, I don't really remember the last double wedding I attended. It was kind of a blur.",
        "Eli: Well, then there's the Vickers factor.",
        "Blair: Oh, Eli, he'll behave, I'm telling you.",
        "Eli: I'm not so sure. What about Clint Buchanan? What if he shows up with another shotgun like he did at Bo and Nora's wedding, hunting Vickers?",
        "Blair: You really don't want to get married today, do you?",
        "Eli: I just--I don't want a circus. It's David and Dorian.",
        "Blair: I know.",
        "Eli: You asked if I could handle your big, crazy, wild family, and I can. I can handle anything they throw at us, but I just want one day that is all about my bride.",
        "Blair: Oh... you're the best, you know that?",
        "Eli: I want to be.",
        "Blair: Oh, you are. Mmm. Okay, we'll wait.",
        "Eli: Thanks. No, no, no! No.",
        "Blair: But you just said--",
        "Eli: No. I don't want to wait another day to marry you, Blair.",
        "Blair: Well, what in the world do you have in mind?",
        "Eli: I want the two of us to disappear. Let's elope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: Theodore? What--what are you doing here?",
        "Price: Shh! Man, I told you, it's Theo now, and I'm working.",
        "Darren: Here? Must be pretty serious work. Whoa, is this surveillance?",
        "Price: Yes.",
        "Darren: Who's the perp?",
        "Price: Shut up.",
        "Darren: Do you have a visual?",
        "Price: Look, I told Mom to stop letting you watch those cop shows a long time ago. It's messing with your mind.",
        "Darren: It's just so cool. I mean, you're like Shaft... without the really great coat.",
        "Price: Leave before I bounce you out of here, Darren.",
        "Darren: Going.",
        "Price: Hey. And don't tell anybody you saw me here. You blow my cover, it's trouble.",
        "Darren: Don't worry. Surveillance. Sweet. Ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Wait, so are you saying that you want me to work Ford?",
        "John: Listen, I need a statement so I can arrest Eli before he gets married.",
        "Kelly: Are you gonna bust into Blair's wedding?",
        "John: Well, I could wait till they cut the cake if that makes you feel better.",
        "Kelly: No, I just--I feel bad. She thinks I'm a pain in the butt, too.",
        "John: She'll thank you later.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no. You would think so, but that's not how it works. Trust me. It doesn't matter. Okay, you know what? Let's do this. Let's do this.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "John: Let's go.",
        "Kelly: Feel it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: It's all right. Dorian invited me.",
        "David: To our wedding?",
        "Viki: Oh, yes, yes. Not only did she invite Charlie and me, she thanked us.",
        "David: Did you just hear a rip in the fabric of space and time?",
        "Viki: Mmm. She admitted that our...efforts actually brought you and Dorian back together again.",
        "David: Maybe you did.",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm. So I came by in the hopes, David, that you would forgive me, too.",
        "David: You had me at my name.",
        "Viki: Oh, David! That usually works.",
        "David: Now, you were very conniving and very devious, which I got to say, it was very confusing, Viki.",
        "Viki: Yes, I know, I know. And I really am very, very sorry because I hope you know how fond of you I am. But, David, I had to do it, and it worked because you and Dorian realized that you belong together.",
        "David: Is that really what it was about?",
        "Viki: Mmm, yes. Did you think there was something else going on?",
        "David: Eh, I thought maybe you were just giving yourself an excuse to act on your long-simmering desire to get me in the sack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Okay, nice! I would like a lawyer!",
        "John: When I'm ready to process you.",
        "Kelly: Which is when? You're gonna hear about this! You're gonna read about it in tomorrow's paper, McBain! Huh.",
        "Ford: What are you doing here?",
        "Kelly: Oh, I'm waiting to be processed.",
        "Ford: For what, harassment?",
        "Kelly: Breaking and entering.",
        "Ford: Figures.",
        "Kelly: What?",
        "Ford: Nothing. Just you can't help sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Why did you bring James here?",
        "Langston: You heard him--we had a date.",
        "Starr: It just seems like such a waste 'cause Ford isn't even here.",
        "Langston: I know, but is it a problem?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Langston: Fine. Then I'll keep him distracted since you don't want to.",
        "Starr: You're right, I don't want to, okay? Because I'm not interested in James!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: That is what Starr said, too, that she'll be with you forever.",
        "Cole: Okay.",
        "James: Forever. Like a prison sentence.",
        "Cole: Now, pay attention, okay?",
        "James: Oh, believe me, I am. I've seen everything.",
        "Cole: I don't know what you think you've seen, but--",
        "James: You let that nut case, Hannah O'Connor, take you for a ride, and you left Starr alone. Can't be surprised if she went looking someplace else.",
        "Cole: You mean when you carjacked her?",
        "James: That's ancient history. I'm talking about after that.",
        "Cole: You talking about that big kiss? That was all for show.",
        "James: Keep telling yourself that, Cole. There's something between us.",
        "Cole: Well, Starr doesn't think so.",
        "James: Starr doesn't want to think so. Yet. But she's already struggling to go through the motions. You see that, don't you?",
        "Cole: Look, I don't give a damn what you think. You stay away from my girlfriend, you hear me?",
        "James: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Jessica asked me to help her find out if you lied to her, which you had.",
        "Ford: With good reason.",
        "Kelly: Anyway, I was protecting someone that I cared about. You know what that's like.",
        "Ford: Me?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. What are you in here for anyway?",
        "Ford: Obstruction of justice.",
        "Kelly: Oh, what did McBain say you obstructed?",
        "Ford: I don't know. Ask him. The whole thing's bogus, kind of like your charge.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no, no. No, no. I am guilty. I broke into Eli Clarke's room.",
        "Ford: You don't want to mess with that guy. He's a lawyer.",
        "Kelly: Um, he's a killer. He murdered my mother... and a friend who worked at her hospital. He killed a man, a records clerk in Boston, because he was giving us some information. He pushed Marty Saybrooke down the stairs and killed her baby, and I still don't know why he did that, and he attacked you and made Hannah confess to it.",
        "Ford: So you shouldn't break into his room.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no, I'm gonna do whatever it takes because Eli has to be stopped.",
        "Ford: Huh. Good luck with that.",
        "Kelly: Ford, this is your problem, too. We have to put him in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Runyon: Come in. What can I do for you, Lieutenant?",
        "John: Issue a warrant for Elijah Clarke's arrest.",
        "Judge Runyon: Do you have something that Nora didn't have an hour ago?",
        "John: Oh, I think you'll find this compelling, judge.",
        "Judge Runyon: Yes. I saw this. Nora showed me all this. You have a random group of unrelated deaths by natural causes.",
        "John: Suspicious deaths.",
        "Judge Runyon: Elijah Clarke is a respected attorney.",
        "John: And Clarke is only one of his names. He has 3 that we know of.",
        "Judge Runyon: Yes. He changed his name after he was exonerated for his wife's death.",
        "John: First wife. Second wife is still missing to this day. That's because he killed both of them.",
        "Judge Runyon: They couldn't prove the first case. You say there's a second?",
        "John: They never found the body.",
        "Judge Runyon: So you have nothing.",
        "John: Doesn't mean it ain't true.",
        "Judge Runyon: I need evidence. Now, I could maybe--maybe-- stretch this to give you a search warrant--",
        "John: Not good enough. Not good enough, Judge. It's got to be an arrest warrant.",
        "Judge Runyon: Why?",
        "John: Because if Elijah Clarke isn't put behind bars today, he'll kill again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Is this because John and Kelly were coming after you?",
        "Eli: No. Why would you say that?",
        "Blair: Well, they accused you of being a murderer, Eli, and if somebody did that to me, I'd want to be as far away from them as possible.",
        "Eli: You know what? It's fine. John actually apologized.",
        "Blair: Well, he did?",
        "Eli: And he sent Kelly to jail for breaking into my hotel room.",
        "Blair: She what?",
        "Eli: Apparently so.",
        "Blair: Oh, well, I'm gonna have a talk with her.",
        "Eli: Don't, don't, don't.",
        "Blair: Well--",
        "Eli: She honestly believes that I'm some kind of maniacal evil doer.",
        "Blair: Well, it's nuts!",
        "Eli: She lost her mother. I can only imagine--",
        "Blair: No. It doesn't give her an excuse to go after you.",
        "Eli: I think John is a little embarrassed that he even believed her in the first place.",
        "Blair: Ha. I can't believe he really--he threw her in jail! She's in jail! Ha ha!",
        "Eli: I'm sure he's only gonna keep her there long enough to teach her a lesson.",
        "Blair: Oh, my. Welcome, welcome to the circus.",
        "Eli: Now do you understand why I didn't want to get married here?",
        "Blair: Well, it'll calm down after today, I promise.",
        "Eli: Will it?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eli: Tell me the truth, Blair. Does your life ever calm down?",
        "Blair: Mmm, no. But I kind of thought you liked that about me.",
        "Eli: I do. I love your life, and I cannot wait for it to be our life.",
        "Blair: Mmm.",
        "Eli: But I want it to start out right, just the two of us.",
        "Blair: Mmm. Okay. You know what? As soon as Todd gets back, we'll start making plans.",
        "Eli: Why do our plans depend upon Todd?",
        "Blair: Well, I told him that I would watch Dani, and I, you know, can't leave until he gets back.",
        "Eli: Well, where the hell is he?",
        "Blair: He went to find T\u00e9a. Oh, go on! You can't be surprised! You knew that he wasn't gonna let her go off alone.",
        "Eli: Okay, well, there is a household full of people who can look after Danielle just fine. We're only gonna be gone for a day or two.",
        "Blair: Oh, my gosh. This is really important to you.",
        "Eli: This is important to us, Blair.",
        "Blair: All right. Then let's do it.",
        "Eli: Oh, I love you.",
        "Blair: Hmm. I love you, too, so--so when are we leaving?",
        "Eli: Right now.",
        "Blair: Wait a minute. We're not even gonna stay and watch Dorian and David's wedding?",
        "Eli: If we stay, then it's gonna be all about \"why aren't we getting married, too?\" We'll steal Dorian's thunder just by being there.",
        "Blair: You're right, you're right, and we both know how much she hates that. Okay, so I guess we'll leave now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Why isn't your dad here with you?",
        "Dani: He's out trying to do what we need you to do. We have to find my mom. You can't understand that?",
        "Shaun: You're gonna be okay. Can I get you some water?",
        "Dani: No.",
        "Shaun: Dani, I wish things were different.",
        "Dani: Huh. Well, me, too, but they're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: My queen! Looking especially delicious today.",
        "Destiny: Hey, you look good, too.",
        "Darren: I do, don't I? Ahem. Uh, what's wrong?",
        "Destiny: My brother's being a pigheaded fool, and I don't know why.",
        "Darren: About what?",
        "Destiny: Dani wants to find her mother.",
        "Darren: At that hospice or wherever?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. Her dad's trying to find her, full-out search. They need Shaun to help, only he won't do a thing.",
        "Darren: Maybe I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Congratulations, David. I never thought you would actually get to this point.",
        "David: What's that?",
        "Viki: Ready to commit to someone for the rest of your life.",
        "David: Oh. That's much later. Much later today.",
        "Viki: David, you are prepared to commit for the rest of your life?",
        "David: Don't say it like that. Something about the wording. 2 to 5 with an option to renew, that's a much--",
        "Viki: Uh-uh. Uh-uh.",
        "David: The coward's way out?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "David: You're right. I'm in this for the long haul.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, the last time you and Dorian got this far, you deserted, and she was devastated.",
        "David: Now, that was not my fault. My brother forced me to leave her at the altar.",
        "Viki: I know. But that's not going to happen this time, is it?",
        "David: No. This is the real thing.",
        "Viki: Oh, David, I'm proud of you! Ha ha!",
        "Dorian: David, I didn't know you were entertaining guests.",
        "Viki: Dorian, don't worry. He's all yours. I just came by to apologize to David and congratulate him and to give you both very best wishes.",
        "Dorian: So glad you could come. Should I be jealous?",
        "David: Probably. There's not a woman around who's not gonna be trying to steal your husband.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. Will they succeed?",
        "David: I ain't goin' anywhere, baby. Now, hold on a second. Why are you tempting fate? Isn't this supposed to be bad luck?",

        "Ford: Yeah, well, not much of one. He's already been through enough trouble lately.",
        "Kelly: So? You want to do right by him.",
        "Ford: Yeah, and for once I can protect him.",
        "Kelly: And the only way you're gonna do that is by not keeping quiet.",
        "Ford: Look, it may not help you, but I have to watch out for James.",
        "Kelly: It's not gonna work. It's like blackmail. No matter how hard you try to keep Eli happy, it'll never be enough. Have you taken a look at the list, how many people this man has killed?",
        "Ford: You don't know that.",
        "Kelly: Ford, we do know. This guy has killed people because they get in his way. That's all the reason he needs. And no matter what, he is gonna come after you and your brother. And the only way you can stop that is to put him in jail, and you're the only one who can do that.",
