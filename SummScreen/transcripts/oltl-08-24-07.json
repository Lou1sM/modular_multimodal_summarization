        "Miles: Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.",

        "Todd: What -- what was that?",
        "Starr: Dad, you caught us. Um -- we were doing Diddy.",
        "Todd: Doing what?",
        "Starr: It's a video game.",
        "Todd: Where's your mom?",
        "Starr: Well, she's not ready yet. You just told her about this event, like, five minutes ago. You can't expect her to snap her fingers and look hot for you.",
        "Todd: You're making it sound like it's a date. It's not a date, it's business.",
        "Starr: Whatever you say, Dad.",
        "Todd: It's not a date. Your mom knows that, too.",

        "Marty: But I don't understand why. What -- what reason would she have to murder him?",

        "Nora: So it is my pleasure to present the 2007 Llanview Woman of the Year to Lindsay Rappaport.",

        "Adriana: Hey. Looks like I made it just in time for the speech.",
        "Rex: This is going to be interesting.",
        "Lindsay: Thank you, everyone. I'm truly overwhelmed, and surprised, because I never, in a million years, ever imagined that I would be standing up here. And I just don't know what to say. And I don't know how I could possibly accept this award.",

        "Blair: Whenever you are.",
        "Todd: Are they going to be ok here?",

        "Todd: Hey, punk, don't pull anything tonight, ok?",
        "Cole: I -- I won't.",

        "Blair: Ok, you know what? Say good night, Todd. Come on.",
        "Todd: I'm going to get a full report from your brother.",
        "Starr: If you're so worried about leaving us alone in the house together, why are you even going? Is Miles Laurence supposed to be there or something?",
        "Todd: Yeah, that would ice the cake, actually.",
        "Starr: If that's not the reason, then --",
        "Todd: Like I said --",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know something about what happened to Todd's son?",
        "Miles: No -- no, what I meant is, I -- I know how he feels. I love Marty, and I'm -- I've lost her, and it's a terrible feeling. You feel -- you feel helpless, like there's nothing you can do to get him back.",
        "Natalie: Well, maybe Todd's finally accepted that about his son.",
        "Miles: You know, he's completely despondent about it.",
        "Natalie: You tried to help.",
        "Miles: Yeah. He doesn't think that. He blames me for everything.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's because you're the one who sent him to Chicago.",
        "Miles: In many ways, he's right. Todd wouldn't have been stabbed and locked up for all that time.",
        "Natalie: Miles, you were just trying to do something good.",
        "Miles: Oh, I wish there was something I could do for him now.",
        "Natalie: But you can't. Look, you said you have no idea where Todd's son is. I was there when you said it.",
        "Miles: I know it. Yes, it's true.",
        "Natalie: Has something happened for that to change?",

        "John: You don't have to worry about why she killed him. Let me do that.",
        "Marty: But I mean, how can you prove it?",
        "John: I have some evidence. With your testimony, it should be enough to get you out of here.",
        "Marty: But it's my word against hers.",
        "John: Stop second-guessing everything, all right? It's over.",
        "Marty: I'm sorry. Huh. I just can't believe it.",
        "John: Believe it. I'll have you back with Cole in no time.",

        "John: Hey, look, you don't have to say anything.",

        "John: I couldn't see you go to prison for something you didn't do, right?",
        "Marty: You believed in me even when I didn't. I owe you my life.",
        "John: I'm just glad I could help.",

        "John: Now I have to go arrest Lindsay for murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I've had quite the life here in Llanview. I know you've heard the stories. If you haven't, then that means you've probably been living in a cave somewhere. Because I've -- I haven't really lived a life -- the kind of life that would have me up here winning this award, but I'm honored, and I'm really very grateful. But I don't feel comfortable standing up here calling myself anyone's Woman of the Year. As Nora mentioned earlier, I had a daughter named Jen who passed away a few years ago. I've had a difficult time talking about that. I still do. Any parent that's ever lost a child knows that that's the kind of grief and pain that time just doesn't heal. You know, you -- you get on with your life, but it's a pain that lingers always. And that's what got me thinking about other mothers, many from disadvantaged backgrounds who might be in great danger of losing their children just because of that. And the group I formed is to help mothers so that they can spend more time with their children, because there isn't enough time. There's just not enough time. I saw an opportunity to help good people who had done nothing wrong, and I did that to honor my daughter, Jen. And in memory of her very sweet life that was taken away from her far too soon. So you see, I'm not woman of the year. I'm just a mother who mourns the loss of her daughter every single day, and who would lie, cheat, steal -- even kill if I had to -- to make sure that no other mother ever has to know this feeling. I am a woman who would do everything and anything to protect a mother from ever, ever losing her child. And the thing is, I already have. I've done that. And because of that -- because of that --",

        "John: Yeah, thanks for the information.",
        "Marty: What's wrong?",
        "John: The timing stinks. Lindsay's at The Palace ballroom getting the Woman- of-the-Year award.",

        "Jared: You know, you're a good player.",
        "Nash: Not good enough.",
        "Jared: I had one lucky hand.",
        "Roxy: Hand? You call it a hand? It was a paw. A big paw. A Suscatchaswatch. You know, big foot?",
        "[Roxy chuckles]",
        "Nash: Ha-ha -- how's your head?",
        "Roxy: Oh, it's groovy, man. You know, I'm used to this. Nothing that hasn't happened to me in a good week at least two or three times. How's yours?",
        "Nash: It's great, thanks. Yeah, I just lost every penny to my name.",
        "Roxy: Ok, listen, Stevie. Give me a minute, ok?",
        "Jared: Take all the time you need.",
        "Nash: No, thank you.",
        "Roxy: You want a drink?",
        "Nash: Yeah, what do you got?",
        "Roxy: No more wine. I know that's your favorite poison.",
        "Nash: That's my poison. I was supposed to pay off Antonio, buy out his share with my winnings. Hey, I guess, uh -- what -- best-case scenario, I'll just end up losing my controlling share of the winery to a complete stranger.",
        "Roxy: Maybe you ought to look into a refi, and get an equity line of credit. Hey, how do you think I keep this place going? Listen, I got this friend Cheech from the old 'hood, and he could get you a loan in two minutes, no questions asked.",
        "Nash: Cheech, that's great. Yeah, I value my kneecaps, thanks. It's cool.",
        "Roxy: Yeah. Hey, listen, why don't you go to Antonio? He's a fair guy. You know, ask him for more time. I -- I forgot -- you stole his wife away from -- all right, not such a good idea. Bad idea. Forget about it.",
        "Nash: I'm screwed. What do I do now?",

        "Marty: You're going to arrest her right there at the ceremony?",
        "John: I know it's a big thing here in town, but --",
        "Marty: It's one of the most important events of the year.",
        "John: I'll try to do it quiet. Bring her in after it's all over.",
        "Marty: Oh, I just -- I still can't wrap my head around all of this. I mean, Lindsay -- did -- did she even know Spencer?",
        "John: I'm not sure how well she knew him. But she had her reasons for killing him.",
        "Marty: And you know what those reasons are? Oh, sorry. It's none of my business.",
        "John: I -- I can't say right now what her motive might have been, if ever, but trust me --",
        "Marty: I've trusted you with my life. Can I call Cole?",
        "John: The charges against you can't be dropped until we get an indictment against Lindsay, but if -- if you want to give him a call and tell him things are looking up, go for it.",
        "Marty: Thank you, for everything.",
        "John: Don't thank me. Just try and get some sleep. You deserve it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I know, my parents are nuts. They can't decide whether they love each other or hate each other.",
        "Cole: Uh -- do you remember when things were ok with them?",
        "Starr: Well, I remember a couple of years ago they were going to get married again. And everything was perfect. Except for the fact that I had to get braces right before the wedding.",
        "Cole: Yikes.",
        "Starr: And then it all went wrong. The wedding was canceled, and -- well, things have been kind of back and forth ever since.",
        "Cole: That sucks.",
        "Starr: So how about you? Do you remember when your parents were together before your dad died?",
        "Cole: Oh, yeah. I remember it all. They were awesome.",
        "Starr: Like how?",
        "Cole: Hmm. Like -- well, I guess I was around 8 or 9, and I woke up in the middle of the night and I walked downstairs, and they were dancing in the living room -- no music whatsoever. They were just -- just dancing in the dark. And I didn't say anything. I just -- I just watched them for about 10 minutes.",
        "Starr: And then what happened?",
        "Cole: Well, at first, I thought it was kind of weird, but the more I watched, it was actually kind of cool. I mean, there they were, just the two of them, just holding each other and dancing. I mean, no music, but -- but they were dancing like there was, like they could both hear it, but nobody else could.",
        "Starr: I guess my parents were just too busy arguing to ever dance like that. But who knows? Maybe tonight'll be different.",
        "Cole: Even though they said it was work?",
        "[Bottle fizzes]",
        "Starr: Well, it is. You see, this woman-of-the-year thing practically blows up every year.",
        "Cole: What do you mean? It's got some kind of curse on it or something?",
        "Starr: I guess you could say that, but my parents want to be there just in case it does.",
        "Cole: Well, what do you think could happen?",
        "Starr: You know what? I hope nothing. I hope that my parents are stuck with each other for the whole night and have to tell each other exactly how they feel.",

        "Todd: Oh, damn it.",
        "Blair: What's wrong?",
        "Todd: We missed the fireworks.",
        "Blair: Oh, who says there were any?",
        "Todd: Look at Lindsay. She's having a breakdown at the podium.",
        "Blair: Why is everybody applauding, Todd? Come on, let's go see what's going on. Hey. What's happening?",
        "Dorian: Oh -- Lindsay just made a lovely speech.",
        "Blair: Well, good.",
        "Todd: What's she blubbering about?",
        "Dorian: She talked about Jen, and it was quite moving.",
        "Todd: Ah. What really happened? Did she and Nora have some kind of smackdown?",
        "Dorian: No. Actual, Nora was quite gracious.",
        "Todd: You mean to tell me, this is the first woman-of-the-year where some stuff didn't go down?",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Dorian: It certainly does look that way.",

        "Lindsay: I don't know.",
        "Marcie: This is going to be ok. You said some really wonderful things. And look, everybody was applauding you. They love you. Ok, Lindsay, let's just regroup, ok? What do you say?",
        "Lindsay: You -- you made a big mistake. A big mistake --",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Lindsay: Nominating me, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: No, no.",
        "Lindsay: Yes, you did.",

        "Roxy: Yeah, talk about sucky timing --",
        "Nash: I should have just walked. I should have put down my cards, cashed up my chips. I -- it wasn't everything I needed, but it was damn close. It was close, it was close.",
        "Roxy: You know, it's like that old Mr. Rogers song. \"Know when to hold, know when to fold, know when to fluff -- puff --\" oh, whatever. Hey, listen, if I had the scratch, I'd give it to you myself",
        "Nash: That's all right, Roxy. I'm done taking money from beautiful blonds.",
        "Roxy: Well, maybe I got some dough in the cash register.",
        "Nash: No, really, thank you. Thank you, ok? That's -- I'm done. I'm done cutting corners, taking the easy way out.",
        "Roxy: And you think trying to save your ass in a back-door card game isn't cutting corners?",
        "Nash: Well, at least I would have done it on my own.",
        "Roxy: Oh, is Jess going to blow her lid off?",
        "Nash: No, I think -- I think mostly she's going to insist in covering me. Huh. But there's no way I'm taking money from my wife to pay off her ex-husband.",

        "Miles: I know, it's just -- I feel guilty about it.",

        "Miles: Because of what he's done to everyone. You know, people I've come to know and really like. Even Todd.",
        "Natalie: Ok, all right. So you feel guilty. That -- that just makes you human, no matter what Todd says about you.",
        "Miles: Well, he's right in a lot of ways.",
        "Natalie: Ok -- Miles, you gave Todd false hope. It's not wonderful, but it's not horrible, either. Ok, you -- you tried to help him, even though he blames you for everything that happened after that. No matter how many \"I'm sorrys\" you give, it's not going to change anything. He's still going to hold a grudge, so get over it. Take it from somebody who knows.",

        "Cole: So, I don't get it. How come your parents can't just figure it out and stay married?",
        "Starr: Beats me. I mean, I thought it was going to work the last time. But it really wasn't their fault, though. Nothing's been right ever since.",
        "Cole: You want to tell me about it? Wait -- tell me if I'm being too nosy.",
        "Starr: No, it's just an icky story. Cole oh, oh -- like my mom and Miles isn't?",
        "Starr: Ok, fine. So, my parents were at the palace and they were super excited because they were going to get married and we were all going to be a family again. And they ended up almost dying. Remember, I told you about Margaret Cochran?",
        "Cole: Oh, yeah, the one that had your dad's kid, right?",
        "Starr: It's not like they had an affair or anything, even though Britney's stupid slideshow on Halloween wanted to make it seem that way. Margaret was just some crazy stalker of my dad's. She was completely obsessed with him.",
        "Cole: They had a kid together?",
        "Starr: It wasn't exactly voluntary on my dad's part. Trust me, you don't want to know.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it sounds, um --",
        "Starr: Sick and terrible and totally evil -- yeah, but my dad can kind of be his own worst enemy sometimes. He kind of messed with Margaret's mind. He made her think that he really liked her when they first met because he wanted something. He kind of does that sometimes.",
        "Cole: Hey, it's -- it's ok. I -- I'm not in love with your dad.",
        "Starr: Well, that's a relief.",
        "Cole: Listen, don't make a joke about this. I'm serious. I mean, what your dad does is not your fault. I couldn't be with you at all if I thought differently -- you know, considering --",
        "Starr: Your mom? Yeah.",
        "Cole: Listen, I -- I just don't get the whole on again/off again marriage thing that your parents keep doing.",
        "Starr: No, it -- it's not that they don't love each other or anything. I mean, my dad loves my mom more than anyone in the whole entire world. They're -- they're connected. We all are.",
        "Cole: That's how my parents were, too.",
        "Starr: The bottom line is that my mom and dad are soul mates. Nothing can ever, ever change that.",

        "Michael: No, you listen to me, ok? What do you think is going to happen here, huh? Do you think I'm going to let you walk in here with the keystone cops and take my wife out in handcuffs?",
        "John: Mike, that's not what this is.",
        "Michael: Well, then what the hell is it, John? Do you really expect me to believe that you came here \"not\" expecting to make an arrest?",
