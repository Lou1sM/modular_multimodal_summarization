        "Blair is determined to go to Tahiti, find Ross Rayburn and get the goods on Tea so that she can't be around Todd or the kids. Todd notices Tea ready to leave. He knows that something is going on regarding trust issues and he tells her he won't let her go. He persuades her to stay with him. Layla is confident that she has a future with Fish and no clue that he's gay. But she ends up talking to Kyle's new boyfriend in the gym who reveals to her that he's seeing Kyle Lewis and Kyle's \"ex\" was a cop who is now telling everybody he's heterosexual and seeing a woman. At that point, she puts two and two together and she reveals it to Cristian. Rex and Gigi get into a big argument about his going behind her back to get Schuyler to leave town and her going behind his back to pay Gigi off to get an abortion. But they declare that they are meant for each other and are going to make it work. Meanwhile, Stacy drugs Schuyler in an attempt to get him in bed so that she can get pregnant. But he knows he cannot do that because he only wants Gigi and he wants Stacy out of his home. At that point, she knows she has no prospect for getting pregnant."

        "John: Come in.",
        "Oliver: What did you need to see us about, boss?",
        "John: It can't go beyond this room.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, sure thing.",
        "Keeton: What about the rest of the task force?",
        "John: Someone in this department's been leaking classified information. You think you two can handle that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Wow! Move over, Picasso.",
        "Cristian: You like it?",
        "Layla: No, I don't like it. Love it.",
        "Cristian: Really? Thanks.",
        "Layla: Yeah. I didn't know you ever painted so a person could tell what she was looking at.",
        "Cristian: Shut up. So where are you headed?",
        "Layla: To the gym. I don't really feel like working out, but at least it's air-conditioned.",
        "Cristian: Maybe I can paint a gym.",
        "Layla: I dare you.",
        "Cristian: You're in a good mood.",
        "Layla: Yeah, I guess I am.",
        "Cristian: So, everything went okay with you and Fish last night?",
        "Layla: I'd say better than okay. Can you believe that slutty Stacy Morasco coming on to Oliver like that? What's with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You're allowed to have caffeine?",
        "Stacy: Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Schuyler: My mom used to tell all her patients no liquor, no caffeine.",
        "EMT: I'm sorry. You're not pregnant anymore.",
        "Stacy: [Crying]",
        "EMT: You've had a miscarriage.",
        "Stacy: Oh. Right. Well, uh, I was just going to have a couple sips just to cool off. What are you doing worrying about me anyway? You have enough on your mind. So, tell me about what happened with Gigi.",
        "Schuyler: Well, which part? The part where I told her how I feel or the part where the boyfriend showed up and told me to skip town?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Don't walk away from me! I am talking to you!",
        "Rex: You're screaming.",
        "Gigi: No, I'm not. I'm yelling. There's a difference. Did you or did you not tell Schuyler to leave town?",
        "Rex: I can't believe he went crying to you about that.",
        "Gigi: We just ran into each other, Rex!",
        "Rex: Of course you did! Because everywhere you go, he's following you!",
        "Gigi: Oh, stop that! Don't change the subject! I asked you a question! Did you tell Schuyler to leave town?",
        "Rex: And when you ran into each other, did he say that he was leaving, give you a kiss good-bye, maybe?",
        "Gigi: Excuse me?",
        "Rex: Is Schuyler packing his bags or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Blair, what's this about?",
        "Blair: I told you, I'm going to Tahiti.",
        "Dorian: On vacation?",
        "Blair: Well, it's not a vacation. It's, um, travel.",
        "Dorian: Oh. If you're trying to avoid the summer heat, I don't think Tahiti's the right place to go.",
        "Blair: You know, please don't start with me.",
        "Dorian: Tell me this isn't about T\u00e9a Delgado. How long is that flight to Tahiti? 12, 14 hours? For crying out loud, you're going all that distance just to dig up some dirt on the woman? Is it worth all the time and effort just to break up Todd and T\u00e9a's relationship?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You going somewhere?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um, yes, I'm going on a business trip.",
        "Todd: Where?",
        "T\u00e9a: What? I'm sorry?",
        "Todd: Where are you going?",
        "T\u00e9a: Ta--uh, Tennessee. I'm going to Tennessee.",
        "Todd: Since when do you have clients in Tennessee?",
        "T\u00e9a: A long time.",
        "Todd: Really?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, really. And, um, I'm--I got to go because I'm going to miss my plane.",
        "Todd: Hold on, hold on. Were you going to go without telling me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I was going to call you from--from the airport. Um, could you--",
        "Todd: Are you cutting out on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You did tell him to leave, didn't you?",
        "Rex: I didn't tell him to do anything, okay? It wasn't like that. I went to the rehab clinic where he works to apologize for being a jerk.",
        "Gigi: And then you told him to leave town.",
        "Rex: No, I--I didn't tell him to do anything. I just said that I sort of figured it made sense for him.",
        "Gigi: Oh, you did.",
        "Rex: It doesn't matter. He's still around.",
        "Gigi: Rex, we had a deal, remember? The whole thing about being honest, not going behind each other's back?",
        "Rex: Look, I just went over there to apologize. I didn't think that I had to clear that with you first. I mean, it's not like I went over there to tell him to have an abortion.",
        "Gigi: Nice.",
        "Rex: What I did, it doesn't even compare to you telling Stacy to get rid of the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Why are you acting like you care about me?",
        "Stacy: Because I do. Schuy, can I tell you something? All along, you told me to stay away from Rex, to forget about him and to move on. And you know what? You were right. But you need to do the same thing with Gigi. She doesn't want you, Schuy. I do.",
        "Schuyler: You do?",
        "Stacy: You know, I just realized it, but I thought maybe, I don't know. Do you still want me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I figured your evening would go south after I saw Stacy plastered all over Fish.",
        "Layla: She's a total nut job. To set it up so you and I would be gone so she could get busy with Oliver?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, that was weird. I don't see why she would put all that effort in.",
        "Layla: Hey, Oliver is a really attractive guy. You don't see that?",
        "Cristian: Is this what you won't tell Layla?",
        "Cristian: That's not what I'm saying. I just don't see Fish being hot for Stacy, that's all, like, ever.",
        "Layla: You and I both. I'll see you back at the apartment.",
        "Cristian: Okay. Have a good workout.",
        "Layla: Yeah, right. While you're pursuing fine art, I'll be pursuing fine abs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hey.",
        "Kyle: Hey. What, you going to be sticking around?",
        "Nick: Uh, after this, I got a crunch class. My abs need a little work.",
        "Kyle: You can't be serious.",
        "Nick: Do you want to hang out later, or you going to disappear on me again?",
        "Kyle: Well, I'm going to go for a jog, but I'll be back.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Kyle: I wanted to thank you for being so cool about, you know, taking our time and everything.",
        "Nick: Look, after what your ex did to you, telling you he's not even gay? You have every reason to have your guard up.",
        "Kyle: I appreciate that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What's going on?",
        "Keeton: You seem a little uptight.",
        "John: You heard the mayor's press conference. Seems he's got a little problem with us.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, what is with him?",
        "John: According to him, the drug problem is a result of a lack of effort by this department.",
        "Oliver: Excuse me?",
        "John: Yeah, we're going to prove that son of a bitch wrong.",
        "Keeton: How?",
        "John: There's a shipment coming up from the south tonight.",
        "Keeton: You know where the drop is?",
        "John: Pier 51, the docks. A bust this size should shut the mayor up.",
        "Keeton: You know for sure this is going down?",
        "John: Yeah, I do.",
        "Keeton: How?",
        "John: Just be ready to roll.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Blair, this is utter insanity!",
        "Blair: No, it's not, Dorian. I really need to see this through.",
        "Dorian: Why?",
        "Blair: Because Rex found out a few things about Ross Rayburn, that's why.",
        "Dorian: Let me guess. He lives in Tahiti.",
        "Blair: A ding ding ding ding ding! And guess what. He's been shacking up with a woman. Of course, Rex hasn't identified her yet, but I'm sure it's T\u00e9a Delgado.",
        "Dorian: You don't know that.",
        "Blair: [Scoffs] They were rescued together on that island, okay? They disappeared together for a number of years until, of course, T\u00e9a shows up about a year ago down in Colombia with your friend Ray.",
        "Dorian: I told you not to go there.",
        "Blair: Okay. I won't go there, but I will say that T\u00e9a's ticket back to Llanview is probably through Ray Montez. But I'm going to go find Ross, and I'm going to make him tell me everything that was going on between he and T\u00e9a, because if Todd doesn't care what was going on with T\u00e9a all those years she was missing, tell you what, I do.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You think I'm leaving you? Why--why would you think that?",
        "Todd: Just a hunch. I'm not as stupid as I look. I have done some stupid things.",
        "T\u00e9a: Everybody has. So?",
        "Todd: I've had an interesting day. I, uh... I've had to face it all over again that I'm more than a little screwed up. So if you're doing this running away thing because it's getting serious between us...",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha!",
        "Todd: I'm just saying I get it, that's all.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen to you.",
        "Todd: I'm trying to be totally honest. I realize, you know what? When you see these couples out in public in the park and they're holding hands and they're all over each other, I used to think to myself, get a room, you know? But if I'm being totally honest, which I hate, I think that maybe a part of me wants that kind of stuff, too...with you. No, wait a minute. I do know. I know this must sound so weird coming from me. I don't really know how to do this stuff.",
        "T\u00e9a: Do what stuff?",
        "Todd: I also think that I screwed things up with you on purpose by sleeping with Blair.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha! Who are you and what did you do with Todd?",
        "Todd: I'm serious.",
        "T\u00e9a: Where's all this coming from?",
        "Todd: I had an appointment with my shrink today.",
        "T\u00e9a: The court-appointed one?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Turns out it was Marty.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you're kidding.",
        "Todd: No, I know. What are the odds, right? Anyway, she helped me. She helped me see some stuff.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",
        "Todd: Stuff that I hadn't seen before, so I left her office just now and hauled ass over here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha! That's impressive.",
        "Todd: Would you stop that? I've decided I can finally do this.",
        "T\u00e9a: Do what?",
        "Todd: Be happy. Because you make me happy, T\u00e9a. And I thought maybe I made you happy, too.",
        "Todd: So there you go. You're never going to hear me say that again.",
        "T\u00e9a: That I make you happy? The sweetest thing you've ever said to me.",
        "Todd: She said as she walked out the door.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm coming back, Todd. I'm just going away on a business trip, I swear.",
        "Todd: To Tennessee.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Now, am I going to have to pick you up and move you or--",
        "Todd: Sounds fun.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm serious. I have a plane to catch, okay?",
        "Todd: Aren't you in the middle of Matthew Buchanan's case?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, and I got a continuance. Now scoot.",
        "Todd: Are you pissed at me because I hired Elijah Clarke? Is that what this is?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't have time for this. I really don't. I--",
        "Todd: Look, I had to hire him. You know that. I couldn't get you. He's--he's got a great reputation. And I think he's going to pull it off. I think he's going to get this judge to overturn his ruling. I want to be able to move out of Dorian's without losing the kids. And Marty just signed off on my sanity, so things are going great.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, that's--",
        "Todd: Clarke's arguing the case as we speak.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's wonderful, Todd. That's just--",
        "Todd: So let's spend the night together.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs]",
        "Todd: Let's get some of that great Chinese take-out that you like, open a bottle of champagne.",
        "T\u00e9a: Chinese food and champagne?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha!",
        "Todd: Don't knock it till you try it. Hell, we could... we could rent a limousine and drive into Manhattan, catch a show and a late dinner, go to the mountains for the weekend. I don't care. I'm just trying to tell you to not leave.",
        "T\u00e9a: I--I have to. I have to. I'm coming back, okay? I swear.",
        "Todd: I don't believe you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why?",
        "Todd: Because I'm smart that way. And you haven't been completely here lately.",
        "T\u00e9a: I have been completely here!",
        "Todd: No, you haven't. You're pulling away. You're doing it right now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, yeah, I have to pull away because I have to catch a flight. Excuse me.",
        "Todd: I'm going with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm going to Tahiti to find Ross. That man helped Todd try to kidnap my kids before.",
        "Dorian: You've got 3 beautiful children and a gorgeous new grandbaby. Nothing is more worthy of your time than they are.",
        "Blair: I'm doing this for my kids. I'm doing it to protect them from that bitch T\u00e9a Delgado. And you know what? It's fine that you don't understand that.",
        "Dorian: No, I don't understand. And I don't want to understand. You are lying to yourself and you're lying to me! I'm done!",
        "Blair: Okay, well--what are you--who are you calling?",
        "Dorian: I am going to call John, because somebody's got to stop you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Well, Keeton bought it. Couldn't wait to shake me off. Took off like a bat out of hell.",
        "John: Any clue where he's headed?",
        "Oliver: Not yet, but I planted a GPS and a bug on him, all in this one tiny chip. It's pretty awesome.",
        "John: How'd you manage that?",
        "Oliver: I swiped his badge from the locker and then I soldered the chip to the back of it. He won't even notice. He's wired up like a Christmas tree and he has no idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: We were good together, weren't we?",
        "Schuyler: Uh, yeah. No, not really. I mean, you were good to me.",
        "Stacy: I was?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I told...told Kim that.",
        "Stacy: You did? That's really nice to hear.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah. No, yeah, I'll never forget it. I mean, even when I was strung out, you were...you were right there, although you were never really number one. It was drugs. Boop! Oh, I guess I wasn't really your number one, either, was I? That would be Rex.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, but you quit drugs and I quit Rex.",
        "Schuyler: [Scoffs] No, no, no. You'll never quit Rex.",
        "Stacy: I had to face the fact that I was never going to win, just like you did.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, but... yeah, but we didn't--we didn't do that...for each other. I mean, it just had to happen. I mean, look at me. I'm a changed--I'm a changed man. I'm clean now, clearly, so there's nothing between us.",
        "Stacy: Don't say that, Schuy. How can you ever say that?",
        "Schuyler: No. I--hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't--I did not mean to make you feel bad.",
        "Stacy: It's okay. You're such a sensitive guy. I always loved that about you.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. I'm a... I'm a sensitive...oh. I--I--I got it. I need to-- I got to lie down.",
        "Stacy: Well, baby, let's put you in bed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So, that's what happens when I get mad at you. You throw that abortion thing in my face.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: I said I was sorry, Rex! Yeah, I hate the idea of that baby, and I wanted it to go away! I made a mistake, but I did that for us. I did that because it makes me sick that Stacy has something new to hold over our heads! But I already sucked it up and apologized to her, for you! And then I had to sit there today and try to keep from puking while you fell all over her! \"Oh, Stacy, you don't have to work. Don't worry. I--I'll take you to the doctor. I'll pay for your insurance.\"",
        "Rex: That's not how I said it!",
        "Gigi: And then I said to Schuyler that I didn't want him! I want you! So, Rex, tell me what else I can do? Because I'm out of answers!",
        "Rex: What else can you do? I got it. How about you get off my back? All I did was suggest that it might be better off for everybody if Schuyler found himself a new place to live!",
        "Gigi: Wow. You are so good at that.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: Turning it around and making it all about you.",
        "Rex: Why do you care so much if Schuyler leaves town?",
        "Gigi: That's not the issue!",
        "Rex: Then what is? Is it the baby?",
        "Gigi: And what if it is? Would that be too hard to understand? I'm not accepting enough that the man I love is going to be having a baby with my bitch of a sister?! And another thing! I am sick of looking like the bad guy when it comes to that baby!",
        "Rex: And I'm sick of looking like the bad guy just because I'm not fine with Schuyler using every tactic in the book to get next to you!",
        "Gigi: I told him that there would never be anything between him and me!",
        "Rex: Well, I told Stacy the same thing.",
        "Gigi: And then you found out that she's having your baby. At least we think it's yours.",
        "Rex: Okay, what if this baby tears us apart, huh? Then what happens? You fall into his arms? Because that's what he wants. He told me so, okay? He's still banking on us not making it. He thinks he has a shot. Now who am I going to blame for that?",
        "Gigi: Try yourself. I've had it. I need some air.",
        "Rex: No, no, no. You're not going anywhere, not until we have this out.",
        "Gigi: Oh, really? Watch me.",
        "Rex: Look. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Remember what we were like in bed? Good times. You always said I made you forget about getting high. Bet if we made love, you'd forget about Gigi for a little while. At least we'd have fun trying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: All right, you see that?",
        "John: Sorry.",
        "Oliver: That's Keeton's location. Every turn he makes, we've got him. Man, I love GPS. Wait, wait, wait, wait. He's making a call. He's asking someone to meet him. Oh, man, Keeton's going to lead us straight to his boss. Now that you mentioned that shipment we're busting, we have got him. But I'm, uh, I'm guessing you don't need a bug to tell you who he's going to meet.",
        "John: Got to be able to prove it, Fish. You sure that thing's recording okay?",
        "Oliver: Uh, yeah, yeah, we're all set.",
        "John: Good.",
        "Oliver: Uh, while we're waiting, I, um, I have something I sort of wanted to run by you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Is this spot free?",
        "Nick: You give me a hand with this stretch and it's all yours. Okay, that sounded like such a line. Trust me, I'm not hitting on you.",
        "Layla: Are you sure? Because I've seen a lot of people hook up in this place, not that I'm one of them, of course.",
        "Nick: Ha ha! Thanks.",
        "Layla: Yep. You know, people say when you're in a relationship, that's when you get hit on.",
        "Nick: Oh, yeah. The confidence factor.",
        "Layla: I guess.",
        "Nick: Well, don't worry. I just started seeing somebody myself.",
        "Layla: Oh. How's it working out?",
        "Nick: Uh, I'm crossing my fingers.",
        "Layla: In that phase, huh?",
        "Nick: Yeah, I kind of have a knack for picking Mr. Wrong.",
        "Layla: You, too, huh? Well, I finally broke that habit. The guy I'm with now is a keeper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Well, you probably heard some rumors, some gossip.",
        "John: No, I don't really do gossip.",
        "Oliver: Oh. Uh, cool. So you know Layla? She and I have sort of been seeing each other.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Oliver: You don't have a problem with that?",
        "John: Why would I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: It wasn't like love at first sight. Stupid me. Took a little time to come around, but now, gosh.",
        "Nick: Well, I hope it goes like that for us, but I don't know. I mean, this dude's carrying a pretty big torch for his ex. Some jerk from his college days.",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Um, are--are you sure? Because I think that this might be the real deal for me.",
        "John: Then what's the problem, Fish?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Sounds complicated. Anything you can't t handle?",
        "Nick: Well, it's kind of messed up. His ex is now dating a woman.",
        "Layla: How's that work?",
        "Nick: It's nothing we haven't heard before. You know, he was never really gay in college, it's just a phase, a big mistake, so he says. And now he's apparently straight.",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I--I sort of need some advice.",
        "John: From me?",
        "Oliver: What would you do if you knew, getting into a relationship, that there's the chance that the woman could get hurt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Give it to--",
        "Dorian: Let me--",
        "Blair: Give it to me.",
        "Dorian: This is stupid. Give the phone back to me.",
        "Blair: No! I do not want John involved in this.",
        "Dorian: He is already involved, Blair. He's the reason that you want to go back to Todd.",
        "Blair: No. He and Todd have nothing to do with this. Come on, Dorian. Haven't you ever just felt like you had to do something, no matter how crazy it seemed at the time? Come on.",
        "Dorian: This is not about me, and I have no idea what you're referring to.",
        "Blair: Oh, really? Should I, uh, make a list? Oh, come on, come on. Just--this is me. I don't want to leave my kids right now, but I have to. This is a secret that could come back to haunt me or the children. Will you just help me out here and just watch the kids while I'm away? Okay, please?",
        "Dorian: Honey... I want you to be honest with me and with yourself. You're just doing this because you still have feelings for Todd.",
        "Blair: No, I'm doing this because I want to stick it to that bitch, T\u00e9a Delgado!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, it makes no sense for you to come with me, okay? I'm not going to be able to see you. I won't have any time to spend with you--",
        "Todd: What am I supposed to do here by myself?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you'll be all right.",
        "Todd: No, that doesn't work for me.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: No, don't go.",
        "T\u00e9a: Stop saying that!",
        "Todd: You're not going away on business. No, I can feel it. Don't disappear on me. Don't disappear on me. You're going to disappear on me just like you did with Ross Rayburn.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was all my fault, wasn't it? I should have never left you with that clown.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, you--you had to get back to Blair. Remember that?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know, I know. Well, never again, though. Never again. Sleeping with her was so stupid... except for the fact that it made me realize who I really want--you. T\u00e9a, stick around. I mean, I can give you what you want.",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you saying, Todd?",
        "Todd: What am I saying? Marty helped me realize some--some stuff, some heavy stuff.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm. One session and you're a new man?",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, I love you. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So, how are you going to hurt Layla?",
        "Oliver: I don't know, but what if I do? What if I blow it or drive her away?",
        "John: What's going on, Fish? You lying to her or something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Sounds like you're dating a guy with a whole lot of baggage. Is his ex- boyfriend out?",
        "Nick: Oh, yeah. I actually met him. He came up to me here and wanted me to stay away from Kyle.",
        "Layla: Kyle? That's who you're dating?",
        "Nick: Yeah, Kyle Lewis. You know him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: That's intense.",
        "Cristian: Hey, how's it going, man?",
        "Kyle: You mean about me and Oliver? I'm okay. I'm just, you know, going to put this whole sorry episode behind me.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Yeah, I'm staying out of it with Layla, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: My roommate knows Kyle. Both my roommates, actually. I--I just know who he is.",
        "Nick: Yeah, he's, uh, he's had some legal problems in the past, but he's such a great guy.",
        "Layla: Yeah. I'm--I'm sure he is.",
        "Nick: He's trying to put all that stuff behind him, but his ex is a cop, and he won't let him forget about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: At this point, it's none of my business, you know? Oliver and Layla can have each other. I'm not wasting my time waiting on a guy who's lying to himself. How you doing?",
        "Cristian: I'm painting, so I'm good.",
        "Kyle: Running does it for me.",
        "Cristian: So we both know what works for us.",
        "Kyle: I guess we're both happy then, right? All right. I'll see ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hey, you okay?",
        "Layla: I don't feel so hot.",
        "Nick: Here, have some of my water.",
        "Layla: No, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: No. No. No, don't stop.",
        "Gigi's voice: Please, kiss me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What about Shane? Is he, um...",
        "Gigi: Good old summer baseball.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Can we just think about this for a moment?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: Okay, in a best-case scenario, you find this known criminal and he doesn't kill or maim you.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Instead, he tells you T\u00e9a's deep, dark secret. You come back here. You reveal it to Todd. Todd is so shocked that he dumps T\u00e9a and declares his love for you.",
        "Blair: I don't care what Todd does after he dumps T\u00e9a.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Did you just say you loved me?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha! Please don't say that.",
        "Todd: It's true. You don't believe I mean it, do you? Well, I can't say as I blame you. But I do mean it. I love you. That's a good thing as far as you're concerned, isn't it? I mean, isn't this what you wanted to hear?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Ha ha! I have, for a long time. But your timing is--is very bad because I have to go now.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a, T\u00e9a, I've been such an idiot. I've been such a fool. That's all going to change. Please stay with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Where did that come from?",
        "Rex: Who cares? It's there, Geeg. It's always there, no matter how pissed off we get at each other.",
        "Gigi: Oh. I didn't know whether to kiss you or wring your neck.",
        "Rex: Well, I'm glad you went with option \"A.\" I must love you like crazy, because I was really mad.",
        "Gigi: Was, huh? Maybe I still am.",
        "Rex: About Schuyler? I am sorry. I have been a jackass. I mean, the dude's got a crush on you, but it doesn't have to be a big deal.",
        "Gigi: So what are you saying?",
        "Rex: You love me, not him.",
        "Gigi: Forever and ever.",
        "Rex: So there's no reason why you can't be friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: No, stop.",
        "Stacy: No, no, just relax.",
        "Schuyler: No, I can't. I can't do this.",
        "Stacy: Yes, you can. You can do it. You were doing so good before.",
        "Schuyler: No!",
        "Stacy: Look, we need this.",
        "Schuyler: No, I can't!",
        "Stacy: We need to move on.",
        "Schuyler: You're not--you're not her. You're not Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: For weeks, you've been on my case about Oliver, saying he's hiding something from me. I think I know what it is, Cristian. I think he's gay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What do you mean, am I lying to Layla? Why--why would you ask me that?",
        "John: Just going off what you said. Why else would she get hurt? Hey, Keeton's stopped. This looks like one of the buildings down at the docks, doesn't it?",
        "Oliver: Right. Well, both us should hear who Keeton's meeting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I have to go now. I have to go now.",
        "Todd: No, no, no. You can't go now. You just--something else came up that you --you have to cancel the trip. That's it.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not that simple, okay? I--I can't just call in sick, all right? I have a job to do.",
        "Todd: Say that you can't come and to get another lawyer. God, I just put myself on the line here! Wait a minute. Do you love me?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Yes, Todd. God help me. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You deserve a man who truly loves you, who earns your love. Honey... why don't you do something new? Try living your own life? I am.",
        "Blair: You are?",
        "Dorian: I told you, I've decided I want to get my old job back as chief of staff at the hospital.",
        "Blair: Well, that is just lovely for you. I'm working to keep that shady bitch away from my kids.",
        "Dorian: Don't do this. Don't humiliate yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You can't be serious, Schuy. I'm practically throwing myself on you.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, I know. Ha ha! I know. It's very nice. It's very nice. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Stace. I don't want you. I only want Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm going to take a shower. You want to join me?",
        "Gigi: In a sec. I need to straighten up so Shane doesn't think we did what we did.",
        "Rex: Got it. I am sorry.",
        "Gigi: It's okay. You don't have to keep saying it.",
        "Rex: I love you, Morasco.",
        "Gigi: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: No, you need to go, Stacy. You need to go, now.",
        "Stacy: Okay, just give me a second.",
        "Schuyler: Bye.",
        "Stacy: Fine!",
        "Stacy: How am I going to get pregnant now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I was talking to this guy in the gym. We--we were just talking. I don't even know him, but what he said? I think Oliver used to be involved with Kyle Lewis. You know something, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keeton's voice: McBain knows there's a mole in the P.D., but he doesn't know it's me, or that you're the one running things.",
        "Oliver: Who do you think he's talking to?",
        "John: We're about to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Whatever it is, dump it. Stay here with me.",
        "T\u00e9a: I really want to, Todd.",
        "Todd: Do it.",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't. I can't.",
        "Todd: No, let that go. Hey, come on. Just drop it. Whatever's--drop it. Let everything go except this moment, except us. Come on. Don't make me beg you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, I love you, too, sweetheart. Bye. Tahiti, here I come. Now I'm going to tell everybody about you, T\u00e9a Delgado. And you won't even see it coming."
