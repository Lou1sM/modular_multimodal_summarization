    "Recap": [
        "Gigi and Rex are solid again and agree that Stacy will be in their lives so they must learn to deal with it. Stacy returns to Rex's loft and tells Kim that Schuyler did not have sex with her so she is out of options. She cannot get pregnant so she must tell Rex that she miscarried. John McBain and Oliver Fish listen to a bugged conversation between Officer Keaton and Mayor Lowell in which they discover that the Mayor is behind the drug trafficking ring in Llanview. They hear Keaton telling the mayor that John knows about tonight's delivery. John decides to go ahead with the raid anyway so that the mayor will not become suspicious. Layla tells Cristian that she thinks Fish is gay and that he was involved with Kyle. After she badgers him, Cris admits that he saw Lyle and Oliver kissing. Layla calls Fish and tells him that she needs to talk to him at home after he gets off work. Langston goes to the Buchanan home looking for Markko. Matthew tells her he is in the stable where David and his crew are hiding. When Langston goes to the stable, only Ford is there Ford is shirtless behind the stable cooling off by pouring water on hid head. Langston stares at him until he notices her. He tells her that Markko is not there, as he has gone with David and Priscilla to get footage on Rachel and Greg. David captures Rachel and Greg on the floor in the Buchanan living room and asks her about two brothers battling for her. She demands that he destroy the footage and kicks him out. Langston and Ford discuss options for David's show. While they are discussing the love story angle, Markko comes in and overhears Ford asking Langston if she would be his love interest in the show."

        "Gigi: How was your shower?",
        "Rex: Would have been better if you had joined me.",
        "Gigi: Well, maybe you need another shower. Maybe you missed a few spots.",
        "Rex: I don't have to check in with UV and I turned off my phone.",
        "Gigi: What if Shane calls?",
        "Rex: Shane from baseball practice? Are you kidding?",
        "Gigi: Or Stacy?",
        "[Rex sighs]",
        "Gigi: If she decides there's anything wrong with her or the baby, she's gonna be calling you, not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: That was fast. Usually with butterfly 7, things take a little longer.",
        "Stacy: Yeah. Not this time.",
        "Kim: What do you think? Do you like this one or too orangey?",
        "Stacy: I really don't know.",
        "Kim: So, tell Kim everything.",
        "Stacy: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Kim: Wasn't as good as you remembered it, was it? Never is. But who cares? As long as it gets you Rex.",
        "Stacy: That's the thing. It didn't.",
        "Kim: What are you talking about? Sex equals baby, and baby equals Rex.",
        "Stacy: There is no baby.",
        "Kim: You can't know that already.",
        "Stacy: Yes, I can. There's no baby because there wasn't any sex.",

        "Langston: Hi. I'm Langston. I'm looking for Markko. He's been working the camera for David Vickers' new reality show.",
        "Rachel: Believe me, I know.",
        "Langston: Well, is he around?",
        "Rachel: You might actually want to check the hospital. The last I heard, he was running out of here dodging bullets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, boss.",
        "Ford: Not now. I'm thinking.",
        "Markko: It's just that--",
        "Ford: What?",
        "Markko: Is there any chance we'll be getting paid soon?",
        "Ford: You'll get your money...I hope.",
        "Markko: Priscilla and I have been talking--",
        "Priscilla: We know that David's already blown the show's budget.",
        "Ford: Hey, we'll make it all back.",
        "Markko: Even if there's no show?",
        "Ford: And why wouldn't there be a show?",
        "Priscilla: Uh, we're living in a stable.",
        "Markko: We want our money.",
        "David: People, people, people! Shame on you. Have you never heard of suffering for your art?",
        "Markko: I've suffered enough. It's 110 degrees and I'm standing in horse manure.",
        "David: Look, I know things look bad, but that's why we have to pull together.",
        "Ford: Wait. Why is that, exactly?",
        "David: Because we're a family. No, we're more than a family. We are a television show about a family. We can't let something like horse manure come between us. Now, let's hug it out. Who wants to hug me first?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I was talking to this guy in the gym. We were just talking. I don't even know him. But what he said... I think Oliver used to be involved with Kyle Lewis. You know something, don't you? Chris, please tell me.",
        "Cristian: Look, I don't know if I know anything. I thought I did. I know, I'm confused myself.",
        "Layla: Cristian, please, come on. Whatever it is, just tell me.",
        "Cristian: I don't know. All right, look, why don't you tell me what you heard first and then we can figure this whole thing out?",
        "Layla: I met this guy that dated Kyle.",
        "Cristian: And what did he say?",
        "Layla: That Kyle's boyfriend in college was a closet case.",
        "Cristian: That's all?",
        "Layla: The closet case is now dating a woman and he's a cop. Do you think this cop could be Fish?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keeton: McBain knows there's a mole in the P.D., but he doesn't know it's me, or that you're the one running things.",
        "Oliver: Who do you think he's talking to?",
        "John: We're about to find out.",
        "Keeton: He also knows we're getting a package today and when and where.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Oh, he does, does he? Quite the detective, that McBain.",
        "Oliver: Is that the mayor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Probably more than just because Kyle",
        "Layla: I'm crazy, right? Just because Kyle's ex is a cop doesn't mean he's Oliver.",
        "Cristian: No, it doesn't.",
        "Layla: There's a ton of cops at the L.P.D. Who knows how many are gay?",
        "Cristian: Probably more than you think.",
        "Layla: And so what if Oliver knew Kyle in college? That doesn't mean he's the one Oliver had a messed-up relationship with.",
        "Cristian: Oliver said he had a messed-up relationship?",
        "Layla: But I told him our pasts didn't matter, and when I asked him if he was gay, he got all upset that I even asked him something like that.",
        "Cristian: He did?",
        "Layla: So...What do you know?",
        "Cristian: I don't think Oliver was telling you the truth.",
        "Layla: You think that relationship was with a guy?",
        "Cristian: And I'm pretty sure it's not just in the past. It's in the now, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I don't believe this. Is Keeton really talking to--",
        "Mayor Lowell: What else have you got?",
        "Keeton: McBain's busting the drop.",
        "Mayor Lowell: I figured he would. What's the plan of attack?",
        "Keeton: He wouldn't give it up. Just told us to be ready to roll.",
        "Mayor Lowell: That's all?",
        "Keeton: He plays things pretty close to the vest.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Then you need to convince him to take you into his confidence. I need to be apprised of every move John McBain makes. It's the only way this operation will succeed.",
        "Oliver: That's Mayor Lowell Keeton's talking to, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Why don't you come in?",
        "Man: We'll be back to pay you later.",
        "Langston: Great. Thanks. Markko said something on the phone about Mr. Buchanan and a gun.",
        "Rachel: You know what? Actually I wasn't even here.",
        "Langston: But I just thought he was being dramatic.",
        "Rachel: I'm sure he was.",
        "Langston: It doesn't look like it.",
        "Rachel: Trust me, if blood had been spilled, I would have heard about it.",
        "Langston: But this whole thing was my idea. I mean, if something happens to him, it's my fault.",
        "Matthew: Are you guys talking about Markko?",
        "Rachel: Yeah. Do you know where he is?",
        "Matthew: Uh, I might have an idea.",
        "Rachel: Well, tell Langston. She's worried about him.",
        "Matthew: Markko's fine.",
        "Langston: Okay. Well, where is he?",
        "Matthew: First you have to swear not to give his location away to anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I can't work like this, David.",
        "Markko: I need to eat something besides oats.",
        "David: I apologize about the accommodations. I realize there's not a craft service table, but think of it this way. It didn't come out of the budget.",
        "Ford: Yeah, what's left of it.",
        "David: I promised you a very generous salary.",
        "Ford: Yeah, and then you went and spent it on your brother's legal bills.",
        "David: And if I didn't do that, we wouldn't have a place to stay. Now see how it all works out?",
        "Ford: We have no money, no story, no cast, no bathrooms.",
        "David: Yes, but look what we do have.",
        "Ford: Oh, um, buckets, horseflies, hay.",
        "David: Atmosphere.",
        "Ford: You can't make a show out of atmosphere, David, believe me. I've tried.",
        "David: Well, what do you want me to do? You're the producer. I'm just the talent.",
        "Ford: Okay, solve one of these problems, any one, or I go.",
        "Priscilla: So do I.",
        "Markko: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Wait. Wait a minute. You and Schuyler did not have sex?",
        "Stacy: Nope.",
        "Kim: But butterfly 7...",
        "Stacy: Didn't work.",
        "Kim: You used it right, didn't you?",
        "Stacy: Oh, come on. I know how to mix a drink.",
        "Kim: Maybe Schuy didn't drink enough.",
        "Stacy: He downed the whole thing.",
        "Kim: Then he shouldn't have been able to keep his hands off you.",
        "Stacy: He couldn't for the first few minutes. It was like 2006 all over again. He actually wanted me.",
        "Kim: Then why didn't he sleep with you?",
        "Stacy: Because he figured out I wasn't Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Miss any calls?",
        "Rex: Not from Stacy. So, how about you go take that shower?",
        "Gigi: Way to ruin the mood, Geeg.",
        "Rex: Nothing's ruined.",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry. I'm really trying not to think about her, really I am.",
        "Rex: You do not need to be sorry for not wanting this child in our lives. I get it.",
        "Gigi: It's just...if there was a problem, I know that you'd want to be there and she'd want you to be there, too. I mean, she's gonna use this baby against us every chance she gets.",
        "Rex: Maybe. But right now, I'm with you. And you're the only person I want to think about.",
        "Gigi: Ditto.",
        "Rex: So let's see how long we can go without mentioning \"her.\"",
        "Gigi: Who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Schuyler passed up a night with me, no strings attached, only because I'm not Gigi.",
        "Kim: I don't get it. Does she know some trick? I mean, she must be doing something.",
        "Stacy: That's it. She's not. She's always had everybody's attention: My parents, boys, you name it.",
        "Kim: What's so special about her?",
        "Stacy: Oh, I'd like to know the same thing. She's just a big-mouth waitress with a bratty little kid and she always gets what I want.",
        "Kim: Don't worry. Gigi will get what's coming to her.",
        "Stacy: How do you know that?",
        "Kim: You forget everything you learned in Vegas? Everyone's lucky streak has to end sometime.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, mine sure has. I can't even get myself pregnant.",
        "Kim: We just need a plan \"B.\"",
        "Stacy: That's the thing, Kimmy. There is no plan \"B.\" Schuyler was my last hope. It's over. I lose.",

        "Langston: So David and his camera crew are hiding out in the stables?",
        "Matthew: Great idea, right?",
        "Langston: If you don't like indoor plumbing.",
        "Matthew: It's just temporary. I'll find something new for them.",
        "Langston: And you really think no one will find them?",
        "Matthew: I don't see why they would. We don't have any horses right now, and plus David and his crew are trying to keep a low profile.",
        "Langston: How well do you know your older brother?",
        "Rachel: Did you guys figure out where Markko is?",
        "Matthew: Aren't you hot?",
        "Rachel: I'm quite comfortable, thank you.",
        "Matthew: Well, what's in the bag?",
        "Rachel: I have to get work done and my office is a mess. Can you tell Nigel I don't want to be disturbed by anyone?",
        "Matthew: Okay. What, are you working on what you're going to say when you testify for my case?",
        "Rachel: What I say is my business.",
        "Langston: Well, thanks for your help.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, sure.",
        "Greg: Oh, hi. I'm looking for Matthew.",
        "Langston: Oh, right over there.",
        "Greg: Thanks. Matthew, hey.",
        "Matthew: What's up?",
        "Greg: Yeah, I heard what happened in court. Sounds like your family's lawyer gave you the real going-over.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Greg: Well, figured it wouldn't hurt to make a house call. Like, Rachel's not around, is she?",
        "Matthew: Why?",
        "Greg: Well, it's probably best for both of us if we keep our distance from one another.",
        "Matthew: Uh, could you hold on a minute?",
        "Greg: Yeah. Everything okay?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I just, uh, I just got to do something. You could wait in the living room if you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You all wouldn't abandon me here, would you?",
        "Ford: For air-conditioning? In a Llanview minute.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "David: Hold that thought. David Vickers-Buchanan productions. David Vickers- Buchanan speaking.",
        "Matthew: Get up here now. Bring the crew.",
        "David: What's going down?",
        "Matthew: Something good.",
        "David: We got a live one, folks.",
        "Ford: Well, what are you waiting for, dude? Get out there and get it.",
        "David: Without my producer?",
        "Ford: I have to stay here and work on story ideas.",
        "David: Ford, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for trusting me with your vision.",
        "Ford: Whatever. Just don't come back without something usable.",
        "David: Markko! Prissy!",
        "Priscilla: I told you not to call me that.",
        "David: Grab your gear. It's time to make magic, people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What are you waiting for? We could bust the mayor right now.",
        "Keeton: How do you suggest I get on McBain's good side? I don't even know if he has a good side.",
        "Mayor Lowell: McBain values loyalty. You follow that fool's orders like a good soldier and keep me updated.",
        "Keeton: What do you do?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Good-bye, Officer.",
        "Oliver: All right. I got Keeton's location.",
        "John: Let me see.",
        "Oliver: Right over there by the waterfront.",
        "John: Yeah? It's by Lowell's campaign headquarters.",
        "Mayor Lowell: The delivery that was scheduled for today. Cancel it. I don't care how much it costs us. There's going to be a raid. My source in the department. No. We'll reschedule. It is not going to be a problem. We will always be one step ahead of John McBain.",
        "Oliver: You really don't want to move in on Lowell?",
        "John: Not yet.",
        "Oliver: But we got him dead to rights.",
        "John: We got us something better than that.",
        "Oliver: What?",
        "John: Lowell says I act before I think? I'm not going to prove him wrong.",

        "Cristian: Maybe you should talk to Fish about this.",
        "Layla: Cris?",
        "Cristian: Layla, this has nothing to do with me.",
        "Layla: Do you care about me?",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Layla: Are we really friends?",
        "Cristian: Yes, of course we are.",

        "Gigi: Balsom, what do you want to do for dinner? I haven't had a chance to go to the store. So unless you want Shane food...",
        "Rex: It's already taken care of.",
        "Gigi: You found the chicken nuggets?",
        "Rex: I ordered from the Palace.",
        "Gigi: Uh, ahem. Can we afford that?",
        "Rex: Well, they take plastic, don't they? It'll be here any minute.",
        "Gigi: Isn't it a little early?",
        "Rex: Well, I don't know about you, but I kind of worked up an appetite.",
        "Gigi: Mmm.",
        "Rex: Money is no object. This is all on Blair Cramer.",
        "Gigi: Remind me to thank her.",
        "Rex: Nope. Tonight we don't think about anyone else, anything else. No worries, no problems. Tonight is just you and me.",
        "Gigi: I like the sound of that.",
        "Rex: This is our night off from our lives.",

        "Kim: All right, all right. Nobody's lost anything yet. Let's not get crazy.",
        "Stacy: Okay, I stop ovulating soon. There's nothing I can do.",
        "Kim: Is that what you said when Stan kicked us out of the Diamond Room?",
        "Stacy: Oh, and he put those bitches Leah and Laura Dean on instead of us?",
        "Kim: You snuck us in. We made twice their tips in half the time.",
        "Stacy: I forgot about that.",
        "Kim: See? I know you better than you know yourself. You've never lost anything you wanted to hang on to, so unless you're saying you don't want Rex--",
        "Stacy: No, no, no. I do want Rex.",
        "Kim: That's the Stacy Morasco I know and love. Now, what are our options? You said a sperm bank's out.",
        "Stacy: It's too expensive, and if somebody were to see me and rat me out, that wouldn't be good.",
        "Kim: Right, right. Let's keep it simple. Why don't we just find another guy?",
        "Stacy: No, there's not enough time.",
        "Kim: And if we wait another month, Rex will know it's not his. What if we hire someone?",
        "Stacy: You are not serious.",
        "Kim: We'll check him out first.",
        "Stacy: No. There's only one thing left I can do.",

        "Layla: They weren't just, like, horsing around?",
        "Cristian: No. No, they were into it.",
        "Layla: I don't feel very good.",
        "Cristian: I'm sorry, Layla. I'm so sorry.",
        "Layla: When did you see them?",
        "Cristian: A few days ago.",
        "Layla: When were you going to tell me? Were you ever going to tell me?",
        "Cristian: I didn't know what to do.",
        "Layla: When you saw my boyfriend kissing another guy?",
        "Cristian: I wasn't sure until now.",
        "Layla: You just said--",
        "Cristian: Yes, yes, it was a kiss, but Fish pushed Kyle away.",
        "Layla: He did?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, and he said he wasn't gay, that what happened in college didn't mean anything, that Kyle was the one who wanted it.",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Cristian: But it looked to me like Fish wanted it, too.",

        "Oliver: So how long do we let Lowell run this poison into our city?",
        "John: Just calm down.",
        "Oliver: Well, you said that he's blaming the whole drug problem on us.",
        "John: Can't arrest Lowell yet.",
        "Oliver: But we heard him talking to Keeton about the raid.",
        "John: He can say he was being advised of department action against a drug trafficking operation.",
        "Oliver: But we heard him. He's already warning people off of it, and the shipment won't go down.",
        "John: Today it won't.",
        "Oliver: So then what? I guess we call off the raid?",
        "John: Oh, no. That goes off as planned.",
        "Oliver: Why? It's pointless.",
        "John: It'll come up empty. It'll be far from pointless.",
