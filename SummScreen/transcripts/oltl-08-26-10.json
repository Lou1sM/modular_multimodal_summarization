        "David is being held prisoner in Morocco, and surprisingly Clint is behind it. He informs David that he won't let him take his family's fortune and share it with Dorian, regardless of whether David is Bo's biological son. Clint also smugly tells David, he's made Dorian believe that David has left her at the alter and after that, David must know that she is not about to care where he is or what has happened to him. Neither will Bo when everybody believes that David is a no good person and has no way of proving otherwise. Meanwhile, Dorian is emotionally devastated. Starr and Langston stand by her side and support her although they both have incomplete issues in their lives; Starr with the dilemma of whether to stay with Cole or admit her feelings for James, and Langston with not knowing who is right for her. Eli has Blair with him in Tahiti and she wants him to believe she trusts him. But the cops are ready to find him at any cost."

        "David: You.",
        "Clint: Salam wa aleikum, David.",
        "David: Is that one of our family secret passwords?",
        "Clint: It's Arabic, meaning \"peace be upon you.\" Learn it because there's one thing that's very scarce behind bars--peace. Have you noticed that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: \"Dear Dorian. I can't marry you. I realize now till death do us part doesn't work for me. I can't be tied down.\" Yada yada yada yada yada yada yada. \"I guarantee this hurts me more than it hurts you. Lotsa love, David.\" Hi, darling. I thought you'd [Sniff] Gone.",
        "Langston: You really think we'd leave without you? Starr's just calling to get a car. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?",
        "Dorian: You can stop feeling sorry for me, for starters. I'm sorry. Well, maybe you could help me start packing my things up.",
        "Langston: Yeah. I mean, we don't have to go right away if you want to wait in case...",
        "Dorian: In case David comes bursting through the door and sweeps me up in his arms? Dream on. That train has left. He's a man. He's just another man, a wretched man who has failed a Cramer woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay, great. Thanks. We'll see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: The two cabanas that Blair and Eli were in have been sealed off. As you know, we didn't see any sign of a struggle.",
        "Natalie: Well, that doesn't mean there wasn't one.",
        "John: Exactly. We're assuming Blair went willingly, but if she didn't, we need to find that out. Brody, obviously we're looking for any indication of where Eli may have taken her.",
        "Brody: We're on it.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "Marty: Hi, Natalie. How are you?",
        "Natalie: Um, just--I'm leaving. Brody and I have an assignment, but great to see you.",
        "John: Thanks for coming down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Well, things seem pretty good between you and Marty.",
        "Natalie: You think?",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: I don't know, Brody. You might want to rethink the whole detective thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Um, on the phone you said there was a new development on my case.",
        "John: Hannah O'Connor wasn't your attacker.",
        "Marty: Well, how--how do you know?",
        "John: We have a source with new information.",
        "Marty: Who?",
        "John: Robert Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: How did you get in here?",
        "Jessica: Trade secret.",
        "Ford: Yeah, well, this day's been bad enough without finding you at the end of the rainbow. Go home.",
        "Jessica: Forget it. There's something I need to know, and I'm not leaving here until you tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You shouldn't be here.",
        "James: I came to say good-bye to Langston.",
        "Starr: Well, she's in there with her mom. And after the non-wedding today, I think it's safe to say this is not a guy-friendly zone right now.",
        "Langston: Hi.",
        "James: I just came to say thank you.",
        "Langston: Really?",
        "James: Well, I'm sorry about how things turned out, but I'm not sorry that you invited me, so maybe we could do this again sometime?",
        "Langston: Uh, okay.",
        "James: Okay?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "James: Okay. All right. Good night.",
        "Langston: Good night.",
        "Dorian: Is anyone lurking out there?",
        "Starr: You mean, like reporters?",
        "Dorian: Starr, honey, I mean is anyone lurking?",
        "Starr: No. No one's here. It's just us.",
        "Langston: Us against the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: This is incredible. How can I ever thank you, Uncle Clint?",
        "Clint: For what?",
        "David: For showing up. Any minute, this place was gonna go \"Midnight Express\" on me.",
        "Clint: \"Midnight Express.\"",
        "David: Yeah, the movie. You know. Remember that scene where the warden tries--",
        "Clint: Yeah, I know, David. But in the movie, there was this big escape. In here, my friend, there's no such thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: How's it looking in here?",
        "Natalie: Nothing much that indicates the use of force and no signs of Blair. Lights, please.",
        "Brody: Gonna be a long night, you think?",
        "Natalie: Why? You got somewhere to be?",
        "Brody: I just wanted to check in with Jessica. She went to the O.B. today.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know. I saw her when I had my appointment.",
        "Brody: Everything okay?",
        "Natalie: Yes, and, Brody, you don't need to worry, remember? It's not your baby.",
        "Brody: I know, but--",
        "Natalie: Seriously. Where it said \"father,\" I put down John McBain's name, and as far as I'm concerned and everyone else is concerned, John is my baby's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Why would Robert Ford have any bearing on my case? I know we were both attacked--did he exonerate Hannah somehow?",
        "John: Let's just say it's clear now that Hannah O'Connor is innocent.",
        "Marty: She did not push me?",
        "John: She didn't attack him either.",
        "Marty: Well, then who did?",
        "John: Eli Clarke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I don't have time for this, Jessica. I've got people coming over.",
        "Jessica: Right. Well, don't worry. I'll make it quick. I need to know your Rh factor.",
        "Ford: My what?",
        "Jessica: It's part of your blood type. Because, God forbid, if this baby is yours--",
        "Ford: You said I wasn't the father!",
        "Jessica: And you won't be, but if there's even a remote possibility, I need to know whether you're Rh positive or negative.",
        "Ford: Why?",
        "Jessica: Because if we're incompatible, the baby's in danger.",
        "Ford: In danger? You mean, like, it could die?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, no. Please, stop holding on to me, girls. I'm not going to collapse.",
        "Starr: We never said that you were.",
        "Langston: Dorian Lord does not collapse.",
        "Starr: We just thought that you might like to use the company.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no, no. That's very sweet of you, but the worst has already happened. It can only go uphill from here.",
        "Starr: That's the spirit.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. I've just got to face it. David has left me because that's what David does. He leaves. Don't worry. I'm gonna be all right.",
        "David: Nobody does it better.",
        "Starr: Hey, hey.",
        "Dorian: Damn you, David!",
        "Langston: Oh!",
        "Dorian: Damn you! How could you leave me again?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Don't you get me wrong. I'm not asking you to dig me out of here personally. Just, you know, spread some of those nice Buchanan greenbacks around.",
        "Clint: I'm afraid it's not gonna be that simple.",
        "David: Are you kidding? You give each of these guards 100 bucks, they'll carry me out of here on a throne. Now get me out of here, man! Hurry! I'm late to my wedding. Dorian's got to be worried sick about me.",
        "Clint: Well, after you dumped her, I don't think worried is the right word.",
        "David: What are you talking about? I didn't dump her.",
        "Clint: Tell me something. Is that not your handwriting? If that's not the end of David and Dorian, I don't know what is.",
        "David: I don't--what--this doesn't make any sense.",
        "Clint: Yeah, of course it does. Give me that. \"Dear Dorian, I cannot marry you. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I can't be tied down. It's not you, Dorian; it's me. Lotsa love, David.\" Ha ha ha! This is vintage Vickers. How can you say that you didn't write this?",
        "David: I didn't! Look, I admit, that--that does look like my handwriting, and I may have said--well, I did actually say that once, but I didn't write this letter, Uncle Clint.",
        "Clint: Yeah. I know that. But Dorian doesn't.",
        "David: Wait. You? You're the one who nabbed me from the cabana.",
        "Clint: Ooh, you catch on fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Aah! I can't stand this room! It just reeks of David and David's things! Aah!",
        "Starr: Watch the--okay.",
        "Langston: Dorian, Dorian, here. How about this? How about you just go take a nice, long, hot shower, and Starr and I will de-Davify the room.",
        "Starr: Oh, that's a great idea. We will get rid of every trace of him, okay?",
        "Dorian: Good luck with that, and by the way, that letter you've been trying to hide from me--David's letter. Destroy it.",
        "Langston: Okay. Absolutely. And don't worry. By the time you come out here, it'll be like David never even existed. Just go turn on the hot water and just--",
        "Dorian: Wash that man right out of my hair? Ha ha ha!",
        "Langston: Exactly.",
        "Dorian: Okay.",
        "Starr: What a disaster.",
        "Langston: Yeah. You think?",
        "Starr: Dorian's just in so much shock.",
        "Langston: Yeah, well, me, too. It looked like they had it together this time, both of them.",
        "Starr: Looks can be deceiving. Kind of the way James looks at you.",
        "Langston: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Starr: Nothing. No, never mind. I'm sorry that I said that.",
        "Langston: No, but you did, so, um, why don't you finish it?",
        "Starr: Don't believe everything James says, okay?",
        "Langston: James has not lied to me, at least not yet, and if he does, I'll call him out on it. Don't worry.",
        "Starr: Not yet? It sounds like you're planning on seeing him again. Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: What do you mean exactly?",
        "Jessica: If our Rh factors don't match, it can cause complications.",
        "Ford: Fatal complications?",
        "Jessica: Sometimes.",
        "Ford: Okay.",
        "Jessica: I lost a baby once because I was unaware of the Rh incompatibility until it was too late, and I don't want that to happen to this baby.",
        "Ford: Rh positive.",
        "Jessica: Thanks.",
        "Ford: Wait a second. At least tell me if that's good or bad.",
        "Jessica: It could be bad if I was unaware, but now that I know, I can protect my baby.",
        "Ford: You do that.",
        "Jessica: Excuse me.",
        "James: You really don't waste any time, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Didn't you already check for blood traces?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, on the door, not the door frame. Look, if you want to go, it's fine. I can handle it.",
        "Brody: No. I can wait. Must be hard.",
        "Natalie: What? Learning forensics?",
        "Brody: No. Being around Marty.",
        "Natalie: What does she have to do with this?",
        "Brody: I just thought maybe you were taking a little extra time so you could be sure she was gone when you got back. You might want to take back what you said about my detective skills. I think I'm on point.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, there was a reason I asked you to wait outside.",
        "Cole: Look, I knew a long time ago that Hannah's confession was bogus. Obviously Eli Clarke forced her into it.",
        "Marty: Well, apparently he did a lot of terrible things.",
        "John: Yes, but we need to keep this quiet for now until he's apprehended.",
        "Cole: And when is that gonna be?",
        "Marty: I don't understand. What was his motive?",
        "John: I guess--I guess Ford had some information on Eli, and he wanted him gone, and Hannah had seen Eli push you down the stairs, and he needed to find a way to control her.",
        "Marty: Not too hard when the person you're trying to control is unstable enough to try to commit suicide.",
        "John: I don't think that was her choice this time.",
        "Cole: What do you mean?",
        "John: Eli forced her to swallow a pile of pills.",
        "Cole: That sick freak.",
        "John: Hey, Cole.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "John: All right, settle down, man. Listen to me. Eli's gone, and we need to locate him.",
        "Cole: You don't know where he is?",
        "John: We're gonna find him.",
        "Cole: What about Starr's mom?",
        "John: Blair is with him, but we are gonna bring her home. We are gonna bring her home safe, all right? But I need your help with that.",
        "Cole: How?",
        "John: You can't tell Starr. You can't say anything to Starr, all right? The last thing we need is the Cramers or anyone else taking matters into their own hands.",
        "Cole: Okay.",
        "John: Okay? Hey, you know, look at me. This is important. I need more than you just saying okay. I need your word on this one.",
        "Cole: All right, I promise I won't say anything to Starr.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Cole: I got to get going. I need to be somewhere. Mom, you gonna be all right?",
        "Marty: I'm fine, honey. Thank you for coming with me.",
        "John: Don't forget I know you. You're not fine any more than I am. We know the truth about what happened to the baby. It's like going through it all over again.",
        "Marty: But maybe knowing the truth will make it easier. I don't think anything does that.",
        "John: No, nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: That'll eat up a little bit more time.",
        "Natalie: Oh, would you stop?",
        "Brody: It's not like you to avoid anyone, that's all.",
        "Natalie: Look, this is the first time that Marty and I have seen each other since she took the letter that I wrote to John.",
        "Brody: She what?",
        "Natalie: That's the reason John didn't show up at Rodi's the night that I was supposed to go to London.",
        "Brody: And you ended up at my place. He didn't show because he didn't know you were waiting.",
        "Natalie: She didn't want him to know, and John didn't tell me that she intercepted the letter, but I figured it out.",
        "Brody: Must make things more tricky between you and Marty.",
        "Natalie: Think so now? Wait till she finds out I'm pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I just don't understand why he went after me at all.",
        "John: The theory being floated around is, I was working on a case that was gonna lead me to him. He wanted to point me in another direction, and he knew that if anything happened to you, you'd become my priority. I should have seen what he was doing.",
        "Marty: Oh, John, you can't take responsibility for every bad thing that happens. I never got too far trying to convince you of that. Maybe Natalie will have a better chance.",
        "John: Speaking of Natalie, there's something I should tell you.",
        "Marty: What is it?",
        "John: She's pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Thank you for all your help.",
        "Brody: That's my job.",
        "Natalie: I don't just mean the job. I mean letting me vent about Marty.",
        "Brody: You worried about what she might do when she finds out about the baby?",
        "Natalie: I'm worried about what I might do to her. Look, Brody, if she hadn't taken that letter--if she hadn't taken that letter, then John would have showed up at Rodi's that night. John would have been with me. I wouldn't have gotten drunk. I would not have slept with you, and then you wouldn't be worried about having two babies with two sisters, and I wouldn't be worried about who my baby's father is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You forged that letter to Dorian?",
        "Clint: Of course not. I hired a professional. He's real good, a real perfectionist. He even went on your MyFace page to check out your syntax and your spelling, or rather, your lack of it.",
        "David: I don't understand. Why would you do that?",
        "Clint: Why do you think?",
        "David: Honestly, Uncle Clint, I have no id--",
        "Clint: Don't \"Uncle Clint\" me. Vickers, you took the woman I love away from me. I am repaying you in kind.",
        "David: Wait. This is about Kim?",
        "Clint: Kimberly. Yes. My wife Kimberly.",
        "David: I gave you everything I had, everything I had, so you could track her down.",
        "Clint: It wasn't enough. You're the reason I lost her. Now you're losing Dorian.",
        "David: I haven't lost Dorian.",
        "Clint: Oh, no?",
        "David: She'll see through that letter. She knows I love her. She know I would never leave her.",
        "Clint: Well, you left her before.",
        "David: That was different.",
        "Clint: To Dorian, it is all too familiar because she knows, David. She knows the kind of guy that you are, the kind of guy who will never love anyone as much as you love yourself, the kind of guy with whom the Cramer women make the same stupid mistake time after time after time.",

        "Ford: When did you decide it was okay to start using my jacket?",
        "James: I don't go to a lot of weddings. I needed something to wear.",
        "Ford: Next time, ask.",
        "James: Ooh, why so touchy? What's wrong, Blondie didn't want you? Who was that chick, anyway?",
        "Ford: Somebody I'm not gonna go near for a very, very long time unless I want to get tested for another STD.",
        "James: What's the big deal? Don't you have a clinic on speed dial, anyway?",
        "Ford: You're on a roll tonight, twinkle toes. I hope you're still laughing when you have to come up with your half of the rent.",
        "James: What? Dude, you said you had it covered. You told me that you owed me for, you know, leaving me alone with Dad.",
        "Ford: That was before you decided to grab everything that used to be mine.",
        "James: Like Langston?",
        "Ford: I'll take the rent in cash. I'm going to bed.",
        "James: Bobby, look. Stop. Man, if you don't want me to go out with Langston, just say so.",
        "Ford: I don't want you to go out with Langston.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Sorry I took so long.",
        "Starr: Who knew two glasses could break into so many little pieces?",
        "Langston: Oh, yeah. Well, not as many pieces as Dorian is in right now.",
        "Starr: Well, that's what happens when you give your heart to the wrong person.",
        "Langston: Give your heart to the wrong person? I have not given my heart to James.",
        "Starr: I wasn't talking about James.",
        "Langston: Um, are you sure about that? Because you manage to bring him up quite a bit, Starr.",
        "Starr: I was just looking out for you, Langston. What? I asked you if you were going to see him again, and all of a sudden, you had an emergency run to go find the dustpan and brush. That's the only thing I was talking about.",
        "Langston: Okay. Well, maybe I am gonna see James again. I mean, we had a lot of fun. Why shouldn't I try and get to know him?",
        "Starr: Because I don't want you to get hurt, okay?",
        "Langston: Are you really that scared that I'll get hurt, Starr, or is it something else?",
        "Starr: Forget it. I don't have to talk to you about this anymore. Do whatever you want. I don't care.",
        "Langston: No, no, no. I think you do care. I think you care more than you want to. I mean, you love Cole, but you just can't get James off your mind.",

        "Hannah: Cole? What are you doing here?",
        "Cole: Well, I'm here for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You really care about her, don't you? I mean, you pretend that it's all just a little hook-up, but there's really something there.",
        "Ford: No. I just don't think brothers should date each other's exes.",
        "James: Okay. Done.",
        "Ford: Are you serious?",
        "James: Well, I'm not saying I'll never talk to the girl again, but I won't ask her out.",
        "Ford: Thanks.",
        "James: Look. Don't get your hopes up, Bobby, and just because I'm backing off doesn't mean that Langston is gonna come running right back to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I just don't want you making the same mistake that I did.",
        "Starr: What mistake?",
        "Langston: I should've come talk to you the first second I even thought about cheating on Markko. You might've helped me realize I was just fooling myself. So if you're keeping something inside, don't. Just tell me what's going on with James.",
        "Starr: Okay. Okay. You're right. I've been thinking about James...a lot, more than I should, and it doesn't even matter. I have no right to be getting jealous. I don't love James. I love Cole, and no matter what problems we have, we're gonna work it out together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I found out about Eli Clarke.",
        "Hannah: What?",
        "Cole: Yeah. John told me all of it--what he did to my mom, to Ford, and how that son of a bitch tried to make you pay for it.",
        "Hannah: John said that he wasn't gonna say anything, I mean, not until he had all the evidence to-- does that mean-- is Eli in jail?",
        "Cole: Not yet. They're looking for him.",
        "Hannah: Oh, my God, Cole, you have to get out of here. If he's not in jail right now, you could be in serious danger. I'm not kidding.",
        "Cole: Okay. Forget about me. You're the one that he hurt, all right? He made you confess to things you didn't do. He made you take those pills. That's attempted murder, Hannah. He could've killed you. Look at me. Look. You should've told me.",
        "Hannah: I almost did. Then Eli found me, and that's when he held the gun on me and made me take the pills.",
        "Cole: How could he just stand there and watch you do it?",
        "Hannah: He told me that if I didn't take the pills, he'd kill someone else.",
        "Cole: Who?",
        "Hannah: Someone I cared about.",
        "Cole: No. Not me. Hannah, you were gonna kill yourself to save my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I wanted you to hear it from me. I mean, now is not the time, but her name came up, and it just felt wrong not to say anything. I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: No. You-- you have nothing to be sorry about. Hey, you're having a baby. Ha! Having a baby. That's good. I mean, who knows better than I how much you wanted that? Whew. Sorry. I'm just...surprised. I didn't know you and Natalie were planning a family so soon.",
        "[Marty clears throat]",
        "John: It wasn't planned.",
        "Marty: Well...",
        "Marty: [Clears throat] Natalie must be very happy--have you back and having your baby. It's okay because... I told you. I told you. It's like you two are meant for one another. It's just like I said.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Sorry to hustle you out, but you know the protocol. Authorized personnel only.",
        "Jessica: Right. I called the station. They said you'd be here.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Everything okay?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. It's fine. I just thought you'd be finished up, and I had my first O.B. appointment today, and I wanted to tell you about it, and from the sounds of things, you were thinking the same thing.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I was telling him about how the receptionist mixed up our charts and then thought that Brody was the father.",
        "Jessica: That was really confusing.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It was weird. Anyway, it's time to go, so if you want to ride with Jess, I'll just meet you back at the station.",
        "Brody: Thanks. Do you need any help with your stuff?",
        "Natalie: Nope. I'm good. Good night.",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Good night.",

        "Langston: Starr, before she comes out, I just want to let you know I'm backing off of James.",
        "Starr: No, Langston. You don't have to do that, not for me, anyway.",
        "Langston: I just don't want there to be any awkwardness between us, and if I still feel like pissing Ford off, I'll just find some other way.",
        "Dorian: [Sighs] Tsk. Well done, girls. Thank you.",
        "Starr: Are you feeling better?",
        "Dorian: [Sniffs] A bit, yes, but I'm gonna feel a lot better soon.",
        "Langston: Oh, no, no, no. What's up with the computer?",
        "Dorian: I just want to check my e-mails.",
        "Langston: Uh-uh.",
        "Starr: No way.",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "Langston: It's a known fact no one is allowed on MyFace within 24 hours of a breakup.",
        "Dorian: Who said anything about MyFace?",
        "Starr: No status updates. You are way too vulnerable right now.",
        "Dorian: I have to see what David is saying about me.",
        "Langston: No, you don't.",
        "Starr: It's just gonna make it worse.",
        "Langston: You just have to wipe David from your mind. You have to rip off the bandage, even if it hurts.",
        "Dorian: How?",
        "Langston: You leave that to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Clint, please don't go. I'm begging you. Listen to me. You get me out of here, I will not rest until I find Kim. I will hire a sherpa. I will climb the Himalayas. I swear to you, I will track her down.",
        "Clint: Forget Kimberly for the moment and tell me something. Do you truly think that I was gonna share Asa's fortune with you?",
        "David: What are you talking about? I'm a Buchanan.",
        "Clint: Did you think I was gonna let you and Dorian Lord, of all people, just ride off into the sunset with my family's money? You have a very short memory, don't you, Vickers?",
        "David: It's Buchanan. What are you talking about?",
        "Clint: Dorian stole my company and was the cause of the death of my son-in- law. Did that slip your mind?",
        "David: I wasn't thinking.",
        "Clint: No. No. You weren't, but luckily, I was, so I went straight to the Moroccan authorities and asked if they could give you your old cell back, and, by God, they were sure willing to do that.",
        "David: For how long?",
        "Clint: 20 years. 20. I like nice, round numbers, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Sorry I had to miss your appointment.",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, that's okay. It's not that exciting yet, although there was one question that I didn't know how to answer.",
        "Brody: What?",
        "Jessica: What's your Rh factor?",
        "Brody: Negative.",
        "Jessica: Wow, that was quick. Most people don't know them offhand.",
        "Brody: Well, soldiers do. It's right there on their tags. I should've realized. Of course.",
        "Brody: Does this-- does this have to do with Chloe?",
        "Jessica: I just don't want the same thing to happen to our baby.",
        "Brody: But you're Rh-negative, too, right, so we're cool.",
        "Jessica: I just wanted to be sure.",
        "Brody: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "John: Everything go okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I took some casts and hairs and fibers, but, I mean, nothing we weren't expecting.",
        "Marty: [Chuckles] Um, would you both just be really careful, both of you? Be careful with a new baby on the way. You'll have to excuse me. Just, you know, a lot going on. So I just really... want to congratulate you on your new family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: So what's your plan?",
        "James: My plan?",
        "Ford: Yeah. You can't just drift. You've got to do something with your life besides boosting cars and chasing girls.",
        "James: Oh, God, I'll figure something out.",
        "Ford: Hey, what happened to starting your own body shop?",
        "James: Oh, you're gonna front me the down payment?",
        "Ford: Hell no. I don't got that kind of money.",
        "James: Exactly.",
        "Ford: Actually, you should probably go to school first before you start your own business.",
        "James: Right, and what school is gonna take me?",
        "Ford: L.U. might once you pass the G.E.D.",
        "James: Wait. Langston goes to L.U., right?",
        "Ford: I thought she wasn't on your radar.",
        "James: She's not, but she's not the only girl in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I couldn't let anything happen to you. I loved you. Unfortunately in my case, being in love means being obsessed. Starr was right to warn you about me.",
        "Cole: Hey, don't say that.",
        "Hannah: Why should she trust me? I accused her dad of doing something I knew he didn't do, and I tried to get you to believe that she and James had sex. I was willing to do anything.",
        "Cole: Well, you didn't push my mom down those stairs.",
        "Hannah: No. I found other ways to hurt you. I'm sorry for lying and for making you doubt Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You ready?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Langston: Okay. David's MyFace page.",

        "David: You're having me locked up in here for 20 years? Clint, that is way worse than anything Asa ever thought of.",
        "Clint: I am my father's son. Get used to it.",
        "David: I'm my father's son, too. There's no way Bo is gonna let me rot in here.",
        "Clint: Well, what I'd like to know is, who's gonna tell Bo you're here?",
        "David: No one is gonna have to tell him. He'll have a sixth sense. He'll come looking for me.",
        "Clint: No. I don't know. After that botched wedding, Bo now knows what everybody else knows, that you're a loser and you take the easy way out every single time, and now all of this is on your MyFace page for all the world to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: He's changed his relationship status--\"single and loving it.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You hacked my MyFace?",
        "Clint: Oh, \"hacked,\" such an ugly word. No. I want you to picture something. Picture Dorian in front of her computer screen getting a load of all those updates, all your brand-new women.",
        "David: You swine. When I get out of here--",
        "Clint: And that's gonna be when? No. Wait, wait. Don't tell me. 2030. Well, I want you to make sure that when that distant date finally arrives, you stay the hell away from Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: There. He is unfriended.",
        "Dorian: Ohh...right. I want nothing more to do with that man. I don't want to see him or his profile again.",
        "Langston: You don't need him.",
        "Dorian: Right. All I want is peace, peace and seren...ity. Aah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Well, I got to run. Salam wa alaikum, David, and in case you forgot, that's Arabic for \"peace be upon you.\"",
        "David: Clint, I'm gonna kick your ass! That's Buchanan for \"I'm gonna kick your ass!\" I will get out of here, and I will get back to Dorian... as God is my witness.",

        "Brody: Hey, when is your next O.B. appointment?",
        "Jessica: Oh, not for a few weeks. Don't worry. I'll mark it on your calendar.",
        "Brody: Good, because I'm not missing that sonogram. I want to see our baby.",
        "Man: You wish you might have failed and left it all behind you got to take it easy on yourself you're searching for your strength and wishing on the stars you got to make it easy for yourself you're breaking apart at the seams and holding out for what you had before you lost it all you're falling apart, it seems and all you want is the one you had before you lost control you're holding out for love you're holding out for love keep holding out for love you're following all the strings that lead to better things you might be wrong at least you got to try to get you back the strength to nurse you back to health you might have lost but at least you know you tried you're breaking apart at the seams and holding out...",
