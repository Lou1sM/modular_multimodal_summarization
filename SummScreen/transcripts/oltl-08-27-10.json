        "Rex: 'Sup, Cris.",
        "Cristian: Hey, man.",
        "Rex: Haven't seen you in a while.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, this is the-- this is actually the first time I've been back to the gym since someone clocked me at my apartment.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and somebody stole Evangeline's file on Bennett Thompson.",
        "Cristian: You know about that?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I'm kind of working on the case.",
        "Cristian: With John?",
        "Rex: For a client.",
        "Cristian: So any idea who the thief was?",
        "Rex: Since the cops have an APB out, I might as well tell you. The first person who stole the file was a guy named Eli Clarke.",
        "Cristian: The lawyer?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: But wait a second. The first person?",
        "Rex: Well, the second person who stole the file--",
        "Kelly: Rex, I need your help.",
        "Rex: Was her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm expecting a call from the LAPD. Will you put it through as soon as it comes in?",
        "Layla: No problem.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Officer Price: So how are we doing on the search for Eli Clarke?",
        "John: I thought the doctor ordered you to take the day off.",
        "Officer Price: Look, man, I just need to come back to work and get this guy. Especially since I'm the one that let him get away.",
        "John: How are you feeling?",
        "Officer Price: I'm all right, man. Just a little bump on the head. I slept on it and I'm good. Now let me help you bring that bastard Clarke in.",
        "John: Eli and Blair, they took off from Llanview in a private plane and landed at an airfield somewhere outside Los Angeles. Where they went next is anybody's guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Greg: What is it, Eli?",
        "Eli: So did you solve our problem?",
        "Greg: It's not that simple.",
        "Eli: Look. No, it's very simple, Evans. Did you tell T\u00e9a she was right in not wanting her family anywhere near her to see her die?",
        "Greg: No.",
        "Eli: Why not?",
        "Greg: Because I told her that I called Todd and Dani and that they were on their way to the hospice. But that couldn't be further from the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: 5 hours over some stupid storm?",
        "Dani: At least we're on our way now.",
        "Todd: Barely.",
        "Dani: I just want to get there so I can spend as much time with Mom as possible.",
        "Todd: You and me both. It's really nice of the hulk back there to decide to tell us where she is, huh?",
        "Dani: I still don't understand what made you change your mind.",
        "Shaun: A voice told me it was what I had to do.",
        "Flight attendant: You're clear to use the in-flight service now.",
        "Dani: Thank you. I'll be right back.",
        "Shaun: Don't you think for a second that your threats had anything to do with me giving up T\u00e9a's location. For me, it's all about doing this for Dani so she can see her mom one last time.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, T\u00e9a needs to see her daughter, too. Her last memory shouldn't be of some cold, heartless doctor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: I hated lying to T\u00e9a.",
        "Eli: You're not gonna have to lie to T\u00e9a ever again.",
        "Greg: Yeah. I'm well aware of that.",
        "[Blair groans]",
        "Blair: Eli?",
        "Eli: This is going to work.",
        "Blair: What's gonna work?",
        "Eli: Blair. Good morning, beautiful.",
        "Blair: Good morning. Who were you talking to on the phone? The phone. Your phone. Your phone's working. My phone must be working. I'm gonna check with Dani and let everybody know what's going on, when I'm gonna get back to them.",
        "Eli: I'm afraid you can't do that.",
        "Blair: Why not?",
        "Eli: We still don't have a signal.",
        "Blair: No way. I just saw you out there. You were talking--",
        "Eli: I was talking to my phone. I said, \"this is gonna work,\" meaning the signal. I'm frustrated, too. I'm sorry. I know how much you want to get in touch with your family, and we are gonna go back to Llanview as soon as we get married. You'll see everyone soon enough.",
        "Blair: No, it's not soon enough, Eli. I really need to get back to Llanview now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: You've got that look.",
        "Todd: Hmm? What look?",
        "Shaun: The same look my parents give me when something goes wrong with me, Greg, or D. And they want to make it right. I get where you're coming from.",
        "Todd: Except I can't make it right with Dani.",
        "Shaun: This may not come out the smoothest...",
        "Todd: Best not to say it, then.",
        "Shaun: It's not like you're gonna do anything to me, not if you want me to tell you where Ms. Delgado is.",
        "Todd: You know, I liked you better when you were the strong, silent type.",
        "Shaun: A while ago, I asked Ms. Delgado why on earth is she wasting her time with you.",
        "Todd: I can see why you were gonna keep this to yourself.",
        "Shaun: You know what she told me?",
        "Todd: Let me guess--that I'm extremely handsome and wealthy and...I was great in bed?",
        "Shaun: No. She said you weren't all bad.",
        "Todd: Shows what she knows.",
        "Shaun: Seemed like she knew a lot. She said what you really are is scared-- afraid to show the world who you really are.",
        "Todd: See? She has no idea what she's talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Nate: Hello?",
        "Dani: Nate?",
        "Nate: Dani, where are-- where are you?",
        "Dani: Didn't you get my text?",
        "Nate: Yeah, it said you were going to see your mom, but how did you find her?",
        "Dani: Well, Destiny's brother changed his mind and decided to help.",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Dani: I know, right? It's awesome. I'm on my way to the Caribbean right now. I should see my mom really soon.",
        "Nate: That's great, Dani. I'm really glad for you. I know you weren't ready to say good-bye.",
        "Dani: Yeah, I'll never be ready, but I'm gonna be with her till the end, so there's a big part of me that's hoping I'll be gone a really, really long time.",
        "Nate: Well, however long it is, I'll be here when you get home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darren: Guess who?",
        "Destiny: Let's see. Can't be Darren, because he knows how much I hate people sneaking up on me and blocking my view.",
        "Darren: What was I thinking? How can I rob you of a chance at looking upon this gorgeous face?",
        "Destiny: Fool.",
        "Darren: For you.",
        "Destiny: I was looking at Nate.",
        "Darren: Nate?!",
        "Destiny: Not like that. Can't you see the boy is hurting?",
        "Darren: Oh. Yeah. Think it's about Dani?",
        "Destiny: I hope not. What a mess.",
        "Darren: Talk about a mess, should've seen my brother this morning. He had a icepack on his head. Said something went down at work.",
        "Destiny: Something like what?",
        "Darren: You know the person he was tailing? Turns out he got away.",
        "Destiny: By beating up your brother?",
        "Darren: I don't know. Maybe. Theo didn't want to talk about it. I just hope he doesn't think I blew his cover and tipped off the perp.",
        "Destiny: That's impossible. The only person who heard us talking was that lawyer-- Elijah Clarke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Okay, I'm having some trouble with the crime suspect of ours.",
        "Cristian: Bennett Thompson?",
        "Kelly: John told us not to talk to anyone about this, Rex.",
        "Cristian: Now I'm anyone?",
        "Kelly: No, of course not.",
        "Rex: It's not like he doesn't have anything to do with this.",
        "Cristian: Look, somebody broke into my apartment and knocked me out just to steal a file from this Thompson guy. I think I have a right to know what's going on. Rex said something about Eli Clarke?",
        "Rex: What happened was, we found out that Eli is--",
        "Kelly: ...Eli is Bennett Thompson, who was, I don't know, this--Pattison. Craig Pattison, okay, who killed people who got in his way, including my mother. Evangeline's file proved that Eli was Bennett, so I stole it back from him. Unfortunately, it was shredded, but Natalie reconstructed it. Then Robert Ford confirmed that Eli was Bennett, since Ford was having an affair with his wife and blackmailed him, okay? That's why Eli wanted to kill him, which meant John had Eli dead to rights. But now we don't know where he is and he have to find him so that he doesn't hurt Blair.",
        "Rex: Nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer Price: It's gotta be Mexico.",
        "John: You think?",
        "Officer Price: Yeah, it's gotta be. Look--Eli knows once he crosses the border, he's in the wind. He also knows that it's gonna be harder to find him, more or less bring him in from out there.",
        "John: I agree with you. Eli wants to be on foreign soil. But--",
        "Layla: Line 2. The call you've been waiting for.",
        "John: Thanks. McBain. No kidding. Okay. Thanks. Eli and Blair boarded a private plane at an L.A. airfield, and once again, they did not file a flight report.",
        "Officer Price: So we have no idea where they went?",
        "John: Not entirely. Eli asked for a plane with a fuel capacity to go 4,000 miles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Listen, I know it was a romantic idea to want to get married here in paradise, but I told everybody at home that I was gonna be home in a day or 2 at the most, Eli.",
        "Eli: I love how much of a mama bear you are with your brood.",
        "Blair: My brood?",
        "Eli: Your clan, your tribe, your pack. I don't mind saying, it's kind of hot.",
        "Blair: Mm. Well, you're kinda hot, too, but it doesn't change the fact that I need to get home.",
        "Eli: We will go home as soon as we do what we came here to do.",
        "Blair: Look, we came here because we did not want to share the spotlight with David and Dorian, right? Dorian and David are married by now. And I told my family that I was gonna come home and--and Dani--I'm worried about her. What if something were to happen to T\u00e9a?",
        "Eli: Ross is on his way. The conseiller municipal is gonna be here.",
        "Blair: Oh, you know what? Just leave him a note. We'll leave him a note. I'm sure you got something here in this legal-- jeez, I'm so sorry.",
        "Eli: Don't worry about it.",
        "Blair: You know what? I'm normally not such a klutz. It's just that, you know, I'm anxious about getting back home. I'm so sorry. Eli.",
        "Eli: Blair.",
        "Blair: Whose is this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I hope my mom won't be mad at me and Todd going against her wishes.",
        "Nate: I don't think she could be mad at you for this.",
        "Dani: You don't know my mom. When she tells me to do something and I don't do it...",
        "Nate: This isn't \"something,\" Dani. This is a big deal. You love your mom and you need to see her. Period. End of story.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but it's just... we won't have much time together. I know that. And I just want her to be happy to see me.",
        "Nate: Are you kidding me? You better have a ton of tissues, because the waterworks when your mom sees your face are gonna be intense.",
        "Dani: You think so?",
        "Nate: I know so. And when she finds out everything you did to be with her, she's gonna be so proud of you.",
        "Dani: Thank you. You don't know how bad I needed to hear that.",
        "Nate: Anytime.",
        "Dani: I'll call you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You look awful.",
        "Nate: Thanks.",
        "Destiny: The members don't like the help looking like death warmed over.",
        "Nate: It's good to know.",
        "Destiny: I'm serious. You still have time to find someone to cover for you.",
        "Nate: It's not me, okay? It's Dani.",
        "Destiny: We figured it might be.",
        "Nate: She went to go be with her mom when she dies.",
        "Darren: I thought she didn't know where her mom was.",
        "Nate: She didn't, but she just called me from the plane. Shaun is taking her and her dad there now.",
        "Destiny: Yes! I knew my brother would come through.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: It won't be long now.",
        "Flight attendant: Please fasten your seatbelts and prepare for landing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer Price: 4,000 miles?",
        "John: For a reference, I know that L.A. from Honolulu's about 2,500 miles.",
        "Officer Price: All right, so how do we plot 1,500 miles further than that?",
        "John: We? We don't do anything. You're going home.",
        "Officer Price: Come on, McBain, again?",
        "John: Listen, Price, you can disobey the doc all you want, all right, but this is regulation.",
        "Officer Price: When did John McBain start quoting regulations?",
        "John: We both know the department can't cover you if you don't do this by the book.",
        "Officer Price: Look, I just want to bring this guy in.",
        "John: Sooner you get better, sooner you get the all-clear.",
        "Officer Price: Yeah, all right.",
        "John: All right.",
        "Officer Price: But as soon as the doctor signs off, I'm coming back to take Clarke down.",
        "John: Absolutely.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: 4,000 miles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So Eli's missing?",
        "Kelly: Eli and Blair eloped last night.",
        "Cristian: John's gotta be looking for them.",
        "Kelly: He is.",
        "Cristian: Then he'll find them.",
        "Kelly: I hope you're right.",
        "Cristian: I am. Don't worry. Look, I gotta go, guys. Thanks for the update, huh? I'm glad my getting knocked out counted for something.",
        "Kelly: I'm glad you're feeling better.",
        "Cristian: Thanks.",
        "Rex: Later, Cris.",
        "Kelly: Whoo! Okay, it's hot in here.",
        "Rex: Well, it's a steam room. A men's steam room. But then, you do have a habit of coming in on me undressed.",
        "Kelly: Okay, Rex, we don't have time for you to be modest, okay?",
        "Rex: Who says I'm modest?",
        "Kelly: We need to find out where Eli took Blair.",
        "Rex: You heard Cris. John's on it. He wants us to stay out of it.",
        "Kelly: I know. I know. And John only has 2 hands, but those hands get tied up by red tape and I am desperate. Come on, I mean--Blair and I may not have had the nicest relationship, but the last thing I want is my cousin to end up as Eli's next victim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: That's Ross'.",
        "Blair: I know it's Ross', Eli, but what's he doing hiding it under a chair? Shouldn't he have put it someplace, maybe in a safe somewhere?",
        "Eli: I don't know. I guess because there's no kid living here now, he wants to keep it handy?",
        "Blair: Okay, this gun gives me the willies.",
        "Eli: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Blair: All right. We just need to get out of here. We'll leave--we'll leave Ross a message. We'll write him a note. We'll talk to him later, okay?",
        "Eli: I am just--it's killing me. I wanted--",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Eli: I wanted everything to be so magical for you. Nothing is happening the way I wanted it to. I wanted everything to be perfect.",
        "Blair: Eli, listen to me. You are perfect for me. And I'm gonna love you no matter where we say, \"I do,\" okay?",
        "Eli: Well, you're gonna have to, because it looks like paradise is off the menu.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Blair: Thank you for being so flexible. You've made this mama bear very grateful.",
        "Eli: You know what? I know how you can repay me.",
        "Blair: Well, I am gonna repay you for the rest of my life, but back in Llanview, okay? I can't wait for you to make an honest woman out of me.",
        "Ross: Well, well, well, what do we have here?",
        "Blair: Hello, Ross.",
        "Ross: Blair. Dude. Huh? I see you two got in all right.",
        "Blair: You knew that. You talked to Eli last night on the phone. Dude.",
        "Ross: Yeah, yeah, right. You know what? I'm a little fuzzy. Last night, you know, me and a couple boys went out after the dive. Come here, you. Good to see you.",
        "Blair: Don't even think about hugging me. Last time, you practically broke my rib when you shoved a gun right here when you were trying to take Dani. And do not try to recreate the episode. Got it?",
        "Ross: Yeah. Blair, I'm sorry about that. Really.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Ross: I am. Look, I was-- I was upset about Dani, you know, and--and--I couldn't think straight and I didn't want to lose my daughter.",
        "Blair: You mean Todd's daughter.",
        "Ross: You know...when I was told that Dani wasn't mine, it upset me. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. So how is she? How's--how's Dani? What? What is it? Is she okay?",
        "Eli: Dani is fine.",
        "Blair: It's--it's T\u00e9a. She's dying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Excuse me, what are you guys doing here?",
        "Todd: What does it look like? We're here to see T\u00e9a.",
        "Greg: Shaun, why would you bring them to the hospice? T\u00e9a's express wishes--",
        "Todd: Too late now. We're here, so just let us see her.",
        "Greg: I'm sorry, but that's not gonna be possible.",
        "Todd: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Here's the world map you asked for.",
        "John: Give me a hand?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: You know that.. that file that Evangeline had. That was instrumental in proving that Eli Clarke was really Bennett Thompson. I think she would've wanted to know that.",
        "Layla: She would have. Justice was important to her. It's...always what I wanted to get for her. You don't know how many times I've wished I could bring Tate Harmon back from the dead just so I could send him sailing off the roof one more time.",
        "John: It can eat you up, losing someone like that.",
        "Layla: Yeah, that's probably how Kelly feels right now.",
        "John: She won't have to any longer.",
        "Layla: Just make sure you get the bastard, John.",
        "John: I will.",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Layla: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Listen, I heard the cops are looking for Eli Clarke. That he's the Bennett Thompson Evangeline had a file on.",
        "Layla: It's true. He knocked you out and stole the file. But you're one of the lucky ones. He's killed people... including Evangeline.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Rex, do you want Blair's death to be on your conscience? Because if you don't help me--",
        "Rex: Fine! Okay? I will help you. McBain'll have my head, so will Bo, but you got me. I will help you find Blair and Eli. Maybe we should go somewhere else to talk.",
        "Kelly: Oh, no. We're gonna stay in here because John thinks I'm a blabbermouth. Okay? As long as we stay here, there's no chance that anyone will hear what we're saying.",
        "Rex: Suit yourself. All right, do you know any place that is significant to Blair? Enough where she'd want to get married there?",
        "Kelly: All of Blair's marriages have been here in Llanview.",
        "Rex: Okay, maybe she wanted to try something new. She's got resources to go anywhere. A chateau in France. A villa in Monaco. A hut in Timbuktu?",
        "Kelly: No. Blair--all she wanted was to finally walk down the aisle with Mr. Right.",
        "Rex: What about Eli? Has he ever mentioned a place special to him?",
        "Kelly: Not to me. The only other places I know that he has been is, what, Boston, where he probably killed that poor records clerk Glen, and California, where he most likely killed my mother.",
        "Rex: Probably wouldn't consider those honeymoon destinations.",
        "Kelly: Who knows? Before supposedly never-been-married Eli Clarke was Eli Clarke, even before he was Bennett Thompson, you know, he had a wife that died of suspicious circumstances.",
        "Rex: He did?",
        "Kelly: Mm-hmm. And then when he was Bennett Thompson, he had a wife that vanished off the face of the earth.",
        "Rex: So now he marries Blair...",
        "Kelly: Who knows nothing about wife number 1 or 2. She refuses to believe that Eli is dangerous. Blair has no idea that she is in way over her head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: A brain tumor. I...I can't believe it.",
        "Eli: Ross, I'm--I'm so sorry. I know how much you care about T\u00e9a.",
        "Ross: What's gonna happen to Dani now? What's gonna happen to her without a mother?",
        "Blair: She's living with her father--Todd--and he's taking good care of her. They had a rough start, but finally bonding.",
        "Ross: Last time I saw her, I sent Dani back to--to work on her relationship. I didn't know how important it'd be.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Well, another thing you might not know is that T\u00e9a has asked me to be Dani's legal guardian in case anything ever happened to Todd, and Eli actually helped me put it down on paper.",
        "Ross: Not exactly the best circumstances for a wedding, but we'll make the most of it.",
        "Blair: You know...T\u00e9a's condition has gotten worse, and I'm really worried about Dani and I wanna be there for her, so I'm gonna go back to Llanview. I'm gonna go back to Llanview now.",
        "Ross: No. Blair, I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, I can't go?",
        "Ross: Well, imagine my surprise when my brother calls me and tells me you're coming to Tahiti to get married when I didn't even know you were close.",
        "Eli: And I didn't even know you were still alive until recently, so I think we're even.",
        "Ross: I'm not upset, bro. Although I thought that, you know, we did have a--a spark, you know? I mean, you know, when I was trying to convince you to stay away from Todd. And I'm glad you finally did that. And I'm even happier that the man you're going to marry is my brother. Huh? Which is why you can't go. Uh-uh. Not until you do what you came here to do, which is become Mrs. Elijah Clarke. Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Okay, so just slow down for a bit. How could this Eli Clarke have killed Evangeline if we were both there when she died?",
        "Layla: Vange died because we took her off life support. My mother fought it. She wanted to keep my sister alive.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but we all agreed she wouldn't want to live that way.",
        "Layla: My mother only agreed after she called an attorney whose name she found in Vange's things. The attorney who drew up her living will.",
        "Cristian: Bennett Thompson.",
        "Layla: AKA, Eli Clarke.",
        "Cristian: So you don't think that will was real?",
        "Layla: It was never filed, remember? But Bennett told my mom it represented Vange's wishes, without a doubt. He wanted my sister dead so she wouldn't tell anyone she knew who he was.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but if that's true...",
        "Layla: What he did was worse than killing her, Cris. He made us do it for him.",

        "Kelly: You know what? If they wanted to get married quickly, they could have gone to Maryland.",
        "Rex: Uh, maybe. Yeah, but Eli's a serial killer who knows that we're on to him. He'd want to go further than that.",
        "Kelly: Maybe they went to Las Vegas, you know? I mean, originally, that's where they were going to get married.",
        "Rex: Yeah, and Eli knows that's the first place we'd look. Besides, it'd be too easy for Blair to call home and tell everybody where she is.",
        "Kelly: Okay! Then you know what? You think of something.",
        "Rex: Kelly, I--",
        "Kelly: You are a P.I. You're supposed to come up with ideas, instead of shooting all of mine down.",
        "Rex: Okay, yeah, but it's a lot easier when I have at least one clue to follow. Like when Blair hired me to find Eli's brother, Ross. I mean, I tracked that guy all the way to Tahiti.",
        "Kelly: Do you think that that's where Eli took her? I mean, that's where his brother lived.",
        "Rex: Well, yeah, but why would he? His brother's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: I have been trying to convince Blair to stay long enough for us to get married, but I understand how important it is to get back.",

        "Man: Good morning. The door was open.",
        "Eli: Oh, hey. You must be...",
        "Man: I am the conciliar municipal. Sorry I'm late. I got a bit lost coming up here. But I'm ready to perform the wedding if the couple is ready to get married.",
        "Eli: What do you say, Blair? He's here. Can we stay long enough to make this legal?",
        "Blair: Oh, Eli, we got the judge. You have your witness. The bride, groom. Okay, let's get married.",
        "Eli: You have made me the happiest man on earth.",
        "Blair: Let me just get into my pretty dress.",
        "Ross: Congratulations. You're really going to do it.",

        "Nate: Wait. So this Dr. Evans Dani's been talking about--that's your brother?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. He's a genius. We got it like that.",
        "Nate: Wait. What? He's this famous brain surgeon, you're stuck working here?",
        "Destiny: We don't take money from Greg.",
        "Nate: No, I didn't mean that, I just mean--I don't know--does your whole family have it like that?",
        "Destiny: No, Greg's the big success, our star. The rest of my family's pretty much blue collar.",
        "Darren: Complete opposite of my folks. They're all super white collar. Except for my brother, Theodore. You know, my mom actually cried when he said he wanted to be a cop.",
        "Nate: Whoa. What's wrong with being a cop?",
        "Darren: Nothing, I guess. I mean, if you don't mind being broke.",

        "Darren: I'm proud of my brother. You know, he followed his heart. Like I followed mine.",
        "Destiny: Keep talking.",
        "Darren: I just prefer the country club life, you know? Valet, concierge, V.I.P. All the way, baby. That's how I want to live. Make a ton of money, keep my lady in style.",
        "Destiny: What lady are you talking about?",
        "Darren: The woman in my heart--you.",
        "Destiny: I've got news for you. I don't need to be kept or spoiled or anything that players think girls want.",
        "Darren: If I'm a player, then you're my violin.",
        "Destiny: You need to quit while you're not even close.",
        "Nate: So, what? You want to work here for the rest of your life?",
        "Destiny: Who said I want to work here for the rest of my life?",
        "Nate: No, I just mean, you know...",
        "Destiny: Look, I don't know about you, but I plan on being successful in my own right. Just like my two brothers.",
        "Nate: Well, you're way ahead of me. I've got two brothers I don't even know, and country club life is not even on my radar. Not when I have no clue where my mom and I are going to be living next week.",
        "Darren: That's a bummer.",
        "Nate: Yeah, well, it's nothing compared to what Dani is going through.",

        "Greg: Look, you don't understand...",
        "Todd: No, no, no. Evans, you don't understand. You can't keep me from seeing T\u00e9a.",

        "Todd: Period. What room is she in?",
        "Shaun: This one.",

        "Cristian: Look, if--if Eli has done half the things John says he's done, then --then you're probably right. He probably did manipulate the situation. But Eli didn't put Evangeline in that coma. Look, I believe with all my heart that, you know, we were honoring what Evangeline would have wanted.",
        "Layla: I know she wouldn't have wanted to live that way. It just kills me that she's gone, Cris.",

        "Kelly: Do you think that maybe there was an inheritance of some sort that Eli was going to?",
        "Rex: Well, anything's possible. And if Eli wanted to get Blair as far from Llanview as he could, Tahiti pretty much fits the bill.",
        "Kelly: It's a good theory, but I think you're going to have to dig it up.",
        "Rex: What I'm going to do is tell this to John McBain.",

        "Destiny: You're not so bad. I mean, you've really been there for Dani through all this.",
