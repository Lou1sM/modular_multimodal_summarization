        "Cristian: Ok, so we're out of Petit Marnier, Grenadine, and Margarita mix -- oh, and we're almost out of fresh lime.",
        "Eve: Ok.",
        "Cristian: Thanks.",
        "Sarah: Ahem. Could a girl get a little service here?",
        "Cristian: Your money is no good here. Oh, sorry, I forgot -- you don't have any.",
        "Sarah: Only a matter of time.",
        "Cristian: Really? So, what, did you get religion, come around to the Buchanan way of doing things?",
        "Sarah: Nope. I'm about to bag myself a job.",
        "Cristian: Who's got the cojones to hire you?",
        "Sarah: You do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: We could take Comm. Science together.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Starr: Ooh -- we could join band.",
        "Cole: Band?",
        "Starr: You don't want to be a band geek? No?",
        "Cole: No.",
        "[Starr giggles]",
        "Cole: Or you could -- could skip a grade.",
        "Starr: Ok, I know I'm smart and everything, but we would probably have better luck being in the same gym class together, but that wouldn't really be fair to you, because I would just cream you in football, and beat you in everything else -- just completely ruin you.",
        "[Cole chuckles]",
        "Cole: Oh, yeah?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Bring it on, big shot.",
        "Starr: Ok, what's wrong with you?",
        "Cole: I don't know. It -- just feels weird being happy.",
        "Starr: Everything's going to be ok. Your mom wouldn't call and say that it's going to be better if it wasn't. Your mom's going to be released from jail. It's just a matter of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: When can we see Lindsay?",
        "Nora: Marcie, she's still being questioned.",
        "Marcie: By John, Nora.",
        "Michael: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: What? The man has arrested half of Llanview for killing Spencer Truman.",
        "Nora: Ok, Marcie --",
        "Marcie: Does anybody else -- does anybody else here have a problem with the fact that he has hijacked this department for his own personal grudge fest?",
        "Michael: Nora, listen, I am really sorry, but you have to understand --",
        "Marcie: No, no, Michael, do not -- please, ok? Don't stand here and apologize for me. John went after you, he went after his own brother, and when that didn't work out, he came after me. And now he's going after Lindsay.",
        "Nora: Marcie, if -- if you don't calm down, you're going to have to leave the building.",
        "Marcie: I'm not leaving. I am not leaving without the best woman that I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: The secret you killed for has come out anyway. I know Tommy is really Todd Manning's son. You can't protect him anymore. So why don't you just tell me everything? How long have you known Tommy is Manning's son?",
        "Lindsay: I never said anything of the kind.",
        "John: You didn't deny it, either. Just say it. You know Tommy is Todd Manning's son.",
        "Lindsay: And you don't want that coming out any more than I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I'm glad I found you. I have something to tell you, something terribly important. I know you hate my guts, and you have every right to, and you probably think I'm crying wolf about this, but I'm not. I know where your son is -- for real this time.",
        "Miles: I'm telling you the truth --",
        "Todd: Shut up, Miles.",
        "Miles: But, Todd, I need --",
        "Todd: You mention my son again, one more word --",
        "Miles: Look, what I have to say is --",
        "Todd: One more word, Miles!",
        "Miles: What I have to say -- is no joke.",
        "Todd: I'm not laughing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Does Lindsay even have a lawyer in there with her?",
        "Nora: Lindsay is very aware of her rights.",
        "Marcie: So, in other words, that would be a no?",
        "Michael: Marcie, honey, you really have to calm down.",
        "Marcie: Calm down? You want me to calm down?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Michael, the only woman who has ever been a mother to me was just publicly humiliated and arrested for a murder that she didn't commit, but you want me to calm down?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Look, I'll -- I'll call you as soon as we have something to report. Goodbye.",
        "Rex: This is no good, Bo.",
        "Bo: Yeah, you can say that again.",
        "Rex: I mean, what the hell? Lindsay killed Spencer? They barely knew each other.",
        "Bo: Balsom, you know that this is an ongoing --",
        "Rex: Ongoing investigation. Yeah, I know. You can't talk about it -- yada, yada. Pardon my French, it's a bunch of crap. I'm sorry, but this is Lindsay we're talking about. I care about her, and I know you do, too. You can't believe she killed Spencer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I understand, Marcie. You and Lindsay were very close.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I understand, too, Nora. I understand that you hate Lindsay's guts.",
        "Michael: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: Fine. Look, Lindsay and I -- we've been there for each other, you know, through some of the worst things you can imagine. I am not about to turn my back on her right now.",
        "Nora: You know what, Marcie? I think that's wonderful, I really do. But you've got to respect the roomful of men and women in here who are trying to do their job.",
        "Marcie: And what is that job, Nora -- railroading people?",
        "Nora: Ok, you're close, Marcie, you're really close.",
        "Michael: Marcie, honey --",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry. Am I making a scene? I don't care. I will stop when someone stops John and they set Lindsay free.",
        "Nora: Ok, Lindsay right now is a suspect in a murder investigation. She is going to be questioned, and then very possibly charged, and then -- and only then -- will she be up for bail consideration. It doesn't matter how you feel about your friend. But you cannot impeach John's ability to do his job. And if -- if John likes Lindsay for this, then I do, too.",
        "Marcie: Oh, come on! Nora, this -- this whole thing -- I -- I swear to you, this has nothing to do with John liking Lindsay for anything, ok? This has to do with him liking Marty Saybrooke.",

        "[Door opens]",
        "Marty: Um, excuse me?",
        "Guard: Dr. Saybrooke, is everything all right?",
        "Marty: Actually, yeah, it's -- it's great, but, um, I was just wondering, is John McBain in the building?",
        "Guard: Probably, considering all hell just broke loose.",
        "Marty: At the woman-of-the-year awards?",
        "Guard: How did you know?",
        "Marty: Lucky guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: How did you get so good at making me feel better?",
        "Starr: Maybe it's in my genes or chromosomes or something.",
        "Cole: In your jeans, huh?",
        "Starr: Hey!",
        "Cole: What? You're the one who said it.",
        "Starr: You're the one who can't keep your head above waist level.",
        "Cole: Oh, come on, that's not true. You know I love everything about you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Starr: Ahem. Hi, Aunt Dorian, we weren't expecting you home so early.",
        "Dorian: Please, do not even try to pretend you two have been doing homework.",
        "Starr: We were actually trying to coordinate our courses for the fall.",
        "Dorian: Oh, right, right. What's there to coordinate? You're a sophomore, and aren't you going to be a junior?",
        "Starr: How were the awards?",
        "Dorian: Well, they went well. Um -- I was, of course, passed over once again, but, all in all, I can say it was all to the good.",
        "Starr: Was there a scandal as usual?",
        "Dorian: Sometimes, Starr, I think you're wise beyond your years.",
        "Starr: So? Come on.",
        "Dorian: The 2007 Woman of the Year had a meltdown while making her speech. Then a few other things happened. Then she was handcuffed and taken to jail -- accused of having killed Spencer Truman. Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Don't tell me what I want.",
        "Lindsay: Then talk to me. Talk to me like -- like you're Michael's brother, Tommy's uncle.",
        "John: He's right here. So is the cop.",
        "Lindsay: I don't need the cop!",
        "John: Look, I took an oath. I can't just check my badge at the door because family's involved.",
        "Lindsay: Yes, you can. It's called compassion.",
        "John: Hmm. But in this line of work, a murder is still a murder.",
        "Lindsay: You can't hide behind your line of work.",
        "John: You --",
        "Lindsay: No, there is too much at stake on this one here.",
        "John: You want to talk about hiding? I mean, you really want to talk about hiding? Right now there's a woman down in a holding cell who hasn't been able to see her son for weeks because of a crime she didn't commit.",
        "Lindsay: Marty never would've been convicted.",
        "John: Oh, yeah? Does that justify the hell you're putting her through?",
        "Lindsay: I'm sorry she's had a rough couple of nights, but hell? No, hell is when a parent has a child ripped from their lives. Spencer Truman set Michael and Marcie up to feel that kind of pain. He put them in the line of fire, and you're the one that's about to pull the trigger.",
        "John: You're talking in circles here. The bottom line is my brother's adopted son is still Todd Manning's kid.",
        "Lindsay: You feel better now? You want to shout it from the rooftops?",
        "John: No, I don't. It sucks. So how long have you known?",
        "Lindsay: John, if this gets out, it's going to destroy Michael and Marcie.",
        "John: For argument's sake, what about Manning?",
        "Lindsay: He never needs to know.",
        "John: You really think it's up to you to play God?",
        "Lindsay: No. Do you think it's up to you?",
        "John: All right, let's forget about God. I just want to know the truth from the beginning.",
        "Lindsay: But you already know the truth, and here we are, going round and round. Clearly, you've known about Tommy, and what I want to know is, why haven't you done something about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You're angling for a job here -- again?",
        "Sarah: You're never going to get my half of the cable bill until I start earning.",
        "Cristian: \"Earn\"? You?",
        "Sarah: Look, I know my way around a bat from little league, so whose legs do I got to break?",
        "Cristian: So you're ready to punch the clock?",
        "Sarah: Could you dial down the attitude a little? Not only did Antonio tell me I could have a job --",
        "Cristian: \"Maybe.\" Antonio said \"maybe.\"",
        "Sarah: But I did try to get hired here once before, remember? You shot me down?",
        "Cristian: The way I remember it, you waltzed in here like you were God's gift to club land.",
        "Sarah: Well, can I help it if I'm young, talented, and in your face?",
        "Cristian: The in-your-face part? Yeah.",
        "Sarah: Strong women scare you, huh?",
        "Cristian: I've been with strong women. You -- you're just in training. And as far as working here, you know, Antonio also said that I run this place, and I don't think we need a booker.",
        "Sarah: Give me your cell and 10 minutes, and I will have block party here for Labor Day.",
        "Cristian: You know, you fed me that exact same line weeks ago. What did I say then -- no. What do you think I'm going to say now -- no. That's not the way we do things. You know, there's a process -- research, marketing, analyzing our clientele.",
        "Sarah: I could do that.",
        "Cristian: I'm sure you could -- after you work your way up from the bottom.",
        "Sarah: God, give me a break.",
        "Cristian: You know, before he was Mr. Sean John, multimillion-dollar mogul P. Diddy ran errands for --",
        "Sarah: Andre Harrell from uptown records, bringing him pie -- I know. Why does everybody tell that story?",
        "Cristian: Because it shows you there's no shortcut into this business.",
        "Sarah: Oh, right, because you started off here waiting tables.",
        "Cristian: I've done it.",
        "Sarah: Well, I am a creative person.",
        "Cristian: So am I. But I'm here anyway, doing what I have to do to get by.",
        "Sarah: Yeah. Well, I guess that's why I'm here, too. You know what my goals are long-term, but today I'm willing to start as -- a server. Ahem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: John would never allow his personal life to enter into a case.",
        "Marcie: John's personal life \"is\" the Spencer Truman case, Nora.",
        "Nora: All right, let me rephrase that. John would never allow his personal life to interfere with his ability to do his job.",
        "Michael: She's got a point.",
        "Marcie: Michael! Come on. We both know -- we all know that John has this kind of a -- this thing for Marty. Look, the woman confessed to killing Spencer Truman, your department was building a case against her -- am I right?",
        "Nora: Yes, we were.",
        "Marcie: Well, then doesn't it strike you odd, Nora, even if it's not illegal, that John pursued another suspect without anybody else here knowing, long after the L.P.D. closed the case?",
        "Nora: Ok, I can't stand here and debate the legalities --",
        "Marcie: Well, then stand here and debate it with a lawyer, ok? Because I have one coming for Lindsay, and he is not some cheap, public defender.",
        "Nora: Are you going to allow me to finish what I was going to say? I can't stand here and date legalities with you when I don't know exactly what is going on, which is why I was on my way downstairs to find out. Until then, no one -- not Lindsay, Marty, and, apparently, not you -- is going home. So, if you will excuse me, ok?",
        "Marcie: Fine.",
        "Nora: Marcie? I really admire your commitment to Lindsay, and she really has done some wonderful things lately. But that doesn't negate her past. She is a convicted felon. She has attempted murder and murder on her rap sheet. Just -- just bear that in mind when you're going to bat for her, please? Ok. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Until Lindsay starts talking, my hands are tied.",
        "Rex: How about getting a leash for John?",
        "Bo: Hey, I don't get in my chief detective's way when he's doing his job.",
        "Rex: Is this the job you had in mind? He's about to charge a third separate subject for the same murder, and this one didn't even --",
        "Bo: We don't know what \"this one\" did or didn't do.",
        "Rex: Bo, you can't think that Lindsay -- what?",
        "Bo: You know something? You've been involved in this case since day one. You're into it right up to your ears -- you and Michael both. So is at what you're trying to hide -- Lindsay's involvement?",
        "Rex: No way -- I didn't even know she was -- I don't think she is.",
        "Bo: But you know something that relates to Spencer Truman's homicide, and you've been sitting on it. I've been looking the other way, Balsom, because you're a good kid, and because we already had a suspect for that murder, we thought we had the person. That's all up in smoke right now. You want me to do everything I can to help our friend? I'm doing it. You know what you have to do? You have to step up, and you have to tell me what you've been hiding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, we can go back and forth on this all day. You're still on deck for a capital murder.",
        "Lindsay: You don't know what you're going to do, do you?",
        "John: So when did you find out Tommy was Manning's son?",
        "Lindsay: I'm right, aren't I?",
        "John: Does Marcie know?",
        "Lindsay: Marcie doesn't know anything. She thinks the boy she raised since he was practically born is going to be her son for the rest of her life.",
        "John: Was Truman going to tell Manning about Tommy?",
        "Lindsay: Do you know that she's already been looking into preschools?",
        "John: Is that why you killed him?",
        "Lindsay: Do you know that she thinks that her son is going to grow up, get married, have children, and make her a grandmother?",
        "John: You can make this easier on yourself if you just confess.",
        "Lindsay: You already know the truth -- isn't that what you said?",
        "John: I need the timeline, from when you found out who Tommy really was.",
        "Lindsay: Well, isn't that funny, because I'd kind of like to know the same thing. Because, clearly, you've known about this long enough to pick up the phone and call Todd, but you couldn't. Tommy's family, and you're going to leave that little boy right where he is. When it comes to powerful congestion relief,",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Tell me something good.",
        "Nora: A lot's happening, we have a new suspect that's being interrogated, and you could be going home soon.",
        "Marty: And this isn't some kind of late April Fool's Day joke?",
        "Nora: It's not a done deal, there's a lot of things still in motion, but I think you're going to be free soon.",
        "Marty: Do I know the suspect?",
        "Nora: Yeah -- Lindsay Rappaport. Can you believe it? I mean, I -- I'm still sort of gathering and catching up with all the evidence -- John arrested her about an hour ago -- but it, um -- you know, this is where you're supposed to turn around and say, \"Lindsay Rappaport -- wow, that's impossible.\"",
        "Marty: Oh, it's possible, all right.",
        "Nora: Ok. I think you need to tell me what you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, back up, back up. Someone else was arrested for murdering Spencer?",
        "Dorian: Not just \"someone else\" -- a very good friend of mine, Lindsay Rappaport -- and, I mean the indignity of it. I mean, the woman was carted away in the middle of an important ceremony in front of everyone. Media -- I -- oh, God -- I think of the photographs --",
        "Starr: Ahem -- Aunt Dorian?",
        "Cole: Ok, what about my mom?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Um -- I don't think she was even mentioned. The primary focus was Lindsay.",
        "Cole: Ok, so that means she's going to be set free, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah, it has to.",
        "Dorian: No, I don't think that's necessarily the case.",
        "Starr: Can two people be charged for the same crime?",
        "Dorian: Well, unfortunately, I think that's what's happening right now.",
        "Cole: Ok, I'm going to call John.",
        "Dorian: Why bother? I mean, right now John is probably interrogating his new pet, you know --",
        "[Dorian laughs]",
        "Dorian: Suspect. Come on. How the man keeps his job, I have no idea.",
        "Cole: See? My mom is innocent, all right? He knew it, and I knew it, and he said he was going to do everything to fix it, and he did.",
        "Starr: Oh, Cole!",
        "Cole: You were right, my mom's coming home. Lindsay I'm right, aren't I? Why haven't you gone with the truth to Marcie or Todd? Why didn't you call child services? Why else would Tommy still be with Marcie and Michael?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: This is only going to make things harder on Tommy in the end.",
        "Lindsay: All you've got is a pocketful of speculation. You can't prove anything, and I'm not talking.",
        "John: I don't need you to talk to make a case. The truth will come out, it always does. In the meantime, Michael and Marcie are going to know why you did this. They won't be able to move past it, unless they know what happened.",
        "Lindsay: \"They're not going to be able to move past it\"? Are you kidding me? You take away the only child they'll ever have, they're not going to be able to move on!",
        "John: You know what I think? I think you've been carrying this around for months. I think it's eating you up -- I've seen in your eyes, I can see it right now.",
        "Lindsay: And telling you is going to ease my pain, is that it?",
        "John: I'll make sure this comes out right, I promise. But to do that, I need to have the facts -- from the time you learned who Tommy really is.",
        "Lindsay: Doesn't matter, because I'm going to take that secret to my grave with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Ugh! Please --",
        "Todd: How much did he give you, Miles?",
        "Miles: You have to listen to me!",
        "Todd: How much did he give you, Miles?",
        "Miles: I don't know what you're talking about!",
        "Todd: Spencer -- how much did he give you to torture me?",
        "Miles: I'm not trying to torture you!",
        "Blair: Stop it -- just shut up! Please, Todd --",
        "Miles: Listen, he \"did\" give it to me, he gave me something, he gave me -- he gave me a key to a locker.",
        "Blair: Just give me the knife, Todd, please. Let's go home -- give me the knife. Let's go home to your family. Come on, Todd. Come on. Just go. Come on. It's not worth it. Come on, Todd.",
        "Miles: If you walk out that door, you're walking out on your son. He's alive, and he's here in Llanview.",

        "Cristian: You want to wait tables?",
        "Sarah: It pays, right?",
        "Cristian: Barely. You got to work your tail off.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, but health benefits?",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Sarah: Fringe benefits?",
        "Cristian: Free grub -- not booze.",
        "Sarah: Vertical opportunities?",

        "Starr: None of that matters right now, aunt Dorian. His mom could be free.",

        "Lindsay: Yes. Because if the truth comes out, it will destroy them. So I'm begging you, John, not to let this out. I'm not going to say anything. So if you're going to destroy that family by telling them, then you're going to do that all by yourself.",
