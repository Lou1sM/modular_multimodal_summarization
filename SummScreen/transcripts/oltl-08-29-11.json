        "When John releases Irene from jail, she calls current Todd to tell him that she can \"help\" him knowing he will depend on her for help as it's only a matter of time before all the people in his life realize he's an imposter and forget all about him while original Todd reunites with them. And she knows she can motivate him to keep her out of jail. But current Todd does not want to cooperate with her nor see her as his mother. Brody is at the station observing Todd's animosity and reminds Todd that they have a \"deal\" where it would not be in Todd's best interest to tell John that he and not Brody is Liam's father knowing what Brody knows about Todd's secrets. Natalie and Jessica both affirm that they do not care for nor respect each other and don't want to reconcile although Clint tells his two daughters he'd like them to reconsider instead of behaving as he did with his brother, Bo. Kimberly is still on the prowl in Llanview, with a \"motive\" to reconnect with Clint. And she reveals to Shaun when she sees him outside of Buenos Dias, that Stacy may be alive."

        "Clint: I want to give Kimberly the benefit of the doubt, but with her, nothing is ever simple.",
        "Natalie: What do you think she wants?",
        "Clint: I don't know. If she has an ulterior motive, for being here--",
        "Natalie: If?",
        "Clint: If she has an ulterior motive, I have no idea what it is.",
        "Natalie: Well, with Kim, it could be anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: So you have fifth period lunch.",
        "Dani: No. Sixth.",
        "Destiny: Damn, but on my way to French, we can meet by the lockers unless you have to go to the Science Hall. Are you taking Bio? Hello? Dani?",
        "Dani: Hmm? What?",
        "Destiny: What is with you?",
        "Dani: Nothing. No. I'm not taking Bio.",
        "Destiny: Obviously, Bio was not on your mind. What are you thinking about?",
        "Dani: My two dads.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What you got there?",
        "Jack: Oh, Mom, it's nothing. Mom!",
        "Blair: What is this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: If you won't give up, I won't give up, either.",
        "T\u00e9a: This man is your brother. Don't forget that. You really want to go to war with him?",
        "Victor: Bring it on.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ach, this is not the time to overreact, ok?",
        "Victor: He'd like to take my company. He'd like my life, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Which, technically, were both his before Irene took them away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Have a seat. Don't get too comfortable. Feds are on their way.",
        "Irene: Sounds scary. What's a helpless woman like me to do?",
        "John: You ain't helpless, lady.",
        "Irene: Terrifying, your powers of observation. If you don't mind, Lieutenant, I'll take my phone call now. It's time for me to arrange my release.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: This is your idea of help, telling me things I already know?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. He has no money or assets. Todd can't take anything from you. He doesn't even have a legally recognized identity.",
        "Victor: You think that'll stop him? If he can't use the law to steal what he wants from me, he'll find some other way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey, Uncle Todd.",
        "Todd: Hey, Niece Jessica.",
        "Jessica: What are you up to? No good, I'm sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So how's my girl doing today. I know her condition hasn't changed. Her condition never changes. Listen, Ratched. I'll be back before you know it, so you better not be skimping on the TLC. What? Yeah. I saw the bill. How can you miss it with all those zeros? But don't worry. I'll take care of it. I told you, I'll take care of it. Ugh. Hey! Watch where you're going.",
        "Shaun: Excuse me. You bumped into-- Kimberly Andrews? What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: So then Starr and I got into this huge fight.",
        "Destiny: About your dads.",
        "Dani: Yeah, but it's all good now. We worked everything out.",
        "Destiny: But?",
        "Dani: Starr thought I was being loyal to Victor over Todd.",
        "Destiny: Well, doesn't that make sense? I mean, you've known him longer.",
        "Dani: Yeah, and this new guy, I barely even know him.",
        "Destiny: So you'll get to know him.",
        "Dani: Yeah, except where does that leave Victor?",
        "Destiny: You're worried.",
        "Dani: Neither of them know where they stand right now, and then Starr said this thing. Never mind.",
        "Destiny: No. Tell me. What is it? What'd she say?",
        "Dani: She said that they can get dangerous when they feel cornered.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I got to admit, I'm disappointed.",
        "Irene: Pray tell, in what?",
        "John: Well, Baker made you sound like a proper villain, and yet here you are asking for your phone call like a common crook. Who you gonna call, Irene? Your goofy, little organization has been shut down. I don't know if there's anyone left to help you.",
        "Irene: My phone call, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: This guy is not gonna take me down. I'm gonna take him down first, and you can get the ball rolling with a restraining order. I don't want him anywhere near here or my family.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ok. Ok. Timeout. Before you ask me to spark a war that will, no doubt, spiral out of control, why not do something truly unexpected?",
        "Victor: Yeah. Throw him down a mineshaft?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. No. I was thinking more along the lines of getting to know him.",
        "Victor: Ha! Are you serious?",
        "T\u00e9a: You two are brothers. You have more in common than either of you are willing to admit.",
        "Victor: No. We have the same DNA. That's all I need to know. He's gonna do exactly what I would do. That's how our mommy made us.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Victor: Excuse me a second.",
        "[Ring]",
        "Victor: This is Todd.",
        "Irene: Hello, Junior. It's your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So what is this, Jack?",
        "Jack: None of your business.",
        "Blair: Ok. Well, it might not be any of my business, but since I already saw it, why don't we talk about it?",
        "Jack: It's not a big deal, ok?",
        "Blair: Well, then fessing up won't be a big deal, either. Why don't you tell me about this Gigi Morasco Scholarship Fund and why you're carrying around a letter asking for donations for it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So how are you adjusting to life at Llanfair?",
        "Todd: It could be worse. You're here, and Viki keeps the fridge fully stocked, and... I could do without the wheelie dude in there giving me the evil eye every 3 seconds, but--",
        "Jessica: Be nice. Come on.",
        "Todd: Tell that to him. You know what? He's the one under house arrest, so maybe I should--",
        "Jessica: My father is a pussycat.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'd really like to go get some air.",
        "Jessica: Well, come on. We've barely had a chance to talk. Don't worry. I'll protect you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: What do you want?",
        "Irene: To see my boy. I need help.",
        "Victor: Ask the other one.",
        "Irene: I'm waiting for you at the police station, Victor.",
        "Victor: Don't hold your breath. Better yet, do.",
        "Irene: I'll expect you in 10 minutes. Don't be late.",
        "Victor: I'm not coming.",
        "Irene: Yes, you are because after you help me, I will help you.",
        "Victor: What would I want from you?",
        "Irene: Just trust me. I know what's good for you, Victor. I'm your mother.",
        "T\u00e9a: Irene?",
        "Victor: Yeah. She wants to see me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Like that's gonna happen. You're not gonna go over there, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know, I'd love to stay here and shoot the breeze with you, but--",
        "Jessica: Well, stay and shoot the breeze.",
        "Todd: Jess, there's someplace I got to be.",
        "Jessica: What, now?",
        "Todd: Yep, yep. You don't have to wait up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't know what Kim's agenda is, Dad, but you're on it. Clearly, she wants another shot at you.",
        "Clint: Would that be so awful?",
        "Natalie: I thought you hated gold diggers, or have you and Rex kissed and made up?",
        "Clint: Well, thanks to Rex, there's no longer any gold to dig.",
        "Natalie: You know, Dad, that's what makes Kim's sudden appearance here even more suspicious, but you know what? Luckily, you can't go out and play, because you're under house arrest and recovering from a heart transplant.",
        "Clint: Means I have a lot of time on my hands.",
        "Natalie: To focus on recovery. Why don't we leave romance in the future, like far, far in the future?",
        "Clint: Kim is a friend, and she's not going anywhere.",
        "Natalie: Fine. Then maybe I should leave, because there is no way I'm sticking around if I have to deal with that bitch on a daily basis.",
        "Jessica: Finally. This bitch thinks that it's about time. You can pack your knives and leave, and we'll all be better off for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's not a big deal, ok, just something I thought about doing.",
        "Blair: Establishing a scholarship in Gigi's name? That was your idea?",
        "Jack: I heard that Gigi was in college when she, you know, so I figured I'd do something to honor her in her name, and... it'll also get Dad a tax break. I talked to some people at the \"Sun\" who said they handle charity stuff, and they said they'd help me set it up.",
        "Blair: Ok. Well, you know, you could've named it after anyone. Why'd you pick Gigi?",
        "Jack: I just told you.",
        "Blair: I know that you did, but actually, I think there's more to it than that, right? You know, we've been avoiding talking about what you did, but maybe now is-- come on. Come on. Maybe now is the time that we do it.",
        "Jack: What is there to talk about?",
        "Blair: Maybe how you feel. I know you put up this tough front, like some people we know, but I know deep down, you have a very big heart, Jack, a heart that makes you look after your little brother and take care of your sisters, a heart that feels bad when you do something, do something really bad. I know that you feel awful about what happened to Gigi. I know that you do, and I know that you feel that you probably can't talk to anybody about it, right? Hmm? Sweetie, you can talk to me about anything. I promise you, I'll always listen to you. So come on. Tell me what's going on here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Hey, I can go wherever I want. It's a free country, isn't it?",
        "Shaun: Last time I checked.",
        "Kim: Then leave me the hell alone. I'm already having a bad night.",
        "Shaun: Yeah? What happened?",
        "Kim: None of your business, you big oaf.",
        "Shaun: Nice. Just as charming as your friend Stacy Morasco.",
        "Kim: Oh, you got something to say about Stacy?",
        "Shaun: Just that she bumped into me, too, and didn't say that she was sorry, either.",
        "Kim: She was pregnant. It's not like she did it on purpose.",
        "Shaun: So that means that she can forget her manners, not that she had any to begin with.",
        "Kim: Just shut up, ok? Stacy Morasco is the best person I know.",
        "Shaun: Don't you mean \"was\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You love Victor, right?",
        "Dani: Definitely.",
        "Destiny: And you want to get to know Todd.",
        "Dani: Yeah. I do.",
        "Destiny: So? It seems to me like you know where you stand, and besides, it's not like you're in this alone. Your whole family is in the same boat.",
        "Dani: Yeah, the Titanic.",
        "Destiny: Oh, come on. Is it that bad?",
        "Dani: It's just weird.",
        "Destiny: That's an understatement.",
        "Dani: It's got to be the weirdest for my mom. When she married Victor, she was promising that she would spend her whole life with a totally different guy.",
        "Destiny: But she's cool with that, right?",
        "Dani: Yeah. She still loves him, but I don't know if Victor believes that. I told you, when he found out the truth, he pretended like he was really Todd.",
        "Destiny: But he just panicked, right?",
        "Dani: Yeah, but what if he's still scared?",
        "Destiny: Of what?",
        "Dani: That he's gonna lose us because he's not Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: [Gasps] Todd? Bo told you to stay away from here.",
        "Todd: Where's Victor?",
        "T\u00e9a: He's gone.",
        "Todd: Where'd he go?",
        "T\u00e9a: Irene. He went to speak to Irene.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What are you doing here? What do you want?",
        "Irene: A good son respects his mother's wishes, and you always were my favorite. Tag, you're it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Natalie, you keep on threatening to leave, but you just don't go. So if I'm so difficult to live with, why don't you go somewhere else?",
        "Natalie: It's interesting that when I say, \"bitch,\" you automatically assume I'm talking about you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, you weren't?",
        "Natalie: Not this time...",
        "Clint: Natalie--",
        "Natalie: But you know what? Not everything is about you, Jess.",
        "Jessica: So if you weren't talking about me, then--",
        "Natalie: Kim Andrews, but you know what? If it's too hard for you to live in this house knowing that I'm not spending every waking moment trying to figure out how to hurt you...",
        "Clint: Natalie--",
        "Natalie: Then by all means, you can move out yourself.",
        "Clint: All right. Stop. You are making your father the heart patient very angry.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry, Dad. What is she talking about?",
        "Clint: Kimberly paid us a visit.",
        "Natalie: To lay the groundwork to make another play for Dad, but I gave her the heave-ho.",
        "Jessica: Where do you get off doing that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Shane, look. Just please talk to me.",
        "Shane: You want to talk? Fine. Tell me why you had to dig Mom up and how that makes the Mannings pay for what they did to her. When are they ever gonna have to pay, Dad, ever?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So you can trust me. You can talk to me.",
        "Jack: That's not what Dad says.",
        "Blair: So do you believe everything that your dad says after everything we learned?",
        "Jack: That was not his fault.",
        "Blair: I know that, but he lied to us.",
        "Jack: That's always what it comes back to with you, isn't it--Dad is a liar, and everything is his fault. Well, Dad might have done some bad things, but Scarface is no saint, either.",
        "Blair: Ok. You haven't had a chance to get to know him.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I have.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, you have?",
        "Jack: I mean, I saw him stealing from our safe.",
        "Blair: Well, what did he take?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: Detective...",
        "John: Mm.",
        "Irene: Are prisoners not allowed visitors?",
        "John: Yeah, during visiting hours.",
        "Victor: Just gonna talk to her for a second, man. When I'm done with her, I'm never coming back. Just gonna talk to her. What am I gonna do?",
        "John: You got 10 minutes.",
        "Victor: Well?",
        "Irene: You are gonna get me out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What did Todd take from the safe?",
        "Jack: I don't know. I really couldn't tell.",
        "Blair: Well, when was it?",
        "Jack: Last night after you went to bed.",
        "Blair's voice: Are you crazy?",
        "Todd's voice: You offered it to me.",
        "Blair's voice: I know what I offered, but I'm not gonna let you go shoot Victor, and if you want to go throw away your life, you go do it, but I'm not gonna help you, good Lord, and I'm certainly not gonna be around to pick up the pieces.",
        "Blair: No. He couldn't have.",
        "Jack: Mom, what's wrong?",
        "Blair: Oh, it's gone.",
        "Jack: What is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Victor is with Irene?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. She called him.",
        "Todd: He's in on it with her? Is that it? He's been in on it with her from day one?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. Victor loathes her as much as you do.",
        "Todd: Well, what's he doing with her?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know. She called him. She said, you know--",
        "Todd: She said what?",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not important.",
        "Todd: What's not important?",
        "T\u00e9a: I think she said she wanted to see him.",
        "Todd: So he just scampered away to be at her heels.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, she's got some sort of weird hold on him.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'll say. Oh, he's a good, little mutt. He'll follow orders.",
        "T\u00e9a: What orders?",
        "Todd: Mommie dearest is gonna sic big, old Victor on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: I'm gonna get you out of here? Nah. Well, why don't I have the charges dropped against you while I'm at it?",
        "Irene: Let's start small.",
        "Victor: Bye, Mom.",
        "Irene: I can't help you from behind bars.",
        "Victor: What makes you think I need your help?",
        "Irene: Of course, you do, unless you want Todd to raze your life to the ground and take everything you have left. If I know Todd--and I've had 8 years to get into his head--he's not wasting any time. He's already begun co-opting your family. He's living with Victoria, isn't he? Next, he'll be ingratiating himself to the children, if he hasn't already, and when he's done with them, he'll take Blair... and finally, T\u00e9a.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, you two really are two peas in a pod.",
        "Todd: No, no. Don't do that. You can't compare him to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Together, you might really accomplish something, but instead, you both just revert to paranoia.",
        "Todd: It's not paranoia if it turns out that it's true. Some insane, crazy lady literally replaced me with my own twin and then tried to have me killed. I have a right to be vaguely paranoid.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, if it makes you feel any better, she wanted to have Victor killed, too. He is with her right now trying to break ties with her, which, I'd imagine, is not an easy task.",
        "Todd: Why is it difficult? You just don't engage. I'm never gonna share oxygen with that lunatic redhead ever again.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know you probably think that that's true, and I wish I did, too, but I don't think she's done with you.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Well, I'm done with her.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, you're not, not until you find out why she kept you alive and captive for 8 years. Why did she do that? What did she want from you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Just when I think you can't get anymore petty and selfish--",
        "Natalie: I was protecting our father.",
        "Jessica: From what, Natalie? There's nothing left to steal.",
        "Natalie: You don't like her, either.",
        "Jessica: Doesn't matter whether I like her. Dad does. That's all that matters. Why do you feel the need to meddle in everybody else's relationships? Do you want to date Kim? Is that the thing here?",
        "Clint: Ah, this needs to stop right now.",
        "Natalie: You forget how much Kim hurt Dad last year? I mean, instead of sticking around and working out the problems like couples that love each other are supposed to do, she just walked out on him.",
        "Jessica: Well, now he know she must have had a reason.",
        "Natalie: Dad waited for her. He searched for her. Kim had plenty of time to come to her senses.",
        "Jessica: Or come clean.",
        "Natalie: Maybe, but she didn't, and now she just waltzes back into his life and expects everything to go back to the way it was.",
        "Clint: That's not what happened, Natalie, and you know it.",
        "Natalie: Too damn late, Dad, ok? Kimberly has herself to blame, just like the rest of us. We all just need to move on.",
        "Jessica: Like you have with Brody.",
        "Natalie: Like you have with Ford. Brody and I are family, and you can cry about it all you want, but nothing will change that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: I don't want any more of your help.",
        "Brody: What's going on over there?",
        "John: Who cares? Where you been?",
        "Brody: Shane needed to see me.",
        "John: How's he doing?",
        "Brody: Not good. He's hell-bent on making Jack and his father pay for what they did to Gigi.",
        "John: I don't blame him.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Me, neither. Maybe there's a way we can make that happen.",
        "John: This guy--Victor, Todd, whatever his name is--he's gonna pay for everything he did, but as far as Gigi's case goes, he's covered his tracks.",
        "Brody: So what do we do now?",
        "John: Next time he slips up, we'll be there.",

        "Jessica: Natalie, Ford and I are not together. You want to know why? Because I have self-respect, a quality that you, the town tramp, are sorely missing.",
        "Natalie: Would you like to sorely be missing a few teeth?",
        "Clint: All right. Stop it. You're both acting like spoiled brats. Grow up.",
        "Natalie: You know what, Dad? You're absolutely right. Enough is enough.",

        "Jessica: No. Actually, he just left.",
        "Blair: Really? Well, do you know where he went?",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I don't. He said he had some business to attend to.",

        "Natalie: Just a sec.",
        "Clint: Why don't we just sit down and talk about it--you, me, and Jess?",
        "Jessica: Oh, God, what's going on now?",
        "Natalie: You know what? Look. Brody, I hope this is ok with you, but I'd like to call the real estate broker and snatch up that apartment that we saw the other day.",
        "Brody: Fine by me, but I thought you wanted to sleep on it.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I did, but I thought about it, and you know what? It's gonna be a perfect place for us to raise our family, and you know what? I'm not gonna get any rest until I get the hell out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I have an idea.",
        "Dani: You could switch fourth period French?",
        "Destiny: No. You should sleep over at my house tonight. You said you were worried about your mom and Victor, right?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Destiny: So maybe they just need some time alone, and that way, you and I can figure out these class schedules...",
        "Dani: True.",

        "Kim: Died last year. Yeah. I know, but it's not like I saw her, and they never even found the body. So I can always think of her as alive. That way, I can think of her still somewhere out there in the world, not stuck in the cold, hard ground.",
        "Shaun: That makes sense.",
        "Kim: Don't make fun of me.",
        "Shaun: I'm just saying, it's sad when anyone dies young, no matter who it is. So you probably heard about Stacy's sister.",
        "Kim: Yeah. I did.",
        "Shaun: You ok?",
        "Kim: Yeah. I'm fine. You're right. It is sad when anyone young dies. No one deserves that.",

        "Victor: I've dealt with bigger and better than him for 8 years now.",
        "Irene: And why is that? Where do you think you got the tools to do so? I made you the man you are today.",
        "Victor: You made me into a freak.",
        "Irene: Oh, you think you're a freak now? You should've seen what you were before, literally good for nothing--physical, mental, and emotional runt. Any success that you have enjoyed is because of me, but if you fail, you're gonna fail all by yourself, because you abandoned your poor mother, the one who brought you into this world, who raised you and molded you. I didn't put all that time and effort into making you into something, only to have you disappoint me. I will still love you, Victor, and I am the only one who will.",

        "Blair: Listen. I appreciate that, but I will take care of this, all right? We'll have this conversation later.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I have no idea what it was that Irene Manning wanted from me. She had her goons ask me the same questions over and over again. They thought I had something. They thought that I had something that they wanted.",
        "T\u00e9a: What was it?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I don't have a clue. I didn't have a clue then. I have less of a clue now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Huh. Don't you want to find out?",
        "Todd: No. Delgado, given the choice between spending my energy doing that and getting to know my granddaughter-- she's beautiful...",

        "Victor: That's fine. She can burn in hell.",
        "Irene: Come visit me again soon, won't you, son? Next time, bring my grandchildren. I'd love to get to know them.",

        "Victor: What do you mean, the one where I don't tell John that you're raising his kid? It's funny you should mention that. I'm starting to rethink my whole stance on that.",
        "Brody: You can't do that.",
        "Victor: You know what I can't do, Lovett, is keep a man in the dark about the truth, even if it's John. First chance I get.",

        "Clint: There is no reunion.",

        "Kim: I just want to say I'm sorry about before, especially the whole \"Cuckoo's Nest\" thing. I'm just under a lot of pressure, but I want you to know that the bills will be taken care of. Everything will be taken care of. Everything is gonna be just fine.",

That's right-- our own place. It's gonna make us feel even more like a family. So we can't let anyone mess with it... like Victor Lord Jr. He's a bad guy, Liam. He's threatening to go to John and tell him the truth, that I'm not really your father. John is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm not kidding around. He's got a gun.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Yeah. That's why I went over to Victor's office and asked him to keep quiet. I thought it wouldn't be a problem. He hates John McBain. He doesn't think he deserves to have a son, yeah, especially not a son like you. When I went over there, I kind of mess up. Yeah. I lost my cool with Victor. I threatened him. If you knew what that meant, you'd be upset with me. I crossed the line, played the Navy Seal card, warned him I could make someone disappear if I had to. Couldn't believe the words were coming out of my mouth, but I didn't know what else to do. He was provoking me. It was like he was daring me to stop him. I can't let him tell John the truth, Liam. I can't lose you.",

        "Jack: I saw his stealing from the safe at Aunt Dorian's. I thought it was money, but then I heard Mom say it was a gun.",
        "Victor: Who was she talking to?",
        "Jack: Who cares?",
        "Victor: Just curious.",
        "Jack: How can you be so calm about this? The guy wants you gone. We both know he wouldn't think twice about pulling the trigger.",
        "Victor: Does he know that you know about the gun?",
        "Jack: No. When I saw him stealing, I thought it was money, like I said, but--",
        "Victor: Now, did you confront him about this directly to his face?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why wouldn't I? I'm not scared of him. He started going into all this stuff about how he thought he was my father and how I should get to know him. Oh, I just told him to go to hell.",
        "Victor: That's my boy.",
        "Jack: It's true, Dad. Nothing has changed, not for me. You're my father. This guy is nobody.",
        "Victor: Nobody who wants to kill me.",
        "Jack: Well, we're not gonna give him that chance. We have to get you out of here, get you safe before he shows up with that gun.",
        "Victor: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Jack: Dad, come on. I'm not letting him take you away from me.",
        "Victor: Don't worry. No one is gonna kill me."
