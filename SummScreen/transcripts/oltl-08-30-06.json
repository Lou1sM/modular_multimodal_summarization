        "John comes into Spencer's apartment with an officer. He is cuffed and he smiles as he is being cuffed. He is sure that he will be out in no time. Blair assures him that she will have him out of jail the following day. \"I want to speak to my fiancee in private.\" John will not allow it. Spencer taunts John that he is doing this for the media attention and that he can suck it up all he wants but it won't be for long. Spencer is led out and Blair calls Spencer to tell him that Spencer has been arrested. Todd wants to know that Blair told Spencer the truth about her not really loving him. She hasn't done that yet. She wants to make sure that this is over before she comes clean to Spencer. Nat is sad. She tells Bo that she failed her exam. She was too wrapped up in the investigations and John and didn't stay focused enough. Hugh gives the word that their prisoner has arrived. David and Paige arrive happy as clams. Todd and Evangeline arrive next. Blair is the last to come in and she smiles at Todd when she sees him. Jessica arrives home. Everyone knows that the time is close. Her integration time is near. She is remembering the abuse and that is the major clue. She warns Antonio that she might not be the same person at the end of this. He assures her that he doesn't care, they will work this out. She talks alone to Nash next. He can see that she is telling him goodbye. She is sorry that she can't let Tess out to say goodbye to him. He doesn't let her finish her speech and he suddenly grabs her and kisses her. She is sorry for he and Tess. She has a session the next day and she invites Nash to it. 'Simple Assault, Dealing in Infant Children, Obstruction, Abuse of Corpse, Kidnapping, Intimidation of Witnesses, Conspiracy There are just some of the charges that are going to be tossed at Spencer. He jokingly turns to David for support but there isn't any. He reminds Paige that she has made mistakes herself and they will never go away. \"Go to hell!\" is how she responds. Spencer remarks that Hugh isn't having such a great career. First he puts an innocent man on death row and now this. He assures the Commish that none of this will stick. He is sure that Todd only wants to see him in jail because he's been having sex with Blair. \"You will never have her,\" Spencer sneers. \"I already do,\" Todd retorts. John has lots of charges, but there is one that isn't on there that he wants. \"We have to get a warrant for his office, hotel room and anywhere else the bastard hangs out. We have to find that gun!\""

        "Viki: Oh, baby. You must be exhausted.",
        "Jessica: Well, I -- uh -- looked him in the eye. I told him how he ripped me in two and that he almost destroyed my life, and he couldn't even look at me. Couldn't even say he was sorry.",
        "Clint: Honey, it took a lot of courage to face him.",
        "Antonio: Yes. And at least now Snyder's going away for the rest of his miserable life.",

        "Paige: So what's going on? What's the big emergency?",
        "David: Something's going to happen tonight to Spencer. I figure when it does, we ought to be together.",
        "Paige: Did they catch him?",
        "David: Paige, I think it's finally over for my brother.",

        "Evangeline: Hey. I hope you don't mind me just stopping by like this.",
        "Todd: No, no. Come on in.",
        "Evangeline: I've been worried about you ever since the party last night.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah? Thanks. But you can come by anytime. You're welcome here all the time, you know that.",
        "Evangeline: What's going on, Todd? Did something happen?",
        "Todd: Yeah, a lot happened.",
        "Evangeline: What, is it about Spencer? I heard the police are close to bringing him down, and I thought you might like some company when that happens. Todd, what's going on? Is there more?",
        "Todd: Blair.",

        "John: Spencer Truman, you're under arrest for obstruction of justice.",
        "Spencer: \"Obstruction of justice\"?",
        "John: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",
        "Reporter: Ms. Cramer, do you have any comment on --",
        "John: You have the right to an attorney --",
        "Reporter: Any comment?",
        "John: And to have that attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you at government expense.",
        "Spencer: You're wasting your time, John. Blair, everything's going to be all right. You hear me? We're going to get through this, you understand? As I was saying, we are going to get through this, do you understand they've got nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Ok, just -- just tell me what the doctors said.",
        "Kelly: They said I had to stay overnight, but they didn't think I should go to the hospital.",
        "Kevin: Well, that's good news.",
        "Kelly: Oh. Why did I do this? Why did I leave Llanview? If I hurt the baby --",
        "Kevin: Wait -- just don't say that, all right?",
        "Kelly: But you said it. The other night when I called, you said that running away might put stress on the baby.",
        "Kevin: Ok, I know what I said -- part of the reason I'm here to get you.",
        "Kelly: \"Get\" me?",
        "Kevin: I'm taking you home tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Oh, your timing stinks as usual, Brennan.",
        "Jessica: Please, Antonio, stop. I can't do this.",
        "Antonio: I'm going to go check on her -- alone.",
        "Nash: Well -- uh -- hmm. What did I miss here?",
        "Clint: Jessica is starting to remember more and more about what happened to her as a child. We think she's very close to integration.",
        "Antonio: You're remembering things -- when you were a kid?",
        "Jessica: It's time, Antonio. I'm ready. I just -- I have to know that you are, too.",
        "Antonio: Honey, of course I am. Anything you need, you know that.",
        "Jessica: You have to be prepared for the fact that this might be the last night that I am who I am.",
        "Antonio: Honey, Tess is not going to take over. You're strong now.",
        "Jessica: That's not what I'm talking about. Even if we never see Tess again, after we do this, I'm not going to be the same. And if I'm not, will you still want me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: He's finished, Paige. They finally put out a warrant for his arrest.",
        "Paige: I -- I can't believe it.",
        "David: I figured maybe we could wait here, watch the parade as it passes by on the way to the stockade.",
        "Paige: What were the charges?",
        "David: I don't know exactly, but if there's one thing I know about John Mc Bain and my adventures in Thailand with him, he is thorough. He wouldn't have thrown the book at him yet unless he had all the evidence he needed.",
        "Paige: Oh. I just -- I -- I can't believe this is really happening after all these years, all these lies. Well, what about you? Aren't -- aren't you happy?",
        "David: Uh -- I don't know if that's the word for me, but I bet I know one guy who's doing the happy dance over this news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: I do not get you, Todd.",
        "Todd: Neither do I.",
        "Evangeline: I mean, this is it. This is the day we've been waiting for. Spencer is finally going to be brought to justice, and -- and you look like you're about to jump out of your skin. And all you have to say is \"Blair\"?",
        "Todd: The whole thing was a ruse.",
        "Evangeline: What whole thing?",
        "Todd: Blair and Spencer. Damn it. It never seemed real to me. And I felt something the other day when we were visiting Starr and she --",
        "Evangeline: When you kissed her?",
        "Todd: Yeah. And more than that. Even when she accepted his marriage proposal, I knew something was off. She was just here, and she admitted it. Son of a --",
        "Evangeline: Admitted what, Todd?",
        "Todd: She's sleeping with Spencer to set him up.",
        "Evangeline: What?",
        "Todd: Yeah, she told Mc Bain what she was up to.",
        "Evangeline: Well, I'm surprised that John would let her get away with that.",
        "Todd: Well, he's not going to keep her from doing it, so he just figured he'd let her do it. Anything to get his father's killer, right?",
        "Evangeline: So this whole time Blair knew that Spencer was setting you up and -- and she didn't do anything about it?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, she didn't believe me till Margaret walked in alive. Then she figured it out, and she figured that the only way to bring him down was to keep having sex with him. What are you thinking?",
        "Evangeline: Well, you know what, Todd? Personally, I could care less about Blair after the way she turned her back on you, but I have a question for you.",
        "Todd: What is that?",
        "Evangeline: Have you forgiven her?",
        "Todd: No, I haven't forgiven her. But she's the reason Mc Bain's got an arrest warrant for Truman tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Spencer, I'll call your lawyer. You'll be out on bail by tomorrow morning, ok?",
        "Spencer: Good girl. Yeah. You know, John, you're the only one that's going to look foolish in the morning. Do you realize that?",
        "John: We'll see.",
        "Spencer: Fine, man. Go ahead, parade me through the media jackal get your headlines, your photographs, do whatever you got to do. It's only going to make you look all the more stupid when I clear my name and my reputation.",
        "John: You can practice your snappy comebacks in your cell tonight.",
        "Blair: I'll change my clothes and meet you down at the station.",
        "Spencer: If you don't mind, I'd like to have a moment alone with my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "John: Yeah, I don't see that happening. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Reporter: Dr. Truman, do you have any comment --",
        "Second reporter: How do you feel about the charges?",
        "Officer: Back off, back off! Give us some space, all right?",
        "Reporter: Dr. Truman, do you have any comment --",
        "Second reporter: Dr. Truman, how do you feel about the charges?",
        "Third reporter: Any comment --",
        "Officer: Back off. Give us some space, all right?",
        "Reporter: Dr. Truman, over here -- any comment?",
        "Blair: Never again, you son of a bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Who the hell do you think you are? You tracked me down so you could drag me back?",
        "Kevin: Look, I'm not here to upset you, all right? Do you -- if this isn't a clear sign that you should be home right now with your own doctor watching --",
        "Kelly: I'm getting fine care here. God, I am such an idiot. Why did I call you? I knew you would do something like this.",
        "Kevin: You need to calm down. This is the last thing the baby needs.",
        "Kelly: You're the last thing the baby needs.",
        "Dr. Mulhern: What's going on here?",
        "Kelly: This man is not welcome here. Please ask him to leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: So, Jessica confronted this Snyder?",
        "Viki: Yes. And then she started to have more memories about what happened to her as a child. Which means that since these memories are coming far more frequently, she's probably very close to remembering the actual abuse.",
        "Nash: So -- so Jessica is starting to -- um -- absorb more of Tess?",
        "Clint: Yeah, that's one way of looking at it.",
        "Viki: You know, it's -- it's as if a door is being opened between the two personali -- well, no, it's as if a wall is coming down between them. You know, when she's integrated, everything is going to be completely different for her. You have to know that, Nash.",
        "Nash: Yeah, and u guys -- you were going to let all of this happen without telling me? Yeah.",
        "Antonio: How could you possibly think that? Huh? I love you. I love you more than anything in the world. You have to know that.",
        "Jessica: Please don't do this. Don't just tell me what you're supposed to tell me, ok? I am serious.",
        "Antonio: And so am I. I've never been more serious in my entire life.",
        "Jessica: Ok, once I have all of Tess' memories, all of them, I might not be the same person.",
        "Antonio: Ok, honey, so what are you saying? That Tess' memories, her -- her time with Nash, their memories can actually override ours?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You know, I just hope this finally puts an end to all the crap that you have had to deal with concerning Spencer over the years. You really got the raw end of the deal when it came to him. I wish I could've helped you more.",
        "Paige: You stood by me, and you -- you tried to help when Spencer was framing Bo.",
        "David: You know, I just -- I keep thinking about that kid that you and Spencer helped deliver. Think he's still alive?",
        "Paige: Well, Margaret had a difficult delivery, but the baby was -- was born healthy. And no matter what bad things Spencer has done, I -- I still have a lot of trouble believing that he would actually hurt a child.",
        "David: Yeah, well maybe after he's arrested he'll finally give the kid up.",
        "Paige: If he even knows where he is. He probably sold him to some baby broker in Thailand.",
        "David: Yeah, well he --",
        "Paige: I doubt if he interviewed the prospective parents.",
        "David: What you don't know can't hurt you, right?",
        "Paige: Huh.",
        "David: Paige, if you had never hooked up with Spencer, ink about how different your life would've been. Maybe a decent husband, a couple of kids -- a real life.",
        "Paige: Well, it -- I made my choices. I'm not going to waste time regretting things now.",
        "David: Yeah, I know what you mean. If I thought about all of my regrets, I wouldn't have time to eat. I like to eat.",
        "Paige: Wow. Spencer was willing to let Todd die, just so he could have a straight shot to Blair.",
        "David: How many guys do you know would instigate a double murder and an execution just to keep two people apart?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I resent Blair for what she did to me. She chose a sociopath over me. She tore apart our family in the process. I don't know how I'm going to forgive her for that.",
        "Evangeline: Well, you still love her, don't you, in spite of everything?",
        "Todd: Well, we've been together a long time. We've got kids.",
        "Evangeline: Ah. I see.",
        "Todd: That holds people together no matter how you feel.",
        "Evangeline: Mm-h, yeah. It's all about the children.",
        "Todd: Well, what can I say? It's a little complicated.",
        "Evangeline: You say you don't care about Blair. You say that you don't love her, but I think you never stopped. And I think that because of the way you were acting before you found out what she was really up to with Spencer.",
        "Todd: I think you're wrong.",
        "Evangeline: Hmm, maybe. Or maybe you're in denial. I mean, look at you, Todd. You're a mess, because you can't reconcile what Blair did while you were in prison with what she's doing now to make up for it.",
        "Todd: What do you want me to say?",
        "Evangeline: Did you see Blair today?",
        "Todd: Yes, I told you that.",
        "Evangeline: And what happened? Did you sleep with her?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Todd: Hey, you all right?",
        "Blair: Fine. Actually, better than fine. They just took Spencer out of here in handcuffs.",
        "Todd: Did you tell him the truth?",
        "Blair: Not yet.",
        "Todd: Why not?",
        "Blair: Look, I will, Todd, as soon as he is indicted. When he can't hurt me any more or anyone else.",
        "Todd: You're stalling.",
        "Blair: Todd, what if the charges don't stick? What if the police want me to get more evidence on him? I'm not going to say anything until I know for sure that this is over, ok?",
        "Todd: Whatever.",
        "Blair: Just understand, please.",
        "Todd: Look, I'll see you at the station, all right?",
        "Blair: Ok. Thanks.",
        "Todd: Hmm. They arrested Spencer.",
        "Evangeline: Let's go.",
        "Todd: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Lieutenant Mc Bain's bringing Truman in, and I want to bring this clear -- we do everything strictly by the book. Let's not give Truman anything that he could turn around, use against us in court.",
        "Officer: Yes, sir.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Officer: Got it, sir.",
        "Bo: Carry on. Hey, why the look? Something wrong?",
        "Natalie: You know, it just seems so trivial with all of the things that are going on right now.",
        "Bo: Come in my office.",
        "Bo: What's going on?",
        "Natalie: I looked at my grade for the exam.",
        "Bo: Didn't go well?",
        "Natalie: I failed.",
        "Bo: I'm sorry. Ah -- hey, you know, it's a tough test.",
        "Natalie: It's my fault, you know? I wasn't focused. I've been dealing with family, and this whole thing with John, it's -- I just wasn't focused.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Ok, just -- yeah, come in.",
        "Hugh: Bo --",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Hugh: They just pulled up to the building. Our prisoner's here.",
        "Bo: Let's do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Mulhern: The initial sonogram indicated an irregular fetal heartbeat. We followed up with a more detailed scan, but we saw no signs of fetal distress. There isn't necessarily a problem. But we're monitoring Kelly and the baby closely to see if anything changes.",
        "Kevin: Thanks, doctor. I appreciate it.",
        "Dr. Mulhern: I'll be back shortly to do another sonogram. In the meantime, I want you to stay calm. Keep that blood pressure down, alright?",
        "Kelly: I'll try.",
        "Dr. Mulhern: I'll be right outside --",
        "Kevin: All right.",
        "Dr. Mulhern: If you have any more questions.",
        "Kevin: Oh, thanks again. Well, it doesn't look like there's anything to be concerned about.",
        "Kelly: Another sonogram. That can't be good.",
        "Kevin: Look, I'm sure they're just being cautious because of your history. Are you going to look at me?",
        "Kelly: I wanted to be alone, Kevin. That's why I came here. I didn't want to be found. And now here you are, only to watch me lose your son's baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Nash, nobody is keeping anything from you. We just found out today what was happening with Jessica, and we decided to call Dr. Jamison and set up an appointment for first thing tomorrow.",
        "Nash: To take advantage of these new memories she's having.",
        "Viki: Nash, she needs to do this.",
        "Nash: Yes, she does.",
        "Viki: The thing is, even if this is a success tomorrow and she comes out of it a whole person, completely integrated, her recovery is still going to take a very long time.",
        "Nash: Great. That's very comforting.",
        "Viki: No one is trying to shut you out. It's just that, from now on, whatever happens is up to Jessica, not Tess. Now, I know that may be very hard for you to accept, but you really have no choice.",
        "Jessica: Once I get all of Tess' memories, once I'm integrated, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know how it'll feel. I don't know how I'll feel, and I don't know what it's going to mean for us, but I do know things are going to change and everything is going to be different.",
        "Antonio: Well, I don't know how to respond to that except that I love you. Ok? Everything else -- we'll deal with. We have no choice, do we?",
        "Jessica: You asked me if the feelings and Tess' memories of Nash could ever override my feelings for you, and I can't imagine that happening. You're the man I want to be with. You're the man that I love. Always. But I might not be the same person after this. I'm scared.",
        "Antonio: I know. I know. So am I.",
        "Jessica: Could you just -- can you just hold me?",
        "Antonio: Yes. Come here.",
        "Nash: Jessica's your daughter. And you would do anything for her. I understand that. I understand that especially now that I'm a father myself, of your granddaughter. But what you've got to understand is that I love Tess. She is the mother of my child and the woman of my dreams. And this -- this integration -- well, it's the end for me. It's the end of my hopes for a family and for all of my dreams.",
        "Clint: Nash, I am sorry that you're going tough this, but you know the only way for Jessie to get well is for her to open herself up to Tess' memories and let them meld with her own.",
        "Viki: Once this is over, Jessie will finally be able to live a full and a healthy life, and it is the right thing -- for Jessie, and especially for your daughter.",
        "Nash: And for the two of you and for Antonio.",
        "Jessica: Nash, I need to speak with you -- alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Paige? Hey, guess what. The -- the sirens we heard? That's the cavalry bringing Spencer in right now. There's two news vans. There's a whole gaggle of reporters behind him. It's a sight to behold, so if we hurry -- come on.",
        "Paige: What, you really want to be there?",
        "David: I want a front-row seat.",
        "Paige: So do I.",
        "David: Then let's go!",
        "Paige: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What's taking so long, you know?",
        "Hugh: I don't know. I'm sure John's just trying to avoid the reporters. He's probably bringing Truman in the back way.",
        "Bo: Ahem.",
        "Natalie: Not this time. I think John's going to want to hold a press conference.",
        "Bo: No, I want this guy booked and locked up before we talk to anybody.",
        "Natalie: Got it, Commish -- by the book.",
        "Bo: Huh. Hey.",
        "Paige: Hey.",
        "Bo: Hey, you heard, huh?",
        "Paige: Yeah, David found out, and he thought I should know.",
        "Bo: Been waiting for this for a long time.",
        "Paige: We all have.",
        "David: I feel weird. No, I feel satisfied. No, I feel weird.",
        "Natalie: That's because, no matter what, Spencer's still your brother.",
        "David: Well, he sure never acted like one.",
        "Todd: Where is he? I didn't miss it, did I?",
        "Bo: No, no. We believe that he's in the building.",
        "Todd: Well, that's good.",
        "Bo: It's getting a little crowded in here, isn't it?",
        "Todd: Well, buddy, if you want me out of here, you're going to have to throw me out the window.",
        "Bo: Well, manning, I don't think that'll be necessary because I believe that you deserve to be here as much as anybody.",
        "John: All right. Sit down. Let's get him processed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Mulhern: Mr. Buchanan, I don't know what's going on between you and Ms. Cramer. Frankly, it's none of my business. But if it adversely affects the health of my patient or her baby --",
        "Kevin: Look, I'm not here to cause any trouble, all right? I'm here to prevent it.",
        "Dr. Mulhern: Then, please, whatever you think is best for Ms. Cramer and her baby, just make sure she agrees with you.",
        "Kevin: All right. I understand.",
        "Dr. Mulhern: I hope you do because stress can cause more problems than you may realize, and Ms. Cramer is under enormous stress. She wants this baby desperately. And right now she needs to know that she's safe. If you'll excuse me.",

        "Viki: Do you know why she wants to talk to Nash?",
        "Antonio: I'm not sure, but I hope this is the last time she feels she has to explain something to him.",
        "Nash: I heard what happened this morning. Um -- that's tough.",
        "Jessica: It must be tough for you, too.",
        "Nash: Yeah. I'm sorry. I can still see Tess in those eyes.",
        "Jessica: I know. I'm not Tess, Nash, and after tomorrow, I probably still won't be. I --",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: But if this integration thing works, I'm going to know how Tess felt when she was in love with you. I'm going to have all of her memories. But I'm with Antonio. I love him. And that's not going to change, no matter how much you want it to.",
        "Nash: So, u asked me in here to what? Say goodbye?",
        "Jessica: Yes.",

        "Officer: Address?",
        "Spencer: Palace hotel, 2541 high street, suite 2131. I don't suppose you'd like to offer a little brotherly support here, Dave.",
        "David: Spencer, I don't like \"I told you so's\" because they're usually aimed at me, but this one's classic and it's pointed at you.",
        "Spencer: Yeah. And you -- hey, you get to finally get a little payback there, a little revenge against big, bad Spencer. How does that make you feel? Enjoy it while you can, Paige, because the mistakes that you've made in your life you cannot erase. You made those all by yourself.",
        "Paige: Drop dead.",
        "Officer: Remove your watch, sir and your jacket.",
        "Spencer: Hey, Evangeline.",
        "Evangeline: Hey, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: Listen, I think I got a few bucks on me here. Why don't you let me put you on retainer? You know, I'm sure even an attorney of your caliber and recent track record could get these ridiculous charges dismissed.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, Spencer, thanks for the vote of confidence, but I think I'll pass.",
        "Spencer: I wouldn't be gloating too much if I were you, Commish. I mean, what do you think's going to happen when all the charges against me, your whole case, just falls apart?",
        "Bo: I'm not worried. We got more than enough charges to choose from, more than enough to put you away.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, but do you think you really have enough to hold me indefinitely on some sort of obstruction of justice charge? Come on. Oh, hey, counselor. Didn't see you back there. Hey, you really think this is a very good career move for you, man? Committing another very high-profile mistake of this nature? I mean, first you send an innocent man to death row, and then you have me arrested on false charges? Can't be good.",
        "Hugh: I'll get back to you on that.",
        "Spencer: I bet you will. And you -- oh, Mr. Manning. Lest you forget, you would be dead right now if it weren't for me -- dead and buried. I mean, are you really that jealous, Todd? You have to throw me in jail here on some falsified charges just to keep me from having sex with your ex-wife?",
        "Spencer: You're never going to have her again, man.",
        "Todd: I already do.",

        "Kelly: Kevin, no.",
        "Kevin: You know, I know that you would never do anything to hurt the baby. I know that. And I know that you needed, you know, some time to get away. I -- I don't blame you after all the terrible things we said to each other. Most of all, I know how much you want to have this baby. And I know that you would do anything to make sure that it's healthy. So whatever you need to make you feel safe, well, that's what I want to give you. That's why I'm here, if that's ok. Right now, you just need to be healthy, take care of yourself so that -- so that you and the baby are healthy. Ok?",
        "Kelly: Ok.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Dr. Mulhern: Time to listen to the baby's heartbeat. Are you ready?",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I'm ready.",

        "Antonio: I know. I know, but don't ask me not to resent him because he's in there right now trying to convince her she shouldn't be who she is.",
        "Jessica: I know this must be nearly impossible for you. I mean, I'm -- I'm finally going to be integrated, and when that happens --",
        "Nash: Tess will be gone forever.",
        "Jessica: I am sorry. I wish that there was some way around this. I know how much you love Tess. I can feel it inside. But I'm not Tess, and I -- I don't love you. I -- I can't.",
        "Nash: Ahem -- thank you.",
        "Jessica: Please. God, you -- please don't do that. You don't owe me.",
        "Nash: Yes, I do. This is hard for you, and you -- you don't have to do this. You don't have to give me a chance to say goodbye.",
        "Jessica: But I -- I can't -- I can't do that. I -- I can't -- I can't let Tess out so you can have this whole goodbye scene. If -- if I do that, then I -- I don't --",

        "Spencer: You just really can't handle the fact that Blair's going to be my wife, can you, Todd?",
        "Todd: I wouldn't schedule any conjugal visits if I were you, Truman.",
        "David: \"Conjugal?\"",
        "Spencer: Hey, Blair, listen, I need you to contact my attorney, Hal Richardson, tell him I need a criminal defense attorney. It's a one-time deal. I won't be needing their services after this whole thing is settled. Thank you.",
        "Hugh: You don't need a defense attorney. You need a miracle worker.",

        "Nash: No yeah. Antonio won't like it.",

        "Hugh: We're working on more, but in the meantime you can check out the statutes. Based on the charges we've got on you already, you're going to have more time behind bars than you've got left to live.",
        "John: Of course, there's still one missing. You know the one I want.",
        "Spencer: Oh, yeah. Well, you're not going to be able to make any of this stick, I can tell you that, especially a 25-year-old murder that I didn't commit.",
