        "Clint goes to talk to Dorian and admits to her that he feels responsible for David leaving her at the altar although he won't admit that he sent David away or that it was not David's choice to leave her. He also indicates that maybe he can help her get even with David. Meanwhile, Destiny tells Matthew she's concerned that he might be going to the \"dark side\" and turning into somebody not unlike Asa or Clint. He tells her he does not think ill of them. But they both agree that his brother, David, did something despicable and doesn't want to follow in the footsteps of anybody like that. However, when Matthew is alone, Clint comes to talk to him about Matthew's \"future\".",
        "In Tahiti, Blair is hesitant about making her wedding official with Eli. His brother Ross comes to visit and indicates that they have a secret. She then gets a call from Kelly who convinces Blair, for the first time, that Eli has several aliases and is responsible for the death of his two ex wives as well as her mother and Blair's aunt and others who were onto him. And she confronts Eli. Todd, Dani and Shaun go to find Tea. But Greg tells them they cannot because she died the previous day. Todd knows he's lying. And Greg makes it clear that he has a secret that he is not revealing to anybody."

        "Greg: T\u00e9a died last night.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Greg: I'm so sorry.",
        "Todd: No. She couldn't have died. She didn't die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Hey, Des. You working?",
        "Destiny: I'm almost done. Do you need the room?",
        "Matthew: I just wanted to change into my suit.",
        "Destiny: Uh, give me a few minutes to finish up.",
        "Matthew: All right, I guess.",
        "Destiny: Oh, and I'm on duty all afternoon, so you need anything, you come to me, not Nate.",
        "Matthew: Why?",
        "Destiny: You can't give him that \"I'm too rich to be human\" attitude today. He's worried about Dani.",
        "Matthew: Yeah?",
        "Destiny: She went to go find her mom before she dies.",
        "Matthew: Oh, boy.",
        "Destiny: So just leave him alone, okay? And don't push me, either.",
        "Matthew: What's wrong with you?",
        "Destiny: I am in no mood today. This mess is left over from my boy David ditching his forever woman Dorian at the altar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Dorian: Oh! Girls, I told you, I don't want any breakfast.",
        "Clint: I didn't bring a muffin basket or lunch, but I did bring something from David.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Mm.",
        "Layla: You think late October would be too soon?",
        "Cristian: For what?",
        "Layla: Our wedding. I want my mother to be able to enjoy it.",
        "Cristian: Well, maybe a wedding will be a good distraction. Look, you're both gonna be thinking about Evangeline that day, whenever it is.",
        "Layla: You're right.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Layla: That should be the invitation samples.",
        "Cristian: I'll get them. Hey.",
        "Delivery person: Hi. Sigh here.",
        "Cristian: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Delivery person: Okay.",
        "Layla: That's too small for the samples.",
        "Cristian: \"The Llanview University Art Department\"? I wonder what this is.",
        "Layla: Is it addressed to you?",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Then open it and find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Did you just say Tahiti?",
        "John: I think that's where Clarke took Blair. You?",
        "Rex: Yeah, that's what we came up with, too, but we thought it was a long shot.",
        "John: Well, if we both came up with the same conclusion, I'll go with it.",
        "Kelly: What do we do now?",
        "John: I called Blair. I couldn't get through.",
        "Kelly: Neither could we.",
        "John: I'll bet.",
        "Kelly: Eli sabotaged her phone. John, what do we do now?",
        "John: We're going through all the proper channels.",
        "Kelly: Right, channels on the other side of the world. Did you happen to tell them that Blair is about to marry a guy who has killed two wives? For all we know, she might be wife number 3.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Conseiller: Do you, Blair, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband, to love and to cherish, to have and to hold, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?",
        "Eli: Blair? Is something wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: I'm sorry, but it's true.",
        "Dani: What happened?",
        "Todd: Nothing happened.",
        "Greg: She died in her sleep. She wasn't in any pain at all. It was very peaceful. The last thing she saw before she closed her eyes was a picture of you two.",
        "Dani: Oh, God, she's-- she's gone? She's--",
        "Todd: No, she's not gone. This is pretty low, Evans.",
        "Greg: I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, Todd, but it's--",
        "Todd: Don't. Dani, don't worry. He's lying to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: What, you think I don't know how to be decent?",
        "Destiny: You used to.",
        "Matthew: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Destiny: I'm your friend, right?",
        "Matthew: I don't know. You used to be.",
        "Destiny: Well, do you want me to be your friend?",
        "Matthew: Of course, Destiny.",
        "Destiny: Then here it is, straight up. You're changing, Matthew, and not in a good way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: How did you get in here?",
        "Clint: Hilda always liked me better than you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, she's going to lose her job for that, again. Now get out.",
        "Clint: You look like death on toast.",
        "Dorian: Give me my robe, please. As you well know, I am not a morning person.",
        "Clint: Oh, I remember it well. So you're not even curious?",
        "Dorian: About what?",
        "Clint: David.",
        "Dorian: Of course not. I have left that man for the last time.",
        "Clint: Oh, I heard it was the other way around, that David left you at the altar, again.",
        "Dorian: I don't know where you get your information from.",
        "Clint: I can't believe that you got duped by that clown twice...",
        "Dorian: I was not in the least bit duped.",
        "Clint: And this time, he didn't even tell you face to face? He had to write a letter? \"It's not you, it's me. I can't commit to just one woman.\"",
        "Dorian: Clint--",
        "Clint: \"I don't want to hurt you. Lots of love. David.\"",
        "Dorian: Clint!",
        "Clint: Hmm?",
        "Dorian: How do you know what was in that letter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: \"Dear Mr. Vega, after careful consideration of your submission, we're pleased to inform you that the university is awarding you a grant in the amount of--\" holy--",
        "Layla: What? Is it a good number?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, an unbelievable number.",
        "Layla: Keep reading. [Giggles]",
        "Cristian: \"Along with this grant, you have the opportunity to exhibit your work at the Llanview Center of the Arts. We also have reserved a studio for your exclusive use at the university.\" This has got to be a joke.",
        "Layla: No.",
        "Cristian: It's got to be. I never applied for any grant.",
        "Layla: But I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: First, we need someplace to send the authorities.",
        "Rex: Ross Rayburn's house.",
        "John: We're looking up those records now. That'll be our first move.",
        "Kelly: What do you mean?",
        "John: Well, even if they went to Tahiti, it's not like that's Clarke's endgame, you know? It's too easy to trace. It's not like he's thinking that Blair is gonna settle down with him there and live happily ever after.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. There's no way she'd leave her family.",
        "Rex: The guy always leaves himself a back door.",
        "John: Exactly. He's too smart to get cornered like that now.",
        "Kelly: You know what, though? We surprised him.",
        "John: A couple of weeks ago, we surprised him, all right? He's had time to get ready for us.",
        "Rex: You think he has another identity set up?",
        "John: Absolutely. This guy has already gotten rid of two wives, and each time, he's resurfaced with a new alias.",
        "Kelly: But after he collects, right? I mean, he's not gonna kill Blair if there's no way he can get to her money.",
        "Rex: Well, it makes sense. He knows that we're onto him now. There's no way he gonna show up in Llanview saying that Blair had a tragic scuba accident and he tries to get his hand on her estate.",
        "John: Sure, he could.",
        "Kelly: You're right. I mean, he could. He doesn't know that we have hard evidence on him now.",
        "John: Eli could be thinking, \"So what if they're suspicious? It's not like they got any way to prove it.\"",
        "Kelly: You know what, John? I think you need to move on this. Eli could be thinking he's gonna kill Blair, come back here long enough to collect his inheritance, and then disappear again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Blair, is something wrong?",
        "Blair: I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Conseiller: Do you, Blair, take this man--",
        "Blair: Yes, I do. I take this man to be my lawfully wedded husband, to love and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for rich or for poor, till death do us part.",
        "Conseiller: Oh, the rings? Repeat after me. With this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Eli: With this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Blair: With this ring, I thee wed.",
        "Conseiller: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.",
        "Ross: Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Clarke.",
        "Eli: Thanks, man.",
        "Ross: Took you long enough.",
        "Eli: Well, I had to wait to find the right woman.",
        "Ross: I wish I had learned that one. To Blair, for finally making an honest man out of this guy.",
        "Blair: He makes me happy.",
        "Ross: Well, then to Eli, for making you happy as long as you live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: No, I don't understand.",
        "Todd: No, no, it's a trick.",
        "Dani: No, no...",
        "Greg: Look, they have grief counselors. Maybe I can call--",
        "Todd: Do they have cops? Because I think that's what you need.",
        "Shaun: Hold on.",
        "Greg: Wait, what are you talking about?",
        "Todd: This man has been lying to us. This was his plan all along.",
        "Greg: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dani: No, don't, Todd!",
        "Shaun: No, Manning...",
        "Todd: You brought her here. You set the whole thing up. 'Cause I know what you're up to, man, and you're not gonna get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You applied for a grant? You submitted my work?",
        "Layla: I sent in photos of your favorites.",
        "Cristian: This is unbelievable.",
        "Layla: I figured, \"why not?\" I know how to write a grant app, and I know how much you love to teach and paint and how happy you would be if you could do both, and I want you to be happy.",
        "Cristian: You did this for me.",
        "Layla: And now the whole world can see your work.",
        "Cristian: And my own studio, like, full-time.",
        "Layla: Yep. You can leave things out, and you can do big canvases again.",
        "Cristian: I can't believe you did this for me.",
        "Layla: It was easy. I believe in you...",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Layla: And that should be the invitations.",
        "Cristian: No, that's L.U. They want their letter back. I'm sure they were looking for Cristian Huega, not Cristian Vega.",
        "Layla: Stop.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Cristian: Whoa, Layla, did you order jumbo-size invitations?",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I don't think these are the samples.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You are quoting David's letter word for word.",
        "Clint: Now you admit there was a letter.",
        "Dorian: How do you know what was in it?",
        "Clint: I ran into Viki this morning.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Oh, Viki, that vicious gossip.",
        "Clint: Oh, don't blame Viki.",
        "Dorian: Ohh, that sanctimonious rumormonger is peddling my story all over town?",
        "Clint: No, no, no. Viki was worried about you, and so was I.",
        "Dorian: Since when?",
        "Clint: Since you gave me a stadium with my name on it.",
        "Dorian: Ah, yes. Warms the heart, doesn't it? That was blackmail.",
        "Clint: No, it was a straight business deal.",
        "Dorian: Oh, and you're worried that it won't stand?",
        "Clint: No. You already announced it. Would look very, very bad with the voters if you backed off.",
        "Dorian: So you're not here to protect your business investment?",
        "Clint: I'm just here to make sure that... that you're okay. I feel bad for you.",
        "Dorian: Spare me.",
        "Clint: I also feel bad about my part. I'm responsible for David leaving you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're the one who sold T\u00e9a this line, right? She wouldn't have come here if it weren't for you.",
        "Dani: We're...we're too late.",
        "Todd: No, Dani! No, we're not too late! He's lying to us. He's been lying to us since we showed up. Now, where is she?",
        "Greg: Todd, I told you--",
        "Todd: No, I don't want to hear that! Those are lies. I know that.",
        "Greg: Look, I can show you a death certificate if you want.",
        "Todd: Oh, what about a body? You got a body?",
        "Greg: No.",
        "Todd: See? She's not dead. You're hiding her. T\u00e9a didn't want us to see her, so you're hiding her. The game is up, man. Take us to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Is this right?",
        "Cop: We got confirmation from the utilities company and the bank.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "John: Okay. Keep digging, and work fast.",
        "Kelly: John, what is it? What did you find?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, I cannot wait to get home and celebrate with the family.",
        "Eli: Well, I just checked in with the airport. We are on the next flight out.",
        "Blair: Perfect.",
        "Eli: It's tonight, though.",
        "Blair: Tonight? That's as soon as we can get out?",
        "Eli: It's all they had.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm really worried about Dani. I just wanted to--",
        "Eli: I know. I think she's gonna be fine. We'll call her from the gate. I'm sure they have a land line at the airport.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Ross: Listen, I'm glad you're looking out for her.",
        "Blair: I'm trying.",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Eli: Dani is gonna be fine. Looking out for Dani is the one thing that Todd does right.",
        "Ross: I have the scars to prove it.",
        "Eli: Ha!",
        "Ross: Listen, give yourself a honeymoon day. I'm out of here. The place is yours.",
        "Eli: Thanks, Ross.",
        "Ross: Anytime, anytime. Tell Dani I love her when you see her.",
        "Blair: I will.",
        "Ross: Great, and thanks for letting me be a part of my brother's wedding day. You know, we don't have a lot of moments.",
        "Eli: No.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I know. I'm glad that you could be here, Ross.",
        "Eli: Let me walk you out.",
        "Ross: Right on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Someone has been living in Ross Rayburn's house since his death.",
        "Rex: Who?",
        "John: Rayburn. He's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If T\u00e9a is dead, take me to her body.",
        "Greg: I can't. I'm telling you--",
        "Todd: No. Those are lies. T\u00e9a is not dead, but you are going to be if you don't tell me where she is right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: It's from Paris.",
        "Layla: That's what the invoice says?",
        "Cristian: Adriana?",
        "Layla: No. \"Steffen Chaloise Studio.\"",
        "Cristian: Who?",
        "Layla: My favorite designer... that I can't afford. Did you do this?",
        "Cristian: What, you think I can afford a designer?",
        "Layla: Oh, my God.",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Layla: Oh...oh, my God. This is my dress. Can this be my dress?",
        "Cristian: I promise you, it's not mine.",
        "Layla: Oh, no. This is my dress. Cris, look. This is my sketch.",
        "Cristian: You designed a wedding dress?",
        "Layla: I didn't-- I was just playing. I mean, this is the over-the-top, money- is-no-object wedding gown. I just threw it in a drawer.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah?",
        "Layla: Yeah. I didn't even try to price it because I knew I couldn't afford to have it made.",
        "Cristian: But I did.",

        "Matthew: No, no, no. You don't get to drop a bomb like that and go back to dusting.",
        "Destiny: Look, I have two more of these cabanas to clean beef--",
        "Matthew: How am I changing?",
        "Destiny: Think about it, Matthew. I'm sure you'll come up with an answer.",
        "Matthew: So you're turning on me, too, now?",
        "Destiny: You break my heart.",
        "Matthew: I thought we were okay.",
        "Destiny: I don't mean romantically.",
        "Matthew: Then how? How am I changing?",
        "Destiny: It's like you're going over to the dark side!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: How are you responsible for what David did?",
        "Clint: Well, I'm the one who blew the whistle on our fake romance. If I hadn't told David the truth, you two would never have gotten back together again.",
        "Dorian: Yes, against my better judgment.",
        "Clint: Yeah. You were right to steer clear of the guy, even though you were sort of dancing around the edges, but if I had just kept my mouth shut, that's all it would have been, no harm, no foul.",
        "Dorian: So you're taking the blame for it?",
        "Clint: I am just trying to be as straight as I can.",
        "Dorian: Oh, goodie, because, really, I could just use a handy target.",
        "Clint: Yes. So could I, especially since David forced my Kimberly out of town.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. No wonder you wanted to push the two of us together. What perfect revenge.",
        "Clint: Would've been a start.",
        "Dorian: So, did you say you had something David wanted you to give me? Gee, thanks.",
        "[Box opens]",
        "Dorian: Oh, my. Hmm hmm hmm. This is the ring that David talked about giving me on our honeymoon.",
        "Clint: So I figured.",
        "Dorian: How did you get it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: How is Ross alive?",
        "John: I don't know, but we've got canceled checks. Someone has been paying the bills at the house.",
        "Kelly: I thought Todd killed Ross to protect Danielle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I want you to tell me where you put T\u00e9a right now, or--I swear to God-- I'm gonna--",
        "Shaun: Back off, Manning.",
        "Todd: Would you like to tell me instead? You were in on it, right?",
        "Shaun: I brought you here.",
        "Todd: Right, after you phoned Evans and gave him plenty of time to hide.",
        "Shaun: Nope.",
        "Todd: Eh. Why am I talking to you , anyway? You're part of the plan.",
        "Shaun: There's no conspiracy here.",
        "Todd: Well, listen. Help me find her.",
        "Shaun: I did. This is the end of the line.",
        "Todd: Uh-uh. Uh-uh.",
        "Shaun: I didn't tell Greg we were coming. He didn't know. T\u00e9a didn't know.",
        "Todd: Yeah? Well, they found out somehow. That's the only answer.",
        "Shaun: No, it isn't. Listen to Greg.",
        "Todd: I know you like your brother, but he's playing us. He's been playing us from the beginning.",
        "Shaun: I brought you here.",
        "Todd: That's because you know that T\u00e9a and I need to be together, all right? Let's finish this job.",
        "Shaun: We have.",
        "Todd: No, no, no. She's not-- she can't be. She's here somewhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Manning shot Rayburn. He fell into the river, and they never found the body.",
        "Rex: Now we know why.",
        "Kelly: Where are you going?",
        "John: To see Bo. He can get the Tahitian police over to the house. Sit tight and don't touch anything.",

        "Shaun: I'm sorry, but Ms. Delgado is gone. My brother is not lying.",
        "Todd: Oh, you believe your brother? I thought you said he was a creep who doesn't care about family or anything.",
        "Shaun: You got to man up here, bro, for Dani. Pull it together.",

        "Kelly: This is too slow. It's on the other side of the world. By the time they get someone, it's--",

        "Cristian: Well, aren't you glad? I saw the paper, and I thought it was one of my sketches, but then I saw what you'd done, and I just had to see it on you.",
        "Layla: This is a copy of my sketch.",
        "Cristian: Well, I didn't want to send the original, in case you went looking for it.",
        "Layla: You are sneaky.",
        "Cristian: Do you want to hear how I pulled it off?",
        "Layla: Oh, please. Gloat.",
        "Cristian: Well, I sent it to Adriana. I mean, I figured she knew your sizes and whatever the scribbles mean.",
        "Layla: That's why she was the best design partner ever.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, she must be because she got this Steffan guy to make it for you.",
        "Layla: Chris, it must have cost a fortune.",
        "Cristian: It wasn't so bad. Adriana got me a good deal.",
        "Layla: Still.",

        "Layla: Is this how it's gonna be?",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Every day. I am going to do absolutely the right thing, and you will never be mad at me.",

        "Kelly: Blair, is Eli in the room with you?",
        "Blair: Actually, he's outside. I'm getting ready to join him.",
        "Kelly: Blair, don't. Listen to me. We have proof. Everything that I told you about Eli is true.",

        "Matthew: What?",
        "Destiny: I'm just saying--be careful, Matthew. It could be genetic.",
        "Matthew: What could be?",
        "Destiny: Your dad's a great guy, but I've heard about your grandpa, Asa.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, he kicked ass and took names and took care of his family.",
        "Destiny: Grandpa Asa was an S.O.B. when he had to be. Your Uncle Clint has never met a shotgun he didn't like.",
        "Matthew: He just brings it out to make a point. But, uh, my brother, David just left a woman on his wedding day for a second time.",
        "Destiny: You see what I'm saying?",
        "Matthew: All right, I'll agree with you on that. That is bad.",
        "Destiny: I can't believe it, either. I mean, I know David's a flake, but leaving Dorian at the altar--that's not his style.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I got a call from Logan's. And classy guy that he is, David charged your ring to my account.",

        "Clint: I thought you might want it. I mean, you deserve something.",

        "Clint: More like hazard pay.",
        "Dorian: I would rather be buried alive than accept a gift from David.",
        "Clint: I can certainly understand that. But on the other hand, this is a perfect square-cut diamond. So then, if you change your mind...",
        "Dorian: I won't. David is a snake!",
        "Clint: Well, you'll get no fight from me on that, but if someone humiliated me the way David humiliated you, I'd want to skin him alive.",

        "Kelly: I found Eli's mug shot. I snuck into his hotel room. He was shredding a bunch of documents. Forensics put it back together.",

        "Kelly: No. He was Craig Pattison.",
        "Blair: Oh, my gosh! Now he's somebody else? This is completely crazy, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Blair, listen to me. Craig Pattison killed his wife. He was arrested, but he escaped the charge, and then he disappeared.",
        "Blair: No, Kelly, listen to me. You--it's just crazy.",
        "Kelly: He changed his name to Bennett Thompson, and he moved to L.A. He married a woman by the name of Olivia. She disappeared, presumed dead, and Bennett Thompson disappeared with her money, and Elijah Clarke was born. How do you think I got this number?",
        "Blair: How?",
        "Kelly: The police. John is with Bo right now getting the Tahitian police on it. Elijah Clarke is a killer. He's a wife-killer. Are you two married yet?",

        "Cristian: You know there's no rush.",
        "Layla: Yeah, there is. I want a ring on you before you're surrounded by all those artsy Boho chicks.",

        "Layla: I didn't say they would be hot.",

        "Dorian: What? I was discussed on morning radio?",
        "Clint: Oh, you know how they do it. \"What Llanview mayor was left at the altar in her designer gown and her homemade vows,\" et cetera, et cetera, and then they go on all day long about it.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Oh, I--I really do not think that I will be going out today.",
        "Clint: That's probably a good idea.",
        "Dorian: Were there a lot of calls and comments?",
        "Clint: Nothing worth listening to, but good Lord, people are just downright cruel, aren't they? I think it's very wise that you just stay here until it all blows over.",
        "Dorian: I'm not hiding.",
        "Clint: No, of course not. You're catching up on your beauty sleep, and I will tell the maid that you are not to be disturbed, because you want to look a heck of a lot better than this when you finally face the world.",

        "Eli: This is insane. Who is Craig Pattison?",
