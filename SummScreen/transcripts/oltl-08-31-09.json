    "Recap": [
        "While Dorian is working on the Mayor's campaign, she finds out that his son is Justin, the kid who wrecked Matthew's prom and may be the reason he's in the wheelchair in the first place. John informs Nora that the Mayor and Officer Keeton are helping Asher to supply drugs and setting Cole up. And they manage to get a warrant from the judge to investigate them. But right then, Bo and Nora learn for the first time that Justin is the Mayor's son. Fish admits to Cristian and to Layla that he is ashamed to be gay and afraid everybody will judge him. But they assure him they do not. He's their friend and they don't think any less of him. They know that Bo and John will not let anything happen to Fish at his job on the police force. But Lowell admits that he is against gay rights. And Fish gets a call from his father asking to meet his son's \"new girlfriend\" whom he previously told them was Layla."

        "Sergei: Bad news: No supply.",
        "Asher: What?",
        "Sergei: We have no new supply at the moment.",
        "Cole: For how long?",
        "Sergei: Hard to say.",
        "Asher: What's going on?",
        "Sergei: We expected a delivery last night. It had to be canceled. Somehow the cops found out about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: We had information a shipment was coming into the docks last night.",
        "Nora: Why wasn't there a bust?",
        "Bo: They were tipped off.",
        "Nora: Well, that's not good.",
        "John: Actually, it is good.",
        "Bo: We found out who's behind all the drugs that hit the streets this year.",
        "Nora: Who?",
        "John: Mayor Lowell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mayor, your neck is on the line. Victoria Banks has declared her candidacy for mayor. She's running against you.",
        "Mayor Lowell: I know. I just got the call. This is bad news. If anyone can beat me, it's her.",
        "Dorian: Not with me as your campaign manager.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I'm gay. I'm gay. I--I've never said it out loud before.",
        "Layla: It's okay.",
        "Oliver: What, that I am, or that I've never said it before because neither of those are very-- I can't believe it, what I've done: The hiding.",
        "Layla: A lot of people do.",
        "Oliver: No, but not like what I did. I lied to--to everyone, and then last night--this is wrong.",
        "Cristian: What is?",
        "Oliver: All of it. I hate that I'm gay, but I hate what keeping a secret has done even more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: What's the catch?",
        "Todd: There isn't one. I just want you to marry me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, of course. You want custody of the kids, so...",
        "Todd: No, I'm happy with the deal I have.",
        "T\u00e9a: You need a wife so you can go back to court and fight Blair for custody of the kids.",
        "Todd: No, I--that's not true. I'm fine with shared custody.",
        "T\u00e9a: So why do you want to get married?",
        "Todd: Because I love you. Why is that so hard to understand? No, scratch that. I know why. But it's still true.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wait, you're seriously proposing?",
        "Todd: Yes! Do you want to marry me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a Delgado is your wife?",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Blair: The two of you--really? I mean, you're married legally?",
        "Ross: You betcha. Got married on a beach at sunset, till death do us part, the whole nine yards.",
        "Blair: But you did, I mean, part.",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Blair: How long have the two of you been divorced?",
        "Ross: Who said anything about a divorce?",
        "Blair: Isn't she your ex-wife?",
        "Ross: Sorry, love. I know you've been carrying a torch for me all these years, but I am still spoken for.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Ross: Yep. T\u00e9a and I are still married.",
        "Blair: I'll be damned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Okay, so, um, I should let you guys get to it.",
        "Oliver: No, no. I owe you both an apology.",
        "Cristian: But you didn't do anything to me.",
        "Oliver: I lied to you. You knew the truth, and I still said that you were out to get me. I lied to your face.",
        "Cristian: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't believe you anyway.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, well, I should've gotten what you were trying to do.",
        "Cristian: Look, Oliver, I wasn't doing it to out you...",
        "Oliver: I know. You were trying to protect Layla.",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Oliver: And I should've done that, too.",
        "Layla: Hey, Layla's a big girl and she's right here.",
        "Oliver: I'm still sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Layla: This was hard for you. I can tell. You could barely say the word \"gay\" before today.",
        "Oliver: Yeah.",
        "Layla: So what happened?",
        "Oliver: Last night was--I got loaded and I hit bottom. I was-- I don't even know the guy that I was last night. And then when I woke up and saw--it just-- it had to stop. I--I had to stop. I had to fix it or come out, whatever.",
        "Layla: Oliver, why were you so scared? There's nothing wrong with being gay, even at work. The commissioner, John McBain, they wouldn't care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Mayor Stanley Lowell?",
        "Bo: The one and only.",
        "Nora: He's running a drug ring in Llanview?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Oh, come on. How--how did you get this information? Did you get this from Cole?",
        "John: He was part of it.",
        "Bo: Lowell has a dirty cop on his payroll. John figured that out when this Asher Garrett walked, and then Cole got busted all of a sudden.",
        "John: We set a trap. He walked right through.",
        "Nora: Who's the cop?",
        "John: Keeton, Tom Keeton. We have him on tape taking Intel. I gave to him straight to Lowell.",
        "Nora: You taped him without a warrant?",
        "John: Well, that's where you come in.",
        "Nora: What? Oh, now, come on, guys. You got to be kidding me. Really?",
        "Bo: No, we're not trying to get this tape admitted. We just want a warrant.",
        "Nora: By using an illegally recorded tape? Come on. You're gonna need a very special judge for that.",
        "John: Yeah, we know. We got to move on this now, Nora.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, this is much too big for us to keep a lid on any longer, all right? There could be a leak.",
        "Nora: But half the judges are on vacation right now, for God's sake. I mean, the only judge that's available today is--oh.",
        "John: Runyon?",
        "Nora: Yes. Very good. That's Lowell's pal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Viki's well-loved in this town. She has many, many friends.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You're not making me feel better here.",
        "Dorian: I know all of her liabilities.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You go way back, right? A big vendetta?",
        "Dorian: I wouldn't go that far. But trust me, when the time comes, I know all her weak spots.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Then let's get on it right now.",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, no, no. I don't think we have to go so negative this soon.",
        "Mayor Lowell: What, are you afraid to get your hands dirty?",
        "Dorian: Not at all. I just want to make sure that you are positioned correctly to take advantage of her weaknesses.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Like?",
        "Dorian: Like she's been married more than Elizabeth Taylor and Henry viii combined. In contrast, you will look...",
        "Mayor Lowell: Divorced. It was ugly. The--let's just say she took her half and then some.",
        "Dorian: Ah. But you have a son. A son, and there is nothing that is more lovable about a man than when he fights for time with his children. Unless, of course-- ahem--you are my niece's ex-husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a is married. I mean, she's not just married, she's married to you.",
        "Ross: True, and true.",
        "Blair: Oh, you think she's told Todd? No, she probably--she probably couldn't have.",
        "Ross: Trust me, I'm the last name to cross her lips.",
        "Blair: You two have an ugly breakup?",
        "Ross: I wouldn't call it ugly, but I certainly didn't enjoy it.",
        "Blair: Aw. Did you leave her busting open coconuts at a beach hut?",
        "Ross: No. No. But when it started, it started hot and fast right after we crashed on the island.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? It serves you right for trying to steal my kids from me.",
        "Ross: That was not my plan. That was Todd's plan.",
        "Blair: You helped. Anyway, I don't want to talk about that right now. Let's go back to what we were talking about: You and T\u00e9a. Yes, you got together after the crash, and that makes sense.",
        "Ross: Well, it was--it was paradise as far as I was concerned. I could care less if we ever got rescued. T\u00e9a was everything I ever wanted. Of course, she wanted the creep on the other side of the island.",
        "Blair: Well, T\u00e9a never could keep her hands off things that didn't belong to her.",
        "Ross: Well, Todd was having none of it, if that makes you feel any better.",
        "Blair: I don't really care what Todd and T\u00e9a did.",
        "Ross: The guy built a raft that should've broken apart 50 yards into the surf. The thing was a-- was a joke.",
        "Blair: He made it home.",
        "Ross: Well, he was determined to get back to you. Because you were the woman that he loved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: We've been married before.",
        "Todd: That was practice.",
        "T\u00e9a: Twice.",
        "Todd: We needed a lot of practice.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, it was a disaster both times.",
        "Todd: That's ancient history, right? There's no written records, no survivors.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Todd: Now, haven't you grown up since then? I have.",
        "T\u00e9a: When did that happen?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. I'm not perfect, but I'm trying. You can see that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I can see that.",
        "Todd: But you don't quite believe it, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, some days I do.",
        "Todd: Then what?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, look, Todd, it's too fast, okay? A couple months ago you were saying you were in love with Marty Saybrooke. If you'd gotten your way, you'd be in New Mexico with her and Starr's baby right now.",
        "Todd: Yeah. That would've been a mistake.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. No kidding.",
        "Todd: No, this is different.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I hope so. But how can you turn on a dime like that? I mean, no, it's--it's too much.",
        "Todd: No, no, I don't want to waste any more time.",
        "T\u00e9a: Let's--let's live together and see how it goes.",
        "Todd: Is that a no?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asher: Dude, why you looking at me?",
        "Sergei: You seem nervous, Asher.",
        "Asher: I have customers, Sergei. If I can't deliver, I lose them. This only hurts me.",
        "Sergei: Perhaps.",
        "Asher: You honestly think I would rat us out? Why?",
        "Sergei: You been talking to the police lately, Cole?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: We need your son.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Really?",
        "Dorian: He's a crucial part of our strategy.",
        "Mayor Lowell: This is about family values, right? That's the thing? Then let's just focus on my record. I'm pro life, anti gay marriage. That'll get me the votes.",
        "Dorian: We need your son right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You think the guys don't care if I'm--not what they--if I'm gay? You've seen them.",
        "Layla: There are a few jerks maybe.",
        "Oliver: \"A few\"? Come on, Cristian, you know what I'm talking about.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, look, I get what you're saying, but this is a different time. It's not a big deal anymore.",
        "Oliver: It's a police station, okay? It's not exactly the center for political correctness.",
        "Layla: Your job is safe, Oliver. You know that, right? They can't let you go.",
        "Oliver: It's not that. It's--it's how they--I don't know what they think when they look at me. I just--don't want them to know. I don't even want you guys to know.",
        "Cristian: Come on. We're still here, right?",
        "Layla: And we don't think any less of you.",
        "Oliver: It's like I'm on a screen saver, like I'm not even here. I'm--I'm just watching, and then I'll think about something else like work or my parents.",
        "Layla: I spoke to them on the phone. They seemed nice.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, they are. They build houses for poor people and they volunteer at the soup kitchen. My dad's gotten all kinds of commendations for bravery on the job.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, you said he's the reason you wanted to become a cop.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, he is. But he has a very definite idea of what it means to be a man.",
        "Layla: Oh, yeah?",
        "Cristian: Like what?",
        "Oliver: Like--I don't know. Like a man doesn't cry ever, even if he's 5 and he falls off his bike. Or if he misses a fly ball and loses the game. Crying is for--for women or fags.",
        "Layla: Wow.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, no wonder you never said anything before.",
        "Layla: How did you deal? I mean, growing up once you found out, you figured it out, that you were gay?",
        "Oliver: I didn't. I acted as if. You know the saying: Act as if you have something or are something and--and you will be. So I acted. I--you know, I asked the shy girl in my Latin class to homecoming. And she wasn't very pretty, so nobody else would ask her out. And she never expected anything from me, so I passed. And then I went to college, and it was a thousand miles from home. And I joined a frat because that was the good, straight thing to do: The frat. And that's where I met Kyle, and he was just like me. And for the first time in my life, I--I looked at someone that I just--I felt--I felt welcome. And he saw me. It was amazing, until it wasn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: No, this isn't about Todd and me.",
        "Ross: Hmm. No, no, no, of course it is. Why are you here looking for dirt on T\u00e9a?",
        "Blair: Why do you care?",
        "Ross: You know, you would've been better off staying with Todd.",
        "Blair: You don't know that.",
        "Ross: I\u0097my life would've been better. I mean, the day that twit took off from the island and left T\u00e9a and me alone there was the happiest day of my life. We had fun there catching fish, skinny-dipping.",
        "Blair: There wasn't a nail salon. How did T\u00e9a survive?",
        "Ross: It was magical.",
        "Blair: Even though she was thinking about Todd the whole time?",
        "Ross: Not the whole time. She came around. Look, I know that I was a consolation prize, but I didn't care. I was--she's an amazing woman.",
        "Blair: I would gladly send her back to that island.",
        "Ross: I wish you could. Anyway, Todd--he sent a rescue crew.",
        "Blair: But it didn't end there because you two obviously got married.",
        "Ross: T\u00e9a and I made a go of it, the surfer and the lawyer.",
        "Blair: The grifter and the girlfriend.",
        "Ross: Why are you so harsh?",
        "Blair: Oh, come on! You and T\u00e9a disappear completely off the face of the earth with no paper trail, Ross? Come on.",
        "Ross: Well, we may have had reason to use an alias or two.",
        "Blair: Oh, do tell.",
        "Ross: T\u00e9a did nothing illegal. I made sure I kept her away from anything that might compromise her ethics.",
        "Blair: Well, that left you a whole lot of wiggle room, huh?",
        "Ross: I didn't want her hurt.",
        "Blair: And you're a saint. My God! Why did the two of you split up, then?",
        "Ross: Take a wild guess.",
        "Blair: Even after all that time?",
        "Ross: She still wanted Todd.",
        "Blair: Well, I guess that explains why she never mentioned you.",
        "Ross: Well, I guess she obviously left a few details out about her own life.",
        "Blair: Mm-him. Like the fact that she was married to you. God, I just love saying that.",
        "Ross: Yeah. We all have a few secrets.",
        "Blair: Yeah. And this one is about to jump up and bite T\u00e9a right in the ass.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not saying no.",
        "Todd: Then what are you saying?",
        "T\u00e9a: Just wait.",
        "Todd: For what? How much time is enough time? Sometimes you got to just jump in, man. Unless you don't love me.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know I love you.",
        "Todd: Okay, then. Why are you stalling?",
        "T\u00e9a: Why are you pushing? Huh? We have one great night...",
        "Todd: We had one insanely great night.",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe that's it: You're not thinking clearly. Now you're pushing, and...what are you afraid of, Todd?",
        "Todd: Nothing. You know what? Forget it. It's just a question. Answer it, don't answer it. I don't care.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look at you. One second you're asking me to marry you, the next second you're reading the paper?",
        "Todd: I ask you to marry me, and then you cross-examine me.",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you afraid of? I want to know. Tell me, Todd!",
        "Todd: I'm afraid of losing you. Because that's how I have lived. That's how I do things. I get a little--a little close to happiness and invariably something blows up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, I got blown up and I'm still here. Listen, I'm yours, Todd. I'm all yours. I love you. And you keep talking about a wedding. Why?",
        "Todd: Because--listen, don't you ever get tired of trying to figure out all the angles, trying to figure out the best play? I'm so sick of trying to win all the time. I just want to be happy for once.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know what you mean.",
        "Todd: Well, see? That's another thing. I know you know what I mean. I know that you understand me, and I understand you. We're perfect for each other. And, damn it, we're not gonna let anyone get in our way.",
        "T\u00e9a: You mean Blair?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Forget her. Forget her. She can't tear us apart no matter what she does.",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you talking about?",
        "Todd: Nothing. I'm just--no. She can't touch us, that's all.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is Blair up to something? Todd, you better tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mayor, you're at the desk working with your son.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Doing what?",
        "Dorian: I don't care. Anything at all: Stuffing envelopes. It doesn't matter. The point is to show you--and this'll work on many levels--diligently working for the public good. Your son supporting you, and you, of course, spending time with your...son. Everybody, we've got vandals in this place! How dare you! How did you get in here?! Security!",
        "Mayor Lowell: Dorian...",
        "Dorian: Look what they did!",
        "Mayor Lowell: Dorian, that's my son and his girlfriend.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Hmm. I see. How do you do, young man? Get out of here and get changed.",
        "Dorian: He'll, uh, photograph very well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Runyon: That is an outrageous charge.",
        "Bo: You heard it yourself, Judge. Lowell is clearly ID'd. That's his voice.",
        "Judge Runyon: It did sound like him.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm sorry. I know you two are friends.",
        "Judge Runyon: I wouldn't say that. We're colleagues, and he is an elected official.",
        "John: Who's dirty.",
        "Judge Runyon: I need more than an audiotape that is uncorroborated and obtained illegally.",
        "Nora: Your Honor, we're not seeking to use this recording as evidence.",
        "John: The drug shipment they're talking about never arrived last night. They stopped it.",
        "Judge Runyon: Or there never was a shipment planned. I gave you one month with Cole Thornhart undercover. Is this all you have to show for it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: The cops are just waiting for an excuse to lock me back up. I don't talk to them.",
        "Asher: We didn't mess with your shipment, Sergei.",
        "Cole: Look, we're the ones in trouble if you can't deliver. And maybe this is your screw-up, Sergei, or worse.",
        "Asher: Maybe you're working with the cops.",
        "Sergei: I don't need to work for the cops. They work for me.",
        "Cole: Bull. Who works for you?",
        "Sergei: Why do you need to know that?",
        "Cole: I wonder where they were when you almost got busted.",
        "Sergei: Your concern for me; it is so sweet.",
        "Cole: My only concern is that school has already started and I have nothing. All right, when's the next shipment?",
