        "Rachel: Go away, David.",
        "David: Oh, I get it. You're afraid of looking fat? So was I. Listen to me.",
        "[Rachel sighs]",
        "David: I had heard that the camera can put on 10 pounds, but then I did a little show called \"The Supermodel Crime Club.\" And when I saw the pilot, I couldn't stop looking at myself.",

        "Matthew: Hey, I thought you were coming with Greg.",
        "Destiny: He's late, again. But I took the bus to the end of the line and then I walked.",
        "Matthew: That's a really long walk.",
        "Destiny: It's no big deal.",
        "Matthew: I just thought maybe you had better things to do.",
        "Destiny: Like what?",
        "Matthew: I don't know--shop for school, hanging out at the mall. A lot of stuff.",
        "Destiny: You don't want me at the trial?",

        "John: Hey.",
        "Nora: Hi. You know, I offered this kid a very fair plea bargain. And any reasonable parent would have taken it. It was a fine and drug treatment. This kid is now being forced to go to court on possession charge. I mean, why? It doesn't make any sense.",
        "John: Hmm. He'll throw his son into the bus if it means bringing me down.",

        "Dorian: Oh, Mayor. Justin.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Dorian, has any of this fiasco been leaked to the press?",
        "Dorian: No, not yet, which means we still have time to put a positive spin on things.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Is there one?",
        "Dorian: Yes. You are a normal parent facing normal parental challenges. And that makes you relatable to the people.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Well, this is one challenge that needs to go away real fast.",
        "Justin: Maybe it will if we narc on the guy who sold me the drugs.",

        "Ross: You sure that's what you want? T\u00e9a being free so Todd can marry her?",
        "Blair: You bet. Oh, yeah. It's going to blow up right in her face. Once Todd finds out that he's marrying a bigamist, he is going to be done with T\u00e9a Delgado forever.",

        "Justin: Yeah, Dad.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Shut it. No, it won't. Because that would mean admitting that he bought the drugs in the first place.",
        "Dorian: Didn't John McBain catch him in the act?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Yes. But that should be my son's defense. It should also come in handy in bringing down McBain.",

        "Greg: Is that how you see me?",
        "David: Oh. This is good.",
        "Greg: Rachel, look, I'm not trying to start a fight. In fact, I'm still exhausted from our last workout.",
        "Rachel: Hmm. Yeah, David caught this on tape. And he wants to use it for his reality show. Fortunately, he can't, not without our consent.",
        "Greg: Hmm. Well, I signed mine.",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Greg: I signed the release form.",
        "David: Again, if you'll just sign here and initial--",

        "Greg: I don't have anything to be ashamed of. Apparently, you do.",

        "Ross: You know, you need to relax a little bit. Here on the island, we actually like to try and enjoy life.",
        "Blair: Don't tell me to lax. We got to cover our bases. T\u00e9a is a lawyer.",
        "Ross: Yeah, the papers look like the real deal. And they're not legally binding if they've never been filed.",
        "Blair: Okay, and she's going to sign them and think that she's getting a divorce, right? I mean, you're sure about--",
        "[Ross chuckles]",
        "Blair: What's so funny?",
        "Ross: I'm just--I don't understand how that guy deserves the love of such beautiful women. I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Ross: Oh, come on, Blair. You--you--you're here for Todd. I mean, isn't that the point of all this?",
        "Blair: But no, it isn't--this isn't about me.",
        "Ross: Yeah, yeah, you've said that a couple of times.",
        "Blair: No, this is about the fact that T\u00e9a is covering your marriage. Which means her relationship with Todd is based on a lie. Okay? And if she's capable of that, she's capable of anything. And now Todd has proposed to her. And my children have Todd as a father. Now they might have some con artist as a stepmom? Well, I don't want it.",
        "Ross: Right.",
        "Blair: Okay, what about you? You waiting for T\u00e9a to come back to you? Huh! Is that why you've held off on the divorce?",
        "Ross: I have my reasons. Plus--ahem--I know that T\u00e9a's not coming back to me. I know that for sure.",
        "Blair: Well, good. Because you're coming back to Llanview with me.",

        "Todd: That's some bling, huh?",

        "T\u00e9a: Wow.",
        "Todd: All right, let's hear it.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Todd: One word--\"I will marry you, Todd.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: That's not one word.",
        "Todd: Just say it. And then go downtown with me and get a judge and get it over with.",
        "T\u00e9a: Um--",
        "Todd: What are you doing?",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't wear your ring, Todd. And I can't possibly marry you today.",
        "Todd: What the hell do you mean, you won't marry me? Last night, you said you would.",
        "T\u00e9a: And I will.",
        "Todd: Okay, then.",
        "T\u00e9a: Just not today, Todd.",
        "Todd: What the hell's the matter with today? I mean, it's just as good as any other day as far as I'm concerned.",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't want a quickie wedding, okay? That's what the old Todd would have done. That's what the old Todd did do.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's not fair.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, it's totally fair. You know it's true. He would have thought, you know, \"Better seal the deal, nail her down before she changes her mind.\" Well, I'm not going to change my mind, Todd. What do you think of that? There is no need to rush this, Todd, okay? I like the time we've been taking with each other. It makes me feel special to you.",
        "Todd: You are special to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, that's what a wedding should do, too.",
        "Todd: I never thought of that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, now you know.",
        "Todd: I just figured you wouldn't need all that stuff. You're just remarrying the only husband you ever had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Pack your bag, surfer man. We're going to Llanview.",
        "Ross: No can do. Legal",
        "Blair: You're talking about the kidnapping charges? I told you I'd take care of that.",
        "Ross: Before we go?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Ross: No, thanks. Look, I love traveling, but my idea of fun is not getting cuffed and stopped at the airport. No, thank you.",
        "Blair: Listen, I brought those charges on you, I mean, so long ago, you're not even on anybody's radar. Just use one of your other fake I.D.s. I know you've got plenty. And when we land, I promise you, I'll take care of it.",
        "Ross: All right. So all that stuff between you and me in the past, with your kids, we're cool?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I mean, you're no longer a threat to my kids. And besides, you've been married to T\u00e9a for the last 6 years. I think you've served your sentence.",
        "Ross: All right, then.",
        "Blair: What do you mean, \"All right, then\"? Just like that?",
        "Ross: Yeah, yeah. I mean, look beautiful women, I'm easy.",
        "Blair: Oh, I thought it would be a little bit more difficult to convince you.",
        "Ross: It's not. Listen, I'm in. Plus, I--I want to see T\u00e9a in person. And with a little luck, I can squeeze a little more out of her. I cannot wait to see the look on her pretty little face when her not-so-ex-husband walks through the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: All right, pick a date, and I'll throw the biggest wedding Llanview's ever seen. Now put this ring back on.",
        "T\u00e9a: Not quite yet. You have to tell your children first about us.",
        "Todd: Oh, God, you're killing me here.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I'm serious. You don't want them to hear about it from anyone else, right? It should be from you.",
        "Todd: You're stalling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: So, are you nervous?",
        "Matthew: A little. I mean, what if your brother's testimony doesn't fly?",
        "Destiny: Dude, Greg's an expert. He'll get the judge to see why you need that surgery.",
        "Matthew: I hope so. I just want this to be over with.",
        "Destiny: The operation?",
        "Matthew: This whole trial. I hate that things are so weird between me and my parents.",

        "Destiny: Um--I'll get it.",
        "Shaun: Hey, Des. I didn't know you were here. What's going on?",

        "Greg: Yeah, but the rest is all me.",

        "Judge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nora: Thank you. This is the police report prepared by Lieutenant John McBain. The minor, Justin Lowell, was found in possession of a bag of marijuana. Enter it into evidence.",
        "Judge: Young man, you're being charged with possession of an illegal substance. How do you plead?",
        "Mayor Lowell: My son is not guilty.",
        "Judge: Mayor, with all due respect, the accused needs to enter his own plea.",
        "Justin: Not guilty.",
        "Judge: A plea of not guilty is accepted. The date and time for the defendant's appearance in juvenile court will be set. All that remains is one question-- will the accused minor be released into his father's custody, or will he be remanded to a juvenile facility while awaiting trial?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Your Honor, may I speak on behalf of my son?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Justin is still a child. He's not a criminal. He was set up, Your Honor, by a man with a grudge. Someone who has made no secret of his wish to destroy me. My son was framed by the man who arrested him--Lieutenant John McBain.",

        "Shaun: What is this?",
        "David: Outtakes from my reality show, Shaun.",
        "Rachel: Your reality is not like anyone else's. What you saw was me exercising yesterday and Greg barging in on me.",
        "Shaun: And you just happened to fall on top of him?",
        "Rachel: Well, I understand what--",
        "Greg: It's my fault. Look, I was just having a few laughs. I mean, nothing to worry about. Anyway, I'm due in court. I'll see you later.",
        "Rachel: Come on, you're not really upset about the stupid video, are you?",
        "Shaun: Should I be?",
        "David: Shaun, tell us how you really feel. Hey. Watch it. Celebrities get sued for that kind of thing.",
        "Rachel: Don't you have anything better to do?",
        "David: No.",

        "Rachel: Welcome to my world. As if there weren't enough drama around here, now the bastard's son is walking around with a damn video camera in everybody's face. Should I rewind so you can see what a big jerk your brother is? I mean it. It's madness 24/7. It's actually funny when you think about it.",
        "Shaun: Not to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Your Honor--Mayor Lowell, I would ask you to save your slanderous comments for your weekly press conference. Your Honor, we're here to arraign his son, not to impugn the reputation of the arresting officer.",
        "Judge: This is a hearing, Mayor. Your son's attorney can present his defense at trial. Until then, Justin is released into your custody. Court is adjourned.",
        "John: So, what do you think?",
        "Nora: He accused you of setting him up. And he's not going to back off with that.",
        "John: He's still got to sell it.",
        "Nora: You know? But the timing sucks here. You kind of swooped in and arrested the boy, within a half hour of the buy.",
        "John: And the tip had to come from somewhere.",

        "Mayor Lowell: No. You wait in the hallway. And don't talk to anyone.",
        "Dorian: It's hard to believe Cole selling your son drugs. Your son is so young.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Mayor Lowell: Let's deal with this one thing at a time.",
        "Dorian: I hardly understand your strategy, but I--for Starr's sake, I'm relieved that you're not going to be going after Cole publicly. John McBain is something else altogether. He's so well known. It's going to be right out there for all the public to know about.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Everyone says that John McBain is a man of few words, but he has had plenty to say about me. But setting up my son so it looks like he's buying drugs? Huh, that's a new low.",

        "Shaun: I don't think that he means anything bad by it. It's just the way that he is. You know, same thing with Matthew's surgery. It's just something else that he's got to win. But after that, he's on to the next thing. Greg's a good-looking man--sharp dresser, got the whole career thing going. Me? I'm not any of those things. Well, I do clean up good.",
        "Rachel: Very good.",
        "Shaun: I'm working something different than Greg. He's got the looks of my pops and the brains of my mom. But me, I've got the heart of both of them. I'm not a player, I'm straight up. I don't push people's buttons just to throw them off. And when you're with me, you are the only woman in the room. And that's the way that it should be.
