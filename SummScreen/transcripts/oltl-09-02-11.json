        "Rama tells Cristian she wants to help him find the love of his life. After brainstorming about his history of women, she concludes that maybe he should reconnect with his first love, Jessica Brennan. Meanwhile, Jessica talks to her father about whether or not he intends to get back with Kimberly. He tells her he wants her to find the right man and is relieved that she is no longer \"considering\" Robert Ford. Original Todd is still a suspect in the murder of Victor. But Vimal finds out about the murder and goes to see Brody, implying that he believes Brody did it until Brody persuades him not to give him up. Rex is also alone with a secret and a gun. Natalie is with her brother, ready to move in with Brody and be a family with him and baby Liam. She is suspicious of her father with Kim but Jessica tells Clint she sees nothing wrong with her father considering getting back with Kim. We also notice Aubrey and Cutter together both considering cleaning up their acts and getting back to the relationship they used to have. And we find out that Cutter knows Kimberly and that she is the real Aubrey Wentworth."

        "Kim: Good morning, girl. I'm back. Don't say I told you so. Llanview wasn't a total bust. I did get to see Clint, and everything was going so great until that redhead showed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey. Hey. I rang the bell.",
        "Rex: Sorry. I didn't hear it.",
        "Natalie: So you saw the news.",
        "Rex: You mean this? Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Well, that's it. The last of my luxury items. Hello, reality. I need a new life. Did you get the donuts?",
        "Cutter: Oh, I got the donuts. And a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: How about this one? She hearts art.",
        "Cristian: Digital art. Next.",
        "Rama: Ok, so then how about Erica. In Pine Valley?",
        "Cristian: She lives in Pine Valley.",
        "Rama: Loveless in Llanview?",
        "Cristian: Too desperate.",
        "Rama: Cristian, you're gonna here.",
        "Cristian: Well, I hope so. If there's a problem, don't you want me to find out now?",
        "Rama: I give up.",
        "Cristian: Rama, I didn't ask you to find me a date.",
        "Rama: I'm not trying to find you a date, Cristian. I'm trying to find you true love. I want you to be happy.",
        "Cristian: I am. I have a great job. I have my painting. I am truly happy.",
        "Rama: Without love, you have thing.",
        "Cristian: Thanks.",
        "Rama: It's true. I want you to be happy, Cristian. With my help, we can fill that void in your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Keep on reading the words, but they just won't sink in.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry, darling.",
        "Jessica: You don't have to pretend that you care.",
        "Clint: I care about you, no matter what I thought about Todd or Victor, whoever that man was. I know he mattered to you. Jess, what can we do for you?",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. Worry about Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: No. Todd has not called and there's no sign that he ever came home last night.",
        "John: Give me a call if he shows up?",
        "Viki: Yes, of course, I will.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Viki: John, wait, wait. Do you really think that Todd would do this? Just throw away his life when he just got it back?",
        "John: I don't really know the man.",
        "Viki: Let me tell you something. Todd may be a lot of things, but stupid is not one of them.",
        "John: How about impulsive? Prone to fits of rage? Is he capable of killing a man? I don't know. Tell you what, I'll keep you posted. And I'm sorry for your loss. Any word from the units?",
        "Brody: They've all reported in. No sign of our prime suspect-- Todd Manning.",
        "John: Who said he was our prime suspect?",
        "Viki: Oh, dear God, please don't let this be true. I can't lose both my brothers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: They haven't named a suspect.",
        "Clint: Maybe your sister knows a little more.",
        "Jessica: Sure. Why don't I call her?",
        "Clint: Never mind.",
        "Jessica: Actually, it'll be the biggest break that the murderer will get. They'll just put Natalie and Brody on the case. And they'll spend their whole time jumping on one another, claiming someone else made them do it.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry I brought it up. She moved out. Just leave it alone.",
        "Jessica: You're right. You're right. There is life after Natalie. For both of us.",
        "Clint: Well, I do not have a problem with your sister.",
        "Jessica: Really? Because I was here after she kicked Kim out, ok? And who is she to judge anyone, anyway? If you want a second chance with Kim, I say you go for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So David was the easiest part of the whole deal. Go figure. Clint was the one-- man, you should've seen him. He didn't look so hot. That whole transplant thing really took it out of him. Don't get me wrong, he still had his spark. I know you were never into the whole older guy thing, but believe me, it's there. I was about to tell him exactly how I feel, and then Natalie flew in on her broom and threw me out. But don't worry, we're just getting started. By the time I'm done, that little bitch will be calling me Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Geez, Rex.",
        "Rex: You want me to pretend I'm sorry?",
        "Natalie: No, but you don't have to celebrate the fact that he's dead.",
        "Rex: I'm not. But you have to admit that the world is a better place with Victor Lord, Jr. gone. Come on, I thought you hated the guy almost as much as I did.",
        "Natalie: Hate is a strong word. We had our differences. Just do me a favor and please don't go around repeating that the world is better off in front of other people.",
        "Rex: I'm sure there's other people who agree with me.",
        "Natalie: Not T\u00e9a, or his kids.",
        "Rex: You want me to feel sorry for the kid who got Gigi killed? Or the woman who helped him get away with it?",
        "Natalie: They lost a loved one, and you know exactly what that feels like.",
        "Rex: Right. Now they know what Shane and I have felt every minute since we lost Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: We put out an APB on Todd Manning, so I assumed he was our prime suspect.",
        "John: He's certainly one.",
        "Brody: Looking at someone else?",
        "John: I'm still putting it all together.",
        "Brody: Hard to find anybody with more motive. Todd threatened him, publicly.",
        "John: That's very true.",
        "Brody: Did we confirm he had the gun from La Boulaie?",
        "John: Blair thinks so, but she didn't see him take it. Who knows? Maybe he's got an explanation for that.",
        "Brody: Except he's on the wind. You always say the innocent don't run.",
        "John: Let's take everything I ever said and throw it out the window on this one...",
        "Brody: Yeah?",
        "John: Along with everything we thought we knew about Todd Manning. This guy's a stranger. We don't know what he's capable of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, thank God. I've been worried sick about you all night.",
        "Todd: Did I miss my curfew?",
        "Viki: No. It was a rough night. I don't think any of us would've slept anyway.",
        "Todd: Full moon.",
        "Viki: Todd, I have really bad news about Victor. He's dead.",
        "Todd: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: That's a new look.",
        "Cutter: Comes with the job.",
        "Aubrey: You keep saying that word.",
        "Cutter: I'm the new front desk clerk. They had an opening, I applied, and the uniform fit. What?",
        "Aubrey: You never worked a day in your life.",
        "Cutter: You're right. Why start now?",
        "Aubrey: No, I'm sorry. No, it's a great idea, it's just a little drastic.",
        "Cutter: If you want me to change, I need to start here.",
        "Aubrey: You want to change?",
        "Cutter: Yeah. For you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: We never finished our talk about Kim.",
        "Clint: No, I guess we didn't.",
        "Jessica: Come on. You can tell me.",
        "Clint: You know the story. You heard yourself.",
        "Jessica: I wasn't here when she first got here. What was it like seeing her again?",
        "Clint: We did a little catching up.",
        "Jessica: Come on, Dad. You can tell me.",
        "Clint: I don't know what you're looking for, but--",
        "Jessica: how did it feel? You know, seeing her again. Did you want to, you know-- were you excited or did you want to kick her out?",
        "Clint: Maybe a little bit of both.",
        "Jessica: Did she say why she came back?",
        "Clint: She said a lot of things.",
        "Jessica: Like? Ok, fine. Tell me this. If Kim said that she wanted you back, would you take her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I know, you're sick of hearing about Clint. There's more news, but it's kind of weird. Ok, it's very weird, but you should know. It's Rex. He's kind of lost it. He dug up Gigi's grave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So did they make an arrest?",
        "Natalie: Not yet.",
        "Rex: You have any clues?",
        "Natalie: Still waiting on Forensics.",
        "Rex: You look beat.",
        "Natalie: Came straight from work, Rex. I am worried about you.",
        "Rex: I'm fine. Really. Worry about yourself. You work too much.",
        "Natalie: Yes, I know. That's how I knew about the order of exhumation.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I should've warned you.",
        "Natalie: Rex, why did you have Gigi's body exhumed? Did you really think she wasn't gonna be there?",
        "Rex: But she was.",
        "Natalie: You saw her?",
        "Rex: Yeah. Now I know Gigi's dead.",
        "Natalie: Hey... you still seeing her?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Natalie: And what about everything else--the gravestone being trashed?",
        "Rex: Must've been some kids playing a prank.",
        "Natalie: Delphina? What she said?",
        "Rex: I know that you and Roxy like her, but that \"woman\" needs to get her radar checked.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you got a good point there. She did send us on a wild goose chase to Kentucky.",
        "Rex: I was supposed to find Gigi--not Kim Andrews.",
        "Natalie: And we led Kim straight back to Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So first this pasty gravedigger tells me that Gigi's grave's been vandalized, that the date of her death had been scratched off her headstone. Creepy, right? And then Rex shows up with Clint's brother and a bunch of guys and they start digging Gigi up. I guess it's legal, but it shouldn't be. They opened the casket right there on the ground. Rex was going totally nuts. I was actually kind of worried about him. It's like he didn't think Gigi would be in there. But that's crazy, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: It's my beautiful wife and Llanview's best arms.",
        "Cristian: You can call me Cris.",
        "Vimal: I could.",
        "Rama: Good morning, my love.",
        "Vimal: You can still say that to me?",
        "Rama: Of course.",
        "Cristian: Rama was trying to play matchmaker for me.",
        "Vimal: Ah. I would think that would be easy.",
        "Rama: No. He's too picky. And close-minded. Why aren't you at work?",
        "Vimal: Nobody at \"The Sun\" is working today.",
        "Rama: Is it another American holiday?",
        "Vimal: No. It's an official day of mourning. You haven't heard? Victor Lord was murdered last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Bottom line, we don't know what happened in that house last night.",
        "Brody: We should have Forensics soon.",
        "John: We don't even know what kind of gun killed Victor. The bullet doesn't match the gun taken from Dorian Lord's house--",
        "Brody: Want me to push the M.E.?",
        "John: I think they're working as fast as they can. Go ahead and focus on Victor.",
        "Brody: Anything in particular?",
        "John: Start with his enemies and work backwards. I'm guessing Manning wasn't even the only one to threaten him this week.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: How do you know Victor's dead?",
        "Todd: I saw a guy picking up after his dog with that. Front page? Really? Front page.",
        "Viki: He was our brother and he was an important--",
        "Todd: He was a jackass. There's really nothing else in the world that's newsworthy?",
        "Viki: You read the news this morning, and that's the first you heard of it?",
        "Todd: It's not like I have a police scanner anymore. What?",
        "Viki: You really didn't know?",
        "Todd: Victor and I weren't close. It's not like we had that otherworldly twin thing, you know, where you cut one of us and the other one bleeds. I only knew the man well enough to hate him. You think I killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: You're working at the front desk of this fleabag motel...for me?",
        "Cutter: What did you say to me, Aubrey? You said you didn't want to scam Rex Balsom. You were through running cons. You wanted to leave me.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, but I didn't.",
        "Cutter: Because you didn't have the cash yet. Look. I already lost you once. I'm not gonna do it again. You want me to change, I'll change. For you.",
        "Aubrey: I don't know what to say.",
        "Cutter: Say you're still into it. Say you're willing to go back to the beginning. Just Cutter and Christine.",
        "Aubrey: Whoever they are.",
        "Cutter: Find out with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: What does this mean for your job?",
        "Vimal: Rama, a man is dead.",
        "Rama: He was a tyrant who only paid you a fraction of what you are worth.",
        "Vimal: Victor Lord saved me. He gave me a job.",
        "Rama: For his own reasons. He used people and treated them with contempt. No one cared much for him, not even his own family.",
        "Vimal: Rama!",
        "Rama: Do you think one of them killed him?",
        "Vimal: Please.",
        "Rama: Well, someone did. So many people had reasons to want him dead. Vimal?",
        "Vimal: I have to go.",
        "Rama: What's wrong?",
        "Vimal: I left the iron on.",
        "Cristian: What was that about?",
        "Rama: I don't know. But he's lying. We don't have an iron. I send everything to the cleaners.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Am I the only one on this?",
        "John: No. We're all in on this case until it breaks. Take anyone you need from the squad to help you.",
        "Brody: I can handle it.",
        "John: There's gonna be other suspects. We'll find them. It's just a matter of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I should call Blair. She and Todd--Victor-- they went through a lot, but she did care about him.",
        "Rama: Like you care about her?",
        "Cristian: Not the same.",
        "Rama: If I remember correctly, according to your \"Access Llanview\" profile, you and Blair were once an item.",
        "Cristian: Blair and I were never serious.",
        "Rama: But there was a spark, right? Perhaps with a little fanning there could be a flame?",
        "Cristian: I don't think Blair's in the mood for fanning right now, and I wouldn't risk our friendship anyway.",
        "Rama: Sometimes that's the best kind. You two are comfortable with each other.",
        "Cristian: Look, Rama, I appreciate the thought, but why don't we drop it?",
        "Rama: Drop what? Your life? Romance?",
        "Cristian: I'm not on the market.",
        "Rama: Listen, Cristian, why don't you just go out with one of these girls, give them a chance, for fun?",
        "Cristian: I'm not gonna find a woman online.",
        "Rama: Ok. Ok. So how about someone from your past? I've heard all these stories.",
        "Cristian: What stories?",
        "Rama: Old lovers, they reconnect. Maybe you already know your true love.",
        "Cristian: What are you doing?",
        "Rama: Let's go backwards. Ok. How about Layla?",
        "Cristian: She left me for another man. No way.",
        "Rama: Ok, ok. Not Layla. Then... who before Layla?",
        "Cristian: Sarah. She lives on the road. She's touring with a band. Rock band.",
        "Rama: Vanessa Montez.",
        "Cristian: She got deported.",
        "Rama: Roseanne?",
        "Cristian: All this is in my \"Access Llanview\" profile?",
        "Rama: Of course. It was fascinating. Roseanne. How about Roseanne?",
        "Cristian: Roseanne married a country-western singer.",
        "Rama: Jessica?",
        "Cristian: Jess--",
        "Rama: Jessica Brennan. Now we're getting somewhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So if Kim said that she wanted to pick up where she left off, would you...",
        "Clint: Would I ask her to say here with you and me and your mother? Are you truly asking me this?",
        "Jessica: Would you want to be with her?",
        "Clint: I am under house arrest, and I am lucky to be alive. That's all I think about these days. That and what's going on with you and Robert Ford.",
        "Jessica: There's nothing going on.",
        "Clint: That's not the way it sounded.",
        "Jessica: Natalie's shot yesterday? She's just trying to stir the pot, ok? Actually, Ford and I decided not to see each other anymore.",
        "Clint: But you were seeing each other?",
        "Jessica: No, Dad, not like that. When he comes to pick up Ryder, we see each other, and... we both love our son. There was a moment.",
        "Clint: Really? What kind of moment?",
        "Jessica: We kissed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So Kim's back in Llanview?",
        "Natalie: No, thanks. Yeah, yeah, that skank beat a trail to Dad's door the minute she found out he was sick.",
        "Rex: She saw Clint.",
        "Natalie: Oh! Yes, I found her all over him. I don't know what she thinks she's gonna get out of it. I mean, he's broke.",
        "Rex: Maybe she doesn't want anything. It's possible.",
        "Natalie: Please. I kicked her trashy butt right out the door.",
        "Rex: That's just gonna make Clint want her even more.",
        "Natalie: Ok, please, I really don't want to hear about the two of them together.",
        "Rex: I'm just saying you might be better off leaving them alone. Either Clint catches on to her or she moves on because he's broke.",
        "Natalie: Or she finds some new way to ruin my family. Trust me. That girl can do no good.",
        "Rex: Don't I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Do you believe it? Rex acted like Gigi was alive. But that's nuts, isn't it? So the casket is open and Gigi is in it, like, duh, right? Rex is losing it and then his kid shows up. It was a total freak show. Anyways, enough tales from her crypt. I have something that'll make you feel much better. Check out our girl Sierra Rose. A year and change already. Can you believe it? She's walking and talking. I surprised Kyle and Fish so they couldn't pretend they weren't at home. Look at that outfit. I was a little worried, but not bad, huh? She seems happy, but not as happy as she could be. So you gotta get better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You think I killed Victor?",
        "Viki: No, I didn't say that.",
        "Todd: The only person in the world who has more enemies than me, and you think I killed him.",
        "Viki: No! The police are looking for you. They want you for questioning.",
        "Todd: Me and everyone else in this town.",
        "Viki: Todd, they put out an APB on you. They think you took a gun.",
        "Todd: A gun?",
        "Viki: From the safe at La Boulaie.",
        "Todd: Why would they think that?",
        "Viki: I don't know.",
        "Todd: Who would tell-- why would Blair say that?",
        "Viki: Is it true?",
        "Todd: I guess you don't see someone for 8 years, they can change how they feel, right? Out of sight...",
        "Viki: You have not answered my question.",
        "Todd: A guy steals my whole life and everybody's just fine with it.",
        "Viki: Did you take the gun from the safe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: Tell me straight away, Officer.",
        "Brody: What are you doing here?",
        "Vimal: Victor Lord, Jr. was murdered.",
        "Brody: We heard. And I'm busy with the investigation, so--",
        "Vimal: Who else knew the truth about Liam?",
        "Brody: You want a megaphone?",
        "Vimal: Dr. Saybrooke, me, and Mr. Lord. Dr. Saybrooke can never come back to Llanview. Me, I swore to keep your secret safe. So we're no threat, but Mr. Lord was.",
        "Brody: You need to leave and let me do my job.",
        "Vimal: Not until you look me in n the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Victor Lord?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Rex, I did not come here to talk about Kim.",
        "Rex: Ok. Natty, she bugs you. I get that. But she's not a threat. You could take her in your sleep.",
        "Natalie: We're not talking about me.",
        "Rex: Well, if you think Kim turns Clint into a moron, just keep an eye on him.",
        "Natalie: I can't. I don't live there anymore.",
        "Rex: You moved out of Llanfair? Why?",
        "Natalie: It was time. And Jessica's making life way too dramatic.",
        "Rex: Where are you going?",
        "Natalie: Brody and Liam and I got our own place. Rex. Wow. That's big.",
        "Natalie: I know. It's what families do.",

        "Todd: I don't believe you buy that.",

        "Todd: He was a tool who was manipulated by an evil and insane mother. That's if you buy that. My own personal belief is that he knew exactly what he was doing. He was a fraud, and he didn't give a damn about any one of you.",
        "Viki: No, that's just not true.",
        "Todd: Ok, let me ask you something, Viki. Did Victor ever stand up for you? Did he ever protect your children? Was he ever a brother to you? The world's better off without that parasite, don't you think? What are you doing?",

And what about the first moment you both confessed your true feelings for each other? Not many people have the chance to recapture all this. These are sweet treasures. You have that chance.",

        "Jessica: What hasn't this year? Relax, Dad. I'm kidding.",
        "Clint: I know you are. But it's still the truth. That's why I'd hate to see you get involved with some guy who's already proved that he can't be trusted. You deserve so much better, honey. You deserve a man who loves you and the kids like the treasures you are.",
