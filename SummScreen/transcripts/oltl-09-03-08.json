        "Tina: So what is this place perfect for?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Where did you come from?",
        "Tina: I was following David Vickers to make sure he didn't get in trouble.",
        "Tess: Too late.",
        "Tina: So, where did you get all this stuff? And what are you going to use it for?",
        "Tess: Get out.",
        "Leo: Yes, ma'am. And good luck with everything.",
        "Tina: Are you angry with me?",
        "Tess: Yeah, yeah, I am.",
        "Tina: Yeah, well you know this is my home, too. And I really do not appreciate having all the doors locked. So I'm sorry if that bugs you --",
        "Tess: You know what bugs me? You've ruined the surprise.",
        "Tina: Surprise for who?",
        "Tess: For you, Aunt Tina.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendy: I've been a childbirth educator for eight years, and it is the most rewarding job in the world, next to parenthood, of course. The act of bringing life into this world is sacred. And I so look forward to sharing this experience with you mothers, partners, and your families.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I didn't come here to see Starr. I told you that.",
        "Langston: Uh, I know. That you never wanted to see or speak to her again. I got it. So my question is, why did you come here to her house at a time where she's almost always home?",
        "Cole: Our friendship means a lot to me.",
        "Langston: It means a lot to me, too. Which is why I hate to see you doing this to yourself. You love Starr. Starr loves you. You can lie to yourself, dude, but don't lie to me.",
        "Cole: Okay, all right. You're right. A big part of the reason why I came here is I was hoping to see Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendy: Giving birth is not a medical event. It's a natural, normal part of life. Coaches, you're here to keep reminding your partners millions of women before you have done this. You can do it, too. Childbirth education serves to empower you, to give you confidence to trust your inner wisdom. Your body knows exactly what to do. The pain of your first contraction will be all but forgotten by the time your baby crowns and you proudly push him or her out into the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thanks for doing this, Fish.",
        "Oliver: I haven't done anything yet, Sir. This image is pretty degraded. I'm not even sure if this woman's face is going to be visible once it's enhanced. Is it okay if I pop the DVD in my laptop?",
        "John: You got it.",
        "Oliver: So is she a perp or a vic? Don't know?",
        "John: All I know is I need to get an I.D. on her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: God.",
        "Janet: Stumped?",
        "Marty: Uh, you know -- okay. Star of \"The Fugitive,\" Tommy Lee blank. Huh? Got so many blanks in my own life, and yet this I know. I get a clue like this, I know it right away. Tommy Lee Jones. I don't know why I know. I don't know who I went to the movie with. Here's another one. Scheme. So far I have ruse, plan, plot, and ploy.",
        "Janet: Ooh, pretty good.",
        "Marty: Thank you. But why do I know so much and so little at the same time?",
        "Janet: Well, let's try this. How about a four-letter word for evildoer and a little physical therapy?",
        "Marty: No, how about we go for something a little more practical?",
        "Janet: Such as?",
        "Marty: Um, the art of changing a diaper while in a prone position.",
        "Janet: Marty, how close have you and Todd gotten?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: A surprise for moi?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Oui. Pour toi.",
        "Tina: Oh! Well, I love surprises, but I hate suspense, so please tell me what it is.",
        "Tess: Okay. This, Aunt Tina.",
        "Tina: This -- um, this room?",
        "Tess: Yeah, I made it especially for you and little David Vickers.",
        "Tina: Uh, how -- how nice, I -- I think. Um, what made you think we needed a room in the basement?",
        "Tess: Well, you know when you first came here, I don't know if you noticed, I was -- well, I was a little bit rude to you.",
        "Tina: Yeah, you think?",
        "Tess: Yeah, and I can be a little --",
        "Tina: Bitchy and mean?",
        "Tess: Mm.",
        "Tina: You know, a nice \"I'm sorry\" would have gone a long way.",
        "Tess: But that wouldn't have solved our problem.",
        "Tina: What problem?",
        "Tess: Well, the problem of me needing my privacy and you sometimes getting on my nerves. As, I'm sure, I can get on yours. And this will give us both space.",
        "Tina: I'm sorry. Uh, are you saying you want me to live down here?",
        "Tess: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Oliver typing]",
        "Oliver: Thanks for dinner.",
        "John: Unfortunately, it will all be duly noted on your paycheck.",
        "[Oliver laughs]",
        "Oliver: Sugar and caffeine -- fuel of champions.",
        "John: I'll tell you what; I'm cutting you off until you start getting me somewhere.",
        "Oliver: All right, well I got it denoised. Now I just have to deblur, mosaic, reconstruct, adjust intensity, highlight features, fuse frames, and pray that it works.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Marty laughs]",
        "Marty: You're joking, right?",
        "Janet: Well, I hope I am, and I hope you are, too.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God, I'm not pregnant if that's what you're thinking.",
        "Janet: Are you sure?",
        "Marty: Yes, I'm sure.",
        "Janet: Then why did you ask me about learning to change diapers?",
        "Marty: Okay. No -- okay. I don't think Todd would mind. He told me something tonight, and -- well, you're going to find out soon enough.",
        "Janet: Marty, I'm on his payroll, but he does not tell me his deepest, darkest secrets.",
        "Marty: Yes, but you do know that his daughter is pregnant.",
        "Janet: Yes.",
        "Marty: Okay, the adoptive family that she picked out didn't work out. So she's decided to give her baby to her dad to raise instead.",
        "Janet: She has?",
        "Marty: Yeah, and she's due in a couple of months, so apparently there's going to be a little one here by thanksgiving. Isn't that great?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendy: In this week's class, we're going to talk about six practices that support and promote normal childbirth. Excuse me, may I help you?",
        "Todd: No, you may not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Todd is going to raise a child? Alone?",
        "Marty: No, no. He told me he knows he can't do it alone.",
        "Janet: Oh -- oh, oh, wonderful. So now I'm going to be a baby nurse as well?",
        "Marty: No, he doesn't expect you to do two jobs. Actually, he's asked me if I would help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendy: Are you here as a birthing coach to someone in the class?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: I'm sorry about this interruption. This is Starr's father.",
        "Starr: Dad, what are you doing here?",
        "Todd: Well, I want to talk to you.",
        "Blair: Look, I made the mistake of telling your father about this appointment today. Sorry. There is a restraining order against this man, so if you want to call security, please feel --",
        "Todd: No, there's no need to call security, uh, Wendy. I'm just going to say my piece here and I will go, in peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I really don't know what to do about Starr. But Nora thinks I should start making plans now that I'm going into senior year.",
        "Langston: Okay?",
        "Cole: And do you want to know what plans I've made so far? To abandon my kid and go as far away from this place as possible. At this time next year, nobody's going to remember me.",
        "Langston: Oh, that's not true.",
        "Cole: I don't have anyone here, Langston.",
        "Langston: You have me and Markko. And you have Starr.",
        "Cole: Not anymore.",
        "Langston: Okay, well whose fault is that?",
        "Cole: I'm the one that broke up with her, all right? So why am I torturing both of us? Why can't I just let her go?",
        "Langston: Because you still love her? And you know what? I don't think that Starr feels like seeing you would be torture. You're all she thinks about.",
        "Cole: Yeah, that's not healthy.",
        "Langston: Oh, no kidding. But she's got your kid kicking inside of her day and night, and her family is a wreck, and she's freaked out about waddling into school, hearing all the trash talk, not to mention the fact that she has to go into labor, push the kid out, and then, oh, yeah, give it up. So what's she supposed to do besides think about the one thing that has kept her happy for like the past two years?",
        "Cole: We can't go back to the way it was before. Not after she gave the baby away. She made her decision and now I've made mine.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but --",
        "Cole: You don't think she's having second thoughts, do you?",
        "Langston: No. So do you want me tell her that you were here?",
        "Cole: I guess I also came over here because I was feeling guilty.",
        "Langston: About what?",
        "Cole: Well, I ran into Starr at the country club the other day. And when I saw her, it just -- it just drove me crazy, and I did something dumb.",
        "Langston: How dumb?",
        "Cole: I can just hear my mom right now. She would be really disappointed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You are making such good progress, Marty. And -- but you're still pretty much confined to bed. Todd is here with a nurse in residence and all the money he needs to hire whoever he wants to take care of this baby. So why do you think he's asking you?",
        "Marty: Well, maybe he thought it would be good therapy. Get me connected to the world again. And he knows that I understand what it's like not to have a family.",
        "Janet: Mm, yes, I've heard the rumors about him and his wife.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm, she cut him off from his children. Janet, if you'd seen his face when he talked about bringing his grandchild here. If there's anything I can do to help that --",
        "Janet: Marty, have you agreed to this already?",
        "Marty: No, no. Not yet. Because I don't know the first thing about being a mother. I mean, but Todd said --",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Marty: Well, he said that taking care of me is what began to turn his life around.",
        "Janet: So that's what got to you.",
        "Marty: Actually, what got to me was that he said he thought I would be a good mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Cole, what did you do?",
        "Cole: I ran into Starr at the country club. She was having lunch with her mom and Marcie, and we got into again about her giving the baby away. And then Karen and her crew show up, and Karen figures out that Starr is pregnant, and she starts saying stuff.",
        "Langston: Karen's such a bitch.",
        "Cole: Yeah, yeah she is, and Starr was pretty upset.",
        "Langston: So what happened?",
        "Cole: Well, Karen and her group went to the pool. And Starr said that she could tell that I'd rather be with them than her. And I didn't -- I didn't know what to say. So I went swimming with Karen.",
        "Langston: You what? That's like giving Karen a pass for what she said.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I know. And I sort of came on to her, too.",
        "Langston: Tell me you did not hook up with her.",
        "Cole: No, no, I didn't, all right? I was just trying to think of something besides Starr, that's all.",
        "Langston: Oh, Karen and her teeny bikini, there's a distraction.",
        "Cole: I'm sorry. I feel guilty, all right?",
        "Langston: And you should. Karen just trashed the girl that you love and not only were you okay with it, but you were a little turned on, as well? I mean, does that help you stop thinking about Starr? Do you feel better now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There is no need to call security. I'll be done before they get here, anyway. I didn't come to make any trouble.",
        "Blair: But you always do, Todd.",
        "Todd: I just want to say one thing.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] What's wrong? It's a beautiful room. I mean, come on. Look around. You can't even tell it's a basement.",
        "Tina: Yeah, but it's in the basement.",
        "Tess: I know, but the kitchen is just one flight of stairs away. And think of all the privacy you and David Vickers will have.",
        "Tina: Yeah, but that door outside has shelves on it.",
        "Tess: Oh, yeah. That's a secret door. Isn't it great?",
        "[Tina laughs]",
        "Tina: Yeah, and this wall here is, um, glass.",
        "Tess: Oh --",
        "Tina: So how much privacy could there be?",
        "Tess: That's the latest design trend. And it's in all the magazines.",
        "Tina: Wow, you know I must have missed that one.",
        "Tess: You know, Tina, I'm a little disappointed. I put a lot of work into this room, and I thought that you would like it. I mean, think of all the privacy you'll have. With David Vickers, he can bark, run around. You know, pee on things. And you can have visitors come here, and nobody will know the difference. It's kind of like a peace offering to you.",
        "Tina: Oh, yeah, and you know, it's not -- well, I appreciate it. I really do. But I have a great idea. Oh, since you like it so much, why don't you move in here?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Well, obviously I can't live here. I have a small child.",
        "Tina: Yeah. Well, clearly the basement isn't fit for anyone to live in. And you know, you may not realize this, but your grandfather had a secret room down here. It's -- it's where he took Viki when --",
        "Tess: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard. That was demolished ages ago.",
        "Tina: Yeah, well, there's more. I mean, when your mother -- when she lost touch with reality, and then she had --",
        "Tess: D.I.D? It's okay, you can say it.",
        "Tina: Yeah, well she built a whole other room down here, right where this room is.",
        "Tess: Really?",
        "Tina: Yeah. It's the room where she kept Dorian Lord locked up.",
        "Tess: Wow. I hadn't heard about that.",
        "Tina: And you know, it's interesting because she had a glass wall in that room, too, just so Viki -- so she could watch Dorian suffer.",
        "Tess: Wow. I can't believe my mother did those things.",
        "Tina: Yeah. Yeah, it's like she was a whole other -- person. Just like you. Your mother told me all about you. You're Tess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Right, I can get rid of the hair on her face, extrapolate her features. I don't suppose you've got anything else for me to go on?",
        "John: Yeah, I do. These are her, too.",
        "Oliver: Wow, thank you. That, um -- ooh, that helps. I took a class in video and medical forensics, you know. This woman's got a fractured skull, probably T.B.I. That's traumatic brain injury. Let's see, spinal injuries, too. Are you sure this woman's still alive?",
        "John: Does she look alive?",
        "Oliver: Well, we can't even tell that much yet. Your brother's a surgeon, isn't he? What did he have to say about these?",
        "John: You just corroborated his diagnosis. Spinal injuries with severe brain trauma.",
        "Oliver: That's all he could tell you?",
        "John: He said if she did have cognitive function, she may not remember much, if anything, of her old life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: May I say something?",
        "Marty: Sure.",
        "Janet: I know that you're really grateful to Mr. Manning. But please do not let that be the reason that you do this for him.",
        "Marty: But why shouldn't I?",
        "Janet: Well, because -- I shouldn't say anything, but you're going to have your own life to get back to some time.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I hope.",
        "Janet: Oh, so do you really think you want to make this kind of commitment? Do you really think you can serve as a mother to Todd's grandchild and then vanish from his life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Well, it obviously didn't work. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. And you're right, Karen's a bitch.",
        "Langston: That's funny. That's what she would say about Starr and me.",
        "Cole: There's no way I could be friends with her.",
        "Langston: Oh, so instead you just came on to her. How big of a dog are you?",
        "Cole: You know, the two minutes that I spent with her, I felt lonelier than I do when I'm alone. Do you know what I mean? It's like how I feel when I go and visit my mom's gravesite. And for the ten thousandth time I think to myself, I'm never, ever going to see her again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You are going to get your life back. I mean, look how far you've come, how much better you're getting every day. I mean, from a medical standpoint, you know, you should have died from your injuries. You're really inspiring, Marty. I hope you know that.",
        "Marty: Well, thank you. And not just for the encouragement. Thank you for making it happen. You and Todd.",
        "Janet: And Lee Ramsey, too. I don't know if you'd be here if it weren't for him.",
        "Marty: I know. No, my life as I know it started when he pulled me from that van before it blew up. Gosh, I owe him so much. I'll never forget him. I'm still so devastated by what happened to him. But I never felt that kind of personal connection with Lee. I mean, he tried. He was just a little more reserved. You know, with Todd, it's just different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What exactly are you sorry for this time, Todd?",
        "Todd: Everything.",
        "Wendy: Okay, people, why don't we take a five?",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm sorry. It's going to take a hell of a lot longer than five minutes for this man to go through everything that he's sorry for.",
        "Starr: Look, Mom --",
        "Todd: Okay, I'll just keep this short and sweet. When I lost Sam today, it really --",
        "Starr: Wait, the hearing was today?",
        "Todd: Yeah, didn't she tell you?",
        "Starr: Mom, you got Sam? No, I -- I'm sorry, I would have been there.",
        "Blair: I know. I just -- sweetheart, I did not want you to worry that we could lose Sam again.",
        "Todd: Marcie, you remember what I told you and Michael would happen if I lost Sam?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I remember. You said that you would kill us.",
        "Todd: Right. That's because I blamed you for everything. Well, now I blame myself for everything. I didn't do the things that I should have that would have proved that I deserve Sam. And maybe I just don't deserve him.",
        "Blair: Starr, the judge asked your father to do two things. One was to go to anger management counseling. The second was to cooperate with Child Services. But has he done any of those? No. Then you show up here and you want to say you're sorry? That suddenly you're better? Todd, nothing changes, does it?",
        "Todd: That was before.",
        "Blair: Before what? What lightning bolt came down and made you a better man? I mean, when my love and our children's love couldn't change you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Marty, you're really serious about this, aren't you? You think you have found yourself a new family. You and Todd and that grandchild.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: After I left the courtroom this morning, I went to see a shrink.",
        "[Blair scoffs]",
        "Todd: Yes, I know it's hard for you to believe, but I did. And she helped me to understand a couple of things.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Todd: Yes. I was really counting on getting Sam back today. Um, because he's mine, you know. He's my flesh and blood. He's not yours, Marcie, and you obviously never wanted him. He's really all I've been thinking about lately, or actually for the past year. And he's the reason for everything I've done. But this doctor helped me to realize that a child's not a piece of property. He -- he needs to be loved and appreciated, and it's whoever loves and appreciates him the most who deserves to have him. And it seems to me that I just hurt everything that's in my life, you know? So I thought maybe the best thing to do for this child is to save him from me.",
        "Starr: Okay, but, Dad --",
        "Todd: No, no, no.",
        "Starr: Don't say that.",
        "Todd: No, it's okay. I appreciate it. I love you so much. You know that, short man. You're such a great kid. And now you're having a baby, and that's probably my fault, too. I think it is. You know, you're sixteen though, and you're so mature. You're doing what you think is best for this baby and for yourself. Which is more than I ever did for you, certainly. And not that Marcie would be my first choice to raise my flesh and blood, but Sam turned out okay. Actually, to tell you the truth, he turned out more than okay. And I'm thoroughly certain that Marcie would be an excellent mother to my grandchild.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: No, as far as I'm concerned, Todd's the only family I've got.",
        "Janet: Hmm. Well, I know he pays the bills, but, boy, I'm pretty devoted to you.",
        "Marty: No, no, you, you. Of course, you. You know how grateful I am. But when John McBain came after me, I mean, Todd -- he lied to the police. He could have been arrested. All he cared about was protecting me. I still don't know how he pulled it off.",
        "Janet: I do. Guess who Lieutenant McBain found in that bed instead of you?",
        "Marty: You?",
        "Janet: Mm-hmm. Marty, I -- I need to ask you something, and it's not to pry, but --",
        "Marty: But you want to know why you walked in and Todd was sleeping here, right?",
        "Janet: Yes.",
        "Marty: Nothing happened. Don't worry.",
        "Janet: But did you want it to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You know I'm a fact-oriented guy.",
        "John: Oh, I know, Fish.",
        "Oliver: But forensics is kind of an art.",
        "John: No kidding.",
        "Oliver: You may piece stuff together from here and there, you make educated guesses --",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Oliver: And I know that you want to keep this under wraps, and if you don't trust me, I totally understand. But it would really help if you told me whatever else you know. Do you have any idea who this woman could be? Just between you and me and the computer.",

        "Marty: Todd's ex-wife really hurt him. I don't think he's ready to start a relationship with anyone else.",
        "Janet: I didn't ask what he wanted. I asked what you wanted.",
        "Marty: I want to be able to stand up and walk out of this room. How's that for a goal?",
        "Janet: Oh, well. Oh, that's what I want, too, and I think that's what Todd wants.",
        "Marty: You think?",
        "Janet: Marty, look, I know he's been wonderful to you. He's been a good boss to me. And -- look, I don't understand Mr. Manning very well, but there is one thing I do know, and I think you know it, too. He's -- how do I say this? It seems he has a crush on you.",
        "Marty: Oh, come -- really?",
        "Janet: Really?",
        "Marty: Oh, I don't know. Maybe -- ahem. Whatever instinct I had for that's gone, too. He does everything for me. I'm grateful, I'm --",
        "Janet: You're smitten.",
        "Marty: Well, I don't know. He's attractive. There's something about that broken, sad thing he does --",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Marty: Makes me want to reach out to him, I don't know. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm just reacting to how he's treating me, right?",
        "Janet: Oh, no, no. You know, I don't think you're reacting. Okay, objectively, I have to say -- he's a really sexy man.",

        "Blair: Well, Todd, you were right about one thing. Marcie will be an excellent mother to Starr's baby. Even though he does not mean a word that he is saying. You know, what angle are you trying to make here, Todd? What are you going for here?",
        "Todd: There's no angle. You know, even you can tell when I'm being honest, right?",
        "Blair: Why now?",
        "Todd: Because I realize now that -- that I have lost everything I cared for. Starting with you. Now a judge has ordered me to clean up my act. He gave me a year, and I've got a lot to work on, right?",
        "Blair: Well, see, I think you've got your act down pretty good right now.",
        "Todd: I'm trying here, okay? I really am. Can you cut me some slack? You know, I really don't care about you and me anymore. I don't. But I love my children. Starr, the last thing I want to do is make your life any harder than it is right now. So if you feel like giving your baby to Marcie is the best thing for the baby, for yourself, even if it's to punish me, I'm not going to fight you on it, okay?",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Todd: All right. That's all I have to say. Sorry. Take care of yourself and the baby. See you.",

        "Tina: Yeah, that's -- that's a great idea. Okay, why don't we go upstairs, and we can have a little snack and work out our problems?",

        "Tina: Jessica, what hap -- I mean, Tess, what happened? I mean, I know your husband died. Did you just snap?",
        "Tess: Okay, shut up. Just shut the hell up! Oh, my God. I told you not to come down in the basement, didn't I? Didn't I?",

        "Marty: Yes, good, thank you.",

        "Blair: Starr, come on.",
        "Starr: Okay, look. I know you think that I got sucked into it again. But like I don't know that dad lies about half of the things he says? But what I truly know is that he loves us, and he knows that if he doesn't change, then that's it, right?",
        "Blair: Well, we'll see.",
        "Starr: Okay, you know what? Let's forget about it. Thank you -- thank you both for coming with me today, but I don't think that we should come back to this class.",
        "Blair: What, are you going to bail on the class?",
        "Starr: Look, we can buy the books, read it all at home. Millions of women have given birth without these classes, right?",

        "Cole: I already told you what the problem is.",
