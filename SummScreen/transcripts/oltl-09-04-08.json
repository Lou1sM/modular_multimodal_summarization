        "Rex and Gigi are ready to head back to Llanview. Cristian and Antonio notice them and tell Rex he better not be doing anything behind Adriana's back. Cristian later runs into a guy who tricks him and has him knocked out and kidnapped.",
        "Tess knows she better do something now that Tina might be onto her. So she locks her in the room in the basement and asks Todd if he any any suggestions. Both she and Todd know that neither better \"sell\" the other out since neither she nor Todd want to be found out. John is having his uniform cop attempting to find out whom the woman is that Todd is hiding. Marty tells Todd that she will help him raise Starr's child regardless of how impractical it may be. Tess brainstorms as to how she can \"get the goods\" on Tina. And she remembers that Tina hid something in the safe. So she goes and uncovers the jewels. Natalie enters and discovers \"Jessica\" reaching in the safe. Nora and Clint admit that they might be breaking up now that she's found out about his secret scheme involving Langston that he did not trust her to know about and assumed she would be against."

        "Jared: Oh, my man, the gate for my flight to Bogot\u00e1 was changed. Is this it?",

        "John: Nothing there for me.",
        "Michael: What, because it's here?",
        "Blair: And here I thought you had to work late.",

        "Tess: Yeah, well, get unbusy and get your ass over here to Llanfair or I'll tell John McBain about your little house guest, okay?",
        "Tina: Let me out!",
        "Tess: And take the back way, I don't want anybody to see us talking.",
        "Todd: I'll be right there. Yeah, I got to go, sorry.",
        "Marty: What's up? Sounded like something was wrong.",
        "Todd: There might be unless I do something about it right now.",

        "Tina: Tess, you can't do this to me.",
        "Tess: I already have.",
        "Tina: Why, you've got to let me out of here. I mean, what would your mother say?",

        "Tina: Tess, if you leave me in here, you're going to be sorry you ever reared your ugly little head!",
        "Tess: Did you just call me ugly?",
        "Tina: You are nothing like Jessica.",

        "Todd: No, I'm sorry. You know, it's just that there's this, uh -- this big production problem down at \"The Sun.\" They've held the front page from print until I see it. But it shouldn't take long.",
        "Marty: No, we just need to talk at some point.",
        "Todd: Oh, we will, we will. It's a date. So, you know what to do if you need anything.",
        "Marty: Got it. Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I was waiting for someone to come in at the station. And I was told it was going to be a while, so I thought --",
        "Blair: Didn't have anything better to do, so you came here.",
        "John: Yeah, something like that.",
        "Blair: Well I'm just -- I'm glad you are here. I'll be right back.",

        "Michael: I'm happy for you, that's all.",
        "John: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Michael: No, I mean it. I mean, it's nice to see you spending time with a real flesh-and-blood woman instead of a pack of x-rays for a change. Are you still looking for that woman?",
        "John: She's injured, Mike. She needs -- she needs help, if I can I.D. her, that's a start.",
        "Michael: It's just -- you've been working on this for a while and you're not getting anywhere.",
        "John: Yeah, well, thanks to modern technology, I might be able to get a picture of her.",

        "Marty: Um, yes, as a matter fact you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Natalie, I want you to slow down because you don't know the whole story.",
        "Nora: Well I don't know any of the story. What did you ask Jared to do?",
        "Natalie: Well, you know Dorian's foster daughter, Starr's friend, Langston.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Dad, here, wants Jared to go off and find one of her long-lost relatives so that he can then bribe him to take custody of her, and he thinks that's how Dorian is going to give the company back.",
        "Nora: Is that true?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Dad, tell her.",
        "Clint: I promised myself that I would get this company back into the Buchanan family and I will.",
        "Nora: By exploiting a teenager?",
        "Natalie: Dad, I don't care what you do to Dorian because she -- she deserves it. But Langston is a -- she's a teenager. She lost both of her parents.",
        "Clint: Let me get this straight now. You're all upset about a girl that you hardly know, but you had no problem with Jared causing all these problems with your family?",
        "Natalie: You're right, I hardly know her. But I do know what it's like to become a part of a family that you truly love and then lose it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I still don't know how I'm going to tell Shane that you're his father.",
        "Rex: Gigi, I --",
        "Gigi: I'm not backing out, okay. All the lies have to stop.",
        "Rex: Not just yours. Oh, I can't believe I can finally tell you how I feel about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: There isn't anything in here that says what actually happened to my father or Jonas.",
        "Antonio: They must be in prison.",
        "Talia: If they're still alive.",
        "Sarah: Oh, my God, is that Rex Balsom?",
        "Rex: Antonio, Cristian, hey.",
        "Cristian: How do you think Adriana would feel about you locking lips with the woman that crashed her wedding?",
        "Antonio: Don't give us any crap about this not being what it looks like.",
        "Rex: It is what it looks like.",
        "Gigi: Rex and Adriana are separated.",
        "Cristian: When a married couple separates, it usually means they're still married.",
        "Rex: Gigi, why don't you try calling Shane again?",
        "Antonio: Do I need to remind you that you still have a wife, Balsom?",
        "Rex: I know Adriana and I are still married. But it's over.",
        "Cristian: Adriana know that?",
        "Rex: No, I haven't talked to her in a while.",
        "Cristian: I have, and she still thinks it's going to work.",
        "Antonio: Maybe we should give her a call.",
        "Rex: No, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that.",
        "Cristian: Why not? Give us one good reason why we shouldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: John, all I'm saying is you went through hell when Marty died, and I am just really glad to see you happy with a woman as great as Blair.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Michael: Don't let this mystery woman screw it up.",
        "John: Stop lecturing me, all right? Look, I've been working this case since before Ramsey got popped. I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere.",
        "Michael: Okay, great. But, you know, Blair is a keeper. And, you know, she went through her own hell with Todd, so the two of you finding each other, it just -- it seems -- it seems right.",
        "Blair: Told you I wouldn't be long.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Blair: You're welcome.",
        "Michael: I'm going to see you later. Okay.",
        "Blair: Did I, uh, chase him away?",
        "John: Not a lot of guys are leaving the room when you walk in, believe me.",
        "Blair: You're sweet. Well, after the day that I've had, I think you're exactly what I need.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Are you saving this for Vincent?",
        "Layla: Not in this lifetime. He cheated on me.",
        "Michael: Oh. I'm sorry.",
        "Layla: Yeah. We just didn't have what it takes to make it. You know, we weren't like you and Marcie.",
        "Michael: Uh, yeah.",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Michael: Marcie and I are separated and probably getting a divorce.",
        "Layla: Michael, I am so sorry. I had no idea. I thought you two were good after all that stuff with Todd's baby.",
        "Michael: Well, yeah, no, that was before all this stuff with Todd's grandchild.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So, how did the child birthing classes go, and I don't want any of the gory details.",
        "Blair: Oh, okay. Um, well, it was great until Todd showed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: All right, what's the big emergency? I was in the middle of something.",
        "Tess: Yeah, well, that's too bad, because we have a problem.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Tess: Your lovely sister Tina.",

        "Tina: Someone's got to hear me. I'm sorry, David Vickers. I think this place is sealed tight as a tomb.",
        "[David Vickers whimpers]",
        "Tina: Oh, sorry. Bad choice of words. Okay, but you know what, you and I, we have been in tight fixes before. All we have to do is put our heads together and think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I told you I'm not taking Tina in.",
        "Tess: Listen, your ditz sister is on to me, okay? She knows that I'm not Jessica.",
        "Todd: Well, whose the ditz who let her figure it out? This isn't my problem.",
        "Tess: Oh, well, it is your problem if I rat you out for holding Marty Saybrooke hostage.",
        "Todd: She's not a hostage.",
        "Tess: Really, she isn't? Because --",
        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "Tess: I think if she found out that she was raped, she would consider herself a hostage. I actually think that she would try to escape, but then, she can't escape, now, can she, because she's an amnesiac cripple who everybody thinks is dead. So, how about this, Todd? I won't tell John and Marty what you've been up to if you help me with our problem, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So you want us to lie to Adriana, huh?",
        "Rex: No, I just want to be the one to tell Adriana that it's over. I still care about her.",
        "Cristian: Well, you have a hell of a way of showing it.",
        "Rex: And I suck, I know that. Adriana deserves better.",
        "Cristian: I don't want my cousin married to you one minute longer than she has to be, you got that?",
        "Antonio: She really loved you.",
        "Rex: I loved her, too.",
        "Antonio: But you love someone else more. You know, couples, they, uh, they have a lot of reasons for breaking up. But this is usually the one that hurts the most. I don't want to see my sister embarrassed, okay? So take care of this soon. I hope this one's worth it.",
        "Gigi: Are you okay?",
        "Rex: Yeah. No.",
        "Gigi: Did they do something to you?",
        "Rex: They're just real protective of Adriana. I'm glad, she -- she's going to need them. I really screwed her over.",
        "Gigi: Any regrets?",
        "Rex: Yeah. That I didn't tell her sooner.",

        "[Phone rings]",
        "Sarah: I got to take this. This is a band I've been trying to book for Capricorn.",
        "Cristian: Business already?",
        "Sarah: Yeah.",
        "Talia: The first thing I'm going to do when I get back in Llanview is I'm going straight to your mother's diner and I am going to get so much delicious takeout. What?",
        "Antonio: Uh, babe, a lot's happened since you left Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Okay, man, I'll get back to you on those dates. Jared Banks?",
        "Jared: Sar-- Sarah?",
        "Sarah: What are you doing here?",
        "Jared: What are you doing here?",
        "Sarah: I'm on my way back from Europe. What about you?",
        "Jared: I'm going to South America, doing a little business for your granddad.",
        "Sarah: Suicide mission?",
        "Jared: Huh. Well, trying to repair some damage to the company, anyways.",
        "Sarah: You know, we're not going to forget how you played us.",
        "Jared: Probably not, you know, but if all goes well, I'm hoping Clint and Natalie can salvage what they had. So \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How could you be such a hypocrite?",
        "Clint: Excuse me?",
        "Natalie: When I look at you, all I see is disappointment all over your face. Hey, and I don't blame you, because keeping Jared's secret was wrong, but what you're doing is absolutely no better and you have no right to judge.",
        "Clint: I wouldn't have to be doing anything if Jared hadn't thrown this family into turmoil.",
        "Natalie: He shouldn't have done what he did, but at least he wasn't trying to hurt someone.",
        "Clint: Oh, come on, are you kidding me? He -- he passed himself off as my brother, as your uncle. You're telling me that didn't hurt you? Don't talk to me about how I'm worse than Jared! I'm not, there's no comparison.",
        "Natalie: You're just going to pawn this girl off on some relative she doesn't even know?",
        "Clint: Nothing will come of it, all right? She'll end up with Dorian and we'll have B.E. back.",
        "Natalie: Dad, you don't know that. I mean, what if everything gets totally screwed up and you ruin this girl's life, for what, a company?",
        "Clint: A co--",
        "Natalie: Okay, I know -- I know that B.E. is more than that. But come on, we're still standing here. We all survived. We're fine.",
        "Clint: I am not troubled by anything that I'm doing.",
        "Natalie: Oh, are you, really? Well, if you're so proud of yourself, why did -- why'd you keep it secret from Nora?",
        "Clint: Because the fewer people who know about this the better. Now you think what you want about me, but you should know something -- your boyfriend was very eager to get on board with all of this.",
        "Natalie: For me, so that I could get my father's love back. But whoever is doing this, well, I don't know who he is, but he sure as hell ain't my father.",
        "Clint: I suppose that you've got something to say, too.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I suppose I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You and Marcie? I mean, you two were like the couple we all wanted to be.",
        "Michael: Well, things happen, and everything changes.",
        "Layla: But you always seemed like you were so in love with each other.",
        "Michael: We were, we are.",
        "Layla: I heard she's adopting Starr's baby?",
        "Michael: That's why I can't be with her. I mean, she looked so happy and hopeful today, and it just -- it won't last. There is no way that Todd Manning is going to let her adopt Starr's baby. He will make sure that her heart is broken again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Manning didn't do anything nuts, did he? I mean, you wouldn't keep that from me, would you?",
        "Blair: No, I would not keep that from you, Detective. But he was on his best behavior. There was a roomful of people and best behavior such as it is.",
        "John: So what was he doing there?",
        "Blair: Apologizing.",
        "John: What was he smoking?",
        "Blair: That's exactly what I thought, but no. You know, he walks in there and he, you know, he goes into this speech telling Starr how much he understands why she's giving her baby to Marcie, but the clincher is he practically gives Marcie his blessing.",
        "John: Do you believe him?",
        "Blair: No, absolutely not, but you know Starr did. She desperately wants to believe that her father has changed.",
        "John: So what's really happened with him?",
        "Blair: I don't know.",
        "John: With Manning, there's usually another agenda. I'm going to find out what it is.",

        "Marty: All right, Janet, work your magic.",
        "Janet: Oh, you don't need any magic. But, how about this?",
        "Marty: Perfect, and when we're done with this, would you mind grabbing that nightgown that Todd bought for me?",
        "Janet: I hope you know what you're doing.",
        "Marty: I think I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: How the hell could you let Tina sniff you out?",
        "Tess: She didn't sniff me out, the dog -- sniffed me out. Funny, yeah.",
        "Todd: The dog screwed you up, huh? God, you are dumb.",
        "Tess: Listen, Todd, let's forget about how Tina found out, okay? She did. Now what are we going to do about it?",
        "Todd: How should I know? She's probably calling Viki or Natalie right now to tell them. Oh, that's not a problem, eh? Uh-huh. Where is Tina? I'd like to see her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Any luck?",
        "[David Vickers whimpers]",
        "Tina: Me, neither.",

        "Tina: Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry. Looks like there's no way out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Hey, Todd, are you sure you want to go talk to Aunt Tina? Because if you do, she's going to tell you about me, and then you're going to have to explain to her why you're not going to do a damn thing about it.",
        "Todd: What'd you do to her, Tess?",
        "Tess: Well, I couldn't let her spill.",
        "Todd: Oh, God -- you didn't kill her, did you?",
        "Tess: No! Not yet.",
        "Todd: Oh, you're thinking of it, are you?",
        "Tess: I don't want to, okay? So help me think of something better to do.",
        "[Tess snaps fingers]",
        "Todd: Hmm. Do what you do best. Get some leverage. Find something to hold over her. You know, if you figure out what she's up to, she won't give you up.",
        "Tess: You know, I have to be honest with you. I'm a little disappointed. Is this the best you can do?",
        "Todd: Well, it works for me. See you. Oh, hey, by the way -- if you mess things up again, don't include me. And remember, I can hurt you just as bad as you think you can hurt me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So, are you still looking for that person Todd is hiding?",
        "John: I didn't come down here to talk about him.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Layla sighs]",
        "Layla: So -- how is this working out for you? Does sitting at a bar crying in your tequila help you feel better about not being with Marcie?",
        "Michael: No. How about you?",
        "Layla: Not a bit. It actually feels -- pathetic.",
        "Michael: I don't know. No, see, it's not pathetic. You're hurting, so --",
        "Layla: Okay, Doc. Well, this right here --",
        "Michael: Mm-hmm.",
        "Layla: More tequila.",
        "Michael: Mm-hmm.",
        "Layla: It beats being pathetic and alone.",
        "Michael: Cheers to that.",
        "Layla: Cheers to that. Can I have some of yours?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You don't know why I'm here?",
        "Blair: Um -- free drinks?",
        "John: That, too. Actually, I heard there was a singer that was supposed to be pretty hot.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Blair: I'll let her know. You have any requests?",

        "Clint: Before you saddle up that moral high horse of yours, let's remember --",
        "Nora: Oh, not a good start.",
        "Clint: Let's remember that Dorian is wearing the black hat here, okay? And she will do anything to keep that girl. The only thing that I was doing was revamping what we were trying to do with Addie and David Vickers.",
        "Nora: Okay, Langston is a minor. She's a complete innocent here.",
        "Clint: Like I told Natalie, she is not going to get hurt. I'm just using her for leverage.",
        "Nora: Okay, you know what? It's not for me to judge your business decisions. That's not why I'm miffed here.",
        "Clint: You're not miffed -- you're angry, aren't you?",
        "Nora: Okay, it's about us -- if there ever was an \"us.\" I just feel like you went out and did all this right behind my back.",
        "Clint: I didn't -- I told you I was working on something.",
        "Nora: And that you would fill me in as it started coming together. But it's up and running, and I had to hear about that from somebody else, very much like the time you teamed up with Lindsay behind my back.",
        "Clint: Okay -- with either time, if I had told you, would you have approved?",

        "Nora: As your friend, who happens to be a pretty good attorney, I would have laid out both sides of the issues.",
        "Clint: Yeah, but ultimately, you would have told me not to do it.",
        "Nora: And you would have done it anyway. Is that why you didn't tell me, because you didn't want to hear me say, \"Don't do this, Clint\" -- because you really just wanted to do it?",
        "Clint: Ah, no, Nora, be honest. We would have argued about it day and night.",
        "Nora: Oh, God. So what am I supposed to do with this information now, Clint, hmm? Am I just supposed to stand here and watch a young girl get hurt? And don't even try to say that she's not going to get hurt, because you can't guarantee that.",
        "Clint: There's nothing you can do about it, right? Aren't you bound by confidentiality?",
        "Nora: I'm not your lawyer, Clint. I'm your friend. Well, actually, I had it in my head that we were partners in life -- working toward something good. I guess I was wrong on that one? I -- you know what? One of us should leave, but this is my house.",

        "Cristian: No arguments, Antonio. You've been away from your girl long enough.",
        "Sarah: I'll just take the later flight with you.",

In fact, I remember telling a favorite patient of mine that you have to take a tough situation and -- and figure out what to do, and then act on it. So, when, you know, you first brought up the idea of bringing Starr's baby into the house, I don't know -- something inside of me just jumped a little bit, and the thought of a little baby running around got me a little excited. You know, I haven't felt like that in a long time. But it's so impractical. And --",
