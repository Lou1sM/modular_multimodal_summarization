        "At Matthew's hearing, Tea is able to get Rachel to admit that she has a \"fear of death\" because when she was using, she was a prostitute and killed her roommate. Greg goes after Rachel and she admits that he was right that she's afraid of risks and wants to sabotage her brother's hope of walking again because of that. The judge tells both Tea and Nora they are going to jail because of their courtroom outbursts and theatrics. John manages to prevent Keaton from killing Cole after the mayor has informed Keaton that Cole is onto them and has to be silenced. But Serge tells the mayor that he must do something about it. So he goes to the house and threatens Todd and Starr with a gun."

        "Greg: I get that Matthew's family is afraid of losing him. He's a really great kid. They love him for who he is, not for what he can do, but they're keeping their son from living the life he wants to live because they're afraid, afraid to let go, afraid to trust, afraid to take risks, so they're opting for the safe choice, the one that involves less chance of getting hurt, less chance of loss, but no chance of gain. They know their son wants a better life, but out of fear, they're unable to allow him that. They're denying him the chance to experience the joy d excitement that comes with letting go and taking a risk. That's a shame and a waste.",
        "Rachel: Now, that is the biggest load of crap I've ever heard in my life.",
        "Nora: Okay. Rachel, what are you doing?",
        "Rachel: Dr. Evans isn't here because he cares about Matthew. He's here for his own agenda.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really? What would that be?",
        "Rachel: Mr. Clarke, please put me on the stand. I think I could shed some light on Dr. Evans' motives.",
        "Elijah: Not when I have no idea what you're gonna say.",
        "Nora: Rachel, that means T\u00e9a would cross-examine you, and I think that's a little dangerous, so please just sit down.",
        "Rachel: Mom, I am not afraid of T\u00e9a.",
        "Judge Henson: Mr. Clarke, is this outburst finished?",
        "Elijah: My apologies, Your Honor.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, I'd like to put Ms. Gannon on the stand. I'm very interested in what she has to say.",
        "Judge Henson: Are you finished with Dr. Evans?",
        "T\u00e9a: For now.",
        "Judge Henson: You may step down, Dr. Evans. Ms. Gannon?",
        "Bo: Do you know what this is about?",
        "Nora: I wish I did.",
        "Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...",
        "Bo: She wants to testify against Evans.",
        "Nora: Which could be a good thing.",
        "Bo: Yeah, if T\u00e9a wasn't all for it.",

        "Shaun: Hey, Starr.",
        "Starr: Shaun.",
        "Shaun: You were hoping I was somebody else.",
        "Starr: I'm looking for my dad.",
        "Shaun: He just called me.",
        "Starr: What for?",
        "Shaun: All he said was for me to get my butt down here to guard you, Hope, and the boys with my life.",
        "Starr: I told him not to tell anyone.",
        "Shaun: Tell me what?",
        "Starr: He's gonna get Cole killed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't do anything big. Just yank Cole off this operation before Starr and hope get hurt. I know that everyone thinks that McBain is some kind of genius, but\u0097",
        "Mayor Lowell: Not everyone.",
        "Todd: Ha ha! Yeah. That's why I thought I could come to you. What kind of idiot uses an 18-year-old kid to bust up a drug ring?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Don't worry, Mr. Manning. I'm dealing with it as we speak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Lowell's voice: The kid who sold the drugs to my son, Cole Thornhart, you find out if he knows anything and if he can connect the drug operation to me. If he even suspects anything and he can rat me out, kill him.",
        "John: Keeton's location.",
        "Oliver: He's in the building. He's downstairs.",
        "John: Heading straight for Cole's cell.",
        "Keeton: Hey, Danny, hey, I need to be alone with the prisoner.",
        "Cole: What do you want?",
        "Keeton: I'm Keeton.",
        "Cole: I got nothing to say to you. I know my rights.",
        "Keeton: Relax. I know you've been working undercover.",
        "Cole: Who told you?",
        "Keeton: I'm on McBain's task force, hand-picked by the man himself.",
        "Cole: Oh. He didn't tell me.",
        "Keeton: Oh, well, that's Johnny for you. He keeps everyone on a need-to-know.",
        "Cole: So, are we going upstairs?",
        "Keeton: Not yet. I thought you might be going a little stir crazy.",
        "Cole: Not so bad.",
        "Keeton: Hey, I don't blame you. It's tough being locked up knowing what you know.",
        "Cole: I still can't believe Mayor Lowell is the guy that's getting drugs into Llanview.",
        "Keeton: That's all I needed to hear.",

        "T\u00e9a: Please state your name and your relationship to the plaintiff.",
        "Rachel: Rachel Gannon. I'm Matthew Buchanan's sister.",
        "T\u00e9a: And, for the record, you and I have a personal relationship, as well.",
        "Rachel: Yes. We were roommates.",
        "T\u00e9a: And friends, I hope.",
        "Rachel: Well, that depends. You still owe me for half the security deposit.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha! You mentioned that you believe Dr. Evans was testifying today because he has his own agenda.",
        "Rachel: That's right.",
        "T\u00e9a: Dr. Evans is a world-renowned neurosurgeon.",
        "Rachel: Does that make him an expert on my family?",
        "T\u00e9a: And you are. Of course. I see. Do you support your mother and Commissioner Buchanan's decision to deny your brother the chance to walk again?",
        "Rachel: My family wants Matthew to walk again, and so do I.",
        "T\u00e9a: But they refuse to allow the surgery.",
        "Rachel: Not for the reasons that Dr. Evans just stated. As I said, his testimony has nothing to do with Matthew or my family. He said what he did because of me.",
        "T\u00e9a: You?",
        "Rachel: Dr. Evans wasn't trying to get justice for Matthew just now. He was trying to get to me.",
        "Elijah: Objection, Your Honor. How can the witness know what was on Dr. Evans' mind?",
        "Judge Henson: Sustained.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ms. Gannon, when did you come back to Llanview?",
        "Rachel: A couple of weeks after Matthew's accident.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you came because you felt your family needed you.",
        "Rachel: Yes.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm, and you support Matthew's parents' decision to deny him the surgery.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm. Was your outburst an attempt to back them up by discrediting Dr. Evans?",
        "Rachel: No. I had to say the truth. Dr. Evans believes that I'm the one who's afraid of losing control. He thinks he knows me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really? Why would that be?",
        "Rachel: He knows that I am a recovering drug addict.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ah, recovering, so that means you've admitted that you're powerless over drugs.",
        "Rachel: My recovery is my business.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes. Of course it is. Now, Ms. Gannon, what qualifies you to testify as to Dr. Evans' state of mind?",
        "Rachel: I know him.",
        "T\u00e9a: Does he know you?",
        "Rachel: I'm sorry. I don't understand your question.",
        "T\u00e9a: Does he know what happened as a result of your addiction? Ms. Gannon?",
        "Rachel: This isn't fair.",
        "T\u00e9a: You sank into prostitution. Isn't that correct?",
        "Nora: Okay. Objection, Your Honor.",
        "T\u00e9a: The witness attacked Dr. Evans' character. I have every right to establish her credibility.",
        "Judge Henson: The witness will answer the question.",
        "Rachel: Yes, Ms. Delgado. I was a prostitute, okay? Anything else?",

        "Cristian: Whoa, that's because I'm an artist, Mom",
        "Carlotta: Ay, mijo, I'm not blind, okay? I saw the signs.",
        "Layla: You mean all that time he spends at the gym?",
        "Carlotta: And all the trouble you have with women.",
        "Cristian: What trouble with women?",
        "Carlotta: It goes back all the way to Jessica. You were never able to work that out.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but that's not because I'm gay. I mean, I'm not gay, okay? I'm not. Layla, can you please help me out here and tell my mom that I am not gay? Tell her.",

        "Starr: Where did he say he was going?",
        "Shaun: I didn't ask. Where's Jack and Sam?",
        "Starr: Grandma took the boys to New York, and they're staying over.",
        "Shaun: No one else is home?",
        "Starr: No, just me and Hope.",
        "Shaun: Good. Makes my job a little bit easier. Something else would, too.",

        "Mayor Lowell: I'm sure you understand that I can't comment on an ongoing police investigation.",
        "Todd: Not here for comment.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You have always been a supportive member of the press, and I don't forget those things.",
        "Todd: Listen. Right now, I'm just concerned about my daughter. That's all.",
        "Mayor Lowell: I'm sure she has nothing to do with this.",
        "Todd: Well, Cole is the father of her child. Makes her and my grandchild vulnerable.",
        "Mayor Lowell: I understand your concern.",
        "Todd: Well, do you understand what could happen if these mobsters find out that Cole's been ratting on them? They could use Starr and hope to get to him.",
        "Mayor Lowell: I don't think it'll come to that.",
        "Todd: Don't really care what you think. I still need to keep guard on my daughter and my granddaughter.",

        "Mayor Lowell: Sorry you don't trust the police department to protect your family.",
        "Todd: Yeah, because the police department is the reason they're so vulnerable. Now, why is it you can't keep McBain on a leash?",
        "Mayor Lowell: I promise you, John McBain's days as a renegade are coming to an end.",
        "Todd: Well, that's all I got to say. You'll let me know when Cole is off this thing?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You know, I am just as concerned about Starr as Todd is.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Well, I'm sure it has to do with her relationship with Cole Thornhart.",
        "Dorian: Exactly, and the fact that Cole has been doing undercover work.",
        "Mayor Lowell: But, as you said, John McBain said we have nothing to worry about. I'm sure that your niece is perfectly safe.",
        "Dorian: Unless somebody has blown Cole's cover.",

        "Shaun: Better for who? Listen to me, Starr. This is years of bodyguard experience speaking. The more I know, the better it is for the both of us.",
        "Starr: My dad just saw something, and he jumped to conclusions, as usual.",
        "Shaun: Did you tell him that?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I told him that he didn't see what he thought he saw.",
        "Shaun: He didn't believe you?",

        "Judge Henson: Yes, yes, but keep it brief, Ms. Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, Your Honor. Ms. Gannon, you just testified that as a result of your drug addiction, you became a prostitute.",
        "Rachel: Yes.",

        "Rachel: No.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, so it must be very hard for you watching Matthew knowing that he can't possibly fathom the turn his life could take should something go wrong with the surgery.",

        "Rachel: Because she's dead.",
        "T\u00e9a: I see, and how did she die?",
        "Elijah: Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is using her personal knowledge to badger the witness.",
        "Judge Henson: Overruled, but make your point, Ms. Delgado.",
