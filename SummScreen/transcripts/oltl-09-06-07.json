        "Adriana: This was a good call, coming here.",
        "Rex: Thick walls.",
        "Adriana: No roommates.",
        "Rex: No interruptions.",
        "Adriana: God, I wish it could be like this all the time.",
        "Rex: It can.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Move in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey, I am so sorry to barge in on you like this.",
        "Miles: You're always welcome.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. So, you haven't heard from Todd.",
        "Miles: Why would you say that?",
        "Natalie: Well, you're not wearing a full-body cast.",
        "Miles: Oh. Probably the farthest thing from his mind.",
        "Natalie: Well, I am sure as soon as Blair told Todd the news about his son that he -- he beelined straight for him.",
        "Miles: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.",
        "Natalie: Listen, don't be surprised if he shows up with brass knuckles and says hello and doesn't leave any good deed unpunished.",
        "Miles: Yeah? I'm not worried about Todd right now. I'm more concerned about the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Marcie: Who's at the door? Should we go see who's at the door? Huh? Let's see.",
        "Roxy: Ok --",
        "Marcie: Oh.",
        "Roxy: Hot stuff coming through.",
        "Marcie: Hey.",
        "Roxy: Oh, man! Too many steps. I got to put in an elevator.",
        "Marcie: What's going on, Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Ok. What I got in this box is going to get Lindsay off the hook for whacking Spencer Truman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah. I understand. Listen, I -- I wouldn't have expected anything else out of him. Just do me a favor -- keep the lawyer busy. I need some time.",
        "Michael: Please, John, don't tell me.",
        "John: Sit down, Mike.",
        "Michael: Don't do that. Don't handle me, ok? You call me up, you tell me it's serious, you tell me to get down here, and then you try to finesse me? Tell me the truth.",
        "John: It's about Tommy.",
        "Michael: No, John. You promised me. You gave me your word that you weren't going to say anything. John, you can't. You can't tell Todd Manning.",
        "John: It's too late, Manning knows.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I want my lawyer! I got my rights! I sure as hell know them by now. Let me out of here!",
        "Guard: Ain't going to happen, Manning.",
        "Todd: \"Is\" going to happen!",
        "Guard: Not unless you feel the need to freshen up, too.",
        "Todd: I want my lawyer! I want my phone call!",
        "Guard: Phone's are out.",
        "Todd: Oh, the hell they are! You got to let me out of here so I can use the phone right now.",
        "Guard: I'll bet your lawyer would prefer the night off.",
        "Todd: No, my lawyer works by the hour, as a matter fact. I'm sure he'd love an opportunity to squeeze more money out of me.",
        "Guard: Hmm.",
        "Todd: You know, you're going to find yourself working security at a mall, my friend.",
        "Guard: Ah.",
        "Lindsay: What'd you do this time? Strangle a kitten?",
        "Todd: Huh. Uh, no, I'm in here because McBain's a dirty cop. He's trying to keep me from my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: It's all good.",
        "Vincent: It's all good? Cool. So I'll see you later?",
        "Shaun: Rex and Adriana staying here tonight?",
        "Layla: No, I think they're staying at Rex's.",
        "Shaun: I'm getting some bad vibes. I think I'll stay. Got any popcorn?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I don't know what you're talking about, Todd. As usual, you're fishing. You're fishing around for something, but there's no fish here.",
        "Todd: I bet your schoolmarm friend could put away a lot of bait.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Lindsay: She has a name.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes -- Marcie. Marcie and Michael are raising someone else's kid, you know. Mine.",
        "Lindsay: You're insane.",
        "Todd: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Yes. Yes, I'm insane. You know, your kid being kidnapped and left for dead will do that to you.",
        "Lindsay: So there you have it. You lost your son and you've finally gone around the bend.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Lindsay: But you know what? You can't go around choosing random little boys to call your own.",
        "Todd: Well, I wouldn't think of that.",
        "Lindsay: Tommy's not your child.",
        "Todd: I don't know a child named Tommy.",
        "Lindsay: Well, there is one, and he lost his parents --",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Lindsay: And Michael and Marcie adopted him and that's the end of that story.",
        "Todd: Not the end of the story, not according to lieutenant John McBain. Yes, he's in on it, too, and who knows what else he's covering up. When I get my son back, your precious Marcie and Michael are going to pay through the nose for taking my son from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You told Todd Manning? What kind of brother are you?",
        "John: Mike --",
        "Michael: You gave me your word!",
        "John: Yeah, I did.",
        "Michael: And then you went behind my back and you told Todd Manning. You -- you probably planned to do this from the beginning, didn't you? Didn't you?",
        "John: Take it easy, Mike.",
        "Michael: You don't tell me to take it easy.",
        "John: I told you I wouldn't tell Manning, and I didn't. He found out from someone else.",
        "Michael: Who, John? Come on, Rex wouldn't say anything. He's -- he's gone way too far to keep the secret. He wouldn't talk now.",
        "John: I didn't say it was Balsom.",
        "Michael: Then who? I mean, who in this town hates me and Marcie so much that they would do something like this to us?",
        "John: I don't think it's about hate. Blair told him.",
        "Michael: Blair? How could she possibly know anything about this?",
        "John: Truman told Miles Laurence, Laurence told Blair.",
        "Michael: Why would he do something like this to me?",
        "John: I don't know, Mike. He's always been kind of a creep.",
        "Michael: Yeah, but do you think he's that evil, that he would intentionally go out and hurt people that he barely even knows?",
        "John: I'm not sure what his motives were, Mike. That's not the issue right now.",
        "Michael: Then what is?",
        "John: I got Todd Manning locked up downstairs right now on assault charges, I can't make them stick. We only got a small window of time to tell Marcie the truth. Thinking about your nasal allergy symptoms?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Look, don't start second-guessing yourself now. You -- you did the right thing.",
        "Miles: Oh. No, I probably put that baby into what's probably going to become an ugly tug of war. You know, everybody probably would've been better off if I had just bowed out and kept my mouth shut.",
        "Natalie: Look, you knew about Todd's son and you couldn't live with that. I mean, nobody should keep a parent from their child. Believe me, I'm speaking as one who knows.",
        "Miles: Look, you're saying all the right things. I just can't get it out of my head that I might have -- I might have done something wrong.",
        "Natalie: All right, well, say what you will about Todd -- and believe me, I would probably agree with you -- but he does love his kids and he would do anything for them.",
        "Miles: And Michael and Marcie McBain wouldn't?",
        "Natalie: What? No.",
        "Miles: Tommy. Tommy McBain is Todd's son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Do you like your shirt? Huh?",
        "Roxy: Ok, I took the liberty of be-jazzing mine a little bit. What do you think?",
        "Marcie: It's an eye-catcher.",
        "Roxy: All right. So this is my plan. We get a lot of people, we put them in this shirt, we take them down to the courthouse, we surround the courthouse, we sit down on the lawn, we link hands, we have signs and stuff like that. We start chanting. I don't know if we can keep the placards in one hand while we're linked arms -- what do you think?",
        "Marcie: Ok. Well, how is this going to help Lindsay?",
        "Roxy: What, are you kidding? The cops are going to be all over the place. We'll probably get ourselves arrested, right? And then we'll be in all the front pages and on the news programs, and there will no jury that won't be contaminated. They'll never be able to have a fair trial for Lindsay -- got it?",
        "Marcie: That is actually a really good idea.",
        "Roxy: You bet your sweet bippy, baby.",
        "Marcie: I just don't think it's going to be good enough. I don't, Rox, and I doubt that it's even going to lift Lindsay's spirits.",
        "Roxy: I disagree with you. I think she's going to feel a lot better if she thinks that we're fighting for her. U know, I don't like thinking about it, either -- it's going to make me feel better. I don't like to ink about her making license plates -- unless they say \"foxy Roxy.\"",
        "Marcie: Look, I -- I'm really sorry. I -- I want to get excited about all this, but I just can't. I keep thinking about Lindsay being in that jail cell.",
        "Roxy: I know, Marcie -- that's why we got to do something.",
        "Marcie: Look, I really think it's sweet of you to want to do all of this, but, Roxy, I don't think it's going to matter. Lindsay just isn't herself right now.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, right now, she's a babe behind bars.",
        "Marcie: See, that's it. Look, the Lindsay I know -- she wouldn't take that lying down. The Lindsay I know would be fighting, she'd be scrapping, telling everyone she's innocent. Instead, she's pushing me away, she's quitting. Rox, she's resigning herself to that life behind bars.",
        "Roxy: Marcie, you got to face it -- she's depressed, ok?",
        "Marcie: No. No. That is not it -- I don't know what it is, but I'm telling you it's more than her just being in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: I don't even think you know what you're talking about. There's no way Michael and Marcie have your son.",
        "Todd: Not true.",
        "Lindsay: And how is it that you think that you've figured this out?",
        "Todd: My friend Spencer. He's trying to take one last stab at me.",
        "Lindsay: Spencer?",
        "Todd: Yeah, Spencer Truman. Yeah, I think he thought that in case he got hacked to death with a pair of scissors, that he might want to tell someone about this, and no better chump to do his bidding than Miles Laurence.",
        "Lindsay: Well, that's stupid. If Miles was his minion, then why would he tell you?",
        "Todd: I don't know -- probably Miles had an attack of conscience. But, better late than never, right?",
        "Lindsay: So, your evidence is the word of an insane, dead murderer?",
        "Todd: I'll bet you could tell me what goes through the mind of an insane murderer.",
        "Lindsay: Doesn't memory serve me correctly in remembering that Spencer Truman left some kind of clue from the grave that got you stabbed, kidnapped, and nearly killed?",
        "Todd: That's Spencer, all right. He was a laugh a minute, boy.",
        "Lindsay: And he's still getting to you, isn't he? He's dead and he's still making you crazy. And the sad truth is he's going to take you and the entire McBain family down and all because you can't let the dead stay dead.",
        "Todd: Oh, but my son's alive.",
        "Lindsay: It's another one of Spencer's tricks -- it's not real.",
        "Todd: It seemed real when John McBain confirmed it. Hey, you -- you want to know why I'm in here?",
        "Lindsay: For being the same reactionary jerk that you always are?",
        "Todd: I'm in here because John McBain needed to arrest me so he could have some quality time with his sister-in-law, Marcie, before I went over there and broke the truth to her. He wanted to break it to her gently. Nobody's been gentle with me. I'll be damned if I'm going to be gentle with anyone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I mean, I -- I don't know why we have to tell her anything at all, you know? It's not like Todd has any real proof.",
        "John: It's over, Mike! The truth is out -- I can't run interference for you on this!",
        "Michael: You can't or you won't?",
        "John: Mike? Mike, if -- even if I could do something with those documents, what good is it going to do? Manning's not going to give up. He knows he's found his son. He was on his way over to Marcie to tell her en I threw him in a cell! That's how she was going to find out -- Todd ripping the baby from her arms!",
        "Michael: I -- I can't let this happen, John. I can't -- I can't let Todd Manning take my son!",
        "John: Oh, Mike. Marcie's got to know the truth. All right? She needs to know the truth -- she's going to find out sooner or later, and I'd rather it not be from Todd Manning.",
        "Michael: What do I say to her, John? You know? Huh. I -- I don't even know -- I mean -- oh.",
        "John: You don't have to. You don't have to tell her -- I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[TV plays]",
        "[Dramatic music plays]",
        "Shaun: You got it, boss man.",
        "[Music stops]",
        "Vincent: Oh, man, that's it?",
        "Shaun: What you guys want to watch -- something on-demand? I'm sorry. Is there anything you would like to watch?",
        "[Vincent sighs]",
        "Layla: Uh, no. It's all yours, Shaun -- hmm. I'm going to go make some more popcorn.",
        "Vincent: I think I'll help you.",
        "Shaun: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Vincent: No, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, man -- hey, sit down, relax. Take a chill pill, watch -- watch sports. See if there's a new fight on or something.",
        "Shaun: All right, you got it.",
        "Vincent: Sorry. Need a little help?",
        "Layla: Um -- he's your employee. Why don't you just tell him to go?",
        "Vincent: I know, but it's not that easy. He's my friend, and he's sensitive.",
        "Layla: Yeah. He is a knucklehead, but he's sweet. He seemed kind of down at Capricorn earlier.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. You know, I worry about him sometimes. Shaun -- he doesn't do anything outside of work.",
        "Layla: Maybe he's just lonely. You think I should ask him what he wants to watch?",
        "Vincent: Yeah, that's cool and everything, but I thought we were talking about waking up at 7:30 in the morning together.",
        "Layla: There will be many other 7:30s.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: How much did you have to drink tonight?",
        "Rex: Two beers. You were there -- I'm stone-cold sober.",
        "Adriana: Knock it off, Rex. Are you messing with my ad? Are you really asking me to move in with you?",
        "Rex: Um -- yes.",
        "Adriana: You are messing with my head.",
        "Rex: No -- I'm not. I just expected a little different reaction, that's all.",
        "Adriana: Like what?",
        "Rex: I don't know -- like happy, like rejoicing, like throwing your arms around my neck and saying, \"Yes, yes\"? But, instead, I get this.",
        "Adriana: Oh, well, I'm sorry, Rex, but \"this\" is me not understanding. I -- we haven't talked about this in, like, forever.",
        "Rex: We just talked about it an hour ago.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, and we laughed at Sarah Roberts for even suggesting it. What's the deal?",
        "Rex: I don't know. I thought spontaneous would be more romantic.",
        "Adriana: Oh, so you're asking me to shack up with you just before we're about to --",
        "Rex: Oh, is this a religious thing?",
        "Adriana: All right, be serious, Rex.",
        "Rex: I -- am serious. I wouldn't be asking if I wasn't serious -- and this isn't a heat-of-the-moment thing.",
        "Adriana: So you've been thinking about this?",
        "Rex: Of course I have. I've been thinking about it for a long time. I asked you to move in with me a year ago -- remember?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, of course I remember.",
        "Rex: Do I have to make my case? If -- if I do, I'm going to have to ask for a continuance so that I can prepare my opening statement.",
        "Adriana: Just tell me why.",
        "Rex: I'm sorry it came out of my mouth. The last thing I want to do is try to sell you in the idea of living with me. It's like I'm trying to push you into a used car. I guess it's not a good idea after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh. You know, John, I'm -- I'm not even sure I -- I want to tell her the truth. But if anybody's going to tell her, it's got to be me. I'm her husband, John. I have to be the one.",
        "John: I understand why you feel that way. But I don't think it's going to make any more sense coming from you than it is from me. It's going to hurt just as bad.",
        "Michael: And that's why it has to be me. I can hold her, John. I can try and take care of her.",
        "John: Hey. You can still do that, Mike. You can still hold her and take care of her. You focus on that, and we don't have to worry about slipping up.",
        "Michael: \"Slipping up\"? Man, what are you talking about?",
        "John: Mike, you're going to be -- you're going to be upset and you won't be thinking straight. I know, you get yourself all turned around, you might say something like -- like the truth.",
        "Michael: I thought that that's what this was all about, John. I thought that this was about finally telling the truth. What are you talking about?",
        "John: The way I see it, telling Marcie you knew won't change anything -- it'll just make things worse. And you two won't be able adopt another child.",
        "Michael: You think that's how it is, John? Huh? You think that's how it is? You think you lose one child and you just go out and you get another one?",
        "John: No, Mike, I don't. I'm talking about down the line. You're all over the place, bro. That's why you need to listen. The decisions you make in the next few hours are going to determine your future, yours and Marcie's. That's why I don't think you can risk telling her. You let Marcie concentrate on keeping the family together. Ok? She doesn't have to worry about what you knew and when you knew it.",
        "Michael: Ok. How do we do this?",
        "John: You go home and you spend some time with your wife, and you wait for me to get there. When I do, I'll tell you both, and for the sake of your marriage, you act like you're hearing it for the first time. You act like you knew nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're starting to see it my way, aren't you?",
        "Lindsay: Whether you're right or wrong, it doesn't matter.",
        "Todd: No, it matters to me, sister.",
        "Lindsay: The only thing that matters is Tommy. It's that boy's life you're playing with.",
        "Todd: That boy is going to be just fine as soon as I get him home where he belongs.",
        "Lindsay: He \"is\" where he belongs. Have you ever seen him -- have you ever seen Tommy with his mom and dad?",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, his name's not Tommy and they're not his mom and dad.",
        "Lindsay: They're the only parents that he has ever known. They have loved him and cared for him and fed him and -- and nurtured him.",
        "Todd: I'll reimburse them.",
        "Lindsay: Don't you understand that they love him more than anything in the world, that they would do anything for him?",
        "Todd: It's only because I was never given the chance to.",
        "Lindsay: That little boy has parents that he loves and he's bonded to. Do you understand the damage that will be done if you rip him away from them?",
        "Todd: Are you suggesting that I just leave him with them? Just watch him grow up from afar? Huh. Does that sound like something I would do? What would you do, Lindsay, if it were your kid?",
        "Lindsay: Maybe -- you could get shared custody or something.",
        "[Todd scoffs]",
        "Todd: No, there is no way I'm going to let a couple of strangers have a say in how I raise my own child. It is going to be hard on them, isn't it? Oh, well. It's been hell on me. So, try to get it through that damaged pea brain of yours -- I'm going to get that kid back, end of story. And poor little Marcie and Michael will just have to start all over again.",
        "Lindsay: Not as long as I'm around. You are not going to rip that child away from them. I will lay down my life before I let that happen. I think she's got 16 kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So you want me to keep pretending that I don't know anything about Tommy?",
        "John: I know how it sounds, but I think it's the best way.",
        "Michael: No. No way, John. No, I've been -- I've been keeping this from Marcie. No. I've been lying, John. I have been lying to my wife. If I don't come clean now, John, I'm going to be lying for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: He's been right here under our noses this whole time.",
        "Miles: Yep.",
        "Natalie: He's my Godson.",
        "Miles: There's no way that you could've known.",
        "Natalie: Someone sure did.",
        "Miles: No, I don't think anybody did.",
        "Natalie: No. John had a huge reaction when I told him that Blair was going to give Todd the news, and then he just -- he ran out of his office and left me and Marty hanging in the dust, which he wouldn't have done if he hadn't known what was coming. I wonder how long John's known.",
        "Miles: Why would that matter?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I guess it really doesn't. I just -- I shouldn't be surprised. John would go to the ends of the earth for people that he loves.",
        "Miles: That seems admirable enough.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, don't try to do it for him. He would bite your head off. God, poor John. I really hope he was able to stop Blair in time.",
        "Miles: I don't see how he could do anything. I mean, from what I know of Blair, he's not going to be able to slow her down, much less stop her.",
        "Natalie: No. And I'm sure that Blair has told Todd by now, and it's only a matter of time before Michael and Marcie hear the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey. You're my brother. Whatever you want to do, I'll back you up, bro. But no matter who tells her, she's going to be blindsided and blindsided bad. She finds out about your involvement, it just makes it worse. She may not make it through this.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Huh.",
        "John: And listen to me. If Marcie -- Marcie needs to hate someone, let it be me. I'd rather take the blame in this than have you do it.",
        "Michael: You would do that for me?",
        "John: Yeah. Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So you're telling me you don't think these t-shirts are going to help?",
        "Marcie: I know you went through a lot of trouble.",
        "[Roxy laughs]",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry.",
        "Roxy: Oh, what a bummer. What are we going to do with these?",
        "Marcie: You know what? We can keep them. Look -- you never know when the whole civil disobedience thing is going to come in handy down the road, right? Guerrilla tactics might be exactly what we need later on.",
        "Roxy: Oh, no, I'm not messing with those apes. You know, when I was in Atlantic City, I used to go to \"georgette at the jungle.\" I still got the scratch marks from Joey the silverback.",
        "Marcie: What I'm trying to say is, uh -- I think it's good, I think it's a really good idea. I just -- I'm not sure about your timing, you know? Lindsay is in jail and it's not going to do her any good with her sitting in jail moping. We -- we need to get her back into fighting form.",
        "Roxy: All right, I'm coming up with another idea. All right, I bake cupcakes, I put meds in it. It'll help her depression.",
        "Marcie: I'm not sure drugs are the answer.",
        "Roxy: Well, maybe just cupcakes, you know? Sugar always works for me.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, let's -- let's sleep on it.",
        "Roxy: Good idea --",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Because some of my best ideas come when I'm sleeping, so I better hit that pillow right now --",
        "Marcie: Oh, ok.",
        "Roxy: Because the sooner I come up with something, the better.",
        "Marcie: Definitely, and look, Rox, I'm really sorry, you know? I didn't -- I -- I didn't mean to shoot down any of your ideas. I didn't.",
        "Roxy: Hey, it's hard to leave here.",
        "[Tommy fusses]",
        "Roxy: Oh, come on.",
        "Marcie: He's getting cranky.",
        "Roxy: It's hard to leave here -- I know -- on a sour note when I look at the little thing in his mouth and those peepers.",
        "Marcie: I know.",
        "Roxy: A little of Tommy goes a long, long way.",
        "Marcie: It sure does, doesn't it, you know? Imagine what a whole lot of Tommy can do -- yeah. I thank God for him every day, you know?",
        "Roxy: You're a very lucky lady. Ok. All right, honey. I'll see you later.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: All right, now figure out what to do with those.",
        "Marcie: I will. Thanks for coming by. I'll hang on to them, ok?",
        "Roxy: You better. Bye.",
        "Marcie: Bye. Hey, hey. Mr. Man -- you know what? I just got an idea. Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Please, throw yourself on the tracks. It won't bother me. There's nothing you could do, Lindsay, to keep me from my son.",
        "Lindsay: Just because Margaret and Spencer aren't here anymore, you think you're untouchable? I'm still here.",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Lindsay: I could ruin your son jack's life if it'll save Tommy's.",
        "Todd: Are you threatening me?",
        "Lindsay: How do you think jack would feel if he knew that his own father -- well, what his own father did to him on the day that he was born? Keeping him from his mother, telling Blair that he was dead, pawning him off on strangers? Why, Spencer knew exactly what he was doing when he was exacting revenge with you, didn't he? He's given you the same thing you gave Blair.",
        "Todd: So you're -- you're suggesting that this whole episode with Tommy is because of what happened with jack?",
        "Lindsay: What happened with jack you did on purpose, and you're his father.",
        "Todd: I didn't know he was mine.",
        "Lindsay: You knew he was Blair's.",
        "Todd: Hmm. Well, a long time ago.",
        "Lindsay: Yet history is repeating itself. You didn't know that jack was yours. You didn't know that Tommy was yours, either. DNA does not make a dad -- love and sacrifice does. You stay away from Marcie, Michael, and their child or I will make sure that jack knows exactly what kind of father he has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Listen, we can't put this off any longer.",
        "Michael: You're right. I hate it. And you're right.",
        "John: Well, Mike, I wish there was something I could do to spare you and Marcie from this. I would do it.",
        "Michael: John, you already did it. You put your reputation and your career on the line for me -- for me and -- and my family. I don't know how I'm ever going to thank you, John.",
        "John: There's no need. This is what family does.",
        "Michael: Thank you, thank you.",
        "John: Yeah --",
        "Michael: Thank you.",
        "John: Listen to me. You go home and you spend some time with Marcie and wait for me to get there and we'll get this done.",
        "Michael: Ok.",
        "John: Ok. Hey, Mike?",
        "Michael: Yeah?",
        "John: Don't ever thank me again.",
        "Michael: Right.",

        "Vincent: Take it easy, man. Go home.",
        "Shaun: Oh. I get it. Sorry.",
        "Vincent: That's not it, man. That's not it at all.",
        "Layla: No, no, no, no, no. We love having you around us.",
        "Layla: Well, what if -- what if all three of us go to that art exhibit tomorrow? How about that?",
        "Shaun: Yeah. I'll see you later.",
        "Layla: Wait, Shaun.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, man. It's not like we got big plans tonight.",
        "Layla: Yeah, we were just going to sit around and -- hmm -- watch TV all night anyway.",
        "Vincent: Yeah, so you want to hang out with us, it's cool.",
        "Shaun: All right. Maybe just until the news is over.",

        "Adriana: I don't want to say things we don't mean.",
        "Rex: If you don't want to move in, fine -- don't.",
        "Adriana: I haven't said anything like that. I just haven't said yes yet.",
        "Rex: Then you want to?",
        "Adriana: Absolutely.",
        "Rex: So what's stopping you?",
        "Adriana: This is a really big deal, Rex.",
        "Rex: No bigger than us keeping the secret about Tommy for a year.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, you say that now, but you haven't given up half your closet space yet.",
        "Rex: I was planning on giving up 3/4.",
        "Adriana: I'm serious, Rex. This is your place, where you're used to doing things your way. I move in here with all my stuff and, sure, it'll be fun at first, but then I'll start getting on your nerves, which will turn into you being pissed off at me, and then breaking up is just around the corner.",
        "Rex: So you think if you move in, we'll break up?",
        "Adriana: I just got you back, and I don't want to jeopardize that. Now, come on, be honest -- doesn't this whole thing kind of scare you?",
        "Rex: Sky-diving would scare me, too, but it'd be one hell of a ride.",
        "Adriana: And what about a parachute?",
        "Rex: You've always been my chute. You bring me back down to earth. What do you say -- you want to jump?",

        "Todd: You play dirty.",
        "Lindsay: Don't test me, Todd.",
        "Todd: Or what? You'll do whatever it takes? So will I. How is your son, by the way? Will? He's out in Los Angeles, isn't he? How's he doing -- is he making a name for himself out there? You know, I always liked will. And maybe next time I'm out there, I'll look him up.",
        "Lindsay: Don't you dare threaten my son!",
        "Todd: Like you threatened mine? If I were you, Lindsay, I'd worry about your own children -- that is, the ones that aren't dead -- instead of putting everything into one you have no relationship to.",
        "Lindsay: You're a monster.",
        "Todd: You have no idea. If you screw with my family, any one of them, I'm going to fly out to Los Angeles or maybe I'll hire someone to fly out to Los Angeles and hurt your son. So, nut job, which family do you value more?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So, what's going on -- are we going to do this?",
        "Adriana: You have to tell me the second I start getting on your nerves.",
        "Rex: Like right now?",
        "Adriana: Oh. Ok.",
        "Rex: \"Ok\" what?",
        "Adriana: Ok, I'll move in with you.",
        "Rex: Yes! Now, the number one rule of Rex and Adriana's apartment --",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rex: Oh -- all arguments are going to be capped off with removal of clothing, followed by profuse sweating and heavy breathing.",
        "Adriana: Ooh, well, Layla's going to kill me.",
        "Rex: Are you kidding? She'll be happy to have the place to herself.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",

        "Natalie: My God -- what this must be doing to Michael and Marcie.",
        "Miles: You still think I did the right thing?",
        "Natalie: Thank you. You did what you had to do. Todd needed to know about his son.",
        "Miles: But the people that this is going to hurt --",
        "Natalie: Spencer did that. He got all of them -- Todd and Blair, Michael and Marcie, and John, with all one big blow.",
        "Miles: And the baby -- what about the baby? I mean, isn't there anything that we can do to make this better?",
        "Natalie: Yes.",
        "Natalie: We can call the people that we care about and let them know that we're there for them.",
