        "Greg: I don't want to stay away from you.",
        "Rachel: Just go back to your life of being a brilliant doctor, saving lives, and sipping the champagne with the Vivians of the world. Pretend like you never even heard of Rachel Gannon.",
        "Greg: I can't.",
        "Rachel: Why not? What do you want from me? Just go. Just get out of here. Just leave me alone\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. I don't think you need to worry, Nora. I'm sure Rachel is fine.",
        "Nora: You talk to me again, especially about my daughter, I'm gonna hit you again. Guard! Guard, could someone please bring in my stack of files on my desk or a magazine or newspaper or something so I don't have to look at this woman?",
        "T\u00e9a: I doubt the judge will keep us here very long.",
        "Nora: Well, I guess you're very familiar with contempt of court citations. Ha ha! Judging from your courtroom conduct, I'm not surprised.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, okay. Nora, I know what you think of me, all right?",
        "Nora: Not in detail, as a matter of fact. Oh, since we got so much time, I might well want to fill you in. You've been spending far too much time with your favorite client Todd Manning. T\u00e9a, you're becoming as disgusting as he is.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad...",
        "Todd: Hmm?",
        "Starr: I know you're hiding something.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh. How do you know that?",
        "Starr: Do you even have to ask?",
        "Todd: Okay. What am I hiding?",
        "Starr: Where did you go when you left here? What did you say? Who did you say it to? Come on. Tell me right now.",
        "Todd: Excuse me. Who the hell are you?",
        "Sergei: Sergei Scherbakov, Cole's boss, I thought, but Cole is not who I thought he was, so looks like joke is on me. Look at the brave daddy.",
        "Todd: Listen. Cole doesn't live here.",
        "Sergei: But his girlfriend and baby do. Now shut up and get down on your knees.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: John. John, are you there?",
        "Brody: Come on in. Come on.",
        "Marty: Cole. What are you doing here?",
        "Brody: I'm working with the police department now.",
        "Marty: What's going on? What are you doing here? Okay. Someone quickly fill me in quickly.",
        "Brody: Cole is here with me so I can keep an eye on him.",
        "Marty: Why? Why?",
        "Cole: Somebody tried to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: LPD! Hands in the air!",
        "Oliver: Where is everybody?",
        "John: Where's Lowell?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Viki, wait, please. Not another word until my camera crew gets set up. Markko, 3 shot, me in the center. It's okay if you cut them out of frame.",
        "Natalie: David--",
        "David: Viki, my money is on you, Victoria Lord Riley Burke Riley Buchanan Buchanan Carpenter Davidson Banks.",
        "Natalie: David, what are you doing here?",
        "David: I'm with the press. Ford, show them our press pass. There we go. Now, everyone smile, not too big.",
        "Viki: Markko, is this really necessary?",
        "Markko: I'm sorry, Mrs. Banks. We'll be out of here soon as we can.",
        "David: Pay no attention to the man behind the camera. Viki...",
        "Viki: David.",
        "David: Your listening tour, we'll be coming along with you.",
        "Viki: David, I've been listening for quite a while now. There will not be a tour.",
        "Charlie: Look. This is a legitimate debate. This is a campaign event. This is not a part of your show.",
        "David: Au contraire. I beg to differ. Reality television is all about voting someone off, and if candidate Banks plays her cards right, I can assure that she will be the sole survivor.",
        "Natalie: Really? And how are you gonna do that, David? Because you're not even registered to vote in the state of Pennsylvania.",
        "David: Make a note--change my residency status and get me an absentee ballot.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "David: My support will go to whoever wins this debate, so keep this in mind. I'll be interested in whichever candidate supports the biggest Hollywood bailout. Speaking of which, do you know any people out in Santa Monica, maybe Brentwood, who could pony up a little bit of cash, call a network, twist a few arms? You get my show on the air, you get my endorsement.",
        "Dorian: Oh, Mayor Lowell does not need the endorsement of the \"D\" list. In fact, the citizens of Llanview don't care about politics. They care about issues. They care about who is gonna create jobs, who is going to fight the crime wave that has flooded this fair city, which the Llanview police department has allowed to happen. They are not going to put their trust in this country club board member when we have a man who will get down and dirty to make Llanview clean--Mayor Stanley Lowell.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sergei: I said down on your knees.",
        "Todd: What are you gonna do, shoot me? I said run!",
        "Starr: Dad! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Aah! Oh! Oh, my God.",
        "Sergei: I see you've met my associates.",
        "Todd: Whatever the hell you guys want, I'll give it to you. Just leave my daughter out of it.",
        "Sergei: Sorry. Your daughter is why we are here. She's coming with us.",
        "Starr: Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Check the back.",
        "Man: No. You can't go back there. This is police harassment.",
        "John: Have a seat.",
        "Man: Do you have a warrant?",
        "John: You got a name?",
        "Man: I have the right to remain silent.",
        "John: You have about 4 seconds to tell me where Lowell is.",
        "Man: The Palace, at the debate, the Banks-Lowell showdown. Dr. Lord just set it up. It should start any minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Dorian, I think you should save your posturing until after the debate, which is when your candidate will need the spin.",
        "David: Kapow! Candidate Banks gets the first round.",
        "Dorian: It's the last round that counts, and, Viki, Mayor Lowell is not gonna pull any punches just because you're a woman.",
        "Viki: Swing away, Mr. Mayor.",
        "David: Yeah. Well, don't swing too hard. You don't want to dislodge one of her alters who will go all nuclear on you.",
        "Viki: David, that's not helping.",
        "David: Sorry.",
        "Charlie: Viki is a strong, powerful woman, and sometimes that has a tendency to intimidate a weaker man.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Well, then let me be the first to assure Mrs. Banks. I can't wait to get in the ring with you, and let's make a pledge right here and now. Let's have a good, clean fight.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm all for that, Mayor, all for that.",
        "Mayor Lowell: And I'd like to make Mrs. Banks an offer. Should she fail in her bid to unseat me, I would like to give her an opportunity to prove her commitment to public service.",
        "Viki: Hmm?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Come work for me, Mrs. Banks.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Mayor Lowell: I can always use a secretary.",
        "Viki: Mayor Lowell, I would like to make the same offer to you. However, I would not want to undermine the will of the people. If you are voted out, you stay out.",
        "Jessica: Whoo! Whoo!",
        "Natalie: Yep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Someone tried to kill you? How? When?",
        "Cole: I was in the cell.",
        "Marty: What, one of the prisoners tired to kill you?",
        "Cole: No, no. It wasn't like that, and I'm okay.",
        "Marty: How can you be okay? You're barricaded in John's office with an armed guard.",
        "Brody: John has got the situation under control.",
        "Marty: Where is he?",
        "Cole: He didn't call you?",
        "Marty: No. He left a message and said you'd been arrested. That's why I'm here, but I didn't speak with him.",
        "Cole: Well, he was supposed to call you and Starr.",
        "Marty: No. All I got was a message.",
        "Cole: Oh, hope he got through to Starr. Hope Starr is okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You touch my daughter, I swear to God--",
        "Sergei: You'll what, big shot?",
        "Starr: Aah! Dad! Oh, my God! Aah! Who are you people?",
        "Sergei: You are making what they call a rhetorical statement, yes? Your boyfriend didn't tell you?",
        "Starr: Wait. Where is he going? There's nothing up there.",
        "Todd: Listen. Whatever you people are being paid, I'll double it. Just leave her alone.",
        "Sergei: This is not about money.",
        "Todd: Well, then take me. Just leave her out of it. She's just a kid.",
        "Sergei: Is that right? Well, she's also a mommy.",
        "Todd: Yeah. She's a mother. Please don't take her away from her child.",
        "Sergei: I am not heartless. I am taking the baby, too.",
        "Starr: [Gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I thought you hit an all-time low when you put Marty Saybrooke on the stand, but you know something? You outdid yourself today.",
        "T\u00e9a: Rachel gave me no choice.",
        "Nora: Oh, that is baloney. You could've demanded that her outburst be stricken from the record, but no. Instead, you put her on the stand with no preparation and tore her apart.",
        "T\u00e9a: I felt I owed that to my client.",
        "Nora: Your client is Rachel's brother, and he didn't seem very pleased with what you did.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I'm sure one day, he will come to understand and even appreciate what I--",
        "Nora: You think Rachel will one day understand and appreciate what you did?",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] I didn't start this, Nora. Rachel did.",
        "Nora: So, that justifies you forcing her to tell a whole courtroom full of people that she was once a drug addict and a prostitute?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh--",
        "Nora: T\u00e9a, killing Georgie Phillips, it almost destroyed her, and you knew that, and you made her relive it.",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't mean for it to go that far.",
        "Nora: Oh, come on. Yes, you did. You got exactly what you wanted out of her, and you loved every second of it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Now, that is not true. Why would I want to intentionally hurt Rachel? We were roommates. She was my friend, Nora.",
        "Nora: Well, if that's how you treat your friends, God help your enemies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Mm, oh, my God, what am I doing? What is wrong with me?",
        "Greg: It's my fault. I chased after you to see if you were okay and to apologize, not to kiss you.",
        "Rachel: I kissed you back.",
        "Greg: Yeah, but you were upset and confused, and you had every right to be after what I did. Sometimes, most of the time, there's more going on in a family or in a person than in the injury I know how to fix. Just listen to me. I just wanted to get my own way. I had no idea-- I mean, I knew about the substance abuse, but I had no idea how bad it was.",
        "Rachel: Turning tricks, killing someone, yeah, that's about as bad as it gets.",
        "Greg: I was way out of line. I am so sorry.",
        "Rachel: But you were right about some things. I am scared. I do keep myself on a tight leash because I feel like I have to. Everything you said, that T\u00e9a said, it was all true.",
        "Greg: Yeah, but it's only part of the picture. You are so much more than your past.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Lowell: Speak right into that microphone. You'll need it.",
        "Viki: Mayor, it's what you say that counts, not how loudly you say it.",
        "David: Cuz, I've been meaning to ask--",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry. This seat is taken.",
        "David: Oh, all right. I'll just go back here.",
        "Natalie: That one is taken, too.",
        "David: Jared\u0097",
        "Jared: Taken, David.",
        "David: [Sighs] Careful what you wish for. Being a celebrity is exhausting. Everybody loves you, and nobody loves you.",
        "Dorian: David, I will always love you.",
        "David: Oh, don't say that off camera. Markko! Two shot, Dorian telling me that she'll love me forever. And...action.",
        "Dorian: Hello, Markko.",
        "Markko: Hi.",
        "Dorian: Hi, Ford.",
        "Ford: Hey.",
        "Dorian: Where's the other one?",
        "David: What other one?",
        "Dorian: There were 3 in your crew.",
        "Ford: You mean Priscilla.",
        "David: Budget cuts. She had to go. It killed me. And...action.",
        "Moderator: If you could all please take your seats...",
        "David: Come on.",
        "[People murmuring]",
        "Moderator: I'd like to welcome you all to what I hope will be the first in a series of debates about important issues surrounding our community. Mayor Lowell has won the coin toss, and he will get the first question. Mayor, you've been very vocal about your displeasure with the police department, blaming them, in fact, for the recent surge in drug-related crime. Now, you've already had one term, and you really haven't made any progress in solving the problem, so why should we have you back?",
        "Mayor Lowell: Well, I admit, I've had too much patience with the LPD, but I've done what I could as mayor. I have fought for funding for neighborhood initiatives, for after school programs...",
        "David: I'm so bored, I think I'm getting seasick.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Grass roots activism can take the place of a strong police department. That is why in my next term, I am cleaning house, starting with Commissioner Bo Buchanan. It is time for Bo to go.",
        "David: Hey, that's my Pa you're talking about.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Now we all know that Commissioner Buchanan comes from a rich and influential family, as does my opponent. In fact, she considers Commissioner Buchanan to be part of the family, but my allegiance is with the town of Llanview, and not with the special interests of the rich and privileged. I stand with the good people who had to work for what they have.",
        "Dorian: Oh, hear, hear. Ha ha!",
        "Mayor Lowell: And I say that it is time for a new commissioner, one who will not let drug dealers and drug addicts take away what those good people fought for. Now, as a mayor, I have fought crime up and down, but my opponent knows nothing about this, unless, of course, you consider the many crimes that her other personalities have committed.",
        "[People murmuring]",
        "Dorian: Not to mention the crimes that she covered up that were committed by her half-brother Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Oh, let me go! What is he doing up there? Please! Please don't touch my baby!",
        "Sergei: Nothing's gonna happen to your baby. Just taking little ride. Take her.",
        "Starr: Ow! You're hurting me!",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Starr: Please don't hurt him. Please don't hurt him. Please don't hurt him.",
        "[Ringing stops]",
        "Sergei: And we are all going to calm down so nothing else bad is going to happen.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Starr: Oh, oh. Oh, my. Ow.",
        "Sergei: What do you know? It's your baby daddy. You can blame our little visit on him. I would not be here if he had died when he was supposed to.",
        "Starr: What are you talking about? What happened to Cole?",
        "Todd: Hey, look. I don't want anyone to get hurt here, so let's make a deal you and me. I promise you, you leave her alone, you have my guarantee that you leave here a rich man and I will not come after you.",
        "Sergei: Something tells me you're not the \"live and let live\" type, so how about we kill you now just to be on safe side?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr, call me as soon as you get this. A bunch of stuff just happened, and I need to make sure you and Hope are okay.",
        "Marty: Hey, she's probably just busy with the baby.",
        "Cole: There's always someone there at the house. I think the land line went dead.",
        "Marty: Starr has no idea what's happened to you?",
        "Cole: Not unless John got through to her.",
        "Marty: Why, we'll all drive over there.",
        "Cole: I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Marty: All right. You two need to tell me what's really going on here.",
        "Brody: Marty, we can't tell you more than we already have.",
        "Marty: My son almost got killed because of this undercover thing. Now you need to tell me what's going on and start with why he was arrested.",
        "Cole: Look. John was trying to protect me.",
        "Marty: From whom?",
        "Cole: Look. I have to tell her. The mayor. He wants me dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moderator: Mrs. Banks, rebuttal?",
        "Viki: Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Mr. Lowell is absolutely right about one thing. The crime rate in this city has risen dramatically during his first term--17%, in fact--and all that began after he fired Bo Buchanan as commissioner of police and replaced him with a man named Lee Ramsey, who, I'm sure you'll all recall, was murdered in the act of selling stolen jewels.",
        "David: Are you getting all of this, Markko. Are you?",
        "Markko: Yes, yes, if you stop shaking the camera.",
        "Viki: As for his criticism of the police department, unfortunately, his interference has been the cause of many of their problems. If he would simply allow them to do their jobs instead of indulging in personal grudges against certain officers, this city would be a great deal safer.",
        "Natalie: Whoo! That's right.",
        "Ford: Get the reaction.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: For example, he fired a decorated detective, John McBain, who then proceeded to solve the K.A.D. murder case as a civilian.",
        "Ford: All right. Keep panning.",
        "Markko: The cops are here.",
        "Ford: Stay on them. Where there's cops, there's a story.",
        "David: Did you say cops? There's cops?",
        "Dorian: Where? Oh. What's he doing here?",
        "David: Who cares? I need a new character. The camera loves him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: No! Please, please don't shoot him! Please don't shoot him. Don't. I won't let you just shoot him.",
        "Todd: Starr, it's okay.",
        "Starr: No. It's not okay.",
        "Man: You want me to do him?",
        "Starr: No! No! Please don't.",
        "Sergei: Wait till we get the baby.",
        "Starr: You leave my baby alone. Please. Dad, I'm so sorry.",
        "Todd: Not your fault, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: I love you.",
        "Todd: I love you, too, honey.",
        "Sergei: I changed my mind. I can't listen to this crap. Go ahead. Do him.",
        "Starr: No! Don't! Don't, don't don't, don't! Shaun, no!",
        "[Sobbing]",
        "Sergei: Who's Shaun?",

        "Rachel: Look. I don't want to talk about my past or my future or who I am or any of it. I just want to pretend it didn't happen.",
        "Greg: I don't think that I can do that.",
        "Rachel: Look. You already apologized. Let's just go back to our professional relationship--you're the doctor, I'm the screwed-up sister of the patient, end of story.",
        "Greg: Rachel--",
        "Rachel: Don't! Don't talk to me like you know me because you don't. We have been pushing each other's buttons. That's it. That's all it is.",
        "Greg: And the kiss?",
        "Rachel: Was the topper, okay, the knockout punch. The fight is over. I quit.",
        "Greg: Okay. Look. I admit that we've been going after each other in all the wrong ways, but I'd like for us to start over again.",
        "Rachel: That can't happen.",
        "Greg: Why not? We're obviously attracted to each other.",
        "Rachel: I stay away from a lot of things that I'm attracted to. It's better that way.",
        "Greg: Okay. I respect that, but can't we start over or get to know each other?",
        "Rachel: I don't want to get to know you for all kinds of reasons but most of all because of your brother, because of Shaun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, Nora. I had to discredit what Rachel said about Dr. Evans. That meant discrediting Rachel as a witness. I'm sure you've employed a similar strategy many times.",
        "Nora: Yeah, \"blah, blah, blah. Nothing personal. Blah, blah.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: That is correct.",
        "Nora: My God, you've become such a machine with absolutely no feeling.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's also not true.",
        "Nora: You say you and Rachel are friends, hmm?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes.",
        "Nora: You've both been back in town I don't know how many months. How many times have you come over? How many times have you called Rachel, try to set up a play date?",
        "T\u00e9a: I've been busy.",
        "Nora: How many times, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't you cross examine me.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah. It's not fun, is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] It had to be done.",
        "Nora: Oh, yeah, because the end justifies the means.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wouldn't you do anything for a client?",
