        "While they are at the hospital for their first sonogram, Jessica tells Brody that he may not be her baby's father and that Ford is the other possible father. She tells him that when she thought about how she would feel if he kept something like that from her, she decided she couldn't keep lying to him. Brody storms off. Natalie is about to tell John that Brody could be her baby's father when Marty stops by to ask John if Eli is really dead. After John and Marty discuss the child they lost, Natalie decides to continue to keep the secret. John and Natalie go to have their first sonogram.",
        "Ford flirts with Langston and she gives him a copy of the college's policy on fraternization. She tells him that they can't be anything other than student and teacher. Cole gets jealous when he sees Starr talking to James in their classroom and realizes that the two of them will be in class together. He and Starr leave to discuss their issues. Starr tells him that she is still mad at him because he lied to her. He says it was for her own good and that he would do it again. She tells him he is starting to sound like her father. Langston goes to class and wonders why she and James are the only people there. Another teacher comes in and announces that today's class has been cancelled because Ford withdrew as the teacher because of a conflict of interest. When Langston confronts Ford, he assures her that he will win her back. He tells her he is going to have therapy with Marty to work through whatever has made him the way he is. Brody storms in and punches Ford.",
        "Greg goes to Todd's house and is about to tell Todd about what happened with Tea, but he receives a text message ordering him not to say another word so Greg says he wanted to tell Todd that Tea's remains are coming separately. Todd goes to Marty's office and she is in no mood to be bothered with him. He asks her how she managed when Patrick died and left her alone to raise Cole. She tells him that he will have to focus on Dani and that in time it will get easier. He is disappointed that she didn't have better advice for him. She offers to refer him to one of her colleagues but he declines and says he hates all doctors. Greg goes to Marty's office and says he wants to be her patient because she is the only person he can trust. The urn containing Tea's ashes is delivered to Todd's house."

        "John: Hey. You ready? You okay?",
        "Natalie: I'm fine.",
        "John: Yeah? Because you know, if there's something bothering you, I want to know about it.",
        "Natalie: Then I... guess I should tell you, then.",
        "John: What's going on?",
        "Natalie: It's about the baby. And Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What are you talking about? What can't you do anymore?",
        "Jessica: I can't keep on lying to you.",
        "Brody: About what?",
        "Jessica: Brody, you know I love you more than anything else in the world, right?",
        "Brody: And I love you. Jess, what's going on?",
        "Jessica: You're gonna hate me when I tell you this.",
        "Brody: Not possible. Just tell me.",
        "Jessica: Oh... this baby... there's a chance that it might not be yours.",
        "Brody: Wait. What? How can this baby not be mine?",
        "Jessica: Because... I slept with someone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: That is ridiculous. How is anybody supposed to find their class with this thing?",
        "Ford: Excuse me, Miss. I think I can take you where you need to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Is that seat taken?",
        "Starr: What are you--what are you doing here?",
        "James: What are you doing here at all? I didn't think you were coming in today.",
        "Starr: It's the first day of class.",
        "James: Yeah, I know, but you seemed so upset after you got off the phone with your dad yesterday. I was worried about you.",
        "Starr: I got some really bad news.",
        "James: Wait, it's not about your mom, is it? Everything with that guy Eli--",
        "Starr: No, no, no, no, no. I saw her. She's fine.",
        "James: Oh, well, then, then what is it?",
        "Starr: It's my stepmother T\u00e9a. She died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't tell me you came here without T\u00e9a's ashes. Where the hell are they?",
        "Greg: I don't have them.",
        "Todd: Why not? You said you were gonna bring them back with you.",
        "Greg: I know what I said.",
        "Todd: Then where are they?",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Greg: That's what I'm trying to tell you. T\u00e9a's--",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a's what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What does Brody have to do with our baby?",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "John: Don't answer it.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Natalie: It's probably Roxy. Just let me get rid of her.",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] Ro--oh. Marty.",
        "Marty: Yeah. I was hoping to speak with John.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, of course.",
        "John: How are you?",
        "Marty: I'm sorry for barging in like this. I just heard about Eli.",
        "John: Yeah. I--I just got back a couple hours ago. I was gonna find you this afternoon.",
        "Marty: Is he really dead?",
        "John: Blair found out the truth and she confronted him with it.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God. Is she all right?",
        "John: She's a little shaken up, but otherwise she's okay. They were struggling over a gun and a fire broke out. I got Blair out of there but not Eli. I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "John: I wanted to bring him back here alive. I wanted him to pay for what he did to you.",
        "Marty: So...so it's true.",
        "John: Blair said that Eli admitted to everything, including pushing you down the stairs.",
        "Marty: Did he tell her why?",
        "John: It's because of me. It's like we talked about. He needed to do something to throw us off his trail and... that's why the baby's gone.",
        "Marty: Maybe now I can... find a place to put all this... move on. Because you certainly have a very good reason to do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a's what? Spit it out.",
        "Greg: The authorities wouldn't release her remains to me. I had to make arrangements to have them shipped back separately.",
        "Todd: And you came all the way over here to tell me that?",
        "Greg: Yes, I wanted you to know.",
        "Todd: Are you brave or just stupid?",
        "Greg: No. I wanted you to know.",
        "Todd: Oh, I get it. You're confessing now?",
        "Greg: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Todd: Well, at the hospice place, you had no problem keeping quiet about the fact that you hid my wife from me and our daughter. So now the guilt's starting to eat away at you? Is that it?",
        "Greg: No, I was only doing what my patient wanted.",
        "Todd: Your patient had a tumor in her head scrambling her brain. Did that ever occur to you, man? That maybe she was not in her right mind? What kind of a dying woman would choose to spend her final moments without her family, without the ones she loves around her?",
        "Greg: T\u00e9a changed her mind, okay? If that makes you feel any better. She wanted you and Dani there. She asked for you. Uhh!",
        "Todd: No, it doesn't make me feel any better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My dad and my sister flew down to see her, but by the time they got there...",
        "James: Wow. I mean, that's just...I'm sorry, Starr. I don't know what to say.",
        "Starr: Hey, I didn't know what to say, either, so that's why I'm helping plan the memorial.",
        "James: Anything I can do?",
        "Starr: No, don't worry about it. I have a big family and they all loved my stepmom, so I'm covered.",
        "James: So you guys were close?",
        "Starr: Yeah. She and my dad first got married when I was really little, so she's been a part of my life since I can remember. And now that she's gone...",
        "James: Well, let me know if there's anything I can do. Seriously.",
        "Starr: You're already doing it.",
        "James: Well, I guess with all this major trauma going on, you and Cole probably decided to put your issues on hold.",
        "Starr: Mm. Not exactly.",
        "James: You mean you're still fighting?",
        "Starr: Well, I spent the night with my dad and sister and then by the time I woke up this morning, Cole was already out of the house.",
        "James: Oh. You guys will probably talk later.",
        "Starr: Later I have to go to my dad's. So I don't know when Cole and I are gonna get a chance to talk or what we'll say when we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Thanks, but I can find my way to my class all by myself.",
        "Ford: Not if you don't know where you are right now.",
        "Langston: I would've figured that out eventually.",
        "Ford: Of course you would've. Where are you going?",
        "Langston: Um, the same place you are. I'm taking your class, remember?",
        "Ford: I hope you brought me a nice, shiny, red apple.",
        "Langston: Sorry. All I have with me is a copy of the university's fraternization policy.",
        "Ford: Langston, I was kidding.",
        "Langston: Well, good. I hope so. Because the only reason I didn't drop your class is because if you're my teacher and I'm your student, that's all we can be. So it looks like you're gonna have to find somebody else to play with.",
        "Ford: But you're the only one I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You slept with someone else?",
        "Jessica: I'm so sorry, Brody. I never meant to.",
        "Brody: Then how--",
        "Jessica: I know how this is gonna sound, but it was an accident.",
        "Brody: An accident?",
        "Jessica: I wasn't myself, Brody. It was--it was the night of prom before I got my memory back.",
        "Brody: But I was with you.",
        "Jessica: No, no, it was later on, after you dropped me off at my father's.",
        "Brody: You told me you went to Cristian's but he wasn't home, and then after that... who was it?",
        "Jessica: No one that I care about. No one that I care about. You're the only man in the world that I care about.",
        "Brody: Jessica, you tell me. Tell me who could've taken advantage of you like that. It was Ford, wasn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: All right, what did T\u00e9a say? I want to hear it word for word.",
        "Greg: T\u00e9a was failing. She knew she had very little time left. I was able to ease the pain but not much else.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you were pretty useless. I already knew that, though.",
        "Greg: Look, T\u00e9a had experienced what I would call a moment of clarity. She asked for you and Danielle.",
        "Todd: Why didn't you call me?",
        "Greg: Because at first I thought she was hallucinating.",
        "Todd: Oh, jeez. Oh, of course. If a dying woman wants her family around her, she must be hallucinating.",
        "Greg: You have to understand. She had been experiencing these episodes. She'd wake up confused and wondered where you and Dani were, and I had to remind her that she's the one that wanted to go through the end of this by herself.",
        "Todd: What a Good Samaritan you are.",
        "Greg: Todd, this time, T\u00e9a was lucid. She said she remembered telling me that, but this time she realized she was wrong. She wanted you and Dani there and she...",
        "Todd: And why didn't you contact me, then?",
        "Greg: I did. I tried calling you. I swear I did. But by that point, you and Dani must have been on the plane, flying there with Shaun. And then by the time you got there--",
        "Todd: You could've told us.",
        "Greg: I almost did. I just figured that it would've been a big mistake, that it just would've made you that much more upset.",
        "Todd: To know that T\u00e9a wanted us there.",
        "Greg: To know that T\u00e9a wanted you there but it was too late. It was a judgment, Todd. I was wrong and I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: You don't know the first thing about sorry. Is that it, or do you have some other great news for me?",
        "Greg: No, that's everything.",
        "Todd: All right. Then get out.",
        "[Greg sighs]",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, what are you doing here?",
        "Cole: I have class.",
        "Starr: Well, I know that, but I didn't think it was in this building.",
        "Cole: It's not. We just didn't get a chance to talk this morning and, well, wanted to wish you luck on your first day.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Cole: So you two are in the same class now?",
        "James: Looks that way.",
        "Cole: Well, I thought you dropped out of high school to steal cars.",
        "James: I did. But I dropped back in again.",
        "Cole: And now you're at L.U.",
        "James: I hope so. I passed my GED and my brother's letting me audit his class until I'm enrolled.",
        "Cole: Well, lucky for you the admissions office is asleep at the wheel.",
        "Starr: Cole, come on.",
        "Cole: Can we talk?",
        "Starr: Yeah, sure. What would you like to talk about?",
        "Cole: Not here.",
        "Starr: Well, class is about to start, so--",
        "Cole: Well, I'm sure Joe College would be thrilled to take notes for you, right? Come on. It won't take long.",
        "James: I'll cover for you.",
        "Cole: See? Good, old James on the job. Thanks, pal, for looking out.",
        "James: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You did have sex with Ford, didn't you?",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "Brody: But you told me. You told me nothing happened with him.",
        "Jessica: Because that's what he told me. You were there.",
        "Brody: But you don't remember any of it.",
        "Jessica: No, I don't. One second I was in bed with him and the next second, I was at my dad's house, and everything just came flooding back to me, all of my memories, everything except--",
        "Brody: Except what had just happened with Ford.",
        "Jessica: I didn't know whether I had slept with him or not. I didn't, and every time I started to think about it, I just tried to think about something else, and then I got pregnant. I realized I couldn't ignore it anymore. So I just asked him straight out.",
        "Brody: And he admitted it?",
        "Jessica: No, he didn't. He denied it. Even after-- Kelly found out that he got tested for hepatitis C after she told him that he could've gotten it from having sex with me. So I confronted him again and he came clean.",
        "Brody: But even that doesn't mean he could be-- but even that doesn't mean he could be this baby's father. I mean, it just happened the one time, right?",
        "Jessica: Yes, yes, but... he didn't use protection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Please don't be too hard on yourself. You...you did what you had to do. You went after the bad guy.",
        "John: Yeah, well, we didn't exactly get justice, did we?",
        "Marty: Maybe not. But now at least Eli can't hurt us or our families ever again.",
        "John: You gonna be okay?",
        "Marty: Yeah. I think so. You know, knowing the truth about what happened to our baby, that helps. How about you?",
        "John: I don't know. But I'm getting there.",
        "Marty: Okay. I know this situation between the three of us is awkward, to say the least. But I really do hope it doesn't have to stay that way.",
        "Natalie: Me, too.",
        "Marty: I...I can't say that your news didn't surprise me, but you know, to be anything but happy for you both, it's just too much work.",
        "Natalie: I know how you feel.",
        "Marty: And I know how much you wanted to be a father and I'm really glad you're getting a second chance. Thanks.",
        "John: We don't have a lot of time until the appointment. What was it you wanted to tell me?",
        "Natalie: There is something I need to talk to you about.",
        "John: About Brody and the baby?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. John, I-- I ran into Brody at the O.B.-- the O.B.'S office, and there was a little scare with Jessica and Brody's baby.",
        "John: Are they okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're all 3 fine. It was just that Jessica and Brody's blood types didn't match.",
        "John: They're not compatible?",
        "Natalie: Right. I mean, they thought they were, and then they weren't, and that meant that Jessica was gonna have to do treatment for Rh disease like she had to do with Chloe.",
        "John: Okay. But Jessica would know her Rh factor. Brody was in the Navy, right? So--",
        "Natalie: Right, and it ended up being just a mix-up, and it turns out they are compatible, so, I mean, everything-- everything's fine now.",
        "John: Good.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "John: That's what you wanted to tell me.",
        "Natalie: It's just got me thinking about all the things that could go wrong with the baby.",
        "John: It's hard not to.",
        "Natalie: So you're okay with it?",
        "John: I wouldn't say I'm okay with it, but...",
        "Natalie: But what?",
        "John: When life throws you a curve ball, you swing away.",
        "Natalie: So if something happens?",
        "John: We deal with it. But right now all I'm planning on is living my life with you and this baby. Nothing... nothing's gonna get in the way of that.",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So not only did that son of a bitch take advantage of you when he knew you weren't well, he didn't even bother to wear a condom! What kind of an idiot--",
        "Jessica: Brody, it was my fault, too.",
        "Brody: No. Don't you blame yourself.",
        "Jessica: No, I was a mess. Cristian had just rejected me and then I saw him propose to Layla. And you had just told me that my--Mitch, my biological father, had tried to have sex with me, and I had to convince myself that was this lie.",
        "Brody: You were fragile and Ford used that.",
        "Jessica: He was just really nice to me, you know? He just knew all the right things to say.",
        "Brody: I'll bet he did.",
        "Jessica: And it just happened.",
        "Brody: And now you could be carrying his baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: What are you--oh. Where's Starr?",
        "James: Cole dragged her off somewhere to go work stuff out.",
        "Langston: Try not to sound so happy about it.",
        "James: Starr made it crystal clear that we're just friends and that's it. Just like you and Bobby.",
        "Langston: No. Your brother and I are not friends. From now on, our relationship is strictly student-teacher.",
        "James: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I wonder how long that's gonna last.",
        "Langston: As long as I'm in his class, that's all we can be. Speaking of class, why are we the only ones in here?",
        "Man: Because this class has been canceled for today.",
        "Langston: What? Canceled?",
        "Man: Yeah. I'm Scott Bentz with the English department. I'm told you'll have a new instructor next week.",
        "James: Wait. What about Bobby? I mean Robert Ford?",
        "Scott: He's apparently decided he can't teach the class.",
        "Langston: Why not?",
        "Scott: Something about a conflict of interest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So what's up?",
        "Cole: What's up is that you're avoiding me.",
        "Starr: No, I'm not. What are you talking about?",
        "Cole: Well, for starters, you were at your dad's house till 3 A.M.",
        "Starr: Because T\u00e9a died.",
        "Cole: And then you wouldn't say anything to me this morning.",
        "Starr: I was asleep.",
        "Cole: And you wanted to go to class instead of working things out between us. You just want to act like you're not mad at me?",
        "Starr: I don't want to fight about this.",
        "Cole: Well, I don't want to pretend that--that everything is okay. It's too hard on me and hope still knows that something's wrong.",
        "Starr: Okay, fine. Yes, I am mad at you. And can you blame me? You didn't tell me about Eli. You knew that my mom was in danger and you didn't say one word to me.",
        "Cole: I told you, it wasn't my call.",
        "Starr: Because John told you to keep quiet.",
        "Cole: So what's the problem?",
        "Starr: Look, Cole, I like John. He is a great cop. I mean, at one point or another, he saved the lives of everyone that I care about. But--",
        "Cole: Okay, then why can't you trust him in this?",
        "Starr: Cole, he's not always right, and this is one of those times. It's okay for him not to tell me something because of an investigation because he's a cop and you're not, though. You're my family.",
        "Cole: Starr, I know that.",
        "Starr: And don't you think after everything we've been through, the last thing you should do is keep another secret from me?",
        "Cole: Starr, your mom is okay, right?",
        "Starr: That's not the point. The point is, is that you lied to me.",
        "Cole: For your own good. Starr, if I had to do it all over again, I would do exactly the same thing.",
        "Starr: Oh. Wow, Cole. You know, I never thought that I would say this, but you are starting to sound exactly like my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I need to talk to you.",
        "Marty: Not again.",
        "Todd: Just listen to me.",
        "Marty: Believe it or not, you can't just come in here anytime you want--",
        "Todd: I'm sorry! I am. I just--I need-- please.",
        "Marty: What? What is it?",
        "Todd: I need to do something and I just can't do it, not without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You did not just compare me to your father.",
        "Starr: You're acting just like him now.",
        "Cole: Okay. So let's say I did tell you about Eli. So what happens then? John's case might have been compromised and your mom--well, I don't even want to think about what could've happened to her. And you, well, your brain would have exploded. So if I had to choose between all of that or keeping my mouth shut to protect you, well, that's a no-brainer, Starr.",
        "Starr: I don't need you to protect me.",
        "Cole: Is there anything that you need me for? Because I'm starting to wonder.",
        "Starr: Of course I need you, Cole. I love you.",
        "Cole: Well, I love you, too. That's why I hate this, Starr. I don't want to fight.",
        "Starr: Neither do I.",
        "Cole: Can we put all of this aside? Just this once? I just--Starr, look at me. I just want things to be the way they're supposed to be.",
        "Starr: So do I. I have to get back to class.",
        "Cole: Right, with James. I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't get much sleep last night so I'm in kind--kind of in a bad mood. But I will be better later, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Cole: Have a good first... day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You need my help?",
        "Todd: Yes. And listen, if there was anyone else in the world that I could ask, I would have.",
        "Marty: That's a good point. Let me have it.",
        "Todd: It's just one thing. How did you move on after Patrick died and left you alone to raise Cole?",
        "Marty: I heard about T\u00e9a. I'm--",
        "Todd: No, I don't want your pity. All right? Just tell me what I need to do.",
        "Marty: I'm afraid, Todd, there's no quick fix here. You and Dani are gonna hurt for quite a long time. But what you need to do is focus on your daughter and help her get through every day, each day. And eventually-- eventually, she'll learn to live with the loss of her mother and in time, you will learn that you will, too.",
        "Todd: Is that it? Really? That's your advice? T\u00e9a's dead, so get busy? Should I take up needlepoint?",
        "Marty: T\u00e9a may be dead but she's not gone, and you will see her in Dani, just like I see Patrick in Cole. Does that help?",
        "Todd: No. I already knew that. Well. Thanks a lot.",
        "Marty: You know what, Todd, I can set you up with one of my colleagues. I obviously cannot do any more than I have already. I can't bring you on as a patient.",
        "Todd: Are you kidding? I hate shrinks. I hate all doctors.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I never wanted to lie to you. I never wanted to keep things from you, but I just didn't know what else to do.",
        "Brody: So why are you telling me all this now?",
        "Jessica: Because I can't do it anymore. And...Ford is Rh positive. Our blood types aren't compatible.",
        "Brody: Which means you have to get treated so that the baby--",
        "Jessica: Doesn't get sick like Chloe, yes. And I just--I didn't want to go around getting these treatments behind your back.",
        "Brody: Well, now I know why Dr. Wright was acting weird when I asked her about it.",
        "Jessica: But that's not the only reason why I'm telling you, Brody. After today, after seeing our baby for the first time after hearing you talk about how much our family means to you, I just--",
        "Brody: Heck of a day, huh?",
        "Jessica: I'm so sorry. You're bonding with our baby already. And I can't bear to think what this is gonna do to you if we find out that Ford's really the father. For all I know, you won't want anything to do with me or the baby.",
        "Brody: Jessica.",
        "Jessica: And I just--I thought about how I would feel--God, if you kept something like this from me. And that's when I knew that I just couldn't go on lying to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I wish I could be as certain about the future.",
        "John: What's stopping you?",
        "Natalie: Jessica. She's already lost 2 children and... you. The thought of you losing another baby.",
        "John: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Natalie: How do you know?",
        "John: I just know. You know, what's the point of-- what's the point of worrying? What good's it gonna do? You or the baby? Huh? All you're doing is worrying all the time. What do you want--some kid that's afraid of his own shadow? That's not us. That's not our kid, is it?",
        "Natalie: I mean, actually--I was--I was just worried that he was gonna cross crime scene tape and tail suspects at the playground, so, you know.",
        "John: Hey. Look at me. What do you say I make you a deal? You try to make this the happiest 9 months of our lives and I'll do the worrying for all 3 of us.",
        "Natalie: I'll try.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. [Sighs]",
        "John: What do you say we go have a look at this kid?",
        "Natalie: Okay.",

        "Langston: What the hell?",
        "Ford: Oh. Hey. How was your class?",
        "Langston: Canceled. Apparently, the instructor decided to drop the course because there was a \"conflict of interest.\"",
        "Ford: Don't worry. The university will give you another teacher.",
        "Langston: What conflict of interest?",
        "Ford: Well, the one where I want to date my student.",
        "Langston: Ha. That is not gonna happen.",
        "Ford: Well, there's no reason why it can't. I looked up the university's fraternization policy while you were gone. See? Instructors are prohibited from dating students enrolled in their classes. You were in my class. Now you're not. So now we're officially free to see each other.",
        "Langston: Ford, just because you are no longer teaching my class does not mean I'm gonna start swooning over you.",
        "Ford: I know that. I know that, but I bet I can give you plenty of other reasons.",
        "Langston: Not when I already have plenty of reasons why I should stay away from you.",
        "Ford: Like--like what?",
        "Langston: Oh, would you like them in chronological order or order of importance?",
        "Ford: You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I'm not gonna stop until I shoot every single one of them down. I'm serious, Langston. I'm gonna get you back.",
        "Ford: All right. You don't have to give me a second chance today.",
        "Langston: Good, and FYI, tomorrow's not looking so hot, either.",
        "Ford: That's okay. It'll happen soon enough.",
        "Langston: You think so?",
        "Ford: Yeah. Absolutely.",
        "Langston: I can't believe you. You are so--",
        "Ford: Handsome? Charming? Confident?",
        "Langston: Cocky.",
        "Ford: No, cocky is confidence without reason. I've got plenty of reason.",
        "Langston: Oh. Such as?",
        "Ford: Well, remember all the names you used to call me?",
        "Langston: Yeah, like \"player,\" \"bastard,\" \"liar.\"",
        "Ford: Yeah, pretty soon none of those are gonna apply.",
        "Langston: Oh, really? And how is that gonna happen now? You gonna get a brain transplant?",
        "Ford: Therapy.",
        "Langston: Oh, now I know you're lying.",
        "Ford: No, no, no. No. Look.",
        "Langston: You have a scheduled appointment for therapy with Dr. Saybrooke?",
        "Ford: Yeah.",
        "Langston: So you're gonna sit on a couch and talk about your feelings for 45 minutes every week?",
        "Ford: 60. What can I say? I've got a lot of issues. I don't know exactly what they are yet.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. It's like you're channeling David Vickers.",
        "Ford: Well, hang on a second. Give me a break. I haven't been to the shrink yet. But a lot of people have been saying that I have issues, so I figured there might be something to it. Now, if I do, and if there is really something...",
        "Langston: Oh, what are the odds?",
        "Ford: Well, then I'll fix every single one of them. For you.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm so sorry, Brody. I know that probably doesn't make you feel any better right now. I know this is huge for us. I do. But I know that we're gonna be dealing with this for a long time. I want you to know that I love you. I love you so much. And I want to marry you and I want to have a family with you. I do. And no matter what, even if this is Ford's baby, he wants nothing to do with it. He wants nothing to do with me. And even if he did, I wouldn't let him near us. I just want you to know that in my mind, this is your baby. And we love you. If you still want us.",

        "John: Yes.",
        "Dr. Wright: All right. So Natalie, if you'll just sign in here, then we can get started.",
        "Natalie: Sure. Oh, my sister's here?",
        "Dr. Wright: Yeah. Her and her fianc\u00e9 had their first sonogram today, just like you two.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Everything okay?",
        "Dr. Wright: Yeah. Of course. No need to worry. Come on.",

        "Starr: Yeah. Right. Thank you.",
        "James: So did you and Cole kiss and make up? Okay, you obviously don't want to talk about it. Starr, look, I'm--I'm sorry. I don't know what the rules are here.",
        "Starr: Well, that makes 2 of us. It just seems like every time Cole and I talk, we have to apologize for something, and then by the time we're done with that, we find 10 more things to apologize for, so...",
        "James: People fight.",
        "Starr: Some more than others.",
        "James: Well, I mean, that's better than nothing, right? You like biology, so what's that thing that animals do? It's-- fight or flight?",
        "Starr: Yeah. That's not just animals. People do it, too.",
