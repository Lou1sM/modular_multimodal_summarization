        "John: Hey, it's McBain. Can you meet me at the precinct to go over your work? Just call me when you get this.",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Blair: Are you leaving me already?",
        "John: Not until I hear from Fish.",
        "Blair: Kind of seems like it would be a waste just staring at the ceiling while we wait.",
        "Blair: Well, I certainly hope Mr. Fish is as busy as we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Good morning.",
        "Marty: Good morning.",
        "Todd: I didn't mean to wake you.",
        "Marty: No, that's okay. I'm glad to be awake.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah? More bad dreams?",
        "Marty: I did have a very vivid dream last night. You were in it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: We're back, John.",
        "Talia: Commissioner.",
        "Antonio: Damn it's good to see you where you belong.",
        "Bo: Right back at you.",
        "Talia: It's really good to see you back.",
        "Bo: Thank you. Now, the question is, how am I supposed to be an effective commissioner in a department where we're minus two of its finest? Now, I understand you got fired --",
        "Talia: Yeah.",
        "Bo: And you've taken an extended leave of absence. What is it, a family emergency? Carlotta's diner?",
        "Talia: Um, family emergency -- mine. If you can call him that.",
        "Bo: Him? Who?",
        "Talia: You haven't heard anything?",
        "Bo: Apparently not.",
        "Talia: It's a really long story.",
        "Bo: Well, you know what? I happen to have some time on my hands, so why don't we start at the beginning?",
        "Antonio: All right, well I guess that would be when Ramsey assigned us to guard the crown jewels of Mendorra.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I know about that. And I know that Ramsey engineered the whole heist and then he forced you to be part of it.",
        "Talia: I'm sorry about all that.",
        "Bo: It's not my problem any more.",
        "Antonio: The thing is, Ramsey got played.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I figured that when he got murdered.",
        "Antonio: Well then, I guess you know that you're related by marriage to the recently deposed fake crown princess of Mendorra, the one and only Tina Lord?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Morning, Auntie T.",
        "Tina: Good morning, Jess -- I mean, Tess. I was just --",
        "Tess: I know what you were just doing. You were trying to steal the jewels back. See, Jessica was the dumb one. She would have called the FBI by now. But me, I just changed the combination.",
        "Tina: You can't blame a girl for trying.",
        "Tess: Mm.",
        "Tina: So, what are you going to do? Fence the jewels in Center City?",
        "Tess: No, I think I'm just going to make sure that you and your little rat-dog never get your paws on them again.",
        "Tina: You never told me that that was part of the deal.",
        "Tess: Well, I'm telling you now. If you ever want to see those rocks again, you'll keep your mouth shut about Natalie and me.",
        "Tina: Speaking of Natalie, what are you going to do to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Natalie's voice: Hey, this is Natalie and you've reached my cell. Guess I must be in the middle of something. But leave me a message and I'll call you back as soon as I'm free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Where the hell am I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You had a nightmare about me?",
        "Marty: Why would you assume it's a nightmare?",
        "Todd: Well, you said it was about me.",
        "Marty: Yeah. No, actually it was a good dream. Every night I close my eyes and I wonder what kind of memories are going to come back to me. You know, good or bad. Is it going to stay with me in the morning? Is it going to be real? But last night, for the first time, I dreamt about the future and it was really, really good.",
        "Todd: That's good.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Too good. Too good to be true.",
        "Todd: Why do you say that?",
        "Marty: What we talked about yesterday, in the light of day, it's like a fantasy. You, me, the baby on an island in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Todd: It's not a fantasy. Do you what it to be a fantasy?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Todd: Good. Oh, hey, by the way, I was thinking about what we talked about last night and your concerns about it being impractical. The schools and health care and all that. And I thought maybe California or Canada would be more practical.",
        "Marty: Are you sure that Starr does not want to see --",
        "Todd: Yes, I am sure. As I told you, she is concerned about its welfare and wants it to have a good home and be loved. Uh, but she wants to live her life as a teenager. She'll be fine with it.",
        "Marty: All right. I know you said you thought I'd be a good mother, but --",
        "Todd: Uh, you know what? I'm not going to argue with you or try to convince you about it. If you don't want to do it, that's fine.",
        "Marty: No, no --",
        "Todd: I thought this would happen -- I thought you'd wake up and change your mind.",
        "Marty: What I was saying is that I know that having a child is a big responsibility and I can't just concentrate on the joy of all of that. I need to be practical. If I'm getting involved with this little person, I'm thinking of it as a lifetime commitment. And you and I - huh? -- Well, we don't know what we have.",
        "Todd: I thought we could kind of discover that as we go along, one day at a time.",
        "Marty: Oh, you know --",
        "Todd: That's how I do things.",
        "Marty: It's very appealing, but not when there's a child involved. Sorry. Besides, I think -- I think this will be a lot harder for you than you think. And it will certainly be a lot harder than it is for me.",
        "Todd: How so?",
        "Marty: Because of what you're going to be leaving behind. Your kids, a marriage, a whole lifetime. As far as I know, there's absolutely nothing keeping me here in Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Whoa.",
        "John: Yeah",
        "Blair: [Sighs] Okay. Were you planning on sneaking out this morning, Mr. McBain?",
        "John: Who, me?",
        "Blair: It's okay, I know that this case is important to you.",
        "John: You're important, too.",
        "Blair: And they say that you are closed off to the world, that you give so little of yourself.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Blair: No, I don't mean that in a bad way. It's all right to protect yourself. There's a part of me that -- well, I feel like I don't really know you at all. And then there's another part that feels like I know the most important things there are to know about you.",
        "John: Is that a good thing?",
        "Blair: To me it is. When I'm with you, I don't worry about the future and I certainly don't dwell on the past. I just enjoy now. And I hope now lasts a very, very long time.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Blair: You better get it.",
        "John: Fish, what's going on?",
        "Oliver: Sorry I didn't pick up when you called earlier. I was at the library.",
        "John: The library?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, studying the software manual for the video enhancement program to see if there's a way I could maybe speed things along.",
        "John: Is there?",
        "Oliver: Well, according to what I read, the program is a lot faster than I thought.",
        "John: So what's the status?",
        "Oliver: I don't know. I haven't checked yet. But it could be that we have a picture of your mystery woman as we speak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: So answer me. What are you going to do to your sister?",
        "Tess: Oh, she's not my sister. Not anymore.",
        "Tina: Oh my God, no. You've already done something to her. I mean, more than drugging her and locking her in a room down in the basement?",
        "Tess: Well, I couldn't have done it without your help, Auntie T. Don't worry; she's right where we left her.",
        "Tina: How could I not worry? I mean, what are you trying to do? Make her suffer the same way you did when you lost Nash?",
        "Tess: Not possible.",
        "Tina: Then what?",
        "Tess: Hmm, a whole bunch of none of your beeswax.",
        "Tina: Look, I know you think this is going to make you feel better, but have you really thought this thing through?",
        "Tess: That is frigging hilarious coming from you.",
        "Tina: Look, Natalie is your twin sister, and Jessica loved her. I mean, one of the people you're going to hurt the most is yourself.",
        "Tess: You know, that is so deep. But I have to go ahead and disagree with you.",
        "Tina: Well, how long do you think she can survive in there, all alone? I mean, honestly Tess, do you want her to die?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: All right, where's my phone? I, uh -- had it. I was talking to Jared. I was having tea with my sister.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Just drink your tea, okay?",
        "Natalie: Jess, you don't understand. I was totally afraid I was going to lose you.",
        "Tess: I'm not going anywhere. Drink up, though. Okay? Finish it. It'll make you feel better.",
        "Natalie: Why is that the last thing I remember, having tea with my sister? What the hell is going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Listen, do not wait for me, all right? Check on the program and call me back.",
        "Oliver: Well, I'm standing outside your office right now, but I can't get in. The door locked when I left last night and nobody else has the key.",
        "John: I'm on my way. I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: Don't. Good news?",
        "John: We'll see. Hey, look, don't feel like you have to rush out of here, all right? If you want to take a shower -- or I think there's some coffee in there.",
        "Blair: Okay, I'll take a shower.",
        "John: Okay, I'll see you.",
        "Blair: Okay. John, wait.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Blair: Um, you know I don't expect for you to talk to me about your cases, especially one that involves Todd.",
        "John: That's a good plan.",
        "Blair: But this woman, I mean, whoever she is, and if Todd's messing with her life, she doesn't know how lucky she is to have you as a guardian angel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Lowell: Open this door for me.",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor, but I don't have the key. Apparently nobody does but Lieutenant McBain.",
        "Mayor Lowell: It's Fish, right?",
        "Oliver: Yes, sir.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You don't work here any more.",
        "Oliver: No, sir.",
        "Mayor Lowell: So what's an officer from Cherryvale PD doing so far out of his jurisdiction?",
        "Oliver: Um, I miss the job. I was hoping to talk to the commish about coming back.",
        "Mayor Lowell: Then why are you standing outside of Lieutenant McBain's office?",
        "Oliver: I thought that he was still the acting commissioner.",
        "Mayor Lowell: No, that would be Bo Buchanan this week.",
        "Oliver: Oh, gosh. Well, I guess I'll go find him then.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You know, this shouldn't be this difficult.",
        "Man: No, sir.",
        "Mayor Lowell: And it wouldn't be if you hadn't allowed McBain to sign for the evidence in the Ramsey case.",
        "Man: I can't apologize enough.",
        "Mayor Lowell: You're right, you can't. Now find someone to open this door, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Not hungry?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Todd: I'd like you to peek under this, if you would.",
        "Marty: [Giggling] What?",
        "Todd: Just do it.",
        "Marty: What is this?",
        "Todd: It's a piano book. It's a little simplistic, but the guy at the store said it would be a good refresher.",
        "Marty: Wait a minute, I used to play?",
        "Todd: Yes, you did. Sorry I didn't remember sooner. You actually used to teach.",
        "Marty: I did?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Marty: How do you know?",
        "Todd: You taught my niece, Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh my God, that's it. You want Natalie dead.",
        "Tess: Well, she did murder my husband.",
        "Tina: Well, then why don't we call the police? Let them punish her. I mean, they can do this a whole lot better than you can.",
        "Tess: My argument wouldn't really hold up in court.",
        "Tina: Yeah, it wouldn't. You know, maybe because she's innocent.",
        "Tess: Innocent? Her and her boyfriend pushed Nash to the edge. Maybe not with their hands, but with their lies. They lied and lied and lied. And if they hadn't, Nash would still be alive. He would still have his vineyard and we would still be living in our cottage together.",
        "Tina: And what about all your lies? What, they're okay?",
        "Tess: Oh, you should talk, lady.",
        "Tina: And what about Nash? How does this help him? I mean, he and Natalie were friends.",
        "Tess: You weren't there. You don't know.",
        "Tina: Yeah, well I know that Jessica loves Natalie.",
        "Tess: Well, Jessica's dead, now isn't she? That's the only good thing that came out of all this.",
        "Tina: All right, Tess, well what are you going to do if you get caught? Because you know, I figured it out. And as you constantly tell me, I am not the sharpest tool in the shed.",
        "Tess: Pardon me.",
        "Tina: And what about Nash? How do you think he would feel if the mother of his children would have to spend the rest of her life in jail?",
        "Tess: Temporary insanity. And you should know all about that, huh?",
        "Tina: Listen, I know I've done a lot of awful things in my life. But I am not just going to sit back and watch my niece die.",
        "Tess: Oh, you don't even know her.",
        "Tina: Well, I know what you're planning to do to her. So I know what I have to do. So I know what I have to do.",
        "Tess: Who are you calling?",
        "Tina: I'm calling my old friend, Bo Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You're really Carlo Hesser's daughter?",
        "Antonio: You haven't read the newspapers?",
        "Bo: I've been a bit incommunicado.",
        "Talia: Commissioner, I'm really sorry. But when I first came to Llanview, I knew how everybody felt about him. I feel the same way. But I just didn't want everybody judging me because of what he did. I'm sorry, I should have told you. I should have told Antonio.",
        "Bo: Well, I don't like being judged by who my father was. And I won't do that to anyone else.",
        "Talia: Thank you, sir.",
        "Bo: I know what it's like to live in your father's shadow.",
        "Talia: Well, your father, whatever he did, he's not like mine.",
        "Bo: Well, we each make our own decisions. We travel in our own path.",
        "Antonio: That's what I told her. Nobody knows better than me.",
        "Bo: Carlo Hesser -- [Sighs] is in Mendorra",
        "Antonio: Yeah, and the justice system there doesn't seem too forgiving.",
        "Bo: I can't believe that Ramsey sprung him from Statesville.",
        "Talia: Yeah, well it better not happen again.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Talia: I hope he stays in prison for the rest of his life. So he can never hurt anyone that I care about ever again.",
        "Bo: So, Talia is back. What about this leave of absence?",
        "Antonio: I'm ready to come back to work, sir.",
        "Bo: Good, good. It's about time this department got back to normal.",
        "Sarah: Uncle Bo, something terrible has happened to Cristian.",

        "Oliver: Bad news.",
        "John: The program didn't work?",
        "Oliver: Well, I don't know, but the mayor's here and he wanted in your office, and I'm really sorry.",
        "John: For what?",
        "Oliver: Well, somebody must have seen me leaving last night. You know, tipped him off that something was up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: That was so sweet of you.",
        "Todd: Yes, I'm a sweet guy. I just thought that even if you couldn't remember how to play, that your hands would. Your unconscious would, or whatever.",
        "Marty: Okay, you're starting to sound like a shrink, too.",
        "Todd: I'm saying that, you know, I haven't thrown a football in fifteen years but I bet if I picked one up that my brain would remember how to do it even if my arm was out of shape. What do they call that?",
        "Marty: Muscle memory.",
        "Todd: Right, muscle memory. Yeah, I just think that if you sat down at a piano you'd probably remember how to play. I mean, you hum to yourself all the time.",
        "Marty: I do?",
        "Todd: Oh yeah, same song, too. The uh -- what's that called? Well, it goes, uh -- um --",
        "[Hums]",
        "Marty: [Laughs] \"F\u00fcr Elise.\"",
        "Todd: You see?",
        "Marty: Yeah. I don't know if I can read music.",
        "Todd: I don't know, either. Why don't we find out? I wonder what's going on up here.",
        "[Marty laughs]",
        "Todd: That's curious. What's this?",
        "[Object sliding on floor]",
        "Todd: This is strange.",
        "Marty: Oh my -- what did you do?",
        "Todd: I don't recall this being in here.",
        "Marty: [Laughing] Whoo-hoo. Let's see, let's see.",
        "Todd: Look at this.",
        "Marty: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Todd: Voila.",
        "Marty: Why thank you. Ah.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I was -- it's -- you know what? Here's how I justify it. Janet would say it was occupational therapy.",
        "Marty: Wow.",
        "Todd: How's it feel?",
        "Marty: It feels weird.",
        "Todd: I bet it would play better if you plugged it in.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Oh, Auntie T, you do know that Bo is the police commissioner again, right?",
        "Tina: Duh, that's why I'm calling him.",
        "Tess: Okay, well, if you're going to rat me out, you might as well go ahead and tell him about what you've done. Because I'm going to totally tell him.",
        "Tina: You know, I know that Bo will understand why I took the jewels once he learns the circumstances.",
        "Tess: Oh, the circumstances. Okay, lets talk about the circumstances. You have stolen the crown jewels of Mendorra, therefore committing fraud in two countries and putting your daughter's life at risk, and many of Llanview's finest at risk, as well. So I'm going to have to go ahead and say, related or not, Bo's going to put you in jail with a whole bunch of scary, horny women. Are you ready for that? You know, Tina, you're kind of acting like you forgot about our little arrangement. And I know you're little slow, so I'll remind you of it, okay? You don't tell anybody that Jessica and Natalie are M.I.A. and I won't have to be forced to tell the people of Mendorra, Cain Rogan, Jonas what's-his-name, and Carlo Hesser that you have Mendorra's national treasure in my wall safe. Because I think they're all going to be a little P.O.'d about that, don't you? And, who knows, they might come after you. And, oh my God, what about poor little Sarah? So are you sure you really want to call Uncle Bo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: What happened to Cristian?",
        "Sarah: I don't know. Have you heard from him?",
        "Antonio: No, not yet. He hasn't called you?",
        "Sarah: No, I fell asleep waiting for him last night. And when I woke up today, he wasn't there. I can't get any information from the airline, and when I tried to call both of you, your phones were off. And Cristian's cell phone is going straight to voice mail.",
        "Antonio: Okay. All right. I'm going to call my mom, all right?",
        "Bo: Sarah, please, sit down. Where did you last see Cristian?",
        "Sarah: At the New York airport.",
        "Talia: The four of us were flying back from Mendorra and he got bumped to a later flight.",
        "Bo: Okay, well?",
        "Antonio: No, she hasn't heard anything either. But I didn't want to worry her, so I just told her that, you know, we got our wires crossed.",
        "Sarah: You're worried now, aren't you?",
        "Talia: Look, maybe he just decided to fly back today.",
        "Sarah: No, he would have called me. Where is he? People don't just disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: All right. You win. I'm not going to put my daughter's life in danger again. So I'm not going to call Bo.",
        "Tess: Ah, good move.",
        "Tina: For now. But I swear, if you so much as think about killing Natalie --",
        "Tess: [Laughing] Relax, I'm not going to kill her. That would be too easy for her. Although when I am done with her, she will be begging me to put her out of her misery.",

        "Jared: Natalie, it's me. I've tried your cell like a million times since I got to Colombia. Why aren't you picking up? Are you screening my calls? Look, I know you didn't agree with me coming down here. You think I'm doing your father's dirty work. But I owe him, okay? I owe your whole family. And I know we've already been through this before, but it is true.
