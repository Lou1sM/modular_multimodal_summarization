        "Blair: You're a surfer.",
        "Ross: Yeah, I generally don't read when I surf. Come on, Blair, it's a--it's a 12-hour flight. Why don't you get to know me a little?",

        "Sergei: Then you would be lying. You see, you and your brat are far from okay.",
        "Starr: Don't hurt my baby.",
        "Sergei: You blocked all the windows?",
        "Kiril: They're all covered, except for this one.",

        "Matthew: Look, Mom, I'm really sorry about what T\u00e9a did to Rachel. I didn't know she would go off on her like that. Rachel wasn't even supposed to be a witness. It wasn't planned or anything. And you know me; I wouldn't do something like that.",
        "Nora: No, you wouldn't sweetie, but T\u00e9a Delgado would. You wanted a shark that would go after Daddy and me for not letting you have the surgery, and that's what you got. Thanks for sticking around, though.",
        "Matthew: I didn't want you to go to jail.",
        "Nora: Well, that's a good thing.",

        "T\u00e9a: I was an attorney, and you were a witness.",
        "Rachel: Uh-uh, honey, you don't get to crawl under that rock. You used intimate details of my life, details that you know about because, stupid junkie that I was, I used to believe you were a friend.",
        "T\u00e9a: I have to use whatever I can to help my clients.",
        "Rachel: You think Matthew's case was helped by hearing that trash about me?",
        "T\u00e9a: You started this, Rachel. You were the one who stood up in court in the middle of Greg Evans' testimony. Why the hell did you do that?",

        "Greg: It was a circus.",
        "Vivian: A 15-year-old kid sues his own parents to make a medical decision. It was bound to get ugly.",
        "Greg: Oh, not like that. Rachel Gannon ended up in the middle of it and got shredded for no good reason. She didn't deserve that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, obviously you and Greg have a thing.",

        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",
        "Rachel: No, not okay. It's the truth. There's nothing romantic between us. Nothing.",

        "Rachel: You don't know anything about it.",
        "T\u00e9a: I wouldn't assume to know anything about it. You're, uh... you're dating Shaun, right?",

        "Blair: No. I need you sober.",
        "Ross: Oh, you need me. That's so sweet.",
        "Blair: Okay, listen, this whole point of bringing you back to Llanview--in fact, why don't we just go over the details?",
        "Ross: Okay, details. I'm 6'2\". Pisces. Which is the sensitive sign, you know. I barbecue pretty much anything--",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. I can't believe you just told me your sign. You've been on that island way too long. You're way too lonely.",
        "Ross: All right, what details would you like to talk about?",
        "Blair: What we just need to have everything together when we land. We don't want to leave anything to chance, all right?",
        "Ross: That sounds like a lot of fun.",
        "Blair: No. There can't be any surprises, Ross. Except for the one that actually hits T\u00e9a when everything blows up around her.",

        "Rachel: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: When Greg started talking about how Nora and Bo were afraid of taking risks, you went ballistic. It wasn't about you. Why did you make it about you?",
        "Rachel: I am not on the stand, Delgado, so just leave me the hell alone.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I'm sorry I had to be so hard.",
        "Rachel: Huh. No, you're not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I didn't choose to make you the issue. You did that when you stood up in the middle of Greg Evans' testimony. You have to own that.",
        "Rachel: I do! I do.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, something is bugging you, and it's not just me and how awful I am and all that. You know, you were right. We used to be friends.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, a long time ago.",
        "T\u00e9a: Huh. I miss that.",
        "Rachel: Ha ha! Funny way of showing it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Rachel: You know what? Maybe I needed today to happen to shake me up. Show me what I was doing, playing it safe.",
        "T\u00e9a: You weren't playing it too safe in court today.",
        "Rachel: No. And now my relationship with Shaun is trashed because of it.",

        "Todd: Ah, there were 3 that I saw, and they had accents.",
        "John: Sergei.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's the name I heard.",
        "John: You sure they took Starr and the baby?",
        "Todd: Well, I didn't see it, man. I was passed out by the time they did it. Next thing I know, I was in the closet. That was when I came to. You know, you put my kid in danger when you put Cole undercover, and the mayor's gonna have your job for this.",
        "John: The mayor got arrested.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "John: He was the inside contact on the whole operation.",
        "Todd: Oh, God...",
        "John: What?",
        "Todd: I went to Lowell. I told Lowell about Cole. I tipped him off. Damn it.",
        "John: Not smart, but he already knew.",
        "Todd: How?",
        "John: Somebody tipped him off before you got there.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but I gave up Starr and the baby's location. He asked me where they were.",

        "John: Go to the hospital, Manning.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "John: You've been shot.",

        "Todd: I'm staying here.",
        "John: Why, Manning?",

        "Lowell: You expect me to thank you for that? It's my right.",
        "Nora: You know what, Stan? I don't want you to worry about a thing. We're gonna do everything by the book, I promise you, 'cause we want to make sure that you rot in jail for all your lovely things. For the kickbacks and racketeering and drug trafficking and attempted murder. Wow. The whole 9 yards.",
        "Lowell: It's just a terrible misunderstanding. I won't sue you for wrongful prosecution since you're under stress, but I will not do one day of time.",

        "Sergei: Ha. And what trouble will you make?",
        "Starr: Think I'd risk my baby's life? Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea what she's been through in her life? I wouldn't put her in danger. I'm her mother. She'll just sit with me. I promise.",

        "T\u00e9a: What? Why would drug dealers--",
        "Todd: Because John McBain put Cole undercover to try to catch these thugs, and they found out about it, and they went after Starr instead. And they said they were gonna call, but...",
        "T\u00e9a: Good Lord. Are you all right?",

        "Greg: No, it's not. I was wrong about Rachel. She's got a lot of things going on right now, and, um, I don't think my brother understands exactly what's going on.",
        "Vivian: That makes two of us. Look, I'm sorry that I assumed, but if you're free and think you have a night free, maybe we should--",

        "Doctor: No, not with this much blood. This guy doesn't have much time to spare, so let's go. After you hang the blood, get me two more lines: One in the other arm and one in the groin. This guy needs volume now or we are going to lose him. Somebody try to find a family member. Let's get some history on this guy before we go to the O.R.",

        "Todd: Your tax dollars at work.",
        "[Todd inhales sharply]",
        "Todd: John McBain is such a moron. Yeah, that's a terrific idea. Let's put an 18-year-old kid in the middle of a bunch of drug dealers, try to bust them up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it looks like it worked.",
        "Todd: Yeah, they got shook up all right, all the way up to the mayor apparently.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that why the mayor was arrested? I just caught a second of it in the car on the way over.",

        "Cole: No. No. I saw him get into a car once at the park when he thought that I was already gone. It was a black SUV, tinted windows, but it was too far to see the license plate. And besides, there must be a million of those in this town.",
