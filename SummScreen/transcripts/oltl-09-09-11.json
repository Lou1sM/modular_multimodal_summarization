        "Sebastian informs Starr that he sent in their musical demo and got an offer from a music producer. It looks positive to both of them until Rick the porn producer walks into the house uninvited and informs them that he is their producer. They first tell him they want nothing to do with him but later realize that they don't have many options knowing how competitive the music recording business is. Tomas comes by to tell his son he knows he gave his father up to the cops. Besides Tomas and original Todd, there is also suspicion cast upon both Rex and Brody. Echo is haunted with the possibility that her son lied to her about killing Victor Lord. She takes the gun in her purse and sits alone at the flea market when Roxy catches her. She informs Roxy that they both need to protect their son. Roxy offers to hide the gun and puts it inside her stuffed porcupine. Cutter attends the flea market with \"good intention\" to buy some stuff for himself and Aubrey while still poor and purchases the porcupine unaware of what's inside of it. When Roxy and Echo discover it's gone, they freak. Natalie admits to Brody that Victor's secretary informed her that she overheard Brody making death threats and telling Victor that he cannot let him ruin Brody's life with a \"secret\", she asks him what is up with that. He is confident that she will never know the truth about Liam and shows her the gun that he has. When John is alone in his office, Shaun Evans comes by unexpectedly and tells him he thinks he can shed some light on who killed Victor Lord."

        "Kim: I know I'm delinquent on payments. Your collection agency made that very clear. I'm sorry. You can't! You can't just throw someone out of a hospital because of money. It's the law. No, no, no, please, don't do that. Look, I'll get the money to pay for her care. Yes, I have a payment plan. I'm working on it right now.",

        "Aubrey: You're leaving already?",
        "Cutter: I'm the assistant manager.",
        "Aubrey: Did you get a promotion?",
        "Cutter: I'm the assistant manager when my boss is gone.",
        "Aubrey: There's nothing wrong with being front desk clerk.",
        "Cutter: No, no, no. I'm moving up. He's like this close to a breakdown. I figure one or two well-placed bedbugs will push him over the edge.",
        "Aubrey: Too bad we've gone straight, though, right?",
        "Cutter: This wouldn't be stealing.",
        "Aubrey: It's scamming.",
        "Cutter: No, no, it's Mother Nature showing us who's boss. And it would work. Aubrey and I did it before. Original Aubrey.",
        "Aubrey: Your sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Mm! Nigel. Long time no see. You look amazing.",
        "Nigel: Ms. Andrews.",
        "Kim: In the flesh. I'm here for Clint. Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo's voice: There's a bullet missing. This gun's been fired. Rex was lying.",
        "Echo: When did you fire this gun, Rex? Please, God, tell me it wasn't to kill Victor Lord.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: James, no. You don't have to skip work. I-- I'm ok, really, but you are going to be at the funeral tomorrow, right? Ok. Thanks. That means a lot to me. I love you, too. Hey.",
        "Baz: What's this?",
        "Starr: Getting pictures together for the memorial tomorrow.",
        "Baz: Are you sure you're ok?",
        "Starr: Just wish they would make an arrest.",
        "Baz: That could be happening right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You're sure? No. No, that's it. Thanks.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I got your message.",
        "John: Thanks for coming down. Have a seat.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: This gonna take long?",
        "John: Depends. Where were you the night Victor Lord was killed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I thought this might wake us up. Teething doesn't last forever, does it? I mean, it can't. Natalie?",
        "Natalie: What? Oh, no, I mean, it just seems that way.",
        "Brody: You all right? What's going on?",
        "Natalie: Ok, I just have to come out and say it.",
        "Brody: What?",
        "Natalie: Victor Lord's secretary came by the station yesterday, and she had some information.",
        "Brody: Yeah? What'd she say?",
        "Natalie: She said that-- she said she overheard you threaten Victor Lord's life on the day of the murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: It doesn't matter, Rex. I'm your mother. It doesn't matter what you did. But I have to get rid of this.",
        "Roxy: Get rid of what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: I'm gonna hit the flea market before work. You got anything you want to unload? Like that yearbook?",
        "Aubrey: You can't sell this.",
        "Cutter: Why are you looking at that?",
        "Aubrey: I ran out of magazines.",
        "Cutter: Where'd you even get it?",
        "Aubrey: Rama lent it to me. I wanted to know more about the original Aubrey. I've been curious about her ever since I gave up being plain, old Christine.",
        "Cutter: Nothing plain about you, babe. Unlike my sister here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Mr. Buchanan is not receiving guests.",
        "Kim: But I'm not a guest. I'm family.",
        "Nigel: For one mercifully brief interlude, but no longer.",
        "Kim: Admit it. You missed me, Nige.",
        "Nigel: If you'd like to leave a message for Mr. Buchanan--",
        "Kim: You'll be sure to lose it? Nige, you don't want to play it this way. Clint and I are very close. We're bonded.",
        "Nigel: Much like a tapeworm and its host.",
        "Kim: Hey. No need to call names. You know, I've always hated that ever since I was a kid. Just ask--",
        "Nigel: Whom would we ask, if we cared to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: So what was Aubrey like? You never talk about her.",
        "Cutter: Nothing to talk about.",
        "Aubrey: Do you miss her?",
        "Cutter: Honestly, I try not to think about her.",
        "Aubrey: Why not?",
        "Cutter: Why are you suddenly so concerned about Aubrey?",
        "Aubrey: Rama said some things.",
        "Cutter: Like what?",
        "Aubrey: Like she found Aubrey at the Spotted Pony after she stole Rama's money.",
        "Cutter: That's weird.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah. She just blurted it out, and then she tried to take it back, saying she had never been there, never seen you or Aubrey there. It's like she was hiding something.",
        "Cutter: Weird.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah, see? You do that, too. Like you don't want to talk about it.",
        "Cutter: There's nothing to talk about.",
        "Aubrey: Then why does it feel like everyone's keeping a secret from me? Cutter, did you and Aubrey do something at the Spotted Pony that you don't want anyone to know about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Why are you staring?",
        "Nigel: I'm attempting to picture you as a child.",
        "Kim: Can you just tell Clint I'm here?",
        "Nigel: I have strict instructions from Miss Natalie to refuse you entrance.",
        "Clint: Too bad she doesn't live here anymore.",
        "Nigel: Sir--",
        "Clint: I decide who I see. Kimberly, come on in.",
        "Kim: Thanks, cowboy. You know, I'm hungry. I would love breakfast. You remember my usual.",
        "Nigel: Ah, yes. Fresh blood and babies' tears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: What, are you spying on me?",
        "Roxy: You're talking out loud in public, honey. Anybody can hear you.",
        "Echo: I gotta watch that. So what is all of this?",
        "Roxy: Flea market day. And I got a primo position because my hotel is on Angel Square.",
        "Echo: Well, lucky you.",
        "Roxy: Hey, hey, not so fast. See anything you like?",
        "Echo: I have to ask. Isn't that your front desk clerk?",
        "Roxy: Ha ha ha! Yeah--Morris. Yeah, we've been together a long time, but times are changing, and I'm a little low on cash. So 100 bucks from you, and we can keep it in the family.",
        "Echo: Yeah, well, I gotta go.",
        "Roxy: Wait a second. Wait a second. This is the best part. Look. He's even got a secret hiding place.",
        "Echo: I really don't have time for this.",
        "Roxy: Wait a second. You know, I'll get rid of whatever that thing is in there if you buy Morris.",
        "Echo: What?",
        "Roxy: Whatever that thing is in there that you so desperately want to get rid of, I'll sell it for you.",
        "Echo: No. You can't.",
        "Roxy: Come on. Come on.",
        "Echo: Why don't you stop--",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You're asking for my alibi for Victor's murder?",
        "John: I'm asking where you were that night.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I thought you liked Todd for the murder.",
        "John: You don't want to tell me where you were?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I was with my son.",
        "John: Really?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah. Ask him yourself.",
        "John: We already talked, and his story about what happened that night is a little different from yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You told John McBain about your dad?",
        "Baz: I had to.",
        "Starr: No, you didn't.",
        "Baz: The way Tom\u00e1s acted that night? He lied to me, and he was off.",
        "Starr: Ok, you don't know him that well.",
        "Baz: Anyone could've seen it. He was nervous. The guy's ex-CIA. Do you think a flat tire would really set him off like that?",
        "Starr: So you really think that your dad shot my uncle?",
        "Baz: I don't know. It could've been your dad, too.",
        "Starr: Oh, great. So it's your dad or mine? No. No. It had to have been someone else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: This woman said what?",
        "Natalie: She said that you came to see Victor, and she heard loud voices, so she slipped back into the room, and she heard you say to Victor if he did anything to destroy what you have, he's a dead man. Is any of that true?",
        "Brody: I was there. I went to see Victor.",
        "Natalie: About what?",
        "Brody: What was on Marty's tape.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That was out of line, McBain.",
        "John: What was?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You don't bring in my son for questioning without telling me.",
        "John: He's over 18.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: He doesn't know his rights.",
        "John: You know, I would think you'd want your son to cooperate with a murder investigation.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: If that's what happened. But if you interrogated him without counsel--",
        "John: He's not a suspect.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You should've notified me when you hauled him in here.",
        "John: No one hauled anyone in. He came to see me.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah? What did he say?",
        "John: Well, he told me his version of what happened that night. Now it's your turn. Where were you when Victor was killed? Because you weren't with your son.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I was late.",
        "John: Right. Right. You blew out a tire so bad that it knocked out your cell phone service, and it took you hours to fix.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Well, when you put it like that...",
        "John: I believe that's the way he put it.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: He's pissed off at me.",
        "John: Yeah. It's a lousy lie. You want to revise your story?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Thank you for checking in on me, but I have to get ready for the memorial.",
        "Baz: I know. And I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't important.",
        "Starr: You didn't come to check in on me.",
        "Baz: The producer who liked our single? He called back.",
        "Starr: Can this wait a few days?",
        "Baz: I know you're going through a lot right now, but his A&R guy's in town today and he wants to meet us.",
        "Starr: Then you go.",
        "Baz: You're sure?",
        "Starr: Yes. I'm sure. Go to the meeting.",
        "Baz: I won't commit to anything without you.",
        "Starr: I know. I trust you. We both feel the same way about music, and we both don't want our song being ruined by some hack.",
        "Rick: There they are. My new pop stars. You two look hot together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Look, I hate to tell you, but your buddy Rama's a little off.",
        "Aubrey: Yeah? How?",
        "Cutter: She's a total flake, and she loves to create drama.",
        "Aubrey: So is there any drama?",
        "Cutter: Why are you so suspicious? Don't you trust me?",
        "Aubrey: I don't trust anyone. Occupational hazard. I mean, come on. Do you?",
        "Cutter: I'm trying.",
        "Aubrey: I know. I'm trying, too. I know you're trying hard, which is why this feeling sucks!",
        "Cutter: Which one is that?",
        "Aubrey: That you and Rama are keeping something from me. I mean, come on, Cutter. How is this gonna work if we can't even be straight with each other?",
        "Cutter: Aubrey, you're asking questions about a rough time in my life. Before you and I hooked up, I did some things that I wasn't proud of, and some of them were at the Spotted Pony.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: [Gasps] Scones. You make the best scones, Nige.",
        "Nigel: I'm British.",
        "Kim: That explains it.",
        "Nigel: We also have a certain talent for beheadings.",
        "Clint: Nigel, ahem, there's a flea market at Angel Square today. Maybe you can fill out your antique button collection.",
        "Nigel: I would never leave you unattended.",
        "Clint: We'll be fine.",
        "Kim: I'll take care of him.",
        "Nigel: That's what I'm afraid of. I'll have my mobile if you require assistance.",
        "Kim: Man, you'd think I'd shot the guy's dog the way he treats me.",
        "Clint: He's very protective. He's been watching after our family for years and years. It's his mission in life.",
        "Kim: He thinks I'm that big a threat?",
        "Clint: Everybody thinks you're after my money.",
        "Kim: That's crazy.",
        "Clint: Yeah, it is. Yeah, we both know I don't have any. So, Kimberly, what are you really after?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Why did you ask Victor about Marty's tape?",
        "Brody: You said Delphina told you Victor knew something about it, right? That was bugging you?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but you told me it was nothing, and that I didn't need to talk to Victor.",
        "Brody: I know. Look, I don't believe in Delphina's powers but I know that you do, so I decided to take a run at Victor, see what he knew.",
        "Natalie: What did he say?",
        "Brody: He swore he didn't know anything about the tape.",
        "Natalie: That's it?",
        "Brody: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Then why did you threaten to kill him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Too slow, Savoy.",
        "Echo: This isn't a game, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Don't let my size fool you. You don't want to mess with me.",
        "Echo: Just give me the gun.",
        "Roxy: What are you doing packing heat?",
        "Echo: Keep it down.",
        "Roxy: I have zero tolerance for weapons in my hood.",
        "Echo: Ok, fine. Then just give me the gun, and I'll be gladly on my way.",
        "Roxy: Oh, excuse me. Countess DiBogus is walking around with a 9 millimeter gun that the cops are looking for.",
        "Echo: No, no, no. That's not the gun they're looking for. No.",
        "Roxy: Victor Lord was killed with a 9 millimeter gun.",
        "Echo: It's a very common gun.",
        "Roxy: You killed Victor Lord.",
        "Echo: I did not, you nitwit.",
        "Roxy: Oh, no. It's sprawled all over your face. And I can call Johnny McBain. I bet there's a little reward.",
        "Echo: Listen to me. I didn't kill Victor Lord. Our son Rex did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Rick Powers?",
        "Baz: Walk away, man. You're not welcome here.",
        "Rick: Hostility?",
        "Baz: After what you did to my cousin Dani?",
        "Rick: That was Nate, A.K.A. Buster Ridge, who did or not do your cousin.",
        "Baz: You've been warned. Get out.",
        "Starr: Why are you here?",
        "Rick: I am here to make your dreams come true. This is not, by the way, the best meet and greet.",
        "Baz: Rick Powers, A&R?",
        "Starr: The label sent you? How did you find us?",
        "Rick: Everybody knows La Boulaie. Wow. The films you can do here.",
        "Baz: Why would the label have you?",
        "Rick: I used to score movies before I started directing. I know music, and I definitely know marketing. That's what sold the label. The \"Vicker Man\" premiere just got their attention. They trust my instincts. The single is a little rough, but I know I can work with it. I got a feeling about you two. Note to self: New spin-off. \"Hold the Microphone.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: So what did you do at the Spotted Pony?",
        "Cutter: Aubrey and I ran scams. I picked marks, she'd get close to them, just like you and me.",
        "Aubrey: This chick got cash out of men?",
        "Cutter: No. She didn't look anything like that. She used the money that she stole from Rama on a complete makeover.",
        "Aubrey: You mean surgery?",
        "Cutter: The works. She didn't look anything like that picture when she was done.",
        "Aubrey: So she was pretty?",
        "Cutter: Yeah. We were making total bank.",
        "Aubrey: So what happened then? Why would you stop?",
        "Cutter: People started to catch on, so we parted ways and took off.",
        "Aubrey: Why didn't you move on together?",
        "Cutter: It was safer to split up.",
        "Aubrey: And that's the last time you saw her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Ok, so I have this friend who--",
        "Clint: Hold on. This is one of those \"I have a friend\" stories?",
        "Kim: No, it's real. I have a friend who's in the hospital, and she doesn't have any health insurance, so I'm paying her bills.",
        "Clint: With what?",
        "Kim: I started working doubles at the Spotted Pony, but even with tips, it's not enough.",
        "[Clint groans]",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Clint: You're dancing again?",
        "Kim: Yeah. Surprised me, too. But I haven't met any other CEOs who wanted me to be their assistant. You're a good guy, Clint.",
        "Clint: I wish I could just write you a check.",
        "Kim: Forget it. I told you, that's not why I'm here.",
        "Clint: Then why?",
        "Kim: You're the smartest guy I know, especially about money, so I figured maybe you could help me invest.",
        "Clint: You have money?",
        "Kim: I told the hospital I was busted, but...",
        "Clint: But you have a little?",
        "Kim: I saved for a rainy day. You always said, takes money to make money. I just gotta make some money quick or else my friend could wither away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: It's crazy talk. Rex isn't a killer.",
        "Echo: Just forget it and give me the gun back.",
        "Roxy: Wait a second. What happened? If Rex is in trouble, then I gotta know that. You were talking so loud to yourself before. You can tell me.",
        "Echo: Rex always keeps that gun locked in a safe at the mansion.",
        "Roxy: So?",
        "Echo: But he took it out before. When he was gonna shoot Victor.",
        "Roxy: Yeah. You know that jerk. Everybody's wanted to kill that jerk one time or another.",
        "Echo: He took the gun to the movie premiere. He was going to kill Victor and Jack.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, but he didn't.",
        "Echo: So after Victor was murdered, I asked him if he'd changed his mind.",
        "Roxy: What'd he say?",
        "Echo: That he'd been at Gigi's grave the night of the murder, and that the gun hadn't been taken out of the safe. So I checked it later, and the gun had been fired.",
        "Roxy: Are you sure?",
        "Echo: Don't take that out here. Yes, I'm sure. Rex lied. The gun had been fired. Recently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yes, I should've called Sebastian when I got the flat.",
        "John: That's your story, and you're sticking to it?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I blew a tire. It happens. It was raining like hell, I slid, hit the median.",
        "John: That must've messed up your alignment.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Not as bad as it could have.",
        "John: So what'd you do?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I changed the tire. Took a while in all that rain.",
        "John: So you changed the tire, and you went to meet your son.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No. I stopped at the diner to dry off, I got a cup of coffee, and I ran into Sebastian there. That's why he's mad at me. I was supposed to meet him at Capricorn to hear some new tracks. He thinks I'm avoiding him.",

        "Natalie: \"If you destroy everything I have, you're a dead man\"?",
        "Brody: I could've said it. One thing Victor knew how to do was push people's buttons. But I didn't mean it.",
