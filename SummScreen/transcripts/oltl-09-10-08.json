        "John: What do you mean, \"Cris disappeared\"?",
        "Bo: He was supposed to come back on a flight last night from New York, and he never showed.",
        "Antonio: Sarah hasn't heard from him. Nobody has.",
        "John: And you're all on your way back from over there?",
        "Talia: From Mendorra? Yeah -- but Cristian got bumped to a later flight. Have you -- have you been filled in about everything that happened?",
        "John: About Hesser? Yeah, I heard. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "Talia: No friggin' way.",

        "Jared: Clint, what's going on?",
        "Clint: You better be in Bogot\u00e1.",
        "Jared: I'm here all right, about to meet with our guy.",
        "Clint: Let me know when it's done.",
        "Jared: Wait, Clint -- I found this guy in prison. Are you sure you want me to unleash him on Langston Wilde?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Great. Just rub it in a little more, why don't you?",
        "Langston: Rub what in?",
        "Starr: That you can wear that, and I have to do this.",
        "Langston: Okay, I'll make you a deal. I'll do that, if you help me with this.",
        "Starr: Okay, what is this?",
        "Langston: Finding my long-lost relative.",
        "Starr: What? I thought you didn't have any long-lost relatives.",
        "Langston: Well, if I do, it would be a miracle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I have no trouble siccing this guy on Dorian's foster daughter. If it brings Dorian to her knees and gets B.E. back in the family, I'm all for it. And you should be, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. I'm right. You're not Jess. You're Tess.",
        "Tess: Ha-ha. Oops. You got me. And not a moment too soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, Viki. I was going to call Bo. I was -- I really was. And then -- and then Tess told me she had my stash -- the crown jewels. But then I didn't even care, okay? I'd go to jail -- that's fine. I would happily go to jail if it would save Natalie. But then, Tess said she was going to call Carlo and Jonas and Cain -- everybody who hates me now, and she was going to point them right at Sarah. I couldn't let her do that. I couldn't put Sarah in danger, not again. And I -- I'm sorry, but then that leaves Natalie right at Tess' mercy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Can I tell you how honestly tired I was of pretending to be that wimp, Jessica, all the time? God, and acting like I had feelings other than total hatred for you.",
        "Natalie: So, this whole thing -- having Jared and me move in here, saying that you forgave us -- this was all a setup?",
        "Tess: That's right. And now that we're alone, sister dearest, the real fun can begin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Hey, Cole, quick question.",
        "Cole: Yeah, what's up, dude?",
        "Matthew: Cross-trainers, or basketball shoes?",
        "Cole: Basketball shoes? I thought you played soccer.",
        "Matthew: I'm trying to look cool tomorrow.",
        "Cole: Dude, you already look cool.",
        "Matthew: Don't start sounding like my mom. You know what time it is. Either I look cool tomorrow, or I'm going to get swirlied. I don't want to start my high school career with my head flushed down a toilet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Delphina insisted that my mom left someone behind in Colombia.",
        "Starr: And you believe her?",
        "Langston: Enough to check it out.",
        "Starr: Okay, Langston, even if she's not wrong, maybe she was talking about an ex-boyfriend or something. It might not exactly be a blood relative. Wouldn't your mom have mentioned one?",
        "Langston: Okay, look, I know it's a long shot.",
        "Starr: I just don't want you to get your hopes up, Lang.",
        "Langston: What, if it all turns out to be bogus?",
        "Starr: Well, yeah. Delphina is a psychic -- she's not a P.I.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, that's where you and me come in. I went online and I narrowed the search down to people with my mom's maiden name who live within a hundred miles of where she grew up. But it turns out Montez is a really common name, like Smith or something. So I called the hall of records in my mom's hometown, and they said it's going to take them a while to get back to me.",
        "Starr: Okay, but isn't there a search engine online that can narrow it down to people that are also looking for their family members?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I tried that -- nada. Nobody's looking for me. But -- maybe they don't know I exist.",
        "Starr: Look, are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Langston: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Starr: If your mom never mentioned this long-lost relative, maybe there's a reason.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Langston's uncle is in a supermax prison -- for murder, okay? You sure you want me to go through with this?",
        "Clint: Jared -- just do what you have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, no, this isn't possible. Jessica was integrated. I mean, you -- you were whole again -- you were fine.",
        "Tess: \"You were whole again, you're fine.\" And then the clouds parted, and the angels sang, and the whole world was at peace. Well, I like fairy tales, too, Natalie, but how about I tell you what really happened? You and your slimeball boyfriend, Jared -- you killed my husband, you know, the father of my babies. And then Jessica, your precious Jessica -- she ran and hid. And then I came back to make you pay.",
        "Natalie: It was an accident.",
        "Tess: \"It was an accident.\"",
        "Natalie: Jared and I -- we never meant to hurt you or Nash.",
        "Tess: You didn't hurt us, Natalie. You killed us when you killed Nash.",
        "Natalie: Listen to me, Tess. If you want me to suffer, I already am. You don't need to do this.",
        "Tess: You don't know what I need.",
        "Natalie: You need help.",
        "Tess: Well -- I don't think so, Natalie. You're the one that needs help.",
        "Natalie: Where am I?",
        "Tess: Well, this is a special room. I know it's probably not really your taste, but I had it built just for you.",
        "Natalie: Built where? What did you do -- you just drugged my tea, and you just dragged me off without anyone seeing?",
        "Tess: Well, the logistics of the situation don't really matter, but let's just say I learned from the best. Thanks, Mom.",
        "Natalie: Mom?",
        "Tess: Well, when she was Jean Randolph, you know, she locked Dorian up down here, and nobody found her for, gosh, a really long time.",
        "Natalie: Down here? In the Llanfair basement, that's where I am?",
        "Tess: Bingo. Natalie, you're really smart.",
        "Natalie: What are you going to do with me? You're just going to leave me here?",
        "[Tess sighs]",
        "Tess: You wish.",
        "Natalie: What does that mean?",
        "Tess: Actually, I'm going to settle the score.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I wish there was another explanation, Talia.",
        "Talia: No.",
        "Antonio: We have to consider the possibility.",
        "Sarah: Possibility of what?",
        "Bo: Hesser could be behind Cristian's disappearance.",
        "Sarah: No. No, I -- I can't believe this. We watched him get hauled away for fraud. He was begging for mercy.",
        "Talia: He is in that prison, Sarah. They had him dead to rights. Look, I said my goodbyes. I cut him loose. He could not have escaped from prison. He couldn't have left Mendorra.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Your daughter hates your guts.",
        "Carlo: We have a complex relationship.",
        "Cristian: She's going to be dancing on your grave when somebody else kills you.",
        "[Carlo laughs]",
        "Carlo: I'll win Talia back someday.",
        "Cristian: Dream on, Carlo. Dream on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Antonio, you were there. We completely neutralized my father.",
        "Bo: This is Carlo Hesser we're talking about. You said the Mendorran authorities put you off when you called them?",
        "Sarah: You really think he got away?",
        "Bo: Hesser's capable of reaching out from prison to get even. I'm going to see what's going on in Mendorra.",
        "John: I'll go make a few calls myself.",
        "Bo: Give me the Mendorran embassy, please.",
        "Antonio: I'm -- I'll go with you. I need something to keep me busy.",
        "John: Come on.",
        "Antonio: The minute I hear something I'll get back to you.",
        "Talia: I know -- go. I'm so sorry that I got you and Cris involved in this.",
        "Sarah: We got ourselves into this. And -- and we knew what we were getting into. I just thought once we were home in the states, we'd be safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Maybe my mom had a brother or a sister or a cousin that she didn't want me to know about because she was embarrassed.",
        "Starr: Okay, but, Langston, if she was so embarrassed, wouldn't she have said something to you, like, \"Thank God you never met my cousin Wanda because she used to pick her nose at parties\"?",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: And, look -- if she had a relative that she never talked about, that means that they probably did something really bad.",
        "Langston: Where are you getting this from?",
        "Starr: Well, the whole thing with my Aunt Dorian and Adriana's real father -- I mean, she kept him from Adriana because he was a major criminal.",
        "Langston: Okay, but having the truth kept from her -- Adriana's never gotten over it.",
        "Starr: At least she's alive to be pissed about it.",
        "Langston: All right, look. I promise I will be careful, okay?",
        "Starr: Look, Langston, I just want you to be safe, because -- well, I -- I like having you around as my foster cousin.",
        "Langston: I love being your foster cousin. I love this family, and I love Dorian. But I just -- I need to know if there is someone out there that I'm related to. You get that, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I mean, that's why I made the video for my baby.",
        "Langston: I was thinking of sending out a blanket letter -- not giving out too much information about myself, you know. Make the return address a P.O. box or something, and see if any of these Montezes knew my mom before she left Colombia.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I mean, if you did that it could totally work. And it would be really cool for you to find a relative.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: American? What do you want?",
        "Jared: Get you out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Are you going to kill me?",
        "Tess: Oh -- been there, done that. Hmm. Twice, actually.",
        "[Tess laughs]",
        "Natalie: How long have you been Tess? I mean, were -- was it right after Nash died? Were you the one who was at the funeral?",
        "Tess: Well, I really have to give credit where credit's due. That was all Jessica. She would have been satisfied, you know, blowing her stack at you a couple of times, and then finally forgiving you while you rutted around town with Jared. But I don't think she ever really would have gotten real revenge, you know?",
        "Natalie: That's because that's not who she is.",
        "Tess: Yeah, it's not. She also wouldn't ask you and Jared to move in with her because -- [As Jessica] She just really needed to have her family around her now.",
        "Natalie: So that was -- that was you, then.",
        "Tess: [As herself] And the award goes to --",
        "Natalie: You know, Jared knew something was wrong, and I made excuses for you.",
        "Tess: Oh, Natalie, you are a special sister. But as a daughter -- you kind of suck. Now, you almost killed Viki by convincing her to borrow your car to go to the cottage.",
        "Natalie: You caused that accident?",
        "Tess: Snip, snip -- bye-bye, Viki.",
        "Natalie: You're insane.",
        "Tess: And then when that didn't work, I spiked the risotto with a special sauce, and trust me, it was a killer.",
        "Natalie: But you couldn't let us eat it. You know, you swept the plates right off the table.",
        "Tess: Oh, come on, that was Jessica. She's such a wimp. She couldn't bear to watch you and Jared lap up a plate of pesticide, so she kind of -- she screwed that up for me.",
        "Natalie: Jessica will come back, and believe me, Tess, she will stop whatever it is you have planned for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: You want to get me out of here?",
        "Jared: That's right.",
        "Ray: You one of those bleeding-heart lawyers come to save the poor prisoner with D.N.A. evidence?",
        "Jared: Why, do you think you deserve saving?",
        "Ray: Nope.",
        "Jared: I didn't think so.",
        "Ray: Who are you?",
        "Jared: The name is Jeb Stuart. I'm here on a family matter.",
        "Ray: I look like a family man to you?",
        "Jared: You know this woman?",
        "Ray: Should I?",
        "Jared: She's your niece. Your sister Linda -- that's her daughter.",
        "Ray: Last time I saw my sister she was not much older than that. Wanted to help the people save the world. She was going to start with me.",
        "Jared: Looks like she had her work cut out for her.",
        "Ray: We had very little in common.",
        "Jared: Ahem.",
        "Ray: I have no interest in her or her daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: \"I'm the teenage daughter of Linda Wilde, formerly Linda Montez. My mother married my father, Broderick Wilde, and moved our family to -- \" what am I thinking? This needs to be in Spanish.",
        "Starr: Hey, Lang?",
        "Langston: Yeah?",
        "Starr: When I was complaining about how I look today, you didn't once try to argue with me.",
        "Langston: Oh, Starr, I'm -- I'm sorry. I guess I was just so into this I wasn't really listening to what you were saying.",
        "Starr: Oh, it's okay. But what I don't get is how Cole stopped by here last night, and you haven't once tried to tell me about it.",
        "Langston: I guess I was just kind of hoping you'd bring it up first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Well, I'm not exactly an expert, but from what I can tell, the thing that makes you cool is that you don't try so hard to be cool.",
        "Matthew: Well, how do you do that?",
        "Cole: Well, you know, you wear the clothes that you want, and wear the shoes you want, hang out with whoever you want, and don't give a crap about what anyone else thinks.",
        "Matthew: Easy for you to say -- you're going to be a senior. I'm going to be a freshman.",
        "Cole: You're Matthew Buchanan. All right, you're a cool, smart kid.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, who still looks like he's in middle school. If I don't do something now, I'm going to get beat up every single day.",
        "Cole: Where are you getting all this stuff from?",
        "Matthew: Myface. I have, like, 300 friends, and every day I read their news flashes. \"9:15, shoved in a locker. 10:30, swirlied. Noon, got my lunch money stolen.\"",
        "Cole: Okay, okay, listen. I still looked like a sixth grader when I went to ninth grade.",
        "Matthew: And?",
        "Cole: And I grew some, started playing sports --",
        "Matthew: All I play is soccer.",
        "Cole: Well, see? You're way ahead of the game, then. With all those David Beckham moves you got going on there.",
        "Matthew: Shut up.",
        "[Cole laughs]",
        "Cole: No, seriously, that's all you need to break the ice.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I'm sure hooking up with Starr probably boosted up your cool level.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Why were you hoping that I would mention Cole first?",
        "Langston: Well, because we had a long talk last night.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, what did he say?",
        "Langston: He talked about, you know, what he was going through, and that thing with Karen at the country club.",
        "Starr: What did he say, Langston?",
        "Langston: I was just hoping that he told you himself.",
        "Starr: Did something happen?",
        "Langston: Look --",
        "Starr: Did something happen with him and Karen?",
        "Langston: No, Starr --",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh, no, I knew that something was going to happen, because she was in her skimpy little bikini, and here I am all pregnant.",
        "Langston: Okay, time-out, time-out, time-out. Oh, my God -- okay. Nothing happened between Karen and Cole. Okay? Okay, well, that's kind of a lie, something did happen.",
        "Starr: See, I knew it.",
        "Langston: Not what you think, okay? Karen and her friends were so bimbo-y, and you were so you, that all Cole could think about was what you guys had. It just made him miss you even more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Okay, Natalie. Let's click your heels together three times. \"There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.\" Wait -- no Jessica to the rescue?",
        "Natalie: Mock me all you want. But my sister stopped you from hurting me before, and she will do it again.",
        "Tess: Oh, that was a fluke.",
        "Natalie: Uh-huh.",
        "Tess: Oh, it was. But if you want to sit there and wait for her to rescue you, you can be my guest.",
        "Natalie: Jess, please -- Jess, if you can hear me --",
        "Tess: Shh -- she can't, honey. I got rid of her, for good this time. But you know what? That dumb bitch did do me one really big favor, popping out one last time to save your sorry lives. Because let me tell you, death by risotto was way too painless for you. I am going to hurt you and Jared in a way that's going to last a lifetime. Just like you did to me and my babies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Why did you have to go to Africa now? I mean, Viki, couldn't the Mother Teresa thing just wait just a little bit? Because we need you here. Because if you were here, then none of this would have happened -- or even if it had, you would -- you would know how to save Sarah and me. I -- oh. Viki, I don't know what to do.",
        "Clint: Tina?",
        "Tina: Uh, Clint. Hi, I -- I didn't hear the bell.",
        "Clint: Viki gave me the keys. Is something wrong?",
        "Tina: Uh -- um, no.",
        "[Tina sniffles]",
        "Tina: No, uh, everything is great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: If you're not going to kill me, what is it that you are going to do? No, no -- no, please. You can't hurt Jared. You cannot kill Jared. No!",
        "Tess: Natalie, Natalie. Who said anything about killing anyone? Like I said, that would be way too easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlo: It might behoove you to examine your own dire situation before making assumptions about my daughter.",
        "Cristian: Fine. I'll behoove. But I'm not so sure my situation is all that dire.",
        "Carlo: Pray tell.",
        "Cristian: You see, I have people back in Llanview, people who care about me, including your daughter, who I'm sure is back on the police force already. And I bet you, right about now, she's wishing that she'd killed you already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I should've taken that bastard out. Who cares if he's my father? I would've been doing a solid for all of humanity.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlo: Talia would never hurt me. I'm not worried.",
        "[Cristian chuckles]",
        "Cristian: Well, you should be. Talia is a cop again and you know what that means.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I'm back on the force now. I can take him out, make it look legal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I bet Sarah's at the L.P.D. right now with her Uncle Bo and my brother. You see, it's all about family to me, Carlo, same as you. But my family is fighting to keep me alive. Everyone that knows you wants you dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I finally got a straight answer from the Mendorran authorities. They've still got Chamberlain, but Hesser bought his way out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Sarah knows there's nothing you can do to me that you haven't done before. Except kill me, of course. But if you were going to do that, I think you would have done it already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: The NYPD and the Port Authority gave us access to search the airport to see if we can't find something to tell us what happened to Cris.",
        "Antonio: I'm going with you.",
        "Talia: So am I.",
        "Bo: No, no -- you two are both too close to this case. John will handle it on his own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carlo laughs]",
        "Carlo: Bravo! Entertaining performance.",
        "Cristian: It's not an act. You can run but you can't hide, Hesser. Not for long.",

        "Jared: Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but Linda and her husband were killed in a car crash two years ago.",
        "Ray: And she left that kid?",
        "Jared: That's right. Langston. Langston Wilde. She is 16 years old, she --",
        "Ray: What does any of this have to do with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So Cole came over here because he wanted to see me?",
        "Langston: Well, he tried to act like the only reason he came over was to make sure we could still be friends.",
        "Starr: Well, what did you say?",
        "Langston: I told him you always come first with me. And then I pointed out that he could have just called instead of coming over.",
        "Starr: You did not.",
        "Langston: Oh, I so did. And then he straight up admitted to me that he was hoping that he would run into you.",
        "Starr: But he did see me and -- I guess he just couldn't -- he looked at me and then he just turned around and walked out.",
        "Langston: I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: No, I -- I guess you looking for these relatives that you could feel close to your mom, that's kind of like how Cole feels about this baby, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: I'm in here for life. What difference does it make if I have a niece? What can she do for me?",
        "Jared: Well, it's what I can do for you. I can get you out of here.",
        "Ray: So, the big Americano comes down to Colombia, pockets bulging with money to buy the convicted murderer out of prison. Now, why would he do that? What does he want?",
        "Jared: I want you to go to the United States and claim Langston as your niece.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So murder is definitely off the table.",
        "Tess: What I have planned for you is so much worse. You and Jared are going to break each other's hearts, just like how you broke mine. You'll be alive, yeah, but not together. And every second that ticks by, you are going to feel what I feel -- the unbelievable agony of not being able to be with the one that you love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: What happened? Are you crying?",
        "Tina: Oh. Oh, these are just tears of joy. I haven't seen you in so long, Clint.",
        "Clint: Yeah, it's nice to see you, too, Tina. But you are definitely upset about something.",
        "Tina: Uh -- yeah, I was just -- I was just thinking about how -- how much I miss -- I miss Viki. I mean, we had a conversation at the airport but it was -- it was very brief, and -- we -- we sure could use her help here.",
        "Clint: Why? Is something wrong with Jessica?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: How exactly do you plan on keeping Jared and me apart? Huh, Tess? I mean, with everything that we've been through to be together. I mean, and according to you, we turned our backs on our families and caused death and destruction. So we're just a force to be reckoned with. You know, I am truly, truly sorry for what I did to Jessica. But you? You're just an angry bitch with an axe to grind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: If being a freshman doesn't get me killed the first day, then putting my foot in my mouth certainly will.",
        "Cole: I'm not mad, all right?",
        "Matthew: Really?",
        "Cole: Really. I mean, I'm really lucky that Starr was into me. Now, I miss her but I'm okay. I'm not going to lose it if you talk about her.",
        "Matthew: What's going to happen tomorrow when we go back to school? You're going to have to see her every single day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Maybe me wanting to connect with my mom's family is a little like Cole wanting to raise this baby.",
        "Starr: It's a lot like it.",
        "Langston: Okay, but I think he's trying to get past that.",
        "Starr: How?",
        "Langston: Because we're going back to school, and you and Cole are going to be seeing each other every day. Maybe he'll realize he can forgive you.",
        "Starr: Why would he do that?",
        "Langston: Because last night I got the feeling that he was pretty close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look, I don't know what it's going to be like to see Starr every day. I mean, a part of me is dying to see her and the other part never wants to see her again.",
        "Matthew: Sounds like it's tough being you.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, it's tougher being a freshman.",
        "Matthew: This is you trying to make me feel better about tomorrow?",
        "Cole: Look -- look, I'd try wearing the right clothes, listening to the right music, hanging out with the right people, but you know what? There was always a group of popular kids that looked like they didn't even have to try.",
        "Matthew: So, what am I supposed to do?",
        "Cole: Just be yourself.",
        "Matthew: I want to be homeschooled.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I pray every night that Cole will forgive me. With going back to school, and after every class, going to my locker and him not standing there. I honestly don't know how I am going to do it. And then with this baby bump marking me the slut of L.H.S., it's just --",
        "Langston: Starr, you're not a slut.",
        "Starr: You should have seen the look on Karen's face, Langston. I don't know which was worse, her thinking that I'd gained a lot of weight, or realizing that it was a baby bump, which I don't even know what that means. It's just -- Langston, I -- I don't know how I'm going to go back to school. Especially -- especially without Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: You want me to adopt my niece.",
        "Jared: All you have to do is pretend to adopt your niece.",
        "Ray: Why?",
        "Jared: Well, to make the woman who's taking care of her now believe that she is going to lose her.",
        "Ray: You're a sick guy, huh?",
        "Jared: All you got to do is make the threat. The rest will take care of itself.",
        "Ray: And if I do that, I get a ticket out of jail and passage to America.",
        "Jared: That's right. We have a deal?",
        "Ray: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: She's fine. I mean, Jessica's not fine. But I'm looking after her, so she's as -- she's as well as can be expected.",
        "Clint: Oh. Well, thank you for taking an interest.",
        "Tina: Oh, it's -- it's no problem. I mean, we're -- we're family. So, family sticks together.",
        "Clint: Yeah, yeah, but we should, but lately, all I've been doing is dealing with the takeover. I mean, that's not an excuse. I'm Jessie's father and I need to step up. Is -- is she around somewhere?",
        "Tina: Uh, no, no. She is in the -- the shower.",
        "Clint: Oh. Well, then I'll wait for her.",
        "Tina: Well, can I get you anything?",
        "Clint: Oh, no. No, thank you. I'm fine.",
        "Tina: All righty, then, I'll just head on out.",
        "Clint: Don't you want to catch up or something?",
        "Tina: Oh. Yeah, I mean -- of course I do.",
        "Clint: Tina, are you nervous about something?",
        "Tina: No. No.",
        "Clint: Cord told me that he saw you.",
        "Tina: He did?",
        "Clint: Yeah, he said that the two of you had a nice talk and that you're trying to take on a more -- well, a more hands-on approach with Sarah.",
        "Tina: Yeah. Well, it's about time, don't you think?",
        "Clint: Yeah, and it must mean the world to Sarah.",
        "Tina: Yeah. Well, you know, I'm not exactly mother of the year yet. But -- but I'm really trying.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Still, it's far better than the schemer who once covered for Niki Smith.",
        "Tina: Why would you bring that up now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ooh, Natalie's getting tough.",
        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "Tess: Channeling her inner street fighter. Well, let's see how tough you are when you have to break up with Jared.",
        "Natalie: Like hell.",
        "Tess: Hmm, that's exactly how its going to hurt -- like hell.",
        "Natalie: You know what, Tess? You can keep me locked up here for the rest of my life, and I will never, ever leave Jared.",
        "Tess: Oh, but you already have. He just doesn't know it yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: How many times do we have to go through this little routine, Detective Vega?",
        "Antonio: With all due respect, sir, but if it comes between my family and this job --",
        "Talia: Look, I'm not going to let my father destroy any more lives.",
        "John: We've a lot of ground to cover in New York.",
        "Bo: Get out of here. Find your brother.",
        "Talia: Thank you.",
        "Antonio: Thank you, sir.",
        "Talia: We'll get Cristian back here as soon as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So what are you going to do until they find me? Torture me? Try to brainwash me again, hmm? Bring it on! Come on!",
        "Carlo: Thanks for the invitation, but it isn't necessary. All I want to do is punish you and your brother and Sarah for turning Talia against me.",
        "[Ship's horn sounds]",
        "Carlo: Almost there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared is never going to believe that I'm breaking up with him.",
        "Tess: Oh, yeah, because you're love's too real, too strong, too whatever.",
        "Natalie: It just is.",
        "Tess: Until it ain't, Natalie. And that happens when I say so. So, uh, enjoy your scrapbook because memories are all I have left of Nash. And they're all you have left of Jared.",
        "Tess: Oh, I love peaches.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I know what it's like to be locked up in a prison cell day after day with nothing but pushups and dreams to keep you going.",
        "Ray: You've been inside?",
        "Jared: I got out. But you, you're looking at, what, another 40 years of this? And you'd rather do that then help me out. Guess you are as dumb as you look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You want to know how you're going to face the first day of school, and all the other ones after that until you have this baby? You're going to do it with me right there by your side. Okay? I switched all my classes so that I can arrange to be in all of yours. All those bitches and wannabes, they're not just going to have to deal with you, they're going to have to deal with me, too.",
        "Starr: I really don't know what I would do without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Matthew, Matthew, wait up. Wait, look, all you really need to do is figure out what electives you want to take and what clubs to join, that's all.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but what if a bully wants to --",
        "Cole: A bully is not going to beat up on you.",
        "Matthew: How do you know?",
        "Cole: Because I won't let them.",
        "[Matthew scoffs]",
        "Cole: What are you talking about? Get -- get out of here.",

        "Starr: Okay, we better get these letters out before Aunt Dorian gets home.",
        "Langston: Oh, yeah, I don't want to hurt her feelings.",
        "Starr: Okay, you give me that list and I will start writing on the envelopes while you stuff. Okay?",
        "Langston: You're the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: This is Colombia. Just because I'm in prison doesn't mean I can't reach out and touch you anytime I want. My life in here is not so bad, you know? You got to come up with something big if you want me to play uncle to that pretty young girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Cristian bought this for me when we were at the airport leaving Mendorra. I know it's really tacky but it was -- he'd remind us that we could get through anything.",
        "Bo: Cristian is tough. And he's smart. And he is going to figure a way to get through this.",
        "Sarah: I hope so.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlo: You and Antonio left me to rot in a foreign prison, so I'm just returning the favor. I'm taking you to Colombia. A place called Plato. Ever hear of it, hmm? What? What? What? What? What! No matter. You'll come to know it very well over the years. In the meantime, I'll give you a taste of the kind of treatment you can expect in your new home.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah? I eat guys like this for breakfast. Is that all you got, huh, Hesser? Is that all you got?",
        "Carlo: Enjoy!",
        "Cristian: Is that all you got? Is that all you got?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You're in no position to play hardball, Mr. Montez. You either take the deal or you don't, but decide fast. Because I want to get out of this godforsaken place and get home. I have someone waiting for me.",

        "Natalie: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm sorry if I offended you but all I'm saying is that I'm glad we don't have to wonder anymore if everything you say is a lie. You -- you have to admit that you were a handful for quite some time.",
        "Tina: Yeah, I -- I know.",
        "Clint: But now you seem to be turning yourself around.",
        "Tina: Clint, I can't do this. I can't. I feel so bad.",
