        "While Shaun is in the hospital and in critical condition, everybody waits outside. His parents come by and admit that he talks about Rachel all the time and Destiny tells them all about Matthew and the surgery Greg can do in order to make him walk. Sergei and his men still keep Starr and baby Hope in an abandoned warehouse. But Bo, John, Fish and Brody hustle to save them. Fish is able to trace Starr's cell phone. Brody brings Asher in and demands that he spills whatever he knows. And they get closer. But Sergei makes his demands and tells them he's not afraid to kill Starr and her baby. Ross comes home with Blair and each has a deal and a demand for the other. Stacy and Kim scrounge to find ways to get her pregnant so that she can hang on to Rex. But Rex and Gigi tell Stacy that they need to come with her to her doctor's appointment. Kim is determined to help Gigi with her plan even though she is not pregnant. But Gigi also has a plan. She goes into the empty apartment and discovers a home pregnancy test that Stacy put in the trash."

        "T\u00e9a: You're up and you didn't wake me up?",
        "Todd: You seemed like you needed to sleep.",
        "T\u00e9a: I want to be with you, Todd.",
        "Todd: Why should we both worry?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because you're my fianc\u00e9. Your worries are my worries.",
        "[Vacuum runs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Who's that?",
        "Todd: L.P.D. sent them.",
        "T\u00e9a: Any word?",
        "Todd: From who? The cops or Blair?",
        "T\u00e9a: You still haven't heard from Blair?",
        "Todd: I left her a million messages, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Very nice digs...",
        "Blair: This stupid thing!",
        "Ross: It's called recharging. You should give it a try.",
        "Blair: On a plane from Tahiti?",
        "Ross: Well, you're home now. So, um, does my room overlook the pool?",
        "Blair: You might say that.",
        "Ross: That's a cabana. Are you -- what do I look like, a towel boy?",
        "Blair: Look, nobody can see you until I say so. Otherwise, it'll ruin the plan. Now, why don't you go unpack, cabana boy? I'm gonna go check on my kids.",
        "Ross: Uh-uh-uh-uh. First, you tell me I get to stay in a big house with the rich folk. Then you can go say hi to the kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You want me to get you some breakfast?",
        "Cole: No. I'm not hungry.",
        "Marty: You need to eat something.",
        "Cole: Starr and Hope have been with Sergei and his goons all night. You think they got breakfast?",
        "Marty: But Starr's tough and she's smart and...",
        "Cole: She must be so scared.",
        "Marty: Well, probably, you know, but she's a mother now. Mothers stay strong for their children's sake.",
        "Cole: Is that what you're doing?",
        "Marty: Hey, I'm scared, too. But I believe what John said, that he's not gonna let anything happen to Starr and Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Brody. Thanks for coming.",
        "Brody: What's up? I figured you wouldn't need me once you had the mayor in custody.",
        "John: You see the paper this morning?",
        "Brody: You guys have been here all night?",
        "Bo: Uh-huh. Starr and Hope Manning were kidnapped.",
        "Brody: Starr, Jessica's cousin?",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brody: That baby...",
        "Bo: That we knew as Chloe.",
        "John: Couldn't get to Cole, so he took the next best thing.",
        "Brody: Has he said what he wants?",
        "Bo: He wants money and a plane.",
        "John: And he wants to take Starr and the baby with him for insurance.",
        "Bo: Now, we have to pinpoint Sergei's location, and we have to get in there without him knowing about it. Now, you have dealt with Sergei. Plus, you know, your training as a Navy Seal, you have combat experience. We could use you on the team.",
        "Brody: Anything you need.",
        "Bo: You'll have all the backup you need.",
        "Brody: It seems like Sergei doesn't have a problem with hurting people.",
        "Bo: Well, he beat the hell out of Todd Manning just for trying to help his own daughter.",
        "John: And he opened up big Shaun for trying to do the same thing.",
        "Brody: Did Shaun die?",
        "Bo: No. But we don't know if he's gonna make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Shaun was a real hero last night.",
        "Man: Were you with Shaun?",
        "Rachel: My mother told me what happened. She's the D.A. Her ex-husband's the police commissioner.",
        "Woman: The paper said that Shaun tried to stop someone from kidnapping the Manning girl and her baby?",
        "Rachel: Even after he was shot, he didn't give up.",
        "Woman: Oh. People are always saying how proud we must be of Greg.",
        "Man: Shaun never calls much attention to himself.",
        "Woman: And he puts his life on the line every day. And until something like this happens, no one notices that -- including me and his father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Thanks for everything you did last night.",
        "Jay: No, we're not done yet.",
        "Greg: I've asked radiology to give another once-over. I want to make sure that we didn't miss anything.",
        "Jay: You think that's necessary? I gave him a pretty good once-over on the table.",
        "Greg: I just want to make sure that we didn't miss anything.",
        "Jay: Listen, your brother's had one hell of a night. I mean, you know how messy gunshot wounds are. He's on strong antibiotics, but he still has to fight off the infection, add to that the fact that he almost bled out on the table. Shaun has a lot of the battle left to fight. Why don't you wait till morning to send him down to x-ray?",
        "Greg: He's my brother.",
        "Jay: I know. But until he wakes up, he's not out of the woods.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Let me guess: That was Stacy saying she's really sorry but she can't make her ob-gyn appointment.",
        "Rex: Ding, ding, ding.",
        "Gigi: Why did she make such a big deal about getting her own doctor if she's never gonna go?",
        "Rex: She's going. I need to make sure the baby's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Rex is gonna be in, like, a half-hour.",
        "Kim: Calm down. Have a bowl of cereal.",
        "Stacy: Huh? He's making me go to my doctor's appointment.",
        "Kim: So go.",
        "Stacy: And let him find out I lost his baby?",
        "Kim: He's not gonna find out anything. You slept with good old Officer Fish, remember?",
        "Stacy: That doesn't mean I'm pregnant.",
        "Kim: Only one way to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So what was her excuse this time?",
        "Rex: Morning sickness.",
        "Gigi: And last time?",
        "Rex: Oh, the old crap about how she hates doctors and needles.",
        "Gigi: She really does seem to be stalling.",
        "Rex: I know. You'd think she'd want to take care of this baby.",
        "Gigi: True, especially since she thinks it's her ticket to getting her hooks into you. So maybe there's another reason she's avoiding having the doctor check her out.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Gigi: Maybe little Stacy isn't pregnant after all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I can't take a home pregnancy test. It's too soon.",
        "Kim: Read the box.",
        "Stacy: Okay, what if it comes out negative?",
        "Kim: Would you stop stalling?",
        "Stacy: The only way I'm gonna get Rex back from my sister is if he thinks I'm actually having his baby.",
        "Kim: And he will. I mean, the guy's name is Fish, isn't it? I'm sure his boys can swim.",
        "Stacy: I don't know.",
        "Kim: Well, pretty soon you'll have a little guppy of your own. Now go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey!",
        "Asher: Dude, you got busted, too?",
        "Oliver: Shut up.",
        "Asher: You didn't say anything, did you?",
        "Marty: Hey, just ignore him. Just ignore him.",
        "Asher: We both keep our mouth shut, right? Dude, we're brothers in this.",
        "Cole: We're not brothers in anything!",
        "Asher: Hey, lay off!",
        "Marty: Cole --",
        "Cole: Hey, your old buddy Sergei kidnapped Starr and my baby. Know anything about that? Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You think this is some kind of vacation here?",
        "Ross: What, because I want running water and solid walls?",
        "Blair: This from a guy who lived in a hut on a beach.",
        "Ross: You want to remind me why I'm not on my hut on the beach right now?",
        "Blair: Because you're here to surprise your lovely wife T\u00e9a.",
        "Ross: Right. Who thinks she's divorcing me, even though she never told anybody we got married.",
        "Blair: Well, Todd thinks that whatever he and T\u00e9a have got going is better than anything he's ever had in his life. Let me tell you something. He's gonna blow a gasket once he finds out that she's been lying to him from the get-go.",
        "Ross: Yeah, but you're gonna wait to tell him until after you drop those charges against me, right?",
        "Blair: Don't you think about pulling anything funny here, Ross, because my next call will be to John McBain. Got it?",
        "Ross: Yes. The ex-husband cop.",
        "Blair: Former FBI agent. So you better cooperate. Otherwise, you're gonna go to prison for trying to kidnap my kids.",
        "Ross: This is not the deal we made.",
        "Blair: Oh, but this is the deal we got going now. Understood?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: God, Blair, turn on your damn phone.",
        "T\u00e9a: I doubt she's turned it on in the last 10 seconds.",
        "Todd: You know what? I'm gonna call Bo, and then I'm gonna light a fire under John McBain.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, why don't you just let John do his job?",
        "Todd: What is he waiting for?",
        "[Line rings]",
        "Todd: Sergei and his boys didn't have any problem shooting me. They nearly killed Shaun. I don't think they're gonna wait an extra minute to take out Starr and Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Come on, bro. Time to rise and shine. Remember how Mama used to say that to us every morning? How much we hated it? She's here now, along with Dad and Destiny, and Rachel, too. She's been here all night. Hey. Hey, how you feeling?",
        "Shaun: Like hell.",
        "Greg: Yeah, I believe it.",
        "Shaun: What happened?",
        "Greg: You got shot.",
        "Shaun: I know. What happened to Starr and Hope?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Jeez. Manning seems to think that he can do our job for us.",
        "John: Is he coming down?",
        "Bo: He won't if he has any sense.",
        "John: Then again, we are talking about Manning.",
        "Brody: These warehouses -- they're off the docks?",
        "John: Yeah. Starr and Hope are in one of them. We just got to figure out which one.",
        "Brody: Does he got enough men to put guards on each building?",
        "John: He had 2 guys with him at Manning's.",
        "Bo: Yeah, they were heavily armed.",
        "Brody: Did you talk to them?",
        "John: Sergei will be calling back to see if we meet his demands.",
        "Brody: Have you?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Bo: Buchanan.",
        "Sergei: I don't like waiting.",
        "Bo: Look, we've been up all night, Sergei.",
        "Sergei: Do you have my plane ready, or do I kill the pretty mother and her baby?",
        "Bo: The plane is being prepped at Llantano airfield.",
        "Sergei: That is not ready.",
        "Bo: How are Starr and Hope?",
        "Sergei: Alive. We got food for the baby, but the clock is ticking.",
        "Bo: I can't let you leave with them, Sergei.",
        "Sergei: If I let them go, why would you give me what I want?",
        "Bo: Well, you do them any harm, you're not gonna get what you want either.",
        "Sergei: You don't take my word?",
        "Bo: No.",
        "Sergei: I will free the girls when I arrive at my destination. Tick-tock.",
        "[Line disconnects]",
        "Bo: Are we ready to move?",
        "John: Yeah. How did he get food for the baby with us watching the area?",
        "Bo: I don't know. But thank God he did.",
        "John: All right. We should have footage of the warehouses by now.",
        "Bo: Okay, is Coast Guard ready with underwater?",
        "John: And aerial.",
        "Brody: You're not really giving Sergei a plane?",
        "Bo: We're just trying to buy time. As soon as we get Intel on that warehouse, we're going in. We'll get Starr and Hope out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So what's it gonna be? Jail or the cabana?",
        "Ross: I will unpack...",
        "Blair: Oh, that's a good move.",
        "Ross: Just as soon as I get something to eat.",
        "Blair: What? Excuse me?",
        "Ross: Excuse me. I've -- all I've done is eaten 10 hours worth of airline food. Come on.",
        "Blair: Aw, you poor baby. Well, you know what? I'll fix you something to eat after I see my kids. Unpack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You can't go to the police station. What if the kidnappers call here?",
        "Todd: I can't just sit here and do nothing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Would you rather sit in jail? Because that's what's gonna happen if you get in John and Bo's way. Look, I know you're scared. But it's not gonna help matters, anyway, by going down there, okay? Where are you going, gimpy?",
        "Todd: Blair's room.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why?",
        "Todd: Some clue as to where she is.",
        "Blair: Yoo-hoo! Anybody here?",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair?",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a? Where are my kids?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, the -- the boys are with your mom in New York.",
        "Blair: What, did Todd move you in the second I left?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, he's been trying to reach you.",
        "Blair: What, he's gonna tell me that the two of you are engaged?",
        "T\u00e9a: No.",
        "Blair: Well, I'd be blind not to notice the big rock on your hand.",
        "Todd: Blair? Where the hell have you been?",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, Todd. Well, what happened?",
        "Todd: I got a bit of bad news to relay to you.",

        "Destiny: Have you heard anything about Starr and her baby?",
        "Matthew: My dad will find them.",
        "Destiny: I know he will. It was really sweet of you stay here all night.",
        "Matthew: After all the time you spent with me in the courtroom?",
        "Destiny: Hospitals are different.",
        "Matthew: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Look, don't worry about Starr and Hope. You just get better. That's an order.",
        "Shaun: You're my doctor?",
        "Greg: I wish I could take credit. It took half this hospital to put you back together last night.",
        "Shaun: Humpty Dumpty.",
        "Greg: No. More like the six million dollar man. Hey, you up for seeing Mom and Dad and Destiny?",
        "Shaun: And Rachel?",
        "Greg: Yeah. She's with them, too. She's getting a big old dose of Mom and Dad right about now.",

        "Mrs. Evans: Oh --",

        "Mr. Evans: As beautiful, too.",
        "Rachel: Shaun -- he talked about me?",
        "Mr. Evans: You're the first woman our boy has been serious about in a long time.",
        "Greg: Shaun's awake, and he's talking.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Does that mean...",
        "Greg: Well, he's still critical. But this is good news.",
        "Mr. Evans: Can we see him?",
        "Greg: Just for a few minutes. Don't tire him out.",
        "Mr. Evans: Okay, okay.",
        "Matthew: Why don't I get you something to eat?",
        "Destiny: You don't have to.",
        "Matthew: It's not a problem. I already know where all the vending machines are on this floor anyway.",
        "Destiny: Thanks. Rachel, aren't you coming?",
        "Rachel: Oh, family first.",
        "Mrs. Evans: You are one gracious lady.",
        "Greg: How are you doing?",
        "Rachel: Not good.",
        "Greg: He's out of the woods.",
        "Rachel: Do you know how I found out Shaun had been shot? I was on my way to see him so that I could break up with him.",

        "Rex: You don't think Stacy's really pregnant?",
        "Gigi: I wonder. It's not like she hasn't faked medical results before.",
        "Rex: I was there when they took the blood for the test.",
        "Gigi: The whole time?",
        "Rex: I was there when the doctor gave her the results. She's pregnant.",
        "Gigi: Right. You're right.",
        "Rex: I wish I wasn't.",
        "Gigi: It's just she's been so weird about her OB appointments.",
        "Rex: Are those appointments scary?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Rex: They're not, like, 9 months of needles or something?",
        "Gigi: Maybe it's one needle she's scared of. She knows we want a paternity test, right?",
        "Rex: She swears I'm the father.",
        "Gigi: And we're gonna believe everything she swears to?",
        "Rex: Let's go.",

        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Blair: So what happens now? Do we just pay the ransom?",
        "Todd: There is no ransom. These aren't kidnappers, they're drug dealers.",
        "Blair: Well, what were drug dealers doing taking Starr and Hope?",
        "T\u00e9a: They wanted to get to Cole.",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "Todd: You remember is famous community service?",
        "T\u00e9a: Apparently he was working for the Llanview police department trying to infiltrate a drug ring.",
        "Todd: Yep. And McBain never bothered to tell us. Your idiot ex-husband devised this brilliant plan to keep Cole out of jail. The only problem was that these drug dealers found out about it. They tried to kill him. Well, they couldn't, so they took Starr and Hope. And now that idiot has put our granddaughter's and our daughter's lives at risk with his stupid plan. And I swear to God, if anything happens to them, he's gonna have to answer to me, that's for sure.",
        "T\u00e9a: They're gonna be all right.",
        "Todd: You don't know that.",
        "T\u00e9a: I believe that to be true.",
        "Blair: Well, how long have they been gone?",
        "Todd: Since last night. And where the hell were you?",
        "Blair: I, uh, had a -- a business trip. Ahem.",
        "Todd: What about your phone?",
        "Blair: Lost its charge.",
        "Todd: Where were you really?",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, listen. It doesn't matter, okay?",
        "Blair: No, what matters is that you let our daughter and our granddaughter be kidnapped.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd did everything he could to try to protect them, including getting himself shot!",
        "Blair: My God, Todd, you were shot?",
        "T\u00e9a: And beaten and tied up.",
        "Todd: Of course. I mean, I would've done anything to protect Starr and Hope. You know, Shaun almost did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Don't ever do that again.",
        "Mr. Evans: You don't like your brother playing hero?",
        "Destiny: Not if he's gonna make me worry this much. I'm gonna be nicer to you from now on.",
        "Shaun: I'll hold you to that.",
        "Mr. Evans: We heard you were a real champ, son. You protected that girl and her baby with everything you had.",
        "Shaun: But I could've --",
        "Mrs. Evans: You did a good job, baby.",
