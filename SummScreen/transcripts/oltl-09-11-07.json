        "Dorian: I'll get it.",
        "Starr: It's ok. I will --",
        "Dorian: I've got it. Langston.",
        "Starr: Hey, I was starting to worry.",
        "Langston: Oh, sorry. The bus took forever. I -- I sent you a text. Didn't you get it?",
        "Starr: Well, I was charging my phone. Langston's sleeping over.",
        "Dorian: Again? No -- you're welcome anytime, but isn't tomorrow the first day of school?",
        "Langston: Well, my parents' flight got delayed, so they won't be in till tomorrow night.",
        "Starr: Come on, Langston, let's go.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Clint: Hello?",
        "Dorian: I'm so --",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Clint: Something I said?",
        "Dorian: I -- I -- I didn't see you there.",
        "Clint: Oh. Dorian, is something wrong?",
        "Dorian: Actually, there may be something wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Starr, if you don't tell me this minute --",
        "Starr: Ok, ok, I will, I will. I just had to make sure that my aunt can't hear us. This is so top secret, nobody knows about it, not even her.",
        "Langston: Will you just say it already?",
        "Starr: Ok. You know the baby that my Dad went to Chicago to find?",
        "Langston: Yeah, what about him?",
        "Starr: He's coming home. He's alive.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God, Starr, that's so awesome!",
        "Starr: I know! No -- do you know what the best part is about it?",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: My family can really come together as a family now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lewis: You heard my client. Produce the child.",
        "John: You know, Manning, I don't think you're in any position to make demands. You busted out of your cell, you assaulted a guard.",
        "Lewis: There were extenuating circumstances.",
        "Todd: You're damn straight there were. Your honor, my son was kidnapped, and this man, John McBain, of the Llanview Police Department, led a conspiracy to keep the truth from coming out.",
        "John: You don't know what the hell you're --",
        "Todd: And they were all involved -- John, Marcie, Michael, Rex, Blair \u0096",
        "Lewis: Mr. Manning, let me take care of this, ok?",
        "Todd: No, no one's going to take care of this. I'm the one getting screwed over here. So what the hell are you going to do about this, judge? And when am I going to get my son back?",
        "Marcie: Oh, God, Mike, please, just promise me that we're not going to lose our son, that Todd can't take him away. Michael, you have to promise me that, please! Please promise me, Michael. I can't --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Langston's parents are definitely clueless, given that they never, ever call to check on their daughter or verify that she's here.",
        "Clint: Oh. Well, maybe they're calling her directly. I mean, she has a cell phone, I assume.",
        "Dorian: Well, of course. Hmm. Ok, I admit, I don't know exactly how often they're in contact with her, but you would think they'd want to be here tonight, I mean, when she's about to start a whole new year at school.",
        "Clint: Where are they?",
        "Dorian: Out of town, apparently.",
        "Clint: Oh. Maybe they have a good reason.",
        "Dorian: They better have a darn good reason for not being here when their daughter's feeling so apprehensive and nervous.",
        "Clint: Now, did Langston actually say that she was apprehensive and nervous?",
        "Dorian: No, but still, see, the first day of school tomorrow?",
        "Clint: Dorian -- yeah, yeah, it's good that you're concerned about the girl, but you be careful.",
        "Dorian: Of what?",
        "Clint: Well, how should I put this? Your girls are doing very well now. I mean, Cassie's got this life in Savannah, and Kelly's happily raising her son in -- in London. Blair is doing very well right here in Llanview. Adriana has a new career and a boyfriend that she's crazy about. And Starr -- well, she's healthy and just a good kid.",
        "Dorian: And? Are -- are you inferring that because my girls apparently don't need me right now, I'm looking desperately around for someone who does?",
        "Clint: I wasn't going to go that far, but I do know that you like to be a part of your girls' lives.",
        "Dorian: Ha-ha! Are you implying that I like to interfere?",
        "Clint: I didn't say that. I didn't even think it.",
        "Dorian: Well, I can tell you something. I have no intention of interfering in Langston's life in -- in any way, shape, or form.",
        "Clint: Well, good. There you go.",
        "Dorian: But she's a very, very nice girl. A special kid. I mean, she's been such a good friend to Starr, and if she ever did need me --",
        "Clint: Dorian --",
        "Dorian: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: A baby brother -- that is so cool. Will you be spending a lot of time at your dad's to help and stuff when the baby comes?",
        "Starr: Well, I'll baby-sit, but I do still have a life.",
        "Langston: Totally. I mean, your dad probably won't let him out of his sight, anyway.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you know, my dad is like that. Gosh, he gave me and Cole such a hard time about being together. He's way overprotective. You're so lucky that your parents didn't give you and Markko a hard time.",
        "Langston: They would if they knew about it.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? You haven't told them that you're dating?",
        "Langston: Oh, why would I? Me and Markko aren't serious.",
        "Starr: You seem serious to me.",
        "Langston: Sometimes I like him, but I don't know if I could stand him being in my face all the time.",
        "Starr: But you did say that he's a good kisser, though.",
        "Langston: Yeah, he is a good kisser. But you know, sometimes he gets these ideas which he thinks are so smart, but they're, like, so stupid. I just hate how stubborn he is.",
        "Starr: Yeah, gosh, that stinks. He's just -- he's so determined.",
        "Langston: And full of himself. On and on about what a great athlete he is, an awesome dancer -- blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",
        "Starr: Oh, and he's so confident.",
        "Langston: And obnoxious.",
        "Starr: Hey -- hey, hey, I'm just saying you seem very much into him.",
        "Langston: Yeah, well, not as much as you're into Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You know, Mike, this is just a nightmare. Really. No, I'm -- I'm serious. That's what this is. It's a nightmare, and any minute now -- listen to me. Listen to me. Any minute now, we are going to wake up, ok, and everything will be all right. And -- and this -- this will not be happening.",
        "Michael: It's happening. Yeah, it's a nightmare, Marcie, but it's -- it's happening.",
        "Marcie: No, maybe not. You know, maybe this is -- maybe this is just all one, big, evil game that Spencer is playing. Maybe it's a lie. Maybe it's --",
        "Michael: Honey, I wish that was true, but my brother has proof.",
        "Marcie: He doesn't have any proof, Michael! What does he have, documents? You know what? We have documents, too. We have documents that say that Tommy is our son. We have documents that say that we had a legal right to adopt him! Todd has a document, too, and his document says that his son is dead!",
        "Michael: The death certificate was phony, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Well, then maybe the other documents are phony, too. Michael, maybe John -- maybe John is just wrong about this.",
        "Michael: Marcie, honey, we have to be realistic about this. Ok? We have to accept the truth and figure out what we are going to do to keep our son.",
        "Marcie: Ok, you know, Michael, when Todd was in the courtroom, you know, he said -- he said you're all guilty about this. All right, did you -do you know what he meant by that? I mean, did other people know about this? Michael, do you know who he was talking about?",
        "Adriana: Can the judge really just hand Tommy over to Todd?",
        "Rex: Well, she can't if Tommy's not here.",
        "Roxy: Hey, where's Marcie? Because my nanny rates triple after 8:00.",
        "Rex: Roxy, take Tommy home, now.",
        "Todd: No one's taking my son anywhere.",
        "Roxy: Hey, forget what I said about the moola man.",
        "Todd: Do not leave with my son.",
        "Roxy: Your son?",
        "John: Roxy, we have a bit of a situation here, so if you don't mind, take Tommy --",
        "Todd: His name's not Tommy! I never gave him a name! His last name is Manning!",
        "John: Your honor, will you allow me to return this man to his cell?",
        "Judge: Not yet. There's a good deal to sort out here, lieutenant.",
        "John: Well, with all due respect, judge, this is a police matter that was not brought before the court. I do not believe you have jurisdiction on this one.",
        "Lewis: I beg to differ, your honor. The issues were raised while court was in session. Therefore, the disposition of this matter is entirely in your jurisdiction.",
        "Judge: Yes, it is, and I've decided to recall Michael and Marcie McBain please bring them back into the courtroom. The child will remain here, as well.",
        "Lewis: Kid's as good as yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, what's the latest with you two?",
        "Starr: Hmm. Oh, Cole's birthday was a couple of weeks ago, but between my dad missing and his mom being in jail, I never got a chance to give him his present yet.",
        "Langston: Well, what did you get him?",
        "Starr: I got him a new video MP3. It has pictures and -- and, you know, songs and videos of us, and stuff that reminds him of me.",
        "Langston: Aw. Are you going to make the screensaver a picture of you?",
        "Starr: Ew, no. You're gross, and you're obnoxious.",
        "Langston: I'm sorry. I mean --",
        "[Starr chuckles]",
        "Langston: It's romantic, but a little sappy.",
        "Starr: It was expensive, too.",
        "Langston: Hmm.",
        "Starr: It completely maxed out my credit card.",
        "Langston: Wow.",
        "Starr: Oh, shoot, that reminds me -- I have to ask Mrs. McBain if I can baby- sit for her again.",
        "Langston: Oh, that little kid is so cute.",
        "Starr: Oh, I know. I am not a baby person at all. But when I see him, I just want to grab him. And he gives me this little smile, like he knows me somehow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Jeez, will you just answer me, Michael? Did other people know that Tommy is Todd's son?",
        "Michael: Look, I don't know! Ok? What difference does it make?",
        "Marcie: They could have warned us. We would have been prepared. We would have been able to do something about this.",
        "John: Hey. The judge wants to see you in the courtroom.",
        "Marcie: Why?",
        "John: I don't know, Marcie. Take a minute to pull yourselves together, ok? I'll be in the courtroom, on your side.",
        "Marcie: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She's going -- she's going to take our son away from us, Michael. That's what she's going to do.",
        "Michael: No. Listen to me. I am not going to let that happen, ok? We will not let anybody take our son away.",
        "Marcie: Ok, look, I'm not going in there, ok? You go in if you want. I -- I'm just -- I'm --",
        "Michael: Honey, honey, honey -- you got to take a breath, ok?",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: Ok. Now, we have to face this.",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: No.",
        "Michael: We can't run away. Come here. Everybody is waiting for us, ok?",
        "Marcie: Ok. Ok.",
        "Michael: Our son is waiting for us.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: Ok. You ready?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Let's go.",
        "John: They'll be right in.",
        "Nora: You know, I think I've figured it out -- Lindsay's motive for killing Spencer. She found out that Marcie and Michael's little boy, Tommy, is actually Todd's child. And she killed Spencer Truman to keep the little secret from coming out.",
        "Roxy: Here's mommy.",
        "Marcie: Hi. Oh, my baby. My sweet little pumpkin.",
        "Judge: You will please leave the child in the care of the woman now tending to him.",
        "Roxy: You mean me?",
        "Judge: I do.",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: This court is back in session. Please be seated. This court was originally convened to deal with the matter of Lindsay Rappaport's arraignment for the murder of Spencer Truman. However, these proceedings have since devolved into something quite different. We are now dealing with serious accusations about a stolen child.",
        "Todd: My child!",
        "Judge: Quiet! Not another word out of you, Mr. Manning. I repeat, we are now dealing with accusations about a stolen child and an alleged cover-up reaching to the highest levels of the police department. Let me make this clear. I take these allegations very seriously, and the matter will be sorted out. But not tonight. You may take the prisoner back to his cell now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Oh, I'm sorry. Have you guys met before?",
        "Jared: You had that photo of Jessica when we first met at that business meeting.",
        "Nash: Oh, right, the business meeting. Yeah, it's ok. Jessica knows that the business meeting was actually a poker game which I lost and you won. I don't keep anything from my wife.",
        "Jared: Ah. Full disclosure between spouses. It's downright refreshing. Anyway, the picture doesn't do you justice, Jessica. You are much more beautiful in the flesh.",
        "[Bree cries]",
        "Jared: Do you have a baby?",
        "Nash: Yeah, Bree. She's my daughter.",
        "Jared: Ah.",
        "Jessica: Honey, you are so much better getting her to go back down. Would you mind?",
        "Nash: Yeah, sure. Yeah, give you a chance to size up my partner.",
        "Jared: Ah.",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: Huh.",
        "Jessica: What are you doing here, Jared?",
        "Jessica: How did you find me?",
        "Jared: Well, it wasn't easy since apparently, you were using an alias when we first met. But I am nothing if not resourceful.",
        "Jessica: Ok. Ok, so you tracked me down and then you buy the controlling interest in my husband's vineyard. What the hell's that about?",
        "Jared: That's a good investment.",
        "Jessica: No, you used his money to get it. That's filthy.",
        "Jared: It all worked out. What can I say?",
        "Jessica: No, it didn't work out. You manipulated the situation. You buying shares in the vineyard is no more a coincidence than you showing up in Llanview in the first place.",
        "Jared: You are always the queen.",
        "Jessica: Don't play games. You're here because of me.",
        "Jared: Well, we have a lot of unfinished business, wouldn't you agree?",
        "Jessica: That's fine, but you leave my husband out of it.",
        "Jared: I said the two of us.",
        "Jessica: I am a different person now.",
        "Jared: Aren't we all? I became a vineyard owner. That's a first. And I intend to stay here and keep an eye on my investment.",
        "Jessica: Ok, fine, you want to see a return on your investment, I can make it happen fast.",
        "Jared: I'm intrigued.",
        "Jessica: Whatever you paid for your shares in the vineyard, I will double it.",
        "Jared: Wow. If only this were about money, I would be all over that.",
        "Jessica: Then name your price. Anything.",
        "Jared: Did you not get what I just said? This isn't about money. This is personal, and we both know it. Or did you forget what happened between us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Langston's parents -- I mean, they -- they -- they never are in touch with her, they have no idea where she is. If something should happen to her, how would they even know, and would they even care?",
        "Clint: Oh, come on. I'm sure that they care.",
        "Dorian: How can you be sure of anything? You don't even know these people.",
        "Clint: Well, nor do you. I'm only saying that you shouldn't rush to judgment until you know the facts about them, you know? But that being said, I don't think there's anything wrong with you letting Langston know that you're there for her if she needs anything.",
        "Dorian: I suppose there's nothing to be done -- yet.",
        "Clint: I think that she's lucky to have you as a surrogate aunt, or whatever. But there is a fine line between concern and meddling.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I hate that word.",
        "[Clint laughs]",
        "Dorian: Hate it!",
        "Clint: Yeah. Yeah, I know you do, and I admire your devotion to people that you care about, and I know that you would do absolutely anything for your girls. It's that mother lion instinct. It's one of the things that I love about you.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Oh, my God.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: Do you remember? We did this last year. We wrote down all of this stuff that we wanted to happen by the end of the year.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. We were supposed to stick that in our backpacks and then look at it at the end of the year.",
        "Starr: Well, we obviously forgot.",
        "Langston: Well, what does it say?",
        "Starr: I don't know. I'm kind of afraid to read it.",
        "Langston: Oh, come on. Let me see it.",
        "Starr: It was a long time ago, Langston -- uh-uh-uh! If anybody reads it, I'm going to read it.",
        "Langston: Well, what does it say? Did any of your wishes come true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Nora, what does it mean that they're taking Todd back to jail?",
        "Nora: It means Todd's going back to jail. Period. All the issues surrounding Tommy are separate.",
        "Marcie: Honey, that's a good thing, you know? I mean Todd can't do anything about Tommy tonight.",
        "Todd: You can't send me back to jail, your honor! They're the ones that committed a crime, not me! They kidnapped my son then committed fraud --",
        "Judge: I will have order! And you, Mr. Manning, will let your attorney do the talking for you, or you'll be held in contempt.",
        "Todd: But -- your honor, that little boy over there -- he's --",
        "Judge: I assure you, your claim about the child will be thoroughly examined. In the meantime, I expect the prisoner to be accorded all his rights as guaranteed by the commonwealth. Lewis: Thank you, your honor.",
        "Todd: Your honor -- before I am escorted back to my cell, I have one request.",
        "Judge: State it quickly, please.",
        "Todd: If I'm not allowed to take my son home, please, don't let these baby thieves take him home.",
        "Todd: Your honor, please don't let my son go home with these people.",
        "Marcie: No, do not listen to this man, your honor. My husband and I -- we have done nothing wrong!",
        "Todd: Ah, no -- they just stole a kid. That's no big deal.",
        "Marcie: We were deceived, as well. We legally adopted Tommy. Until today, we had no idea who Tommy's biological father was, if it is even the truth.",
        "Todd: Your honor, she's lying. They're all lying.",
        "Judge: The child will stay with neither Mr. Manning nor the McBains. That would be equitable.",
        "Marcie: No! Your honor, how is that equitable? He's a -- he's a baby. He doesn't understand any of this. He will cry all night long. I mean, why would you -- why would you want to hurt him like that? Please, your honor, he's just a little boy.",
        "Roxy: Your highness? My name is Roxanne Louise Balsom and I got a little something to say.",
        "Rex: Roxy, no, please, not now.",
        "Roxy: Hey, zip it! Don't I got a right to weigh in here? I just got to tell you that I love Marcie and Michael like they're my own kids, and they live in my establishment, so I think I know them as good as anybody.",
        "Judge: I hope I don't regret this, but go ahead, Ms. Balsom.",
        "Roxy: Well, what I'm saying is I love them like they're my own kids -- Marcie and Michael.",
        "Judge: Yeah -- the point, please.",
        "Roxy: Well, my point -- and I, I do have one -- is that they love this kid. And look at him, look at him -- he's happy and healthy, and totally clueless. He knows less about what's going on here than I do, and that's saying a lot. But the one thing he knows is that these are his parents, and if he were to stay with strangers tonight -- or any night, for that matter -- he'd be screaming and kicking his brains out. So I think that Marcie is right. We shouldn't punish this kid. We got to do what's best for him. Isn't that the point?",
        "Judge: I appreciate your statement, Ms. Balsom.",
        "Roxy: You rock, judge.",

        "Roxy: Hey --",
        "Judge: And had I been allowed to finish what I was saying before, you would've realized that I feel exactly as you do -- that while it would be equitable to keep the child away from both sets of parents during this dispute -- equitable for the adults -- it would be disastrous for the child. And since at this time there are still issues that need to be explored, any action would be premature. Therefore, the child is going home with Dr. And Mrs. McBain. This court is adjourned!",

        "Clint: Yes, indeed. I'm proud of her, but I hope she has more in store for her life than serving drinks, which she's not very good at.",
        "Dorian: Huh. At least she's meeting interesting new people.",
        "Clint: It's funny that you should say that because I've been thinking about this. Sarah told me that she met this young man at the bar at Capricorn, and this guy had a picture of Jessica on his cell phone.",
        "Dorian: Who was he?",
        "Clint: I don't know. I assume, you know, it was an old friend, but, you know, the more I get to think about it, it strikes me as odd and I was just wondering if I should tell Jessica or not. What do -- do you -- what?",

        "Lewis: Yeah, well, that doesn't have any bearing on your case, but I'll tell you what will -- if you behave like a jerk in here. You know, you're not going to be able to hold your son when you're behind bars.",
        "Todd: I said I know! I got your point!",
        "Lewis: Did you? Now, listen, the assault charges against Miles Laurence -- not a problem. But assaulting an officer? That's a lot tougher, not to mention the escape.",

        "John: I understand.",
        "Nora: Uh uh. Well, you know the whole story, so I'm not really telling any tales out of school, but Bo missed a huge chunk of Matthew's life. He was deprived of being a father to Matthew for years because else play God. Now, that somebody else was very well-meaning and thought he was doing all the right things for all the right reasons, but as far as I'm concerned, no reason is ever good enough. So if Todd is right and I find out there has been a conspiracy to keep the paternity of that child a secret, I will prosecute each and every one of them to the fullest extent of the law, and that is my guarantee. I wanted to gain weight.",
