        "Bo, John, Fish and Brody all hustle to save Starr and Hope from Sergei and his men. But their plan may not be successful quite yet. Stacy and Kim know that they must stall Rex from finding out that she is not pregnant. But lo and behold, Stacy's doctor informs her that she is a few days pregnant. At that point, they know that that will convince Rex that she is carrying his child as long as he does not get to know more vital and detailed information about \"this\" pregnancy. Greg discovers that Shaun needs emergency surgery or he will die. And Greg is the only qualified neurosurgeon who can perform it on his brother."

        "John: You got to work with us, Sergei. We need the baby before we do anything else.",
        "Sergei: You want to bargain? Bring me the baby.",

        "John: Sergei!",
        "Sergei: You want baby now?",

        "Greg: There.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Bullet frag?",
        "Greg: Right next to the brain stem.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: How did we miss that?",
        "Greg: You couldn't have seen it without the scans. But if it moves a millimeter, it will blow Shaun's brain stem.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Well, you can't leave it in there. I mean, any impact, even a sudden stop of traffic --",
        "Greg: My brother could be dead on the spot.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: I'm sorry, Evans. I mean, even if I would have seen the fragment, I wouldn't have gone anywhere near it. That's not my specialty.",
        "Greg: No, I know.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: I had to get your brother stable and keep him alive.",
        "Greg: Which you did.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: You're going to need a neurosurgeon for that. A damn good one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: What's with the looks?",
        "Mrs. Evans: You scared us, baby.",
        "Shaun: I'm not going nowhere.",
        "Destiny: Like I said, they don't listen. I told Mama you'd be up by this afternoon.",
        "Mr. Evans: Ignore these women. Don't you do a thing until you are ready.",
        "Shaun: I'm ready. I've got reason to get moving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well?",
        "Doctor: I'll be right back with your test results and we'll take it from there.",
        "Rex: Thank you, Doctor.",
        "Stacy: Thank you.",
        "Kim: Why don't you take a hike, too?",
        "Rex: Because I might be the dad. Why are you here again?",
        "Kim: Because I actually give a damn about the mother. You're not helping.",
        "Rex: Excuse me?",
        "Kim: Can't you see she doesn't feel well?",
        "Rex: Oh. That's all I hear -- how hard it is for Stacy.",
        "Kim: Oh, yeah, nice attitude, dad.",
        "Rex: You have no right to get involved!",
        "Stacy: Okay, you guys, just stop it, please!",
        "Rex: You want her gone?",
        "Stacy: Rex, can you please wait outside? I just cannot handle all this squabbling.",

        "Schuyler: Hey.",
        "Gigi: Hey. It's good to see you.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. You, too.",
        "Gigi: Except I left you, like, ten messages.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I know. I know that. Um -- I wanted to tell you face-to-face.",

        "Blair: No, you're not, Todd.",
        "Todd: Yes, I am.",
        "Blair: No! Don't go in there.",
        "Todd: I'm going to go in there, Blair. He has no idea what he's doing. The longer this takes, the more the risk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Sergei, I swear, if you hurt either one of those girls, I will hunt you down --",
        "Sergei: Then you won't deal with me? He plays with me now, this John McBain. He gives me excuses like I am idiot child and I do not know how little time it takes to put fuel in an airplane.",
        "John: Listen to me. If I don't hear Starr's voice right now, I swear, I will hunt you down and I'll kill you.",
        "Starr: Hope and I are okay! We're alive!",
        "[Muffled speech]",
        "John: That's good, Sergei. That's good. As long as Starr and Hope are all right, then we're still in this.",
        "Sergei: 30 minutes, John McBain. You give me everything that I ask, or next bullet goes into teen mommy's pretty little head.",
        "Sergei: A plane fueled ready to leave the country. Money inside, safe passage to plane. These are my terms.",
        "John: No problem. Where do you want to do this?",
        "Sergei: 29 minutes, John McBain. Negotiation is over.",
        "[Phone disconnects]",
        "John: What do you think?",
        "Bo: We got to move.",

        "Sergei: You watch the movies? \"Look out, John McBain. It's a trap.\"",
        "Starr: If they think we're dead, they'll come in here shooting, and you could get my baby killed.",
        "Sergei: If they knew where we are, already police would be here.",
        "[Hope cries]",
        "Starr: Can you please just let me feed her? I'll be quiet and she'll be quiet, I swear.",
        "Vlad: You told me bring food and diapers. You don't tell me baby is always screaming.",
        "Sergei: Give her the kid, and a bottle of that stuff.",
        "Starr: Thank you. Come here. It's okay. Come here. Thanks. Okay, okay. Oh. It's all right. Come here.",
        "Sergei: Now you shut up and you keep that baby quiet. Or Evgeny will make her quiet, understand?",
        "[Hope continues crying]",
        "Starr: Yes. Here. Here, here.",
        "[Hope quiets down]",
        "Sergei: Watch her.",
        "Evgeny: You say come here for big payday, hmm? Not baby-sit.",
        "Sergei: These girls are very rich, very important. They will get us home safe and with lots of cash.",
        "Evgeny: Ugh, that baby is hurting my ears with that crying.",
        "Sergei: We will drug them for flight.",
        "Vlad: We're taking them with us?",
        "Sergei: What do you think?",
        "Vlad: We dump them from the plane.",
        "Sergei: Then U.S. Air Force shoots us down. Only way we land safe are with these little girls.",
        "Vlad: Then what do we do with them?",
        "Sergei: We sell them back to their rich daddy -- or whoever pays the most.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Why would you think I was leaving?",
        "Gigi: Because that's what you said the last time I saw you.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, but you said it was a crummy idea.",
        "Gigi: It was.",
        "Schuyler: Well, you still think so, or you change your mind?",
        "Gigi: No. I don't want you to leave. Especially because Rex told you to do it.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Yeah, me, neither. So yeah, I'm staying.",
        "Gigi: Excellent! What convinced you to stay?",
        "Schuyler: You did.",

        "Rex: I will go until the doctor comes back with the results.",

        "Stacy: Did you have to pick a fight with him?",
        "Kim: Yeah. Girl, you need to focus, and we need a plan right now.",
        "Stacy: I thought we had a plan. The doctor's going to tell me that I had a miscarriage. And then Rex and I are just going to comfort each other.",
        "Kim: And then what?",
        "Stacy: I -- I really don't know.",
        "Kim: Yeah, well, you'd better figure it out, because in about 15 minutes, Rex is going to find out you're not pregnant.",
        "[Stacy sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Um -- excuse me.",
        "Mrs. Evans: She's a nice girl. You could do worse.",
        "Destiny: He has.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Hmm.",
        "Shaun: Check yourself. I can still reach you. Don't worry. I won't lose Rachel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Look, it's our only option.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: It's in violation of -- I'll run it by the chief of surgery, but no promises.",
        "Greg: I'll be here if you need backup.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: All right. I'll let you know.",
        "Greg: Thanks.",
        "Rachel: What was that?",
        "Greg: Hey. How's Shaun?",
        "Rachel: Cracking jokes. Sorry he worried his mama. Does that man complain about anything?",
        "Greg: Only me. And he's usually right.",
        "Rachel: So what was that about?",
        "Greg: Uh -- Shaun's still in trouble. He needs another operation, and he needs it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Set up a perimeter. Don't make it obvious, but make sure they see you.",
        "Todd: What are you guys doing?",
        "Oliver: This is Fish with the task force. Tell swat and E.S.U. --",
        "Bo: All right. Unit 10, we'll meet you at the river entry.",
        "Brody: Yes, sir.",
        "John: Have river patrol set up a 5 mile perimeter.",
        "Brody: All right.",
        "Oliver: This is good to depths of 80 feet.",
        "Brody: That'll be plenty. Just, I need a safety catch for my B.C.D.",
        "Oliver: This way, this way.",
        "Todd: What the hell's going on?",
        "Bo: Get out of the way, Manning. Nobody in or out till you hear from me.",
        "Cole: What about the baby?",
        "John: Starr and the baby are fine. But the kidnappers are getting edgy so we're going in after them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: And see this right beside it?",
        "Rachel: The jagged thing?",
        "Greg: That's the bullet fragment. If this jagged edge comes anywhere near Shaun's brain stem --",
        "Rachel: Could that happen?",
        "Greg: Yeah. At any given moment, for no good reason. Hell, Shaun could cough too hard, turn his neck the wrong way, or --",
        "Rachel: Okay, why don't they just operate and take it out?",
        "Greg: Well, if we get approval.",
        "Rachel: If this could kill Shaun, why would the hospital say no?",
        "Greg: Because you need a qualified surgeon who can do something like this, that specialized.",
        "Rachel: Well, I'm sure the hospital has one.",
        "Greg: We do. Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You know you can't stay because of me, right?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. No, I -- yeah, I know.",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Schuyler: I didn't -- I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Gigi: Good.",
        "Schuyler: I just -- you -- you gave me a lot to think about, and I realized that I have more of a reason to stay than to go.",
        "Gigi: Good for you.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, good for you? Or just okay for you?",
        "Gigi: Good, absolutely.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Not good for Rex, though.",
        "Gigi: Don't worry about him.",
        "Schuyler: Why, you don't?",
        "Gigi: He is doing his best to try to be grown-up about us being friends.",
        "Schuyler: Wow. That's good.",
        "Gigi: Besides, he's very busy, holding Stacy's hand at the doctor these days.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: See? I told you it was normal.",
        "[Man chuckles]",
        "Man: They say cravings, they don't say what for. Pickled beets?",
        "Rex: Ew. Is that a good book?",
        "Woman: It's helped us a lot. Is this your first?",
        "Rex: Uh -- my second. But it's the first time that I've been able to be here from the beginning, so I want in on all of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I feel sick.",
        "Kim: Of course you do. You just had a painful, tragic miscarriage.",
        "Stacy: Think the doctor will be able to tell it happened weeks ago?",
        "Kim: Probably.",
        "Stacy: I'm done.",
        "Kim: Look, I never said this was going to be easy, but I promise I'll make this work. So don't you dare give up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sergei: So we are good, yes? We take girl and baby with us?",
        "[Pounding on door]",
        "Sergei: It's that punk Asher. This is his idea of sneaking in quiet.",
        "Vlad: Too many cars.",
        "Evgeny: The police are here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Swat and E.S.U. are onsite.",
        "John: They make any noise?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, they said they should have been heard on the inside.",
        "Todd: Hey, listen, you guys. This is my family. I want to pay the ransom.",
        "Bo: You don't know what you're talking about, Manning.",
        "Blair: Where are you going?",
        "Todd: Ow. Man.",
        "John: Listen to me. Let us do our job, all right? We're going to bring your daughter home.",
        "Todd: If you don't, I'm going to kill you.",
        "John: Let's go.",
        "Marty: Send word?",
        "John: As soon as we can.",
        "Oliver: Swat has established a perimeter here. River patrol stopped all traffic here and here. Sensors put warm bodies inside this area right here.",
        "Bo: Any word from Sergei?",
        "Oliver: No, nothing yet. And swat's already on the roof. They said that there's a ventilation shaft here, so if we want eyes inside the building --",
        "John: No. Don't do anything to move them out of the main room. We want you looking straight out at us, don't we, Sergei? We're going to keep it that way for as long as we can. Any word from Brody's team?",
        "Oliver: Not yet.",
        "Bo: If he doesn't get in there fast, this isn't going to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evgeny: A lot of cops. Sharpshooters.",
        "Vlad: I thought you said they hadn't found us.",
        "Sergei: And now they have. Of course they would.",
        "Vlad: And still no plane, Sergei. This McBain tricks you.",
        "Sergei: He tries. We try. He tries to come in our front door, we go out another.",
        "Vlad: You said there was only one way in.",
        "Sergei: Evgeny, check the river hatch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What about Brody? We feed him any more information?",
        "Bo: Can you get a fix on how far in from the river the entrance is? Can this equipment do that?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Well, from Asher's description, it should be here, but Brody's tracking device puts him right about there.",
        "John: So he should be in.",
        "Oliver: Well, it could be that the estimate's a few yards off.",
        "Bo: Or it could be that Asher fed us a line of bull.",
        "John: We'll know soon enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vlad: Sergei, they're in full body armor, assault rifles. They're not here to negotiate.",
        "Sergei: And yet, we see them.",
        "Vlad: Yes.",
        "Sergei: Why?",
        "Vlad: Huh?",
        "Sergei: If McBain and cops wanted to make a siege, why are they not shooting?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: We got to make some noise, get their attention.",
        "Bo: We start to play too soon and lose them.",
        "Brody: Fish?",
        "Oliver: I've got something. Yeah, we have you.",
        "Bo: What's your status, Brody?",
        "Brody: I'm in. I'm ready to move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You can't operate on your own brother. There has to be somebody qualified in Philadelphia or New York.",
        "Greg: We can't wait for one of these guys to clear a schedule and come here. And the risk of transporting Shaun is worse than --",
        "Rachel: Those are excuses.",
        "Greg: No, they're not.",
        "Rachel: You can't be objective.",
        "Greg: And I can't trust anybody else to do it, either.",
        "[Greg sighs]",
        "Greg: Look, Rachel, I've done this surgery before. Look, I can make these cuts in my sleep.",
        "Rachel: On your brother? You will literally have Shaun's life in your hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Evans: Come on, Phylicia, Des. Let Shaun rest.",
        "Destiny: He can rest with us here.",
        "Mrs. Evans: They want to give my baby boy a nurse full-time, then maybe I'll take a break, but you will not get me out of here otherwise.",
        "Mr. Evans: Lord save you from strong-willed women, hmm?",
        "Matthew: It's the same thing at my house. My mom can literally throw someone in jail.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Oh. I like that in a mother.",
        "[Mr. Evans chuckles]",
        "Shaun: Bro, get me out of here.",
        "[Mr. Evans chuckles]",
        "Greg: Can't do it just yet, Shaun.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Now, he needs to stay put and heal.",
        "Mr. Evans: What?",
        "Rachel: Matthew, we should wait outside.",
        "Matthew: Okay. I'll see you later.",
        "Destiny: Bye.",
        "Mrs. Evans: What does Rachel know that we don't?",
        "Greg: Shaun -- um -- I have some bad news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: How am I going to convince Dr. Baez to lie about the miscarriage?",
        "Kim: You don't.",
        "Stacy: Well, then Rex is going to know I've been lying.",
        "Kim: Uh-uh, you just found out yourself. You're just as shocked as he is.",
        "Stacy: Kimmy, I remember that night, okay? It's not like I didn't notice it.",
        "Kim: Oh, you mean the night your bitch sister showed up and tried to get you to have an abortion?",
        "Stacy: Yeah.",
        "Kim: Well, of course you remember it. You were a total wreck. It made you physically sick.",
        "Stacy: Oh, yeah, it did.",
        "Kim: Mm-hmm. And you may have had some bleeding, but you thought that was totally normal.",
        "Stacy: Which is why I didn't say anything -- because I --",
        "Kim: You were better the next day.",
        "Stacy: And I didn't want to upset Rex more than Gigi had already done.",
        "Kim: With her evil, baby-killing ways.",
        "Stacy: So I just went on.",
        "Kim: And you thought you dodged a bullet and everything was okay, until just now.",
        "Stacy: Why are you not running the world?",
        "Kim: The hours would suck.",
        "Stacy: This works.",
        "Kim: Mm-hmm. I mean, you not only get pity points, but you also get major, major guilt. Plus, your sister looks like the wicked witch.",
        "Stacy: Okay, so can you distract Rex while I'm talking to Dr. Baez? I just want to make sure the stories work out.",
        "Kim: Yeah, no problem. I'll take care of it.",
        "Dr. Baez: Okay, Stacy. We have your results.",
        "Kim: I'll be outside. Uh-uh. Nope. I'm not letting you in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I can't blame Rex for wanting to do right by his kid.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to pretend that you're okay with him spending time with Stacy.",
        "Gigi: Especially if she's still playing him.",
        "Schuyler: Uh -- I'm sorry, am I missing something?",
        "Gigi: Stacy faked being Shane's stem cell match, didn't she? So what if there's more to this story, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Doctor, just tell me. I already have a feeling.",
        "Dr. Baez: About what?",
        "Stacy: Well, something's not right with this pregnancy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Move.",
        "Kim: Forget it.",
        "Rex: What is your problem?",
        "Kim: Stacy's getting a pelvic exam.",
        "Rex: So? It's part of the process.",
        "Kim: Not for you, jerk.",
        "Rex: Look, I am here to be part of this.",
        "Kim: No, you're here like a hostage. You don't want to share in the experience with Stacy. Stacy could drop dead and still give you your baby, you'd be happy. Wouldn't you?",
        "Rex: This is not the perfect situation for anyone.",
        "Kim: Exactly. So why should she expose herself to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Well, what do you think's going on?",
        "Gigi: This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Baez: Why do you think something's wrong, Stacy?",
        "Stacy: Well, because a while back, I had this spotting, and --",
        "Dr. Baez: Well, it didn't prevent you from getting pregnant.",
        "Stacy: Wait -- what?",
        "Dr. Baez: Your tests show that you're a few days pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Gigi: I found it in Stacy's garbage.",
        "Schuyler: So?",
        "Gigi: So? What does a pregnant woman need with a home pregnancy test?",

        "Dr. Baez: You can get a false negative from those, especially this early on.",
        "Stacy: How early?",
        "Dr. Baez: According to your HCG levels, I'd say about three days -- a week at the most.",
        "Stacy: It worked.",
        "Dr. Baez: What did?",
        "Stacy: I'm pregnant! I mean, you're, like, absolutely, 100% sure?",

        "Greg: Mom, Dad, please...look, I know what it took from you to put me through med school. I never in my life thought that I would ever be able to pay you back.",
        "Mr. Evans: Look, you sent money.",
        "Greg: Yeah, but I never brought myself back home. And now here I am. And maybe this is the reason. So that I could be here when you needed me most.",
        "Mrs. Evans: You could do this surgery on your brother?",

        "Schuyler: But the doctor confirmed that Stacy's pregnant.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I know. We all heard the doctor with our own ears.",

        "Schuyler: Okay. It could be Kim's.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I know. But if it is Stacy's, how would this work? She'd fake a pregnancy test to corner Rex, and then, what? Try to get pregnant to back it up?",
