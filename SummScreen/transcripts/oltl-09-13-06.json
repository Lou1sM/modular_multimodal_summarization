        "Hugh almost tells Spencer that they are related as father and son. John is furious and lets him have it in the office about almost blurting out the secret. Hugh promises that he will handle this right. All John cares about it getting Spencer convicted of shooting his father. He knows that Spencer will be doing damage control as soon as he leaves the station and John will have him nabbed the second the man does something. \"Funny isn't it?\" Hugh observes. \"The son of the victim is teaming up with the son of the killer, to bring justice to the whole matter.\" Blair has Starr ready to go home but they have to wait for the papers to be signed. Starr lays into her mother about climbing into bed with Spencer when she knew that Todd was innocent and was wronged. She tells her mother that she disgusted. She knows that there had to have been another way to handle this and that her mother just looked at that option, of using sex to get what she wants. Kelly gets pain from her pregnancy and when she feels better, Nat whisks her off to get something to eat. Natalie implores Kelly to stay in town and not rob the family of the chance to know the baby. \"Don't let Spencer win.\" Kelly says that she is thinking of the baby and not about winning. She will stay for now to deal with the Spencer thing and then she is leaving town. Kelly remarks in a joking fashion that Natalie is awful bossy and reminds her of Dorian. \"Then there is something to be said about Dorian,\" Nat says. Todd wants to know where his son is, while Kevin wants to know why Spencer made him sterile. \"I never did that!\" Spencer does have a flashback though to the time last winter where he found Kevin in the phone booth and knocked him out. Kevin was laying in the snow, and that was when Spencer felt safe enough to remove his mask and do what he had to do. Todd offers to talk to Hugh to keep the bastard out of the death chamber, but all Spencer says to that is. \"The lot of you can go straight to hell!\" David asks about Dorian. When he hears the woman is in a holding cell, he rushes to her. Paige can see that there is still love there Cristian and Evangeline spend the day in bed making love, eating and making love again. \"We have something.\" One of Bo's men comes in and announces that the tracker that they put in Spencer's watch is giving off signals. \"He is at the hospital!\" Paige finds Spencer at the hospital. \"I will make you a deal. You tell me where Todd's son is, and I will tell you where your son is \""

        "Evangeline: Oh. Wow.",
        "Cristian: Hmm. I thought you said you weren't going to talk.",
        "Evangeline: I'm not talking. It's just --",
        "Cristian: That's talking. You're talking now.",
        "Evangeline: No. I'm -- I'm -- I'm explaining myself.",
        "Cristian: You just can't help yourself, can you?",
        "Evangeline: It's what I do, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but I like what you do when you don't talk.",
        "Evangeline: I love what you do when you don't talk. And I love you.",
        "Cristian: I love you, too.",

        "Starr: This is pretty cool. Why walk when you can ride, right?",
        "Blair: Hospital policy.",
        "Nurse: But glad you're enjoying it.",
        "Michael: Well, I hate to rain on your parade, Starr, but you can't go home just yet. Her release papers aren't ready.",
        "Blair: Well, how long is that going to be?",
        "Michael: Um, not exactly sure. You know what, Gretchen? You don't mind going up to admin and seeing how Starr's papers are doing?",
        "Gretchen: Sure, Dr. McBain.",
        "Michael: Thank you so much. [Pager beeps] Oh. It's Marcie. I got to take this.",
        "Blair: Hmm. Might be about that beautiful baby.",
        "Michael: Yeah. He's a keeper.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Michael: You feel better, ok, sweetie?",
        "Blair: Well, Starr, it looks like you managed to miss yet another day of school.",
        "Starr: Oh, well.",
        "Blair: Starr, you've missed your entire first week of high school because you were faking amnesia.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, I wouldn't have had to if you didn't lie about you and Dr. Truman.",
        "Blair: I told you why I had to do that.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but did you have to sleep with him? You hate the guy, and you still went to bed with him. How sick is that?",
        "Blair: It's not as simple as that, Starr. The good thing is that it's over. He's been arrested and he's going to pay for what he did, all right? Not just to us, but for everybody else's life he messed with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hugh: I am going to convict you for the murder of Thomas McBain because Thomas deserves the justice, because John deserves some peace, and nothing, nothing, not even the fact that I --",
        "Spencer: The fact that you're what, Mr. Hughes?",
        "Hugh: I'm the man who's going to sentence you to death.",
        "Spencer: Ok, well, do your worst, all right? And when this is all over, I'm going to make you suffer. In fact, I'm going to make all of you, each and every one of you, suffer. Can I go now? Thank you.",
        "Hugh: You enjoy your freedom while you can because once I'm through with you --",
        "Spencer: Yeah, I know, I know. I'll be walking down death row, right? Listen, you enjoy your little revenge fantasy while you can, ok? You got something for me to sign or what?",
        "John: In your office, now.",
        "Kelly: Spencer, I have something I want to say to you.",
        "Spencer: You know what, Kelly? I'm out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Spencer -- ow, oh!",
        "Kevin: Are you ok?",
        "Kelly: Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey. Hey! What the hell was that in there?",
        "Hugh: What -- that is none of your business.",
        "John: Hey! Well, it is my business. It looked for a minute there, if I didn't know better, that you were about to tell Truman that he was your father!",
        "Hugh: You know, for a second there, I actually was, and to be honest with you, I think I should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Who's coming?",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Marcie: Oh, hey. I am so glad that you made it here on time.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I came as fast as I could. Now, tell me exactly what Janice said when she called.",
        "Marcie: Well, I didn't speak to Janice. I spoke to her assistant. She said that Janice was here at a custody hearing and that she -- she wanted us to meet her here, um, to go over some important things.",
        "Michael: And she didn't say why?",
        "Marcie: Well, no, but it's got to be bad.",
        "Michael: Not necessarily, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Why do you lie to me? You know, I can see it in your eyes, Michael. You're just as worried as I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Starr, now that Spencer's been arrested, our lives can finally get back to normal.",
        "Starr: Like I'm ever going to have a normal life.",
        "Blair: Of course you are! You're starting a whole new school, high school. It's a big deal.",
        "Starr: You think it's not going to bite? Ricky moved, Langston's my only friend, and everybody pretty much thinks that she's a freak, too.",
        "Blair: Nobody thinks that about you.",
        "Starr: Mom, I'm the daughter of a guy who got executed and brought back from the dead -- totally normal",
        "Blair: Well, it does sound a little weird, but it's not your fault.",
        "Starr: You're right, because dad was set up -- by the guy you got engaged to.",
        "Blair: I know that I made my share of mistakes.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and your biggest mistake was not believing dad when he kept swearing to you he was innocent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: What's going on? Are you ok?",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine!",
        "Natalie: Do you need some water?",
        "Kelly: No. No, I -- I just -- I thought the baby moved. I overreacted. It was just a stress thing.",
        "Paige: Are you sure?",
        "Kelly: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: Do you think we should get you checked out or something?",
        "Kelly: No.",
        "Paige: Are -- are you feeling dizzy? Are you lightheaded, nauseous?",
        "Kelly: No, I'm fine.",
        "Paige: Do you have any cramping?",
        "Kelly: No. I just want to get out of here.",
        "Kevin: Ok, I'll take you.",
        "Kelly: No -- Kevin, please. Not now.",
        "Natalie: Kelly, did you eat any breakfast?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I had something small this morning, yeah.",
        "Natalie: Well, I think we can do better than that.",
        "Kelly: \"We?\"",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I'm going to take you out to eat.",
        "Kelly: You know, no offense, but I think I've had enough of you Buchanans for one day.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, you're kind of stuck with at least one of us, and I think he or she is trying to tell you something, so let's get out of here. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know what, Spencer? You're in even deeper if something happens to that baby.",
        "Spencer: You know what, Todd? I'm the reason she was able to conceive a child in the first place, you dimwit.",
        "Todd: Yeah. That worked out great, didn't it?",
        "Spencer: It's kind of a stretch, don't you think, Bo? I mean, you can try to pin all this other stuff on me, but trying to blame me for, well, Kelly sleeping with her fianc\u00e9's son? Come on, man.",
        "Kevin: None of this would've happened if you hadn't made me sterile, you son of a bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Are you out of your mind? You can't tell Truman he's your father!",
        "Hugh: I can't keep something like that a secret from him forever.",
        "John: Now is not the right time, all right? We need to play this thing out.",
        "Hugh: We have enough to nail him right now.",
        "John: Oh, you think so? You think so?",
        "Hugh: Yes. I've got a good strong case against him for kidnapping Margaret's baby and for setting up Todd Manning. I can prove attempted murder with that right now, with that alone.",
        "John: Let me tell you what's going to happen, all right? This weasel is loaded. He's going to get himself an army of lawyers, and he is going to buy his way out of this! He's going to buy his way right out of it! The only thing that's going to stick is a murder weapon. We get that, we get him for life.",
        "Hugh: And what if we can't? What if we can't get it, John? What then? You have to consider the possibility that we might never even find a thing.",
        "John: Then I go to my grave knowing I did everything I could, but we play this out to the end. We play it out to the end!",
        "Hugh: You really think that Truman is going to try to cover up 25-year-old tracks now?",
        "John: Yes. Yes, you know why? Because once he let Vickers take the heat, he didn't think he'd have to cover it up any longer. Trust me, he is going to slip up, all right? And when he does, we're going to be there to nail him. Nasal allergy symptoms, like congestion, can occur at any time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You sure you're all right?",
        "Kelly: I'm just not hungry.",
        "Natalie: You're eating for two, or you're supposed to be.",
        "Kelly: Look, I'm taking care of my baby, don't worry.",
        "Natalie: I know, I know, I just -- it's, you know, my great-niece or -nephew. Wow, that makes me sound really old.",
        "Kelly: I know, e whole situation is weird.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, and the Buchanans have had their fair share of weird.",
        "Kelly: So have the Cramers.",
        "Natalie: Do you think this baby is ever going to be normal?",
        "Kelly: Are you trying to make me feel better?",
        "Natalie: Sorry. I'll get to the point.",
        "Kelly: I knew you would.",
        "Natalie: That's why they call me \"the redhead\" -- I guess it's a little bit of Roxy in me. Look, I'm not the poster child for a perfect relationship.",
        "Kelly: Cut to the chase, Natalie, please. I can take it.",
        "Natalie: Spencer messed with you and Kevin bigtime.",
        "Kelly: I don't want to talk about this.",
        "Natalie: You can't let him get away with it, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Look, if you're trying to convince me to stay in Llanview --",
        "Natalie: Damn straight I am. Look, you're family, and we all loved Duke so much, and we love that little baby that's in there, too. If you just run because of Spencer, you're letting him hurt our family all over again.",
        "Kelly: So what am I supposed to do? Get back at Spencer by getting back together with Kevin?",
        "Kevin: You're going to pay for what you did to me.",
        "Bo: No, no. Back off, Kev.",
        "David: Hey, hey, hey, let Kevin go after him. Maybe he'll kill him.",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, and then I could arrest my own nephew for murder.",
        "Todd: Well, that'd be worth it, I think.",
        "Bo: Oh, that's easy for you to say. Your butt's not on the line.",
        "Kevin: He's right. It would be worth it.",
        "Bo: No, no, come on, back off, and you back off, Manning!",
        "Todd: Hey, look, I think Kevin and I have a right to be pissed off. He took Kevin's chance away of having a kid, and he took my kid away. I don't know where he is. Let me tell you something, Ezekiel -- I'm going to have my shot at you, sooner or later.",
        "Spencer: Sounds like a threat to me, Lieutenant. Hell, you've got more to book him on than me.",
        "Kevin: When did you do it, huh? Just tell me that -- when did you give me the virus? Yeah, this is Kevin Buchanan. Listen, my car broke down -- aah!",
        "Spencer: Sweet dreams, buddy boy. You know, contrary to popular belief, I am not God. I'm not the devil, either! All I did was help Kelly conceive a child, right? I'm not responsible for what happened to you. Hell, I didn't get her pregnant -- Duke did.",
        "Kevin: Because I couldn't! You made sure of that, didn't you?",
        "Spencer: This is insane.",
        "Kevin: If you didn't do it, then why did you have the virus in your office?",
        "Spencer: It's called research, Kevin. I was concerned about yours and Kelly's future. I had to have a sample of the virus to conduct my research. I was trying to find a way to reverse your damage.",
        "Paige: That is bull and you know it.",
        "Bo: Not -- not now, Paige. Kevin, you go in my office and just cool off, ok?",
        "Kevin: I am not finished with this guy.",
        "Bo: I don't want you to spend the night in jail, all right? Just cool off.",
        "Kevin: Fine.",
        "Bo: Thank you.",
        "Spencer: I'm out of here.",
        "Todd: No, not yet.",
        "Bo: No, don't make me arrest you, too, Manning.",
        "Todd: It's all right. I'm just going to lay something on the table for him, make him an offer he can't refuse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Mmm. Mmm. If I had known it would be like this, I would've stopped talking to you weeks ago.",
        "Cristian: I'm just glad you did now.",
        "Evangeline: Actions speak louder than words, don't they?",
        "Cristian: Hmm, well, that depends.",
        "Evangeline: I know. Because, like, when I'm in the courtroom, you know, and I'm -- I'm cross-examining someone or, like, when I'm giving closing arguments, that's one thing but in a relationship with the right --",
        "Cristian: Shh. Shh, shh.",
        "Evangeline: Shut up, Evangeline.",
        "Cristian: Good. I'm glad we got that settled.",
        "Evangeline: We don't need to talk, anyway. Mmm.",
        "Cristian: No?",
        "Evangeline: We're tuned in to each other.",
        "Cristian: Really?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah.",
        "Cristian: So you think we're tuned in to each other, huh?",
        "Evangeline: Completely.",
        "Cristian: Ok. What am I thinking now?",
        "Evangeline: Cris, we didn't even make it into the shower! We've already christened every corner of the room.",
        "Cristian: No -- I mean, yeah, yeah, but no. No, guess again.",
        "Evangeline: Ok. Hmm. You're just as hungry as I am.",
        "Cristian: That's right. Very good. I'll be right back.",
        "Evangeline: Ok.",
        "Cristian: Oh.",
        "Evangeline: Mmm!",

        "Blair: You've been talking to your dad?",
        "Starr: I talk to him all the time, and I hate how you lied to him.",
        "Blair: Oh, well, you're one to talk about lying, Starr.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, you're not exactly setting a great example. You're always telling me to save myself for someone that I love, and then you go and sleep with Dr. Truman even after you heard what he did to dad, and I'm not supposed to be disgusted?",
        "Blair: I explained to you why I did that.",
        "Starr: And you expect me to believe that there wasn't another way?",
        "Blair: There wasn't, all right?",
        "Starr: There's always another choice, mom, at least that's what you've told me.",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Starr: How come the rules are different for you?",
        "Blair: You know what? You can stop.",
        "Starr: There was another choice, mom. You just couldn't see it.",
        "Blair: Stop it, Starr!",
        "Starr: You just couldn't see it, mom, because you do what you always did to get your way -- you jump into bed and act like a complete slut!",
        "Blair: I said stop it! And I mean it and I mean it now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Manning, get out of here.",
        "Todd: I'm not going to hurt him, Bo. I just want to make a proposition.",
        "Spencer: Listen, Manning, I don't even have to talk to you, much less deal with you. I'm not going to be convicted of anything.",
        "Todd: You see? You see it, can't you? He doesn't really believe that. I see it in his eyes -- the doubting. You're afraid. And let me tell you something, my friend -- you should be afraid. It's going to get a lot worse from here on out. You're going to go to jail, and they're going to beat you, and they are going to abuse you. And that's nothing compared to the chamber. When you're strapped to that table and you see that poison put into your veins -- man, you don't know what fear is. Well, maybe you have some idea because you were there and you were watching me, right, waiting for me to buy it. I guarantee it's going to happen to you. You are going to be terrified. You're going to die unless --",
        "Spencer: Would you make your point already?",
        "Todd: Unless you tell me where my son is. Tell me where my son is and I'd talk to Hughes. I bet he'd let you cut a deal. You'd cop to life.",
        "Spencer: You want to know where your son is?",
        "Todd: Uh-huh.",
        "Spencer: Well, you'd have to ask Margaret that question because I don't know what she did with him.",
        "Paige: You have to know.",
        "Todd: You tell me where he is -- you tell me where my son is! Answer me!",
        "Spencer: Go to hell, Manning. You can all go to hell.",
        "Todd: Ok, now you -- ahem. You were there when he was born, yes? Uh -- he was all right then, yes?",
        "Paige: He was fine. He was born healthy, he was perfect.",
        "Todd: Ok. And then what did Spencer do with him? Damn it, Paige. I know you think that I don't care about this kid. I care about this kid. I have to know what happened to him, please!",
        "Bo: And we're working on that. Did you really think you could get him to confess?",
        "Todd: No, of course not. I just wanted him to know that if he harmed my child in any way, that he's going to fry for it.",
        "David: Look, just so you know, Spencer would never hurt a kid. He would not go that far.",
        "Todd: But you think he knows where he is, right? That's why you went to Thailand?",
        "David: Yeah, that's right, but I didn't get anywhere.",
        "Todd: Well, I'm not giving up. If we keep the pressure on, maybe --",
        "Paige: Or we can -- we can offer him something that he can't say no to. Everybody's got a weak spot.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, we'll leave that to the DA.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes, the DA -- the guy that just let him walk out of here!",
        "Paige: He had his reasons for that.",
        "Todd: What were those exactly?",
        "Paige: Look, Hugh is an excellent DA, and he wants to see Spencer pay as much as anybody.",
        "Todd: He's got a really strange way of showing it.",
        "Bo: Hey, Todd -- Todd? Stay away from Truman.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry, Bo. I can't guarantee that.",
        "David: Look, you can't blame him. It's his kid that we're talking about. I mean, you must understand, Paige, the lengths that you went to, to find your son?",
        "Bo: Yeah, but I'm just worried about what Manning will do to find his son.",
        "David: I guess that need to know your own child can make you do almost anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What the hell's he doing? That's it? All right. All right.",
        "Paige: I am your mother, and Spencer is your father.",
        "Hugh's voice: No, I -- I don't buy it. He can't be. You -- you can't be. You're too young.",
        "Paige: I -- I was young when I had you. Then I gave you up for adoption the day you were born. But Spencer and I are your biological parents.",
        "John: Call me back when he makes a move, all right? No. Any time. Thanks. That was Davis. Truman hasn't left the building yet. I don't know what the hell he's waiting for.",
        "Hugh: Maybe he's deliberately playing it cool.",
        "John: Hey. You ok?",
        "Hugh: Not really. Ever since finding out about Spencer, and I -- I just -- I've been trying to wrap my head around it. I can't. Paige, my mother -- she thinks I went easy on the bail issue because I found out I was Spencer's son.",
        "John: You sure it's not going to make a difference in how you handle this?",
        "Hugh: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes a big difference -- it makes me hate him all the more. I just -- I can't believe I'm related to a man who's capable of such monstrous acts. What if we're wrong about him like we were wrong about Todd?",
        "John: We're not wrong. There's too many people at know the truth. We just have to prove it.",
        "Hugh: We will.",
        "John: Hey, you -- you know, your dad, the man who adopted you -- he was a -- he was a good guy, right?",
        "Hugh: He's the best, like I'm sure your father was.",
        "John: Yeah, he was a good man.",
        "Hugh: And my biological father killed him. Now his son's teaming up with his victim's son to bring him down. Ironic, isn't it?",
