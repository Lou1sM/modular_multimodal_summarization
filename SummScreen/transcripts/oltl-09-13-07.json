        "Natalie is at work at Buchanan Enterprises when she receives an e-mail from Jared who has disguised his email address. She asks who is writing to her and he asks her what she is wearing. She calls him a \"psycho.\" He mumbles to himself that she doesn't know the half of it. Miles meets up with Marty in the corridor at the courthouse. She serves him with the annulment papers to end their marriage. Todd and police officers pay a visit to Michael and Marcie. John watches Marty as she talks to Miles about their marriage and ending it. Marcie refuses to give Tommy to Todd or even let him near her son. Miles wishes Marty happiness with whomever she can find it. The conversation continues between Natalie and Jared via the internet. He convinces her to meet him. Marcie and Michael try to convince Todd not to go through with this but Todd refuses to listen. Marcie then shows him pictures of her son doing some of the fun things that he loves to do. Marty and John go up onto the roof to have a talk. He takes her annulment papers and makes a toy plane out of them. John explains to Marty that he had known for two weeks that Michael and Marcie had Todd's son, but he kept it a secret. Todd tells Michael and Marcie to be in court and to be sure and bring Tommy. Blair confesses to Dorian that she and Todd had told each other that they loved each other, but then this happened. Blair insists that she is going to make things right as she leaves Dorian's kitchen. Natalie is just about to leave her office when Miles comes in. He lets her know that he received his annulment papers from Marty and she suggests that they go for a drive."

        "Miles: Marty? What are you doing here?",
        "Marty: I came to file these papers. And since you're here, here is your copy.",
        "Miles: What papers?",
        "Marty: Annulment papers, ending our sham of a marriage.",
        "Miles: It's -- it's done, already?",
        "Marty: Well, I got the paperwork started while I was in jail.",
        "Miles: You don't waste any time.",
        "Marty: Well, you know, I think I've wasted enough time married to a man I didn't love.",
        "Miles: I'm not being judgmental. I just don't know how long these things take.",
        "Marty: And you actually helped move things along when you got up in court and said that the only reason I married you was because you blackmailed me.",
        "Miles: I would have never married you if I didn't love you. I still do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What are you doing?",
        "Blair: Peeling potatoes.",
        "Dorian: But you messed up the newspaper.",
        "Blair: I'm tired of looking at it.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. \"McBaby thieves.\" Huh. Well, there'll be plenty more of that, I'm sure.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm?",
        "Dorian: I can just see it now.",
        "Blair: Todd will give them hell.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, and it won't stop there. Once he gets that child back, he'll target everybody he holds responsible.",
        "Blair: First stop, the McBain family.",
        "Dorian: Next stop, you.",

        "Michael: What are you doing here?",
        "Todd: This will explain.",
        "Michael: What's this?",
        "Todd: A court order.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no. No, no, there's no way that I'm going to let you come in here and take my son.",
        "Michael: Don't worry, sweetie. He can't take our son from us.",
        "Marcie: Why don't you just take your flunkies and get the hell out of here, Todd? Because I don't care how many lawyers or cops you've brought with you, there is no way in hell that you are getting anywhere near my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Look, whatever your feelings are or aren't, just leave me out of them.",
        "Miles: So this -- this paper, what -- we're just supposed to forget what happened? Like our marriage never existed, or --",
        "Marty: Yeah, I don't think I could forget what occurred between us, but legally, this marriage never happened. The only husband I have ever known is Patrick.",
        "Miles: I understand. It kills me to know that I caused you nothing but pain. It's the last thing I wanted. I just -- I hope that you find happiness, wherever and with whomever you -- you want.",

        "Jared: \"Live a little. I know you want to see a pic.\"",
        "Natalie: Huh. \"I don't own a microscope.\"",

        "Jared: Yo, coming. Coming. Yeah -- oh. You're not the pizza guy.",
        "Nash: Nope. But I might be. And real soon if I let you run my vineyard into the ground the way you're threatening to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm not afraid of Todd, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Right.",
        "Blair: Right.",
        "Dorian: Famous last words.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. Here we go again.",
        "Dorian: Ugh. I just had my nails done. Do I need to remind you how much pain Todd has caused people who he thinks crossed him, hmm?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Dorian: Good. Because I don't want you in denial about, you know, this thing is going to play out",
        "Blair: What are you, a psychic now?",
        "Dorian: Well, I'm merely pointing out that Todd holds on to every slight -- you cut ahead of him at the grocery store, you are going to find your tires slashed.",
        "Blair: Oh, please.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. How about we talk about his psychology for just a moment here?",
        "Blair: Oh --",
        "Dorian: Yeah, yeah. Any normal person getting back their child would be so grateful, so joyful, that -- that they wouldn't be able to think about anything else. But Todd is not a normal person. Oh, no, no, no. He doesn't feel joyful because he is incapable of experiencing joy. No, he would much rather obsess about everything that is wrong in his life and all of the people who have done him wrong.",
        "Blair: Is that what you think? That I've done Todd wrong?",
        "Dorian: No, I don't think that at all.",
        "Blair: Do you know that Marcie McBain took Tommy in and raised him as if -- as if she had given birth to him. She's about to lose him. She's going to be destroyed.",
        "Dorian: I know. It's very, very sad.",
        "Blair: Well, then why can't you understand that the only reason I did that was to get John time to break the information to her in the most humane way possible.",
        "Dorian: Honey, you don't need to convince me, you need to convince yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You didn't hear my wife? Back up.",
        "Todd: Yeah, or what?",
        "Michael: You son of a --",
        "Marcie: Michael, don't!",
        "Officer: Calm down, everyone! It's not going to help anybody if I have to start issuing warrants. Lawyer: Are these your clients, Counselor?",
        "Judy: They are. Lawyer: Then I suggest you control them before someone has to start breaking out a Taser.",
        "Judy: Let's all calm down and try to remember there's a child on the premises.",
        "Todd: That's right, my child.",
        "Michael: You're not getting within one foot of my son.",
        "Lawyer: This court order says differently.",
        "Judy: Let me see that.",
        "Michael: What's wrong with you? You don't have any shame? You come to my house in the middle of the night? You bring cops, you bring lawyers?",
        "Todd: Well, what's good enough for the goose is damn well good enough for me.",
        "Judy: It's legit.",
        "Michael: No. I want you to read it again.",
        "Marcie: So what are you telling me, that this man can just waltz into my house and take our son away from us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, when did you get back?",
        "Jessica: Yesterday. Bree and I went straight home to Nash, and then we had a nap.",
        "Natalie: Well, good. [British accent] So tell me, how's London?",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Jessica: Amazing, hanging out with our brothers.",
        "Natalie: [Normal voice] Oh, I'm so jealous.",
        "Jessica: Well, they both miss you very, very much, and Kelly.",
        "Natalie: Oh, how is she?",
        "Jessica: Oh -- radiant, radiant. She's completely in her element. She just seems more confident in her skin.",
        "Natalie: I could see that.",
        "Jessica: And little Zane isn't ittle Zane anymore. He was playing with Bree, and it was so cute. And Kelly and I -- we went shopping, and we caught up on each other's lives. It was all very fabulous.",
        "Natalie: Well, why did you have such a short trip?",
        "Jessica: I don't know -- I -- I missed Nash, and I missed the vineyard, so I -- well, cut my trip short and came home.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Well, I'm sure hubby dearest isn't complaining.",
        "Jessica: No, he's not, but -- do you know where mom is? Because I was thinking, Bree's at the sitter, and you and I could get a free lunch out of her.",
        "Natalie: Oh! I wish I could. I am just -- I'm so swamped. And actually, mom's not been home for a couple of days. Isn't this the time of year that she goes to that publishers conference?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, so -- anyway, I guess you're going to have to find somebody else to get into trouble with today.",
        "Jessica: Because clearly, you have. Who is \"Mr. Jackass\"?",
        "Natalie: Ugh. Oh, god. It's this guy who -- he's been all over me to hire him.",
        "Jessica: I didn't realize there was a hiring freeze here at B.E.",
        "Natalie: Well, there is for bozos who waltz into my office with a messiah complex claiming to know everything --",
        "Jessica: Ah.",
        "Natalie: About everything.",
        "Jessica: Ok. Got I know the type.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. And then I find out that he brings me a fake resume. And then he lies to me about being chummy with grandpa.",
        "Jessica: Ooh.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know, right? And it gets worse. I mean, he tracks me down online and starts to -- you know what? Never mind. It's just so wrong. Ugh.",
        "Jessica: Well, it looks like you handled it.",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I mean, if this guy was normal, I would think this would be it, but -- him, I'm not sure. I was kind of thinking about calling security, having them keep tabs on him.",
        "[Jessica scoffs]",
        "Jessica: That's going a little bit overboard, don't you think, Natalie? I mean, just get an I.T. guy up here, block his email address, and the I.M.s won't be coming through. Mr. Jackass has a name, doesn't he?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Jared Banks. And as far as I'm concerned, you can't go too far with --",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry -- did you say \"Jared Banks\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So, are we done here?",
        "Miles: I'm just -- I'm so sorry that I -- I did what I did to you and Cole.",
        "Marty: Yes, you've deserved that.",
        "Miles: I know, I know. I just want you to know that I'm going to have to live with this -- what I did to you -- for the rest of my life. That I hurt the first person in the outside world that showed me any kind of kindness. The most beautiful woman I've ever met. I'll never live it down. Ever.",
        "John: Well, looks like he got the message.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Better late than never, right?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marty: You know, I never thought I would feel like celebrating the end of a marriage, but I feel like I just escaped a life sentence -- again. Hmm.",
        "John: Just try to put it behind you.",
        "Marty: Yeah. I am just so excited to get back to my life and my family and my practice, and -- you know, if I never get interrogated again --",
        "John: You'd rather be asking the questions, right, doc?",
        "Marty: Yes. But don't worry, I will save it for my patients, so you're safe.",
        "John: Thanks for that.",
        "Marty: Sure. I -- I read about what happened about Marcie and Michael. I am so sorry. I just -- I can't even imagine what kind of nightmare this is.",
        "John: It seems like it's never going to end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judy: Mr. Manning is not here to take Tommy from you.",
        "Marcie: Well, then why the hell is he here? What does he want?",
        "Judy: According to these documents, the court has mandated that a DNA sample be retrieved in order to establish paternity.",
        "Marcie: A DNA sample?",
        "Todd: Yeah, it's a stupid formality. Let's go, let's get this over with.",
        "Marcie: Look, there has to be something that you can do about this.",
        "Michael: Yeah, you can't do anything? I mean, you can't file something?",
        "Judy: I'm sorry, but Tommy's in perfect health. There is no basis for me to bar them from getting a sample.",
        "Marcie: I don't want this man poking at my child!",
        "Judy: The procedure is minimally invasive.",
        "Man: It's just a quick swab inside the child's cheek to collect skin cells. Lawyer: And then the same for Todd.",
        "Marcie: Look, I don't even understand why he even needs a sample, Judy. He says that he knows the answer.",
        "Todd: God, you really are dumb. Lawyer: How long are you guys going to put this off? Now, I know my client can afford the billable hours. But can yours?",
        "Marcie: I think we'll just refuse. How about that?",
        "Todd: You should try that. I dare you.",
        "Judy: We have to do this, Marcie. The only choice is whether or not you're going to hold Tommy's hand while it's happening. So either you and Michael hold Tommy's hand, or the officer does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, you weren't there in the courtroom. You didn't see Marcie when she was listening to Todd's words. You didn't see the look on her face.",
        "Dorian: I know that look. I've seen it on your face many times. Blair, Todd took your own children away from you. And if he's capable of doing that to a woman he said he loved -- well, what's he capable of doing to a woman he barely knows?",
        "Blair: Come on, it's different with Todd and me.",
        "Dorian: Oh, how's it different?",
        "Blair: It's different because we have a history, and it complicates things.",
        "Dorian: Yes, indeed, it does, but it certainly does not justify his behavior. Blair, you were just trying to spare two people the kind of pain that you yourself have gone through. As far as I'm concerned, you should be canonized.",
        "Blair: I don't want that, not if it's because I hurt Todd.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's right. That's what this is all about. You're afraid that what you did for Marcie is going to cost you Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know Jared Banks?",
        "Jared: What's the matter? I thought you'd be happy to see me.",
        "Jessica: Keep your voice down. How did you find me?",
        "Jared: It wasn't easy, since apparently, you were using an alias when we first met.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, um -- I met him last night.",
        "Natalie: I thought you said you went straight home from the airport.",
        "Jessica: I did, I did. He -- he came over.",
        "Natalie: What the hell -- is he trying to get to me through you now?",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, Natalie, it's -- it's not like that at all. It's actually kind of involved.",
        "Natalie: Well, honey, anything that involves you and that creep, I'm all ears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: There's -- there's beer in the mini-fridge, if you want.",
        "Nash: Thanks, but I prefer not to mix my booze with business.",
        "Jared: Unless it's your booze, right?",
        "Nash: My booze is wine. Don't tell me you think they're the same thing, please.",
        "Jared: I'm not that bad yet.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- speaking of bad, this -- this proposal --",
        "Jared: All right, hold up. I try not to mix business with cheap hotel rooms, so we might want to take this ---",
        "Nash: No, it's all right. I've stayed in this motel in at least four states.",
        "Jared: All right. Well, then shoot. What do you hate about it?",
        "Nash: Page two. Your idea of upgrading the wine barrels. Look, I really respect your ideas --",
        "Jared: Well, just get to it. I don't need you to hold my hand here.",
        "Nash: All right. Older the barrels, the more seasoned they are. The more seasoned they are, the better the wine. The better the wine, the happier the customers, and so --",
        "Jared: Anything else?",
        "Nash: That's it.",
        "Jared: Like I said, I'm numbers and management guy, you are the expert. You make a great bottle of wine, I'm never going to mess with that.",
        "Nash: So if you come up with some half-corked idea like screw-on caps or something, I can just tell you to get lost?",
        "Nash: Get lost.",
        "Jared: Wine in a box.",
        "Nash: Die.",
        "Jared: See, man? There's nothing to be tense about. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You know, I feel for Michael and Marcie. You. I mean, Todd is not going to make this easy on any of you.",
        "John: That's no lie.",
        "Marty: If you want to, you know --",
        "John: What, talk? Huh.",
        "Marty: No. No, I was going to say play darts. We could take Todd's picture and use it for practice.",
        "John: You and darts? I think we might need to take insurance out first.",
        "Marty: That's so funny.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Marty: Hmm. So did you get the note that Cole and I left you in your office the other day?",
        "John: Yeah, I did. I just -- been so distracted with everything going on.",
        "Marty: Oh, no, I'm not fishing for an apology, really. I just -- I'd still be climbing those walls in jail if it wasn't for you. So, does Bo have some amazing promotion lined up for you? Like chief of detectives? Or should I just call you \"chief\"?",
        "John: How about \"unemployed\"? I got suspended. Believe me, it was warranted.",
        "Marty: Well, I guess we both have the day off, then. You know, you could come help me celebrate my new lease on life.",
        "John: Well, you know, I don't know if I want to get in the habit of knocking them back before happy hour.",
        "Marty: Come on, have a little imagination. Walk with me, and I'll tell you what I have in mind.",
        "John: Well, I guess I could use some air.",
        "Marty: Good. You sure?",
        "John: Uh-huh.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So of course you're not worried about whether you did the right thing for Marcie. All that matters to you is Todd's reaction.",
        "Blair: You know, the McBains are not the only ones that could be hurt here.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's right. Todd first. Everybody else be damned.",
        "Blair: Have you listened to one word that I've said?",
        "Dorian: Have you been listening to yourself? All that matters to you is \"Todd.\" What about the two people who have been raising Tommy all this time?",
        "Blair: Listen, I'm not saying it's a perfect situation. It's not. But the bottom line is that Tommy is Todd's son, and they belong together, ok?",
        "Dorian: Is that really the best thing for this child?",
        "Blair: It's not my decision to make.",
        "Dorian: Oh, really? Well, for someone who wants to be hands-off, you certainly are making a lot of important decisions. First of all, you were the one who told Todd that Tommy was his child. And then, you tried to stop him from taking the child who you were in such a rush to point out was actually his.",
        "Blair: Why are you making this so black and white?",
        "Dorian: Hey, I know it's complicated.",
        "Blair: It's complicated, all right, and it doesn't matter what I did -- somebody was bound to get hurt!",
        "Dorian: Yes, and trying to help everybody, you hurt everybody.",
        "Blair: I ended up hurting everybody? So you're saying it is my fault?",
        "Dorian: No, no, no. No, I -- I didn't mean that.",
        "Blair: Yes, you did.",
        "Dorian: No, I did not mean that, but I -- I think that's what Todd thinks happened. And that's what you are really worried about. You're still in love with Todd, and you're afraid that this has cost you every chance you ever had of reconciling with him.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: See that man over there? You see him? He's just going to take this tiny little thing, and he's going to stick it in your cheek, ok? It'll be like your pacifier.",
        "Michael: Yeah, don't worry, buddy. Daddy does this to patients all the time.",
        "[Tommy fusses]",
        "Marcie: I know, I know.",
        "Michael: It's not going to hurt a bit.",
        "Marcie: It won't.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's well done, Michael. Say the \"h\" word to him. Way to make him feel safe.",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Michael: Stow it, Todd.",
        "Todd: You know I have two other biological children. And I know for a fact, if you say something might not feel as good, that's all he hears. So, you know what? Hey, kid. Hey, kid. I'll go first, show you how easy it is.",
        "Marcie: Judy --",
        "Judy: Direct your client not to address the child. If it happens again, the closest he's ever going to get to Tommy is 100 yards.",
        "Todd: I was trying to make it easier on him. Lawyer: Todd, please, we're almost through here.",
        "Todd: All right, so do me.",
        "[Tommy fusses]",
        "Marcie: I know, I know.",
        "Todd: See that? Easy peasy.",
        "Marcie: All right, Tommy. Ok. Now, look. Just watch mommy, ok? It's all right. Hey, this man right here -- I know. I know you don't want to do it. But it won't --",
        "Michael: Oh, it's going to -- it's going to be ok, buddy.",
        "Marcie: It's going to be ok.",

        "Man: They should be ready for the hearing tomorrow.",
        "Judy: What is this hearing, and why am I just now finding out about it? Lawyer: Oh, don't act so surprised, counselor. It's in everyone's best interest that we get this matter resolved as quickly as possible.",
        "Marcie: Resolve what matter?",
        "Todd: The matter of my son. As soon as we get the results back, we're going to court, I'm going to come back here, and I'm going to take that kid. So this is your last day playing house with him -- enjoy it.",

        "Jared: That one.",
        "Nash: Huh. What am I looking at?",
        "Jared: Well, the cost of a bag of tobacco and a pack of rolling papers multiplied by the number of nic fits I've had since quitting. Smoking.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Nash: So, basically our petty cash is riding the back of your addiction, kind of like Hawaii on the back of a volcano.",

        "Jared: Yeah, as much as I enjoyed rolling the perfect cigarette and living out of motel rooms, once you're past that Kerouac phase, it ain't so cute. Owning real estate, though, you know, you got to be all in. You ought to know everything I got that's liquid, I put into our vineyard. You know, besides what I need to keep this roof over my head and fast food on the -- bed, I got nothing.",
        "Nash: All in, huh?",
        "Jared: That's the only way I know to do things.",

        "Natalie: Wow. I -- I can't believe what kind of games this guy is playing. I mean, first he uses grandpa's memory to try to get a job out of me, and then he takes the money that he won from Nash to try to horn in on your dream -- what's next? Going to prose to mom?",
        "Jessica: I don't know, but it looks like we're stuck with him.",
        "Natalie: Ok, you got to -- you got to buy him out, you know? Offer him double what he paid for it.",
        "Jessica: I already tried, he said no.",

        "Jessica: Oh, no, no, no. No, no, wait, wait -- Natalie? Let's not go overboard here. You know, he could sue us for invasion of privacy.",
        "Natalie: Jess, no. Our security here, they're a team of professionals.",
        "Jessica: You're probably right, but Nash a me are the ones that have to work with him, ok? So why don't you just let us dig up some information on our end.",
        "Natalie: If it makes you feel more comfort --",

        "John: Thought you would've trashed that by now.",

        "Marty: Well, I lost track of it, and then it just showed up under a pile of bills.",
        "John: Well, interesting. What'd your colleagues say about that, that subconsciously you were trying to bury it?",
        "Marty: Probably. So consciously now, I am going to bury it at a, send it to Davey Jones' locker.",
        "John: Whoa, wait, wait, wait -- wait a minute. What, you're telling me you're just going to just wad that up and toss it?",

        "Marcie: Have you ever stepped foot in this house before today? No. So why don't you open your eyes for once in your life, Todd, and take a look around? Why don't you really see what is in front of you? This is Tommy's home -- every socket, every hard edge, every inch is childproofed. Inside -- that's where his crib is. He's already climbing out of it. He is so smart. We cherish every moment that we have with him. Every day, every single day I spend with him, Todd, I take a picture of him -- look! Really look! This -- this was his first day at the beach. You know, we were -- we were building sandcastles with him and -- and he just kept crawling out towards the water. It was like it was calling to him, and then this picture here, this is his first picnic. It's before -- oh, Mike, look -- it's before he had teeth. D look at this picture -- this is his favorite ball. Laying with it. He loves the gym, Todd -- he is not a piece of clay! He is not some lost teddy bear! He is a person with wants and needs. He has a life here with us. Todd, we love him so much and he loves us. We are the only family that he knows! Todd, maybe we're not his biological parents, but we are s parents! I want -- we want for you to know him. We want for him to know you -- we're not cruel. We just don't want you -- we just don't want you to take him away from us because that would be the cruel thing. So, Todd, I am -- please, I am just asking you to just -- just let it go. I think she's got 16 kids.",

        "John: My father, of course, you know? That's how it works -- it gets passed down from father to son. Cole probably learned it from his dad.",
        "Marty: Maybe. But if he didn't, I know he would love for you to show him how.",
        "John: Well, I think Cole might be a little old for paper airplanes, but --",

        "Marty: I'm sorry. I know you cared a lot about that little boy.",
        "John: In my mind, he's still a McBain no matter what the D.N.A. says. I found out who his biological father was a couple of weeks ago. That's why I got suspended. I found out and I didn't say anything.",
        "Marty: Well, that couldn't have been easy.",
        "John: I tried to do the right thing. But in the end, I -- in the end, I couldn't take Mike's family away from him. I thought I could handle the situation in a way that would turn out somewhat ok -- it was wrong.",
