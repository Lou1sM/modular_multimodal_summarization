        "Blair comes to visit Todd, but he doesn't seem to want to hear anything that she has to say. He tries to force her to leave, but she insists on staying until they get things worked out. Roxie pays Michael a visit and wants to know what he is getting Rex involved in. Marcie barges in on Rex in the sauna. She drags him out, thus making him drop his towel as he goes out the door. Natalie and Miles walk up just as Marty kisses John and are stunned by the actions. Jessica visits Jared in his hotel room and finds Nash there with him. Nash senses that something is wrong between the two. Nash receives a phone call and leaves Jessica alone with Jared. He tells the two to play nice. Jessica wants to know why he wants to involve Natalie and Nash in this instead of just leaving it between the two of them. Natalie and Miles are cordial with Marty and John, but they are highly resentful of the whole situation. Marcie and Rex arrive back at Marcie's. Upon seeing Rex, Roxie wants to know what they are getting him involved in now. Roxie leaves them alone to talk. Michael and Marcie inform Rex of their plans to bring Todd down no matter what it takes to protect their son. Rex is reluctant because there are Starr and Jack to consider. Marcie informs him that she wants Todd brought down no matter what it takes. Natalie comes to visit Jared just as he had asked. She begins to drink one drink after another and then she opens up as to how John had treated her."

        "Michael: Hey, Rox, come on in. Listen, Marcie's not here and Tommy's asleep.",
        "Roxy: Good, because you're really the one I wanted to see.",
        "Michael: Something wrong?",
        "Roxy: That depends. Is my kid in danger? Don't -- don't look at me like that. I'm talking about the custody suit. How far are you dragging him into this?",
        "Michael: Rox --",
        "Roxy: Come on, don't give me those sad eyes. I know you love Tommy, I love Tommy, but I got a kid, also. I don't want to see him face-down in the dumper, so I'm giving you one more chance and then I'm calling in the cavalry. I got a lot of friends in AC and they'll make short work out of Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I really don't feel like playing your games, Blair. Just get out.",
        "Blair: Nope, not until I make it right.",
        "Todd: Yeah, so you want me to forgive you for sending me to jail? Is that it? Huh. That's not going to happen.",
        "Blair: No, I'm not leaving until it's done, Todd.",
        "Todd: Why are you -- I -- we're not married. We're not seeing each other. Why do you care if we're getting along?",
        "Blair: I care because it matters to jack and Starr. I care because it matters to me.",
        "Todd: Well, get over it!",
        "Blair: I don't want to get over this. I want us to get past it.",
        "Todd: I don't care what you want. I want to -- well, what I want to do is take a shower, maybe watch a movie on television. That's it.",
        "Blair: Great -- well, I'll make us some nachos then.",
        "Todd: No, damn it!",
        "Blair: What? Todd, no!",
        "Todd: You're not invited.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: What are you doing here?",
        "Jessica: Oh -- what are you doing here?",
        "Nash: We business meeting with my business partner, or at least I was until you came pounding on the door. You almost scared poor Jared half to death. What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So -- I heard that my uncle went off on Marcie and Michael. How are they doing?",
        "John: They're ok.",
        "Natalie: \"They're ok\"? They found out that Todd is Tommy's biological father and they're ok?",
        "John: I'm not sure what you want me to say.",
        "Natalie: You're right. I mean, what, they just lost somebody they love. What's the big deal, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: So I -- I guess you're moving on.",
        "Marty: Whatever I do or don't do, it's none of your business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd, Todd?",
        "Todd: Ah -- don't tickle me!",
        "Blair: Well, I'm sorry. I forgot.",
        "Todd: Get out.",
        "Blair: Nope. Got to face this.",
        "Todd: Face what? I just can't stand you anymore. I want you out of my life.",
        "Blair: Well, that's not going to happen. I threw you in jail and you know why.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know why -- because you refuse to stop until you get exactly what you want.",
        "Blair: Sounds like somebody else I know.",
        "Todd: That's right. That's exactly right. That's why you and I don't work -- there can only be one selfish jerk per relationship and, baby, that's me.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on, honey.",
        "Todd: Oh, God, don't call me \"honey.\"",
        "Blair: Well, you call me \"baby.\"",
        "Todd: You know why? Because you are a baby. You're a selfish, conniving child.",
        "Blair: You got something right --",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: Right there. Yeah, it's like spinach or aru -- yeah, you got it, that's good. You're perfect.",
        "Todd: You're just a weasel.",
        "Blair: I don't know why you are wasting time on me, Todd. I think we need to focus on --",
        "Todd: No --",
        "Blair: Winning your custody battle.",
        "Todd: \"We\" don't need to do anything. I need to focus on getting you the hell out the door and out of my life!",
        "Blair: That is not going to happen -- I told you that! We're family. And the whole time that you went missing, I never stopped looking for you, and if you don't believe me, you can call Chicago, talk to that grouchy old cop that I had to deal with every single day. Or you know what? Ask Miles, ask Marty. I was over at their house every other day. Or John McBain -- I was so obnoxious that he stopped taking my phone call. I did not rest until I found you and I'm not going to stop until you get your son back -- got it?",
        "Todd: I guess so -- in this hounding of John McBain, you guys got chummy, huh? Is that why you sided with him?",
        "Blair: I didn't side with him.",
        "Todd: Well, he threw me in jail on your say-so.",
        "Blair: That's because I was trying to protect you, Todd. And Marcie and Michael and that little boy.",
        "Todd: That little boy is mine. And he'd be here right now if it weren't for you.",
        "Blair: Oh, did you just think that they were going to hand him over without a fight? Is that what you thought? I mean, you know, if you'd stop for just one moment and thought about --",
        "Todd: No, I'm not going to stop! That's not who I am -- I don't stop. I go all the way until it's done.",
        "Blair: Well, this isn't your decision this time. It's the court's decision, and they're going to take a hell of a lot of things into consideration.",
        "Todd: Right, like the McBains are the pillars of the community, blah, blah, blah. I don't really care. That child is mine, I'm going to get him back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I -- I need to talk to you, ok?",
        "Rex: Here? I'm half-naked and you're -- a lot less wrinkled than when you came in before. I should hang my shirt in here while I work out.",
        "Marcie: Ok, listen -- hello, hello? Focus, ok? Todd is going to take Tommy away from us if we do not do something, like right now.",
        "Rex: Like what?",
        "Marcie: Like -- I don't know! We're going to have to figure it out, ok, so come on!",
        "Rex: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- where are we going?",
        "Marcie: Somewhere you're wearing more clothes and I'm not about to have heat stroke.",
        "Rex: Marcie, Marcie, Marcie! Wardrobe malfunc-- Marcie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh, the reason that I'm here is, um -- well, I'm here to see Jared, but -- because I just found out that he's been harassing my sister.",
        "Nash: Natalie?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Apparently, he wanted a job at B.E., he wouldn't take no for an answer, so he turns around and buys half of our vineyard. It's just a little too coincidental for me, so I came here to find out what the hell's going on.",
        "Jared: Natalie your sister.",
        "Jessica: Yes. Buchanan is my maiden name.",
        "Jared: Wow. That's news to me. And, yeah -- no, I did want a job at B.E. I mean, who wouldn't? It's a great company. But this was before our little card game and stumbling upon the opportunity of a lifetime, partnering in our vineyard. So, yeah, the interview -- that was just a coincidence.",
        "Jessica: It wasn't an interview, it was an ambush.",
        "Nash: Ambush?",
        "Jared: Huh. Getting a meeting with Natalie Buchanan is a little hard, so I had to get a little creative and she didn't appreciate it.",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Jared: And like her sister here, she's got a bit of a temper, so -- but, look, I meant no harm. I was just looking for an opportunity.",
        "Nash: She give you the job?",
        "Jessica: Of course she didn't.",
        "Nash: What's the problem?",
        "Jessica: The problem is that he's a liar. It's not a coincidence that he's here, and he always has some sort of agenda.",
        "Jared: Jessica, you seem to be suggesting that I have some sort of reason for being here, which makes no sense because I don't even know you. Do I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So we were there for Lindsay, you know, for whatever -- for moral support.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, so you're in her corner?",
        "Michael: Exactly. Todd Manning comes slamming into the courtroom, screaming and yelling about how Tommy is his son.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, that threw you a curveball. You had no clue?",
        "Michael: Last thing I expected.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, because how could you even put the two of them together? He's like a bucket full of bull and Tommy's like an armful of love.",
        "Michael: You know why that is, right? Because I am the only father that he has ever known. I'm the only father he's ever going to know.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, listen, man, I know you got to do what it takes, you know, and I get all that. I'm just saying that I d want to see Rex in the cross hairs, you know?",
        "Michael: Yeah. I -- I get that.",
        "[Roxy sighs]",
        "Michael: But your son is a big boy.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, he's a big, stupid boy is what he is and he'll do anything for a friend, and that includes forging a death certificate. Hey, listen, if I got that info, you got to know that Todd Manning's going to get it sooner or later.",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Michael: You know I can't talk to you about that, Rox. Hey, and you know that it's for your own good, right?",
        "Roxy: It's a little late thinking about your friends, don't you think?",
        "Marcie: We need eyewitnesses, injured parties -- oh. Hi, Rox.",
        "Roxy: Hey, don't \"hi, Roxy\" me, ok? What danger are you getting him into today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Uh -- they're not getting me into anything.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. We just need to talk to him for, like, five minutes, but alone.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, what do you think I -- chop suey? Hey, if you're going up against Todd Manning, you're going to need my help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Has it ever occurred to you that I'm not the problem here, Todd? No matter how much you want your son back, the courts may not give him back to you.",
        "Todd: Well, what do you got planned, Blair? You going to testify against me?",
        "Blair: Of course not.",
        "Todd: Well, what do you mean, \"of course not\"? I mean, you -- you told John McBain that I beat up Miles. What's to stop you from testifying that I'm a terrible father?",
        "Blair: Jack and Starr. And you're a wonderful father most of the time.",
        "Todd: \"Most of the time\"?",
        "Blair: Yeah, most of the time. But what kind of father are you going to be when you're on the lam with Tommy, huh? I know that's what you're thinking, Todd, because I can smell the smoke. Court rules against you and you take your son and you go on the run. And then what kind of life will Jack and Starr have and what kind of life are you going to have with Tommy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Do I know you?",
        "Jessica: No. You don't know anything about me. But it wouldn't be the first time that somebody tried to pull one over on my family.",
        "Jared: Well, and with Asa being recently deceased, it's understandable you'd be a little cautious.",
        "Nash: You knew Asa?",
        "Jared: Anyone in business knows him -- knows the stories. But I had some free time on my hands recently, so I read a biography of your grandfather -- God, they don't make them like that anymore, do they?",
        "Nash: No, they don't.",
        "Jared: And as I pointed out to your sister, with Asa gone, there's going to be a number of runs on B.E. I was offering to help protect her interests, as I'm sure she told you.",
        "Jessica: No, she told me you were a jackass.",
        "Nash: Hey.",
        "Jessica: That's what she said, Nash. She also said that we should be careful and that she didn't trust Mr. Banks.",
        "Jared: Ok, Nash -- despite how we met -- because no one likes to lose at poker, least of all me -- have our discussions been fruitful? Is it fair to say that you and I are on the same page as far as the future of our vineyard?",
        "Nash: More than fair, yeah.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nash: Saved by the bell. Oh -- that's the cork distributor from Napa. All right. Um -- I'm going to see if he can cut us a deal.",
        "Jared: Ok. Tell him your partner's threatening you with screw caps.",
        "Nash: That just might work.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Nash: You two play nice, all right?",
        "Jared: We will.",
        "Nash: Leo -- yeah. So, what can you do for me? Uh-huh.",
        "Jared: Now that we're finally alone, you want to tell me why you tried to ruin my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: I wish you well, Marty. I want you to know that.",
        "Natalie: You didn't have to be so cruel. Miles, wait. Miles, wait -- wait a minute. Are you ok?",
        "Miles: No. No, I'm -- I -- I don't even want to talk about it now.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry.",
        "Miles: I know. I -- I have to go, ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I am so sorry, John. I never meant to put you in an awkward situation.",
        "John: You didn't.",
        "Marty: You know, I'm not usually that impulsive.",
        "John: Hey, look, you kiss someone out of the blue you don't know -- that's impulsive.",
        "Marty: I can't believe she walked in right then, you know? I mean, Miles -- I couldn't really care less what he thinks about me, but you and Natalie, I -- I know it didn't work out, but you still care about each other.",
        "John: I'm not sure how she feels about me, but -- I still care about her. But it's a small town -- I guess these things are going to happen.",
        "Marty: Huh. Are you sure you're ok with this or are you just, you know, saying that to make me feel better?",
        "John: I guess it would've been interesting to see what you were going to do next.",
        "Marty: You're teasing me.",
        "John: Is it working?",
        "Marty: Maybe. I think she's got 16 kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Marcie said you guys needed my help.",
        "Michael: Yeah, we need to hire you. We -- we need you to help us make a case.",
        "Rex: Whatever you ed, Michael, and it's on the house. I don't want to see Tommy going to that snake any more than you do.",
        "Marcie: No, you're going to need our money, Rex. This is a very big job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So, you're not just talking damage control?",
        "Michael: No. We need to prove that Todd Manning is an unfit parent.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, and we do not care what it takes. Ok? Even if you have to overturn every rock from here to freakin' Honolulu, I don't care.",
        "Rex: So you're looking for dirt.",
        "Marcie: We're looking for a mud bath, and I don't care if it destroys Todd. We have to protect our son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know you. Courts make a decision, you ignore the decision and then you break the law.",
        "Todd: And then you'll go running to John McBain.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. I don't have to tell John McBain what a loose cannon you are. Huh -- why do you think he threw you in jail? He knows how you operate -- we all do. We know that you're an out-of-control menace.",
        "Todd: Why are you here? I've heard this lecture before.",
        "Blair: I am here because I don't want you to blow it!",
        "Todd: This is not your fight! Tommy is not your son -- you've got nothing to do with him. Do us both a favor -- get out of here! Stay out of it!",
        "Blair: You know, that's the second time you've thrown that in my face, that I'm not Tommy's mother. You think I don't know that? It's just mean, Todd, plain mean!",
        "Todd: I don't care -- I asked you to leave politely. I've tried to throw you out, you refuse to go. I -- I don't care. I don't take any responsibility.",
        "Blair: Of course you don't. You never take responsibility, do you? You never think about what Marcie might be feeling, but you know what? I do. I think about it because I've lost a child -- we both have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: If you want revenge for whatever it is you think that I did to you, come to me. Just leave my husband and my sister out of it -- they're not responsible for what happened to you, and the truth is neither am I.",
        "Jared: Oh, that could've fooled me.",
        "Jessica: Ok, Jared, then what are you waiting for? Why don't you just tell my husband?",
        "Jared: Why haven't you?",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God.",
        "Nash: All right. Well, Leo says he needs to think about it.",
        "Jared: Oh, he'll come around.",
        "Nash: Yeah. I told him I had a line on some cheap cork from Brazil -- wasn't too happy about it.",
        "Jared: Ha! See, you're wheeling and dealing.",
        "Nash: Yeah. You two ok? You work things out?",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah. You know, I don't blame Jessica for being suspicious. I'm just looking to move up.",
        "Nash: Ok.",
        "Jessica: Let's go.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jared: And I might have made a pass at her sister. Huh.",
        "Nash: I you. And, just for the record, I'm not too afraid for that redhead. I'm pretty sure she can take care of herself.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Nash: Sorry about that.",
        "[Jared laughs]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jared: That's right on time.",
        "Jared: And what took you so long?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[John sighs]",
        "Marty: Ice cream?",
        "John: Ice cream.",
        "Marty: Ice cream -- you know what? I thought you were going to grab us a couple of beers.",
        "John: Yeah, I know but it's illegal to drink down here. With my luck, I'd probably get arrest. Cheers.",
        "Marty: So how long is the suspension for?",
        "John: It's indefinite.",
        "Marty: They'll lift it. Hmm -- oh. This is cold.",
        "John: That's ice cream for you.",
        "Marty: Hmm, mm-hmm.",
        "John: It was warm today -- unusually hot for this time of year.",
        "Marty: Yes, yes, it was. Why are we talking about the weather?",
        "John: I don't know. I guess that's what people do, right?",
        "Marty: Yeah, but we're not \"people,\" you know? We -- we know each other. I just made a huge mistake, didn't I?",
        "John: What are you talking about?",
        "Marty: You know, I just -- whatever it is that we have between us, I just hope that I haven't -- ruined it, ok? And are you just going to sit here and stare at me because it would be really great if you said something.",
        "John: You didn't wreck anything.",
        "Marty: Good.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: It's nice here.",
        "Marty: The docks?",
        "John: I like the quiet. Looking out in the emptiness. It's like the rooftop where I live.",
        "Marty: Yeah, it's changed so much since I've been here, though. You know, when I was in California, I could just go out on the deck and there would be Miles of ocean. When we were in Ireland, God -- everything there is so beautiful.",
        "John: Well, wait a minute. Are you trying to say that Llanview is not as scenic as California?",
        "Marty: Of course not. No, it's -- not that I would know. I've just been, you know, so caught up with everything. It's just nice to finally be. You know what I mean? Just -- just letting the world in.",
        "John: How does that feel",
        "Marty: It feels good.",
        "John: It's a nice night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What the hell do you think you're doing, going after me, and then going after my sister? Are you trying to knock us off one by one? Because let me tell you something. My sister and I may be very different from one another, but we're both Buchanans, and that something around here.",
        "Jared: I can see that. Drink?",
        "Natalie: You men are all alike. You know, you just try to charm your way into our world. And you take whatever it is you want. And then when things get hard, or maybe we need something for a change, you just disappear. And the next time we see you, it's like we never met. And you're just standing there, on the docks, not a care in the world, because you've moved on. Well, it's your loss. All right? Because we don't need you.",
        "Jared: On the docks?",
        "Natalie: Or in my office -- whatever. It doesn't -- it doesn't matter. You're all the same.",
        "Jared: So, what happened on the docks?",
        "Natalie: Nothing. Nothing, ok? He can kiss whoever he wants. It doesn't matter. I don't care.",
        "Jared: I see.",
        "Natalie: No, see, you don't see, because you don't know anything about me.",
        "Jared: So I've been told. I think you need a drink.",
        "Natalie: Don't tell me what I need -- you know what? -- Or how I'm feeling.",
        "Jared: So, who was doing all this kissing?",
        "Natalie: My ex. With the woman I despise. Are you satisfied?",
        "Jared: No. But I think I'm getting a little bit of a buzz on.",
        "Natalie: Good for you.",
        "Jared: Give it a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: We've had a lot of losses, Todd. Both of us. Some we get over, some we don't. Some are just too much, that we can never accept it. They hurt. They hurt every day. You know, sometimes I think about our baby. I mean, I do. I -- I take the time to think about what he or would have been like in our lives, and how our lives would have been changed by that. Oh, that's why I just hope that you're taking the time to realize that it's just a miracle that Tommy is alive.",
        "Todd: You don't think I'm grateful?",
        "Blair: I don't know. You get so \"angry\" all the time! I think you -- you look past all the really good stuff. That it is actually a miracle that he's even alive.",
        "Todd: Yeah, he's alive, and he's been living in Llanview for months. Nobody told me. They kept it from me.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on.",
        "Todd: Yes! They stole him from me!",
        "Blair: Look, I don't know who knew what or when, but I can tell you this much. Marcie certainly didn't know. Did you see her face in court? It was like a truck hit her.",
        "Todd: I just don't care. It's -- that's history. There's nothing I can do about that.",
        "Blair: Yes, you can, Todd. You could go over there and work something out.",
        "Todd: That kid is mine.",
        "Blair: I'm not saying he's not, but as far as Tommy is concerned, Marcie is his mother, and Michael is his father, and I swear, you can't pretend that away.",
        "Todd: You see, that was the plan all along -- keep him as long as possible, and then play the pity card in court.",
        "Blair: O-- you really believe that?",
        "Todd: Yeah, why else keep it a secret?",
        "Blair: Maybe because they love him. Maybe because they took him into their home as a foster kid, and they adopted him.",
        "Todd: I really don't want to argue with you.",
        "Blair: Well, I really don't want to bring this up, either, but I guess I'm going to have to. Because we've both gone through something like this. When you took Jack --",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Blair: It hurt me, and it hurt him, and I'm not going to let you dance around here and pretend that you're the only one in this.",
        "Todd: What do you want from me?",
        "Blair: I want you to play by the rules, and let the courts make their decision and come up with a solution.",
        "Todd: Oh, ok. You want me to play by the rules? And if Marcie and Michael don't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Rex, we have to convince a judge it wouldn't be in Tommy's best interest to be placed with Todd.",
        "Marcie: Exactly, because he is a bad person and an even worse father.",
        "Michael: Let's just say \"unfit.\"",
        "Rex: I -- I get it. And if that's what it takes, I'm on it. It's just --",
        "Marcie: What? It's just what? Rex, do you want Tommy to be raised by Todd Manning?",
        "Rex: I wouldn't hire Todd Manning to water my plants. I'll bury him if that's what it takes. I just want to make sure we're all on the same page here. I do my job, the judge declares Todd to be an unfit father. What does that do to Starr and jack? They're his kids, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You know, as much as I hate him -- and I do -- I feel sorry for him. He doesn't have the slightest idea, I mean, where to begin with people. He's just so needy, and -- I don't know -- he just wants to be loved and be part of the family.",
        "John: Huh. He's got a funny way of showing it.",
        "Marty: Yeah. You know, blackmailing me into marrying him and then threatening me and you, Cole.",
        "John: Wait -- he threatened me?",
        "Marty: He said he would hurt you.",
        "John: And you chose not to tell me this?",
        "Marty: Yes, because I didn't know how you would react.",
        "John: Not good. Next time, tell me, ok?",
        "Marty: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: She's asleep.",
        "Jessica: Good, I paid the sitter.",
        "Nash: You ok?",
        "Jessica: I'm wired.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I can see that. That still about Jared? Because I'm telling you, he's got some smart ideas.",
        "Jessica: I am sorry. I feel stupid about barging in on you guys before.",
        "Nash: That's all right. No harm, no foul. Just protecting your sister, right? I think he understands that. You know, I don't think there's that much to worry about. Unless there's something you know that I don't.",
        "Jessica: What do I know about Jared? I -- he's your partner.",
        "[Bree cries]",
        "Nash: Spoke too soon. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Whoa, go easy there.",
        "Natalie: Don't tell me what to do.",
        "Jared: So let's review, shall we?",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Jared: You came here to ream me out about going into business with your brother-in-law, but on your way, you ran into your ex-boyfriend on the docks. And now, you're even angrier about him kissing this woman that's --",
        "Natalie: She is nasty. She is a two-faced little --",
        "Jared: Hey, no, no, no, I -- I get it. You hate her. I have an ex or two myself, and seeing them with someone else is not a fun time. Everything old seems new again, and -- that song you share, the scent of her hair --",
        "Natalie: Now I'm going to throw up.",
        "Jared: Just not on the shoes.",
        "[Natalie sighs]",
        "Jared: Oh.",
        "Natalie: You know, men are incapable of sentiment.",
        "Jared: If you say so.",
        "Natalie: No, they're like -- they're like sharks. They just move on.",
        "Jared: Some of us.",
        "Natalie: And you -- you are in the middle of my business, and I don't like it.",
        "Jared: So you've said. But that's not why you're here. You're here because you're mad at your ex, and who better to take it out on than a stranger that you don't even like? Am I right?",
        "Natalie: Just shut up and poor me another.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Do I want to drag Todd Manning through the mud? No. Will I? Absolutely. The man is completely out of control.",
        "Marcie: Look, we offered for Todd to see Tommy, to give him visitation.",
        "Michael: He refused, said he wanted full custody.",
        "Marcie: Could you imagine that? Could you imagine Tommy being taken away from us and given to Todd? And I'm not talking Blair and Todd here, Rex, I'm talking Todd, by his psychopathic lonesome, ok? No, we have got to do this. We have got to protect our son.",
        "Rex: Ok. I'll get on it right away. I mean, I'm sure there's more than enough evidence to persuade a judge to let you guys keep Tommy for now.",
        "Marcie: No! Listen to me, Rex -- not for now. Forever! Ok?",
        "Rex: You -- you do realize that Todd will fight back?",
        "Marcie: Fine. Then he can sue us from here --",
        "Rex: To Honolulu -- I hear you. I -- I -- I'm just -- I'm just putting us all on notice here, because Todd doesn't fight fair. If he thinks that you've put his relationship with Starr and jack at risk then --",
        "Michael: Look, Starr and Jack live with Blair, ok? Besides, that is a separate issue. I can't be worried about what Blair is going to do. I have to be worried about what I am going to do to keep my son. Look, we don't want to hurt anybody here, but he hasn't left us any choice.",
        "Marcie: No. You know, if I -- if we had just known about this a little sooner, we would have been able to prepare a case, and I -- I really didn't want to think about this earlier, but when Todd was screaming in that court, you knew. I mean, you knew, didn't you? Rex?",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Marcie: You know, I know that you were trying to do the right thing. But it left us blindsided, Rex. If you had told us then, we could have, you know, hired a lawyer. We could have researched the precedents for weeks. Months? Oh, great. Oh, great. How long have you known, Rex?",
        "Rex: For a while.",
        "Marcie: Oh --",
        "Rex: Since before I brought Todd the death certificate.",
        "Marcie: And all this time, you don't tell us? You don't tell anyone the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: I sang her a song, she went down.",
        "Jessica: Well, you've got the magic touch.",
        "Nash: Come here. Ahem. Oh. You're tense.",
        "Jessica: Maybe you should sing to me.",
        "Nash: There was a young woman who swallowed a fly",
        "Jessica: A lie?",
        "Nash: A fly.",
        "Jessica: Just, nothing.",
        "Nash: You know what you need?",
        "Nash: That.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. There's more where that came from.",
        "Nash: Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You feeling better? Maybe you should go.",
        "Natalie: I said don't tell me what to do.",
        "Jared: Yeah, we've covered that, but I'm just looking out for you, because you keep this pace up, who knows what's going to happen.",
        "Natalie: Good. Hit me.",
        "Jared: Hmm. Well, then on one condition. No more talk about your",
        "Natalie: Who?",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: You know, some women might get worried, drinking in a strange man's motel room.",
        "Natalie: I'm not \"some women.\"",
        "Jared: Hmm. No, you're not. To happy endings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You know, I just want you to know that it's not like me to just go around kissing someone.",
        "John: Well, that's good. Good to know.",
        "Marty: And even though I -- I didn't plan it, I -- it -- it just meant something to me, ok?",
        "John: Well, you've been through a lot.",
        "Marty: So you really don't mind?",
        "John: No, I don't mind.",
        "Marty: You sure?",
        "John: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: All this time, you just didn't tell anyone?",
        "Rex: How could I? I -- I didn't want to put anyone else at risk.",
        "Marcie: You could have told us, Rex.",
        "Rex: Oh, and -- and what would you have done, Marcie? I mean, seriously, think about it. You're a nice woman. Would you really have been able to keep this a secret -- kept Todd from his son? And I'm not just talking about fighting the custody here. Todd thought his son was dead. Would you really have been able to sit on the fact that his son was alive?",
        "Marcie: You know --",
        "Rex: Exactly.",
        "Marcie: I would have --",
        "Rex: Made a choice, and I didn't want you to have to do that. Because frankly, I thought that I could get away with it. At least, until Tommy was old enough to tell Todd where to get off.",
        "Michael: Rex took a gamble. He did it for us. He did it for Tommy, and he put himself at huge risk.",
        "Marcie: I know that, mike. And I -- I really don't mean to sound ungrateful. It's just -- you know, I'm really scared here, honey. I just --",
        "Michael: Honey, don't worry. We are going to figure something out. We are not going to let them take our son.",
        "Marcie: Honey, I'm going to go check on him, ok?",
        "Michael: You just checked on him.",
        "Marcie: I know. But I would like to see our son.",
        "Michael: Thank you for taking the heat there. You know, if Marcie ever found out at I knew the whole time --",
        "Rex: It wouldn't change a thing. Except maybe land you on the couch for a couple of weeks.",
        "Michael: Are you kidding me? She would never forgive me.",
        "Rex: Never's a long time. And with a little luck, I'll have backed up the dump truck and buried Todd in his own garbage by then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Todd: For what?",
        "Blair: For talking this out with me. And if you want to, you can call the kids in a couple of days. I'm sure they'll be very excited about telling you about their new teachers.",
        "Todd: Well, I'll stop by.",
        "Blair: They're grateful that you're back. It was tough on them. See you tomorrow.",
        "Todd: Tomorrow?",
        "Blair: Yeah, in court.",
        "Todd: Oh, no, no, no, don't go. I don't want you there. It's just a formality, anyway. They'll just enter the DNA tests into the record.",
        "Blair: I'm going to be there tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day until it's over. I'm on your side, Todd, so --",
        "Todd: Huh.",
        "Blair: Get over it.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Blair: She knows, Todd.",
        "Todd: Do you think he should be with the McBains?",
        "Marcie: You better have something, and it better be good.",
        "Jessica: Are you going to see Jared banks at all today?",
        "Nash: Why?",
        "Jessica: Because we need to talk about him.",
        "Natalie: Oh, God, no. Tell me I didn't. Did I?"
