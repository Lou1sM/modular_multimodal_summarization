        "Todd: No, it's okay, T\u00e9a. You can go home. They found Starr and Hope. It's about damn time. No, I wasn't talking to you. Yeah, they're fine. At least, that's what they're telling me. You know, if they don't get here soon... yeah, I'll call you back.",
        "Blair: Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mrs. Evans: How is he?",
        "Destiny: You saved Shaun, right? He's gonna be okay? Fine. I'll go see for myself. I want to be there when he wakes up.",
        "Greg: He's not gonna wake up, D. I am so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You know what? I'm going to go give everyone the good news. I know that Shaun Evans is gonna be asking about Starr and Hope.",
        "Clint: Okay. I'll catch up with you after I talk to Jessie.",
        "Nora: Okay, fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Nurse, can you call upstairs and make sure trauma is all in house?",
        "Nurse: Yes, Doctor.",
        "Jessica: Why? What's wrong?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Oh, it's just precautionary. I just want to get him up to the O.R., make sure I give him a good repair, make sure there's not anything that I missed.",
        "Jessica: No, no. You said he was fine. You said he was stable.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: And he is, which is why I can make a wider incision and get a better look. Jessica, he was gouged with a rusty steel bar. I just want to make sure there aren't any stray fragments or any bleeding that I didn't catch.",
        "Jessica: Well, that sounds like major surgery.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: He's going to be fine.",
        "Jessica: Do you promise?",
        "Brody: I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You sounded so scared on the phone.",
        "Starr: Well, I was, especially for Hope. I had to beg them to give her formula. She kept crying and crying.",
        "Todd: Those bastards.",
        "Starr: I was so afraid that Sergei was going to hurt her, especially when he was on the phone with John. He fired a gun and said that he had killed her.",
        "Todd: Starr, we don't have to go into all that now.",
        "Marty: Well, maybe she needs to talk about it.",
        "Starr: It was just awful being tied up to the chair the whole night, and they let me hold Hope, but I was just afraid that if I fell asleep, she would fall.",
        "Blair: Oh, honey.",
        "Starr: I don't know. You just think that you could reason with people -- you know, make a deal, and you tried, but they kept saying that they were going to take us away anyway, and I knew that if we got on that plane that we weren't going to make it.",
        "Todd: Starr, it's over.",
        "Starr: It's not! Look at what they did to you and to Shaun! I mean, is Shaun even okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: What are you talking about? Of course he's going to wake up.",
        "Greg: There was a, um -- a problem in the O.R.",
        "Destiny: No.",
        "Greg: Des --",
        "Destiny: He's fine. You promised me.",
        "Mr. Evans: What kind of a problem, Gregory?",
        "Destiny: Nothing he can't fix. Right, Greg? Tell them Shaun's going to be okay.",
        "Greg: I can't do that, Des.",
        "Destiny: What are you saying? He's dead? You killed him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I was so scared.",
        "Brody: Me, too.",
        "Jessica: I -- I told you how Nash died.",
        "Brody: The fall.",
        "Jessica: They, um -- they brought him here. He died in the E.R.",
        "Brody: It brings it all back.",
        "Jessica: No, this is different. This is different, you know? You're gonna be okay. I just -- I just got so afraid that I was gonna lose you.",
        "Brody: No. I'm gonna have a little surgery, a little recovery, a little rehab.",
        "Jessica: And then it's straight to the academy.",
        "Brody: You don't want me to be a cop?",
        "Jessica: I just don't ever want to get that call from the E.R.",
        "Natalie: How's the hero?",
        "Clint: The doctor said it was okay for us to all be in here.",
        "Bo: How you feeling, son?",
        "Brody: Lucky.",
        "Jessica: He has to have surgery.",
        "Brody: A mop-up.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, if there's anything that you need, you let me know.",
        "Brody: Thank you, sir.",
        "Bo: I've got to get back to the station, but I wanted to congratulate you on a job well done.",
        "Brody: Thank you, Commissioner.",
        "Bo: You know, Starr and the baby -- they owe you their lives.",
        "Brody: The whole team.",
        "Bo: You were the first one in. You took the hit. You know, your special ops training experience? It really served you well.",
        "Brody: Just doing the job.",
        "Bo: That's right. As far as I'm concerned, you're hired.",
        "Brody: Sir?",
        "Bo: The Llanview police department is proud to have you.",
        "Brody: Thank you, sir.",
        "Bo: Now, I've got to get back, but I'll see you soon.",
        "Brody: Soon.",
        "Clint: Well, congratulations. You got a very bright future ahead of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Stopped by the hospital. Brody's out of the woods.",
        "Starr: When I saw him in the warehouse, it was like a miracle when he was creeping in the shadows. He got Hope and me out of there. He really did save us.",
        "Blair: John, what about Shaun?",
        "John: Shaun was still in surgery, but I talked to his mom and she said it was looking good.",
        "Todd: No thanks to you. What were you thinking, man? Using an 18-year-old kid to bust up a drug ring.",
        "Marty: He was trying to keep my son out of prison.",
        "Todd: Oh, I see. By putting his life in danger and the lives of Starr and Hope. You're lucky nobody died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Shaun's not dead.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Oh! Thank you, Jesus! Oh, my God! You scared me half to death, Gregory.",
        "Destiny: I told you he was gonna be okay.",
        "Greg: I can't promise that, Des. I wish I could.",
        "Mr. Evans: What are you talking about, son?",
        "Greg: There was another bullet fragment, a smaller one that threatened a major blood vessel. I managed to grab it, but -- but you have to understand. Shaun had already gone through a major surgery, and to open him up again --",
        "Mrs. Evans: Gregory, what happened?",
        "Greg: He had a cardiac arrest on the table. It took a while to bring him back.",
        "Destiny: But you saved him. He's okay.",
        "Greg: He's unconscious.",
        "Destiny: But he'll wake up, right?",
        "Greg: There may have been some deep brain trauma.",
        "Destiny: So you'll fix it?",
        "Greg: No, Des. He was hurt so badly. I did everything that I could.",
        "Destiny: No. You're the best surgeon in the world. There's got to be something you can do.",
        "Greg: The only thing that we can do at this point is monitor him and keep him comfortable.",
        "Destiny: Till he wakes up. He can't just stay like that.",
        "Greg: Look, there have been cases where a patient may remain in what is called a persistent vegetative state.",
        "Mr. Evans: Are you saying that your brother may never wake up again?",
        "Greg: At this moment, Dad, I honestly don't know.",
        "Destiny: What do you mean you don't know? You have to know. You're the best. You promised me you could fix him.",
        "Greg: I did the best that I could.",
        "Destiny: Then why did this happen? Answer me! What did you do to him? You said you could fix him. You promised me! You promised me!",
        "[Destiny crying]",
        "Destiny: I want to see him.",
        "Greg: He's still in the recovery room, but once they bring him to the ICU, I'll take you down to see him.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Baby, you have to be strong for your brother.",
        "Destiny: Shaun's the strongest person I know. He took how many bullets? And then he made it to the hospital. And he made it through surgery. And then you had to go back in there and do this to him.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Baby. Baby. Greg was just trying to help him.",
        "Destiny: And look at what he did.",
        "Matthew: I'll go after her.",
        "Nora: I thought Shaun was stable.",
        "Rachel: We all did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So Jessie tells me that you've been working undercover.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, mild-mannered bartender by day and superhero undercover cop at night.",
        "Brody: Not quite.",
        "Clint: Well, he's not only brave, he's modest. Jessie, I think you got a keeper here. Son, I'm proud of you. After everything that my daughter's been through in the last year, I was praying for a miracle... a miracle that would give Jessie her life back. And now when I look at the two of you, I realize that my prayers have been answered... and that you're the miracle, Brody.",
        "Brody: She's the same thing to me, sir.",
        "Clint: You call me Clint, all right?",
        "Natalie: You know, Brody, I just want you to know he does not say this to everyone.",
        "Clint: I admit that I set the bar pretty high when it comes to my daughter. See, the one thing I do regret is you never got to know Jessie's grandfather, because I got a feeling my pa would have liked you.",
        "Natalie: He's in. You okay?",
        "Jessica: I'm just glad this is... over.",
        "Clint: I believe that it's just beginning.",
        "Brody: Looking forward. A new feeling.",
        "Clint: You know what you can look forward to is a big steak dinner to celebrate. 'Cause Starr Manning -- she's very dear to this family because, well, you know, the baby that you saved. Once upon a time, she was ours for a while.",
        "Brody: I know, sir. Clint.",
        "Clint: There you go. Natalie, why don't we...",
        "Natalie: Yes.",
        "Clint: Give the two of them some time together?",
        "Jessica: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Clint: And another thing, I love you, Jess.",
        "Jessica: I love you, too.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Brody: You're not happy.",
        "Jessica: I am. Of course I am.",
        "Brody: Talk to me.",
        "Jessica: Uh, well, yesterday, you were going to the police academy, and now today you have a job waiting for you when you get out.",
        "Brody: And...?",
        "Jessica: I thought I'd have more time.",
        "Brody: For what?",
        "Jessica: To talk you out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: John saved Starr's life and Hope's, and he brought down a corrupt mayor.",
        "Todd: And if it had gone the other way? Cole gets made and he gets shot dead in his jail cell.",
        "Starr: What jail cell?",
        "Cole: John had to arrest me. He was trying to protect me.",
        "Starr: They put you in a jail cell to protect you?",
        "Todd: His cover got blown.",
        "Starr: I thought you said you wouldn't say anything.",
        "Marty: You knew?",
        "Starr: Well, he saw Cole selling drugs, and he thought that it was for real.",
        "Todd: Right, and tell them what I did. I came to you, right?",
        "Starr: Yes, you did. And I told him that he was really working undercover and you promised that you wouldn't tell anyone.",
        "Todd: Listen, John's the one who put you in danger.",
        "Marty: No, John was on top of it.",
        "Todd: Oh, really?",
        "John: It's over now, Manning. Why don't you just drop it?",
        "Todd: Ah, why? Who are you protecting now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Evans: I know you did the best you could, son. I just want to understand. See, I thought it was a matter of you just pulling a piece of the bullet out, and once you got it he'd be fine.",
        "Greg: That was the hope, Dad. But you have to understand. The fragment was smaller than a grain of sand.",
        "Mr. Evans: But you had all those pictures of his head.",
        "Greg: Yeah, but seeing the fragment and actually removing it are two different things. Look, ma, you remember when Shaun and I were little kids. We'd run around barefoot and sometimes we'd get splinters.",
        "Mrs. Evans: You were always getting those.",
        "Greg: Yeah, and you'd go out and get the needle and the tweezers and --",
        "Mrs. Evans: And my glasses.",
        "Greg: Yeah, and then you'd have to dig in there. And sometimes it would be hard to get to even though you could see it and it looked easy, but it wasn't. And sometimes you'd have to dig deeper, and we'd holler and --",
        "Mr. Evans: Son, you had to dig for the thing.",
        "Greg: Yeah, Dad. I pulled the fragment out, and a piece of it broke off, and it got embedded in the wall of the vessel and, um... and I was afraid to leave it there.",
        "Mrs. Evans: So you got it? You got all the pieces? Right? So he can just heal up.",
        "Greg: No. Unfortunately, a brain is not a foot. It's a very delicate thing. And remember, the damage that the bullet did to Shaun even before I got here and then there was the surgery and the trauma. And once the brain swells, there's all kinds of complications.",
        "Mrs. Evans: Yes, but swelling goes down, right?",
        "Greg: There's so much about the brain we still don't know, especially after trauma.",
        "Mrs. Evans: You've done this surgery hundreds of times, right?",
        "Greg: Uh-huh.",
        "Mrs. Evans: And this has never happened before.",
        "Greg: No.",
        "Mrs. Evans: So why today? Why with your brother?",
        "Mr. Evans: Phylicia.",
        "Phylicia: Why did this have to happen today? Why today? Why did this have to happen?",
        "Greg: Mama. I wish I had the answer. There were so many variables, and he had been through so much.",
        "Phylicia: No. No. See, you didn't say that before. Hmm? You said he was going to be fine.",
        "Mr. Evans: Phylicia, we know that he did the best he could.",
        "Greg: And I failed. I failed Shaun. I failed all of you! I am so sorry.",
        "Phylicia: I just don't understand.",
        "Mr. Evans: But we know that you did all that you could, son.",
        "Greg: No, no, no, no, no! No!",
        "Phylicia: I don't understand. I don't understand.",
        "Nora: Would you like me to take you down to recovery?",
        "Phylicia: I don't understand.",
        "Mr. Evans: Yeah. Thank you. Come on, honey. Come on, let's go look in on Shaun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Des? Do you want to be alone?",
        "Destiny: No.",
        "Matthew: Here. I stole these from the nurses' station.",
        "Destiny: I don't get how this could happen. Greg is the best. He's perfect.",
        "Matthew: Maybe it didn't have anything to do with Greg. I mean, Shaun was shot.",
        "Destiny: But he was okay. You saw him. [Sniffs] He was talking and smiling. Greg said he could fix him. All Shaun had to do was trust him, and he would be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, who was it, John? Who blew your operation?",
        "John: Well, you going to the mayor didn't help.",
        "Starr: I can't believe that you did that.",
        "Todd: How was I supposed to know he was a crook?",
        "Blair: Well, you might have tried checking his record.",
        "Marty: Or talked to John.",
        "Todd: Yes, John. I've received more help from a tree stump.",
        "Starr: I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have said anything to my dad, but he just wouldn't leave it alone.",
        "Todd: Well, he was selling drugs. What was I supposed to do, look the --",
        "Starr: You were supposed to trust me. Instead you almost got us all killed!",
        "Marty: Okay, okay, okay. It was an impossible situation, and right or wrong, everyone was just acting to protect their children. So, let's just take a minute, stop blaming each other, and be grateful that everyone is alive. Cole is safe. Starr and the baby are safe. And I, for one, am overjoyed.",
        "Blair: She's right, for once. We all should be grateful that no one was hurt any more than they were.",
        "Bo: Nora just called. She's at the hospital. There's a problem with Shaun. They had to take him back into surgery, and now he's in a coma. He may not come out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: He promised me that he had it under control, that all he had to do was pull out the fragment and Shaun would be fine.",
        "Matthew: If Shaun hadn't gone into cardiac arrest...",
        "Destiny: You're blaming this on Shaun?",
        "Matthew: No. I'm blaming it on the thug who shot him.",
        "Matthew: I'm just trying to say that Greg was doing what he had to do. He didn't have a choice. I mean, he couldn't leave that piece of bullet where it was. That could have killed Shaun... or even worse.",
        "Destiny: Worse?",
        "Matthew: It could have paralyzed him. He had to take the risk. Sometimes things happen you just can't control.",
        "Destiny: What, this? I can't talk to him, can't tell him how sorry I am.",
        "Matthew: Sorry for what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: I keep going over it and over it. I pulled the fragment out. All his vitals were good. We ran a scan. I spotted the piece that had broken off, found it in the wall of the vessel. And then, I was trying to do as little damage as possible to make sure that I'd gotten everything out. And Vivian warned me.",
        "Rachel: Vivian?",
        "Greg: She was observing. She was saying, \"You're going in too deep.\"",
        "Rachel: But if it was the only way, you couldn't have anticipated any --",
        "Greg: It's my job to anticipate, to avoid complications.",
        "Rachel: But if you had no other choice --",
        "Greg: There are always choices. Vivian told me to stop, to close him up, to only go back in there if you have to.",
        "Rachel: If you left that fragment in, it would have killed him.",
        "Greg: And now my brother's in a coma. And knowing Shaun, he'd rather be dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You were okay with me going to the academy.",
        "Jessica: I know, I know, right? I just, uh... [Jessica sighs] You seemed so excited, and you were happy. I just didn't think about it till now the fact that you'd be in danger.",
        "Brody: So I won't do it.",
        "Jessica: No! No! You're good at it, and my Uncle Bo needs you, so...",
        "Brody: But what do you need?",
        "Jessica: I need you to be happy.",
        "Brody: You make me happy, you and Bree. So if me being a cop is going to make you...",
        "Jessica: Crazy?",
        "Brody: Worry.",
        "Jessica: Of course I'm gonna worry.",
        "Brody: Then I'll tell your uncle no.",
        "Jessica: Just like that?",
        "Brody: Just like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: But I thought John said that Mrs. Evans said that Shaun was gonna be all right.",
        "Bo: Yeah, he made it through the first surgery in pretty good shape.",
        "Marty: The first surgery?",
        "Bo: Yeah, the bullet shattered. They thought that they got it all the first time, but there were a few fragments that...",
        "Starr: Oh, my.",
        "Bo: Lodged in his brain.",
        "Starr: Oh, my God.",
        "Marty: So they went back in.",
        "Bo: And there were complications. He went into cardiac arrest and then lapsed into a coma.",
        "Starr: I told him to keep that guy from getting to Hope, and that is why this all happened.",
        "Blair: No, sweetheart, he would have done it anyway. That's his job. He had to protect you and Hope, all right?",
        "Starr: Wait. Was Rachel at the hospital?",
        "Bo: She saw him just before he went back in to surgery.",
        "Starr: They had a date tonight, a really special date.",
        "Blair: You know, Shaun was just such a big guy. He seemed so indestructible.",
        "Todd: Let's go home.",
        "Blair: Come on, babe. Come on.",
        "Marty: You know what, that's a good idea. You gonna take Starr home?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Okay. I'll catch up with you later?",
        "Cole: Yeah. Thanks for everything. Let's get out of here.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Bo: You okay?",
        "John: Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: When Blair was in the hospital and he had to pinch hit with the kids, I called him Gary Poppins.",
        "[Matthew chuckles]",
        "Destiny: It's not funny. [Sniffs]",
        "Matthew: Yes, it is funny. I mean, you're funny. He knew that.",
        "Destiny: I wasn't trying to be funny. I was trying to make him feel bad. We got into it about Greg and how I worship him -- at least that's what Shaun said. [Sniffs] And so I said, \"Sure. Why not? He's a superstar, and... You're just a Gary Poppins.\" And then he had to go and get himself shot. And now I'll never be able to tell him that I didn't mean it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You okay?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'm just glad it's all over and that Starr and the baby are all right.",
        "Blair: You know, none of this is your fault. John said so.",
        "Todd: Hmm. And Shaun?",
        "Blair: What do you mean?",
        "Todd: I did this to him. If it weren't for me, he'd be out on the town with his girlfriend right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It must have been awful -- you knowing how much trouble we were in, but you weren't able to do anything about it.",
        "Cole: It's not as bad as what you went through. I should have never taken that deal.",
        "Starr: Come here. What are you talking about? I didn't want you to go to Statesville. And now you don't have to. You can be home with us, and we can all be together. I just wish...",
        "Cole: Shaun, I know.",
        "Starr: He's like this because of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: While I was on the floor, I managed to pull my phone out and S.O.S. Shaun.",
        "Blair: Listen. A lowlife shot Shaun. They're the ones to blame.",
        "Todd: I led him into it.",
        "Blair: No. Shaun was your security. That was his job, and he loved it.",
        "Todd: No, no, no. I treated him like he was a manservant.",
        "Blair: You did not.",
        "Todd: He hated me.",
        "Blair: He did not hate you. You know, I think you annoyed him sometimes, but you annoy a lot of people. But we still love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Listen. I want to go catch up with -- with Nora. Can you stay here in case Brody has to go into surgery before I come back?",
        "Natalie: Of course. Of course.",
        "Clint: Natalie, I love you.",
        "Natalie: Love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm not gonna let you give up an opportunity like this.",
        "Brody: Listen to me. Come here. I saw plenty of action overseas. What I want more than anything...is a family -- a woman I love, kids.",
        "Jessica: I can't -- I can't do this. You'll regret it.",
        "Brody: No, I won't.",
        "Jessica: Then I'll regret it. Okay? Okay? I'm not gonna let you give up a job that you love just because I'm afraid.",
        "Brody: I don't want you to worry.",
        "Jessica: Listen. Listen. Nash fell through a skylight at a board meeting, okay? No one could have predicted that. At least this way, I'll be prepared, you know?",
        "Brody: You want to live like that?",
        "Jessica: Who knows? Maybe we'll appreciate each other more, okay?",
        "Brody: If it gets to be too much, you'll tell me, and we'll make a change.",
        "Jessica: Deal.",
        "Nurse: They'll be bringing you up to the O.R. in a few minutes.",
        "Brody: Hey. I'm gonna be fine. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Shaun knows you love him.",
        "Destiny: But he thinks I don't respect him, and I do. Greg may save lives, but so does Shaun.",
        "Matthew: It's not a contest.",
        "Destiny: No? Tell that to them. They've been going head to head since Shaun was born, and I've been taking sides.",
        "Matthew: So he's used to it.",
        "Destiny: I shouldn't have said what I did.",
        "Matthew: Destiny, he knows you were teasing.",
        "Destiny: You like getting teased about being in a wheelchair?",
        "Matthew: That's different.",
        "Destiny: How? I made my brother feel bad about never going to college, about being a blue-collar guy.",
        "Matthew: Look. From what I can see, there are two kinds of people in this world: Career people, like your brother Greg, and people who work but are all about their family and friends.",
        "Destiny: That's Shaun. He could always tell when I was messed up. And he'd always keep after me, no matter how mean I'd get, until I'd tell him what was bothering me. He'd tell me to get over myself when I needed telling, or he'd say he loved me and that it'd be okay. Why couldn't I do that for him? Why did I have to needle him and make him feel bad?",
        "Matthew: Because you're a cheerleader. You are! I mean, you encourage people. And, okay, sometimes it may involve a little bit of yelling, but, I mean, look how you got him to go after Rachel. You think that would have happened if you hadn't kept needling him? Look. Shaun knows you love him.",
        "Destiny: I can't lose him, do you understand? Not like this. Not yet. I need him to wake up, to open his eyes and see me. Oh, God. Shaun!",
        "[Destiny sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Greg sighs]",
        "Greg: It's my fault. I convinced my brother to let me do the surgery.",
        "Rachel: You told me there was nobody close by who was qualified.",
        "Greg: We could have flown anybody in here -- from New York, from Baltimore, Philadelphia. I'm not the only neurosurgeon in the world.",
        "Rachel: You said he couldn't wait --",
        "Greg: No, I couldn't wait! I wanted to be the one to save my little brother, to prove to all of you that -- that I was the greatest!",
        "Rachel: Don't do this to yourself.",
        "Greg: Do what? Tell the truth? Look. The fact is Shaun is the one who got himself shot up. Fact is Dr. Gangemi is the one who rode to his rescue. And that was bothering me. I wanted to be the man. I wanted to be the one to get him there and make it right!",
        "Rachel: You did everything you could. You're not God.",
        "Greg: Oh, no. Yes, I am! Don't you read my press? Or listen to my little sister? The great God Evans can do no wrong! And my brother let me operate on him because he believed all of that.",
        "Rachel: Your brother let you operate on him because he trusted you!",
        "Greg: Ah!",
        "Rachel: And not because you're infallible -- because he knew that you would do everything in your power to save his life.",
        "Greg: Well, you wouldn't let me operate on your brother. Why should I be able to operate on mine, huh? Oh, you don't have an answer for that one, do you?",
        "Rachel: Matthew is a minor.",
        "Greg: Oh, and you're through with Shaun, anyway, so to hell with him.",
        "Rachel: That is a lousy thing to say.",
        "Greg: Well, I'm a lousy human being.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, sometimes. That has nothing to do with your ability in the operating room.",
        "Greg: But everything to do with me talking my patients onto the table, isn't it?",
        "Rachel: This was hardly an elective surgery. You said it yourself, that fragment could have killed him. And, okay, he's unconscious, and we don't know if he's gonna recover, but at least he still has a chance. So why don't you stop beating up on yourself and me? How about you deal with what's really going on here?",
        "Greg: Lay it on me, Counselor.",
        "Rachel: You love your brother. You are scared to death that he won't wake up, and it is breaking your heart.",
        "Greg: Unh!",

        "Marty: John, it's me.",
        "Marty: Hey. Uh... I know you're feeling badly about Shaun.",
        "John: It's my fault.",
        "Marty: Shaun was hired by Todd to protect his family, and he might have given his life trying to do that, but that's not your fault. Feeling sad and feeling responsible are two different things. You -- you took down a corrupt administration, you broke up a drug syndicate. And you saved my son... and my granddaughter... and her mother. And I'm not gonna let you forget that. And... I'm staying the night, whether you like it or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I got to go.",
        "Blair: Where are you going?",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a's waiting for me. See you.",

        "Male Singer: ...It's gone little by little it fritters away try as you may you can never replace it a moment of beauty you stumble upon as long as you treasure whatever it is whatever it is can never be wasted so if we all turn to dust better to have loved and lost 'cause everything has a cause so if you're gonna spend time spend it upon me spend it upon me just give me your time I don't want your money whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa I'd crawl, then I'd walk then I'd run but then I'd stumble and fall somewhere between the love and the lust I tried my best I was maladjusted and I'm not saying that I know it all maybe I'm a little more self-aware still get scared but I've learned to trust it so when it comes to us I've weighed up all the odds I bet that this is love so if you're gonna spend time spend it upon me spend it upon me just give me your time I don't want your money whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa"
