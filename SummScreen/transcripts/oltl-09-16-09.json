        "John and Marty wake up together. Dorian admits to Langston, Starr, and Cole that she inadvertently blew Cole's cover. Bo holds a press conference and presents Cole, John, Brody, and Oliver with Medals of Honor for their work on the task force that broke up a drug ring and exposed a corrupt mayor. Dorian convinces the mayor to resign and makes the announcement at the end of Bo's press conference. She later reveals that she will be running for mayor against Viki.",
        "Fish tells Layla and Cristian that he is concerned about his parents' arrival tomorrow. They give him the book that Cristian bought for him, \"How To Tell Your Parents You're Gay.\" Fish thanks them for the book but tells them that no matter how he says it, they will not accept it. Kyle tells Roxy that he has been readmitted to medical school and his record expunged. They watch Bo's press conference on television together. When Fish comes to the Buenos Dias to meet some guys from work to celebrate, he runs into Kyle who tells him he is very proud of him. When Kyle leaves to take a call from his new boyfriend, Fish decides he doesn't feel like celebrating, so he goes home and checks out the book Cris gave him. A middle-aged couple comes into the Buenos Dias and asks Cristian for directions. He notices that the address they are looking for is his apartment so he asks them is they are the Fishes. They are; they have arrived a day early to surprise Oliver. After unsuccessfully trying to get Bo and John to participate in David's reality TV show, Ford gives up and leaves Llanview."

        "Cristian: Yeah, man. You got to own it.",
        "Oliver: No, I don't deserve this, especially not from you.",
        "Layla: Forget about that already. We're celebrating whether you like it or not. Cristian got up at the crack of dawn, bought the newspaper. I did the frame and balloons. Cool, right?",
        "Cristian: Yeah. And we made you a huge breakfast, so you better be hungry.",
        "Oliver: This is -- this is really too much.",
        "Layla: Come eat. You don't want to be late for work.",
        "Oliver: No, I am not going in today. I am taking my first day off since I joined the force.",

        "Viki: Yes, you are, Brody. Jessica's absolutely right. I am delighted to see you looking so well.",

        "Brody: Why?",
        "Jessica: Oh, I don't know. For some reason, Bo wanted us to all go down there.",

        "David: Dad! Top of the morning to you.",
        "Bo: David, what are you doing here?",
        "David: What, are you kidding? It's bring your kid to work day.",
        "Bo: All right -- ahem -- you have to get out of here. And take them with you.",
        "David: But today is the day after a major, dangerous drug bust, and I want to hear firsthand how justice is served from my dad, the hero.",
        "David: And here we go. Starr Mann -- genius. Starr Manning and her beautiful baby daughter are alive and well this morning thanks to the commissioner of police, my father. Talk about bravery. Talk about personal sacrifice. Those drug dealers could've brought this town to its knees, but you wouldn't have it. No, you wouldn't. I can honestly say that I have never been more proud of someone than I am of my father right this very moment. Except for maybe myself when I landed that reality TV show gig. Pa, can you hear me? What --",
        "Bo: How the hell did you get in here, David?",
        "David: We have a permit from the mayor.",
        "Bo: Oh, from the mayor? The one that's locked up downstairs for corruption, illegal drug trafficking, attempted murder?",
        "David: Well, then. Glad we got that permit nice and early.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you got it from him. Now it's null and void.",
        "David: Dad, come on. Can't you make an exception for your firstborn son? I finally have a chance to be somebody.",
        "Bo: Yeah -- somebody locked up next to the mayor down there in his cell. Keep it up.",
        "David: Mm-hmm. Classic transference. You're mad at Matthew for suing you, so you're taking it out on me.",
        "Bo: Listen, I'm not mad at -- at anybody yet. But you and your reality TV show are gonna have to go now.",
        "David: All right, uh, guys, it's okay. I'll -- I've got an idea.",
        "Ford: You better.",
        "Bo: No. Get out now or I'll throw you all in jail.",
        "David: Come on, Pa.",

        "David: All right, go.",

        "David: Wow. Look at that.",
        "Bo: No, what -- what the hell are you doing?",
        "David: Dad, just trust me on this. Trust me. Come here a second. Listen, if I know my dad, he didn't get himself one of these. But from what I read about what you did last night, you deserve one just as much as those guys on the front page of the paper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Oh, that was some big drug bust last night. The cops did an amazing job.",
        "Kyle: That they did.",
        "Roxy: Hey, I haven't seen you around. I figured maybe you and Fish got back together again.",
        "Kyle: No, that -- that's not gonna happen ever.",
        "Roxy: That's too bad. He's a cutie, that Fish.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, well, I'm dating somebody else now, a really great guy. So me and Fish? It's over.",

        "Oliver: You know what? It's probably better that I go in today. It'll keep my mind off the fact that my parents are coming tomorrow.",
        "Layla: Tomorrow?",
        "Cristian: Your parents are coming tomorrow?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. I know, right? And they're dying to meet my new girlfriend.",
        "Layla: Oh, boy. Sorry.",
        "Oliver: Very funny.",
        "Cristian: No, but seriously, man, come on. You're a big hero now. Your parents can't ignore that.",
        "Oliver: No. I could save a dozen mothers and their kids, and my parents will still freak out if they find out I'm gay.",
        "Layla: Speaking of that, Cristian got you something he thought might help.",
        "[Oliver chuckles]",
        "Oliver: This is -- wait a second. You think that I should come out to my parents?",
        "Layla: Don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So we heard that Bo offered you a position with the police department.",
        "Brody: Well, I still need some training. But with my time on the Seals and my work on the bust last night... but I made a deal with Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Oh, Brody, no, no, no. It's okay.",
        "Brody: No, I mean it. If you're not comfortable with me being a cop, I'll drop out. You just say the word.",
        "Jessica: Hey, I can handle it. I just want you to be happy.",
        "Viki: I must say I had no idea you were working undercover.",
        "Brody: That was kind of the point, ma'am.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Charlie: Whoa, hey, hey, hey.",
        "[Brody groans]",
        "Charlie: Are you okay?",
        "Brody: Yeah, fine. Just don't make me laugh.",
        "Jessica: Well, tell them what you had to do. He had to pretend that he was a strung-out drug addict.",
        "Viki: Ew.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Brody: To make it look like Cole was being pressed for more drugs. I just wish I could've kept his cover from getting blown. We might've prevented what happened.",
        "Jessica: No, there's no way you could've prevented that. Somebody told the mayor about Cole.",
        "Viki: Really? Well, that person should be locked up right alongside the mayor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You must've been traumatized by the experience.",
        "Starr: It was horrible, really. But everything's okay now except for Shaun.",
        "Langston: Is there any way that maybe he could wake up out of that coma?",
        "Dorian: No one can say that with certainty.",
        "Cole: What -- what does that mean?",
        "Dorian: The kind of coma that he's in, uh, the prognosis is not good.",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Langston: Those guys were here because the mayor was trying to get back at Cole, right? But how did your cover even get blown in the first place?",
        "Cole: I don't know. But somehow the mayor found out.",
        "Starr: It was my fault. I told my dad because he got really mad that -- he thought that Cole was selling drugs.",
        "Langston: So your dad's responsible for everything that's happened?",
        "Dorian: No, no. Much as I always like to blame Todd for anything that happens, I can't.",
        "Cole: Why not?",
        "Dorian: Because I did it. I'm the one who told the mayor about you.",
        "Starr: You put Cole, Hope, and me in danger so that you could suck up to the mayor and his jerk son?",
        "Dorian: I humbly apologize, and I ask for your forgiveness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I think my issues of trust have been effectively dealt with.",
        "John: That's good.",
        "Marty: Maybe I should let you sleep in. I knew you were tossing and turning last night.",
        "John: I'm sorry if I kept you awake.",
        "Marty: No, no. I knew you were thinking about Shaun. Nothing more you could've done. He might be dead right now if you hadn't found him.",
        "John: I don't know.",
        "Marty: Shaun's in that condition because a criminal was able to get a gun, and then that criminal shot him. It's not because of anything you did or didn't do. But if anyone's to blame, it's that creep who blew Cole's cover. I'd like to get my hands on whoever put my son and grandchild and Starr in danger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Starr, I'd never do anything knowingly to hurt you. You have to believe that. Cole? Do you forgive me?",
        "Cole: You know what? You telling the mayor about me really isn't that big a deal after everything that's happened. I mean, he was about to find out anyway. I mean, it's not nothing, but I know you didn't mean for anyone to get hurt. We all know that.",
        "Dorian: Starr?",
        "Starr: It was clueless, but Cole's right. I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So Jessica tells me you're Viki's campaign manager.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I guess I am.",
        "Viki: And he is very, very good at it.",
        "Charlie: Well, it's pretty hard to be bad at it. Now that Lowell's locked up, this election should be a piece of cake.",
        "Jessica: Wait. No one's running against you?",
        "Viki: No, not so far. But, darling, it's early yet, you know? The thing is I'm not gonna have anyone to debate, which is shame because I was really looking forward to that.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my mother, the mayor. That's excellent.",
        "Viki: Thank you, sweetheart. But in spite of Charlie's optimism, let us not assume that I've got this all sewn up.",
        "Brody: Oh, in case someone else joins the race?",
        "Viki: That. But right now because the mayor refuses to drop out.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, which is crazy because that guy's being held without bail.",
        "Jessica: Whoa. Somebody should really convince him to resign.",
        "Viki: They've tried. His lawyers, his advisors, everyone close to him have tried. He refuses.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and I wonder if Dorian has anything to do with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: You know, who I blame most of all is Lowell. If he could've gotten away with this, he wouldn't care if we all died.",
        "Langston: I can't even believe he's not resigning. What kind of head trip is he on?",
        "Dorian: Oh, he's an arrogant narcissist. He's never been held responsible for anything he's ever done. Remember when he had Bo fired from the police department and he hired that horrible Lee Ramsey?",
        "Langston: Yeah. But as I recall, you were all for that.",
        "Dorian: Nonsense.",
        "Starr: What did he say when you told him you quit?",
        "Dorian: Well...",
        "Starr: You did quit, didn't you? You're aren't still working for him?",
        "Dorian: I will as soon as I have the chance.",
        "Starr: Are you joking?",
        "Langston: When -- when you have the chance? That guy tried to have Cole killed! And when that didn't work, he had his goons come in here, shoot Shaun, and kidnap Starr and Hope!",
        "Dorian: You're right.",
        "Starr: Where are you going?",
        "Dorian: I'm going to go get changed, I'm going to find the mayor, and I am going to quit. But not before I get that bastard to do the first honorable thing he's done since he became mayor: resign!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: It's not like you to take the day off.",
        "John: Actually, I'm rethinking it.",
        "Marty: Why? Because I have to go into work?",
        "John: No. Sitting around here all day staring at the walls kind of defeats the purpose.",
        "Marty: I know I should be talking you into taking the time, but I kind of like you to have to be with me.",
        "John: Well, you know, I have more than one.",
        "Marty: Yeah? Okay, well, save them up. Maybe we'll go on a trip.",
        "John: Maybe we will.",
        "Marty: But you really should go into work today.",
        "John: Why is that, hmm? Is there something I don't know?",
        "Marty: Who, me? What would I know?",
        "John: Something you're not telling me?",
        "David: There he is -- Llanview's no-nonsense hero. Looks like you got lucky. Saving Marty Saybrooke's grandbaby really paid off for you, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So this new guy, is he a keeper?",
        "Kyle: Maybe. I mean, he's a great guy. I like him enough to try to straighten up my act, so to speak.",
        "Roxy: Well, Nattie and Jared dropped the charges. That ought to help.",
        "Kyle: Yeah. And I talked with the dean of the med school. I managed to get readmitted and to get my record expunged. So it looks like I'm actually gonna graduate this year.",
        "Roxy: Right on. I always had faith in you.",
        "Kyle: No, you don't.",
        "Roxy: Yes, I -- all right, I'm full. But I do now. And since Dr. Michael is gone, we need a new doctor in Angel Square.",
        "Kyle: If they'll have me.",
        "Roxy: Oh, they'll have you if I have anything to say about it, and I got a lot to say about it.",
        "Kyle: You know, part of me just wishes I could tell Oliver, you know? He told the guy I'm dating that I'm some kind of loser, that -- he tried to warn him off of me.",
        "Roxy: Is he jealous?",
        "Kyle: Not that he knows of. He's so deep in the closet, he thinks he has a girlfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: One reviewer called it \"an essential survival guide for coming out.\"",
        "Oliver: Yes, I see that.",
        "Cristian: I hope it's okay. I didn't want to freak you out.",
        "Layla: But with your parents coming, it just seemed --",
        "Oliver: No, I get it.",
        "Cristian: You know, my mom saw it. She thought it was mine.",
        "Oliver: Oh, yeah? How'd that work out for you?",
        "Cristian: Well, she was kind of bummed when I told her I wasn't gay. She thought it explained everything about me.",
        "Layla: Yeah, she really did.",
        "Oliver: Oh, wait a second. You didn't tell her that it was for me, did you? Because you guys are the only two that know.",
        "Cristian: We didn't say anything.",
        "Layla: But do you really want to keep this a secret?",
        "Oliver: You know, this is -- this is really nice of you guys, and I'm sure there's some great stuff in here. But with my folks, it doesn't really matter how I say it. They're gonna hear the word \"gay\" and go off.",
        "Layla: I'm sorry, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: Hey, you know, me, too. I got to get ready for work.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, yeah, me, too. I got to cover for my mom at the diner.",

        "John: I said get out of here!",
        "David: Watch the suit! It costs more than your salary. You shouldn't push me. My dad's your boss.",

        "Cole: Why am I even wearing a suit if we're just going to the police station?",
        "Starr: Because we're not sneaking around or, you know, pretending to be anything other than what we are, which is a family. And I want us to make an entrance.",

        "[Starr giggles]",
        "Langston: What do you think, Mom?",
        "Starr: See? Your daughter got all dressed up, too.",
        "Cole: Look at you. You are gorgeous. If I knew it was this important to you, I would've worn a tux. And I hate wearing a tux.",
        "Starr: You look great.",

        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Starr: He has no idea.",
        "Langston: Well, he doesn't need to know the whole truth yet. We'll be watching you on TV.",
        "Starr: Oh!",
        "Dorian: The media is certainly out in force. Does this have to do with the mayor?",
        "Bo: Oh, is that why you're here, Dorian? You want to put a little spin on your candidate's illegal activities?",
        "Dorian: No. I'm here to tell him that I am withdrawing my support.",
        "Bo: Good move.",
        "Dorian: So if this brouhaha is not about the mayor, then what is it about?",
        "Bo: Beats me. Unless maybe they heard that you're the one that blew Cole Thornhart's cover. No, I'm kidding. Just kidding. They're not here for you or the mayor. Nobody really gives a damn what that jerk has to say now. Unless, of course, he wants to announce his resignation. Hey, why don't I just take you down there, show you where we got him locked up.",
        "Dorian: Bo, my telling the mayor about Cole was a terrible mistake but an honest one. You know that, don't you? You're -- you're not gonna lock me up in a cell, too, are you?",
        "Bo: Don't tempt me.",

        "Jessica: The mayor's not resigning? Why not?",
        "Charlie: He says he's innocent until proven guilty.",
        "Brody: If he thinks he can beat the wrap, he's nuts.",
        "Jessica: No, no, he was on tape telling a cop to kill Cole. He's the reason that Shaun Evans is in a coma. He put every cop on the force in danger. I mean, Brody's lucky to be alive. He was dealing with drug dealers. They kidnapped Starr and Chloe. Hope. Hope. I meant to say Hope. That just slipped out. I'm -- I'm sorry.",

        "Viki: Of course you were. Darling, you love her. We all love her.",
        "Brody: When I was in the warehouse last night, all I could think about was you and how scared you'd be knowing the baby was in that kind of danger. No matter who her parents are now, I know you love her. I didn't care what happened. I just had to get her out of there. I had to do that for you.",

        "Newscaster: We bring you Commissioner Bo Buchanan, live from the Llanview Police Department.",
        "Bo: I want to thank you all for being here today. And as commissioner of the Llanview pd, I've got to tell you that I have never felt more pride in this department than I feel today. As you know, last night the Llanview pd made a sizable drug bust. Now, we had a special task force working on this case.",
        "Reporter: Commissioner, can you talk about the mayor's involvement in all this?",
        "Bo: No, no. I'm sorry because we're still putting all of that together.",
        "Reporter: What about the man who was seriously injured?",
        "Bo: Yes. That man was a security guard who put his life on the line, and now he's on life support. And I'd like to take a moment for us all to send our thoughts and prayers to him and his family. Today we're here to pay tribute to the heroic efforts of the people that worked on this case. But, first, I'd like to acknowledge some heroic women who helped get Cole Thornhart, Officer Oliver Fish, and Detective John McBain here today. Now, these are very stubborn men. Now, they would rather barge right into a warehouse full of armed criminals than to be part of a ceremony that is held in their honor. So that's why -- that's why I had to get some expert help to get them here today. Now, one of my men, Brody Lovett, is unable to be here. But I know that he is watching from his hospital bed where he is recuperating from injuries that he received at that warehouse. And, Brody, we wish, all of us, that you were here today. These men risked their lives to make Llanview a safer place for everyone and to put a corrupt mayor behind bars. Now, I know that these men don't expect any special thanks. But I'm asking them to accept as one more part of the job my gratitude and the appreciation of all the citizens in Llanview. Now, these men could've seen, and they very well could see, the danger involved in them going into that building. And they could've bailed out, but they didn't. Now, I've been told that courage tastes of blood. But these men, these brave heroes, they never flinched. They never tried to get that taste out of their mouths. They went beyond the call of duty to save Starr and Hope Manning and to take Llanview back from drug pushers. Cole Thornhart, would you step up here, please?",

        "Bo: Yeah, but you got one anyway. Oh, come on, John. Get the hell out of here. Take the day off.",

I have an important announcement to make about Mayor Lowell. I am Dorian Lord, and as the mayor's campaign manager, I felt it was incumbent upon me to convince him that the reign of corruption had to end. Last night when the news came out, we were all terribly shocked. My own family was deeply traumatized. So I convinced the mayor that he had to protect his son from any further embarrassment or hurt and that most of all, all of Llanview had to begin to heal. Luckily, he listened to me. So, effective immediately, I have Mayor Lowell's letter of resignation.",

Did you ever watch \"The Osbournes\"? That was good. Roxy's even better. You know what she did? She kidnapped my cousin Natalie Buchanan at birth, raised her in a trailer park.",
        "Roxy: Hey, be kind, Vickers.",

        "David: The contract says that you produce a reality show starring me. You signed it.",
        "Ford: Yeah, I know. We both did. But I guess only one of us reads the fine print. The contract also obligates me to produce a show about a man named David Vickers. You're not the only David Vickers in the world.",
