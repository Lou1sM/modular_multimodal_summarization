        "Cole: What are you going -- what are you going to do now, huh?",

        "Marcie: Was -- was that Tommy?",
        "Michael: Oh, he's sleeping, sweetie.",
        "Marcie: No, I know, but he's usually up by now.",
        "Michael: Yeah, but he had a big day yesterday.",
        "Marcie: I know, but still I'd better go check on him.",
        "Michael: Honey, the baby monitor is right next to the crib. If he was waking up, we would hear it.",
        "Marcie: Ok. We can't let Todd take him away. Michael, we just -- we can't, ok? I --",
        "Michael: I know. I know. But what we got to do right now is we got to try and have some faith in Rex, you know? Because if we can prove that Todd is an unfit parent --",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Marcie: Oh, good, Rex. You better have something, and it better be good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You're back early. I thought you were going to stay in New York for a couple weeks.",
        "Talia: I was, but I -- I -- I needed to come home. I went by the station to check in, and to say thank you for giving me the time off, but you were out.",
        "Bo: Rough being back there, huh?",
        "Talia: A lot rougher than I expected.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: This feels great.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, they say it's the best thing after a workout.",
        "Cristian: A good sweat after a good sweat.",
        "Antonio: Exactly.",
        "Cristian: You know, they say steam helps heal scars.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, they also say some scars never disappear.",

        "Nash: Oh, no, I was going to bring you breakfast in bed.",
        "Jessica: Mushrooms and cheddar?",
        "Nash: Just the way you like it.",
        "Jessica: Awesome.",
        "Nash: Oh -- well, I figured it was the least I could do. You pulled quite a stint --",
        "Jessica: Hmm.",
        "Nash: With Bree last night. What time did you finally get to sleep?",
        "Jessica: Ah, she conked out at about 3:00.",
        "Nash: Ooh. Well, with any luck, she'll sleep in this morning.",
        "Jessica: Oh, I hope so. So what have you got planned for tonight?",
        "Nash: Well, I thought I'd go to the gym, pretend to work out, go for a very long steam in a room full of half-naked boys. Then I'd go to the greenhouse, check on the plants, make some calls.",
        "Jessica: Are you going to see Jared Banks at all today?",
        "Nash: I don't know. I hadn't planned on it. Why?",
        "Jessica: Because we need to talk about him.",
        "Jared: Good morning, Sparky. Did you sleep well? Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You always do that.",
        "Markko: No, I did it once.",
        "Langston: Once? You interrupt me, like, 10 times a minute.",
        "Markko: Because you keep saying the same thing over and over.",
        "Langston: I happen to care about this a lot.",
        "Markko: And I don't?",
        "Langston: Starr's my best friend. This is going to \u0096",
        "Both: Change her life.",
        "Langston: You need to stop doing that.",
        "Markko: All right, look, I'm sorry. I feel for Starr. But what about Mrs. McBain? I mean, that kid might be Starr's brother, but --",
        "Langston: Mrs. McBain is Tommy's mom, I know.",
        "Markko: It's really sad, whatever happens.",
        "Langston: Yeah. So, why'd you drag me in here, anyway?",
        "Markko: Why do you ask so many questions?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Oh, God, no, don't tell me I -- I didn't. I didn't.",
        "Jared: Well, I got the whole thing on video if you want to see it. Or we could just rerun the action live.",
        "Natalie: Ok -- get away from me.",
        "Jared: Oh, God, you're a little cranky this morning. You were a hell of a lot friendlier last night.",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Natalie: Don't you dare say that to me.",
        "Jared: Yeah, well, not saying it doesn't make it not true.",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Natalie: Are -- are you trying to tell me that we --",
        "Jared: Go on.",
        "Natalie: We --",
        "Jared: \"We\" what?",
        "Natalie: No, no. This is not possible.",
        "Jared: Yeah, well, you're waking up in my bed, aren't you?",
        "Natalie: Ok, so what. That doesn't -- that doesn't mean anything. Because I was in bed with you, it doesn't mean anything.",
        "Jared: Really? Then everything I've learned in my life is a lie.",
        "Natalie: But I wouldn't, I couldn't -- and I didn't do anything with you. Did I?",
        "Jared: Would you like me to describe your hidden birthmark?",
        "Natalie: I don't have a hidden birthmark.",
        "Jared: No, you do. But considering where it is, you've probably never seen it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You're right. We do need to talk about Mr. Jared Banks.",
        "Jessica: Do you really trust him?",
        "[Nash groans]",
        "Nash: Well, I don't think he cheated in the poker game, if that's what you mean. But I do think that he is an opportunist and a very smooth talker. Definitely.",
        "Jessica: Well, is that the kind of person you want to be in business with?",
        "Nash: Actually, it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Court's going to be in session in an hour, man. We don't have a lot of time.",
        "Rex: Cut me some slack, will you? I've been up all night pulling this stuff together.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, I just talked to our lawyer. She's on her way. So what do you got here?",
        "Marcie: Wow, what is all this?",
        "Rex: Well, you wanted me to find everything I could to make Todd look like an unfit father, right?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Rex: Well, by the time your lawyer gets done presenting this to the judge, he'll rule that Tommy would be better off with Jack the ripper than with Todd.",
        "Marcie: No, no, please, Rex -- please, do not joke. Right now, I can't handle that.",
        "Rex: No, I'm not trying to be funny. I'm just saying that there's enough right here to make Todd look like a monster.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, it's good to see you, but shouldn't you be in school?",
        "Blair: She has a little bit more time before homeroom.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I -- I just wanted to see you.",
        "Todd: But I have to be at court soon, though.",
        "Blair: She knows, Todd. She knows everything.",
        "Starr: Well, about the baby. Your baby. I -- I can't believe it. I can't believe that he's alive. I -- I can't believe who he turned out to be.",
        "Todd: And do you think he should be with the McBains?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So you're just not going to answer my question?",
        "Markko: I forgot the question.",
        "Langston: Why are we here, Markko?",
        "Markko: Why do you think?",
        "Langston: Oh, this is seriously annoying.",
        "Markko: And so is the question.",
        "Langston: It was a perfectly normal question.",
        "Markko: Not when you know the answer.",
        "Langston: Why would I know the answer?",
        "Markko: Ugh. Ok, I guess if we keep fighting, we're not going to have any time left before class.",
        "Langston: Time for what?",
        "Markko: For this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Back in New York -- I can't imagine what that was like for you.",
        "Talia: New York's such a great city. It's just so full of life and energy.",
        "Bo: I know you had to give testimony, but what else did you do? Did you -- did you see friends?",
        "Talia: Yeah, I did. I went by my old precinct. Saw some coworkers who were still there. And the wall of pictures of the friends we lost.",
        "Bo: Well, when that happened, I read the papers every day, and every day, there were stories in there about the people that -- that were victims of the attack. And how they lived their lives, and -- I tried to read all of them that I could. Out of respect.",
        "Talia: I did that, too. You know, the day after I visited my old precinct, I went down to ground zero for the annual reading of names. Hard to imagine anything ever being there. You know? Let alone what happened. Sir, I kept -- I kept having these flashes of memories. They kept coming into my head. Like the fire. The -- the second plane hitting. People jumping. And then the buildings coming down -- I -- huh -- it was so surreal. It was almost as if I --",
        "Talia: Those towers, sir -- it's like they were touching heaven.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You're right. Some things do stay with you forever. Even so, as soon as you stop looking back, it does get easier.",
        "Antonio: You're doing a good job.",
        "Cristian: Let me guess. You're talking about Capricorn, right?",
        "Antonio: I couldn't have hired a better manager.",
        "Cristian: Huh. Don't you mean you couldn't have hired a better manager who's also your brother?",
        "Antonio: Hmm -- yeah, I guess that narrows the field a bit, doesn't it?",
        "Cristian: Well, hey, I hope that means I'm getting a raise.",
        "Antonio: Well, stranger things have happened.",
        "Cristian: Well, to tell you the truth, I'm going to need a raise if you start taking the cost of broken glasses and returned drinks out of my paycheck.",
        "Antonio: You're talking about Sarah Roberts.",
        "Cristian: Anyone complain?",
        "Antonio: Well, let's just say I'm going to have to put in a dry-cleaning allowance into the budget.",
        "Cristian: She's trying, Antonio, and she really needs this job.",
        "Antonio: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: And she's not a bad kid. She's just a little headstrong.",
        "Antonio: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: And stubborn.",
        "Antonio: And you're forgetting clumsy.",
        "Cristian: Right. You're not thinking of firing her, are you?",
        "Antonio: No, no, not me. That's what I hired you for, man. You're the manager. It's your call.",
        "Cristian: Good. Thanks.",
        "Antonio: Sure. How's Evangeline?",
        "Cristian: The same.",
        "Antonio: Nothing -- nothing new?",
        "Cristian: No. I mean, Layla sees her just about every day. She keeps me filled in.",
        "Antonio: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cristian: You know, I really don't feel like talking about it.",
        "Antonio: No, I -- I understand. I -- I have some good news, though.",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah? I could use some.",
        "Antonio: I sold my -- my share of Nash's vineyard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I just don't understand why you'd want to go into business with somebody that you can't trust.",
        "Nash: Did I say I couldn't trust him? I don't think I said I couldn't trust him.",
        "Jessica: Well, you haven't said anything positive about him.",
        "Nash: Ok. He's smart, and resourceful.",
        "Jessica: Resourceful?",
        "Nash: Resourceful.",
        "Jessica: Resourceful, as in he lied to my sister and faked a resume to get a job?",
        "Nash: Smart, resourceful, and ambitious.",
        "Jessica: Why are you defending him?",
        "Nash: I want to know why you're attacking him.",
        "Jessica: I just don't want you to go into business with somebody who you can't trust to watch your back. And maybe there are things that you don't know about him.",
        "Nash: Like what?",
        "Jessica: Like why is he in Llanview?",
        "Nash: Well, as far as I know, he came here because he wanted a job at Buchanan Enterprises.",
        "Jessica: And he didn't get that, thanks to my sister.",
        "Nash: Right. And then he fell into a poker game and won some money.",
        "Jessica: Your money.",
        "Nash: Thank you. Yeah, his money now.",
        "Jessica: Ok, well, he used that money to become your partner.",
        "Nash: He did. Jessica, I appreciate you looking out for me and worrying. I do. But it's not like I picked this guy out. Antonio sold him 51% of my business, and the last time I did the math, that means that he's got the controlling share. And since he is my partner, I'm making the best of it. All right? The last thing I want to do is piss him off.",
        "Jessica: Why do you care?",
        "Nash: Because if I piss him off, he can sell the controlling share to anybody. And you know what that say. The devil you know --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, are you -- are you telling me --",
        "Jared: No, I'm not telling you anything. Because I don't know anything. Maybe you got a birthmark. Maybe you don't.",
        "Natalie: Are you -- are you saying --",
        "Jared: Nothing happened.",
        "Natalie: How do I know that you're telling me the truth?",
        "Jared: Did you wake up with a smile on your face?",
        "Natalie: No. With a headache.",
        "Jared: Well, there you have it.",
        "Natalie: Did we, or did we not have sex last night?",
        "Jared: Not.",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "Jared: Oh, but we did get pretty hammered, though, because as you can see, we tore up the room.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God -- what was I thinking? Why would I do something so stupid? With you!",
        "Jared: Oh. No offense taken. But as I recall, through the inebriated haze, you were upset about some ex-boyfriend kissing with some --",
        "Natalie: Oh, God.",
        "Jared: Woman you can't stand.",
        "Natalie: Oh, now it's starting to come back to me. Oh -- oh, my poor head. Ugh.",
        "Jared: I'll get you an aspirin. You want two or three?",
        "Natalie: Two or three what?",
        "Jared: Aspirin.",
        "Natalie: Oh -- uh -- I don't care. Just hurry.",
        "Natalie: Whew.",
        "Jared: Here's your aspirin. I only had two left, sorry. What you need is a hair of the dog. But we killed that bottle last night.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. I'm never drinking again. Could you please put some clothes on? You're not impressing anyone.",
        "Jared: No? It means you still won't hire me? I mean, considering that we broke the ice and slept together last night.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- I don't think so. And all that happened is that you got naked and got into bed with me.",
        "Jared: Ah.",
        "Natalie: That's all we did -- sleep.",
        "Jared: Hey, Sparky -- you party like a rock star.",
        "Natalie: You ain't seen nothing yet. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Is this stuff all true?",
        "Rex: Every bit of it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Marcie: Ms. Brown, come on in.",
        "Judy: We've got to be in court in an hour.",
        "Marcie: I -- I know, but Rex just came over with a stack of evidence against Todd.",
        "Michael: Judy, Rex Balsom. Rex, this is Judy Schulman Brown. She's our attorney.",
        "Rex: Nice to meet you.",
        "Judy: I've been going over court transcripts from Todd Manning's trials, researching some of the custody disputes for precedents. I've already come up with a lot of material, but I'd like to see what you've got.",
        "Marcie: Ok. Can I get you a cup of coffee, or --",
        "Judy: Please -- cream, no sugar.",
        "Michael: You know what? I'll -- I'll get the coffee, ok?",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Rex?",
        "Rex: No, thanks, I've already six espressos.",
        "Marcie: Um -- look, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you for everything you've done for us. I really do appreciate it.",
        "Rex: Yeah. I don't want you to lose Tommy, but --",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Rex: Some of this stuff is pretty damning. And like I said last night, if the judge rules Todd to be an unfit father --",
        "Marcie: Yeah, then we get to keep Tommy.",
        "Rex: And Todd might lose custody of Starr and jack.",
        "Marcie: I know. Rex, I do know that. And I know how hard it's going to be on those kids, I do, and I wish that it were different. But you know what? They're going to have their mother and they're going to have each other, so my only concern right now is our little boy, ok? That is all that matters to me right now. That Michael and I -- we keep Tommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Honey, I know that Mrs. McBain is your favorite teacher.",
        "Starr: Yeah, she is. I love Mrs. McBain. I love Tommy. I -- I was his babysitter.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but you're not just his babysitter anymore, are you? You're his sister.",
        "Starr: I know that I'm his sister, dad. That's what I was trying to say. I feel bad that Mrs. McBain has to lose Tommy, has to lose her son, but -- but that's just it. As bad as I feel for Mrs. McBain, he's not her son, he's yours, and you're my dad, and I am going to stand by you, always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Whoa, hey! Why don't you guys get a room, huh?",
        "[Cole chuckles]",
        "Langston: What are you doing in here?",
        "Cole: I was just shooting some hoops before class.",
        "Langston: Did you talk to Starr this morning?",
        "Cole: Yeah, she -- she's heading down to the custody hearing today.",
        "Langston: This whole thing is so sad -- I mean, not even for Starr's dad, but Mrs. McBain and little Tommy?",
        "Cole: I know, and to make it worse for Starr, she's actually kind of cool with Mrs. McBain.",
        "Langston: I know. I mean, how could she be happy having a little brother knowing Mrs. McBain is that kid's mom?",
        "Cole: Yeah, I just hope she doesn't get caught in the middle of the fight between Mrs. McBain and her dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, we should get going. We can drop you off at school on our way to the courthouse. What do you say?",
        "Todd: You're still coming?",
        "Blair: Of course I am.",
        "Starr: And I'm going to go, too.",
        "Blair: No, sweetie. It's your second day of school. I don't want you behind.",

        "Blair: Starr --",
        "Starr: Langston said that she will take notes for me and I can copy them later. I need to be there with Dad. Please.",
        "Blair: Come on.",
        "Todd: I'd like her to be there, actually.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",

        "Todd: Ahem.",
        "Starr: Good. Thank you.",
        "Blair: Well, listen, um, I want to talk to your dad a minute, all right? Do you mind?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I'll -- I'll just wait downstairs.",

        "Blair: I just wanted to say something. I really hope that you will try to control yourself, please, Todd, in front of the judge today, please.",
        "Todd: That's asking a lot.",
        "Blair: Just do it for your children. Do it for all of them.",

        "Judy: I don't see a date on this one.",
        "Rex: Oh, I had to make a copy of it. The date was on the back. Turn it over, I wrote it down.",
        "Judy: \"July 16, 1998.\"",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, our -- our lawyer is here right now and we're working on a few strategies. No. No, definitely. I mean, the DNA is going to prove that Tommy is Todd's son -- biological son. You know, but -- but we're -- we're working on a few things and we might be able to delay or even possibly prevent Todd from getting custody. No. No, thanks, I -- no, I appreciate it, but there's actually something more important that I need you to do. Could you watch Tommy while we're in court? Well, because if he's with you, nobody can get to him. We know he's safe that way. Yeah. Yeah. I'll -- I'll drop him off in 10 minutes, ok? Don't worry -- we'll include the instruction manual. John? Thanks. Listen, we should probably get a move on.",
        "Judy: You're right.",
        "Michael: Do you think that any of this stuff here -- do you think it's going to help?",
        "Judy: Huh. I think it's going to cut Todd Manning off at the knees.",
        "Marcie: Miss Brown, may I ask you a question? Um -- if Todd Manning is declared an unfit parent, could the court order him to stay away from his other kids?",
        "Judy: It's definitely a possibility.",
        "Marcie: Oh, God.",

        "Bo: You know, when I -- when I got back from Vietnam, I had some good friends that didn't make it back. I used to wonder, why them, not me. I think we all tend to do that -- it's survivor guilt.",
