        "Judy: With the McBains.",
        "Judge: What are the grounds, Ms. Schulman Brown?",

        "Jessica: You don't know what I want.",
        "Jared: Well, it's good to see marriage and motherhood hasn't completely domesticated you. I was beginning to think there wasn't anything left of the girl I knew.",

        "Roxy: You better believe I am. But it's part of my major campaign here. Ok, the first thing is, I got to let everybody know that Lindsay was railroaded. Second of all, you know, I got to, you know, drum up a lot of support for Marcie and Michael. So how many can I count you in for?",

        "Judy: Or you'll what, Mr. Manning? Strangle them? Shoot them? Those are the things you tried to do to Tommy McBain. This is the animal petitioning for parental rights over a Toddler, your honor. Ruling in his favor is like giving that baby a death sentence.",

        "Roxy: So what are you doing here? Come for a his and her wax or something?",
        "Adriana: Oh --",

        "Natalie: Is that how you knew about the tequila?",

        "Natalie: You -- no, you don't have to baby-sit me. I'm sure you have much better things to do.",
        "Nash: Actually, I don't. Bree's over with your dad. Everything's fine at the vineyard. Figure I'll take this opportunity to score some points with the sister-in-law who hates me.",

        "Marty: Yeah. It's amazing how much of a mess one little person can make.",
        "John: Are you kidding me? The kid never stops.",
        "Marty: Yeah, Cole was like that. He was into everything. You know, Patrick wanted to get him one of those kid harnesses, but that's where I drew the line.",
        "John: Right. GPS, maybe. Uh -- I kind of draw the line at the leash.",
        "Marty: So, trying to have breakfast?",

        "[Tommy fusses]",
        "John: It wasn't -- it wasn't going too well, you know? Every time I -- I offered him the spoon -- I know, buddy. Every time I offered him the spoon, you know, he -- he either turned his head or he threw it at me.",
        "Marty: Well, he must be almost 2. You know, you can actually try letting him feed himself.",
        "John: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Marty: No, no. Just load up the spoon and, you know, let him have at it. Or you can just put some dry cereal in a bowl and see what happens.",
        "John: Now you tell me. All right, well, I'll keep that in mind. Maybe -- maybe you'll let me try that, t?",
        "Marty: Hey. Well -- um -- I'll let you have this time with -- with Tommy.",

        "Lawyer: Your honor, my client has apologized for his conduct. But we were blindsided by this unfair and spurious attack on his character.",
        "Judy: These charges aren't spurious, your honor, they're documented facts.",
        "Todd: How is that -- how could I have tried to kill him? I have never been alone with him.",
        "Judge: Mr. Manning, I'm warning you. One more outburst like that, and you'll be hearing my decision from inside of a jail cell.",
        "Lawyer: What my client says is correct. How can counsel possibly back these charges up?",
        "Judge: Ms. Schulman Brown?",
        "Judy: With a lot of good old-fashioned sworn testimony. If I may, I'd like to read it into the record.",

        "Dorian: You're pregnant, Adriana?",
        "Roxy: Isn't that great?",
        "Dorian: \"Great\"? My daughter's life is ruined.",
        "Roxy: Why?",
        "Rex: Ladies, nobody's pregnant.",

        "Dorian: Then why did you say you were?",
        "Adriana: I said I had news.",

        "Dorian: Oh, give us all a break.",
        "Adriana: Ok, ok. We are happy, and we do have news, but were so not having a baby.",
        "Roxy: Oh.",
        "Dorian: Thank heaven. Huh.",
        "Adriana: What's going on with your hair, Mom?",
        "Dorian: Oh, I went to my stylist for a trim, and he cut it too short, and I just hated it. So I remembered that she said she'd give me a makeover, and she said --",
        "Adriana: Ok, we got it, we got it! Yep, yep. Yep. Ok, thank you. Look, we were going to come to you next --",
        "Rex: So you might as well hear it at the same time.",
        "Adriana: We're moving in together.",
        "Roxy: Oh, that's beautiful.",
        "Adriana: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Rex: Come on. It beats being pregnant, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You still haven't told me why you tied one on last night.",
        "Natalie: Who needs a reason?",
        "Nash: You do. You're a Buchanan. I've been around Buchanans for a while. And except for Tess, who was kind of rebelling against Buchanans, I've never seen a Buchanan drink too much. And besides, you're usually pretty quick to say exactly what's on your mind, and here you are l curled up, hung-over, and not saying a thing -- clammed up. Something pretty crappy must have happened to you. All right. Bye. Ahem.",
        "Natalie: I walked in on John and Marty kissing last night. My ex-boyfriend was kissing another woman. And all I wanted to do was blot that picture out of my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm not using my sister as bargaining chip.",
        "Jared: I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. This is a good deal.",
        "Jessica: I don't want to make deals with you. It's bad enough that you're Nash's business partner.",
        "Jared: And I've kept my mouth shut there, haven't I?",
        "Jessica: Keep it that way.",
        "Jared: Oh -- no.",
        "Jessica: Hey, what do you think you're doing?",
        "Jared: I'm showing you who has the upper hand here. If it weren't for me, your current husband would still be in business with your ex-husband. I came to his rescue, and you treat me like the help.",
        "Jessica: Look, my husband, my daughter, and most of my family have been dealing with the fallout from my crazy past. And as soon as I think I have shut the door on everything, you showed up.",
        "Jared: And I kept my mouth shut. Now I need a favor from you.",
        "Jessica: \"What\"? What do you want?",
        "Jared: The job that Natalie turned me down for. I want it.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Well, you're out of luck.",
        "Jared: I -- I don't think so. Now you're on my side, and, well, we both know how persuasive you can be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: Your honor, nothing trumps the fact that Mr. Manning is this boy's biological father. He never signed away his rights as father because he wanted to find and raise his son. Now, this nullifies the McBains' adoption of the child they call Tommy.",
        "Judge: What do you have to say to that, Ms. Schulman Brown?",
        "Judy: Biology is one thing, the child's welfare is another. As I know your honor is aware, when a child is too young to speak on his own behalf, the standard to be applied is, what is in the best interests of t child. The guardians to whom Tommy McBain is appointed must be proven fit. It is incumbent upon the court to review any evidence that calls into question a potential parent's suitability.",
        "Starr: What is she talking about?",
        "Blair: I don't know, sweetie.",
        "Judge: I'll let you make your case, but I don't have any patience for theatrics.",
        "Judy: I'll let the facts speak for themselves. This is a sworn deposition given by Dr. Spencer Truman regarding his treatment of patient Todd Manning for a ab wound he received in August of 2005.",
        "Lawyer: Objection.",
        "Judge: State your grounds.",
        "Lawyer: This is a clear breach of doctor/patient confidentiality.",
        "Judy: Your honor, the statement is a matter of public record in another trial. Surely it's admissible.",
        "Judge: Go ahead.",
        "Todd: You cannot let her talk about this.",
        "Lawyer: I don't have a choice. I've been overruled.",
        "Judy: In this statement, Mr. Manning confessed to Dr. Truman that he had been stabbed by a woman named Margaret Cochran. At the time, Ms. Cochran was pregnant by Mr. Manning and was defending herself. Upon learning that she was pregnant, Mr. Manning tried to strangle her to death.",
        "Lawyer: Objection. Dr. Truman is dead, which means there is no possibility for a cross-examination. And these are the ravings of a man who was ready to let Todd Manning be executed for Ms. Cochran's murder when he knew for a fact Ms. Cochran was still alive.",
        "Judge: You better have something better than this, counselor.",
        "Judy: Of course, your honor, and I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Can't you be happy for us, just this once?",
        "Dorian: I am happy. I'm happy that you're happy.",
        "Rex: That was good.",
        "Adriana: I'm hearing a \"but.\"",
        "Dorian: I'm just disappointed.",
        "Adriana: Oh, Mom --",
        "Dorian: But why did you feel you had to practice telling the news in front of Roxy before you told me? But never mind. I'll forget about that.",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Dorian: I'm happy for you, both.",
        "Adriana: We only were going to tell Roxy first because we knew that she'd be all for the idea.",
        "Dorian: Why do you think I'm so difficult to please?",
        "Adriana: I know you've been trying very hard for the past year.",
        "Roxy: Clint Buchanan -- oh, he can really make a woman mellow. I'll bet he can. Sorry.",
        "Adriana: But you did do everything you could to try to break me and Rex up.",
        "Dorian: I paid the price. I mean, it nearly destroyed our relationship. You wouldn't speak to me. Goodness, you think I'd risk that happening again?",
        "Rex: Why not? You hired a guy to stalk Adriana and tried to convince her it was me.",
        "Dorian: Rex, if you're going to dwell in the past --",
        "Rex: I -- no, I'm just trying to explain why we have of a wait-and-see attitude about you.",
        "Dorian: Well, I hope you are going to see -- ahem -- that I'm worthy of your trust.",
        "Rex: I'll come over for dinner some night. I'll make Roxy's meatloaf.",
        "Dorian: I can do better than that. Right now, you'll see. Hmm.",

        "John: He's out cold.",
        "Marty: Well, you know, once you get their tummies full, it's a lot easier to get them to sleep.",
        "John: Ok, I'll try to remember that.",
        "Marty: You're really good with him.",
        "John: Hmm. You cleaned up.",
        "Marty: Oh, yeah. You know, in my DNA -- I can't help myself.",
        "John: Right. So you want to tell me why you came by?",
        "Marty: Right -- um -- I don't think so. Yeah.",
        "John: Marty?",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: Look, it was -- it was just a stupid idea, ok? Just a really stupid idea.",
        "John: What?",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "John: It's paper.",
        "Marty: See? I told you it was a stupid idea.",
        "John: Oh, no, this is your -- this is your top-flight stuff, and everybody needs paper, right?",

        "John: I'm not saying anything. I'm --",
        "Marty: No, you made that paper airplane for me out of my marriage certificate, and when I saw it just, you know, fly out over the water, I felt all the stupid feelings I had about marrying miles just, you know, fly away with it, and I know how much you love your father, and you said that he was the one who taught you how to make the paper airplanes, so I thought that maybe, you know, I could get you this and you could show Tommy what your father showed you, and -- oh, this was a stupid idea.",
        "[Marty chuckles]",
        "John: Wait.",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad? Dad? Hey. Don't let that lawyer get to you.",
        "Todd: Threw me a little curve, but I'm ok.",
        "Judge: All right, let's get on with this.",
        "Judy: Todd Manning hated his child's mother, a very unstable woman. Our point is that he lost control and could have killed her on three separate occasions, in spite of the fact that she was pregnant with his child.",
        "Lawyer: Objection. This is irrelevant.",
        "Judge: Overruled. Connect the dots, counselor, and do it quickly.",
        "Judy: I'd like to read a section from the transcript. This is the defense during cross-examination. \"Why did you go down to the lake that night, Mr. Manning?\" \"I was going to kill her.\" By his own admission, under oath, he went to Llantano Lake to kill a woman who was obviously pregnant with his child. He could not separate the mother from the child. He could not spare the mother in order to protect the child.",
        "Lawyer: Objection. Ms. Cochran died in an automobile accident. My client did not kill her.",
        "Judge: Make your point.",
        "Judy: Tommy is not the child of a loving relationship. Mr. Manning proved three times that he had no self-control when it came to his child's mother. What if Mr. Manning is awarded custody and he finds that he can't look at his son without seeing Ms. Cochran and the things that she did? What if Tommy begins to remind him of Ms. Cochran? What if Tommy has a bad reaction to being taken away from Dr. And Mrs. McBain? What if he acts out or misbehaves? Will Mr. Manning lose control again and forget he's dealing with a child? Why take that chance? Leave Tommy with Michael and Marcie McBain. They are loving parents, and the only ones Tommy's ever known. Don't give him to the man who didn't care if he died. With real fruit and no preservatives, graduates",
        "Judy: We would also like to request psychiatric evaluations r the two other children in Mr. Manning's custody --",
        "Blair: Ok --",
        "Judy: Starr and Jack Manning.",
        "Blair: All right, that's it. You know, there is nothing wrong --",
        "Judge: Silence.",
        "Blair: With Jack and Starr!",
        "Judge: Sit down.",
        "Blair: There's nothing wrong with them!",
        "Judge: Sit down!",
        "Blair: Uh --",
        "Judge: I'm going to call a recess, and I strongly suggest everyone in this room use that time to collect themselves. The bailiff will stay here to keep order.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Judy: I'd say it's a whole new ballgame.",
        "Marcie: Judy, look, um -- can we afford to back off right now, because, uh --",
        "Judy: Not if we want to win. Morgan is right \u0096 Todd's rights as a father are undeniable. The only chance we have is to crucify him.",

        "Todd: What?",
        "Starr: I can show that judge what kind of father you really are.",

        "Starr: I think I can take care of myself, dad.",
        "Todd: Honey? You know that I haven't exactly led an exemplary life, and they're going to force all that out of you and make you admit it all happened.",
        "Starr: Even when all of it did, we got through it. No matter how furious I was, I never doubted for one minute that you loved me or that I loved you. Isn't that being a good father?",

        "Michael: You're right. You are right, ok? Look -- at the lives, look at the lives that Starr and Jack have had to lead because they have lived with Todd Manning. All we're doing here is protecting our son. There's nothing wrong with that.",

        "Rex: To Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Uh-uh. No -- to Rex and to Adriana.",

        "Nash: You're tough.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. And you don't like that, right?",

        "Jessica: Why do you even want the job at B.E.? You already own half a vineyard.",
        "Jared: You've heard my terms. Now all you got to do is come through. And if you need any motivation, take a good look at that handsome husband of yours and that beautiful little child, because you stand to lose them. Nash: Ha-ha!",

        "Morgan: Yeah, but your son wasn't. He was an innocent victim -- your victim.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, I'm still his father. They're nothing.",

        "Starr: Yeah, and then the McBains' lawyer came in with information on Margaret and my dad. She made it seem like my dad was the psycho and Margaret was the victim. Oh, yeah -- and then, she said that my dad was trying to kill the baby when really, he was just trying to protect himself.",

        "Judge: Please take your seats. You, too, Ms. Schulman Brown. I spent this recess thinking about the argument I just heard, and I'm appalled by Mr. Manning's actions and am tempted to say Ms. Schulman Brown has made a prima facie case for awarding custody to the McBains. I'm only saying this because I want Mr. Manning and his counsel to understand how serious this situation is. I need to hear what possible explanation Mr. Manning has for his horrific actions.",
