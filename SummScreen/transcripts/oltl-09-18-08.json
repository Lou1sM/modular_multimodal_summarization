        "Cole: All right, Matthew, this is pretty much how it works. The preps sit here. We have your Goths and stoners over there. All right, then you got your skaters in the back there. Back on the bleachers are -- are the jocks. And then up front, band members and thespies.",
        "Matthew: Hey, I know those guys. Geeks?",
        "Cole: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, but they're cool. Who you really don't want to be seen with is this guy named Markko Rivera. Totally lame.",
        "Markko: Yeah, and you reek. Hey, what's up, Matt?",
        "Matthew: Hey, I'm good.",
        "Markko: Oh, good, better than I was first day of freshman year. You guys know where Langston is?",
        "Matthew: She's probably with Starr.",
        "Cole: Yeah -- no, I haven't seen them yet.",
        "Markko: Dr. Lord probably gave her a free pass today.",
        "Cole: What for?",
        "Markko: You didn't hear?",
        "Principal: Everyone, please take your seats. We're about to begin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Cole's in there with Markko and Matthew. It's now or never.",
        "Starr: Is it too late to say \"never\"?",
        "Langston: Walk behind me, and I'll run interference. Or we could just bail.",
        "Starr: I can't. If you can deal with your new family, then I can deal with, uh, old friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Okay, we're alone now. So why don't you cut the crap and tell me exactly what you think you can get out of me. And what you want from my daughter.",
        "Ray: Even in the slums of Bogot\u00e1, a hostess knows how to treat a guest.",
        "Dorian: Okay. Cut the crap, please. What are you after?",
        "Ray: Nothing more than getting to know my niece. Is that too much to ask?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gunfire sounds]",
        "Shane: Dad? Time to get up. We're really late.",
        "[Brody grunts]",
        "Gigi: Brody, get your hands off my kid! I mean right now!",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Rex: What do you want?",
        "Jared: Well, I just want to know one thing. Where are you stashing Natalie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: All right, then what, Tess? Let's say Jared accepts that I left him. What happens next? What happens if he stops looking for me?",
        "Tess: Well, then you get to watch him fall out of love with you and in love with me.",
        "[Natalie laughs]",
        "Natalie: You -- you really have lost it, because there ain't enough drugs on this planet to make him fall for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Principal: And in welcoming our new students to Llanview High, I strongly encourage all of you, especially our upper classmen --",
        "Cole: Dude, there's no way Langston's got an uncle.",
        "Markko: He showed up last night at Langston's party. She would've invited you but --",
        "Cole: It -- it's okay. Starr wouldn't have been cool with it anyway, but what's this uncle like?",
        "Markko: Don't know much, just that he's from Colombia, the country. And Langston's stoked, and Dr. Lord's tripping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm afraid I don't find your interest in my daughter as innocent as you seem to say it is.",
        "Ray: I don't see why. She's my niece. My only living blood relation. Surely, someone like you who is so close to her mujeres Cramer should understand that.",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes. A relationship that has persevered over decades. Can you say the same?",
        "Ray: No. No, I failed. I failed as a -- as a brother. I failed as an uncle. I -- I failed. But people change. Have you never had the occasion to beg forgiveness from a loved one?",
        "Dorian: How can Langston be a loved one? You only met the girl last night.",
        "Ray: There's plenty of time to change that.",
        "Dorian: Well, I'm sorry. But I cannot grant you the absolution that you seek.",
        "Ray: I'm not asking anything of you. What I want, I'll get from Langston.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Principal: I'm sure you all remember your first day of high school and how you looked up to the upper classmen.",
        "Langston: Starr, we can still hide out in the bathroom till all this is over.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I think -- I think you're right.",
        "Langston: Okay, let's go.",
        "Principal: Ladies? Please, sit down.",
        "[Whispers and murmurs]",
        "Principal: It is important to set a good example for our younger students and provide an excellent role model.",
        "Boy: Can whoever knocked up Starr Manning be my buddy?",

        "Roxy: Check it out.",
        "Charlie: Um, what's September 7?",
        "Roxy: The best holiday that they never bother to put on a calendar.",
        "Charlie: Arbor day?",
        "Roxy: No, silly. It's Grandparents day.",
        "Charlie: No kidding.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, Grandparents day. I never even knew it existed. I mean, I thought maybe it was a fake until I goo-gooed it, and I found out there's a holiday specifically for a broad like me, even though I'm a week late. Now, the only thing is, I got to make sure that my grandson knows all about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Get off of him! Get off of him!",
        "Shane: Mom, it's okay.",
        "Gigi: It's not okay! What the hell were you doing?",
        "Shane: Mom, it's okay. We were just wrestling. Dad was showing me some moves.",
        "Brody: It won't happen again, Geege.",
        "Gigi: Go -- go get your backpack. It's -- it's time to go.",
        "Brody: Oh, I didn't realize how late it was. Just -- just give me a minute to throw some clothes on.",
        "Gigi: There's no time. We're running late already.",
        "Shane: But Dad and I talked about it -- I wanted him to take me to school today.",
        "Gigi: But I always take you on your first day.",
        "Shane: I really wanted Dad to take me. He never got to before. Please, Mom? You can pick me up.",
        "Gigi: Just this once.",
        "Shane: Thanks. I love you.",
        "Gigi: Make sure he gets to school on time and safely. And don't go introducing yourself as Shane's father because you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jared: She really isn't here?",
        "Rex: No! Well, I guess she finally learned.",
        "Jared: Learned what?",
        "Rex: Oh, you didn't find that out in all your Buchanan research? Natalie's like a jackass magnet. The day was bound to come when she woke up and realized she could do better. So wherever Nattie is, good for her. She finally dumped you and moved on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Laugh it up, Natalie. You're not going to think it's so funny when Jared gives up on you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, never going to happen. He loves me too much.",
        "Tess: Oh, well, does he love you like Seth, Cristian, and John? Come on, Natalie. There is life after you, and I'm going to help Jared see that.",
        "Natalie: Jared can't stand you. I mean, you set him up, sent him to prison. You have a better chance of getting a third personality than making him fall for you.",
        "Tess: Honey, honey, honey, you take everything so literally. Of course he doesn't like me. But he's going to fall head over heels for Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: No, listen to me. Natalie is gone, and I don't know where she is. I love her. I know you do, too. So I thought, maybe she was laying low here or she told you where she went.",
        "Rex: How do you know she went anywhere?",
        "Jared: Well, she -- she left this.",
        "Jared: I read it over and over. It doesn't make any sense.",
        "Rex: Well, pretty clear to me. Everything you and Nattie did came back to bite you in the ass. Nattie's a mess over it, so she bolted.",
        "Jared: But why now? Things were working out.",
        "Rex: Well, uh, maybe you thought that. Nattie obviously didn't think so.",
        "Jared: Since when does Natalie let a letter do the talking for her? To say goodbye without -- without calling you, your mom, Viki. Does that sound like your sister to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Hey, Natalie. Why aren't you laughing anymore?",
        "Natalie: Because it isn't funny.",
        "Tess: Well, I think it's a hoot. Jared's not going to know what hit him.",
        "Natalie: I don't get this. You can't even stand Jared. Have you thought this through?",
        "Tess: Well, I did make a list of pros and cons. You want to hear it? Okay. Pro -- I get to see the look on Jared's face when he realizes that you're not coming back. Con -- I have to suck it up and pretend that I like Jared. Pro -- I get to see the look on your face when you see me take Jared away from you. Con -- well, I didn't come up with any more cons.",
        "Natalie: You know what? It'll never fly, because Jared was suspicious of you before we even moved into Llanfair. He will figure this out.",
        "Tess: Yeah, but I -- I'm the pregnant widow, and he made me that way. So between his guilt and my loss, he's going to cut me tons of slack. If that doesn't seal the deal, there's always the pregmonster excuse.",
        "Natalie: He'll never go for it.",
        "Tess: Maybe not at first. Might take a little time. But I've got all the time in the world now to wield my magic, now that you're out of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: The only thing you'll get from Langston is a wave goodbye.",
        "Ray: You really love my niece, yes?",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "Ray: My sister, Linda, must have had a great deal of respect for you to trust you with the care of her daughter.",
        "Dorian: I never knew your sister, Linda.",
        "Ray: Then you will forgive me for asking you, how did Langston come to be with you?",
        "Dorian: Langston, uh, is the best friend of my grandniece, Starr. And I discovered that Langston had been living alone in her house, covering up the fact that her parents had been killed. She would have been shuttled off to foster homes if I had not stepped in.",
        "Ray: Incredible. How -- how generous of you, to give of yourself to a young girl you didn't really know, not of your blood. And this, with your own family to take care of.",
        "Dorian: Let's get something straight. Langston is family.",
        "Ray: Not in any way that counts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Shut it, dork.",
        "Boy: Oh, what's your problem, little orphan Lannie?",
        "Second Boy: You put out, too?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Langston: No, Markko!",
        "Principal: Hey, hey, hey! Rivera, Thornhart, in the hallway. Same with you two. Use the remainder of the period to get to know your buddies.",
        "[Matthew sighs]",
        "Matthew: Man, if this is what a high school assembly is like, I can't wait till lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Backpack, check. Lunch, check. Pens and pencils -- binder?",
        "Shane: Yes, Mom, yes.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Gigi: Hi.",
        "Marcie: Hey, I hope this isn't a bad time.",
        "Gigi: No, no, these guys are just about on their way out.",
        "Marcie: Oh, you excited to be going back to school, Shane?",
        "Shane: I guess.",
        "Marcie: Yeah? Well, I may be your sub someday. I just got a phone call from the school board. Uh, I can sub on a probationary basis, of course.",
        "Gigi: That's great, Marcie. That's really great.",
        "Brody: We better get a move on.",
        "Gigi: I love you. I love you, and have a great first day, and I love you.",
        "Shane: Mom, I have to go.",
        "Gigi: Okay. Oh, be sure to take his picture out in front of the school, okay? A couple of them.",
        "Shane: Come on, Dad.",
        "Marcie: Shane doesn't know, does he? That Rex is his dad.",
        "Gigi: At the rate I'm going, he never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Think about it, Rex. Natalie might take off on me, fine. But she would not worry the rest of you like this.",
        "Rex: Maybe she's taking some time off, like her mom did, for a personal makeover. While she's doing it, I hope she finds somebody better than you.",
        "Jared: Viki called home on a regular basis. So if we don't hear from Natalie in a couple days, you want to at least help me look into it?",
        "Rex: When she's ready to get in touch with us, she will. Until then, I would give her the space she's asking for in that letter.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Rex: Yeah?",
        "Adriana: Rex? It's me, Adriana.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Okay, let me get this straight. You told Rex that Shane is his, right?",
        "Gigi: Uh-huh.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm, and Rex told you that he loves you.",
        "Gigi: He did. After 10 years, he finally did.",
        "Marcie: Okay. So why in the hell is Brody still living here?",
        "Gigi: Well, you see --",
        "Marcie: Hmm?",
        "Gigi: When -- when I was away looking for Rex, Brody somehow fixed a D.N.A. test to prove to Shane that he really is his dad, so --",
        "Marcie: How did he do that?",
        "Gigi: I don't know.",
        "Marcie: Oh, what a mess. And I know from messes, trust me on that one.",
        "Gigi: How's the adoption coming?",
        "Marcie: Oh, I don't know. It's still on, I think. Stop changing the subject. What are you going to do?",
        "Gigi: I don't know.",
        "Marcie: Well, you know, the longer this goes on, Gigi --",
        "Gigi: The worse it will get, especially for Rex and Shane.",
        "Marcie: And for you.",
        "Gigi: I know that I need to tell Shane about Rex, and soon.",
        "Marcie: So then what is stopping you?",
        "Gigi: Well, I'm scared, Marcie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I got your message.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I left it a couple days ago.",
        "Adriana: I've been thinking a lot about us, where we go from here.",
        "Rex: Me, too.",
        "Adriana: And I think what's best for us is to go away together for a couple weeks. Not a honeymoon, just a trip away from everyone. We can even get separate rooms if you want. But we need to do this, Rex. We need to see if we can fix our problems.",
        "Rex: We can't fix them. I want a divorce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Good, I'm glad it's not frozen. Hey, Charlie? You going to help me celebrate Grandparents day? Even though you're not a gramps, but you almost were one when you were posing as Rex's daddy. Hey, Jared, why don't you help me and your old man celebrate Grandparents day?",
        "Charlie: You, uh -- everything all right, son?",
        "Jared: It's, uh, Natalie. She's left me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You can't stomach this, Tess. And not because you can't stand Jared, but because you'd be betraying Nash.",
        "Tess: Don't you even say his name to me, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: I might. The more you get closer to Jared, the more you think of Nash and how he'd hate what you're doing.",
        "Tess: Stop talking about it.",
        "Natalie: Just think, Tess. I mean, think of how you'd be dishonoring Nash's name and hurting his kid.",
        "Tess: Natalie, I am calling the shots here, so you shut the hell up.",
        "Natalie: Nash will be in your head, telling you how wrong this is, and the more you think of Nash, the more Jessica gets stronger.",
        "Tess: Shut up, Natalie! Shut up!",
        "Natalie: Then come in here and make me!",
        "Tess: God, don't you get it? If Jessica was going to come out, she would've come out already. She loved Nash, too. She wants me to do this, Natalie. If she was going to save you, she would've been here already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Cole and Markko were awesome. They totally had your backs.",
        "Langston: You've been here what, like an hour, and you already sound like them?",
        "Matthew: Man, I should've done something, too.",
        "Starr: No, you shouldn't have. It's your first day of school. You shouldn't be getting in trouble.",
        "Girl: Oh, Cole, it looks just like you!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Boy: Score!",
        "Matthew: Hey, man, you got a problem?",
        "Langston: Matthew, come here.",
        "Matthew: What? What?",
        "Starr: Matthew, stop.",
        "Matthew: No, this sucks. They don't know anything about you, and if they did, they wouldn't think it's so funny.",
        "Principal: I'll give you all a warning this time, but keep your noses clean. Your transcripts depend on it.",
        "Students: [Chanting] Baby, baby, baby, baby --",
        "Boy: Let's have another one, Starr.",
        "Girl: Oh, oh!",
        "Starr: Guys, I would stop that if I were you. Guys, stop!",
        "[Chanting stops]",
        "Starr: I'm Starr Manning, and I don't have a basketball underneath my shirt. And if you don't want to look like me, and if you have sex, use a condom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What counts, Senor Montez, is that I pledged my life to being Langston's mother. She's as much a Cramer as any of my girls.",
        "Ray: Perhaps. But she is also Montez, and by blood. I will always be most grateful that you took her in, you gave her shelter. But I am her only blood relation, and she is, after all, a minor.",
        "Dorian: Just say it. What do you want?",
        "Ray: It is time for me to take over the raising of my niece.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You've already lost Jared, Natalie. It's time to get real.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, that's really good coming from a fraction of Jessica's personality.",
        "Tess: Oh, I'm real, all right. You'll see. You actually -- you can watch the entire thing on your own reality TV station. Imagine it -- poor Jessica with no one to turn to but big, strong Jared. Can you see it? Jared walks in on Jessica on a few unguarded moments, she's vulnerable and lonely and he's feeling a bit jilted. It won't be long until he's saying, \"Natalie who?\" And you'll be nothing but a bad memory.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Take a look at me because this is exactly what you'll look like seven months after having sex without protection. Anybody want to make jokes or laugh anymore, huh? No? Wow, no more -- no more laughing, no more skits, no making fun of me? Come on, guys, I'm a whale. I have a watermelon on the vine. No one wants to laugh at that? I'm pregnant. No one wants to laugh at the pregnant girl? Does anybody want to come up here and rub my belly? Because I guarantee it will scare you. Okay? It's scary. You can all line up right here if you want to. I'm pregnant. I'm not some freak of nature. And I'm going to be around here for a while, so you're going to have to get used to it. And if you don't -- if you don't want to look like me, then I suggest you use some type of protection. Go out buy condoms, get on the pill -- something. I would tell you not to have sex, but then that -- you would never listen to me and that would be stupid.",
        "Principal: Ms. Manning, a word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Adriana? Adriana, are you still there?",
        "Adriana: I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Rex: It's the best thing.",
        "Adriana: For who? Not me.",
        "Rex: Look, Adriana --",
        "Adriana: You don't even want to try to save our marriage?",
        "Rex: We don't have a marriage. Okay, we never should have gone through with it. It was over as soon as you told me that you helped bring Brody to Llanview.",
        "Adriana: I shouldn't have done that, but you said you would give us another chance. I love you, Rex. Please say something. Tell me you love me, too.",
        "Rex: I'm sorry, I can't do that, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: Why, because of Gigi?",
        "Rex: No, because of you.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: Well, you obviously spent some time with Brody before he showed up in that wedding.",
        "Adriana: No, I just told him where Gigi and Shane were.",
        "Rex: Right, and he must have told you some things, too.",
        "Adriana: What do you mean?",
        "Rex: The lies are over, Adriana. Admit it. You knew Brody wasn't Shane's father and that I was. You've known for a long time, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: What are you afraid of?",
        "Gigi: Shane's going to hate me, but I'm ready for that. And for him to want to hold on to Brody and make Rex and me as villains in his new comic book. Oh, God. But what I'm most afraid of is -- is Shane just knowing that his mother has been lying to him all these years, keeping his real dad from him.",
        "Marcie: Yes, you should have known that Rex was going to walk back into your life 10 years after he took off without a word. Come on! What is wrong with you? Look, Shane might not understand at first, okay, but he will -- someday.",
        "Gigi: Do you really think he might?",
        "Marcie: Yes, he loves you. And he will accept Rex. It -- it's just going to take him some time. He wanted you two to get together, right?",
        "Gigi: Before St. Brody showed up.",
        "Marcie: You know what? You are looking at all the negatives,",
        "Gigi: There are positives?",
        "Marcie: Yes, there are. When was the last time you had a date?",
        "Gigi: Hmm, well, if you don't count drinks with Jared Banks --",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm. Had sex?",
        "Gigi: Sex? I remember sex -- sort of. It's back there with the scrunchy and N'sync.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Marcie: See? You've earned the fact that you're finally, after all these years, with a guy that you love. And he loves you back, right? Look, maybe you are scared. And you want to know something? That is okay, because you are not alone anymore. You've got Rex, the father of your son, and he will help you with Shane.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Marcie: Okay?",
        "Gigi: Now I know why you're my best friend.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Marcie: Aw. Uh, I better get home.",
        "Gigi: Well, thank you for stopping by.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, no problem. Bye, Brody.",
        "[Mouths words]",
        "Brody: So, hey, things went okay at school. Uh, check it out. This is me and Shane outside his school. He insisted I let him go in by himself.",
        "Gigi: I'll hear about it from Shane later.",
        "Brody: What's up? You -- you sound funny.",
        "Gigi: I'm going to go out for a bit. And while I'm gone, I want you to start packing your things and looking for a new place to live.",
        "Brody: Just like that?",
        "Gigi: Rex and I are going to pick Shane up from school today and I'm going to tell him the truth. Rex is his father and this lie will finally be over.",
        "Brody: No, uh-uh, wait. You should have heard Shane on the way to school today. All that kid could talk about was taking his parents to open house, meaning you and me, Gigi -- not Rex. We're who he wants his parents to be.",
        "Gigi: You're not his father.",
        "Brody: I never was, but you sure didn't have a problem passing me off as his dad when Balsom couldn't be bothered to be in the picture. I mean, now what? Now you're going to pull the rug out from under the kid so you can hook up with the guy who already ditched you and never looked back?",
        "Gigi: Okay, I don't need to discuss this with you. Shane is my child. I will make the decisions about him.",
        "Brody: So then what am I supposed to do when Shane comes to me and asks me why? What do I tell him, Geeg?",
        "Gigi: I'll take all the blame. And you can still be a part of his life. You just can't be his dad.",
        "Brody: Oh, yeah, and then we're just one big happy blended family? It doesn't work like that. You can't keep Balsom and then keep me hanging around to pick up the pieces.",
        "Gigi: I am trying to keep the door open here for you to still have a relationship with him.",
        "Brody: Oh, that's real generous.",
        "Gigi: Well, if it's not good enough for you, fine. I don't care. You don't have a say in this.",
        "Brody: You're making a big mistake.",
        "Gigi: I don't want to hear it, Brody.",
        "Brody: Wait -- Rex already left you once and then he left his wife right after they were married. What makes you think he's going to stick around this time?",
        "Gigi: Start packing! And by the time I get back, I want you gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, I realized I haven't seen Nattie. Maybe you should call Rex.",
        "Jared: And, uh, I just -- I just came from there and he doesn't know where she is, and he's buying what she said in that letter.",
        "Charlie: But you don't?",
        "Jared: I don't. I don't want to, you know, but everyone keeps saying the same thing, that we didn't have a chance. I don't know. Maybe -- maybe they're right and I should just let her go, you know?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, maybe, if you don't mind feeling like a fool for the rest of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared may want to help you as Jessica, but he's not some kind of robot that he just does what you command.",
        "Tess: True. But we both know how he likes projects, and I got a perfect one for him.",
        "Natalie: What are you talking about now?",
        "Tess: Well, I'm going to be due in a couple of months. And, you know, I -- without my baby's daddy, who's going to help me? What better way to pay me back than Jared being my birthing coach?",
        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Get out of my house.",
        "Ray: We don't have to make this difficult.",
        "Dorian: You ain't seen difficult yet!",
        "Ray: I don't want to fight with you, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: No, you want to extort money from me, and I'm not going to waste another second waiting for you to name your figure. You're not getting a dime from me!",
        "Ray: All I want is my niece.",
        "Dorian: You're not getting her, either!",
        "Ray: We'll see what the man in the robe has to say about that. I am familiar with the laws of this country. There is not judge in America who will deny me my day in court -- not when I am Langston's only living blood relation.",
        "Dorian: You may know the law, but you don't know me. And trust me on this, you don't want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Gigi told you that, didn't she?",
        "Rex: No, Gigi didn't say a word. I figured it out all by myself. And guess what -- Brody took a D.N.A. test to prove that he was Shane's biological father and I kept wondering how he could do that. And then I remembered the day before we got married. I was coming out of the shower and I caught you leaving the apartment with my toothbrush in a plastic bag. You made up some lame story about how you were trying to help me prove the truth about Charlie, but that wasn't it, was it? Did you give it to Brody? Is that what he needed to make the test go the way he wanted it to? I'm having papers drawn up and I'll send them to you in Paris.",
        "Adriana: Rex, can't we talk about this in person?",
        "Rex: What's there to say, Adriana?",
        "Adriana: You're willing to just give up on us just like that?",
        "Rex: No, you did that when you didn't trust me to love you enough.",
        "Adriana: Looks like I was right.",
        "Rex: Don't make this any harder than it already is.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Adriana: So, that's it? I just sign these papers and you're done with me? You break my heart over the phone and just move on?",
        "Rex: I think there's plenty of blame to go around here.",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Shane. I didn't want to lose you. Please, isn't there anything I can do?",
        "Rex: It's too late for that. I love someone else.",
        "Adriana: You're in love with Gigi?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I am.",
        "Adriana: No, you're not. You just think you are because you found out that she's the mother of your son.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Adriana: You'll change your mind. You don't know what you want right now.",
        "Rex: Actually, I've never been more sure in my life what I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Principal: Ms. Manning, I don't appreciate you hijacking the welcome-to-school assembly.",
        "Starr: But you were talking about role models.",
        "Principal: Positive ones.",
        "Starr: What's more positive than telling girls not to end up like me? You can't act like this stuff doesn't happen, because it does every day. If I could change one girl's life, wouldn't that be a really positive thing?",
        "Principal: You might just have a future on our debate team depending on your own future here at Llanview. But that really seems uncertain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Bell rings]",
        "Matthew: Jeez, Starr's in trouble and it's not even first period.",
        "Markko: The year's off to a smoking start.",
        "Langston: She can take care of herself, Cole.",
        "Cole: All right, come on, Matthew, I'll take you to your first class.",
        "Matthew: Actually, Langston has chemistry right next door, so we're going to walk together.",
        "Markko: Oh, I got to be jealous?",
        "[Langston chuckles]",
        "Markko: Get out of here. Meet up after school?",
        "Langston: Maybe. I'll let you know.",
        "Markko: What's up?",
        "Langston: Well, I wanted to see my uncle.",
        "Markko: He's sticking around?",
        "Langston: If Dorian doesn't run him out of town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Under any other circumstance I would enjoy this pushing and shoving with you, maybe even a drink together after. But not today. Not when the well-being of my niece is hanging in the balance.",
        "Dorian: Langston's going to be fine because she has me. Where were you when she was a frightened, lonely child on her own? Where were you? No, no, you wait until she is here in this house with me, because that works much better for you. Last night you saw the beautiful, strong, lovely young woman that Langston has become. And I'm telling you nobody is going to ever take that away from her.",
        "Ray: You'll be hearing from me.",
        "Dorian: Hello? Uh, get me Jared. Fine, get me Randi. Whoever -- get me someone! Hello, this is Dorian Lord. Um, I'm going to want you to, um, expedite -- step up the adoption procedure, uh, for me. Yeah, right away. I want it right away. Do whatever you have to do and -- and -- and wait, wait, importantly, get that dirt for me on Ray Montez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Adriana, I got to go.",
        "Adriana: We need to talk, Rex.",
        "Rex: There's nothing left to say.",
        "Adriana: Fine. Have a good life, Rex. You'll regret giving me up.",
        "Rex: I was just thinking about you.",
        "Gigi: Funny, I was just thinking about you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Brody: What?",
        "Adriana: What kind of idiot are you?",
        "Brody: Who is this?",
        "Adriana: Adriana Balsom. And you were supposed to make sure that it stayed that way. I gave you everything you needed to hold on to Gigi and Shane and you still screwed up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Are you okay?",
        "Rex: Uh, except for feeling like having been hit by a truck?",
        "Gigi: Hmm, it must be going around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Did I have to fly back to Llanview and hold your hand so you got it right?",
        "Brody: Look, half the people in Llanview know Rex is Shane's father. I did everything I could.",
        "Adriana: Well, not enough, because it's over. Rex is divorcing me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: 9:00 in the morning and we both feel this way. We've got a long way to go before the end of the day, too.",
        "Rex: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Rex is probably on his way right now to tell Gigi that he's free to be with her. But he won't stop there. He'll take Shane, too. Is that what you want? Because that's what's going to happen because you screwed up.",
        "Brody: I don't have to take this crap.",
        "Adriana: Everything that happens to Shane is on you, Brody. You ruined that little boy's life. I hope you're happy.",
        "Brody: Shut up. Shut up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I've had all good reasons why not to tell Shane the truth, but I can't live like this anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brody grunts]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What are you saying, Morasco?",
        "Gigi: The lies stop now. We need to tell Shane the truth today.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Hey, come on, it's time for some celebration.",
        "Charlie: Oh, just a second. You have gone through hell to be with Natalie and now you're just going to let her go?",
        "Jared: She said in the letter that --",
        "Charlie: No, forget the letter. What is your gut telling you? What has had you running all over town looking for her -- trying to convince people that something is not right?",
        "Jared: I know, but it --",
        "Charlie: No, but nothing. Son, either you love her enough to fight for her or you don't.",
        "Roxy: Hey, your pop knows what he's talking about. Because he's not giving up on Viki even though she went off to the deepest darkest Africa to get the hell away from him. Charlie, you're not giving up, are you?",
        "Charlie: No.",
        "Roxy: There you have it. Let's eat, guys.",
        "Charlie: Look, son, all I'm saying is don't give up just because other people are telling you you should. I mean, Natalie's worth more than that, isn't she?",
        "Jared: Way more.",
        "Charlie: Well, then go find her and let her know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You would actually use this baby you're having -- Nash's baby -- just to get back at Jared and me?",
        "Tess: Well, I wouldn't have to if you and Jared didn't kill Nash.",
        "Natalie: To do what, exactly? I mean, what the hell is the point?",
        "Tess: To seduce him, dumb ass.",
        "Natalie: You wouldn't.",
        "Tess: As revolting as it's going to be, I'll just hold my nose and get through it. I've been to bed with him before. I know what buttons to push.",
        "Natalie: If you dare lay a hand on Jared, I swear --",
        "Tess: Oh, I plan on laying way more than a hand on him, and you'll have a front-row seat. Chew on that, sis.",
