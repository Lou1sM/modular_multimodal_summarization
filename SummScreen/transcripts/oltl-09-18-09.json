        "Starr: Do not call her Hopie. Cole hates that.",

        "[Laughter]",
        "Starr: Markko's coming, right?",
        "Langston: Uh, yeah, as soon as his class gets out.",

        "Langston: I keep having visions of sorority girls dancing in my head.",
        "Starr: You really think he's gonna cheat on you?",
        "Langston: Well, not on purpose, but everybody has their limits. They have coed showers.",
        "Starr: He's living with my aunt. You guys are totally solid.",
        "Langston: Yeah, that's what every couple thinks when they're together. I mean, look at your parents.",
        "Starr: You're comparing you and Markko to my mom and dad?",
        "Langston: How many times have they been married?",
        "Starr: To each other or in total?",
        "Langston: I bet every time they thought it would last.",

        "Blair: You know what, T\u00e9a? That's a fine idea.",
        "T\u00e9a: So what is it? What is your problem with me and Todd getting married?",
        "Blair: Oh, well, actually, this has nothing to do with me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, no?",
        "Blair: No. I think I've been very respectful of you and Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ho ho. Respectful? Like when you threw yourself between us at Viki's wedding?",
        "Blair: Oh, I was just escorting Dorian.",
        "T\u00e9a: Into what, the drunk tank?",
        "Blair: You know, I don't really care what you do. You can just flaunt your so- called relationship all over this stupid town, but don't you dare come into my house --",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, so what you think what Todd and I have is a sham?",
        "Blair: Well, why else would you be asking my children for their blessing?",
        "T\u00e9a: Because their father wants them involved in his life.",

        "Todd: I know you're in there. You left your flip-flop out here. What's the matter, my wife won't buy you some decent clothes? You know, it's my money she's spending...which means I get final approval on all her men, so why don't you come out right now and show your face, and I can decide whether I want to tear it off or not?

        "Natalie: So, how is Llanview's newest hero?",

        "Blair: What, that Todd actually told the truth?",
        "T\u00e9a: That anyone does.",
        "Blair: Oh, what, because I'm such a big, fat liar, and what you have found with Todd -- actually, what you have made with Todd by lying, scheming, mindless, emotionless sex is just so pure and honest.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't know the first thing about me and Todd. Or about being honest with the man you love.",

        "Blair: I'm talking about your big secret. You know, the big one, the one that you don't want Todd to find out. Because if he knew, it would stop him right in his tracks from ever marrying you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Where's that cell phone?",
        "Todd: Ah, I'm sorry. Maybe I went too far with that whole \"tear your face off\" thing, but I hear about some guy hanging around my kids in a bathing suit, and I just get a little carried away. And for all I know, you're a swell guy. I'm sure you couldn't help yourself against my ex-wife's powers, and I'm sure you wouldn't have gotten involved in any of this if you'd know that...a crazy ex like me would be around. So now you have two options. You either come out and make nice... or you can stay at the cabana while I burn it down.",

        "Starr: I know, right? A little too fast.",
        "Langston: What are you thinking?",
        "Starr: Nothing. My mom and him, they just still run in each other's blood.",
        "Langston: Even when they're fighting?",

        "Cristian: Because I'm gay?",
        "George: Well, look, no offense, but it's not as if he has a lock on his bedroom door. Anybody would be a...feel uncomfortable.",
        "Oliver: I'm not uncomfortable, Dad.",
        "George: You've been acting strange since you got here. Oliver was not raised that way.",
        "Cristian: What way is that?",
        "George: Look, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm not gonna apologize for it. Our family does not believe in the homosexual lifestyle.",

        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Then why are you making him jump through hoops?",
        "T\u00e9a: Since when is a proper courtship constituted a hoop?",
        "Blair: Well, then why are you asking for my kids' blessing?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no. I want his kids to approve of our wedding.",

        "T\u00e9a: Why would I want an excuse to bail?",
        "Blair: Because you can't live up to Todd's standards.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha. That standard being you?",
        "Blair: You know, I think it's strange that a man with so many flaws can't accept them in others, don't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe that's what happened between you and him.",
        "Blair: But you're so perfect you don't worry, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh...I'm not perfect, Blair.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I know that, but Todd thinks that you are, and you are terrified that he's gonna find out the truth about you. I think that just about sums it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, it looks like I've got everything I need except marshmallows and graham crackers.",
        "Ross: Don't do anything stupid, man.",
        "Todd: No. I take my grilling very seriously.",
        "Ross: Ah...what, are you really gonna burn the house down?",
        "Todd: Well, no, technically it's a cabana, but yes, it's my specialty, you might say. So what's it gonna be? We gonna have a nice chat or am I gonna make a shish kebab out of you?",
        "Ross: Argh. Blair, where the hell are you?",
        "Todd: Do you prefer rare or medium or well done?",
        "Blair: What the hell is wrong with you?",

        "Blair: Man whore?",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's right. Don't bother denying it. Jack told me everything.",
        "Blair: Well, he'll say anything. He's just trying to get attention.",
        "Todd: Well, why don't you give it to him instead of your boy toy?",
        "Blair: Oh, excuse me; I think you're the one that tried to shove T\u00e9a down his throat.",
        "Todd: I don't hear you denying anything here.",
        "Blair: And why do you care whether I have a guest or not, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: That's a good question.",
        "Todd: All right, don't worry. Everything is fine here.",

        "T\u00e9a: How do you know?",

        "T\u00e9a: Oh, like you did the last time we got married when I almost died of smoke inhalation?",
        "Todd: That was an accident.",
        "Blair: Ahh...don't worry, T\u00e9a. This time he knows somebody's locked inside.",
        "Todd: Yes, and all he has to do is come out and have a little chat.",
        "Blair: Why? What for?",
        "T\u00e9a: You still haven't answered my question: What do you care what Blair does or with whom she does it?",
        "Todd: No, no. I don't care about Blair. It's about Jack. I'm worried about him. I have a right to know who's playing daddy to him.",
        "Blair: No, you don't.",
        "Todd: Well, you know, you've been saying the same thing about T\u00e9a since she and I got together.",
        "Blair: Are you sure that's all there is to it?",
        "Todd: Yes. What else would there be?",
        "Blair: Oh. That's right, Todd, you know, total honesty.",
        "Todd: All right, I'm tired of waiting. If you don't come out by the time I get to 5 --",

        "Todd: 1.",
