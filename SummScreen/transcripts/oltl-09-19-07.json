        "Marty: Why -- why did you do that?",
        "John: Just had to get you to stop talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nora: Come in.",
        "Matthew: Hey, Mom. What's up?",
        "Nora: What the hell are you wearing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Lindsay? Lindsay?",
        "Lindsay: Bo. I'm so glad you're here. You don't know what it means just to see a friendly face.",
        "Bo: Well, I brought someone that you're going to be even happier to see. Officer Haskins?",
        "Lindsay: Oh. Oh.",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Lindsay: Oh.",
        "Will: Hey, Mom.",
        "Lindsay: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well, I've heard about these Cramer family meetings, but I've never actually seen one.",
        "Roxy: They're kind of like apes in their natural habitate -- you know, in the magazine \"National Geometric\"? Where the two alpha females -- they're working over the younger one, trying to get her to blow off the stud gorilla who's trying to mate her? Go ahead, look. They're like harpies. They're, like, trying to turn Adriana against you.",
        "Adriana: You cannot be serious, Blair.",
        "Blair: Oh, I am dead serious. You choose Rex over your own family? Well, then you don't have one.",
        "Starr: Ok, Mom, don't you think you're being a little harsh?",
        "Blair: No, I am not. We're \"Cramer\" women. We stick together. At least that's what my aunt Dorian always told me -- isn't that right, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: I --",
        "Blair: So what's it going to be, Adriana? Your boyfriend digs up dirt on Todd -- are you with him or are you with us?",
        "Adriana: If this is how you're going to act, I don't want to be a Cramer woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Your honor, if I may, I'd like to be sworn in.",
        "Judge: This isn't a trial, Mr. Manning.",
        "Todd: I understand that, but I'm taking some pretty serious hits against my character here, and I would like to set the record straight. I'd like to make sure the court understands what really happened, what really took place between me and the child's mother.",
        "Judy: That's all a matter of public record, your honor. Mr. Manning is trying to manipulate this court.",
        "Judge: Let's see what he's got. Mr. Manning wants to be sworn in, swear him in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.",
        "John: I thought mike would've called by now. I don't know what's taking so long.",
        "Marty: Well, it could be a good thing, you know? At least you know it's not a slam dunk for Todd, or else they would've been home by now.",
        "John: Yeah, that's why Michael left him here -- he was afraid Manning would show up and try to take him whether the judge gave him custody or not.",
        "Marty: Well, that wouldn't be very good for his case.",
        "John: No, he did something like that, it would probably nail it for Michael and Marcie.",
        "Marty: I should probably go.",
        "John: Don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Things are looking a little hairy over there. You want me to go break it up?",
        "Rex: No, no -- no, no, no, no. Sit. If I thought that Adriana couldn't handle it, I would take care of Blair myself.",
        "Roxy: No offense, baby, but she almost beat the crap out of you.",
        "[Rex gasps]",
        "Rex: I could've taken her.",
        "Roxy: Hmm -- oh, yeah, sure. Did you see the look on her face when she found out that you gave the McBains the ammo to bring Todd down?",
        "Rex: Yeah, that's because you blabbed it. Don't do me any more favors, ok, Roxy?",
        "Roxy: Well, excuse me, but if you didn't screw up so badly, your mama wouldn't have to come and bail you out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Adriana, you cannot mean that -- that you don't want to be part of the Cramer family.",
        "Adriana: Why not? What exactly has this family ever done for me?",
        "Dorian: We've loved and supported you.",
        "Adriana: When was that? Before or after you stole my trust fund money? Or maybe it was when you hired that stalker who almost killed me.",
        "Dorian: This is not about you and me. This is about family -- our family.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and how you and your boyfriend tried to dig up dirt on Todd.",
        "Adriana: I am sorry if I think that Tommy should be with Michael and Marcie.",
        "Blair: He's Todd's son, ok? He's Jack and Starr's half brother -- you got it?",
        "Adriana: I know that, ok? And, Starr, I realize how hard this is for you and Jack.",
        "Starr: No, it is hard for everyone, especially my dad -- and the McBains. Look, I do feel sorry for them, too.",
        "Blair: Well, they shouldn't try to, you know, play dirty with your dad.",
        "Adriana: What were they supposed to do, Blair? Just hand over their son?",
        "Blair: It's not their son!",
        "Adriana: Tell that to Tommy!",
        "Blair: No, I'm telling you that! You need to back off, Adriana, or I tell you what I'm going to do!",
        "Adriana: Oh, what are you going to do, Blair?",
        "Blair: I'll tell you what I'm going to do!",
        "Dorian: We are in a public place here.",
        "Blair: Stop it!",
        "Dorian: You stop it. Blair?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: If that child were yours, believe me, there would be no question where the Cramer family loyalties would land. But the fact is that is not your child and you have no say in the matter whatsoever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Is it true, Mr. Manning, on the night of August 29, 2005, you tried to strangle Margaret Cochran in the motel room?",
        "Todd: Yes, but that was self-defense. Morgan: There are court transcripts to substantiate that fact, your honor.",
        "Judy: What about the other two attempts on his child's life?",
        "Todd: Now, look, this is my son. I would never hurt him.",
        "Judy: The truth is you tried to end that little boy's life even before it began, Mr. Manning.",
        "Michael: We are doing what we have to do here, ok -- for Tommy.",
        "Judy: And there is no denying you wanted Margaret dead.",
        "Todd: After everything that crazy bitch did to me, she deserved it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Where did you even -- where did you -- where did you get this shirt?",
        "Matthew: Roxy Balsom gave it to me.",
        "Nora: Ok, well, you can't wear the shirt.",
        "Matthew: Why not?",
        "Nora: Because I'm the prosecutor. I -- I'm the district attorney who's prosecuting Lindsay, and if someone should take a picture of you in this shirt and put it on the newspaper --",
        "Matthew: Oh, who cares?",
        "Nora: The mayor does and he's my boss.",
        "Matthew: Isn't it a free country?",
        "Nora: Well --",
        "R.J.: Well, yeah, it was --",
        "Nora: R.J.!",
        "R.J.: Last time I checked -- that, too.",
        "Nora: Hi!",
        "R.J.: Hey.",
        "Nora: How are -- uh --",
        "R.J.: I'm all right. How are you?",
        "Nora: Well, I'd be better if my son would change his shirt.",
        "R.J.: Oh, come on, Mom. Get with it -- this shirt's a hot ticket. I got Jamie one. I might have to get myself one, too.",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "[R.J. chuckles]",
        "Matthew: I bet you two want to talk. I'll see you later, R.J.",
        "R.J.: All right, man. You take it easy.",
        "Matthew: I'm going to go show Dad.",
        "R.J.: Uh-huh. Fight the power, baby.",
        "[R.J. chuckles]",
        "R.J.: That's a great kid.",
        "Nora: A little opinionated and headstrong sometimes.",
        "R.J.: Oh. Wonder where he gets it.",
        "Nora: Oh, yes. So, you here to talk about Lindsay, I presume.",
        "R.J.: Well, normally, I would never use our personal relationship to pressure you professionally.",
        "Nora: Good.",
        "R.J.: But I'm going to have to make an exception in this case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lindsay: You shouldn't be here. I told you not to come.",
        "Will: Mom, how could I not?",
        "Lindsay: I'm fine -- see? You didn't have to make this long trip, Will. There's nothing you can do. Bo's taking care of everything.",
        "Will: Mom, Mom? It's fine, it's all right. I want to be here.",
        "Lindsay: I am happy to see you, son. I missed you. It's been a long time.",
        "Will: I know.",
        "Bo: Will, we're going to let you in the cell so you can have a nice, private meeting with your mom. I'll take responsibility.",
        "Will: Yeah -- thank you, Bo.",
        "Bo: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: Order. I want order. That sounds like a confession, Mr. Manning.",
        "Todd: Well, I swore to tell the truth and that's exactly what I'm doing. Now, Margaret Cochran was deranged, and yes, I did try to kill her. But I want you to understand exactly what she did to me, though. On the day I was to be married, she shows up in a wedding dress to my hotel room and pulls a gun on me.",
        "Margaret: We're just going to go to our special place. We'll be happy. You'll see.",
        "Todd: You're not going to shoot me, Margaret. Next thing I know, she has knocked me out, she drags me out of there, and she's kidnapped me.",
        "Margaret: This isn't going to hurt a bit.",
        "Todd: Oh -- oh! And she held me for months in this, uh, remote, abandoned cabin, and she tortured me, physically and mentally. And she threatened me and my family -- everyone that I loved, and I did everything I could to get away, and I almost did. I was very close. But she caught me. She drugged me. And she raped me. And that's -- that's how my so was conceived.",
        "Judy: Thank you for your honesty, Mr. Manning, but doesn't all of this prove that you hated your son for what happened to you?",
        "Todd: No, no, no. I hated Margaret for what happened to me, and I wanted revenge for all the time she had taken from me from -- from the woman that I loved and from my children. And when she came back to Llanview, yes, yes, I wanted her dead and I tried to kill her",
        "Judy: And your unborn child?",
        "Todd: Now -- oh -- you've got to understand something. I was -- oh -- I mean, I was out of my mind. Do you understand? I'd been tortured, I -- I was -- I was held for weeks, you know, without -- without food or medicine. I was terrified Margaret was going to kill me and go after my children. I was trapped, I was scared out of my mind, and yes, when she arrived, I snapped.",
        "Judy: You didn't snap when you took a boat and rode Margaret Cochran out on to Llantano Lake to murder her. You gave that a good deal of thought \u0096",
        "Morgan: Objection.",
        "Judy: Didn't you, Mr. Manning?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, lis-- wait, wait a minute. No, on this point, she's very right. I did take Margaret out onto the lake with the intention of killing her, but I didn't. I didn't -- I couldn't because she was carrying my child. I stopped myself for him, for my son. That has to count for something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Matthew, bud -- hey. Aren't you supposed to be at soccer practice?",
        "Matthew: It got called off, thought I'd stop by and say hello.",
        "Bo: Well, hello. Nice shirt.",
        "Matthew: Thanks. Mom wanted me to take it off.",
        "Bo: Yeah? Well, you know your -- your mom, she's got a job to do.",
        "Matthew: Well, so do you and you're not telling me to lose the shirt.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah, but I -- you know, your mom and Lindsay, they have a history together. Enjoy.",
        "Matthew: Is that why she's chasing her?",
        "Bo: No, I don't think she's chasing her. I -- I think that -- well, I had to arrest Lindsay and hold her in jail overnight -- I mean, you know, and she's a friend of mine.",
        "Matthew: That's got to suck.",
        "Bo: Yeah, it really does, but in this line of work, you have to put your personal feelings aside, just like your mother's doing.",
        "Matthew: What if you can't?",
        "Bo: Well, in my case then, it would be time to hang up the old badge.",
        "Matthew: I'm sorry, Dad -- about Lindsay being in jail and all?",
        "Bo: Hmm.",
        "Matthew: It's got to be hard after going -- everything with grandpa?",
        "Bo: Yeah, you're right, it is. It's hard on a lot of people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Don't do this to me, R.J.",
        "R.J.: I'm sorry, Nora, but I don't have a choice.",
        "Nora: Oh, but you do -- you could turn around and walk right through that door like you never came in at all.",
        "R.J.: You know I love making you happy, but I can't --",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "R.J.: Not this time, not till you hear me out.",
        "Nora: Ok. Make it brief.",
        "R.J.: I had hoped that you and Lindsay had put your pasts far enough behind you that maybe you could take it easy on her this time. I mean, you know how rough everything's been on her since Jennifer was killed.",
        "Nora: Yes, I realize that.",
        "R.J.: She's different now. She's -- she's a good woman. She's not the same old self-centered Lindsay.",
        "Nora: Ok. How has she changed, R.J.? She was a murderer then and she's a murderer now, and I'll prove that.",
        "R.J.: Maybe not.",
        "Nora: So what am I supposed to do -- throw out the case because Lindsay's had an epiphany and become a better person who has killed someone?",
        "R.J.: You know how devastated you'd be if -- if you lost Rachel or Matthew.",
        "Nora: My heart goes out to Lindsay at the tragic loss of her daughter -- truly. But the loss of a child does not make an excuse for the cold-blooded murder of Spencer Truman!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lindsay sighs]",
        "Lindsay: I really wish you hadn't come here.",
        "Will: You actually thought I'd stay away? I still can't believe they think you killed a man.",
        "Lindsay: Will, they wouldn't have arrested me if they didn't think I was guilty.",
        "Will: Well -- well, from what I've read, you barely even knew Spencer Truman and he was -- he was attacking Blair Cramer when he was killed.",
        "Lindsay: Will, go home. Go back to your life. You have a wonderful job, a home. I want you to go home and I want you to meet a nice girl and marry her and have lots of children and don't let me ruin that.",
        "Will: What are you talking about? You're not ruining anything, ok? I love you, I'm worried about you.",
        "Lindsay: You don't understand. My life is over.",
        "Will: No, it's not, ok? How could you even say that?",
        "Lindsay: When Jen died, part of me died, too. It's like that when you lose a child.",
        "Will: Believe me, I know, ok? But you still have one. You still have me.",
        "Lindsay: And I love you so much. I am not going to sacrifice you, too -- I'm not worth it. I am not worth that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You sure you don't mind staying?",
        "Marty: No. No. I'm glad you want me to. So, what do you want to do? Uh -- watch TV?",
        "John: Don't have a TV.",
        "Marty: Oh.",
        "[Tommy cries]",
        "John: I think Tommy's awake.",
        "Marty: Yeah, sounds like it.",
        "John: I'll be right back.",
        "[Tommy screams]",
        "John: What do I do?",
        "Marty: Uh -- he probably needs changing.",
        "John: Changing, right.",
        "Marty: Do you want some help?",
        "John: He has pretty stinky pants -- I could use some backup.",
        "[Marty chuckles]",
        "Marty: Glad I'm here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Looks like things are settling down with the Cramer broads.",
        "Rex: Hmm, not so sure.",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah. They're not yelling at each other or throwing anything. That's a good sign, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd may be a lousy husband, but he's a wonderful father. Tell them, Starr.",
        "Starr: Ok. Can we just not fight about this? I mean, isn't there a way? This situation is bad enough -- do we have to all go off on each other?",
        "Dorian: Starr is right",
        "Adriana: Blair, you are my cousin and I love you, and I do not want to fight with you. But Todd is a disaster.",
        "Blair: Don't say -- Starr is right here. Don't talk about her father like that -- are you that insensitive?",
        "Adriana: You're right.",
        "Blair: Adriana -- gosh!",
        "Adriana: Ok, all right -- I'm sorry. Starr, I am sorry. I know he's your dad and I know that you love him, but I just can't take his side in this.",
        "Starr: Ok, and I understand that you're friends with the McBains. All right, Mrs. McBain is my favorite teacher.",
        "Blair: Was.",
        "Starr: She is great to me, Mom. Look, if Tommy was any other baby, it'd be different, but he isn't. He is my father's son. My dad is not the one who started this whole mess.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Adriana: I know, and neither did Michael or Marcie.",
        "Todd: When I took Margaret out there on that lake, I wanted revenge for all the hell she put me through. I wasn't even thinking about my kid.",
        "Judge: Ms. Cochran was in her third trimester. What do you think was in there -- a basketball?",
        "Morgan: Objection.",
        "Judy: You knew it was a child, Mr. Manning -- your child, and you wanted to get d of that reminder of how he was conceived.",
        "Morgan: Objection!",
        "Judge: Sustained.",
        "Judy: You hated your son for screwing up your life.",
        "Morgan: Your honor, she's badgering my client.",
        "Judy: You wanted him dead as much as you wanted his mother dead, didn't you? Admit it, Mr. Manning -- just admit it!",
        "Todd: Ok, fine, maybe I did.",

        "Rex: Thanks for not bailing on me.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, like always.",
        "Rex: Hey, who's keeping track?",
        "Roxy: Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ship you out when you were a kid.",
        "Rex: Don't worry about it. Aunt Corinne was awesome.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I'm sure she was better than your mommy dearest.",
        "Rex: How many of those have you had already?",
        "Roxy: It's not the booze talking. I was a sucky mom and nobody can tell me any different.",
        "Rex: Yeah -- ok, you were, but you got better.",
        "Roxy: You don't have to say these things so I'll stop blubbering.",
        "Rex: Look, look, let's just -- let's put it this way. If some crazy blonde is about to pound on me, I'm glad the crazier blonde's my mom.",
        "Roxy: That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.",
        "Rex: Hey, come here.",

        "Dorian: I'm sorry, Blair, but you're going to have to accept that Adriana is entitled to her opinion.",
        "Blair: I'm sorry, too, Dorian. I'm sorry you had forgotten all your speeches about being a Cramer woman, because according to your definition, Adriana certainly isn't one of them. I'm going to go check on Todd. Come on, Starr. Adriana -- if I find out that Rex has done anything else, he's going to have to answer to me. Come on.",
        "Dorian: Meeting adjourned.",

        "Bo: You're right, son -- I do miss Pa. I know you miss him, too.",
        "Matthew: I think about him all the time. I keep hearing his voice in my head.",
        "Bo: I know -- so do I. Huh. He was crazy about you -- you know that, don't you?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I was crazy about him, too.",
        "Bo: You know something? I have to go down to the ranch. I got to check on some things down there and also pick up some papers pa left. Why don't you go with me? We can go on a trail ride.",
        "Matthew: Really?",
        "Bo: Why not?",
        "Matthew: And I would miss school, too?",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. But, you know what? We'd leave today, tonight. We'd -- we'd be there one day, come back the next morning. You're talking about missing school one day.",
        "Matthew: Do you think Mom would let me?",
        "Bo: I don't know why she wouldn't, but I think you ought to run it by her, you know, just in case -- you know, school, all of that.",

        "R.J.: Maybe not. But you know that sometimes people aren't completely responsible for the bad things that they do, and sometimes they deserve a little help.",

        "Lindsay: No. I don't want you to stay here on my account. You and Matthew need to go. You need to do this. And there's no point in you being at my arraignment -- we both know what's going to happen. It's no surprise there.",
        "Bo: Yeah, sure. As soon as you plead not guilty, I'm sure that you'll be out on bail, and then you can spend some real time with Will.",

        "Todd: I love my son, your honor, and I want -- I want him in my life. I want him in my kids' lives. I want to raise him.",
        "Judy: That's all very touching, your honor, almost as tong as hearing Mr. Manning describe the horrors of being raped -- ironic, as it is, coming from the ringleader who initiated a gang rape when he was in college!",
        "Morgan: How long are you going to let this continue, your honor?",
        "Judge: Ms. Schulman Brown --",
        "Todd: Yes, I served my time and I was released.",
        "Judy: Which is inconceivable considering the crimes this man has committed since. It is astounding to me that he is even allowed to walk around free, let alone be considered capable of raising a child.",
        "Judge: Ms. Schulman Brown, I'm giving you one last warning. If this continues, I'll have to cite you for contempt.",
        "Judy: I'm sorry, your honor, but I can't help being passionate when it comes to the welfare of a child. My clients -- Marcie and Michael McBain -- have been the epitome of good, upstanding citizens while Mr. Manning has exhibited tendencies of violence whenever he's crossed. Can you really in good conscience give another child to a man who, in addition to a rape conviction, has been arrested numerous times for kidnapping, attempted murder, and most recently, assaulting an officer and breaking out of jail?",
        "Morgan: There were extenuating circumstances, your honor. Mr. Manning should've never been in jail in the first place. The charges were all dismissed.",
        "Judge: But, in light of all this new evidence, there may have been a mistake.",
        "Todd: What? Are you kidding me? Now, that's total crap.",

        "John: Oh, I doubt it. Child Services will want a full report, but the judge will probably be leaning one way or another.",
        "Marty: You know there's nothing you can do about it, right?",
        "John: Yeah, that's the hard part.",
        "Marty: Well, you just need to take your mind off of it.",
        "John: Any ideas?",
