        "John: We're takin' off in about five minutes. Yeah, I know, but this may be the tip that leads us to Cris. Hey, look, Bo, I -- I hate to ask but maybe you could do me a favor while I'm gone? Look, I know the last thing you need right now is a fight with the mayor but he confiscated my files and he took my computer and it'd be a big help to me if I can get those back. It's about the woman Manning has up at his house. I was this close to getting an I.D. on her, Bo, when he took my computer. Oh, he said something about harassing an innocent citizen. But who are we kidding? Last thing Manning is, is innocent.",

        "Tess: I warned you to keep this glorified rat-dog away from me.",
        "Tina: You know, he must sense that there is something amiss in the basement. Could it be that it's because you have your sister locked up in a glass cage?",

        "Jared: Oh, I understand how you must have felt when Sarah was missing.",
        "Tina: Well actually it's kind of different because Sarah was really missing. Natalie sent you a note saying she was going.",
        "Jared: Oh, right, yeah, that's why John McBain said that the cops couldn't do anything to help her.",
        "Tina: You know, maybe she just needs a little time.",
        "Jared: It just doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, I talked to Rex, I talked to Roxy, and Natalie left town without a word to either one of them.",
        "Tina: Okay, well, do you think maybe she could be with Viki?",

        "Tina: Why, because she felt so guilty?",
        "Jared: Well, yeah, I mean, Natalie did feel guilty about helping me cover up what I did to the family. We both felt guilty about what happened to Nash. But even if she was planning on dumping me, I -- I just don't imagine her abandoning her sister, not now.",

        "Gigi: And so am I. But we can't expect him to just accept the situation right away.",
        "Rex: I know. It's going to be a lot for that kid to take in, especially after everything he's been through the last few months.",
        "Gigi: He was finally feeling like he was getting to know his father. At least you have a relationship with him.",
        "Rex: Well, not a very good one at the moment.",
        "Gigi: I have a feeling he's going to be more angry with me than you anyway. I'm the one that's lied to him his whole life.",

        "Rex: Yeah, but you didn't ask him to fake a D.N.A. test.",
        "Gigi: True, but you know what, Rex, the guy's been through hell and whatever he's done, I actually do believe him when he says he tried to do it to protect Shane. And, of course, Shane sees him as a hero.",

        "Rex: So she knew and you knew she knew and you still didn't tell me?",
        "Gigi: Rex, I didn't know what you might do. You were getting ready to marry her, and her mom has all that money.",
        "Rex: That's why you kept quiet?",
        "Gigi: Partly, yeah. I was afraid. I mean, Shane and me, all we had was each other.",
        "Rex: Okay, okay, but I still should have known. Gigi, Adriana was so crazy. Not only did she bring Brody to town, she gave him a toothbrush of mine, and I'm willing to bet that's what he used for the D.N.A. test.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God. She tried to give me that toothbrush.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Gigi: Well, she said I could offer it as Brody's D.N.A. and prove that Shane was Brody's so you wouldn't try and take Shane away from me. I told her to shove it. Damn, she must have given it to Brody.",
        "Rex: I -- I can't believe all this was going on and I didn't have a clue. If you'd just told me what was going on, Gigi, I never would have married Adriana.",
        "Gigi: Well, it's not like I didn't try and stop that.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I know. If I'd just listened to my heart, we would never have been in this mess. You would've told Shane the truth and he never would have gotten so attached to Brody.",
        "Gigi: Well, the truth comes out today, Balsom, and everybody's going to have to do deal with it.",
        "Rex: Yeah, everyone. I told Adriana I want a divorce.",

        "Gigi: What did she say?",
        "Rex: Well, she tried to tell me that it was a big mistake. I think she knew I was still in love with you even before I did. That's why I don't understand why she still would have gone through with the wedding knowing all that, all the things she did.",
        "Gigi: She did because she was so crazy in love with you and she couldn't face losing you.",
        "Rex: You understand?",
        "Gigi: Well, I'm not saying I like it, but, yeah, I kind of get it. If I had known that you were going to leave me all those years ago, I probably would have done crazy things to get you to stay, too. But you did leave and then I agreed to live my life with a man I didn't really know and now Brody --",

Listen, I've been thinking about this and, you know, I don't think he should call me Grandma, because I think it's kind of old-sounding and, you know -- not that anybody would believe it, but I don't do age. So how about if he calls me Nana? I don't like that, either. How about just Roxy?",
        "Rex: I told her.",

        "Todd: What the hell is that?",
        "Tess: This is the kind of story that sells rags like this. Ahem. \"Only a few months after Natalie Buchanan and her lover, Jared Banks', false identity scam brought Buchanan Enterprises to its knees and resulted in the tragic death of Nash Brennan, Ms. Buchanan has dumped her conniving Casanova and fled Llanview.

        "Todd: Why would I print this?",
        "Tess: Because unlike the other garbage you put in that newspaper, that's true. Natalie's left town and nobody's seen or heard from her at all.",

        "Roxy: I know that. I read the letter that she left for Jared.",
        "Rex: I did, too. Sounds like Nattie's had enough.",
        "Roxy: She's crazy about Jared. No one in their right mind runs out on a love like that.",
        "Gigi: Well, sometimes you don't really know how much you love someone until you're apart for a while.",
        "Roxy: Huh? Oh, well, I don't think Nattie's going to wait 10 years to come back. I mean, she'd have to be nutty to wait that long.",
        "Rex: I don't think Nattie's going to stay away for 10 years. When she's ready, she'll get in touch with us.",
        "Roxy: If she calls you first, you better let me know.",
        "Rex: I promise.",
        "Roxy: Nattie is going to be so excited because she has a little nephew. Hey, Geeg, listen, I want you to know something. I know you had a real good reason for not letting Rex know until right now. She did that out of love for her son.",

        "Roxy: Oh, no problem. My two lips are sealed. Listen, when I got a secret, it stays a secret. You can ask anyone.",

        "Tess: That's your problem, Uncle Todd. You're just too suspicious. I didn't do anything to Natalie. Everything's in that article. You know, she couldn't bear to face Jessica after she knows that, you know, her and Jared were responsible for Nash's death, and every time she looked at Jared, all she could think about is how the two of them took a father away from his children. One will never know him. And then she took off to, you know, brighter pastures somewhere.",

        "Rex: What do you wish?",
        "Gigi: I wish you and I had had some time to just take a breath and celebrate finding each other again.",
        "Rex: What's stopping us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Believe me, I -- I know from experience how upsetting this is for you, I do. I've seen you with Shane and I know how much you care about him, I really do. But maybe, if it's okay with Gigi and Rex --",
        "Brody: No!",
        "Marcie: Then maybe you and Shane can still see each other.",
        "Brody: Once I'm gone, I'll be gone for good. There's no coming back, no matter how much I might want that.",
        "Marcie: I -- I think maybe I should call Gigi. I think that's what I should do right --",

        "Rex: You said Shane's good till 3:00, right?",
        "Gigi: Right.",
        "Rex: Nothing's going to change between now and then. This is our time. Our moment to pick up where we left off 10 years ago.",

        "Tina: Look, I just meant that, you know, when two people are so much in love, there's -- there's always someone who tries to break you up. But, you know, the trick is you have to stay strong, because you can never let them win.",
        "Jared: Yeah, I'm trying.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Jared: I'll get it. Ahem. Oh, Rox, what's happening? Did you talk to Natalie?",
        "Roxy: No. Yo, Miss Tina, how's that nail holding up?",
        "Tina: Great. You did an amazing job.",
        "Roxy: I am a cuticle genius. Hey, D.V. Okay, listen, man, I've been thinking about something. I realize that I know Natalie better than anybody on the whole entire planet.",
        "Jared: So, you've come up with some idea of where she might have been, right?",
        "Roxy: No, I don't have a clue. But listen, she's done this before, okay? Because when we used to have a fight, she used to storm out. I never knew where she went, and then I would get really scared because I thought maybe something happened to her. But here's the thing -- she came back. She always came back. Maybe not the next day, maybe not the next week, but she came back. And we could be yelling at each other, she'd tell me that she hates me, but I knew that she loved me. So, if she came back for my love, you better believe she's going to come back for your love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I don't believe this. So, so let's recap. You find the poor amnesiac Marty somewhere, and then you see a golden opportunity to get back at your arch enemy John McBain. But you were turning her against him, right?",
        "Todd: Wrong.",
        "Tess: And then you pretend to be her old dear friend Todd, which was truly gag-worthy, honestly. And she buys it. But then you fell in love with her!",

        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "Todd: That's ridiculous. I'm playing Marty for what she can do for me.",
        "Tess: Ah, yes. Well, that's what happened with Nash and I at first. You know, he was just a play thing, but then I realized that he -- he understood me like no one else. You know, he saw the good in my soul. It wasn't Jessica, it was -- it was Tess. And I fell in love with him. Does this ring a bell for you at all?",
        "Todd: No, that's not what's happening with Marty and me.",
        "Tess: Then why are you getting all crazed about it?",
        "Todd: I'm not getting crazy --",
        "Tess: Oh, come on, Todd. I hit a nerve. [Singsong] Todd's got a new girlfriend.",
        "Tess: [Normal voice] Actually, you two go way back.",
        "Todd: Shut up about that, now.",
        "Tess: Come on, Todd, that was a long time ago. Besides, if the woman that you raped can fall in love with you, then that must mean you're not a bad guy after all.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You know what, Rox, you're right. Whatever Natalie's reasons are for leaving, our love for each other is stronger. I have to believe she'll be back.",
        "Natalie: Don't give up on me, Jared. I would never leave you. Tess can't keep us apart.",
        "Roxy: I think we have to thin this out a little bit. I'll do it for free, okay?",
        "Jared: Thank you. I may actually take you up on that.",
        "Roxy: Yeah. And, you, I owe you a free Brazilian. And, you, I'm going to give you highlights, and you're going to end up looking like me. I'm only joking. Bye, I got to go to work.",
        "[David Vickers barks, whimpers]",
        "Jared: What's going on, boy? Maybe we should see what he's so interested in downstairs.",
        "Tina: Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should.",
        "Jared: I'll check it out. What's going on? Okay! So -- all right, well, sorry, pal. Whatever's got you so curious is going to have to wait.",
        "Natalie: No, no, don't wait, Jared.",
        "Jared: Maybe we should take him outside.",
        "Tina: Uh, no. No, um -- you know what, um, there's a key right here. Maybe it's to the basement. Why don't you give it a try?",

        "Todd: Shut up.",
        "Tess: You said it.",
        "Todd: I didn't mean it that way. I do care about her, yes, but just because she's got nowhere else to go. No, it's not about feelings, it's -- it's -- yeah, I mean, it's just being nice.",
        "Tess: You're a really nice guy.",
        "Todd: Well, what do you want me to do, Tess? Just throw her out on the street? She needs me.",
        "Tess: Oh, yeah. You're right. Because it's not like, you know, she has anyone else in Llanview that cares about her. Oh -- but there is John McBain, you know, that's madly in love with her. And he thinks you're hiding a woman in your house. How long do you think you can hold him off for, huh? And there is, you know, her orphan teenage son, Cole. And they both think that she's dead, so why would you want to disrupt their lives with the messy news that the woman they care about is still alive? And there is the fact that you hate both John and Cole.",
        "Todd: Just get out.",
        "Tess: Hey, don't misunderstand, Uncle Todd. I appreciate why you need Marty. You know, Blair hates you, your kids hate you, even Viki thinks you're a lost cause.",
        "Todd: No, she doesn't.",
        "Tess: And Marty appreciates what you do for her. But truth be told, I think it's what Marty does for you that really gets you off, which is truly creepy.",

        "Todd: That's enough.",
        "Tess: Hey, it's not me you have to worry about. You know, what are you going to do when Marty gets better and crawls out of that cocoon that you built for her and, you know, she finds out the truth, and then she's going to hate you.",
        "Todd: That's not going to happen. See you later.",
        "Tess: Why? What are you going to do? Break her legs, drop her on her head?",
        "Todd: No, we're going away in a couple of weeks.",
        "Tess: That's romantic. Where are you going and why a couple of weeks? What's happening in a couple of weeks?",
        "Todd: That's really none of your business.",
        "Tess: Well, I really don't care, just as long as when I wake up in the morning that is the cover of \"The Sun.\" Otherwise, I'm going to have to be forced to tell your little girlfriend, Marty, just how well you two once knew each other.",
