        "Natalie: Hey, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Natalie: I was just emailing Mom.",
        "Jessica: Oh, you heard from her?",
        "Natalie: Yes. Actually, she wrote all of us a few minutes ago from Paris.",
        "Jessica: Really? What is she doing there?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- sightseeing, enjoying the cuisine, having a good old time.",
        "Jessica: Really? Was this planned?",
        "Natalie: No -- spur of the moment. It's not like her, right?",
        "Jessica: No, but it's good that she's doing things like that.",
        "Natalie: Jess, what's up? Is something wrong?",
        "Jessica: Um -- no, no. I -- I was just giving more thought to the Jared Banks situation -- you know, how he wanted a job here.",
        "Natalie: Yeah?",
        "Jessica: Well, I think you should give it to him.",
        "Nora: \"And I can now tell the court with assurance, your honor, that Lindsay Rappaport did indeed have a motive for committing this heinous crime. She made the grim determination\" -- that's just -- you know what? That's wrong, that's wrong. It's too flowery -- keep it simple, simple, simple, simple, simple. \"She -- she decided in order for el custody of their son, Tommy\" --",

        "Nora: \"That she would have\" -- hi, Will. I thought you were going to get something to eat.",
        "Will: Oh, yeah. I -- I never made it to the diner. I ran into R.J.",
        "R.J.: And neither one of us had much of an appetite once we started talking about Lindsay.",

        "Nora: I'm sorry. I -- I wish things were different.",
        "Will: Then make them different, Nora, ok? It's your job to prosecute Mom -- I get that, I do -- but do you have to throw the book at her? I mean, especially now since she's -- she's not doing so well. You could make this easier on her.",
        "Nora: How? I mean, what do you suggest that I do, Will?",
        "R.J.: Just let her go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Lindsay, you don't have to go to prison for killing Spencer. There's a way for you to beat this and I'm going to help you do it.",
        "Lindsay: What's the catch?",
        "Blair: All you have to do is help Todd.",

        "Todd: Come on, now -- don't think too hard about it.",
        "Michael: My gut is telling me to kick your ass. So get out of my house before I do.",

        "Todd: Well, I'm here to negotiate.",
        "Marcie: Well, we are talking about Tommy's life, so it's going to cost you big bucks.",
        "Todd: Well, that's why I brought the big checkbook. Let us start the bidding.",

        "Sarah: And you would not even believe how quiet I am. I don't even own an electric toothbrush.",

        "Sarah: No, no, seriously. And -- and I'm not a partier. I mean, who would I invite, right? I don't really know anyone. And no boyfriend, so already that's an improvement.",
        "Layla: Ok, um, this is all moving a little fast for me.",
        "Adriana: Because we sprung it on you. I'm really sorry, Layla.",
        "Rex: Hey, blame me -- I'm the one who stole her away.",
        "Layla: Yes, you are, Balsom -- thank you so much!",
        "Vincent: Look, you and Adriana were the best of roommates, and I'm sure the two of you are going to miss each other, ok? But I believe Sarah here -- she's trying to do the right thing for you.",
        "Layla: I know, I know. It's just I'm not good at making decisions on the fly.",
        "Sarah: Hey, no pressure, no pressure. It was just a thought, a very intelligent, great, wonderful thought.",

        "Vincent: Hey, why not?",
        "Sarah: Exactly. Why not? Trial basis. If it doesn't work out, kick me out.",

        "Lindsay: So you have the power to clear me of Spencer's murder.",
        "Blair: Yes, I do.",
        "Lindsay: And in return?",
        "Blair: All you have to do is persuade Michael and Marcie to let Todd have his son back.",
        "Lindsay: Go away, Blair.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on, Lindsay. Just hear me out, would you, please?",
        "Lindsay: I've heard enough. I am not going to betray that family.",
        "Blair: Come on, Lindsay. Now, we both know what it's like to lose a child. And they are going to lose Tommy. No judge is going to rule against Todd -- he's the biological father and they took his son away from him against his will.",
        "Lindsay: And thank God they did. Tommy might not be alive if Todd had gotten his hands on him.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Lindsay: And what judge do you think is going to grant him custody of a child whose life he almost snuffed out before it began? And if Todd had a lock on this child, if this was a done deal, you wouldn't be here begging me for my help.",
        "Blair: No, I'm trying to make you see the big picture here. You have an opportunity ea the inevitable. And you can get free, or you can stay here while the authorities tear that child kicking and screaming from their arms. Because either way, Todd will get his son back. Come on. You can help yourself and help Michael and Marcie at the same time -- before it's too late.",

        "Marcie: Michael, I think Todd makes a very good point. Look, we are barely making ends meet on our salaries. You don't get a bump in your salary until you're out of residency. I think it would be a good --",
        "Michael: This is our kid!",
        "Marcie: Idea to listen to what Todd is offering to us. After rent and bills and student loans, we are broke. Michael, we're broke. You now, think about all that money, all that money -- we could adopt other children just like Todd said.",
        "Michael: You would take this bastard's money?",
        "Marcie: We're just talking. We are just talking -- that's all we're doing.",
        "Todd: Well, we're just talking. How much do you want?",
        "Marcie: How much are you offering?",
        "Todd: 100,000.",

        "Nora: Well, then, what -- are you, what -- you want me to give Lindsay special consideration --",
        "R.J.: No, no. We just don't want you to go too far in the other direction.",
        "Nora: Oh, I see -- ok. So, you think I'm out for revenge here -- I'll try not to be offended by that.",
        "Will: No, we never accused you of anything, Nora, ok?",
        "Nora: Hard to tell on that one, Will.",
        "Will: Ok, we're not, all right? We're just asking for your consideration when it comes to bail so that we can take care of Mom at home before the trial.",
        "Nora: Will, you know your mother's history. Lindsay's a flight risk.",

        "Cristian: Um --",
        "Rex: Whoa, look at the time. We better get a move on -- Lindsay's arraignment.",
        "Adriana: Right.",
        "Cristian: Oh, that's right -- I got to go, too.",
        "Sarah: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, you don't, not until you tell Layla what a good roommate I am.",
        "Rex: How about we meet you there?",
        "Adriana: Mm-hmm. Yeah, we'll see you -- bye.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, sure.",
        "Layla: Lay it on me, Cristian. Does Sarah make a good roommate? Is she the roommate from hell?",
        "Cristian: She keeps a pretty clean bathroom. She never leaves towels on the floor. She takes out the garbage without being asked. And if she finishes the O.J., she usually buys a fresh carton. She's ok -- good, actually. She's good, as far as roommates go. See you guys later.",
        "Sarah: Wait. Cristian?",
        "Layla: This may work out.",

        "Sarah: Oh, what was all that about -- the towel and the -- the juice and the garbage?",
        "Cristian: I was just trying to help you build up your rep. If she buys it, you're going to have to live up to the hype -- maybe a little food shopping once in a while. You're welcome.",
        "Sarah: Ok, all right. I owe you with my life.",
        "Cristian: I just want you to keep your promise, all right? You got a week to book a big-name talent in this place.",

        "Jessica: No. I thought about it some more and I changed my mind. I think you should hire him.",
        "Natalie: Why?",
        "Jessica: Well, did -- did you even give him a chance when he came in for an interview?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- I thought we discussed this. It was more like an all-out assault rather than an interview.",
        "Jessica: That's because you gave him attitude.",
        "Natalie: Hold it right there. I gave \"him\" attitude? The man barged into my office without an appointment.",
        "Jessica: That shows initiative.",
        "Natalie: And he -- he lied about knowing Grandpa. He acted like he was Grandpa's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or something.",
        "Jessica: No, he respects Grandpa, which is a prerequisite for working here.",
        "Natalie: Jess, the man's resume was a total piece of fiction.",
        "Jessica: Which shows that he is creative and can think outside the box.",
        "Natalie: And he's cocky and he's a loudmouth and he's smug and I just plain don't want him in my face, and now all of a sudden, out of nowhere, you do, so what's going on? Why do you even care?",

        "Jared: These are just first notices.",

        "Jared: Uh -- most of it. He was a genius.",
        "Nash: So I keep hearing.",
        "Jared: He's my hero, you know? He started with nothing, totally broke, worked as a ranch hand, then he got into the oil business and ended up outsmarting all his competition, built an empire.",
        "Nash: Well, it sounds like he was an inspiration to some. At least we got his book.",

        "Jessica: Well, yeah, I guess so. I just don't care.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, neither do I -- most of the time. I mean, I come in at 7:00 a.m., I leave at midnight, I'm working on the weekends. I mean, I do everything I can to prove that this is just as much my company as anyone else's, but I'm not going to let a bunch of gossip stop me.",

        "Blair: Oh, you are? Really? You know, I thought the death of your beautiful daughter made -- made you see t light. The horrible murder of Jen may have changed you, but, no, you're still the same selfish, wicked woman you always were.",

        "Vincent: Ah. What kind of job?",
        "Sarah: Booking. I'm taking over for Cris, bringing in new talent. How awesome is that?",
        "Layla: Wow, I had no idea Cris was looking to farm that out.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, well, you know -- so, when can I move in? I'm free tonight.",
        "Layla: Don't push it, Sarah.",

        "Roxy: I made it myself. You know, to the average Joe, I sell it for about 20 bucks, but for Lindsay's hottie-hot lawyer -- I'll give it to you for 15.",
        "Will: I'm not her lawyer, I'm her son. We've met.",
        "Roxy: Oh. Oh, man, I must have been asleep at the bar. Kind of embarrassing. Um -- well, you can have it for 10. Hey.",

        "Rex: We're all here to show our support.",
        "Adriana: That's right, and who knows? I mean, maybe when the judge sees how many people are on Lindsay's side, he'll be more lenient.",

        "Nora: That young man has enough of a struggle ahead of him without being lied to. His last living member of his immediate family's about to be sentenced to life in prison, and you're telling him she can beat the rap.",
        "R.J.: So I take it you're going for remand.",
        "Nora: Yes, of course I am. I don't have a choice, and you know that. Oh, and no one's buying that promise of yours that \"I'll keep an eye on her.\" R.J., We all know she had help when she broke out of Statesville a few years ago. Oh, don't be giving me that innocent look. You're just lucky that nobody checked into that whole farce. And don't be making matters worse by trying it again this time.",
        "R.J.: You don't even have a trial date set and you've got her convicted.",
        "Nora: I've seen all the evidence.",
        "R.J.: You know, Lindsay is lucky that the justice system leaves it up to a jury.",
        "Nora: The jury's going to see the evidence.",
        "R.J.: Another overconfident district attorney. You know, and you always underestimate the good will of the people.",
        "Nora: You know, it's like you said, R.J. -- This is about justice, not public relations.",
        "R.J.: Oh, public relations is a part of everything -- life, politics, the law, and in about 15 minutes, you're going to feel its power, when this courtroom is filled to the brim with Lindsay supporters.",
        "Nora: It's not really going to make that much of a difference to me.",
        "R.J.: Oh, I I mean, unless you have your own slogan-sporting cheering section, hmm? I don't see anybody out there demanding justice for Spencer.",

And, Lindsay, you'll be helping the McBains, too. Because if this keeps dragging out, it's just going to be more painful for them. And -- and it -- most importantly, you're going to be free. And you'll have a chance to redeem yourself for all the pain that you caused Matthew and Bo.",
        "Lindsay: It doesn't matter what happens to me.",

        "Lindsay: I did not create this situation! And neither did Michael and Marcie. Todd has to bear the responsibility of that. Michael and Marcie are Tommy's real parents in every way that counts, and I will \"not\" lift a finger to take him away from them!",

        "Michael: But you know what we can do? We can go to the judge and not only tell him, but show him that you feel differently. You see, if you were willing to give $10 million to us to buy your son, then our lawyer can argue the reverse. Give you $10 million to give up your own son.",
        "Todd: Give me that.",

        "Blair: You going to tell me what happened? All right, fine.",
        "Todd: What happened with you?",
        "Blair: You did. I went to Lindsay, told her that I'd testify that I saw her kill Spencer in self-defense -- if she would convince the McBains to give you your son back.",
        "Todd: That was a long shot, wasn't it?",
        "Blair: Yep.",

I never use the kitchen -- except for, you know, to get a drink every now and then. But definitely no cooking, so it'll basically be like I'm not even there, invisible. Perfect roommate, right?",
