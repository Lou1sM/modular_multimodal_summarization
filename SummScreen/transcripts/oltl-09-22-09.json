        "The judge rules in favor of Matthew getting the surgery. But Nora is distraught and pleads with her son not to go through with it now that he knows how Dr. Greg has failed with his own brother. Greg talks to Rachel about the demon that haunts him and tells him that he intentionally did this to Shaun. Stacy and Kim talk about what she should do regarding the pregnancy. And she admits that maybe she should give up on Rex since it's not his baby and he will never love her and the real father is a gay guy. Fish runs into Kyle and informs him that he finally came out to Layla and to his parents. And he and Kyle and Cristian and Layla all know how bigoted his parents are. After Jared has been assaulted yet doesn't have any information to give to John about the incident or the assailant, John admits he has suspicions about it."

        "Nora: Clint, where are you?",
        "Clint: I'm in the E.R. with Jared and Natalie.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Clint: Yean. Jared was assaulted. He's okay, but, you know, it happened right in his office, so I've changed security firms. What's happening with you?",
        "Nora: Well, the judge is about to make a ruling on Matthew's case.",
        "Clint: Oh. Well, look, I'm on my way. Are you at the courthouse?",
        "Nora: You don't have to come. I'm sure Natalie and Jared need you. I'll be okay.",
        "Clint: Are you sure?",
        "Nora: Positive.",
        "Clint: Well, you let me know when you get some news, okay?",
        "Nora: I will.",
        "Clint: I love you.",
        "Nora: I love you, too. Bye. Did you know about Natalie and Jared?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah. I got McBain on the case, sent some uniforms over to the office and to Llanfair.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Bo: Okay. So, this is it.",
        "Nora: Yeah. Elijah seems to feel good about the outcome.",
        "Bo: Do you?",
        "Nora: Um--",
        "David: As much as I hate to say it, you're going down, Dad, step-Nora.",
        "Bo: Vickers, you--or...David--",
        "David: You know how that hurts me, Dad. I'm just as much yours as my little brother Matthew.",
        "Nora: So what are you doing here, David? What are you doing here?",
        "David: I'm here to watch a return on my investment. Took every cent I had to bankroll Matthew's case, but it was worth it. We got T\u00e9a Delgado. Lady don't lose, y'all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: So, Elijah, do you have your bags packed? It's about time for you to slink out of town a loser.",
        "Elijah: Aw, man, I was hoping to get an invitation to the wedding, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: You heard?",
        "Elijah: Oh, what, do you think I wouldn't have? So, have you and Todd set a date?",
        "T\u00e9a: Friday.",
        "Elijah: What, this Friday? Hee hee hee!",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles] My divorce to Ross is final. Why would we wait?",

        "Rex: Marry me, Morasco.",
        "Gigi: You're serious?",
        "Rex: Yeah. I want to get married.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Rex: Don't you know?",
        "Gigi: No, I don't. Why in the world would you want to get married right now?",

        "Kim: Hello? Chocolate shake. I told them to double the chocolate since I know it's your fave.",
        "Stacy: Oh, no, thanks.",
        "Kim: Come on. It's good for the guppy.",
        "Stacy: Oh...",
        "Kim: What's wrong?",
        "Stacy: I can't.",
        "Kim: Can't what? Come on. Tell Kimmie.",
        "Stacy: I can't do this, Kimmie. I don't want to be a mother.",

        "Greg: Oh, Rachel, uh--",
        "Rachel: Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Greg: No. No. I can go. You're here to see Shaun, so--",
        "Rachel: Has anything-- can he--",
        "Greg: There's still no response.",
        "Rachel: Greg, don't run like you did last night, please. I came to see you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You're kind of killing the romance here, Gigi. I asked you to be my wife.",
        "Gigi: Out of nowhere, in the park. I'm in my Rodi's T-shirt on my way to work, and now you pop the question, this minute?",
        "Rex: Yeah. It's not like we haven't talked about marriage before.",
        "Gigi: I know.",
        "Rex: But there's always been, you know, something in the way. First, Shane needed to get to know me, and then he got sick. Then there's Stacy, and now there's...no reason.",
        "Gigi: You started to say Schuyler, didn't you? You're worried because you found me here with Schuyler?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Page 38. It's called \"the baby crowning.\"",
        "Kim: Oh, God, that is so gross on so many levels. First of all, ouch, and what kind of perv wants to be down there taking that picture?",
        "Stacy: Kim!",
        "Kim: Let alone who publishes it.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, and that's in the end. Any day now, I'm gonna start getting nauseous, have to pee all the time, and something called flatulence.",
        "Kim: Girl, get a grip. Not everybody gets nauseous, and at the end, there are drugs, and you will take them, okay? There's nothing that says you have to watch.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, but Rex will, and how is he gonna want me after seeing that?",
        "Kim: Okay. I'll keep Rex out of the room. I'm good at that.",
        "Stacy: No, it's not enough.",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Stacy: You know, I did all that crap for Shane with all the needles and the blood, all so Rex would love me, only he doesn't.",
        "Kim: You're having his child.",
        "Stacy: Only I'm not. I got knocked up by a guy who's practically a stranger and gay.",

        "Cristian: Yo, Fish, check this out. I moved the painting for this.",
        "Layla: We wanted it in the living room, okay?",
        "Oliver: Sure. I'm a big hero.",
        "Layla: Have you heard back from your parents?",
        "Oliver: 20 messages later, no.",
        "Cristian: Do you think they're still in town?",
        "Oliver: Uh, no. No. They got in the car and drove away as fast as they could. And now that they know I'm gay, I'm not their son anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Sorry for the wait. We've been a little backed up, but--",
        "Natalie: Oh, no. Kyle Lewis.",
        "Jared: You're a doctor.",
        "Kyle: Sub-intern, actually. I'm finishing up medical school. Just, this is my practical in trauma medicine, just dealing with minor injuries, under supervision, of course. I mean, look, if you guys are uncomfortable, I could definitely get somebody else.",
        "Jared: Yeah, how long is that gonna take? No. Never mind. I want to get out of here. Go ahead. Do it.",
        "Natalie: Honey, are you sure?",
        "Jared: Yes.",
        "Kyle: So, what'd you get hit with here, buddy?",
        "Jared: A fist, buddy. I got jumped.",
        "Kyle: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Jessica, any idea who this could be?",
        "Jessica: No. No, not at all. At first, I thought it was just some guy trying to spook me, and then, you know, I saw the threats that he left for Natalie and Jared, and I assumed that it was just somebody trying to get revenge for Nash's death.",
        "John: Hmm. Is that what you think?",
        "Brody: I'm not so sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: It wasn't you. I couldn't see anyone last night. I just needed some time.",
        "Rachel: For what?",
        "Greg: To think.",
        "Rachel: To blame yourself?",
        "Greg: I did this to my own brother, Rachel. I've been up every hour since, trying to figure out how I could've done this.",
        "Rachel: Any answers come?",
        "Greg: None that I can live with, and none that are gonna bring my brother back.",

        "Matthew: Ease up on my parents, will you?",
        "David: You mean, you want total dignified victory?",
        "Matthew: No, I just don't want them to be hurt.",
        "David: Eh, all right. I can do that as long as we get to gloat in private.",
        "Bo: Matthew, son, we got interrupted there at the house when we were talking.",
        "Nora: Yeah. You were talking to us when we got called away. It was about the surgery.",
        "Bo: You know, Matthew, it's not too late to call this all off.",
        "Bailiff: All rise, Honorable Judge Henson presiding.",
        "Judge Henson: Be seated. I'm ready to render my decision in the matter of Matthew Buchanan versus Bo and Nora Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Oliver, your mom already knew you were gay. I don't care what she says. She knew when she saw you and Kyle in college, and she still loved you.",
        "Oliver: You heard her. She had herself convinced that it was just a phase. You saw how she was, how they both were, you and Cristian. I'm sorry.",
        "Cristian: Come on, man. Don't worry about that.",
        "Oliver: They were weird about you being African American. They wanted me to move out when they thought you were gay. They're bigots.",
        "Layla: You're not responsible for how they are.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Well, the worst part is, I still love them, and I can't believe that they're just gone.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Oliver: Fish.",
        "John: I need you on a case.",
        "Oliver: Sure.",
        "John: Okay. Meet me in the hospital E.R. I'll forward you the details.",
        "Oliver: On my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Honey, we love the gay. That's the best thing that could've happened. Fish doesn't even know this is his child, and even if he did, he probably wouldn't want it. But Rex does.",
        "Stacy: Rex wants his child, not me. He's already talking about having a paternity test as soon as the baby's born.",
        "Kim: Look, that's now. Once the baby's born, he'll want it to be his, and then you and him can bond over the sweet little thing. Wasn't that the plan?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Kim: You guess? After everything we've done to rope in this little twerp, now you're having second thoughts? What's wrong with you today?",
        "Stacy: I've just been thinking, Kim.",
        "Kim: Stop that.",
        "Stacy: Okay. What if it doesn't work? What if I end up being a single mother with a puking baby and dirty diapers and Rex decides to stay with Gigi?",
        "Kim: That would suck.",
        "Stacy: And it'll happen. They are so strong, Kimmie. Nothing's gonna break them up, not me or this baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: This has nothing to do with Schuyler. I know he's your...good buddy.",
        "Gigi: You just choked a little.",
        "Rex: There's no reason to wait. There's no reason for us to put our lives on hold because of Stacy. We used to make plans. Now we don't even talk about it.",
        "Gigi: I just said that.",
        "Rex: Huh?",
        "Gigi: I just said those very words to Schuyler. Were you eavesdropping?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Gigi: You heard me.",
        "Rex: Okay, that's different.",
        "Gigi: You hid and spied on us.",
        "Rex: I saw you with Schuyler, and I stopped to take a few deep breaths to calm down. You guys kept talking. I happened to hear--",
        "Gigi: And your response is to blurt out a proposal.",
        "Rex: Yes.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Rex: Because you're telling that...guy things you think, things that hurt you, things that I should know, Gigi, but for some reason, you feel that you can't tell me. So I figured maybe if we were married, you'd come to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Your Honor, if it pleases the court, I'd like to be heard before you make your ruling, as some urgent new information has come to light since we've adjourned.",
        "Judge Henson: Five minutes.",
        "Elijah: Thank you, Your Honor. Gregory Evans just last week, against all medical and ethical standards, performed surgery on his own brother. It was during the surgery that he committed a grievous error, and his brother Shaun is still comatose. This is the same Dr. Evans who assured the court he's never lost a patient and was promising us that he couldn't hurt Matthew if given the chance to perform his surgery, as well. Yet as of today, he's virtually killed his own brother. I have corroboration, Your Honor.",
        "David: Dude, little bro, if this is true, you and I talk before any slicing.",
        "Matthew: There's no point. I'm already sunk.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your Honor, there is no parallel between Shaun Evans' case and my client's. Shaun Evans had suffered from a gunshot wound. He'd already been through one surgery, and he had developed a complication that none of the doctors attending him had fully detected. Furthermore, the only reason Dr. Evans performed surgery upon his brother was that none of the trauma surgeons on site were qualified to do so.",
        "Elijah: He still put his patient at risk and made a grave mistake, Your Honor. This is--",
        "T\u00e9a: The hospital is filing no charges against Dr. Evans. There is not one doctor that will back up what counsel is alleging. In any case, the circumstances are completely different and highly charged, nothing like the circumstances which surround the surgery Matthew requires, which is a simple procedure which Dr. Evans routinely performs with great success.",
        "Elijah: Yet, counsel cannot get around the simple facts of this case, Your Honor. Shaun Evans is not likely to recover because Dr. Gregory Evans vastly overestimated his skills as a surgeon, and who's to say he hasn't done the same thing in Matthew's case?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: You know, I trust you.",
        "Greg: That's a mistake.",
        "Rachel: I don't think so. And now it's time for you to trust me. Let's hear it, Greg, all of the rotten things that you have said to yourself since the surgery. Tell me.",
        "Greg: The decision to operate on Shaun, it didn't have to be.",
        "Rachel: There was a risk in waiting, too.",
        "Greg: Look, maybe I could've gotten on the horn and phoned in some favors, got another surgeon here the next day.",
        "Rachel: That's a maybe.",
        "Greg: [Sighs] I did this to my family, Rachel, because I had to be the hero.",
        "Rachel: Well, that's no big, dark secret, but that's pretty human. There's nothing wrong with that.",
        "Greg: Maybe I shouldn't have ever gone in after the bullet fragment. Maybe I went in too deep.",
        "Rachel: Again, more maybes. You can't do anything useful with those right now, unless it helps you see a way to change things for Shaun. Bottom line, you tried to make your brother whole and healthy, and it didn't work. It's not like you did this on purpose.",
        "Greg: What if I did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Sorry about that. You had a theory, Brody?",
        "Brody: For a while, I thought Nash's parents might be part of it.",
        "John: Why's that?",
        "Jessica: Well, no. They put Nash up for adoption. They didn't even know him.",
        "Brody: Then you showed up with the baby. Then they find out they had a grandchild attached to a wealthy family.",
        "Jessica: They were really nice. You didn't tell me you suspected them.",
        "Brody: I didn't want to upset you until I checked them out, completely.",
        "John: And?",
        "Brody: Oh, they're clean.",
        "John: All right, so you're not going with revenge?",
        "Brody: Uh-uh.",
        "Jessica: Well, if I've come to the belief that Jared and Natalie didn't cause Nash's death, then I don't understand why anyone would think differently.",
        "Brody: Let's hope Jared can give you some answers.",
        "John: Right. Get better. See you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: It looks like this might heal without stitches, but it might leave some scars.",
        "Jared: I don't want stitches.",
        "Kyle: Well, let's get a ct scan just to check that there's no cranial bleeding or facial fractures.",
        "Clint: Jared, how you doing?",
        "Jared: I'm fine. I told you, the creep looks worse.",
        "Natalie: Thank you so much for staying, Dad.",
        "Clint: Oh, yean. I'm on it until that lowlife is behind bars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: What do you need?",
        "John: A guy named Jared Banks was jumped in his office at Buchanan Enterprises. So, he struggled, so there should be something on his clothes.",
        "Oliver: All right. I'll bag them and get them to the lab myself.",
        "John: I'll be in with the vic.",
        "Kyle: Oliver?",
        "Oliver: Hey, are you working?",
        "Kyle: Yeah. I got back in med school.",
        "Oliver: That's great.",
        "Kyle: And you're a hero. Saw everything on the news. What's wrong?",
        "Oliver: Oh, nothing.",
        "Kyle: Oh, come on. Don't. It's not like I still can't tell.",
        "Oliver: I came out to my parents today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Listen, this is the hormones talking, Stacy. You need to snap out of it.",
        "Stacy: But they're telling me the truth. I mean, Rex loves Gigi. Even my mom saw that. You know, I was thinking about her today. If she knew what I was doing--",
        "Kim: What do you want, kid?",
        "Stacy: I don't know, a new life. I just feel like I've been throwing myself up against a big brick wall for years, and for what, a chance? It's like it didn't matter how bruised or tired I got, and now I'm just tired, Kimmie. I really am. I really don't care if anybody ever loves me again. It sucks so bad to work this hard for, what, a smile, let alone--",
        "Kim: Listen to me, Stacy, okay? If you're just scared about having a baby, we'll deal, but if you mean it, then we'll go to the clinic, and this will all be over. You're, like, 10 minutes pregnant. If you want out of this, now's the time. Just tell me what you want to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You have to deal with Stacy and this child, and I need to be able to vent somewhere. Schuyler understands.",
        "Rex: That's not all I heard, Gigi. You weren't just blowing off steam. You were giving up on us.",
        "Gigi: That's not true.",
        "Rex: I don't want to lose you. Marry me. Let's do it.",
        "Gigi: I love you so much, Balsom, but we can't get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Greg, whatever happened between you and Shaun, there is no way I can believe that you wanted him like this.",
        "Greg: No, Shaun's right. I wanted to hurt him.",
        "Rachel: What do you mean, Shaun's right?",
        "Greg: I can hear him. Look, I know how that sounds, but before you came in here, Shaun was talking to me as if he was standing right here.",
        "Rachel: That's you blaming you. Shaun would never think that of you.",
        "Greg: Like hell, he wouldn't.",
        "Rachel: But why? Why on earth would he think that you would deliberately try to hurt him?",
        "Greg: For you, so that I could have you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Henson: Sit down, Both of you. None of this information changes my ruling. I have listened to Both Matthew and to his parents. I have weighed the law, the facts, the personalities I was shown here in my courtroom, the judgment, the motives, and the odds. And based on that, the minor Matthew Buchanan shall be granted the right to make his own decision regarding the surgery.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh...that's fine.",
        "David: Good job.",

        "Cristian: I really thought he was exaggerating when he was talking about his parents, but, man, the way his dad looked at me when he thought I was the gay one--",
        "Layla: Pretty hateful.",
        "Cristian: I felt like a freak.",
        "Layla: Can you imagine how it felt being Oliver growing up living in fear of that look? It's no wonder he never wanted to admit he was gay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Wow, so you finally came out to George and Barbara. How'd that go?",
        "Oliver: Oh, like I always thought it would.",
        "Kyle: Oh, well. That bad?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. They couldn't get away from me fast enough. Pretty sure my dad is gonna change the locks on the doors.",
        "Kyle: Well, it's their loss. You did the right thing. You know that, right?",
        "Oliver: I know. I had to stop lying to Layla.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, but mainly to yourself.",
        "Oliver: Yeah. Actually, I told Layla and Cristian first, and they were amazing. They kept telling me how my parents would eventually get it, but I knew better.",
        "Kyle: I remember the look on your mom's face when she saw us. Broke my heart for you, and us. I knew you'd jump, though.",
        "Oliver: Well, I wasn't very brave.",
        "Kyle: They didn't make it very easy.",
        "Oliver: Still no excuse for who I became, the things I said to you, to that guy you were seeing...",
        "Kyle: It's not a big deal, you know? You made mistakes, and you're trying to fix them. I couldn't get out of bed in the morning if I didn't think that was possible. So, Oliver, what did it? What made you finally decide to come out?",
        "Oliver: Uh, a woman.",
        "Kyle: Layla?",

        "Stacy: Kimmie, you are the best, helping with me getting pregnant and all that.",
        "Kim: Only because you thought it'd get you what you wanted. But if it's not gonna get you Rex and you don't want the baby, anyway, I can have the car gassed up and loaded in an hour.",
        "Stacy: So you're really ready to ditch Llanview?",
        "Kim: Hell, yeah! I could use a good road trip.",
        "Stacy: What, you want to go home?",
        "Kim: Where we lived is nobody's home, but we can start over someplace sane and grown-up.",
