        "David: What a missed opportunity.",
        "Matthew: What was?",
        "David: I had to go for that stupid reality show, when I should have secured the rights to your story about you getting crippled and all, and suing your parents for the right to walk again. Ah. Would have made a great TV movie. I would have been brilliant.",
        "Matthew: Well, who would you play?",
        "David: You. We would have made the Matthew character a little older.",
        "Matthew: Well, if I was older, I wouldn't have needed to file the lawsuit in the first place.",
        "David: A minor detail.",
        "Matthew: Plus, we don't even know how the movie ends yet.",
        "David: Look, if you're going to keep making sense, you will never work in Hollywood. In the climax of our movie, our hero rises from the wheelchair, and he takes his first tentative steps. And the audience starts to weep into their rocky road.",
        "Matthew: Hmm. Whatever you say.",
        "David: You never saw \"Heidi,\" huh?",
        "Matthew: No.",
        "David: Dilettante. So when's the surgery, anyway? You scheduled that yet?",
        "Bo: I'd like to hear the answer to that.",

        "Layla: Morning.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Layla: Have you seen Oliver yet?",
        "Cristian: Nope. But I wouldn't blame him if he took the day off.",
        "Layla: No kidding. He finally gets the guts to tell his parents who he really is, and they walk out.",
        "Cristian: You know, I saw him staring at his phone last night.",
        "Layla: He's still hoping to hear from them?",
        "Oliver: No. No, I'll never see my parents again.",

        "John: How are you doing?",
        "George: Excuse me; do you happen to know where I might find the proprietor? I want to check out.",
        "John: Oh, did you give Roxy your credit card number?",
        "George: Oh, that strange blond woman? Yes, but I want a statement.",
        "John: Yeah, sure. She can be a little flaky. I'll tell you, why don't you -- why don't you give me your name? I'll leave a note for her and make sure she gets it to you.",
        "[Bell rings]",
        "Marty: You can trust John. He's the chief of detectives here in Llanview.",
        "George: Ah. Been on the force myself for 25 years.",
        "John: Oh, yeah?",
        "George: George Fish. Yeah.",
        "John: Oh. Oliver Fish is your son?",

        "Layla: Talking behind your back or anything.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, you were, but it's okay. I know it's because you guys care.",

        "Charlie: That's right. We kind of hit the ground running.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Todd: You scared?",
        "Viki: Of Dorian?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Please. If she had any more skeletons in her closet, she could open a museum.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs]",
        "Viki: To what do we owe this visit?",
        "Todd: Well, we've got some news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well, well, well -- this is the first time I'm seeing you since you got back from Tahiti.",
        "Blair: Well, I've been just a little bit busy.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm. Must have been quite a shock to you to find out that your daughter and grandchild were kidnapped while you were gone.",
        "Blair: Oh, wow! I have failed, Dorian. Gee, I guess I should have known that, you know, some Russian gangsters were going to kidnap my daughter and granddaughter. I mean, it happens every day, doesn't it?",
        "Dorian: Okay, was it worth it? Did you find Ross Rayburn?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a and I are getting married.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "Blair: Oh, I found Ross Rayburn. Not only is he T\u00e9a's partner in crime. It turns out he's her husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: When?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh -- tonight, actually.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You mean, ex -- ex-husband?",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no. Mr. and Mrs. Rayburn are very legally married, only T\u00e9a thinks they're divorced -- which should put a big monkey wrench in the wedding she's planning tonight.",
        "Dorian: Tonight?",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah. When Todd finds out that she's been lying to him, he's going to see her for who she really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You seem to have had some sort of falling out with your son.",
        "George: I don't have a son anymore.",
        "John: You know I work with him, right?",
        "George: Oh, you're in the same precinct?",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "George: Well, I hope he hasn't caused you any problems.",
        "John: He's a good cop.",
        "George: Well, do you and his fellow officers know that he's a homosexual? Oh, he didn't tell you?",
        "John: It's none of my business.",
        "George: And his lifestyle -- that doesn't concern you?",
        "John: Sir, no more than mine concerns you.",
        "George: You have children, Detective McBain? Then you can't possibly understand, can you?",
        "Marty: I have a son, and he's 18.",
        "George: Well, then you know what I'm talking about.",
        "Marty: Did you say that Oliver's no longer your child?",
        "George: That's right.",
        "Marty: I walked away from my son once. It was the worst thing I have ever done in my whole life. Please don't make the same mistake that I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: I -- I thought you and Dad had left town.",
        "Barbara: He wanted to. I convinced him to stay the night at a hotel. He's still insisting on leaving.",
        "Oliver: Does he know that you're here?",
        "Barbara: He thinks I'm picking up food for the trip home.",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Barbara: I don't like lying, Oliver.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, neither do I, Mom.",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Barbara: Can we talk?",
        "Layla: Oh, sure. We'll run down to the deli and pick up some sandwiches for you.",
        "Barbara: I can't let you do that.",
        "Cristian: It's not a problem.",
        "Oliver: Get everything on white bread.",
        "Oliver: I -- I thought that was it. I thought I wasn't going to see you ever again.",
        "Barbara: Your father believes what he believes. I've learned over the years that I can't change him.",
        "Oliver: What about you, Mom? What do you believe?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Come on in.",
        "[Starr gasps]",
        "Starr: Oh, my God. Cole...",
        "Cole: Not bad, right?",
        "Starr: Ha! It's great!",
        "Cole: I just wish you and Hope could move in.",
        "Starr: Well, I'll be 18 in January.",
        "Cole: True. And once you hit the magic age, it'll be you, me, and Hope.",
        "Starr: And Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Hey, Carlotta cut the checks yet?",
        "Waitress: Yeah, they're in the shelf behind the counter.",
        "Ernesto: Geraldo -- what did you say to your mother?",
        "Markko: Papi, what are you talking about?",
        "Ernesto: She came home last night in tears. She said she's leaving me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I'll see if I can get you some haba\u00f1ero pepper sauce.",
        "Matthew: So I called Dr. Evans. I -- I want to get the surgery as soon as I can, but he hasn't called me back yet.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, he probably has his hands full with Shaun.",
        "Matthew: He's going to be operating on my spine, not my brain. What happened to Shaun --",
        "Bo: Could happen to you.",
        "Matthew: It won't.",
        "Bo: Son, the best doctor in the whole world cannot predict the future. Okay? They do their job, they hope for the best.",
        "Matthew: Well, you saw that gymnast, Loretta. She got the best. She can walk now.",
        "Bo: And if I knew for absolute certainty that you would have the same outcome --",
        "Matthew: Well, it's not your decision anymore, it's mine. I won, okay? So deal with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: If T\u00e9a and Ross are still married --",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm?",
        "Dorian: Then why does T\u00e9a think they're divorced?",
        "Blair: Well, it's complicated. When I was in Tahiti, I found out that Todd proposed to T\u00e9a.",
        "Dorian: How?",
        "Blair: Well, she called Ross and wanted him to sign the divorce papers.",
        "Dorian: And did he?",
        "Blair: Yes, he did. But he didn't file them.",
        "Dorian: Wow! That's like something I would do.",
        "Blair: Well, I learned from the very best.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Indeed, you did. With one glaring exception. You haven't learned that Todd is not worth all of this.",
        "Blair: Dorian, I am not going to stand by and let T\u00e9a make a fool of Todd.",
        "Dorian: Well, it's the best sort of revenge.",
        "Blair: No, it isn't. She's cocky. She needs to have the rug pulled right out from under her.",
        "Dorian: Maybe she'll tell Todd herself.",
        "Blair: Well, maybe she hasn't. And for some reason, she doesn't want him to know that she's married to Ross, so -- what I think is that there is definitely more to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're getting married tonight? Isn't that a little rushed?",
        "Todd: Well -- look at this chick, man. Why would I wait?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: All right. Anyway, I got to go.",
        "Viki: You just got here.",
        "Todd: Well -- you got something you want to ask Viki, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Todd: And I got a wedding to attend to, so -- I'll be back.",
        "[T\u00e9a giggles]",
        "Viki: Okay, what did you want to ask me?",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Marrying Todd may be the biggest mistake of my life.",
        "Viki: Honey, if you're not sure about marrying him, you make him wait.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: But maybe part of me thinks that -- ahem -- if I wait till I'm sure, it'll never happen. He says he loves me. He says he'll never leave me ever again. I am making -- ahem -- a very conscious decision to believe him.",
        "Viki: Okay, but?",
        "T\u00e9a: But maybe part of me thinks that I'm jumping in now before he changes his mind.",
        "Viki: And goes back to Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Okay. Have -- have you got a theory as to why T\u00e9a wants to keep her marriage to Ross a secret from Todd?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, I'm not really sure. I thought first, maybe she just wanted to have her cake and eat it, too. You know, have Todd in one time zone and Ross in another, but --",
        "Dorian: She asked Ross for a divorce.",
        "Blair: Yes, she did. But for some reason -- you know, I just thought maybe she -- she wanted to hang on to Ross, but she was afraid to be caught, but I just think that there's something else.",
        "Dorian: Like what?",
        "Blair: Well, that's the million dollar question, isn't it? Why is T\u00e9a lying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I know my brother, okay? And I know his history with Blair. But he chose you. And I actually think that Blair has finally gotten him out of her system.",
        "T\u00e9a: When Nora and you threw the bouquets, she went after it -- Blair -- like she was pole-vaulting.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I know. But you're the one marrying Todd, because that's clearly what he wants.",
        "T\u00e9a: For today, anyway.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "Viki: Why are you still not sure?",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, yesterday, Jack found some boy toy of Blair's hiding out in the cabana by the pool.",
        "Viki: And?",
        "T\u00e9a: And Jack told Todd. Todd went ballistic. He threatened to burn down the cabana if the guy didn't show his face.",
        "Viki: And you think it was jealousy?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, wouldn't you?",
        "Viki: Uh-uh. I know from my own experience it is possible to feel very proprietary about an ex without wanting him back in your life, and that's especially true if you have children together.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, but it's more than that. Viki, did you know that -- um -- Todd and Blair slept together recently?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Uh -- so you know that T\u00e9a and I are planning to get hitched, right? All right, and you know that's kind of a big deal?",
        "Jack: For most people, I guess.",
        "Todd: It is for me, too. I'm nervous about it.",
        "Jack: Seriously?",
        "Todd: Yeah. And I need someone to stand up there with me.",
        "Jack: You don't really have a lot of friends.",
        "Todd: No, so, would you be my best man?",
        "Jack: What's in it for me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Cole: How do you like the new place?",
        "Langston: It's fine. I got a ticket.",
        "Starr: You got a ticket for what?",
        "Langston: Defacing public property. Because Dorian just had to have me plaster these all over town. I mean, I knew it. I -- oh. Cool. This is actually a really cool place. Hello, Hopie.",
        "Cole: Don't -- don't -- don't call her that, Langston.",
        "Langston: Aw.",
        "Starr: Where is Markko?",
        "Langston: He's not here yet? Oh. Well -- um -- I'm sure he's on his way.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Papi, what do you mean, Mom's leaving?",
        "Ernesto: She wants a separation. She's already spoken to a lawyer. What did you say to her?",
        "Markko: Nothing. She came by to see me for, like, 10 minutes, that's it.",
        "Ernesto: You told her to divorce me!",
        "Markko: I told her about school, and that you probably wouldn't let me come home again. But she said that you would, because she's been trying to convince you, even though she thinks you're stubborn, like me.",
        "Ernesto: I'm not stubborn. I just know what's right.",
        "Markko: See? That's why I told Mom don't bother.",
        "Ernesto: Our family is broken because of you.",
        "Markko: No, Papi. It's because of you. You loved Langston before you found out that we slept together. You loved me.",
        "Ernesto: You think I don't love you now? But sex before marriage is -- it's a mortal sin.",
        "Markko: Why? Why? Who are we hurting?",
        "Ernesto: Who are you to question God? You scare me, Geraldo.",
        "Markko: Oh, I get it. You want to save my soul.",
        "Ernesto: Si, mijo. Our faith -- it's part of who we are. You're flying in the face of all we believe.",
        "Markko: But, Papi, Langston is my soul. And if I -- if I have to choose between her and you, I choose her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You won your case, Matthew. But for your mom and me, it's a big loss.",
        "Matthew: I know, and I'm sorry, okay?",
        "David: Uh -- oh, you don't want to look at that.",
        "Bo: Why? What, you think I give a damn what Todd Manning thinks, or anybody else? All I care about is you, son, and I -- I am going to fight like hell to get you to change your mind.",
        "Matthew: Mom already tried that.",
        "David: Come on, give the kid a break.",
        "Bo: You stay out of this. Look, your mom is tough, but if anything ever happened to you --",
        "Matthew: Look, this is my decision. She'll handle it, and so will you.",
        "Bo: When you lose a child, you don't just handle it. It's the worst thing that can happen to a parent. Are you willing to chance that, hmm? Because I'll tell you something, son. I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a, don't do this to yourself.",
        "T\u00e9a: Am I nuts to marry Todd?",
        "Viki: Okay, do you believe that he loves you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Yeah?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-him.",
        "Viki: And that he'll be faithful to you?",
        "T\u00e9a: As faithful as I've been to him.",
        "Viki: What does that mean?",
        "T\u00e9a: Viki, there are things that I haven't told him yet.",
        "Viki: What sort of things?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What's with that attitude? I ask you to be my best man and you want to know what's in it for you?",
        "Jack: Well?",
        "Todd: Hey, hold on a second! Don't walk away from me. Yes or no?",
        "Jack: I want you and Mom to get back together. T\u00e9a's hot and all, but she's not mom material.",
        "Todd: Well, first of all, you don't know -- you don't know that about T\u00e9a. She might be. And secondly, she's not going to be your mom. Your mom's your mom, and T\u00e9a's not going to be a substitute for her. Plus, you're never going to see her probably. She's going to be working all the time. But I guess if you want, you know, some new computer gizmo or something, that's fine.",
        "Jack: Only until you buy me a car.",
        "Todd: All right, agreed. So that's it? We're done negotiating? You going to be my best man?",
        "Jack: Aren't I always?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Is this Mr. Rayburn attractive?",
        "Blair: Well, does it really matter?",
        "Dorian: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!",
        "Blair: What's so funny? No -- Dorian, I'm just using him to sink T\u00e9a. He's a means to an end, okay?",
        "Dorian: Right, right, and he's halfway around the world.",
        "Blair: Well, not anymore.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Blair: He's here.",
        "Dorian: Where?",
        "Blair: In your caba\u00f1a.",
        "Dorian: That's a cabana, not a motel!",
        "Blair: I'm just stashing him there until he can escort me to Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding tonight.",
        "Dorian: Blair, you have got to cut this out, and right now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "George: With all due respect, I'm not talking about my family with two strangers.",
        "Marty: No, I understand. But I'm Marty Saybrooke. I'm a psychiatrist. And sometimes it helps to talk to someone who's been --",
        "George: I don't need a therapist. I live by the word of God, Ms. Saybrooke. And I cannot condone behavior that is sinful. Period.",
        "Marty: I'm not suggesting you condone anything. I'm merely talking about your son who -- who needs your support right now.",
        "George: Who's on the path to damnation.",
        "John: Your son's a hero.",
        "Marty: Yes, he helped save my grandchild just a few days ago. You should be nothing but proud of your son.",
        "Nick: See you later?",
        "Kyle: Yeah.",
        "Nick: All right.",
        "George: You don't think that's an abomination?",

When I gave that commencement speech at graduation, I saw you looking up at me. And you had tears in your eyes. And I thought there's no way I'll ever forget that. But you took it away. And for what, how I love my girlfriend? Say something.",

        "Bo: \"Held back\"? You know what? If you don't let your kid go away to summer camp, or you keep him from getting good grades, that's holding him back. Matthew has no idea what he's gambling with right now, or what it's like to lose a son -- and what that does to a man. There's not a day goes by I don't think about Drew, and I wish that he was still here. He's not. Now, I have to live with that.",

You're also the reason he lived a lie for so long. Oliver was never ashamed about coming out, he just didn't want you to feel shame. But you do, right? I ran into him the other day. He told me what happened. He thinks you're done with him. You know what that's doing to him? To think that he's never going to see you again. It's killing him. Hello, Mrs. Fish.",

You try to be a good dad, and sometimes, you're really bad at it, but at least you try. That's very foreign to me. Matthew's pretty lucky to have you.",
