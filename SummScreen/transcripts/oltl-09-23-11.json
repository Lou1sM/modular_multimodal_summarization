        "Many people are having dreams. John envisions telling Natalie that he is in love with her but awakens on the bar stool at Rodi's realizing he drank himself to sleep without reaching out to Natalie. Jessica envisions getting back with Brody and having him propose to her, but she awakens to the cold reality that she and Brody are through and he's proposed to her sister. Jack Manning is in the classroom having a dream that his new teacher is Gigi who grills him in front of everyone to admit that he knows all about carbon monoxide poisoning which killed her. Shane sits across from Jack staring at him and revealing he has a secret. Blair informs Starr and then Tea that she believes the only way not to \"lose\" Jack and salvage any hope of her son developing a conscience is to \"back\" him and believe that he's told the truth about seeing original Todd kill Victor although she knows he's lying."

        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Natalie: I have something to tell you.",
        "John: I have something to tell you, too.",
        "Natalie: Ok. You want to go first this time?",
        "John: I still love you. I mean, I'm still in love with you.",

        "Natalie: Uhh!",
        "Brody: What? Hey. You ok?",
        "Natalie: It was just a dream.",
        "Brody: It was just a dream.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Are you gonna sleep through the whole thing?",
        "Jessica: Brody, what?",
        "Brody: I know it's bad luck to see you the day of our wedding, but I figured that was all about the dress.",
        "Jessica: I don't understand.",
        "Brody: You gotta get ready. We're late enough as it is.",
        "Jessica: For our wedding?",
        "Brody: Who else's? You don't really think I could marry anybody else.",
        "Jessica: No. No, you couldn't.",
        "Brody: I can't wait to see you walk down that aisle...to me. My beautiful bride.",
        "Clint: Sorry if I startled you, Jess. Honey, are you ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Mmm... Todd--um, Victor. Uhh!",
        "Todd: You got it right the first time, Delgado.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uhh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Footsteps]",
        "Todd: Hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: What are you sorry for?",
        "Jack: For lying to the cops.",
        "Todd: I didn't kill Victor.",
        "Jack: I know. I'm sorry, Dad.",
        "Todd: Say that again?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: No, no. The second part.",
        "Jack: Dad.",
        "Gigi: Ok, can anybody tell me what that stands for? What about you, Jack Manning?",
        "Jack: Miss Morasco.",
        "Gigi: You know the answer, don't you? I heard you knew all about carbon monoxide.",
        "Shane: What's your problem? You look like you saw a ghost.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Morning!",
        "John: Is it? Whew.",
        "Bo: Rough night?",
        "John: No. No, not really. What can I do for you, boss?",
        "Bo: Show up at work.",
        "John: Yeah, I'm on my way.",
        "Bo: No, not yet. I don't want you showing up drunk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Footsteps]",
        "Blair: Knock knock!",
        "T\u00e9a: Do you have any idea what time it is?",
        "Blair: As a matter of fact, I do. School has started. Jack managed to make it out of the house. Guess what. You can, too.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm tired. Besides, what's the point of getting up anyway?",
        "Blair: You forgot, didn't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Forgot what?",
        "Blair: You forgot that Victor was dead, and then you woke up.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm going back to bed.",
        "Blair: No, no, I think the best thing for you to do is to get up and let that blood move through that body. Come on, get moving.",
        "T\u00e9a: I get up, Blair, it gets worse.",
        "Blair: It can't get any worse, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, it can. Not only is Victor dead, Todd wants me to prove that he didn't kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: Good morning, son. Did you sleep well?",
        "Todd: Oh, shut up, Irene.",
        "Irene: That's a rather sad greeting for the one person in the world who could set you free.",
        "Todd: What, Oprah's here?",
        "Irene: You doubt me?",
        "Todd: No, I don't doubt that you stashed Louie somewhere and the gun that I never fired. And I'm sure that you will give it back as soon as I dig up whatever it is that you think that I have, even though I don't have it, and I don't know where it is, and I have no idea how to find it.",
        "Irene: Now you're playing with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What are you doing out of your wheelchair?",
        "Clint: Oh, I got sprung, at least in part. Physical therapist wants me up and on my feet.",
        "Jessica: Great! How about we do a lap of the first floor, ok?",
        "Clint: Honey, you don't have to babysit me.",
        "Jessica: I'm not babysitting you.",
        "Clint: Your mother already ran me around the grounds. Then she got Lois a stopwatch. So between them, I'm getting plenty of exercise.",
        "Jessica: Well, maybe I'm not.",
        "Clint: I think you are. Heard you up this morning about 4:00, then again at 5:00, and once more at 5:30.",
        "Jessica: Bree just has a fever, and it should be better once her antibiotics kick in.",
        "Clint: Oh, that poor kid. Let me go see her.",
        "Jessica: No, no. The last thing you need is to get an infection. She'll be fine. I finally got her to sleep, and now, hopefully, Ryder will sleep.",
        "Clint: Well, with your mother and myself, you gotta let one of us help you out.",
        "Jessica: No, they're my babies. I'm just happy I get to take care of them.",
        "Clint: You got a look of pure joy on your face, too, but you're wearing yourself out.",
        "Jessica: I'll get my second wind.",
        "Clint: Now you're having nightmares.",
        "Jessica: No, I wasn't having a nightmare.",
        "Clint: Jess, I can see it.",
        "Jessica: Dad, it wasn't. The dream was wonderful. Waking up was the nightmare.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Yeah...weird. I can't even remember what my dream was about.",
        "Brody: That happens to me all the time.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Brody: Ok, so, should we get up?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I guess it's about that time, huh? What? Nice try. What is that over there?",
        "Brody: It's a surprise for you.",
        "Natalie: Oh, yeah? A good surprise?",
        "Brody: That's all we get now.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my.",
        "Brody: When I proposed to you, I left out the most important part.",
        "Natalie: Oh, it's...",
        "Brody: Yeah. So, what do you say? Will you wear my ring?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It was just like our wedding day before. Brody was worried about seeing me in my dress.",
        "Clint: Was it a double wedding?",
        "Jessica: No, Natalie was nowhere to be seen. But maybe that's what happened next. I get to the altar and find that he's proposed to Natalie.",
        "Clint: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Jessica: Oh, but he already has.",
        "Clint: What?",
        "Jessica: Brody proposed to Natalie.",
        "Clint: Aw, hell.",
        "Jessica: You know, guess he wants his perfect family after all.",
        "Clint: I'm sorry, darling.",
        "Jessica: It's ok. Natalie hasn't said yes yet. She says it's because she's worried about me.",
        "Clint: At least she's being decent about all this. And you know that Natalie loves you.",
        "Jessica: No, it's not the reason. I'm not buying this whole I-don't-want-to- hurt-my-sister act. I know that she's not ready, but I know she's too scared to tell Brody the real reason.",
        "Clint: If it's not you, what's holding her back?",
        "Jessica: John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It was last night.",
        "Bo: You slept here?",
        "John: It seems so. If it's any consolation, I feel like crap.",
        "Bo: You smell worse. Something happen?",
        "John: Uh...no. Just a rough night.",
        "Bo: Anything you want to get off your chest?",
        "John: I think I'm good.",
        "Bo: Really? You know, the last time you tied one on like this, it was after the wedding. So, what happened with Natalie this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: My God, Brody, it is so beautiful.",
        "Brody: Is it ok?",
        "Natalie: I love it.",
        "Brody: Is it enough?",
        "Natalie: You did not just say that.",
        "Brody: I was afraid it would look cheap.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, shut up. This looks like you spent a fortune on it. Any bigger, and I might be able to knock someone out.",
        "Brody: Now I know you're just mocking me. You don't like it.",
        "Natalie: No. No.",
        "Brody: Then what?",
        "Natalie: I'm picturing Jessica seeing it.",
        "Brody: We're getting married. You have the right to wear my ring.",
        "Natalie: Brody, I know, I know. I just want to do what's right for Jessica and for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So, Todd actually used Dani to get to you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you surprised? He said he's completely innocent and that I'm the only lawyer on the planet who could get him cleared.",
        "Blair: That's because you're a shark.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you.",
        "Blair: That doesn't mean that you have to be his shark.",
        "T\u00e9a: Two days ago, I would have said that Todd killed Victor.",
        "Blair: Now you're not so sure?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know. Todd swears that Jack's lying.",
        "Blair: I can understand why you might doubt Jack.",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't say that.",
        "Blair: You're not the only one, either.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why? Do you...",
        "Blair: I have my own questions about Jack's story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Whew... quit staring, ok?",
        "Shane: You look like something's wrong.",
        "Jack: My dad just died. What do you expect?",
        "Boy: Hey, Jack. Sorry about your dad.",
        "Boy: Yeah. We didn't think you'd come back to school yet.",
        "Jack: Yeah, me neither. It's my mom's stupid idea. Like I'd forget what I saw if I came here.",
        "Boy: So, it's true? You heard the murder?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Boy: And your dad knocked you out?",
        "Jack: That freak is not my father. He's the killer who shot my real dad.",
        "Boy: Todd Manning hit you, right? And then he killed your dad?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Worst day of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You think I'm playing with you. Do you even know what they did to me in that day spa you were running?",
        "Irene: I'm afraid I was otherwise occupied.",
        "Todd: I was tortured and drugged, consistently, for 8 years. Don't you think I would tell you what I knew? There's only so much electroshock a body can take.",
        "Irene: You really don't know.",
        "Todd: No. No, I really don't. And if my life depends on it, it would be really helpful if you would tell me what it is.",
        "Irene: I suppose the medications and the conditioning may have affected your memory. But it's in there, Todd. Deep inside, you know what I'm looking for and where you hid it. It's just going to take the right motivation to pluck it out.",
        "Todd: Could you, I don't know, maybe draw me a map or a diagram? How about I phone a friend? I could ask the audience. What is it? Just tell me what it is you think I have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Victor didn't do Jack any favors by the way he handled things.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's hot. Yeah, I'm with you on that.",
        "Blair: I'm just concerned he's gonna think it's ok to lie to the cops.",
        "T\u00e9a: As long as the ends justify the means. I thought you were behind Jack 100%.",
        "Blair: I am. He's my son. I love him, but that doesn't mean I'm blind, T\u00e9a. It certainly doesn't mean I want him to grow up thinking that he can just cut corners where he shouldn't.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, like on murder investigations? So, what are you gonna do?",
        "Blair: I'm gonna defend him against you and anybody else who comes up against him.",
        "T\u00e9a: But I thought you just said--",
        "Blair: I know what I said, but he is his father's son. If he thinks I'm doubting him just a little, he's gonna pull away, and I'll never get to the truth.",
        "T\u00e9a: So, you're gonna keep him close, hoping that he grows a conscience?",
        "Blair: He has a conscience. You've seen it and so have I. We just have to give him some space, T\u00e9a. He needs it so he can find it on his own again.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's your plan?",
        "Blair: You have a better one?",
        "T\u00e9a: You need to find a way to get through to him.",
        "Blair: I have an idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Boy: So, do you have to testify?",
        "Jack: I guess. Rayner's coming. I gotta finish the homework.",
        "Boy: Right. Later.",
        "Jack: What are you looking at?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Where's my bouncing baby boy?",
        "Brody: He's still out.",
        "Natalie: Aww! That means he's gonna power right through his nap time.",
        "Brody: I couldn't--no, I'm good. I couldn't stand to wake him up. Don't worry. I promise I'll wear him out later with that new toy. He loves my animal noises. What?",
        "Natalie: You're just the best dad ever.",
        "Brody: I think Clint could probably give me a run for my money. I should probably call him, make it official.",
        "Natalie: Whoa, what?",
        "Brody: Ask for his blessing.",
        "Natalie: Like my hand in marriage?",
        "Brody: Hey, we're doing this right, right?",
        "Natalie: Right, but you know how my dad is.",
        "Brody: Yeah, but he's your dad, so he gets to take his shots.",
        "Natalie: Brody, you don't have to do this.",
        "Brody: It's the least I can do for you. Besides, it's for me, too. I'm not gonna let anyone, not even your dad, make us feel guilty. It's time Clint heard that from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I cannot believe what a mess this whole thing has turned into. Hell, I like Brody. He's a decent guy, and he was good for you.",
        "Jessica: Until he wasn't. But hey, at least you still get to have him as your son-in-law.",
        "Clint: This is not how I wanted it. I made Natalie promise me.",
        "Jessica: Made her promise you what?",
        "Clint: On my deathbed, I made her promise me she would do everything to work it out with John.",
        "Jessica: You want Natalie to get back together with John? You're not exactly his biggest fan.",
        "Clint: That's true, but Natalie loves him, and he loves her, and that's who Natalie should be with, not Brody.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Clint: Well, look at this. His ears must be burning. Lovett, what is it?",
        "Brody: Hello, Mr. Buchanan.",
        "Clint: What do you want?",
        "Brody: I know this situation is awkward, but I want us all to be able to get through it.",
        "Clint: Mm-hmm. You were engaged to Jessica. Now you've just proposed to her twin sister. Is that supposed to make us feel warm inside?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I never thought I'd see the day when you'd be asking me to share my feelings.",
        "Bo: Just think of me as your bartender.",
        "John: Ok. Nothing happened with Natalie. I haven't even seen her.",
        "Bo: What set you off?",
        "John: I guess it was Roxy.",
        "Bo: Roxy made you do this?",
        "John: No, no. This was all me, but you know how she has that way of getting under your skin.",
        "Bo: I still think this is about Natalie.",
        "John: Yeah, she wouldn't let go of something, and then she got me to say something--",
        "Bo: About Natalie.",
        "John: About how I still love her. I just said it to shut Roxy up, but the truth is--",
        "Bo: You're still in love with Natalie.",
        "John: You know what? I'm gonna get cleaned up, and I'll see you at the station in 30 minutes.",
        "Bo: And that's it?",
        "John: What else is there, boss?",
        "Bo: You tell her.",
        "John: Natalie's with Lovett now. They live together. They have a kid. End of story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Like I said, I know it's awkward. I wanted to ask your blessing before I proposed to Natalie--",
        "Clint: But you couldn't control yourself long enough?",
        "Brody: It was no secret. Natalie and I were already together.",
        "Clint: And that's supposed to make it, what, ok?",
        "Brody: I love her. We have a son. Our family, our whole family, is very important to us. We'd like your blessing.",
        "Clint: What if I say no?",
        "Brody: Excuse me?",
        "Clint: What if I refuse to give you my blessing, because I don't want Jessie to be hurt like this?",
        "Brody: I'd say I'm really sorry. Neither one of us ever meant to hurt Jessica, but we won't sacrifice our lives for her. We're getting married, and we'd like your blessing, but we'll get married anyway.",
        "Clint: If she says yes.",
        "Brody: She already has.",
        "Clint: Lovett, we're done here.",
        "Jessica: Go, Dad. That was awesome! What?",
        "Clint: Natalie said yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Ok, that went--",
        "Natalie: Got it.",
        "Brody: As expected. But what was he gonna say?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Maybe that he's happy for his daughter?",
        "Brody: You know, he loves you. Just might take a little while for him to accept this.",
        "Natalie: Well, I'm proud of you anyway.",
        "Brody: For what?",
        "Natalie: For standing up to Clint Buchanan. Not a lot of men can do that.",
        "Brody: And live to tell the tale.",
        "Natalie: He's pretty intimidating.",
        "Brody: I can handle it. Natalie, are you sure you're ok with this?",
        "Natalie: What, with everyone against us?",
        "Brody: Maybe not everyone.",
        "Natalie: Listen, I've definitely been the bad guy a few times, and I'm actually kind of good at it.",
        "Brody: I know how tough you are.",
        "Natalie: Got that right.",
        "Brody: Really. If you want to back out, this is the time to tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You still love Natalie. You don't want to tell her. You'd rather drink yourself stupid instead.",
        "John: This is where you remember what a fine detective I am anyway. Come on, I bet you were looking for me at the station this morning.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "John: Lay it on me.",
        "Bo: You're gonna hate this more than I do.",
        "John: Hit me.",
        "Bo: Irene Manning. We have to cut her loose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: When I found out your father had left you $28 million, I was so angry I couldn't see straight. Do you know what that money could have done for me and Victor Jr.?",
        "Todd: So, why didn't you show up and say, \"Hey, everybody, I'm not dead like everybody wishes I was\"?",
        "Irene: I was too deep undercover at that point. And no one even knew that Victor Jr. existed. Given the hostilities we were likely to encounter, I didn't think it would be good for him.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that, and it would expose your rogue agency.",
        "Irene: That, too.",
        "Todd: Is there an end to this story? Somewhere? Like, the thing that you're looking for?",
        "Irene: Patience.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm just gonna leave this here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why?",
        "Blair: Don't worry. It'll make sense later. Oh, I almost forgot. I found this right at the front door as I was coming in.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's from the \"Sun.\"",
        "Blair: You don't have to do this.",
        "T\u00e9a: It looks like it's Victor's personal effects from the office. No. I can--",
        "Blair: You want me to stay?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. You go work on Jack, ok?",
        "Blair: I will, soon as you are up. Ok, here. Put on this.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why?",
        "Blair: Because it makes your ass look great, and I hate you in it. Hey...you call me if you need anything, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: Whatever you think of my reasons, I took an indirect route to Victor's fortune. I sent my agents to recruit you.",
        "Todd: I remember some line about using my media empire to serve my country.",
        "Irene: If only you had been sincere when you agreed to help.",
        "Todd: If only I'd known they were evil, I'd have told them to go to hell.",
        "Irene: But not before you took a little insurance. A microchip.",
        "Todd: That's it? That's the thing?",
        "Irene: No bigger than the tip of my little fingernail. And it contains information that could wreak havoc on the agency.",
        "Todd: And you're sure I took it?",
        "Irene: That's when you had to be replaced with your brother.",
        "Todd: Right. When you just switched me with a new Todd.",
        "Irene: We had to utilize your mind to program Victor to take your place. Then, of course, we worked to persuade you to surrender the microchip.",
        "Todd: If only you hadn't scrambled my brain, because I think this I would remember.",
        "Irene: Now that you know, we can search your memory together. There are techniques--",
        "Todd: No, that's ok. I think I've had enough of your techniques.",
        "Irene: Do you want your freedom, Todd? Then you're going to have to work with me. Otherwise, you're gonna spend the rest of your life behind bars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Don't be silly.",
        "Brody: Am I?",
        "Natalie: I love my dad, but I'm not gonna let anyone tell me who I'm allowed to be with.",
        "Brody: I didn't mean just Clint.",
        "Natalie: Brody, it's ok. I can be the town pariah. It doesn't bother me. I am with you. It's what I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You got any more good news?",
        "Bo: You don't seem too surprised.",
        "John: I'm not. I figured she'd still have to have friends in Washington or somewhere. She just seemed too...calm about being arrested.",
        "Bo: Because she knew it wouldn't last that long.",
        "John: Yeah. Who made the call? Langley?",
        "Bo: The Bureau.",
        "John: That's just covering for the agency.",
        "Bo: They want this to just go away. The only way to keep it quiet is if Irene walks.",
        "John: That's just great.",
        "Bo: They're sending somebody today.",
        "John: Make sure we know how to open a cell door?",
        "Bo: Yeah, something like that. I'll see you at the station.",
        "John: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: I'm not looking at anything.",
        "Jack: Right.",

        "Jack: Mom, what are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You have to take my case.",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't believe you're still asking.",
        "Todd: You're the best lawyer in town. I'll give you $5 million.",
        "T\u00e9a: Is that supposed to be funny?",
        "Todd: Kind of. You married me for $5 million--",
        "T\u00e9a: I thought you didn't have any money.",
        "Todd: This--I... for Dani, then. Do it for our daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Look who woke up.",
        "Natalie: There's my little Cookie Monster.",
        "Brody: Already dressed.",
        "Natalie: Hello. Did Daddy wake you up with all his crazy animal noises? Hi, baby. Yeah, I'm dressed. I am.",
        "Brody: We don't have to be at work for a while.",
        "Natalie: I know. I just have a little thing I have to take care of before work.",
        "Brody: Ok, so, give him to me, and I will see you later.",
        "Natalie: Ok.",
        "Brody: All right, bye.",

        "Todd: What's going on?",
        "Irene: I'm being released.",
        "Todd: Really? Truly?",
        "Man: Directive from the Justice Department in Washington.",
        "Todd: Are you joking? You're ok with this?",
        "Bo: It's out of my hands.",
        "Irene: It has been a pleasure.",
        "Bo: Not for everyone in this town. I may not be able to stop what's happening right now, but I'll make you a promise. And you can pass this along to your boss in Washington. If you do anything else to hurt people in this town, if you do anything remotely illegal to make Viki's life any harder, you will pay, Irene. There are no more passes for you.",
        "Irene: How does she do that?",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Irene: Victoria. She's always able to inspire such intense loyalty in her friends. So much help whenever she needs it. That must be a wonderful feeling.",
        "Bo: Get her out of here.",
        "Irene: We'll be in touch.",

        "Clint: Hold on.",
        "Jessica: For what?",
        "Clint: Talk to your old man.",
        "Jessica: Dad, there's nothing to talk about. Brody proposed to Natalie, and Natalie said yes. There's nothing left to say.",
        "Clint: Ok. Then let me give you a hug.",
        "Jessica: Ok. I can't believe it. I really thought she was gonna say no.",
        "Clint: She didn't do this to hurt you.",
        "Jessica: Not for me, Dad. For John McBain.",
        "Clint: Jess, this is a bump in the road, and you're gonna get past it.",
        "[Ryder crying on monitor]",
        "Jessica: And there's Ryder. I have to go get him. I have to start this day now.",
        "Clint: All right, let's start this day. Why don't you gather your babies, bring them into the kitchen. I'll do breakfast.",
        "Jessica: You're gonna cook?",
        "Clint: Don't make it sound like I poison people, ok? You remember how much you love my blueberry pancakes, and I'm not gonna get Bree's germs. Don't worry about that, 'cause I'll be slaving over a hot griddle.",
        "Jessica: Ok...I know what you're doing.",
        "Clint: How could you? My recipe's a secret.",
        "Jessica: It's Lois' recipe.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Ready for a wedding, buddy? Huh? Your mama said yes. You know how happy I am? You're gonna be my boy in every way that counts. Nobody can take that away from me, not even John. All that trouble died with Victor Lord.",

        "Natalie: Ok, why don't you go first this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, that's it, huh? You just let Irene walk.",
        "Bo: I hate this as much as you do.",
        "Todd: She's a danger to everyone in this town.",
        "Bo: I don't owe you answers, Manning.",
        "Todd: This is just ducky. She gets government-issued \"Get Out of Jail Free\" cards, and I can't get competent representation? I can't even post bail? Aren't these things my right?",
        "Man: Commissioner, Manning has a visitor.",

        "Blair: I just came here looking for you.",
        "Jack: Why? What did I do wrong?",
        "Blair: Jack, this isn't about anything that you did wrong. I just felt that maybe it was too soon for you to come back to school, that's all.",
        "Jack: Yeah, after what Todd did to my dad?",
        "Blair: I understand.",
        "Jack: You do? So you believe me. You know it was Todd, too?",
        "Blair: Jack, of course, I do, because you said you saw him. I believe you.",
