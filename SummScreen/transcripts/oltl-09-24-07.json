        "Natalie: Well -- wait a minute. Let -- let me get this straight. You knew Jared Banks before he came to town?",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, \"knew\" is pushing it. We met.",
        "Natalie: But I thought you said you sent him to prison.",
        "Jessica: I did \u0096 or Tess did.",
        "Natalie: Did he know about you and Tess?",
        "Jessica: I don't see how he could.",
        "Natalie: But you remember?",
        "Jessica: Now I do, when I got integrated.",
        "Natalie: Ok. So, Tess put Jared in prison, and now he's blackmailing you?",
        "Jessica: That about covers it. But how do I break it to Nash that I knew his partner before he bought half of our vineyard?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You want to tell me why my wife's picture is your phone screensaver? And when did you take this shot, anyway?",
        "Jared: I didn't. She did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: How do you plead, Ms. Rappaport?",
        "Will: Mom?",
        "Judge: Mr. Cody, if your client is unprepared to speak for herself, the court will enter a plea of not guilty on her behalf.",
        "Lindsay: No! That's not my plea!",
        "Marcie: Lindsay, don't.",
        "Lindsay: I'm guilty.",
        "[Gallery murmurs]",
        "Lewis: Your honor, my client has clearly misspoken.",
        "Lindsay: No, I haven't.",
        "Will: Mom, what are you doing?",
        "Lindsay: I am guilty. I killed Spencer Truman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You -- want me to marry you?",
        "Todd: You said it yourself. I need to do whatever it takes to get my son back, even if that means marrying you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: This picture -- this was taken a long time ago. This was taken when Jessica --",
        "Jared: She called herself \"Tess.\"",
        "Nash: You knew Tess?",
        "Jared: Who didn't? Your wife got around.",
        "Nash: Wait a minute -- and you followed her here? You sick son of a bitch. That's what this has all been about? The poker game, the buying the vineyard, the -- the -- the job at B.E. -- so you can get next to my wife?",
        "Jared: You're half right.",
        "Nash: Jessica is not Tess.",
        "Jared: No?",
        "Nash: No.",
        "Jared: Let me tell you something, Nash. That night at Roxy's, I knew I could beat you -- why? Because when you told me you were married to Tess -- oh, excuse me, Jessica -- I knew you were a chump.",
        "Nash: The woman you knew --",
        "Jared: Made a fool out of me like she's making a fool out of you. She sent me to prison, Nash! You know what it's like to sit in a cell because some self- centered woman had nothing better to do? She set me up for kicks. Yeah, and ok, I fell for it. But she moved in like a bitch in heat. Oh, yeah, you want to hit me? Yeah, go ahead, huh? I've been through worse, thanks to her.",
        "Nash: Please -- you're talking about my wife.",
        "Jared: Your wife set me up, called the cops, and then she took a picture on my phone so I could see her laughing at me! That's why I'm here -- to wipe that smile off her face.",
        "Nash: If you go near my Jessica --",
        "Jared: You're going to what, kill me? Get sent to prison yourself? Trust me, Nash, she's not worth it.",
        "Jessica: Nash, don't!",
        "Nash: Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lewis: Lindsay, let's take a moment and think about this, ok? Sit down.",
        "Will: Mom -- Mom, I don't understand. Doing this? What are you doing?",
        "Roxy: What the hell is going on here? Lindsay's supposed to be innocent, and I got a stack of t-shirts that says that she is.",
        "Rex: You're worried about your bottom line?",
        "Roxy: Well, listen, I'm always concerned about my weight, but I'm really worried about Lindsay. Why'd she have to kill Dr. Devil? What'd he ever do to her?",
        "Marcie: Something's wrong, Mike.",
        "Michael: Marcie, don't.",
        "Marcie: No, Mike, look -- she was supposed to plead not guilty. Why would she change her plea?",
        "Will: This your idea, Nora? Huh? You convince her to take a plea?",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: Order!",
        "Cristian: Will --",
        "Judge: Sit down, sir!",
        "Will: Did you?",
        "Judge: Sit down!",
        "Lewis: Lindsay, listen to me. The only -- listen. The only chance you have is to enter a plea of not guilty. I know this is frightening, but we have a case, and it's no time to give up now.",
        "Judge: If I might interject --",
        "Lewis: I'm sorry, your honor, I just need a moment with my client.",
        "Judge: The horse has already left the barn, Counselor. Let's clear this up right here and now. Ms. Rappaport, are you aware of the consequences of entering a guilty plea at this time?",
        "Lindsay: Yes, your honor.",
        "Lewis: Your honor, I must insist to have a moment with my client.",
        "Will: Mom -- Mom, don't do this.",
        "Lindsay: I'm sorry, honey. I couldn't let Marcie lose Tommy. He's everything to her, like you are to me.",
        "Judge: Ms. Rappaport --",
        "Lindsay: I killed Spencer Truman, your honor, and I would do it again.",
        "Lewis: Your honor --",
        "Judge: Ms. Rappaport, I must caution you, anything you say here can be used against you.",
        "Lindsay: It doesn't matter about me. It's about Tommy and Michael and Marcie. That's why I picked up the scissors. That's why I stabbed Spencer.",
        "Lewis: Your honor, my client is obviously confused. If she did, in fact, stab Spencer Truman, it was in defense of Blair Cramer, who was about to be raped, possibly murdered. In which case, Dr. Truman's death, while unfortunate, was justified.",
        "Nora: Your honor, this is an arraignment --",
        "Lewis: And my client is not guilty --",
        "Nora: Not a summation.",
        "Judge: And I'll entertain a plea, Mr. Cody, not an argument.",
        "Lindsay: But I wasn't defending Blair. I killed s to keep him from talking.",
        "Woman: What?",
        "[Gallery murmurs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I know what this is. This is a Tea Delgado.",
        "Todd: I beg your pardon?",
        "Blair: When you were trying to get custody of Starr, and you paid that -- Tea Delgado $5 million to make you look less like a self-centered punk, and more like a parent.",
        "Todd: Well, it worked like a charm, though, didn't it? I won.",
        "Blair: And that is why I will never marry you. That gloating face of yours.",
        "Todd: Not now. Hey --",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: That was the old Todd. He had a different face. The new Todd -- the new- and-improved Todd doesn't gloat, wouldn't think of gloating.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: The new Todd is all about humility and gratitude.",
        "Blair: Oh, humility? From you?",
        "Todd: All right, gratitude. But listen, this is a -- no, hey, look. No, really, this is a slam dunk. Because, A, we've been married before, we know how to do it. B, we got a built-in family. So the judge sees us, he's going to love us.",
        "Blair: \"Love us, love us\"? I mean, that's a brilliant, interesting choice of words there, Todd -- he'll \"love us.\"",
        "Todd: Well, I don't care how he really feels, as long as he gives me my son back. And with you on my side, it's a -- it's a --",
        "Blair: I have not agreed to do this, thank you.",
        "Todd: But you said you'd help me, didn't you? And this is what I need.",
        "Blair: Yeah? Well, what's in it for me?",
        "Todd: Well, the satisfaction of knowing that you did a good deed, and -- and the satisfaction of knowing that you made me happy.",
        "Blair: Hmm -- see, now, I was thinking more along the lines of dollars and cents.",
        "Todd: You want me to pay you?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. You paid Tea 5 million for Starr -- I think little Tommy's probably worth at least that much, don't you think?",
        "Todd: I'm not going to pay you to marry me! What do you think I am?",
        "Blair: I think you're desperate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Stop it, stop it!",
        "Mac: Break it up! Break it up!",
        "Natalie: Hit him, Nash!",
        "Mac: Get out of here, both of you!",
        "Natalie: Don't think that I won't. It's all right, Mac. I can handle these two.",
        "Mac: Not tonight, Natty. You guys get out of here before I call the cops.",
        "Natalie: You heard Mac.",
        "Mac: Come on.",
        "Nash: Oh --",
        "[Nash chuckles]",
        "Jessica: Nash -- no, no, no, no, no! Wait! Leave him alone.",
        "Nash: Butt out, Jessica. This is between him and I.",
        "Jared: Yeah, you want some more? Come on!",
        "Natalie: Ok, do you think that Jessica's kidding? This is a cop bar! Ok? He's got L.P.D. on speed dial.",
        "Jessica: What's going on?",
        "Nash: What's going on? This guy has a picture of you on his phone. He says that you -- well, that Tess put him in prison.",
        "Jared: You want to tell him, baby, or should I?",
        "Jessica: Ok, it's -- it's ok, it's ok!",
        "Natalie: Nash!",
        "Jessica: It's ok!",
        "Nash: Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. It's not ok. Everything. The poker game, the vineyard, the job at B.E. -- it's all about you. This guy's obsessed with you.",
        "Natalie: Ok, why don we just call it a night?",
        "Jared: Oh, and miss the heartbreaking confession scene?",
        "Jessica: Shut up. Listen, we'll just talk about this at home, ok?",
        "Jared: Word of warning -- your wife's got a major tell -- if she gets naked, she's lying.",
        "Natalie: How dare you!",
        "Jessica: It's ok, Natalie.",
        "Nash: Is it true?",
        "Jessica: I tried to tell you.",
        "Nash: Tried to tell me when? He \"knew\" Tess?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So you want me to marry you? Turn my life upside down? Turn the lives of our children upside down? All for nothing, when the going rate for something like this is $5 million?",
        "Todd: There's no going rate for something like this.",
        "Blair: Going, going, gone.",
        "Todd: Oh, come on. Why don't you look at it like it's a favor?",
        "Blair: A favor? A favor is an mp3 player in a goody bag, Todd. This is a marriage. This is a hardship, and we're terrible at it. You know that. I know it, and the kids know it, and there's no reason to go down that road again. It's not fair to anybody.",
        "Todd: But this isn't a real marriage.",
        "Blair: It doesn't matter. We're terrible at it. We're not even fake-married now and we're fighting. Why don't you think about our kids? I mean, Starr might be able to wrap her head around it, but Jack -- he wouldn't. He's going to think we're getting back together for real.",
        "Todd: Well, I'll talk to Jack.",
        "Blair: No, you won't talk to Jack.",
        "Todd: Well, you know what?",
        "Blair: Hmm?",
        "Todd: If you don't marry me, I may never get to talk to him again.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on.",
        "Todd: No, listen. If that judge rules I'm an unfit father, I might lose him, I might lose Starr. Is that what you want?",
        "Blair: That's not going to happen, Todd, because I'm never going to keep you from your kids, ok?",
        "Todd: Oh, but that's not up to you. Listen, just marry me. Please, please, please.",
        "Blair: Oh, don't do this.",
        "Todd: Yes, please. Blair, look, just marry me. It'll solve all our problems.",

        "Lindsay: I stabbed Spencer Truman because --",
        "Will: Mom, stop. Don't say --",
        "Marcie: Lindsay, shut up!",
        "Lewis: Let me do my job.",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: Order, order! Another outburst, and I'll clear this courtroom. Now everybody, just sit down. Ms. Rappaport, I'll ask you again. How do you plead?",
        "Lindsay: Guilty, your honor.",
        "[Gasps]",
        "Nora: Your honor, the people request a recess so that we can determine how to proceed.",
        "Lindsay: I don't want a recess, I want to tell the truth. I need to tell the truth, now, all of it! Please, your honor.",
        "Judge: You do realize that everything you say here would become part of the legal record?",
        "Lindsay: Yes. Yes, I understand.",
        "Judge: All right. But in the interest of justice and brevity, I'll ask the questions. You said that you killed dr. Truman to keep him from talking. About what?",
        "Lindsay: He knew something. Something that could hurt a lot of people.",
        "Judge: Could you be more specific?",
        "Michael: If Todd finds out that Tommy is his son, we will lose him.",
        "Rex: How's he going to find out? As long as we keep quiet?",
        "Michael: Spencer knows. You think he's going to keep quiet?",
        "Lindsay: Spencer knew that Tommy -- the little boy that Michael and Marcie McBain adopted -- he knew that Todd Manning was his biological father.",
        "[Gallery murmurs]",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: Order, order. That's a matter for family court. This court is only concerned about matters that pertain to Dr. Truman's death.",
        "Lindsay: But that's why I killed him. Because he -- he had information that was going to destroy Michael and Marcie.",
        "Judge: And how did you happen to find out that Dr. Truman knew this secret, Ms. Rappaport?",
        "Michael: Spencer knows about Tommy.",
        "Rex: But as long as he doesn't say anything, no one will ever know.",
        "Michael: It'll break her heart, Rex. If Marcie loses Tommy, it will break her heart.",
        "Lindsay: I heard some people. They were talking about how Spencer knew about Tommy, so I decided that I would go to Spencer and beg him not to say anything. But he laughed in my face. And he said that he was going to tell and that he was going to wait for the worst possible moment so that he could cause the most pain. Don't you see? I had no choice. I had to kill him.",
        "[Gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd, before you panic yourself into marrying me, why don't you just wait and see what the judge has to say, ok?",
        "Todd: Oh, no, no, no, it has to be before the next court appearance because it has to look -- as you say, it has to look real. And the judge has to think that you coming to my corner has -- has -- has rekindled the -- you know, the kindling.",
        "Blair: And you just burst into flames?",
        "Todd: It could happen. I mean, not to us, but -- but to people.",
        "Blair: Oh. , Todd, say, um, I agree to this completely ridiculous idea. We get married, but you lose custody. Then what happens?",
        "Todd: Get an annulment.",
        "Blair: Ok. And what if it works?",
        "Todd: Then I was right, as usual.",
        "Blair: And then what?",
        "Todd: I -- I guess we have to continue to pretend.",
        "Blair: For how long?",
        "Todd: Hmm. Well, let's see -- my boy's 2 now, so -- 16 years? And if the McBains want custody when he's 18, they can pay for college.",
        "Blair: You want me to pretend to be married to you for 16 years? Are you out of your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: So the little lady comes clean.",
        "Natalie: Hey!",
        "Nash: You disrespect my wife one more time --",
        "Jessica: It's ok, it's ok, it's ok.",
        "Nash: No, it's not ok! All right? Whatever happened doesn't give him a right to talk to you like that. You understand that?",
        "Jared: Whatever you say,",
        "Nash: Oh, God -- why didn't you tell me about this before?",
        "Jessica: I didn't expect to come home from London and find out that Jared Banks was your business partner. I mean, I turn around and he's standing in our living room. I didn't know what was going on. I -- I didn't know why he was here, I didn't know what he wanted.",
        "Jared: You knew exactly what I wanted!",
        "Nash: Shut up. When did you meet him?",
        "Jessica: I -- Tess met him, before she met you. She was in Atlantic City, and Jared was tending bar at a casino.",
        "Jared: Whew. Whoa.",
        "Tess: Hey, tight pants.",
        "Jared: [As Travis Bickle] What, you talking to me?",
        "Tess: Why, you worth talking to?",
        "Jared: [Normal voice] What can I get you?",
        "Tess: Something dirty.",
        "Jared: Uh-huh.",
        "Jessica: I was drinking a lot those days. I wasn't myself.",
        "Nash: Really? So what happened then?",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: So are they dirty enough for you?",
        "Tess: Never. Hmm.",
        "Jared: You want another, or are you ready to cash this in?",
        "Tess: Do I look like the type of girl who cashes it in?",
        "Jared: I don't know. We just met.",
        "Tess: Well, I'm just a girl next door. You know, sweet, honest, and true.",
        "Jared: Uh-huh. Yeah, right.",
        "Tess: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jared: So what's it going to be?",
        "Tess: Hit me again, bad boy.",
        "Nash: Did he use the key?",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Mike? She shouldn't have said anything.",
        "Michael: Maybe she just couldn't live with herself anymore.",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: Ms. Rappaport, would you like to continue? We can adjourn and take this up at another time.",
        "Lewis: Your honor, I'd like to call Ms. Rappaport's physician.",
        "Lindsay: No! That's not necessary. I'm fine. I would like to continue, please, Judge Shriver.",
        "Judge: All right. Now, you told us why you thought it was necessary to take Dr. Truman's life, that you were trying to prevent the loss of custody that you assumed would result from the disclosure of the child's parentage.",
        "Lindsay: No, that's not it. And, I -- I don't want Marcie and Michael to lose Tommy, but this is not about custody. It's -- do you have children?",
        "Judge: Ms. Rappaport, if you could stay on point --",
        "Lindsay: But that is the point. Our children are so precious to us. I had a daughter who was taken from me. She was murdered by a bitter man who was trying to hide his secrets.",
        "Judge: Ms. Rappaport, the point?",
        "Lindsay: Yes, the point -- he's such a wonderful little boy. They're such wonderful parents. He's so good and confident, happy. And he had such a rough start. And I'm afraid -- I'm afraid if he's taken away from them, that he's never going to recover. So you see, like I said before, I went to Spencer and I asked him to keep the secret. Spencer was still in the hospital.",
        "Ofc. Prescott: Ms. Rappaport is here to see you.",
        "Spencer: By all means, show her in.",
        "Ofc. Prescott: Ma'am.",
        "Spencer: You know, I don't think Ms. Rappaport means me any harm. Do you, Lindsay?",
        "[Spencer sighs]",
        "Spencer: So, now that we're alone, to what do I owe the pleasure? A little art therapy, perhaps? Finger painting? What -- what do you got in mind, Lindsay?",
        "Lindsay: He was crazy like a fox. I have a question for you.",
        "Spencer: Fire away.",
        "Lindsay: What are you going to do about Tommy McBain?",
        "Spencer: So you know about little Tommy, do you? Well, you better not let it get out. I don't think Marcie would ever get over it. Losing a son. You know, Tommy, all of that boundless enthusiasm. You know Todd would make short work of him, don't you?",
        "Lindsay: I told him everything, how Marcie couldn't have any more children of her own, and how much they loved him. I begged him not to tell. Please, Spencer, nobody has to know. Todd already has two kids. Let Michael and Marcie keep Tommy.",
        "Spencer: It hurts -- losing a child, doesn't it?",
        "Lindsay: More than anything. But you can keep that from happening. All you have to do is forget what you know. Do something good for someone else.",
        "Spencer: I -- I want to help you, Lindsay, I -- I really do. But the thing is, Todd Manning and John McBain have everybody talking about putting me in the nut house! So if I don't get to have a happy ending, they don't, either.",
        "Lindsay: We are talking about an innocent little boy here!",
        "Spencer: Todd's son, innocent? Listen, I'm no geneticist, but I do know this much -- mix one part Todd Manning, one part Margaret Cochran, and what do you have? A nasty little creature.",
        "Lindsay: Not if Tommy and Marcie raise him.",
        "Spencer: You know, the old nature-versus-nurture argument, Lindsay. Todd's genes trumped by Marcie's home cooking? Can't wait to see what happens to the little brat when we throw him into Todd's orbit.",

        "Spencer: Full sentences like, \"Mommy, don't let them take me, Mommy.\" \"Daddy -- Daddy, I want to stay with you, Daddy. Please, Daddy, don't let him take me. Don't let him take me, Daddy. Mommy, Mommy, no! No, Mommy.\"",
        "Lindsay: He wanted to hurt everyone -- Michael, Marcie, Tommy, and Todd. I couldn't let that happen. It was up to me. I had to shut that bastard up before he destroyed everyone that I loved.",

        "Natalie: Well, no matter what Tess did when she was in control, it's water under the bridge. Jessica's not that person anymore.",
        "Jared: I don't care what she calls herself. The truth is out -- I was there.",
        "Nash: And you were there with someone who doesn't exist anymore. So what happened next? Just tell me.",

        "Todd: It wasn't that bad.",
        "Blair: The only part that wasn't \"that bad\" is something that now you say is off-limits. This is a charade, Todd. We have to move in together, go out on dates, smile.",

That's why I kept the dress -- so that if you arrested anyone else, I would've been able to prove that it was me. I am guilty. I did it. I killed Spencer Truman. I went into the hospital room. The curtains around her bed were drawn. I saw the scissors on the floor. And I picked them up, but I don't know why. And then I heard something coming from behind the curtain. So I opened them.",

        "Jessica: I went down to the bar to get a drink and there was a phone, a house phone.",
        "Tess: Security? I just thought I'd give you a heads-up. If you get any calls from guests missing wallets or watches in the last hour or so, I just thought that you should call the guy in room 1345.",
        "Jared: That phone call ruined my life. I lost my job, my car -- everything. I spent two years in prison, two years because of you!",
        "Nash: Ok. Tess did what she did and there is no excuse for that. But what you're doing -- coming in the back door like this -- vineyard -- why couldn't you just have come to us and talked to us and tried to work this thing out?",
