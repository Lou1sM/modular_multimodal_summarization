        "Daren, Destiny and Daren all sign up for Driver's Ed. But only Daren shows up to find a very odd and boring instructor. Nate shows Dani how to drive his car. Destiny is ready to drive although she is late when she goes to find Greg after following him to the place where he's secretly keeping Tea. She still does not know that Tea is alive nor does anybody else except Greg. But she tells her brother by lying to Dani and Todd when Tea wanted to see them before she died. Todd is determined to not let Ross take Dani away from him and back to Tahiti. He discusses it with Kelly who tells him he needs to reach out to his daughter. He sees that Kelly is trying to find David Vickers and asks her why. After Clint has gotten the Dean to take Gigi's grant away form her, right when she is very encouraged about school for the first time and offers to give Rex enough money to afford everything they both need if Rex does not tell Kelly what he knows that Clint did to David, Rex knows he better lie to Kelly. So he tells her that David has chosen to leave Dorian and it's impossible to persuade him to come back. Clint wants to pull strings so that James can get the grant money in order to win points with Inez. But James and Robert are happy that their mother has helped James get into school when it's the only way he can afford it. But since Rex has agreed to Clint's \"terms\", we wonder if Clint is going to have to choose between enabling Gigi or James to get the grant money."

        "Stein: What time do you have?",
        "Darren: 9:06.",
        "Stein: First period officially begins at 9:05. Ahem. Good morning, and welcome to first period driver education. My name is Mr. Stein. For those of you lucky enough to be enrolled in my group, taking the wheel fills you with excitement. Others of you--",
        "Darren: What others? Do you see any others?",
        "Stein: Others of you will be filled with dread, but at the end of this course, you will master what I like to call the 3 C's--calm, confidence, and courtesy --on the open road and on the road of life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Hey.",
        "Ford: What?",
        "James: That's my piece of bacon.",
        "Ford: James, this is our last breakfast out for the foreseeable future. You want to not ruin it?",
        "James: Uh, you want to not cheat me out of my piece of bacon?",
        "Ford: Fine.",
        "James: No. The whole thing.",
        "Ford: Look, I need my strength. I got to go find a job to replace the one that I lost.",
        "James: You didn't lose it. It was stolen. Whoever took those pictures of you and Langston better have the guts to admit it.",
        "Ford: What's done is done.",
        "James: Man, how can you say that? You seriously don't want to know who ratted you out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stein: On the road of life, you will encounter many challenges, and most of those challenges must be driven to. Learning to operate a vehicle is essential, not just for you, but for the butcher, baker, doctor, lawyer, and even the lowly artist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: No, no, don't interrupt her meeting. I just-- it's not important. Just tell her I called to say hi. Thanks.",
        "Gigi: Let me guess. Layla's rocking Paris.",
        "Cristian: Sounds like it. Just like you rocked my class yesterday. Thought you might like this--\"use of the perspective.\" It might give you some foundation.",
        "Gigi: I--I can't take that, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: It's just a loaner. I got it from the library.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, I won't be needing it. I'm dropping out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stein: So...As you can see, there's hardly a person alive who does not require automotive skills. Well, except for the privileged, of course, who can pay to be driven wherever they need to go. The Buchanans, for example. Money buys power, as they say, and power buys everything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Ha!",
        "Rex: Calm down, okay?",
        "Kelly: I've been leaving you messages since last night, Rex. You were supposed to let me know what you found in Clint's office.",
        "Rex: Sorry. I got tied up.",
        "Kelly: Okay, are we any closer to knowing where David is?",
        "Rex: I'll get you some answers today, okay? I promise. I got to go.",
        "Kelly: Huh.",
        "Rex: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Clint: About what?",
        "Rex: The grant Gigi got from L.U. -- You're the one who made it disappear?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stein: Let's find out who you are. When I call your name, please answer \"here.\" Evans, Destiny. Evans?",
        "Darren: Destiny's a girl's name...a beautiful, amazing, incredible girl.",
        "Stein: Incredibly late, I might add. I hope she doesn't make a habit of it.",
        "Darren: Not usually. She wasn't on the bus today. Sometimes she gets a ride from her brother Greg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: I hate keeping you here, T\u00e9a, away from the people that you love. Ahh. But we can't let Elijah Clarke find out that you're alive. As soon as I take care of that son of a bitch, I'm gonna get you back to your family. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stein: Price, Darren.",
        "Darren: Finally. Here.",
        "Stein: Rayburn, Danielle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Well, why does the judge have to make us wait so long? Yeah, hopefully by the end of the day. That'd be fun. I miss surfing, too. He's right here. I know. Me, too.",
        "Todd: \"You, too,\" what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stein: If it's just the two of us, we may as well get started.",
        "Darren: Look, can't we give Destiny another minute, please? Look, I know she's jazzed about starting driver's ed.",
        "Stein: On the other hand, if she's not present, one has to wonder whether she's jazzed about something else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: The nurse will be in to check on you soon, okay? And I'll be back later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I mean, this is America. You should be able to face your accusers or whatever. You need to fight for your rights here, man.",
        "Ford: Could this day get any better?",
        "James: What? Oh, hey.",
        "Inez: How are you, James?",
        "James: I'm okay.",
        "Inez: Bobby, I heard what happened at the university.",
        "Ford: Thanks.",
        "Inez: I'm sorry. I wish that there was something I could do.",
        "Ford: I will handle it.",
        "James: Bobby will get a new job.",
        "Inez: And what about you? I don't want you giving up on going to school.",
        "James: Yeah. I was gonna apply for that grant, but it was too late, so I guess school's gonna have to wait till I can afford it.",
        "Inez: So what if you could afford it right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I thought you were really enjoying this class?",
        "Gigi: I was.",
        "Cristian: Then why are you dropping it?",
        "Gigi: Not just yours; all of them.",
        "Cristian: Why?",
        "Gigi: I had a grant, but I lost it, and there's just no way I can swing the tuition.",
        "Cristian: You lost your grant? Well, how did that happen?",
        "Gigi: I wish I knew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm awfully glad it's you. The way that door opened, I thought I was being raided by L.P.D.",
        "Rex: Maybe you should be.",
        "Clint: That wouldn't be a threat now, would it?",
        "Rex: One phone call to Bo where he finds out his son is in a Moroccan jail, you'd be in handcuffs.",
        "Clint: Ah. You know what I think? I think if you were gonna go tattle to my little brother, you would have done it by now. This is not about Vickers. This is about Gigi.",
        "Rex: How'd you get the grant taken away from her?",
        "Clint: Hell, you took that grant away, not me. Who knows? Maybe they found someone more deserving.",
        "Rex: I don't think so.",
        "Clint: Or maybe someone who donated a few buildings advised the selection committee that an error had been made.",
        "Rex: Oh, is that how you played it?",
        "Clint: Of course, someone with that amount of power could just as easily have the grant restored...under the right circumstances.",
        "Rex: What are the right circumstances?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What did Ross say?",
        "Dani: Nothing.",
        "Todd: What, is this more garbage about you guys living happily ever after on matching surfboards?",
        "Dani: You're not making this any easier. Nate.",
        "Nate: Hey. Uh, I don't mean to interrupt.",
        "Dani: On, no, no. You're not interrupting. Um, we should probably get to school.",
        "Todd: What's the rush to get to school? Sit down. You, too, man. Yeah. So we should really get to know each other, don't you think? I mean, seeing as how she feels so strongly about you. I saved your life.",
        "Dani: And Nate appreciates that, but we really do need to get to school.",
        "Nate: Yeah. Driver's Ed starts today.",
        "Todd: Oh, really? Driver's-- are you guys old enough for that already? 16? Wow. God, you're lucky because if you were living in Tahiti, you'd have to wait another two years, right?",
        "Dani: You can't get your license till you're 18 there.",
        "Todd: But you guys are ready now, obviously. You know, I can tell you're smart and you're responsible. Yeah. And who knows, maybe you'll get your own car pretty soon.",
        "Dani: I'm gonna go get another refill. Be right back.",
        "Todd: Hey... so you know about this character Ross, right?",
        "Nate: Yeah. He wants to take Dani back to Tahiti?",
        "Todd: Yes. And away from everyone who she holds dear. Now, look, can we let that happen? No. Now, here's what I want you to do. If Ross ever shows up at any time, give me a call. Okay? And certainly under no circumstances leave her alone with him. You understand?",
        "Dani: Um, you know what? We're really late. We probably should get to school, okay? Ready?",
        "Nate: Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.",
        "Dani: Okay. See you later.",
        "Todd: Count on it. Drive safely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Des, what are you doing here?",
        "Destiny: What's your problem?",
        "Greg: How did you get here?",
        "Destiny: There are these things called cabs.",
        "Greg: Today's a school day. Shouldn't you be in class?",
        "Destiny: And shouldn't you be at the hospital?",
        "Greg: I'm consulting on a case. My patient is inside, but that doesn't explain what you're doing here.",
        "Destiny: I followed you.",
        "Greg: Why?",
        "Destiny: I need to talk to you about T\u00e9a Delgado. I know what you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: David Vickers Buchanan. Last know whereabouts...",
        "Todd: Doing a story on David Vickers?",
        "Kelly: Look, he is the first in a series. \"The new jilters.\"",
        "Todd: \"Jilters?\" What are you, Jane Austen? People don't get jilted anymore, Kelly, they get dumped. Besides, what Vickers did is not new, at least not for him. So what is this?",
        "Kelly: I hired someone to track him down, to get Dorian some closure.",
        "Todd: Excuse me. You want closure? There you go, closed. I got to say, um, maybe you could start spending more time at the office doing something more traditional--like work.",
        "Kelly: OH. Well, you're in rare form today. Did you get a decision from the judge about Dani?",
        "Todd: No, not yet.",
        "Kelly: Well, no news is good news, right? The longer the judge takes, the more likely--",
        "Todd: Save your breath. Save it. There's only two things that would make me feel better right now...And one of them can't stand me and the other one's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: What? What is it you think I did to T\u00e9a?",
        "Destiny: Not to her. To Dani and her dad. You lied to them, Greg. How could you not tell them that T\u00e9a wanted them there before she died?",
        "Greg: I did tell them.",
        "Destiny: Not when it counted.",
        "Greg: Look, by the time Todd and Dani got there, T\u00e9a was already gone. It was a big enough blow as it was. I didn't want to add to it.",
        "Destiny: That's crazy. It would have helped them to know that she wanted them there.",
        "Greg: It was a judgment call, Des. If I had a chance to do it over--",
        "Destiny: Yeah, well, there's no do-overs when someone dies.",
        "Greg: You're right. Well, there's a lot of things I wish I could do differently, that I wish I could change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I knew it. Class started without me!",
        "Nate: It might not be a bad thing.",
        "Dani: And why is that?",
        "Nate: Well, you said you had Mr. Stein, right?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Nate: Do you know what they call this guy? \"End of the line\" Stein. He's like the bottom of the barrel as far as instructors go. The guy loves nothing more than to hear the sound of his own voice.",
        "Dani: I just want to get my license. I don't care who my teacher is.",
        "Nate: Well, then, you're in luck, 'cause the Nathaniel Q. Salinger world- famous driving academy is holding its first session today. Hop in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You don't understand. I don't have a job. Bobby doesn't have a job, and we can hardly afford to pay for this breakfast as it is, let alone a college tuition.",
        "Inez: Okay, what if you had another chance at that grant?",
        "Ford: That's not how it works.",
        "Inez: Maybe it is this time thanks to a friend of mine.",
        "James: What friend?",
        "Inez: Well, I mentioned your situation to my boss' brother.",
        "Ford: Clint Buchanan?",
        "Inez: Yes. He knows the dean, and it turns out that this grant fell through with someone else, so it's still available.",
        "James: You're kidding?",
        "Inez: No. And Clint put in a good word for you,",
        "Ford: How did you manage that? Did it involve sleeping with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Who offers somebody a grant and then just takes it away without even an explanation?",
        "Gigi: Something about a technical problem. Supposedly, the grant was meant for someone else, and the system spit out my name by mistake.",
        "Cristian: Then they should try to do something else for you. I don't know, a loan, some kind of financial aid package.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I, uh, I got all that I could, and I was still stretched. The grant was the best option, and it didn't work out.",
        "Cristian: Because of a computer error. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't sound right to me.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I know. If I didn't know any better, I'd think that someone just didn't want me there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, I need to be really clear on this. Are you saying you could fix things for Gigi?",
        "Clint: I can do anything I set my mind to, even having you busted for breaking and entering.",
        "Rex: You know, I think if you're gonna do that, you'd have done it by now.",
        "Clint: Statesville may have better accommodations than our good friend David is enjoying at the moment, but still it's not a picnic, not when you're doing a 10-year sentence, and that's pretty much the standard for trying to steal corporate secrets. I would hate to see Shane without his daddy for all that time, and then there's poor Gigi alone again.",
        "Rex: You've made your point.",
        "Clint: Of course, if you don't care about your future or Gigi's...",
        "Rex: Well, what do you care about, Clint, besides what's best for Clint?",
        "Clint: There's nothing wrong with looking out for number one. There was a time, young man, when you understood that. Do you remember when you found my pa?",
        "Clint: [Laughs] In a hole in the woods? And you offered to fish him out for a price. Oh, God, Asa loved that. He respected that, and he wanted you to come work for him.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I didn't take him up on it.",
        "Clint: Bad, bad move. And now the question is, have you learned your lesson or are you about to make another bad move?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You're a jackass. She's trying to help me.",
        "Ford: I just want to know where the help is coming from. I mean, that's a fair question. How many billionaires are going to go out on a limb for a kid they don't even know?",
        "Inez: I didn't even ask Clint to do it.",
        "Ford: And now he's the answer to your prayers? Why? What kind of a deal did you make?",
        "Inez: There was no deal.",
        "James: Exactly, Bobby. Not everybody's like you. Some people do stuff without expecting to get sex in return.",
        "Ford: What the hell does that mean?",
        "Inez: It's not even worth arguing about. James, you have to call the financial aid office. They're expecting to hear from you.",
        "James: OH. Okay. Well, thank you. I'll call them right now.",
        "Inez: Okay.",
        "James: She's gonna be safe if I leave her here alone with you, right?",
        "Ford: Go.",
        "Inez: You look out for your brother. That's good.",
        "Ford: I didn't do it for your approval.",
        "Inez: Well, I know that. And you're suspicious of me, and there's no mystery why. But I'm hoping that maybe someday I can change that.",
        "Ford: By suddenly showing up and handing out favors? James and I don't need that. We have each other. We're good.",
        "Inez: It doesn't appear that way at the moment. I stepped in because I want James to succeed, and I just assumed that you want that, too.",
        "Ford: Of course.",
        "Inez: So please support him in getting this grant, because my friend can make it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dean Mackenzie, it's good to talk to you again. Yeah, I'm calling you because there's something I forgot to mention the other day. There is a student that I think would be a real asset to the L.U. community. She's very bright, and she is anxious to begin her academic career, but she just needs a little boost financially, if you know what I mean, and I was hoping that there could be some way where we-- yes. Well, Dean Mackenzie, that sounds ideal. Her name's Morasco. Gigi Morasco.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Okay, up if you want to go right...",
        "Dani: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nate: Down if you want to go left.",
        "Dani: Okay.",
        "Nate: Now try it.",
        "Dani: Oh, okay. Right and left. Okay. Turn signals. Got it. What's this? Oh. Duh. And what about this pedal? What is that used for?",
        "Nate: Oh, that's the gas. And you knew that already.",
        "Dani: I'm not a total idiot.",
        "Nate: Yeah. No, actually you seem pretty comfortable. Have you taken lessons before?",
        "Dani: Oh, not really. But when I was little, my dad would put me on his lap sometimes and let me steer his truck.",
        "Nate: Cool.",
        "Dani: Yeah, we used to take route 1 all the way around the island. You should have seen the weird looks we got, 'cause I guess some people thought that it was me who was actually driving, and then someone would call my mom, and that was the end of our fun and games.",
        "Dani: [Sighs] She always said that she'd teach me how to drive for real someday. Now I guess it's supposed to be my dad's job.",
        "Nate: Which dad--Ross or Todd?",
        "Dani: I guess that depends on the judge now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I know what it's to lose someone you love.",
        "Todd: Yeah, we're not talking about you, are we?",
        "Kelly: Well, you know what, Todd, the thing about grief is that it is--it's so big and it's so all-encompassing, sometimes it can keep you from thinking straight.",
        "Todd: Am I not thinking straight?",
        "Kelly: T\u00e9a left you. It wasn't her choice. But here you are, abandoned, and now you are afraid that Dani's gonna abandon you, too, so you invest her with these feelings that she doesn't really have--",
        "Todd: Did you get this from a shrink or something? 'Cause I hate shrinks. And I hate the way they talk. Don't you know that?",
        "Kelly: Okay, okay, I will put it in language that you can understand. You just said that Dani can't stand you, and that is completely ridiculous.",
        "Todd: Well, how the hell would you know? Have you ever spoken two words to her?",
        "Kelly: Well, I don't have to. I look at her actions, and you know what? She's hanging in. She's hanging in. I mean, she could have run off with Ross the minute he showed up, but she's still here, Todd, and that means something.",
        "Todd: Huh. It means she doesn't want to leave her boyfriend.",
        "Kelly: Come on. Look at what you two have been through. You both lost someone you love. I mean, that bonds people.",
        "Todd: Bonding? Before it was investing. What are you, the stock market? Jeez.",
        "Kelly: Okay, you want to give me the list of approved words?",
        "Todd: There's only one word I want to hear, and she seems to have no problem telling it to Ross, but not to me, man, not a chance.",
        "Kelly: Are we talking about love here?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Yeah, I think I heard her say it to Ross.",
        "Kelly: Telling him she loved him?",
        "Todd: Yeah. He said something on the phone, and she said, \"me, too,\" so...",
        "Kelly: Well, what about you?",
        "Todd: What about me what? What do you mean?",
        "Kelly: Have you told Dani you love her? Ever?",
        "Todd: No, I can't.",
        "Kelly: Maybe it's time.",
        "Todd: I can't.",
        "Kelly: Why not?",
        "Todd: 'Cause she might not say it back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Are you okay?",
        "Greg: Uh, sure. I, uh, I'm fine.",
        "Destiny: You don't seem fine.",
        "Greg: Well, I'm just concerned about this patient. I want her to do well.",
        "Destiny: The one in there?",
        "Greg: Yeah. Yeah. She's had a, um, she's had a rough time. You know, a lot of problems.",
        "Destiny: You'll fix them. You always do.",
        "Greg: Hmm. Not always, des.",
        "Destiny: You would have fixed Dani's mom if you could have. She was just too sick.",
        "Greg: I should get back to this patient, and you should get back to school. Here, take a cab.",

        "Greg: Ah, take it...And go. Destiny... I love you. I should say it more often. You can lose someone so fast, you know?",

        "Inez: There are no strings here.",
        "Ford: All right.",
        "Inez: Look, if James never speaks to me again after today, then I'm okay with that, I guess. But what I can't live with is if I have the power to do something to help him and I don't. I would help you, too, if I could. Bobby, I don't expect you to treat me like a mother, but that doesn't mean that I'm gonna stop being one.",
        "Ford: Hey, um...I hope this works out. It would be cool if James could go to school again.",
        "Inez: That's all I want.",
        "Ford: And I'm--what I said about you and Buchanan was out of line. Sorry.",

        "Gigi: Who was that?",
        "Cristian: The head of my department. He told me that I have an allowance in my fellowship for an assistant.",
        "Gigi: You didn't know that?",
        "Cristian: No idea. But get this. When the money people told him about it, they mentioned you specifically.",
        "Gigi: Me?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, as a candidate for the job. I guess they felt bad, you know, about what happened with the grant, and they want to try to do something, you know, to make up for it. Which is fine with me.",
        "Gigi: Are you--you want to hire me as your assistant?",
        "Cristian: Well, that's if you don't mind having me as a boss.",
        "Gigi: Are you kidding? Are you kidding? Oh, my God! This is--this is like a dream come true! Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Doctor, what happened?",
        "Greg: A significant spike in her heart rate and blood pressure. The numbers are back where they should be, but she did give me a scare.",
        "Nurse: Well, what do you think caused it?",
        "Greg: I'm not quite sure.",

        "Todd: God, is this your version of comfort? Because I got to tell you, I've had better than this.",
        "Kelly: Well, you know what? You see, if you want someone to admit they love you, they have to feel secure, and Dani is anything but right now. She's a teenager who just lost her mother, and she's in the middle of a custody fight, so she has to be scared to death. What's your excuse?",
        "Todd: For what?",
        "Kelly: See, you're the adult. You're supposed to have the courage to tell her how you feel.",
        "Todd: Okay, but let's say I do that, and the next thing you hear is a court order sending her back to Tahiti.",
        "Kelly: Well, then at least Dani knows that her father loves her and was not afraid to show her.",
        "Todd: Ah, man, you're crazy. I don't want to just say a few words and then wave good-bye. I want to do something about it.",
        "Kelly: Like what?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I'm working on it. I tried paying Ross off, and that didn't fly. Tried shooting him. Blair stepped in, and that didn't fly, either.",
        "Kelly: Well, it sounds to me like you're stuck, Todd. Face it, all you can do is wait for this ruling. What other choice do you have?",
        "Todd: Ah, there's always another choice. You just got to be willing to make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: You were right. I just got off the phone with the financial aid office, and they knew who I was and everything. I mean, they interviewed me for the grant right there on the phone.",
        "Inez: Oh, that's so great.",
        "Ford: Wait, wait. This was just an interview. They didn't give you the grant yet, did they?",
        "James: Well, no, no, but they did talk about the recommendations from Clint Buchanan, and they told me I was a perfect candidate for the grant. But I'm telling you, it's a lock, bro.",
        "Ford: But they didn't offer you the grant.",
        "James: Well, no, but they did say they'd be in touch, okay? I mean, they said that I needed to look in the mail because there was something to sign.",
        "Inez: Okay.",
        "James: What else could that mean, right?",
        "Ford: All right. Congratulations, bro. Good job!",
        "James: Thank you, thank you. But, man, you're telling it to the wrong person. You made this happen. Thank you so much.",
        "Inez: Oh, no, no, no. This-- seeing you get this chance, it's...I haven't been this happy in a really long, long time, so...",

        "Gigi: I'm going back to school.",
        "Rex: No way. They gave you back your grant?",
        "Gigi: No, but they recommended me for a job.",
        "Cristian: Gigi's gonna be my assistant.",
        "Rex: I didn't know you were hiring.",
        "Cristian: Neither did I until about a minute ago.",
        "Gigi: Isn't this insane? I lose the grant, and the next minute the perfect job falls right into my lap, all because of Cristian. So you know what? You two have a seat. Killer breakfast coming right up, on me.",
        "Rex: Uh, you know what? I would love it--I can't. I have to get over to the \"The Sun\" to see Kelly.",
        "Gigi: Oh. About the case? How's it going?",

        "Todd: Play your cards right, it just might be.",
        "Kelly: Oh, I love it when you're mysterious. Seriously, please tell me, where are you going?",
        "Todd: Well, we're out of paperclips.",
        "Kelly: Okay, whatever this is, it's desperation, and we have no time for stupid plans, Todd.",

        "Kelly: So Clint is not involved?",
        "Rex: David's disappearance has nothing to do with Clint and everything to do with Dorian. He wants to stay as far away from her as he can. And believe me, I tried every trick in the book, but I could not con this guy to come back to Llanview.",

James is gonna be able to stay in college. I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to thank you, but I promise you I will figure out a way.",
