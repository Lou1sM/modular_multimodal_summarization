        "In the courtroom, after hearing the testimony of both parties who want to adopt Langston, he rules in the favor of her uncle Ray Montez. Everybody is outraged including Langston. Dorian lashes out at the judge and threatens to ruin him. He then holds her in contempt, has her put in hand cuffs and tells her she will spend the night in jail. While Cristian is locked up in Ray's previous cell with his uniform and name plate, Ray's wife talks to him and they look like they might \"work out a deal\" to get him out of there if he helps her find her husband. Brody and Shane are still missing. Gigi and Rex notify Bo. He puts out and APB and Amber Alert. They find a fellow SEAL who served with Brody. And the guy informs them that he knows that Brody is dangerous and he is responsible for killing a child in Iraq. Hearing that, Rex and Gigi are horrified."

        "John: You ever seen him?",
        "Guard: Se\u00f1or, por favor, I cannot let you in no matter how many pictures you show me.",
        "John: Don't get defensive. I'm just asking you a question.",
        "Guard: Look, under no circumstances is anyone allowed inside without a pass or approval from the warden.",
        "John: How come she gets a free pass?",
        "Guard: If you looked like her --",
        "John: Yeah, good point. How about him? You ever seen him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You called my brother?",
        "Vanessa: No. Wait --",
        "Cristian: You said you were going to help me.",
        "Vanessa: I realize I cannot. Not until I find my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: It is the goal of this court to preserve families whenever possible. Therefore, my ruling is that Langston Wilde will hereby be placed in the custody of her uncle, Ray Montez.",
        "Markko: You can't do that!",
        "Dorian: You can't! I mean, up until just recently, he didn't even know she existed.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and Langston doesn't want to live with him. Didn't you hear her?",
        "Blair: You brought on this suit with -- without any notice here.",
        "Dorian: You don't even know what this man's real motives are.",
        "Starr: Right, and to make her live with a man that she doesn't even know?",
        "Blair: A teenage girl without any recourse?",
        "Dorian: A teenage girl! It's criminal, and I won't allow it!",
        "[Gasps]",
        "Blair: Dorian.",
        "Judge: I will remind you all that this is my courtroom. Everyone, sit down. Dr. Lord, sit down.",
        "Dorian: My --",
        "Judge: I'm not insensitive to the feelings aroused by this case. In fact, I'm -- I'm heartened that this foster placement was so successful.",
        "Dorian: It was not a placement. She has a family.",
        "Judge: I'm sure Ms. Wilde will always value your relationship, dr. Lord. But the law is clear. I have no choice but to award guardianship of Ms. Wilde --",
        "Dorian: She's a Cramer.",
        "Judge: To her uncle, Ray Montez.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Yes, Shane Morasco. He's believed to be in the company of a Navy veteran, last seen wearing his dress uniform. Yeah, the Navy's on it. Um, no, we're going to bring in the state police as soon as we're ready to go public with the Amber alert. All right. Thank you, George, I sure do appreciate it.",
        "Rex: Amber alert?",
        "Bo: Shane's under 18.",
        "Rex: It's only been a few hours.",
        "Gigi: So you obviously think that this is pretty bad, right? Because Brody's got a gun, and he's apparently not in his right mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: What happens now, Dad?",
        "Shane: Let me see --",
        "Brody: What the hell do you think you're doing, Shane?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Listen, I'm not looking for full access. I'm just a cop on a case, and I'm looking for this guy. His name is Cris Vega.",
        "Guard: Any question about a prisoner --",
        "John: So he's a prisoner here?",
        "Guard: You'll have to talk to the warden.",
        "John: He doesn't return my calls.",
        "Guard: He's a busy man.",
        "John: I call the embassy, you know what's going to happen.",
        "Guard: It's not my problem.",
        "John: I'll make it your problem because you know something, all right? Work with me here, and I promise you you won't go down with all the rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You want to find your husband? Get me out of here.",
        "Vanessa: I got to thinking. What's to stop you from just walking away?",
        "Cristian: You leave me in here, you have nothing. And I'm a dead man. You know, your husband managed to take off every player in this house. I don't get out of here soon, one of them is going to kill me.",
        "Vanessa: That's Ray, charming as ever.",
        "Cristian: Then call my brother!",
        "Vanessa: So he can call the FBI? They don't care about my husband.",
        "Cristian: I'm an American. They care about me.",
        "Vanessa: Do you know how many stupid Americans are rotting away in our prison? Nobody cares about you.",
        "Cristian: I am telling you, my brother will make --",
        "Vanessa: Is a fine man, I'm sure. But what happens when his friend at the FBI tells him that he can't help him? What, he goes to a senator, a reporter? Your picture ends up on the television? And then every crooked official in this country will put his hand out.",
        "Cristian: So that's it? I spend the rest of my life in this hellhole, and you go on your merry way?",
        "Vanessa: Now, did I say that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lawyer: Your Honor, Dr. Lord wishes to appeal your decision, and pending the appeal, we respectfully request you allow Langston to remain with her family.",
        "Judge: Counselor, I'm sure you are aware that as a foster parent, Dr. Lord lacks standing in this case.",
        "Dorian: What, I have no rights? And this murderer can waltz in here and abduct my child?",
        "Lawyer: Your Honor, we produced proof that Mr. Montez's conviction was overturned.",
        "Dorian: Oh, and who did he buy off?",
        "Judge: Dr. Lord, given your record and your actions in this court, I suggest you refrain from casting stones.",
        "Blair: Excuse me, Judge, may I say something here? I mean, you're willing to take this child out of a loving environment, an environment that Langston considers her home now and toss her over to a man that she just met last week?",
        "Judge: Case law supports returning the child to a blood relative.",
        "Starr: Oh, come on.",
        "Markko: How do you know this guy's who he says he is?",
        "Judge: I'm afraid my hands are tied. Ray Montez is awarded custody.",
        "Langston: Wait.",
        "Judge: Yes, Ms. Wilde?",
        "Langston: What -- what does all this mean for me, I mean? Do I have to live with my uncle now?",
        "Judge: Until you reach 18, yes.",
        "Ray: Langston, please. I promise you, it's hard to imagine right now, but you will come to love living in Colombia.",

        "Talia: Do you want, um -- do you want the television remote?",
        "Carlotta: No.",
        "Antonio: How -- how about I put on some music?",
        "Carlotta: No, no, no.",
        "Antonio: I spoke to John.",
        "Talia: I think he's already in Colombia.",
        "Carlotta: Colombia?",
        "Antonio: He's following up on a lead.",
        "Talia: He should be getting back to us really soon with probably good news, I'm sure.",
        "Carlotta: You two should be on the case, not just sitting around here with me.",
        "Antonio: No. What, and -- and miss my daughter's first soccer match? No way.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Layla: Hi.",
        "Antonio: Hey, ladies.",
        "Layla: Hey, how are you?",
        "Antonio: How are you? Come on in, come on in.",
        "Layla: Thanks.",
        "Antonio: What's all this?",
        "Layla: Food.",
        "Sarah: Well, ingredients.",
        "Layla: We were missing all that home cooking from the diner, so we decided to stop by and whip up some tostones and empanadas for everyone.",
        "Carlotta: Uh, tostones maybe. You guys know how to make empanadas?",
        "Layla: Well, we know how to read.",
        "Sarah: Oh, we bought a cookbook.",
        "Carlotta: And what kind of flour are you using for the dough?",
        "Layla: You know, dough flour.",
        "Carlotta: Dough flour? You have to use yucca flour.",
        "Sarah: So there is such a thing as yucca flour?",
        "Carlotta: Yeah. Mija, if you really want to make empanadas, I'll show you guys how, okay?",
        "Antonio: I -- I think I have some yucca flour in the cupboard.",
        "Carlotta: Demelo. Ah!",
        "Antonio: Thank you.",
        "Sarah: You're welcome.",
        "Carlotta: Come on. We need to have the yucca flour. We need manteca. And we need huevos, and we need serranos, and we need piniento and \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: All right, let's not get ahead of ourselves. All we know is that Brody picked up Shane from school.",
        "Gigi: Without permission, and he doesn't have his cell phone on.",
        "Rex: And he lied to his teacher about him having a dentist appointment.",
        "Bo: Could it be possible that a special event came up? Now, Lovett's wearing his dress uniform. It's not like he's trying to be inconspicuous.",
        "Rex: Okay, what I want to know is why did he go to the courthouse and then dodge a metal detector?",
        "Gigi: Because he has a gun, which I didn't even know he had.",
        "Bo: I believe that that gun could possibly be a gift that he was awarded from his unit in Iraq. I don't know why he'd be carrying it, but I'm sure when he saw the metal detector, he knew he had a problem.",
        "Gigi: So, do you think --",
        "Bo: I think that we should take all necessary precautions, but still hope for the best. Do you have a picture of Shane?",
        "Gigi: At home. I -- I got so scared, I ran out of the house without --",
        "Rex: I got one.",
        "Bo: All right, you two stay here. I'm going to get this out on the wire.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Dad, I'm sorry.",
        "Brody: You don't touch another man's gun.",
        "Shane: Okay, I didn't know.",
        "Brody: That's right, you don't know. You don't -- you don't know anything about guns and what they can do. A gun is a lethal weapon, Shane.",
        "Shane: I know.",
        "Brody: I'm talking here!",
        "Shane: Sorry.",
        "Brody: I -- I just don't want anything to happen to you. You're too important to me, you understand? Nothing can happen to you.",
        "Shane: I won't touch the gun.",
        "Brody: That's right. You won't.",
        "Brody: Not until you understand what it means. You have a gun, everything you do, every move you make, you've got to be focused and aware.",
        "[Distant gunfire]",
        "Brody: Or you're going to make a mistake. And somebody's going to get hurt.",
        "[Louder gunfire]",
        "[Gunfire stops]",
        "Brody: No, you're just a kid. You're way too young to die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: M-o-r-a-s-c-O. He's 10, right? He's 10 years old. All right, thank you very much. Okay, the local affiliates are going to go with the Amber alert on the next network break.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God, this is real.",
        "Bo: Okay, let's -- let's talk about where they can be. Now, Lovett's in his uniform. Could guys from his unit have a get-together?",
        "Gigi: No, nothing like that.",
        "Rex: Can we have people at the airport? Train station, yeah? Car rentals?",
        "Bo: Yes, yes.",
        "Rex: Bus depots --",
        "Bo: Everything. Now, what about Lovett's family? Does he have anybody living locally?",
        "Gigi: He has a sister named Nadine, but she doesn't live in the area. She lives somewhere in Michigan.",
        "Bo: Okay, I'll track her down.",
        "Rex: All right, what about his service records? Maybe he's got a buddy nearby.",
        "Bo: All right, I'll get to work on getting his records. Hey, Gigi, do you have any idea where Brody might like to just hang out?",
        "Gigi: No. If he wasn't working, he just wanted to be with Shane. He's taken my son, and I -- I have no idea where to start looking for them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Who said I had to die?",
        "Brody: I scared you?",
        "Shane: No.",
        "Brody: Yeah, I did. I'm sorry. It's -- it's just you need to respect the weapon or you're going to get hurt. And that can't happen. Not on my watch. Understood, sailor? It's a good thing you're not in the service. An attitude like that, you'd be cleaning latrines. Okay. Time for a lesson. Rule number one -- treat every gun as if it is loaded. Two -- never point your gun at anything you're not intending to shoot. Three -- keep your finger off that trigger. You should be able to see light through the trigger guard. You see it?",
        "Shane: Yeah.",
        "Brody: Four -- be sure of your target and what's beyond it. Because what if you're aiming at that tree over there, and you don't take the time to look around, and there's a person. You didn't know he was there.",
        "Shane: Dad?",
        "Brody: Be responsible. That's the bottom line.",
        "Shane: Did you ever shoot anybody?",
        "Brody: Most of the time, you're firing at muzzle flashes, shadows.",
        "Shane: Did you ever kill anybody?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: You can't make her leave the country!",
        "Cole: She's a citizen of the United States.",
        "Starr: Langston's home is here.",
        "Judge: Sit down, all of you. Actually, Ms. Wilde has dual citizenship.",
        "Blair: Are you serious? He can't do that, come on.",
        "Ray: Your Honor, may I speak? Up until two years ago, this young girl's home was with her parents. She was fortunate to be taken in by Dr. Lord. I will always be most grateful for the generosity. But just as Langston has adapted to the loss of her mother and father, and to being thrown into the world of these people, surely she will adapt to a new home with me in the country of her mother.",
        "Langston: Okay, I would really appreciate if everyone would stop talking about me like I'm not even here. This is my life.",
        "Blair: Yes, it is, and you should have a say in it, sweetheart.",
        "Dorian: And with all due respect, Your Honor, you'd be forcing her to move away from her community, her school, her friends --",
        "Ray: There will be benefits to this change, an adventure, much like the one her mother went on when she came to America.",
        "Dorian: You are making her move to another country? That's child trafficking!",
        "Lawyer: Your Honor, I object to Dr. Lord's characterization.",
        "Judge: As do I.",
        "Dorian: She's a citizen of the United States, and she should not be forced, even by a blood relative, to move away from the country she loves against her will.",
        "Ray: I did not come here to make a fire. Nor did I come here to settle down. I only came because of my niece. It has always been my intention. It remains my intention to return with her to Colombia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: I haven't seen them.",
        "John: Take another look.",
        "John: John McBain. So how about you stop jerking me around. I know these two men were here. I just want to know where they are now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: I won't contact your brother, but I will get you out of here -- my way -- if you promise to do something for me in return.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, so how did you and Adriana locate Brody?",
        "Layla: Adriana found his mother in Michigan. And Dorian and I went to talk to her, but we found his sister, Nadine, instead, and she told us where to look for him.",
        "Rex: Okay, any idea how I can contact the sister?",
        "Layla: Yeah, I have her address and phone number and email. I'll forward it to you. Everything okay?",
        "Rex: Yeah -- no, we're good. Thanks, Layla.",
        "Gigi: You do one wrong thing, and it just snowballs, like you and me.",
        "Rex: You and me were perfect. We are.",
        "Gigi: I'm talking about me not telling you about Shane or him about you. If I had just been honest from the start --",
        "Rex: Okay, we'll have a chance to tell him everything.",
        "Gigi: Will we?",
        "Rex: He's coming home, and then you and I are going to sit him down and tell him together.",
        "Bo: The Navy sealed Lovett's records.",
        "Gigi: Why would they do that?",
        "Rex: Because they got something to hide.",
        "Gigi: Like what? Will you stop looking at each other and talk to me, please?",
        "Bo: Gigi, I have no idea what's in those records. I just hope it's not the reason that he took your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: When you've been in the military, in a war, all kinds of things happen.",
        "Shane: You went in right after high school, right?",
        "Brody: I enlisted when I was 18. Went in the buds at 19. It takes a couple years to be full Seal. Then I shipped to Germany, and then Afghanistan.",
        "Shane: You were in Iraq, right?",
        "Brody: On my second tour.",
        "Shane: So you've done a lot of fighting?",
        "Brody: I saw my share of combat.",
        "Shane: So you must have killed someone.",
        "Brody: Uh, you know what the word \"cavalier\" means?",
        "Shane: Like Calvary?",
        "Brody: Yeah, in the old days, yeah, they were both soldiers who rode on horseback, but \"cavalier\" has another meaning. It's, uh, it's kind of an attitude. It's -- it's when you disrespect something or someone. You got to be real careful when you're talking about life and death.",
        "Shane: So don't be cavalier?",
        "Brody: Those are -- those are people you're talking about. When you've killed someone, that's a person who's died. And to answer your question, yes. I killed people. It's what I was trained to do. Only -- only the thing is -- they don't tell you every time you kill someone, you kill a little part of yourself, too.",
        "[Artillery shells]",
        "[Artillery shells stop]",
        "Brody: You don't find that out until it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carlotta: You see? You feel how spongy?",
        "Layla: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carlotta: That's the yucca.",
        "Layla: So, roomie, tell me why your boyfriend never taught you the finer points of Puerto Rican cuisine?",
        "Sarah: Uh --",
        "Carlotta: No, you don't have to defend yourself. No, it's not Sarah's fault. No, my Cristian is very secretive in the kitchen.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, but I thought you taught him everything he knows.",
        "Carlotta: Oh, I did. Um -- you see, after I taught him everything he knows, he improved upon it, my little cooker. As a matter of fact, do you want to know a little secret?",
        "Layla: Always.",
        "[Carlotta chuckles]",
        "Carlotta: My famous flan -- Cristian was the one who improved the recipe.",
        "Sarah: Get out of town.",
        "Carlotta: No, it's true.",
        "[Carlotta speaks Spanish]",
        "Carlotta: It is the truth. You know, when he started making it, he would add something, and for the longest time, he wouldn't tell me what it was.",
        "Sarah: So, what is it?",
        "Layla: Yes, what?",
        "Carlotta: Hmm, I think -- I think I'll let him tell you when my little cooker comes home.",
        "Talia: I should've listened to my father.",
        "Antonio: Carlo? What, are you kidding me?",
        "Talia: If I'd listened to him, all of his theories about revenge, all of his talks about ruthlessness -- I had the shot. I had the chance to put a bullet in his head more than once. And if I'd done that, if I'd acted like a Hesser, none of this would've happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: So you'll help me find my husband?",
        "Cristian: I swear.",
        "Vanessa: On the life of your mother.",
        "Cristian: I swear on the life of my mother, who is very, very dear to me, that I will help you find your husband.",
        "Cristian: You can trust me.",
        "Vanessa: I'm going to have to, aren't I?",

        "Warden: You're a long way from home, Detective.",
        "John: I know. I'm not here on official capacity, but that can change with one phone call.",
        "Warden: Oh, there's no need to trouble anyone. I've never seen the man you call \"Hesser.\"",
        "John: I have an eyewitness that says he saw you with this man, but I'm guessing you're going to say you never saw this guy, either.",
        "Warden: Never. And I would remember such an ugly face.",
        "John: Hmm, I'll bet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Layla's information on the sister checked out, but she's not at home.",
        "Rex: All right, can local P.D. send out a car?",
        "Bo: They're on it. Aw, Balsom, you got any military contacts?",
        "Rex: Yeah, you. You're the Green Beret.",
        "Bo: Afraid that doesn't impress the Navy. I even made a special appeal. No dice.",
        "Gigi: So, they have to be hiding something.",
        "Rex: And it may have nothing to do with Shane or any of this.",
        "Gigi: But you don't think so, do you?",
        "Bo: We're just speculating, Gigi. Nothing's for sure.",
        "Gigi: What about this picture we found? Brody's records may be sealed, but what about this guy?",
        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Bo: We can't get anything without cause, okay? The Navy's not going to give us information unless we have a reason.",
        "Rex: Okay, then why don't we find this guy and see what he knows?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: So even when you know the rules, you only pick up a firearm under strict supervision.",
        "Shane: Yes, Sir.",
        "Brody: So, what do you do if you come across a gun somewhere?",
        "Shane: Make sure the safety's on.",
        "Brody: Bang! You shot your foot off because there was a magazine still in the gun -- there was a round in the chamber or -- or the trigger was touch- sensitive or it went off when you dropped it.",
        "Shane: Yes, Sir.",
        "Brody: So what do you do if you come across a gun?",
        "Shane: Call someone.",
        "Brody: You call an adult, someone who knows what he's doing.",
        "Shane: You.",

        "John: Have you ever seen this man?",
        "Warden: You have to excuse me, Se\u00f1or. I have a prior appointment.",
        "John: I'll wait.",
        "Warden: Visiting hours are over.",
        "John: First thing tomorrow, then.",
        "Warden: Perhaps you didn't understand me. I haven't seen these men, and if you persist in harassing me, I'll have no choice but to lock you up. Do we understand each other?",
        "John: Gracias.",
        "Vanessa: De nada.",
        "Warden: Senora?",
        "Warden: I was told that a Senora Montez had something for me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Excuse me, Your Honor. May I speak?",
        "Judge: Dr. Lord.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: Your Honor, as reprehensible as it is to give custody of my daughter to a man she only met a few days ago, to allow him to take her out of the country is unconscionable.",
        "Judge: You are trying my patience, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: Do you want this on your conscience, to turn an innocent young woman over to a man who has spent the last two years in prison? And I don't care how he got his release because the Colombian prison system is notorious for its corruption. All I care about is what will happen to this innocent, young woman once she is left alone with that man.",
        "Dorian: I'm not a perfect parent, but I am, unlike Mr. Montez, a known commodity. I'm controlling. I'm overprotective. I am intrusive. My girls can enumerate for you my many faults and they often do, but they always know that I love them with all of my heart and soul. Langston used to have purple hair.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Did you know that? And she's a very, very talented writer. Did you know that? I know that he did not know that. And she's loyal. Oh, my goodness. My -- my -- my great-niece, Starr, she went through a -- a big crisis this year and I don't think she could have gotten through it without Langston. And the man seated over there is Langston's boyfriend, a young man who's more of a man at 17 than many men three times his age. And Langston is a survivor. She has triumphed over the loss of her parents and the loss of her home. And is this how you are going to reward her? By not listening to her when she tells you what she wants? By taking her away from everything and everybody that she loves? What kind of a lesson are you teaching if you ignore her wishes?",
        "Judge: That sometimes life is unfair, Dr. Lord. And despite our best intentions, we don't always know the right answer. I'm very sorry.",
        "Dorian: No, you are not sorry, you power-tripping son of a bitch!",
        "Blair: Dorian, Dorian, Dorian, come on -- no, stop.",
        "Dorian: Yes! Yes! You, Sir, are a soulless tyrant.",

        "Carlotta: No, mijo -- use your hands. Put in more. Don't be cheap.",
        "Talia: We have to take him out. It's the only way. Otherwise, the next time it could be your mom, or Jamie.",
        "Carlotta: Ah.",
        "Talia: I brought this -- I brought this all on your family.",
        "Antonio: No, baby. No, you didn't. My family has a history with your father.",
        "Talia: Yeah, well, it all stops here.",
        "Antonio: All right -- I think that you and I would be better off not emulating our fathers.",
        "Talia: Okay, honey. What are we supposed to do? Supposed to find him, capture him, lock him up? We've tried that. It didn't work. He escaped. I was supposed to keep him from hurting anyone else. That was the deal. That's why I went into law enforcement.",
        "Antonio: No, you went into law enforcement because you're nothing like him.",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Antonio: Hey, you are nothing like him, okay? You're good and strong and ethical. He's already paying. He lost you. And -- and as far as his criminal career goes? We're just going to have to do our best, okay?",

        "Guard: You should go before he comes back.",
        "John: You know, when Hesser passed through here, a lot of money changed hands. Did you see any of it?",
        "[Guard scoffs]",
        "John: I didn't think so. I bet this guy did, the warden. And when this blows up in your face, he's going to walk, but you don't have the money to pay anyone off, do you?",
        "[Guard sighs]",
        "Guard: Come back in 10 minutes when the warden is gone. I'll tell you what you want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: This should be enough to buy the American's freedom.",
        "Warden: What American? That man is Ray Montez, the murderer. Are you trying to bribe me into freeing a dangerous criminal? That is a crime, Senora.",
        "Vanessa: I'm trying to make your problem go away, warden. Or would you rather I talk to that police officer in the corridor? I'm sure he'll be relieved to find that I've found the man in the photograph. Now cut the crap. Do you want the money or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Let's go outside.",
        "Dorian: Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay, just calm down.",
        "Starr: Markko, she's making this worse, isn't she?",
        "Markko: Hey, if you really cared about Langston, you wouldn't do this.",
        "Blair: Dorian, it's okay.",
        "Dorian: No, it's not okay. It's not.",
        "Judge: Dr. Lord, Dr. Lord, I would advise you to proceed with restraint and respect.",
        "Dorian: Unfortunately, Your Honor, I have lost all respect for you. However, in the interest of justice, why don't we all just give you a few minutes to reconsider your decision and do the right thing?",
        "Judge: Or what, Dr. Lord?",
        "Dorian: Or I will ruin your life and decimate your career, the same way I did with the Buchanans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Did you get anything?",
        "Officer: A name and number.",
        "Bo: Well, thank you, Briggs. That's all. I.T. blew up this picture of Lovett and his buddy. So, they were able to get his name off the back of his helmet, here. Did Brody ever mention a guy named Wes Granger?",
        "Gigi: No, no, he never talked about what happened over there.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Man: Hello?",
        "Bo: Is this Wes Granger?",
        "Wes: Speaking. Who's this?",
        "Bo: I'm Police Commissioner Buchanan in Llanview, Pennsylvania, and I was wondering if you've heard from a fellow officer of yours named Brody Lovett?",
        "Wes: You can stop right there, Commissioner. There is no way I'm ratting out a fellow Seal, especially Brody Lovett.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Once you know the rules, inside and out, the next step is to learn how to shoot.",
        "Shane: How long does that take?",
        "Brody: It takes a while. It takes discipline, patience, focus. You can't hurry it.",
        "Shane: Okay.",
        "Brody: First, you got to learn how to hold that gun steady. It's going to shake at first. You got to practice holding it, 10 seconds at a time, till you can do it for a full minute. Okay? Then you got to work on your sight alignment.",
        "Shane: What does that mean?",
        "Brody: Well, you don't want to be looking all over the place. You want to maintain focus on your target. Practice that till you can do that for a full minute.",
        "Shane: Just stare at it?",
        "Brody: You watch it. There's a difference. Then you got to practice squeezing that trigger without moving your hand and spoiling your shot. Once you can do that, you're ready to take aim.",
        "Shane: That is so cool!",
        "Brody: Yeah, only we forgot something.",
        "Shane: What?",

        "Dorian: I will not allow anyone to violate a child. Do you understand me? I said I would ruin you and I will. I will use every resource at my command -- my roots in this community, my connections politically and in the media. I will bring you down, and when I'm through with you, so --",

        "Wes: You're wasting your breath. Brody Lovett's a good man and I won't speak a word against him.",

        "Wes: What? Who's that?",
        "Bo: We're in my office on a speaker phone. I have two people here with me, Rex Balsom and Gigi Morasco.",
