        "Bo is at Natalie's place and she tells him that she is studying and can't talk right now. He insists and boldly walks in the place. \"It is about John.\" She closes the door but hopes that he makes the visit short. She explains that the balloons are for a celebration that she plans to have when John comes home. \"He isn't coming home.\" She grabs her coat, \"Well, what hospital is he in?\" Bo says that John was in an accident and didn't make it. Michael tries to put on a better face before entering the house but Marcie hears him coming in and opens the door to tell that they got the go-ahead to adopt Tommy. He tries to be glad but she can see that something is wrong. He blubbers and finally gets it out that John is dead. Marcie is stunned. He tells the whole story and only feels better when Tommy is in his arms. David is getting tossed out of Renee's restaurant. He apparently made a pass at the mayor's wife. Dorian saves him from getting kicked out. He asks Dorian to run away with him. He isn't kidding. He is getting treated badly in town and doesn't want to stick around for Spencer's trial. Dorian can't leave. She has to work things out with Clint and Adriana. A woman comes to David and hands him her business card. She is a movie director and thinks that David is hot for his age. She offers her work if he will call her. David says his good-byes to Dorian and they share one last magic kiss before he is out the door. Claudia is in bed with Nash, and she keeps stopping him to make sure that he knows that she isn't Tess. He does. While she is busy kissing his body literally from top to bottom, he looks over at Tess's picture on the bedside table and he puts it face down. In the morning, he remembers that he put it down and picks it up again. Michael is about to call his mother but then decides not to. She is coming to town the next day anyway. She was going to bring her engagement ring for John to propose with to Natalie. Natalie won't believe that John is dead unless she sees the body. Bo doesn't want her to see what he saw. \"He was burned Natalie.\" It is only when he shows her the necklace John had on him that Natalie accepts what is told to her. Bo wants to take her to stay with family but she insists on staying at the house 'with John' alone. When alone, she puts on John's leather jacket, and pulls it tight around her while she inhales his scent from it. She spends the night sitting at the window, in the jacket, staring out into the night."

        "Michael: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: I know, I know -- get to the point, right? Well, Janice Dixon called and she said that judge granger made her decision. And she chose us. Michael, she chose us. We get to adopt Tommy. Isn't that great? Isn't that news just so wonderful?",
        "Michael: Yeah. Yeah, that's -- that's really great, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I know. All we have to do now is fill out the paperwork and then Tommy's ours and, look -- look, I even got -- I even got us some champagne, you know, to celebrate because you're going to be a daddy.",

        "David: Thank you. But if you're about to launch into a lecture, I think I'd rather leave.",
        "Dorian: No -- no lectures. Thank you very much for sticking up for me with Adriana. I'm living in a glass house myself, anyway, and don't ask me about Clint because, oh, I really blew it.",
        "David: Well, if it makes you feel better, I can identify. I haven't exactly been voted Llanview's most popular resident.",
        "Dorian: You know, trying to seduce the mayor's wife wouldn't have helped.",

        "Dorian: You're leaving?",
        "David: I have no job, no money, and no place to live. People in this town treat me as if I've got some sort of contagious disease. Why shouldn't I leave?",

        "Adriana: Come on, Rex. Haven't you heard the expression \"revenge is sweet\"?",
        "Rex: Revenge can also ruin your life. Why don't you just forget about Dorian and move on?",
        "Adriana: Hello. She hired someone to stalk me and then he kidnapped me and then he almost killed you. She has to be punished.",
        "Rex: And you had her arrested.",
        "Adriana: That's not enough!",
        "Rex: You really want to see your mother in jail?",
        "Adriana: She's not my mother -- she's a monster, and monsters deserve to be locked up for the good of society.",
        "Rex: Bruce is dead. He can't testify against her.",
        "Adriana: Well, then, the police can build a case against -- on my testimony.",
        "Rex: Oh, then it's your word against Dorian's. That's not enough.",
        "Adriana: I can't let her go free, Rex.",
        "Rex: Why not? She can't stop us from being together. She knows how much she hurt you. Isn't that punishment enough?",
        "Adriana: Apparently not, since she still thinks she can control my life.",
        "Rex: Just ignore her. I doubt she'll hire another pseudo stalker.",
        "Adriana: This isn't funny, Rex. I was never so scared in my entire life.",
        "Rex: I know. You're safe now.",
        "Adriana: Because of you, but my mother still hates you.",
        "Rex: I don't care.",
        "Adriana: I do. I need to teach her a lesson.",
        "Rex: How?",
        "Adriana: I'm not sure, but I've got a couple of ideas. Hire somebody to stalk her.",
        "Rex: And what? He'll put a bag over her head, hold a knife to her throat?",
        "Adriana: Hmm.",
        "Rex: She knows that's what happened to you. She'll probably be flattered by the imitation.",
        "Adriana: Please, help me? Or I'll do it without you.",
        "Rex: What if something goes wrong and you get hurt?",
        "Adriana: I'll risk it.",
        "Rex: All right, I'm in.",
        "Adriana: Oh, thank you!",
        "Rex: Well, I just hope you feel that way when it's over.",
        "Adriana: You won't be sorry, I promise.",
        "Rex: I already am. You really want to get back at her? All right. Then you've got to make her suffer over something she really cares about.",

        "Marcie: No. Ok, no, because John -- he can't --",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: No, Michael, it can't be.",
        "Michael: An 18-wheeler jumped the divide on the highway, hit him head-on.",
        "Marcie: I don't -- I don't believe this.",
        "Michael: The car exploded. He never had a chance, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Are you really sure about this, Michael, because, you know, I mean, a lot of people got hurt in that accident.",
        "Michael: I saw his body.",

        "Bo: Natalie, you called me earlier to tell me that you thought that something was wrong.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I was being neurotic, you know, overprotective. John -- makes John crazy.",
        "Bo: Oh, Natalie --",
        "Natalie: Look, would I buy all these balloons if I thought something was wrong? I mean, would I be cramming for an exam if I thought that John was gone?",
        "Bo: This is hard, I know.",
        "Natalie: No, it's not hard because it's a mistake.",
        "Bo: It's not a mistake. I saw the body.",
        "Natalie: It wasn't him, ok? John made plans with me. He wouldn't leave me, ok? He wouldn't.",
        "Bo: Natalie, he's dead.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's what they said about Cristian.",
        "Bo: This isn't the same.",

        "Nash: No, come on. This is crazy.",
        "Claudia: Yeah, so is falling in love with a woman who doesn't exist.",
        "Nash: Tess is gone. What do you want me to say?",
        "Claudia: That she's gone from your heart.",
        "Nash: Can't. Sorry.",
        "Claudia: Because she's part of Jessica and Jessica's starting to act like her now?",
        "Nash: Nope -- because Tess is a part of Jessica, and Tess is not coming back. I lost her.",
        "Claudia: So -- hmm -- I'm your consolation prize.",
        "Nash: Yes.",

        "Natalie: That's not good enough, ok? John told me that he was coming home and I believe him. You know, so unless there's some sort of proof that he's dead, then I -- I'm going to sit here and I'm going to wait for him to walk through that door. Ok, are you going to take me to the morgue, Uncle Bo, or do I have to go myself?",
        "Bo: No, Natalie. Natalie. I want you to remember him the way he was.",
        "Natalie: Why? I mean, nothing could be worse than what I am picturing in my head.",
        "Bo: Listen to me. He was burned very badly.",
        "Natalie: Then how do you know it's him?",
        "Bo: Because his -- his height and his weight matched.",
        "Natalie: That -- that could be thousands of guys!",
        "Bo: No, but Michael was there with me. He's the one that identified the body.",
        "Natalie: Ok, but did he look, did he really look --",
        "Bo: Look, we found his badge. It was right next to the body. We also saw some tattoos that were visible --",
        "Natalie: Ok, the badge, the badge -- it flew. It flew away during the crash and, I mean, lots of guys have tattoos. He could still be at the site. I've got to go find him.",

        "Adriana: I'm not going to change my mind.",

        "Adriana: Well, my mother is very attached to her bank account. I mean, she loves being rich.",
        "Rex: All right, well, then she'll just figure out another way to get rich. People like her always do. In fact, it's the reason they get up in the morning. Uh -- what else does she care about?",
        "Adriana: Her girls, or so she says.",
        "Rex: Do you really want to hurt Blair or Kelly?",
        "Adriana: Oh, God, no, of course not. I mean, it's hard enough being one of Dorian's girls. They don't need to be caught in the middle. Come on, Rex, just keep thinking. I need something guaranteed to work.",

        "Adriana: Yeah. She has a thing for Clint Buchanan. I saw them kissing and she was like a teenager, but I told you -- he broke up with her when he found out what she did.",
        "Rex: All right, Clint might be the way to go. I got to think about it.",
        "Adriana: On a scale of 1-10, how obsessed am I?",
        "Rex: Oh, 100. That's what I love about you.",
        "Adriana: My capacity for hate?",
        "Rex: No, I think of it as commitment. You know what you want. In this case, it's revenge.",

        "Dorian: But you'll have to testify.",
        "David: So I'll leave a forwarding address. Haven't you ever just wanted to ditch everything and start all over again?",

        "Bo: I know, but she was really adamant about being alone, so let's respect the way that she wants it.",
        "Jessica: Well, I don't think that she's the best judge of what she needs right now.",
