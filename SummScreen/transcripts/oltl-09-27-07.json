        "Jessica: Get out!",
        "Jared: It's up to your sister.",
        "Nash: Yeah -- we've talked about it, and we're not going to take any more of your crap.",
        "Jared: Either one of you know the number for the Atlantic City PD?",
        "Nash: Get it yourself. But while you're talking to them, make sure that you mention that it happened over two years ago, and it wasn't Jessica, it was her alternate personality, Tess. What do you think? We'll take our chances, right?",
        "Jared: You feel lucky?",
        "Jessica: I'm not letting you bully my sister into giving you a job.",
        "Jared: You don't need to. She already did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Yeah! Mmm! Nice.",
        "John: Whoever beat you before ain't going to do it twice.",
        "Natalie: Nope, not here, not anywhere.",
        "[Natalie chuckles]",
        "Natalie: Oh, I had better get to work.",
        "John: Thanks for the game.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Thanks for the apology. It meant a lot to me.",
        "John: I owed you.",
        "Natalie: See you.",
        "John: See you.",
        "Singer: If you had a chance to wear your hero's pants",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Really didn't see that one coming. How did you know those guys were our perps?",
        "Antonio: Oh, you do enough stakeouts, you learn how to read them.",
        "Talia: Well, I guess I have more learning to do. Lieutenant -- I'm -- I'm sorry, sir. I mean --",
        "John: It's ok. I know what you mean. I'm suspended. You don't need to act like it didn't happen.",
        "Antonio: Well, if it's any consolation, I would have covered for my brother, too.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "[Antonio sighs]",
        "Talia: You think they'll give him back his badge?",
        "Antonio: I don't know. No idea. I hope so. Because being a cop means everything to John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Miles: Marty? Hey. Marty, wait. Look, I need to talk to you.",
        "Marty: Look, we don't have anything more to talk about, Miles.",
        "Miles: I need to talk to you about you kissing John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, man. I didn't know you were taking creative writing.",
        "Markko: Yeah, I'm into it.",
        "Langston: Oh, please, you're here because you're into me.",
        "Markko: That's right. I'm all about Langston Hughes.",
        "Langston: You don't even know who that is.",
        "[Langston laughs]",
        "Starr: So who do you guys think is going to sub for Mrs. McBain?",
        "Cole: We're getting a sub?",
        "Starr: Well, she's in court with my dad all the time. There's no way that she can teach until this thing is over.",
        "Marcie: Good morning, class. Hi.",
        "Britney: This is going to be fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You expect me to host this sham of a wedding, here at La Boulaie?",
        "Blair: Todd, what's wrong with City Hall?",
        "Todd: Well, we've been married here before, right? It's going to look a lot better than some justice of the peace quickie.",
        "Blair: Gosh, he knows how to sweet-talk a girl, doesn't he?",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Todd: So get to work. You're hosting this thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I just got off the phone with Lindsay's doctors at St. Ann's.",
        "Clint: And?",
        "Nora: Well, she's showing no signs of improvement, so if she's faking it, she's just a hell of an actress.",
        "Clint: What's her prognosis?",
        "Nora: It's not good. And -- and Will had to go back to California, so now she's all on her own.",
        "Clint: Oh. Do I detect a note of sympathy?",
        "Nora: Oh, Clint, if this is for real, she may not recover.",
        "[Clint sighs]",
        "Clint: Truman's list of victims, it just never ends, does it?",
        "Nora: Well, I think I better call Bo. I want -- I should let him --",
        "Clint: I don't know about that. You know, Bo taking Matthew to Pa's ranch is partly to keep Matthew away from the chaos.",
        "Nora: Yeah, that's true. And I suppose if he finds out what's going on, he'll drop everything and come back.",
        "Clint: They're going to be back soon enough, you know. Once they get here, what can they do but worry?",
        "Nora: You're right, you're right. You're absolutely right. You're right. No, let them enjoy their trip.",
        "Clint: Oh, before you go, Nora, the -- your mail came.",
        "Nora: Oh, the mail? Oh, the mail. Gosh only knows what kind of contest I could have won. Maybe a bazillion dollars.",
        "[Clint chuckles]",
        "Nora: Oh -- oh -- oh -- oh, my God.",
        "Clint: What is it?",
        "Nora: Oh! It's my check from the insurance company! Ah! Clint, Matthew and I can finally buy a home! Oh, my God! We're going to be out of your hair, and you can start popping champagne bottles to celebrate tonight.",
        "Clint: Actually, I don't think I'll be celebrating that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Ok, if you can just pass these around -- thank you, Starr.",
        "Marcie: Ok. Is anyone familiar with Denise Levertov? Britney?",
        "Britney: Oh, actually, I don't know who she is. Um -- I just wanted to say, I really hope you get to keep your baby, Mrs. McBain.",
        "Marcie: Thank you, Britney. Uh -- Denise Levertov was born in England and she worked as a nurse in World War II.",
        "Britney: And I want you to know that you have our support.",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Britney: Doesn't she, everyone?",
        "Marcie: Britney, I think it is inappropriate for you, or myself, to discuss my personal life in the classroom, ok?",
        "Britney: Oh, you didn't think so last year. I mean, you used to talk about Tommy all the time, remember? Like any good mom does.",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Britney: And I think that you're a great mom, Mrs. McBain. And I think it's awful that someone is trying to steal your son away --",
        "Langston: Zip it, Brit! Or I'll zip it for you.",
        "Britney: All I'm saying is that --",
        "Cole: Hey! You heard her, Britney. Shut up.",
        "Britney: Mrs. McBain should not have to lose her son.",
        "Starr: He is not her son! And that was so low of you trashing my dad in court! What he did in college has nothing to do with what kind of father he is!",
        "Marcie: Starr, you don't understand the ramifications --",
        "Starr: I understand. Ok? Tommy is my brother and you are trying to take him away from us.",
        "Marcie: Tommy is my son. And he has been my son for a year and a half. And since your father found out who he was, he has not made one single effort to work with me and my husband!",
        "Starr: Why should my dad work with you?",
        "Cole: Starr --",
        "Britney: Look, we are all on your side, Mrs. McBain.",
        "Marcie: Britney, please!",
        "Starr: My dad never wanted Tommy to be adopted.",
        "Marcie: This father you're so proud of -- he is treating me and my husband like we are criminals!",
        "Britney: And as if the world needs another",
        "Marcie: Britney, shut up!",
        "Starr: We don't need your crap, Britney!",
        "Marcie: Oh, great! Great! Now you're starting to sound just like him! Do you think I want that for my son? Do you think I want Tommy --",
        "Man: What is going on here?",
        "Marcie: To be the kind of man your father is?",
        "Man: What is going on here? I can hear you all the way down the hall!",
        "Marcie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. -- Mr. Fletcher. I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not usually like this. I'm so sorry. Mr. Fletcher: The class is dismissed. I need to have a word with Mrs. McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: We are not married anymore. According to the courts, we never were. Look, my personal life is none of your business.",
        "Miles: I know. I know. I just -- I can't help it that -- that I still have feelings for you. And when I saw you kiss John in a way that we never kissed, it hurt.",
        "Marty: Miles --",
        "Miles: Please, just -- just let me finish. My -- my therapist helped me realize that if I really want you to be happy, then I'm going to have to accept the fact that your happiness -- it might come from someone else.",
        "Marty: And you can do that?",
        "Miles: I want the best for you, Marty. I mean it. And I'm trying to rebuild my life.",
        "Marty: Well, that's not an easy thing to do.",
        "Miles: No. But apparently, you're doing it with John.",
        "Marty: Miles, I am not building a life with John -- not that it is any of your business.",
        "Miles: But you like him, right? Do you remember when we were snowbound at the ski lodge last winter and we were wishing on a star?",
        "Marty: Where are you going with this?",
        "Miles: My wish was that one day you would look at me like you look at John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Don't you think the timing of this so-called wedding is going to be deemed suspicious?",
        "Todd: Well, when did I have time to do it before? When I was missing?",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Todd: Half dead?",
        "Dorian: Hmm. I'm just playing devil's advocate here. If this were a real marriage --",
        "Todd: It's going to look like a real marriage. Isn't that right, love of my life?",
        "Blair: Oh, come on, Todd, -- if we're going to make this look real, it has to be an award-winning performance here. If the judge buys it, Todd gets his son back. If he doesn't, nothing's changed, and we haven't lost anything, right?",
        "Dorian: Oh, please, don't ask me that question.",
        "Blair: Well, I mean, it would be worth it.",
        "Dorian: Todd, why don't you ask Viki to throw you a wedding?",
        "Todd: She's out of town.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? This is a great opportunity for you. This will be all over the society pages, and you could finally be one up on Viki. That'd be good.",
        "Dorian: It's not going to come cheap.",
        "Todd: I know. Send me the bills.",
        "Dorian: I wasn't thinking about that. It goes without saying. I was thinking about the $5 million you promised to pay Blair.",
        "Todd: I'm good for that.",
        "Blair: Yeah, that's cash up front. No \"I do\" before you do.",
        "Todd: I'm glad to know that you're doing this for all the right reasons.",
        "Blair: Come on, Todd. We've made it very clear doing this to get your son back. Somebody's got to look out for me, right?",
        "Todd: You always look out for you.",
        "Blair: Well, somebody has to, because you won't.",
        "Todd: So how long is it going to take to get this thing together, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: I know everybody worth knowing in this town. With a few phone calls, I can get the place decorated and catered. I'm afraid the only problem is going to be finding any guests to come who are willing to wish the two of you good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Everything ok?",
        "Marty: Yeah, it's fine.",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Miles and I just ran into each other.",
        "Miles: Literally. You don't have anything to worry about with me, John. You know that look I was talking about? It looks good on you. I'll see you.",
        "John: See you.",
        "Marty: Huh.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: So what was that all about?",
        "Marty: Nothing, he just -- he just wanted to tell me that he's trying to change.",
        "John: Oh, I don't think people like that change. What did he mean by \"that look looks good on you\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: There's no way Natalie would hire you. Not after the way you scammed us.",
        "Natalie: Actually, I did. Jared now works for Buchanan Enterprises.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, I appreciate that you're trying to protect me, but it's not necessary.",
        "[Jared chuckles]",
        "Jared: She didn't hire me to save you, or Tess or whoever you are right now. She didn't have any choice.",
        "Nash: What, do you got something on Natalie now?",
        "Jared: Yeah, I -- I got her behind the eight-ball.",
        "Natalie: Ok, what Jared means --",
        "Jared: I made her realize that it was a losing proposition not to hire me, that she's smarter than that.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, come on, you can handle this jerk. Just kick him out on his ass.",
        "Jared: See? Now, there's the Tess that I knew.",
        "Nash: No, no, no, that's not Tess. That's Jess. And Natalie has nothing to do with this, so why don't you get up, walk out of here, and don't come back.",
        "Jared: I'm not walking.",
        "Nash: Oh.",
        "Jared: Natalie and I have a deal. Isn't that right, Sparky?",
        "Jessica: \"Sparky\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Thank you. Goodbye. Ok. I've got beluga caviar coming. Not the highest grade, but then again, it's very short notice.",
        "Blair: Thank you for doing all this, really.",
        "Dorian: I just hope it works. Because if it doesn't, Todd will still be without his son, and you --",
        "Todd: She'll be $5 million richer.",
        "Dorian: I just hope her heart isn't going to be broken into 5 million pieces. And what about your children?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Dorian: Excuse me. That's probably the florist.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Blair: She's right, you kn. We got to be careful what we say. It could devastate Jack and Starr.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but if we tell them, they could give us away.",
        "Blair: They want us to be together.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, I don't know. Jack, maybe.",
        "Blair: No, Starr, too. We really need to be careful, Todd. We got to tell them something.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but -- Starr can keep a secret. Jack's a wild card.",
        "Blair: But it's something we -- we got to risk. I mean, I'd lie to the judge, but I wouldn't lie to our kids.",
        "Todd: All right. But keep it simple, though.",
        "Blair: Well, it is simple.",
        "Todd: All right. I'm going to go pick up Starr, and you should slip into something more wedding day.",
        "Blair: You know, I saved the dress from the last time, you know. The one that -- the wedding that Margaret messed up.",
        "Todd: No kidding. You kept that thing?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I did. I -- I -- you know, I was going to donate it. But I just -- I haven't gotten around to it.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, that's convenient.",
        "Blair: Yeah, very.",
        "Todd: All right, get ready.",
        "Blair: Todd? Don't forget to pick up my check for 5 million.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You've been nonstop since you got back from your New York trip. Like you're trying not to think --",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Antonio: Maybe.",
        "Talia: The 9/11 anniversaries bring up a lot, you know.",
        "Antonio: Even for those of us who weren't there. I don't know how you do it.",
        "Talia: You just do it. You know? You have to move forward, and -- it's a really hard day every year. But, God, the human spirit's really tough. And you don't really get to learn that until it's tested.",
        "Antonio: I hear you. So did George go with you?",
        "Talia: Um --",
        "Antonio: I mean, since he's your -- your guy, I just thought, you know --",
        "Talia: Uh -- help me --",
        "Antonio: Yeah, ok.",
        "Talia: He had to work.",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah? What -- what does he do? Here.",
        "Talia: A job that requires you wearing a suit --",
        "Antonio: Yeah?",
        "Talia: Every day.",
        "Antonio: Well, I never figured you for a suit.",
        "Talia: Gross.",
        "Antonio: Um -- so what's the deal? Think you met the one?",
        "Talia: Yeah, I think maybe I have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You know, it was a couple months before he died, Pa told me that he was going to ask you and Matthew to make this your permanent home.",
        "Nora: He said that?",
        "Clint: Well, I cleaned up the language just a little bit, but --",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Clint: You know, at one point, he said \"Clint, I'm going to find a way to make them stay.\"",
        "Nora: Yeah, there you go. That sounds more like Asa.",
        "Clint: Yeah. Asa did not want you two to go. So in the absence of my father, I'm making you the offer.",
        "Nora: Oh, Clint, come on, you don't have to do that.",
        "Clint: I want to. I want you to make this your home, for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Straight through to the living room. Thank you very much. No, there is not a caterer here yet. I -- I -- please, we're having a wedding. We cannot be without food. Thank you very much.",
        "Blair: It was a horrible idea. There's -- there's no way I'm going to be ready in time. I can't find my shoes. And forget about my hair looking like anything special.",
        "Dorian: Blair, aren't you getting a little bit carried away with this wedding thing?",
        "Blair: Dorian, I want to look decent.",
        "Dorian: But about the dress --",
        "Blair: Oh, you know what? I'm tired of everybody giving me a hard time about my dress.",
        "Dorian: Who else is?",
        "Blair: Todd. He was surprised that I still had it.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, well, the last time you wore that dress, you were marrying him for love. Oh, excuse me, please. That's an antique. Be very careful with it.",
        "Man: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Dorian: Good.",
        "Blair: I didn't have time to buy a new one.",
        "Dorian: Oh? Is that the only reason?",
        "Blair: I know what I'm getting into, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: I hope so.",
        "Blair: Yeah, I'm doing this for $5 million and for Todd to get his son back.",
        "Dorian: What if it doesn't work? What if the judge thinks the baby stays with the McBains?",
        "Blair: Well, then it would kill Todd.",
        "Dorian: What about you? Will you stand by him as his wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You know, you're like toxic waste, spreading your poison wherever you go.",
        "Britney: I just hope Mrs. McBain isn't in trouble.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "[Cole laughs]",
        "Cole: Oh, please, you don't give a damn about her or Starr.",
        "Britney: Look, Mrs. McBain is really nice. And her husband happens to be a doctor, not some --",
        "Starr: Hey, say it, and you're dead!",
        "Britney: I don't have to. Everybody knows what your father is. Anyway, it looks like Mrs. McBain's going to need a new babysitter. I think I'll go offer my services.",
        "Starr: I'll kill her.",
        "Cole: Starr, Starr, Starr -- calm down. Relax. Relax.",
        "Markko: Just forget the Brit-Bot, all right? She's not worth it.",
        "Langston: Markko's right, Starr.",
        "Cole: She's just trying to mess with you, all right?",
        "Starr: You know, I'm not even worried about Britney, it's just what Mrs. McBain said really freaked me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Fletcher: I may be new here, but I know your reputation, Mrs. McBain. You are considered an excellent teacher by both your colleagues and the students.",
        "Marcie: Thank you.",
        "Mr. Fletcher: Still, I cannot allow any faculty member to bring their personal business into the classroom.",
        "Marcie: No, I agree with you. I agree. I'm just -- I'm under a great deal of stress right now, and I guess I lost it for a second. I am so sorry.",
        "Mr. Fletcher: The things you were saying were completely inappropriate. I'm sorry, until this custody issue is settled, I'm going to have to place you on indefinite leave.",
        "Marcie: No, please, Mr. Fletcher, I love these children. I promise you, I will not let them again.",
        "Mr. Fletcher: I'm sorry, I'm sticking with my decision.",
