        "Dorian: Be very discreet. I don't want everybody thinking they've got a camera being shoved in their faces. Excuse me, I want these chairs in a perfect half- circle, so please check that out, fix it, handle it. Thanks very much. Oh, oh -- please, cover the caviar and put it in a dish of ice -- thank you. Speaking of which, chill the champagne to 45 degrees, not more, not less, and this flower arrangement -- I want it up there on that piece of furniture. Thank you. Aha! Hilda, I asked you to polish the banisters.",
        "Hilda: I already polished the banisters, ma'am.",
        "Dorian: Well, do it again. Thank you, and you -- you're new. Thank you for helping out today at La Boulaie. Oh, you don't speak English. No problema -- yo habla espa\u00f1ol. Uh -- aqui -- perdoname. Uh -- aqui no me gusta este, es muy fea. Yo quiero flores --",
        "Hilda: She doesn't speak Spanish, ma'am. Connie is Italian.",
        "Dorian: Oh! Oh, oh, va bene. Um -- flowers, not ribbons. Capito?",

        "Jared: Well, maybe I'm mixing business with surfing, but, just, come here, look at this.",
        "Natalie: I'm busy.",
        "Jared: You know, you're going to bust a vein in your head if you don't relax. Maybe you should try yoga or go get a massage, Sparky.",
        "Natalie: Don't call me that.",
        "Jared: You are as stressed as it gets. When was the last time you had sex?",

        "Blair: Is there something you want to say?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Well, then what are you here for?",

        "Natalie: My sex life is none of your business.",
        "Jared: Not getting any, huh? Yeah, that's what I thought.",
        "Natalie: Do you know how close you are to being fired for sexual harassment? I am your boss.",
        "Jared: When was the last time you slept with someone -- I mean, besides me?",
        "Natalie: Oh, honey, all we did was sleep.",
        "Jared: Hmm.",

        "Natalie: You shouldn't -- oh, oh.",
        "Jared: Yeah, maybe, but this feels go, right? You have one hell of a knot right here.",
        "Natalie: Ah -- ooh. Are you trying to make me crazy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, this has got to look real. Remember? I don't want this whole thing is going to go up in smoke.",
        "Blair: Well, what is this, some dry run?",
        "Todd: Well, no. I just wanted to make sure I could still kiss you and make your knees buckle. It's got to look real when they hear, \"you may kiss the bride.\"",
        "Blair: You are -- I don't know what you are.",
        "Todd: Huh, it's ok. I can fill in the blanks. We're not together anymore, right?",

        "Todd: It's not a game.",
        "Blair: Yeah?",
        "Todd: It's anything but a game. We got to get married, we got to make the judge think we're one big, happy family so I can get my son back.",
        "Blair: \"Happy\" -- now, that's a choice of words.",
        "Todd: Well, that's the way business works. I pay you, you marry me. There's no other reason why you'd marry me, is there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I really don't know what you're talking about, ok? We have paid our rent we have never been late once since we moved in here.",
        "Roxy: Tough tarts -- I'm not talking about the rent.",
        "[Marcie sighs]",
        "Marcie: Roxy, look, I'm warning you, ok? I am not in the mood. I had a really horrible day. I'm not in the mood for any of your deep doody!",
        "Roxy: Oh, really?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Well, I don't give a hooter about what kind of mood you're in. Now, get out of here!",

        "Cole: Did I just hear that right -- your parents are getting married?",
        "Starr: Well, that's how my parents do things. One minute, there's not a chance, and then the next, um -- boom. Huh.",
        "Cole: Well, when did this happen?",
        "Starr: Within the last 12 hours.",
        "Cole: Well, isn't this kind of a big deal for a couple-hour notice?",
        "Starr: Well, that's how my Aunt Dorian does things -- huh. She makes them big and fast and --",
        "Cole: Uh-huh.",
        "Dorian: Cole! Oh, thank you, you're finally finished.",
        "Starr: Oh -- hi.",

        "Cole: No.",
        "Starr: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Well, if you are, we've got to find you some clothes to wear -- jacket, tie, probably a pair of pants.",
        "Starr: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: Come on.",
        "Starr: I'm right behind you. Go!",

        "Nash: Hey, did you hear who Todd's best man is?",
        "Clint: No. Who?",
        "Jessica: Me. He said he wouldn't take no for an answer.",
        "[Clint chuckles]",
        "Clint: You're the most beautiful best man I've ever seen.",
        "Jessica: Ah, shucks.",
        "Clint: Have you heard from Viki?",
        "Jessica: Uh, yes. She's been emailing me and Natalie every day -- well, almost every day -- from Paris.",
        "Clint: Uh-huh.",
        "Jessica: She says that she's soaking in the beauty of the sunsets.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me. Viki is in Paris -- my city?",
        "Jessica: I'll tell my mother you've been asking about her.",
        "Dorian: Oh, my! I wonder if I'll ever see the day when Viki doesn't imitate every single thing that I do. You know, I thought maybe when she left town that she had learned something from the little talk that we had at Asa's funeral, but no.",
        "Clint: What talk?",
        "Dorian: I asked her to look at her life and decide what she was going to do with the rest of it and what was, you know, her decision? To flee --",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: To my city, Paris, the city of light. No, no, not like that. Never like that -- no, no, no, no, no! Impossible. Comme ca. That's good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: We've been over this a thousand times, Todd. We're toxic If this were a real marriage, it wouldn't work.",
        "Todd: Oh -- right.",
        "Blair: We're completely wrong for each other.",
        "Todd: Completely wrong for each other.",
        "Blair: No matter how much love or passion we may have had before, if we wanted to have a real relationship, it just wouldn't work -- not now, not ever.",
        "Todd: Nope, only a business relationship.",
        "Blair: Yep. Moneys paid for services rendered. And if I didn't believe in my heart that your little boy deserved to be with you, then I wouldn't go through with this fake wedding.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Blair: Jack.",
        "Jack: The wedding is fake?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Roxy!",
        "Roxy: Come on, get out here!",
        "Marcie: Roxy, what are you doing? Can you just tell me what I did already?",
        "Roxy: You know what you did!",
        "Marcie: No, I don't know what I did --",
        "All: Surprise!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Roxy: Oh, baby, that was tough. I think I need a little drink.",
        "Marcie: Oh!",
        "Michael: Happy birthday, Mommy.",
        "Marcie: Mmm!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: We were just trying to see what would happen if we diversified our Asian assets --",
        "Man: Nice try. This happens to be the billing hours of a multi-million dollar corporation and I expect to see business etiquette commensurate with a professional environment.",
        "Natalie: Did you need something, Jim?",
        "Jim: Yes, as a matter of fact. I want to see the new business evaluation report.",
        "Natalie: Well, that is Mr. Banks' first order of business, which is why he was given the position.",
        "Jim: And what position would that be, exactly?",
        "Natalie: Nothing was going on, Jim.",
        "Jim: Well, nothing involving Asian markets at any rate.",
        "Jared: We -- we get it, sir, and I am almost finished with the new business report. Can I get a little face time with you later?",
        "Jim: Listen, I don't know you, I don't know anything about you, I don't know why Natalie hired you, but I do manage this department. I'm responsible for all of Natalie's billable hours, her work delivered, as well as the performance of any employee under her -- whatever the relationship.",
        "Natalie: Our relationship is exactly what it should be -- strictly business.",
        "Jim: Just because your name is on the front of the building doesn't give you a free ticket. Now, you can call any relative you want, but ultimately you better produce.",
        "Natalie: I know that. I also know what all of the employees are saying about me at the water cooler.",
        "Jim: Yes, well, the polite word for that would be \"nepotism.\" Now, obviously, no one can fire you except for your father. But I report directly to him, and I'm not about to whitewash anything.",
        "Natalie: And I wouldn't expect you to. But what I do expect is to be treated like all the other employees in this building -- with some respect.",
        "Jim: You know, all those other employees in this building, a lot of them have MBAs -- you didn't even finish college. So don't you talk to me about respect, that's something you earn. Now, I may not have the final word as to whether you last around here, but I can make your life pretty miserable. That's triple for you, Banks. Have I made myself clear?",
        "Jared: I guess the old face-time thing is out.",
        "Natalie: Ugh! Don't you ever touch me again!",
        "Jared: Even after business hours?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Rex: Happy birthday, Marcie.",
        "Adriana: Happy birthday. We totally got you. Good job, Roxy.",
        "Marcie: Roxy, I ought to --",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah? Well, get in line, then.",
        "[Marcie laughs]",
        "Marcie: You confused the heck out of me!",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I had to jump a little ugly with you, baby, but it worked, didn't it?",
        "Marcie: It did. I guess with everything that's been happening with Tommy, I completely forgot it was my birthday.",
        "Michael: We know. That's why we did this.",
        "Marcie: Thank you. Oh, honey, I couldn't ask for a better husband. I don't know what I'd do without you two.",
        "Michael: Hey, I don't want you thinking about that, not today.",
        "Marty: It was really great what Michael did for her.",
        "John: Say what you want about him, he really loves Marcie.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I can see that. Well, I get why you like it up here. It's really nice.",
        "John: Yeah, normally I like the place to myself, but I have to admit this -- this party thing works ok.",
        "Marty: It's not bad.",
        "John: Thanks for coming.",
        "Marty: Oh, I had nothing else to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian is awesome -- this suit fits you perfectly.",
        "Cole: I know. Whose is it?",
        "Starr: Um, I have no idea. Maybe an old one of David's or something, but he is a lot taller than you.",
        "Cole: Is there anything she doesn't have stashed around here?",
        "Starr: My guess would be probably not.",
        "[Starr chuckles]",
        "Cole: Hey, do you really think I should stay? I mean, it's kind of awkward -- your dad's not my biggest fan.",
        "Starr: No, really, I -- I want you to stay here with me. Just please stay.",
        "Cole: Ok.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: You know, this may be kind of obvious, Clint, but is this wedding a shotgun wedding so that Todd can get his son back?",
        "Clint: Your guess is as good as mine.",
        "Nash: Hmm, but your guess is yes?",
        "Clint: All I know is that Dorian hasn't said word one.",
        "Jessica: Well, I better check in with her and see if there's anything special the best man should be doing.",
        "Nash: Well, lucky for you, it is past the time for a bachelor party, huh",
        "Jessica: Aw, nuts. I'll be right back.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm. Oh. I've got the money you loaned me.",
        "Clint: You got it back so soon? I should put you on the payroll.",
        "Nash: Yeah, well, I never actually spent it. See, it's the same money. Antonio sold his shares to someone else.",
        "Clint: So you've got a partner, huh?",
        "Nash: Unfortunately, yes.",
        "Clint: Ah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Hi. I'm Kirk Munroe. I'm here to perform the wedding?",
        "Dorian: Oh, Mr. Munroe, Dorian Lord. Thank you so much for coming on such short notice.",
        "Kirk: You make it very difficult to say no.",
        "Dorian: Please come in.",
        "Kirk: I would like to speak to the bride and groom, if I may? They must be very excited.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Is it? Is the wedding fake? Mom? Dad?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. We have a justice of the peace. He's real, he's got a license and everything. It's a very real wedding.",
        "Jack: That's not what mom said. She just said the wedding was fake.",
        "Blair: Uh -- you know what, Jack? You are -- you're old enough to know the truth. And the wedding is real, and the marriage is real, but --",
        "Todd: But -- but we might not always be married.",
        "Jack: You mean, you can get a divorce?",
        "Todd: Yes, that's -- that's a possibility.",
        "Blair: Well, see, Jack, we -- we just want to make a really nice home for your little brother when he comes to live with us.",
        "Jack: So it's like a practice wedding?",
        "Todd: Well, yeah -- well, no. It's not so much a practice wedding as it is a -- it's a trial. It's kind of a -- it's a -- it's actually a real wedding and a trial marriage. You don't get what I'm saying, do you?",
        "Jack: No. Does everyone know it's not for real?",
        "Blair: No -- Jack, really, it is for real. And I think the rest, we're just going to have to, you know, work on as we go. But what's important now is that you and your sister know that your daddy and I adore you, and we want to make a nice home for the baby, all right? That sound ok? Well, there she is, my beautiful bridesmaid. All ready to help me get dressed?",
        "Starr: Yeah, sure, um, but can I say something first?",
        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Starr: Well, there is somebody that I want to bring to the wedding, if that's ok with you guys.",
        "Todd: Well, that depends.",
        "Cole: Congratulations, Ms. Cramer. I hope it's ok that I'",
        "Todd: No, actually, it's not ok. Get the hell out of here -- now.",
        "Starr: Dad, Cole came to see me. He didn't know you were getting married.",
        "Todd: Then why is he wearing a suit?",
        "Starr: Because Aunt Dorian lent it to him.",
        "Cole: Hey, listen, I didn't come here to cause any trouble, so I'll just go.",
        "Todd: Good.",
        "Starr: Dad, you're not going to be a jerk.",
        "Blair: You know what? I -- I think it's actually a good idea -- after everything that went down in court.",
        "Starr: Yeah, see? Mom's right. Just let him stay, Dad.",
        "Jack: Yeah, come on. I like Cole.",
        "Todd: Eh.",
        "Starr: So will you let him stay?",
        "[Todd sighs]",
        "Todd: Just keep out of my way, all right?",
        "Cole: No problem.",
        "Todd: All right, he can stay.",
        "Starr: Thank you, Dad.",
        "Blair: Listen, why don't you and Cole go down and see what aunt Dorian needs from you or where she wants to put you, ok, Jack? Can you do that for me?",
        "Jack: Ok. Come on, Cole.",
        "Starr: Dad --",
        "Todd: I don't believe it. I -- I don't like the way you talked to me, I don't like being double-teamed by you guys.",
        "Starr: Ok, even though we were right? Dad, you need to make sure that the judge thinks that you've changed.",
        "Blair: Ok, no more sparring between the two of you. Todd, I need you to get out of here because I have to get dressed.",
