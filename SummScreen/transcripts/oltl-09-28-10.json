        "Brody is hanging on to his secret that he slept with Natalie and could be the father of her baby although it's \"out of the bag\" that Jessica slept with Robert Ford and he could be the father of Jessica's baby. He goes to talk to Marty and admits he made a \"mistake\" and has a \"secret\" and she seems to put two and two together. Jessica still has no clue that Brody and Natalie slept together and they don't dare tell her. But she senses there is something up with Brody that he is not telling her. Cole informs Starr that Hannah is staying in his mom's home. She is outraged that Hannah not only got acquitted, did not have to go back to St. Anne's but Marty takes her into her home. Starr then informs Cole that James cannot accept just being her friend. He asks her if she has feelings for James beyond friendship. She asks him if he has similar feelings for Hannah. Nate wants to be there for Dani at her court hearing, but she walks and he drives. While on the way, his car breaks down. James is there to help him. He shares with James that he will be devastated if Dani has to move to Tahiti. Nate knows that James has feelings for Starr. Todd is bound and determined to get the judge to rule in his favor so he demands that Greg go with him to the hearing, knowing that Greg knew what Tea's last wishes were before she died. Little does anybody know, except Greg and his nurse, that Tea is alive and well. Greg wants to prevent them from seeing each other. Meanwhile, John tells Ross that he needs to come clean and give up his serial killer brother. John knows he is not dead although he cannot prove it, or Ross will never see Dani again. At that point, Ross seems to realize that maybe he cannot trust Eli and might have no choice, but before he can admit it in court, Greg testifies that Tea told him she wanted Ross to have custody of Dani although he knows otherwise. While Hannah stays at her home, Marty tells Hannah that she is a bit concerned about her \"obsession\" over Cole. She is not judging her but knows that she, herself, once had a similar obsession at Hannah's age so she'd like to help her. Hannah appears gracious but we wonder what happens when she fixes Marty some tea later that night."

        "Natalie: Remind me why I love working here.",
        "John: Did you take your vitamins?",
        "Natalie: Yes, daddy, we took our vitamins.",
        "Ross: Come on, man, you have no warrant. You have no grounds to keep me here. It's bull!",
        "Natalie: Is this your idea?",
        "Ross: A bunch of crap, I tell you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Is--is that what you think? That I'm still after Cole? That I'm a psycho?",
        "Marty: No, Hannah, you're not psycho.",
        "Hannah: But?",
        "Marty: But you are too focused on my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Hannah is free? No charges for lying about seeing my dad push your mom down the stairs? For saying that she's the one who attacked Ford?",
        "Cole: No.",
        "Starr: This makes no sense. Hannah is the reason why Eli Clarke has been out this whole time. The reason why my mom trusted him, why she ran away to Tahiti with him and married him. She almost got herself killed and...and Hannah just gets to walk free?",
        "Cole: Starr, it's not that simple.",
        "Starr: Oh, no? No charges, no jail time, no probation? Did they at least send her back to Saint Ann's?",
        "Cole: No.",
        "Starr: So she's just roaming the streets?",
        "Cole: She's under supervision.",
        "Starr: Like in a halfway house?",
        "Cole: She's living with my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How about a Halloween wedding? I could go as a pregnant bride.",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Jessica: I think a Halloween wedding would be fun. You know, but then every year, we'd have to celebrate our anniversary on Halloween and I don't know if that would be good. What about mid October? It's just a few weeks away.",
        "Brody: A few weeks? Isn't that a little soon?",
        "Jessica: No. Not if you still want to marry me. You do, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Good luck.",
        "John: Yeah. Get out.",
        "Ross: Are you guys serious? Really? Oh. McBain, what the hell is this, huh? What am I doing here?",
        "John: Oh, didn't you hear? You match the description of the Llanview Mall purse snatcher.",
        "Ross: Llanview Mall, huh? That's good. That's almost as good as your girlfriend accusing me of stealing her phone.",
        "John: Huh. Take him down to his cell.",
        "Ross: What are you talking about? Come on. I'm not your guy. I was in Tahiti. You know that. Cut me loose, will you? I got to get down to the courthouse. The judge is about to grant me custody of Dani.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Okay, um, Blair said they called and the judge is ready to give her decision. I have to head over to the courthouse. I'm going to meet Blair there. I can't believe that a judge that I don't even know is about to decide my whole life--where I go, who I'm with.",
        "Nate: Whoa. What if Ross wins? Do you have to go with him?",
        "Dani: I guess, till I'm 18. Well, maybe he'll let me stay here in Llanview, at least for the school year.",
        "Nate: Or maybe I can go to the University of Tahiti. Does that even exist?",
        "Dani: I should go.",
        "Nate: Wait, wait. Um... I found this last spring, before we met. It brought me luck.",
        "Dani: Yeah, you think it'll bring my mom back? 'Cause she's the only person who can fix this. I should go.",
        "Nate: Wait. Let me drive you.",
        "Dani: No, it's like a 5-minute walk. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You're going to walk through the door any minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Hannah's staying with your mom? Like in her house?",
        "Cole: Look, don't forget, my mom's a shrink, all right? She's really good at what she does.",
        "Starr: Well, she's not exactly objective. Hannah lied to your mom. Hannah tried to break us up.",
        "Cole: My mom thinks the best way to deal with all that is to help Hannah get better.",
        "Starr: Well, then your mom's just a saint. Oh...",
        "Cole: My mom's a good doctor. Look, it's not going to be a problem, okay? I was over there this morning. My mom has everything under control.",
        "Starr: So this--this hearing was yesterday?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Well, why am I hearing about it now? We were together last night.",
        "Cole: And I didn't want to wreck things. Starr, it was a great night--you, me, Hope, and a couple of jars of finger paints. I mean, come on, I didn't want all this other stuff to get in the way.",
        "Starr: Why did you leave first thing this morning, then, to rush and see her? She framed my dad.",
        "[Cole sighs]",
        "Starr: What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Well, if you think I'm too focused on your son, why did you invite me to live with you?",
        "Marty: Because when I was your age, I developed a crush that became somewhat of an obsession. I almost ruined a person's life, and I don't want that to happen to you or my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Of course I still want to marry you. It's just--I mean, two weeks, that's not a lot of time.",
        "Jessica: Well, because if you're having second thoughts, I would completely understand. You know, if you just want to wait to make sure that this baby is yours--",
        "Brody: No, it's not that, it's just... I thought you wanted a church wedding with all the trimmings, and that's got to take more than two weeks to pull together. The flowers alone, and then the bridesmaids, the dress, the cake--",
        "Jessica: Okay, I don't care, I don't care. We can just grab a J.P. and get married down at the bus station, for all I care. And I could wear a tablecloth as a wedding dress, which will probably be the only thing that fits me by then. All that matters is that I'm marrying you. You have been so great to me. You know, if I thought you got someone else pregnant, I don't think I could handle it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You seem pretty confident the hearing's going to go your way.",
        "Ross: T\u00e9a wanted me to have Dani. It says so in her will.",
        "John: The will your brother drafted.",
        "Ross: She signed it.",
        "John: Apparently, she trusted him.",
        "Ross: Yeah, with good reason. It's an ironclad document. There's no way the judge is going to overturn that.",
        "John: You owe him big time.",
        "Ross: It's too bad he died.",
        "John: Did he? This is the--it's the D.N.A. report of the body found in your house after the fire. And this is your brother's D.N.A. Do you notice anything different?",
        "Ross: I'm no scientist.",
        "John: Obviously.",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "John: The thing is, they don't match. That means it wasn't your brother's body they found. See, your brother needed to fake his own death and he needed someone to help him. That's where you come in.",
        "Ross: Hmm. Makes for a nice story. Too bad you can't prove it.",
        "John: Yeah? I'm getting there. Eli knew he needed to compensate you. But how? What is it that you want more than anything? And I realized it's Danielle. So Eli agreed to get you custody of Danielle back in exchange for you helping him fake his death. That sound about right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Oh, good. No one's here yet. It's like this whole time, I've been holding my breath, you know, and now, I don't even know if I want to hear.",
        "Blair: Okay, listen, whatever the judge decides, we can fight it, all right? And I will stand right here beside you. It's whatever you want, Dani.",
        "Dani: That's the thing--I don't know what I want. I mean, I know that I don't want to leave here, but I don't want to lose my dad.",
        "Morgan: Good. You're here. Where's Todd?",
        "Blair: Well, don't look at me. I called his cell, stopped by the office, talked to Starr. I don't know where he is.",
        "Morgan: How about you, Danielle? Have you heard from him?",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Oh, no. What happened?",
        "Dani: He wanted me to run away with him so that Ross couldn't find me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: What are you doing?",
        "Todd: Now, what would you think? I'm here because of T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, is that you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Brody and I were just settling on a date.",
        "Brody: Pick whatever date you want. It doesn't matter to me. As long as it's legal, I'm good. But I have to go.",
        "Jessica: I thought you didn't have to work till later.",
        "Brody: You're not the only one with wedding stuff to do.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Brody: Okay.",
        "Jessica: You know, Brody says that he's okay with this whole Ford thing, but I know that he isn't. You know? What man wouldn't have trouble accepting another man's child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: The way I heard it, there was no D.N.A. test. It was corrupted.",
        "John: It was. That's why I had my own done.",
        "Ross: My brother was killed in the fire.",
        "John: Eli's first wife...you know, Ross, I'm starting to think you had something to do with that, too. I know the cops in Boston wouldn't mind having a fresh lead. And by the way, that's murder one--two counts if you count the second wife.",
        "Ross: Look, I had nothing to do with any of that.",
        "John: You know, at this point, I really don't care. I know you're helping now. And as payback, he fixed T\u00e9a's will so you'd get custody of Dani. You know, the thing is, you're going to spend the rest of your life in jail. And I'm gonna fix it so you never see her again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Gosh, it's just like Todd to panic like that. What was he thinking, taking you away like that? My gosh, it's a good thing that you had sense enough to talk him out of it.",
        "Dani: Well, I just couldn't leave here, and not see you or Starr or anybody I care about ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Hey.",
        "Nate: Oh, thanks for coming. I couldn't think of who else to call. I cannot afford a mechanic.",
        "James: Oh, forget it. I'm happy to help. It takes my mind off of things. So, what seems to be the problem?",
        "Nate: It won't start.",
        "James: Whew. Yeah. I hope you're not in a hurry, 'cause that could take a while.",
        "Nate: I'm trying to get to Dani's custody hearing. If her stepdad wins, she could be on a plane tonight.",
        "James: Yeah, that's--that's not good, man.",
        "Nate: Tell me about it. What am I supposed to do? I really like her. How do I let her just walk away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: What are you doing here?",
        "Todd: I need you to come to the court with me and help me gain custody of Dani.",
        "Greg: How can I possibly be of help with that?",
        "Todd: Well, you can testify. You were with T\u00e9a when she died. You can just tell the judge that she wanted me to raise Dani. So come on, let's--",
        "Greg: No, no, there's no way I can testify as to what T\u00e9a was thinking at the end. She had a brain tumor. She was heavily medicated.",
        "Todd: You told us that she asked for us at the end, that she wanted us there.",
        "Greg: Yes, but--",
        "Todd: Not Dani and Ross, Dani and me, right?",
        "Greg: Okay, but that's--",
        "Todd: Well, that's all you have to tell the judge. Come on, let's go. It's about to begin. Come on.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd? Is that you? Dan--Daniella?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Todd came right up in his car, told me to get in, and that he was taking me to the court, and that the hearing was going to start soon.",
        "Blair: And how did you know he was lying?",
        "Dani: I don't know, I just knew. And plus, you hadn't called me yet. Blair, he was so panicked.",
        "Blair: Well, sweetie, that's what he does when he's threatened. How'd you talk him down?",
        "Dani: I told him that Mom wouldn't want me to run away.",
        "Blair: Oh, you are so much like your mom.",
        "Dani: That's what Todd said, too. But I don't feel that. I don't feel anything like her. I mean, she was so strong and I'm just not. I'm not, Blair. I don't think I can do this. It's just too hard without her.",
        "Blair: Shh. Yeah, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Dani...baby...I'm okay. You'll see...when you get here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr, the last thing I want to do is hurt you. But Hannah is a friend. She saved my life. The least I can do is check up on her.",
        "Starr: You just don't get it, do you?",
        "Cole: Well, what about you and James? You're friends. I might not like it, but I've accepted it.",
        "Starr: James and I aren't even friends anymore.",
        "Cole: Why not? Because of me?",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Cole: Because I'll go talk to him if you want.",
        "Starr: No, it's not because of that. It's fine. It's fine the way it is.",
        "Cole: I thought James was important to you.",
        "Starr: He is. He is, but he can't handle just being friends. He wants more, and that's impossible, so...",
        "Cole: So he finally admitted that he has feelings for you? I mean, it was obvious. I just never thought he would come out and say it.",
        "Starr: He didn't say it. He kissed me, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I know I've crossed the line--more than once, but I thought I was starting to make up for that.",
        "Marty: Yes, and you know how much I appreciate all the sacrifices you've made, but that's just it--you have never had a normal friendship with Cole. Your attachment to him has always been about avoiding rejection.",
        "Hannah: Well, what did you do about your...obsession?",
        "Marty: Well, the first thing you have to admit is that that's what it is. Then it takes a lot of work.",
        "Hannah: And the guy?",
        "Marty: We ended up friends.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Marty: Excuse me. Brody, hey. Are you all right?",
        "Brody: No. And I'm sorry to bother you at home, but I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You know, it's not like we can pretend that this never happened. I slept with Ford, you know, and this--this baby may be his.",
        "Natalie's voice: So we're agreed? This is between us?",
        "Brody's voice: It'll be our secret.",
        "Jessica: And it's always there, you know? Whether we're talking about the baby or whether we're planning the wedding. That one stupid night that I slept with Ford.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but that wasn't your fault.",
        "Jessica: I know, but he--Brody's forgiven me. I've even forgiven myself, but I just--I can't stop thinking about it. And if I can't get it out of my head, how can I expect Brody to not think about it? You know, it just turns everything that is supposed to be wonderful into this torture. And it's worse for him, because he's constantly worried about whether or not I'm stressed out. I'm sorry. I--really, I didn't mean to worry you.",
        "Natalie: No--no, I mean, are you sure?",
        "Jessica: I'm positive. I'm positive. I didn't mean to unload on you like that.",
        "Natalie: No! No, don't say that. Don't say that.",
        "Jessica: No, it's just--it's simple for you and John, you know? You know that that baby is his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Dude, I haven't done anything wrong. My daugh--Dani loves me, I love her. Her mother's gone, she needs me, that's all it is.",
        "John: Maybe that's where it started, but now there's two wives unaccounted for. You really think that's going to go away, Ross? What do you think? You think he's just going to let you and Dani leave the country? Hmm? Let me tell you something--we catch up with him, he's going to turn on you so fast, you won't know what hit you.",
        "Ross: He's not going to turn...",
        "John: Hmm?",
        "Ross: He's dead.",
        "John: When I catch him, he's going to wish he's dead, I promise you that. Hey, look, the way I see it, you got one chance to stay out of prison. You got one chance to get to see your daughter again, and that's to come clean with us. Now, I think Dani would like you to do the right thing.",
        "Ross: I'm not going to prison.",
        "John: Then tell us the truth about your brother.",
        "Ross: If I admit to anything, I will lose Dani for sure, and...",
        "John: You're going to lose her if you don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I miss her.",
        "Blair: I know. I do, too, sweetheart. I do, too.",
        "Dani: I don't know what to do. Todd wants me, Ross wants me, but I have no idea what she wanted for me.",
        "Blair: I do. Yeah. She confided in me. She asked me to look after you. She gave me that wonderful little book that she made, with everything that I could possibly want to know about Miss Dani Rayburn. Remember?",
        "Dani: She told you who she wanted me to be with?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm, and I think deep inside, you know, too. Sweetheart, I know that you don't want to hurt anybody. I understand that. And I think that we have all been hurt, because we miss her so much and we lost her. But I'll tell you what. I can tell you this--as wacky and as crazy and impossible as Todd is, he is a good dad, and that your mom wanted you to be with him.",
        "Dani: You're sure?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: [Sighs] Let me ask you something. How's Danielle going to feel when she finds out that you and Eli changed the will and denied her mother her dying wish?",
        "Ross: She'll forgive me. She loves me.",
        "John: Ah, you got to be kidding me. She's going to forgive you for helping a serial killer?",
        "Ross: He's not a serial killer.",
        "John: At last count, your brother's killed 6 people. You can call it what you want, but you really think you can trust him?",
        "Ross: All right, look, if I tell you what I know, will it keep me out of prison? Can you make sure I have access to Dani, and that... Manning won't shut me out, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Listen, Dr. Evans, all you have to do is tell the judge that T\u00e9a wanted Dani to be with me. You know, it was her dying wish and all that kind of stuff. Okay?",
        "Greg: I'm sorry, Todd, but I've got a plane to catch and I've got a patient who needs--",
        "Todd: Listen, you bastard! You owe me, right? You lied to us about T\u00e9a. You didn't tell us that she asked for us, that she wanted us there.",
        "Greg: No--",
        "Todd: Don't--no, don't...don't try to justify yourself. You didn't tell us the truth when we needed you to that one time. Now we need you to. Now you're going to. You're going to go to that courtroom and you're going to testify on my behalf. Or I'm going to have your fingers cut off. I'm serious. You know I can. And what would that do to your patients then, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd? Todd?",
        "Todd: What was that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I'm a patient of Dr. Levin's.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brody: He's away. Anyway, he referred me to you and your office said you were seeing patients at home.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I'm working--I'm working from home right now. Um, what can I do for you?",
        "Brody: You got a couple minutes?",
        "Marty: Absolutely. Come on in.",
        "Brody: Oh, and...is this okay? I mean, I know that you and Jessica are friends.",
        "Marty: Oh, anything you say to me will be held in confidence.",
        "Brody: Right, no, I was just wondering how it would be for you. I don't want to make things difficult.",
        "Marty: Oh, thank you for asking. I'm fine. Do you want to sit?",
        "Brody: Thanks.",
        "Marty: Okay.",
        "Brody: Well, actually, I'm kind of wired.",
        "Marty: I can see that.",
        "Brody: Okay, uh... so you remember when Jessica thought she was a teenager? Of course you do. It's kind of hard to forget, right? While she was going through that, Robert Ford--let's just say he seduced her. Anyway, there is a chance that the baby she's carrying is his.",
        "Marty: I see. Um, well, have you and Jessica discussed the possibilities?",
        "Brody: I told her that I would love this baby like it's mine, and--and--and then I ran into Ford and--what do I do if I can't? What'll it do to Jess?",
        "Marty: Well, let's--let's focus on what it's doing to you right now.",
        "Brody: It's--it's the lying. I'm not a liar, and having to hide what I'm feeling and what I've done... I don't think I can do it anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Well, you know what? Brody needs to man up. I mean, I know that this isn't easy, but it sucks that Ford did what he did. But what are the chances that he's really your baby's father? It's like a 0.1% chance. And Brody loves you.",
        "Jessica: I know, but the baby, I...",
        "Natalie: When you put that baby in Brody's arms, he is going to melt. And you know it. I mean, look how he is with Bree. Honey, you're going to get through this, okay? I promise you.",
        "Jessica: How did I get so lucky to have Brody wanting to marry me and you as my sister? Will you be my maid of honor? Or is it--is it matron of honor? Are you and John getting married?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'll tell you what. We'll talk about a deal when I find out what you have to offer. I'll tell you this. If you come clean right now, Danielle will know you were one of the good guys.",

        "Ross: Yeah, whatever.",

        "Todd: Oh, well...it sounded like a woman calling my name.",
        "Greg: No, that was, um, that was my patient. She's been calling for her husband Rob all day.",

        "Greg: She's in pain. Look, if you'll excuse me...",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, all right. Yes, I'm on my way. Dude, what do I have to do to get you to come with me? To beg your patients to give you an hour off?",

        "James: Look, even if you knew what you were doing, you're not in any shape to be around an engine.",
        "Nate: I could lose the best thing that's ever happened to me. Do you know what that feels like? She's like a miracle, you know? I don't deserve her. I wasn't even looking for her. But somehow, she was there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: James kissed you? Then what?",
        "Starr: James said that he couldn't just be friends. He wanted to be more, and he knew that that wasn't possible. And it was just too painful.",
        "Cole: Starr, do you have feelings for James?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: I didn't think she'd ever leave that other guy for me, but she did and it was perfect. Until her father--the other one--showed up and sued for custody. And now some judge is going to decide whether she has to move halfway across the world. And I can't even get the stupid car to start.",
        "James: So what are you trying to say? That you'd run off with her?",
        "Nate: I would--if I didn't care about her. But her whole life is here. Everyone she loves. But unlike her father--either one of them--I can't do that to her. So I could lose her.",
        "James: I hear you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: How could you ask me something like that? After I've told him over and over again how my life is with you and Hope.",
        "Cole: I'm not saying that you've done anything wrong. You haven't. I'm just asking if you feel something for him.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: All I've ever wanted is a family of my own. I even volunteered to be Shane's father--Gigi's son. And to find out Jess was having my baby... I've never felt so good in my life.",
        "Marty: And just so I'm clear--when you're talking about lying, what exactly are you lying about?",
        "Brody: I promised Jess I would be a father to this baby, no matter what.",
        "Marty: Because...",
        "Brody: Because I love her. I want to marry her, and it's not her fault. I mean, she didn't know who I was. In her head, she was still 17.",
        "Marty: I know, and those are all good arguments, but let's talk about what you're feeling.",
        "Brody: I'm angry at Ford. It's his fault, it is not Jessica's. And I am disappointed. I wanted this baby to be mine. And I know that's not fair. I know I have no right to be angry.",
        "Marty: Why not?",
        "Brody: Be--it was an accident. It just happened. I have no right to judge her.",
        "Marty: Are you judging her?",
        "Brody: No, no, of course not. How can I? But it was only once--one time, and it never would have happened if Jessica hadn't lost her memory. I never would have--",
        "Marty: You never would have what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Ha! Married? No. John and me, we--we haven't even talked about it, you know? We just got back together.",
        "Jessica: Well, be careful. Dad might corner John like he did Brody and ask him if he's going to give his grandchild a name.",
        "Natalie: Ha! Well, let's just hope Dad doesn't bring a shotgun, because you know, then John would have to arrest him.",
        "Jessica: You know, I could just see it. Dad marching you and John to the altar with me and Brody and saying, \"Natalie, you're going to marry the father of your baby right now.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I've done some things that... let's just say I've made some bad choices. But you have to understand, I love her. I really love her. And it's just... I'm not perfect, and I know that nobody is, but Jessica is a fragile person. She lost Nash and she split apart.",
        "Marty: I don't think she's about to lose you, now, is she?",
        "Brody: Never. But if she--you know, finds out something that upsets her... the last time she was pregnant, she lost the baby. I can't take that chance.",
        "Marty: Yeah, but it seems to me Jessica's willing to take that chance with you. She told you about Ford.",
        "Brody: That's different.",
        "Marty: Is it? You are obviously a very sensitive person and you have a complicated history. Jessica trusted you to hear the truth and to work it out. Brody, she doesn't need you to be perfect. She needs you to be honest. She was brave enough to admit her mistake. Now it's your turn.",
        "Brody: I can tell her how I feel, but I can't be completely honest with her.",
        "Marty: Why not?",
        "Brody: Too many people will get hurt.",

        "Todd: This man was with my wife when she died. He knows exactly what she wanted and who Danielle should be living with.",
        "Judge Burdett: That's enough! Ms. Rayburn, I'd like you to step outside. There's no need for you to hear all this.",

        "Nate: So has Ford found a job yet?",
        "James: Not much call for filmmakers in Llanview.",
        "Nate: Uh, he's probably not interested in this, but they're hiring at the country club. It's decent pay. I could talk to the manager.",

        "Starr: And you have feelings for Hannah.",

        "Jessica: I knew it. So what do we do?",
        "Brody's voice: I have no right to judge her. Let's just say I've made some bad choices.",
        "Brody: This doesn't change how I feel about you. I love you. I always will. It just means that sometimes, I'm going to have to feel what I feel.",
        "Jessica: Um...okay. That's okay. You know what Dr. Levin would say? He would say that we just have to be honest about things, especially about how we feel. So let's make a promise. Always tell each other the truth, okay?",
        "Brody: Okay.",
