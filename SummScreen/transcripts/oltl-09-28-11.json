        "Brody: Clint.",
        "Clint: How'd you get in?",
        "Brody: Your nurse.",
        "Clint: Remind me to fire her. Why are you here?",
        "Brody: I want your blessing to marry Natalie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I wanted to tell you myself.",

        "Natalie: Look, whatever you need to say to me, go ahead.",
        "Jessica: Are you really gonna make me ask?",
        "Natalie: Ask what?",
        "Jessica: Well, let's see the ring.",

        "Mr. Heller: \"I do give and bequeath all my personal effects and all my tangible property, including automobiles owned by me and held for my personal use at the time of my death, as well as all cash on hand in bank accounts in my own name, plus stocks, securities, and holdings, including ownership of \"The Sun\" and real estate properties both foreign and domestic, indeed the entirety of my estate to my mother, Irene Manning.\"",
        "Tina: Oh, I-I-I'm sorry. C-could you read that last part again?",
        "Jack: Why would he give everything to his mother after all that she did to him?",
        "Blair: Good question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You got to bust me out.",
        "Starr: You want me to bust you out of jail?!",
        "Todd: Will you stop? What's the matter with you? You know better than that.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. I'm just surprised, that's all.",
        "Todd: Our family's in danger. Irene is out. Who knows what she's gonna do. You need to bust me out of here. You need to do it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh, come on. Let me see it.",
        "Natalie: No, Jess --",
        "Jessica: Natalie, come on.",
        "Natalie: Jess, you know --",
        "Jessica: Oh! That's a pretty, little diamond, although I think with your hand, you should really go with something a little bit bigger.",
        "Natalie: I like it.",
        "Jessica: You can't blame him, though, right? He did have to buy two rings this year. [Gasps] You should've just used mine.",
        "Natalie: Jess.",
        "Jessica: Honestly. I mean, you know, you have my fianc\u00e9. You might as well have the ring to go with him.",
        "Natalie: Look, I didn't want to make this hard on you.",
        "Jessica: Who says it is?",
        "Natalie: Jess, please, come on. I am your sister. I know you. I-I want us to be close. We've got make this right. I don't want to lose you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You got my answer earlier on the phone.",
        "Brody: I got your first reaction.",
        "Clint: I am not going to change my mind. I cannot give you my blessing.",
        "Brody: I can't accept that.",
        "Clint: Well, that's too bad. Now go on.",
        "Brody: This is for your daughter. Natalie needs your blessing, and I'm not leaving here without it.",

        "Jessica: You want me to make everything okay.",
        "Natalie: I want everything to be okay, yes.",
        "Jessica: So, you want me to make things nice for you and Brody.",
        "Natalie: That's not what I said.",
        "Jessica: Then what is it, Natalie? What do you want? How am I supposed to make it okay that you stole my fianc\u00e9?",
        "Natalie: Let's start with that. I didn't steal him, and if you could just recognize that --",
        "Jessica: Okay, well, then, what would you call it? Getting drunk and having sex with him after John rejected you?",
        "Natalie: The first time.",
        "Jessica: So when, exactly, did this blossom into love?",
        "Natalie: After Liam. After we waited for you for months. After you rejected Brody over and over --",
        "Jessica: Oh, no, no, no, no, sis. Tell the truth. If there was nothing going on between you and Brody this whole time, you decide to hop back in bed with him right before I came back -- right after John rejected you again.",
        "Natalie: That's not fair.",
        "Jessica: No, it's not fair, Natalie, but it's true. Brody is your consolation prize. You would leave him for John in a second, but you can't... 'cause John doesn't love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Mr. Heller... I'm sorry. This can't be right. Victor believed that he was Dani and Jack and Starr's father, and he knew for a fact that he was Sam's father. He loved his children. He would have provided for them.",
        "Mr. Heller: I can only tell you what is here.",
        "Blair: Well, how about how it got there?",
        "Viki: There is no way that Victor wrote that will voluntarily.",
        "Irene: You think I had a hand in this? I am as surprised as anyone.",
        "Danielle: Mom...",
        "Viki: Obviously this is your dirty work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: [Sighs] I don't think he heard. W --",
        "Todd: Irene is out now. She can hurt anyone she wants to.",
        "Starr: Yes, and I believe you, Dad. It's the prison-break part that I don't like.",
        "Todd: It's the only way to keep everybody safe.",
        "Starr: And you're positive that the police can't help with this?",
        "Todd: They can't give Irene what she wants. I'm the only one who can. And if I don't help her, she's gonna kill everyone that I love -- you, T\u00e9a, Blair, Jack, Dani, even Viki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: That's so noble, Victoria, standing up for the children. It's lovely to see how you are all so concerned... for the children.",
        "Blair: We are.",
        "Irene: As my son was concerned for me.",
        "Blair: Oh, your son didn't even know you existed before you showed up here!",
        "Viki: There is no way that Victor wrote a will leaving everything to you.",
        "Blair: That's right, because it's a fake, obviously!",
        "Tina: That's right. It's a fake. And you are a lawyer.",
        "Mr. Heller: Madam...",
        "Irene: There are copies?",
        "Mr. Heller: Of course.",
        "T\u00e9a: Then I'll be keeping this one.",
        "Blair: How could Victor leave Todd's things to anybody?",
        "T\u00e9a: You had him declared Todd Manning when he showed up in town in 2003. He was legally Todd Manning when he died.",
        "Blair: But he wasn't! Victor didn't have the right to Todd's money in the first place!",
        "Irene: That's not true. Victor Lord Sr.'s will left a fortune to his \"male heir.\" He never named Todd. So, my son Victor had as much claim to that money as Todd did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Do you know what your mom wants?",
        "Todd: Yeah. She finally told me. It's a microchip.",
        "Starr: A mi --",
        "Todd: I don't know. I-I-I don't remember ever having one. If I had it, believe me, I would give it to her. I would do anything to keep you out of harm's way.",
        "Officer: Is everything okay here?",
        "Todd: Oh, yes.",
        "Starr: Yeah, everything's great, Officer. Thank you so much.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Starr: You're positive the police can't help with this?",
        "Todd: Irene bought her way out of here.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Todd: Bo didn't want to let her go. The police can't touch her. And who knows what she's done to Louie or to the gun that can prove that I'm not the killer.",
        "Starr: Okay, so you're sure that Irene made them disappear?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Who else? I got to keep that psychopath happy. Otherwise, I go to prison, and everybody dies.",
        "Starr: When you put it like that...",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm putting it like that. Starr... you got to bust me out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Is that right? Because if my brother didn't have the right to give away this money...",
        "Irene: Then...what?",
        "Blair: She'd have to leave and find another victim.",
        "Tina: Can you tell it's a fake?",
        "Viki: Oh, Tina, for heaven's sake, just let her look.",
        "Irene: I'm afraid the outcome will be the same for you, Tina. I'm sorry, but your brothers didn't think very highly of you.",
        "Tina: And how would you know?",
        "Irene: Well, I doubt that they would have left you anything.",
        "Blair: There's no way they would've left it to you... you bitch.",
        "Irene: You'll be sorry you called me that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay, I have a better idea. We'll move everyone. We'll all move to a different location. We'll hire Shaun. We'll get more guards.",
        "Todd: Starr, that's not gonna work, and you know it. Come on. I am not letting you out of my sight. I mean, for all I know, Irene's already got her people watching you.",
        "Starr: I don't know anything about a prison break.",
        "Todd: Come on. You're -- you're a genius. If anybody can figure this out, you can. Starr... please? Daddy needs your help getting out of jail.",
        "Starr: Okay. Let's do this.",
        "Todd: Okay, so what's the big plan?",
        "Starr: I don't know. What do you think?",
        "Todd: I got nothing. All right, I haven't done this in a while.",
        "Starr: And I have?",
        "Todd: Come on, Shorty. You busted me out of jail when you were like 10.",
        "Starr: When you were in a moving van, not in a cell.",
        "Todd: Well, think.",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Todd: Could you think faster?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Did you just threaten me?",
        "Irene: That was hurtful for no reason. I have just lost my son.",
        "Viki: You used Victor his entire life.",
        "Tina: Look, we have to focus on what's important here. I-I-it's a scam, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: This will was drawn up and executed correctly, but I will be contesting it.",
        "Mr. Heller: Of course. It is your right.",
        "Viki: Irene, I don't know exactly how you did this. But be aware that we are not a bunch of passive victims that you can manipulate the way you did poor Victor. We are gonna fight this.",
        "Irene: I am the only one who truly knew him and loved him.",
        "Blair: [Scoffs]",
        "Irene: Is it so hard for you to believe that he would want to take care of me? And as you point out, this is not a room of victims. Both of these women are perfectly able to provide for their children.",
        "Tina: Uh, you know there are other people involved here.",
        "Blair: Besides, that's not the point.",
        "Danielle: He must've been so messed up when he wrote that. Mom, are you okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: Don't worry. I'm fine. And I will make sure... you get what's coming to you. Okay?",
        "Irene: Be careful what you wish for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay, here's what you're going to do. You're going to fake secondary hyperhidrosis, epigastric distress, mandible pain.",
        "Todd: Right.",
        "Starr: Right. Okay? You're gonna seem like you're having a ventricular fibrillation.",
        "Todd: What are you, pre-med?",
        "Starr: I want to be a singer.",
        "Todd: Like a singing doctor?",
        "Starr: Can we stay focused, please, okay? Is he the only guard on duty?",
        "Todd: He's the only guy I've seen all day.",
        "Starr: Okay. This might work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You have my notice that we're filing a challenge first thing tomorrow morning.",
        "Mr. Heller: Be that as it may, for tonight, I must execute the terms of the will.",
        "Blair: Well, what does that mean, exactly?",
        "T\u00e9a: He wants to hand over the property to Irene tonight.",
        "Tina: Well, stop him!",
        "Viki: Irene, if you had one shred of decency in you, you would give everything over to your son's children.",
        "Tina: Yeah, and to, uh, you know, loved ones? People he might actually want to give the money to.",
        "Irene: Victor made it quite clear who he trusts with his fortune.",
        "Tina: [Scoffs]",
        "Mr. Heller: These are the stock certificates and the deeds.",
        "T\u00e9a: I am telling you that I will be filing a motion to contest first thing tomorrow morning.",
        "Mr. Heller: At that point, the court may appoint a special master to secure the property. In the meantime --",
        "Blair: You're just gonna hand everything over to this woman?",
        "Mr. Heller: As of tonight, it is legally hers. I have little choice. Ms. Manning... this belongs to you. In addition to the deeds and the legal documents, there is a list of the assets and where they're located.",
        "Irene: That would include this property, correct?",
        "Mr. Heller: That is correct.",
        "Tina: Um, is -- is there, um, anything you need...help with, Mom?",
        "Blair: Wow. That was fast.",
        "Mr. Heller: Good night.",
        "T\u00e9a: Dani, grab my laptop. I'll start writing the motion right now.",
        "Irene: I'm sorry. But you're trespassing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Excuse me?",
        "Irene: As Mr. Heller said, as of tonight, everything, including this house, is mine. You and Danielle have to move out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So you hit the floor with all your symptoms? You got them?",
        "Todd: Right. No. Wait. What are the symptoms?",
        "Starr: Dad, you fake like you're in pain here and in your jaw. Fake it like you're having a heart attack. You got it?",
        "Todd: A heart attack?",
        "Starr: Now I'll call the guards, they'll come in, we'll take them out and run.",
        "Todd: Whoa, wait a minute. That's your big plan? Come on. I could've come up with better -- what are you doing? Why -- what's the -- what did I do?",
        "Starr: Well, it's for the hyperhidrosis. Sweating -- it's part of the heart attack.",
        "Todd: I don't think this is gonna work. You really think this is gonna work?",
        "Starr: You have a better idea?",
        "Todd: No, no, heart attacks are -- are for old guys. For people like Clint Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: It was hard enough for Jessie to accept you and Natalie living together, but this -- that's a step too far.",
        "Brody: We don't mean to hurt her.",
        "Clint: How did you expect her to feel? Brody, she loved you. And now you want to marry her sister? She's not only losing you. She's losing her twin. Dear God, you have torn these girls apart!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: That's a disgusting lie, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: So John does love you? After everything that you've done?",
        "Natalie: I'm saying that I wouldn't leave Brody. We're a family. And maybe you don't like how that happened, but there's a lot of things that have happened lately that we don't like, and we can't change them.",
        "Jessica: So great, Natalie! Have you thought about how this is gonna work out, you know, at Thanksgiving and whatnot, when we're all sitting around the table -- you know, Mom, Dad, you and Brody and I, all holding hands, saying how grateful we are for one another?",
        "Natalie: I would like that.",
        "Jessica: I bet you would. Do you not understand how unhappy the family is with this? I mean, Dad didn't give you his blessing. Do you not get what a big deal that is?",
        "Natalie: Mom will accept us.",
        "Jessica: To be polite, I'm sure she will.",
        "Natalie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Jessica: I grew up with her, Natalie. I know her. Do you really think that she's gonna be okay with you betraying me like this?",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God. This is all about Jessica.",
        "Jessica: I'm talking about my family.",
        "Natalie: This is my family, too!",
        "Jessica: You came into town to destroy us. Well, congratulations. Mission accomplished.",
        "Natalie: Really? Wow. You're gonna play that one now?",
        "Jessica: I'm not playing.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, Jess. You've been holding on to that for a really, really long time. I wanted us to be close. I wanted us to be good sisters, but I can't do this anymore. I'm done. I'm not your doormat. You don't get to just wipe your shoes all over me and stomp on me whenever you feel like it, like I'm nothing.",
        "Jessica: You slept with my fianc\u00e9 when I was sick. I mean, what kind of trailer trash does that?",
        "Natalie: Well, at least I own what I do. I don't send out my alter ego to do my dirty work and then hide behind mental illness.",
        "Jessica: I don't hide.",
        "Natalie: No. No, are you ever responsible for anything that you do, Jessica? I mean, you don't know if you can forgive me for falling for the father of my child, yet you can lock me in a basement for months, try to kill me, and I had to forgive you because you were \"sick.\"",
        "Jessica: That was Tess, Natalie!",
        "Natalie: Which means it was you!",
        "Jessica: You don't understand.",
        "Natalie: N-no, I perfectly understand it. I just don't buy it.",
        "Jessica: Do you think that I would actually want to kill someone?",
        "Natalie: I don't care, because you like being Tess. You enjoy torturing Brody, rejecting him, humiliating him, and getting to say and do whatever you secretly wanted for months!",
        "Jessica: Right, right. You've got me all figured out.",
        "Natalie: Yes! Yes, I do. And it gave you the perfect excuse to be a bitch.",
        "Jessica: You slept with my fianc\u00e9. I didn't need an excuse to be a bitch.",
        "Natalie: Then Brody turned to someone that cared about him.",
        "Jessica: Talk about an excuse! You know, what kind of trashy person --",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God! You say that one more time --",
        "Jessica: It's true, Natalie! And that's all you're ever gonna be is trash! And I wish to God you never found out that you were a Buchanan!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I waited for Jessica. You know that. What you didn't see was every time she ran off with some other guy.",
        "Clint: Jessie was sick! You knew she had an illness when you two got together.",
        "Brody: I did. I thought I could handle it. I'd had my own problems. I'd seen Tess come out before. I thought I could handle it.",
        "Clint: When you found out you couldn't, you turned to Natalie?",
        "Brody: We didn't mean to fall in love, but we did. We have a son. We have everything I ever wanted.",
        "Clint: You could've had a son with Jessica, too, but you didn't want to love a child that wasn't your blood.",
        "Brody: You have no idea how wrong you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: We were a happy family before you got here, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: God!",
        "Jessica: You are nothing but a selfish, greedy little hustler, and nobody wanted you.",
        "Natalie: Least of all you.",
        "Jessica: You're right. Do you really think that we sat around the Thanksgiving dinner table thinking, \"Where's Natalie? Gosh, things would be a lot better if Natalie were here.\" Don't you remember how it was when you first got here? Mom wanted nothing to do with you! And Dad -- I mean, he was so upset that he left town for a few years!",
        "Natalie: You know what?! I am just as much a part of this family as you are! In fact, no, I am more a part of this family, because Dad isn't even your father! Mitch Laurence is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Guard! Guard, please, my dad! My dad! I need your help!",
        "Officer #1: What's wrong?",
        "Starr: We were in the middle of talking, and he got sweaty, and, um -- and dizzy. And now look at him!",
        "Officer #1: It's a trick, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: No, look at him! Are you serious?!",
        "Officer #1: I see he's trying to fake us out.",
        "Starr: No, he's so sick! He's been so, so sick!",
        "Officer #1: There's nothing on his record that indicates he had any --",
        "Starr: He's been locked up and kept away for eight years! There is no record of him! He needs CPR right now!",
        "Officer #1: I'll call a doctor.",
        "Starr: No! No, there's no time for a doctor.",
        "Officer: #1: A doctor will know what to do, okay?",
        "Starr: Please, he is my dad! Don't let him die! Please!",

        "T\u00e9a: Which will be confetti by the time I'm done with it.",

        "Blair: Were you always this shameless, and I just don't remember?",
        "Tina: Were you always this unfeeling? You know, I don't know why either one of my brothers ever married you. You know, I warned Todd against her.",
        "Viki: Oh, Tina, really!",
        "Irene: She loves her family. There's nothing bad about that. Tina, I'm so sorry for the trouble that my absence may have caused you.",

        "Clint: Are you trying to make me really mad?",
        "Brody: No, sir. What I'm saying is things change. That doesn't mean you want to hurt the people you love, but sometimes you have to move on.",
        "Clint: And sometimes the price is too high. I don't know if Jessica can survive what you and Natalie are doing to her.",

        "Blair: Oh, my gosh, look. There's stocks, bonds. I'm sure she's not picky.",

        "Irene: Well, it's solid gold, so I'm sure it's worth a couple of hundred dollars. But it's the sentimental value that's important. Don't you think?",
        "Blair: Oh, of course she does. Tina, you're rich. What do you think? Tina, that is a special, special gift, a real family heirloom. Wow! You must feel so loved.",
        "Tina: Yeah. I don't even know what to say.",
        "Irene: Well... I'm glad to make you happy, Tina. And I don't wish to be enemies with anyone here.",
        "Viki: Then why don't you give your son's family what they rightfully deserve? That would be the simple solution.",
        "Irene: Yes, but a complicated request. [Sighs] T\u00e9a, I have to admit that Victor loved you and your daughter, so... you are welcome to stay here tonight and leave in the morning.",

        "T\u00e9a: Well, it'd be better if she'd left it, but there should be an inventory of its contents filed along with -- oh, yes? I, um... who's on the, uh, bench tonight? Okay, I need an emergency stay against the execution of a will. No, I will hold. You did hear me say the word \"emergency,\" correct?",

        "Clint: Is that a threat?",
        "Brody: It's what I'm afraid of. Natalie and I have a second chance to be happy, and we're taking it. You have a new heart and a chance to make things right with your family. What are you gonna do about that?",

Why?! Because I forgave you, and you tried to kill me. But you -- you don't know. You can't forgive me and Brody for salvaging a little bit of happiness out of this mess that you created when you -- when you checked out again?! I mean, what the hell is wrong with you?!",

        "Viki: Of course, you had a choice. You did not have to let Tess blackmail you.",

        "Tina: You have no idea what my life is like, Viki. And that was your choice. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go check on David Vickers. Jack, where did you put her?",
