        "In the \"shoot out\" at Llantano Mountain State Park, both Rex and Brody have been fatally wounded. Bo and Gigi are worried about Rex. But Shane is only concerned about Brody and wonders why nobody else cares about his \"dad\". After Ray Montez has \"won\" custody of Langston and Clint expresses his \"gratitude and congratulations\" for a job well done, Cole overhears their conversation and will not let them hurt his friend, Langston. Addie goes to visit Dorian in jail, knowing that something has happened and promises her sister she will protect her and prevent Langston from being taken from them. Marcie can sense that her friend Rex is in danger and well as Starr's family. And so can Michael."

        "Dorian: Let me out of here! Do you hear me? Let me out! This is -- this is an outrage! I am Dr. Dorian Lord. Don't you know who I am?",
        "Guard: How can I not know? You've been hollering about it ever since I brought you in.",
        "Dorian: Oh, and I will continue to do so until someone who has some authority around here listens to me.",
        "Guard: You got a visitor.",
        "Dorian: Oh, finally. My attorney has rectified this insanity and he's going to get me out of this place! Hallelujah!",
        "Addie: Sorry, Dorian, it's only me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You know my mom was putting Jack and Sam to sleep and then I realized that we hadn't had any dinner. Do you guys want to be alone? I'll leave you alone.",
        "Langston: No, no. I want everyone that I love right here with me. I can't believe my uncle's going to take me away to Colombia. If somebody doesn't stop him, I'm never going to see you guys again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Ray, job well done. I can't thank you enough for everything that you've accomplished.",
        "Ray: I can't believe how fast your courts work.",
        "Clint: Yeah, this is going even better than I thought it would.",
        "Ray: I'm just happy that it's over.",
        "Clint: It's not over quite yet. Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: Blair called and said you'd gotten yourself arrested for contempt of court.",
        "Dorian: Addie, please, you've got to help me get out of here before that awful Ray Montez takes my Langston out of the country to Colombia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Michael.",
        "Michael: Hi.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Michael: I just wanted to see you -- how you were.",

        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Michael: You never told me what happened.",
        "Marcie: Oh, Gigi and Brody -- they're dealing with some stuff and I stupidly got in the middle of it.",
        "Michael: What? And you ended up with a head injury? What was going on?",
        "Marcie: I'm fine, Michael. Really, I'm really fine. I just -- I'm just hoping that Gigi was able to work it out with Brody and that everybody's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Freeze! Put the gun down! Put it down now!",
        "Brody: I had to do it. I had to shoot him.",

        "Gigi: Oh, Rex, baby. Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Why would Brody take off with Shane and not tell anybody?",
        "Marcie: He was afraid that they were going to take Shane from him.",
        "Michael: Why? He's Shane's father.",
        "Marcie: He was just worried, you know, because Gigi and Rex are getting closer maybe, so --",
        "Michael: I mean, that shouldn't make any difference.",
        "Marcie: Brody, I -- you know, I don't know what to tell you, Mike. He's just -- he's gone through a lot lately and I just don't think he's thinking real clearly.",
        "Michael: Gigi must be a wreck.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I know. Well, it is the worst thing in the world to lose a child, isn't it?",
        "Michael: I'm just glad that you're okay.",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Michael: Yeah. I want to look at that.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, it's going to hurt. Please, don't.",

        "Bo: Bag this. Oh, man.",
        "Gigi: Is he... dear God, please tell me he's still alive.",
        "Bo: Come on, Balsom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: Blair is working her tushy off to get you out of here, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: We've got to get Langston away from that man before he spirits her out of the country.",
        "Addie: He's letting her stay at the house tonight.",
        "Dorian: Oh, thank heaven. I really didn't think I'd ever see her again.",
        "Addie: That's why I came here. When I heard you'd been arrested --",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, don't go there, Addie, really. The last thing I want from you, especially you or anybody for that matter is -- is a lecture about how I always act before I think, how my emotions rule me.",
        "Addie: That's not why I'm here.",
        "Dorian: Then why are you here?",
        "Addie: I wanted you to know. If I'd been in your shoes, I'd have done the same damn thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Hey, hey, don't talk like that, okay? It's not like we're never going to see each other again.",
        "Markko: Yeah, Colombia isn't Mars, you know. People can visit there. But, you know, we won't have to do that because there is no way you are going there with your uncle.",
        "Langston: You guys heard the judge. I have to go with my Uncle Ray. Starr, you always have a game plan. What do I do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I was just on my way to my bedroom.",
        "Clint: Cole, there's someone here I want you to meet. This is Mr. Montez, a business associate of mine.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I already know Mr. Montez. I saw him in court. He is Langston's uncle. Did he tell you he wants to move Langston away from all the people she cares about and move her to Colombia?",
        "Clint: Umm, we'll discuss this a little later. I want to have a word with Cole.",
        "Ray: Sure.",
        "Clint: Have a seat, Cole.",
        "Cole: How can you do this?",
        "Clint: Do what?",
        "Cole: I know what I saw.",
        "Clint: What is it you think you saw?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I'm so sorry. I don't have any big ideas, Langston. Look where my actions got me anyway.",
        "Langston: I can't believe Dorian is in jail. She'd be able to do something. I can't believe that judge, either. I don't know how to fight this.",
        "Markko: I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I've got a pulse.",
        "Gigi: Oh, thank God.",
        "Bo: It's weak.",
        "Gigi: But he's alive, at least. Balsom, you hang in there, ok? Don't you leave me. Not now!",
        "Bo: Get the EMTs up here!",
        "Officer: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used --",
        "Shane: No, no, no, no! You can't arrest my dad.",
        "Bo: Help is on the way, Balsom. Stay with us.",
        "Gigi: Come on!",
        "Shane: Dad! Dad!",
        "Brody: How is he? How's the kid?",
        "Shane: Dad, Dad I'm all right.",
        "Bo: Where the hell are the EMTs?",
        "Gigi: Too much blood.",
        "Bo: We've got to stop that.",
        "Gigi: Honey, I'm right here, and you're gonna be ok, ok?",
        "Bo: Look, can you give me a towel or a T-shirt, something like that? Hang in there, Balsom. Hold on just a little bit longer.",
        "Gigi: Here, here!",
        "Bo: Good. Come on, Balsom, stay with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: You know how to fix this?",
        "Markko: Yeah, yeah. Here's the deal. The one way we can stop your uncle from taking you is if you go away first.",
        "Langston: Go where?",
        "Markko: Somewhere where the dude can't find you.",
        "Starr: Wait, you're thinking of running?",
        "Markko: Well, the judge won't listen and neither will her Uncle Ray, and Dr. Lord is in the slammer. This is the only thing we can do.",
        "Langston: \"We\"?",
        "Markko: You're not gonna do this alone. But we've gotta leave now. We've got to get a move on, get a head start --",
        "Langston: Well, wait! We can't just leave now. I have to think about this.",
        "Markko: There's no time. Langston, your uncle will be back here tomorrow morning to put you on a plane to Colombia. You'll cover for us, right? The way we did for you and Cole?",
        "Starr: Markko, that didn't exactly work out.",
        "Markko: So, we'll plan better. We can do this.",
        "Langston: Cole, I know we can, but you'd be leaving your family. I'd still be leaving everybody else.",
        "Markko: We'd still be together.",
        "Langston: Yeah, until they track us down.",
        "Markko: Well, what are we supposed to do? Just -- just sit here and let her Uncle Ray do whatever he wants?",
        "Starr: No, Markko, that's not -- You know, this is all coming at a really strange time, ok? It just so happens that your uncle comes to town now when Aunt Dorian is about to adopt you?",
        "Langston: You know, I've been thinking about that, too. The more I do, the more I think that he didn't just show up out of nowhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I saw you shaking hands with that Montez guy, telling him he did a good job?",
        "Clint: Yeah, that's right, he did. That's because we've been involved in a business venture together.",
        "Cole: What business venture. The guy's been locked up for two years now.",
        "Clint: He was falsely accused.",
        "Cole: Ok, to me it seems it's kind of a big coincidence, isn't it? The guy you're doing business with turns out to be Langston's uncle. He then shows up and says he wants to take her away to Colombia?",
        "Clint: Do you want something to drink?",
        "Cole: No, Clint. I'd rather have some answers actually. I mean how can you be doing business with a guy that's doing what he's doing to Langston and all the people who care about her? Wait, or is that it?",
        "Clint: Is what it?",
        "Cole: I'm not stupid. The deal you're working on with Montez is Langston.",
        "Clint: What is it you're saying?",
        "Cole: You want Langston's uncle to take her away from Dr. Lord, don't you? To get back at her for taking your company away from you. Am I right, huh? You're trying to destroy Dr. Lord.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: You love Langston so much. She's as much your daughter as Blair is mine. I once let Blair go. I should have fought like a tiger. I should have been like you.",
        "Dorian: It wasn't your fault.",
        "Addie: I know. I wasn't strong enough to fight, and Blair and I both suffered for it. I'm so lucky Blair understood and came back into my life, but we can never make up for those years we lost. I'm not going to let that happen with you and Langston.",
        "Dorian: I really appreciate the support, Addie, but what can you do?",
        "Addie: My last name is Cramer, isn't it?",
        "Dorian: Yes.",
        "Addie: Well, then. There's always something I could do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You're really getting ready for this baby, huh?",
        "Marcie: Well, yeah, Starr's due date is in November. And I just wanted to have the crib ready in case, you know, she delivers early. I haven't gotten very far, though. We did do it together last time. Here, is this everything that you need?",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Marcie: Yes? Ok.",
        "Michael: So, I was talking with Charlie earlier.",
        "Marcie: I know. I saw you, remember? Yeah.",
        "Michael: He thinks that -- look, okay -- hydrogen peroxide does not sting.",
        "Marcie: What does Charlie think? Huh?",
        "Michael: He thinks that he still has a shot with Viki.",
        "Marcie: Well, um, I don't really blame Viki for getting angry. I mean, Charlie lied about stuff that was really important, but to just end it there, you know, they were really good together, and that's hard to find, isn't it? Someone who makes you feel and makes you feel like smiling every time you see them.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I think that's what Charlie's counting on, you know, Viki realizing how rare that is and figuring out that when you have somebody like that in your life, you need to hold on to them with everything that you got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Can you give me another shirt? He's bled through this one.",
        "Bo: Where the hell's the bus?",
        "Officer: They said the road's so narrow they're having a hard time getting through.",
        "Second Officer: What do I do with soldier boy, Commissioner?",
        "Shane: His name's Lieutenant Brody Lovett and he's a war hero.",
        "Bo: Take him downtown and book him.",
        "Shane: No! This was an accident. My dad didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Gigi: Shane, stay here. There's so much blood.",
        "Bo: If we don't get him out of here, he's going to bleed out or he's going to go into shock.",
        "Gigi: What do we do?",
        "Bo: We're not waiting any longer. Help me get him up.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Bo: Balsom.",
        "Gigi: Oh, oh, baby.",
        "Bo: You're not going to die on me, not on my watch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Are you going to put that bandage on? I mean, that's why you're here, right?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Boom.",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Michael: I got to go to the hospital.",
        "Marcie: Sure.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: So my attorney is trying to do everything he can to -- to stop that monster who calls himself Montez from spiriting Langston out of the country, but time's running out and I don't know what else to do.",
        "Addie: You can fight.",
        "Dorian: How can I do that from in here?",
        "Addie: That's where I come in.",
        "Dorian: Addie, that's really sweet, but, honey, I do not think baking a cake and putting a chisel in it is going to work.",
        "Addie: I thought of that, but the heat's on to that bit.",
        "Dorian: The heat?",
        "Addie: Anyway, I'm not sweet, simple Addie anymore. You've been fighting for me your whole life. Now it's my turn to fight for you. You know my list? A new entry has just moved to the top. Keep Langston in the fold, no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You don't think it's a coincidence that your uncle showed up when he did?",
        "Langston: No, I don't. It was that psychic Delphina telling me that I wasn't alone. That's what started this whole thing.",
        "Markko: The whack job conjured the guy up or something?",
        "Langston: No, but remember when I started trying to look up any family I might have?",
        "Starr: Yeah, but you didn't send him one of those letters, right? I mean, that's what you told me.",
        "Langston: Yeah, no, I didn't, but I wanted it so much -- I think I made it happen.",
        "Markko: That's a crock.",
        "Langston: Okay, well, why else would he be here then?",
        "Markko: The dude just got out of prison. He needed a new start in life and your parents left you a lot of money.",
        "Langston: Oh, God.",
        "Markko: All I know is this is not your fault.",
        "Starr: Markko's right, okay? You did not make this guy just appear, even though that would be really great because you could send him back to where he came from. God, if only we knew somebody that could do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I'm not out to destroy Dorian. I don't do things like that. But if I were, could you blame me? Cole, she used a loophole in the company bylaws to take away everything that my father spent a lifetime building.",
        "Cole: Okay, so why are you doing it?",
        "Clint: Let me ask you something. Do you miss your dad?",
        "Cole: Of course I do.",
        "Clint: Yeah, so you loved him, didn't you?",
        "Cole: A lot.",
        "Clint: What if he had given you something that he treasured, something that he wanted you to pass down to your children and to their children? Would you do everything you could to hold onto that?",
        "Cole: Well, I've never been put in that position.",
        "Clint: Haven't you? What about your child, huh? That's your father's blood. That's your father's legacy. I know you fought to keep that baby and how hard it was for you to give it all up. You know what I'm thinking? You and I -- we're not that different.",
        "Cole: I don't know about that. But what I do know is Langston's my friend and she's a mess right now. Some lawyer says she has to move away to Colombia with some guy she just met. So I'm going to tell Dr. Lord about you and Langston's uncle.",
        "Clint: Son -- I don't think you want to do that.",

        "EMT: G.S.W. to the abdomen, upper left flank, no exit wound. Pressure's 50 over palp, heart rate's 170. Excessive hemorrhaging. His GCS is a seven. Doctor: Get him into the trauma bay and do a fast exam. Spin a crit, hang two units of packed red --",
        "Shane: Mom, I want to see Dad. Where did they take him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well, look who's here? Didn't I once drag you out of the dumpster? What did you do now?",
        "Brody: I did what I had to do. I followed the code.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: We can't see Brody right now.",
        "Shane: Where is he?",
        "Gigi: Right where he should be, Shane.",
        "Michael: Whoa, Gigi.",
        "Bo: It's Rex Balsom.",
        "Michael: Hey, what do we got?",
        "Doctor: Abdominal G.S.W. Class III hemorrhagic shock, uh, no exit wound. Pressure's down to 60 over 30. Fast exam showed free blood in the abdomen.",
        "Michael: When did this happen?",
        "Bo: About a half hour ago, maybe a little more.",
        "Doctor: The golden hour is passing by.",
        "Michael: Right, let's go to work.",
        "Bo: No, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: I want to see him.",
        "Bo: No, stay here. You don't -- no, not now.",
        "Gigi: What did he mean by the golden hour? What does that mean? Bo, tell me. I want to know everything.",
        "Bo: It's a term that, uh, medics used in Vietnam. It refers to the time you've got after you get hit, uh, that determines whether you make it or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Who writes these things? \"Using the Allen wrench.\" What is the Allen wrench?",
        "Marcie: Okay, I can do this. Again, all right, it, it, it -- how hard can it be, Marcie? It doesn't have to be a two-person job. You can -- you can handle this. You got this, right? At least you've got to get used to it.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: What is going on, Bo? Why won't anybody tell us anything?",
        "Bo: They will when they have something to tell.",
        "Gigi: But that golden hour thing, there isn't much time.",
        "Bo: Look, Balsom's got the best that this hospital's got working on him right now, and he's young and he's healthy.",
        "Shane: Mom? Mom? Mom! When can we see Dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: We can't. He's in too bad of shape.",
        "Shane: I know. They threw him in jail.",

        "Shane: Who else would I mean?",

        "Bo: I'm going to see if I can find out anything about Balsom.",

        "Brody: I saved him. This time I saved him.",
        "Dorian: Guard. That man that you brought in here, what did you bring him in for?",
        "Guard: He shot some guy named Rex Balsom.",

        "Michael: I'm not going to lie to you. He's really bad.",
        "Bo: How bad?",
        "Michael: Rex has lost a tremendous amount of blood. The bullet's still in there. There is free blood in his abdomen, and there's been damage to his spleen.",
        "Bo: But there's something else, right?",
        "Michael: We're worried about his brain. The EMT said that he was essentially unresponsive at the scene, but we're going to have to skip the head ct because he's not stable enough.",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God.",
        "Michael: All right, we're going to get him up to the O.R., we're going to do an exploratory lap to open him up, we're going to get the bullet out of there, we're going to assess the trauma, and then, depending on the severity, we might have to do a splenectomy to take out part of the spleen.",
        "Gigi: Okay, Michael, straight up. Will Rex pull through this?",
        "Michael: The doctor on call is the best.",
        "Gigi: That doesn't answer my question.",

        "Addie: You really are worried.",

        "Addie: I'll call her, too.",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, no. Please, Addie. Addie, do not call Adriana, not until we know for certain. We don't want to worry her unnecessarily.",
        "Addie: Rex was shot, Dorian. She'd want to know.",
        "Dorian: Okay, but choose your words very carefully, because Adriana is going to be devastated.",
        "Addie: What's the matter with that judge that put you in here? How could he not see what a loving mother you are?",
        "Dorian: I just can't stand it. Adriana and Langston need me, and -- and I can't be there for them.",

        "Cole: So give me one reason why I shouldn't tell everyone that you're screwing up Langston to nail Dr. Lord?",
        "Clint: For the simple reason that it's not true. I am not involved in any dealings that would hurt Langston. You're not afraid of me, are you?",
        "Cole: No, Sir.",
        "Clint: Well, that's good. Because I like you, Cole, and I've enjoyed having you around here. You've like living here, haven't you?",
        "Cole: Yeah.",
        "Clint: Mm-hmm. Nora and I have been good to you, and given you everything you need? You're a bright young man. You've got a wonderful future in front of you. And maybe that future would include the Buchanan family, huh? You know something, Cole? I value loyalty. I reward loyalty. You hear what I'm saying, don't you?",
