        "Blair: Get out of my way. I swear, if it's too late to stop this wedding, I am gonna kill you. [Gasps] Oh, my God, they're already to the rings!",
        "Todd: Ready.",
        "Justice: The rings you exchange and which you will wear are a symbol of the shared love that will sustain you as husband and wife.",
        "Blair: No. No, no.",
        "Justice: What we join here and now through your vows, let no one tear asunder.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "[Air horn blasts]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Dad, make it stop.",
        "[Air horn continues]",
        "Rex: Is anyone else hearing that?",
        "Gigi: What is that noise?",
        "[Air horn and shouting stop]",
        "Todd: Jeez.",
        "Jack: It sounded like a dying unicorn.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry, sweetie. It wasn't a unicorn. It was a cat being strangled to death. All right. Let's go.",
        "Justice: Uh, if anyone knows of any reason--",
        "Todd: Now, you already said that already. God, does anyone here have a reason why we shouldn't do this? Speak now or ever--right? Okay? Can we skip on down? Let's go. Quit stalling. Marry us.",
        "T\u00e9a: Um...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: All right. I'm deaf. Thank you.",
        "Blair: Yeah. There's got to be an extra set of keys in here somewhere. Uh! Hell, I'd take an oar, anything to get us back to shore.",
        "Ross: What, do you really think we're gonna get from here to there in time to stop the wedding?",
        "Blair: Oh, you better hope so. Otherwise, there's gonna be a watery grave for you, you hear me? Oh...keys. Keys.",
        "Ross: Uh! Uh! So, what are you hoping to find?",
        "Blair: Anything that will get us back to shore.",
        "Ross: [Laughs] What happened to your celebrated swimming ability?",
        "Blair: I will knock you out if you don't help me look.",
        "Ross: Oh, Jackpot.",
        "Blair: Oh, God, get out of my way.",
        "Ross: It's not like we're in any danger out here. I'll have you know, I'm an accomplished sailor.",
        "Blair: Ha! This from a man who was shipwrecked on a deserted island?",
        "Ross: That was Todd's fault...",
        "Blair: Right.",
        "Ross: Idiot. Look. Why don't we just kick back, relax, and raise a toast to your newfound freedom from your obsession from Todd?",
        "Blair: I want out of here! Help me get out of here.",
        "Ross: Your ex-husband is marrying my current wife. You think that I don't get that it's tough, huh? T\u00e9a doesn't want me, okay, just like Todd doesn't want you.",
        "Blair: Seconds away from marrying that lying bitch.",
        "Ross: It's over, okay? You lost.",
        "Blair: Speak for yourself.",
        "Ross: Ay! Uh huh huh!",
        "Blair: Oh, for the love of God, Todd, don't do it. Oh, don't do it.",

        "T\u00e9a: I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and--oh. Love and--oh, I'm sorry. Um, nerves.",
        "Todd: Trust.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, love and trust. Okay. I give you this ring as a symbol of my love and trust. I commit my heart and soul to you. I ask that you wear this ring as a reminder of the vows we have taken today, our wedding day.",
        "Todd: Ha ha! T\u00e9a, I ask you to wear this ring as a symbol of my love and trust. I commit my heart and soul to you and please-- \"please wear this ring as a reminder of the vows that we've spoken today,\" our latest, last, and best wedding day.",

        "Schuyler: Wow, don't you look dressy?",
        "Gigi: No good?",
        "Schuyler: No. It's great. It's really great.",
        "Gigi: It's just too much, yeah?",
        "Schuyler: For me, no. No.",
        "Gigi: Well, it's for the big to-do at ultraviolet. Rex booked Lionel Richie, and I heard that he's bringing Jeremih.",
        "Schuyler: \"Birthday Sex\"? Get out.",
        "Gigi: Excuse me?",
        "Schuyler: Jeremih.",
        "Gigi: How do you know this stuff?",
        "Schuyler: Ah, well, there's this thing. It's called a radio, and what you do--",
        "Gigi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm more of a \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" kind of girl, anyway.",
        "Schuyler: You know, it's gonna be a great show.",
        "Gigi: Are you sure you'll be okay here?",
        "Schuyler: Oh, God, go. Go. Have fun. Just, you know, don't forget to pour one out for your little homie who couldn't make it.",
        "Gigi: God, Schuyler, I didn't even think about that. I can call around and see.",
        "Schuyler: Don't even think about it. You've done so much for me already, like hooking me up with this job. Come on.",
        "Gigi: Well, we needed the help.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, but seriously, I wouldn't have considered taking it without your okay, and I'm not gonna keep it without Rex's.",
        "Gigi: Deal. As a matter of fact, I will tell Rex tonight over a whiskey sour and some-- well, it's not his birthday, but--",
        "Schuyler: La la la la la...",
        "Gigi: You started it.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Did I just hear you say Schuyler got a job at Rodi's?",
        "Kim: Oh, my God, was I talking that loud?",
        "Rex: Don't know your own strength, huh?",
        "Kim: It's true. I saw it with my own eyes. Guy got hired on the spot, and Gigi was all for it.",
        "Rex: Do you two ever stop?",
        "Stacy: Us two? What did I do?",
        "Rex: 3 words--give it up.",
        "Stacy: Excuse me?",
        "Kim: Believe what you want, but maybe instead of focusing on Schuyler's new job, you should concentrate on your own and reboot the sound system, unless you want to treat Lionel Richie with the same feedback we just heard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I can't believe that this is happening. This is really happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justice: Remember the promises you've made to each other today. Keep them close in your heart but most of all, live them each and every day.",
        "Ross: Blair, give me the binocs.",
        "Blair: Uhh!",
        "Justice: By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.",
        "Blair: Wake up, Todd! Don't do it!",
        "[Applause]",
        "Ross: You all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justice: I now present to you for the first time--",
        "Todd: Third time.",
        "Justice: Third and final time-- Mr. and Mrs. Todd Manning.",

        "Ross: Blair, trust me, you're gonna have bigger and better moments.",
        "Blair: And here's one of them now.",

        "Langston: I think I definitely got some couch burn.",
        "Markko: Sorry about that.",
        "Langston: Well, maybe next time, we can make it to the bedroom.",
        "Markko: Hey, remind me to hit this couch with a little freshener before Starr and Cole come back. What? Got to make sure I cover all the bases.",
        "Langston: I'm just surprised you know what freshener is.",
        "Markko: Hey, don't underestimate the kid. I'm a college freshman now living on my own in the big, bad world.",
        "Langston: Big and bad, huh? Getting sprung from Llanfair really suits you.",
        "Markko: Does it?",
        "Langston: You know how they say inmates fresh out of prison can be.",
        "Markko: Well, Llanfair wasn't exactly prison. Viki is pretty amazing for letting me stay there. I mean, she put up with me for a whole summer.",
        "Langston: \"Viki\"? You call her Viki?",
        "Markko: Yeah. She said I could.",
        "Langston: So, are you thinking about other women right now?",
        "Markko: Well, at least I'm not thinking about prisoners.",
        "Langston: Well, you don't have a choice because you're my prisoner, big boy. Yeah. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.",
        "Radio announcer: Hey, guys, it's Carolina Bermudez. Coming up, the hit single by Lionel Richie, who'll be playing at Ultraviolet tonight, and I have 4 tickets for the lucky 100th caller who can answer this question. What Lionel Richie song played in the movie \"Election\"?",
        "Langston: Wait. We were just talking about that. \"Three Times a Lady,\" right?",
        "Markko: Yeah. Good job. So--",
        "Langston: Okay. I have to be 100th caller.",
        "Markko: But I want to do the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Buckle up, sit back, and enjoy the ride.",
        "Gigi: Oh, thanks. Hi, gorgeous.",
        "Rex: Hey, you came.",
        "Gigi: Of course I came.",
        "Rex: I thought you were gonna be stuck at work.",
        "Gigi: I almost was. We were short-staffed, as usual, but at the last minute, we got some help, and I finally got to blow that pop stand. Honey, you are really reeling them in. The line is down the block.",
        "Rex: It is?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Rex: Hey, hey, hey, no tabs tonight. Running cards will take forever. Everybody pays cash as they go, okay? Got it?",
        "Bartender: Got it.",
        "Rex: Great.",
        "Gigi: Anything I can do to help?",
        "Rex: No. Yeah. Um, actually-- no. Forget it.",
        "Gigi: What's wrong?",
        "Rex: Um, well, at the risk of sounding jealous and paranoid, I need to know, did Schuyler get a job at Rodi's today? Did you help him get it?",
        "Stacy: Ka-boom.",
        "Kim: And that was just the beginning. Now we set off the chain reaction.",
        "Stacy: Wait. Where you going?",
        "Kim: To ask your ex-boyfriend out on a date.",
        "Stacy: Oh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you all so much for coming. I realize we may not be the most popular couple in Llanview, but today you made me-- you made us feel like we were part of the family. Thank you.",
        "Viki: It was a beautiful ceremony.",
        "Cristian: Seemed a little touch-and-go for a minute there.",
        "Todd: All right, so everyone has champagne?",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen. It wouldn't be a Delgado-Manning wedding if we didn't keep you on your toes, right?",
        "Todd: Well, I owed you one from the last one. Cheers.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Laughs]",
        "Layla: What happened the last time?",
        "T\u00e9a: The groom showed up in a glass coffin. It all went downhill from there.",
        "Cole: Your dad is having nothing to do with planning our wedding.",
        "Charlie: You know, I think maybe it's time for Jack's speech here. I know for a fact that Jack has been putting a lot of work into this, so why don't we all give him our full attention, okay?",
        "Jack: I forgot what I was gonna say.",
        "Viki: Where's your paper?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Viki: It's all right, sweetheart. You speak from the heart, and you'll be fine, okay? Go ahead.",
        "Jack: Dad...",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Jack: I'm real happy for you.",
        "Todd: Thanks, buddy.",
        "Jack: For once, you didn't screw up.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha!",
        "Jack: Oh, and, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes?",
        "Jack: Thanks of being so nice to me, Sam, and my dad, even though he doesn't make it easy. He's a grouch, and he doesn't like anything that isn't good news, and forget lying or trying to pull a fast one unless you want your head bitten off, but the cool thing about you is, you'll bite his head off right back. That makes you okay in my books. You're not Mom, but you'll do in a pinch.",
        "Todd: Ha ha! That's pretty good.",
        "Jack: Cheers.",
        "Todd: Okay. Cheers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch it. Don't play with that thing.",
        "Blair: Who's playing?",
        "Ross: Blair, I'm serious. That's a spear gun. It can cause a lot of damage.",
        "Blair: Oh, more than you've already caused already?",
        "Ross: I know that you're angry.",
        "Blair: We had a deal, Ross. You were supposed to help me stop the wedding, and all you've done is help it along.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: Oh, you're sorry.",
        "Ross: Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look. I know you had a lot riding on this, but you gave me no choice. You were getting irrational. Hello.",
        "Blair: I'll give you irrational right where it counts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Wow, word travels fast.",
        "Rex: So, it's true. You and Schuyler are gonna be working together.",
        "Gigi: Looks that way.",
        "Rex: Meaning?",
        "Gigi: Well, the probation period lasts a month, but I would be surprised if Schuyler didn't work out.",
        "Rex: Bartending, huh? That's gonna make old Schuyler a real asset to the rehab center.",
        "Gigi: Balsom, how did you even hear about this?",
        "Rex: I'm wondering why I didn't hear it from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Thought you might be hungry.",
        "Layla: No, thanks. I'm good, really good after that ceremony, which I completely didn't expect. Didn't you think it was romantic?",
        "Cristian: If I didn't know any better, I'd say Todd and T\u00e9a have a long, happy marriage ahead of them.",
        "Layla: But you do know better?",
        "Cristian: Todd is happy with T\u00e9a right now. I mean, you heard him. She's bailed him out of God knows how many raps, and the fact that his kids are even talking to him right now I'm sure has a lot to do with T\u00e9a, which means she's in his good graces, but the second she does something he doesn't like, it'll be over. She'll be the enemy. That's who Todd is. That's how he thinks.",
        "Layla: Mm, I don't know. I think people can change. Maybe I'm naive, but I think if you're really in love, it changes you.",
        "Cristian: Yeah. Well, they do fight too much to make it, anyway.",
        "Layla: Maybe that's exactly why they will make it. They fight, but they don't scare off. They've seen the worst in each other.",
        "Cristian: Are you just gonna contradict everything I say?",
        "Layla: If you're wrong, yeah.",
        "Cristian: All right. Well, why don't you stop talking and start dancing?",
        "Layla: Oh, a man of his word.",
        "Cristian: What did you expect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hey.",
        "Charlie: Mm, thank you.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, I just want to thank you for everything that you have done today.",
        "Charlie: What? What'd I do?",
        "Viki: You came with me to one of Todd's weddings, and they are never easy.",
        "Charlie: Hey, I would follow you to the end of the earth, and you know that.",
        "Viki: You know, I told you in the beginning I come with baggage. Todd is a steamer trunk.",
        "Charlie: And I told you in the beginning that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, and you are still the best thing that ever happened to me, and I'm afraid that now that you married me, you're stuck with me.",
        "Viki: Stuck? No. I'm not stuck. I also want to thank you for advising me to keep my own counsel.",
        "Charlie: T\u00e9a certainly looks like she's in love with Todd.",
        "Viki: Yes. She does, God help her.",
        "Charlie: I just hope that this big secret that she's keeping doesn't turn around to bite her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You, mi'jito, rocked that speech just now.",
        "Jack: Isn't that what a best man is supposed to do? But maybe next time, you could give a kid a little notice, maybe a day or a couple hours maybe.",
        "T\u00e9a: There's not gonna be a next time. That's the last time for your dad and me.",
        "Jack: I hope so.",
        "T\u00e9a: Did your father tell you that a very important responsibility for the best man is dancing with the bride?",
        "Jack: Well, if you want to dance with me, all you have to do is ask. Last one on the dance floor is a rotten egg.",
        "Todd: Hey, easy on the merchandise there, pal.",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Todd: You having a good time?",
        "Starr: Yeah. It's good to see you happy.",
        "Todd: You better get used to it. That's the way I'm gonna roll from now on-- Mr. Happy, happy Manning family. You don't seem very happy.",
        "Starr: I'm just worried about Mom. I told her she really shouldn't be here, and I didn't think she would listen.",
        "Todd: Eh, don't worry about your mom. She's probably off licking her wounds somewhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Are you out of your frickin' mind? It could've killed me.",
        "Blair: Oh, stop your whining. I missed on purpose, all right? You think I want to sit here on this boat and listen to you whine and moan about I turned you into a steer instead of a bull?",
        "Ross: You know, you really have lost it. You know that.",
        "Blair: What I have lost is my patience with people like you messing with me.",
        "Ross: Oh.",
        "Blair: I hope you learned your lesson.",
        "Ross: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, we're good, right? Are you okay?",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah. I'm just fine, just Jim dandy. You know, let Todd and T\u00e9a think that they're married. Go right ahead. Let them think it all they want because when I get back to shore, I'm gonna blow them out of the water, and Todd can add his wedding vows to the list of lies that T\u00e9a has already told him.",
        "Ross: And then what?",
        "Blair: And then Todd tears T\u00e9a in two.",
        "Ross: Oh, and then what?",
        "Blair: God, what are you, a broken record?",
        "Ross: Yeah, and then Todd realizes the error of his ways and comes crawling back to you. Give me a break. I'll tell you something else. If he didn't want you before, he's gonna want you even less when you make him look like a chump.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I was going to tell you tonight, but someone obviously beat me to it. Honey, the whole thing happened within the last hour. Brody quit. The bar needed a replacement. Schuyler was there, and because he's covered for me in the past, my manager offered him the job.",
        "Rex: And he just took it?",
        "Gigi: No. He tried to turn the job down, which doesn't make any sense because he's barely been able to make ends meet since he lost his teaching job and today he found out that he will never be allowed to teach in Llanview again.",
        "Rex: Aww.",
        "Gigi: Shut up. He's thinking about reapplying to med school.",
        "Rex: Med school?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. He's already completed more than two years. Well, that was before he got in trouble with drugs.",
        "Rex: Well, he is special.",
        "Gigi: Rex, he really needs the money, and, yeah, I told him to take the job, but he still wouldn't do it. You want to know why? Because he was worried how you'd react, and I told him that you would be cool with it as long as you heard it from me up front. Maybe I shouldn't have spoken for you. I just thought that since you've tried so hard to make things right with Schuyler, that this would be like cake. Was I wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I'll be right with you.",
        "Kim: No worries. I've got all the time in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Cole: No luck?",
        "Starr: It went straight to voice mail. She must've turned off her cell phone.",
        "Cole: I'm sure you mom will be fine, okay?",
        "Starr: That's what my dad said.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I wanted to thank you for agreeing to be my matron of honor at the last minute.",
        "Viki: Come on. I was honored.",
        "T\u00e9a: And also, thank you for your advice about telling Todd, you know, everything.",
        "Viki: I wanted to help. I hope I did.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you did, a lot. What you said really put things into focus for me.",
        "Viki: And what does that mean?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it means I'm gonna tell him--I'm gonna tell him everything. I just, um--I'm gonna tell him after our wedding night. I just want to have that one night of peace, you know?",
        "Viki: Don't wait too long.",
        "[Glass clinking]",
        "Todd: Attention. Can I have everyone's attention, please? Um, it was all really nice and all that that you came, but party is over. Got to go, all right? I have made an honest woman out of this woman.",

        "Blair: Oh, for the last time, I don't want Todd! I don't care if he marries a tree. Just not gonna allow my kids--",
        "Ross: Oh, the kids, the kids, the k--not again. \"Evil T\u00e9a, seductress, destroyer of worlds.\" Please.",
        "Blair: That woman is not fit to raise a pet rock, much less my children.",
        "Ross: I remember enough about being a kid to know that they don't exactly like being dragged through their parents' crap. It kind of messes with their mind a little bit.",
        "Blair: Are you questioning my ability as a mother?",
        "Ross: Yes.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Ross: Yes, 100%. What kind of mother finds damaging information about her ex's fianc\u00e9e, damaging enough she knows it's gonna hurt them, but she doesn't say anything? What kind of mother bides her time waiting for the most hurtful moment to drop that bomb? What kind of mother does all of this in front of her 3 kids? The kind of mother who's blinded by her feelings for Todd.",
        "Blair: All right! All right! So, I have feelings for Todd.",
        "Ross: Well, news flash--he doesn't have those feelings for you.",

        "Kim: I just came from Ultraviolet. God, what a mob scene.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah? Not a big Lionel Richie fan, huh?",
        "Kim: You kidding me? Hello? No, really. One of my favorite songs is \"Hello.\"",
        "Schuyler: Ha! Ah.",
        "Kim: Lionel is cool, but his kids--",
        "Schuyler: Nicole?",
        "Kim: Yeah. You know her?",
        "Schuyler: Do you?",
        "Kim: She's had beef with me ever since this-- well, back in my Vegas days, there was this incident. Anyways, I haven't been safe at a Lionel Richie concert in years.",
        "Schuyler: Ha!",
        "Kim: So, how you liking this new gig? It's all the talk at U.V., you know.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, yeah? How so?",
        "Kim: I was at the bar when Gigi came in and told Rex.",
        "Schuyler: Oh. They didn't get into it, did they?",
        "Kim: Those two? No way. They're like this. Rex thought it was a great idea. By the time I left, they were all over each other. God, it's so awesome to see two people so madly in love like that. Makes me want to kill them. Kidding, sort of. Have you ever been in love like that?",
        "Schuyler: Not really. No.",
        "Kim: One day, though, huh? You and me both.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Kim: Come on. Where's the positive attitude?",
        "Schuyler: My job, my career, getting my life back on track--those are the kind of things that I'm focusing on right now. I don't really have time for--",
        "Kim: Fun? Well, you know what they say. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Do you really want people to think you're a dull boy?",
        "Schuyler: No, but--",
        "Kim: How about you go out with me instead?",
        "Schuyler: What?",
        "Kim: Go out with me. Look. I don't know where to go out and meet people in this town, and you're going stir-crazy in that fleabag you're staying at, so why not hang out, have some laughs, meet some people together?",
        "Schuyler: You want to go out, you and me, trolling for--",
        "Kim: Someone real, someone cool, someone who'll knock you socks off.",

        "Gigi: I'm not asking you to. I just want to know--",
        "Rex: If I had known he was looking for a job tending bar, I would've offered him a position here.",
        "Gigi: Really?",
        "Rex: I'm trying to make an effort here.",
        "Gigi: I know. I can see that, and I really appreciate it, but you're still not answering my question.",
        "Rex: What do you want me to say? Do you want my blessing that you and Schuyler are gonna be working together, spend late nights together?",
        "Gigi: Honey, I honestly want to know if it's gonna bother you if he takes the job because Schuyler said he wouldn't take the job if it was gonna be an issue with us.",
        "Rex: But it would be an issue for us if Schuyler passed on the job because of me, wouldn't it? So I'm either damned if I do or damned if I don't.",
        "Langston: I'm the 100th caller. Langston Wilde. \"Three Times a Lady.\" Oh, my God, I won. I won. We did it, Markko. We did it. Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.",

        "Starr: So then--",
        "Cole: Maybe now is a good time to go over house rules.",
        "Cole: And next time something like this happens, maybe you should try using this revolutionary thing called your bedroom which divides the common area by what they call a door.",
        "Markko: You weren't supposed to be back so early.",
        "Cole: Well, we are. Nice underwear, by the way.",
        "Markko: Hey, watch it.",
        "Starr: Cole, Langston and Markko have extra tickets to the concert. I mean, we'd have to change, but do you want to go?",

        "Layla: I had a good time, too. I'm glad we're on the same page.",
        "Cristian: Thanks for coming. You made it bearable, fun even. So, guess I better take you home before you turn into a pumpkin, huh?",
        "Layla: Hey, what's the hurry, Vega? It's early still. We're dressed up, and going home now would seem like a waste.",

        "Gigi: I am sorry, Rex.",
        "Rex: You are?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I didn't know by me asking you, I would be putting you in a bad position.",
        "Rex: Why am I making a federal case out of this?",
        "Gigi: You're not. I mean--",
        "Rex: You are putting up with your sister possibly carrying my baby. You are asking me to accept a friend that you have that I don't particularly like. It's called life. This two-year-old that body-snatched me, just forget him.",
        "Gigi: You're not acting like a child.",
        "Rex: Well, kind of. It's called work, Gigi. Either I trust you or I don't, and I do trust you, and I love you so much.",
        "Gigi: I love you, too.",
        "Rex: I just want to be the guy that gives you everything you need, and it hurts that you can't always lean on me, and I would be a world-class loser if I guilted you into turning your back on a friend because I couldn't hack it, so tell Schuyler that it's all good with me.",
        "Gigi: You are my world, Balsom.",
        "Rex: And you're mine... and I would be completely okay with you and Schuyler working opposite shifts. Ha ha ha!",

        "Kim: I mean, we used to have a pretty good time back in Vegas, didn't we?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Well, I was messed up 3/4 of the time. I mean, come on.",
        "Kim: Bet you're even more fun when you're screwed on straight.",
        "Schuyler: Kim, you're a really good-looking girl, okay? I'm sure you could find someone if that's what you're looking for.",
        "Kim: What are you so afraid of? It's not like we'd be going out on a date or anything, not that I'd kick you out of bed for eating crackers.",
        "Schuyler: Wait. What?",
        "Kim: Nothing. Forget I said that. Come on. Don't tell me you never caught on to how bad I crushed on you back in the day.",
        "Schuyler: You never said anything.",
        "Kim: Because you were with my best friend.",
        "Schuyler: Which is exactly why we shouldn't be doing this right now.",
        "Kim: Why not, because of Stacy? No. Trust me. Stacy would not have a problem with us hanging out. She just wants you to be happy.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, after I completely ruined her chances with Rex. I doubt that.",
        "Kim: Look. Stacy has made some mistakes. Big whoop. Everybody does. Point is, she truly cares about you, and she's just worried you're gonna spend the rest of your life pining for Gigi.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi and I are just friends.",
        "Kim: Good. Glad to hear it because now there's no excuse. Now you have to go out with me. You've got my number. Use it.",

        "Todd: It's more like love cabana number two. This is what we should've got the first go-round. You likee?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, no. I don't likee. I love. I love it, Todd. It's beautiful.",
        "Todd: Well, it should be. This is our second chance, and I, for one, do not plan on wasting one moment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, that is such bull. If you knew that there was even half a chance that T\u00e9a could be free and clear, you'd make a play on her so fast her head would spin.",
        "Ross: Free and clear? Right, right, right. Todd could be 6 feet under. T\u00e9a would never be free for him. She's loved him and only him. She was in love with him in her head the whole time she was with me.",
        "Blair: You know, Ross, when I found you on that island, you kind of liked my plan, so what's changed? I mean, you were ready to abandon your life in paradise just to have one more look at your precious T\u00e9a. What changed? And don't tell me it was me, okay? You're hiding something, Ross Rayburn--I know it--just like T\u00e9a is.",

        "Todd: Yes, sir. It's gonna be different this time.",

        "Ross: What can I say? When I got to Llanview, I saw the truth. T\u00e9a and Todd were gonna get married. That was just a fact, something she's always wanted, so I figured maybe if I could let her go, move on, maybe I could move on, too.",
        "Blair: My, my, aren't you evolved.",
        "Ross: You should try it, evolving. You might like it. Let it go. Let Todd go.",
