        "Gregory Evans testifies at Dani's custody hearing that Tea said she wanted Ross to raise Dani. Dani tells Destiny that she wants to stay with Todd. Blair tells Dani and Des that Greg said Dani should go with Todd. Todd and Blair wonder how Ross got Greg to lie for him. Destiny demands to know if Greg was telling the truth. John meets Natalie at Rodi's and tells her about Greg's unusual testimony.",
        "Clint tells Natalie that John should propose to her. Rex tells Natalie that Clint is an ass that needs to mind his own business. Rex hesitates to tell Bo what is bothering him because Clint threatened to send him to a Moroccan prison with David. He lies to Bo that David is partying in Ibiza and is in no hurry to return to Llanview. Nora goes to Bo's office, talks up Clint to Inez, and then tells Bo that they should have a dinner party for Clint and Inez. Bo doubts that Clint is serious about Inez. Bo tells Nora about Rex's suspicious behavior. Cristian calls Gigi to the Studio to wait for a model. Gigi is surprised when the male model arrives and undresses. When Cristian notices that she didn't draw the model's genital area, he tells her that she should find inspiration in the human body instead of being afraid of it. Rex is shocked to see the naked man when he walks into the studio."

        "Destiny: What are you doing out here?",
        "Dani: Hey. The judge asked me to wait outside.",
        "Destiny: Why?",
        "Dani: I don't know. It was getting kind of crazy in there. My dad was just about to make a statement.",
        "Destiny: By \"dad,\" you mean--",
        "Dani: Ross. And then Todd came running in with your brother Greg.",
        "Destiny: Greg is here?",
        "Dani: Yeah, and that's when the judge asked me to leave, but, hey, why should I stay? It's only my life they're deciding. Oh, gosh, I wish I knew what was going on.",
        "Destiny: Look. The way I see it, you have nothing to worry about. My brother is in there straightening everything out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Burdett: Dr. Evans, do you know Mrs. Manning's last wishes?",
        "Greg: Yes, Your Honor. T\u00e9a made it perfectly clear to me that she wanted Ross Rayburn to raise Dani.",
        "Todd: No. Wait a minute. That's a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, Inez, I'm heading for Rodi's. Do you want any--wow. Going somewhere special tonight?",
        "Inez: Actually, I have dinner plans.",
        "Bo: Well, then what are you still doing here? Take off.",
        "Inez: Are you sure?",
        "Bo: Absolutely, and whoever you're going out with tonight, that's one lucky guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: That was always my favorite tie, too.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Natalie: As I recall, you only pull it out for special occasions, though.",
        "Clint: Well, I have a dinner date.",
        "Natalie: Yeah?",
        "Clint: Yeah. So I'll get right to the point. Why have you been avoiding your old man?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Earth to Rex. You okay?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Gigi: You sure? Because you were, like, a million miles--",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Gigi: Hold that thought. Hey, Cris, what's up?",
        "Cristian: Hey, Gigi, I need your help. Do you mind coming to class a little early today?",
        "Gigi: I'm on my way. Oop. I have to go. I'm afraid my new boss needs me.",
        "Rex: Well, don't let him work you too hard.",
        "Gigi: This is so amazing, Rex. I feel like, for the first time in my life, I am on a winning streak. First, I get into college, and then I get the grant. Of course, yes, I lost the grant, but then the money for Cristian to hire me as assistant just drops out of the sky. How lucky is that?",
        "Rex: I wouldn't exactly call it luck.",
        "Gigi: What does that mean?",
        "Rex: It means that luck had nothing to do with it. You earned it.",
        "Gigi: Thank you. I'll see you soon.",
        "Bo: Hey, Gigi.",
        "Gigi: Oh, Bo. Good. You can keep Rex company.",
        "Bo: Oh, Gigi is in a better mood today.",
        "Rex: Hey, Bo, what's up?",
        "Bo: Well, I was about to ask you the same thing. Last night, you wanted to tell me something. What is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Wow. You look fabulous. Let me guess--a date?",
        "Inez: Um, well, dinner, just dinner.",
        "Nora: With Clint?",
        "Inez: Yes, with Clint. He did something really nice for me, so having dinner with him was the least I could do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I've been busy, Dad.",
        "Clint: Busy?",
        "Natalie: Yes, with work and all the questions about Eli Clarke. Anyway, what did you want to see me about?",
        "Clint: You know damn well why I want to see you-- your baby's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Your Honor, he's lying. What are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Morgan: Todd--",
        "Todd: No, no, no. Wait a minute. That son of a bitch knows that T\u00e9a wanted Dani to be with me. Everyone knows that.",
        "Judge Burdett: Mr. Manning, sit down and be quiet, or I'll remove you from this courtroom.",
        "Todd: Okay. Would you ask him why he's changed his story?",
        "Judge Burdett: Mr. Manning, Dr. Evans is your witness, correct?",
        "Todd: Well, yes. That's correct, but he was--",
        "Judge Burdett: Then let's hear what he has to say. Dr. Evans, can you recount for us exactly what the late Mrs. Manning's wishes were regarding her daughter?",
        "Greg: I believe I already have, Your Honor.",
        "Judge Burdett: Is there any possibility that you were mistaken about her intentions?",
        "Greg: No. No. There's no mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Your mom told Greg she wanted to see you and Todd before she died, right? Once Greg says that to the judge, case closed.",
        "Dani: You think that'll be enough?",
        "Destiny: Yeah. If she was gonna give you to Ross, wouldn't she have wanted you with him? It doesn't make sense.",
        "Dani: I know. I just want this to be over. I'm so sick of everyone fighting and wondering where I'm gonna be. I want to know what's gonna happen to me.",
        "Destiny: What do you want to happen to you? Dani, you've been dodging this question from the get-go. Forget the judge. Forget everyone else and just be real for a second. Which father do you want to live with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: The night she died, T\u00e9a told me in no uncertain terms that she wanted Ross Rayburn to raise Danielle. She said she even put it into her will.",
        "Judge Burdett: If this is true, why didn't you tell Mr. Manning or anyone else before now?",
        "Greg: Well, I tried. I even went to Mr. Manning to break the news to him.",
        "Todd: What? No. You told me that T\u00e9a wanted to see me before she died. You even tried to tell me that you felt guilty about having not told us when we were there.",
        "Greg: That was a lie. After seeing how much Todd loved his daughter and the pain that he was going through because of the loss of his wife, I couldn't tell him the truth. So instead, I told him what I felt he needed to hear.",
        "Morgan: Your Honor, if I may... Dr. Evans, if you knew Mrs. Manning stipulated this in her will, why lie about it? You must have known that once the will was in probate, Mr. Rayburn would come for his daughter.",
        "Greg: Well, to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Rayburn was still a wanted man. I had no idea he was actually gonna show up with the will in his hand, but now that he has, I have no choice but to tell the truth.",
        "Todd: Your Honor, he's just admitted to lying before. How do we know he's telling the truth now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What are you talking about?",
        "Clint: John McBain. Who else?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Actually, I figured you were gonna want to talk to me about him.",
        "Clint: Oh, did you?",
        "Natalie: Yes, because Jess keeps reminding me how you told Brody to make an honest woman out of her, so I'm surprised you haven't gone after John with a shotgun.",
        "Clint: Well, that's exactly what I'm gonna do if McBain ever hurts you.",
        "Natalie: Dad, don't worry. McBain will never hurt me.",
        "Clint: Certainly wouldn't be the first time. Tell me something, Natalie. How many times has that man broken your heart, and what makes you think this time is any different?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: So tell me. What was the really nice something that Clint did for you?",
        "Inez: Well, it was actually for my son James. He couldn't afford his tuition, and he almost had to drop out of L.U., but Clint got him a grant so that he could stay in school.",
        "Nora: Wow. That is nice.",
        "Inez: Yes, especially since my son James and I have been estranged, you know, so it means a lot to me to be able to help him in any way, even if it was Clint that made it happen. Because he made it happen, I have another chance with my son.",
        "Nora: Oh, that's nice. I'm just glad that you and Clint are dating. Doesn't matter how you got together.",
        "Inez: Well, we're not really dating, just, you know, dinner.",
        "Nora: Yeah. Well, you know, I know Clint, and I can tell that he likes you...a lot.",
        "Inez: I don't know about that.",
        "Nora: Well, I do, and listen. The fact that Clint helped get your son a grant for his education, I'm impressed, but I'm not surprised.",
        "Inez: Does he usually make a habit of funding college educations?",
        "Nora: Well, no, not that, in particular, but I need to clear the air with you about something. I know that Bo was telling you about all of Clint's previous exploits.",
        "Inez: You mean, with the shotgun?",
        "Nora: Yeah. Well, when you use that word, it really does kind of sound bad, but listen. I think Bo accidentally made Clint out like a cross of grizzly Adams and Attila the Hun, and the truth is, Clint really is a stand-up guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Well, now all I have to do is stand here and wait for my cheeseburgers. So you can quit stalling. What is it you wanted to tell me last night?",
        "Rex: You know, I told you. It was nothing. It's not even a problem anymore.",
        "Bo: Are you sure? Because when Nora and I left here, both you and Gigi were pretty upset.",
        "Clint's voice: Statesville may have better accommodations than our good friend David is enjoying at the moment, but still, it's not a picnic, not when you're doing a 10-year sentence, and that's pretty much the standard for trying to steal corporate secrets. I would hate to see Shane without his daddy for all that time. Then there's poor Gigi alone again.",
        "Rex's voice: You've made your point.",
        "Clint's voice: Of course, if you don't care about your future or Gigi's--",
        "Bo: Come on. Balsom, you know you can talk to me. Is it Gigi?",
        "Rex: Actually, Gigi has never been better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Okay, boss. I'm here.",
        "Cristian: Great. Look. I got to talk to the dean about approving a last-minute transfer, but the life studies model hasn't gotten here yet. So can you do me a favor? When he gets here, can you get him started?",
        "Gigi: Sure.",
        "Cristian: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Gigi: What do I have to do?",
        "Cristian: Don't worry. You'll figure it out.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Man: Hi. Is this Professor Vega's class?",
        "Gigi: Yes. It is. Can I help you?",
        "Man: Yeah. I'm Joel, the life studies model.",
        "Gigi: Oh, hi. I'm Gigi. Nice to meet you. I'm Professor Vega's assistant. I'm supposed to help you get started.",
        "Joel: Great. So how do you want me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Everything is okay with Gigi.",
        "Bo: Good, and what about you? You in any trouble?",
        "Rex: Never stop looking out for me, do you?",
        "Bo: Well, somebody has got to do that.",
        "Rex: I was such a sleaze when I first came here. I got to tell you, Bo, everything you have done for me to help keep me on the straight and narrow, you make me want to be a better person.",
        "Bo: Wish I could do the same for David. Have you had any luck tracking him down?",
        "Rex: As a matter of fact, yes.",
        "Bo: Well, what'd you find out? Do you know where David is?",
        "Waiter: Here you go, Commissioner.",
        "Bo: Oh, thanks a lot, Bev. Here you go, and keep the change, okay? Listen. I got to get back to the station. You want to walk with me? Then you can bring me up to speed on David. Where is he?",
        "Rex: Well, I found David-- no, thank you--at a foam party in Ibiza.",
        "Bo: A foam party?",
        "Rex: Yeah. Trust me. You really don't want to know. Bottom line is, David is having way too much fun to come back to Llanview.",
        "Bo: Well, I figured. Sorry that you had to disappoint Kelly, you know, and Dorian.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Too bad.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, look. I got to get to the station before these fries get cold. Balsom, look. If you ever need me, you know.",
        "Rex: I know.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joel: So what do you think? Shall I go on the platform?",
        "Gigi: Yes. Great idea.",
        "Joel: What kind of pose do you want?",
        "Gigi: Pose?",
        "Joel: Or unless you'd rather wait until Cris gets here.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no. That's okay. Um, how about like the statue of--",
        "Joel: Liberty?",
        "Gigi: Heh. NO. Not that statue, another famous statue with a man-- uh, of a man--",
        "Joel: You mean \"David\"?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. That's the one. Okay. Maybe not a famous pose. Let's try maybe to relax your arms a little, yeah, but not too-- okay. Maybe one hand on your hip. Okay. Not that. Heh heh. How about turning? Okay.",
        "Joel: I'm not sure I'm giving you quite what you want. Why don't you pose me?",
        "Gigi: Pose you?",
        "Joel: Go ahead. I'll be putty in your hands.",
        "Gigi: Huh. Okay.",
        "Gigi: That should do it.",
        "Joel: Cool. So do you want me to do anything with the balls?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: First of all, John didn't break my heart, okay? Our breakup was mutual.",
        "Clint: Oh, sweetheart, I know you're trying to protect him.",
        "Natalie: You know what, Dad? That was a long time ago. Both John and I have changed so much since then, and we have a baby.",
        "Clint: Exactly. A Buchanan baby.",
        "Natalie: Okay. I don't think we need to be worrying about how to redivide the family fortune.",
        "Clint: Oh, come on, Natalie. This is serious, all right? At least Brody had the decency to propose to Jess.",
        "Natalie: You know, Brody isn't that perfect.",
        "Clint: What's that supposed to mean? I thought you and Brody were pretty good friends.",
        "Natalie: We are, you know? It's just that Jess and Brody, they're in a different place than me and John.",
        "Clint: Well, you can't blame me for being worried. I mean, look at McBain's history with women.",
        "Natalie: Really? And how about your history with women? Nora hurt you. Kim left you. I think you're more worried about you than me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: No woman has ever encouraged me to date her ex-husband before.",
        "Nora: Well, I just want Clint to be happy because he deserves it. You know what? Why don't you go and primp a little bit more for your date--go ahead-- and I'll cover your desk while you're gone. Go on.",
        "Inez: You don't mind?",
        "Nora: I insist. Go, go, go, go, go.",
        "Inez: Thank you.",
        "Nora: You're welcome.",
        "[Nora clears throat]",
        "Nora: Ah...",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Nora: Ah. Commissioner Buchanan's office.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Dad, believe it or not, I am really sorry that Kim left you, and what happened with Uncle Bo and Nora really sucks, but that's not gonna happen with John and me.",
        "Clint: You know, what happened with Bo and Nora--ancient history. Would I have hired Matthew if it wasn't? Oh, Natalie, I have moved on, and tonight I'm having dinner with a very attractive lady.",
        "Natalie: Oh, good. Do we need to card her?",
        "Clint: That's enough of that. Actually, she's Bo's secretary...",
        "Natalie: Oh, well, that's--",
        "Clint: And don't give me that too-close-for-comfort stuff. I've heard it, and I think it's a load of horse pucky.",
        "Natalie: I was gonna say nice. That's all.",
        "Clint: Oh. Well, that's better.",
        "Natalie: Dad, I'm really happy for you. I just want you to be happy for me, too.",
        "Clint: That's all I want, honey, but you know something? You just can't blame me for worrying.",
        "Natalie: Well, don't. John and me and this baby are gonna be just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Your Honor, Dr. Evans is my late ex-wife's physician. He has nothing to gain by lying here.",
        "Todd: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "Judge Burdett: Mr. Manning--",
        "Ross: The will has been authenticated. Everything he's testifying to only backs up what's in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I didn't answer the question because it's not that simple. Destiny, I grew up on the ocean with my dad. We'd swim and surf every day. He taught me how to dive off a cliff so that when I cut the water, I'd barely make a splash, and when we'd fall asleep on the hammock, he'd carry me to bed. That little girl, that's who I am.",
        "Destiny: That's who you used to be, but maybe that's not who you are now. Look. I don't want to push you either way, but who you are now, that's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge Burdett: I'm inclined to agree with Mr. Rayburn about Dr. Evans' objectivity. He appears to have no motive to lie about Ms. Manning's expressed wish...",
        "Todd: I don't care. There's no way T\u00e9a would've said that. If she did, she was out of her mind. Your Honor, she knew better than anyone Dani belongs with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: You're right. Everything has changed. It's like I said in the court. I care about them both, and I don't want to hurt Ross.",
        "Destiny: You keep humming that same tune over and over again. \"I care about both of them, but I don't want to hurt Ross.\" What do you really want?",
        "Dani: Deep, deep inside, I believe that my mom wanted me with Todd... so deep, deep inside, I want to stay with Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Um, uh... what do I want you to do with the--",
        "Joel: Balls?",
        "Gigi: Oh, those balls. Okay.",
        "Joel: Yeah. I wondered if Mr. Vega wanted me to do something active, like juggle.",
        "Gigi: Sure, sure, whatever.",
        "Joel: Great. If you don't mind, I'm just gonna do a little stretching. Ohh...",
        "Cristian: Gigi?",
        "Gigi: You-- you did not tell me the dude was gonna be naked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Whew, you look like you're in just as good of a mood as I'm in. Give me that.",
        "Rex: You can't drink that.",
        "Natalie: Who said anything about drinking? Thank you.",
        "Rex: Anytime.",
        "Natalie: Nope. Something to drink. Go get a soda. Excuse me. Caffeine-free soda?",
        "Rex: So, what happened to you?",
        "Natalie: Nothing. Just got a lecture from my dad to warn me about John.",
        "Rex: Clint is an ass. He needs to mind his own damn business.",
        "Natalie: Whoa! That's my dad you're talking about. I'm allowed to trash-talk him, not you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: The day we got married, there was a moment when T\u00e9a couldn't recognize me because she was delirious.",
        "Judge Burdett: Mr. Manning, I have been easy on you up till now, but I will not tolerate any more of these interruptions.",
        "Morgan: Your Honor, my client has a valid point. Was Mrs. Manning even in her right mind when she said that her daughter Danielle belonged with Mr. Rayburn?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I know my mom waited a long time to tell me about Todd, but once she did, all she wanted was for me to accept him as my father, and I want to respect her wishes.",
        "Destiny: Then what's the deal with that will?",
        "Dani: I don't know, but I don't trust it. I think Eli might have done something to it. I just don't know what exactly.",
        "Destiny: Do you think Ross is in on it?",
        "Dani: I don't know, but even if he isn't, I want to stay with Todd.",
        "Destiny: Really? Because for a long time, all you talked about was how much you missed Ross.",
        "Dani: Yeah. I know, but my whole family is here. If I did go back to Tahiti, I would really miss Blair and Starr and Sam.",
        "Destiny: Jack?",
        "Dani: Even Jack, but not as much as I'd miss you...",
        "Destiny: Duh.",
        "Dani: Or Nate. You know, Llanview really feels like my home now.",
        "Destiny: Good, because I want you to stay, and I know I gave your dad a hard time, but it's because in the middle of all that craziness, I know there's a human being in there somewhere. I'm really glad you'll be staying with Todd.",
        "Dani: Des, we don't know that yet.",
        "Destiny: Of course we do. Greg is in there right now making it happen.",
        "Greg: In my professional medical opinion, I believe T\u00e9a was lucid when she expressed her wishes.",
        "Judge Burdett: Thank you, Dr. Evans. I'm calling a 30-minute recess, during which time I will review this case in light of the new testimony.",
        "[Gavel bangs]",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Ross: Hey, thank you for telling the truth.",
        "Blair: Hey, hey, do not make this worse, Todd, please.",
        "Destiny: How'd it go in there?",
        "Todd: Bastard. Tell the truth or I'll choke it out of you!",
        "Destiny: Leave my brother alone!",
        "John: What are you doing?",
        "Blair: Come on. You're just gonna make things worse. Stop.",
        "Todd: He got to you, didn't he, huh? What's Rayburn giving you? What's he giving you to help take my kid away from me? I'm fine.",

        "Rex: Hey, nobody messes with my sister, not even your dad.",
        "Natalie: I can handle it.",
        "Rex: Yeah, right.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Whoa. What's going on with you? Why all of a sudden you have issues with my dad?",
        "Rex: I'm sorry. I'm just mad at myself.",
        "Natalie: Okay. So don't take it out on me.",
        "Rex: What about you? You've been all over me since you got here.",
        "Natalie: All right. I'm sorry. Guess I'm a little mad at myself, too, for obvious reasons.",
        "Rex: What do you mean?",
        "Natalie: You know. Gigi really didn't tell you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I told you it was a life drawing class. What did you think that was?",
        "Gigi: Not this. How was I supposed to know it involved a naked guy, a really hot naked guy? I didn't know where to look. This is not funny.",
        "Cristian: You're right. You're right. This is very serious.",
        "Gigi: Look. If you think that I am too inexperienced for this job and you want to give it to someone else, well, I hope you don't.",
        "Cristian: Will you stop worrying? You're doing fine. Come on. Let's go inside. Class is getting ready to start.",
        "Gigi: I don't think I can go back in there.",
        "Cristian: It's okay. I'll protect you from the naked guy.",

        "Bo: Please, why don't you step right into my office here?",
        "Nora: Yes, sir, if I must.",
        "Bo: Because I just happen to have a couple of Rodi's burgers here. One of them has got your name written all over it.",
        "Nora: How did you know I was gonna be here?",
        "Bo: Just had a feeling that you might show up, and I'm so glad that you did.",
        "Nora: Mm! Me, too.",
        "Bo: Inez already take off?",
        "Nora: No. I just sent her off to go primp for her date...",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Nora: With Clint. What's wrong?",
        "Bo: Nothing. Nothing. You know, Inez, she never mentioned to me that she was going out with Clint.",
        "Nora: Well, maybe it's none of your business.",
        "Bo: But it's yours?",
        "Nora: Girl talk.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "Nora: Why does this bother you so much?",
        "Bo: It doesn't bother me. I don't want anything to come between you and me and our Rodi's burgers.",
        "Nora: Ah...mm.",
        "Bo: Mm.",
        "Nora: Mm mm mm.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Ho ho ho! I don't think there's a sight that I like more in this world than to see my beautiful wife with just a little bit of Rodi's secret sauce right there on her chin.",
        "Nora: Hmm. You're after my burger, aren't you?",
        "Bo: Let's eat.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: This thing that you're mad at yourself about, does it have something to do with why Clint is upset with John?",
        "Natalie: No. No, not really. Really, Gigi didn't tell you?",
        "Rex: Apparently not.",
        "Natalie: So you guys actually keep secrets from each other?",
        "Rex: What, you and John don't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on. What's going on?",
        "Destiny: Stay away from my brother, freak show. What the hell? Why didn't you just kick Todd's butt just now? Look, Dani. I'm sorry, but forget what I said about there being a human being inside all that craziness. What the hell was his problem? He can't just go beating on my brother like that and get away with it.",
        "Greg: Stay out of this, Des.",
        "Ross: Are you all right?",
        "Greg: Yes. I'm fine.",
        "Dani: Wait a second. What just happened in there? Okay. I thought Todd brought you here to testify for him. Why was he whaling on you?",
        "Blair: He did testify. He told the judge that T\u00e9a wanted you to go with Ross.",
        "Destiny: No way.",
        "Destiny: You testified that T\u00e9a wanted Dani with Ross? But that's not true.",
        "Dani: What's going on?",
        "Ross: Honey, all I know is, if the judge needed a reason to see why T\u00e9a wanted you with me instead of Todd, she just got it.",
        "Destiny: Says the man who held me at gunpoint.",
        "Ross: Come on, honey. Let's sit down.",
        "Dani: No. None of this makes any sense.",
        "Ross: I know. It'll be over soon, though, okay?",
        "Blair: You know what? Why don't I take her in?",
        "Ross: No. We're fine. Thank you. Come on.",
        "John: You want to come on down to the station? You can file a report against Manning.",

        "Destiny: Greg, wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Of course John and I keep some things from each other. It's just that you and Gigi are so close and for so long, I--",
        "Rex: No. There's still one or two things that I haven't told her or anyone.",
        "Natalie: What is it that you're so mad at yourself about?",
        "Rex: You know what? It doesn't matter. Gigi is happy. She's working. She's going to school. She's starting a whole new part of her life just like you. Look at you! You're having a baby! How amazing is that, huh?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Listen. If you ever need to unload, I'm here.",
        "Rex: Same goes for you, okay? You know that, right?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I know.",
        "Rex: I better--",
        "Natalie: Uh, yeah.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: No, no. I got it. I got it.",

        "Nora: They look good together, don't they? I mean, really, don't they? Oh, God, I hope this works out for Clint so nice.",
        "Bo: I think you're putting the cart before the horse.",
        "Nora: Oh, I know. I know, but wouldn't it be great if they fell in love? Really, I mean, it would be such a relief not to have to worry about Clint anymore.",
        "Bo: You know what? You can just stop doing that anyway.",
        "Nora: Bo, come on now. He's been trying, and you have to admit, he's been extending an olive branch, right? He's acting almost normal around us. It's almost like things are back to normal with us.",
        "Bo: Yep, almost.",
        "Nora: Yeah, and, you know, maybe we should do something to reciprocate to show him that we're trying, too. I know. We could throw a dinner party and invite Clint and Inez to come. What do you think?",
        "Bo: I think you are out of your cotton-picking mind.",

        "John: How you feeling?",
        "Natalie: Feeling good.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. So how did it go when you cornered Rayburn? Did you get anything out of him?",
        "John: I was making some progress, and then he got summoned to Danielle's custody hearing.",
        "Natalie: So I guess he didn't tell you if Eli Clarke is alive.",
        "John: He was gonna tell the whole courtroom, but then he got interrupted.",
        "Natalie: By Todd?",
        "John: Manning gave him the best present he could ask for-- Dr. Greg Evans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Look, Des. I really need to go, okay? Todd took me away from a very important patient, and I need to go back and check on them.",
        "Destiny: Not until we have a little talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Honey, I don't blame Todd. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't believe me, either, but fortunately, Dr. Evans was able to clear everything up. I mean, if anyone knew what your mother wanted before she passed on, it's him.",
        "Danielle: I guess.",
        "Ross: How about the way he went off on Dr. Evans? It had to scare you. It did me. The thought of you living with a guy like that-- I mean, he's out of control, honey. He doesn't deserve you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You got to stop acting like a wild man. You're playing right into Ross' hands.",
        "Todd: I just don't understand how Ross got Evans to lie. And you know he's lying, right? I mean, this is not what T\u00e9a wanted. You know that.",
        "Blair: Yeah. I know what T\u00e9a wanted. She told me.",
        "Todd: Okay. So you're with me on this one.",
        "Blair: I am with you, all right?",

        "Cristian: Thanks, Joel. You can step down.",
        "Joel: Should I get dressed?",
        "Gigi: Yes. I know it's terrible.",
        "Cristian: Actually, it's pretty good, but I have to ask. Why didn't you draw his--",
        "Gigi: Yeah. I must've run out of time.",
        "Cristian: You know, Gigi, the human body is the most natural thing in the world.",
        "Gigi: Standing naked in the middle of the classroom.",
        "Cristian: Right. You know, I think after a while, you'll get used to looking at a nude model as a form of inspiration and an object for study.",
        "Gigi: Whatever you say, boss.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I took the liberty of ordering a special dinner for us at the country club because I thought you might enjoy trying some rare wines. How does that sound?",

        "Bo: A dinner party at our place with Clint and Inez.",
        "Nora: What's wrong with that?",
        "Bo: Doesn't that sound just a little bit uncomfortable to you?",
        "Nora: No. It sounds like Clint and Inez is getting a little serious, and we should support them.",
        "Bo: They've barely even been out on a date.",
        "Nora: I know, but Inez told me that Clint helped get her son a grant for his education, so obviously, he cares.",
        "Bo: No. No. Obviously, he's pushing just a little too hard to date her, which means that he's doing all of that because he has ulterior motives.",
        "Nora: Oh, Bo, he's your brother. How can you be so suspicious?",
        "Bo: It just comes with the job. That's all. Hey, you know what, hon? Speaking of suspicious, I ran into Balsom when I was at Rodi's.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm?",
        "Bo: Something is going on with him.",
        "Nora: Hmm? Like what?",
        "Bo: I don't know. It-- here's the strange thing. It seemed like he wanted to tell me about something, but every time he got to the point where he was ready to tell me, then all of a sudden, he would just back off.",
        "Nora: That doesn't sound like Rex at all, but--I don't know-- I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.",
        "Bo: What, are you kidding me? This is Balsom we're talking about.",
        "Nora: I know, sweetie, and you've just been a great father figure to him, but when he's ready to tell you, I bet he'll tell you.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",

        "Joel: Yeah. Hey, man.",
        "Rex: Hey. Okay. Who the hell was that?",
        "Cristian: That was the life studies model.",
        "Rex: Oh. Really? You never mentioned you'd be hanging out with a naked guy.",
        "Gigi: Jeez, Balsom, what's gotten into you?",
        "Rex: I'm sorry. It's just, it's kind of been a bad day.",
        "Gigi: I see. So it's okay for you and Kelly to--",
        "Cristian: To what?",
        "Rex: Nothing. That was accidental and fast.",
        "Gigi: Okay. Try not to look at him as a naked guy.",
        "Rex: What should I look at him as?",
        "Gigi: A form of inspiration and an object for study.",

        "Dani: Look. I know Todd lost it, but he's just scared of losing me, just like you were in Seattle.",
        "Ross: Yeah, but the difference is, I've learned my lesson. I've changed. He never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Either T\u00e9a didn't know what she was saying or Greg was lying, and we both know what she wanted.",

        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Judge Burdett: Be seated. Let me begin by saying that I've been informed about the violent outburst that happened outside my courtroom just now. You have run out of warnings. Now to the matter at hand. I've reviewed the new testimony, and I've made my decision."
