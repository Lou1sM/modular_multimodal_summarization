    "Recap": [
        "Cole goes to inform Langston, Marco and Starr of the conversation he overheard between Ray Montez and Clint Buchanan. Clint revealed to him that he has a \"war\" with Dorian Lord since she took his company from him. And he bets that that is why Ray showed up out of nowhere and the judge awarded him custody of Langston so that Dorian will never see her again. And they are all determined to get to the bottom of it. Rex is in critical condition. Gigi and Bo are worried about him and notice that Shane has wondered off. Shane goes to find Brody who's been taken to jail. Brody is traumatized remembering the young boy whom he shot. Gigi finally reveals to Shane that Brody is not his real father. Rex is. Meanwhile, Tess \"works\" on Jared to make him believe that Natalie has bailed on her family and dumped him. And he deserves better. Yet he still does not believe that Natalie would do that to him. And when they all hear that Rex is in critical condition, Tess uses that against Natalie. She realizes that when people find out that Natalie has done nothing and not even shown up to be there for her brother who could be dying, they'll all see what a worthless, selfish person Natalie is. Natalie is distraught and horrified that she cannot see Rex and is locked in the room where Tess has kept her."

        "Langston: Clint Buchanan?",
        "Cole: He brought Ray Montez here to take you away from Dorian.",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me?",
        "Markko: How do you know this?",
        "Cole: I saw the two of them talking at Nora's house, shaking hands. He was thanking Ray for \"a job well done.\" And then Ray says he's glad it's finally over. And then Clint says, \"It's not over yet.\"",
        "Starr: Well, then what?",
        "Cole: Then Clint sees me.",
        "Langston: Well, what did he say to you?",
        "Cole: Well, first he tries to lay this crap line on me. He introduces me to Ray as his \"business associate.\"",
        "Markko: Yeah, right.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Then I tell him that I know that he's your Uncle. So he gets rid of Ray pretty quick.",
        "Starr: I'll bet he did.",
        "Cole: Then he tells me he wants to talk to me. You know, man to man. Tells me that your Aunt Dorian stole away his legacy away from his father. Pretty much tells me that he's trying to get back at her.",
        "Langston: Oh, my God.",
        "Cole: And then he tries to scare me into not saying anything.",
        "Starr: How?",
        "Cole: \"You like living here, don't you, son?\"",
        "Starr: No, he's threatening to kick you out?",
        "Cole: I don't care. I don't care what he does to me. I just care about what he's doing to Langston.",
        "Markko: You might not have to go to Colombia after all. We finally got something on your Uncle Ray.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm thirsty. I want some water, do you hear me? Bottled water!",
        "Guard: Your 9 o'clock's here.",
        "Dorian: Thank you, show him in.",
        "Jackie: Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: Mr. McNaughton. Thank you very much for coming so quickly.",
        "Jackie: Well, your sister Addie's got brass ones.",
        "Dorian: I never noticed.",
        "Jackie: And I would have come regardless. R.J. Gannon always said that you were one of his favorite broads.",
        "Dorian: How very nice to hear.",
        "Jackie: So, what can I do for you?",
        "Dorian: You can get me the hell out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Shane? Has anybody seen a little boy? Shane?",
        "Bo: I'll talk to security.",
        "Gigi: He was right here when they brought Rex out. I don't know -- Brody. Oh, my God. Brody -- Brody took him.",
        "Bo: Gigi, Brody's behind bars.",
        "Gigi: For sure?",
        "Bo: For sure. Look, don't panic, okay? I'm sure Shane just wandered off somewhere, maybe to the rest room or something. But I know he's fine. Now, I'll be right back.",
        "Gigi: Where are you, Shane? Where are you, baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Excuse me, Sir? I'm looking for Lieutenant Lovett. Can you please tell me where he is?",
        "Officer: You alone? Where are your parents?",
        "Shane: Look, I just want to see --",
        "Reporter: Sergeant Lagno, can you confirm that a vet opened fire on Llantano Mountain?",
        "Second reporter: Who was the victim?",
        "Third reporter: Anyone local?",
        "Sergeant Lagno: I can't comment on that, guys.",
        "Reporter: Well, we hear a kid was involved and someone's dead.",
        "Sergeant Lagno: I don't know anything about this.",
        "Reporter: You must have some information. What can you tell us, please.",
        "Sergeant Lagno: I do not know.",
        "Reporter: Is there somebody who knows more that can help us?",
        "[All talking at once]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I saved you. Don't you know that? I saved your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Good night, stars. Good night, air. Good night noises everywhere.",
        "Tess: Want to see that? I'm sorry it was too cloudy tonight to see the first star.",
        "[Tess sighs]",
        "Tess: But it was there. Your daddy's watching over us. So say \"good night, daddy.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Where is everybody?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Your daddy loved you so much. And we are going to miss him and remember him every day for the rest of our lives. And I'm going to make sure you have a great life. You and your new baby brother or sister. That's what your dad would have wanted for us. I miss him.",
        "[Tess sobs]",
        "Tess: I wish he was here to kiss you good night. I wish that he was able to meet your new brother or sister. But he's not. Thanks to Aunt Natalie. She took care of that. So, um, say good night to Aunt Natalie. Pleasant dreams, Aunt Natalie. Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: If Clint Buchanan really set this up, why would he let you come over here and tell us about it?",
        "Starr: Well, what else was he going to do? Lock Cole in his room?",
        "Langston: Tell me again what he said. Did he actually admit that this whole thing was about getting back at Dorian?",
        "Cole: Well, no. He talked around why Ray was here. He started talking about my dad.",
        "Starr: Your dad? Why does your father have anything to do with this?",
        "Cole: He said that I wouldn't like it if someone took away from my dad something he worked for his whole life. He compared it to my wanting to keep the baby.",
        "Markko: Whoa.",
        "Cole: Yeah, and then he tried using the whole \"Nora and I have been good to you, right?\"",
        "Langston: Talk about blackmail.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it gets worse. He said he likes to reward loyalty. So if I kept quiet about this, I would have a future with the family.",
        "Starr: I never knew that Clint could be so grimy.",
        "Cole: He's really into it, Langston. I mean, I wouldn't put it past Clint to have made the whole thing up.",
        "Langston: Made it up? What are you talking about?",
        "Cole: I'm saying that Ray may not even be your Uncle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Look, Bree. It's Uncle Jared.",
        "Jared: What was that about?",
        "Tess: What? What was what about?",
        "Jared: Just now. It sounded like you were talking to Natalie.",
        "Tess: Well, yeah -- that. Bree and I say good night to everyone we love, every night, no matter where we are. We say good night to grandma, don't we? And Uncle Kevin and Uncle Joey and Aunt Natalie. Anyways, I should get this little munchkin to bed. Leave this here, huh? [Whispering] Oh, let's go, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Come on, Jared. You've got to put this together. You saw how creepy and weird she was acting. Just -- you've got to see it. She's -- you were talking to Tess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: He is not here. I have looked everywhere.",
        "Bo: Security hasn't seen him. I called in a report to the station.",
        "Gigi: Maybe he went home.",
        "Bo: No, Gigi. You stay with Balsom. Okay? I'll find Shane.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I thought I could make up for what I did to you. I mean, it doesn't matter, does it?",
        "Brody: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I shot you.",
        "Shane: Dad.",
        "Brody: I didn't mean to do it.",
        "Shane: Hey, Dad, you didn't shoot me. I'm right here. Dad, I'm fine. Dad!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: No, no. Shane is my responsibility.",
        "Bo: He's Balsom's son. You know, I'm no good at just standing around here waiting, but I am good at finding missing kids. That's the least I can do for Balsom while he's fighting for his life, so let me find Shane. You know, you were the last thing that Balsom saw before they took him to the O.R., and I think you should be the first thing that he sees when he comes back. That's what is going to keep him alive.",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Bo: You hear me? Are you okay?",
        "Gigi: I'll be okay. You find Shane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Hey, you're still here.",
        "Jared: Yeah. I just wanted to make sure you hadn't heard anything from Natalie.",
        "Tess: No. And frankly, it's pissing me off.",
        "Jared: What?",
        "Tess: Well, you know I have to take care of Bree, I have to take care of myself, I have to take care of this house. And she's just gone. Doesn't that bother you?",
        "Jared: Uh, it worries me. Okay? It's not like her. And -- well, I just wish I could tell her how much I miss her.",
        "Tess: Well, you know, I'm sure wherever she is, she knows that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Stuff it, you bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You know, I just don't understand how my sister could stay gone from you. She knows that you need her. I mean, here is this amazing guy, and she just dumps you the second you make a really big mistake.",
        "Jared: That's a little harsh, don't you think?",
        "Tess: No. You gave up everything to be with her. And she doesn't have the courage to face things with you now.",
        "Jared: Well, maybe she can't take you reminding her 500 times a day how miserable you are.",
        "Tess: I'm sorry if I talk about Nash too much.",
        "Jared: I just don't want you putting Natalie down.",
        "Tess: I just can't help it, Jared. I have lost the love of my life and Natalie still has hers, and she's blowing you off.",
        "Jared: That's not what she's doing.",
        "Tess: Well, come on. You know she's gone. She hasn't told any of us where she went. She obviously doesn't want any of us to find her. And I just -- I can't help wondering --",
        "Jared: What?",
        "Tess: Well, if she really did love you, why did she leave?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Okay, Clint Buchanan might have set this whole thing in motion, but Ray Montez is definitely my uncle.",
        "Cole: Well, why are you so sure?",
        "Langston: He showed the judge all sorts of I.D. in court.",
        "Cole: It could all be fake, Langston.",
        "Langston: And he told me stories about my mom that I know are true, and he gave me this necklace, and he had that photo of him and my mom.",
        "Langston: What? Why are you all looking at me like that?",
        "Markko: Lang, all that stuff could be faked. I mean, your Uncle Ray could be working you.",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Cole: Langston, look. He may be your real uncle, but I got a real sleazy vibe off this guy when I saw him with Clint.",
        "Starr: Yeah, and the Buchanans have so many connections, Langston. That judge could have been paid off.",
        "Langston: They don't own the justice system.",
        "Cole: We're just thinking about you.",
        "Langston: Okay, well think about this. Dorian arranged for a quick adoption. Nobody even knew about it.",
        "Starr: Except for Uncle Ray, who filed an injunction to stop the adoption.",
        "Cole: Which means that judge or someone in that courthouse is in Buchanan's pocket.",
        "Langston: I can't believe this. All I wanted was a connection to my parents. And Clint Buchanan may be using this to get back at Dorian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Your sister says you're only in for contempt. Now, the judge will let you out by tomorrow morning.",
        "Dorian: No, no. Tomorrow will be too late. My foster daughter, Langston, is about to be dragged out of the country by a man who is claiming to be her uncle.",
        "Jackie: So I hear.",
        "Dorian: I have got to stop him. And R.J. says that you are an expert at, uh, this kind of thing.",
        "Jackie: What do you want me to do? Bust you out tonight?",
        "Dorian: I want you -- to fix it.",
        "Jackie: What is it you're really asking me to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Excuse me, could you tell me how Rex Balsom is doing?",
        "Nurse: Is he here in the E.R.?",
        "Gigi: He's in surgery right now, but maybe you could check on him for me.",
        "Nurse: Are you a family member?",
        "Gigi: No, but --",
        "Nurse: I can't tell you anything, then. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sergeant Lagno: A guy name Rex Balsom was shot. He's in surgery.",
        "Reporter: Do they think he's going to make it?",
        "Sergeant Lagno: I have no idea.",
        "Reporter: Anything on the suspect?",
        "Sergeant Lagno: Yeah, a guy named Brody Lovett. We have him in custody.",
        "First Reporter: And what about the kid?",
        "Second reporter: My source says Lovett him up --",
        "Bo: All right, all right. Everybody out.",
        "[Confused arguing]",
        "Bo: You know what? When we're ready to have a press briefing, you all will be the first to know. Thank you.",
        "Bo: Did you see a kid in here, about ten years old, dark blond hair?",
        "Sergeant Lagno: Oh, yes sir, I did. Just a little while ago, he was asking for Lovett.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Dad?",
        "Brody: I thought I could make up for what I did to you.",
        "Shane: What you did to me?",
        "Brody: Why won't you leave me alone? I had no choice. I thought you were going to kill me.",
        "Shane: Who was going to kill you? Dad, it's Shane. I'm your son.",
        "Brody: You're not my son!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You know, what I don't understand is why didn't she suggest that the two of you run away together?",
        "Jared: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I can't stand this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Maybe she didn't want to ask me to leave my dad, or --",
        "Tess: Well, maybe -- that's really your decision, isn't it?",
        "Jared: I guess she didn't want to put me in that position.",
        "Tess: No, Jared. I don't think that Natalie thought for one second what this would do to you. She treats you like garbage and she calls it love.",
        "Jared: I'm going to go to bed.",
        "Tess: Jared, you don't deserve this at all. But to be honest with you, I'm not really surprised.",
        "Jared: Why?",
        "Tess: Well, Natalie -- it's complicated. She's never really known what true love is, and that's why it's never really worked out with her and any other man. You know, you can't really blame her. She's had Roxy for a role model. It's just -- it's kind of always been about her, you know? It's like she's starring in her own movie, and we're all just extras. She doesn't really care about what anybody --",
        "Jared: Enough! Okay? Watch your damned mouth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Yeah! Give it to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You listen to me. It's one thing for you to commiserate with me or to analyze why Natalie did this, but you're not going to trash her to me. Okay? You're never going to do that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Why would Clint Buchanan use me to get back at Dorian?",
        "Starr: Well, because he knows that you're practically, like, Dorian's child. And he knows how much Dorian cares about her children.",
        "Cole: Yeah, she's right, Langston. Clint Buchanan, he's desperate to get back at Dorian.",
        "Langston: Maybe he found out that I was looking for my relatives. Maybe that's how he got onto Uncle Ray. I keep feeling like I made this happen.",
        "Markko: There's nothing wrong with wanting a connection to your folks.",
        "Cole: Langston, I totally get you on that connection. I did some really stupid things because I wanted the same thing.",
        "Markko: This is a good thing, don't you see? You out Clint Buchanan for his role in this and you don't have to leave anymore.",
        "Langston: Cole, I really appreciate you coming over here and telling me this. And I really want to believe that this means that I don't have to go to South America, but --",
        "Markko: But what?",
        "Langston: But the judge still said that Uncle Ray is my legal guardian. So what difference does any of this make? Who's to stop him from dragging me to wherever he wants me to go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I admire your directness, Mr. McNaughton.",
        "Jackie: It's more like confusion. I really don't know what it is that you want.",
        "Dorian: All right, I'll keep it simple for you. I've got a problem. A big problem. And it's a lot bigger than the fact that I've been unfairly tossed in this jail.",
        "Jackie: Okay.",
        "Dorian: There is an evil man. He's calling himself Ray Montez, and he's convinced everybody that he's a blood relative of my foster daughter, Langston. He stopped my adoption of her and he managed to get himself declared her legal guardian. And now his intention is to take her to Colombia.",
        "Jackie: And how does the kid feel about this?",
        "Dorian: She is horrified. And I want to stop this deviant from taking her out of the United States of America.",
        "Jackie: Come on, you must know how to work the system. And you have enough cash to hire a fancy lawyer. You don't need me.",
        "Dorian: No, no, no. Um, Mr. McNaughton, I think I need you very much.",
        "Jackie: You still haven't told me for what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I think you're wrong, Lang. Knowing that Clint Buchanan is behind your Uncle Ray makes a huge difference.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it does. Because now Aunt Dorian can really do something about it. She can drag Ray to court and prove that the whole thing was a set-up.",
        "Cole: Yeah, Langston, this is huge.",
        "Starr: Huge.",
        "Markko: That's right, but we can't waste any time. Your Uncle Ray is going to be banging on the door first thing tomorrow morning.",
        "Starr: Markko's right. You need to fight. And you need to fight now. And you need to fight just as dirty as Clint Buchanan is.",
        "Langston: Sounds like I need to talk to Dorian.",
        "Starr: Well, yeah. I mean, she did write the book on how to play dirty.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Langston: She is kind of like my mom now.",
        "Markko: Exactly. Now let's keep it that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sergeant Lagno: Sorry, Sir. I'm -- he must have slipped away while I was dealing with those reporters.",
        "Bo: Oh, he must have slipped away.",
        "Sergeant Lagno: Well, those reporters were firing questions at me --",
        "Bo: To hell with the reporters. I called in a report on that kid. He was at the scene of a shooting. You know what? You decide to play to the cameras again, I will take that badge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Please just go away and leave me alone.",
        "Shane: No, I won't leave you. I'm your son. Dad, it's Shane. I'm your son, you know that.",
        "Brody: Go away!",
        "Shane: Dad, no, no! No -- Dad, no!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen.",
        "Gigi: You found him? Oh, my baby, you found him.",
        "Bo: Yeah, he's sitting right here behind me.",
        "Gigi: Thank God -- thank you, thank you. Where was he?",
        "Bo: He was down in the jail cells. He was visiting with Brody. I had a feeling that's where he'd be.",
        "Gigi: I was thinking that, too.",
        "Bo: He's sure not stupid. He was able to get down to the cells without much of a problem, really.",
        "Gigi: Did Brody hurt him?",
        "Bo: No, no, he just upset him, that's all. Any word on Balsom?",
        "Gigi: No, nothing.",
        "Bo: Do you want Shane down there at the hospital with you?",
        "Gigi: Um, Marcie would probably stay with him if I asked her to, but I don't want him to see the house like Brody left it.",
        "Bo: Right, we'll be right there.",
        "Shane: What did you do to my dad? He was saying all kinds of wacky stuff.",
        "Bo: He's confused right now. He's -- he's really hurting.",
        "Shane: Because he was in the war?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah, come on. Let's go see your mom.",
        "Shane: I want to stay for my dad. I'm afraid he's going to hurt himself or something.",
        "Bo: Look, you don't have to worry about him, okay? Because I have a doctor coming who specializes in cases like his. He's on his way right now.",
        "Shane: The doctor's coming? You're positive?",
        "Bo: I am.",
        "Shane: I hope Dad's going to be okay.",
        "Bo: So do I. Come on, your mom needs you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Jared, I love my sister. I was not trashing her.",

        "Jared: Yeah, I shouldn't take it out on you. I'm a little stressed out.",
        "Tess: No.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You know, I'm sorry, too. It might have sounded that I was being critical about Natalie, it's just -- I look at you and I can see how badly you're hurt, you know?",

        "Tess: No, Jared, don't go. I -- I started it. I'm not angry with you at all.",
        "Jared: That's okay. I know we're both really worried.",
        "Tess: Definitely. You know, I guess the only reason that I talk about Natalie is I can see that she's always on your mind, and it's nice to have someone to talk to. You know, I put Bree to bed at night and I kind of feel a little bit lost. I just don't want to be alone.",

        "Jackie: Yeah, I get that. But what is it you want me to do?",
        "Dorian: Isn't it obvious? I need you to protect my daughter from a criminal.",

        "Jared: Right. For a second I almost forgot.",
        "Tess: You know, it's a shame that we don't know where she is, because her and Rex are really close. She would be devastated if she found this out.",

Huh? But that's the real you anyway, isn't it, Natalie? You only care about yourself. You don't give a damn about anybody else. Otherwise, if you did, you would have ratted out Jared the second you found out that he wasn't a Buchanan, huh? That way no one would have gotten hurt. We'd still have the company, and I'd still have the love of my life. I'll see you.",

        "Shane: It was an accident.",
        "Gigi: After I left the house this morning, Brody tore it all up, and he started drinking. And Marcie came over, and she saw him like that. He knocked her down, and then when he came to pick you up from school, you know why he was doing that? Because he was going to take you away from me.",
        "Shane: We were camping. Dad called you and told you that.",
        "Gigi: Well, if he told you that, then he was lying, because I never got any messages from him.",
        "Shane: You probably didn't even check. All you care about is Rex.",
