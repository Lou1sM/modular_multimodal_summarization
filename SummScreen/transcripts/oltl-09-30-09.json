        "Ross tries to convince Blair to get over Todd and leave him and Tea alone. He takes her back to shore and they go to the cabana at the country club where Tea and Todd are honeymooning so Blair can ruin it. Blair changes her mind at the last minute and decides to leave. Ross drops the check that Dorian gave him. When Tea comes to the door to get the breakfast that room service brought, she sees the check on the ground.",
        "David gives Bo a copy of the footage from his reality TV show that reveals Matthew and Destiny talking about Matthew seeing his parents kissing the night before his mother married his uncle. Bo later shows it to Nora. They are both glad that Matthew didn't use that information to undermine their credibility in court. Clint and Nora try to convince Matthew to change his mind about having the surgery in light of their loss of confidence in Dr Evans after his mistake that caused his brother to become comatose. Matthew protests that he knows the risks and this isn't even the same kind of surgery that Shaun had. Matthew goes to the hospital to find Dr Evans and ask how soon he can have the surgery. Dr Evans informs him that he will not perform the surgery.",
        "Someone keeps calling Jared and he doesn't answer the phone. John and Brody both find that odd and suspect that Jared is involved with the stalker. While John is questioning everyone about what they were doing when the stalker struck, he finds it unusual that Jared was with his father on every occasion. Natalie thinks it is ridiculous that John is accusing Jared. Finally, Jared goes upstairs alone and calls the person back. That person is a blond man who is out on the terrace at Llanfair watching Jessica and Jared. David gives John another copy of his reality TV show footage. John watches the clip of Jessica coming out on the terrace thinking she has seen Nash. When he zooms in on the bush by the door, he sees a man hiding there. It is the same man that Jared is talking to on the telephone."

        "Blair: Ross? Oh.",

        "David: Hey, Dad. You got a minute for your firstborn?",
        "Bo: Don't push it, David.",
        "David: I just wanted you to see this.",
        "[Bo sighs]",
        "Bo: All right, what is it?",
        "David: It's the footage from my reality show. I used my own money--no one else's but my own--to convert it to DVD.",
        "Bo: Do I look like I have time to watch a--a failed TV show?",
        "David: Yeah, well, you're going to want to see this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: McBain.",
        "Clint: Yeah, it's Clint Buchanan. Do you have any leads on who beat up Jared? Because I was wondering if it might be the same creep who's been stalking my daughters.",
        "John: I'm working on it right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I'm fine.",
        "Natalie: No, you totally overdid it yesterday and you just--you need to rest.",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: You know what I need? More coffee.",
        "Natalie: Uh--uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. You give me that and you stay where you are.",
        "Jared: Why? You are taking away my incentive to heal.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. You want incentive? Try this.",
        "Jared: Oh. Mmm.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jared: What do you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think you're going?",
        "Brody: I just wanted to go for a walk.",
        "Jessica: No. No, you're not. Get in here. If I know you, you're heading to the gym to get on the treadmill and your stitches aren't even out yet. You are going in there, and I am going to make you some breakfast.",
        "Brody: Jessica, I officially hate this now.",
        "Jessica: Well, Brody, let me give you a piece of advice. Don't try to duke it out with one of the Buchanan sisters, because you will go down the first round.",
        "[Brody chuckles]",
        "Jared: I told you not to call me here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Oh, you are a sight for sore eyes.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Nora: How are you? Any word about the stalker?",
        "Clint: Ah. McBain is playing it close to the vest.",
        "Nora: Well, Bo has made this his top priority, so I'm sure they're going to find this guy.",
        "Clint: Yeah. What about Matthew? Any word on the appeal?",
        "Nora: No. But the judge said that she'll make her decision very quickly.",
        "Clint: Well, she'd better. Is Matthew still in a rush to schedule his surgery?",
        "Nora: Yeah, but you know, everything's kind of changed now. Dr. Evans no longer looks like the miracle man. And how could he after he almost killed his own brother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: Hey, Gary Poppins. They gave you a medal for bravery. Cool, right? Too bad they don't give medals for being butt-ugly. You would have won years ago. Come on. Wake up.",
        "Greg: Destiny...",
        "Destiny: I read somewhere that even when people are like Shaun is right now, they can still hear. I was trying to make him so mad that he'd wake up and tell me what's what.",
        "Greg: Hey, he's got nothing but love for you. I'm the one he should be mad at.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Ah.",
        "Blair: What is wrong with you? We're stranded on this boat with no keys, thanks to you, and you want to take a swim instead of getting somebody to rescue us?",
        "Ross: You should try it. It's a little chilly, but refreshing.",
        "Blair: Why don't you drip somewhere else? Hey! Help! Help!",
        "Ross: Help, help! Help! Nobody can hear you. Besides, what's the rush, Blair? The wedding's over. Todd and T\u00e9a are hitched. The deed is done.",
        "Blair: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Good morning, Mrs. Manning.",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "Todd: Is something wrong?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, nothing's wrong, I just--I don't--I don't think I can be Mrs. Manning.",
        "Todd: You can't back out now. We're married, officially. We said the \"I do's.\" We sealed the deal last night in this bed. You are my wife.",
        "T\u00e9a: And I'm very happy to be your wife. But I'm keeping my own name.",
        "Todd: Oh, jeez. That's what you're talking about?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Oh, God, you had me going there for a second. Especially after everything you were talking about before the ceremony. \"Todd, I have something important to tell you.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I know.",
        "Todd: Listen, I don't care that you spent all those years with Ross Rayburn. Nothing you can say or do is going to change anything with me. Okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",
        "Todd: And, you know, I'm not exactly perfect.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm. That's what I like best about you.",
        "Todd: Why don't you take my name then?",
        "T\u00e9a: Honestly?",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm.",
        "T\u00e9a: 'Cause it used to be Blair's name.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Well, you better get used to it, Blair. Todd and T\u00e9a are now Mrs. and Mrs. Manning.",
        "Blair: Well, she's also Mrs. Rayburn, too, isn't she? So that kind of undoes everything, doesn't it? But you know, that's all right. When Todd finds out that he married her and she still kept you a secret, T\u00e9a is going to have hell to pay.",
        "Ross: Calm down, hotshot.",
        "Blair: Don't you dare tell me to calm down. And don't call me \"hotshot,\" okay?",
        "Ross: Oh, okay. Someone got up on the wrong side of the boat this morning.",
        "Blair: I just want to do what I came here to do. I want to get off this damn boat!",
        "Ross: And what else, ruin Todd and T\u00e9a's happiness?",
        "Blair: What is wrong with you? You know, you could have filed those divorce papers, but you didn't. So why are you suddenly so gung ho about the Todd and T\u00e9a marital bliss, huh?",
        "Ross: I'm just saying--",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Ross: Just because you have damning information doesn't mean you got to use it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: I can't believe my parents' lawyer made them look like such saints and made me look like an idiot. He talked to me like I was two years old.",
        "Destiny: You didn't come off that way. I was the fool that talked about Justin and Becca and all that.",
        "Matthew: Oh, don't blame yourself. It's not your fault if my case looks bad.",
        "Destiny: What are you thinking?",
        "Matthew: I don't know. Maybe I should tell the judge that my parents aren't such reasonable people. Maybe I should tell him that I saw my mom and dad kiss the night before she married my Uncle Clint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Matthew--",
        "Matthew: You want to use what happened to Shaun to get the judge to stop me from having my operation.",
        "Nora: Sweetheart, I feel so badly about Shaun, and I feel so badly for his parents and what they must be going through. But Dr. Evans made an unethical and very arrogant choice to operate on his own brother. And things went horribly wrong. I don't want that to happen with you.",
        "Matthew: Mom, we've talked about this a million times! I'm okay with the risks! I want to walk again. And the judge agreed with me that it's my decision.",
        "Clint: Matthew, I'll tell you one thing. You've got guts. And it's too bad your grandpa is not here to see this. I mean, bringing suit against your own parents? Asa would have been proud of that.",
        "Matthew: I don't know. Sometimes I can just hear him say, \"Who do you think you are, doing this to your mom and dad? Get over here so I can whip you.\"",
        "Clint: Huh. Well, Asa didn't want anybody to hurt one of his family. And he'd stop anybody who tried to hurt one of his own. And that applied to us, too, if he thought that we were out to hurt ourselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You know where I am--at home, with Jessica and Natalie and--I got to go.",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Brody: Everything okay?",
        "[Jared scoffs]",
        "Jared: Co-workers. They don't want to listen to a word you say when you're in the same room, then you want a little downtime and--",
        "[Brody chuckles]",
        "Jared: They can't run the place without you.",
        "Jessica: Breakfast.",
        "Brody: You made pancakes?",
        "Jessica: I did. Natalie and I want our guys to be energized.",
        "Jared: And fat?",
        "Jessica: No. We want to make sure that you build up your strength so you can take of yourselves in case something else, you know, dangerous happens.",
        "Jared: For the record, I wasn't a hero like Brody. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Natalie: Hi.",
        "John: Hi.",
        "Natalie: Come in.",
        "John: Yeah? You got a minute?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, did you--did you find anything out about who jumped Jared?",
        "John: No, we don't have a suspect yet.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Um--why are you here?",
        "John: I just need to ask a few more questions.",
        "Natalie: Ask who?",
        "John: If it's okay--all of you.",
        "Natalie: Uh--right. That's fine. Uh--hey, don't get excited. The stalker's still out there, but John--John has like a few more questions.",
        "John: Hey. Sorry to interrupt your breakfast. I was just wondering, Jessica, if maybe you remembered something since the last time we spoke.",
        "Jessica: Okay, sure.",
        "John: You sure the first time you saw something was at the engagement party?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I saw someone at the lodge, and I went outside, and he was there, and I thought it was Nash. But I know how that sounds, and now I know better.",
        "John: Any incidents before that?",
        "Jessica: No--um--the day of my mom's wedding--wait, that's when the guy posing as Nash gave Bree the elephant. And then--and then he drew a heart in the condensation on the window.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you know, we--we told you all of that. I mean, and also, she saw him near the grave. And then he sent us that DVD of Nash, and then he attacked Jared, beat him up.",
        "John: And that's it?",
        "Jessica: No. There was another time. I thought I saw someone lurking around on the terrace, hiding in the bushes. I thought it was the guy that was posing as Nash.",
        "John: But it wasn't?",
        "Jessica: No. It was another man skulking around. It was the producer for David Vickers' reality TV show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You really think you could win this case by ratting out your parents? All you'll do is mess up your mom's marriage, big-time.",
        "David: Yeah. The battery ran out. I had no idea we caught all that on tape. I saw it this morning when I was going through my greatest bits for my reel.",
        "Bo: That is an invasion of privacy. And get off my desk.",
        "David: Well, Dad, I didn't mean to catch Matthew and his little friend. I hid the camera hoping to catch Nigel stealing the silver or something. Then I found out that you made out with Nora. I knew it--I knew it all along.",
        "Bo: All right. I get it, David. So now, you've got it on DVD. Now what? You blackmailing me? You going to make me bankroll you or you go to Clint?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Matthew, I know that you love your family.",
        "Matthew: Well, of course I do.",
        "Clint: And so do I. And that's why I brought Dr. Evans to town. 'Cause I love your parents. And you. But if I had known that it would tear this family apart, I never would have done it. The bottom line, Matthew, is, nobody wants to lose you.",
        "Matthew: I know that, and we don't have to keep talking about it.",
        "Nora: Yes, we do, because we now understand the kind of mistakes that Dr. Evans can make.",
        "Matthew: Mom, what happened to Shaun isn't going to happen to me. It's not even the same operation.",
        "Nora: Okay, Matthew, Shaun wanted to have this operation because Dr. Evans guaranteed him it would make him better, and he was wrong. Honey, you have seen what this has done to--to Shaun's parents. And to Destiny? That could be us. That could be Rachel and me and your daddy sitting in a waiting room at a hospital. With our son somewhere between life and death.",
        "Clint: Matthew, just take a little more time to think about it.",
        "Matthew: I got to go see Dr. Evans.",
        "Nora: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for everything you said.",
        "Clint: Yeah. I just hope that I got through to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You think he's mad at you? For what? The same reason I was?",
        "Greg: And you have every right to be mad at me.",
        "Destiny: I'm sorry about what I said. I was just so upset. I know you did the best job you could.",
        "Greg: You can't know that, Des.",
        "Destiny: You're still the best doctor in the world. You'll see that when you operate on Matthew.",
        "Greg: Well, that probably won't happen.",
        "Destiny: You mean, you didn't hear? The court said Matthew could have the surgery, no matter what his parents say. I thought he called you.",
        "Greg: I haven't checked my messages.",
        "Destiny: I've been playing the CD Rachel brought for him.",
        "Greg: I hope he can hear it.",
        "Destiny: He can. And you know how he's into detective books.",
        "Greg: No, I didn't know that.",
        "Destiny: He's obsessed. Always tries to figure out who did it before the book gives it up. I've been reading him one of them. He'll get better. You'll see.",
        "Greg: I can't be your superhero, Des. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hmm. You know what I'm thinking?",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you thinking?",
        "Todd: I'm thinking that's a lot of bling.",
        "[Todd yawns]",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what I'm thinking?",
        "Todd: What are you thinking?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm thinking...I'm taken. This should keep most of the creeps who hit on me away.",
        "Todd: I'm thinking, you know, you can't testify against me in court anymore, now that you're my wife, in case I commit a crime.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no, I can't be forced to testify against you. I can choose to testify against you if I want to.",
        "Todd: I guess I'd better be good to you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, you'd better be good to me, period. Because I can't defend you anymore. You know that, right?",
        "Todd: You don't need to do that anymore. You married a saint, my friend. Trust me.",
        "T\u00e9a: I want to. I need to feel safe, okay? I need to feel like I--I can tell you anything.",
        "Todd: And you can, always.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: You were being honest with me yesterday, right? When you told me that you were doing this because you wanted Todd?",
        "Blair: I don't recall what I said yesterday. I think I had too much to drink.",
        "[Ross chuckles]",
        "Ross: Well, I'll--I'll refresh your memory. We talked about loving someone who loves someone else, and how it's a no-win situation--how sometimes--sometimes, maybe you just ought to let them go. Remember?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Ross: Look, I'm glad I stopped you from making a fool of yourself at Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding. I just hoped that by this morning, you would see that I was right.",
        "Blair: And why do you care whether I make a fool of myself or not, Ross?",
        "Ross: Well, maybe it's because I like you, Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Just be straight with me, David. You're still trying to get your hands on the family money, right?",
        "David: By blackmailing my own father? I wouldn't do that. I wanted to make sure that that DVD didn't fall into the wrong hands.",
        "Bo: Uh-huh.",
        "David: Oh, I know what you're thinking. That I made copies, right? Well, I didn't. And do you know why? Because I couldn't figure out how to do it, so there's just the one.",
        "Bo: Really?",
        "David: Thanks to my technical ignorance, Uncle Clint will never find out what's on that disc.",
        "Clint: Vickers, what the hell are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I know why you're so worried. Every day someone's unconscious, their odds go down. But tons of people come out of it. No matter what people say, our brother's going to be one of them. He has to. He has too much to come back for.",
        "Greg: Yeah. Well, it's important to think positive, but--",
        "Destiny: Greg, talking all negative around him won't help. I'm going to go get some water. You want anything?",
        "Greg: No, I'm fine.",
        "Matthew: Hey. Are you okay?",
        "Destiny: I'm better now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Jessica, when you first saw this person at the lodge, you were alone, right?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: Do you all remember where you were?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Actually, Jared and I went to another room because I was really upset about something that happened at the party and he was calming me down.",
        "John: What happened next?",
        "Natalie: There were some framed pictures sitting on a table and we were talking about them.",
        "John: What about 'em?",
        "Natalie: It was a picture of Jess and Nash. We were talking about what happened to him. And then we went back and joined the party. That's when the lights went out.",
        "Jessica: I saw those pictures, too, right before I thought I saw Nash.",
        "John: What happened next?",
        "Jessica: I went outside for some air.",
        "Brody: When I realized it was a blackout, I went looking for her.",
        "Jared: And I went to find the circuit breaker.",
        "John: Anyone go with you?",
        "Jared: My father.",
        "John: And he was there the whole time?",
        "Jared: Yes.",
        "John: And was anyone besides Jessica here when Bree got this elephant?",
        "Natalie: I was, but I came after it happened.",
        "John: Did you see the heart in the window?",
        "Natalie: No, I didn't.",
        "John: Jared?",
        "Jared: No, I took my dad fishing.",
        "John: Ah. So your dad backs you up when the lights go out and when Bree got the elephant?",
        "Natalie: Why are you doing this, John?",
        "John: It's my job to ask these questions. You know that.",
        "Natalie: No, you're accusing Jared of doing all of this.",
        "John: I'm not accusing anyone of anything.",
        "Natalie: Well, sure as hell sounds like you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You do trust me, don't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mostly. Although you lost me a bit during the wedding ceremony.",
        "Todd: I already explained that.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Looking for Blair, missing her at our wedding.",
        "Todd: I wasn't missing Blair, I was--I was worried she was going to show up and ruin everything, honestly. It's true. And you know, who insisted we invite her, anyway?",
        "T\u00e9a: I only invited her to rub it in.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know why I did that. I have nothing to prove to her.",
        "Todd: God, can we stop all the Blair talk, please? Blair talk--all this stuff about the past. Let's just concentrate on the present moment, please. This is our first day as husband and wife.",
        "T\u00e9a: Any ideas on how you'd like to spend it? Mm-hmm.",
        "[T\u00e9a giggles]",
        "Todd: All right, check this out.",
        "[T\u00e9a laughs loudly]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Usually when somebody says something nice, like \"I like you,\" you would respond in kind with, \"thank you.\"",
