        "At Victor's home, everybody is wondering what to do with Irene and Todd on the loose. Bo wants to believe Starr that Irene wrote the death threat letter but needs proof which she can't give him since the letter was written in \"invisible ink.\" Bo has no alternative but to arrest Starr. Outside, Tina's dog escapes and she doesn't even know it until hours after she's been at Viki's. She runs into Cord unexpectedly, and he is not happy to see her knowing all of the foolish things she did in 2009 that endangered Natalie as well as their own daughter Sarah. The dog seems to know that Irene has planted a digital time bomb outside Victor's home although the people inside are completely distracted without a clue. Jessica and Natalie have been injured when they got into their fight. Viki goes to talk to Natalie somehow knowing that her daughter might not be doing the right thing by marrying Brody, because she is not over John. When Jessica is alone, she notices Tina's purse on the floor and discovers the document that may prove the accurate results of the DNA test that John is the father of Natalie's baby and not Brody."

        "Jessica: Ow.",
        "Brody: All right. Here you go. Almost there.",
        "Natalie: All right. You know what? I can't believe that you made me go to the E.R. I'm fine. It's not even like Jessica hurt me -- ow! -- that much.",
        "Brody: Mm-hmm. I think she could have killed you I if I hadn't showed up when I did.",
        "Natalie: Uh, not if I killed her first.",
        "Brody: How did this happen, anyway?",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] Jessica found out that we were engaged.",
        "Brody: Already? How?",
        "Natalie: Dad told her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Rex won't make it easy.",
        "Cord: I can understand that. I know what it's like to lose the woman that you love.",
        "Clint: He was crazy about that girl.",
        "Cord: Some people you can never get over it.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Tina: Cord.",
        "Cord: Tina.",
        "Tina: [Chuckles] Oh, my God. It -- it's you! It's really you!",
        "Cord: Don't even think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You guys are supposed to know better. You're the adults.",
        "Blair: Okay, why don't you stop obsessing about Todd? We -- we've got to deal with Starr. We've got to figure out what we're gonna do. Tell you what -- I'm gonna take her home. When or if the cops show up, you talk to them first. Then we'll know what we're dealing with.",
        "T\u00e9a: That sounds like a good idea. It'll buy us some time. Come on.",
        "Jack: Too late.",
        "Bo: Where the hell is Todd Manning?",
        "Todd: What are you waiting for, Irene? Come on. It's right here in my hand. Come on out and claim your prize. We'll end this nonsense once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Okay. The sitter's gone. Liam's sound asleep. You know, he did that little, uh, gurgle-laugh thing he does.",
        "Natalie: [Chuckles] [Groans]",
        "Brody: And I kissed him good night without him waking up.",
        "Natalie: Don't make me laugh. It hurts.",
        "Brody: Okay. So, how did you and Jessica come to blows?",
        "Natalie: Okay, so, I ran into her in Angel Square. I figured it was probably a good time to tell her we that we were engaged 'cause I didn't want her to hear it from somebody else.",
        "Brody: So much for that.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Mm. Anyway, yeah. It was a surprise to see her there, and I was definitely nervous, but, I mean, look, I... I went out of my way not -- not to throw it in her face, and I just gave her an invitation to get in mine.",
        "Brody: What did she say?",
        "Natalie: Oh, the usual. How we betrayed her. How I took what was hers.",
        "Brody: Well, it looks like it was maybe a little worse than that.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. She kind of threw in how she was sorry that I was, um, ever really a Buchanan and how I ruined her perfect little life with her and Kevin and Joey and Mom and Dad.",
        "Brody: Sorry.",
        "Natalie: Mm. But even with all of that, I was trying to calm her down, you know? And just to make some peace, but then she just kept going at it, and then I --",
        "[Cup thuds]",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] I finally just snapped.",
        "Brody: I don't blame you. So, what did you do?",
        "Natalie: I said something to Jessica. Something that really hit below the belt.",
        "Jessica: [Sighs]",
        "Natalie: I am just as much a part of this family as you are. In fact, no -- I am more a part of this family because Dad isn't even your father! Mitch Laurence is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: How dare you come running at me with your arms open as if nothing ever happened, Tina?",
        "Tina: W-- what's wrong? I mean, what did I do wrong now?",
        "Cord: What did you do? Oh, I don't know. How about that time when Tess was holding Natalie in that secret room for months on end and you did nothing, Tina?",
        "Tina: Cord, you don't understand.",
        "Cord: What don't I understand, Tina?",
        "Tina: You don't know everything that happened.",
        "Cord: What? I don't understand your greed? I don't understand your desperation to hold on to those Mendorran jewels?",
        "Tina: What? They -- they were the crown jewels of Mendorra. The crown jewels!",
        "Cord: I don't care what kind of jewels they were. Did you not understand that Natalie suffered for months on end, because all you were worried about was Tess ratting you out, because you stole the jewels?",
        "Tina: But you don't know everything that happened. It's more complicated. Let -- let me just start at the beginning, all right? You see, my dog led me down there, and then she was gonna lock us both down there. And do you have any idea how bad that was gonna be for me and my little dog, too?",
        "David Vickers: [Barking]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Isn't he, um, still in police custody?",
        "Bo: Save it, T\u00e9a. Manning escaped. He headed straight here.",
        "Starr: How do you know that?",
        "Bo: Because Jack called 911. He reported it.",
        "Starr: Jack, how could you do that?!",
        "Jack: He killed my father.",
        "Bo: Where is he now?",
        "T\u00e9a: He took off. We don't know where.",
        "Bo: You don't?",
        "Blair: Look, she's telling the truth, Bo.",
        "Bo: Okay. Fine. Whose car was he driving?",
        "Jack: Probably Starr's.",
        "Starr: Jack.",
        "Jack: You want the plate number?",
        "Starr: [Scoffs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, Bo, we do know this -- Todd's mother has been looking to get something back from him for years. Right before he left, Todd found it, and then he went running out of here to look for Irene Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I have what you want.",
        "Irene: Really? I thought you couldn't remember where it was. Now all of a sudden, your memory has returned? How convenient.",
        "Todd: What can I say? Being locked up, drugged, and tortured for eight years kind of did a number on my head -- thanks to you.",
        "Irene: Still blaming your mummy for your troubles? Very clich\u00e9.",
        "Todd: See, the funny thing is that, in order to survive, I spent my whole time thinking about my family. If your goons hadn't been lighting me up like a Christmas tree, I might have remembered your stupid microchip.",
        "Irene: So...where is it?",
        "Todd: It's in Victor Lord's ring -- my father Victor Lord's ring. I put it there eight years ago.",
        "Irene: Are you joking?!",
        "Todd: You have threatened my entire family. I'm not joking.",
        "Irene: Victor Jr. had the chip all of this time, and he didn't even know it? [Chuckles] I had it right in my little hand not too long ago. And I gave it to Tina.",
        "Todd: I know. I had to wrestle jewelry away from Tina Lord. It's a good thing I still have teeth.",
        "Irene: So you have it? Where is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: Tina, I really don't care how bad it was for you and your little dog. Bottom line here -- you would do anything, you would hurt anyone, you would steamroll over everyone if you thought that they were gonna get in the way of you trying to get money.",
        "Viki: So, are you hungry?",
        "Clint: Starving.",
        "Viki: Well, then, let's get a snack.",
        "Clint: We'll let you two talk.",
        "Cord: Uh, you really don't have to leave on my account, because I've got nothing to say to my ex.",
        "Clint: Something tells me that you do.",
        "Viki: Cord, oh, it's lovely to see you. As you were.",
        "Cord: Okay, Tina, maybe they're right. Maybe I got a lot to say to you.",
        "Tina: Good... because I have a lot to say to you, too.",
        "Cord: Fine. Why don't you go first? Let's talk about how your greed almost got our daughter killed.",
        "Clint: So, after three years, Tina shows up just in time for the reading of your brother's will?",
        "Viki: How did you guess?",
        "Clint: [Sighs] That woman has some kind of free-money radar.",
        "Viki: Mm. She probably should have stayed at home, because that will left every single penny to Irene. Not one thing to T\u00e9a or the children.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, no. That's never gonna stand.",
        "Viki: Well, I don't think so, either, but, frankly, I can't underestimate Irene, my old college chum. She will stop at nothing to get what she wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: Give me that ring.",
        "Todd: Not so fast. The only way you get your hands on this ring is if you give me the gun that I gave to my friend Louie. I want proof that I didn't kill my brother right now.",
        "Irene: Fair enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I couldn't stop my-- ow! -- Stop myself. She kept pushing my buttons, especially when she was saying the stuff about me not being a part of the family and belonging with the family.",
        "Brody: But you know your family loves you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. In my heart, yeah. But there were -- for the longest time, that is -- that is how I felt. You know, I resented the fact that we were twins and I was raised with Roxy, and she just had this great life. And she got to wear cute dresses and be a ballerina.",
        "Brody: Well, for what it's worth, I've never really seen you as the ballerina type.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs]",
        "Brody: Besides, though, you don't really believe that anymore, do you?",
        "Natalie: Honestly, um... how I'm feeling right now with us getting married, I, um... kind of feel like an outsider again. But that doesn't change anything, you know? It's not gonna stop me from marrying you. I just know that I'm gonna lose them. I'm gonna lose my family.",
        "Jessica: [Thinking] Is this where crazy comes out? Crazy out? You are Mitch Laurence's psycho daughter and you always will be. [Growls]",
        "[Clattering]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: It was bad enough that you let Jessica's alter run all over Natalie, but you just had to drag our daughter into another one of your scams.",
        "Tina: I never wanted to get Sarah involved. I had no idea that Carlo Hesser had anything to do with the Mendorran government. I mean, he still blames me for the death of his son, which was not my fault.",
        "Cord: It never is, Tina.",
        "Tina: Look, I never would have gone anywhere near those jewels if I had known that Carlo had been involved, all right? Or that Sarah would be in danger. Did you ever stop to think how all that made me feel?",
        "Cord: Once again, Tina, it's all about you.",
        "Tina: No, and I would have gladly traded those jewels for Sarah, b-b-but Cain stopped me.",
        "Cord: Oh, I know exactly where you're gonna go with this. Now you're gonna blame that S.O.B. boyfriend.",
        "Tina: Oh, he's not my boyfriend. W-well, okay, maybe he was. Briefly. All right? And we never would have gotten together if it hadn't been for my dog.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I've got an update on the A.P.B. for the escaped prisoner Todd Manning. He's now driving his daughter's car.",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr, from now on, you don't say anything else. Let me do the talking, all right?",
        "Bo: Okay. Let me know if there's anything else.",
        "Blair: Well, Bo, thank you so much for everything that you've done, and I hope you find Todd and especially Irene before she, you know, causes more damage.",
        "Bo: Yeah, my men are on that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, we've told you everything we know, so you don't have to stick around. I mean, we know how much you want to join the search for Todd.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, the department has that covered, T\u00e9a, but right now we have to deal with the matter of Starr helping her dad escape from jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Give me the gun.",
        "Irene: First, give me the ring.",
        "Todd: No, I don't think so.",
        "Irene: I said give it to me.",
        "Todd: No, 'cause if I give you the ring before you give me the gun, I kind of give up all of my leverage. Not to mention you could kill me.",
        "Irene: If I had wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.",
        "Todd: That's -- yeah, that's a valid point.",
        "Irene: Please, Todd. When you give me the ring, I will give you this gun. I promise.",
        "Todd: That's not the gun I took from Dorian's. That's not the gun that I gave to Louie.",
        "Irene: No, it isn't. You're right.",
        "Todd: So where's that gun?",
        "Irene: It's with your friend Louie... at the bottom of the river.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You know I want to be with you and Liam more than anything. But I would never want you to lose your family because of me.",
        "Natalie: You know, Brody, it doesn't -- it doesn't matter. It's not gonna change anything. You know, Jessica hates me. She hates seeing us together, and, honestly, I mean, during our fight, she said things that were kind of undeniable.",
        "Brody: Like what?",
        "Natalie: Like how we're never going to be a big, happy family ever again. And even if Mom doesn't come out and say that she has an issue with us getting married -- not that she knows yet, but when she does find out, she is going to have a problem with it.",
        "Brody: You think Jessica knows what your mom would think better than you?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. But look at Dad. I mean, he couldn't even give you his blessing for our marriage.",
        "Brody: I know. That's why I went to see him.",
        "Natalie: After the way he was with you on the phone? Aah! -- Are you nuts?",
        "Brody: Maybe. But I didn't want you to lose your family.",
        "Natalie: Well, did he give you the wrong end of his shotgun?",
        "Brody: [Laughs] No. He gave me his blessing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I don't believe this. I don't believe this. You girls came to blows? Honey, I think you need to see a doctor, okay?",
        "Jessica: Mom, it's just a black eye. Anyway, I am sorry that you had to find out about the engagement this way. I thought Dad was gonna tell you, but I guess he didn't have the chance.",
        "Clint: Actually, no, I didn't.",
        "Viki: Natalie left me several messages while I was at the reading of my brother's so-called will. Now I suppose I know why.",
        "Jessica: Well, all you need to know is that Natalie and Brody are engaged, and as for the rest of the family, we don't give a damn.",
        "Viki: Oh, sweetheart. I am so sorry that things turned out this way for you. You don't deserve it. Okay. Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Jessica: Yes. I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Viki: All right. I'm gonna leave your father to look after you, and I am going to go and talk to Natalie. I will not have her beating up on you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, Mom.",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Jessica: Um...it wasn't just Natalie. I played my part in it, too.",
        "Viki: I see. And what did you do?",
        "Jessica: I tried to strangle her.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God! Jessica!",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Things just got out of control.",
        "Viki: Okay. Okay. I'm going to go and talk to Natalie, and when I come back, I am going to find a way to heal this family. I will not have you and Natalie end up the way Tina and I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: You know, I really don't need to hear how your dog played matchmaker for you and Cain Rogan.",
        "Tina: Fine! I need to check on David Vickers.",
        "Cord: David Vickers? Seriously, Tina? Really? That's who you're involved with now? My cousin David Vickers -- wait a minute. I thought he was with Dorian.",
        "Tina: Not that David Vickers.",
        "Cord: What other David Vickers is there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What did you do? What have you done?",
        "Irene: I did what I had to do. Your friend Louie is down there, along with the gun that could clear you of your brother's murder.",
        "Todd: Why?",
        "Irene: Isn't it obvious? So you would take the fall for Victor's murder, and I could enjoy everything he owned without any interference from you. Or from anybody else, for that matter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Starr? Bo, come on. What are you talking about?",
        "Bo: She stole a guard's gun, held him and his partner at gunpoint, and then had her father handcuff both of them and gag them.",
        "Jack: You did all that to help Scarface? You're such a traitor.",
        "T\u00e9a: Bo, can any of this be proven?",
        "Bo: Yes, T\u00e9a. I have sworn statements from both guards, detailing everything that Starr did to help her dad escape. Now, your daughter committed a felony, Blair.",
        "Starr: You don't understand.",
        "T\u00e9a: Starr.",
        "Starr: What?! He needs to know this. I'm sorry, T\u00e9a. My dad had to do that. His mother wrote him a letter saying that she would kill all of us if he didn't give her some microchip. He broke out of jail to save us.",
        "Jack: From what, Starr? Old Grandma Manning was here the whole time we read Dad's will. She didn't lay a finger on us.",
        "Starr: That doesn't mean that she still won't.",
        "Jack: Yeah, right. Scarface just wanted you to bust him out of jail. He lied to you, and you followed his orders like a little puppy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David Vickers: [Barking]",
        "Irene: Give me the ring, Todd, and we can be finished with this once and for all.",
        "Todd: You sick, disgusting monster.",
        "Irene: Is that any way to talk to your mother?",
        "Todd: You are not my mother. You may have given birth to me, but no mother would ever give her child to the likes of Peter Manning. You had me locked up. You had me tortured. I -- I was shocked senseless. I was -- I was bled white for eight years.",
        "Irene: I really wish you would let this go.",
        "Todd: You kept me from my family -- from all the people that I love. You took my brother, and you just put him in my place.",
        "Irene: And no one was the wiser.",
        "Todd: And now you've killed Louie? Louie! [Chuckles] Who pulled me out of the water. He saved my life when your goons shot me. Louie was a complete stranger, and he tried to help me, and look at you -- you call yourself my mother. You gonna kill me?",
        "Irene: Please, Todd. It doesn't have to be this way.",
        "Todd: No, it doesn't. You want this so badly, this means so much to you, fine!",
        "Irene: No!",
        "Todd: Go get it!",
        "Irene: No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Dad, I'm okay. Really. I should be the one taking care of you.",
        "Clint: No. No. Come on. Let me do this for my little girl.",
        "Jessica: You already made me pancakes.",
        "Clint: Wait till you taste my frittata.",
        "Jessica: [Chuckles] Ow! Okay. Ow. Natalie packs a mean punch.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I know. When Buchanans hit each other, it hurts. Jessie, I have to tell you something, and you're not gonna like it.",
        "Jessica: What is it?",
        "Clint: After I refused Brody my blessing on the phone, he came over to ask for it in person.",
        "Jessica: You sent him packing, right?",
        "Clint: No. Actually, I gave him the nod, stupidly thinking that it would make things better between you and your sister. I'm sorry, honey.",
        "Jessica: No, it's okay. You did what you thought was right.",
        "Clint: Come on. Tell me what I can do to make it better. How can I help you, Jess?",
        "Jessica: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, I am beyond amazed. H-- how did you get Dad's blessing? How in the world did you swing that?",
        "Brody: Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Brody: I told Clint that giving us his blessing would be the only way for you and Jessica to start to make peace.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah, well, I guess when he takes one look at Jessica's face and what I did to it, he's probably gonna change his mind",
        "Brody: Yeah. I don't think we're gonna have that blessing for too much longer.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Brody: Natalie, just try to give it some time, okay? Your family's gonna come around.",
        "Viki: I hear congratulations are in order. As well as a lot of aspirin, huh?",
        "Natalie: Hi, Mom.",
        "Viki: Natalie, this is dreadful. I cannot believe that you and Jessica actually hit each other. She has a black eye. You're in a neck brace. How did this happen?",
        "Brody: It's my fault.",
        "Natalie: Brody, no.",
        "Brody: No, it's okay. I'm very sorry for all these problems that I've caused between Natalie and Jessica, but I want you to know I love Natalie. We love each other.",
        "Viki: I know. Same way that you and Jessica used to love each other. Do you have any idea how hard this is for her?",
        "Natalie: Mom, that's all we've been thinking about.",
        "Brody: We never meant to hurt Jessica. All we want is to have a family with our son. I know it's a difficult situation.",
        "Viki: Oh, yes, it is.",
        "Natalie: All right, Mom. Go ahead. Just say it. You think this is all my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: You know what? I don't want to know. Forget it. No point in hearing you lie to me again.",
        "Tina: I'm not lying! There is another David Vickers.",
        "Cord: Oh, okay. And you're dating him now. Is that the way it is?",
        "Tina: No! No, of course not. He's my dog. And I named him David Vickers 'cause it suited him until he -- she gave birth to a litter of puppies.",
        "Cord: Whatever.",
        "Tina: Well, fine. \"Whatever\" to you.",
        "Cord: [Sighs]",
        "Tina: David Vickers. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry I left you alone here all this time -- David Vickers? H-honey, where are you? Where -- oh, my God. Oh, my God!",
        "Cord: Tina, what is it? What's wrong?",
        "Tina: She's gone. David Vickers is gone.",

        "David Vickers: [Barking]",
        "Jack: You helped Scarface break out of jail and now you don't want to answer for it?",
        "Starr: Really? You're going to lecture me on accountability?",
        "Blair: Enough.",
        "Starr: What now?",
        "Jack: Scarface manipulated you into helping him escape. We weren't in any danger. Irene's just a mean, old lady. He was making it up.",
        "Starr: No, he wasn't.",
        "Bo: Starr, do you have any evidence that Irene threatened to kill your family? Where's the note?",
        "Jack: Oh, get this. Scarface told Starr the note was written in disappearing ink. She fell for that.",
        "Starr: He wasn't lying, Jack. I know it.",
        "Bo: What exactly did the note say?",
        "Starr: He said that Irene said she would murder us all one by one if he did not give her some microchip, and then once he gave that to her, she would give him the gun that he took from Aunt Dorian's.",
        "Bo: This is the gun that he tried to give Louie down at the docks?",
        "Starr: Yes. The one that you think he shot Uncle Victor with, but he swears he did not fire it.",
        "Jack: [Scoffs] Yeah, right. And I'm taking Emma Stone to homecoming. I can't listen to this anymore. I just can't.",
        "Bo: How'd Irene get the gun?",
        "Starr: Who knows? But she won't give it to him until he gives her that microchip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You son of a bitch!",
        "Todd: Well said.",
        "Irene: I needed that microchip.",
        "Todd: You should have thought of that before you decided to let me go down for Victor's murder.",
        "Irene: Every bit of leverage I had, every bargaining power I had was in that chip.",
        "Todd: And all of mine was with the gun -- the gun that I gave to my friend that you killed.",
        "Irene: All the information on that chip was all I had to offer.",
        "Todd: That and your sunny disposition.",
        "Irene: This is a disaster. Oh, my God. How can this be happening to me? [Growls]",
        "Todd: It's really awful when bad things happen to good people.",
        "Irene: You can say that again.",
        "Todd: It's awful when bad things happen to good --",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Where could she be? I-I -- she was kidnapped once before. She was. I mean, what if it's happening again?",
        "Cord: Tina, don't get all bent out of shape here. Maybe Viki or Clint let him out of the carrier. I don't know.",
        "Tina: Where?",
        "Clint: It's a big house, Tina. I tell you what -- I'll go look for him upstairs, and you can look for him down here, okay?",
        "Tina: Okay. Okay.",
        "Clint: [Sighs] Tina, relax. We're gonna find him.",
        "Tina: Her.",
        "Clint: Her.",

        "Viki: Natalie, I just want to make sure that you know what you're doing, okay? This is not about blame.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry. I have to go. Todd Manning's escaped jail. Look, I'll see you soon.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Brody: I hope we can all get past this.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Great. Uncle Todd has escaped from jail. Doesn't he know that this is making it harder on himself?",
        "Viki: I'm sure that there is more to the story.",
        "Natalie: There always is. And not just with Uncle Todd. I'm sure you took one look at Jessica's face and thought that my Atlantic City roots were coming back to haunt you.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey. No, I wasn't very happy when I saw her face, but now I see what she did to you. Are you okay?",
        "Natalie: I'm fine. Haven't you read the style magazines? I mean, these are all the rage.",
        "Viki: Natalie, stop it. Honey, I love you. I am worried about you.",
        "Natalie: Mom, I'm okay. Except for the fact that Jessica hates me, and I hate the fact that I'm tearing her up.",
        "Viki: Well, I don't particularly like the position I'm in, either, having to be between you two.",
        "Natalie: I know. I don't want you to be. I just -- I don't know what to do.",
        "Viki: I know, but something has to be done. There's just been too much divisiveness in the family lately. I do not want it to happen with my children.",
        "Natalie: I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, is this really what you want? To marry the man who was supposed to marry your sister?",
        "Natalie: I'm just trying to make a life with Brody, you know? Jessica ran out on him at the altar and then John ran out on me, and we just -- Brody and I picked up the pieces together with our son.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, it's not as simple as that.",
        "Natalie: But it kind of is that simple, you know? I just -- I'm trying to find a little bit of happiness. And...I've got it with Brody. You know? I mean, I moved out of my home to be with him. And now Dad's mad at me, and I've lost my sister. Am I gonna lose you, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: No, you're already helping by being my dad. You are my dad, and you always will be, right?",
        "Clint: Of course I will, sweetheart. Where's this coming from?",
        "Tina: Oh, Clint, have you seen --",
        "Jessica: Aunt Tina.",
        "Tina: Oh. Uh, hello... Jessica?",
        "Jessica: Yes. It's Jessica. What are you doing here?",
        "Clint: She's here to fill that bag with her dead brother's money.",
        "Tina: That's not true. This is the carrier for my dog. And David Vickers is missing.",
        "Jessica: Oh, we haven't seen him.",
        "Tina: Her. You know, I'm just scared that maybe she went down to the basement and got herself locked in that secret room --",
        "Jessica: The room's gone, Tina. We tore it down.",
        "Tina: Oh, that is a great idea, I mean, especially since you were gonna blow up your sister down there.",
        "Jessica: That was Tess. Neither of us have seen your dog.",
        "Tina: [Sighs] Then where could she be? Look, I've got to find her. David Vickers! David Vickers!",

        "Jack: I can't believe you're repping that jerk.",
        "T\u00e9a: Jack, stay out of this.",
        "Bo: And, Starr, you didn't do your dad any favors when you broke him out of jail.",
        "Blair: Okay, clearly Todd manipulated her. You can't blame her for that.",
        "Bo: Yes, I can, Blair. She's not a child anymore. She took a weapon from a guard. Someone could have gotten hurt or killed, including her.",
        "Blair: Well, what are you gonna do, then?",
        "Bo: Starr Manning, you're under arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: [Groaning] So much for my tennis career.",
        "Irene: I'm a little rusty with a gun. I usually get people to do this sort of thing for me.",

        "Irene: You realize that that microchip was the only thing keeping you alive.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I kind of figured that.",

        "Blair: All right, sweetheart, I'll go down there with you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I will, too. Don't worry, Estrella. I'll get you out of there in no time, all right?",

        "Todd: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait. Please, please, wait. Before you shoot, you have to ask yourself one question.",
        "Irene: Do I feel lucky?",
        "Todd: No. Look. Would Todd Manning really throw the last bargaining chip that he had into the river?",
        "Irene: Yes, he would.",
        "Todd: Are you sure?",
        "Irene: Yes, because Todd Manning is a rash, selfish imbecile who never thinks before he acts. Are these trick questions?",
        "Todd: I'm just saying. Maybe -- maybe -- maybe I'm lying, right? Maybe the microchip isn't in the ring after all.",
        "Irene: Yeah, and if I kill you, I'll never know?",
