        "Nora: Welcome back.",
        "Bo: Thank you.",
        "Nora: How was Texas?",
        "Bo: It was great. Uh -- what's going on with Lindsay?",
        "Nora: Didn\u0091t get my message?",
        "Bo: No, no, my phone went dead, so I just went to the airport, landed, took -- dropped Matthew off at school and --",
        "Nora: Ok.",
        "Bo: She was supposed to be arraigned.",
        "Nora: Can we talk in your office?",
        "Bo: Sure.",
        "Nora: Ok.",
        "Bo: So, what happened with Lindsay?",
        "Nora: Uh --",
        "Bo: You said that you were not going to oppose bail.",
        "Nora: Didn't even get that far.",
        "Bo: Well, what happened?",
        "Nora: She pled guilty.",
        "Bo: Are you kidding me? Well, when -- when's the sentencing?",
        "Nora: I don't know.",
        "Bo: What, the judge didn't set a date?",
        "Nora: Bo, uh -- you know -- I don't -- I don't even know how to say this, but, um -- Lindsay doesn't seem to be Lindsay anymore.",

        "Man: Are you Ms. Rappaport's son?",
        "Will: Yeah. Hi. Hey, nobody would give me any information. When I said I wanted to see her, they said I had to talk to you.",
        "Man: Well, you can see your mother.",
        "Will: Oh, thank you.",
        "Man: But be prepared for the change in her.",

        "Marcie: I love this necklace, Mike.",
        "Michael: I'm glad.",
        "Marcie: You know, you didn't have to get me a present. The party was enough.",
        "Michael: Of course I did, sweetie. There you go, you're all set.",
        "Marcie: Well, maybe it'll bring us good luck because we're sure going to need it.",
        "Michael: Honey?",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Michael: We're going to be ok. The judge is going to let us keep Tommy. After what he found out, there is no way in hell that Todd can win this case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teacher: We'll be starting a unit on botany tomorrow. I can see you rolling your eyes, but botany can be fascinating.",
        "Starr: Oh, right.",
        "Cole: You ok?",
        "Teacher: For tomorrow, I want you to read chapter five.",
        "Starr: My parents are going in the court today.",
        "Cole: As a married couple?",
        "Starr: Yeah, it should help them get Tommy back.",
        "Teacher: Be prepared to discuss the difference between monocotyledons and dicotyledons.",
        "Cole: I don't want to bum you out or anything, but I know what your parents are doing is an act. And what if the judge does, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Good morning.",
        "Todd: Morning. Ahem.",
        "Blair: Did you sleep all right last night?",
        "Todd: I think it was my least favorite of all our wedding nights.",
        "Blair: You should be used to it.",
        "Todd: Dorian's guest room?",
        "Blair: No, I'm talking sleeping alone.",
        "Todd: You know, I just hate it here, you know? It's just so girly.",
        "Blair: And what does that mean?",
        "Todd: It means that there are, you know, paper doilies on the extra roll of toilet paper and a featherbed on the bed and -- besides that, the crickets keep you up all night and the birds wake you up at the crack of dawn. I just can't wait to get custody of this kid so I can go back home to the penthouse.",
        "Blair: Excuse me? No one said anything about moving back to the penthouse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teacher: There will be a quiz on Friday, so do the reading carefully.",
        "Langston: Oh.",
        "Starr: Cole, what do you mean it's an act?",
        "Teacher: Botany may seem dry at first, but I'm sure you'll find the discussion of pistils and stamens more relevant.",
        "Cole: Come on, Starr.",
        "Teacher: Mr. Thornhart, ms. Manning? Please wait until the period is over, unless you'd like to share this discussion with the rest of the class.",
        "Cole: Yeah, we were just debating Mendel's theory, actually, Mr. Vasquez, yeah.",
        "Mr. Vasquez: Nice try.",
        "[Bell]",
        "Mr. Vasquez: Saved by the bell.",
        "Markko: Hey, were you two having a fight or something?",
        "Langston: Right in front of Vasquez? Because her parents have to go back to court today.",
        "Langston: Oh, man -- not much of a honeymoon, huh?",
        "Markko: What? What honeymoon?",
        "Starr: My parents got remarried.",
        "Markko: Well, you never said anything about that.",
        "Cole: That's because she didn't know about it until right before it happened.",
        "Markko: You're kidding me.",
        "Starr: Look, my parents love each other. Why should they wait?",
        "Langston: I know this is what you wanted, Starr. I think it's great.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Markko: Oh, so now if they get custody of Mrs. McBain's kid, he'll have a mom and a dad.",
        "Cole: Well, that's kind of the idea -- right, Starr?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Great -- Judy's late.",
        "Michael: By two minutes, sweetie.",
        "Marcie: Oh. Did she say why she wanted to see us?",
        "Michael: Yeah. She said she wanted to prepare us for what was going to happen today.",
        "Marcie: We already know what's going to happen today, Michael. Blair's going to testify!",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Michael: It's not going to make a difference.",
        "Marcie: Oh, come on! She's going to swear up and down that he is a great father.",
        "Michael: Really? If he's such a great father, how come she's divorced him twice and taken her kids someplace else?",
        "Marcie: I guess.",
        "Michael: Honey, we're going to get a chance to testify after she does, ok? Think about it -- happy, well-adjusted adoptive parents versus divorced, rapist biological father who tried to kill his son's mother three times while Tommy was in utero. If you were the judge, what would you do?",
        "Marcie: Right. Right, you're right. You're right. Was Tommy ok when you brought him over to John's? Was everything ok?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Michael: Yeah, he was fine. John's going to take him to the park. They're going to go feed the ducks.",
        "Marcie: No! No, I don't want him to go outside! I don't know that I got that --",
        "Michael: Honey!",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Michael: Right now --",
        "Marcie: Yeah?",
        "Michael: Everything is fine.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: I'm going to get the door.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Judy: Sorry I'm late -- I got tied up on the phone. Hello, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Hi, Judy. Can I get you something? Coffee, orange juice, anything?",
        "Judy: I'll take some orange juice, thanks.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Judy: Where's Tommy?",
        "Michael: He's with my brother.",
        "Judy: This brother -- is he reliable?",
        "Michael: Yeah, he's a cop.",
        "Judy: Great. We don't want to take any chances today.",
        "Michael: Yeah, about that -- um, what's so important about today?",
        "Judy: I was told to be ready to deliver my summation. There's a possibility that the judge may rule from the bench after you two and Blair finish testifying.",
        "Marcie: Are you worried about that?",
        "Judy: I think Blair will me a good witness.",
        "Michael: Oh. Look, she's not as bad as Todd, but let's face it -- the woman's no Mother Teresa.",
        "Judy: As I've told you before, we are fighting an uphill battle.",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Judy: Courts tend to want to reunite families.",
        "Michael: Huh. What Todd Manning can offer isn't family.",
        "Judy: I agree -- that's why I hit his background so hard.",
        "Marcie: Are you saying that Todd could have custody of Tommy by tonight?",
        "Judy: I think we've done a lot of damage to Todd's fitness as a parent, but Blair could repair some of that on the stand. I wouldn't feel right if I allowed you to go to court today thinking this was a done deal.",
        "Marcie: Oh, God.",
        "Judy: Now, don't panic. I really believe we've made a compelling case for custody.",
        "Marcie: Yeah -- what if you're wrong? What if you're wrong, Judy? If I lose -- if we lose Tommy, I -- I'm just not sure I'm going to be able to handle it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, I'm not going to spend another night here, that's for sure.",
        "Blair: Fine. Go.",
        "Todd: Well, when I go, you and the kids are coming with me.",
        "Blair: Hmm. The last time I looked, we were not your property.",
        "Todd: I paid you $5 million. Right? Essentially makes you my employee.",
        "Blair: No. You paid me to marry you, which I did, and you need me to testify for you today, which I'm going to do. But there's nowhere that says where we have to live.",
        "Todd: No. It stipulates in our contract this marriage has to look real, which means we live under the same roof.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm not uprooting my kids. They've been through too much.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry -- \"your\" kids?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: They're \"our\" kids. We are their parents, and you and I are married now.",
        "Blair: Ok. What happens when you win your case and you no longer need us?",
        "Todd: When would I ever not want to be with my kids?",
        "Blair: Oh, you can be with them, Todd. You just have to move in here. We have to play the very first day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Addie sighs]",
        "Addie: The thing about a change of scenery is it's so refreshing. You look at the same four walls and you start thinking the same thoughts over and over and over again. \"Circular thinking,\" the sisters call it. It's good to get out of your four walls once in a while.",
        "Will: Right.",
        "Addie: Is this seat taken?",
        "Will: Oh, no.",
        "Addie: Excuse me, but do I know you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Well, when you're done with all that paperwork, why don't you stop into Capricorn for a drink?",
        "Talia: Oh, I mean, yeah. I guess I could do that.",
        "Antonio: And bring George.",
        "Talia: Um -- all right. Well, I'll give him a call and see if he has the time.",
        "Antonio: Well, tell him I said to make time.",
        "Talia: Mm-hmm. Whew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Lindsay described everything that happened and then she just broke down?",
        "Nora: It -- she said something about feeling free and, I mean, it was like keeping the secret was killing her. I -- I made a copy of the transcript of her arraignment for you.",
        "Bo: Thank you. You know, I talked to her before I left, and she seemed ok to me. She didn't want to talk about her case at all without her lawyer present, but that's taking care of business.",
        "Nora: She knew that Marcie and Michael McBain's child was actually Todd's biological son.",
        "Bo: She did.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Bo: How?",
        "Nora: Apparently, she overheard someone talking, but she also knew that Spencer Truman knew this, too.",
        "Bo: So she must've killed Truman to keep him quiet to protect Marcie.",
        "Nora: Seems so.",
        "Bo: Oh. I shouldn't have left town.",
        "Nora: Bo, there's nothing you could've done.",
        "Bo: Well, I could've been here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Listen, honey, what we need to do right now is stay calm.",
        "Marcie: Judy just said that Blair could undo our entire case!",
        "Judy: I didn't say that.",
        "Marcie: After you took Tommy over to John's, honey, I was looking at his crib -- in his empty crib and I started thinking about what it would be like if we lost him for good, you know, and I don't know that I could handle it.",
        "Judy: First of all, even if the judge rules against us, we can appeal.",
        "Marcie: I don't want to appeal, Judy! I have to appeal, then that means that Tommy will be with Todd all that time!",
        "Michael: Marcie. Judy, Marcie's been suspended from her job at school per the fact Starr Manning is one of her students.",
        "Judy: What?",
        "Michael: Yeah. This case is really starting to affect our lives.",
        "Judy: I'm going to make a phone call to the school district.",
        "Marcie: No, no, no -- I don't want to work! I just want to be with my son, Judy -- that's all I want.",
        "Judy: And you will be.",
        "Marcie: But you just said that Blair could --",
        "Judy: I said Blair will make a good witness for Todd, but we have weapons we haven't used yet.",
        "Marcie: Todd tried to buy Tommy back from us.",
        "Judy: What?",
        "Michael: Todd came here and he offered us money to give him his son.",
        "Marcie: We still have the check.",
        "Judy: Why wasn't I told about this?",
        "Michael: Marcie played along, you know, so that she would seem interested. I -- I just want to make sure that this isn't something that's going to come back and hurt us.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but shouldn't the judge know that this is what Tommy is to Todd -- something that he can buy?",
        "Judy: Let's keep the check in our hip pocket for now. What it tells me is that Todd is probably more scared than you are right now.",
        "Michael: See?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm not going to live in a house with a French name. What is a \"Boulaie\" anyway?",
        "Blair: I don't know, Todd. I like it here, and so do the kids.",
        "Todd: Did you tell Aunt Dorian that you asked me to move in? Oh. She's going to -- she's going to blow a phony French gasket.",
        "Blair: Ok, you know what? Why don't you just cut it out? I'm starting to regret ever remarrying you.",
        "Todd: Well, you did, sweetheart, in front of the law and everyone. And by the way, when we get to court today, you know what to say, right?",
        "Blair: Yes -- \"I married Todd Manning because\" --",
        "Todd: Because you love him and you love his new baby boy as if he were your own. Can you handle that?",
        "Blair: What do you want me to do, Todd? Do you want me to, like, imprint it on my palm so I --",
        "Todd: You do whatever you have to do. You get it right.",
        "Blair: Oh, I'll get it right and I think it'll work because didn't it work for Tea when you hired her to take Starr away from me?",
        "Todd: That would be good.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: That would be good -- why don't you say that in court? Is that what you think I'm doing? Do you think I'm stealing this kid from the McBains?",
        "Blair: No, Todd, I don't think that's what you're doing. Don't you think I know what you've been through to try to get Tommy? If I believed that, I wouldn't be going through this.",
        "Todd: All right. I'm sorry. Thank you for doing this. I mean it -- even if it's just for the five million.",
        "Blair: Well, you're welcome. Money was -- it's good, but -- look, Tommy belongs with you, and we're going to get him back today, ok, so come on. Let's go. This place is a mess.",
        "Blair: What's that?",
        "Todd: Hmm. \"We love you, dad. Good luck in court. Don't come home without our brother.\"",

        "Talia: Out celebrating, huh?",

        "Talia: How about -- how about you just sit here and keep quiet?",
        "Man: Oh, excuse me. You know, after about the third martini, it seemed like a fine idea to write the head of the firm a letter and tell him what a jerk he is.",
        "Talia: Good move.",
        "Man: Yeah. Lucky for me I had a stamp.",
        "Talia: You mailed this letter?",
        "Man: Ah. I felt so good I had a couple more martinis. And it occurred to me that what I'd done was a -- was a truly stupid thing. That's when I got the crowbar out of the trunk of my car and I went back to the mailbox --",
        "Talia: Ok, look -- sir?",

        "Starr: He's not Mrs. McBain's kid, Cole.",
        "Cole: Ok, no offense, but you can't expect me to believe anything your dad does is legit. I mean, come on -- marriage? Who does he think he's fooling?",
        "Starr: My parents are still in love with each other!",
        "Cole: That marriage was a load of crock, and we both know it. And what sucks the most is that you're trying to con me just like they're conning you.",
        "Starr: They didn't lie to me, Cole.",
        "Cole: What do you mean by that?",
        "Starr: You were right, ok? My dad married my mom to get Tommy back -- are you happy now?",

She stood right here in this office and said that she had a different point of view about life since she buried Jen. Now, I should've had sense enough to figure out what she was trying to tell me. I should've seen this breakdown coming on!",

        "Todd: I'll be fine.",
        "Morgan: All right. I'm going to check with the bailiff, see if the judge is delayed.",
        "Blair: Don't you think you should've told him about this?",

        "George: Ah.",
        "Talia: Were you with your girlfriend?",

        "George: Well, do you -- do you have a boyfriend?",
        "Talia: Um -- we're talking about you.",
        "George: Maybe fate has brought us together. Did you ever think of that -- what is -- Sahid? Pretty name.",

        "George: Hi.",
        "Antonio: Everything all right here?",
        "George: Are you kidding? Everything's great. I mean, it's not even noon, and I -- I already made partner. I got totally hammered, got arrested, and then the prettiest cop I've ever seen asked me to be her boyfriend.",

        "Bo: Yeah, Lindsay's faked a breakdown before, but she had a real one when Sam died.",
        "Nora: Well, I understand that. She was responsible for his death.",
        "Bo: Well, if she's responsible for Truman's death, maybe she's having the same reactions now.",
        "Nora: Or maybe she's just trying to avoid prosecution. Listen, the judge has ordered a psych evaluation at St. Ann's.",
        "Bo: All right, I've got to get over there.",

        "Man: Well, when she was first admitted, she was making eye contact, responding to voices, loud noises, physical stimuli. But then she became completely unresponsive.",
        "Will: I just -- I don't get this. She's -- she's sitting up and her eyes are open, but it's like she's in a coma.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judy: This is outrageous, your honor. It's an obvious stunt to make Mr. Manning appear to be a more suitable parent.",
        "Judge: Let me handle this, counselor. So, this potential co-plaintiff, she's your ex-wife?",
        "Todd: Well, no, no, not anymore. We were married just recently. But she's also the mother of my two children. That's one of Blair's best qualities, actually. She's a great mother, and I think she'd be a -- a terrific mother for -- for my son --",
        "Marcie: His name is Tommy, and he is not your son!",
        "Judge: Quiet. Mr. Manning, how long had you and your wife been engaged?",
        "Todd: Actually, we were going to get married a couple years ago, and then this psychopath named Margaret Cochran shot me and kidnapped me before the ceremony could take place. And it's just taken us this long to get our lives back in order.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, right! With little side trips along the way, like Blair shacking up with Spencer Truman!",

        "Marcie: I have the check in my purse, your honor. We told him what he could do with his money. And then the next day, he married Blair.",
        "Judy: We request that this check be entered into evidence and subjected to handwriting and fingerprint analysis. It will prove that Todd Manning is trying every trick in the book because even he knows he's not the best parent for Tommy.",
        "Judge: Please give the check to the bailiff.",
        "Judge: I am truly shocked, Mr. Manning. I thought you were a lot of things, but stupid wasn't one of them. All day long,",

        "Langston: Well, no, their plans changed.",
        "Markko: So you're still alone at your house?",

        "Markko: Well, who's going to cook dinner?",
        "Langston: Are you kidding me? Any guy would leap at the chance and you're worried about dinner?",

        "Starr: Why are you being so mean?",
        "Cole: Because your parents are screwing you over. And all I'm doing lately is holding your hand.",

        "Cole: That's not what I mean.",
        "Starr: What, are you jealous because my parents worked it out?",
        "Cole: Worked it out? Your parents haven't worked anything out. All they're doing is screwing up your life.",
        "Starr: My parents still love each other. And, yeah, they might not be too good at the whole marriage thing, but maybe this time it'll be different.",

        "Bo: Well, she and I knew each other very well. Would it be ok if I talked to her?",
        "Doctor: Absolutely, yes. You can try. Maybe your voice is the one that'll break through. I'm going to make rounds, but I'll be in my office later on if you want to talk further.",

        "Judge: Why did you do something like that?",
        "Todd: They're misunderstanding my motives. You see, I was having nightmares for a long time. I was having nightmares about my son, my little boy. And wondering what had happened to him after Spencer Truman kidnapped him. And then when I found out he was just fine, I simply wanted to express my gratitude to Marcie and Michael --",

        "Judge: And the marriage to your former wife the next day? What motivated that?",
        "Todd: Well, the oldest motivation in the world. Love.",
        "Judge: You do see that it appears to be rather conveniently timed?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I do. I do, and I -- and I can't say that I wasn't thinking about my son when I asked Blair to marry me. But the truth is, I just want to provide my son with a very warm and stable environment. And it's best to do that, I think, with a woman that -- well, the woman that I've never stopped loving. And I just don't see what's wrong with that.",

        "Judge: Your witness, counselor.",
        "Judy: Thank you, your honor. You say that Todd Manning is a good father?",
        "Blair: That's right.",
        "Judy: So your definition of a good father is the man who told you that your son, Jack, was dead, and then gave him away to strangers in a Mexican airport? Is that right, Mrs. Manning?",
