        "Rex's ghost sees himself on the operating table. Then he is suddenly thrust into a game show called Who's Shane Morasco's Father. Everyone gathers at the hospital waiting to see how Rex is. Gigi tells Shane the truth. Shane thinks she's lying and keeps talking about Brody. He argues about the DNA test and Gigi explains how Brody used Rex's toothbrush. Charlie and Jared talk about Jessica. Jared says something isn't right there. Tess taunts Natalie saying she can go see Rex and then saying she can't. They argue. On the game show, Rex has to answer questions about his life and who his real father is. When he answers correctly at the game show, he gets better in the operating room. When he answers wrong his health fails. He faces Jen and Lindsay. They finally ask Rex who his father is and give eight photos; Bo, Charlie, RJ, David Vickers Mitch Laurence Snoop dog, Kane Rogan and Jackie McDonald. Rex calls his lifeline, Roxy. At the hospital Roxy does a prayer circle. Everyone joins in. On the lifeline, Roxy says not David Vickers then the line goes dead. Time is up. Rex guesses Bo but is wrong. They say Brody won Shane and Rex flat lines."

        "Bo: Nurse, how is Rex Balsom?",
        "Nurse: Sir, I don't have time.",
        "Bo: Make time. Look, that young man is like a son to me.",
        "Nurse: He's lost a lot of blood. The bullet did a lot of damage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Gigi: I know it isn't fair to dump this on you now, honey, but Brody's not your dad. He's not. Your honest to God biological father is Rex.",
        "Shane: You're lying.",
        "Gigi: I'm not. I -- I was, but I'm not now.",
        "Shane: Dad warned me about this. He said that you'd try to make me believe that Rex is my father.",
        "Gigi: Shane, I'm not trying to change the way you feel about Brody. You love him, I get that, but I need you to know the truth. I need you to know, okay? I -- I want you to have the chance to know Rex because he's your dad. Rex is your dad, honey. I was there and I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: O-neg on deck.",
        "Rex: Hey, I'm A-negative. Hello? Somebody -- hey, hey, Michael, dude, it's me, Rex.",
        "Michael: He's got about 500 cc of blood in his belly. I need suction, please.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: We might need a deeper retractor. Right angle clamp, please. Okay, right there, there it is. I got it. Tie -- tie that off.",
        "Rex: They can't hear me. I'm here, I'm yelling, but all they see is me here on my operating table. What the hell am I doing on an operating table?",
        "Gigi's voice: Listen to me, Balsom. We didn't find each other after all this time for me to lose you now. We have a lot to do, a life to plan, a son to raise.",
        "Rex: Oh, man, I'm in trouble.",
        "Announcer: So, you think you can be Shane Morasco's father?",
        "[Applause] Announcer: Now, give it up for our host, Colin MacIver.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Colin: So, Rex Balsom, you think you can be Shane Morasco's father?",
        "[Applause]",
        "Colin: Cat got your tongue?",
        "Rex: What the hell's going on here?",
        "Colin: I thought you wanted to be Shane Morasco's father.",
        "Rex: Uh, I am his father.",
        "Colin: And that's what we're here to find out, right, audience?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Rex: You're dead. Colin MacIver's dead.",
        "Colin: What's that say about you, Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Please, you've got to let me out of here.",
        "Tess: Okay.",
        "Natalie: Really? You changed your mind? You're going to let me go see Rex at the hospital?",
        "Tess: Sure, why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Jared, did you talk to Natalie? She know what's going on?",
        "Jared: Yeah, I left her a couple of messages. How's Rex?",
        "Roxy: Do you know where Rex Balsom is? No one knows anything! Oh, my God, you called me. Where's Rex?",
        "Bo: He's still in the O.R.",
        "Roxy: This whole time?",
        "Bo: Yeah, he was shot in the gut.",
        "Roxy: Who did this? Who did -- who shot him?",
        "Bo: It was Brody Lovett. This is serious, Roxy.",
        "Roxy: Okay, all right, I'm okay. What happened?",
        "Bo: I don't think Brody knew that it was Rex that he was shooting at. Now, he's done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think it might be post traumatic stress.",
        "Roxy: Is that like shell shock?",
        "Bo: Yes, exactly. Brody had a gun and he didn't know he was shooting at Rex. Rex was trying to protect Gigi and Shane, so he jumped in front of the bullet",
        "Roxy: Oh.",
        "Bo: Roxy, listen to me. Your son is a hero.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You're dead. Nora killed you.",
        "Colin: Do you want to play, Rex, or do you want to waste what little time you have left? Come on, you're holding us up here.",
        "Audience: Ooh.",
        "Rex: Okay, I don't understand.",
        "Colin: It's simple. Do you want to be Shane Morasco's father?",
        "Rex: Yes, of course.",
        "Colin: Then all you have to do is beat our defending champ. He's a Navy Seal. He enjoys camping, barbequing, and he can fix a carburetor in seconds flat. Ladies and gentlemen, help me welcome Brody Lovett.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Audience: Brody, Brody, Brody, Brody, Brody, Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Brody is my dad. I don't care --",
        "[Shane coughs]",
        "Shane: What you say.",
        "Gigi: Here, here's your inhaler.",
        "Shane: Dad told me that you would wreck this whole family just so you could be with Rex.",
        "[Shane coughs]",
        "Gigi: Please, use this, Shane.",
        "Shane: I don't care what you say, Brody is my dad.",
        "Gigi: Okay, wow, uh, I don't blame you for being mad at me. I lied to you, and I -- and I've been lying to you ever since you came home from preschool and asked where your daddy was.",
        "Shane: I don't want to hear this.",
        "Gigi: Well, you're going to have to, I'm sorry. I went to high school with Rex. He was my boyfriend. You know that. And, well, I got pregnant. Only by then, he had left town and I didn't know where he was. And then I met Brody. I told him that I was pregnant by someone else, but it didn't matter to him. He said he loved me and that when he got home on leave, we would -- we would get married and he would take care of us, but then his mom lied to me. She told me that he died.",
        "Shane: If she hadn't done that, would you have married Dad, I mean, Brody?",
        "Gigi: Probably. But he isn't your biological dad, Rex is.",
        "Shane: So, Rex ran out and then Brody stepped up?",
        "Gigi: Kind of.",
        "Shane: Even if I did believe that, which I don't, why would I want a jerk like Rex for a dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Audience: Brody, Brody, Brody, Brody, Brody!",
        "[Cheering and applause]",
        "Rex: Look, he shot me. He kidnapped Shane. Do you hear me?",
        "Colin: Ladies and gentlemen, let's see what these two men are fighting for. What will our winner take home?",
        "Rex: Shane?",
        "Colin: Is yours for the rest of your life if you're our winner.",
        "Rex: And if I lose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Gangemi: Suture. We're down to two units of whole blood. Moist sponge. I need longer forceps. Mike, clamp the bleeder.",
        "Nurse: B.P. is dropping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: When Rex left town, he didn't know I was pregnant. I didn't even know.",
        "Shane: So why did he leave? I'd never do that to somebody, have sex with her and then just take off.",
        "Gigi: Oh, good to know. Uh, but, Shane, I'm not saying that it was the right thing to do; I'm just explaining how it happened. Rex later told me that he left for some sort of family thing. You know, I just -- I didn't know where he was and I couldn't reach him.",
        "Shane: You couldn't call him?",
        "Gigi: We didn't have cell phones back then, or email or anything like that.",
        "Shane: What about his parents, his friends? Somebody had to know where he was. This is all a lie. You've been telling me that Brody Lovett was my father ever since I was little. Why would you do that if it wasn't true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: We'll get the game under way right after this short break.",
        "Rex: But what if I -- what if I lose? What happens to Shane?",
        "Colin: We'll be right back with our first challenge. Don't you dare go away.",
        "Rex: But what if I lose?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Colin: Welcome back to \"So you think you can be Shane Morasco's father.\" All right, Rex, you know how the game is played. If you answer the question correctly, our thermographic scoreboard --",
        "[Ascending tone]",
        "Colin: Will put you one step closer to being Shane's daddy. But if you're wrong --",
        "[Descending tone]",
        "Rex: Look, I don't have to answer questions or play a game. I'm Shane's father. Look, I'm your biological father, Shane. It's a fact.",
        "Colin: Rex thinks biology is all that matters. What do you think, Brody?",
        "Brody: Takes a lot more than that, Colin.",
        "[Audience cheers]",
        "Rex: Look, I'll do whatever it takes.",
        "Audience: Prove it.",
        "Colin: You ready for your first challenge, Rex? Good, then let's play \"So you think you can be Shane Morasco's father.\"",
        "[Applause]",
        "Colin: In Shane Morasco's comic book, the villainess is named \u0096 A, Loopy Lindsey. B, Marcie the Meddler. C, Jellyfish Jen ---",
        "Rex: Hey, Jen was no jellyfish.",
        "Colin: Or D, Evelyn Evil.",
        "Rex: He named her Evelyn Evil.",
        "Colin: Louder, please.",
        "Rex: D, Evelyn Evil.",
        "[Ascending tone]",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Okay, B.P.'s coming back up. Looks like we got the bleeding pretty much under control in this area.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: All right, now we can do what we came here for.",
        "Michael: You're going after that bullet, Jay?",
        "Dr. Gangemi: We got to do it while he's stable.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Thank God it didn't cause anymore significant damage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Locker slams]",
        "Gigi: I couldn't tell you that your dad didn't even know you were alive, so I thought it would be kinder to give you Brody.",
        "[Locker slams]",
        "Gigi: He wanted to be your dad, and I believed he was dead, which meant he couldn't come back and tell you different.",
        "[Locker slams]",
        "Gigi: Shane, stop! It was going to be hard enough for you to grow up without a dad, so I figured I would give you a war hero to talk about to the other kids.",
        "Shane: He came looking for us as soon as he found out his mom lied.",
        "Gigi: He came back here because Adriana brought him here. She figured that it would keep Rex and me apart. And for a long time, she was right. Because I didn't want you -- see, I didn't want you looking at me like you are now.",
        "Shane: Like you're a liar.",
        "Gigi: I'm not lying, Shane.",
        "Shane: Mom, how stupid do you think I am? We took a DNA test. DNA tests don't lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Next question, bring it on.",
        "Colin: Challenge number two \u0096 When you married Adriana, where you --- A. In love with Adriana. B, In love with Gigi. C. In love with anything in a skirt.",
        "[Audience groans]",
        "Colin: Or D, in love with yourself and therefore, incapable of being a father.",
        "Rex: It isn't D -- or C.",
        "Colin: That leaves \"A,\" in love with Adriana or B, in love with Gigi. Rex, who did you love when you said those immortal words, \"'Til death do us part\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Adriana, honey, it's me again. Call me. It's important.",
        "Marcie: Does, uh -- is there any news about Rex?",
        "Layla: I don't know. I just got here.",
        "Marcie: Does Adriana know?",
        "Layla: I left her a couple of messages just to call me. It's not the kind of thing you leave on a voice mail, you know?",
        "Marcie: No, no, of course not. I just -- I can't -- I can't believe this. Not Rex, you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You sure you're okay?",
        "Roxy: Oh, yeah, Bo, I'm okay. I'm good. I am so awful.",
        "Bo: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I'm pretty sure Rex wouldn't even want me to be any part of this, but Roxy was in such bad shape when she heard, I figured I'd better drive her. Does Natalie know?",
        "Jared: Beats me. I was hoping she'd be here with everybody else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Come on, Tess, you've got to let me out of here. You just said I could go to the hospital to see Rex.",
        "Tess: Kidding.",
        "[Tess giggles]",
        "Natalie: Bitch.",
        "Tess: Oh, come on. You didn't really think I was going to let you out, did you?",
        "Natalie: You've got to stop this. This has got to stop.",
        "Tess: I don't -- I don't see why.",
        "Natalie: Okay, if you let me go see Rex, I'll give up Jared. I mean, that's what you want, right? You -- you want us to break up. So, please, just let me go to the hospital to see Rex, and you have my word. I'll never see Jared again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Natalie's still M.I.A. Go figure.",
        "Jared: I wouldn't worry. She'll be here.",
        "Charlie: So you haven't really given up on Natalie.",
        "Jared: You told me not to. You were right. I love her.",
        "Charlie: Any idea why she left, where she might have gone?",
        "Jared: Well, I'm hoping she's in Africa with Viki, but I've left her messages and I keep missing her. I don't know, maybe she doesn't want to call me back.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but wouldn't Jessica have said something if Natalie was with Viki?",
        "[Jared scoffs]",
        "Jared: You'd think so, but I -- I don't know what Jessica would do or wouldn't do.",
        "Charlie: Why? What do you mean?",
        "Jared: I don't know. I can't -- I can't put my finger on it, but something is not right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Tess, please. Please, I just -- I want to see him again one more time, please.",
        "Tess: You know, I've been there. When Nash was dying, I begged Jessica to let me out, but, uh, she didn't, you know. She didn't care about what I wanted and, uh, I don't care about you. Oh, wait, that's not true. That's not true. I want you to suffer. I want you to sit here helpless while Rex bleeds to death, then maybe you will understand just a little bit what it feels like to lose someone you love.",
        "Michael: He's bleeding out. There's something that we're not seeing.",
        "Anesthesiologist: Vital signs falling.",
        "Michael: Suction there. Let's go, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: Rex, I need your answer.",
        "Rex: Okay, what does any of this have to do with being Shane's father?",
        "Colin: Tell him, audience.",
        "[Audience shouts]",
        "Colin: You let Gigi Morasco stand up in church and declare her undying love for you, then you went ahead and married Adriana Cramer. What kind of man does that?",
        "[Audience shouts]",
        "Colin: What kind of father doesn't know the name of the woman he loves?",
        "Rex: I was in love with Adriana, but then Gigi came back into my life.",
        "[Buzzer sounds]",
        "Colin: Ouch. I'm afraid you've run out of time, Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: There it is. You see it? A tear in the liver.",
        "Dr. Gangemi: All right, I think we can get the vessels around it to stop the bleeding. Right angle clamp, please. All right, we gotta do this fast if we're going to control this bleeding. All right, ligature, please.",
        "Michael: Come on, Rex. Don't give up on me now. Come on, you've got too much to live for, man. Stick around, buddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I was honest with Adriana. She knew how I felt about Gigi.",
        "Colin: Asked and answered, Rex. Next question. When you found out that the baby boy adopted by Michael and Marcie McBain was really Todd Manning's son did you \u0096 A, return him to Todd? B, alert the authorities? C, put more gel in your hair? Or, D, play God with a child's life by keeping him from his father?",
        "Rex: I did what I thought was right.",
        "[Audience jeers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: DNA tests don't lie, but people do.",
        "Shane: Are you trying to say that the hospital lied to us?",
        "Gigi: Brody faked the test.",
        "Shane: Yeah, right. I was there.",
        "Gigi: Did you see them swab his cheek.",
        "Shane: He brought his toothbrush.",
        "Gigi: He brought Rex's toothbrush. If the DNA test was real, why was Brody so scared that Rex would take you away? He knew it was fake.",
        "Shane: That's crazy. He would never lie to me.",
        "Gigi: Brody is in a lot of trouble.",
        "Shane: He's in jail and he needs us and he's all alone. He's so messed up, Mom. He needs to know that we love him and that we're on his side.",
        "Gigi: Rex is in really bad shape, okay? He could die. The most important thing right now is for you to understand that Rex is your father.",
        "Shane: You hate Dad because he accidentally shot Rex.",
        "Gigi: No, I --",
        "Shane: I'm never going to stop loving him, and he's never going to stop loving me. I don't care what you say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Audience groans]",
        "[Descending tone]",
        "Colin: Ouch, ouch, ouch.",
        "Rex: You're wrong. Michael McBain is a much better father than Todd Manning.",
        "Audience: Ooh.",
        "Colin: So DNA doesn't matter?",
        "Rex: It matters, it's just --",
        "Colin: Not as important as how you treat a child. In which case, isn't our defending champion Lieutenant Brody Lovett a much better father than you could ever be?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Just about everything is working on my last nerve.",
        "Marcie: All right, Rox, just -- just calm down. Try to calm down, okay?",
        "Roxy: I know Rex wasn't always very nice to you.",
        "Marcie: Oh, Roxy, we got past that ages ago, you know? We -- we both loved Jen so much.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, it's really sweet, you making him Tommy's godfather.",
        "Marcie: Well, you know, Michael and I, we knew that if anything happened to Tommy, that, well, Rex would be there for him, protect him.",
        "Roxy: My bad little boy turned into a good one, huh?",
        "Marcie: Hey, he takes after his mother.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, he certainly doesn't take after his father. Michael, is he okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: You're dying here.",
        "[Music plays]",
        "Colin: That means we have a very special guest. Jen Rappaport, come on down.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Rex: Jen?",
        "Jen: Hey, Rex.",
        "Rex: You're -- you're dead. And you're dead. So does that mean that I'm not living anymore?",
        "Jen: That's not a question I'm here to ask. You ready, Rex?",
        "Rex: No.",
        "Jen: Which of the following best teaches your son how to be a good man \u0096 A, burning a community center down for the insurance money? B, blackmailing R.J. Gannon for a nightclub? C, planning an art heist? Or D, sleeping with my mother?",
        "Lindsay's voice: While you were sleeping with my daughter.",
        "Colin: Ladies and gentlemen, it's Lindsay Rappaport, come on down.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Rex: Can I get a help line here?",
        "Colin: And we'll be right back after this message from our sponsors. Don't you dare go away.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Listen, I'm glad you guys are all here. Dr. Gangemi asked me to come down and speak with you.",
        "Roxy: And who is that?",
        "Michael: He's the head surgeon who's working on Rex.",
        "Roxy: Is he any good?",
        "Michael: Jay is the best. Now, listen. Rex has lost a lot of blood. I mean, the bullet just -- it tore through him. He's hanging in there, but he's got a good fight ahead of him.",
        "Roxy: If that's all there is then he's home free, 'cause he's the toughest little scrapper there ever was. Right, Bo?",
        "Bo: You're right, Rox. Thanks, Mike.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I'll keep you posted.",

        "Natalie: Don't you dare compare me to you. I never wanted Nash to die. I loved Nash. He was family to me. And I feel terrible about what happened to him, but you? You don't lose a wink of sleep knowing that I am locked down here like a caged animal while you're sitting there making Jared believe that I left town. And I've heard the things that you've been saying to him about me. But you know what, honey? It ain't working because Jared loves me. Jared will not give up on me. Your plan's a bust. Because when this is all over, it is all over and Jared and I will be stronger than ever. And where will you be? Think that they're going to let you raise Bree and the little one? You're going to be all alone, Tess. Nash is dead. He's not coming back. He's gone and nothing you do to me will change that.",

        "Colin: Kind of a pattern with you, Rex. Two-for-one? What do you think, audience? Does Rex's habit of romancing two women at the same time make him a good dad?",
