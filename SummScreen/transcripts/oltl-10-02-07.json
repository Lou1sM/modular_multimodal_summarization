        "Judy: Did you not understand the question, Mrs. Manning? Would a good father convince the woman he claims to love that her son died in childbirth?",
        "Blair: You're twisting everything around.",
        "Judy: Does a good father fake the death of a day-old infant and then foist him on total strangers in a foreign country?",
        "Blair: It's complicated.",
        "Judy: Really? It sounds simple to me. You gave birth to a son by the complainant, Todd Manning, who then turned around and foisted him on total strangers in a foreign country. Sounds like a dry run for what he later tried to pull with Tommy McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cole groans]",
        "Markko: Who needs trig, anyway? I'm not trying to build a pyramid anytime soon.",
        "Cole: I know, right? That's what I'm saying.",
        "[Markko sighs]",
        "Markko: You know, they should teach us something we can actually use, like -- like understanding your girl freak 101.",
        "Cole: What are you looking at me for?",
        "Markko: What, did you and Starr hit a road bump?",
        "Cole: We had a little argument.",
        "Markko: Oh. Yeah, well, you got it easy, ok? Because at least with Starr, you know what you're arguing about. Langston -- she just gets pissed and runs out. God, I'd give my left leg to know what was up with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Hi, Dr. Lord. Is Starr around?",
        "Dorian: No. In fact, I'm surprised she isn't with you.",
        "Langston: I got distracted at school. I must have missed her.",
        "Dorian: Please, she's going to be home in a minute. Why don't you wait?",
        "Langston: Oh, no, it's ok.",
        "Dorian: I insist. Besides -- ah -- it's teatime. You've spent so many nights here in this house. My goodness, don't you think it's time that we got to know each other a lot better?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Do you know who I am, Lindsay?",
        "Nora: We should -- we should call her doctor.",
        "Will: No, no, no, wait. No, no, not yet. I think he might be getting somewhere.",
        "Bo: Lindsay, it's Bo. And Will's here, too. We're both here for you. Can you say something -- let us know that -- that you're ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Morgan: Objection! Opposing counsel is badgering the witness.",
        "Judge: Dial it down, Counselor.",
        "Judy: When you learned what Todd did to his own son -- and we're talking about the first one, Jack -- did you still want him to be a father to your kids?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Table 12 is pissed.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, I know. I'm comping them a round of mojitos. Look, Antonio, I can't talk right now, man. I'm understaffed.",
        "Antonio: What do you need?",
        "Cristian: Aren't you on duty? Look, this is not the right time for you to be around here, all right?",
        "Antonio: Why? Because you're short one server?",
        "Cristian: Why? You want to know why? Because I'm going to fire that piece of work the second she walks through that door, that's why.",
        "Sarah: Sweet. All right, all right, I'll check you later. I'm sorry I'm being so noisy. I'm running late, and I am the world's multi-tasker.",
        "Layla: No worries.",
        "Sarah: I can't find the shirt I wanted to wear tonight. Can you believe I've been here all of one day, and I'm already losing things?",
        "[Sarah sighs]",
        "Layla: Hmm.",
        "Sarah: I'm driving you crazy, aren't I?",
        "Layla: Girlfriend, relax. You look like you're about to pop a vein.",
        "Sarah: I keep cutting it too close to my shift. But I'm working on it, I swear. I do not want to mess up this whole roommate-roommate thing we've got going.",
        "Layla: Ok. You really need to take a deep breath. I'm serious.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Layla: And why should you bust your butt, you know, changing your routine now? It's going to change anyway when you win that bet with Cristian.",
        "[Sarah laughs]",
        "Layla: And --",
        "Sarah: Piece of cake.",
        "Layla: Hi, Talia. What's up?",
        "[Closes door]",
        "Talia: I made up an imaginary boyfriend for my boss' benefit, and now he wants to meet him.",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Talia: Please help me, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Now we're getting somewhere.",
        "Blair: Todd made mistakes, but he --",
        "Judy: Mistakes? You've got quite a talent for understatement.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and you got quite a talent for being a bitch.",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: Not in my courtroom, Mrs. Manning.",
        "Blair: Look, what Todd did was wrong, but he had his reasons.",
        "Judy: Pray tell.",
        "Blair: Well, first of all, he did not know that jack was his son.",
        "Judy: Reason enough to dump your wife's kid in the third world without a trace?",
        "Blair: I'm not saying what he did was right. But when Todd found out, he tried to move heaven and earth to bring his son back.",
        "Judy: What happened when Todd brought the baby back? How was he presented to you?",
        "Blair: He told me that the baby needed a home and that I should adopt him.",
        "Judy: Your own child? That doesn't make any sense.",
        "Blair: He didn't tell me that it was my son.",
        "Judy: He lied. When did you find out the truth?",
        "Blair: Jack came down with an inherited disease. It was the same disease his sister, Starr, had when she was younger.",
        "Judy: So you put two and two together?",
        "Blair: Jack's bone marrow donor was the same donor that saved Starr.",
        "Judy: Wait, now, let me get this straight. Your son had a life-threatening illness, a condition that might have been planned for -- perhaps even prevented -- had the complainant been honest with you from the start, had he never given the infant away in the first place. But instead, Mr. Manning kept up the lie, perpetuated it almost to the end of his own son's life, just to punish you.",
        "Blair: You are twisting everything around.",
        "Judy: Am I? Or did your husband? Ask yourself, Mrs. Manning, is anyone as important to Todd Manning as Todd Manning himself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: You know, when Nora told me what happened, I thought about calling out the big gun -- little Matthew. He cares a lot about you, Lindsay. Nora said that when -- when she was sick all those months, that it was Matthew who actually brought her out of it. Always show up, and he'd just keep talking to her and talking to her. And -- and she heard him. Even in a coma, she heard everything that he said. I guess he has a way with words, huh? Better than his old man, but I'm going to give it a try. Because it's you. Just wish you knew how many people care about you, and -- and want to protect you. Like me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Starr hasn't cornered the market on listening skills. Come on. Spit it out.",
        "Langston: I got into a fight with my boyf-- with Markko. It's no big deal.",
        "Dorian: Oh, did you come to the right place. I tell you, I've had more than my share of, shall we say, disagreements with men.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Oh. What happened?",
        "Langston: He started butting into all sorts of things that were none of his business. And I -- I mean, I really like him, but that doesn't give him an all-access pass.",
        "Dorian: You don't want to compromise your independence.",
        "Langston: Why should I?",
        "Dorian: No, no, I'm agreeing with you.",
        "Langston: You are?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely! I mean, men -- well, some of them -- can be very unreliable. Whereas your own personal values and standards -- those are forever. Like family. I'm sure your parents would agree with me.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Of course, how would I know?",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: I've never met them. I -- I've got it! Yes, absolutely. I am going to give a little dinner party. Something [Speaking French]. You know, just you, your parents, me, of course, Starr, and Blair. We'll get to know each other over a delicious gourmet meal.",
        "Langston: I -- that -- that's not possible. I -- my parents are still overseas.",
        "Dorian: But you said they were coming back home weeks ago.",
        "Langston: I lied.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: If you spent one moment with Jack and Starr, you would realize how much they adore their father. And Todd -- he -- his children mean everything to him.",
        "Judy: What steps did you take to protect your children after you discovered Todd lied about your son, Jack?",
        "Blair: I -- I sued for full custody.",
        "Judy: What else?",
        "Blair: Isn't that enough?",
        "Judy: Did you take the two kids to Hawaii?",
        "Blair: On a vacation.",
        "Judy: You didn't transport them across six time zones to prevent Todd from kidnapping them?",
        "Blair: I took my children to Hawaii for fun.",
        "Judy: Did Mr. Manning showed up and tried to forcibly remove Starr and Jack from your custody?",
        "Morgan: Objection. Argumentative, your honor.",
        "Judge: Counselor --",
        "Judy: I'll rephrase. Did Mr. Manning --",
        "Blair: He did not.",
        "Judy: What? Succeed in absconding with your children? And that was thanks to the intervention of Sam Rappaport and Tea Delgado, isn't that correct? But during the kidnapping attempt, didn't the would-be getaway vehicle capsize in the middle of the pacific, almost drowning Ms. Delgado, Mr. Manning, and his hired help? Am I correct in saying that your children might not be alive today had they fallen into your husband's clutches? Do you honestly think that he would have had the foresight to put Starr and Jack in lifejackets when he couldn't do the same for Margaret Cochran when she was eight months pregnant?",
        "Blair: Ok, you know, you can manipulate this story any way you want. But the truth is, Todd loves his children, and he would do anything for them. And we're going to raise our children in a safe, loving home.",
        "Judy: By \"our children,\" do you mean to include Tommy McBain?",
        "Blair: Absolutely.",
        "Judy: Well, then I'm doubly concerned. Because that would mean they would have Todd, on the one hand -- rapist, attempted kidnapper, attempted murderer -- and then there's you. Repeat patient at St. Ann's Psychiatric Hospital, and an attempted murderer twice over. Tell us, Mrs. Manning, what will you do if your husband loses custody? Push Marcie McBain out a window like you did to Tea Delgado?",
        "Starr: Hey, you lay off my Mom! If you want to know what my parents are like, you ask me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: I have no idea how to handle this. Well, you're sane. So tell me what to do. I didn't realize you had company. I'm sorry.",
        "Layla: Oh, Sarah is my new roommate. Adriana left me to shack up with Rex.",
        "Sarah: Hi. Well, got to run. See you, roomie.",
        "Layla: I'll be by there later.",
        "Sarah: Cool.",
        "Talia: Look, I hate -- I hate to dump this all on your lap. I'm sorry, I --",
        "Layla: No apologies. You saved my life and my best friends' lives. As far as I'm concerned, you can walk through that door saying whatever you want. Now, do you need me to call in Adriana for a cons--",
        "Talia: No, no! God, no. She's related to the problem.",
        "Layla: How? You said you had a boyfriend. I thought you were single.",
        "Talia: I was. No, I am. I am single. I've been single for a very long time. But the point is, at Capricorn right now waiting to meet him.",
        "Layla: How did that happen?",
        "Talia: Because I made him up! But what does that matter? The point is, I have to be at Capricorn with a guy on my arm in 15 minutes. And all I have is a figment of my imagination.",
        "Layla: Ok, there's something I'm not getting here.",
        "Talia: Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Aren't you an actor? Right? Ok, don't you have actor friends who could pretend to be my boyfriend, George, for, like, an hour? Oh!",
        "Layla: \"George\"?",
        "[Layla chuckles]",
        "Talia: Yeah, didn't you watch \"The Brady Bunch\"? Jan? Whatever -- it worked for her.",
        "Layla: Ok, wait. Why would you make up a fake boyfriend and tell Antonio about it?",
        "Layla: Oh, please. Please tell me you're not hot for your boss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: If Sarah books bands the way she serves tables, she's never getting that promotion.",
        "Antonio: Well, fire her, man. I trust you.",
        "Cristian: I can't fire her, man. She needs the job.",
        "Antonio: Well, then cut her pay or demote her to dishwasher or charge her for the glassware, but do something, man, before you have a coronary.",
        "Cristian: She moved out, you know. Now she has to make rent for real.",
        "Antonio: This is the same girl that -- that refused to take money from her family based on principle?",
        "Cristian: Yeah",
        "Antonio: You looking for this? Nice. Why don't you -- why don't you talk to her? You know, I mean, just l down the law, you know, tell her what the stakes are. I'm sure she'll do better. If she doesn't, well, then, look, you did your best, and you can cut her loose with -- with a clear conscience.",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Antonio: Unless that's not what you want.",
        "Cristian: What I want is for this place to run smoothly -- with or without Sarah Roberts.",
        "Sarah: Hey, boss, sorry I'm late, but I am here and I'm ready to rock. Where do you want me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Langston, why would you say your parents were coming home when they weren't?",
        "Langston: Look, I -- I know how it must look. My -- my parents are always away, and -- and I'm a minor, and -- and blah, blah, blah.",
        "Dorian: Oh, honey, it's a lot more than \"blah, blah, blah.\" You need your parents.",
        "Langston: But they give me everything I need. I mean, I'm proud of them. They go all over the world, traveling to help people who are in need.",
        "Dorian: Well, that's wonderful, but what about their own daughter?",
        "Langston: Well, I'm totally fine. I'm -- I'm healthy, I'm happy.",
        "Dorian: I would feel a lot better if I could talk to them directly. Would you mind giving me a number where I can reach them?",
        "Langston: I -- I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Young lady, I understand your feelings, but unless you're specifically directed to voice them, you are to keep quiet, understood? I'll allow a 15-minute recess. Use it wisely.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Blair: What in the world are you doing here, Starr?",
        "Starr: I want to testify.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Absolutely not.",
        "Starr: Put me up there. I can win.",
        "Todd: Did you hear what I just said?",
        "Starr: Dad, we are getting our butts kicked, and I can change that.",
        "Todd: You're not even supposed -- to be here!",
        "Starr: How many times have I told you that I can handle this? The lawyer is nothing compared to Britney.",
        "Blair: Come on, the stakes are much higher here in court, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: I know, mom. It's win or lose my baby brother. I get that. I want him to come home, too.",
        "Morgan: She's got a point. We got ambushed. It's not looking good.",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Come on. You saw that lawyer. She's out for blood.",
        "Todd: Sweetie, if I put you up on that stand, I look like the kind of father she's been describing me as.",
        "Starr: She's already made you look like a horrible father. And the only way to change that is for me to go up there and tell them that you're not. Don't be worried about me, ok? I can handle this.",
        "Morgan: What do you say?",
        "Todd: Ok.",
        "Morgan: I'll inform the court.",
        "Todd: You're sure about this?",
        "Starr: I'm not going home until they have to hear what I say.",
        "Marcie: Something's up.",
        "Judy: They're going to use Starr to humanize Todd and Blair.",
        "Michael: This is bad for us, isn't it?",
        "Judy: Not I can help it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Forget what I said, all right? I was just -- tripping.",
        "Cole: Hmm. You know how I'm going to make it up to Starr? Apologize.",
        "Markko: Ha! Really?",
        "Cole: Why not?",
        "Markko: Uh -- pride.",
        "Cole: Hmm. You see, with Starr and , usually honesty helps -- except this time, it didn't, so I'm going to suck up my pride and apologize for arguing.",
        "Markko: Yeah, but what if that doesn't work?",
        "Cole: Hopefully, it doesn't come to that. All right, well, that's enough male bonding for one day, so I will catch you later.",
        "Markko: All right. See you.",
        "Cole: Good luck with Langston.",
        "Markko: Thanks.",
        "[Markko sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: What do you mean you can't give me a telephone number for your parents?",
        "Langston: Well, I -- I would, but they can't be reached by phone.",
        "Dorian: I find that hard to believe.",
        "Langston: Oh, well, phone signals are -- are a security risk where they are. There's -- there's rebel separatists and -- and they'd be toast if the wrong people found out they had satellite phones.",
        "Dorian: But surely they set up something -- mean, a contact person?",
        "Langston: Yeah, um -- I -- you know what? I have the information at home and I just need to go and -- and find it, so tell Starr I'll catch her later.",
        "Dorian: Langston? I hope you don't misunderstand my concern.",
        "Langston: I get it -- you care just like Markko cares.",
        "Dorian: Huh. Well, there's a lot more to that boy than I gave him credit for.",
        "Langston: See you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I should've been at your arraignment. I was with you every step of the way and then I just -- I dropped the ball. I think -- oh, I don't know. It doesn't matter, I'm here now. And whatever you need, I'm going to be there for you. You say the word and I'll come running.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: You may be seat.",
        "Morgan: How are you doing today, Starr?",
        "Starr: I'm ok.",
        "Morgan: Good. Uh -- nervous at all?",
        "Starr: Not anymore.",
        "Morgan: Good. Could you please describe your parents? Tell this court what they mean to you.",
        "Starr: I can say that I love my parents more than anything in this world, but -- that wouldn't be true. They are my world.",
        "Morgan: Take your time.",
        "Starr: My mom has an amazing voice. Seriously, if you heard her sing, she would make you cry. And I inherited a little bit of her talent. It actually got me the lead in my high school musical last year. I guess that really has nothing to do with this right now.",
        "Morgan: No, this is absolutely relevant. Nurturing a child's talent is extremely important.",
        "Starr: Huh. I had the worst time last year in school. Someone was making my life a living hell. I wanted to curl up and disappear. But then this gift that my mom had, that she had given to me -- that gift, it meant so much to me. I didn't feel like a loser anymore. I felt special because I -- being Blair Cramer's daughter made me feel special. And my dad, he -- he has had to work for every little thing in his life. Last year, he -- he got the death sentence, and I thought that I was never going to see him again. But then he came back. He came back to us because he loved us so much.",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Starr: Talk about heroes -- huh. My parents are like super parents. Sure, they can get annoying, they check my homework and they grill my friends to make sure that they're not bad influences, but they make me feel better about myself. My mom and dad aren't perfect. And they make mistakes. But they don't deserve this. My dad doesn't deserve to have his son taken away from him, your honor! So, please, just let us take him home.",
        "[Morgan sighs]",
        "Morgan: Thank you for your words here today, Starr.",
        "Marcie: Judy? Please go easy on her.",
        "Judy: I am here to make sure you and Michael keep your son.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Judy: Ok, then, Starr. Just a few more questions and all this will be over, ok?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: No, no, I -- I -- no. I do not have the hots for Antonio. I don't -- I don't really know where you got that idea from.",
        "Layla: From the smoke signals you've been sending up for the last five minutes.",
        "Talia: I've not been sending up smoke signals.",
        "Layla: Hmm. Hey, I think it's great.",
        "[Talia sighs]",
        "Layla: You're great, he's great. Two greats together make hot, hot, hot.",
        "Talia: Don't! Look, I don't know how to get through to you, but I --",
        "Layla: You mean get one over on me, right? Because now that I know, I know. And what you really want to know is what you should do about it.",
        "Talia: Oh. Whew. He's my boss. And he's still hung up on his ex-wife.",
        "Layla: He's a hottie. He's single.",
        "Talia: He thinks that I have a boyfriend named George!",
        "Layla: So break up with the fake one and get with the real thing.",
        "Talia: Uh --",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Talia: I can't do that. I can't just show up to Capricorn and be, like, \"Oh, me and -- we broke up.\" It's, you know -- he'll see right through me, you know? He'll get me to talk, he'll ask me questions. I -- I can't. That --",
        "Layla: Can't happen, yeah.",
