    "Recap": [
        "John is returning from his flight after unsuccessfully looking for Cristian. But he runs into an old acquaintance who \"enlightens\" him about whom the mysterious woman might be who Ramsey might have hid in his house before he died and who Todd is now hiding. Meanwhile, Marty finds her way downstairs and gets on the computer to find the newspaper article where she got raped. But she still cannot find out whom the rapist was. Rex is hanging between life and death. And he has a dream where he's on a game show that is called: \"Are you fit to be Shane Morasco's Dad\". Deceased Colin McIver and Jen Rappaport host the show and it's in the format of \"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire\". And they ask Rex many questions about his shady past. And one specific question comes up that he cannot answer and that is about who (among 8 choices of men) is Rex's real father. And it looks like Rex might have lost the game where Brody has won and Brody is seen as Shane's real father."

        "John: We're about to take off, so I can't talk long. The guard swore to me that Cris was in the prison, but he got out somehow. I don't know. I -- I hit a brick wall. Listen, I'll call you as soon as I get in. Later.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "Pete: I'd know that sigh anywhere.",
        "John: Pete?",
        "Pete: The one and only. And what's on your mind, John?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Marty screams]",
        "Marty: Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There she is.",
        "Tess: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Todd: I've been looking all over for you. Guess I should've checked the basement, huh?",
        "Tess: Where have you been holed up? Or should I say, with whom? Excuse me; I think I'll check on my daughter.",
        "Todd: Isn't that Bree's mother's job? I don't see Bree's mother here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Amen, or whatever. I want to thank everybody for praying for Rexy. He'd be so proud and grateful to know that you were here for him, especially you two.",
        "Gigi: Rex is in that operating room because of us. He saved our lives. And Shane knows now. He knows that his father took a bullet so he wouldn't get hit, and... we're just so grateful for Rex's sacrifice, and we owe him so much, don't we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor flatlining]",
        "Dr. Jay: He's bleeding. Get me some atropine. Mike, we must've missed something. Widen that incision and find the bleeding.",
        "Michael: Scalpel. Come on, Rex, stay with me, man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Colin: Welcome back to \"So you think you can be Shane Morasco's father?\" Where I'm sorry to say, our challenger, Rex Balsom, has just flatlined.",
        "[Audience groans]",
        "Rex: What do you mean, flatlined?",
        "Colin: You ran out of time, Rex. Game over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: What's everyone looking at?",
        "Charlie: Well, we're all just a little bit shaky is all. Hospitals have a tendency to do that to you.",
        "Roxy: Hey, everybody, this is Shane, my grandson.",
        "Jared: I didn't know you and Shane were related. But I guess I can see the resemblance.",
        "Roxy: The cheekbones, right?",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: Hey, listen. I don't like to do this \"grandma\" stuff. So, how about if you just call me nana? I don't like that either. How about just Roxy? Maybe we should go down to the cafeteria, and we'll get some chocolate milk. I'll tell you all about your daddy.",
        "Bo: Roxy, um, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask Shane a few questions, you know, just on some details while it's still fresh. Would you mind?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, no prob.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "Roxy: I'll take a rain check on that chocolate milk.",
        "Shane: I guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You reach Adriana yet?",
        "Layla: Keeps going straight to voicemail. I -- I don't know what to do. I've left her a dozen messages. If anything happens to Rex, Adriana will never forgive herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor flatlining]",
        "Michael: More suction, damn it, I can't see.",
        "Dr. Jay: Is that atropine on board?",
        "Nurse: Yes, Doctor.",
        "Dr. Jay: Mike, he's running out of time.",
        "Michael: No, I got it, I got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: As runner-up, you'll receive a year's supply of Rodi's burgers, as well as the knowledge that Shane will always remember you as the guy who gave his real dad a run for his money. Isn't that right, Brody?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Rex: But that's not fair.",
        "Colin: I'm afraid your answer was wrong, Rex.",
        "Rex: I know it was wrong. I know Bo Buchanan is not my biological father. What I'm trying to say is, is that if I could pick somebody to be my father, if I had a say in the matter, I'd want Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: That's a lot to take in. You grow up thinking that Brody is your dad. You love him. Then all the sudden, you find out that even though Brody did his best, that Rex is your real father. That's tough.",
        "Shane: Like you'd know.",
        "Bo: Oh, I know a lot more than you'd think I do. And my son, Matthew? He knows exactly how you feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Bo's like my role model, you know? He's the guy I go to whenever I need a little course correction. Or just somebody to talk to. I know he's not perfect, but nobody is. But he tries hard, and he's willing to admit his mistakes and try and fix them. And I think that's important, you know, to be willing to fix things.",
        "Colin: I'm sorry, and this makes Bo your father how?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: With Matthew and me, uh, you know, it didn't happen overnight. We had to get to know each other. And that took time. But it was worth it. So, you think that, uh, you're willing to take a little time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I know Bo is not my father. Even if he were, that's not the point.",
        "Colin: Ah, but the question --",
        "Rex: Is bogus. I'm worthy of being Shane's father, okay? I'm worthy because I want to be the kind of father Bo is.",
        "Colin: Judges?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: When is Bree's mommy coming back anyway? Does Aunty Tess have to get another STD for her to come to her senses?",
        "Tess: Cute. You know, Todd, I do love this fatherly side of you. But it's too bad, you know, you're not allowed to see your own kids, huh?",
        "Todd: At least I take care of my kids. I walked by Bree's room, and she was bawling her eyes out.",
        "Tess: Bree's fine.",
        "Todd: Until you disappear on her again.",
        "Tess: Uh, Todd, do you even know where your kids are? If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go check on my daughter.",
        "Todd: What have you done with your sister, Tess?",
        "Tess: Nothing worse than what you've done to Marty. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Flight attendant: Are you all set?",
        "Pete: This is great, thanks.",
        "John: Yeah, thank you for switching the seats.",
        "Flight attendant: Sure.",
        "John: I can't believe I ran into you on a flight from Bogot\u00e1.",
        "Pete: I couldn't believe they wanted a blind, retired cop to consult with the Colombian national police force, but they did. How about you?",
        "John: Missing person.",
        "Pete: Any leads?",
        "John: No. I got close, and then the trail got cold. I got other cases I got to get back to.",
        "Pete: Is it one of those other cases that's eating at you? Because I know something is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Janet? Janet?",
        "Tess: You still here?",
        "Todd: I'd be happy to shove off, as soon as you tell me what you did with Natalie.",
        "Tess: Why, so you can call Viki? I wouldn't do that, because then I would be forced to take out a full page ad, inviting everyone in town to my \"Welcome home, Marty Saybrooke\" party. So why don't you do yourself a favor? Forget about Natalie. That way, you won't have to feel guilty about not lifting a finger to help her. Oh, look who I'm talking to. You guilty? I don't believe my eyes.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Tess: You've grown a conscience. You should get more sleep.",
        "Todd: I've always had a conscience.",
        "Tess: Yeah, but you've never really had a problem ignoring it. You've been hanging out with the wrong people. Saint Marty of the bleeding heart? Tell me, do you love the way she looks at you? Her hero, her savior? I wonder how'd she look at you if she knew what you really did to her, huh? I can't believe it. Finally happened. You've got a case of the guilts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You did the right thing, telling him about Rex.",
        "Gigi: I should've told him sooner. If Rex dies --",
        "Marcie: Don't.",
        "Gigi: I knew, Marcie, I knew. I knew from the minute Rex walked into the bon- jour what I wanted, but I -- I didn't -- I didn't want to hurt anyone.",
        "Marcie: And that's one really good reason to wait.",
        "Gigi: But they could've had all this time to be together. This might not even have happened if I'd just gotten it all out in the open. Now Rex is dying and Brody's in jail and my son is going to hate me for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: I don't need time. I already know Rex.",
        "Bo: Yeah? What do you think of him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Colin: Welcome back. While waiting for our judges to make a decision, let's see what our contestants are playing for. Up for grabs, one cute-as-a-button, asthmatic 10-year-old. Audience: Aww.",
        "Colin: So who'll take home our prize? Will it be our returning champ?",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Colin: Or our challenger?",
        "[Boos]",
        "Colin: Whose run seems nearly at an end?",
        "Rex: How about his real dad?",
        "Colin: How about him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Jay: Mike, we need to defib.",
        "Michael: Doctor, just give me another minute.",
        "Dr. Jay: He doesn't have another minute, Mike!",
        "Michael: Come on, Rex.",
        "Dr. Jay: Clear!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Rex isn't a bad guy. He's not like -- he's not Brody.",
        "Bo: No. No, he isn't.",
        "Shane: Brody's a Navy Seal, a war hero.",
        "Bo: Brody is a good man, and we are going to do everything we can to get him all the help that he needs. I promise you that. You know something? I was in a war a long time ago. Vietnam. And I know that it takes courage to distinguish yourself.",
        "Shane: He has medals.",
        "Bo: Really? Balsom isn't, uh, the soldier type, do you think?",
        "Shane: No.",
        "Bo: I know. I didn't think so either, but that's what surprises me so much about what happened today, up on that mountain. I mean, he threw himself over you and your mom. You know, I never thought that Rex would do anything like that, and then when he was shot, that -- that was really, really heroic. And if they gave medals to civilians, I think that Rex would definitely deserve one. Of course, like you said, Rex is nothing like Brody, as a dad. You know, he would definitely be different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Dads count, I get that. I didn't have one growing up and it showed. But I've changed. I found Bo, and he's the best father a man could ever ask for. I respect him, I pay attention to what he says, and I learn from him. And if I can do that, then I can be a good father for Shane. Because I know what it's like growing up without a father. I heard a saying, \"to be a man, you have to see a man.\" Well, I want to be that man for Shane. I want to be him. Just please, please, give me a chance.",
        "Colin: The judges have made their decision. We'll learn what it is, right after this break. Don't you dare go away.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I'm going to take off for a little while, Rox. I'm going to see if I can find Natalie for you.",
        "Roxy: That would be great, man. Where the heck is she?",
        "Jared: That's what I want to know. Keep me posted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Colin: Welcome back to \"So you think you can be Shane Morasco's father?\" Well, how about it, audience? Have we kept our challenger sweating long enough?",
        "Audience: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Jay: Shock at 360, please.",
        "Michael: It's Mike, Rex, do you hear me? It's Mike.",
        "Dr. Jay: Clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Colin: The judges have thought long and hard. They've consulted all the rule books.",
        "Rex: Tell me what they said.",
        "Colin: Rex Balsom... you're going on to the lightning round!",
        "Audience: Ooh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor beeps steadily]",
        "Michael: He's back in sinus rhythm.",
        "Dr. Jay: All right, let's find that bleeder before we lose him again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Colin: Congratulations, Rex. The judges awarded you points for creativity. You're still hanging in there. There's one more question left, Rex, and it's a biggie. You've seen the grand prize, Shane Morasco. But what would you be willing to give up? And before you pull your checkbook out, Rex, I'm not talking about dollars and cents here. I'm talking about your one and only baby mama, Gigi Morasco!",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Colin: Shane is yours to take home today. But only if you're willing to leave Gigi behind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Rex has Michael and a whole team of doctors who are working on him. They're not going to let him get away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I don't have to make a case for Rex. I -- it's like you said, you already know him. And I trust you to do the right thing and give the man a chance.",
        "Shane: Why?",
        "Bo: Because then you will know.",
        "Shane: It's not like I want him to die.",
        "Bo: No, I know that. I want you to give a little thought to how much you'd miss him.",
        "Roxy: Mike, you gotta tell me. Is he okay? Is he going to make it?",
        "Michael: Yeah, the surgery's over, all right? But the bullet did a lot of damage. We repaired his liver, but we had to remove his spleen.",
        "Roxy: Answer me! Is he going to make it?",
        "Gigi: It's okay. Rex is his father, he needs to know.",
        "Michael: Ahem. Rex survived the surgery, but he's still in critical condition, all right? Which means that he's got another fight ahead of him. And we are doing absolutely everything that we can, but we could still lose him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pete: So this Manning character has a woman stashed in his house, and you have no idea who she is?",
        "John: I don't even know if she's in trouble. All I got are some x-rays.",
        "Pete: Well, and those x-rays indicate that she's so banged up, she couldn't possibly have moved herself from that homicide scene.",
        "John: That's why I've been pursuing it.",
        "Pete: Well, that's one reason.",
        "John: What's that mean?",
        "Pete: Well, it means you're like your old man. Like me, too. It gets under your skin, it's personal.",
        "John: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Pete: So how are you putting this case together?",
        "John: I figure Manning was on the scene when the homicide went down, he discovered the woman, he moved her before we got there.",
        "Pete: Why'd he do that?",
        "John: For some reason, she must be useful to him. It's just the kind of guy that he is.",
        "Pete: Well, okay. You got a few things to work with.",
        "John: Pete, it's all speculation. I got a search warrant, I found nothing. I got the mayor all over me to drop the case.",
        "Pete: Ain't that guy a doozy?",
        "John: Oh, I could tell you stories. I probably should just bag it.",
        "Pete: Yeah, well, you're not going to do that.",
        "John: Yeah, why is that?",
        "Pete: Because you're John McBain, and you're in it to win it. That's just the deal.",
        "John: When'd you get so smart?",
        "Pete: Well, Estelle says it's because I can't see. She said when I lost the use of my eyes, I had to learn to use my brain. She also said I had to learn to trust my intuition.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I would be careful if I were you, because I know better than anyone that the mind is a tricky thing. Marty's mind could heal all by itself one day. You could walk in, and she could look at you and start screaming and pointing, and saying you're the one that raped her.",
        "Todd: But this plan of yours to punish Natalie for killing Nash, that's going to work out great for you, right? It's funny that you think that Nash is yours to avenge.",
        "Tess: No, it's not. Nash was mine more than anyone. He met me first, okay? He fell in love with me.",
        "Todd: Oh. No, he left you, crackerjack, for Jessica. He was so over you, he had her locked up when he thought she'd let you out.",
        "Tess: That's a lie.",
        "Todd: No, it's a cold, hard fact. Jessica's the one he wanted. Jessica's the one he married. Jessica is the one who mothered his children. You know, Tess, the only reason you're out here is because Jessica lost her grip, but she's going to get it back. She always does.",
        "Tess: No. You see, she's not going to get it back. She hasn't yet and --",
        "Jared: Jessica? Jessica?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So, for the time being, he's sedated and he's on a ventilator to help him breathe.",
        "Roxy: Are we going to be able to sit with him?",
        "Michael: Uh, yes, but, uh, just one at a time for now.",
        "Roxy: Okay.",
        "Roxy: Oh, my God. Oh, God.",
        "Michael: Rox --",
        "Roxy: Yeah?",
        "Michael: If you'd like to go in first, you can, all right?",
        "Roxy: Uh, oh, yeah, I think I left the iron on back at the hotel.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no, Roxy, I'll take care of the iron. You go see Rex.",
        "Roxy: You know, I can't because maybe I got germs or something like that.",
        "Charlie: There's nothing you can do to hurt him, Roxy, but you can let him know that his mother is there with him and you can make him feel safe and loved, okay?",
        "Roxy: I wasn't so lovable to him when he was a kid.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, you are now, okay?",
        "Roxy: You're a gift, you know that? Okay, Rox, hit it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Do I have to go in there?",
        "Gigi: Oh, honey, I know you're scared. So am I.",
        "Shane: I wouldn't know what to say.",
        "Gigi: Look, sweetie, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to make you do something you don't want to do. I don't even know if Rex can hear us. But if he can, don't you think it would mean a lot to him to hear you tell him that you hope he gets better?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: You know, kiddo, it's a good thing that you don't have to look at yourself, because you look like hell. You got your hair going every which way. You got these funny tubes coming out of your mouth and you're so pale. You need a little color in your cheeks or else when your son comes in, you're going to scare him half to death.",
        "Roxy: Do you remember when you were a kid and you cracked your head open on the TV stand? There was blood dripping all over the carpet and I lifted you up and I took you all the way to the emergency room. That poor doctor, because you were screaming at him, every -- every bad word in the book and I got real paranoid because I thought he was going to call youth services and turn me in for teaching you how to swear. But, you know, the doctor stitched you up and he gave you back to me. That's why I know you got to come back. 'Cause your son knows all about you. Gigi told him. So he needs you. He really, really needs you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I -- I can't choose between Shane and Gigi.",
        "Brody: I can.",
        "Rex: Nobody asked you. I choose them both, Gigi and Shane.",
        "Colin: I'm sorry, Rex. It's not an option.",
        "Rex: I -- I can't choose my son over his mother. That's not fair to him.",
        "Colin: Sorry, those are the rules.",
        "Rex: Who made these rules?",
        "Colin: Let's show Rex what he stands to lose if he refuses to take a chance and make a choice.",
        "Colin: That's your future, Rex. In other words, no life at all if you refuse to choose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: What's going on?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Nothing.",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah? Because I heard a bit of yelling from downstairs.",
        "Todd: I guess the cat's out of the bag. I came here to discuss something with Jessica but she's not herself.",
        "Jared: Yeah, what's wrong?",
        "Todd: Have you seen Natalie?",
        "Jared: No, have you?",
        "Todd: Nope, sadly. Not lately.",
        "Jared: Jess, you okay?",
        "Todd: She's upset.",
        "Tess: Yeah, you would be too if you lost someone that you loved.",
        "Todd: No, no, I mean about, uh, about me having to fire you from the paper.",
        "Jared: She lost her husband and you fired her?",
        "Tess: It's okay, Jared, it's fine. I need to, um, focus more on my family.",
        "Todd: Yes, I think you should. Goodnight.",
        "Jared: Gee, I'm sorry that happened.",

        "Bo: What am I going to do with you, Balsom? I told you not to come along when we went after Brody. But did you listen? No. Since the day I met you, it's been one thing after another. And now you've got Gigi, a terrific girl, finally found out that her son is yours, and then you go and you do something like this. God, what were you thinking? You weren't. And then you throw yourself in front of a bullet? You saved... Balsom, I'm so damned proud of you. You listen up because this is the way it's going to be. I'm going to tell you what to do and you're going to do it. Now you're going to put yourself back together. You're not going to check out on me. You're not going to leave your family because we need you. You're going to suck it up and you're going to do whatever it takes to get yourself back to us, and I mean 100%. Otherwise, this time, Balsom, I'm not going to forgive you.",

        "Colin: Well, let's not dwell on the negative, shall we? This is a game show. It's supposed to be fun. How about I sweeten the deal, huh? You give up Gigi, and, not only will you walk away with your son, I'll also throw in a lifetime supply of sexually fulfilling but ultimately disposable affairs.",

        "Tess: Yeah, really, I -- I mean her and Rex are so close. I don't think that she'd ever be able to forgive herself if he - you know.",

        "Tess: Yeah.",
        "Jared: It's just so weird, you know? I've left her like a million messages and it's all over the news. You know, even if she didn't want to talk to me I -- well, you'd think she'd call the hospital or Roxy or you.",
        "Tess: Yeah, well, you know, I know Natalie a lot better than you do and when she decides to get lost, she's history. She's probably someplace where, you know, no one's ever heard of Rex and no one really cares about him, you know?",
