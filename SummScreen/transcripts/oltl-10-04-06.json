        "Vincent tells Cristian that he is done as a boxer now that the commission has made its decision. He is a businessman and needs to make money, so he releases Cristian from his contract. Cristian vows to clear his name. Vincent hopes that he does just that. Natalie goes to her parents' place and they all crowd around her and offer her a shoulder should she need it. She realizes that she doesn't really need as much space as she thought. Todd finds Cristian and Evangeline in the park and Evangeline thanks him for the favorable article that he wrote about Todd in his paper. \"You know, those people who bet against you made a lot of money I know that I did \" Shaun has been friends with Vincent for many years. He feels that Vincent knows as well as he does that Cristian was set up. \"You should know,\" Todd says appearing at the table suddenly. \"You set him up!\" Shaun gets in Todd's face and is ready to throw him out of the restaurant. Todd tells Vincent that he overheard Ted talking and that he knows that the fight was fixed. \"Get me some coffee and a muffin and I will tell you all about it.\" Rex has a minute alone with Adriana and tries to get her into bed. She stops him, trying to make sure first that he understands that she wants to get to know 'Adriana' alone first, and then 'Rex and Adriana' will come into play later. Natalie tells her family how John was going to propose to her and she shows them the ring. Todd wants to know if Vincent profited from Cristian getting set up but there isn't time to answer as Layla appears. She tells Vincent of Hugh being in the accident and getting hurt. Vincent is upset hearing the news. \"Yeah, I hear that he is burned to a crisp.\" Layla finds his comment unwarranted. Vincent makes a comment about John as if he doesn't care about him being killed, Todd warns him not to talk like that about McBain! Starr and Langston are in the halls. Britney and her posse bump into Starr and Langston on purpose. They have a shouting match. Langston and Starr see the girls talking to some cute guys and when the girls clear out, Langston and Starr go to meet the guys. They get invited to a party that is going to be wild, and Starr beams. \"I love doing 'wild.'\" The girls rush out giggling and Langston has to ask if Starr will really get wild at the party. \"Why shouldn't I? I deserve to more than anyone else!\""

        "Cristian: Thinking about John?",
        "Evangeline: The idea that he's gone, it -- doesn't seem real to me.",
        "Cristian: Look, it just happened. Don't put so much pressure on yourself to handle it. Nobody expects that, you know? What are you doing?",
        "Evangeline: I'm going to check in on Natalie --",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Evangeline: Michael --",
        "Cristian: You're not listening.",
        "Evangeline: What, Cris?",
        "Cristian: Would you think about yourself for once? Just give it time, you know, take a deep breath, let it sink in.",
        "Evangeline: Why do you want to go to the diner and have breakfast with your mom?",
        "Cristian: I just can't take her going off about how unfair the boxing commission is, how she knows I would never take a dive, how they should let me defend myself.",
        "Evangeline: Well, she's being your mom. She's taking care of you.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but my family doesn't need that kind of negative attention, not again. I'm going to fix this. I'm going to find a way to get back in the ring again. I want that title. I'm going to get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: It's a great sound bite. Too bad it's just talk. Your boxing career is over, Vega.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Is Natalie's phone still off?",
        "Viki: It just goes directly to voicemail. I wish she had called last night.",
        "Clint: Well, it probably didn't even occur to her, Viki. She's been basically living at John's for quite a while now.",
        "Viki: Yes, but, Clint, John is gone now. And she should not be alone. We really need to find her.",
        "Natalie: I'm right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, are you really going to walk us all the way to the classroom?",
        "Todd: Why, Starr? Are you embarrassed to be seen with your old man?",
        "Langston: Are you kidding? You're so the hot topic right now. Definitely adds to our street cred.",
        "Starr: Yeah, a little too much.",
        "Langston: Thanks for the ride, Mr. Manning. You should've seen the look on their faces when we got out of your sports car -- green with envy.",
        "Starr: Dad? I love you, but could you please go now?",
        "Todd: No. Mrs. Kowalski wants to see me before class.",
        "Starr: Just you without mom?",
        "Todd: Guess so.",
        "Starr: Why didn't you tell me about it?",
        "Todd: Why do you need to know? Are you in some kind of trouble?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Rex, Rex, Rex, Rex. Oh, wait -- these are cashmere.",
        "Rex: Hey, I don't guarantee white-glove delivery.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Rex: Who are these sweaters for anyway?",
        "Layla: Ok, as if you don't spend at least as much time in front of the mirror as we do.",
        "Adriana: You nailed it, Layla. His closet is huge.",
        "Rex: It's a lot of work dating a model.",
        "Adriana: Ex-model. Can you put these on my bed, please?",
        "Rex: Anything for you, dear.",
        "Adriana: Thank you.",
        "Layla: Thank you. Oh.",
        "Adriana: Don't you have to go to work?",
        "Layla: Oh, I took a personal day and my paid vacation so I can start looking for a new job.",
        "Adriana: You're quitting B.E.?",
        "Layla: Yeah. It hasn't been the same now that Duke's gone. And I definitely can't pay my bills off of what I make at Capricorn.",
        "Adriana: I hear you. I quit \"Craze.\"",
        "Layla: What about modeling?",
        "Adriana: Hmm. I don't think I want to do that anymore. All those people staring at me, it just feels like everybody's a potential stalker.",
        "Layla: Don't worry -- you're not a creep magnet. Your mother hired that guy.",
        "Adriana: I know it doesn't make any sense, but I can't help it. I'm just a nervous wreck these days.",
        "Rex: Oh. You could work at U.V. if you want. bartending, hostessing. If you want jobs, they're yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, Natalie. Oh. You ok?",
        "Jessica: We must've called you, like, a hundred times.",
        "Viki: We were worried.",
        "Natalie: I'm here now.",
        "Viki: Did you get any sleep at all?",
        "Clint: Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Hey, dad.",
        "Clint: Oh, I love you, honey. Can I get you anything, coffee or something?",
        "Natalie: No, thanks.",
        "Viki: Natalie, sweetheart, I want you to know that this will always be home for you, ok?",
        "Natalie: Thanks. I know, I just -- I really didn't know where else to go right now.",
        "Viki: Do you want anything -- breakfast or anything?",
        "Natalie: I'm not hungry.",
        "Jessica: Breakfast isn't going to help, nothing is. I mean, John's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, no, I'm not in trouble. Why would I be? School's barely even started.",
        "Todd: Because you're a lot like me and I always manage to find trouble from day one.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, maybe I'm trying to learn from your mistakes.",
        "Mrs. Kowalski: Mr. Manning? Oh, I'm glad you could make it.",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "Starr: Ms. Kowalski, am I in some type of trouble?",
        "Mrs. Kowalski: No, of course not, Starr. Don't you think you'd know?",
        "Starr: Then why would you invite my parents?",
        "Todd: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Watch your tone. So why would you invite me?",
        "Mrs. Kowalski: I'm sure you're aware you're something of a local celebrity.",
        "Langston: Told you.",
        "Mrs. Kowalski: I wonder if you'd be willing to speak to my class about your harrowing experience with the criminal justice system.",
        "Todd: Oh, you mean what it feels like to be put to death for something you didn't do?",
        "Mrs. Kowalski: Yes. I'm sure it would be very illuminating.",
        "Todd: Well, I think high school's harrowing enough, don't you?",
        "Mrs. Kowalski: Huh",
        "Todd: Uh -- no. I appreciate the offer, but I just think it's something that the kids don't need to hear about at this age.",
        "Mrs. Kowalski: Oh. Oh, ok, all right. I understand. I'm disappointed, but I certainly understand. Shall we go inside, ladies?",
        "Starr: Hmm.",
        "Todd: Have a good day, ladies.",
        "Starr: Thanks, dad.",
        "Todd: Sure thing, kiddo.",
        "Langston: Your dad is so cool.",
        "Starr: Sometimes. Other times, being his daughter can be exhausting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: If I prove I was set up, the boxing commission will reinstate me. Abbott will be the one without a license.",
        "Vincent: And then what? You can't fight with that bad hand.",
        "Cristian: Oh, come on, man. I just went 10 rounds with the guy. It's sore. It's not permanent.",
        "Vincent: Vega? Seriously, man, look at it. Do you want to wind up painting with your teeth? Come on, man. Do something else with yourself.",
        "Cristian: I had endorsement deals lined up, Vincent. Sponsors were calling me. This was supposed to be my ticket.",
        "Vincent: Well, your ticket's been punched. You have the stench of a cheater now.",
        "Cristian: You're not listening. I was going to use that money to buy a gym. I was thinking of buying Rourke's, actually.",
        "Vincent: There are -- there are other ways to do that, Vega.",
        "Cristian: Hey, not -- nobody's going to want to train with a guy who took a dive.",
        "Vincent: Vega, I'm sorry. I really am sorry, but the fact is your career -- it's over. I lost out the same as you.",
        "Cristian: No, no. A lot of kids believed in me. I'm not going to let this go. I can't let this go.",
        "Vincent: So what do you want to do? Tell me -- what do you want to do? The boxing commission already examined Abbott's gloves. They found nothing. I'm going to have to cut my losses.",
        "Cristian: Well, wait a minute -- what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Vincent: I'm a businessman, Vega, and you know that. And you're no longer a marketable commodity, so consider our contract dissolved.",
        "Cristian: Ok, fine. Then I'll have to clear my name on my own.",
        "Vincent: I hope you do.",
        "Evangeline: Hey. Hey. Forget him. Forget everybody that doesn't believe in you, ok? I'm still here, and I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, is there anything at all that we can do to make you feel any better?",
        "Natalie: John was the love of my life.",
        "Clint: Natalie, I know you feel that way now, but you've got so much of your life ahead of you. Now, I'm not giving you the \"move on\" speech. It's just that I don't want to see you throw yourself --",
        "Natalie: On John's coffin? I'm -- I'm sorry, dad. I don't know what I'm saying.",
        "Viki: Hey. As long as you know that we're with you, ok? We do know how you feel. Unfortunately, this family has dealt with an awful lot of devastation.",
        "Kevin: We're still dealing with it. Come here, kiddo. I'm so sorry. I know what you're going through. I mean, it's been months since I lost Duke, but it feels like it was yesterday. And, you know, the pain -- it never goes away, but with time, you learn to deal with it. It -- for lack of a better word -- it dulls a bit, I guess.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's bull. Listen to the way you say Duke's name. The pain doesn't dull. It doesn't go anywhere -- not for you, definitely not for me. I'm going to miss John every day for the rest of my life.",
        "Kevin: Well, I'm not saying you're not going to miss him.",
        "Natalie: Stop preaching to me, ok, Kevin? I mean, my God, you drank yourself silly after Duke's death. Talk about jumping into someone's grave.",
        "Kelly: Natalie, Kevin's just trying to help. I am so sorry. He just told me about what happened on the way over here. I am so sorry.",
        "Natalie: God, I'm sorry. I know. I know you're trying. I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm glad you guys are together.",
        "Kelly: Well, we're -- we're not, but I just -- I just want you to know that if there's anything at all that I can do --",
        "Natalie: Can you bring John back?",
        "Kelly: No. I wish I could.",
        "Clint: You know, sweetheart, we loved John because you loved him. I want you to know that you're not alone, and we're here to help you. Let us shoulder some of the hurt.",
        "Natalie: I don't know. Maybe I don't need as much space as I thought I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: Hey, Starr.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Girl: My dad was going to sue your dad for attacking him at parents' night, but he knows how to control his temper, not being a psychopath and all.",
        "Starr: What's your point?",
        "Girl: You're not in middle school anymore. Here, you're either in or you're out.",
        "Second girl: What she means is you're not Britney squad material.",
        "Starr: I'm heartbroken.",
        "Langston: Yeah, because I want to be just like Brit the snit -- or is it Brit the --",
        "Girl: Anybody ever tell you you're a walking fashion don't?",
        "Langston: At least I don't look like an explosion in an ice cream parlor.",
        "Girl: Freak.",
        "Langston: Bitch!",
        "Starr: Stop it, guys. We don't want any trouble.",
        "Girl: Way too late for that.",
        "Starr: Ok, and, Britney, just for the record, we would rather drink bleach than join your little bat squad.",
        "Britney: Bat squad?",
        "Langston: You heard her. Now go hang from the rafters somewhere else.",
        "Britney: You little --",
        "Starr: You better back off, Britney. I am warning you. I am just like my dad and I don't take crap from anybody.",
        "Britney: Let's go, girls.",
        "Starr: Great. High school sucks already.",
        "Langston: Because of those little twits? You could take them, no problem.",
        "Starr: You're right. And if Brit wants a war, she's got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Um -- thanks for the offer, but I can't work two club gigs at the same time. I like to see daylight once in a while.",
        "Rex: I hear you.",
        "Layla: Ok, you two are starting to talk alike. You know that, right?",
        "Adriana: There's no way I can have you be my boss.",
        "Rex: Yeah. You usually do the bossing.",
        "Adriana: That's right, so enough chitchat. Is there anything left in the car?",
        "Rex: Back to sherpa duty.",
        "Adriana: I'm sorry.",
        "Rex: No, no. There's no reason to apologize. Uh -- I love carrying your entire life up four flights of stairs.",
        "Adriana: Do you hate me?",
        "Rex: Well, I hate that you're not moving in with me. I like waking up with you in the morning.",
        "Adriana: So do I.",
        "Rex: Well, then change your mind. I love you. I want us to be together -- not just some nights, all the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I meant what I said, you know. I'm not going to stop until I clear my name.",
        "Evangeline: Of course.",
        "Cristian: And you're ok with this?",
        "Evangeline: What are you talking about?",
        "Cristian: You know, my situation.",
        "Evangeline: Cris, I told you how I feel. Don't insult me by suggesting I would cut my losses like Vincent Jones. I haven't lost a damn thing. I still have you. And all I care about is you being happy. So where do we start?",
        "Cristian: Abbott.",
        "Evangeline: Abbott.",
        "Cristian: His people -- I mean, they were the only ones with access to Abbott's gloves after the ref checked them out.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, you think they were all in on it?",
        "Cristian: Maybe. All I know is that I'm going to go through them one by one until I get someone to admit it. These are good.",
        "Todd: Hmm, well, good luck with that.",
        "Cristian: What do you want, Manning?",
        "Todd: I don't know, I was just passing through, really. Hi.",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Todd: Hey, I'm sorry about John. I know you cared a lot about him. He was a good man, wasn't he -- ahem -- for a cop. He certainly helped save my life.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you for writing that article about Cristian.",
        "Cristian: A lot of good it did.",
        "Todd: I dug around and asked a few questions. I don't know, after that commission's report --",
        "Cristian: They're wrong.",
        "Todd: Ah, yeah. Sure they're wrong. Good luck proving that one.",
        "Evangeline: Todd, you didn't find anything at all we can use?",
        "Todd: Only that whoever bet against Cristian made a lot of money -- including me.",
        "Shaun: You really getting out of the fight game?",
        "Vincent: I'm done with it, man. The commission ruled that Vega threw that fight. My boxing reputation is just as trashed as his.",
        "Shaun: Find a new boy, start from scratch.",
        "Vincent: No, I'm over it, man. It's too much effort -- you know, no guaranteed return on my investment?",
        "Shaun: Vega's a good dude. He deserved better.",
        "Vincent: When did you go and get yourself a conscience?",
        "Shaun: We've known each other since we were kids, right?",
        "Vincent: Mm-hmm.",
        "Shaun: And you've been very clear about what's right and what's wrong.",
        "Vincent: Where is this going, Shaun?",
        "Shaun: Nowhere. Just I know you feel bad about what happened to Vega, too.",
        "Todd: Well, you should. You're the one who set him up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's ok, Bree. Everybody's just a little sad.",
        "Kelly: Can I hold her? I need the practice.",
        "Jessica: Oh, sure. Of course you can. Oh, she's got my necklace.",
        "Kelly: Hi. Come here. Hello! Such a pretty girl.",
        "Jessica: You know, I have a bottle in the fridge if you want to feed her.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, I'd love that. You hungry? Want to go see what we have in the fridge? Ok.",
        "Natalie: Thanks.",
        "Viki: Here you go.",
        "Natalie: Look at you guys, circling the wagon.",
        "Clint: We, when one of our own's in trouble, that's what we tend to do.",
        "Natalie: I mean, I appreciate it, mom, but there's nothing anyone can do to fix this.",
        "Viki: It's all right. We don't mind just sitting here.",
        "Natalie: That's what Roxy and Rex did last night. It helped for a little while, but then after they left, it just all came back to me. That's why I didn't come home. You know, it's still kind of hard, juggling two families, two support systems even though they're very different.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, I keep on trying to think of something to say to you, but everything that I can think of just seems so clich\u00e9 and trivial. I'm sorry.",
        "Natalie: You know what? I know you guys are worried about me, but I'm -- I'm going to be fine. I just have to deal with this. John's gone, and there's nothing that anybody can do.",
        "Viki: Well, we can listen.",
        "Natalie: Actually, um, there is something that you should know about John's death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: Ok. My eyes.",
        "Adriana: Sorry.",
        "Layla: Dude, we got to figure out a signal.",
        "Rex: It's my fault. I ambushed her.",
        "Layla: Ok, it's all good. I'm going for a walk while you two get busy and I'll bring back some more -- coffee, ok? Have fun.",
        "Rex: Want to break in the new bedroom?",
        "Adriana: Wait -- listen. I don't know what else to say to make you understand why I'm doing this.",
        "Rex: I know. No nuns, no Dorian, no me.",
        "Adriana: It's not personal. I love you, but moving in together -- it's a really big deal, at least it is to me.",
        "Rex: Well, for me, too. I don't go around asking random women to move in with me.",
        "Adriana: Ok, so it's a big commitment, and I'm not saying no. I'm just saying that I need some time to figure out who Adriana is before I become Adriana and Rex. Do you get that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Before the accident, John had called me. He asked me to save a date, that he had something special planned for us. He sounded so happy, you know, like he was at peace? You know, I've never heard him that way before. It's just like the edge was out of his voice.",
        "Jessica: Because he found his father's killer?",
        "Natalie: It's like all the demons were gone. Just seemed like he was ready to live his life.",
        "Natalie: You know, he spent his whole life torturing himself. And the minute he gets his life back, it's over.",
        "Viki: You know, darling, I've always believed that God knows from the moment we're born exactly how many days we have. And there's really nothing we can do change that. That's how I got through losing Ben. I just held on to that.",
        "Kevin: You see, you just have to find out what works for you -- you know, how you get from one moment to the next, and then you -- you just do that.",
        "Natalie: You know what? All of you have been through so much, I don't want to dump on you.",
        "Clint: Oh, Natalie, why not? That's what families are for. And if you want to yell, go ahead. Believe me, all of us here can take it.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, it'll make me feel like I was doing something to help.",
        "Natalie: Me crying?",
        "Jessica: Well, yeah, letting it out. I know you, Natalie. I know that you're keeping it all bottled up and it's got to go somewhere.",
        "Natalie: You know what? I know that in my head. But ever since I heard the news, I just feel dead inside. Without John, I don't know that I'm ever going to feel alive again.",

        "Evangeline: What are you doing?",
        "Cristian: Throwing out the garbage.",
        "Evangeline: Your paints?",
        "Cristian: Well, I can't paint, can't box.",
        "Evangeline: Let me see.",
        "Cristian: I'm fine.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian, let me see. This thing isn't doing any good.",
        "Cristian: I'm fine.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian? Maybe you should take some of those pain meds that your doctor prescribed.",
        "Cristian: No, no pills.",
        "Evangeline: Cristian --",
        "Cristian: Pain reminds me of why I'm so pissed off.",
        "Evangeline: What, you think you'd forget?",
        "Cristian: You heard Vincent bail on me. And Manning -- gloating about how much money he made betting against me. I tell you, one of these days -- I could've wrung his neck.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. You and me both. But he did write that article about you in the paper, and Vincent is right about one thing -- even if you get your license back, you can never fight again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: It's real reckless of a newspaperman like yourself to throw around unfounded accusations.",
        "Todd: Well, not really unfounded there, Vince. I -- I know you made it look like Cristian threw that fight.",
        "Vincent: I wouldn't sabotage my own fighter.",
        "Todd: You would if it was enough money.",
        "Shaun: You want me to get rid of him, Vincent?",
        "Todd: No. Easy there, my brother from another mother. All right. I overheard your man, Ted -- that his name? -- Talking about the fight before the fight and I know that he bet a huge amount of money against Vega and now he's going all over town spending it.",
        "Vincent: Is that so?",
        "Todd: That is so. Why don't you guys get me a muffin and a nice cup of coffee and I'll tell you all about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I get where you're coming from. It's just I have basically been on my own since day one, so it's kind of hard to relate.",
        "Adriana: Well, put yourself in my shoes.",
        "Rex: Yeah, ok. No, it -- it's great, actually. I love that you're not needy.",
        "Adriana: Except when I'm being chased by fake stalkers.",
        "Rex: You're not boring.",
        "Adriana: Boring would be nice, for a while at least.",
        "Rex: Can you keep a toothbrush at my place, at least?",
        "Adriana: I think that's a great idea.",
        "Rex: Yeah. I have another great idea. Layla's going to be out for a while. Why don't we christen this place?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. That's a fabulous idea.",
        "Rex: Nah, we got to go room by room, starting with this one.",
        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I'm sick and tired of people telling me and reminding me of all the things that I can't do! I know, ok? I can't do the things I love. I can't even support myself right now.",
        "Evangeline: Will you stop it? Will you stop beating up on yourself? We're going to find out who did this to you. It's just boxing, ok? Your life isn't over. I'm sorry. Sorry.",
        "Cristian: No, I'm sorry. I'm being selfish.",
        "Evangeline: No, no. You're not.",
        "Cristian: You know, I wouldn't mind running it by him. He always managed to find an angle like I hadn't thought of. It saved our lives in prison.",
        "Evangeline: You saved each other's lives.",
        "Cristian: If it hadn't been for you and John, I'd still be rotting in jail.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, he didn't give up, especially when it came to finding out who killed his father. He wanted justice. Justice and Natalie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You make any money off of Vega? Did they leave you out of the loop on this one?",
        "Vincent: Why don't you just start talking, Manning.",
        "Todd: And you, sir -- did you make any money off of Vega?",
        "Vincent: I don't know where you get your information from, but for the love of God, would you just please --",
        "Layla: Hey.",
        "Vincent: Hey, sugar bear. Hey. What's up? Hi.",
        "Layla: I'm good.",
        "Vincent: What are you doing here?",
        "Layla: I'm getting coffee. And what are you three so intense about?",
        "Vincent: Oh, well, Mr. Manning over here -- he's a Giants' fan.",
        "Layla: Uh -- in Eagles' territory? Blasphemy.",
        "Todd: Hi, Layla.",
        "Vincent: So I thought you were busy moving all day.",
        "Layla: Oh, well, we're done. How about you come over for dinner later and you check it out?",
        "Vincent: Oh, I'd like that.",
        "Layla: Me, too. And you? Get with the program.",
        "Todd: I wonder how she'd feel if she knew you set her sister's boyfriend up to take a fall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I can't believe we have an essay due tomorrow.",
        "Starr: Oh I know. I hate Miss Ringout.",
        "Langston: Hey, watch where you're going.",
        "Britney: Did somebody say something?",
        "Girl: I didn't hear anything.",
        "Second girl: Me, neither.",
        "Starr: This is going to get old real quick.",
        "Langston: Those girls need to be taught a lesson.",
        "Starr: I think I'm just going to keep my head down.",
        "Langston: Since when?",
        "Starr: Since now.",
        "Langston: Now that's what I'm talking about.",
        "Starr: Ew, those football guys? Please -- they're totally into team Britney.",
        "Langston: Only because they haven't met us yet. If we hooked up with them --",
        "Starr: Britney's head would explode.",
        "Langston: Sounds like a plan. Come on. This'll be fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I really need to get rid of this stuff. Just let things settle first. This part of my life is done. Just staring at it -- I'll give it to the love center. The kids will use it.",
        "Evangeline: Not today, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: Well, I -- I don't want to stand around here staring at it.",
        "Evangeline: Well, would say we could go back to my house, but Layla's there, she's moving out. He'd just -- I don't want to deal with all that chaos.",
        "Cristian: Or the memories.",
        "Evangeline: That part of my life is over. I'm with you now -- completely, which means you have to do what I say. And I say you are not throwing your painting supplies away.",
        "Cristian: It just reminds me that I can't do it anymore.",
        "Evangeline: I know. But whether you go back to painting or not, you're going to rebuild your life. And I'm going to help you. I'm going to be here every single day reminding you of the kind of man you are. No matter how hard you fight me, you are not done.",
        "Cristian: What would I do without you?",
        "Evangeline: You're never going to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Manning, you're fishing, man. You -- you got nothing on me.",
        "Todd: Relax, Vince. I'm not a big Vega fan, either. I bet against him, too. Made a lot of money, actually. I loved seeing his face hit that mat.",
        "Vincent: That's because you're hot for his woman.",
        "Todd: All right, now let's -- let's table that while Layla's around, ok?",
        "Layla: So, call me before you me, ok? I'm going to go check on Evangeline. You know, she -- John's death really hit her hard.",
        "Vincent: You offer her my sympathies, ok?",
        "Layla: I will, babe. I'll see you later. Bye. Did you even hear about Hugh?",

        "Layla: You know, that's just wrong.",
        "Todd: You should read \"The Sun\" more often.",
        "Layla: He made it, actually, and he's in a burn unit in some hospital in Atlantic City.",
        "Todd: Yeah, apparently he looks like a piece of charcoal.",

        "Kelly: You ok?",
        "Kevin: Yeah. Every time I see you with Bree, I just think about Ace.",

        "Kelly: Oh, I can't wait to hold my baby in my arms, even if --",
        "Kevin: Now, can we just -- let's just try to get past that, ok?",
        "Kelly: You think you can?",
        "Kevin: Oh. I don't know. It was Truman's fault -- he set us up. Duke's dead because of him, but we can't stop living.",
        "Kelly: No. No, we can't. Every time I feel my baby move inside of me, it's so real. It's Duke. It's part of him.",
        "Kevin: And that's a very precious thing.",
        "Kelly: I'm glad to hear you say that.",

        "Kelly: I want to be surprised.",
        "Natalie: Too bad he'll never get to know his father.",
        "Clint: Yeah, he or she will know because we're going to tell her all about Duke.",
        "Natalie: You know, and I'm going to tell him or her about Uncle John, what a good man he was, how brave, how loyal, make sure that Marcie and Michael's little boy knows, too, and Bree. That way, John will never be forgotten.",
        "Jessica: He wouldn't be, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: But I'm already -- I'm already losing him in my mind. You know, sometimes I can hear his voice in my head and then there are other times where he's nowhere.",
        "Viki: You will never forget what's important, I promise you that.",
        "Natalie: I didn't tell you about something important. Um -- after the accident, I found out that when John was done visiting his father's grave, that he was going to ask me to marry him.",

        "Rex: I want you to do your thing -- find your life, get even with your mom, whatever. Just as long as we don't lose this, really the only thing that matters to me.",

        "Langston: So, I hear you guys have a big blowout after the game, win or lose.",
        "Boy: Location T.B.A. as soon as we find out whose parents won't be home. Invites only, though.",
        "Langston: Do you know Starr Manning?",
        "Boy: Manning?",
        "Langston: Her dad owns \"The Sun.\"",
        "Boy: Oh, the dude that got juiced by the state and --",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Boy: Came back to life, yeah.",
        "Starr: The guy who was framed and then wrongly executed for a crime he didn't commit?",
        "Boy: Cool, huh.",
        "Langston: Hmm.",
        "Boy: Here, give me your cell and I'll let you know where the party is.",
        "Langston: Um, I'll put her number in your phone.",

        "Layla: Ok, that's harsh.",
        "Todd: Well, he got me sentenced to death for something I didn't do. Honestly, I hope he dies very slowly in immense pain.",
        "Vincent: You know, I really dig where you're coming from because I wasn't a big fan of John McBain.",
        "Todd: Oh, now, Vince, Curly, let's not say a disparaging word about John McBain while I'm in the house, all right?",
        "Vincent: Then you just shut up about Hugh.",
        "Layla: Ok. Ok, ok. Boys? This whole thing was a tragedy and it's not about you. So I will see you later. Relax.",
        "Todd: You're really into her, aren't you?",
        "Vincent: So?",
        "Todd: So you lay off me or I tell her what you did to Vega.",

        "Viki: That's so sad, honey.",
        "Jessica: Hi, sweet.",
