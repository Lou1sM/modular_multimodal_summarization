        "Vincent: Vega, Vega, Vega, just the man I need to see. We need to talk serious business.",
        "Cristian: Looks like you're not here to tell me the boxing commission took back their decision.",
        "Vincent: Nope. I'm here to give you a warning.",
        "Cristian: About what? Finding out who drugged me so it'd look like I threw the match?",
        "Vincent: Correct.",
        "Cristian: And why shouldn't I look into it? I mean, we're talking about a crime here, not to mention that my reputation is ruined. That I have no career. I am done.",
        "Vincent: You need to let this go, my friend. And I mean now. And that's not a suggestion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't like that look on your face. You read your horoscope and you didn't like it?",
        "Evangeline: I read \"the sun\" online every day. When I saw today's edition, it was so unbelievable, I went straight to the newsstand to get the hard copy. I just had to make sure my computer wasn't playing tricks on me.",
        "Todd: Are you saying that you liked the editorial, or --",
        "Evangeline: I loved it.",
        "Todd: I'm touched.",
        "Evangeline: You going to tell me what it means?",
        "Todd: Did you -- well, I don't understand that question.",
        "Evangeline: I know you were grateful to him for what he did for you, but I just -- I have to wonder why. Why would you write a posthumous love letter to John Mc Bain?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: More flowers?",
        "Antonio: Yeah. The desk Sarge said three dozen arrangements. It's the most he's ever seen.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm not surprised. Because John touched a lot of lives -- people that we don't even know about. Not to mention, the ones we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: We'll make limos available to transport the immediate family from the church to the cemetery. You shouldn't have to worry about transportation at a time like this.",
        "Michael: It's appreciated.",
        "Man: Well, have you thought about flowers for the service?",
        "Michael: I don't think that John would have wanted a lot of flowers. I mean, he really wasn't a flower type of guy. What do you think, mom? Mom?",
        "Eve: Oh -- oh, gosh, I'm -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Michael: Flowers?",
        "Eve: Oh, flowers?",
        "Michael: We were talking about flowers.",
        "Eve: Um -- simple. Minimal. Nothing fussy, I think.",
        "Man: Something like this on either side of the casket?",
        "Michael: Yeah. I -- I think that looks all right.",
        "Marcie: I think they're lovely. Don't you think so?",
        "Eve: They'll be just fine.",
        "Man: Good. We'll take care of it. Now, did you bring pictures for the photo display that we discussed?",
        "Michael: We did. Um -- but we haven't had an opportunity to pick any out.",
        "Man: You can take all the time you want.",
        "Eve: Thank you, Mr. Eldleson. You've been very kind.",
        "Mr. Eldleson: Now, just a few more details to take care of. Now, did lieutenant Mc Bain have children?",
        "Michael: No, he -- he didn't have a family of his own yet. Natalie?",
        "Natalie: What about me? Do I count as family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Has he regained consciousness at all?",
        "Betty: Not really. I think he's aware, but he's just too sick to let us know that.",
        "Kelly: Is it ok if I sit with him for a while?",
        "Betty: Yes, of course. Here. You have a chair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: What the hell's wrong with you, Vincent? Whoever set me up to take that fall -- they made us both look bad. And I guarantee you, it was one of Abbott's people.",
        "Vincent: Listen, man, I get it. I really do. But keeping at this is not going to help either one of our reputations.",
        "Cristian: Why are you saying this? You know something?",
        "Vincent: The longer you keep at this, the longer you keep digging, the longer this is going to stay high profile in the public eye. And that's not going to do anybody any good.",
        "Cristian: So this is the way you do business, mr. Jones? Your client gets set up, so you tell him to drop it so you can save face?",
        "Vincent: What I'm saying is, in this case, the less said is better for everyone concerned.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but if I don't find out who set me up, that means I'm out of the game. Which means I can't box anymore. And that is not an option.",
        "Vincent: You can't fight with one hand, anyway.",
        "Cristian: That's not the point here.",
        "Vincent: It damn well is! Move on! Forget it! Get a new life!",
        "Cristian: You can't possibly think I'm buying any of this crap.",
        "Vincent: What do you think, Vega? You think I got time to come around here, just to shine on you, you know, for my own little personal enjoyment? No, I don't think so.",
        "Cristian: You're trying to stop me from getting to the bottom of what happened to me. I want to know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I got to get out of here.",
        "Antonio: Commissioner, is there -- is there anything I can do?",
        "Bo: Thanks, Antonio, but this can't be fixed.",
        "Antonio: Yeah. My eyes are watering -- I can't do this in front of the guys. You know, it's -- it's -- it's one thing, you know, losing one of ours, but -- John was our friend, you know, and he was not just another cop, he was one of the best cops I'd ever -- I'd ever m. It wasn't supposed to go down this way. It's not fair.",
        "Bo: No. No, it's not. And it never is. It's always one of the good guys. You know, John's gone. Spencer Truman, perfectly healthy, sitting in a cell right now, trying to figure out how to get away with murder. And you know something? He might do it.",
        "Antonio: No. No way. We're not going to let that happen.",
        "Bo: I hope not -- for John's sake, for Michael's sake. I mean, this whole -- it's just -- it's wrong. John finally got a fresh start. He solved his father's murder. He answered the biggest question of his life, and -- what a time to lose him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Natalie, of course you're family. We didn't ask you to come here with us because we thought -- we thought that it would be too difficult for you.",
        "Natalie: Why would it be any more difficult for me to plan John's funeral than his brother, or his mother?",
        "Marcie: We're -- we're sorry. You know, we -- we should have let you decide for yourself if you wanted to be a part of this.",
        "Natalie: Eve, are you all right?",
        "Eve: Natalie, please stay. You belong here.",
        "Natalie: So is everything done?",
        "Eve: No.",
        "Michael: No. And we could really use your help.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Hi. Natalie Buchanan.",
        "Mr. Eldleson: Richard Eldleson. I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Buchanan.",
        "Natalie: Me, too. I -- I was going to be John's wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: John's one of the reasons I'm sitting here with you right now. He helped save my ass twice last year.",
        "Evangeline: He saved a lot of lives -- including mine.",
        "Todd: Wasn't an easy guy to like, though, was he?",
        "Evangeline: Kind of like you.",
        "Todd: I wouldn't break your heart.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah?",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Evangeline: Well, that's the risk you take when you love someone.",
        "Todd: Who are we talking about?",
        "Evangeline: John and I.",
        "Todd: Oh. John and you.",
        "Evangeline: We had gotten past all that. We were -- we were -- we were friends. Going to miss him.",
        "Todd: I know.",
        "Evangeline: He really was a good guy, wasn't he?",
        "Todd: He was a great guy. Huh. And he never compromised when it comes to seeking out the truth. Except, of course, when he failed to tell Natalie that her husband was still alive and in prison.",
        "Evangeline: You know, it sounds like something you would do.",
        "Todd: Nobody's perfect. Ain't too many cats like John Mc Bain, I can tell you that.",
        "Evangeline: Really, Todd. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Don't you listen? I already explained to you why I need you to drop this. But what you don't seem to get is the fact that this is not all about you.",
        "Cristian: Oh, I think it is.",
        "Vincent: Vega, I was your manager. I got you a title fight, which means I'm guilty by association. And I can't have that. I hope you understand me. I got a business to run. And the last thing I need from you is bad P.R.",
        "Cristian: So this is how you stand by your clients?",
        "Vincent: Vega, man, I swear, I really wish things could be different. But the fact is, it is what it is. And you can't change that. You need to accept that and move on and do what's best for everyone concerned, understood?",
        "Cristian: Excuse me.",
        "Vincent: Vega, where are you going? This is your place.",
        "Cristian: You really think I got anything else to lose? Lock the door when you go. You know what? Forget about it. I really don't give a damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Todd and I are just talking, Blair. Privately.",
        "Blair: Oh, I could see that. But see, Todd came here to talk to me about our kids, and, well -- um -- we could actually use a little privacy ourselves. I mean, that is, if you don't mind.",
        "Evangeline: I have to get to the police station, anyway, so I'm going to leave you alone, ok? It's always interesting, Blair.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you.",
        "Todd: Glad you like it.",
        "Blair: Hmm. Well, I read your editorial, too.",
        "Todd: Ahem. Yeah, it made Evangeline really happy. I like making her happy.",
        "Blair: Thanks for agreeing to meet me. I thought it would be best if we met on some neutral territory.",
        "Todd: Are we dividing up the spoils or something?",
        "Blair: We're just going to figure out where jack and starr are going to live, and I just thought it would be a good idea if we were civil.",
        "Todd: I want to share custody, period.",
        "Blair: Well, that's not going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Hey.",
        "Paige: Kelly.",
        "Kelly: Uhuh?-H hi. Um --",
        "Paige: Hi.",
        "Kelly: I just -- I stopped by to see how he was doing.",
        "Paige: Oh.",
        "Kelly: We -- we were getting close.",
        "Paige: I -- I know what you mean. It's the exact same for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Nat, honey, you're as much a part of John's family as anybody here. We should have included you. We're sorry that we didn't.",
        "Natalie: No, I don't feel excluded, I just don't really know what I'm supposed to do.",
        "Eve: None of us do, sweetie.",
        "Natalie: Actually, I'd like to know what you guys are planning for tomorrow. I'm not really sure why.",
        "Michael: Well -- um -- we're not finished yet, but so far, we have an honor guard from the L.P.D., bagpipes, and a photo display so that, you know, people can see John on their way in and their way out.",
        "Natalie: Flowers?",
        "Michael: Yeah. But nothing too big, you know? Simple, understated.",
        "Natalie: Good. He's not the type, you know. Wow, there's a lot to think about, isn't there?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Richard: As a matter of fact, there is one more thing you have to decide, and it's perhaps the most difficult.",
        "Eve: What is it?",
        "Richard: You need to decide on the casket you'd like lieutenant Mc Bain buried in.",
        "Michael: Natalie? I think you should decide this. You know John better than anybody here, and I think that you'd know what he'd like.",
        "Natalie: Ok. I'll choose the casket.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Thank you.",
        "Bo: I'll see you later.",
        "Antonio: All right, Commish, and listen, I'd -- I'd like to help any way I can. I mean, I'll take John's caseload, I'll split it with the guys in homicide -- whatever you want.",
        "Bo: All right, thank you. We'll -- I'll talk to you about that.",
        "Antonio: Is it ok if I -- if I handle the -- the police detail for the funeral?",
        "Bo: I'd appreciate that. The men have been asking.",
        "Antonio: It'd be an honor.",
        "Bo: You know, I talked to Michael a while ago, and he and his mother are making arrangements with the funeral director with the church. They're going to use his father's church in Atlantic City. And John will be buried next to his father.",
        "Antonio: John would have wanted that.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Come in.",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Bo: Hi.",
        "Evangeline: Um -- I'm sorry to interrupt. It's -- well, it's a bit urgent.",
        "Bo: Ok.",
        "Antonio: Well, I'll let you two talk.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Antonio: All right.",
        "Evangeline: Thanks, Antonio.",
        "Bo: What can I do for you, Evangeline?",
        "Evangeline: I need to talk to you about John's office, and what we might find there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Sorry. I -- I brought some stuff for him. Some -- some cards and a picture -- it's outside. I'm -- it's from the kids that he coaches on his soccer team, the -- the D.A. Dawgz -- d-a-w-g-Z.",
        "Paige: Oh. I -- I didn't know he was a coach.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I saw him in the park one day and he was with a bunch of kids. And they're just crazy about him, and he was crazy about them.",
        "Paige: I bet he's great with kids.",
        "Kelly: He is, he is. It took me a while to track down the parents, but the kids are just nuts for him, and they really -- really are pulling for him, and they want him to get better. They -- they asked if he will be back next year to coach. Sorry.",
        "Paige: No, it's ok. I -- I want to learn everything I can about him.",
        "Kelly: How long have you known that he's your son?",
        "Paige: Actually, several months, but I just told him a few weeks ago. I might not have told him, except that he was about to prosecute his own father for murder. But I -- I'm glad I told him. I just -- I wanted to get to know him. I would see him at the police station, and I would be so proud because he's so successful. But at the same time, it -- it would break my heart. I wish I'd told him sooner. We could have -- could have had more time together. There's -- there's so many things I want to know. There's so much I want to ask him.",
        "Kelly: He's going to -- he's going to pull through this. He's going to make it. He's tough.",
        "Paige: Thank you.",
        "Kelly: After I found out I was pregnant, Hugh found me in the park and I was in really bad shape, and he -- I told him. I don't know why, but I just trusted him. He calmed me down. And he made me feel like -- like this baby was something I should celebrate, and that it was really a miracle. I wasn't sure I could do any of this, but he made me feel like I could. And I don't know what I would have done if he hadn't been there that day. Your son is a beautiful, beautiful man.",
        "Paige: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So John was a very complicated man, but his taste was very simple. You know, he -- he was honest and brave. Very real. So if you've got something like that it'll work.",
        "Michael: Um -- I think maybe this was a mistake.",
        "Natalie: No, I want to do this.",
        "Richard: How about this one?",
        "Natalie: Wait, this one -- this one right here. It's simple. He'd love that.",
        "Richard: I'll have it taken care of.",
        "Natalie: I -- I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: I got a call from Michael today. He's -- he's planning the funeral, and he asked to retain me as the family's attorney. They were not able to find a will. I did some research with the probate court, and I couldn't find one, either. And Michael was hoping that maybe John had something written down in his office.",
        "Bo: Well, if you want to check down there, I'll be happy to let you in.",
        "Evangeline: Thank you. Thank you. And actually, I'm -- I'm a bit anxious about going into John's space.",
        "Bo: I understand that. Why don't we do it together?",
        "Evangeline: Ok.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What are you going to do, sue me for full custody? What, you going to have sex with the judge? That is your M.O. these days, isn't it?",
        "Blair: I never said anything about taking you to court, Todd. I just said I'm not going to share custody with you.",
        "Todd: What does that mean, exactly?",
        "Blair: It just means that we're not going to raise our children in separate homes.",
        "Todd: Well, there's no way I'm going to let you have full custody, so I don't really see an alternative.",
        "Blair: Well, that's why I'm here -- to give you one.",
        "Todd: This ought to be good.",
        "Blair: I want to move back into the penthouse with you and the kids. I want our life to be the way that it was supposed to be two years ago. Before Margaret came in and all hell broke loose. Marry me, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Uh -- maybe we should start with the file cabinets over there because if he did have a will, I doubt that he'd leave it lying out on the desk.",
        "Evangeline: John and I used to sit here for hours talking, you know? Sometimes about cases, sometimes about us. Lately, just as friends. There was a time when I thought we could never be friends. It didn't seem possible after everything that happened, you know? But when I started seeing Cristian, I actually told him about it in here, and he was -- he was great. I kind of loved him all over again, you know? In a -- in a new way. God, he would be disgusted with me for being this morose, wouldn't he?",
        "Bo: Yeah, probably. But he probably could have identified with you. You know John.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, John --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Marry you? You're serious?",
        "Blair: I want our life to be the way that it was supposed to be two years before that crazy bitch, Margaret, came in and destroyed our lives!",
        "Todd: You know, the difference is, the Margaret thing just happened. Nothing we can do about it. But you jumping in the sack with Spencer -- you did that on purpose. I mean, Margaret may have gotten this ball rolling, but you've kept it going, I'll tell you.",
        "Blair: What about what happened at the penthouse? When we made love? Are you telling me that --",
        "Todd: That was a mistake.",
        "Blair: Didn't mean anything?",
        "Todd: Can never hap--",
        "Blair: No, it wasn't, Todd. It was inevitable, just like we're inevitable. And if you weren't so angry all the time, you could see, and really look at me. I'm your family. Me and the kids, and we are the only place where you belong. I mean, if you would just stop looking in the past all the time and look into the future, you could see that we could have everything we ever wanted, Todd. We could have the life that people have been trying to take away from us. Listen to me. We could -- we could have each other.",
        "Todd: And what if I don't want you anymore?",
        "Blair: I'd say you were a liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Cristian, I'm just not -- I wasn't paying attention.",
        "Cristian: You ok?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I was just at the funeral home with John's family -- ahem -- trying to make a decision about John's body.",
        "Cristian: Wow. I'm sorry. That must have been tough. Look, is there anything I can do?",
        "Natalie: No, no. No, there's nothing anyone can do. That much I remember.",
        "Cristian: Well, I can call someone for you -- your mom.",
        "Natalie: I just needed some fresh air, you know? Because that place, the funeral home, smells like flowers. You know, John is in a place that smells like flowers. He would hate that. My God, Cristian, this sucks! None of this makes -- it makes no sense. This makes no sense.",
        "Natalie: I just want to be alone right now, ok?",
        "Vincent: I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Just give it up, Blair. It's not going to work. I'm immune.",
        "Blair: Ok, Todd, you just keep on fighting. Keep on insulting me, day in and day out, doing all the mean and nasty things that you've been doing for years, to chase away what you really want. I know you're afraid to reach out and grab what you want, because you're afraid it's going to disappear. But I'm telling you right now, I am here, Todd. And I'm not going to go anywhere. I am there for you, now and always. And if me telling you how I really feel is not good enough, well, I'm just -- I'm just -- I'm going to have to raise the stakes.",
        "Todd: Yeah? What's that going to look like?",

Because this baby inside me -- he or she needs to know you. I'm going to come back and see you real soon. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I -- I know what you must be going through. I had a son who -- he's going to be ok, I just know it. I just know it. I believe it. I do.",
        "Paige: I am a doctor and I see the reality of the situation. I know his chances aren't good. But the mother in me -- the -- the mother that I didn't really even know was inside me -- that part of me believes he's going to get better. He -- he just has to get better.",

        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Eve: Yeah.",
        "Richard: There's still the matter of the photo display. I know it might seem too painful to look at them now, but from my experience, people usually get some comfort from those memories. Once you've decided, you can bring the pictures to my office. I'll take it from there.",
        "Michael: Thank you. Thank you very much. Mom?",

        "Bo: It must be John with his dad.",
        "Evangeline: Well, they're together now. You know, people didn't think that John was sentimental, but he was. He kept that picture right here in this desk where he sat every day.",

        "Vincent: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about John.",
        "Natalie: No, you're not. You couldn't even stand him.",
        "Vincent: I didn't know him. Besides, the way I feel doesn't make any difference. The man is gone. Your heart is broken. I'd be pissed off, too.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God -- who cares, Vincent?",
        "Vincent: What, Natalie? You want to take it out on me, go ahead. I'm right here for you. Be my guest. But one thing that I know is that you put yourself on the line for that man. You believed in him enough to risk your own neck for him. Took a lot of slack from him for doing it, too. The truth is, I envy anyone who can have that with another person, even for a little while. And I hope and I pray that the pain that you feel right now one day will be something else. And then, and only then, when you think about John, you'll remember who he was and how much you gave yourself to him while he was here. And maybe someday, the pain you feel -- you'll be lucky enough to have just had the chance to love somebody that much. I'm sorry. I really am.",
