        "Jessica contemplates whether to tell John that he is Liam's father or not. After watching Brody with Liam, she keeps mum. John asks Sam to help him find the man with the line on his face. Jack tells him not to talk to police. He tells Jack to call the police if they hear from Todd. Starr asks James to persuade Jack to tell the truth so the police will drop the charges against Todd. James tells Jack that the police have the murder weapon, the forensics report will match Todd's story and Jack will be in trouble with the police for lying. A news report contradicts James's story. James concedes that it hasn't happened yet, but asserts that it is only a matter of time until it does. Neither Natalie nor Tea believes Tomas's confession to Irene's murder. Tea wants to know Tomas's reason for sacrificing himself for Todd's sake. McBain doesn't believe his confession and asks Tomas to tell him what really happened on the dock. When Tomas refuses, they book him. Natalie gives John the results of blood found at the scene of Irene's murder showing that it came from Todd. Tomas is taken to the cell across from Starr's. Blair finds Todd laying in a pool of blood at Llanfair and concludes that Irene killed him, but he is alive and confirms that Irene was the shooter. He tells her his mother intends to kill everyone he cares about. He doesn't want her to call an ambulance she agrees to clean and dress his wound and calls Dorian for help. Dorian walks her through removing the bullet. Todd doesn't want her to leave."

        "Jessica: Can you really be John McBain's son? According to this piece of paper, you are. But we've believed pieces of paper like this before. But if those really are Natalie's paternity results -- I mean, if there's even a chance that what it says is true, doesn't John deserve to know that this sweet little boy is his son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Sam: Who is it?",
        "John: Hey, Sam. It's John McBain. Can you open up? Hey, buddy, you're up late. Everything okay?",
        "Sam: Am I in trouble?",
        "John: No. No, not at all. I'm actually glad you're on duty, you know? I got a situation on my hands, and I was hoping my best deputy could help me out.",
        "Sam: How?",
        "John: I need to find the man with the line on his face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You want to help me? I need to clear my father's name.",
        "James: Okay, no problem. But how?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey, Brody. I -- I should be home soon. I'm just waiting on the lab results from the blood evidence we picked up from Irene Manning's murder scene. [Scoffs] Yeah, well, I don't think Tom\u00e1s Delgado's confession is gonna hold up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Admit it, Tom\u00e1s. Todd killed his mother, and you're taking the blame.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I told you -- I shot Irene, not Todd. [Exhales sharply]",
        "T\u00e9a: Stop lying to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. Oh, God. Please -- please tell me I'm not too late. [Crying] Oh, God! Oh, my God, he's dead! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Todd, no. Your crazy mother did this to you, didn't she? She killed you. She took you away from us. Oh, my God. What am I gonna tell your kids? Oh, my God. How am I gonna to tell them that their father's dead? [Sobbing]",
        "Todd: [Groans] Don't you go burying me yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: You can come in now.",
        "John: Thanks, buddy. Hey, what's -- what's all this?",
        "Sam: My midnight snack.",
        "John: Yeah? Looks -- looks pretty good. Up. Hey, you're -- you're not taking that to your friend, are you? Remember, you helped him once before when he was hiding.",
        "Sam: Not now. Why is he hiding? Did he really kill my dad?",
        "John: I don't know, Sam. That's what we want to ask him. But first, we have to find him first. Hey. What are these?",
        "Sam: I was gonna give this shark to my dad, but he can't use it.",
        "John: Can I see? Oh, yeah. Sharks are cool.",
        "Sam: Did you know they never sleep?",
        "John: I didn't know that. Probably 'cause they always have to stay alert, right?",
        "Sam: You can have this one. My dad can't use it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I'm gonna drive myself crazy trying to figure out the right thing to do is -- for John, for Brody and Natalie, for me. But the truth, if that's what this is, you know, always has a way of coming out, no matter what. I mean, isn't it better if it comes out sooner rather than later?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Jessica: Brody.",
        "Brody: Sorry, didn't mean to startle you.",
        "Jessica: It's okay. I was just expecting Natalie.",
        "Brody: She's still working that homicide. Off the record?",
        "Jessica: Sure, yeah.",
        "Brody: It was Irene Manning.",
        "Jessica: Irene?",
        "Brody: She was shot. There's some question about Todd's involvement, but we have Tom\u00e1s Delgado in custody.",
        "Jessica: Why?",
        "Brody: He confessed. How's my boy? Come here, huh? Were you good for your Aunt Jessica, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I want you to tell me the truth. You already told me that Todd was on the docks and that Irene shot him.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So?",
        "T\u00e9a: So, you didn't happen to mention that little bit of information to the cops. That makes me -- I don't know -- a little bit suspicious. What happened on those docks? I know there was a confrontation between Irene and Todd. There had to have been. That, I get. What I don't get is why you're covering for him. Natalie. Has John found Todd?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Thank you, buddy. I'm never gonna take this off. It's a great shark.",
        "Sam: I know.",
        "Jack: Sam, who are you talking to? McPain. What are you doing here?",
        "John: Looking for Todd Manning.",
        "Jack: You mean you haven't found him yet? What is wrong with you people?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My father shouldn't have been arrested for Victor's murder in the first place. That's why he had to go after Irene. Irene is the only one that has evidence that could clear his name. But because the cops have him on the run, he has to stay hidden.",
        "James: Okay. So, where does that leave us?",
        "Starr: Well, if you get the murder charges dropped, then my dad can come home safely, and he can figure it out.",
        "James: Look, you know that I'm willing to try anything, but I don't even know where to start with this.",
        "Starr: That's okay. I do. The only witness that the cops have against my dad is Jack, and I know that Jack is lying. Jack is so convinced that my dad killed Victor that he made up this whole story to throw him in jail.",
        "Jack: So, what do you want me to do?",
        "Starr: Get Jack to admit the truth. And I think I know how you can do that.",

        "Blair: Oh, my God. You're alive.",
        "Todd: Quit your screaming. You're gonna give me a heart attack.",
        "Blair: You gave me a heart attack! I thought you were dead!",
        "Todd: Sorry to disappoint you.",
        "Blair: What happened?",
        "Todd: My bitch mother shot me.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. No, don't, don't! Don't move, Todd. I mean, you are really -- you're really, really bleeding here. I'm gonna get something to -- here. Got a couple of pillows. I'm gonna put this --",
        "Todd: Are you kidding? Viki's pillows?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Todd: She's never gonna send you another Christmas card. Ah!",
        "Blair: Sorry. Stop. I've got to stop the bleeding.",
        "Todd: How did you find me?",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s called me. I mean, actually, he --",
        "Todd: Ah!",
        "Blair: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He told me. And there was a -- there was a missed call from Viki's landline on my cell phone, and -- why did you call me? Why didn't you call Viki or T\u00e9a?",
        "Todd: 'Cause you're the one, Blair. You're the one. I know that you care about me.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? I shouldn't. After what you did to Starr, I shouldn't.",
        "Todd: How is Starr?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Well, you should know how she is. She is in jail, that's how she is. Because of you.",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'm gonna have to fix that.",
        "Blair: How could you do that to her, huh? How could you put her in a position like that? Trying to get you to break out of jail?",
        "Todd: I want my whiskey. I don't want your water. Thank you. I had to do it, Blair. My mother was gonna kill everyone that I care about. And that includes you.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. This is soaked through. You're gonna bleed to death. God, I've got to call -- got to call an ambulance.",
        "Todd: No, no!",
        "Blair: Yes!",
        "Todd: No. Blair --",
        "Blair: Todd --",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Blair: Give me the phone. Got to call an ambulance 'cause you're gonna bleed to death.",
        "Todd: Doesn't matter. I'm dead already.",
        "Blair: Todd --",
        "Todd: I am, when the cops find out my bitch mother double-crossed me.",
        "Blair: What'd she do?",
        "Todd: Besides try and blow up my entire family? She took the gun -- the only thing that she knows could clear me -- she threw it in the water.",
        "Blair: Well, you can forget all about the gun now, all right? Come on, I've got to call. Oh, you're bleeding so badly. You need help, Todd.",
        "Todd: So, why -- why can't you help me?",
        "Blair: Oh, gee. You know what? I just hadn't gotten that medical degree yet.",
        "Todd: It's a flesh wound.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: It is. All you got to do is clean it out, wrap it. What could be so hard about that?",
        "Blair: Right. That's it? Okay, yeah, I'll do it. Sure, sure. If you die on me, it's your own damn fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: [Sighs] Well, I'll do my best.",
        "Starr: I know that you will, and I'm so grateful.",
        "James: Starr, I told you, I'd do anything for you.",
        "Starr: I'm so scared for my dad, though. James, after everything that he's been through, what his mother did to him --",
        "James: Everything's gonna be okay. I'm gonna get Jack to come forward with the truth, and your dad's gonna come home safe. I just -- I hate leaving you all alone in this jail cell.",
        "Starr: No, it's okay. I'll be fine. And if everything goes well, by the time you get back here, I'll -- I'll be out of here, right? Thank you so much for doing this for my dad.",
        "James: Well, let's get one thing straight, Twinkle -- I am not doing this for your dad. I'm doing it for you. Because I love you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Sam, come on. You got to get to bed.",
        "Sam: But I'm a deputy.",
        "Jack: And that's great, but you're also gonna be toast if Mom comes home and finds you eating cookies. You know better. And you also know better than to talk to cops.",
        "Sam: But cops are our friends.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but this one isn't. Now get to bed.",
        "Sam: I'm on duty.",
        "Jack: Come on, go!",
        "John: Night, Sam.",
        "Jack: All right, so if you're looking for Scarface, what are you doing here? I heard he went looking for his mother.",
        "John: Yeah, he did, and she's dead, too.",
        "Jack: I told you, that guy's a maniac.",
        "John: Yeah, right. You told us. Listen, if he tries to get in contact with you, for any reason, call the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Okay, Viki has a pitiful-looking first-aid kit, and I got some clean towels. Now I need to see what's going on in here.",
        "Todd: She's gonna bill us for dry cleaning.",
        "Blair: Oh. Todd, we got to take your shirt off.",
        "Todd: You first.",
        "Blair: Come on.",
        "Todd: Just saying. Missed you. Don't see you for eight years. This is not exactly how I pictured our reunion.",
        "Blair: Me either. Me either. Okay, now, it's the last button. Put your arm there. I'm gonna pull you close to me, all right? You ready? Come on.",
        "[Todd grunting]",
        "Blair: Sorry, sorry. I got you, I got you. Okay, I'm gonna get this arm first. The good arm. Come on. Pull it down. Okay, okay. Wait, wait. I'm getting this other one. Ready? Here it goes. Oh, you got it. You're all right. Okay, lie on your back. Right there. Easy. Easy.",
        "[Todd breathing heavily]",
        "Blair: Are you all right? Shh.",

        "Natalie: I don't have any news on Todd Manning. Actually, I just got here. I was down at the docks collecting evidence.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, if you find anything that could implicate my brother, as his attorney, I have the right to know.",
        "Natalie: Actually, we did find something. There was this other blood at the scene which more than likely is not Irene Manning's.",
        "T\u00e9a: How can you be sure?",
        "Natalie: The blood was nowhere near the body. It was probably the shooter's, which, according to you, according to your confession, would be you. But you're not bleeding.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Irene and I struggled. After I shot her, she staggered before she fell. It was probably hers.",
        "Natalie: Probably not. I mean, because if Irene staggered, bleeding from a gunshot wound like that, there'd be a blood trail, and there wasn't. Care to add anything?",
        "T\u00e9a: I wasn't aware that you were questioning my client.",
        "Natalie: Oh, no. No, no. I'm not. Yeah. We'll wait for John -- you know, when he gets back.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm.",
        "Natalie: But if I were you, I would tell John about Todd's involvement, because even if you don't, we're gonna know for sure. Soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Natalie and I really appreciate you stepping in and watching him tonight. Did he give you any trouble?",
        "Jessica: He was a perfect angel.",
        "Brody: That's my boy, huh? You know, I was kind of surprised when Natalie told me you volunteered, given how rough things have been between you guys lately.",
        "Jessica: He's my flesh and blood. Bree and Ryder's, too.",
        "Brody: That's true. [Laughs] Hey! And in a perfect world, you know, we could all forget the past and learn to be -- at least civil again, you know? You and your kids, and me and Natalie and ours?",
        "Jessica: I don't think that can ever happen.",
        "Brody: I know this isn't what any of us wanted. I mean, a year ago, you and I were supposed to be getting married and starting a family.",
        "Jessica: I remember.",
        "Brody: And then after all that went down, we all ended up feeling so hurt and betrayed, and nobody more than you. So I know I have no right to ask this, but I really hope you can make peace with Natalie and with the family we've made with Liam.",
        "Jessica: You seem really happy.",
        "Brody: I am. You know me, Jessica. You know my history. You know how important having a family is to me.",
        "Jessica: I remember when I met you in St. Anne's and how hurt you were that you couldn't be a father to Shane.",
        "Brody: I lost it. Completely. That was a long time ago. Now I'm a stronger person, for so many reasons, but mostly because of Liam. Hey, hey, huh? I mean, I love Shane, but eventually I had to accept that he wasn't my son and he never would be. But Liam -- Liam's really mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Did you hear what she said? Natalie doesn't believe you, and neither will the good detective. They both know you're lying.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I know what happened, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, good for you, because pretty soon, everybody's gonna know what happened. Natalie's gonna be back with the test results from that blood. And we both know it's not gonna be Irene's blood. It's gonna be Todd's, from when she shot him.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: For all we know, that blood could belong to anyone. Could be a drug deal that went wrong.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Laughs] Really? Is that what you're gonna go with? Well, I will bet a billion to one that's not what comes back. Instead, we're gonna get irrefutable evidence that Todd was on those docks, and that he's the one who shot Irene, not you.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Interesting theory.",
        "T\u00e9a: Why are you doing this? You're not gonna get away with this, okay? I don't get why you are covering for Todd. I don't get why you're sabotaging yourself.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I know what I'm doing.",
        "T\u00e9a: Do you?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Do you know what kind of trouble Todd is in already? He's being set up for his brother's murder. He escaped from jail. And now if he killed somebody after he escaped, what's gonna happen to him? Another murder rap? A longer prison-term sentence? Maybe life or worse? The man's life would be over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: See now? That wasn't so bad, right? Could have been a hell of a lot worse.",
        "Todd: Right. Worse than all the other bullet holes you've had to clean.",
        "Blair: Damn it.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: I'm not gonna have enough gauze to really make a bandage for you. I'm gonna look and see if there's some more towels we can get, if there's some more towels over here. One of Charlie's. You never knew Charlie, right? Pretty nice guy. Met him a couple of times. Todd, hey, hey, hey! [Clapping hands] Come on! Now come on! You got to stay with me now. Todd. Talk to me.",
        "Todd: Am I dead?",
        "Blair: Don't say that.",
        "Todd: You just said, \"Talk to me.\"",
        "Blair: Well, I want you to talk to me but just don't use the \"D\" word, all right? Please.",
        "Todd: What difference does it make? This is where I am, right?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Todd: Gone.",
        "Blair: No, stop talk --",
        "Todd: Because I died eight years ago.",
        "Blair: Stop it.",
        "Todd: Been in purgatory. I don't know what it is about me. I thought I could come home. Make a fresh start. I'm so tired.",

        "James: I was just there.",
        "Jack: Then what are you doing here?",
        "James: Well, I came to warn you, Jack.",
        "Jack: Warn me? About what?",
        "James: Well, I heard a couple of cops talking. Todd Manning's back in custody.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "James: Yeah, for him, maybe. He got that gun back from his mom -- the one he says proves he didn't kill your dad.",
        "Jack: So?",
        "James: So, they're running ballistic tests. What if they back up his story?",
        "Jack: No, they won't.",
        "James: You sure about that? 'Cause if that gun turns out not to be the murder weapon, the cops are gonna know you lied when you told them Todd killed Victor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I understand how serious it will be for Todd if he is charged with another murder. What I don't understand is, why is this your problem, huh? Why are you sacrificing your life for his?",
        "John: Well, Manning's still at large, and every minute you continue on with this ridiculous story, the worse it gets for him. So what do you say, Delgado, we stop wasting time, and you tell me what really happened on the docks?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I already have.",

        "Blair: Come on, that's -- that's -- that's crazy talk. Damn it! Don't you die on me like this, all right? You don't put this off on me. Not after all the grief that you've caused me. You hear me? Damn it. Come on, you've got to stay awake for Starr. You owe that to her, of all the trouble you put her in. So come on. Oh, Todd. You're still alive, but barely. Come on! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Talk to me. Stop.",
        "Todd: What's the matter with you? What are you doing? You don't have to be violent with me.",
        "Blair: I don't care what you say. I'm calling a doctor.",
        "Todd: No. You can't call a doctor unless you're gonna call a doctor who you know is never gonna turn me in.",
        "Blair: Why didn't I think of it before? Don't move, okay? Dorian. Yes, I need your help.",
        "Blair: Yeah, Dorian, I know that you are so busy with your campaign, and I promise you I would not call if it weren't really a big emergency here. What? Well, you -- you tell Mr. James Carvel or Carville or whatever it is --",
        "Todd: Carville?",
        "Blair: Carville! Whatever his name is.",
        "Todd: She's talking to James Carvill?",
        "Blair: That it's an emergency, all right? Just wait a minute. I just need to know how -- quick -- how do you fix a gunshot wound? Dress it, whatever. Dorian, no, no, none of the Cramer women are hurt, all right? Well, I'm not gonna tell you who it is. How'd you know it was Todd?",
        "Todd: I want a real doctor.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Todd: I want a real doctor.",
        "Blair: No, he did not. He didn't mean that. He has full faith in you, Dorian.",
        "Todd: Yeah, faith that she's gonna let me die.",
        "Blair: Okay. Stop. Listen, she made an oath not to harm anyone. Now, stop it.",
        "Todd: Are we talking about the same Dorian?",
        "Blair: Well, his crazy mother fired a shot into his shoulder at close range. He's really bleeding a lot, and he's in and out of consciousness, and -- Dorian, I tried to talk him into going to the hospital, and he said he wouldn't, and I just -- I need you to tell me what I got to do to help him.",

        "James: Say that you were confused. Say that you were mad at Todd and grieving over your dad. Say whatever the hell you want. It doesn't matter. But you need to say something to them before they come after you for obstructing justice or whatever. Look, the sooner you say something to them, the easier they're gonna go on you. Trust me, dude.
