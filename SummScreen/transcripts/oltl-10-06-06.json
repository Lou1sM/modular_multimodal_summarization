        "Natalie gets up and decides that she isn't going to the funeral. Roxy slaps her hard and tells her that she needs to snap out of it. Viki talks to her about going to funerals for loved ones and knows that she will regret this if she doesn't go. Natalie gets dressed and arrives at the event. Dorian goes to the park upset. A man with no shoes on is sleeping on the other side of the bench. \"Well if you think that you are going to steal my shoes, you have another thing coming!\" the man shouts jumping up. It is David. Dorian thought that he was long gone on some quest to be a movie star. Turns out that the woman agent only wanted to get in his pants. Now he has nothing and needs a job badly. He actually slept on the park bench last night. Dorian offers his a job at CRAZE, but he wants something different. He toys with the idea of asking Viki for a job but Dorian hates that idea! When David hears that Viki is at John's funeral, he is stunned. He had no idea that John was dead. He feels that it is his fault. Dorian suggests that he go to the funeral if she feels that he needs to. They head over there together. Asa is home! He's been released and the family greets him. Bo tells how Truman might have a vendetta against the family and Bo will be looking into that. Asa tells Bo to forget about that. Bo can't. Too many things have happened to the family. When Nigel is alone with Asa, he tells that he knows that the man is hiding something. He found the picture of the woman that Asa had with him. He shows it to Asa now. Nigel hasn't told anyone about the picture but he just might. Nigel knows that the picture has to do with Spencer and New Years Eve. The funeral goes off without a hitch. When David goes to Eve to express his gratitude to John for finding out that he wasn't a killer, she appreciates what he has to say but isn't glad to meet him. Bo still feels that Vickers showed guts doing that. Next, everyone heads to the cemetery. The officers bring the coffin to the grave. The coffin starts lowering Eve falls to her knees from her chair and crawls over to the box. \"Goodbye my baby Oh Danny Boy,\" she starts singing. When her voice fails her due to her grief, Evangeline picks up the ball and sings the rest of the song. Michael comes and gets his mother picking her up and taking her to Marcie. \"John isn't here. Let's go.\" Everyone is gone by Natalie who wants to be alone there. Soon it is getting dark and she throws her flower in the grave and starts walking out. Suddenly she stops and turns in the darkness. \"John?\""

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa: Now, what the hell is this? I cannot make a toast without bourbon.",
        "Nigel: Remember what the doctors said, sir? Alcohol is strictly verboten from now on.",
        "Asa: You happy with your job, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: That a trick question, sir?",
        "Asa: You have health insurance, dental?",

        "Clint: She's upstairs getting your room ready.",
        "Asa: I'll be honest with you boys -- there was more than one night in that hospital I wasn't too sure I'd -- I'd make it back here.",
        "Kevin: Oh, come on, grandpa. You weren't going anywhere. You liked torturing those nurses way too much.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Dorian, what are you doing in a public park?",
        "Dorian: Me? What are you doing here?",
        "David: I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. I took a lot of that melatonin? Packs quite a punch. So I thought I'd come out here and get some -- you aren't buying this, are you?",
        "Dorian: David, you spent the night on a park bench.",
        "David: Technically.",
        "Dorian: What? I don't understand. I mean, what happened? You -- you were on your way to -- to Hollywood to become an actor.",
        "David: Oh, yeah. That didn't work out.",
        "Dorian: What happened to the casting director? What's -- what's her name, you know?",
        "David: Yeah, I --",
        "Dorian: The one who discovered you?",
        "David: Yeah. I called her.",
        "Dorian: And?",
        "David: Yeah, it -- it didn't work out.",
        "Dorian: What happened?",
        "David: Well, I was invited up to her suite for an audition.",
        "Dorian: Ooh, how sweet.",
        "David: She put a script in my hand, sat me down on the casting couch, and then she took the script out of my hand.",
        "Dorian: Oh. There went your acting career. I am so sorry.",
        "David: Yeah, tell me about it. You know, I was willing to take one for the team, anything to get my foot in the door, you know?",
        "Dorian: Yeah.",
        "David: Turns out it wasn't my foot she was interested in.",
        "Dorian: Oh. I know what that feels like to have your hopes raised so high and to have the rug pulled out from under you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: You know, when he was growing up, girls were calling the house constantly to talk to him. Your father was scandalized. He had never heard of anything like that. Thomas was rather old-fashioned that way.",
        "Michael: And, me, I was the annoying younger brother on the extension trying to pick up pointers.",
        "Marcie: I bet.",
        "Rex: Natty, where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: John's dead, and he's still going to be dead whether I go to the funeral or not.",
        "Roxy: Hey, baby cakes, how come you're not dressed yet?",
        "Jessica: She says she's not going.",
        "Roxy: Huh?",
        "Natalie: I don't see the point.",
        "Roxy: The point? Snap out of it.",
        "Roxy: Baby, you can't skip Johnny boy's funeral. It's just not right.",
        "Natalie: I will say goodbye to John in my own time, in my own way. I don't need an audience.",
        "Jessica: Oh, honey. Honey, nobody's going to be looking at you.",
        "Natalie: Of course they are. You know, I'm the grieving fiancee. They're going to be waiting for me to lose it, to pass out, throw myself on the coffin.",
        "Viki: Baby, I know how you feel, ok? And I know how hard today is going to be for you. I've been there too many times. I also know that if you don't go to John's funeral today, you will regret it for the rest of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Ahem -- this is a great day for all of us because we finally got pa back home again. And it's going to be a rough day, too, but since we're all together here, I think there's something that we better discuss. It's -- it'll have an effect on the entire Buchanan family.",
        "Clint: What's going on, Bo?",
        "Bo: Spencer Truman.",
        "Asa: That slime. What's he up to now?",
        "Bo: David Vickers thinks he was responsible for what happened up at the lodge on New Year's Eve.",
        "Asa: Bourbon -- bourbon was responsible.",
        "Clint: Pa, it seemed like more than that at the time.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, Vickers claims that Truman has a vendetta against the Buchanans.",
        "Clint: That's what you thought all along, Pa.",
        "Bo: And according to Vickers, Truman was up to something on New Year's Eve, all right? The next day, all of a sudden Kevin comes down sick, we find you passed out on the floor.",
        "Nigel: Mr. Buchanan was never the same after that.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, we know what he did to me, but are you saying that you think he made grandpa sick?",
        "Bo: No, I don't know. All I'm saying is that I'm sure up at the cabin on New Year's. Now, my question is, why?",
        "Asa: Come on, Bo. Let me just enjoy being home.",
        "Bo: Well, sure, pa. I said it's great to have you back home, but you're the one that told me that we have to get Truman before he gets us. Ok, fine. No, we'll drop it. I'll drop it for now. I've got to get to the funeral. It is great to have you back home.",
        "Nigel: Please offer Detective Mc Bain's family my most sincere condolences.",
        "Bo: I will, Nigel. Thank you.",
        "Matthew: See you, Grandpa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You know, David, it wasn't too long ago that you were ready to sell yourself to the mayor's wife as a gigolo for just a few extra bucks.",
        "David: $500. And we in the trade prefer the term \"escort.\"",
        "Dorian: It would not be the first time that you have, you know, grappled with some --",
        "David: I have told you I am making a change in my life. I want to succeed by my own merit for the first time in my life.",
        "Dorian: And I think that's absolutely wonderful.",
        "David: Oh.",
        "Dorian: I really do, but I wonder. I wonder if maybe you yourself aren't selling yourself short.",
        "David: Do you think I'm pricing myself too low?",
        "Dorian: I think it's time for you to stop selling your soul, David. But how will you live? What will you do?",
        "David: I don't know. But I'll think of something. I always do.",
        "Dorian: Oh, well, maybe I should offer you your job back at \"Craze.\"",
        "Dorian and David: No.",
        "David: I should talk to Viki. I bet she'd give me a job at \"The Banner.\" She's always liked me, you know.",
        "Dorian: If you are trying to tick me off, it's working.",
        "David: I need a job, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: I want you to stay away from Viki.",
        "David: Well, are you making me a counter offer?",
        "Dorian: I'm just saying --",
        "David: Well, whatever you want to say is duly noted. All the same, I think I'm going to pay Viki a visit.",
        "Dorian: Well, she's probably at John Mc Bain's funeral.",
        "David: John Mc Bain is dead?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Rex: Well, I had to come -- not just for John. Natalie's going to need a lot of help.",
        "Bo: Yeah, she is. Come on, bud.",
        "Rex: I know how close you and Mc Bain were. I'm really sorry. If there's anything I can do --",
        "Bo: I appreciate that.",
        "Matthew: Hey, dad, can Rex sit with me since you're going to be with your guys?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah, I think that'd be good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hey.",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Evangeline: How are you?",
        "Nora: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Evangeline: Are you feeling ok?",
        "Nora: I'm fine. I wish people would stop asking me that.",
        "Evangeline: Would you tell somebody if you weren't fine?",
        "Nora: I'm worried about you. I know how you felt about John. I think I'm probably one of the only people that knows just how deep that love was.",
        "Evangeline: I don't believe it. I mean, I just -- I can't get used to the idea that he's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eve: Oh.",
        "Priest: The hearse has pulled up outside.",
        "Eve: Thank you, father. Um -- Michael, you'll be following the honor guard with Bo and Antonio, ok?",
        "Michael: Ok.",
        "Eve: Where's -- where's Natalie?",
        "Marcie: I don't know. Father, could we just wait a couple of minutes for John's fiancee?",
        "Priest: Certainly. Just let me know when she arrives.",
        "Marcie: Thank you.",
        "Eve: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Are you ready for this?",
        "Jessica: You can do this.",
        "Natalie: Let's just get this over with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa: Nigel, make me another one. I'm going to drink to John Mc Bain.",
        "Nigel: I wasn't aware you knew him very well, sir.",
        "Asa: My granddaughter was in love with him. That's enough for me. Now, make this one Irish whiskey.",
        "Nigel: I'm afraid we're out.",
        "Asa: That's impossible.",
        "Nigel: Your sons, as they say, drank you out of house and home while you were gone. As well, I don't blame them for what's been going on around here. But if you're playing tricks on me --",
        "Nigel: Of course not, no more than you are trying to pull something over on your family.",
        "Asa: What?",
        "Nigel: I've been with you for many years. I've observed you doing everything from making billion-dollar deals to playing poker, and forgive me saying this, but I can tell when you're lying.",
        "Asa: The word is \"bluffing.\"",
        "Nigel: I know the difference. And when Commissioner Buchanan was talking about Spencer Truman, I felt you were holding something back there's something about New Year's Eve you don't want to discuss.",
        "Asa: That is ridiculous. I don't know what the hell you're talking about.",
        "Nigel: This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I'd like to pay my respects to John's family, but --",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "David: I got a feeling I wouldn't be welcome there.",
        "Dorian: You didn't kill John's father. Spencer did.",
        "David: I know, but I was involved. If I didn't mess up, John's father wouldn't have had to pull his gun, Spencer wouldn't have killed him. In fact, John and Thomas Mc Bain might be alive today.",
        "Dorian: You didn't cause John's accident.",
        "David: Yeah, but he wouldn't have been on that road. John Mc Bain's entire life took a different turn, thanks to me.",
        "Dorian: It's heartbreaking, but -- they say he was on his way to visit his father's grave when the accident happened.",
        "David: Oh, God. I'm just sick about the whole damn thing.",
        "Dorian: David, you know, if your conscience is telling you that you should go to the funeral, then I -- I think you should go.",
        "David: Do you think maybe you'd go with me? I don't think I could handle all those people right now.",
        "Dorian: Yes, of course I'll go with you. I want to pay my respects, too.",
        "David: Thanks.",
        "Dorian: So we're clear -- you've made a promise not to ask Viki for a job. Gee, I wonder if Clint's going to be there. And what about Adriana?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa: Where'd you get this?",
        "Nigel: I found it in a drawer when I was packing your things at the hospital. But I've seen you sneaking looks at it ever since new year's day.",
        "Asa: You've been spying on me?",
        "Nigel: Merely observing, sir. I haven't mentioned it to anyone -- yet.",
        "Asa: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Nigel: I can't help thinking that photograph had something to do with whatever dr. Truman was up to on New Year's Eve. Who is that woman? What does she mean to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Priest: In the name of the father, and the son, and the holy spirit, amen.",
        "All: Amen.",
        "Priest: Praise be to God, father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, the father of mercy, God of all consolation.",
        "Dorian: There -- there's my worst nightmare.",
        "Priest: He comforts us in all of our afflictions.",
        "David: I'm sorry. If you want to get out of here, we can.",
        "Dorian: No, no, no. I -- I want to stay -- out of respect for John. Come on.",
        "All: Blessed be God, the father of our lord, Jesus Christ.",
        "Priest: John's close friend and mentor and Commissioner Bo Buchanan, will now deliver the eulogy.",
        "Matthew: Dad? Good luck.",
        "Bo: When I became commissioner of police in Llanview, I thought that I knew what being a cop really meant. But when I met John Mc Bain, I had to rethink that because the job was John's life. And it wasn't just what he did, it was who he was. John's blood ran blue. So, father, when you suggest that I was John's mentor, it makes me feel just a little bit strange, because I learned so much from John -- about police work, and about the -- the dogged pursuit of justice. I like that myself, but when I -- when I see it in another man, one that I admired so much, one that I loved, it's like my son, Matthew, would say -- \"John Mc Bain was awesome.\" I was proud to call him my friend. We all were. And I think that we should be grateful that we had him in our lives as long as we did. Because John Mc Bain was a true hero. But he wasn't without his little quirks. I'm sure that it's no secret that sometimes our John had a little -- a little trouble expressing him -- expressing himself. He would --",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Bo: He was a man of few words. But he said a lot. He spoke with deeds, and actions. And those deeds and those actions meant more to the people of Llanview, and to his -- his friends, and his family, his loved ones than -- than any words could ever possibly express. And if John Mc Bain loved you, you knew it.",
        "Priest: I bless the body of John Mc Bain with the holy water that recalls his baptism. For if we have been united with him, by likeness to his death, so shall we be united with him by likeness to his resurrection. On the day of Christ's return, may he be clothed in glory. Let us depart in peace to love and serve the Lord. Now, before we reconvene at mt. Hope cemetery for the graveside service, John's brother would like to say something.",
        "Michael: I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for coming here today, to support my family, show your respect for my brother. After the cemetery, we're going to be gathering at Rodi's in Llanview for the repast. We'd like you all to come.",
        "[Bagpipes play]",
        "David: Michael, Mrs. Mc Bain --",
        "Eve: What?",
        "David: I -- I just wanted to say how sorry I am for your loss.",
        "Michael: This is David Vickers, Spencer Truman's little brother.",
        "Eve: I know I'm in God's house, but I'm sorry, I can't say that I'm happy to meet you.",
        "David: Wait, Mrs. Mc Bain -- I understand, and I don't mean to intrude. But I want you to know that I felt guilty my entire life for what I thought I had done to your husband -- to your father. And if it weren't for your s, I would have gone to my grave thinking that I was a killer. John gave me a second chance. I just want to say -- thank you.",
        "Bo: Vickers, it took guts for you to show up here today. I'm sorry.",
        "Eve: Oh, thank you. Thank you for that beautiful eulogy. You know, John really loved you. I know he would be very proud to know that that's what you feel about him.",
        "Bo: I hope he did know. Look, maybe -- maybe we can talk later on, ok?",
        "Eve: I'd like that.",
        "Bo: All right.",
        "Viki: I'm very, very proud of you. I know how hard this is.",
        "Natalie: If I can just -- just make it till they bury John.",
        "[Bagpipes play]",
        "Officer: Detail! Atten-hut! Present arms! Order arms!",
        "Antonio: \"The lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me for all the days of my life. And I shall dwell in the house of the lord forever.\" Amen.",
        "Officer: On behalf of the commonwealth of the state of Pennsylvania and the Llanview city Police Department, I present you with this flag that your son so proudly served.",
        "Eve: Goodbye, my baby.",
        "Michael: Come on.",
        "Eve: Down the",
        "Michael: It's ok, mom.",
        "Evangeline: Mountain's side the summer's gone and all the roses falling it's you, it's you must go and I must bide but come ye back",
        "Nora: Don't worry, John. I'll finish what you started. Spencer won't get away.",
        "Antonio: I'll try to be half the cop you were, man.",
        "Evangeline: Or when the valley's",
        "Cristian: You saved my life.",
        "Antonio: Rest in peace, my friend.",
        "Cristian: I won't forget it.",
        "Roxy: I'm sorry I gave you a hard time. I was just looking out for my kid. But you're a great guy.",
        "Matthew: Tell Jen and Sam that I love them, and that I miss them. I'm going to miss you, too, John.",
        "Evangeline: In sunshine",
