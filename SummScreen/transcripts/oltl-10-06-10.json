        "Bo: Yeah. Come in.",
        "Nora: Do you have any idea what time it is?",
        "Bo: Yeah. We were supposed to have lunch an hour ago.",
        "Nora: Actually, we were supposed to have lunch now. You were supposed to call me an hour ago to see if I was free.",
        "Bo: Ah. You free?",
        "Nora: Swamped. You?",
        "Bo: I'm still dealing with Danielle Rayburn's disappearance.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God, that poor kid.",
        "Bo: Now with Elijah Clarke back on the scene--",
        "Nora: I don't understand how that guy could still be alive.",
        "Bo: Well, McBain has got our people looking, but until we have proof that Clarke is back in Llanview, we still have a missing girl.",
        "Nora: You'll find her.",
        "Bo: Yeah. That's what I keep telling Manning. You know what? He took her, he's sure putting on one hell of an act.",
        "Nora: Well, it sounds to me like you got your hands full.",
        "Bo: Sorry about lunch.",
        "Nora: Oh, that's okay. I couldn't get away, either, which is why God invented...delivery.",

        "Kelly: Blair doesn't need to be knocked out.",
        "Blair: What Blair needs is a little peace and quiet, so please. Kelly is right. I'm not' gonna get any rest until Dani is home safe.",

        "James: He can't come in without a warrant, right?",
        "Ford: Who said he doesn't have one?",
        "Starr: What's going on?",
        "James: Did the police find out what we did?",
        "Starr: No, not from me, not from anyone over here.",

        "Natalie: Hey, Cole.",
        "Cole: Hey, didn't know you were still here.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I just finished collecting all of the evidence we need.",
        "Cole: Did you come up with anything?",
        "Natalie: Unfortunately not, but I did just find this. It's a chain with a bullet on it. Ever see anything like this before?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I just keep seeing Dani's face when they brought her over to Todd's to pack her things. I mean, she couldn't even put two words together.",
        "Kelly: Do you think it was real? I mean, was she planning anything?",
        "Blair: Well, the shock was absolutely real. No. She wasn't planning to run off from Todd and Ross or a court order. She was numb. She was scared. I should've grabbed her. I should've grabbed her. I should've put her in a room. I should've done that.",
        "Dorian: No. Lot of good that would have done.",
        "Blair: Dorian, I made a promise to T\u00e9a that I would look after her daughter, and I've done absolutely nothing. Now Dani is off God knows where, and it's all my fault!",

        "Eli: I have a safe way out of town.",
        "Ross: Man, this makes no sense. Listen. Why didn't you wait for us where we were supposed to meet you? That was the plan.",
        "Eli: Well, sometimes plans have to change, Ross. I wasn't safe where I was.",
        "Ross: Oh, right, so you come back to Llanview, where half the city wants to shoot you if they see you?",
        "Eli: Yeah. That's why we got to move.",
        "Ross: But this is nuts, man.",
        "Eli: Listen. I know what I'm doing. I can get us both out of here safely. Now let's just go pick up Danielle and go.",

        "Man: Let's go.",
        "Todd: Wait a minute. You heard the lady. Back off.",

        "Dorian: Oh, ex-family, but she's right. Gentlemen, you may go.",

        "Todd: Yeah. He's alive.",
        "Blair: What, did you get a call from him? Like you got a call from T\u00e9a?",
        "Todd: No. I'm not hearing things. This is coming straight from John McBain. He's definitely alive.",

        "Starr: James, what happened?",
        "James: I don't know. I gotta go, okay? Dude, don't turn Dani in.",
        "Ford: The cops are here. You want to go to jail?",
        "James: Look. That cop doesn't know she's here.",
        "Ford: You want to bet your future on it?",
        "James: It's just a hunch, dude. If they knew she was here, they would've busted down the door already.",
        "Ford: They're already here, and they're at our door.",
        "James: Okay. Just get rid of the cops, please, and if you want her gone, I'll move her, okay?",
        "Ford: Yeah, like that would be easy.",
        "Brody: Clock is ticking, Ford. Put on some pants and open up.",

        "Cole: No.",
        "Natalie: So it's not a Goth thing.",
        "Cole: Not that I know of.",
        "Natalie: So who would wear something like this?",
        "Cole: Huh. It would take a total jackass to wear something that stupid.",
        "Natalie: Like who?",
        "Starr: Cole.",
        "Natalie: Does this jackass have a name?",

        "Kelly: How could Eli be alive?",
        "Blair: I shot him.",
        "Todd: With blanks.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: What happened in Tahiti was staged. He and his brother rigged it because the heat was on them.",
        "Blair: Todd, come on. That's not true.",
        "Todd: Well, if you don't believe was me, ask John McBain. He's the one that figured it out.",
        "Blair: I just don't believe it.",
        "Kelly: Eli is coming here, isn't he?",
        "Todd: That might be his next stop. Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Whoa, wait a second. You said you won, right? You won in court. You got custody of Danielle, and the will worked. Everyone believed it.",
        "Ross: Yes, yes. I won. Dani and I were supposed to leave last night.",
        "Eli: Then what the hell happened?",
        "Ross: She took off.",
        "Eli: How could you let her out of your sight, Ross? You had one job.",
        "Ross: Hey, you know what? The judge told me to just leave her while she was packing and saying her good-byes. Come on, man. The cops were crawling all over the place.",
        "Eli: So what, did she just disappear?",
        "Ross: Yeah. She gave them the slip.",
        "Eli: Or Todd Manning had her taken.",
        "Ross: No, no. I was all over that. So were the cops. That had nothing on him.",
        "Eli: And what are the cops doing right now?",
        "Ross: They're looking for her full force.",
        "Eli: Oh, my God, that's perfect, just what we need--a whole town crawling with police",
        "Ross: If they find my daughter, I don't care.",
        "Eli: You'll care if Todd Manning took her and you'll never see her again.",
        "Ross: Don't say that.",
        "Eli: Come on, Ross. How could you let this happen? I'll lose everything I worked so hard for.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry. What have you worked so hard for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm gonna check out back. You guys stay here. Stay put, all right? Don't leave this room.",
        "Blair: My God, I still don't believe it.",
        "Dorian: If Elijah Clarke is alive, then this house could be his first stop.",
        "Blair: Oh...",
        "[Beep]",
        "Dorian: This is Mayor Lord. I want you to bring the police...",
        "Kelly: He must have snapped.",
        "Blair: Do you believe it?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I do. Eli has nowhere else to run.",
        "Blair: Oh...",
        "Dorian: He's got nothing left to lose. He's hell-bent for revenge. Kelly, your investigation is what exposed him. Blair, you tried to kill him. It's just a question of which one of you is gonna be his first target.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: So what have you worked so hard for?",
        "Eli: Getting Danielle back for you, bro.",
        "Ross: Dude, why do you seem more upset about Dani being gone than I do?",
        "Eli: We need Danielle.",
        "Ross: Look. You know what? Go back to Caracas, okay? That was the plan. Wait there, and I'll meet you as soon as I find Dani.",
        "Eli: Why?",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Eli: Why would you even ever go to Caracas? You have everything you want. What about me, Ross?",
        "Ross: What about you? Dude, you're free. Everybody thinks you're dead, okay? I'm the one who has to leave the country. So go so you can become another guy again.",
        "Eli: See, that takes cash, cash I no longer have, thanks to John McBain and Kelly telling Blair everything.",
        "Ross: Look. I'm sorry about that, okay, bro, but I'm not leaving until--",
        "Eli: You have the answer. Don't you get it? We can use Danielle to squeeze Todd Manning for every penny he has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: He'd be crazy to show up here, Todd. He'd be crazy.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Of course he's crazy, and her highness' security guards barely stopped me.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me. I have already called in the police.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God, Dani. Todd, Eli has Dani.",
        "Todd: No. He doesn't. He doesn't. No. McBain said he wouldn't have had time to get here.",
        "Blair: Well, you don't know that for sure. I mean, what are you sitting here worried about us when Dani is out there.",
        "Todd: I think I know who has Dani.",
        "Dorian: Well, why didn't you just tell us when you came in?",
        "Blair: Where is she?",
        "Todd: I don't know where she is. I just know who has her.",
        "Blair: We got to find her, Todd!",
        "Todd: As long as she stays hidden, she stays safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Just stay there, Dani, okay? I don't know what Bobby is gonna say. Stay.",
        "Ford: What do you think I'm hiding here?",
        "Brody: An underage girl. That is how you like them, right?",
        "Ford: Come on. I don't have a girl here.",
        "Brody: You just like to walk around naked in the middle of the day?",
        "Ford: I took a shower.",
        "Brody: You alone?",
        "Ford: No. My little brother is studying in the back room. So what do you want, Officer?",
        "Brody: Oh, this isn't a police visit. I'm here about Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hey, Hannah.",
        "Hannah: Hey.",
        "Marty: What are you doing?",
        "Hannah: I was just trying to clean up, and I made a bigger mess.",
        "Marty: Those are my case files.",
        "Hannah: I think I got them all back in order.",
        "Marty: No. They're confidential.",
        "Hannah: I know. I have been one of these files. I wasn't being nosy. I just dropped them, and I was picking them up from the floor, and I started dinner, so I'm gonna go check on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Jessica? I've got nothing to say about her. Why won't you take yes for an answer? The baby is both of yours.",
        "Brody: You don't know that until the paternity test proves you're not the father.",
        "Ford: I can't wait.",
        "Brody: Neither can we. Meantime, I have to make sure Jessica stays healthy until the baby is born.",
        "Ford: I'm sure you will.",
        "Brody: Not that simple. The idea that it's even possible that you are the baby's father is stressing her out. I just came from the doctor's office. Jessica has been put on bed rest--",
        "Ford: Why? Is she okay?",
        "Brody: What's it to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Did you want to ask me something?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I just finished collecting evidence trying to figure out where your sister might be, and I found this. It was right here outside Dani's window. Thought maybe it must've fell off of her when she left.",
        "Starr: It doesn't look like hers.",
        "Natalie: No. No. It doesn't, does it? Kind of looks more like a guy thing. Maybe the person who helped her was wearing it?",
        "Starr: Maybe it's been here for a while.",
        "Natalie: No. It's actually pretty clean, and it rained the night before last, so if it's been there a while, yeah, it definitely would show it. You know what? You can also tell more things about would like this bullet is no ordinary bullet. It's been fired from a .38. Couldn't you tell?",
        "Starr: I don't know guns.",
        "Natalie: But didn't you fire a .38 when you shot James? You know, James is Dani's boyfriend's brother. Small world.",
        "Starr: I guess.",
        "Natalie: Starr, is this James' necklace?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: There's CSU on the case?",
        "Nora: I'll bring the evidence down there myself. I'm not letting this guy walk.",
        "Bo: All right. Let me know when they finish.",
        "Nora: Right. Just let me know as soon as you can. Any luck? Natalie is working the scene at Manning's house, but if she found anything at all, a smoking gun, we would have heard something by now.",
        "Nora: If he finds anything at all, his lawyer is gonna file a suppression.",
        "Bo: Hmm. How's the Muhhy case?",
        "Nora: Oh, my God, the lawyer says nothing was in plain sight. The evidence was not in plain sight. The cops found it by walking in there. How much me plain sight can you get? What are you looking for?",
        "Bo: Ketchup.",
        "Nora: Oh. Here.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: I only used half.",
        "Bo: Not enough. This is not right.",
        "Nora: What, the ketchup.",
        "Bo: No. This. All of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: No, no, no. You actually think you can shake down Todd? Come on. You saw T\u00e9a's will. Dani's money is all tied up in a trust until she's of age.",
        "Eli: You don't think Manning would be willing to cough all that up and more just to get his daughter back?",
        "Ross: She's not going back to Todd. I won't give her back to Todd, not for anything.",
        "Eli: What if she's not yours to give?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Can't believe that Eli is still out there walking around.",
        "Todd: I can't believe I agree with Dorian, but she's right. It's not safe out there for you.",
        "Blair: I'm not gonna let Eli intimidate me.",
        "Todd: Then be smart at least. God, you need protection, and if you're not gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Well, Jessica is a human being. I know you guys want this baby.",
        "Brody: You do not get to pass yourself off as human.",
        "Ford: Fine.",
        "Brody: Don't talk about her. You forget she exists.",
        "Ford: That'd be easier if you weren't always in my face about it.",
        "Brody: I'm serious, Ford. There will not be a fight over this baby. I have spent the last day looking for a runaway girl who had two dads fighting over her. That will not happen to me and Jess.",
        "Ford: All right. Don't worry out it.",
        "Brody: Okay. Oh, that missing girl is Danielle Rayburn.",
        "Ford: Should that mean something to me?",
        "Brody: She's your little brother Nate's girlfriend. You have a idea where she might be?",
        "Ford: Nate and I barely speak. I didn't even know he had a girlfriend.",
        "Brody: You hear anything about Danielle, you call the station. Otherwise...",
        "[Door closes]",
        "James: You could be a father?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Okay, Hannah. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to skip dinner.",
        "Hannah: Aw, really?",
        "Marty: Yeah. I've got business to take care of.",
        "Hannah: Business?",
        "Marty: Nothing to worry about. I will let you know when I'm gonna be back. Are you gonna be okay here?",
        "Hannah: Yeah. I'll keep dinner warm, and we'll have it when you get back.",
        "Marty: Sounds good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know that this is James' necklace?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: And is this the bullet that you shot him with?",
        "Starr: I know it's weird, but he had that made. He says that it reminds him of me.",
        "Natalie: So he has a thing for you?",
        "Starr: Sort of, but I told him that I was with Cole and that was it, and when he finally got it, he took off the necklace and threw it at me.",
        "Natalie: James was here yesterday?",
        "Starr: Oh, no, no, no. This was a while ago.",
        "Natalie: Oh. So how did is necklace end up outside of Dani's window?",
        "Starr: It must have happened while I was looking for Dani.",
        "Natalie: So you carry this around with you?",
        "Starr: I figure that James is gonna want it back eventually.",
        "Natalie: You keep it with you.",
        "Starr: Well, yeah. I mean, not all the time. It just sort of happened. I know it sounds weird, but have you ever gotten stuck with something of some guy's? You don't mean to end up with it, but you do and you can't just throw it away.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Actually, I do.",
        "Starr: I'm really sorry that it's not a clue.",
        "Natalie: So, James didn't just drop this outside of Dani's window.",
        "Starr: No. No. No. It was definitely me. I dropped it. Can I have it back?",
        "Natalie: Call me if you hear from your sister.",
        "Starr: Sure.",
        "Natalie: Cole didn't seem very happy when he saw that necklace.",

        "Kelly: Why? You think being outside makes me a target?",
        "Dorian: These men protect us if Elijah shows up. Do not make their job any harder.",

        "Ross: You're not listening. Todd won't get Dani back.",
        "Eli: Of course, I'm not stupid. I will bring Danielle back to you once Todd pays. Then you can live your life and I'll ride off into the proverbial sunset.",
        "Ross: With Dani's trust fund.",
        "Eli: Well, you can provide that payment for me getting you custody of your daughter. I thought that's what you wanted.",
        "Ross: It is.",
        "Eli: Great. Then this works for everybody. All you need to do is play along. Got me? Now let's go find Danielle and get out of here.",

        "James: And it could be your baby?",
        "Ford: Like a completely slim chance, and he still shows up to threaten me about it.",

        "Ford: It doesn't matter.",

        "James: Who cares, man? That's just money.",
        "Ford: Well, it doesn't hurt, in case you haven't noticed. This kid is gonna be in a good home with 2 parents who care about it.",
        "James: Yeah, one of which is crazy cop. Look, I'm just saying, Bobby, you would make a good dad. And the Fords could be a good family, too.",

        "Brody: I needed someone to talk to.",
        "Natalie: You can talk to me.",

        "Natalie: At what?",
        "Brody: Lying to Jessica. Marty told me I should tell her the truth.",
        "Natalie: She would.",
        "Brody: She's probably right, but I--when I saw Jessica, I couldn't do I not completely. She's still freaking out about Ford being this baby's father. Dr. Wright put her on bed rest.",

        "Brody: Today. Her blood pressure's too high.",

        "Natalie: Are you kidding? It's a piece of cake. If I can hold it together to do that, you've got to stop talking to Marty.",
        "Brody: I would never tell her about you and me. Even if I did, she'd have to keep I confidential.",
