    "Recap": [
        "Dorian privately asks Jackie McNaughton for \"legal advice.\" And she reveals that she is not going to \"comply\" with what Clint wants just because he's promised to get Ray out of town so that she can keep custody of Langston. She remarks to Jack that she has worked too hard to hang onto the company and she won't let Clint get what he wants. Meanwhile, Nora, Antonio and Talia haul Ray down to the station after hearing that he is a murderer and that he may be connected to Carlo Hesser and what happened to Cristian Vega. John is determined to find the \"mysterious woman\" in Todd Manning's home. Addie encourages Blair to \"go forward\" with John. Todd and Marty are getting closer and ready to move out of town and leave the past behind them. She still has no clue that he raped her many years ago."

        "Cristian: The phone's still dead.",
        "Vanessa: Sometimes the lines can be out for days.",
        "Cristian: Let's just head to the airport and take the next flight to the U.S. It doesn't really matter where. We could always get a connection.",
        "Vanessa: We need to get out of here as soon as possible. We're not safe.",
        "Cristian: Okay, let's go. Is Lola ready?",
        "Lola: Ready.",
        "Cristian: Here, I'll take that. Let's call my brother from the airport.",
        "Vanessa: Hey, it's going to be okay. Ray will never find us in Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: I have never heard of Cristian Vega. And I have done nothing wrong.",
        "Antonio: We never suggested you had.",
        "Nora: We just need you to come down with us and answer some questions.",
        "Ray: Who are you?",
        "Nora: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm district attorney Nora Hanen. And these are Officers Sahid and Vega.",
        "Ray: Vega?",
        "Antonio: Cristian Vega is my brother.",
        "Nora: Could you come with us, please? Please?",
        "Ray: One moment. This is a -- this is a mistake. I will talk to you when I'm finished with these people. We are still going home to Colombia.",
        "Markko: Whoa, what's up with that?",
        "Starr: Did Dorian call the police or something?",
        "Markko: Do you think they'll stop Montez from taking away Langston?",
        "Langston: No, he's not under arrest. They just have to ask him some questions.",
        "Markko: Oh yeah, that would only get him out of the way for a few hours. And Dr. Lord wouldn't be down with that.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? Aunt Dorian's not going to be happy until he gives up completely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm sorry I missed your hearing.",
        "Dorian: Did you get any hint at all when I asked for this outfit and the pearls? Oh, I had to grovel to that stupid judge that gave Ray Montez custody of Langston.",
        "Blair: What did your lawyer say?",
        "Dorian: She is so fired. And the rest of the idiots, that law firm, they tell me I haven't got a chance against Judge Jenkins.",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm so sorry.",
        "Dorian: Don't be sorry, not for me. No, no, no, no. I've got a plan.",
        "Blair: Ah.",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Doorbell chimes]",
        "Jackie: Morning, I'm here to see the lovely Dr. Lord.",
        "Blair: Does your plan involve this known criminal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: FBI agent Lee Ramsey took it upon himself to shoot out the tires of the van carrying hostages Cole Thornhart and Marty Saybrooke. The driver lost control of the van, which resulted in it rolling over a cliff.",
        "[Loud crashing]",
        "John: Cole Thornhart was thrown free. His mother remained trapped inside when the van exploded.",
        "[Shouting]",
        "John: Because of the explosion it was not possible to make a positive I.D. on Marty Saybrooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, what do you think?",
        "Marty: Wow. I think right there.",
        "Todd: There it is.",
        "Marty: Thank you.",
        "Todd: For what?",
        "Marty: For making this day perfect.",
        "Todd: We have a lot more to do before we hit perfect.",
        "Marty: Yeah, like what?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I think that if we're going to have a future together we ought to figure out how it's going to work. Don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hi. One of the nurses told me you'd be here. She was your patient?",
        "Michael: Yeah. I was in surgery when she died. She fought really hard, and I guess I just wanted to say good-bye. Uh, you must have good reason for tracking me down here.",
        "John: You remember those x-rays I found in Ramsey's office?",
        "Michael: Yes. You're still concerned about the welfare of some woman who you've never met?",
        "John: She may not be a stranger anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Did you tell Nora that Ray was here?",
        "Markko: No, why?",
        "Cole: She showed up with Antonio Vega and his girlfriend. They took Montez down to the station.",
        "Markko: What, they arrested him?",
        "Langston: No, they just needed him to answer some questions about Cristian Vega.",
        "Starr: Do you think maybe John told them?",
        "Markko: No, no. I asked him to keep it to himself, just like you asked. I didn't even tell him Uncle Ray's name.",
        "Langston: So what did he say?",
        "Markko: Just that he would try to figure out what Dr. Lord was up to.",
        "Cole: I still can't believe that she didn't go ballistic when she found out about Montez and Mr. Buchanan.",
        "Starr: She was mad at Clint for a really long time. Clint didn't even know it until she took the company away from him.",
        "Langston: Dorian said she took the company for us, for all the Cramer women. I used to think it was cool. Now I wish she had never gone up against Clint Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dorian was about to adopt her foster daughter, Langston Wilde.",
        "Dallas: So she does have a heart.",
        "Clint: Well, I found the only living relative that Langston has, an uncle, and I convinced him to take custody of her.",
        "Dallas: Oh, I see.",
        "Clint: And so Langston's uncle is going to take her to his home in South America unless --",
        "Dallas: Dorian plays ball.",
        "Clint: Exactly. Dorian gets Langston back when I get my family company back. That's it. No other choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mr. McNaughton, please come in. Uh, Blair, yes indeed. This gentleman used to have some issues in his life, but he's worked them all through and he's turned his life around. He's now a legitimate businessman.",
        "Blair: Doing what?",
        "Jackie: I'm a consultant.",
        "Dorian: Yes, and right now he is consulting for me. Uh, please go in. You know, Cramer Enterprises.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Dorian: Bye-bye.",
        "Jackie: Nice digs. No wonder why you were in a hurry to get out of the slammer. See, it looks like you didn't need me, after all.",
        "Dorian: Oh, but I do need you. You see, there is -- um -- that other matter that we were discussing.",
        "Jackie: You foster child's uncle?",
        "Dorian: You told me to sleep on it. Okay, I slept on it. I haven't changed my mind. I want Ray Montez removed from Langston's life -- permanently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: Sam's down for his nap.",
        "Blair: Thank you, Mama. Thank you.",
        "Addie: I thought I heard Dorian come in.",
        "Blair: You did. You did, she's out of jail but she's having a meeting right now with Jackie McNaughton.",
        "Addie: Poor Dorrie. She's so upset about this mess with Langston. And Langston's upset because she might have to go away with her uncle. And Starr is upset because she's losing her best friend. And I'm upset because everybody else is upset. You may be the only one who's happy.",
        "Blair: Why do you say I'm happy?",
        "Addie: I'm your mother. I know when you're happy. Probably that handsome policeman you're sleeping with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You remember what you saw in those x-rays, Mike? It's kind of urgent.",
        "Michael: Yeah, you know what, John? Urgent is this. Urgent is saving the life of a friend who was shot and nearly bled to death.",
        "John: Who? What are you talking about?",
        "Michael: Rex Balsom. He was shot.",
        "John: I didn't know. I just -- I just got back into the country. I'm -- did they get the guy that shot him?",
        "Michael: He's in custody.",
        "John: How's Balsom doing?",
        "Michael: He made it through the surgery, but it's still touch and go.",
        "John: How's Natalie handling it?",
        "Michael: Well, you know, I don't even know if she knows.",
        "John: Yeah, I heard something about her being out of town. This is going to hit her hard. That must be why Bo wasn't in his office this morning.",
        "Michael: Yeah, he was there when it happened and he's been by his side ever since.",
        "John: Sorry, Mike.",
        "Michael: Oh, you know, it's just been a rough 24 hours.",
        "John: Hey, look, forget about it. There's nothing you can do --",
        "Michael: No, look, I remember the X-rays. Do you really think that you know who they belong to?",
        "John: I've got a theory. I just need to know if it's possible.",
        "Michael: Lay it on me.",
        "John: The injuries in those x-rays, is it possible they were sustained by someone who was trapped in a vehicle during an explosion?",
        "Michael: What kind of an explosion?",
        "John: One that destroyed the vehicle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: It's hard to think about -- thank you -- think about making plans for the future when I still know so little about my past.",
        "Todd: I thought you said you were okay with that.",
        "Marty: Well, yes. I made the decision not to learn the details of what happened to me. And I'm glad. But there's still so many things about my life that I don't know. You know, good things, ordinary things.",
        "Todd: Well, you know, I own a newspaper, so I could try to find out anything you need to know.",
        "Marty: Okay. Hey, are you going to sell that if or when we move away from here?",
        "Todd: You know, I don't know. I still have to decide about that.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "Todd: Speaking of decisions, you know Starr's going to have this kid soon. And if you and I are going to raise it, we have to decide on where. So to that end, there you are.",
        "Marty: You brought an atlas to a picnic?",
        "Todd: It happened to be in the car.",
        "Marty: Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: So there you go. Anywhere you want to live. Anywhere, as long as it's far away from here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: The injuries in the x-rays I was looking at weren't sustained in the kind of explosion you just described.",
        "Michael: You said there was an explosion. I'm assuming there was a fire. Did it consume the entire vehicle, or was it just in the front, just in the engine?",
        "John: The whole vehicle.",
        "Michael: Well, if a woman was trapped in a burning car, there wouldn't have been any x-rays to look at. I mean, the kind of heat generated by a fire like that would have incinerated her body.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I can't believe that you just said that to me.",
        "Addie: Come on, we're both adults here.",
        "Blair: But I haven't really said that much to you about John.",
        "Addie: You stay out all night with him. What are you doing, playing checkers? Honestly, Blair, I'm so happy that you've found somebody to play checkers with.",
        "Blair: Well, Mama, it's not like that. John and I are just friends.",
        "Addie: With benefits?",
        "Blair: Have you been talking with the kids, the teenagers?",
        "Addie: Why can't it turn into something more?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jackie: Once you start talking about permanent solutions, it's sort of the end of the line, if you get my drift.",
        "Dorian: Forgive me, Mr. McNaughton, but you seem to be the one who's not getting it.",
        "Jackie: Look, Clint Buchanan's a businessman, right? He must be willing to negotiate.",
        "Dorian: His terms are unacceptable. Do you get it? He says he can call off Montez and allow me to keep Langston but only if I sign Cramer Enterprises over to him.",
        "Jackie: So why are we talking about whacking Montez? You should be jumping at Buchanan's offer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Cristian Vega. And you never heard of him?",
        "Ray: I never heard of him. And I never seen him.",
        "Antonio: Can you explain why you were suddenly released from Plato prison?",
        "Ray: The authorities realized I was an innocent man.",
        "Antonio: Was there a new trial?",
        "Ray: It wasn't needed. My attorney gave all the documents to the judge who presided over the custody hearing. You should talk to him.",
        "Nora: And we will.",
        "Ray: Don't I get a phone call?",
        "Nora: Be my guest.",
        "Nora: Gee, wonder who he's going to call.",
        "Talia: He's giving us nothing.",
        "Antonio: Well, he's not the only one. Every request for information I've made to Plato prison has been denied.",
        "Nora: John said that place was totally corrupt.",
        "Antonio: Someone paid for Montez' release. And he doesn't want to give that someone up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: I need help. I'm at the police station.",
        "Clint: What are you doing there?",
        "Ray: They brought me in for questioning about some guy named Cristian Vega. He's missing.",
        "Clint: Do you know anything about that?",
        "Ray: No, I've never heard of the man.",
        "Clint: Well, you just sit tight. And for God's sake, don't say anything.",
        "Ray: I don't think so. This lady D.A. is kind of tough.",
        "Clint: Nora hauled you in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Go change into some dry clothes, mija.",
        "Cristian: That storm came out of nowhere.",
        "Vanessa: Sometimes the tropical storms can change directions quickly. We were lucky to get back here.",
        "Cristian: God, please, I just want to go home.",
        "Vanessa: Well, we're not going anywhere today. Maybe it will pass by tomorrow.",
        "Cristian: What, tomorrow? Sorry, sorry, it's not your fault.",
        "Vanessa: Look, there's nothing we can do. Except for wait and get out of these wet clothes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What if she was removed from the van before the explosion?",
        "Michael: So the injuries were caused by the crash and not the explosion?",
        "John: Right.",
        "Michael: I don't know. Can I get another look at the x-rays?",
        "John: Can't. The mayor confiscated them along with all my notes and my computer. I asked Bo to get them back, but he's got a lot on his mind right now.",
        "Michael: Okay, okay. Tell me exactly what happened to the vehicle.",
        "John: It went off the road, over a cliff. There was a big impact.",
        "Michael: Was she wearing a seat belt?",
        "John: No.",
        "Michael: Okay, if I remember, head injuries, multiple fractures, spinal injuries. That means she could have been thrown free or removed, but there's no way she got herself out of there.",
        "John: Is it possible she's still alive?",
        "Michael: Who is she? And how do you know so many details about it?",
        "John: I was there.",
        "John: I think Marty may still be alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What do you want me to do? Just close my eyes and point?",
        "Todd: No, you can keep your eyes open if you want. I've heard Seattle's a great place to live.",
        "Marty: No, that's too wet. But how do I know that? Maybe I've been there.",
        "Todd: Maybe.",
        "Marty: Isn't that weird? I don't even remember what my favorite food is.",
        "Todd: Well, now you can try anything you'd like and you can figure it out.",
        "Marty: Ah, that's true. I've been on such a bland doctor-ordered diet. What do we have?",
        "Todd: We have freshly-cut tomato, mozzarella, basil.",
        "Marty: Lovely.",
        "Todd: We have grapes, green style.",
        "Marty: Greenie, love it.",
        "Todd: We have cheese, moldy cheese.",
        "Marty: No, it's brie, brie cheese.",
        "Todd: Okay.",
        "Marty: See, I know that, too.",
        "Todd: And we have beans de jelly.",
        "Marty: Jelly beans?",
        "Todd: Yes, the best, best jelly beans money can buy.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm. You know, you spoil me.",
        "Todd: You deserve it.",
        "[Clearing throat]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: I found this t-shirt of Ray's that should fit you.",
        "Cristian: Thanks. How do you know he's not going to find you here?",
        "Vanessa: Well, we were very careful when we moved. None of Ray's contacts know we are here. But if we don't leave the country soon he will find us, eventually.",
        "Cristian: Well, you were right about not leaving today.",
        "Vanessa: I'm sorry. Ray is my problem, not yours.",
        "Cristian: He's my problem, too. I owe you for getting me out of prison. If you hadn't showed up when you did, I don't know, I could have died. I never would have seen my family -- or Sarah.",
        "Vanessa: With God's help, we're going to be safe and you'll be back with your Sarah soon.",
        "[Thunder]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ray: Excuse me; someone wants to speak with you.",
        "Nora: This is D.A. Hanen.",
        "Clint: Why the hell did you haul Montez in?",
        "Nora: To whom am I speaking?",
        "Clint: You know exactly who you're talking to. Now why are you questioning Montez about Cristian Vega?",
        "Nora: Excuse me. Guess what, Clint? Cristian Vega disappeared about the same time that you bought Montez out of prison. Now, I don't know if the two are related, so I wouldn't take that tone with me, Mr. Buchanan. And if you have a problem with the way I do my job, then maybe you shouldn't be living with the D.A.",
        "Nora: Mr. Montez, where were we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: It can't be good for Langston's uncle that he got picked up by the police, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah, but we don't know whether he's in trouble. They just kept asking him about Cristian Vega.",
        "Langston: My uncle said he didn't even know him.",
        "Markko: Great, so all we did was buy ourselves a little time until --",
        "Langston: No, it's okay. It's true. We all keep looking for something that's going to stop my uncle from taking me away to Colombia, but I don't think anything will.",
        "Starr: Guys, we can't just give up.",
        "Langston: No, but we can't just ignore the truth. I mean, my uncle and Dorian and the judge have probably fixed it so I'm not going to be here for you when the baby's born. This is their crap, not ours. I promised I'd be here for you.",
        "Starr: You will be here, okay? Aunt Dorian will find a way to stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Mr. McNaughton, won't you sit down?",
        "Dorian: Clint says that he can get Ray Montez to give up Langston. But he cannot guarantee that he can get Montez to do that, and the court has awarded Montez legal guardianship of Langston. So maybe Montez still wants to take her out of the country. Maybe Montez wants to blackmail me. And I can tell you something. I am not going to allow that to happen.",
        "Jackie: You know what? I'm starting to get the feeling that this is really all about something else.",
        "Dorian: Excuse me?",
        "Jackie: I deal with a lot of people, Doc. And no matter what they say, it's pretty clear when they're determined to get what they want. You, you have that look in your eye right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: You seem to be thinking with your head. And your head is telling you to keep this relationship casual. Those are just words, Blair. The heart doesn't deal in words. You listen to your heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: When did you come up with this theory?",
        "John: Mike, I saw Marty in that van, all right? She was badly injured. I wanted to get her out of there. But she wanted me to check on Cole first, which I did. I didn't think about this before, but if Ramsey had doubled back, if he was still in the area --",
        "Michael: This isn't an official investigation.",
        "John: No, it's an unofficial investigation, all right? The mayor wants me to back off. That's why this has to stay between you and me. And the last thing I want to do is to get Cole's hopes up.",
        "Michael: What about your hopes, John? I mean, what does that mean for you if Marty's still alive?",
        "John: Screw it, Mike -- I'm going to see it through to the end.",
        "Michael: John, you saw the van blow up then.",
        "John: There's no evidence that proves that Marty was in the van. If Ramsey found her, it's possible --",
        "Michael: Okay, so Ramsey pulled her from the vehicle, and then he brought her here, and then he's taking care of her himself? Come on, John.",
        "John: Hey, Mike, listen to me. Listen to me. He hired a nurse -- did you know that? He hired a nurse, and he moved her into that apartment that he got from Manning. And get this -- when Ramsey was killed, all right -- I find Manning in the apartment not an hour later.",
        "Michael: So Todd knows that Marty is there?",
        "John: All I know is now Manning's got a houseguest that he doesn't want to talk about, and he hired the same nurse at Ramsey had hired. That means something, Mike.",
        "Michael: Why would Todd want to take in Marty?",
        "John: I don't know, I can't figure out how he thinks. Maybe he thinks he can -- he can use her against somebody, use her against Cole, or Starr, or Blair.",
        "Michael: Or you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Marty laughs]",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Marty: Moose -- Moose's Tooth, Alaska.",
        "Todd: It's perfect. If Starr has a boy, we can name him Bullwinkle.",
        "Marty: Oh, no. No, no, it's chilly here in Llanview, and it's only October.",
        "Todd: Are you chilly now?",
        "Marty: Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Todd: No, really, let's get serious. Where are we going to live?",
        "Marty: I don't know.",
        "Todd: You've ruled out the north, obviously.",
        "Marty: Yes, it's too -- too cold, too damp.",
        "Todd: All right, where would you like to live, princess?",
        "Marty: How about boulder or Santa Fe or, I don't know, one of those?",
        "Todd: Where did you get those?",
        "Marty: I don't know. I don't know, but they sound beautiful, don't they?",
        "Todd: I don't know. Anywhere we go, it should be someplace neither of us have ever been, so we're in the same boat.",
        "Marty: All right, well -- I mean, I'm glad you convinced me that -- to let go of my past, and that my life doesn't have to be defined by it. But we're not going to be in the same boat until --",
        "Todd: Until what? I let go of my past?",

        "Blair: You're right, my heart and my head aren't on the same page these days.",
        "Addie: Otherwise why would you have married Todd so many times?",
        "Blair: Well, exactly, and that's why I'm being very careful with John.",
        "Addie: But if you're honest with yourself --",
        "Blair: John is more than a friend I'm sleeping with.",
        "Addie: Then do something about it.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Addie: What is it that Dorian says?",
        "Blair: Oh, God only knows.",
        "Addie: \"A Cramer woman never settles for less than she deserves.\"",

        "Jackie: I get the feeling that you want your girl and B.E., too.",
        "Dorian: C.E.",
        "Jackie: Oh, whatever. You know, I've been asking around, Doc. I know you and Clint Buchanan had an ugly break-up. Then he starts having problems with people coming after his business, and as it turns out, you were behind it all. And you won.",
        "Dorian: Yes, I did.",
        "Jackie: Hmm, now you had to cross a few lines to get what you wanted, and I know that some guy died falling through a skylight as collateral damage.",
        "Dorian: Hey, I had nothing to do with that.",
        "Jackie: No, no, no -- look, I'm not judging you, all right? You want to make an omelet, you've got to break a few eggs. But now, the egg you want broken is Clint Buchanan, because you don't want to see him win.",
        "Dorian: That's right -- I don't. Why should he have everything he wants? I worked hard for everything -- every single thing that I have ever had. And you know, he made one really bad mistake. He underestimated me. Big mistake, because somehow everything I did worked, and I managed to steal his precious company away from him.",
        "Jackie: You're a cold-blooded woman, Doctor -- and I like that. But are you a killer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: Here's my advice -- carpe diem. Seize the day.",
        "[Blair laughs]",
        "Addie: Everybody made fun of me because I made a list of all the things I've missed. Well, what was I supposed to do? Pretend I hadn't missed anything?",
        "Blair: Mama, I understand why you made your list. You were making up for the past.",
        "Addie: That's not the only reason I made the list, Blair. If my medication stops working, I could go back to being sweet, simple Addie again.",
        "Blair: No, Mama, don't even say that, don't.",
        "Addie: It's true. And I have to face it. We never know what the future is going to bring. That's why we have to make the most of every day. Life takes courage, sweetheart. That's what so wonderful and so frightening. We never know. That's why I take so many chances. Maybe it's time for you to take a chance.",

        "Michael: I know you feel guilty about what happened to Marty.",
        "John: That's not what this is about.",
        "Michael: Okay, but just think about one thing, all right? If Todd is holding Marty in that house, she's either got to be in such bad shape medically that it's going to take a lot more than a nurse to take care of her, or he's got her bound and chained and gagged, because otherwise, she would do everything in her power to get out of there and get to Cole and get to you, and let you know that she's still alive.",
        "John: Manning's stopping her.",
        "Michael: That's kidnapping and imprisoning. Why would Todd risk going to prison for the rest of his life?",
        "John: He's a lunatic -- he doesn't have to have a reason.",
        "Michael: I mean, I think you are grasping at straws here, buddy.",
        "John: Really?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "John: How about I kick down his door and find out?",
        "Michael: Yeah, how about that, that would be great. Then you'd just risk losing your career, losing your badge --",
        "John: So what? For her, it would be worth it.",
        "Michael: You know, not if you were wrong. Or, okay, say on the outside chance that you're right, and you don't handle it perfectly, Todd Manning will hide her so deep you will never find her.",
        "John: Thanks for your help, Mike. Hey, I'm sorry about your patient.",
        "Michael: It's done. Just don't set yourself up for disappointment,",

        "Ray: I don't have to talk to you.",
        "Nora: Yeah, you do. Sit down, Mr. Montez. When Cristian Vega was last seen at Plato prison -- sit down, Mr. Montez. When Cristian Vega was last seen at Plato prison, he was wearing a jumpsuit with your name on it.",
        "Ray: Wow. Well, I'm sorry for him. I never cared too much for that jumpsuit, but I don't know the man.",
        "Nora: Then I supposed you also don't know this man, Carlo Hesser, aka Mortimer Bern.",
        "Ray: Hmm.",
        "Nora: Hmm?",
        "Ray: Nope.",
        "Antonio: Senor Montez, you arrived in the United States on the same flight as a man named Jared Banks.",
        "Ray: That's right, uh -- that's right. But as the D.A. is aware, I -- I came here to conduct business with Clint Buchanan.",
        "Antonio: Is that true?",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Talia: And your sudden desire to obtain custody of your niece, Langston Wilde, that was just a side benefit to your trip?",
        "Ray: The court approved my request for custody. It was all perfectly legal.",
        "Talia: Okay, so you got out of prison and you went into business with Clint Buchanan, and then you won custody of your only living relative from Dorian Lord? You've had kind of an awesome week here in Llanview, eh, Senor Montez?",
        "Antonio: You knew about this man's connection to Clint Buchanan, and you chose to say nothing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: How did you hook up with a guy like Montez?",
        "Vanessa: Ray can be very charming. I had no idea what he was capable of, certainly not -- did you finish eating?",
        "Lola: Is it all right if I go to my room and listen to music?",
        "Vanessa: Sure, we're not leaving anytime soon.",
        "Lola: Is it nice living in America?",
        "Cristian: It is to me, but then again, I never really lived anywhere else.",
        "Lola: I've only lived in Colombia.",
        "Cristian: There are a lot of good people in Llanview. You'll be fine.",
        "Vanessa: She's lived a very sheltered life. I've tried to protect her as if she were my own daughter. In Llanview, Lola and I will only have each other.",

        "Starr: Oh, I wonder what's going on at the police station right now.",
        "Markko: Well, you know, I think if they start asking Mr. Montez questions, they'll find out that he's not such a great guy, and --",
        "Langston: Well, that scares me. I mean, what if he takes me away to South America and locks me in some basement somewhere?",
        "Cole: Langston, stop it. Stop it, right now. Look at me. Look at me -- this is wrong, and it's not going to happen, okay? You're going to be here for Starr when the baby is born. You're not going anywhere, okay?",
        "Markko: We all have to keep thinking that.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you know, I read someplace that if you picture yourself in the future someplace, anyplace, and you concentrate hard on it, that --",
        "Langston: Starr, I do, I do want to picture myself here. But it's going to take more than me just clicking my heels three times for that to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: It's really very simple. Ray Montez is a murderer, I want him to go away, and you know how to make people go away.",
        "Jackie: Well, I know a few guys. Maybe I could --",
        "Dorian: No, no, no, no. No maybes. Just do it, Jackie. It is okay, isn't it, if I call you Jackie?",
        "Jackie: Please.",

        "Jackie: Just as long as you realize that now that I've pocketed this, there's no going back.",
        "Dorian: Hmm.",
        "Addie: I just said good-bye to the man you had a meeting with. He sounds just like the man I called to get you out of jail.",
        "Dorian: Oh, you're mistaken. Besides which, I got myself out of jail.",
        "Addie: Then who was that man?",

        "Talia: I really don't think he knows anything about Cristian.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, let's hold him for 24 hours and maybe he'll change his story.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, that will give us a chance to touch base with John, since he's the one who put us onto this guy in the first place.",
