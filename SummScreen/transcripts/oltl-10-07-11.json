        "Tina goes searching frantically for her dog and has just gotten Cole to admit that he may still have feelings for her after they relive their history together. Alone with Cord, Clint lectures his son on how foolish he was in the past to have gotten involved with Tina and hoping that he knows never to do it again. But Cord inquires to his dad if his relationship with Viki is not so unlike Cord's with Tina. Clint at first does not listen but realizes that Cord may have a point regarding that. Tina goes to ask Viki if she can put out an ad for Tina's lost dog and also tells her she wants to get back with the family because she loves Viki and wants to be a better person. At first Viki does not buy a word of what her sister says. but she later realizes that she's given Todd many second chances and it may not be fair not to do the same for Tina. Meanwhile, when everybody is distracted, Tina's dog goes and \"talks\" to baby Liam. We \"hear\" their two voices while the dog informs the baby that she just found the papers that confirm that John is Liam's father instead of Brody. And Liam does not believe it until the dog goes to find her mommy assuming Tina has the document. Tina is then very grateful to have her sister, as well as the glimmer of hope of the love of her life, as well as her dog back. Jack goes to see Starr in jail and gloats to her and at that point, he reveals to her how he got the cops to believe his lie that he saw original Todd kill Victor. Blair revives Todd and they relive their history together of falling in love."

        "Ford: What is this?",
        "Jessica: It's a paternity test. It's Liam's paternity test.",
        "Ford: I-I don't understand. Liam's paternity test should say that Brody's the father. Why does this say John?",
        "Jessica: I have no idea.",
        "Ford: Then I guess I don't understand. Where did you get this?",
        "Jessica: David Vickers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Any word on Uncle Todd? Mom, don't worry. Uncle Bo and -- and John will find him soon.",
        "Viki: God, I hope so. Natalie...are -- are you absolutely certain that he was hurt?",
        "Natalie: I can't say for sure, but...",
        "Viki: But it was his blood on the docks by Irene's body?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Please take care of my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd, don't! Come on! Don't die on me now! Come on! Don't you dare leave your kids alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Please be okay, Dad. Please. Please be okay.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Jack: How's life, jailbird?",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. You don't want to talk to me? Huh? Oh, that's fine. You don't have to talk. Just read this... and weep. Scarface is going down, Sis. Think you're going down with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You don't get to do this to me, not again. Come on! Wake up!",
        "Todd: [Weakly] Ow.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God! [Sighs]",
        "Todd: What the hell's the matter with you?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: The Sun? No, why? \"Scarface\"? Who wrote this?",
        "Viki: Look at the byline.",
        "Natalie: [Sighs]",
        "Jack: How does it feel to be fooled by your own dad?",
        "Starr: How did you manage this?",
        "Jack: I'm the publisher's son, remember?",
        "Starr: These are all lies!",
        "Jack: It's the truth. Scarface killed Dad and our grandma, and he's on the run, thanks to you. But, hey, if you want some bedtime story about how you're innocent until proven guilty, go read Aunt Viki's rag.",
        "Viki: Jack is absolutely out of control.",
        "Natalie: What else is new? I mean, you got another reason why you're stressed out. Tina?",
        "Viki: I can handle my sister. I'm much more concerned about your relationship with your sister.",
        "Natalie: Why be concerned about something that doesn't exist?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: David Vickers is back in town? I thought he was off shooting some movie.",
        "Jessica: No, no, no. Sorry. Not David Vickers the man. David Vickers the dog.",
        "Ford: Of course. Is that a new breed or something?",
        "Jessica: No, my Aunt Tina, she has a dog. She named it David Vickers. Actually, she's pretty cute.",
        "Ford: Your Aunt Tina?",
        "Jessica: No, no, Killer. The dog.",
        "Ford: So, David Vickers the dog...is a girl?",
        "Jessica: Okay, it's a long story. The point is, my Aunt Tina's staying with us. She brought her dog, David Vickers. Last night, I tripped over her dog carrier, and I found that.",
        "Ford: How -- how did your aunt and her dog end up with Liam's paternity test?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. But now I've got it, and I don't know what in the world I'm gonna do with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Yes. Jessica did come over last night and apologize. She even watched Liam for me when I got called into work.",
        "Viki: Well, that's progress, isn't it?",
        "Natalie: Yes, it's a step in the right direction, but it's not like we're gonna be throwing on our jammies and scarfing down ice cream anytime soon.",
        "Viki: Honey, I truly believe that you and Jessica will mend this relationship, okay? You're sisters. You will do this.",
        "Natalie: Oh, well, good. That means you and Tina should be hugging by suppertime.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, let's not get crazy.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs] All right, Mom. I got to get ready for work.",
        "Viki: All right, my darling. I love you.",
        "Natalie: I love you, too. Okay, Liam. Just sit tight. Mommy's gonna go take a shower, okay? Okay.",
        "Liam: [Coos]",
        "David Vickers: [As Tina] Afternoon, chubby cheeks.",
        "Liam: Back at you, fleabag.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: No, Pa, you are not interrupting anything.",
        "Tina: Uh, yeah, you know, I...lost an eyelash, and Cord was just helping me.",
        "Clint: He's trying to get it out with his lips?",
        "Cord: [Sighs]",
        "Tina: Clint, how could you even think that? Look -- I -- look, y-you know, David Vickers, my dog, is -- is missing, and I-I-I've been so -- so distraught over it, and, um, well, C-Cord was comforting me because he's such a -- such a gentleman.",
        "Clint: So, what is your problem? Your eye or your dog?",
        "Tina: Both, all right? You know, and I don't need an Asa-type interrogation right now, all right? Look, my, uh, dog, David Vickers, is missing here somewhere in Llanview, and I'd be, uh...",
        "Cord: [Sighs]",
        "Tina: Cord? Can we...continue this at a later date?",
        "Cord: We'll see.",
        "Tina: Of course. Well, I have to resume my search for David Vickers. [Chuckles nervously] You know, 'cause, the, uh, the last time she pulled a stunt like this, well, as it turned out, she was in a very delicate condition, and, you know, I am not birthing any more babies.",
        "Cord: Pa, before you say anything --",
        "Clint: Just tell me you're not sleeping with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Can I get a statement?",
        "Starr: I can't deal with this right now, Jack.",
        "Jack: What? Are you too busy trying to get a new plan to prove I lied about Scarface killing Dad?",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "Jack: Yeah, that last one was an epic fail. If I were you, I wouldn't send your boyfriend to do your dirty work. He's not cut out for it.",
        "Starr: Well, you're not cut out for journalism. If you were, you would have known that Tom\u00e1s already confessed to killing Irene.",
        "Jack: Tom\u00e1s' confession is bogus. The Sun's sources at the LPD say they have evidence that puts Scarface at the scene of Grandma's murder.",
        "Starr: \"Grandma\"? That's what you're calling the woman that tried to blow me up?",
        "Jack: Look, all I know is Scarface killed her and Tom\u00e1s is taking the rap. Scarface knows it's not gonna fly, so he took off running, and he left you holding the bag. Scarface, your so-called father, doesn't care about you or anyone else. He only cares about himself because he's coward.",
        "Starr: You don't know anything about him! That coward took a bullet for us!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know, if you let me nod off, at least then you'll finally be rid of me.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Don't tempt me. Besides, I've...never been rid of you, even when I thought that I was. You've always been a part of my life ever since you walked in Rodi's that night and somebody played that stupid Louis Armstrong song.",
        "Todd: Nat \"King\" Cole.",
        "Blair: It was Louis Armstrong.",
        "Todd: It was Nat \"King\" Cole. Nat \"King\" Cole. How could you forget something like that?",
        "Blair: Oh, man. Would you turn that off, please?",
        "Todd: Told you so.",
        "Blair: Okay. I'll give you that one. What else do you remember?",
        "Todd: Every little bit.",
        "Blair: I thought you weren't sentimental.",
        "Todd: I'm not. Just have an infallible memory. I'm cursed to remember every awful detail.",
        "Blair: Do you ever wish you could forget?",
        "Todd: Used to all the time, before my mom tried to take away all my memories. Come on. You never thought about it? Wouldn't it be great? You have a big eraser and you just get rid of all the bad stuff?",
        "Blair: Well...if I got rid of all of the bad stuff --",
        "Todd: Right. You wouldn't have any memories left of me.",
        "Blair: If I got rid of all the bad stuff, then all the good stuff wouldn't be as meaningful. It finally hit me tonight like a ton of bricks that it's over -- utterly over. You know, the man that I told you about that I was willing to kill myself for -- well, he went back to his wife. He made the safe choice.",
        "Todd: That's rough. But I can top it. The woman I love, she broke up with her safe choice, and she still doesn't want anything to do with me. I had the ring out, everything, the whole deal. Totally turned me down.",
        "Blair: Well, you win. Most pathetic newcomer.",
        "Todd: I don't understand. Is that a good memory or a bad memory?",
        "Blair: The loser of the most pathetic contest is gonna buy the winner a soda over here at the deli. You want to go?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I guess that's why they call you Miss Congeniality, huh?",
        "Blair: A good memory... because before I ran into you that night, I thought I was all alone in the world. And after that night...I didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: Well, I'm gonna head over to the office.",
        "Clint: Head over to the office when we're done.",
        "Cord: Oh, I'm sorry. This conversation ended, you know, when you started asking me about my sex life.",
        "Clint: I asked you one question. I want an answer.",
        "Cord: It's none of your business.",
        "Clint: Oh, God. It's true.",
        "Cord: No. [Sighs] Actually, it is not true. I-I'm not sleeping with Tina. Happy now?",
        "Clint: Hell, no. This is worse. You're falling for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hi, uh...oh, um. May I come in? Tina...",
        "Tina: Yeah, boy, I love what you've done with the place. Oh, are those, uh, are those plants new?",
        "Viki: They're fake. I have a lot of work to do.",
        "Tina: Yeah, well, I'm about to make your day a lot easier, 'cause, boy, do I have a story for you.",
        "Viki: Really? What story?",
        "Tina: David Vickers... is still missing. A-and I know you may not realize this, but she has a huge Twitter following. I mean, just like that snake that got away from the zoo? And so if you put her on the front page, oh, you would sell tons of papers.",
        "Viki: No, Tina. You just want me to help you find your dog.",
        "Tina: Viki, please!",
        "Viki: Why would I lift one finger to help you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hey, you a present for me?",
        "David Vickers: Sorry, sweetie. I'm already taking care of one human, and she's a handful. I'm here on business. Are you Liam?",
        "Liam: Who wants to know?",
        "David Vickers: The Princess David Vickers.",
        "Liam: Well, that's a lot of name for a little dog.",
        "David Vickers: Not to mention it doesn't really do me justice. In case you couldn't tell, I'm a bitch.",
        "Liam: Oh. That's what my mom keeps calling my aunt. What's it mean?",
        "David Vickers: Different things to different people. But I'm afraid time is short, and we need to talk, dog to baby.",
        "Liam: What about?",
        "David Vickers: I have news, and it's not good.",
        "Liam: Ooh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You're probably jumping the gun a little bit. There's no way to tell if this is real or fake or not, right? So, we don't really know what we're dealing with here.",
        "Jessica: Maybe. Maybe it's another one of my Aunt Tina's schemes. We all know she's got a million of them.",
        "Ford: Look, I-I don't know this woman at all, but what could she possibly have to gain by screwing with Liam's paternity?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I don't know what's going on in that woman's brain. And frankly I don't see the upside of it, either. But it is better than the alternative.",
        "Ford: Which is?",
        "Jessica: That test is legit.",
        "Ford: But a DNA test already proved that Brody was Liam's father.",
        "Jessica: And another DNA test proved that Brody was Ryder's father, but that DNA test was manipulated. And maybe this one is manipulated, too. Or maybe it's the real deal. You know, maybe John is Liam's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: [Groans] You know, I-I think a lot about that night.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Todd: I do. I think I got a bum rap. I think you were way, way more pathetic than I ever was.",
        "Blair: Oh, this coming from somebody who couldn't get past his own misery. No, you had to wallow in it.",
        "Todd: Right. Says the woman who drank herself into a stupor every time Max Holden made her feel bad about herself, which was just about every time she even --",
        "Blair: Okay, you know what? I think you can go to sleep now.",
        "Todd: I'm just saying. There's more to me than self-pity, don't you think?",
        "Blair: Mm. Self-loathing. I'm just saying.",
        "Todd: The stables. That ring any bells?",
        "Blair: Tell me. What are you afraid of? Okay. Well, maybe you could do... two things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Did you hear that, Jack? Our dad has been shot.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Right. Nice try, though. First you send your stupid boyfriend after me, and now this? Trying to trick me did not work before. Trying to make me feel guilty is not going to work now.",
        "Starr: Why feel guilty if you didn't do anything?",
        "Jack: Oh, I told you. It's not working.",
        "Starr: It's not a trick, Jack! Ask T\u00e9a! She's the one that told me about it! Dad went to confront Irene --",
        "Jack: You mean kill her.",
        "Starr: He went to give her back something that she wanted so that she would leave our family in peace. But instead, Irene shot him, and then Tom\u00e1s killed Irene in order to save Dad.",
        "Jack: I still don't buy it.",
        "Starr: I don't care, because he might not have even been there if you didn't put him in prison for something that he didn't even do! And if our father dies, that's on you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Does it hurt?",
        "Todd: Bullet wound? Nah. It's like acupuncture.",
        "Blair: You're a survivor.",
        "Todd: You don't need to tell me. I was married to you, lived to tell the tale.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. You were no walk in the park. It's not like you swept me off my feet or anything. You want to marry me? You're -- you're sure? You -- you really want to marry me?",
        "Todd: That was my mother's. And I was saving it for, uh... well, you know. Diamond's real. Well...",
        "Blair: [Laughs] We did it. Whoo. How do you feel?",
        "Todd: The same, only weirder.",
        "Blair: Well, we did what we had to do.",
        "Todd: No, I did what I had to do. I was only marrying you because I thought you were pregnant, but you weren't pregnant. Tina told me you were just after my money.",
        "Blair: Tina.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: [Scoffs] Look, I-I know a missing dog isn't exactly...carmageddon.",
        "Viki: Carmageddon wasn't even carmageddon.",
        "Tina: [Sighs] Okay. But, you know, people react to animals in danger, right, like -- like beached whales.",
        "Viki: Absolutely not!",
        "Tina: But, Viki, we are sisters!",
        "Viki: Ah, only when it suits you, Tina. Tell me something. Were you my sister the last time you showed your face in town? Did you lift one finger when Tess locked Natalie in the basement?",
        "Tina: Viki, that was three years ago. A-and you're so -- how can you hold that against me?",
        "Viki: Because I am a mother. You should try it sometime. CJ and Sarah might appreciate that.",
        "Tina: Boy, you sure know how to hit below the belt. Look, I know I could have handled that situation better, but Tess was blackmailing me.",
        "Viki: Well, of course, she was blackmailing you. Someone is always blackmailing you, because you are always doing something deplorable! You always put yourself first, ahead of everybody, even people you claim to love. It's no wonder that Cord has washed his hands of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: What I'm feeling for Tina is -- is -- is...messy... is the best way I know how to put that. [Sighs] There's something about her. I-I have just never been able to let go of her, a-and I don't know I-if -- maybe I never will be able to.",
        "Clint: Well, try, son.",
        "Cord: [Sighs]",
        "Clint: Look, I know that Tina has given me two terrific grandchildren.",
        "Cord: Well, I'm glad you remember that.",
        "Clint: But she's a walking calamity! She brought down a monarchy, for God's sake!",
        "Cord: You think I don't know that? Hell, that was my life! I-I remember all of it! But there is still that -- that bond between us! You should know that better than anyone. Come on. No matter how much distance, how much time that has come between you, you and Viki have had the same kind of connection.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Look, aren't you just being a tad harsh here?",
        "Viki: No. Because, you see, there is absolutely nothing that I wouldn't do to protect my children.",
        "Tina: From me? What about from Todd or -- or, uh, Victor?",
        "Viki: What about them?",
        "Tina: How many times have they put my children, your children, even their own children in danger? Yeah, but still, no matter what crime they commit, you just open them back into your life with open arms. Why? I mean, why do my brothers get a free pass...and not me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: Hold up. You, a dog, have bad news for me?",
        "David Vickers: Sorry, sweetie. Bad news is bad news no matter who it comes from.",
        "Liam: Oh, this ought to be good. What is it? Heart worm?",
        "David Vickers: Your parents. They're not who you think they are.",
        "Liam: What are you -- wait a second. You telling me I'm adopted?",
        "David Vickers: I'm saying your dad isn't Brody Lovett. It's some guy named John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Maybe you should, uh, show this to John.",
        "Jessica: How can I show this to John, after everything that Natalie has put him through with Liam? I mean, I am not gonna be the one to pull the rug out from underneath him again.",
        "Ford: So you're just gonna sit on this?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I almost told Brody. And then I didn't.",
        "Ford: Well, why didn't you? Uh, one word about this, you can blow Brody and Natalie out of the water. This is it. You want to get even with Natalie and Brody, the bomb doesn't get any bigger than this. You drop this bomb, and everything they want -- their family, their marriage -- doesn't happen.",
        "Jessica: You make me sound heartless.",
        "Ford: Not heartless. Just heartbroken. And human. There must be some part of you that's dying to hurt them with this.",
        "Jessica: Then why haven't I used it yet?",
        "Ford: You tell me.",
        "Jessica: Because...this is about more than just my hurt feelings, okay? This is a baby's life. And Brody's. [Sighs] He has gotten everything that I couldn't give him with Ryder. Liam makes him whole. How can I take that away from him?",
        "Ford: Wait, so that's your decision? You're just -- you're just gonna sit on this for Brody's sake?",
        "Jessica: You sound like you don't believe me.",
        "Ford: I-I just think you're leaving out half the equation... because if this test is real and the truth comes out, Natalie and Brody are gonna break up, and she's gonna go back to Liam's father. And I think the real reason why you don't want this to come out is because you don't want her to have the happy ending that she wants with John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liam: John McBain? The copper? You got to be kidding me!",
        "David Vickers: Yeah, your mother knows him intimately, if you get my drift.",
        "Liam: What you saying about my mama?",
        "David Vickers: Hey, don't shoot the messenger! I just thought you should know.",
        "Liam: Hey, you're full of it. Brody's my dad. He sings me songs. He tucks me in. And when it comes to burping, he knows my sweet spot.",
        "David Vickers: Even so...",
        "Liam: Why should I believe you, Vickers? You're nothing but a mangy mutt.",
        "David Vickers: Well, look who's talking. You barely have teeth.",
        "Liam: You come in here with your fleas and your ticks and your groundless accusations --",
        "David Vickers: I have proof!",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah? Where is it? Don't tell me. You ate it.",
        "David Vickers: It's at home, but I'll get it. Then you'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: I mean, why do you hold me to one standard and my brothers to another?",
        "Viki: I don't know.",
        "Tina: Oh, my gosh. Hold the presses. [Laughs] Oh, I have got your headline. You see, \"Llanview mourns the passing of the town know-it-all. City safe for idiots.\"",
        "Viki: I never called you an idiot.",
        "Tina: No, but you think it, don't you? Well, you're wrong about that. You're wrong about a lot of things. Like, I didn't come here just for Victor's money.",
        "Viki: Oh, Tina, please. Why else?",
        "Tina: Viki, I came here for you, because I knew you would be in a tailspin after the loss of our brother. Viki, I knew you still needed me, just like I still need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: This is not about Viki and me. It's about you and the human wrecking ball.",
        "Cord: From my perspective, this is about a father and a son who have had a very complicated history with two very... unforgettable sisters.",
        "Clint: Oh, Viki and Tina share DNA. That's it. You will never see Viki plotting a coup or stealing jewels.",
        "Cord: All right, two seconds here, all right? Just -- just forget about the shenanigans.",
        "Clint: All of them? That's a tall order.",
        "Cord: Please, give me two seconds. Just -- just focus on the connection. How many times have you broken up with Viki only to find yourselves back together again? It's the exact same thing with me and Tina.",
        "Clint: I told you, we are not talking about Viki and me.",
        "Cord: Why not? Come on. Look at it, Pa. We are the same way. No matter how many times we've tried to start our lives over, no matter how many times we -- we've tried to get involved with somebody else, we always found that nobody has had a command over our hearts like these two women. What I'm going through with Tina is exactly the same thing that you are going through with Viki.",
        "Clint: I am not \"going through\" anything with Viki!",
        "Cord: No?",
        "Clint: No!",
        "Cord: Would you like to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: My motives for marrying you, they may have been a little mixed at first.",
        "Todd: Right. Only 99% money-grubbing, the other 1% was status-seeking.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. I mean, it worked out. I mean, look what came out of it, right?",
        "Todd: The first time I held Starr was the first time I ever felt alive.",
        "Blair: I wish I could have been there.",
        "Todd: What, to see me almost drop her? I was not exactly a natural.",
        "Blair: You did the best you could.",
        "Todd: I wanted so much for her. I want my daughter to be alive. I want her to be healthy. I want her to...play on the swings and get a dog and go to the Junior Prom. I-I want her to graduate from college, meet some guy who's not even remotely good enough for her, and... be the president of the United States of America.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? It turns out you didn't dream big enough for Starr, because she is gonna surpass all of your dreams. You just wait and see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If Scarface got himself plugged, it is not my fault! It's yours, all right? He would not be free if you didn't bust him out of jail.",
        "Starr: He wouldn't have been in jail in the first place if you hadn't lied to the police! Now he's on the run, and he's wounded, and he can't even go to the hospital, or else he'll get arrested!",
        "Jack: He deserves to get arrested. He's guilty.",
        "Starr: Guilty is how you're gonna feel if our father dies.",
        "Jack: He is not my father. He killed my father. I heard it happen exactly how it came out on Shaun's voicemail.",
        "Starr: How do you know about Shaun's voicemail?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Starr: The police haven't made that public. How do you know about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You still need me?",
        "Tina: Of course, I do.",
        "Viki: So, this -- this is not just about the disappearance of your dog?",
        "Tina: Well, um... I actually just came from kind of an...awkward moment with Cord.",
        "Viki: What happened?",
        "Tina: Well, he laid into me just, you know, like you did, and then we started to reminisce, and... well, one thing led to another, and then we nearly...",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Tina: ...Kissed.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God.",
        "Tina: Oh, but you'll be happy to know that Clint interrupted us. But if he hadn't, oh, something would have happened. I just know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: What do you mean? Would I like to what?",
        "Cord: Would you like to have a shot at another relationship with Viki?",
        "Clint: What are you talking about? Now, why would I try and fix something that's not broken?",
        "Cord: Yeah, but it isn't... humming along the way it could be, right?",
        "Clint: Viki and I manage very well, just like you and Tina do -- apart.",
        "Cord: Pa, you can't deny the fact that --",
        "Clint: Cord, you're a grown man, and you've got a good head on your shoulders. But you have got a Tina-sized blind spot. And I swear, just as you're standing in front of me, if you start up again with Tina, you are the one who's gonna get hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself? Come on. You and Cord have barely spoken for years.",
        "Tina: Yeah, which is why I have to strike while the iron is hot! Look -- look, I know there's no guarantee here, but shouldn't I at least give it a try?",
        "Viki: But your relationship with Cord, it's --",
        "Tina: I know, I know, I know. It doesn't have the best track record. But, you know, when I'm with him... I-I make the right choices. He brings out the best in me, and that's -- that's what I want to be. My best.",
        "Viki: We would all like to see that.",
        "Tina: And I just know that if I could make things work with Cord, I could make things work with you. I could, Viki. Look, look, I know I have made a total mess of things! I have neglected my family! I've been unfair to them! I have gone in search of fame and -- and fortune, and everything I left behind just went straight to hell.",
        "Viki: I'm glad you realize that.",
        "Tina: I do. But I'm here...now. So, please -- please tell me it is not too late, 'cause if you tell me there's a chance, even just the smallest, smallest, little chance that we can be sisters, then I... I will make it happen... because as God as my witness, I will never leave this family in the lurch again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't understand. Starr's doing so well. And Jack...",
        "Blair: Oh, Jack -- you just -- you got to give him some time.",
        "Todd: I'll give him all the time in the world. It won't make up for what I did. I thought I was getting rid of Max Holden's kid. Turns out, I was getting rid of our kid.",
        "Blair: That was the worst thing you ever did to me, Todd. You gave my baby away, and then you brought it back. But you didn't care about me at all. You didn't care how much I was hurting. All you cared about was whether or not I found out what kind of monster you were... [Voice breaking] The kind that would take...an -- an innocent baby and get rid of it, because he couldn't raise another man's child!",
        "Todd: That was the worst thing I ever did to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: The only way that you could possibly know is if... you were there. And you were there...that day that Shaun came to pay his respects.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I was. But where are you going with this?",
        "Starr: You were listening! You heard Shaun tell me word for word what was on that voicemail! That's -- that's how you were able to go the police and say that you suddenly remembered what happened at T\u00e9a's place. But you weren't there. You never heard Victor get shot! You just told the police exactly what you heard Shaun tell me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Tina... you're right. I have given my brothers countless second chances, and that's not fair to you. If you really want to mend this relationship, then so do I.",
        "Tina: Oh, Viki. [Sighs] That is the best news I've heard in a long time. Oh, does that also mean you're gonna put David Vickers on the front page?",
        "Viki: No. That I will not do.",
        "Tina: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: Thanks for the advice, Pa.",
        "Clint: You're welcome. Are you gonna take it?",
        "Cord: Yes. No. Uh... I don't know.",
        "Clint: Oh, Cord.",
        "Cord: I don't know what's gonna happen with Tina. Maybe nothing.",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah? What are the odds of that?",
        "Cord: Look, whatever happens, I promise you, I will go into it with my eyes wide open.",
        "Clint: Son, you could have eyes in the back of your head, and that woman would still blind-side you.",
        "Cord: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Viki, come on. Can't you find it in your heart to help find a helpless missing dog?",
        "Viki: Yes. I can. But she's not missing.",
        "David Vickers: [Barks]",
        "Tina: Oh! Oh! Sweetheart! Oh, David Vickers, oh, don't you ever run away from me again! Oh! Sweetie. Oh, I missed you so much. [Smooching]",
        "Viki: Why don't you put her in her carrier, and then she won't run away again?",
        "Tina: That's a very good idea, isn't it, David Vickers? Okay, let's do that. Oh, I'm so glad you're back. Here, sweetheart. Come here. There you go. Right in there, okay? Oh. [Chuckles] [Sighs] This day just keeps getting better and better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Jessica... I-I've been exactly where John is -- in the dark about a son who might be mine.",
        "Jessica: So...you'd show John the test?",
        "Ford: Probably. But I'm not the one who found it.",
        "Jessica: [Sighs]",
        "Ford: What you do and why you do it is up to you.",
        "Jessica: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Admit it! You didn't hear Dad with Victor! You got all of your information from listening to Shaun and me, and you used it to get Dad arrested and shot!",
        "Jack: So what if I did? It's not like you can prove it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: How you feeling?",
        "Todd: Peachy.",
        "Blair: Good.",
        "Todd: Long trip down memory lane has done wonders for my soul.",
        "Blair: You tired?",
        "Todd: Would it matter? Come on. I close my eyes now, I'd have nightmares. Tell me -- tell me you didn't tell the kids bedtime stories like this when I was gone.",
        "Blair: Come on. Our kids -- like their parents, they like horror stories.",
        "Todd: Speak for yourself. I like a fairy tale now and then.",
        "Blair: Well, those stories never actually sounded, um, authentic coming from me.",
        "Todd: Well, that's because you don't really believe. But I do.",
        "Blair: Todd, t-t-that's bad luck!",
        "Todd: We make our own luck, right? Right now, all I care about is making you happy. It's like what I told Addie.",
        "Blair: What -- what -- what was that? That you were gonna shower me with gold?",
        "Todd: Just a preview of what our life is to come.",
        "Blair: Oh! [Laughs] I thought fairy tales were supposed to have happy endings.",
        "Todd: Who says this one's over?"
