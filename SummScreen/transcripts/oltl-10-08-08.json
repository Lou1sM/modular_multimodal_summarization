        "John: Hey.",
        "Blair: Well, hey, yourself. I, uh, got your message. Thanks for letting me know you're back. Is this a bad time?",

        "[Knock on window]",
        "Natalie: Did you -- did you see him? I mean, have you heard any news? Is he out of surgery?",
        "Tess: Oh, I'm sorry, Natalie. Rex is dead.",

        "Manager: You're late.",
        "Gigi: So fire me.",
        "Manager: What did you just say?",
        "Gigi: Look, if you want to fire me, fine. I'm late -- it's not the end of the world.",
        "Manager: Hey, Gigi, I'm sorry. It's okay. I heard about it on the news this morning, but I forgot. Brody? I know he shot someone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Thanks for letting me know, Doctor.",
        "Officer: Commish, the therapist that you got for the lieutenant, due any minute.",
        "Bo: Lieutenant, you're facing murder charges.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: I'm so sorry.",
        "Adriana: I can't believe this. Not Rex.",
        "Layla: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Please, come on in.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "John: I'm glad you came by. Uh, what do you got there?",
        "Blair: Oh, just a little something something I picked up for you at the farmers market. You, um, jet lagged?",
        "John: No. A little, actually, yeah. I was, um, I was just doing some work, but I can't do anymore until some information comes in.",
        "Blair: Did you find our guy?",
        "John: Yeah, I got a good lead on Cris and I turned it over to Antonio and Talia. They're on it.",
        "Blair: Good.",
        "John: How are you?",
        "Blair: I'm okay, you know, it was, um, actually, it's been very busy since you left.",
        "John: So I heard. Cole told me about Langston. What's on your mind?",
        "Blair: I missed those blue eyes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I don't know, when a divorced man's still wearing his wedding ring, it makes one wonder if he really is ready to let go of his past.",
        "Todd: I just said I was, didn't I? I'm not looking back.",
        "Marty: I'm not saying it's easy or you have to rush. But, hey, if it's true, if Blair divorced you and took the kids and ran off into the sunset with John McBain, the man you hate most in the world -- I'm just asking, how much more punishment are you willing to take?",
        "Todd: Well, here's the thing. I can't take it off.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm, why?",
        "Todd: It's stuck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: He hung in 'til morning. He said good-bye to everyone except you, of course. And then he, um, he passed away right before breakfast.",
        "Natalie: You're lying.",
        "Tess: Well, I'll turn the monitor on for you. You know, it's all over the news. Everybody's still at the hospital. I rushed home because I knew that you would want to know about it. The funeral's on Friday. I'll be sure to send your regrets.",
        "Natalie: He really -- he really died? He's really dead?",
        "Tess: It's a shame. He was different, you know? I'm really going to miss him.",
        "Natalie: You said good-bye to him?",
        "Tess: Well, I -- I didn't stay for long. It was hard, you know, the whole ICU thing. It kind of reminded me of Nash. But Roxy did tell me that he opened up his eyes long enough to ask for you.",
        "Natalie: No, no.",
        "[Natalie sobs]",
        "Natalie: Oh, Rex, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I couldn't be there for you. Oh, my God, Rex. I'm never going to see him again.",
        "Tess: Yeah, it's a rotten feeling, isn't it? Somebody you love and knowing that you're never going to them again? God. Gotcha!",
        "[Tess laughs]",
        "Tess: It's great. I really had you going there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I hit Rex? Shane?",
        "Bo: Shane's fine, but Balsom's in critical condition. I just got off the phone with the hospital. He's been in post-op for -- for quite a while. He's not responding.",
        "Jared: Uh, excuse me, Bo? Can I have a word?",
        "Bo: Not now, Banks.",
        "Jared: Look, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't really important.",
        "Bo: Keep him cuffed. I'll be right back.",
        "Officer: You all right, Lieutenant?",
        "Brody: I'm fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: What happened up there on that mountain?",
        "Gigi: Brody -- he just lost it and the gun went off.",
        "Manager: Something to do with being in Iraq? That's rough -- watching your boyfriend, the father of your kid, unspool.",
        "Gigi: Brody is not Shane's father, Rex is. And I'm not with Brody, I'm with Rex.",
        "Manager: Then what are you doing here? Why aren't you at the hospital? The radio said he might die.",
        "Gigi: I can't go over there.",
        "Manager: Well, forget this place. I'll get someone to cover for you.",
        "Gigi: No, I've got to stay here. I've got to keep busy.",
        "Manager: Why?",
        "Gigi: Because Rex's bitch of a wife won't let me anywhere near him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: You should get some rest.",
        "Adriana: No, I can't, not until Rex is off the ventilator and breathing on his own.",
        "Layla: Has he come around again?",
        "Adriana: No. I keep hoping that he'll wake up and look at me like he used to, like he loved me. Before when he woke up, he just looked, I don't know, frustrated.",
        "Layla: He had a breathing tube down his throat.",
        "Adriana: That wasn't it. He was looking for Gigi. I know he was. Do you think I'm wrong to keep her away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Gigi: Oh, don't tell me he refused to go to school.",
        "Marcie: Shane refuse moi of anything? Are you kidding? He wouldn't talk about Brody or Rex, but I did get him there on time. And if it makes you feel any better, he did seem really relieved to be back with his friends.",
        "Gigi: Maybe I should've stayed home with him.",
        "Marcie: And done what? You're going to wait around all day for a phone call from the hospital? No, Gigi, this is so much better for him. He gets back to his normal routine and he has a chance to think about things.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, like his mother lying to him his whole life. Like the man he thought was his father almost getting him killed and that his real dad could die? How can he handle all those things and -- and still do math?",
        "Marcie: His teacher knows what he's dealing with. She will look out for him.",
        "Gigi: She better. She's the one who handed him over to Brody.",
        "Marcie: Okay, Shane knows that he's loved. He will be okay. I'm not so sure about you, though. How are you doing?",
        "Gigi: I want to punch Adriana's lights out.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well, I don't blame you. She's got it coming.",
        "Gigi: Marcie, what am I going to do? She won't let me into the ICU so I can talk to him, and he needs me. I can feel it.",
        "Marcie: Okay, okay, just don't worry, all right? I'll handle it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I'm the one that dragged Brody to Llanview.",
        "Layla: You didn't want Rex to get shot.",
        "Adriana: Neither did Gigi. What if he needs to hear her voice? He sure didn't want to hear mine. And I don't blame him. If he dies, it's my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: You all right, Lieutenant?",
        "Brody: I'm fine.",
        "Officer: You want a bottle of water?",
        "Brody: No -- sure, whatever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Have you seen Natalie?",
        "Bo: You came here, pulled me out of an interrogation because you broke up with your girlfriend?",
        "Jared: No, Bo, it's more than that. She left me this letter, and then she just disappeared off the face of the earth. Nobody has seen her. And with Rex in the hospital, I was sure she'd come home. She didn't even call.",
        "Bo: So Roxy hasn't heard from her?",
        "Jared: No, and that's just not Natalie.",
        "Bo: Well, you're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: What -- what are you -- what are you looking for?",
        "Roxy: I'm looking for my lucky rabbit foot.",
        "Tina: Okay, I can help, but, um, what's it look like?",
        "Roxy: It looks like a foot. It's blue, it's furry. Oh, listen, in the meantime, here's your color just in case you wanna D-I-Y.",
        "Tina: Do it myself?",
        "[Tina chuckles]",
        "Tina: You're joking, right?",
        "Roxy: No, actually, I mean do in yourself. But, honey, it's up to you.",
        "Tina: Uh, no, you know, I think I'm gonna wait. And you know why? Because I know that your son is going to get better soon, and you are going to be back in business. So, uh, is there anything I can do to help you?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I need you to find Natalie because she's the only one who knows where that rabbit's foot is. I don't know how she knows it, but she's the one who knows it. Why she isn't she with her brother? I just -- I don't understand it at all. I need Natty and I need her right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "Natalie: Rex is alive?",
        "Tess: More or less. He's in intensive care. But you should've seen your face. You were all, like, \"oh, Rex.\" It was so good.",
        "[Tess laughs]",
        "Tess: Oh, my God.",
        "Natalie: You are the most disgusting, horrible -- if you can call it human being -- that I know. How could you do this to me?",
        "Tess: How could you and Jared do what you did to Nash?",
        "Natalie: You know what? I don't even think that you really think about Nash because you're just so into being such a psycho.",
        "Tess: I never forget about Nash.",
        "Natalie: How long do you think it's going to take, huh, Tess, for everyone to figure out that I'm locked up somewhere? I mean, I don't show up to see my brother? Someone eventually is going to figure out that someone's got me locked up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Natalie surprised me when she didn't show up at the hospital, but then again, she has surprised me before. Now, what I heard is that you two broke up. That's why she left town.",
        "Jared: See, that's just it, Bo. We were doing fine. We -- we were great, in fact. And then I leave town and I come back and Natalie is gone. Okay, and then Jessica, she finds this letter at the house. This -- this \"Dear John,\" only it doesn't sound like Natalie. So I try to track her down, but there's no sign of her anywhere. Rex gets shot; I leave her like a dozen messages. It's all over the news. Adriana comes home from Paris, still no sign of Natalie. And I'm sorry, but there is no way she wouldn't be here for Rex.",
        "Bo: So you think she's in trouble?",
        "Jared: Yes, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared, well, it seems that he is -- I think he's starting to get onto you. I mean, I saw the way he reacted when you were putting me down the other night.",
        "Tess: Oh, Natalie, don't you worry about that. I've handled that. Jared doesn't have a clue.",
        "Natalie: He's onto you, isn't he?",
        "Jared: Now, Bo, I may be way out of line here, but have you noticed anything strange about Jessica? Just something not quite right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Officer: Interrogation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Your wedding ring is stuck on your finger?",
        "Todd: Yes ma'am, has been for a while. Maybe I gained weight. Maybe it was the olives I ate last night.",
        "Marty: Olives?",
        "Todd: Yeah, you know, the salt makes you expand.",
        "Marty: Oh, gosh.",
        "Todd: It is stuck, that's for sure.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm. Gosh, the subconscious is amazing.",
        "Todd: Oh, God, don't start analyzing.",
        "Marty: Come on, Freud said there are no accidents. I'm willing to bet whatever got that ring stuck on your finger, you did it on purpose.",
        "Todd: What a bunch of garbage.",
        "Marty: It's -- hey, it's not garbage. Our body plays out all sorts of things we're feeling. You're -- okay, you get divorced, you're not ready to move on --",
        "Todd: I just said I'm ready to move on, Marty.",
        "Marty: That ring gets stuck on your finger --",
        "Todd: Ready to move on, Marty.",
        "Marty: Okay, ready to move on. And what about the children you're leaving behind?",
        "Todd: I can't even see them. There's a restraining order out against me.",
        "Marty: Doesn't make it easy to walk away or from the woman that you've been in love with for so long. Hey, talk to me. I mean, haven't we always been honest with each other?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I missed you, too.",
        "Blair: Come on, John. Look, you don't have to say that, all right?",
        "John: I know.",
        "Blair: No, this -- this completely caught me off guard. Really, it did. I mean, here -- you know, everything hits the fan as soon as you leave. I fell myself wanting to talk to you, and I can't because you're not here and I -- well, I get mad. Not at you, but at me. I don't know, somehow I've gone and made you a little bit too important. You know what I mean? Yeah, and then I guess while you were gone, my insides turned you into my go-to guy when I wasn't looking.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Blair: And then I started to think, \"okay, okay, Blair, what -- what is this?\" I mean, we like each other. Very good over in that area of the world.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Blair: We don't tell each other what to do, which is huge, but we can talk. Well, I end up doing most of the talking, like right now. But most of the time, John, we just let each other be. So when I find myself wanting to call you, I had to stop and think, well, maybe something else is going on, something more than just a couple of beers up on your roof.",
        "John: Well, you want a beer?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "John: I know what you're feeling. I mean, I can't give it a name, but I feel it, too. Um, the thing is --",
        "Blair: I know, I know, you weren't shopping for that.",
        "John: That's not it. I've got something I need to say to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: I don't know why Natty would leave town without telling me. Especially, if she's planning on breaking up with Jared. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, what good is a mother if you can't tell her all the dirty details?",
        "Tina: Well, absolutely. I mean, I'm sure if Natalie were to break up with Jared, that you would be the first to know.",
        "Roxy: If? If she were to break up with him? Didn't you say she already told him to kiss off?",
        "Tina: Well, I don't know all the details.",
        "Roxy: Well, you are living there, aren't you? At Viki's?",
        "Tina: Roxy, if I could tell you where Natalie was, I would do that. You know that, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What is it?",
        "Tess: [Sing-song voice] It's a letter. [Normal voice] Copy it.",
        "Natalie: Who's this to, Jared?",
        "Tess: No, that one's to me.",
        "Natalie: Wow. Wow, you must really be getting worried here. Well, I mean, I did tell you people are going to notice when I didn't show up for Rex.",
        "Tess: Well, it's not my fault he stepped in front of a bullet, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: A little edgy there, too. Gosh. Well, you never were really that good under pressure.",
        "Tess: Okay, okay, copy that letter or the next time you see Jared on that monitor, he'll be saying good-bye for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: What do you mean, Jessica's not herself?",
        "Jared: Well, it's just that -- okay, look, I don't have any proof or anything, nothing concrete, and I know she's still grieving for Nash. But after the funeral, after she told us where to get off, she's made this one-eighty. She insisted we move in with Viki and it just gets weirder from there. One minute she's sweet as pie, the next minute she's throwing dishes all over the kitchen. And I'll be honest, ever since Natalie left, Jessica's been a little too close for comfort.",
        "Bo: Make your point.",
        "Jared: Look, I've dealt with Jessica's alter before, Tess. I think she's back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: Right. I'll let the commissioner know she's been delayed, right.",
        "Brody: No! No, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You've already done too much for me, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Oh, right.",
        "Gigi: Uh, the bump on your head you still have from when Brody knocked you down.",
        "Marcie: Will you please stop worrying about everybody else for one minute, please, okay? We need to think about Rex. He needs you and I -- I think this could work.",
        "Gigi: What could?",
        "Marcie: Well, you know how Adriana came to visit me before she went away for Paris?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I stopped by while she was there.",
        "Marcie: Right, well, she apologized to me and she was like the old Adriana.",
        "Gigi: Not anymore.",
        "Marcie: Well, I'm going to go talk to her. I am. Maybe I can get her to see that what she's doing is wrong somehow.",
        "Gigi: I can't ask you to do that.",
        "Marcie: Well, you don't have to because I'm offering.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: The last conversation I had with Rex, he told me he wanted a divorce.",
        "Layla: You're still his wife.",
        "Adriana: He's in love with Gigi.",
        "Layla: Do you love him? Because that's the only question you need to answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Do you think it's possible?",
        "Bo: That Tess is back?",
        "Jared: She's been through so much, you know, witnessing Nash fall through the skylight.",
        "Bo: Do you think Jessica knows something about the woman that Manning supposedly has in his house?",
        "John: She knows more than she's saying, I know that.",
        "Jared: I've got to tell you, I know Jessica now. Hands down, this is the girl I met in Atlantic City.",
        "Officer: Commissioner!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Now sign it.",
        "Tess: Ooh.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Tess: Nice try, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: What now?",
        "Tess: You made the \"J\" in Jess look like a \"T\" for Tess.",
        "Natalie: Wow, are we getting a little paranoid? Because, you know, that's what a \"J\" looks like in cursive writing.",
        "Tess: Well, all the same, I'm going to get some more paper and you're going to rewrite it. And no funny business this time, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Listen, the whole time you were at Viki's, you didn't know that Jared and Natty were headed for the rocks?",
        "Tina: No, but you know the tension, you know, living there with Jessica -- and I'm sure they felt some guilt, you know.",
        "Roxy: Why did they feel guilt? It wasn't their fault. They didn't know that Dorian was going to snatch up B.E. They didn't know that Nash's creditors were going to call in that loan.",
        "Tina: Yeah, but still --",
        "Roxy: Yeah, well, you know, still -- you know, guilt is when you think something bad is going to happen to somebody, and you don't do anything about it. Or guilt is when you know something and you don't tell anybody. That's guilt, Tina.",
        "Tina: Roxy, I would tell you where Natalie was if I could. You know that, don't you? You do understand that, right?",
        "Roxy: No, I don't.",
        "Tina: But you know what? I can tell you this, that she's closer than you think. In fact, you might say that Natalie is, um, underfoot.",
        "Roxy: Tina, you're a genius. Lock up the place, okay? I've got to give this to the one kid that I've got left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Lieutenant, come on. Listen to me. Listen, I've got your back. I've got your back.",
        "Brody: He had a gun.",
        "Bo: Ease up.",
        "Brody: What was I supposed to do? If I hadn't killed him, he would have killed me.",
        "Bo: I know. Hey, I know what happened. It's okay.",
        "Brody: No. No, it isn't.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: When I left for Paris, I packed something of Rex's. I promised him that I'd stop the games, and then I saw it laying there in the drawer and I thought about him staying here with Gigi and -- I lied to him, Layla. So I put that toothbrush in my bag, and then I sent it to Brody and told him he could use the DNA on it to prove that he's Shane's father. See? I'm a terrible person.",
        "Layla: You couldn't have done anything if Gigi had told everyone the truth. This -- this is on her.",
        "Adriana: No, I unleashed Brody. It's my fault. And I just feel like if I let Gigi in that room, it means I'm giving up, I'm saying that it's over for Rex and me.",
        "Layla: And if you don't let her in?",
        "Adriana: He might not make it.",
        "Layla: Then it's still the same question. How much do you love him?",
        "Marcie: Adriana? Hi. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Layla: Okay, half-caf, skim, no sugar.",
        "Adriana: Yeah.",
        "Layla: Marcie?",
        "Marcie: No, I'm okay. Thanks.",
        "Layla: Okay.",
        "Adriana: Thanks for coming.",
        "Marcie: Oh, are you kidding me? Rex did so much for Michael and me when we were trying to keep Sam. And so did you, you know? I can never thank you enough.",
        "Adriana: Deciding to keep that secret from Todd, from everybody, it brought Rex and me so much closer together. I thought I knew everything about him. Then I found out about Gigi, and I just got so jealous and panicky, and that's not me.",
        "Marcie: I know that.",
        "Adriana: I drove him back to her. I know that, but I just couldn't seem to stop.",
        "Marcie: I know.",
        "Adriana: And we're still married. I still want to be the best wife that I can be.",
        "Roxy: Who's in there with Rex?",
        "Adriana: Uh, nobody.",
        "Roxy: You left him alone?",
        "Adriana: I just stepped out for a minute, Roxy. But he's unconscious. He doesn't know if you're in there with him or not.",
        "Roxy: How do you know? You don't.",
        "Adriana: When did I become the bad guy? I don't want to be that person.",
        "Marcie: Well, then don't be.",

        "Gigi: Hi, there, what can I get you?",
        "Jared: Hi, Gigi. It's me.",
        "Gigi: Hi. Sorry, I'm a little --",
        "Jared: Yeah, I know, I bet. Any change with Rex? How are you holding up?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Hey. Diet soda, no caffeine.",
        "Jared: Hi. Coffee, please, Gigi. Thank you. So what's going on, Jessica? Why do you want to see me?",
        "Tess: I got another letter from Natalie.",
        "Jared: Can I see it?",
        "Tess: Jared, you've been hurt enough.",
        "Jared: Let me see the letter, Jessica.",
        "Jared: Where's the envelope?",
        "Tess: I threw it out.",
        "Jared: See, but those things have return addresses on them. At least we'd know where she was.",
        "Tess: I know, but she -- the return address was Llanfair. I mean, that's pretty clever. It's the one place we know she isn't, huh?",
        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "Jared: Are you going to let me see it?",
        "Tess: Yes, of course. Sure. \"Dear Jess, I just wanted to let you know that I heard about Rex. I wish I could come see him, but I just can't take the chance of running into Jared.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You're leaving your children behind. I don't know how you're going to be able to do that.",
        "Todd: It's easier than living across town from them and still not be able to see them. Don't worry about that, though.",
        "Marty: Thank you. Well, I'd worry about it if you didn't have those feelings. But bottling them up, that's going to get you into trouble.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you know, the other day I was at the store getting those apples you like, and I saw this beautiful little boy Sam's age. It just broke my heart. And, you know, with Jack, sometimes I drive to his soccer practice, and I just park in the parking lot and watch him play. I don't know. What are you going to do?",
        "Marty: Just wait and hope.",
        "Todd: For what?",
        "Marty: Well, that things will change.",
        "Todd: Not in Blair's world.",
        "Marty: Do you miss her?",
        "Todd: Do I miss Blair? God, what is there to miss? I don't know, maybe if you yelled at me for half an hour and made a list of all the things I've done wrong for the past 10 years, I'd be reminded of what there is to miss. Cheers.",
        "Marty: Cheers. Well, you loved her once.",
        "Todd: Mm, it's over. It's over, Marty. And I'll cut my finger off if that will prove it to you. I'm really ready to move on with you and my grandkid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Is this the, um, \"It's not you Blair, it's me\" speech?",
        "John: No, I didn't even know that would work.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "John: It's more about me not wanting to fool anybody, including myself. And just trying to say that I'm not in a position to make any promises.",
        "Blair: I don't want any promises, John.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Blair: You just be honest, okay? Look, we both know I just came out of a bear trap of a marriage. And I actually like my freedom, thank you very much.",
        "John: Well, I'm going to warn you right here and now. I'm a little gloomy by nature.",
        "Blair: No.",
        "John: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: Really, you?",
        "John: Yup. And I was getting worse there for awhile, but, you know, this girl came along and it's pretty good. I just -- I'm not too sure about the flowers.",
        "Blair: You deserve them.",
        "[Blair laughs]",
        "John: Thank you.",
        "Blair: You're welcome.",

        "Tess: [As Jessica] \"Help him try to move on. Tell him I'm meeting new people and getting on with my life. I know he thinks I'm just the girl next door -- sweet, honest, and true, but I'm not.\"",
        "Tess: I'm just the girl next door, you know, sweet, honest, and true.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Jared? Are you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Good luck. Ow.",
        "Marty: Aha.",
        "Todd: All right, watch this.",
        "Todd: All right.",
        "Marty: Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: So, raise your glass. You decided to dump out that computer file and let go of your past. I've just thrown my ring into the forest. I don't think there's anything stopping us from moving forward, do you?",
        "Marty: I think you're right. There's nothing stopping us.",
        "Todd: Why don't we make it official?",
        "Marty: Official how?",
        "Todd: Well, we could get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared will know. He'll know it doesn't sound like me. He will know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] I'm sorry. I knew I shouldn't have shown you this letter. You're upset, aren't you?",
        "Jared: Yeah, I'm upset. I should have listened to you. You were right. Natalie's a heartless bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, Jared -- he's going to know that I didn't write this. He's going to know and he's going to figure this out. He's going to look for me. He's going to come through that door any second. I know it. I know it. Jared?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: It's over. I'm done with her. Natalie can go to hell.",

        "Marcie: Yeah, you do.",
        "Adriana: Is that why you're here? To convince me to let Gigi in to see Rex?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I know that you still love him. I do. And I know how hard this is, trust me, I do. I know how hard it is to let go of someone that you love.",
        "Adriana: I know you do, Marcie, but --",
        "Marcie: No, look, he's not responding. He's not. And I think we both know why, right? I think maybe he needs to hear Gigi's voice. And at the very least -- at the very least, I think it's worth a shot, right? She's the mother of his child, and they love each other so much. Do you really want to be the person to keep them apart, or do you love him enough to give him back to his family?"
