        "The judge decides in Todd's favor and awards him custody of his son, Tommy. Marcie breaks down and begins to cry and then gets up and rushes out of the courtroom. Todd starts to leave, but John steps in front of him and tells Todd that he will drop him where he stands. Dorian confronts Langston about what she knows about Langston's parents being dead. Langston opens up to Dorian and lets her know what really happened to her parents. Dorian lets Langston know that she is not alone. Jessica arrives and finds Nash dancing to music that he is listening to on his earphones. Nash lets her know that they are going to see \"Timbaland\" at Capricorn. Sean brings Talia a martini. Antonio offers to let Talia and Sean join him at this table. Natalie asks Cris to get her a good table for one, but Jared walks up and insists on a table for two. Marcie and Michael arrive home and let Roxy know what happened in court. Roxy leaves so that Marcie and Michael can have some private time with Tommy before Todd comes to get him. Marcie and Michael once again argue over the fact that Michael kept it from her that Tommy was indeed Todd's son. Marcie also tells him that the only thing that she regrets is marrying a man who would keep secrets from her. Michael is saying his good-byes to Tommy when Marcie comes into the room and insists on having some alone time with Tommy. Marcie pushes Michael out the door and locks it behind him. When the social worker, the police, and Todd arrive to get Tommy, they find that the door is locked. When Todd breaks down the door, they find Marcie is gone with Tommy. Marcie tells Tommy that they are just going for a little ride. Blair comes home and gives Starr and Cole the good news that Todd is gone to bring Tommy home and Starr is overjoyed. Natalie is very upset when Jared joins her at her table."

        "Talia: Excuse me?",
        "Shaun: I meant the martini. I meant the martini.",
        "Talia: Oh, that's funny.",
        "Antonio: How are you two doing?",
        "Talia: Oh. Um -- a cold martini and Timba --what could be better?",
        "Antonio: Oh, you like him, huh? Well, you know, guys, you're -- you're welcome to join me at my table. It's right up front.",

        "Natalie: One.",

        "Langston: You know, up until just now, I actually kind of liked you.",
        "Dorian: Your feelings about me are irrelevant, and they're not going to change the situation. We have got to talk about your parents.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: I don't think a judge makes a more important decision than awarding custody. It's always a sobering responsibility, and it's especially agonizing when there are no villains and no obvious answers. Marcie and Michael McBain have been exemplary parents. That said, Todd Manning was robbed of the opportunity to know his son, much less raise him. Mr. Manning has not only demonstrated his dedication to his older children, he has made every effort possible to find and know Tommy. He never waived his rights as a father. Legal precedents are clear, and I have no choice but to award custody of the boy to him.",
        "Todd: Yes!",

        "Langston: Why can't you just leave me alone?",
        "Dorian: Yes, that's what you're used to. That's what you know how to handle.",
        "Langston: How I live and how my pares raise me is none of your business.",
        "Dorian: You can't keep this up. It's just not going to work anymore.",
        "Langston: You don't care about me! What is this, some sort of charity project to help you forget what a bitch you really are?",
        "Dorian: Damn right I'm a bitch. I am a bitch because I have had to be. Huh. My sisters have spent most of their adult lives in mental hospitals, because they couldn't face the truth. Well, I can, and you can.",

Remember, discretion is the better part of valor.\" Nah, I don't think I like this so much. It's not like they're going to let you make any decisions, anyway. Listen to me. You got great parents, and you got a great life. Although tomorrow, you know, you might be living with somebody that you don't even know. Todd, that whack job. Anyway, it's going to shake down, but don't -- it doesn't matter, because, little man, no matter what happens in court today, just know -- somebody's going to do right for you. Ok. Come on, let's spell your name.",
        "Judge: Mr. Manning, I'm --",
        "Marcie: You can't do this, your honor! You cannot do this. Everybody in the room knows what kind of a man he is! Ok?",

        "Judge: As I was saying, Mr. Manning, while I'm awarding you full custody of your son, I think it would be in his best interest for you to do anything you can to maintain his relationship with the McBains. We all want what's best for the boy.",
        "Todd: Yeah, whatever. When do I get him?",
        "Judy: Your honor, as we intend to file an appeal immediately, wouldn't it be best to grant the McBains temporary custody --",
        "Todd: No way! It's over! He said it was over. It's final. When do I get him?",
        "Judge: Tonight.",

        "Jessica: Well, then how did you know?",
        "Nash: Because I'm still on Capricorn's e-mail list. You know, you should check your email more often. Your mother sent you an e-mail.",

        "Nash: Yeah. I wasn't snooping. She CC'd.",
        "Jessica: Well, how is she enjoying Paris?",
        "Nash: How are you enjoying procrastinating so that you don't have to go to your ex-husband's club? Jessica --",

        "Langston: Does this look like abuse to you?",
        "Dorian: I was wrong. I just spoke to the president of this organization -- oh -- on the phone. He says that he knew your parents very well. They were kind, courageous, generous people, and they would be here with you if they could be. But he told me about the car crash in Vietnam. It must have been very hard for you -- being so far away and finding out that they weren't coming back. It must have been easier for you to tell everyone, and yourself, that they were out there somewhere, still doing good works, and that they were going to be coming home. But -- that accident was 18 months ago. And you've known that they were dead for a long, long time.",

        "Judge: Mr. Manning and a representative from social services will be at your home at 9:00 tonight, Dr. and Mrs. McBain. And given the contentious nature of this case, I'm going to ask for a police escort to guarantee that this transition goes smoothly. Court is adjourned.",

        "Michael: Marcie --",
        "Marcie: Mike, you could have told me. You know, we could have made sure that none of this happened, Mike. We could have taken Tommy somewhere. Somewhere where no one would have been able to find us, and now -- now they're going to take him from us in an hour. An hour, Michael. God. Who's going to know all the songs that we sing to him, Mike, every night? D who's going to tell him that everything's going to be all right? And who's going to make sure that's true, him?",
        "Michael: Can we just -- can we talk about this at home?",
        "Marcie: No! Because I don't have a home anymore, Michael. My home is where my son is.",

        "Langston: Oh, what do you know what I can do?",
        "Dorian: I've been where you are. How did you find out? By phone?",
        "Langston: They were supposed to be coming home on a Friday. I was making this big sign for them. And it said \"welcome home\" in the languages of all the countries they'd been in. Took me forever to find it in Vietnamese, but I did it. They were on their way to the airport when it happened, so when the phone rang and I -- I saw the caller I.D. said \"long distance,\" I just assumed it was them. But -- but it was this guy. And he asked me my- and he told me that he had some very bad news for me. And -- and that I should sit down. Like it would help. Like any-- anything would help.",

        "Todd: What can you do to me now, John? From what I hear, you're fresh out of badges. Yeah, it seems to your brother's going be occupying the Todd Manning memorial cell pretty soon. Damn, that's funny. You know, I figured that, just like the town figured that the McBains could do absolutely no wrong. It doesn't seem like that's the case anymore, does it? It seems like your brother just perjured himself on the stand. It seems like he knew all along whose kid that was. Kept his mouth shut.",
        "Marty: You know what? Marcie is a dis-- she's a distraught mother, and she doesn't know what she is saying right now, ok? So why don't you stop trying to punish the two of them, and -- and focus on building a life with your son?",
        "Blair: Excuse me, Marty, but I don't think it's any of your business what Todd does!",
        "Todd: No, forget her, forget her, forget her.",
        "[Todd sighs]",
        "Todd: Here's the thing about me. I'm an excellent multitasker, which means that I'm going to take care of this kid, and at the same time, I'm going to make sure your brother gets his. Man, when I am done with him, he won't have a job. He won't be married anymore. The only thing he's going to have is a cot Statesville for as long as possible.",
        "Marcie: Where's Tommy?",
        "Roxy: Oh, don't go in there. He's sleeping. What happened? Oh man, this really sucks.",
        "Michael: Yeah. You mind leaving us alone?",
        "Roxy: Yeah, sure.",
        "Michael: Can we talk about this, please?",
        "Marcie: Now you want to talk about this, Michael? Now? How many months have I been asking you what's bothering you? I thought it was me. I thought that you didn't love me anymore, and then I thought you were sick and you just didn't know how to tell me but it was this!",
        "Michael: I keep telling you, I thought I was protecting you.",
        "Marcie: Right. Silly old Marcie. She's too \"flighty\" to know that her son's birthfather -- he's the maniac. He's the maniac who lives across town.",
        "Michael: Marcie, we have to do this together.",
        "Marcie: Do what?",
        "Michael: What the judge said. I mean, they're on their way over here right now, Marcie. We have to get him ready. We -- we have to say goodbye.",
        "Marcie: You do whatever you want. You're on your own. I am saying nothing of that kind to my son.",
        "Michael: You can be angry with me, you can hate me, but if you don't go in that room with me, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.",
        "Marcie: You want to talk about regrets, Mike? I regret that I married a man who didn't think enough of me to tell me the truth about the most important thing in my life. That's what I regret.",
