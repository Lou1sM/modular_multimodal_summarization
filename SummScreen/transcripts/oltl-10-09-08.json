        "Natalie convinces Tina to get her out of the locked room and to realize that Tess is dangerous. At Rodi's, Jared runs into the Leo the contractor who remembers Tess. Jared is ready to forget all about Natalie. But he has his \"suspicions\" about Jessica. He offers to introduce Leo to his father, Charlie and help him get more work if Leo tells him what he knows about the \"business deal\" he had with \"Jessica\". At the hospital, Adriana still blames Gigi for what happened to Rex and won't let her near his hospital room. Everybody, however, is angry at her and nobody sees her as anything important to Rex.

        "Marty: Married, you and me?",
        "Todd: Well, now, don't get so excited. You're going to hurt yourself.",
        "Marty: I thought we were having a serious conversation.",
        "Todd: We are -- about you, me, and the baby.",
        "Marty: Living together.",
        "Todd: No, about making a family.",
        "Marty: Yeah, for the sake of Starr's baby, isn't that what you said?",
        "Todd: Yeah, so?",
        "Marty: So, why would we have to get married? It's -- it's an arrangement.",
        "Todd: What's the big deal? It's just a piece of paper.",
        "Marty: It's a piece of paper that generally two people get when they're in love. Huh? Trying to tell me something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I don't know about you, but I think this afternoon has been very well spent. You tired?",
        "John: Not even close.",
        "Blair: Hmm. It's getting dark outside.",
        "John: Yeah. The days are getting shorter.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: Why don't we just kill the rest of the afternoon?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Mama Bear is busting out all of the big guns. I'm maxing out all my jujus, but, baby, you are totally worth it. You're going to need all the help you can get, with all that bad mojo that your wife's lugging around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I can only imagine what you're going through, not seeing Rex after all of these months, and then finding him like this.",
        "Adriana: He had enough energy for six people. I can't stand this.",
        "Marcie: You're scared.",
        "Adriana: Are you kidding? He's the love of my life, and I'm terrified.",
        "Marcie: So is Gigi.",
        "Adriana: I know. I just don't care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Glass shatters]",
        "Gigi: It's just glass, nothing to see here.",
        "[Gigi sighs]",
        "Gigi: Except a messed-up, terrified, broken-hearted waitress.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Natalie is a heartless bitch. It's over. I'm done with her. She can go to hell.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] I -- I don't believe you. You're not over my sister.",
        "Jared: What part of \"heartless bitch\" doesn't compute?",
        "Tess: You're lying. You can't just cut somebody out of your life like that. Love doesn't work that way.",
        "Jared: I can try. Rex is dying, and Natalie can't even pick up a phone. And she's told me over and over how important family is to her and then she just goes and blows off everyone. If she can do this, wherever Natalie is, well, she can just rot there for all I care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I knew you'd come. I knew you wouldn't leave me. I knew you wouldn't leave me locked down here.",
        "Tina: Are you okay?",
        "Natalie: Well, I'm alive. But that could change any second. I've got to get out of here.",
        "Tina: But -- but she didn't hurt you, right? I mean Tess didn't --",
        "Natalie: No, no, not physically. No, just these crazy cameras that she has all over the house. She's making me watch my entire life move on without me.",
        "Tina: Your sister is very sick.",
        "Natalie: Tess is not my sister.",
        "Tina: No, she is, deep down, because she's -- because she's Jessica, and I know that Jessica would not want to hurt you.",
        "Natalie: Aunt Tina, okay, listen to me. You've got to get out of here. You've got to call Jared or the cops, Uncle Bo, somebody. You have got to get me out of here. I cannot last down here another second.",
        "Tina: I'm sorry. I can't do that. You're -- you're going to have to stay put.",
        "Natalie: You can't? Because of some stones that you stole from Mendorra? Are you kidding me? Yeah, I know all about it from Llanfair TV things.",
        "Tina: But they're the crown jewels.",
        "Natalie: This is my life!",
        "Tina: Well, I know that. I do, but --",
        "Natalie: Tina, are you -- are you actually telling me that my survival is less important to you than your take from some jewelry heist?",
        "Tina: Oh, gosh this is just such a mess.",
        "Natalie: Okay, all right, listen to me. I know -- I know that you don't have a lot of experience dealing with Tess, okay? And let me just put it to you this way. Tess is to Jess as Niki Smith is to my mother.",
        "Tina: But I like Niki Smith. I mean, she even saved my life once.",
        "Natalie: She pushed Ben Davidson out of a window and then tried to frame me for it.",
        "Tina: Oh, no, no, no. That is just plain mean.",
        "Natalie: And Tess, she cares less about this family than Niki ever did.",
        "Tina: Yeah, but deep down, she's Jessica.",
        "Natalie: You've got to forget about that, Aunt Tina. Okay, you've got to start treating her like she's the enemy, okay? Because as long as Jessica is Tess, she is a threat to every single person that we love. So tell me, what's more important to you -- your family or your stupid bling?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Okay, okay, slow down.",
        "Jared: What for?",
        "Tess: Before you, uh, say something that you can't take back.",
        "Jared: Did Natalie think twice? Did she tell me she was thinking about breaking things off? No. She just took off and left me one of her famous letters.",
        "Tess: Jared --",
        "Jared: She's a coward, Jessica. She didn't have the guts to tell me to my face she couldn't hack it anymore.",
        "Tess: Well, maybe she just loved you too much --",
        "Jared: Bull. She never loved me in the first place.",
        "Tess: Do you really feel that way?",
        "Jared: I was just the rebound guy for John McBain. She never let me in. She was never the woman I thought she was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm sorry. How much do I owe you for the glasses?",
        "Manager: It's not a big deal.",
        "Gigi: I'm never like this. I can usually bus the entire joint with my eyes closed.",
        "Manager: Please, take the rest of the day off.",
        "Gigi: No, just tell me how much the glasses are, and we'll call it even.",
        "Manager: You're a mess.",
        "Gigi: I'll pull it together.",
        "Manager: Gigi, I'm not firing you. Just go home. We're covered.",
        "Gigi: You're already down one bartender. You need me here.",
        "Manager: Your kid and his dad need you even more. Why are you hiding out here?",
        "Gigi: Because I told you, I can't sit at home. I will go nuts. Shane's at school, and I can't see Rex, and the whole knitting craze kind of passed me by. So, please, just let me stay here. I will pull it together, I promise you.",
        "Manager: All right, but take 15, clear your head. You won't be any use to anyone broken up the way you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Gigi's feelings are not my concern. Rex's are. My husband's are.",
        "Marcie: I think that you need to be honest with yourself. Keeping Gigi away is about your feelings, not Rex's.",
        "Adriana: So, you're taking her side again.",
        "Layla: This isn't about taking sides. Right, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Right. I mean, what do you think is going to happen if Gigi does go into that room?",
        "Adriana: Her boyfriend shot Rex.",
        "Marcie: But he's not her boyfriend, and he's in lockup now, so Brody cannot hurt Rex anymore.",
        "Adriana: We were happy, Marcie. Can you remember that?",
        "Marcie: You know I know that. I remember that, of course.",
        "Adriana: The way he used to look at me, like I was the only person on the planet, like he would die without me.",
        "Marcie: I know. And I know how --",
        "Adriana: Rex didn't change, Marcie. Gigi chased him to Llanview. She threw herself at him. From the day she showed up, we haven't had a moment's happiness. And now, he's in a hospital bed on a ventilator fighting for his life.",
        "Marcie: And the person responsible for that is in jail, so why are you punishing Gigi?",
        "Adriana: Here's what I don't get. Why are you treating me like the bad guy?",
        "Marcie: I'm --",
        "Adriana: If Gigi hadn't felt the need to stand up in that church and take what wasn't hers, Rex would be healthy, and he would be happy, and he'd be with me.",
        "Marcie: Clearly, that was not the best move. But here -- here's the thing, okay? Now that your roles are sort of reversed, is Rex really yours to take from Gigi?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: How about an early dinner?",
        "Blair: Like a date?",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay? Okay?",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Blair: I'm going to go take a shower, all right? And then we'll go on our date.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Blair: You know, I'm probably crazy to even ask this, but don't you have a case to solve?",
        "John: I told you, I'm still waiting on some information. Until then, I'm all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: People get married for all kinds of reasons.",
        "Marty: Other than love?",
        "Todd: Having love is the most prosaic of all reasons to get married.",
        "Marty: Wow, okay. You're really pulling out all the stops to sell me on this.",
        "Todd: Is that what I have to do, sell you on it?",
        "Marty: No, you have to drop the armor and the jokes and talk to me. Tell me why you'd want to get married.",
        "Todd: I didn't say I really wanted to get married. I just threw it out there as an option. Obviously, you have a problem with it, so --",
        "Marty: So, you weren't serious?",
        "Todd: Not if you're not serious. Well, what do you want me to do, get on my knee? You want me to get all flowers and puppy dogs on you? Come on, throw me a bone.",
        "Marty: What are you so afraid of? As co-parents or anything else, if we can't talk straight with one another, what's it all for?",
        "Todd: For crying out loud -- Marty, will you marry me?",
        "Todd: You know, the idea didn't come out of nowhere. I -- I've been thinking about it for a while.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: And I did mean it. I do want to marry you.",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "Todd: Uh -- well, I guess I think that marriage would make it all plain. Simple. There'd be no confusion when people see us in the street. There'd be no false assumptions. It'd be just, uh -- \"hello, this is my wife.\" I'm your husband, this is our kid.",
        "Marty: Right. Well, we shouldn't have to explain ourselves.",
        "Todd: Then let's do it because we want to. Because it'd be good. It's been good so far, hasn't it?",
        "Marty: Yeah, you've been good for me. That I know.",
        "Todd: And you've been good for me. That should be enough.",
        "Marty: But it's not enough. I can't help but wonder if you want to marry me for me or if because you want to get back at Blair.",

        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: McBain. Hey, Smitty, what's going on? No. No, I'm sure of the name, Janet Ketring. Yeah. No, I ran a check on her already. I, uh, I came up with nothing. Um -- no, I'm trying to figure out how Ramsey found her. Really? No kidding? Well, how long can I have the file? Yeah? You're kidding? Well, I better get cracking. Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] I just keep racking my brain to see if I could have done something to stop this from happening, you know?",
        "Jared: Like what?",
        "Tess: I don't know. I was such a basket case when Nash died, and if I had just been a little bit more understanding to my --",
        "Jared: Stop. Jessica -- you had every right to hold us responsible for Nash's death, and I wouldn't have blamed you if you wanted to make us pay. But you wanted to make peace. You forgave us.",
        "Tess: I lost my husband. I don't want to lose my sister, too.",
        "Jared: And Natalie knew that, and she just took off anyway, just when you needed her most.",
        "Tess: When we needed her the most.",
        "Jared: Well, now, we are going to have to find a way to live without her.",
        "Tess: Do you think you can?",
        "Jared: Natalie wants me to move on and to find somebody else? Fine by me. How about a game of pool?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Natalie, you are a great girl. You are, and -- what? And I love your hair.",
        "Natalie: Want it? Want it? Because I'll shave it all off for you. I will give it to you if that's what it'll take to get you to get me out of here!",
        "Tina: Natalie, honey, don't you understand? I would let you out of here in a second if it meant that all I had to give up was the crown jewels -- I mean, even if they are worth millions.",
        "Natalie: Then what's stopping you?",
        "Tina: Carlo Hesser and Cain Rogan. I mean, if they find out that I have the jewels --",
        "Natalie: Then give them back.",
        "Tina: Natalie, we are talking about Carlo Hesser here. I mean, he tried to kill Sarah for something he thought I did to him 10 years ago. Can you imagine what he would do to her if he found out that I suckered him for real?",
        "Natalie: You have no intention of getting me out of here. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Tina: I just wanted to see if you were okay. If -- if you need something to eat, or something to read.",
        "Natalie: Bull. You want me to forgive you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Here it is.",
        "Gigi: Come on. Excuse me, Sir, you have a light? Charlie, hey. Hey. What's up? What are you doing over here?",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm just grabbing a bite. I'm on my way back to the site.",
        "Gigi: Oh, that's right. You're rebuilding Carlotta's.",
        "Charlie: Right.",
        "Gigi: I don't suppose you have a light?",
        "Charlie: Uh, I don't smoke anymore. I didn't know that you did.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I -- I don't, actually. Not since I was a teenager.",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Thank you for reminding me.",
        "Charlie: Bumming lights for cigarettes, huh? I've been there.",
        "Gigi: Awful, isn't it?",
        "Charlie: Well, it's not as bad as giving into the craving. It just -- it's a little weird that I should be talking about that here.",
        "Gigi: Why? Oh, is this where Viki found you?",
        "Charlie: Passed out and half-dead from alcohol poisoning.",
        "Gigi: Well, we can go inside if you want.",
        "Charlie: No, it's okay. No, it's probably good for me to be here. It'll remind me not to get cocky about my recovery. So I, uh, I hear Rex isn't doing too well, huh?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, I wouldn't know, because, uh -- I'm just afraid I never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: So, what you're really saying is that Gigi has some magical ability to save Rex, but I'm too selfish to let her use it?",
        "Layla: No, no. I think what she meant was if you could possibly let Gigi see Rex, as a last resort, because none of can know what's really inside Rex's heart, or who he'd respond to if he could.",
        "Adriana: I can't deal with this right now. I have to focus on Rex.",
        "Marcie: You're right. You'll both be in my prayers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: And, honey, when you do get awake, maybe you can have a couple of words with that wife of yours, because she's taken a real nasty turn. Why can't she be like that sweet, innocent, convent girl she was like when you first met her?",
        "Adriana: Because she was sick and tired of being walked all over. If you have something to say to about me, Roxy, just say it to my face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Um -- a little off my game. Must be, uh, belly. You know, Jared, you don't deserve to be treated like this.",
        "Jared: Neither does Rex.",
        "Tess: I hate to say it, but I think you're doing the right thing.",
        "Jared: What, beating you at pool?",
        "[Tess chuckles]",
        "Tess: No, Natalie got the pool gene, not me. But if Rex getting shot isn't going to bring Natalie home, I'm pretty sure there's nothing you can do to bring her home. You deserve better than this, Jared. You really do.",
        "Jared: I could teach you.",
        "Tess: Teach me what?",
        "Jared: Well, we could both use a hobby.",
        "Tess: Oh -- oh, uh, yeah. Um -- maybe some other time. I -- I should get home. Bree's going to be waking up from her nap soon. Um, but how about we have dinner later? I can make something nice. Just the two of us. We won't talk about Natalie, I promise.",
        "Jared: I'd like that.",
        "Tess: Okay. No risotto.",
        "[Jared laughs]",
        "Tess: Bye.",
        "Leo: You into blondes?",
        "Jared: No, actually, I prefer redheads.",
        "Leo: Good, because you're better off, because the girl that was just hitting on you? Freaky, deaky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Forgive you for leaving me locked down here with Tess calling the shots? Not a chance.",
        "Tina: But -- but, Natalie, honey, it's going to be different. I'm -- I'm going to see that you get your favorite foods.",
        "Natalie: I'm not your stupid dog, Tina. I'm your niece, and I am being held prisoner.",
        "Tina: I just want to see that you're okay.",
        "Natalie: I'm not okay. I'm not okay, and my mom wouldn't be okay either if she knew what you were doing, because -- you don't understand. This isn't just about me getting hurt. This is Tess running wild, and you could do something to stop this. Tess is nuts. My sister almost died from Hep C, because Tess shot heroine with a shared needle.",
        "Tina: My God, I had no idea.",
        "Natalie: Then get a clue. Okay, my mom -- that car crash that she was in, the one she actually died in, Tess cut the brakes!",
        "Tina: What, she tried to kill her own mother?",
        "Natalie: No, actually, she was trying to kill me and Jared. When that didn't work, she tried to poison us, okay? This isn't some stupid prank. My life is in danger. Tess is a frickin' lunatic.",
        "Tina: This was supposed to be a safe place for me to go. Now, what am I going to do?",
        "Natalie: You're going to go upstairs, and you're going to call Uncle Bo, and you are going to let him take care of the rest.",
        "Tina: I can't.",
        "Natalie: Aunt Tina!",
        "Tina: What -- no, Tess is going to sic Carlo on my Sarah.",
        "Natalie: And what if Tess decides to come back down here and finish the job? She gets a shotgun --",
        "Tina: Well -- just stop.",
        "Natalie: Could you forgive yourself if someone died because of Tess, and you didn't lift a finger to prevent it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I just want to say, thanks, I owe you one. Call you later.",
        "Blair: Well, it looks like somebody lit a fire under you.",
        "John: Yeah, I just got that information I was looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know, I did just chuck my wedding ring into the forest there. Most guys who do that, it means that they're ready to move on.",
        "Marty: Most guys don't propose and mention their ex-wives in the same breath.",
        "Todd: I just thought you deserved to know I've been married a couple times.",
        "Marty: Yeah, to the same woman.",
        "Todd: Never again. I mean, not to Blair. That's the whole truth, you know?",
        "Marty: Well, I appreciate you telling me.",
        "Todd: Okay, now that we've achieved full disclosure --",
        "Marty: Well, for you.",
        "Todd: What do you mean?",
        "Marty: Well, there's things that I probably should be telling you about myself, and I don't even know them.",
        "Todd: Now, wait a minute. I thought we were going to draw a line across the past.",
        "Marty: Blair keeps jumping across the past.",
        "Todd: Blair left me for John McBain. McBain left you for dead. Period.",
        "Marty: Okay, so we're getting married because it's symmetrical or --",
        "Todd: No, I want to marry you because you're you. Stop selling yourself short.",
        "Marty: No, no, I understand it. I'm a good catch, good catch. Amnesiac, barely mobile --",
        "Todd: You're beautiful. You're smart. Funny. Frustrating. Listen, I hate Blair. I hate John McBain. I really hate the idea that they're having a laugh at me right now because they think they've made a fool of me. And I don't have room for them in my life anymore. Because I have someone else that I'm going to take care of. I want to marry you because of the way you make me feel about myself, the way you make me feel in general. I just feel like a new person when I'm with you.",
        "Marty: And I want to believe that.",
        "Todd: Marty, you're the last person I thought that I would want to be with. But I do.",
        "Todd: I don't want to lose you.",
        "Marty: I don't want to lose you either. But I can't marry you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I appreciate it if you kept your meddling to when Rex is conscious and can decide just how much of what you're saying is bull.",
        "Roxy: You better shut up and listen to me, pipsqueak. I'm Rex's mother and I have every right to let him know what the score is, and you have no right to keep Gigi from seeing him.",
        "Adriana: Oh, you're doing the mom thing this week. I'm sorry, I lost track because you only do it when it suits you. You're no better than Dorian.",
        "Roxy: You really don't want to go there.",
        "Adriana: All I care about is Rex getting better, and you upsetting him is not helping.",
        "Roxy: So, what are you going to do, throw me out?",
        "Adriana: Maybe I should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: So that's why I'm here and not at the hospital.",
        "Charlie: Boy, if there ever was a time for a cigarette --",
        "Gigi: Right?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, but I don't think that Rex would like very much if your breath smelled like smoke. He would probably wake up and dress you down.",
        "Gigi: I would take him telling me off in a heartbeat if it meant getting him off that respirator. Hell, I'll take the respirator over not being able to see him at all.",
        "Charlie: Sometimes all you can do is play the cards that are dealt you.",
        "Gigi: So, I'm supposed to just roll over and let Adriana play God.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no. No, you're supposed to let the doctors do their job and you just look after yourself and Shane, and then when Rex wakes up a asks for you, which you know he's going to do, then you can both be there for him.",
        "Gigi: But what if Rex doesn't --",
        "Charlie: No, no, no. Don't -- don't even think that. You have just got to trust your love for him and believe that even though he's far away and you're apart, he will feel it. Just -- just trust that that's going to be enough to bring him back to you. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm sorry about dinner.",
        "Blair: Look, John, I just got to spend the most amazing afternoon with you. It's kind of caught me by surprise. It's very nice. It's a gift. So, it's okay, just go to work. Okay?",
        "John: It's good that we talked.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah, you hated every minute of it.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "John: Sometimes you got to.",
        "Blair: I know. Listen, who's ever at the heart of this case, if they're really in danger, they're very lucky to have a good cop like you trying to make things right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, that's it, huh? We're done?",
        "Marty: Well, I didn't realize this proposal was all or nothing.",
        "Todd: It's not. I just don't know what's in between.",
        "Marty: I don't know, then we'll have to figure it out, okay? I don't -- I don't want to lose you, either.",
        "Todd: You just don't want to marry me.",
        "Marty: I can't marry you. I cannot make a commitment that huge when I have no idea of who I am, huh? And certainly not while I'm completely dependent on you.",
        "Todd: Right. Just want to keep your options open.",
        "Marty: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Todd: It's okay. I get it.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: I totally get it, you know? When you're healed, you're not gimpy anymore, you might not want me, and that's cool. I understand. I -- I don't want this to be -- whatever this is, I don't want it to be a prison for you. You can go when you want. You can do whatever you want with whoever you want.",
        "Marty: Okay, I'm going to try really hard to forget you even said that.",
        "Todd: Maybe I should just shut up.",
        "Marty: Maybe you should, that'd be a good idea.",
        "Todd: All right, I'm done.",
        "Marty: Maybe I am worried that I would only be doing it because I feel that without you I'm nothing.",
        "Todd: What if that's how I feel about myself, 24 hours a day, with or without you?",
        "Marty: You don't have to put a ring on my finger to prove that you're a good person. I already know it. And I know how hard it was for you to propose to me and I'm really sorry that I couldn't give you the answer you wanted. You've had my life in your hands, I've trusted you. So now I'm just asking you to trust me with this and know that I will not let you down.",

        "Tina: Viki would never forgive me if I let something happen to you.",
        "Natalie: That's right, that's right. And you know what? We'll go -- we'll both go to my mom and we'll explain to her everything that Tess made us do.",
        "Tina: But what about my Sarah, because Carlo could hurt her --",
        "Natalie: Okay, first -- first, we'll go to Uncle Bo because Uncle Bo will take care of Cain and Carlo permanently, okay? And then -- and then, um, I'll help you. I'll help you get the jewels back from Tess and -- and -- and maybe I could even get you to keep them.",
        "Tina: Right. Of course you're right. Honey, you are family. I am going to get you out of there.",
        "Natalie: Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Tina: Okay, here we go. First thing we have to do is open this door.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",

        "Leo: That's her. Trust me; you do not want what that girl is selling.",
        "Jared: Wait, did -- did you two --",
        "Leo: No.",
        "Jared: You know.",
        "Leo: Not to say I wasn't interested at first but I caught on pretty quickly.",
        "Jared: To what?",
        "Leo: To her crazy.",
        "Jared: You know, I might be up for a little insanity.",
        "Bartender: Here you go.",
        "Jared: You know what? Allow me.",
        "Leo: Whatever floats your boat, pal.",
        "Jared: Because you can't leave me hanging. I'm supposed to meet up with crazy tonight, and you're going to tell me what I'm in for.",
        "Leo: Well, I did some work for her a while back and, uh -- whew -- I can't say anything because I got to keep it confidential.",
        "Jared: You're a lawyer?",
        "Leo: No, a contractor.",
        "Jared: Oh, no kidding? So is my dad. He's redoing the diner, you know, over at Angel Square?",
        "Leo: I busted my ass to get hired on that but they already had their subs.",
        "Jared: Well, you know, stuff happens, people don't work out. I should set -- set you and my dad up, you know? He's always looking for reliable subcontractors.",
        "Leo: You'd do that?",
        "Jared: Dude, if you were working for a trust-fund baby like Jessica Buchanan, it's practically found money. I'll set it up.",
        "Leo: I appreciate it.",
        "Jared: So, lay it on me.",
        "Leo: Your girl toy? See, uh, I built this room for her.",

        "Tina: Wait -- does Tess have a social security number?",
        "Natalie: Okay, no, Tina, just stop -- stop, stop, stop, okay? Obviously, we don't know the combo to this and God only knows what kind of booby trap Tess has got set on here in case we screw it up, so --",
        "Tina: Yeah, but I don't know what else to do.",
        "Natalie: I do. Go upstairs and call Bo.",
        "Tina: You know, that's exactly what I'm going to do as soon as I get the jewels out of that safe and away from Tess.",
        "Natalie: No, no.",
        "Tina: Natalie, I'm going to get you out of here. I promise, okay? Just -- just trust me, okay?",

        "Doctor: Excuse me, but I really have to insist on one visitor at a time. We have to avoid stress on Rex.",
        "Adriana: Mind if I go first? I've barely had a chance to sit with my husband since I've been back.",

        "Todd: But I don't come by that feeling very easily.",
        "Marty: Neither do most people.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but it's harder for me for some reason. It never seems to last.",
        "Marty: What, the trust or the situation?",
        "Todd: Either one. Things just seem to go all wrong for me, so -- I'm trying to nail down a couple of things. You can't blame me for that, can you?",
        "Marty: No.",
        "Todd: Well?",
        "Marty: Well, given your track record with marriage, I'm surprised that you think that institution can nail down anything.",
        "Todd: Marriage to Blair doesn't work, that's for sure. No matter how good things got, I -- I'd look at her and just think of all the mistakes we made. I look at you and I don't feel that way. It's different.",
        "Marty: Well, I hope it stays that way. But we'd be making a huge mistake if we jumped into something now that I'm not ready for.",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Marty: You know, we'd end up ruining what we have.",
        "Todd: Which is what, exactly?",
        "Marty: Uh, I don't know. I can't speak for both of us. But for me it's, um, hmm -- kind of like falling in love.",

        "Roxy: You're damn right I mind. So take your phony act and shove it.",
        "Doctor: All right, you need to work this out outside.",
        "Layla: Come on, guys. Let Rex have some peace.",
        "Adriana: Doctor, I don't understand why Rex woke up and then went back out.",
        "Roxy: Maybe he needs more visitors, less of the same old same old.",
        "Doctor: All right, there are no easy answers here. So far, Rex's C.T. scans are negative, but we can't rule out anoxic brain injury, and the reason he's on the respirator is because he's presenting signs of adult respiratory distress. Now, the bottom line is, Rex needs to wake up and he needs to start breathing on his own, but something is holding him back and conventional medicine can't always tell us what that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I -- I think Adriana heard me, but, you know, it could take a while for it to sink in.",
        "Gigi: Well, it means a lot to me that you even tried, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Hang in there, okay? I'll -- I'll try another pass at her soon.",
        "Gigi: Thanks. Adriana won't budge. She won't let me or Shane see Rex. If I had just told him sooner, none of this would have happened. Shane would have his father, and Rex would be okay. This is all my fault.",

        "Blair: Hmm, let's see. Maybe you can have two or three or maybe as many as you like.",

        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Blair: Until I'm not. See you soon.",
        "John: Soon. Hey.",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "John: I am sorry. I wouldn't do this if it wasn't important.",
        "Blair: John, it's work. It's not like it's another woman.",

        "Todd: Falling in love with me?",
        "Marty: I mean, you remember, I got nothing to go on.",

        "Marty: Well, whatever it is, it feels great. Kind of like, uh --",
        "Todd: Like what?",
        "Marty: Like an awakening.",
        "Todd: I feel the same way. Whatever it is, I'll -- I'll keep my ring finger free.",
