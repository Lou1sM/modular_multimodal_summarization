        "While Tea and Blair struggle after Blair finds out that Tea had a child with Todd, Blair falls out the window and is seriously injured right at Dorian's press conference. They rush her to the hospital. Matthew accepts that Greg Evans will not do the surgery to help him walk but he exercises his court mandated legal rights to find another doctor. Aware of this, Destiny, Rachel, Bo and Nora all know that they only way to protect Matthew is to urge Greg to do the surgery since he's the only neurosurgeon they know of who can successfully do it. Right at that time, when Blair is rushed in, Greg is able to convince Dorian, Todd, Starr and Cole that he can save Blair. And it appears he might be ready to do the surgery to save her. And we can only wonder what will happen next."

        "Dorian: It most certainly is not a stunt, and I can prove it. Uh, Amelia Bennett is not just my new campaign manager. She's my partner, my fianc\u00e9e. [Gasps]",

        "Jessica: So I'm assuming you've read the paper this morning.",
        "Roxy: You assume wrong. I think Johnny McBain stole it. He is a closet tabloid--",

        "Nora: Is that about Jared's case?",
        "Bo: Yeah, but there's no need to involve the D.A. yet.",

        "Rachel: Matthew isn't backing down. He's gonna have the surgery.",
        "Greg: So tell her I won't operate on him.",
        "Rachel: She knows that. Greg, that's the problem. Matthew won the right to have the surgery. The ruling didn't say that you had to be the surgeon. All it says is that he doesn't need his parents' permission.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Did Greg Evans change his mind about operating on Matthew?",
        "Nora: No. He still refuses to touch Matthew.",

        "Rachel: Greg, Matthew is looking for another doctor to operate on him.",
        "Bo: What is this?",
        "Nora: I found them by the printer at home. He's doing internet searches for doctors.",

        "Bo: Doesn't mean he's stupid. He's determined.",

        "Jessica: There was a murder at Llanfair.",
        "Roxy: A murder? Aces maremba! Who got iced?",
        "Brody: A man named Wayne Landers.",
        "Roxy: Who the hell is Wayne Landers? Was he, like, the butler or something?",
        "Brody: No. He was an ex-con who was in prison the same time as Jared.",
        "Jessica: And he was also the guy running around town pretending to be Nash.",
        "Roxy: Oh, he's the one who was stalking you and Natalie.",
        "Jessica: Apparently.",
        "Roxy: Well, then good for Jared because obviously the creep deserved it. I think Bo should pin a fancy medal on Jared for defending his wife and his family.",
        "Brody: We're not exactly sure that's why Jared did it.",
        "Jessica: If he did it.",
        "Roxy: I don't understand.",
        "Brody: Jared may have had another motive for killing Landers.",
        "Roxy: It's called self-defense. I mean, that creep tried to beat the crap out of him at B.E.",
        "Brody: It looks like that may have been staged.",
        "Roxy: Staged by who? Wait a second. Are you saying that Jared staged his own clobbering?",
        "Jessica: It's possible.",
        "Roxy: Why the hell would he do that? Why would he get this whacko to do a tap dance all over his face and then turn around and murder him?",
        "Brody: To shut him up.",
        "Roxy: Ha! Are you two saying that they were working together? Please don't tell me that they were working together.",
        "Brody: They may have been working together.",
        "Roxy: I told you not to tell me that!",
        "Brody: I'm sorry.",
        "Roxy: I don't get this. I don't get it. First you're saying to me that Jared is a stalker. Now you're saying that he's a killer?",
        "Brody: It's possible. Maybe you should sit down.",
        "Roxy: I don't want to sit down. Why would I want to sit down? I think I better sit down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Hang in there, baby girl. Hang in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You'd let another doctor operate on you?",
        "Matthew: Sure. Why not?",
        "Destiny: Because it's dangerous, and they can make you worse.",
        "Matthew: What else am I supposed to do? I can't wait for Greg forever. He chickened out on me.",
        "Destiny: Just give him a little more time. He'll come around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: I'm sorry.",
        "Rachel: I'm glad you can say those words now, but they're not the answer to everything.",
        "Greg: But Matthew is not my patient.",
        "Rachel: You're the one who gave him hope.",
        "Greg: I'm not operating again, Rachel--not on Matthew, not on anyone.",
        "Rachel: Look, I understand how you felt after Shaun's surgery. You didn't want to risk Matthew, and I respected that.",
        "Greg: Thank you.",
        "Rachel: But you're not protecting him now by saying no. Matthew is determined to have this surgery. He's going to find a doctor, and I know there's no way that doctor is going to be anywhere near as good as you. If you say no now, you're risking Matthew's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I've spent over an hour going over the judge's ruling here. I can't believe he left a hole this big in it.",
        "Bo: No, it's not a hole. You know, Matthew wants to walk, so he's allowed to find a doctor and give it a shot.",
        "Nora: Give it a shot? That's our baby.",
        "Bo: Can you think of a doctor, any of them we talked to before, who we could trust?",
        "Nora: They all said no. I can't imagine that they would change their mind at this point. I can't imagine any good doctor agreeing to this.",
        "Bo: Do you think he's already found somebody?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: How long am I supposed to wait for Greg? A week? A month? Every day I sit in this chair, I don't use my muscles, and I get weaker.",
        "Destiny: You don't know that.",
        "Matthew: Your brother Greg is the one who told me that. The sooner I get my surgery, the greater my chances are of walking again.",
        "Destiny: Not if you let just anyone cut on you.",
        "Matthew: I did a bunch of research online, and I found a great neurosurgeon. I talked to him this morning, and he's coming to examine me.",
        "Destiny: Bad idea, Matthew. Very bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Stop that. Show some respect. Don't make me say it--",
        "David: Bad time to stop by, T\u00e9a.",
        "Todd: You didn't do this.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. No, I just--",
        "Todd: Because I saw you up there.",
        "T\u00e9a: No.",
        "Todd: What happened?",

        "Female reporter: Martin, we can now confirm that the body on the pool cover...",
        "Starr: Body?",
        "Female reporter: Is Blair Cramer...",
        "Cole: They don't mean that.",
        "Female reporter: The niece of newly gay mayoral candidate, Dr. Dorian Lord. Ms. Cramer is unconscious, and the extent of her injuries is unknown at this time.",
        "Cole: See? They'll take her to the hospital.",
        "Starr: We have to go now.",
        "Cole: Okay. I'll drive.",
        "Starr: Okay.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Paramedic: Yes, ma'am.",
        "David: Dorian, here we go. Let them work. Come with me.",
        "Dorian: Check for bone fractures.",
        "David: Dorian, look at me. Focus. You can't drive to the hospital right now. Do you want me to take you?",
        "Dorian: No. I'm riding in the ambulance with Blair. You stay here.",
        "David: Are you sure?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely. You help Amelia with the media.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I mean, I know you were ticked at Blair for telling me about your other husband.",
        "T\u00e9a: No.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a--",
        "T\u00e9a: No. I mean, yes, yes, I was, but that's not-- that--it wasn't--",
        "Todd: It wasn't why you pushed her out the window?",
        "T\u00e9a: No. I didn't push her out the window. It was an accident. It was an accident, Todd!",
        "Todd: Please.",
        "T\u00e9a: It was.",
        "[Crowd murmuring]",
        "Dorian: I'm going in the ambulance with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I have no idea if Matthew found a doctor already. My God, he's using a search engine to make major medical decisions.",
        "Bo: Maybe he's just researching background information.",
        "Nora: Online? Online? Gee, there's a reliable source for accurate information on delicate medical procedures.",
        "Bo: Nora--",
        "Nora: And nobody ever lies about their credentials or their success rate or their name online.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but we don't know that that's what he's doing. We're guessing right now, based on these pages.",
        "Nora: We have to stop him. We have to stop him.",
        "Bo: You have any suggestions?",
        "Nora: I'll file a motion. That's what I'll do. I'll call Elijah, get him on the phone. And if I can't do that, I'll file it myself.",
        "Bo: Good. Good. Do that. It can't hurt.",
        "Nora: It can't help, either, because we already lost the appeal.",
        "Bo: We'll cut him off.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Bo: He can't get an operation without money. We'll take him off the insurance. We'll pull the plug on his bank account.",
        "Nora: Appendix \"A.\"",
        "Bo: Huh?",
        "Nora: Back of the contract. T\u00e9a filed to make sure that Matthew had access to his trust fund for any medical procedures covered by the ruling.",
        "Bo: Bet you he made sure that it covers his legal expenses, too, huh? God forbid she miss a paycheck. Thanks, Pa.",
        "Nora: Oh, Bo.",
        "Bo: No. He's the reason that Matthew has money that we have no control over.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, this is not helping. How in the world do we stop this train wreck?",
        "Bo: We get on board.",
        "Nora: We--what?",
        "Bo: We can't stop him. He is going to find a doctor that will operate on him.",
        "Nora: And what? We just go along with it?",
        "Bo: No. We find the best surgeon that can do the operation.",
        "Nora: By all accounts, that's Greg Evans.",
        "Bo: Then we have to talk him into operating.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God. I can't believe where we are.",
        "Bo: But he's the devil we know. What else are we gonna do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: I am not the only doctor on earth who can do Matthew's surgery.",
        "Rachel: You sure made it sound that way.",
        "Greg: Yeah? Well, I'm pretty arrogant, didn't you hear?",
        "Rachel: Hey! I also heard a lot of happy patients, people who can walk now because of you.",
        "Greg: Yeah? Well, there's someone else you should check in with--fourth floor I.C.U. The name's Shaun. He didn't have anything nice to say about my skills.",
        "Rachel: Greg--",
        "Greg: In fact, he hasn't said anything at all since I operated on him.",
        "Rachel: That was different.",
        "Greg: No, that was me in all my glory. I can do nothing wrong. Take a bullet out of my brother's brain? No problem. I'm the greatest. That's what I told my family. Hell, that's what I told the world. I can heal anyone.",
        "Rachel: Does this make you feel good? Because it's really not helping anybody.",
        "Greg: It's the best that I've got, Rachel. And you're right. It wouldn't help your little brother one bit, but I'm being the best doctor I can be right now. I just got to get back to the beginning to get it right this time. Number one rule in medicine: First, do no harm.",

        "Paramedic: Patient fell from an upstairs window. Nobody moved her on the scene. Vitals steady, but she's unresponsive.",
        "Todd: Hey, man, what are you, 12 years old? No, no, no. I want the best doctor in this place right now. Hey, you are not allowed to check out on me. Hear me? You come back.",
