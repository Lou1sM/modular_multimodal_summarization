        "Dorian: You're not alone, Langston, not anymore.",
        "Langston: Really? Do you know something I don't?",
        "Dorian: No, of course not, but --",
        "Langston: But what? Death is pretty permanent, last I heard. For the past year and a half, no one has slept in this house but me. And since that doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon --",
        "Dorian: Of course, you're always going to miss your parents. It must've been awful for you, hearing how they died so suddenly, so tragically. But you are a powerful young woman. And now that the secret is finally out, I'm sure with time --",
        "Langston: Don't you dare tell me that I will be all right. I will never be all right again!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Hey, John? Did it go as bad as you look?",
        "John: That son of a bitch gave custody to Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Ooh! Oh, my God, this is so awesome! Did you hear that? We got custody!",
        "Cole: I know -- I was standing right here.",
        "Starr: So when is the baby coming home? I mean, we have to get his room ready, right?",
        "Blair: We've got a lot to do, you're right.",
        "Starr: Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited!",
        "Jack: Why are you yelling, Starr?",
        "Starr: Can I tell him?",
        "Blair: Sure, go ahead.",
        "Starr: Um -- our baby brother is coming home, Jack. Tonight, he's coming to live with us.",
        "Jack: Sweet!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: My God, she took him. She kidnapped him.",
        "Michael: No, that -- that's not possible.",
        "Todd: The hell it isn't. And you knew all along.",
        "Michael: Marcie, what did you do?",
        "Todd: You were stalling for time, weren't you? I want you to find this woman before she gets away with my son. Go. Go! Don't just walk out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: There's nothing to be scared of, ok? Mommy's here. We're just going for a little ride. Just the two of us, ok? That's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Huh. Langston?",
        "Langston: I don't want to talk anymore.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: Would it be ok if I said something?",
        "Langston: Since when has anybody ever stopped you?",
        "Dorian: When you found out that your parents had died, to have suffered through such a tragic loss all by yourself must have been awful. But now that you have shared this secret --",
        "Langston: \"Shared it\"? Is it called sharing when a person is forced to give something up? And you can stop feeling all good about yourself like you did something nice and mighty, because you didn't. I feel worse right now than I've ever felt in my entire life.",
        "Dorian: But that's because you've been suppressing the pain.",
        "Langston: You are not my shrink, and you don't know anything about me! So stop telling me what I'm feeling!",
        "Dorian: You couldn't have kept up the way you were. You can't keep living without an adult to supervise you, to -- to provide for you.",
        "Langston: Sure I can. And I was doing just fine -- being on my own and -- and making my own decisions about what to eat and what to watch on TV. And my parents left me plenty of money.",
        "Dorian: A girl your age needs more than just money.",
        "Langston: I have friends, too.",
        "Dorian: Yes, of course you do. And they would've been happy to help you if only you had told them the -- the truth.",
        "Langston: You just don't get it. I don't need help. I need to live my life and have everybody stop bothering me. My mother used to tell me that dignity was the most important thing that a person could have. And that means being strong, and not feeling sorry for yourself for being needy or pathetic.",
        "Dorian: It's not needy or pathetic to want your friends to support you when you're going through a difficult situation. Oh, Langston, you and Starr are so close. How could you have kept it from her?",
        "Langston: Because if I told anybody that -- that they had died, it would've made it real -- like it's doing right now.",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Dorian: Just --",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Dorian: You just stay. I'll take care of it.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Markko: Oh -- hi.",
        "Dorian: Hi. What can I do for you?",
        "Markko: What are you doing here?",
        "Dorian: I asked first.",
        "Markko: Well, I'm here to see Langston. She was supposed to be at my house for dinner. I've been calling, but her cell goes straight to voicemail, and -- is everything all right? Is she sick or something?",
        "Dorian: No, no, she's not sick. Um -- it's just that something came up and she can't, uh, see you tonight. But I -- I promise, she will call you -- quite soon.",
        "Markko: Wait -- I'm not going anywhere until I know Langston is ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you think our new baby brother likes cake?",
        "Blair: \"Cake\"? I think that's a good thing. I think he'll love it. Maybe you guys can whip one up.",
        "Jack: With ice cream?",
        "Starr: You know what? Actually, Cole, I don't think we should make him a cake with ice cream -- you know, Jack doesn't like it at all.",
        "[Jack makes face]",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Jack: And I can give him my stuffed animals, right, Mommy? Like my yellow bird?",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Cole: Yellow bird? Hey, you think maybe you can give me yellow bird, because he's kind of my favorite.",
        "Jack: You're too old.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Cole: Oh. All right.",
        "[Starr laughs]",
        "Jack: And I can give him my old books, too -- the easy ones, of course.",
        "Blair: Of course. You know what, sweetie? I think that is just a great idea.",
        "[Starr chuckles]",
        "Jack: And definitely fluffy bunny because he's really babyish.",
        "Starr: Wait, isn't that the one that you sleep with every night?",
        "Cole: Uh-oh.",
        "Jack: I do not!",
        "Starr: You do, too! What about last night and the night before?",
        "Jack: Stop!",
        "Blair: Stop it -- stop it -- hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you guys, this is supposed to be a really happy occasion. You know, we need to be civilized and sweet -- to each other!",
        "Starr: Did you hear that? \"Civilized and sweet\" -- do you even know what those words mean, Jack?",
        "Jack: Yeah -- they mean the opposite of what you are.",
        "Blair: Hey, hey, hey --",
        "Starr: Hey -- wow!",
        "Blair: Ok, the two of you, stop it right now. Here's what we need to do. You guys, start working on the cake. Come on, Jack, grab this. Let's go upstairs, go rough your toys --",
        "Starr: Help Mommy.",
        "[Starr laughs]",
        "Blair: He is going to help me -- and we're going to look for your old crib -- and you bake the cake, girlfriend.",
        "Jack: Fine.",
        "Starr: All righty. Ok, uh, chocolate cake recipe.",
        "Cole: Chocolate cake. You think chocolate's the way to go, huh?",
        "Starr: Uh -- yes. Tommy loved chocolate putting.",
        "Cole: That's right, the -- you're the only one in this family who knows anything about him.",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah, he is a great kid. I just -- I can't believe it. Not only do I have a baby brother, but he's actually going to spend the night here. And wait till he finds out that his babysitter is actually his sister -- not that he'll really get it, but -- oh, it's just so great. Why aren't you saying anything?",
        "Cole: You know I'm happy for you.",
        "Starr: Well, do you feel bad for Mrs. McBain?",
        "Cole: Don't you?",
        "Starr: Look, I -- I do, but feeling sorry for her isn't going to make it any easier.",
        "Cole: But still -- I mean, I just -- I can't get it out of my head. I can't imagine what she's going through tonight, knowing that she's losing her son, having to say goodbye. I can't help but feeling sorry for her.",
        "Starr: Cole, if you want to feel sorry for her, that's fine, but keep it to yourself. I don't want to hear about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You ok back there, angel, huh? I know we took off pretty fast, but I got some bottles and some grapes and crackers, ok? So as soon as you're hungry, we'll just -- we'll just stop and eat, all right? And if you want anything else, we'll just buy it whenever we -- whenever we get wherever we're going -- wherever that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You knew, McBain. You knew what she was doing in here, didn't you? You guys have been planning it for weeks.",
        "Yolanda: Gentlemen, this isn't the time to --",
        "Todd: Shut up! That's why you refused my offer to share custody -- you weren't going to share anything. That's why you came up with all that \"she needs time to say goodbye\" crap. I'll say she did. What are you staring at? You're probably in on it.",
        "Yolanda: No, Mr. Manning, I most certainly was not.",
        "Todd: Everyone wanted the McBains to keep the kid because I'm -- well, I'm Todd Manning, the most hated man in Llanview.",
        "Yolanda: We need to assess the situation --",
        "Todd: Assess my ass. How much are they paying you --",
        "Michael: You know what? Enough already, ok? Will you just shut up till we find out what's really going on?",
        "Todd: I don't think there's anything to find out. I think what happened is that little, insane, stupid wife of yours --",
        "Michael: That's enough!",
        "Todd: Kidnapped my kid!",
        "Officer: Knock it off!",
        "Second Officer: This isn't helping!",
        "Todd: Well, did you guys find her or not?",
        "Officer: Her car's not in the parking lot.",
        "Todd: You better get her back here, Michael. You better get her back here now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I'm sorry, John.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Bo: Obviously, this judge put a lot of weight on biology.",
        "John: I guess the marriage didn't hurt, either.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I heard about that marriage. I mean, I -- why didn't this judge see through that?",
        "John: He said it made him think that Manning was willing to do anything to provide a stable family unit or something like that.",
        "[Bo chuckles]",
        "Bo: You don't use \"Manning\" and \"stable\" in the same sentence.",
        "John: Well, we can second-guess it all we want. But it's over, it's done.",
        "Bo: Well, Mike and Marcie's attorney -- she'll put in for an appeal, right?",
        "John: These cases almost never get overturned. You and I both know that.",
        "Bo: Well, at least it buys them some time with Tommy. Won't it?",
        "John: The judge told Manning he could have his son tonight.",
        "Bo: You got to be kidding me.",
        "[John groans]",
        "John: How are they supposed to get through something like this? Hmm? That's their son, it's their life. What are they supposed to do, just hand him over? How does that make sense, Bo?",
        "Bo: It doesn't. But it doesn't the other way, either -- having Manning be deprived of his own son. I mean, the only good thing that you could say about him, he does love his kids.",
        "John: What about Tommy? Hmm? What about what he's being deprived of? Manning's a stranger to him.",
        "Bo: That'll change.",
        "John: Yeah. In the meantime, he cries himself to sleep every night because he doesn't know why his parents have disappeared. Then he wakes up in the morning and he cries even harder because they still aren't there. It's just not right, Bo. It's not right.",
        "Bo: Well, I know this really hurts, but you've got to stay out of it.",
        "John: I'm still here, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Well, look at you. Look at you -- you're wide awake, huh? You're usually out like a light after about five minutes in this car. You probably sense that it's a really big night. And you want to know something, kid? It is. We're going on a really big adventure, you know that? Just the two of us, all right? And no matter what happens, or where we go, Mommy is going to take really good care of you. I promise you that, ok? I'm not going to let you be unhappy or lonely. And it's ok. It's ok that you don't understand, because the truth is I don't really understand, either. I just -- I couldn't hand you over to Todd, I just couldn't do that. I couldn't let you go. I couldn't let you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Look, I don't know where Marcie is, ok? If I did, I would tell you. I -- hell, I'd go and get her myself.",
        "Todd: I want this man arrested for conspiracy.",
        "[Michael sighs]",
        "Todd: He and his wife have been planning this kidnapping since they found out they adopted my kid.",
        "Michael: Oh, come on.",
        "Officer: Sir, we have no evidence your son was --",
        "Todd: \"No evidence\"? Do you see the mother here? Do you see the baby here? Where the hell do you think they are at this time of night -- licking ice cream? Playing in the park? Pull your head out! I'm telling you, you better be calling her. Better get her back here.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: Mike, how you doing?",
        "Michael: Johnny. Man, we got a problem over here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It's Michael, he says there's a -- there's a problem yeah, go ahead.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Officer: We got a situation here, commissioner.",
        "John: She what?",
        "Officer: The mother went out the window.",
        "Bo: No, tell me she didn't really do that.",
        "Michael: Marcie's gone. She took Tommy and she's gone.",
        "John: Ok, listen to me. Hold tight. Bo and I are on our way.",
        "Bo: Don't let Manning go ballistic, I'll be right there.",
        "John: We have to go.",
        "Bo: Hey -- whoa, whoa, \"we\"? You're suspended.",
        "John: Marcie's just taken off with Tommy, there's nothing that's going to stop me from going after them, Bo.",
        "Bo: I know, I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Bo's on his way.",
        "Todd: Oh. Well, hallelujah about that, that's going to help. Listen, Michael, if you get your wife back here now, maybe -- maybe I won't press charges. Otherwise \u0096",
        "Yolanda: Have you tried to call Mrs. McBain?",
        "Todd: You better tell her if she doesn't bring my kid home right now, she's going to spend the rest of her life in prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Look, I was just being honest. I didn't mean to upset you, all right?",
        "Starr: Well, did you really think that it was going to cheer me up -- you constantly talking about how sorry you were for the McBains?",
        "Cole: You know, I saw that you guys were happy, and I just thought of them, that's all.",
        "Starr: So now all of a sudden we're ogres stealing their child from them?",
        "Cole: Ok, now you're just putting words in my mouth. Look, I understand it's just random bad luck that Mrs. McBain just so happened to adopt the kid -- the same kid your dad's been looking for. I understand that.",
        "Starr: Right, really, and -- and don't feel sorry for my dad at all, even though he went searching for that child for months. It was the only thing on his mind, he searched high and low, but, really, God forbid you feel sorry for him for a change.",
        "Cole: I know -- I know your dad went through hell, too. But the McBains are the ones losing their son. You and your family -- you won.",
        "Starr: So you think I should've just given up?",
        "Cole: No. No, not at all. Starr, I saw what you went through when your dad went missing. I want you to be happy, I really do, and I know that having your parents together is really important to you. And having a new baby brother around is just even better. I mean, I -- I get it, I get it. It's -- it's great, it really is.",
        "Starr: And do you know hat of a father my dad is, and how funny and smart, and how he would do anything in the world for us?",
        "Cole: Yes, I do know that -- because you've told me over and over again.",
        "Starr: Oh, don't --",
        "Cole: Starr, listen, I'm on your side, ok?",
        "Blair: Ok, the crib is all set up.",
        "[Blair giggles]",
        "Jack: And I put a whole bunch of action figures in the baby's room.",
        "Blair: That's right, and baseball cards.",
        "Jack: And stuffed animals like I said -- yours, too.",
        "Starr: Mine?",
        "Jack: Don't worry, not your stuffed tarantula.",
        "Cole: They make stuffed tarantulas?",
        "Jack: No, it's real -- it's on a piece of wood.",
        "Cole: Oh, that's -- that's sweet. Does it have a name?",
        "[Blair laughs]",
        "Starr: Um -- it was just a phase that I went through. Hey, Jack, come here.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Starr: Guess what -- I'm going to kill you.",
        "Blair: No, no, no --",
        "Jack: \"Ooh.\"",
        "Blair: You're going to get that all in your hair. Now, stop it, stop it. This looks really, really good. Let me see -- want to taste it?",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, it's already in the oven, thanks to Chef Thornhart.",
        "Jack: Great. You know how to bake?",
        "Starr: Yeah, actually, he knows more than how to bake. He's actually a really good cook.",
        "Blair: Well, well, well, you are just full of surprises.",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I can assure you Langston's just fine.",
        "Markko: I want to see that for myself. Oh, I knew it -- something's wrong. What happened?",
        "Langston: I can't talk about it right now.",
        "Dorian: It's something personal and private, and I think she needs to deal with it alone.",
        "Markko: Forget it. I'm not leaving until I know what's going on. Langston, tell me, please.",
        "Dorian: You know, Langston, maybe you should.",
        "Langston: It's my parents.",
        "Markko: Oh -- are they staying away even longer?",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Markko: Well, what is it, then did something happen to them? Were they hurt or something?",
        "Langston: There was an accident. They're dead.",
        "Markko: I'm so sorry. What happened? When did you find out?",
        "Dorian: Markko, I don't think she's ready to talk about the details right now.",
        "Markko: Right. Yeah, I get that. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Langston: No. There's -- there's nothing anyone can do.",
        "Markko: Hey, come home with me, ok? You can stay at my house I'm sure my parents would let you -- no, not even \"let you\" -- they would want you to. I mean, unless -- I don't even know. Do you have relatives you can call, aunts, uncles?",
        "Langston: No. There's no one.",
        "Dorian: That's where you're wrong. There's me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So what name should we put on the cake?",
        "Blair: The cake looks fine with just \"welcome home.\"",
        "Cole: All right, well, I think I'm going to take off.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Cole: Well, I don't think I should be here when your dad gets home with your baby brother. I think it should just be a family thing.",
        "Starr: Um, ok. I'll walk you out.",
        "Cole: All right, well, good luck. I hope it goes well.",
        "Blair: Thank you so much for helping with the cake, it's fantastic.",
        "Jack: See you, Cole.",
        "Cole: Let me know if you reconsider the whole yellow bird thing.",
        "Blair: Get out of here.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to. Bye.",
        "Starr: So why are you really leaving?",
        "Cole: I told you -- I think it should just be a family thing.",
        "Starr: And you feel uncomfortable?",
        "Cole: Yeah. I mean, it's kind of a big event, and I don't think there should be any outsiders.",
        "Starr: Since when are you an outsider? You afraid that you're going to show my Dad how you feel about the McBains?",
        "Cole: Ok, let's not start this again.",
        "Starr: Cole, you're my boyfriend and I want you to be on my side.",
        "Cole: I know, I'm -- I'm trying. Really, I am. I -- I know once I get to know your brother, that things will get easier.",
        "Starr: Look, I feel bad for the McBains, too, and I wish that there was a way that it could all work out so that nobody got hurt, but there just -- there wasn't.",
        "Cole: I -- I understand. I do. So let's not fight about this anymore, ok?",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Cole: Hey -- I love you.",
        "Starr: I love you, too.",
        "Cole: And, you know, I'm -- I'm happy that you're happy. And I'll call you in the morning, ok?",
        "Starr: Promise?",
        "Cole: First thing.",
        "Starr: Ok. Good night.",
        "Cole: Good night.",

        "Michael: She's not answering.",
        "Todd: Well, of course not. That's because I'm sure you guys worked out some kind of signal to let her know --",
        "Michael: You want to try her? Go ahead and try her. I'm telling you, she's n answering.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: What's going on?",
        "Todd: The bitch took my kid.",
        "John: Try saying that again. Hey -- hey, what's going on? What happened, Mike?",
        "Michael: Well, Marcie wanted to say goodbye to Tommy, you know, she didn't want me to be there, so I waited in the hall. You know, Todd showed up, I tried to open the door, it w locked, so Todd over there kicks my door in.",
        "John: He kicked the door in?",
        "Michael: Yeah. We came inside, the window was open, Marcie was gone, Tommy was gone. Cops checked in the parking lot, no car.",
        "John: All right, listen to me. All right, she'll be back, all right? She just had a hard time saying goodbye. I mean, this has just been hard for her.",
        "Todd: How -- how the hell do you know what she's going through, John? Seems to me you're just stalling like he is, giving her more time.",
        "John: Mike, where could she have went? All right, what -- what did she take with her?",
        "Bo: John? Not your case.",
        "Todd: Oh, finally somebody admits this has been a crime.",
        "Bo: We don't know that yet.",
        "Todd: Oh, the hell we don't. Let me tell you, man, if -- if I had taken this kid, you'd be out there with some bloodhounds after me.",
        "Bo: Michael, you tried to call Marcie?",
        "Michael: Yeah, I tried. She's -- she's not answering the phone.",
        "Bo: Would you try again, please?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Michael: Voicemail.",
        "Todd: Oh, God, this is such bull. Man, they are in on it together. He knows exactly where she is, he knows exactly where she's going. Arrest him, and make him give her up!",

        "Langston: Yeah. Sure. Markko do you want me to come wit",
        "Dorian: That shouldn't be necessary. Starr was home when I left, and -- and Langston's going to have her best girlfriend with her.",
        "Markko: Ok. If that's what you want. But if you need anything, anything at all, you call me.",

        "Blair: Hey, bud, you are going to have all the time in the world, all right? But what I need for you to do t now is to go upstairs, double-check the crib, and maybe put all the stuffed animals really neat and cozy in the crib. What do you say?",
        "Jack: Ok.",
        "Blair: Ok?",
        "Jack: But call me when they get here.",

        "Blair: I don't know, sweetie. I know the judge had a social worker to come over to make sure the transfer went smoothly.",

        "Bo: Now, look, that's enough, all right? How long ago did Marcie leave?",
        "Michael: Like, an hour ago.",
        "Todd: As far as I'm concerned, that's plenty of time to get to the airport, get out of the country.",
        "Michael: \"Out of the country\"? What are you talking about? You think Tommy has a passport? It's impossible.",
        "Todd: Oh, come on, you guys had this all planned out!",
        "John: Hey, look, things are bad enough without you running your mouth.",
        "Bo: How much money did she have with her?",
        "Michael: Well, I -- we don't really keep a lot of cash around the house, but I know that she had credit cards and she had our -- she had our debit card.",
        "Bo: All right, I want you to get the names and the numbers on all the accounts from Dr. McBain, and also find out when and where the last time that those cards were used, all right?",
        "Michael: Listen, all of our cards are -- are the same, you know, the accounts are shared, so --",
        "Bo: You know, John, less than an hour -- she couldn't have gotten far.",
        "Todd: Are you guys not going to go look for her?",
        "Bo: She may come in of her own volition, Manning.",
        "Todd: Well, even if she does, I want her charged.",
        "Bo: Well, of course you do, because all you want is your son back in your life, and to hell with everybody else. For the first time in your life, you're going to have to think of someone other than you. I mean, have some compassion about what this poor woman's going through.",
        "Todd: What the hell does that mean? What about what I've been going through? You know, I thought this kid was dead, and I just get him back, man. I just get to the point where I know he's mine, and this crazy woman takes him.",
        "Michael: That's it, those are the cards that we have.",

        "Starr: Maybe they're just taking their time saying goodbye to him -- though, I don't know whether Dad would let them.",
        "Blair: No. All he wanted to do was go over there, pick up the baby, and come home. He wouldn't give them the time to do anything extra.",
        "Starr: Yeah, that is something Dad would do.",
        "Blair: Yeah. That bothers you?",
        "Starr: Well, yeah. I mean, I -- I guess Dad is angry because he felt deprived of his son for so long. But the McBains -- they were great parents, and I saw that when I baby-sat for them. I mean, Mrs. McBain didn't even want to leave Tommy for an hour, and she would always call and check up on him. It's just a sad thing, that's all.",
        "Blair: Yeah. It's sad.",
        "Starr: I just wish that Dad would see their side of the story for once.",

        "Bo: Manning, what do you really want here, huh?",
        "Todd: What do you think I want? I'd like my son.",
        "Bo: Exactly. So why don't you let us figure out the best way for us to get you your son back with the least amount of trouble?",
        "Officer: Sir, it's now been two hours.",

He lied to me for a really long time, and I am -- I'm just not sure I can trust him anymore. So right now it's just you and me, all right? It's just the two of us. And I know that you don't understand, but, look, you will, all right? You'll understand one day, and you will know that this was for the best. I promise.",

        "Todd: You know what's a travesty -- actually, what's tragedy, Michael, is that my son was living next to me, essentially. In the same neighborhood for months -- I didn't know. But you did, didn't you? You did, and you said nothing. Let me tell you something else -- any woman who would take someone else's kid and climb out a window and take him is anything but responsible.",

        "Todd: Yeah?",
        "Michael: Everybody knows that.",
        "Todd: And now she's a criminal -- just like you. And if she crosses that state line, do you know what happens? This kidnapping becomes a federal offense, and she's going to go away a long time. But, you know, the positive thing about that is then I can deal with the FBI instead of you jerks.",

        "Bo: I'll tell you what, Manning. Until I tell you otherwise, this is my case, it's not the FBI's. You interfere with it, I'll have you arrested.",
        "Michael: Bo? You didn't have to call in an APB. You know, my -- my wife was upset, she went out. I'm -- I'm sure she's much more calm now. She's probably on her way home.",
        "Todd: Like hell she is. She's probably halfway to the border by now. This woman is a basket case in the best of circumstances, I don't know why she'd be calmed down now -- ahem -- especially when she knows she's committed a crime.",
