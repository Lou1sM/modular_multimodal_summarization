        "Jared: I can't believe you're still mad at me.",
        "Natalie: I have a right to be.",
        "Jared: What, because I called you a college dropout?",
        "Natalie: Aha. There you go again. You know what -- I never should have come with you to Capricorn.",
        "Jared: Admit it -- you had a good time. Timbaland -- he was great. And I forgave you for spilling the drink in my lap. Natalie you had that coming. Now, I just want to forget that this night ever happened and focus on my meeting with Jim.",
        "Jared: Don't worry about it. We'll dazzle him, and your father.",
        "Natalie: Dazzling is your department. I like to do hard work. Ok? And Jim wants a list of specific business in emerging markets. First thing, I plan to give it to him.",
        "Jared: I'm telling you, I'm all over it. I'll write the report, I'll have it for you to look at first thing in the morning. You go home, get a good night's sleep.",
        "Natalie: Why would I do that?",
        "Jared: Because you look tired. Seriously, I know how hard you work. I just thought you could use a break.",
        "Natalie: No. No, no, no. You're up to something, and I think I have a pretty good idea of what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Hey.",
        "Clint: Hi.",
        "Nora: What are you doing here? I thought you were having dinner with Dorian.",
        "Clint: Yeah, so did I but she blew me off. Said something important came up.",
        "Nora: Oh. She didn't tell you what it was?",
        "Clint: No. She said she'd call me later, and I'm sure she will.",
        "Nora: Maybe her masseur got a last-minute cancellation.",
        "Clint: Nora, that's not quite fair.",
        "Nora: Are you kidding? I'd break a date for a massage.",
        "Clint: Dorian is trying to change. She's trying to think before she acts, or she doesn't act. Anyway, she said it was important. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Nora: Are things getting serious with Dorian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston, what -- what happened? Are you ok?",
        "Dorian: Go ahead, tell her.",
        "Langston: Remember how I said my parents were coming home this week?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: They're not. They're not coming home this week, or next week. They're not coming home at all.",
        "Blair: Well, what do you mean, sweetie? What do you --",
        "Langston: I've been lying to you guys. My parents are -- they're dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Marcie, honey -- thank God. How are you?",
        "Todd: Well, the hell with how she is. How's my son?",
        "John: Shut up.",
        "Bo: Hey, we made contact with her. We don't want to scare her off now.",
        "Michael: Marcie, are you ok?",
        "Marcie: Tommy and I are fine, Michael, ok? Look, I just -- I just couldn't hand our son over to Todd.",
        "Michael: You know, I -- I get that, sweetie, but you have to know, this isn't the way to handle this.",
        "Marcie: Do I? Do I know Michael?",
        "Michael: Marcie, you have to come home, ok? You have to come home now, and you have to bring Tommy with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I like Dorian. Quite a lot, as a matter of fact. And believe me, Nora, no one is more surprised by that than me. And before you say anything -- people are not hunks of granite, ok? Dorian has changed, I have changed. And right now, at this particular moment, I enjoy her company. And she keeps me on my toes.",
        "Nora: Ok. It's not your toes I'm worried about. It's your back.",
        "Clint: I appreciate your concern, but I'm a big boy.",
        "Nora: And I should mind my own business, right?",
        "Clint: When has that ever stopped you?",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: I'm sorry. I just always see you with Viki.",
        "Clint: And I still see you with Bo.",
        "Nora: Ah. Touch\u00e9. Bo and I work together, you know. We may not always be on the same page, but we've managed to remain friends. And we raise Matthew together, and I don't think we could have done any of those things if we didn't know that what we had as a couple was over.",
        "Clint: Ah. Well, you see, that's the way it is with Viki and me.",
        "Nora: Really? Because I know how Viki felt about you when you chose Dorian.",
        "Clint: Oh, now, you wait a minute now. Viki was not interested in me. Viki was interested in keeping me away from Dorian, all right?",
        "Nora: I'm sorry. God, Matthew's right. I keep bringing my D.A. persona into my personal life, and you must hate being cross-examined in your own home.",
        "Clint: No, if I did, I wouldn't have asked you and Matthew to stay here permanently.",
        "Nora: Hmm.",
        "Clint: Which, by the way, you have not given me an answer.",
        "Nora: Well, I have given your very generous offer a lot of thought.",
        "Clint: And?",
        "Nora: And being under Asa's roof is -- um -- see, I've always been used to taking care of myself, and --",
        "Matthew: What about me? Don't I get a say in where we're going to live?",
        "Nigel: Oh, dear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You're trying to screw me over, aren't you?",
        "Jared: What?",
        "Natalie: You have no intention of doing any work so that Jim comes in in the morning furious, and then marches right up to my father and convinces him to fire me.",
        "Jared: And why would I want to screw you -- or?",
        "Natalie: Because of what you said at Capricorn tonight. You want to make a name for yourself here at B.E., and you want me out of the way.",
        "Jared: First of all, what I said was, if you don't like working with me, you're going to be the one that has to go. Secondly, I blow the report tomorrow, I get fired, not you. So let me give you another scenario. Go home, get rid of the dark circles under your eyes, I'll write the report, do a fantastic job. In the morning, we both look like heroes.",
        "Natalie: And then you claim all the credit, make me look like a fool, and take my job.",
        "Jared: I don't want your job.",
        "Natalie: Oh, please. You're not -- you're going to tell me at you don't want to climb up the company ladder?",
        "Jared: Of course I do, but I've set my sights much higher than you, and my plans don't involve stepping on you.",
        "Natalie: Oh, so my job's not good enough for you? Is that it?",
        "Jared: I couldn't get your job if I wanted it. My last name's not \"Buchanan.\"",
        "Natalie: Ok, you know what? Why don't we just settle this all right now, ok?",
        "Jared: Ok.",
        "Natalie: Ok? Yeah, all right -- maybe my grandfather hired me because this is the family business, ok? But he saw an interest in me, and he saw -- he saw that I took an interest in the company, and he wanted to take a chance on me -- all right? And maybe I didn't get to prove myself to him, but I am going to prove myself to everyone in this world that -- that he was not wrong about me. All right? So maybe my last name is \"Buchanan,\" and maybe I don't have a college degree, but at least I didn't lie on my resume, and I did not blackmail anyone into hiring me.",
        "Jared: That was an impressive little speech.",
        "Natalie: Shut up!",
        "Jared: You're still trying to sell yourself, huh?",
        "Natalie: I don't need to sell myself.",
        "Jared: I especially like the whole \"I'm all about hard work\" thing. That's -- that's a big change for you.",
        "Natalie: You know, you think know everything about me, but you don't.",
        "Jared: I never step into anything without doing my research. I've read the articles. I know everything there is to know about Natalie Balsom Buchanan Laurence Vega Buchanan.",
        "Natalie: Well, then you have a one-up on me, because all I know about you is that you are obnoxious and an arrogant jerk. Ld you like to hear the rest of my credits?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston, your parents are dead? When -- when did you find out? What have you been lying about?",
        "Dorian: Honey, if this is too difficult for you, you know, we can -- you don't need to talk about now.",
        "Langston: No, it's ok. I -- I need to talk about it. I -- I'm not going to lie anymore.",
        "Blair: Dorian, how did you get involved in all this?",
        "Dorian: Why don't we all just sit down, ok? Starr, Blair, come on.",
        "Blair: Sit down.",
        "Dorian: Ok. Why don't you just tell them the same way that you told me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Keep her on the line.",
        "Michael: Marcie? Marcie, honey, you still there?",
        "Marcie: Yes. I'm still here, but I am not coming home. I can't, Mike. I just -- I can't give Tommy up.",
        "Michael: Whew.",
        "John: Can I talk to her?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "John: Hey, Marcie, it's John. Listen -- listen, I know why you're doing this, but you're making a mistake.",
        "Marcie: The only person that made a mistake was the judge.",
        "John: Ok, and we can talk about that when you get here. You bring Tommy back now, this all can be over.",
        "Marcie: I bring Tommy back now, John, and my life will be over.",
        "John: The longer it takes for you to get back, the worse it's going to be for you. But if you come back now -- you come back now, Bo's willing to make a deal.",
        "Todd: What? What the hell are you talking about? What kind of deal are you going to make with her?",
        "Bo: You want her to keep running? Keep yelling.",
        "John: Marcie, if you come back now, we can work something out. But you have to do the right thing.",
        "Marcie: I want to talk to Michael.",
        "John: Ok. She wants to talk to you.",
        "Michael: Marcie -- honey, you -- you got to come home. Look, if you come home now, there won't be any trouble. But you have to come home.",
        "Marcie: What home, Mike? Hmm? What do I have to come home to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I was working in a bar.",
        "Natalie: Oh! Well, absolutely fantastic. Maybe should get you a raise.",
        "Jared: I was working in a bar to help pay for my tuition. I was getting my M.B.A.",
        "Natalie: Right. I think I read that on your resume.",
        "Jared: Yeah, I can get you the registrar's number if you wan it.",
        "Natalie: No, no. Ok, Master's -- continue.",
        "Jared: And then I met your lovely sister. She set me up, I went to prison.",
        "Natalie: You told me that part.",
        "Jared: Well, when I got out of jail, I found out I'd been expelled from the program. I had no job, no money, and a prison record -- all because Jessica thought it was funny to set up some guy who had the hots for her.",
        "Natalie: Well, look, Jess was Tess then. She was really sick.",
        "Jared: Yeah, so you say.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry for what happened.",
        "Jared: I'll bet.",
        "Natalie: No, really. I mean, it had to have been a bad break for you.",
        "Jared: Wh-- a -- a bad break? Ok, losing 100 bucks at the track -- that's a bad break. What happened to me is a little more than a bad break, ok? But -- but I don't let a little prison time or -- or losing everything stop me. I'm too smart. I got to start somewhere.",
        "Natalie: Look, we started off on the wrong foot here. We're going to be working together every day, and I am really sorry about what happened. Can we please just call a truce?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell anyone?",
        "Langston: I was afraid that if I told anybody, social services would come and take me away.",
        "Starr: Langston, I will never let that happen to you. I -- I can't believe you did this for so long.",
        "Langston: I may be a liar, but I'm not stupid.",
        "Starr: So you woke up every morning alone, and came home every night to an empty house?",
        "Langston: I miss them so much.",
        "Blair: Oh.",
        "Langston: There are so many things that I'll never be able to tell them. And I never even got to say goodbye.",
        "Starr: Oh, Langston --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What are you saying?",
        "Marcie: I am saying that my home is with my son, and that is no longer possible in Llanview.",
        "Michael: Well, what about me? You know? What -- what about us?",
        "Marcie: There stopped being an \"us,\" Michael, when you didn't tell me the truth about Tommy.",
        "Michael: Marcie, honey, I never stopped loving you, and -- look, I know that you still love me, ok? We can get through this, ok? We -- we can start again. Now, it won't be easy. We're going to have to mourn for what we've lost, but we will survive this, Marcie. We've lost a lot. But we haven't lost everything. Not if you still love me as much as I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: I am terribly sorry for the intrusion. Master Matthew and I were about to play a rousing game of demon blasters on the woo. We didn't mean to interrupt the adults.",
        "Matthew: I'm glad we interrupted. I get a say in this, too, you know.",
        "Nora: Of course, you do, Matthew. I -- I know you like being here because of all the -- the fun things that are here and fun things to do --",
        "Clint: Like a woo.",
        "Nora: Like a woo.",
        "Matthew: I don't want to stay here because of the cool stuff we had. Remember what it was like when our house burned down?",
        "Nora: Well, of course I do, sweetheart. It was horrible.",
        "Matthew: Yeah. But it wasn't because of all the cool stuff we had. It was because of the people -- our friends, our family, the memories.",
        "Nora: Well, I'm not quite following you.",
        "Matthew: Remember when Jen was there? And she brought a big bottle of soda? And it dropped and then she put it back up on the counter? And then Rex came and he opened it, and soda was shooting everywhere. It was pouring out on his ears and sunglasses.",
        "Nora: Yeah, and all over my rug. I'd forgotten about that.",
        "Matthew: I didn't forget. And when I was little, Dad used to pick me up right to the ceiling to take the crepe paper down after a party. And I used to think he was going to drop me, but he never did, because I was so high up in the air.",
        "Nora: I remember.",
        "Matthew: See, if we buy a new house, we're going to have to start all over making new memories. And right here at Grandpa's house, we already have a bunch of memories. Now, how am I going to hear all the stories about Grandpa if we move away and live on our own? See, I mean, this isn't just a big place with a bunch of stuff in it. It feels like our home. Now do you get it?",
        "Nora: Yeah. Loud and clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: So what next?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Blair: Oh. That must be Dad. He should have been me with the baby by now.",
        "Dorian: The baby?",
        "Langston: Oh, my God. I forgot all about your dad's case. How did it go? He won?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Oh, he did.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Well, it wasn't \u0096",
        "Starr: It wasn't Dad?",
        "Blair: Todd -- no. It was Clyde at \"The Sun\" talking about some story.",
        "Dorian: You mean the McBains had to give up the baby tonight?",
        "Blair: Yeah. When the decision came down, it was awful for them. Yeah, you know, Todd was thrilled, and he's -- he's probably just giving them some time to say goodbye.",
        "Langston: Oh, I'm so happy for you. I'm sorry to cry on your big celebration.",
        "Blair: Langston --",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me?",
        "Blair: You stop it. We care about you, you got that?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: We can still celebrate the baby.",
        "Langston: Oh, thank you. I should get going.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Starr: Langston, no.",
        "Dorian: Absolutely not. There is no way you are ever spending another night alone in that house.",
        "Langston: No, but I --",
        "Blair: Absolutely.",
        "Dorian: We can set her up in there, and --",
        "Blair: Right.",
        "Dorian: Come on. And you know you'll be bunking in with her tonight because you got so much to talk about.",
        "Blair: Starr, you go in and you get her fixed up, ok, sweetheart?",
        "Starr: Ok. Call me if -- and when -- Dad gets home with the baby.",
        "Blair: I will, I will.",
        "Langston: Thanks.",
        "Dorian: You're quite welcome.",
        "Blair: Langston -- we're glad you're here.",
        "Dorian: Good night, girls.",
        "Starr and Langston: Good night.",
        "Blair: Wow. Kids are amazingly strong.",
        "Dorian: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Her parents are dead, and she just keeps moving on.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. For a whole year and a half. Well, thank heaven it's all out in the open now.",
        "Blair: Thank heaven? How about thank you?",
        "Dorian: Oh --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Marcie, I love you. Do you hear me? I love you. I only did what I did because I love you. That's got to mean something.",
        "Marcie: I just can talk right now, ok? I -- I have to -- I just have to think. I'm going to -- I'll call you back.",
        "Michael: She hung up again.",
        "Todd: She hung up? Oh, that's great. What do you guys want to do now?",
        "Michael: I don't know. I mean, I -- I think -- I think I was getting through to her, you know? She said she was going to call back.",
        "Todd: Perfect. When is the FBI coming in? Please tell me you notified the FBI.",
        "Bo: Don't tell me how to do my job.",
        "Todd: Well, somebody's got to. This woman has kidnapped my son.",
        "John: It doesn't become a kidnapping case till we know Marcie's not coming back.",
        "Todd: E you serious? While he was on the phone with her, she's probably driving to buffalo.",
        "Bo: Well, it's my call, Manning, and if I determine that she's not coming back, then I will call the FBI.",
        "John: Look, she just made a mistake. Her instinct is to do the right thing, right?",
        "Bo: Our best hope is the -- is that she comes back on her own.",
        "Todd: \"Our best hope\" -- huh, our best hope -- so I'll just sit here and I'll just hope that Marcie feels bad enough to turn the car around. No, I'm afraid you're going to have to do better than that.",
        "Michael: Johnny --",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Michael: Listen. When she does come home, what's going to happen? I mean, can you promise me that -- well, she's not going to go to jail?",
        "John: I can't promise you anything, Mike. It's in Marcie's hands now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I really do love your daddy, ok? You have to know that. But I love you, too, and -- God, I just don't know what to do. I -- I can't have you both, ok? So they won't let me, and I just -- huh -- pretty soon, we're going to need money, and then if we go back to Llanview, then I just -- damn it, I don't know what to do! Tommy, I wish that you could just tell me what we're supposed to do. But I can't ask you that. Because I am the -- I'm the one, I'm the one. I'm supposed to know what to do. I'm supposed to know what to do. And I do. I know what I have to do. I have to do what's best for you.",
        "Todd: And you're just dragging your feet because you hate me.",
        "Bo: I don't hate you, Manning. I don't care enough about you to hate you.",
        "Todd: See?",

        "Michael: Marcie? Honey, is that you?",
        "Marcie: I've made a decision.",
        "Michael: Marcie, honey, I'm -- I'm here. Go on.",
        "Marcie: This is really difficult for me, ok?",
        "Michael: Yeah, I know -- I know it's hard, honey. It's hard for both of us, ok? And you got to remember -- what you got to remember is that we are both -- we're both together on this thing, ok? So -- honey, tell me where you are, and I will come and get --",
        "Todd: Listen, you crazy bitch, you bring my son back right now! Right now, or I will hunt you down and drag you back! And you will never see my son again! You will never see him again, you understand me?",
        "Marcie: No! That is my son and I am never going to bring him back, do you hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: When I was little, they used to take me with them to the Columbian rainforest, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka. And then when school started, we'd just go for the summer. They'd help deliver medical supplies, take food to the orphanages, help rebuild huts that had been destroyed by typhoons or earthquakes. I should have been with them.",
        "[Langston sighs]",
        "Starr: Langston, don't say that. If -- if you were, then I would have never met you.",
        "Langston: You're still glad you did? Now that you know?",
        "Starr: Right. Just because you didn't tell me that your parents were dead, I'm just going to drop you as a friend?",
        "Langston: I would understand.",
        "Starr: Ok, I -- I guess I get why you didn't tell anybody, but me? Langston, you can tell me anything. I'm your best friend!",
        "Langston: I know. I was -- I was scared. And plus, I -- I had told the lie so many times -- that my parents were coming home tomorrow or the next week -- that I started to believe it. I thought that if I kept it quiet, no one would get hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You worried about Todd?",
        "Blair: You know what worries me? Is that all this funny stuff was going on with Langston, and I never even suspected it.",
        "Dorian: Oh, honey, nobody suspected. She was very good at covering. Teachers didn't know. Nobody knew. Don't beat yourself up.",
        "Blair: You knew. How?",
        "Dorian: Well, there seemed to be -- you know, why would a kid like that spend so many nights at other people's houses? You know, so I just thought she was abused child, and I started investigating. And when I found out that even her best friend, Starr, had never met her parents --",
        "Blair: She always seemed so together to me. I mean, really.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, but too together. Do you know what I mean? Too resourceful and too fine with the idea of being, you know, on her own all alone.",
        "Blair: She won't be alone anymore. I mean, she has us, and she has Starr.",
        "Dorian: Yeah.",
        "Blair: It's ok.",
        "Dorian: She has us.",
        "Blair: Dorian, you know we're going to have to tell somebody about this.",

        "Jared: You serious?",
        "Natalie: Yes.",
        "Jared: Am I supposed to trust you?",
        "Natalie: Like I said before, it's stupid for us to continue to argue when we have to work with each other every day. Can't we just try and get along?",
        "Jared: And what exactly does \"getting along\" entail?",
        "Natalie: You shut up about my family connections, I'll shut up about your fake resume. We treat each other with respect, and we work for the good of the company. How does that sound?",
        "Jared: Hmm. I'm good with it if you are.",
        "Natalie: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Jared: Well, if you don't know, I'm losing my touch.",
        "Natalie: I asked you never to touch me again, and then you stick your tongue down my throat?",
        "Jared: What are you more upset about, the fact that I kissed --",
        "Natalie: You son of a bitch! You are fired. Are you like me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Can I ask you something?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: What were those phone calls that you supposedly got from them when we were together?",
        "Langston: I would set my phone to ring. I'd only -- I'd only be pretending to talk to them. I -- I didn't want you or anybody else to get suspicious. So don't be rd on yourself. I was really good at hiding it.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you were.",
        "Langston: But it started getting harder. I mean, the closer I got to you and Markko, the more I had to lie to you, the more I had to trick you.",
        "Starr: Markko and I care about you so much, Langston, and --",
        "Langston: I know and I hated lying to you, I really did. And -- and now that the truth is out, I don't -- I don't know what's going to happen to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Matthew, you express yourself very well and I want you to know that you are always welcome here at pa's house. But I think this is a decision that has to be made by your mother.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, thank you for that, Clint.",
        "Renee: No, no. No. For the record, I support Matthew's opinion. Asa loved having you here. You're family. Your being here these weeks without Asa has meant the world to me. This house is too big for Nigel, Clint, me. It needs to be filled with Buchanans.",
        "Nora: Oh, Renee, I -- I don't think having Matthew and me move in here was going to fill this big house.",
        "Renee: Well, it's a start. And I hope that I'm making an offer that you cannot refuse.",
        "Clint: This old house needs you o to liven it up a little bit.",
        "Nigel: And Mr. Buchanan would be so pleased to think of the next generation growing up here.",
        "Nora: Ok, ok, ok. We would be honored to accept your generous offer --",
        "Matthew: Yes!",
        "Clint: Good decision, good decision!",
        "Renee: Oh! You know, what this family needs is a celebration. Let's make a party. What do you say?",
        "Clint: A housewarming party for Matthew and Nora.",
        "Renee: Yes, and we will invite the whole family. And we can also ask that nice young man to join us.",
        "Clint: What -- what nice young man?",
        "Renee: The young man who came to see me, who just started working at Buchanan Enterprises. Jared Banks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Jared Banks, yes. Natalie just hired him.",
        "Nigel: Indeed.",
        "Renee: Oh, Clint, he reminds me so much of the young Asa. And I promised that I would invite him to dinner.",
        "Clint: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Renee, are you doing a little matchmaking here?",
        "Renee: Well, she is single. And I mean, who knows, Clint? Maybe Natalie and Jared will hit it off.",

        "Natalie: Get out.",
        "Jared: You can't fire me.",
        "Natalie: Really? Because I think I just did.",
        "Jared: We have a contract.",
        "Natalie: Right, and I think if I told anyone what just happened here, they would agree that making sexual advances on the boss -- it's considered a breach of contract.",
        "Jared: Oh, you know -- wait a second. Did --",
        "Natalie: No, I think \"you\" need to wait a second. You are damn lucky that I am not pressing charges of sexual harassment against you right now. You think it was hard getting a job before? Try getting one with that hanging over your head.",
        "Jared: Come on, it was a joke, ok?",
        "Natalie: Oh, a joke? Let me tell you something, Mr. Jared Banks. You can throw a lot of crap at me, and I'll take it. But when some jackass comes in and makes a play like that on a woman -- any woman, boss or not -- well, honey, I ain't laughing.",
        "Jared: Ok. I'm sorry. Is that what you want to hear?",
        "Natalie: No. What I want to hear is the door closing as you're walking out.",
        "Jared: Do you remember our agreement, when I started working here? You give me a job, and I don't call the Atlantic City P.D. and make your sister's life a living hell. You cancel your end of the bargain, I cancel mine. Think about it, carefully. Is that really what you want?",

        "Michael: What are you talking about? She was coming around, man.",
        "Todd: No, this is kidnapping now! Now, listen to me -- you have dragged your feet long enough. Do something now!",
        "Bo: Calm down. To: Don't tell me to calm down.",
        "Bo: Hey, we're doing everything we can to make sure that Marcie and Tommy get back here safely. Nora will issue a statement of wrongdoing.",
        "Michael: Bo --",
        "Bo: We have to do that if we're going to involve the FBI.",
        "Todd: Aren't you FBI? Can't you do something?",
        "John: I used to be FBI. Right now, I'm not even Llanview P.D.",
        "Todd: Well, what are you waiting for, then? Get Nora on the line, get her to do what you need her to do. And you, don't think about helping him again.",
        "John: Oh, yeah, wouldn't dream of it.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's bull. You helped them out, you protected Marcie and Michael before by keeping the truth from me. Man, if the law meant anything, you'd be in jail right now for -- what, perjury on the stand? You'd be in jail for obstruction of justice.",
        "Bo: This case will be run properly. Now, why don't you go home, and I'll call you if we have any news.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm not going to sit at home and wait for news. I'm going to find this kid with or without you.",
        "Bo: It doesn't matter how we feel about this guy. The law has determined that he is the custodial parent. Now, I need a list of everybody that you think Marcie might get in contact with, all right? And, John, I don't want anybody taking the law into their own hands, ok?",
        "John: Wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Bo: I'll be in touch.",

        "Natalie: I don't like being threatened or blackmailed. And I know that no matter what I do, you're going to take what happened with Jessica and hold it over my head and keep demanding more and more. And that stops here. Because let me tell you something, pal. Jessica didn't want me to hire you for this job. She wanted to be able to protect herself in some other way. And you know what? I'm going to help her now. So get out!",

        "Nigel: Pardon me for speaking out of turn, but when Mr. Banks came to the house, I also had a chance to meet him. I know it's not my place to say anything --",
        "Clint: Oh, nonsense, Nigel. Of course it's your place to say something. I respect your opinion. Now -- what's your take?",
        "Nigel: I found the gentleman rather obsequious in his adoration of the late Mr. Buchanan.",
        "Clint: He's boot-licking?",
        "Nigel: Precisely. But Mrs. Buchanan is too lost in her grief to see it. And as far as his resemblance to your father --",

        "Nora: Yeah, you want to talk privately?",

        "Nora: Oh, dear.",
        "Bo: There's more. Now Marcie seems to have taken off with Tommy.",

        "Bo: No, no, like not coming back.",
        "Nora: Ok. Thank you. I'll get right on that. Excuse me.",
        "Bo: All right. Thank you. All right, bud, come here. The old man needs a hug. Oh!",
