        "Antonio brings Bree to Nash's place and finds him passed out on the floor and the house messy. Nash seems to have forgotten that he was to spend the day with the baby that day. He will take the child but Antonio refuses to give the girl to him. \"You are hung over and not prepared for this.\" Nash isn't sure why Antonio is doing this to him, but then it suddenly comes to him that this is about he and Jessica kissing the night before. Antonio doesn't believe that there was any kiss between them, and even if there had been, Antonio isn't sure what the point it that Nash would be trying to make. Nash knows that after seeing the changes in Jessica lately, and her punching Claudia, it shouldn't be too hard to see what point Nash is trying to make. Rex and Adriana are with Layla at the apartment when Vincent comes banging on the door to get in. She doesn't want to see him. He will not go. Rex opens the door and Vincent tries to get in. Rex warns him that he can defend himself but Vincent isn't phased. Cristian shows up and tells that if Layla doesn't want to see him, then she won't see him. Vincent tries again to make Cristian see that he and Layla are the two most important people to him. Doesn't work. Vincent tells Layla from across the room that he loves her and when she wants him back, he will be waiting. Asa fires Nigel when he asks Jessica to get the secret out of Asa that he is hiding, about the picture. Asa tells her about the picture that he found on himself after passing out long ago. David walks in just as Jessica is asking about the picture. \"It is my mother isn't it?\" Jessica leaves so the men can talk alone. David tells that his mother's maiden name is Bradley, and both he and Spencer have that as a middle name. When Asa tells that the woman was one of the great loves of his life, David asks. \"Are you my father?\" Antonio and Cristian talk about Vincent and how they are going to watch him, and bring him in if he screws up, even a little bit. Antonio looks up and sees Jessica walking in the park. He asks her why she didn't mention that she had been kissing with Nash the night before. \"He kissed me. He was drunk and it didn't mean anything. Antonio has to wonder. She punches Claudia when she learns the woman slept with Nash, and now she keeps the secret of them sharing a kiss. \"Do you have feelings for Nash?\""

        "David: Oh, I live here.",
        "Viki: You live here? Since when?",
        "David: Since last night. You know, it's serendipitous that you stopped by this morning because I thought I might let you offer me a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Ok. Nash? Huh. Looks like your daddy could use a housekeeper, huh, Bree? Nash? Ah. Well, I guess he doesn't get to visit with you after all, mija. His loss. Que pasa, hmm? Let's go see where that noise came from.",
        "Nash: Oh, it's you. [Bree coos] Hey. Brennan. Ahem. What time is it?",
        "Antonio: It's time for you to get your act together.",

        "Jessica: Hey, Grandpa.",
        "Asa: Jessie. You are -- you are a sight for sore eyes.",
        "Jessica: Look at you. I didn't even know you knew what a computer was, and what are you doing? Are you surfing the gossip pages?",
        "Asa: Far from it. I just made 50 grand.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Asa: Online trading.",
        "Jessica: Oh, you're kidding.",
        "Asa: Pay for Bree's college education.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, maybe a semester of it.",
        "Asa: Huh. You're so right.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. Anyways, I'm so happy that you're home.",
        "Asa: You have no idea how great it feels to be home to see your beautiful face and your sister's. Poor kid. How is she?",
        "Jessica: Not well.",
        "Asa: She was in love with McBain with all her heart.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, she was. I'm worried about her. I mean, how much tragedy can one person take?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Oh, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "Marcie: I'm so sorry that we're late. I had to change Tommy at the last minute.",
        "Natalie: Oh, no, no. Please, I just got here myself. What time is your train?",
        "Michael: Well, actually -- um -- mom isn't taking off just yet.",
        "Natalie: Oh. Oh, I thought we were saying goodbye. But --",
        "Eve: Well, we were, but then I started talking with Mike and Marcie this morning, and we agreed that something very important needed to happen before I left.",
        "Michael: Yeah, we -- uh -- we can't do it without you.",
        "Natalie: What can't you do without me?",
        "Marcie: Baptize Tommy. We were going to do it sooner or later. But since mom's leaving, we decided to move up the date.",
        "Eve: And in the wake of John's death, we thought it would be comforting, you know?",
        "Natalie: I think it's -- I think that's great. Especially to have Tommy christened with your mom still here. And of course I would. I'd love to be there.",
        "Michael: Well, you kind of have to be there, because it's tough to have a christening without a Godmom.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- what -- what?",
        "Marcie: We want -- we want you to be toy's Godmother.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",

        "Natalie: Are you -- are you guys sure about this?",
        "Marcie: Yes.",
        "Michael: You're basically family, so it makes sense.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, and we can't think of anybody who's more qualified for the job, so -",
        "Natalie: Hey, guys, I -- wow. I'm -- but I'm a mess.",
        "Marcie: No. I mean, look, you're just going through a really difficult time right now. You know, when al died, God, I -- I just thought that I'd never get through it, but I did. You will, too. I know you will.",
        "Eve: And we have complete faith in you, Natalie, just -- just like John did.",
        "Marcie: Which is why we want you to be Tommy's godmother. So please say yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Asa: Natalie is a Buchanan. She'll get through this. Just like you got through your troubles. You're all right now, aren't you?",
        "Jessica: I'm taking it day by day. I mean, I'm better than I was, now that I'm integrated. That's a weird way to describe yourself, isn't it, huh?",
        "Asa: Well, as -- as far as I can tell, all the women on this earth have a multiple personality.",
        "Jessica: Right. Because you men are completely together. You know, you're a joy to be around. A walk in the park.",
        "Asa: At least we don't keep yakking about how we feel. We have a problem, we do something about it.",
        "Jessica: Grandpa, you are still living in the dark ages.",
        "Asa: Me? No, no. I'm a computer geek. That's keeping up with the times, isn't it?",
        "Jessica: Well, you certainly are a geek. And now that I know that about you, you and I can start IM'ing.",
        "Asa: We can what'ing?",
        "Jessica: IM'ing. I'll teach you. It's where you can talk to your friends on the internet. It's really neat.",
        "Asa: That is all I need, sweetheart. Another way for people to get on my nerves.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Nigel: Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Nigel: It's time for Mr. Buchanan's medication.",
        "Asa: Already? I just took a whole batch of those pills.",
        "Nigel: It's been three hours, on the dot.",
        "Asa: Yeah. It's always on the dot, isn't it, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: Here you are, down the hatch.",
        "Asa: Excuse me, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Take your time.",
        "Nigel: It's so lovely to see you, miss Jessica.",
        "Jessica: It's so nice to see you, too, Nigel.",
        "Nigel: Your presence always lifts Mr. Buchanan's spirits.",
        "Jessica: He lifts mine. We have a special bond.",
        "Nigel: In that case, perhaps you can get him to reveal the secret he's been keeping.",

        "Viki: You're going to let me offer you a job? How generous. Unfortunately, David, I -- I don't really have any openings at the moment.",
        "David: Not even for a tall, witty, strikingly handsome, even in the morning, chap like myself?",
        "Viki: No, not even.",
        "David: Hmm.",
        "Viki: However, I must tell you, I'm absolutely delighted to know that you and Dorian are back together.",
        "David: Oh, we're not. I'm just staying here till I get back on my feet. Mmm. You want one of these? Here, take mine. In order to get back on my feet, I need gainful employment -- emphasis on the \"gainful.\" Now, you know, I have journalistic experience. I did wonders at \"craze.\" You can ask anybody.",
        "Viki: Well, I -- tell you what, I promise you, I will keep you in mind should anything come up, all right? Oh, David, for heaven's sake, will you kindly go put some clothing on?",
        "David: Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. I must look pretty silly standing here like this.",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "David: You know, you didn't tell me what you were doing here. Last time I checked, you and Dorian weren't exactly chummy.",
        "Viki: I didn't come to see Dorian, I came to see Kelly. I -- I have duke's medical records, and I thought she might want them for the baby.",
        "David: Oh, right. Um -- I think Kelly left pretty early this morning.",
        "Viki: Oh, well, ok. In that case, I'm just going to leave them over here, ok?",
        "David: All right.",
        "Starr: Aunt Viki? I thought I heard your voice.",
        "Viki: Hi, babe. Hey -- why aren't you in school? Are you sick?",
        "Starr: No, I'm fine. I'm not going to school today -- or any day, for that matter.",
        "Viki: Why not?",
        "Starr: I'm dropping out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Layla?",
        "Layla: I meant what I said. I never want to see Vincent Jones again.",
        "Vincent: I know we can work this out.",
        "Layla: What he did to Cristian was just unforgivable.",
        "Vincent: Layla? Layla, please? You want me to knock this door down? Huh? Just give me five minutes. I'm not leaving until you agree to talk to me.",
        "Rex: Ahem. Go away, Vincent.",
        "Vincent: What are you going to do? Charm me to death?",
        "Rex: Well, I happen to be a jujitsu black belt.",
        "Vincent: No kidding?",
        "Rex: Have you ever heard of Kimura? Named after the legendary Masahiko Ki -- Kimura? It looks like a simple shoulder lock, but -- well, would you like me to demonstrate? You do have insurance?",
        "Vincent: Step aside, Rex, and let me talk to my girl.",
        "Layla: I'm not your girl.",
        "Rex: You heard her. She doesn't want to talk to you.",
        "Vincent: Step aside, Rex.",
        "Rex: It's not going to happen.",
        "Vincent: You can't stop me.",
        "Cristian: Maybe he can't, but I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're dropping out of school? No. Really?",
        "Starr: I'm dead serious.",
        "David: Starr, if you drop out of school, you'll never learn that the power of a logarithm of xs equal to the exponent of that power times the logarithm of X.",
        "Viki: Go upstairs and get dressed.",
        "David: You're impressed I know that, aren't you? Viki, what you see on the outside is directly proportionate to what I got on the inside. Keep me in mind for that job.",
        "Viki: Top of my list, David. Top of my list. Hey -- so, what's going on?",
        "Starr: I hate my school, that's all. It's just a big waste of my time.",
        "Viki: Oh, ok. So what's the real reason? Why don't you want to go to school?",
        "Starr: It's because of these girls. They call themselves the Britney squad. Their sole mission in life is to make my life miserable.",
        "Viki: Ok. Well, we'll just have to do something about that, won't we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Ah, yes, of course I will be Tommy's Godmother. I am so honored that you guys would even ask.",
        "Marcie: See? I know. See? I told you she would say yes.",
        "Natalie: Well, look at this cutie, his little face here. Who could refuse him?",
        "Marcie: Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Michael: We really appreciate you doing this. It means the world to us.",
        "Natalie: You have no idea how much this means to me.",
        "Eve: Well, we just want to make sure that you always feel a part of the family.",
        "Michael: Father Garrin at St. Bridgid's said that he would perform the ceremony.",
        "Natalie: But that was -- that was John's funeral -- that was --",
        "Eve: Father Garrin performed John's funeral, that's right.",
        "Marcie: Wait, are you ok with that?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, sure. So when are we going to do this?",
        "Michael: Um -- right now -- if you're free.",
        "Natalie: Now?",
        "Michael: Yeah. Huh.",
        "Natalie: Uh -- yeah, ok. Yeah, let's do this, and -- I have a question, though. If I'm going to be the Godmother, who is going to be the Godfather?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, we're not really sure --",
        "Eve: Yeah.",
        "Marcie: Yet. You know, I was -- I was going to ask one of my brothers. But then if I ask one, the other two are just going to get upset about it, and -- I don't know if you know, but my dad -- I know, honey -- my dad's not really doing too well, so I want them to be close to him.",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marcie: You know? So I don't -- I --",
        "Eve: You know what? Guys, in such short notice, we may just have to forgo a Godfather.",
        "Michael: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marcie: Not necessarily.",
        "Michael: Who'd you have in mind?",
        "Marcie: Hmm-hmm. Probably the last person you would ever expect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: looks like you threw yourself quite a party last night.",
        "Nash: Yeah, a couple beers.",
        "Antonio: Well, it looks like more than a couple.",
        "Nash: Ah, so -- what?",
        "Antonio: So what? You're supposed to be spending your day with your daughter, and you smell like a brewery.",
        "Nash: I have got a big day planned for us. Yes, I do. Hey.",
        "Antonio: It's not going to happen, Nash. I'm not leaving Bree with you. Not under the condition you're in.",
        "Nash: There is no condition. I'm fine. Yeah.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, well, my job is to protect her from harm.",
        "Nash: I'm her father, for God's sakes. I would never harm her.",
        "Antonio: No, but you're hung-over, right? And you're in no shape to take care of an infant.",
        "Nash: Oh, I get it, great.",
        "Antonio: Oh, what do you get?",
        "Nash: Well, this has nothing to do with harming Brennan. This is because Jessica and I kissed last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, Nigel must have had some reason for sing what he did. Nigel, what secret is my grandfather keeping from us now?",
        "Asa: Say another word, and you're fired.",
        "Nigel: Sir, I --",
        "Asa: You are fired.",
        "Nigel: Then I shall seek employment elsewhere, because I will not stand idly by while you keep something inside that is clearly causing you tremendous stress. Secrets kill, sir. Not to mention that they always come out in the end. You're a lucky man, Mr. Buchanan. You have a family that loves you. So whatever it is you've been hiding, for heaven's sake, share it with them. I'm sure they'll understand. It's been an honor working for you. I'll pack my things. Ask him about the picture, Miss Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Ok, first of all, you are not firing Nigel. He's your right hand. And despite all the abuse you put on him, he still cares deeply about you and the rest of the family. Second of all, what's this about a picture?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: How did you track me down?",
        "Cristian: It doesn't matter. The point is I did. And if Layla doesn't want to see you anymore, then I'm going to make sure she doesn't have to.",
        "Vincent: Look, Vega, man, this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. I told you, I didn't know what teddy was up to.",
        "Cristian: You don't get it, do you, man?",
        "Vincent: I -- I get it, man!",
        "Cristian: No, you don't get it! Nobody is going to believe you anymore about anything.",
        "Vincent: You know, you and Layla have become the most important people in the world to me lately. You, as a friend. And Layla, as the woman that I love.",
        "Cristian: Don't fall for it, Layla.",
        "Layla: Oh, don't worry. I won't. Never again.",
        "Vincent: You know what? I'll leave.",
        "Layla: Good.",
        "Vincent: Ok? But that doesn't change the way that I feel about you, ok? And I'm not going to give up until I get you to take me back. Excuse me.",
        "Cristian: You can do this, right? Get proof that Vincent set me up?",
        "Rex: I got to go out for a little while, on business. Call you later?",
        "Adriana: Ok.",
        "Rex: Hang in there, Layla. You're a great girl. You deserve better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Oh, hey.",
        "Rex: Hey. Layla and Adriana are inside.",
        "Marcie: Well, actually, we're here to see you.",
        "Rex: Oh, well, I'm on my way out.",
        "Marcie: You know, this is really important. It'll take two minutes. We he made up our minds about something, and we really hope you'll say yes.",
        "Rex: To what?",
        "Michael: We want you to be Tommy's Godfather.",
        "Natalie: Here. You know, I can't wait till you start talking. Because when you do, we're going to have a good old heart-to-heart about your uncle John. How close he was to your daddy. You know, he's going to have two great role models. Michael and John.",
        "Eve: You're a very lucky little boy.",
        "Natalie: Hmm. I just thought -- and my brother, Rex. You know? I never would have thought of him as a choice for Michael and Marcie for -- well, anything.",
        "Eve: Why not?",
        "Natalie: Um -- well, Marcie and Rex -- they haven't always gotten along.",
        "Eve: Oh.",
        "Natalie: They -- they kind of push each other's buttons, you know? But you know, I guess they make each other laugh, too, so it's -- I guess it's not all bad.",
        "Eve: You know what? It sounds like a brother and sister to me.",
        "Natalie: You know, I -- I guess I never really thought of it that way. You're right. I mean, it's very similar to the relationship I have with Rex. Because he can be a real pain. But underneath it all, he has such a good heart. And he's funny, and he's sweet. And he's always there for me when I need him. I'm really lucky to have him in my life.",
        "Eve: Well, I'm sure he feels the same way about you, too, honey.",
        "Natalie: It's strange, huh? Being in the same place where we just said goodbye to John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What was Nigel talking about? What picture?",
        "Asa: It's nothing.",
        "Jessica: Grandpa, you can trust me.",
        "Asa: Take a look at this. I woke up new year's day at my lodge. I passed out in my chair. And found this on my lap. Somebody else was there and wanted to make sure I would find it. Bo thinks it's Spencer Truman.",
        "Jessica: Ok, but I don't understand -- do you know the woman in the picture?",
        "Asa: I do.",
        "Jessica: Well, who is she?",
        "David: My mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You and Jessica kissed?",
        "Nash: Yep.",
        "Antonio: Right. In your drunken hallucination.",
        "Nash: It wasn't a hallucination. And the fact that she didn't tell you anything about it, well --",
        "Antonio: What? Finish your damn sentence.",
        "Nash: Well, it's strange, that's all. I mean, first she punches Claudia when she finds out that Claudia and I slept together. And now we kiss. And the fact that she chose not to tell anything about either to her fianc\u00e9e --",
        "Antonio: You know, first of all, I don't believe there was a kiss. And if the was, what the hell is your point?",
        "Nash: I think my point is obvious.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Yuck!",
        "Starr: Yeah, I know, so I called her a bitch. I mean, I had to, because now I completely smelled like beer. So Cole lent me an outfit to go home in. And Britney must have gotten jealous, because now she really has it in for us.",
        "Viki: Honey, based on what you told me, I'd say you handled yourself extremely well.",
        "Starr: Even the bitch part?",
        "Viki: Especially the bitch part. You nailed it, right? That's what she is. Starr, Britney and her little friends sound to me like a bunch of very immature, jealous little girls. I mean, that -- that can't be the whole reason you don't want to go back to school.",
        "Starr: I don't want to fight anymore. All I ever do is fight. I fight to get my parents back together, I fight to keep my dad alive. All I ever do is fight. I am so sick of it. I just want to be a normal teenage girl, but I can't be normal, because I never was.",
        "Viki: Why not? Because you like snakes and spiders, instead of dolls?",
        "Starr: No. Because of my parents. In high school, you have to be just like everybody else. Or else girls like Britney will make your life a living hell. Maybe I should just join the Britney squad. Make my life easier.",
        "Viki: Yeah, sounds like a pretty good idea. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: This is some kind of joke, right?",
        "Marcie: Nope, not at all. Tommy's getting baptized today, and we need a Godfather. So, you're it.",
        "Rex: So out of all the available Godfathers in Llanview, you picked me?",

        "Rex: Yeah -- Marcie, last I checked, you couldn't stand me.",
        "Marcie: I wouldn't put it that way, exactly. I've had my issues with you. But you know, I think you have your good points.",
        "Rex: Yeah. So do you.",
        "Marcie: Anyway, since Natalie has decided to be Tommy's Godmother, and since you and Natalie are sort of like brother and sister -- I don't know -- it sort of makes sense, don't you think?",
        "Rex: But I have no morals, values, or any other redeeming qualities.",
        "Marcie: Yes, and that is true, but, you know, Adriana does. And I think she's starting to rub off on you. [Marcie chuckles] Look, the truth is, you know, you can be kind, and you can be loving. And when you and I were in that whole crazy killing club thing, well, you know, I think it kind of bonded us for life, don't you think?",
        "Rex: Yeah. Definitely.",
        "Marcie: So? What do you say? Please?",
        "Rex: Yes, there's nothing else in this world I'd love to be more than Tommy's Godfather. So look no further. I'm your man.",
        "Michael: Ok, good. Well, that's enough talk. Let's get to the church.",
        "Rex: It, now?",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm, yeah.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Right now.",
        "Rex: Take my car?",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Hey, Adriana, you want to come?",
        "Adriana: Thank you, Marcie, but I really need to hang out with Layla right now.",
        "Layla: No, you don't. Go to the christening, and I'll -- I'll be fine.",
        "Adriana: No, I'm not leaving you. No arguments. But for the record, you guys, I think you made an excellent choice.",
        "Marcie: I hope so.",
        "Adriana: Have fun.",

        "Antonio: You know what, Nash? You're the one that's setting the bad example, not me.",
        "Nash: All right, look, wait. Wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about what I said to Jessica. I'm the one who kissed her.",

        "Asa: Jessie, would you mind leaving us alone, so we can talk?",
        "Jessica: Ok, Grandpa. Don't you upset him.",
        "Asa: You give me a straight answer. Did you leave this at my lodge New Year's Eve?",
        "David: Spencer did that. I didn't find out about the photograph until later, when I found it in your desk drawer.",
        "Asa: You broke into my home?",

        "Rex: Hey, cool and serious are not mutually exclusive, you know? I'm not going to screw this up, Natty. Have a little faith in me.",
        "Natalie: I do have faith in you. And I think little Tommy is very lucky to have a guy like you as his Godfather.",

        "Antonio: Son of a -- I'm going to go over and arrest him.",
        "Cristian: Look, I don't even have proof that there was a crime. I hired Rex to see if he can find anything, but -- wait a minute, wait a minute. You just got your job back.",
        "Antonio: Yeah --",
        "Cristian: And Bo wants you to play by the rules. Don't worry about it. I can handle this.",

To be independent and strong. To be able to attract all the cute boys. That's why they want you to go away. Darling, you can't let them win. You have to be exactly who you are. You're tough and you're feisty. You're Starr Manning. You go back to school, and to hell with them.",
