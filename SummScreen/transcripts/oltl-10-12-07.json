        "John: If we're not getting a hit on her plates by now, Marcie must've dumped the car. I want you to recheck the airports and the train stations -- if you want.",
        "Bo: John, you're suspended, and I think you're too personally involved in this case to be giving any orders.",
        "John: We should've found the car by now.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I agree. Let's do what John suggested, all right? Check Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, see if Mrs. McBain's car was abandoned or possibly traded in. Mike, when was the last time you checked Marcie's cell phone?",
        "Michael: Just now -- straight to voicemail every time.",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: I keep thinking she was going to wake up this morning and realize she can't get away with this.",
        "Michael: \"Can't\"? She's getting away with it so far.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, she's a short, little, loudmouthed redhead with a baby. She's not going to be hard to find. Well, so what if she goes underground, that's where you live. Yeah, all right, well, make sure you call me when you do. And don't -- you know, if she's in a car, don't run her off the road or anything. Remember, she's got my kid. All right.",
        "Blair: How'd you sleep?",
        "Todd: Take a guess. He was just on the other side of the door, and I lost him. He just -- he'd just become mine, legally mine, and he's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Dorian, it's me -- again. Give me a call. Well, good morning, darling.",
        "Natalie: Good morning. Isn't it a beautiful day? I just love, love this time of year.",
        "Clint: You seem very chipper today.",
        "Natalie: I am very chipper. You know that guy, Jared Banks, that I hired?",
        "Clint: Yeah, of course.",
        "Natalie: Well, last night, I fired his ass, and it felt great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Ha. What are you doing here at this time in the morning? We haven't even had breakfast yet.",
        "Jared: You get me my job back at Buchanan enterprises or your wife will be eating her breakfast off the metal tray they slide under her prison cell door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Good morning. Oh, Todd -- any news on your little boy?",
        "Todd: No. I'm out of here.",
        "Blair: Where are you going?",
        "Todd: To find him!",
        "Dorian: Well, I see Todd is handling this with his usual wisdom and forbearance.",
        "Blair: Come on, Dorian. Don't do it this morning, all right? Todd was this close to getting his son back.",
        "Dorian: Fine. Have Langston and Starr come downstairs yet?",
        "Blair: No. But I called the school this morning and told them that they'd be out sick.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: I don't think a day off from school is going to fix what's wrong with that little girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Langston. How long have you been awake?",
        "Langston: I don't know -- a while?",
        "Starr: Hey, you don't have to hide the picture of your parents, and you don't have to hide that you feel like crap.",
        "Langston: That was almost easier -- going to school, forgetting about it. Oh, this is just so --",
        "Starr: Real. If anybody knows it, I do. I was so scared for my parents so many times, and I can't imagine what it would be like to lose them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: She was so terrified last night after court, you know, and angry, man, really angry. She wouldn't even talk to me. You know, I wanted to tell her that -- that we could try and fight this thing, you know, or -- or maybe we could -- could work with Todd -- I mean, do whatever it took to stay in Tommy's life. You know, maybe sometime in the future we could adopt again.",
        "John: She wasn't ready for that.",
        "Michael: No. And now that she's gone and done this, Johnny, those doors are closed to us and she knows it. She is scared, and I'm telling you, I'm scared, too. I'm scared that I'm never going to see Marcie or Tommy again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Ronnie, where were you? I was worried sick about you!",
        "Ron: I went to get some stuff for the baby.",
        "Marcie: Well, did anyone follow you or anything?",
        "Ron: I don't think so, but, Marce, they're going to be watching the whole family, you know that.",
        "Marcie: No, no. They were here last night, and you said that you hadn't heard from me, so it's going to be fine.",
        "Ron: You think they bought that? Really? I mean, they can come back and start knocking on that door any minute now.",
        "Marcie: Ronnie, I don't really know what to do next.",
        "Ron: I do -- you're going to make some breakfast and you're going to feed Tommy, ok? And then I'm going to go to where I stashed your car, and I'm going to pull it around, and you're going to get in it with Tommy, and you're going to go back to Michael.",
        "Marcie: What if I don't want to do that?",
        "Ron: Well, then I'll call Michael myself and tell him where you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Do Starr and Langston know that Todd's baby is missing?",
        "Blair: Not yet.",
        "Dorian: I really do wish I hadn't had to bring a grieving child home to this house, where -- where Marcie McBain has gone missing with Starr's half brother?",
        "Blair: What choice did you have, Dorian?",
        "Dorian: Well, I was kind of hoping that La Boulaie would be a safe haven for her.",
        "Blair: Well, it still can be.",
        "Dorian: She's been very emotionally shut down for a long time now, and she's going to start feeling everything.",
        "Blair: I'm just shocked that -- that she was able to fool Starr for so long. I mean, they've been really close for a year. And then Starr's mentioned to me many times that, you know, Langston's parents were away. I should've been able to pick up on that. Why didn't I?",
        "Dorian: Honey, you were knee-deep in your own problems.",
        "Blair: Have you thought about what I mentioned last night?",
        "Dorian: You mean about going to social services?",
        "Blair: Why are you whispering?",
        "Dorian: Because I don't want Langston to hear, and I certainly don't want to put her through something like that this soon.",
        "Blair: Ok, well, that's your choice. I mean, that got to the bottom of it.",
        "Dorian: Yes, but I'll tell you, when I was driving over there last night, I said to myself I don't have to go through with this, because I really hated the ea of forcing her to face so much pain.",
        "Blair: You know, I know that I give you a hard time, especially when you do it to me, but I think for Langston's sake, she's lucky to have someone that is a meddling busybody like you.",
        "Dorian: I'm going to take that as a compliment.",
        "Blair: Because if anything is going to change Langston's luck, it's meeting up with you.",
        "Dorian: Ooh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Like, 50 text messages from Markko.",
        "Starr: That's because he likes you.",
        "Langston: Know.",
        "Starr: You do?",
        "Langston: Yeah. Markko came over before your Aunt Dorian. He told me he loved me.",
        "Starr: He what? Oh, my gosh. Well -- what did you say?",
        "Langston: I -- I was like, \"wow, I don't have to feel like everybody has a boyfriend but me, I -- I'm not alone anymore.\" I knew that I wasn't alone, I just --",
        "Starr: No, I get it. Go ahead.",
        "Langston: But I'm worried now.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Langston: Well, Markko knows that my -- my parents are gone, but he doesn't know when it happened or that I've been totally lying to him about that.",
        "Starr: And you think he won't get why you did that?",
        "Langston: Well, what if he thinks I'm just crazy?",
        "Starr: Langston, he won't.",
        "Langston: How do you know?",
        "Starr: God, I can't believe I could've helped you, and all I did was think about myself!",
        "Langston: You couldn't have known, I -- I didn't let you.",
        "Starr: You know what? I am going to make Markko understand, ok?",
        "Langston: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just don't worry about it. Can we just talk about something else?",
        "Starr: Yeah, sure. Like what?",
        "Langston: Like the fact that you have a new little brother who's probably downstairs eating breakfast -- go see.",
        "Starr: No, I have every day for the rest of my life to have breakfast with Tommy. Although, I think my dad's going to change his name.",
        "Langston: Maybe you guys can vote on it.",
        "Starr: You have a vote, too. You have a family here, Langston. I mean it.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Every cop in the tri-state area has been faxed a copy of this picture. Let's see if we can get it put on the web, too, and all TV stations, especially the local stations near where her father and her brothers live. Mike? You sure you gave us all the names that you could think of that Marcie might reach out to?",
        "Michael: Yeah, yeah, everybody I -- yeah, everybody.",
        "Bo: Ok, I talked to her father and her brothers. They all say that they've heard absolutely nothing.",
        "John: What are they going to say?",
        "Bo: We've got their places staked out. Mike, do you think you can call the family, you know, maybe include that -- that personal touch? That might help.",
        "Michael: Yeah, yeah, I could do that. John? I mean, you still have friends at the bureau, you know? I mean, can't they -- can't they help us out with this thing?",
        "John: We want to keep this thing local for as long as we can.",
        "Michael: Why is that?",
        "John: Marcie doesn't have legal custody of Tommy anymore. If she's crossed state lines --",
        "Bo: Felony kidnapping -- it's a federal offense.",
        "Michael: And Todd won't rest until you throw the book at her. Where is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I can't believe you, Ronnie. You're my brother, and you're going to stand here and you're going to threaten to turn me in?",
        "Ron: Hey, you know I love you, but do you really think the cops aren't out there right now looking for you? Look, Marce, your best chance at any kind of life is to give yourself up and -- and tell them you were out of your mind when you ran off with Tommy.",
        "Marcie: My only hope for any kind of a life, Ron, is me with Tommy",
        "Ron: Ok, so even if you do manage to get away, do you really want to be on the run with a Toddler? What are you going to do for money? You can't use credit cards, you can't go to an ATM --",
        "Marcie: Look, I'll get a job, ok?",
        "Ron: Oh, that's pretty good, cool. Let me see -- you fill out a W-2 form and -- well, there they got you there, huh?",
        "Marcie: It's called \"working off of the books.\"",
        "Ron: Yeah, well, who takes care of Tommy?",
        "Marcie: Look, I'll figure it out, ok?",
        "Ron: \"How?\"",
        "Marcie: Look, I -- I am not losing my son! Ok? Bottom line, I'm not doing it!",
        "Ron: Marcie, listen to me. He's somebody else's son now, ok? No matter how unfair that seems, in the eyes of the law, you are committing a crime.",
        "Marcie: You're right, ok? You're right.",
        "Ron: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: So I will -- I'll go get Tommy, and I'll wake him up, and we'll get ready to leave, all right?",
        "Ron: Marcie, look, you won't regret this, you know that.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. I know I won't -- because I'm going to get in that car, Ronnie, and I am going to drive in the opposite direction of Llanview, and I am never going back there.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Ron: It's a Llanview area code. That means it only could be Michael or the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, I thought I heard voices. What are you doing here?",
        "Jared: I'm a partner here -- and nice t-shirt. I didn't see you there last night.",
        "Jessica: Honey, don't let your eggs get cold.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Mmm, yummy.",
        "Nash: Mmm. I hope you choke on that. Pass the salt.",
        "Jared: I'm here on a peace mission. All you have to do is tell me you'll lean on Natalie and I'm out of here.",
        "Jessica: Well, as much as I'd like to see your back as you walk out the door -- why am I talking to Natalie?",
        "Jared: Same reason you did before.",
        "Nash: Yeah, he blew it, she fired him, which I think is the best thing I've heard in what is already a pretty amazing day. Great eggs, honey.",
        "Jessica: Thanks, sweetheart.",
        "Jared: Yeah, you two can act as breezy as you want, but we all know I'm holding the cards here.",
        "Jessica: I don't know that. Do you?",
        "Nash: No, I don't know that.",
        "Jared: Out waiting for me to call the cops and tell them I did time because you set me up?",
        "Jessica: As long as I have my family behind me, I am good.",
        "Jared: Oh. Well, I'm sure you're going to miss poor scruffy here and the -- the kid while you're in the joint. Oh -- are you going to have the family lawyer bail you out of this mess?",
        "Nash: You know, I think what she's trying to say is that she's not going to roll over and play dead for you anymore.",
        "Jared: Oh, very impressive. See, except if I talk, she does time -- you know, maybe not two years like I did, but any time away could crack fragile Jessica. Ok, you know what? You really want to dredge up all that history in a courtroom? [Southern accent] \"I didn't do it, your honor. It was my evil twin.\"",
        "Nash: That's it.",
        "Jessica: Ok, don't, Nash. Nash, Nash, Nash, Nash, Nash --",
        "Nash: Yeah --",
        "Jessica: It's ok. It's ok, I'm -- don't, he doesn't scare me. Go ahead, take your best shot. Any misery you throw at me I can handle, but I will not turn you loose on my sister again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I thought that you and Jared had an important meeting to attend this morning.",
        "Natalie: Well, I'm ready for it. I can take it over myself.",
        "Clint: Uh-huh. Why, exactly, did you fire Jared? I mean, I thought he was doing pretty well.",
        "Natalie: Well, I just didn't feel that he was fitting in.",
        "Nigel: Ahem.",
        "Natalie: What is it, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: I told your father Mr. Banks came here asking for Mrs. Buchanan.",
        "Natalie: Renee? Why would he do that?",
        "Clint: Well, Nat, you know he was a big fan of Pa's. He just dropped by to offer his condolences.",
        "Natalie: What did you think, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: I did not have a good feeling about him.",
        "Natalie: See? Dad, this guy is an operator. We're much better without him.",
        "Clint: Well, I think it was just a bit hasty --",
        "Nora: Good morning.",
        "Nigel: Would you care for coffee?",
        "Nora: Oh, I'd love some, Nigel, thank you.",
        "Natalie: Ahem.",
        "Nora: Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?",
        "Natalie: No, no. It's just that I fired a guy last night and dad thinks I'm too big for my britches.",
        "Clint: I didn't say that.",
        "Natalie: Your look did.",
        "Clint: What look? Oh, yeah, that look. You know, I think a certain someone who's only been working at the firm for a couple of months -- I think that certain someone might want to ask the permission of a superior before they go and they fire a fellow employee, huh?",
        "Natalie: Sounds like you think the wrong person was fired.",
        "Clint: I did not say that. I'm just a little surprised, that's all, because you're the one who hired him.",
        "Natalie: Yes, yes, I was the one who hired him. Therefore, he's my responsibility, and I changed my mind about him -- Nigel here concurs. But you know what, dad? Don't worry about it. In the future, I will not hire or fire anyone without asking.",
        "Clint: Good. I'm still not sure why you did what you did.",
        "Natalie: You know, he wasn't sucking up to me like he was sucking up to you. This guy was impossible, and now he's impossible history. Excuse me, I have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: It was really nice of your mom to get us out of going to school today.",
        "Starr: Nobody expects you to go.",
        "Langston: I'm kind of dreading it.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Langston: Well, when people find out -- I mean, it's going to get around. Wait till Britney gets ahold of it.",
        "Starr: Ok, you're right. But I will have your back, just like you've had my back in the past, and so will Markko and Cole.",
        "Langston: Ok, thanks.",
        "Starr: Do you want to go downstairs and see the little rug rat?",
        "Langston: You go. I -- I just need some time.",
        "Starr: Are you ok?",
        "Langston: Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm just -- just used to having a lot of time alone, you know?",
        "Starr: Ok, I'm giving you a half an hour, and then I'm coming back up here.",
        "Langston: Ok. Go.",
        "[Starr chuckles]",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Knock]",
        "Dorian: Hi. I just passed Starr, and she said that you were in here. May I come in?",
        "Langston: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Dorian: She also said that you wanted to be alone, but, obviously, I decided to ignore that. How did you sleep?",
        "Langston: On and off.",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry. Do you have any relatives we ought to notify?",
        "Langston: My parents were both only children. My grandparents are dead.",
        "Dorian: So I presume that there was no funeral?",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Dorian: Would you like to have one?",
        "Langston: I -- I really just wouldn't want to have to deal with all that.",
        "Dorian: It might make you feel better.",
        "Langston: I -- I don't even want to go out in public anymore. I just --",
        "Dorian: Why not?",
        "Langston: I'm so embarrassed, I -- I can't even stand it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: God, I can't believe it.",
        "Blair: Yeah, me, either, but it's true.",
        "Starr: Wait -- so, if -- if Mrs. McBain took off with Tommy and didn't even tell Dr. McBain where they were going, I mean, she must've really flipped out.",
        "Blair: Yeah. I think it's difficult to hand over your child to someone, even if you know it's the right thing to do. I mean, I know that's very difficult -- I wouldn't want to do it.",
        "Starr: Well, how's Dad?",
        "Blair: How do you think?",
        "Starr: He's off the deep end?",
        "Blair: I think your daddy's living in the deep end right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Listen, Ron, I'm asking you this for Marcie's sake, so I need you to be honest with me, ok? Have you seen her?",
        "Ron: No, Mike, I haven't heard from her, ok? I'll let you know if I do.",
        "Michael: I hope you mean that. I'm worried sick about her, Ron.",
        "Ron: Yeah, well, believe me, so am I. Look, Michael, if she gets in touch, I'll give you a call, ok?",
        "Michael: Thanks.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Officer: That's probably my relief guy. I'll get it.",
        "John: Call the minute you get anything.",
        "Michael: Marcie's brother Ron says he hasn't seen her.",
        "John: You believe him?",
        "Todd: If that's the New Jersey brother, then I sure as hell don't. He's hiding her, you guys know it, so why don't you do something about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Look, I am really sorry that when I was troubled, I did a rotten thing that took away two years of your life. And if I have to pay for what I've done, I will handle that. But I have been through too much in the past few years to be afraid of the Atlantic City Police or of you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jessica: Now, my sister has thrown you out of the business, and now I'm telling you, you are through harassing our family.",
        "Nash: Hey. Join the party.",
        "Natalie: Oh. I was coming over here to warn you guys about my firing him, but I guess I'm too late. Did he call the cops yet?",
        "Nash: Nope, not yet. He decided to drop by here and give us a shakedown first.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but we didn't fall for it.",
        "Natalie: Good. Bring it on.",
        "Nash: Ooh, uh-oh. See, now you got me and her and -- well, I guess both of the Buchanan sisters lined up against you. If I was you, I'd be looking for a white flag.",

        "Dorian: What in the world do you have to be embarrassed about?",
        "Langston: Going around for over a year acting like -- I wasn't even acting. I actually started to believe it.",
        "Dorian: And it must have been incredibly lonely for you.",
        "Langston: I got used to it. But you know what's weird? It -- it actually started getting to me when stuff started going better for me.",
        "Dorian: What kind of stuff?",
        "Langston: A guy.",
        "Dorian: Markko. Hmm.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: And what made it more difficult?",
        "Langston: Well, he found out that my parents were never there, and he kept saying how bad that was and how I deserved better and --",
        "Dorian: He was worried about you.",
        "Langston: I know, and I was telling him this huge lie.",
        "Dorian: I'm sure he understands.",
        "Langston: Oh. I don't know.",
        "Dorian: He was here this morning.",
        "Langston: He was?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Langston: You didn't tell him the whole story --",
        "Dorian: Of course not. I did tell him that you weren't going to school and that you'd be in touch with him later.",
        "Langston: Thanks.",
        "Dorian: You're welcome.",
        "[Dorian chuckles]",
        "Dorian: Oh, there are some people -- who shall remain nameless -- who would call what I'm doing \"interfering.\"",
        "Langston: Not me.",

        "Starr: I just can't believe Mrs. McBain would do something like this. I mean, maybe I would expect dad to do something crazy like that, like run away with a kid, but Mrs. McBain?",
        "Blair: Well, like I said, she's desperate.",
        "[Starr sighs]",
        "Starr: Well, I mean, is there anything we could do for Dad or for Tommy?",
        "Blair: I think all we can really do is just support your dad. You know he's got to be tortured, losing his son again like that? And then, you know, he played by the rules this time. I think that's what really gets to him -- he played by the rules and it backfired. It's got to make him crazed.",
        "Starr: Do you think Tommy's going to be ok?",
        "Blair: I don't think Marcie would intentionally hurt the baby. But what she's doing is dangerous, Starr. Let's just hope that she keeps a clear enough head to make sure Tommy's safe.",

        "Marcie: You didn't tell Mike. You said you were going to.",
        "Ron: Marcie, you're still my baby sister and I love you, and I know what would happen if the cops found out you were here.",
        "Marcie: Yeah -- they'd hand your nephew over to Todd Manning.",
        "Ron: Marcie, that's going to happen eventually, no matter what you do.",
        "Marcie: No. No, it's not. Not if I am smart about it.",
        "Ron: Now, listen to me, Dad called this morning, by the way, ok, before you got up, and he is worried sick about you, and so is Jerry and Eric. Now, look, if you go back, maybe there's a chance you can still have Tommy in your life.",
        "Marcie: As what, Ron, his -- his lovable aunt Marcie? That would be great.",
        "Ron: Well, look, if you don't go back, you're going to end up in prison, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, well, you know what? They have to catch me first.",
        "Ron: You wrote a book. It's not like you're under the radar, you know?",
        "Marcie: Thank you. Thank you for worrying about me, thank you for everything that you have done. But I cannot turn my son over to Todd Manning.",
        "Bo: You're not helping, Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, but you are. My son is on the run with some lunatic woman, and the best you've done is set up a command post -- in her husband's motel room.",
        "Bo: I'm not going to discuss police procedure with you.",
        "Todd: You know, he's probably telling her everything you guys are doing.",
        "Michael: Oh, yeah, that's the truth.",
        "Bo: Michael's doing everything he can to help us. And I can assure you that we will get Marcie and your son back safely.",
        "Todd: No, come on -- Marcie would sooner drive that car into a tree with my son in the back seat than give him up to me.",
        "Michael: No, she would never do that, she would never hurt him.",
        "Todd: What do you call what she's doing to him now, Michael? All right, so you guys are just going to sit here and scratch your heads while her brother lies to you?",
        "Bo: I think you should go home and wait for word.",
        "Officer: Commissioner?",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Officer: Possible hit on a car matching Mrs. McBain's.",
        "Bo: Where?",
        "Officer: Used-car dealership outside Buffalo, traded in early today.",
        "Todd: Oh, buffalo -- I told you she was going to Canada.",
        "Bo: Get the VIN number.",
        "Officer: Sorry, false alarm -- VIN. number doesn't match.",

        "Langston: Yeah, but it's Mr. Manning's little kid's first day here.",
        "Dorian: Uh -- no, no. Uh -- evidently not.",
        "Langston: What? Starr just said that --",
        "Dorian: No -- when she went downstairs just now, she found out that Marcie McBain crawled out of a window with Tommy last and nobody has any idea where they are.",
        "Langston: What? But -- oh, my God, Mr. Mc -- well, he must be freaking out.",

        "Bo: He did what I asked him to do --",
        "John: And then he just leaves.",
        "Bo: You know, he did overhear a -- a lead that didn't pan T.",
        "Michael: What do you think it means?",
        "John: Don't worry about it, Mike. He's no closer to finding Marcie than we are.",

        "Ron: You know, you're really a good mother.",
        "Marcie: Thank you. Being his mom, Ronnie, it's -- it's changed my life, you know? It's changed me, it's changed the way I -- I look at everything.",
        "Ron: If you go to jail, they're going to give Tommy back to Todd Manning and you'll have nothing, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: That's exactly why I ha to make sure that no one ever finds me.",
        "Ron: You know what that means, don't you? This may be the last time we ever see each other. Excuse me. Do you have a second?",

        "Jessica: Oh, no, you didn't. I want my job back. I like that job, and I was good at it.",
        "Natalie: You were not satisfied with your job, and you were trying to force me out.",
        "Jessica: What, he was?",
        "Jared: She doesn't know what she's talking about.",
        "Natalie: He told me to go back to school and get my college degree so I could figure out how to run the company.",
        "Nash: Aha -- thereby leaving the door open for him at B.E.",
        "Natalie: You know, and why would I waste my time going back to school when I can just \"write it\" on my resume like you did?",
        "Jessica: You know, you make yourself sound like this straight arrow that was victimized by me, when, really, you're just a con man.",
        "Nash: Mm-hmm.",
        "Natalie: He so is. In fact, Nigel told me that he went to visit Renee a while back.",
        "Jessica: My grandfather isn't dead two months, and you're already trying to get in good with his widow?",
        "Jared: I enjoyed meeting a Buchanan woman who isn't out to get me.",
        "Jessica: Well, that's because she's too vulnerable to see through your garbage.",
        "Nash: All right, look, ahem, you've made your threats and we've told you to stuff them. Natalie's not going to give you your job back, and I'm here to make sure that Jessica can handle anything you at h so you've already ruined my breakfast, you're sucking up all the air in here, so why don't you get the hell out?",
        "Jared: If you don't want to see me anymore, you're going to be the one who has to go. See, I own this place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Nigel, I got the feeling that you agreed with Natalie's feelings about Jared Banks.",
        "Nigel: I believe if your late father was still with us and he met Mr. Banks, he would instruct me to \"run the varmint off.\"",
        "Clint: I mean, Natalie would agree with that, but maybe it's because he keeps calling her \"Sparky.\"",
        "Nora: Oh, God, I'd fire him for that myself.",
        "Clint: And Natalie got pretty upset. I haven't seen her like that in a long while.",
        "Nigel: It seems to indicate a rather complicated relationship.",
        "Nora: Hmm. Do you suppose there's any sexual tension there, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: Mr. Banks exudes an air of confidence where women are concerned. Have I answered your question, sir?",
        "Clint: Thank you so much.",
        "Nora: I do like watching him blush. You aren't really angry that Natalie fired Jared, are you?",
        "Clint: I just don't like it when people let their personal feelings interfere with their judgment.",
        "Nora: Oh -- which is probably why you took in a nice, steady, solid person like Dorian, huh?",
        "Clint: You noticed I was upset with her, huh?",
        "Nora: Well, I just assumed. Did she ever call and tell you what happened?",
        "Clint: No. I suppose if I'm going to continue to see her, I should get used to the things she does.",
        "Nora: What? I'm sorry. I don't understand why you have to get used to what she does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Starr. Your aunt just told me what Mrs. McBain did.",

        "Langston: You don't have to go through all that trouble.",
        "Blair: It's no trouble.",
        "Starr: Yeah, you know what? Let's have pancakes, ok? And while we wait, we can watch TV.",
        "Langston: Ok. Thanks. Um -- do you want any help?",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no, no, I've got the master chef here. She's going to help me out, right?",
        "Dorian: Right.",
        "Blair: We'll call you when they're ready.",
        "Starr: Ok. Let's go.",

        "Dorian: Oh, no.",
        "Blair: It's going to be awful, Dorian, and I'm not sure I have another Todd crisis in me, you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Now, look, thanks for letting me be part of this.",
        "Bo: I shouldn't, you know, after you found out that Manning was Tommy's real father but you kept it to yourself.",
        "John: It was damage control. What can I do -- he's my brother.",
        "Bo: And that's why you're here, see -- as a brother.",
        "John: I won't push it.",
        "Bo: Good. But even as an ordinary citizen, if you happen to notice that I'm missing something, I'd appreciate you telling me.",
        "John: Thanks, Bo.",
        "Bo: You really don't think that Manning's on to anything?",
        "John: No, I just said that in front of mike. Manning heard or saw something, he's going to follow up on it himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ron: Marcie, think about what you're doing here, ok? I mean, you won't ever be able to talk to dad or to me or to Eric, Jerry. They'll be watching all of us, all of your friends in Llanview. And then wherever you go, you have to worry that people don't figure out who you are. Do you want to live like that?",
        "Marcie: No. But I'd rather live like that, Ronnie, than be this -- this shell of a woman who used to have this -- this beautiful little boy in her life, Ron. Oh, come on, please, Ronnie. Please.",
        "Ron: Ok.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Ron: I'll back you. Come here.",
        "Marcie: I knew it. I knew you'd do it. That's why I came here.",
        "Ron: You know I love you, Marcie, but listen to me. I need you to call Mike and --",
        "Marcie: No! No!",
        "Ron: Tell hi-- he's worried sick about you and Tommy.",
        "Marcie: No, I am not calling Michael! Come on, Ron. Look, he found out months ago who Tommy's birth father was, and he didn't tell me -- his wife! All right, so you tell me, how am I supposed to trust a man like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Please. Please come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Nora, you have made it very clear any number of times that you don't like Dorian.",
        "Nora: No, it -- this has nothing to do with whether I like Dorian or not, this has to do with the way she treats you.",
        "Clint: You mean, like not showing up for dinner last night, and then not calling to explain?",
        "Nora: Yes, or the time she ran off to be with David --yeah, things like that.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, that bothers me, too.",
        "Nora: Well, I'm -- I'm sure she'll have a -- a logical explanation for everything when you track her down.",
        "Clint: I'm not going to, I'm done tracking her down.",
        "Nora: Good for you!",
        "Clint: I mean, I'm not part of her entourage.",
        "Nora: That's right.",
        "Clint: I expect a little common courtesy.",
        "Nora: That's right, good for you! Oh, I'm so glad I got you angry by saying all that.",
        "Clint: Well, now that you're living here, you're going to pick up on certain things and probably get me angry. And I hope that you don't regret the decision to stay here, because last night Matthew sort of forced the issue.",
        "Nora: Well, I hope you don't regret my decision. And Matthew didn't force the issue. I -- I know that he would be happy living with family.",
        "Clint: What about you?",
        "Nora: Me?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, you know, I'm kind of getting used to having someone else keep a roof over my head, and I -- I'm actually kind of getting used to servants and foot and -- you know, I'm not used to it, though, and I do like to go down in the morning and burn me up some eggs and not have anyone see.",
        "Clint: Oh. I tell you what -- let's go into the kitchen, kick Nigel out, set fire to some food, and we can call it breakfast.",
        "Nora: You're on.",
        "Clint: Nigel! Nigel!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I'm trying to be strong for the kids, and I'll do anything you need me to do for Langston. But I swear, when I heard what Marcie did, I thought I was going to crack.",
        "Dorian: You'll get through this. You always do. This is for the second batch.",
        "Starr: Are the pancakes done yet?",
        "Dorian: Uh -- not yet.",
        "Starr: Uh -- ok. Well, I have a brilliant idea.",
        "Blair: And what is that, sweetie?",
        "Starr: Langston should live with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You know, there's a guy I used to work with at the Bureau. He might be willing to look into this unofficially.",
        "Michael: I don't know. I mean, I don't want to get Marcie into any more trouble than she's already in.",
        "John: Best way to avoid that would be to find her and Tommy.",
        "Michael: Yeah. Yeah. Call him.",
        "John: You going to be all right?",
        "Michael: What choice do I have, John? You know, the reason I didn't tell Marcie about Todd is because I thought that if she knew, she'd meltdown, you know, that she wouldn't be able to handle it. And look, because I didn't tell her -- now I don't have a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ron: Look -- Marcie, look, I know what you've been through, and I -- and I've seen you with Michael, and right now I know you're furious with him and it sounds like you have every right to be. But I know you love him. Now, are you really ready to just throw your marriage away? Because if you walk out that door, that be doing.",
        "Marcie: I can't go back to him, Ronnie. I can't. And I will not hand my son over to Todd Manning.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jessica: So you' throwing us out?",
        "Jared: No -- I'm moving in.",
        "Rex: I might know a way to bring Marcie home.",
        "Todd: Ron, it's me! Long time no see, buddy. I'm here to pick up my son."
