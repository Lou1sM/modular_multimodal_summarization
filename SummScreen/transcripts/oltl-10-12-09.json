        "Matthew is determined to get the surgery done with or without Greg and has made plans to fly to Seattle and have Dr. Nance do it. Destiny, Rachel, Bo and Nora are all concerned when they hear that the other surgeon is 2nd rate to Greg. And they urge him to reconsider since they have no choice except to let Matthew go through with it. Blair has awoken after falling through the window and appears ok except for not remembering the big secret she discovered of Tea having a child with Todd. Since nobody else knows it, Tea is hoping that it never comes out. Dorian tells everybody she knows that Blair's memory can be restored by the surgery that Dr. Evans performs. Ross sneaks into Todd's home and attempts to steal Tea's brief case and reveals that he believe she has his kid. Fish catches him and arrests him. Fish also knows that there are some dirty dealings going on at Dorian's campaign. Nick and Amelia are concerned that Fish may not support gay marriages and urge Kyle to persuade him to support their cause."

        "Matthew: Dr. Nance reviewed Greg's file and agrees that I'm a great candidate for the surgery. He flies back to Seattle today, earlier than he expected.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Matthew: That means he has an opening in his schedule. All I have to do is fly to Seattle, and if I do, I can have the surgery tomorrow.",
        "Bo: Tomorrow?",
        "Nora: What about your lab workup and--and--and tests?",
        "Matthew: I've already had all that. The hospital's sending my records.",
        "Bo: To Seattle.",
        "Matthew: That's where his practice is.",
        "Nora: Why can't he do the surgery here?",
        "Matthew: He said he doesn't have privileges here. He's only here because he has a conference in Philadelphia.",
        "Greg: Dr. Nance?",
        "Bo: Yeah. I understand you recommended him.",
        "Nora: You couldn't find someone closer?",
        "Greg: He's a good man. And an excellent neurosurgeon.",
        "Destiny: As good as you?",

        "David: I knew that something was up when Dorian let me get away. I thought she was jealous of my female fans, but after I completed my television ad campaign for the good folks at Have-a-Seat hemorrhoid pads, I received a lot of adulation and praise, and my female fans threw themselves at me. Naturally. But then I realized it was something more, and it put a strain on my relationship with Dorian. And I saw that Dorian found her true self with Amelia. I couldn't stand in the way of that. I did what any man would do. I stepped aside and I let love live.",
        "Reporter: I think I've got everything I need.",
        "David: Are you sure? I've got more. Would you like more?",
        "Nick: Thanks for that.",
        "David: Pretending that Dorian is marrying her campaign manager?",
        "Amelia: You've got to admit, this did up the ante.",
        "David: I don't think Charlie and Viki are gonna be able to beat that, unless maybe one of them has a sex change.",
        "Amelia: This is about more than beating Mrs. Banks.",
        "David: You obviously don't know Dorian.",
        "Nick: This is about giving everybody the right to be married under the law.",
        "David: I don't know if that's really all it's chalked up to be. A few marriages of mine I wish were illegal.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, but you did it for love, right?",
        "David: Well...",
        "Amelia: Excuse me. You are gay, aren't you?",
        "Oliver: Yes. I am.",
        "Amelia: And don't you want the same rights and privileges that everybody else has?",
        "Oliver: What I want doesn't really have anything to do with this.",
        "Amelia: Of course it does. We're doing this for you, Oliver. We're doing this for everyone.",
        "Oliver: By lying about your feelings? I don't know. I thought we were past all that.",

        "Jack: Take me to the hospital.",
        "Noelle: We're not going anywhere.",
        "Jack: But Mom--",
        "Noelle: No. Your Aunt Dorian left strict instructions for us to stay here. If there is any news, she'll call.",

        "Noelle: Oh, Dorian. How's poor Blair?",
        "Dorian: Extremely lucky.",
        "Noelle: So she's gonna be all right?",
        "Dorian: Landing on that pool cover saved her life. Nothing more than bumps and bruises.",
        "Noelle: Thank God.",
        "Jack: When's she coming home?",
        "Dorian: They want to keep her here for observation just to be sure.",

        "Ross: Elijah, it's Ross. No, no, no. I'm still in Llanview. No. Not until I find out where T\u00e9a stashed my kid. I don't care what's advisable. Listen to me. [Sigh] If she won't tell me the truth... I have a pretty good idea where I'm gonna find it.",

        "T\u00e9a: Oh, thank God. It's a miracle.",
        "Starr: Yeah, there's no broken bones and her back is okay and she's awake and talking.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really?",
        "Starr: Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's in there with my dad right now.",
        "Blair: You had Todd Manning's child, and you kept it from him? Wow, T\u00e9a. That's the mistake of your life 'cause he has to know.",
        "Dorian: T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: Huh?",

        "Todd: T\u00e9a and I are over, Blair.",
        "Blair: I figured.",

        "Blair: No, she--she's lying.",
        "Todd: But you fixed that, didn't you? She said she could re-file the divorce papers but I told her not to bother.",
        "Blair: She told me something, something today in my room.",
        "Todd: Of course, none of that would've mattered if she'd just told me the truth.",
        "Blair: She poured water on me.",
        "Todd: Shh. I think you're still a little goofy. I'm sorry I brought you into this. I'm sorry I didn't know she was gonna do anything like this.",
        "Blair: We fought, Todd.",
        "Todd: You need to take it easy.",
        "Blair: Todd--",

        "Dorian: Who let you out of jail?",
        "T\u00e9a: Out of my way, Dorian, okay?",
        "Dorian: Was it Nora? Because when I'm elected mayor, she's finished.",
        "T\u00e9a: I need--I need to see Blair right now.",
        "Dorian: So you can finish the job?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't recall you being so tough on crime when Blair pushed me out a window.",
        "Dorian: That was an accident. This was attempted murder.",
        "Starr: What's going on over here?",
        "Dorian: And don't you think that I don't know your motive.",
        "Starr: Motive?",
        "T\u00e9a: Everything--everything is fine.",
        "Dorian: No, no, nothing is fine, because T\u00e9a here has been keeping some big secrets.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, I will tell you everything later, okay? Right now, I need to get in there, okay?",
        "Dorian: Oh, so you can find out whether or not Blair's gonna press charges against you?",
        "Starr: Press charges?",
        "T\u00e9a: Honey, your mother and I were arguing. She fell out the window. I did not push her.",
        "Dorian: Oh, of course not. Blair jumped.",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair knows that I did not mean to hurt her. And if you let me in there, then I can apologize to her myself.",
        "Dorian: Oh, great. I'll buy a ticket to watch that. Yes, all those years swaying juries. I bet you've got remorse down pat.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's the truth.",
        "Dorian: You listen to me. I intend to protect my family.",
        "T\u00e9a: From me?",
        "Dorian: You bet. Because after what you did to Blair, as far as I'm concerned, you are not human. You are garbage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: She just hung up.",
        "Noelle: She said everything's gonna be all right, right? So, do you feel better about your mom now?",
        "Jack: I will when she comes home.",
        "Noelle: I understand. You want to see her with your own two eyes.",
        "Jack: No kidding. I'm not letting her out of my sight. Someone has to keep her out of the hospital.",
        "Noelle: Oh, now, your Aunt Dorian is gonna take very good care of her.",
        "Jack: She's too busy with her stupid campaign.",
        "Noelle: Now, do you really think that would keep her from helping somebody she loves?",
        "Jack: Look. She's on again.",
        "Noelle: Oh, maybe she's re-running a press conference.",
        "Dorian: ...My new campaign manager. She is my partner. She is my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Jack: Aunt Dorian's a lesbian? When did that happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Amelia: No one asked you to lie.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, well, you're sure not telling the truth.",
        "Amelia: Because I'm not in love with Dorian?",
        "David: I'm pretty sure she's not in love with you, either.",
        "Amelia: Who are we to define what makes a marriage? Isn't that exactly what we're fighting against?",
        "Oliver: No. This is different.",
        "Amelia: How? They tell us that our feelings aren't legitimate, that we don't have the right to marry, to have families.",
        "Nick: To receive the same tax credits, insurance benefits.",
        "Oliver: Yes, yes, I believe in all of that. But why use a straight woman to get them?",
        "David: And believe me, she is straight. Funny story--I tried to get her into a m\u00e9nage a trois once. Dismal failure.",
        "Amelia: If we get what we want, what difference does it make?",
        "Oliver: Because you're asking people to trust you.",
        "Amelia: No, I'm asking people to trust our stance on the issue. We've never lied about that.",
        "Oliver: You really think that'll make a difference when people find out the truth?",
        "Nick: How are they gonna find out, Oliver? Are you gonna tell them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Look, Dr. Nance is one of the best in his field.",
        "Bo: But we've already talked to the best in the field.",
        "Greg: He's not on everyone's radar yet, but I've had the privilege of working with him.",
        "Nora: You have?",
        "Greg: Mm-hmm. He was my first assist on several of my surgeries, and he's very familiar with my techniques.",
        "Destiny: Assisted? So you were, like, his teacher.",
        "Greg: He was a very good student, yes.",
        "Destiny: But everything he knows, you taught him.",
        "Greg: Destiny, we've been over this.",
        "Destiny: I know. You don't want to operate on anybody else because of what happened to Shaun.",
        "Greg: You do want Matthew to have this surgery, don't you?",
        "Destiny: Not from some guy who came in second place.",
        "Greg: I wouldn't recommend Dr. Nance if I didn't think that he could do this surgery.",
        "Nora: What's his rate of success?",
        "Greg: I don't know the exact figures...",
        "Nora: All right. Is he as good as you?",
        "Greg: This procedure is extremely difficult. It's 50% no matter who's doing it.",
        "Bo: You're not answering the question.",
        "Greg: It's not as simple as that. We've had different patients, different circumstances. You're asking me to compare apples and oranges.",
        "Nora: No, we're asking you for a straight answer. Who's got the better track record, Dr. Evans-- you or Dr. Nance?",
        "Greg: I do.",
        "Nora: Okay. Well, then, Destiny's right. He's a second-rate doctor.",
        "Destiny: I told you.",
        "Greg: Dr. Nance isn't some beginner. He's a trained surgeon with good hands. No, great hands. He's--",
        "Bo: He's the best in his field. We heard you.",
        "Greg: I know this is difficult. I understand.",
        "Nora: You have no idea.",
        "Greg: But I will not be guilted into doing something that I don't feel confident doing.",
        "Nora: What about how Matthew feels?",
        "Greg: My decision to remove myself from Matthew's surgery was in his best interests.",
        "Nora: Is it Matthew's best interests to recommend a second-rate doctor to do the surgery? That's in Matthew's best interests?",
        "Greg: As I said, I wouldn't have recommended Dr. Nance if I didn't think that he could perform this surgery. Now, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Nora: What? No, wait. Dr. Evans, please. Please wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noelle: Who are you? And what are you doing with that briefcase?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I need to see Todd.",
        "Dorian: Then you can wait until he comes out of my niece's room.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I cannot wait, Dorian.",
        "Starr: Maybe you should leave, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Dorian: I intend to keep you away from my family.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's my husband in there, and I'm not going anywhere until I speak with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I found out about the secret husband. I figured there's a lot more. I even asked her if she'd been hopping on the red-eye to Tahiti when I wasn't looking.",
        "Blair: It's not that.",
        "Todd: She played me for a fool the whole time.",
        "Blair: No. Just listen...",
        "Todd: Listen, you need a rest, okay?",
        "Blair: No, Todd--",
        "Todd: Come on. You just--you just suffered a big blow on the head. You need to...",
        "Blair: I need to tell you now.",
        "Todd: Okay. Okay. I'm listening.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Todd is not your husband.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Dorian: You see, your wicked stepmother here already has another husband. Yes, a man named Ross Rayburn.",
        "Starr: The guy who kidnapped Jack and me? Are you serious?",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, that's only because Blair--",
        "Dorian: Did what she had to do to protect her family.",
        "T\u00e9a: From me?",
        "Dorian: You bet. You see, you don't have children of your own, and that's why you had to steal somebody else's.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't know what the hell you're talking about.",
        "Dorian: Oh?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm done listening to you. Don't say another word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: Please, don't think I'm not flattered.",
        "Nora: This isn't about you. This is about our son.",
        "Greg: I understand that.",
        "Nora: No, I don't think you have any idea. See, you're--you're so--busy, you know, analyzing the data and interpreting the risks and stuff that you don't-- you don't understand at the end of the day, it's my son's life. I could lose my son. You understand that. I think you understand I could lose my son. And if, God forbid, that should happen...",
        "Bo: Nora.",
        "Nora: If that should happen, we have to make sure that we've done everything in our power to make sure that he's safe, and if that means flattering you, or admitting that we were wrong and you were right, or begging you, then that's what I'm gonna do. Do you want me to get down on my knees, because I'm getting down on my knees.",
        "Matthew: Mom, stop.",
        "Greg: No, sorry, no.",
        "Nora: Please. Please, Doctor.",
        "Greg: I can't.",
        "Nora: Perform the surgery on my son. Please.",
        "Greg: I can't.",
        "Nora: Please.",

        "Oliver: You're asking me if I'm gonna \"out\" you? What--tell all of Llanview that Dorian's--",
        "David: The straightest woman I've ever known?",
        "Oliver: Don't worry. That's not something I'd do.",
        "Nick: What is?",
        "Oliver: Excuse me?",
        "Nick: You overheard Amelia and I talking at the Buenos Dias cafe this morning.",
        "Kyle: Nick, just let it go.",
        "Nick: No. You were suspicious of me earlier, so obviously he told you something.",
        "Kyle: Oliver didn't mean any harm.",
        "Nick: Okay, then maybe next time he can come to me with his concerns.",
        "Oliver: Look, Nick, I'm a cop, okay? I thought it might be something illegal.",
        "Nick: At the rally?",
        "Oliver: You said Dr. Lord was your target, and Amelia mentioned pulling the trigger.",
        "Nick: We were speaking metaphorically.",
        "Kyle: Oliver didn't know that, okay? He thought that you--you were planning an a... an assassination.",
        "Amelia: [Laughs] An assassination?",
        "Nick: So you pretend to be my friend.",
        "Oliver: I wasn't pretending.",
        "Kyle: He did it for me, okay? He knows I have to stay out of trouble.",
        "Nick: Okay, so Oliver is protecting you from me. I mean, just like he tried to protect me from you.",
        "Kyle: This is different. He overheard something and thought I should know.",
        "Amelia: And you think people should know that my engagement to Dorian isn't real?",
        "Nick: Look, Oliver. We're not committing any crimes.",
        "Amelia: People get married for all kinds of reasons. Don't you think fighting for our rights is as good as any?",
        "Nick: I know I want to marry the man I love, and someday, when you meet the right guy--",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Oliver: Excuse me. Fish. Yeah. I'll be right there. I gotta go. Police business.",

        "Ross: This briefcase. It's my briefcase.",
        "Noelle: Oh, really? Is that why it has the initials \"T.D.\" On it?",
        "Ross: Yeah, that's me. I'm Tom. Delancey.",
        "Noelle: And you keep your briefcase at Mr. Manning's house?",
        "Ross: [Sighs] Okay, look. It's T\u00e9a Delgado's briefcase, but what's inside is mine.",
        "Noelle: Nice try.",
        "Ross: No, no, I'm serious. We're married. Or in the middle of a divorce.",
        "Noelle: How stupid do you think I am? T\u00e9a's married to Todd Manning.",
        "Ross: Yeah, you might want to check your scorecard on that one, sweetheart.",
        "Noelle: And you might want to hand that over.",
        "Ross: I need something in here. I'm not leaving without it.",
        "Noelle: Over my dead body. Or maybe yours.",
        "Ross: Whatever. Really? [Indistinct] Ha ha. Feisty. I like that. Now move. Don't let this get ugly. Step aside and no one's gonna get hurt, okay?",

        "Todd: Why do you look so nervous, T\u00e9a?",
        "Dorian: Could it possibly be the anticipation of a long prison sentence?",
        "Blair: Starr.",
        "Starr: Hey. What happened?",
        "Todd: She was just about to tell me. Blair? You were gonna tell me. You said something happened with T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: She was just about to say that it was an accident.",
        "Dorian: Oh, please.",

        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: I had to get to you. I had to--I had to tell you something.",

        "Nora: [Sniffles] Oh, God. Why did this happen?",
        "Bo: Matthew took us to court and we lost.",
        "Nora: I don't accept that. I'm a lawyer. I'm an officer of the court.",
        "Bo: Even you can't win 'em all.",
        "Nora: They expect us to follow the ruling of some person who's not even involved.",
        "Bo: I think that's why they left it up to her.",
