        "Blair wants to get her memory back because she knows that Tea told her something crucial to Todd. Todd seems to know the same and demands that Tea fesses up. She does not confess to him that she had his child. But she asks him if he was ready to throw her away and not work things out. He admits to her that right before Blair fell through the window, he was looking for Tea and ready to get back with Tea. She tells him that could never happen since he only loves Blair. Natalie asks Marty to see if she can get through to John. Marty can see that John may still have feelings for Natalie as well as for Blair. But he declares that Marty is the woman he loves. Ross is ready to get arrested but needs to make certain Blair is ok. Fish is ready to use his law enforcement authority not to be intimidated by Ross or by his lawyer, Elijah. Gigi makes it clear to everybody that she is not ok with Kim seeing Schuyler because she has feelings for Schuyler."

        "Dorian: Take these.",
        "Blair: Well, is it gonna help me get my memory back? Why I fell out the window?",
        "Dorian: No. They're painkillers.",
        "Blair: Well, I don't want them, Dorian, all right? I want to keep my head clear. Because whatever's happened between T\u00e9a and me is still rattling around in there and I want it out now. Because it was something big.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Okay, talk.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I don't know exactly how to tell--",
        "Todd: Oh, give me a break. My God, yesterday you couldn't shut up about how much you wanted to explain why you were still married to Ross Rayburn. Now you push Blair out the window and you can't form a sentence! What's the matter, T\u00e9a? Today's secret worse than yesterday's?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You forgot to pay for my on-demand channels.",
        "Rex: I didn't forget. I canceled them.",
        "Stacy: Rex--",
        "Rex: Try reading a book or listening to some music: Do something good for the baby.",
        "Stacy: Well, our baby likes romantic comedies. Speaking of which, I hear you and Gigi saw the \"Glass Slipper.\"",
        "Rex: I'll bet you did.",
        "Stacy: Well, Schuyler and Kim loved it. Did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Hey.",
        "Schuyler: Hey.",
        "Gigi: So how'd you like the movie last night? Sorry I shouted out the ending.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, it's okay. Your version was better. Uh, actually, I kind of figured you and Rex felt the same way, since you left halfway through.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, it wasn't really our thing. Huh. It's weird how we all wound up at the same movie.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Was it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I'm very proud of you. I mean, agoraphobia is a debilitating disease, and being here is a huge step. And maybe now you'll realize that being out there in the world isn't as scary--",
        "Natalie: I need to talk to you now!",
        "Marty: Natalie! I'm with a patient.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I'm--I'm sorry. No, I--I really am. It's an emergency, and his name is John McBain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "John: I, uh, I heard you took a little tumble. How you doing?",
        "Blair: You know me--I bounce.",
        "John: Well, I'm glad to see your sense of humor didn't take a hit.",
        "Dorian: Just her memory. That psycho T\u00e9a Delgado has damaged my niece's brain. Now, John, what is the Llanview police department going to do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Ross, what the hell?",
        "Ross: Thank God you're here. Get me out of these cuffs.",
        "Elijah: No can do, buddy. Do you know what they charged you with?",
        "Ross: I don't care. Get on it and take these damn things off me.",
        "Elijah: Why? You got somewhere to be?",
        "Ross: It's T\u00e9a's. This might be my only change to get it back.",
        "Elijah: Let me get this straight. You want me to help you get out of these cuffs so you can steal evidence from the squad room, making me an accomplice to, what, 6 felonies?",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Elijah: Good luck, Ross.",
        "Ross: Wait, wait, wait, Elij. Listen to me. That briefcase may be my only hope in finding my kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: That bad, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: I guess it depends on how you look at it.",
        "Todd: And what the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "T\u00e9a: Do you really want to know?",
        "Todd: I'm asking you, aren't I?",
        "T\u00e9a: Do you promise, and I mean swear, that you will listen to me and hear me out?",
        "Todd: Why don't you just tell me? All right, whatever. I promise.",
        "T\u00e9a: All right, you want to hear everything? I'll tell you everything.",
        "Todd: Okay, let's hear it. Anytime now.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay, give me a second, all right? This isn't the easiest thing to say.",
        "Todd: I'm sure it's easier than falling from a second-story window onto a pool cover.",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair's gonna be fine, okay? She's awake. She's talking. In a day or two she'll be walking out of here, living to screw me over for another day.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's amazing how you're turning it around to make yourself the victim.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, give me a break! Falling out the window was the best thing that could've ever happened to Blair. I mean, everyone's gonna be like, \"oh, poor Blair!\" From now on. Everyone seems to have forgotten that Blair was there when I accidentally fell out a window. Remember that? No. Everyone has conveniently forgotten that. And the upshot of all this is that Blair is never gonna face what she did. Which is the reason I went over to see her in the first place. I was angry, Todd, and I wanted to confront her. You told Todd that I'm married to Ross Rayburn. I wanted her to know what her actions had cost us, had cost me. He threw me out. Our marriage is over. Are you happy now? Oh, but we just--we argued. We fought. Things went from bad to worse, until...",
        "T\u00e9a: How do I know what it's like to love a child? I have one.",
        "Todd: Until what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: All right. Okay, who was the arresting officer? You got yourself arrested by that kid? He's still wet behind the ears.",
        "Ross: No, I was beaten over the head by one of Manning's demon spawn and then hogtied by some crazy woman.",
        "Elijah: Okay, so were apprehended by a woman, a child, and that Cub Scout? Ross, you're really slipping.",
        "Ross: That's not helpful.",
        "Elijah: Okay, hey, watch and learn. Excuse me?",
        "Oliver: Yeah? Can I help you?",
        "Elijah: Yeah. Are you my client's arresting officer?",
        "Oliver: Yes, sir.",
        "Elijah: Great. I'd like your name and badge number, please.",
        "Oliver: Why is that?",
        "Elijah: Well, I can't sue the pants off you without a name.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: T\u00e9a Delgado is a menace.",
        "John: You won't get an argument from me.",
        "Dorian: Do you know that she forced her way into the hospital? And when Todd leaves here, she's liable to come back here and try and finish the job.",
        "John: T\u00e9a says it's an accident, and the physical evidence seems to support that. So until this young lady can remember something else--",
        "Dorian: Blair cannot remember, and so LPD will just have to build a case without her.",
        "John: Right now there is no case, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Because you let T\u00e9a go.",
        "John: Given the evidence, Officer Fish seems to have made the right call.",
        "Dorian: Oh, this is an outrage. Please. Once I am mayor, I can tell you the Llanview police department is gonna be held to a new standard of accountability.",
        "John: I can't wait. By the way, congratulations. When's the big day?",
        "Blair: What--what are you talking--what big day?",
        "Dorian: Um, no, darling. This is not the right time.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Dorian: Uh-uh. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: John has to be stopped.",
        "Marty: I'll see you next week.",
        "Natalie: Again, I'm--I'm sorry. Honestly, I'm--I'm sorry.",
        "Marty: Okay, sit down and tell me what's going on.",
        "Natalie: This is a really bad idea.",
        "Marty: Okay. Let's not make it worse. You said this was about John.",
        "Natalie: He's really out of control. Honestly, I mean, I know that John always goes above and beyond, and I was always his biggest defender. But--",
        "Marty: And now?",
        "Natalie: Now--now I actually understand why our former corrupt mayor wanted him put on a leash. He's abusing his authority.",
        "Marty: With you?",
        "Natalie: No. With my husband Jared. He's railroading him.",
        "Marty: I'm sorry to hear that, but I still don't understand what I can do to help.",
        "Natalie: It's simple. You're John's girlfriend, and you have got to get him to back off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well, I'm not surprised Schuyler and Kim liked that movie--one's your ex, and the other's your best friend.",
        "Stacy: So the mother of your child has no taste? Is that really how you're gonna talk about me?",
        "Rex: Sorry. I'll get you your on-demand channels. Anything else?",
        "Stacy: Look, Rex, I know you have every reason to hate me.",
        "Rex: And?",
        "Stacy: We're having a baby. It's not healthy for me to fight with you half the time and then worry about you the other half.",
        "Rex: So don't worry about me.",
        "Stacy: How do you expect me to do that with Kim telling me you and Gigi walked out of the movie?",
        "Rex: So?",
        "Stacy: Well, she said it was because Gigi was upset that she saw her with Schuyler. I told her she was just imagining things, unless you two are having problems? Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: So how did you and Rex end up going to \"Glass Slipper\"?",
        "Gigi: I don't know. We were talking about it for a while. Certainly didn't know you were gonna be there.",
        "Schuyler: No?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Schuyler: So it was just--just coincidence?",
        "Gigi: What else could it be?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. No, I mean, that's--yeah, that's what I thought it was, too, at first.",
        "Gigi: \"At first\"?",
        "Schuyler: Ha. Well, I--obviously Kim had other thoughts.",
        "Gigi: Kim has thoughts? Who knew? What thoughts did she have?",
        "Schuyler: She thought that--you know, you're right. It's stupid. This is stupid.",
        "Gigi: I'm sure it is, but let's hear it anyway.",
        "Schuyler: She thought that you followed us.",
        "Gigi: And why would I do that?",
        "Schuyler: Because--okay, let's just say upfront this is not-- this is not me saying this.",
        "Gigi: What did Kim say, Schuyler?",
        "Schuyler: She thought that maybe you appeared jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Kim's imagining things. Gigi and I couldn't be better.",
        "Stacy: Then why did you two run out of the theater?",
        "Rex: Nobody ran. Gigi and I walked out of the movie because Gigi was bored, okay? She does not have a problem with Kim and Schuyler going out together.",
        "Stacy: Oh, really? Because, see, Kim had the idea that Gigi wanted to tear her head off.",
        "Rex: Well, I'm sure Kim gets that a lot. To be fair, I wouldn't be surprised if Gigi was a little steamed. The last thing we wanted to do was to run into your partner in crime.",
        "Stacy: Kim does have a tendency of making things about her.",
        "Rex: Trust me; Gigi is not jealous of Kim or...",
        "Stacy: Who said she was jealous?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm jealous of Kim? Why would I be jealous of her? Because she went out with you?",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Ouch.",
        "Gigi: Sorry. You know what I mean.",
        "Schuyler: No, I know. It's--it's ridiculous. Kim had some crazy ideas. I set her straight. So...",
        "Gigi: Thanks. I hope her crazy ideas didn't ruin your date.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I don't really know if another date is in the cards.",
        "Gigi: That's--that's too bad.",
        "Schuyler: Could you at least, like, you know, pretend you mean that?",
        "Gigi: I am pretending to mean that.",
        "Schuyler: Anyway, I don't really want to get into it right now.",
        "Gigi: No problem. But, you know, you can talk to me about it if you want, even if it is about her. There isn't anything you can't tell me.",
        "Kim's voice: From where I'm sitting, she's looking at you the way you've been looking at her.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I promise you if we find evidence contradicting Tea's accounts, we will reopen the investigation. How's that?",
        "Dorian: Not bad, for now.",
        "John: And if Blair happens to remember what happened...",
        "Blair: Well, that's right at the top of my list, believe me.",
        "John: How about you work on getting out of here first?",
        "Blair: Whatever you say, Doctor.",
        "John: I'm, uh, I'm tired of seeing you in here.",
        "John: I'll check in on you soon.",
        "Blair: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Blair: Oh, stop it. Stop.",
        "Dorian: \"Whatever you say, Doctor.\" And, you know, he cares about you.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? So what? He chose Marty.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. Well, why he chose that psycho drama queen I'll never know. You know, if she had not come back here--well, who knows where John would be, or with whom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You're asking me to interfere in a police investigation.",
        "Natalie: I know, okay? But I--I wouldn't ask you to do this if I didn't think that it was...",
        "Marty: Okay, you know what? I don't know about you, but I've never been able to get John to back off from anything, especially when it comes to his work.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Me neither.",
        "Marty: And he does not talk to me about his cases.",
        "Natalie: Can you at least try?",
        "Marty: If I did, how do you think he would respond?",
        "Natalie: He'd know that I put you up to it, and then he would just come down harder on Jared. This was a huge mistake. I don't know why I'm here. I just-- God. I just felt I had to do something, you know?",
        "Marty: I understand.",
        "Natalie: There's nothing I can do to help my husband, is there?",
        "Marty: Well, I don't think this end-run around John is the answer, but maybe we can come up with something else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: You're gonna sue me?",
        "Elijah: Yeah. You, the entire LPD, and maybe even the city, unless you release my client right now.",
        "Oliver: What did I do this time?",
        "Elijah: Well, let's start with what you didn't do. To begin with, you didn't take my client to the hospital after he received a savage beating.",
        "Oliver: He seemed fine.",
        "Elijah: Wait, are you qualified to make that call? Because I'm willing to bet that the answer is no. So you denied my client vital medical attention, without which any number of...",
        "Oliver: Okay, fine. You know what? I'll arrange for a doctor to have a look at your client...",
        "Elijah: Well, thank you very much.",
        "Oliver: In his cell.",
        "Elijah: What? No. Wait, you can't do that.",
        "Oliver: Are you my boss? Because something tells me that the answer is no. And only my boss can tell me what I can and cannot do. You know what? Not you, not my parents, not the gay and lesbian caucus. Not my ex, my ex's new boyfriend, or Dorian Lord's gay fianc\u00e9e!",
        "Elijah: Well, I was just asking you to look at the facts.",
        "Oliver: No, no. You're trying to push me around, and you know what? I get it. That's what lawyers do. T\u00e9a Delgado tried to do the same thing to me this morning after she shoved Blair Cramer out a window...",
        "Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Say that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Things went from bad to worse until what?",
        "T\u00e9a: I said something, something I should not have said. And Blair...",
        "Blair: You had Todd Manning's child and you kept it from him? Wow, T\u00e9a. That's the mistake of your life, because he has to know.",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair threatened me.",
        "Todd: So then you pushed her out the window?",
        "T\u00e9a: That is not what happened!",
        "Todd: Really?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes.",
        "Todd: Because you're making it sound like Blair's fault. And that's really not true, is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you trying to say, Todd?",
        "Todd: I just think you did it on purpose...like you want Blair out of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Hey, Gigi. Why'd you run out last night? You didn't like the movie?",
        "Gigi: Not my cup of tea.",
        "Kim: Oh, you don't like romance? That's too bad. We loved it.",
        "Patron: Excuse me, Miss? Miss?",
        "Kim: You got a customer.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, um, what are you doing?",
        "Kim: Be cool. I'm trying to help you out. See? Look.",
        "Schuyler: I think you're misreading the situation a little bit.",
        "Kim: Really? Don't look at me. Look at her. What did I tell you? Gigi's totally into you. You need to go for it!",
        "Gigi: What the hell kind of bad advice are you giving him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Why would Gigi be jealous of Schuyler and Kim?",
        "Rex: She wouldn't.",
        "Stacy: Because if anybody should be jealous of Kim, it's me. I mean, Schuyler's my ex, not Gigi's.",
        "Rex: Hey, why don't you crazy kids get back together?",
        "Stacy: Uh, I'm pregnant. Besides, I think they--they make a cute couple, as long as Gigi doesn't stand in their way.",
        "Rex: She won't.",
        "Stacy: Well, that's a relief. If you have any doubts about that and you need a friend to talk to, I'm here.",
        "Rex: Let me get something straight. Um, you and me, not friends. The only connection there is between us is this baby. Okay? Nothing else. Not now, not ever. Got it?",
        "Stacy: Well, excuse me for caring.",
        "Rex: Please, Stacy, don't care. Don't forget we have a doctor's appointment coming up. You know, you're far enough along. I think the doctor could do a paternity test.",
        "Stacy: But I thought we agreed that we would wait till after the baby's born for that.",
        "Rex: No. You insisted, I just went along with you.",
        "Stacy: Look, I'm not gonna do anything that's gonna hurt my baby. You think I don't want this test? I'm looking forward to it. Look, I'm sure it's gonna prove you're the father of my child. Just like you're sure that Gigi only has eyes for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Whoa, whoa. Blair went out a window? Is she alive?",
        "Oliver: Yeah. She could've been killed, but they took her to the hospital. And now they're gonna...",
        "Elijah: Hey, Ross! Ross!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You really think that I'm capable of pushing Blair out a window on purpose?",
        "Todd: I don't know. You tell me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wow. This is the last time I'm gonna tell you: It was an accident.",
        "Todd: And that's what I want to believe. You know, if this had happened just 2 days ago, I probably would've been convinced that Blair jumped out the window just to stick it to you. I believed in you that much. But now... I just--I don't even recognize you, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm still me, Todd.",
        "Todd: And who is that, exactly? Because the T\u00e9a Delgado that I knew and loved didn't lie to me. She was brutally honest. She wouldn't keep secrets from me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Like you've never kept a secret, Todd.",
        "Todd: No, I know I'm a jerk. I know that I'm a liar...",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: And a bastard.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh.",
        "Todd: But you know what I never lied about? How much I was in love with you. So in love with you. This woman, this wonderful woman that came back into my life, was my greatest champion, my best friend. And now I just don't--I--well, that woman's gone.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I think--I think that's where you're wrong. That woman's still here. You're talking about the woman you keep abandoning to go back to Blair? Yeah, that--that woman's still here. Look at you. Look at you. You're doing it again. Ha ha ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: We're not gonna discuss John McBain. He's off-limits to you.",
        "Dorian: Fine.",
        "Blair: Good.",
        "Dorian: So is Todd.",
        "Blair: Oh, no, no. You don't get to make the rules here, especially after you paid Ross to screw up my plans. And don't tell me you did it for my own good. Because of you, I had to sleep in that little cramped cabin in the boat all night long.",
        "Dorian: You almost died because you would not leave well enough alone.",
        "Blair: Oh, well, if you had left well enough alone, then maybe Todd would've found out about T\u00e9a at their wedding. And I might not have crashed through that window.",
        "Dorian: Is it my fault that every time you demean yourself for Todd, something catastrophic happens? I'm telling you, I am trying to save you from yourself.",
        "Blair: Well, just leave me alone and back off. My brain's all scrambled right now.",
        "Dorian: Thanks to T\u00e9a. But don't you worry, darling. I'm a doctor.",
        "Blair: Well, I want a real doctor.",
        "Dorian: I am a real doctor.",
        "Blair: I want a doctor that's gonna get whatever's stuck inside of my head out. Because I want it out now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I'm sure we can think of some way that you can help Jared.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. I should go.",
        "Marty: Okay. Well, let me know if you change your mind.",
        "Natalie: Sure. It's just I don't know if it's a good idea that I'm taking advice from John's girlfriend.",
        "Marty: Isn't that why you're here?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. But that's--that's also the reason I should go.",
        "Marty: You know what? I know this is not easy. Watching someone you love so much being accused of something so horrible? That would take a toll on even the healthiest relationships. You know, foster doubt in the minds of people that would normally trust each other completely.",
        "Natalie: No, no, I don't doubt my husband.",
        "Marty: I was referring to your trust in John. Come on. You sure you don't just want to talk?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Marty: Hey.",
        "John: I'm sorry. I thought you were done for the day. What's going on?",
        "Marty: We're just, uh, having a chat.",
        "Natalie: You don't have to cover for me. No, I came here to see if Marty could get you to lay off Jared. But I realize that's a mistake because--well, John McBain's always right, even when he's dead wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Thanks to you.",
        "Elijah: Whoa. Don't try to pin this on me. Come on, we all saw what happened.",
        "Oliver: Don't worry.",
        "Elijah: He high-tailed it out of here when you told him about Blair Cramer.",
        "Oliver: All right. And I'm not gonna sue you. Did you put out an APB?",
        "Officer: Right away. He took off. He won't get far.",
        "Oliver: Yeah, he won't. Because I know exactly where he's going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Blair, I know how important it is to you to remember what preceded your fall. And I'll do anything and everything I can to help.",
        "Blair: But...",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry, honey. I just don't think you should get your hopes up too high.",
        "Blair: Dorian, don't even say that, because I've got to remember.",
        "Dorian: I know. But the brain is a very complicated and mysterious thing. I mean, nobody really understands it. Darling, you may never get that memory back.",
        "Ross: Blair! You all right?",
        "Blair: Ross? What are you doing here?",
        "Ross: Just tell me you're gonna be okay.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm okay. I'm just a little banged up, that's all.",
        "Ross: Oh. Thank God. Oh, when I found out what had happened, I just got...",
        "Blair: What's going on with you? Are you all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm not going back to Blair, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're still choosing her over me.",
        "Todd: No, I'm not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course you are. That's what you do. I'm stupid trying to think you'd ever change.",
        "Todd: But you know I've changed, don't you? You know, you changed me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Apparently not enough. Blair gets into trouble, and you drop everything to go help her. You always have, and you always will.",
        "Todd: My God, it's not as if she had a run in her stocking. She fell from 2 stories up! She crashed through the window onto a pool cover! You know what my first thought was? \"Oh, my God, my kids' mother is going to die now!\" Now, what would you have me do? Now, would you have me just send her some flowers and walk away? \"See you.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: You didn't have to shut me out. You could've listened to me for once.",
        "Todd: All right, look, I-- you know what? I don't--I'm not gonna even try to explain what it's like to be a parent to you. You wouldn't understand.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're right. I wouldn't. Blair's the mother of your children. And me? I'm just the bad guy.",
        "Todd: You want to know something? Do you want to know why I was at Dorian's?",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know. You were looking for Blair, I guess.",
        "Todd: I was looking for you. I wanted to fix things with you.",
        "T\u00e9a: You were?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I felt so bad without you. And I knew that I had jumped the gun in kicking you out.",
        "T\u00e9a: Really?",
        "Todd: Yes. I tried calling you, and there was no answer.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Because when Blair saw it was you calling, she smashed my phone.",
        "Todd: That sounds like her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha ha ha.",
        "Todd: And yet I called you, there was no answer. So I went looking for you. I went to the police station. You weren't there. So I figured you went to Dorian's to have it out with Blair. So I went to Dorian's, and...",
        "T\u00e9a: The rest is history.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: If you had found me, what would you have said?",
        "Todd: I was gonna say that I still loved you and that I wanted you to be my wife still.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's not too late, you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Are you referring to a particular case?",
        "Natalie: Do you still think that Jared's guilty? I have nothing to talk about with you.",
        "John: Natalie, I have to follow the evidence.",
        "Natalie: Even when that evidence is taking you down the wrong path?",
        "John: Exactly. And if Jared's innocent, I'll find that out, too.",
        "Natalie: Well, I won't hold my breath. But I will make sure that Jared gets out of this mess, with or without you.",
        "John: Well, I--Jared might help himself by telling the truth. Maybe you can convince him to do that.",
        "Natalie: He is telling the truth.",
        "John: No, he's not, and you know it.",
        "John: I'm sorry about that.",
        "Marty: No, it's okay. I just wish I could've done more to help her.",
        "John: I'm sure you did everything you could.",
        "Marty: Yeah, she's pretty hurt, confused. It's clear that you two have pretty strong feelings for each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Really, where do you get off sticking your nose in our business?",
        "Kim: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Gigi: First, you feed Schuyler a load of bull about me following you to the movies.",
        "Schuyler: I--Geeg, you're not--",
        "Kim: You were totally following us.",
        "Gigi: I did not. Rex surprised me with the tickets, and he didn't even know you were there.",
        "Kim: Sure. Like, I believe that.",
        "Gigi: It's true. You can ask him.",
        "Kim: And even if you didn't follow us, so what? You made it pretty clear you don't want Schuyler to be anywhere near me.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, that's because he deserves someone nicer, someone classier.",
        "Kim: Like you? That's what you're saying, isn't it? If you can't have Schuyler Joplin, no one can.",
        "Gigi: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Kim: Look. You can't even keep your eyes off him. Like, last night, how much time did you spend watching the movie, and how much time did you spend watching us?",
        "Gigi: Well, you were hard to miss--you were making out like teenagers.",
        "Kim: Like I said, jealous.",
        "Gigi: Okay, I don't have time for this. From now on, keep your mouth shut, and stay the hell away from me and the people I care about.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, you don't have to do this.",
        "Kim: I can help my friends whenever I want to.",
        "Gigi: It doesn't help Schuyler to encourage him to throw away our friendship.",
        "Kim: It does if it gets him an upgrade. You know, friends with benefits? I don't think either of you would have a problem with that.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, you know what? I think we're done here for the day.",
        "Kim: Okay, you guys obviously are hot for each other. Ask anyone. Ask Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm not exactly sure what you're saying, but Natalie and I were a long time ago.",
        "Marty: And there's still a connection, a pretty strong one.",
        "John: Is that your professional opinion?",
        "Marty: Come on. Look how easily you push each other's buttons.",
        "John: Yeah, well, we have a lot of history. You ready to go?",
        "Marty: I got to make one more phone call. I want to check in on Blair, see what her condition is. You did hear, right?",
        "John: I was over there.",
        "Marty: Yeah, Cole told me. T\u00e9a pushed her out the window?",
        "John: Allegedly. The important thing is it looks like Blair's gonna be okay. I don't know if I can say the same for T\u00e9a.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You want to be my husband or not?",
        "Todd: I don't know. You nearly killed my kids' mother. I don't know if I can trust you with them.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're right. What do I know about being a mother? I don't--I don't have the first clue.",
        "Todd: God, if you'd just been honest with me from the beginning...",
        "T\u00e9a: Come on, Todd. Do you think if I told you about Ross and--and everything else, do you think we wouldn't have ended up right where we are right now?",
        "Todd: Maybe.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, come on. You and me, we always find a reason to get at each other's throat.",
        "Todd: I think you're wrong about that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, Todd, sooner or later I would've done something to drive you crazy, that would've given you an excuse to go running back to Blair. But you know what? Look, this time I'm--I'm not gonna stop you.",
        "Todd: So you want me to go back to Blair? Is that what you're saying?",
        "T\u00e9a: I think it's pretty clear that what I want doesn't matter.",
        "T\u00e9a: As for what you want, she is right down the hall. So go to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Uh, look. These?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Ross: Oh, well, this is just a little mix-up with local law enforcement. It's nothing, nothing to worry about.",
        "Dorian: Did they forget to take the cuffs off you when they released you?",
        "Ross: Uh, yeah. Yeah, they were super busy today. They had law stuff. But I'll return them. But, look, I'm more worried about you. So--so did T\u00e9a actually push you out of a window?",
        "Blair: Well--",
        "Dorian: Definitely.",
        "Ross: Uh, you don't know?",
        "Blair: Well, everything's just really murky right now. I do remember that we were having an argument about her marriage to you. And then the next thing I remember, I just--I woke up here.",
        "Ross: What happened to T\u00e9a?",
        "Dorian: She should've been arrested.",
        "Blair: There is no evidence that she actually pushed me.",
        "Dorian: However, she could be confessing right now.",
        "Blair: Now, why would she do that?",
        "Dorian: She wouldn't intend to. But if anybody can weasel a confession out of her, it's Todd.",
        "Ross: Wait. Tea's with Manning?",
        "Dorian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: Well, he hustled her out of my E.R. room earlier today.",
        "Ross: Oh, I'm sorry. I--I got to go.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Ross: I wish I could stay, but I--I've got to find T\u00e9a.",
        "Oliver: The only place you're going is back to jail.",

        "Rex: Can we talk now, please?",
        "Gigi: Thanks a lot.",
        "Schuyler: That was so not cool, Kim.",
        "Kim: Sorry if that was uncomfortable for you.",
        "Schuyler: \"Uncomfortable\"? \"Uncomfortable\" doesn't even begin to describe...",
        "Kim: Sometimes the truth hurts. Gigi wants you. I know it, Gigi knows it, and now you and Rex know, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: So still want to grab a bite before you get back to the station, or are there any other exes we need to check in with?",
        "John: I'm all yours.",
        "Marty: Are you--are you really all that hungry? Because I'm thinking there might be another way we could occupy our time. Mm. Go lock the door. Go lock the door.",

        "Natalie: Hal. I need you to do me a little favor and let me see Jared.",
        "Hal: Sorry, Natalie. Visiting hours are over.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's a shame, because I'd hate to call my uncle right now and wake him up at this hour just because one of his men weren't going to let me see my husband.",

        "Natalie: Thank you.",

        "Todd: Really? You never were my wife, were you? You're just an ex-fianc\u00e9e.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oliver: Mr. Raymond--or whatever your name is--you'll be returning to the station with me. And you know what? It'd be best if you just did this quietly, because I wouldn't want to have to get physical.",
        "Ross: I'd like to see you try.",
        "Blair: Oh, what's going on, guys?",
        "Oliver: This man assaulted a police officer, me, and then escaped police custody.",
        "Ross: Obviously, I had somewhere to be.",
        "Blair: Ross, did you escape custody just to see me?",
        "Oliver: Yeah, and he attacked a police officer.",
        "Ross: I wanted to make sure you're okay.",
