        "Brody: What are you doing?",
        "Jessica: Bo's holding a press conference this morning. Hopefully by the time you get to the station, someone will call in with--",
        "Brody: Ah ah. You got to try not to obsess about all this.",
        "Jessica: I know, I know, but my cousins have been kidnapped by someone who's already--",
        "Brody: Hey, hey. He is not gonna hurt them. They're his only leverage. And today is all about one thing: Finding those girls and bringing them home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reporter: Do you have a probable location for where the young women are being held?",
        "Second Reporter: The kidnapper has multiple priors, including felony murder. Why wasn't he prosecuted, commissioner?",
        "Third Reporter: Is Lieutenant John McBain going to provide any details on the investigation?",
        "Bo: Excuse me. If you would give me a chance, I would like to read this prepared statement. First of all, I want to thank you all for coming. As most of you know, the LPD is seeking this man--Elijah Clarke--who kidnapped Danielle Rayburn, 16; Starr Manning, 18; and her daughter Hope, 23 months. Clarke was last seen approximately 12 hours ago driving a late model red sedan out of the parking lot at Cherryvale clinic in Cherryvale, Pennsylvania. It is presumed that all 3 of the victims were in the car at that time. Lieutenant John McBain of the LPD gave chase, but currently, we do not know the location of the vehicle or of the 3 girls.",
        "Kelly: Many of you have been here all night working the phones. Todd thanks you for that. I thank you for that. Together we can be a valuable partner with law enforcement, so keep your eyes and your ears open, and let's bring these girls home.",
        "Bo: Lieutenant McBain remains in the field working around the clock. He's committed to pursuing any verifiable lead that comes in on our hotline. I would also like to thank my assistant Inez Salinger, who stayed up all last night organizing volunteers to distribute these fliers. Undoubtedly the kidnapper will reach out to Todd Manning to negotiate the girls' release, but we hope to apprehend Elijah Clarke before that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hannah, thank God. I've been calling all over town.",
        "Hannah: Oh, I'm so sorry. I should have left a note.",
        "Marty: Eli Clarke has my granddaughter and Starr. I thought he'd gotten to you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Absolutely. Of course. Look, if you or Blair need anything at all, anything, I'm right here, okay? Oh, come on. You're welcome. Bye.",
        "Clint: Viki, I just heard. I'm so sorry.",
        "Viki: Oh, God, it's awful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: One of the good things about being mayor is I have the e-mail addresses of a lot of my constituents. Let's hope one of them calls that hotline soon.",
        "Langston: Well, I went on MyFace last night, and look. See how many people went on Starr's page to put in a good word? It has to help, right? Well, um, I need some coffee. Do you want me to get you some?",
        "Dorian: No, thank you.",
        "Langston: Okay.",
        "Dorian: Langston? Um, why don't you make yourself some breakfast? You haven't eaten anything yet.",
        "Langston: Okay.",

        "Woman: Say \"cheese.\"",

        "Viki: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fall apart on you.",
        "Clint: It's all right. How is Todd holding up?",
        "Viki: I'm very worried about him. You know, those 3 girls mean everything to him in the world.",
        "Clint: They're gonna be all right.",
        "Viki: Yes, they have to be.",
        "Clint: They will be.",
        "Viki: Well, thanks for the shoulder. Why else are you here? What's up?",
        "Clint: Well, I got a visit yesterday from a familiar face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I don't know who hired you, but this house is off limits.",
        "Woman: Dorian, it's me--Echo. Echo DiSavoy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Before I send you back to your desks, could you do me a favor? Can you take a moment and ask whoever or whatever your higher power is to help bring Danielle, Starr, and her baby home safely, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I'm fine. Eli didn't touch me.",
        "Marty: Then where have you been all night?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: That's all I have for you at this time.",
        "Reporter: Commissioner, can't you give us any more--",
        "Second Reporter: Commissioner, why did you wait so long to release this information?",
        "Third Reporter: A statement from the parents, Commissioner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Bastard. Starr and Hope would be safe right now if it weren't for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well, I've been worried about you, but judging by that speech, you're handling this like a champ.",
        "Kelly: Yeah. You know, I'm just trying to do what I need to do for Todd and for\u0097",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Echo DiSavoy! La salope de Llanview. That's French for \"slut.\"",
        "Echo's voice: Dorian, I had no intention of engineering a breakup of Clint and Viki's marriage. Clint seduced me. Now, I know there are ugly rumors going around town contrary to that, but--",
        "Dorian's voice: Well, actually, to tell you the truth, I never thought that Viki was capable of controlling Clint's cowboy urges.",
        "Echo: You wound me, Dorian. I thought we were friends.",
        "Dorian: Ha ha ha! You're too smart a cookie to think we were ever friends. In fact, it would be delusional.",
        "Echo: Oh, come on. We go way back, you and me. After all, we almost put Clint Buchanan in prison for life.",
        "Dorian: I was doing my civic duty, and I continue to do that to this day. In fact, did you know I'm the mayor of this town now? Yes, I am, and I have a lot better things to do than take a stroll down memory lane with you.",
        "Echo: Yes, I know. Two of these girls are your family, aren't they?",
        "Dorian: Yes, my grandniece and her daughter.",
        "Echo: Well, my heart goes out to all of you.",
        "Dorian: That would come in handy, if only you had a heart. Thank you for your concern.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Even though you told me that she was in town, I truly didn't expect to run into her.",
        "Viki: What do you want to bet she arranged it? Honestly, Clint, I never thought that woman Echo would have the nerve to show up here again.",
        "Clint: She was never short on nerve. Anyway, I put a P.I. on her.",
        "Viki: You did? So did I.",
        "Clint: You did? Who?",
        "Viki: Rex Balsom. Of course, that was before I heard about the kidnapping, so quite frankly, Echo is the least of my worries right now.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I hear you, but Rex is good, so just let me know what he finds out, will you?",
        "Viki: Yeah, okay.",
        "Clint: If this is for Jessie, why don't you let me take it up?",
        "Viki: I would, but she said she had something to talk to me about. I don't know, maybe it's a mother/daughter thing.",
        "Clint: Oh, I don't know. I mean, she called me last night and said she wanted me to stop by, so maybe she wants to talk to her daddy, too.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Last night when I was searching for Starr and Dani and Hope, all I could think about was how lucky we are to be having a kid, and even if Ford is the father, this baby is a part of you, Jess, like Bree is a part of you, and we both know how much I love her. So it's all good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Putting yourself on the line is one thing, but you had to drag Starr into it.",
        "James: That wasn't part of the plan.",
        "Cole: She's Dani's sister. You knew she'd be there.",
        "James: I didn't want her to get hurt.",
        "Cole: Yeah, that's what you said before when you practically got her killed. But it's not just her this time, is it? It's my daughter. You put my baby girl in the hands of a killer, all because you want to get back in Starr's life.",
        "James: I'm sorry. Cole, I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I couldn't just do nothing. I've been passing out fliers most of the night.",
        "Marty: With Cole?",
        "Hannah: He was there? We must have been in different groups. I didn't see him.",
        "Marty: But how did you get those scratches?",
        "Hannah: Um, they gave us flashlights, but the batteries in mine weren't working, and I tripped into some bushes. I'm fine, though.",
        "Marty: I'll get you some antiseptic.",
        "Hannah: No. I'll do it later.",
        "Marty: You don't want those cuts to get infected.",
        "Hannah: It's nothing compared to what Starr and Hope are going through.",
        "Marty: You know exactly how they feel, don't you? I mean, Eli tried to kill you.",
        "Hannah: He did kill your baby.",
        "Marty: He can't get my grandchild. He can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I could lose two people who mean more to me than anything in this world, and all you can say is you're sorry? Why don't you go to hell?",
        "Woman: Oh, my gosh!",
        "Man: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: You don't have to drink this. I just wanted to do something.",
        "Marty: Thank you. That's very kind.",
        "Hannah: You're thanking me.",
        "Marty: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Hannah: Because I'm the one who owes you for getting me out of the hospital and bringing me here after all of the lies that I told.",
        "Marty: The lies that Eli Clarke forced you to tell.",
        "Hannah: I can't blame it all on him. There's a part of me that wanted Cole for myself. I came between him and Starr, and now...",
        "Marty: Now what?",
        "Hannah: I'm the reason that Hope and Starr are missing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Break it up!",
        "James: I'm sorry! I never should have gotten Starr involved.",
        "Cole: You broke the law. You put Starr in the middle of it, and it wasn't your job to rescue Dani.",
        "Nate: You got the wrong brother, okay? James only did it because I asked him to. You want to blame somebody, blame me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Look, this isn't easy for me to talk about, but it involves your grandchild, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. Um, there's a chance that Brody might not be the father of this baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: That'll teach you to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.",
        "Rex: At least no one's naked.",
        "Kelly: Well, in exchange for your shoulder, is there anything I can do for you?",
        "Rex: You know, I should just come back another time.",
        "Kelly: No. No, it's okay. What is it?",
        "Rex: I'm doing some research for a client, and your archives would be a big help.",
        "Kelly: Sure. No problem. I'll get you set up into the system. Who's the client?",
        "Rex: Viki. She wants me to dig up whatever I can on this woman who made a lot of headlines in the eighties.",
        "Kelly: Sounds intriguing.",
        "Rex: Yeah. She definitely left her mark. Just ask Charlie Banks or Clint Buchanan.",
        "Kelly: Charlie and Clint? Who is this femme fatale?",
        "Rex: Well, you won't forget her name, I can promise you that. Echo DiSavoy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: In a situation like this, you can never have too many volunteers. Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Dorian: Oh, you're still here.",
        "Echo: Yes, well, we have a lot of catching up to do.",
        "Dorian: Why don't we make a date to do that, like never?",
        "Echo: My, my, Dorian. I don't understand this attitude, especially since we have so much in common. Unless, of course, you've lost your desire to see Queen Victoria miserable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Markko. Oh, my God. Is your dad--",
        "Markko: No, no. My dad's fine. He should be home from the hospital in a couple days.",
        "Langston: Oh, good. Sorry. It's just that you said we weren't going to be seeing each other, so I figured the only way you would come over here is if--",
        "Markko: Lang, I heard about the kidnapping. You must be freaking out. Is there anything I can do? Are you okay?",
        "Langston: Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: James didn't do anything for you or Dani. All he cared about was getting closer to Starr. He doesn't give a damn about you!",
        "Bo: Take it easy, Cole.",
        "Cole: There's a court order, right? James doesn't care about that. Do you? He took Dani and locked her up in his apartment. So if you want me to settle down, you better lock him up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I love you. Call you later.",
        "Rex: How are they?",
        "Kelly: Terrible. How's the research going?",
        "Rex: It doesn't seem too important right now. Are you sure there's nothing I can do around here?",
        "Kelly: You can try to take my mind off the fact that the man who murdered my mother now has 3 more people in his clutches. Talk to me about the woman with the crazy name.",
        "Rex: Uh, okay. Well, back when the \"Sun\" was the \"Intruder,\" Clint and Echo were front-page news--some steamy affair.",
        "Kelly: When he was married to Viki?",
        "Rex: Yeah, and for Echo, it was about revenge. She thought that Clint had killed her mother, so the only reason she came back to Llanview was to ruin his life. Clint got wind, tried to break things off, and she threatened to commit suicide.",
        "Kelly: Some drama.",
        "Rex: Yeah. That's not the best part. Clint tried to stop her, and she threw herself off the Brynview Bridge. And guess who accused Clint of pushing her to her death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Echo, sometimes things do change, and now I have nothing but respect for Viki.",
        "Echo: Really? How's your respect for Clint Buchanan these days? Because I seem to remember you accusing him of murdering me.",
        "Dorian: Obviously I was wrong because here you are, still the same conniving schemer you always were.",
        "Echo: Oh, honey, after what you did to Chuckles, you could give me a run for my money any day of the week.",
        "Dorian: Chuckles?",
        "Echo: Charlie Banks. I heard all about what you did to him--how you tried to force liquor down his throat, even knowing what it could do to him. Of course, that was after all that unpleasantness with Clint, when you took his company right after he dumped you.",
        "Dorian: I don't know where you're getting your information from.",
        "Echo: Don't get me wrong. My hat is off to you. After all, great minds...",
        "Dorian: The day my mind resembles yours, I'll check myself into a mental hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: How did Clint beat the rap?",
        "Rex: Echo faked her own death, and when they were about to throw the book at Clint, she was alive and well, reading all about it in the newspapers.",
        "Kelly: Poor Clint.",
        "Clint's voice: You saw what you came to see, and that is it. It would be very unwise to share this with Kelly or anybody else.",
        "Rex's voice: If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were threatening me, Clint.",
        "Rex: \"Poor Clint\"? No. Do not even think about feeling sorry for that S.O.B.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Did you really cheat on Clint with that Vickers guy? Because just between us, mm mm mm. Yummy. Such a shame he left you at the altar.",
        "Dorian: How dare you! There has been a kidnapping. For goodness sakes, you're wasting my time! And what are you doing here anyway, hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It happened the night of prom, and we all know how messed up I was back then. I was stuck in the past, obsessed with Cristian. And...I had watched him propose to Layla, and I ended up crying in someone else's arms.",
        "Viki: Honey, go on.",
        "Jessica: It was... one thing led to another. I just let it happen, you know?",
        "Clint: No, Jess. Some guy who should have known better let it happen. Who is he?",
        "Jessica: It doesn't matter now.",
        "Clint: The hell it doesn't! You were not yourself that night. You were vulnerable. What kind of scum takes advantage of that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You know, James was just trying to help his brother out. They can't lock you up for that.",
        "Inez: Well, this is a first. You and I agree on something. The commissioner is a good man. He will do the right thing.",
        "Ford: Yeah, and his brother's not so bad, either. I have my job back at L.U., thanks to Clint Buchanan. Well, thanks to both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: They're not really going to arrest you, are they?",
        "James: I don't care. Until Hope and Starr are safe, I don't give a damn what happens to me.",
        "Nate: Yeah. I know what you mean.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Starr and your daughter are missing. It doesn't get worse. I get that. But putting James in jail, that isn't going to bring them home, Cole.",
        "Cole: If he hadn't gotten Starr involved, she wouldn't have been a target.",
        "Bo: But you're blaming the wrong guy. James didn't kidnap them. Elijah Clarke did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: How can what happened to the girls be your fault?",
        "Hannah: I'm so sorry.",
        "Marty: For what?",
        "Hannah: When Cole was here and you told us that Eli was still alive, I was terrified to be by myself, and Cole stayed here, but he should have gone home.",
        "Marty: Hannah...",
        "Hannah: No. If Cole was with Starr and Hope, like he should have been, they wouldn't be in danger right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Now, you don't need to be here in a police station throwing punches, Cole. You need to be with your family. So you go take care of your mom and I'll take care of getting Starr and Hope back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: Here.",
        "James: No.",
        "Inez: I don't want your face to swell.",
        "James: I don't think anybody's going to care what I look like in jail, do you?",
        "Inez: You're not going to go to jail.",
        "James: Tell that to your boss.",
        "Bo: You're free to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Hey, Brody... how's Jessica? Is the baby okay?",
        "Brody: For a guy who keeps saying you don't care about the baby, you sure ask a lot of questions. That's got to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Dad, it's okay. I just want to forget it. This guy...this whole thing was just a big mistake.",
        "Clint: Not your mistake, his mistake. And he is going to pay for it.",
        "Viki: Oh, now, Clint--Clint...",
        "Clint: I'm sorry, Jess. But this affects our grandchild. I need to know who it is, and so does your mother.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, your dad is right.",
        "Clint: Who is he?",
        "Jessica: Robert Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: What did Clint Buchanan ever do to you?",
        "Rex: Well, he cheated on Viki, for one thing. I can never respect anybody who does that, especially when it's with somebody like Echo Di... whatever. And now she's back in town up in Viki's face when there's this family crisis? The whole thing reeks.",
        "Kelly: Does Viki have any idea what this woman wants?",
        "Rex: Well, it could be she wants Charlie back--or Clint--but right now, I have no idea.",
        "Kelly: Well, you know what? Just make sure that Ms. DiSavoy goes away. The last thing this town needs is any more trouble right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Listen, I've heard a lot about Robert Ford and it's all bad. You're not the first woman he's preyed on.",
        "Clint: Somewhere along the line, somebody should have stopped him. I guess that's my job now.",
        "Jessica: Dad, look, I just--I just want to move on from this.",
        "Clint: Move on? He forced himself on you! The son of a bitch is lucky I'm not gonna kill him!",
        "Viki: Clint, would you please not go there?",
        "Jessica: He didn't force himself on me. Really.",
        "Viki: Oh, darling, come on. That's a technicality. As your father said, you were not in your right mind. You thought you were 17 years old. Now, Robert Ford must have known that, right?",
        "Clint: He knew it, and he just didn't care. He used you, and there is no defense for that.",
        "Jessica: I came to him. Okay? He reacted in the moment. It was just...it was one night, one terrible night, and the chances that I got pregnant at that exact moment are next to nothing, so please, let's just remember that this baby probably isn't Ford's. And even if it is, he doesn't want it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I heard that Jessica's doctor put her on bed rest. I can't ask if she and the baby are okay?",
        "Brody: We had an agreement. You're not supposed to care about the baby.",
        "Ford: I guess I feel a little different now.",
        "Brody: Why? What's changed?",
        "Ford: This. A baby girl is missing. And that puts things in a whole new light.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: How can you be so nice to me, after everything I did to you?",
        "Markko: I think we can forget about that right now. Our friends need us. I'm going to go see Cole and I want you to come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: There was no reason to think that Starr and Hope wouldn't be safe. They had no real connection to Eli. You did.",
        "Hannah: I know, but...",
        "Marty: Hannah, you did nothing wrong.",
        "Hannah: You don't understand. Cole.",
        "Marty: Have you heard anything?",
        "Cole: No, they haven't found them.",
        "Marty: What happened to you?",
        "Cole: I got in a fight with James Ford.",
        "Marty: About what?",
        "Cole: Starr. When he helped Dani escape, he got Starr involved. I felt like that was...why...well, he's not the reason why they got kidnapped. That was Eli Clarke.",
        "Marty: I was just telling Hannah the same thing.",
        "Hannah: I'm going to go take a shower. Excuse me.",
        "[Marty sighs]",

        "Bo: Okay, John. Just stay on it.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Bo: Yeah?",
        "Inez: Sorry. I hate to interrupt you, but I had to thank you.",
        "Bo: For what?",
        "Inez: Well, you could have made an example of my boys. Thank you for not doing that.",
        "Bo: You're welcome. But I don't think I could punish them any more than they're punishing themselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Jessie, I hate that you have to go through this.",
        "Jessica: It's worse for Brody, but he's been so wonderful.",
        "Viki: Well, thank God for that. And that's good, honey, because I'm sure he knows that no matter who the father is, we're going to love this baby with everything we have.",
        "Jessica: That's what he keeps on saying.",
        "Clint: I'm going to head out. I will check back in with you later, though. Jessica, I love you.",
        "Viki: Clint--Clint... God knows I'm not defending Robert Ford, but I'm begging you, don't do anything foolish because that will only make matters worse.",
        "Clint: I'm not going to make anything worse.",
        "Jessica: Am I wrong, or is he headed straight to Robert Ford?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Don't get sentimental. You have no rights here. You gave those up a long time ago.",
        "Ford: I'm not staking any claims, I'm just concerned about what might--",
        "Brody: You don't get to be concerned. This is Jessica's baby, not yours. So put it out of your mind, permanently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You know, I could have you arrested. You're trespassing. And how did you ever get the gall to set foot in Llanview again?",
        "Echo: I didn't have the gall--not until now. I haven't set eyes on this place since Clint's trial.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Echo cut a deal with the prosecution. She promised to stay out of town. But less than a year later...",
        "Kelly: What's that?",
        "Rex: It's a speeding ticket issued by the L.P.D. Whatever brought her back here made her do it in a hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Get out.",
        "Echo: Oh, just relax. I'm only here to visit my old boyfriend.",
        "Dorian: Ugh...Clint?",
        "Echo: Chuckles.",
        "Dorian: \"Chuckles\"?",
        "Echo: Charlie--Charlie Banks.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well, I should probably check in on Viki. You sure you're going to be okay?",
        "Kelly: Yeah. I'll be better when the girls get back home, but thank you. Thank you for getting my mind off things for a while.",
        "Rex: Anytime.",
        "Kelly: Okay.",

        "Dorian: \"Chuckles\"?",
        "Echo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: Charlie Banks? Yes, indeed. Well, if you're hoping for a repeat performance from him, good luck with that. He's really quite devoted to Viki.",
        "Echo: I don't want Viki's husband. I want something else this time.",
        "Dorian: What?",
        "Echo: A job at \"The Banner.\" But Viki wouldn't give it to me. And that was a mistake.",
        "Dorian: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: When can you have the paternity test?",
        "Jessica: Soon. But I don't know if...",
        "Viki: Oh, honey--honey, honey... not knowing is going to be eating you up, you and Brody. Sweetheart, you and I both know what it is to live in denial--what that can do, okay? Please, have the paternity test as soon as possible.",
        "Jessica: And if the baby turns out to be Ford's?",
        "Viki: Well, then it turns out to be Ford's, but at least you will know it, you can accept it, and you can move on. Honey, we've already established that Brody's going to love the baby, no matter the D.N.A.",
        "Jessica: Like he loves Bree.",
        "Viki: Yes. And the way your father loves Kevin and Joey and you. Find out the truth, okay? After that, everything will fall into place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: I just wanted to tell you that I appreciate what you did. I didn't think it was possible to get my job back.",
        "Clint: Helps to have friends.",
        "Ford: Yeah, well, thank you. I won't forget it.",
        "Clint: I was just telling myself that, because there are some things you just never forget.",
        "Ford: Yeah. Well, thanks, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: God, I...I just want to go back to that police station and find out what's happening, but Bo told me I had to go.",
        "Marty: I know. Bo was right, but I'll tell you what, I'll give him a call in just a minute.",
        "Cole: Mom, what kind of person does this? How do you kidnap a little baby and her mother? Sometimes, I... sometimes, I feel like I can hear her cry. And a guy like that, he doesn't care if she's hungry...or tired or scared. And I'm sure Starr is scared, too, and I just feel so helpless.",
        "Marty: I know. It's okay, it's okay. Just try not to think that way, okay? It's going to be fine, it's going to be fine. Listen, I'll tell you what. I have to go to the office. I'm going to stop by and I'm going to talk to Bo, and I will call you as soon as I hear anything, okay? It's going to be okay. Okay, be right back, okay?",
        "Cole: Okay.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, I can come back another time.",
        "Viki: No, no, no. It's fine. If you're here, it must mean you found out something, right? And that in itself would be better news than anything else I've heard today.",
        "Rex: Okay. So it turns out Ms. DiSavoy wants everybody to think that this is her first trip back to Llanview since the trial.",
        "Viki: And it's not?",
        "Rex: No. After her...fling with Charlie, she came back. She was here a little less than a year after she left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: You thought Viki would give you a job, after what you did to her? You are delusional.",
        "Echo: Well, maybe. But I'm also very good. I could take a photograph of you and publish it that would have this whole town weeping. They'd be more than ready to tear that kidnapper apart with their bare hands.",
        "Dorian: You would exploit the carcass of my grief? You vulture! Get out of my house!",
        "Echo: You've got the wrong idea about me.",

        "Viki: I have absolutely no idea why she would have come back so soon or what she wanted.",
        "Rex: Well, don't worry. That's my job. There's no way I'm going to let her mess things up for you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So, of course, when I heard about your son's girlfriend, I knew right away why you didn't show up at Rodi's last night.",
        "Inez: I'm sorry. I wish I could have been there to thank you for what you did for Bobby.",
        "Clint: Well, Bobby thanked me himself.",
        "Inez: Well, he can do a lot better than that. I am sure that there's some way he can repay you.",
        "Clint: Well, don't worry about it. I'll think of something.",

        "Brody: Hey, I got your message. Are you okay?",
        "Jessica: I am fine. I'm sorry, I just--I'm--I made a decision and I wanted to let you know about it right away.",
        "Brody: What's going on?",
        "Jessica: I'm going to have the paternity test.",
        "Brody: Jess, we don't have to do that. You know how I feel.",
        "Jessica: I know you're going to love this baby, no matter what. I know that. But I also know that the truth matters. And, you know, not finding out feels a little like running away. And we're better than that, both of us.",
        "Brody: You're right. We need to know. And if Ford's the father, I will make my peace with that so I can start making this baby mine in every way that counts.",

        "Ford: Um, I just wanted to see if you're okay after what happened with Starr and Hope. But looks like you're in good hands. That's all I needed to know.",
