        "Jessica: Delphina, what are you doing here?",
        "Delphina: You rang.",
        "Jessica: Well, I hung up before it even went to voice mail. How did you know it was me?",
        "Delphina: I know, right? Isn't technology, like, amazing? I have this new thing on my phone -- caller I.D.? So what's up? Ghost of Nash still rattling your windows?",
        "Jessica: No. Actually, I wanted to give you a piece of my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Why'd you get into it with Gigi like that? She's got enough problems with Rex as it is. And besides that, what'd she ever do to you, Kim?",
        "Stacy: What are you guys talking about?",
        "Kim: Gigi's hot for Schuyler.",
        "Schuyler: Stop saying that.",
        "Kim: You know I'm right. You should've seen it. Gigi threw a total hissy fit.",
        "Stacy: Really? Why?",
        "Kim: Because me and Schuy went out on a date. Gigi saw us and she lost it.",
        "Stacy: Ha ha ha! So you gonna make a play for Gigi, huh?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Sit back and watch your sister's relationship crash and...",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, that's -- yeah, that's it. That's exactly what you want, isn't it? For me to go after Gigi so you can go after Rex?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Talk to me, Morasco, and be honest.",
        "Gigi: About what?",
        "Rex: When we were at the movies the other night, you were so busy watching Kim and Schuyler that you barely saw anything on the screen. And then when I walked in there tonight, you were really letting Kim have it.",
        "Gigi: She's annoying.",
        "Rex: Why? Because she's going out with Schuyler?",
        "Gigi: No. Rex, don't make something out of nothing.",
        "Rex: Do you think I want to? This keeps coming up.",
        "Gigi: What do you want me to say?",
        "Rex: Admit it -- you're jealous that Kim's with Schuyler.",
        "Gigi: Okay, fine! I'm jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How could you do that to me?",
        "Delphina: I beg your pardon?",
        "Jessica: I didn't even want to go see you in the first place. And you made me think that Nash's ghost was with me, and he wasn't. You know who was? A stalker: Some creep that was after my family, some ex-con named Wayne Landers.",
        "Delphina: You know, I didn't say you were seeing the ghost of Nash. What I said was Nash was trying to get a message to you. And he still is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Well? Can I see my husband?",
        "Officer: No. The suspect is...",
        "Natalie: Don't call him a suspect.",
        "Jared: They're releasing me.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, the police finally accepted the truth that Jared had nothing to do with Landers' death.",
        "Jared: Natalie, I've been lying to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: All right, Ross, here's the deal. The only thing standing between me and a certain briefcase is a man in blue. I know you want to find out where T\u00e9a stashed your kid, and I'm gonna do my best to help. But I need you to do me a favor, too: Turn yourself in ASAP. And try not to get into any more trouble, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Ohh --",
        "Blair: Why did you do that?",
        "Dorian: Yes, that was awful.",
        "Oliver: I'm sorry. I had to.",
        "Ross: It's gonna take more than a Taser shot to keep me down.",
        "Oliver: Ugh! Okay, how about two?",
        "Ross: Aah! Aah! Oh, make it stop! Make -- aah! Ohh! Aah!",
        "Blair: Ooh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Hi. Oh, I assumed you'd -- you'd be at the hospital with, um, with Blair.",
        "Todd: No. I came to check on the boys, then I'm going right back to the hospital.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, okay. Well, I just -- I just came to get my things.",
        "Todd: No. You know what? I'm packing them, and I'm gonna send them to you. So don't worry about it.",
        "Jack: Wait! I want to talk to her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, sure, Jack. Uh, what is it?",
        "Jack: Did you push my mom out that window?",
        "T\u00e9a: You know me pretty well, Jack. Do you -- do you really think that I would do something like that?",
        "Jack: Well, you're fierce and you hate my mom, but no. No way. You wouldn't do that on purpose.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thanks. You know, it was an -- it was an accident, and, um, your mom's gonna be okay. She's gonna be all right. And, um, and I'm really -- I'm really glad about that. Because -- because I know how much you care about her, and I -- I would never do anything to hurt her.",
        "Jack: You swear?",
        "T\u00e9a: I swear. I -- I swear to you. I know how much a mother can love her kid.",
        "Todd: How would you know that?",
        "T\u00e9a: How do I know what it's like to love a child? I have one.",
        "Jack: Dad, give it a rest.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, Jack? If you listen to this right here, you'll know that I love you. Okay? I'll always love you. And -- and you have faith that I'm never gonna lie to you. Okay?",
        "Jack: I have another question.",
        "T\u00e9a: Sure.",
        "Jack: Are you still gonna be our stepmom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, my God. Is he okay?",
        "Ross: I'm -- I'm -- well, my brain's a little scrambled. That just means you and me are on the same wavelength.",
        "Dorian: Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Amelia: Excuse me. We're looking for Dorian Lord.",
        "David: I'm her ex-husband.",
        "Amelia: And I am her future wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: What are you doing?",
        "Elijah: Oh. Do you think this is real leather? It's nice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Okay, let's get you out of here, because we need some alone time.",
        "Viki: Honey, wait. There are forms to fill out.",
        "Charlie: Yes. And then we'll be free and clear and be able to put this mess behind us.",
        "Jared: Well, not exactly, Dad. They're releasing me because they don't have enough evidence to charge me with murder.",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "Jared: Yeah. I can't leave town. I'm still a suspect.",
        "Charlie: Well, shouldn't they be looking for the murderer? What do they want? You've already told them everything you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So Nash is still trying to send me a message?",
        "Brody: What's going on?",
        "Jessica: Hey, Brody. This is Delphina, the psychic.",
        "Brody: Oh, I know who she is. You know, I should take you in for fraud.",
        "Delphina: Ha! Go ahead. I've solved 247 cases for the Llanview P.D. And what, may I ask, is your record after 30 days and one hour on the force? \"Oh, my God! How could she know that?\" Psychic. It's what I do. So I suggest you two listen up. Because I'm getting a message -- uh-huh -- right now, loud and clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You're just relentless, aren't you? That's what this is about, isn't it? Your friend is all into dating me out of the blue? I don't think so. That was for Gigi. And she takes the bait -- me -- and that leaves Rex for you to pursue. You set me up.",
        "Kim: I'd say we did you a favor. I mean, now you know Gigi's totally into you.",
        "Stacy: And by now Rex should know, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You admit it? You're jealous?",
        "Gigi: Yes. But that doesn't mean that I want to be with him. It's not about that.",
        "Rex: What is it about?",
        "Gigi: Schuyler's had some rough times in his past. Last thing he needs is to be hooked up with the wrong person. And Kim -- she's totally sketchy. So, yeah, it makes me a little crazy. I am worried about him as a friend.",
        "Rex: Worrying about a friend is not jealousy, Morasco. Protecting a friend, missing a friend, is not jealousy. You only are jealous if you have feelings for somebody.",
        "Gigi: I don't need a lecture on jealousy. Been there, done that. Remember Stacy?",
        "Rex: Let's not get into all that!",
        "Gigi: Yes, let's! While you two were busy playing house, I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I had a headache 24/7. And every time I saw her, I wanted to rip her face off!",
        "Rex: Is that what you want to do Kim, seeing her with Schuyler?",
        "Gigi: No!",
        "Rex: You said you were jealous.",
        "Gigi: It's not the same!",
        "Rex: Okay. Tell me how.",
        "Gigi: I can't.",
        "Rex: No, wrong answer!",
        "Gigi: Well, it'll have to do! You asked me, I told you the truth! We've had enough lies in this relationship!",
        "Rex: Okay. Answer me this. Do you have feelings for Schuyler Joplin?",
        "Gigi: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: You did me a favor? You used me.",
        "Stacy: It's for a good cause, okay? You just don't see it yet.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, you two should run for freaking office.",
        "Kim: We're just keeping it real.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, you're keeping it real. You're keeping it real psycho! Stacy, you need to get over the Rex thing, okay? He does not want you. Move on!",
        "Kim: That's so mean.",
        "Schuyler: You know what, Kim? Gigi warned me about you. \"Why -- why would anyone want to go out with that girl?\" That's what she said.",
        "Stacy: Ooh, snap.",
        "Schuyler: It's not every day that a beautiful girl asks me out.",
        "Kim: Thanks.",
        "Schuyler: It felt real good. And then I realized it's all part of the plan.",
        "Stacy: Oh, boo-hoo! Get over yourself. You're missing the whole point: Gigi is jealous, and Rex is mad. If you mess this chance up, you're a damn fool!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: This is ridiculous. What is she doing here?",
        "Delphina: Stay close to Jessica. Use your peripheral vision. Look both ways, especially behind you.",
        "Brody: What -- what does that mean?",
        "Jessica: Oh, what -- does that mean someone's here? Someone's following us? Or are you talking about the past?",
        "Delphina: Yeah, I really don't deconstruct these messages, just deliver them.",
        "Brody: Oh, Jessica, don't listen to this crap.",
        "Delphina: You know, you, sir, are not the first person to doubt me, and you won't be the last. But I have been doing this since your sister Nadine was -- really? Huh! I've been doing this since your sister Nadine was hiding your baby bottle. So a little respect. Thank you. Uh-huh. Got it. The person who killed Wayne Landers is going to kill again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, listen, I'm gonna stop by the hospital and see if Blair's all right. Unless you need me at home?",
        "Natalie: No, no, no. We're fine. Thank you.",
        "Charlie: Son, catch you later.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Okay. You go on ahead, okay? I'll see you at home. You know, I have to say I -- I feel sorry for Dorian. I mean, I know she must be worried sick about Blair.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, it's a good thing she's got her fianc\u00e9e there with her to hold her hand.",
        "Viki: Almost forgot -- Dorian's a lesbian now.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Well, I sure didn't see that one coming.",
        "Viki: No. Neither did the men in her life, especially David Vickers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Who are you here to see?",
        "David: My ex-wife's niece.",
        "Amelia: My partner's niece: Blair Cramer.",
        "Nurse: She has visitors. Two more will be too many. You're gonna have to wait.",
        "Amelia: Word to the wise, don't try to elbow me out. You're the ex, I'm the lover. Got it?",
        "David: And Dorian's the pawn.",
        "Amelia: Dorian is no one's pawn. This was her idea. She's the one that announced the engagement, not me. Look. There's a good place to hand out fliers while we wait.",
        "David: Is that all you're interested in: Getting Dorian elected?",
        "Amelia: If it means that I get the same rights as you, straight man, then yes. When you care about something, you fight for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Are you and my dad splitting up?",
        "T\u00e9a: Um, listen. It's -- it's time for you to go to bed, so that's what you need to do. And think good thoughts about your mom, okay? All right?",
        "Todd: Why don't you go see if your brother's up there, okay?",
        "Jack: He's sleeping.",
        "Todd: Yeah. Please, Jack?",
        "Jack: Okay, okay. I'll get lost.",
        "T\u00e9a: So is this how it's gonna be?",
        "Todd: Is this how it's gonna be? Yeah, I guess so.",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh-huh. We had, what, 48 hours of marriage? There's real -- there's real love here, Todd. We were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.",
        "Todd: Yeah, until I found out who you really were.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, that -- you don't -- that is not -- that is not true.",
        "Blair: That's the big secret. And Todd has to know it.",
        "T\u00e9a: You don't make it easy to be honest with you. You know that?",
        "Todd: So your lying was my fault? Is that right?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I didn't say that. Your unwillingness to forgive, your lack of empathy, the way you hold onto things -- it's the reason I didn't tell you in the first place. And if things are really truly over between us, then I guess there's no reason to tell you anything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: This isn't a game, guys. Yeah, I do feel something for Gigi, okay? Something strong. Obviously I shouldn't. Obviously I can't live my life chasing after something I can't have. And that's why I figured if I went out, if I had a date, then maybe it would help me move on.",
        "Stacy: Talk about ulterior motives.",
        "Kim: I've been out with guys for way worse reasons. Anyways, now's your chance to get Gigi.",
        "Schuyler: No, it's not.",
        "Stacy: Why?",
        "Schuyler: Because it doesn't matter what I feel for Gigi. She doesn't have feelings for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You have feelings for Schuyler? You are attracted to him?",
        "Gigi: No. I don't know.",
        "Rex: I do! I -- I knew it! The minute that you started spending all that time with him --",
        "Gigi: He was helping me! He was being a good friend.",
        "Rex: Until he kissed you. Why did he think he could kiss you? And don't say you don't know.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God. What do you think, Rex? I willed him to kiss me? I didn't want Schuyler!",
        "Rex: \"Didn't want\": Past tense. But you do now?",
        "Gigi: Rex --",
        "Rex: You told me to back off of Schuyler, so I did. I figured, \"Rex, you're being a jerk. They're just BFFs. So what that he has the hots for her? Let it go.\" I am, like, the biggest moron...",
        "Gigi: You're not! Can we just drop this? I don't even know why these feelings are coming up.",
        "Rex: So -- so you are attracted to him.",
        "Gigi: No more than you're attracted to Stacy.",
        "Rex: I'm not!",
        "Gigi: Is that why you slept with her?",
        "Rex: That was once because I thought you broke up with me.",
        "Gigi: So you rebound with my sister?!",
        "Rex: Gigi, you and I are together now. At least, we're supposed to be. But somehow the woman I love has a thing for another guy. That's a huge problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Whoa. Ross, you all right?",
        "Ross: Yeah. Huh. Ow -- okay.",
        "Elijah: Easy. Easy.",
        "Ross: Yeah. No thanks to trigger-happy Johnny law over here.",
        "Elijah: What do you mean? He took a shot at you?",
        "Ross: No. He Tased me, twice.",
        "Elijah: Really? Well, that's police brutality. Excellent work, officer fish. I'm gonna put that at the top of the list of charges against you and the LPD.",
        "Oliver: Oh, yeah?",
        "Elijah: Yeah.",
        "Oliver: You want to know what's on your client's list? Assault against a police officer, resisting arrest.",
        "Elijah: Okay, I just need a quick word with my client.",
        "Oliver: Oh, be my guest. It's not like he is going anywhere.",
        "Elijah: What the hell were you thinking? Brilliant stunt, Ross, escaping. Real smart.",
        "Ross: I needed to find out if Blair was all right.",
        "Elijah: Well, now it's gonna be twice as difficult for me to get you off.",
        "Ross: Oh, please. You're good. You'll figure it out. But right now we got to... [Whispering] We got to get into that briefcase.",
        "Elijah: I know. I thought about stealing it.",
        "Ross: Oh. I like that.",
        "Elijah: I don't. Besides, I could end up behind bars. Trust me, you're not gonna find a better lawyer.",
        "Ross: Why don't we just snap it open, you know, pull out what we need?",
        "Elijah: How do you propose we do that?",
        "Ross: I don't know, Elijah. Just create a diversion, grab a gun, blast it open. That's -- I'm kidding. Look, T\u00e9a has information about my kid in that briefcase. I -- I'm sure of it.",
        "Elijah: Can't do it.",
        "Ross: Like hell. We got to come up with something, Elij. Come on. You can't keep a child away from its father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know what? Save it. Whatever it is you don't want to tell me I don't want to hear.",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course you don't want to hear it. How could you possibly understand that I needed to -- ohh -- protect myself from getting hurt again?",
        "Todd: Of course. It's all about you, isn't it? You could give a damn about anyone else.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what? I'm gonna go get my things whether you like it or not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Where's my briefcase?",
        "Todd: What briefcase?",
        "T\u00e9a: My briefcase -- it was here yesterday. It's gone. I -- where is it?",
        "Todd: I -- beats me.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it's got to be here somewhere.",
        "Todd: Well, okay, listen. If I find it, I'll pack it with everything else.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I need it. I need it. I -- there are important things in there. I need it -- I need it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You think our problem is Schuyler? Please. We have way bigger problems.",
        "Rex: Like what?",
        "Gigi: Stacy.",
        "Rex: Stop making this about Stacy.",
        "Gigi: Says the man who's having a baby with her.",
        "Rex: That's not fair. What does that have to do with you and Schuyler?",
        "Gigi: Because Stacy and that damn baby are on my mind 24/7! I've tried so hard to accept it. I've done a pretty good job. But you know what? I can't! I'm so mad at you!",
        "Rex: No kidding.",
        "Gigi: But then wait. It's all my fault. I let Stacy manipulate me into breaking up with you. You probably never would've slept with her if I hadn't.",
        "Rex: Probably I never would have.",
        "Gigi: But you did, and it makes me sick! And now you're having a baby, so it'll never go away!",
        "Rex: So let's talk about it.",
        "Gigi: You never want to talk about it! That's why I spend time with Schuyler, because he talks me down when I'm afraid I'm about to lose it. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry if that hurts you. But it's not fair for you to put words in my mouth, saying that I'm attracted to Schuyler, when I just --",
        "Rex: When you just what?",
        "Gigi: I need him. Okay? I just -- I just need him.",
        "Rex: For what?",

        "Todd: Are you making that up?",
        "Jack: No. And me and Noelle hogtied him up. And then she called the cops.",

        "Ross: I can't. There's information about my kid in there. I know it.",
        "Oliver: Okay, private time's up. He still needs to be questioned. What were you doing in Todd Nanning's home?",
        "Elijah: Oh, you don't have to answer that.",
        "Ross: Oh. Well, I won't, then.",
        "Oliver: Okay, fine. Let's talk about the new charges: Escaping arrest, assaulting a police officer. What were you doing in Llanview Hospital? And what exactly is your relationship with Blair Cramer?",

        "Jessica: Well, are you getting one now?",

        "Schuyler: No.",
        "Stacy: Look, we already got the ball rolling. All you have to do is go out with Kim a couple more times on some dates.",
        "Kim: And if Gigi sees us making out, it'll seal the deal.",
        "Schuyler: Oh -- oh, thank you so much, but -- but I'll pass. If you guys want to ruin Rex and Gigi's relationship, you find somebody else to play offense.",
        "Stacy: Ew! What happened to you? You used to be a bad boy.",
        "Schuyler: I'm sorry. Do you mean \"drug addict\"?",
        "Stacy: Okay, that, too.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, Stacy, I was high all the time.",
        "Stacy: Not always. But you definitely were okay with stealing girls from other guys. It's how you snagged me, remember?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, and look how that worked out.",
        "Stacy: Hey, I've got no hard feelings. I loved the fact that you chased after me even though I was taken. It felt good to have that kind of attention.",
        "Kim: Gigi's sure loving it.",
        "Schuyler: Well, you -- well, gosh darn it, you guys just have it all figure out, don't you? But here's a problem. Regardless of how I feel for Gigi or she may or may not feel for me, Rex will never want you, Stacy.",

        "Gigi: So, what, you want to take a break?",
        "Rex: No. But you need to figure out what the hell is going on.",
        "Gigi: What about Shane? One minute we're a couple, the next we're breaking up. It's not fair to him. It's confusing.",

        "Gigi: Yeah, it's a huge mess, and we made it together. But we are not going to sort it out by walking away. I wish I could just fix everything right now, that I knew what was going with me. All I know is that we belong together, that no matter how bad it gets, it's better if we have each other. I love you, Rex, with all of my heart. I still believe in us. Do you?",

        "Jared: Pretty much. Yeah.",
        "Charlie: We'll let Natalie take it from here, and...I never stopped believing in you. Not for a minute.",
        "Jessica: Well, uh, we should go check on Bree. Yeah.",

        "Jared: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'd rather be free and clear, but I'll take it.",

        "Todd: Yeah, I know. It scared me, too. But your mom's gonna be just fine, okay?",
        "Jack: Are you gonna take care of her like you took care of T\u00e9a when she was hurt?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Fortunately, your mom wasn't hurt that bad.",

        "Blair: Wait a minute. Is this -- is this what John wanted to tell me and you didn't want me to know?",
        "Dorian: Absolutely not. Um, no. That was something else entirely. I -- I wanted to wait to tell you about this until we were at home, and tell you in a more private and gentle fashion. You see, Viki, this is what it's like when families come out to each other.",
        "Viki: So it seems. Anyway, I came to see Blair.",
        "Dorian: Of course. Of course. We'll just give you some time to visit. Come, everybody. Why, thank you, David.",
        "David: Yes.",

        "Blair: Actually, I'm not too bad.",
        "Viki: Which is miraculous in and of itself.",
        "Blair: Yeah. I just, um, got this big empty space in the middle of my head.",
        "Viki: You mean you have memory loss?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I can't remember what happened right before I fell.",
        "Viki: Well, you and T\u00e9a were fighting. Todd told me that. Apparently you had found out that T\u00e9a was already married?",
        "Blair: Yeah. But, Viki, it's -- I think it's more than the fight, and that's where it gets all fuzzy. It was something big. And I just know it was something that was gonna have a real big impact on Todd, would've changed his life.",

        "Officer: I'm taking this to the evidence room.",
        "Elijah: Wait, wait, wait.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's mine. Give it to me.",
        "Oliver: Yes, it does belong to Ms. Delgado. Raymond here took it from her house.",
        "T\u00e9a: \"Raymond\"? That's some skillful police work there, Officer Fish. Try Rayburn: Ross Rayburn. Look it up. You'll find a host of outstanding charges, including kidnapping.",
        "Elijah: You want to talk kidnapping? Okay. You're the expert. Let's start with what you did, Ms. Delgado.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Don't you worry about me and Rex. I'm a little better at handling men than you are.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, that's interesting. By \"handle,\" do you mean getting yourself pregnant?",
        "Stacy: Ooh.",
        "Schuyler: Because you know that's the only reason he pays attention to you these days.",
        "Stacy: I have other ways to make him come around.",
        "Schuyler: Huh. Whatever. Are we done, guys?",
        "Kim: Why so crabby? Something we say hit a nurse?",
        "[Stacy giggles]",
        "Kim: Come on, Stace. Let's leave Romeo here to wonder wherefore he left his balls.",
        "Stacy: Ha ha! That's good. Ha!",
        "Kim: Whenever you're ready to make a move on Gigi, let us know.",
        "Stacy: Think we got him?",
        "Kim: Depends on how much he wants Gigi. I'm thinking a lot.",
        "Stacy: Ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Damn it, Morasco, I love you. Of course I don't want to leave.",
        "Gigi: Neither do I. We love each other, Balsom. That is the most important thing. We'll work this out. We will.",
        "Rex: I know.",

        "Jack: Well? What's the deal?",
        "Todd: The deal is we want your mom to get better so she can come home. And that's the only thing you need to be thinking about right now.",
        "Jack: T\u00e9a said the same thing, only you said it more lame.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a was right, at least about that. You need to keep thinking good thoughts. Keep thinking you want your mom to come home. You want that, right? That's the only thing that matters right now. That's the only thing I'm gonna focus on: The mother of my kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I just wish I could remember what T\u00e9a was saying.",

        "Viki: Oh, honey, you look tired. I'll let you get some sleep, okay?",
        "Blair: Okay. Thanks for stopping by. I mean, you're my one sane moment in this crazy day.",

        "Amelia: We need to talk, Dorian, figure out a strategy.",
        "Dorian: Indeed. But right now, I'm tending to my niece.",
        "Amelia: And when the press come calling, we did this for a reason.",
        "Dorian: Tell me something I don't know. Just give me the bullet points.",
        "Amelia: Okay, we can go over all that later. I'll handle the press.",
        "David: We will handle the press.",
        "Amelia: The point being they'll want to see Dorian.",
        "Dorian: And you'll warm them up for me. Won't you, darling?",
        "Amelia: Of course.",
        "David: I'm \"darling.\"",

        "Viki: Well, it's nice to see you in such a nice, healthy relationship. Perhaps my first act as mayor will be to marry you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, what a shame you won't have that chance. Because you're gonna lose.",
        "David: Well...",
        "Viki: David?",

        "David: No. It was all Dorian's...",
        "Viki: Uh-huh.",
        "David: Unbridled passion for that woman. You know, Viki, there's a saying that goes, \"love conquers all.\" When people aren't getting along, they just need to remember that they love each other, and that's why we have love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So why don't you tell me when you suddenly started batting for the other team?",
        "Dorian: Honey, you need some sleep. And you need to get that memory back.",
        "Blair: Listen, it's just -- I want to remember. It's just a little muddy here. And I know it's something big, something that would impact Todd's life. I just don't know what it is.",
        "Dorian: Well, maybe you'll dream about it.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Maybe.",

        "Elijah: Well, T\u00e9a, you're the one who brought up kidnapping. Let's begin with the time that you...",
        "Ross: People, people, enough with the kidnapping. Um, Counselor, can -- excuse me. Elij, not -- drop it. Drop it. I don't want anyone else looking into this. T\u00e9a will find out, and she's liable to move my kid to another location.",
        "Elijah: You're right. You're right. If she does that, we're sunk.",
        "Ross: Right. Or she'll make up with Todd and get him to do it. He's got the money and the resources. No, our only hope... [Whispering] That briefcase.",

        "T\u00e9a: Why should I? You have tons of reasons to hold him. Breaking and entering...",
        "Oliver: Escaping police custody, assault. But are you sure you don't want to add theft to the list?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I'm sure. I'm feeling very magnanimous today. Come on.",
        "Oliver: Uh, okay. Here you go.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you so much.",
        "Oliver: All right, time to go to your cell.",

        "Brody: Well, give me a minute. \"The messages are coming. I'll need to listen to another dimension.\"",
        "Jessica: Stop it. Stop it. Just tell me what you really think.",
        "Brody: All right, look. Part of my getting better, dealing with my PTSD, was learning to see what's really there. Nothing more.",
