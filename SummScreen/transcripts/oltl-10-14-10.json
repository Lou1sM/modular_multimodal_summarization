        "Eli has kidnapped Dani and Tea and has them in separate rooms in an old abandoned warehouse whether neither is aware that he has taken the other. He calls Todd and Blair and can confirm that Dani is alive. But he has known how to prevent the cops from tracing the call to know where they are. And Dani tells them that she doesn't know where Starr and Hope are. She assumes that they've escaped. But everybody is worried that they are nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, we see Starr awakening on the floor of an unfamiliar house and baby Hope with her. She hasn't a clue where she is but finds out it's Hannah's parents' home. She then recalls that the last thing she remembered before being knocked out was Hannah coming to find her and preventing her from leaving the hospital with her baby because Hannah resents the fact that people care about Starr and that Starr is with Cole. Hannah returns to Marty's home and neither Marty nor Cole suspect anything about her. Langston and Markko come by and both admit that they do not trust Hannah although they are not aware of what she did to Starr. Starr finds a heavy instrument and is ready to bust her way out of the place and escape. But Hannah appears with a gun to prevent her. Dani is stuck in the place where Eli has taken her. She knows that \"somebody\" is in the other room and assumes it's Starr and Hope. Tea still does not suspect Eli but is still too weak to escape and cannot reach Todd or Dani by phone."

        "Blair: Thanks so much. Mama and the boys arrived safe.",
        "Todd: Security was there?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Met them at the gate.",
        "Todd: They're far enough into the mountains. They should be safe.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Todd: I wish you were with them.",
        "Blair: I'm not going anywhere until Dani, Starr, and Hope are home safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Run that plate now. McBain thinks he might've spotted Starr Manning's car.",
        "John: It's definitely Starr Manning's car.",
        "Price: Yeah. Want to get a closer look?",
        "John: Yeah. Let's go in easy. The girls could still be in there.",
        "Price: All right.",

        "Nora: Hey, Natalie. Why are you reading this?",
        "Natalie: Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent: Mr. Manning, the GPS in the girls' phones has been disabled.",
        "Todd: How did Clarke manage that?",
        "Agent: He must have some expertise.",
        "Todd: Okay. So what do we do, just wait for the call?",
        "Agent: We're set up to record and try to trace.",
        "Todd: \"Try to trace\"?",
        "Blair: Why hasn't he called? He hasn't even called yet!",
        "Agent: We don't know why he hasn't.",
        "Blair: Oh, no. This is a really bad sign, Todd. Something's wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I have to tell you.",
        "Cole: Tell me what?",
        "Hannah: What really happened to Starr and Hope.",
        "Cole: What do you mean? Do you know something about where they are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hope: Mommy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I was talking to Greg Evans at the hospital last night.",
        "Nora: He's awake? Oh, and talking--that's a good thing.",
        "Natalie: I would say barely conscious for a few minutes, but he said T\u00e9a's name.",
        "Nora: Natalie, that's not surprising. T\u00e9a was one of his patients, and he doesn't lose many of them, so I'm sure it was hard for him.",
        "Natalie: I know, but he didn't just say T\u00e9a's name.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Mom? Mom? Oh, my God. Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What else did Greg Evans say?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. He could've been delirious. It's--",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Bo: Hey, Red.",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Bo: John found Starr's vehicle.",
        "Nora: Oh. Were the girls inside?",
        "Bo: No, the car's empty, but from what they what they could see, there's a lot of evidence inside. I need you to work the scene, see if you can help piece together what happened in the car, get an idea where they could be.",
        "Natalie: All right. On my way.",
        "Bo: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dani gasps]",
        "Eli: You trying to ditch me? That's not the exit, by the way.",
        "Dani: Where are we?",
        "Eli: Abandoned warehouse--ooh-- in a mostly forgotten corner of our fine Commonwealth. I don't know what they used to do here, but they sure did like it quiet. These walls are very thick, and a little short on windows, too. We trade our comfort for safety. Oh, what are you gonna do?",
        "Dani: Just take me home. That'd be good.",
        "Eli: Oh, it definitely would be. I'm working on that. Meanwhile, sit down. Sit. Oh, come on, now! Yeah, yeah, look who's got his strength back. That medicine you stole made me feel like a new man.",
        "Dani: Not quite.",
        "Eli: Listen, I am awake, I am armed, and I don't appreciate the attitude. Okay? Bear that in mind. If you want to go home, don't be stupid!",
        "Dani: The cops aren't gonna like a bruised hostage, Eli. You better watch yourself.",
        "Eli: The cops are gonna have nothing to do with this.",
        "Dani: Oh, you don't think so?",
        "Eli: No.",
        "Dani: Starr and Hope are probably home by now, and Starr will lead the cops straight to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hannah, if you know something about where Starr is-- look at me--please spit it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole. Uh. Hope? Honey? Ohh, was Mommy asleep? Huh? Were you scared? Oh. You're hungry? Me, too. How did we get here?",
        "[Hope coughs]",
        "Starr: You okay? Hello? Hello?! Anyone there?! Help! Where are we?",
        "Starr: \"Hannah O'Connor\"? No.",
        "Starr: Hannah?",
        "Hannah: Sorry. Cole couldn't make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: I do know something about Starr and Hope.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Hannah: You were so upset yesterday when you found out that they were missing, and you still are. Seeing how important they are to you--I knew. But seeing it...",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Cole: This better be good news.",
        "Langston: Hey, Cole, what happened to your face?",
        "Cole: Nothing. So any news?",
        "Langston: No.",
        "Markko: How you holding up?",
        "Cole: But your dad's better, right? Shouldn't you be at UCLA?",
        "Markko: I'm not going anywhere until Starr and Hope are back.",
        "Cole: Thanks, man. You guys, come on in.",
        "Markko: The least we can do is keep you company while--",
        "Langston: Hey, Hannah. Are we interrupting something?",
        "Cole: No. Hannah was just gonna tell me something about Starr.",
        "Hannah: Not really. Just that I think everything will work out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Hope, hey. You said you were hungry, right? Um, ah. I have something in here for you. Look, sweetie. I have your favorite. You want some? There you go. Mommy's gonna look for an aspirin. Oh, I'd be really happy with aspirin right now. Look, honey, I don't know how we got here, but I know that some crazy, crazy girl did it, and don't you worry. I'm gonna get us out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There could be a million reasons why Eli hasn't called yet.",
        "Blair: Maybe he's dead.",
        "Todd: That'd be good news, wouldn't it?",
        "Blair: It wouldn't be good news. What if he has the girls somewhere trapped, they're alone, and we can't find them?",
        "Todd: No, Eli's not that dumb, and he's not dead.",
        "Blair: You don't know that. He was shot. He could've bled to death.",
        "Todd: No. McBain saw him driving a car yesterday.",
        "Blair: He's wounded, and he is out of his mind.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. Being crazy doesn't even slow him down. He'll call. Don't worry.",
        "Blair: How can you be so sure, Todd?",
        "Todd: Because he wants us to sweat. He figures the longer we wait the more money he gets. He's a lawyer, right? He'll probably bill me by the hour.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You want to go home? You do exactly what Uncle Eli tells you to do. Understand?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Even you can't make me laugh today.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Todd: Ready?",
        "Agent: Answer it.",
        "[Ring]",
        "Todd: This is Todd Manning.",
        "Eli: Todd. What's up? Did you miss me?",
        "Todd: Actually, I was just hoping you were dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hey.",
        "John: You ever seen this?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. That's Starr's. That's Hope's birthstone on the charm, and there's room for more charms for more children. John, can you imagine how Cole must be feeling right now, and Todd and Blair?",
        "John: Yeah, I can. Pack it. Price?",
        "Price: Yeah?",
        "John: You're staying here. You're working the scene with Natalie.",
        "Natalie: What do you have so far?",
        "John: What do I got? I got a lot of blood on the front seat. I got a lot of blood in the back seat. It could be Clarke's.",
        "Natalie: All right, I'll sample and type it all, try to rule out Starr and Dani and Hope.",
        "John: Something else?",
        "Natalie: I'm not sure, but...",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Natalie: At the hospital last night--",
        "John: Excuse me. McBain. Yeah? When? Okay, good. I'm on my way. Clarke just made contact.",
        "Natalie: Just now?",
        "John: Yep. All right, I got to get out of here. I got to head back. What was that thing about the hospital?",
        "Natalie: It can wait. Just go.",
        "John: Okay. With any luck, we'll be bringing those girls home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: From what John could see through the window, there may have been a struggle.",
        "Nora: Or someone just trying to calm a toddler that's trapped inside a car. God, what Hope must be--",
        "Bo: No, no. Stop. Stop. Don't. We've just got to get them home.",
        "Nora: Okay. You did great at the press conference. The hotline's been ringing off the hook.",
        "Bo: Let's hope. Why was Natalie looking at T\u00e9a Delgado's obituary?",
        "Nora: I don't know. It was something Greg Evans said when he woke up yesterday at the hospital to her. I don't know. It's obviously not as important as what she's doing right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Price: That's the fifth bandage.",
        "Natalie: And there's blister packs from medication. Wrappers, fibers, blood everywhere. Let's check the trunk.",
        "Price: Looks pretty clean.",
        "Natalie: Yeah? Wow. The front of the car looks like a typical mom's car, with toys and books everywhere, but the trunk-- it's empty, clean.",
        "Price: Yeah, that's way too clean.",
        "Natalie: Wait a sec. I think they did leave something.",
        "Price: What you got?",
        "Natalie: Here. Can you open that?",
        "Price: Sure.",
        "Natalie: All right. That will tell us if there was anything in this trunk.",
        "Price: What about the blood?",
        "Natalie: I took samples from every part of the car. The heaviest blood was in the driver's seat.",
        "Price: You think Eli was bleeding out?",
        "Natalie: I can't say for sure, but he couldn't have gotten far on foot.",
        "Price: He probably stole another car when he dumped this one.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. I guess he couldn't keep this one after John saw it.",
        "Price: Then I must've just missed him last night myself, because I went to Cherryvale. I went to go check out Evans' connection to see if it had anything to do with the car.",
        "Natalie: Did it?",
        "Price: Well, no, but he--Evans had a female patient there.",
        "Natalie: Did you see this patient?",
        "Price: No. I went to go see her, and they called me and said that Evans was awake, so I went to go question him.",
        "Natalie: What did he tell you?",
        "Price: Nothing. He was out by the time I got there. But the reports--he didn't make much sense.",
        "Natalie: I saw Greg last night.",
        "Price: You did?",
        "Natalie: When he was awake.",
        "Price: Did he say anything coherent?",
        "Natalie: He told me that T\u00e9a Delgado is still alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Ohh.",
        "T\u00e9a: What's happening to me?",
        "Todd: Let me talk to my daughters.",
        "Eli: \"Daughters\"?",
        "Todd: Yes, the innocent girls you kidnapped. Put Starr and Dani on the phone right now.",
        "Eli: Interesting.",
        "Todd: I want to hear Starr's voice right now. Put her on the phone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay. Here. Well, that window is too high for us to reach. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hope. This is all mommy's fault. I shouldn't have trusted Hannah, even for a second.",
        "Starr: Where's Cole? You said that you were going to get him.",
        "Hannah: I looked for him, but I couldn't find him. And he left his phone at home, remember?",
        "Hope: Mommy?",
        "Hannah: So I came instead.",
        "Starr: Okay. That's all right. Then we got to go now. I'm going to get you back to daddy, sweetie, and then mommy's gonna go look for Aunt Dani. I bet you daddy cannot wait--",
        "Hannah: Wait here. You're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: So do you guys want a soda or something?",
        "Cole: No. That's okay.",
        "Hannah: It's no trouble. I'll--",
        "Markko: Dude, what's up with Hannah? Did she follow you here?",
        "Langston: She lives here now, right? It's a long story. But it feels a little creepy having her hang around now, doesn't it?",
        "Cole: No. It's cool. She's actually been great. I mean, I could use all the friends I can get right now.",
        "Langston: Are you sure she won't try and, you know, take advantage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Hannah, what are you doing? Eli is out there, and he has a gun. I already just barely got Hope away from him. We need to go now. We are all in danger--you and Cole and everyone, Hannah. What is wrong with you? Come on! Cole must be freaking out.",
        "Hannah: Oh, Cole's freaking out, all right--his precious Starr is missing. The whole world stops and he collapses, and he doesn't know what he's gonna do without you and his precious baby.",
        "Starr: You never even tried to find Cole. You didn't even tell him that I called.",
        "Starr: It's okay. Okay, honey. Everything's gonna be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You don't get to talk to Starr till I speak to my wife.",
        "Todd: Your wife?",
        "Eli: My wife, Blair.",
        "Todd: Can't talk to Blair, Eli.",
        "Eli: Oh, come on, Todd. I know she has to be there.",
        "Todd: I think you've done enough damage.",
        "Eli: Oh-ho-ho-ho, come on. She's the one who shot me, remember?",
        "Todd: Oh, that's right. With blanks like you wanted, right? No, you used her. Put Starr on the phone.",
        "Eli: Hey, Manning, you are not in charge! I am. You want me to hang up? I'll hang up. Uh-oh. I'm hanging up.",
        "Blair: Eli, I'm here.",
        "Eli: Hey, gorgeous. I didn't think I'd ever hear your voice again.",
        "Blair: Well, I didn't think I'd hear your voice again either.",
        "Eli: Hey, that is not the way I wanted things to happen. I'm sorry our wedding turned out the way it did, but marrying you, I have to admit, was worth all this trouble. I still love you, you know. I always will. Nothing's ever gonna change that. Now, we may have had our differences...",
        "Blair: You killed innocent people in cold blood, Eli. This isn't some little lover's quarrel that we got going here. You are a vicious, murdering monster.",
        "Eli: Come now, Blair, I'm still your husband. There's no need to be hurtful.",
        "John: [Whispering] Be cool.",
        "Blair: Okay. Yeah, you know what? You're right, Eli. You know how I can get.",
        "Eli: Oh, you're a very passionate woman. I'm gonna miss that almost as much as I'm--",
        "Blair: Yes, and I'm very passionate about my children. You know that. So if you love me, you'll let me talk to my daughter. Put Starr on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[\"Pop goes the weasel\" plays]",
        "Starr: Ohh! That was really creepy, wasn't it? I'm sorry. Of course Hannah would have creepy toys. I should've known she hadn't changed.",
        "Starr: I don't know what game this is, but I don't have time...",
        "Hannah: For Starr? Everybody has time for Starr. Starr, Starr, Starr is the center of the universe, and I'm sick of it! Things would be so much different if you weren't around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: That girl has done some seriously crazy stuff to get you, Cole.",
        "Langston: Ahem.",
        "Hannah: No, it's okay. I understand why you guys don't trust me. I've given you no reason to. I'm just glad that Cole has been a friend while I get better. He knows that I only want what's best for him and Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Price: T\u00e9a Delgado is dead and buried.",
        "Natalie: Cremated. Greg had her ashes sent back from that hospice.",
        "Price: So? We all know that he was obviously disoriented last night.",
        "Natalie: Something's not right here. We know that Eli and Greg are in this together somehow. Eli ends up at the same hospice that T\u00e9a died in. Then he tries to kill Greg, who it turns out was treating a woman at Cherryvale. Then Eli goes on the run with two girls and a toddler, and he ends up at the same clinic?",
        "Price: I mean, it's not like he could have gone to a hospital in Llanview.",
        "Natalie: True, but do you really think it's a coincidence that Clarke ended up at Cherryvale? Or do you think maybe there's a connection to the patient Greg was treating?",
        "Price: Could be.",
        "Natalie: Maybe he was, uh, maybe he was using the woman as some kind of cover, you know, or maybe he thought he could hide out there...maybe stash the girls there or...",
        "Price: Or what? Say it. You think that Evans isn't so out of it and that that woman at the hospital is actually T\u00e9a Delgado back from the dead? Ha.",
        "Natalie: No, no. It's--it's too crazy. But we should check it out anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Oh, honey, thanks for this.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm. Well, I knew you weren't gonna stop, so I brought you food.",
        "Bo: Mmm.",
        "Bo: Paperwork.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bo: My favorite.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm. Those are open warrants for this county. You can talk to anybody, you can knock down any door you need to to get those girls with those things.",
        "Bo: Mmm. And I didn't get you anything.",
        "Nora: Yet. You're gonna get me Elijah Clarke in leg irons.",
        "Bo: Boy, I can't wait to see that.",
        "Nora: I can't believe the number of times I stood up with him at court. You know, it was so amazing, I saw Natalie reading...and the first thought that came to my head was, \"Oh, my God! Don't let that barracuda sign up for his defense.\" And then I realized she's not going to because T\u00e9a's gone.",
        "Bo: This is strange, you know. She's so young, vital.",
        "Nora: She was so indestructible in court, you know, so stubborn and relentless.",
        "Bo: Sounds just like you, Red.",
        "Nora: Maybe that's why I'm having such trouble with the fact...that she's gone. I don't know, she was such a fighter, right down to the bone. I just still have a hard time believing that she...got beaten by a damn tumor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh...oh, damn it, I'm so tired of being sick. Dani. Todd. I need your help. Please come find me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: Ah, Todd and Blair want to talk to you. Now, you tell them you're okay and nothing else. You got me? Speak.",
        "Dani: Hello?",
        "Blair: Dani? Dani, sweetheart, is that you?",
        "Todd: Ask her how she is.",
        "Blair: It's Blair. Are you okay?",
        "Dani: I'm okay.",
        "Blair: Oh, thank God. How's Starr? Are you two taking care of each other?",
        "Dani: Starr and Hope got away!",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Eli: Wrong move.",
        "Blair: Dani? Eli?",
        "Eli: You were warned.",

        "Eli: Pay no attention to that door!",
        "Todd: What's going on?",
        "Blair: Dani? Eli? I can't hear.",
        "Todd: Are they still connected?",
        "Blair: Eli! Is something going on? Is Dani hurt, Eli?",
        "[Dani crying]",
        "Eli: All right, tell her.",
        "Dani: Blair, it's me. I thought I heard a noise in the other room.",
        "Eli: Tell her.",

        "Price: What do you mean? She checked out?",
        "Orderly: No. She just disappeared.",

        "Bo: Manning.",
        "Nora: Yeah. But hell, I even feel badly for him right now. Can you imagine? He's lost his wife. His two daughters and a granddaughter are in the hands of a homicidal maniac.",
        "Bo: Do you think it's karma?",
        "Nora: Well, he deserves every bad thing that ever happens to him, but those kids don't.",

        "Blair: What?",

        "Todd: Did what?",
        "Agent: He managed to bounce the call around international stations. At least that's what it looked like, but we still should have been able to track the call's point of origin.",
        "Todd: But you didn't. Why?",
        "Agent: Local interference. We get a read from Belgium, then the Palace hotel here, Estonia, Angel Square, Greenland, then that new Buchanan stadium they're building.",
        "John: Clarke must have planted them all over town to block their ability to trace from here.",
        "Blair: Oh, no.",
        "Todd: So we find them.",

        "Blair: But that's nothing. You got absolutely nothing. You have all this high- tech equipment and you can't keep a crazy man from going after innocent girls? These are my daughters! Our granddaughter! Don't you understand that, guys? God! Starr--she could be hurt or worse! We don't have time here.",
        "Agent: We don't know.",

        "Eli: Do you ever shut up? What is with you Manning girls? No, no, no, no! I said forget it! You and Starr were a pain in the ass when you were together.",
        "Dani: Please, I'm worried.",
        "Eli: The only thing you have to worry about right now is whether daddy can come up with the big bucks. That is your biggest problem.",

        "Todd: Blair, you heard Dani, right? Starr and Hope were in the next room.",
        "Blair: Yeah, maybe. Well, she didn't see Starr. Maybe Starr tried to get away and she didn't make it. Maybe Eli shot her.",
        "Todd: Come on. Don't think that way. That didn't happen.",
        "Blair: Listen, I heard it in his voice. He's snapped!",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's true, but he still wants his money.",
        "Blair: Yeah, and he wants you to know that. So why didn't he put Starr on the phone? Why didn't he let you talk to her?",

        "John: Near Cherryvale. All right, he must have taken another one, so we're looking for stolen vehicles in the area. We found this.",

She said, \"Look, Mom, it has room for more babies.\" It was a tough time, Todd. She was trying to figure out each cry, you know, what it meant, night feedings. She was...I mean, I thought she would be terrified. I mean, I was when she was a baby, but she wasn't. She was just excited to have...more children, and now I don't know...if she's gonna be able to have that chance.",
