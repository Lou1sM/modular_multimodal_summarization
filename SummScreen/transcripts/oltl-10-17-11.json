        "While Todd is alone in the cabin, he is once again \"visited\" by Irene who tells him that he must remembering going to Victor's home in the rain, finding Jack's keys which were lying on the ground, letting himself in and murdering Victor. We see that very event occurring and Todd being devastated to remember for the first time. He then realizes or wants to believe that it's only Irene haunting him and brainwashing him to believe that and it did not happen. But do we really know? It appears that neither Rex nor Shane are \"viable\" suspects. But Brody looks somewhat suspicious when Shaun and Vimal reminds John that the murder weapon is the same as what Brody uses and that Brody was overheard making a death threat to Victor. Rex tells Roxy that he supports Natalie moving on with Brody and getting over John. But she adamantly tells him that John is the man for his sister. In Kentucky, Cutter and Rama \"help\" each other by turning Kim in for drugging and killing the customer at The Spotted Pony. Meanwhile, the young woman known as Stacy who looks just like Gigi awakens. Yet we do not yet get to know who she really is or what she remembers."

        "Rex: I mean, I still can't believe that's what it took for me to wake up -- seeing my son with a gun in his hand. I'm just glad Gigi didn't have to see it.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Rex.",
        "Rex: No. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I filled myself up with so much grief, I left my son to fend for himself, and he couldn't and spiraled out of control. It's like the high school roof all over again.",
        "Natalie: So from now on, you're gonna do things differently.",
        "Rex: Well, from now on, Shane is my priority -- no excuses. I think that's what Gigi was telling me when she said, \"Don't give up\" -- don't give up on our son.",

        "Kim: What are you doing here?",
        "Rama: Oh, I'm here to settle an old score.",
        "Kim: We haven't seen each other in like a century. What old score could we settle?",
        "Rama: I'm talking about my money, the money you stole from me.",
        "Kim: Oh, right. The -- you mean the -- the cash I borrowed. Well, I was totally gonna pay you back. I-I --",
        "Rama: Well, you had a century to pay me back, and you haven't done it. No! You used it to buy new everything.",
        "Kim: [Clears throat]",
        "Rama: You thought you were safe 'cause I wouldn't recognize you. Well, guess what. You're not safe, Aubrey.",
        "Kim: Kim.",
        "Rama: Whatever the hell you're calling yourself now. You're not safe from me, 'cause I'm here to collect, with interest.",

        "T\u00e9a: Todd is willing to turn himself in, but we're gonna need something in return.",
        "Bo: [Laughing] Oh. Well, that's pushing it, T\u00e9a. I mean, even for you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm simply giving my client the best representation I can.",
        "Bo: But you're dictating terms, and your client's negotiating position -- it's pretty much nonexistent.",
        "T\u00e9a: You haven't heard our request. I think it's pretty reasonable, given the circumstances surrounding the investigation.",
        "Bo: All right. Let's hear it.",
        "T\u00e9a: The murder charge.",
        "Bo: Victor's?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd will come in once it's dropped.",

        "Shaun: L.T. Just the man I'm looking for.",
        "John: I'm kind of busy right now, big man.",
        "Shaun: The Victor Lord murder?",
        "John: Could be.",
        "Shaun: I got some information.",
        "John: What kind of information?",
        "Shaun: The kind you should hear before anybody else does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, who killed you, brother of mine? We're twins, right? Aren't we supposed to have some kind of a spooky connection?",

        "Todd: Blair? T\u00e9a?",
        "Irene: Guess again.",
        "Todd: No.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: The murder charge doesn't hold anymore, Commissioner.",
        "Bo: But that's not your call, T\u00e9a.",
        "T\u00e9a: The lion's share of evidence against Todd is Jack's \"eyewitness\" account, which has now been shot full of holes by Shane Morasco.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but just because Jack didn't see anything, that doesn't mean that Todd didn't shoot Victor. He had a motive. And we have a recording on Shaun Evans' phone. And it was made just before Victor was shot, and it might be the proof that Todd was the one that killed him. So I think you're being a little bit premature, T\u00e9a. What?",
        "T\u00e9a: That phone has Victor's voice on it?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: I need to hear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You're not bringing me another voicemail, are you?",
        "Shaun: Why?",
        "John: Well, for the record, Jack Manning didn't overhear the murder. He, uh, he knew about the voicemail because, uh, he overheard you and Starr talking. He then pretended to have firsthand knowledge of the crime.",
        "Shaun: Guess I shouldn't be surprised. Damn, I hate the fact that kid played me out like that.",
        "John: Yeah, I just hate that kid, but, hey, look, maybe you'll make up for it, right? You know, with the information you're gonna tell me. Have a seat.",
        "Shaun: Well, I can't guarantee it's gonna lead anywhere. I don't know the guy that well.",
        "John: What guy?",
        "Shaun: I ran into Vimal Patel at Capricorn last night. I got a feeling he might know something.",
        "John: Oh, yeah? Like what?",
        "Shaun: Well, we started talking about the murder. Then he said he thought a cop might have done it.",
        "John: An LPD cop?",
        "Shaun: He was a little freaked out, man.",
        "John: Did he tell you why he thought the shooter was a cop?",
        "Shaun: Whoever did Victor used a 9-millimeter, right? Standard issue at the LPD. But I told him to forget it. There's no way one of your boys could be behind something like this.",

        "Rama: Don't \"sweetie\" me, you bitch!",
        "Kim: Whoa! You never used to talk that way when we were in school together.",
        "Rama: Well, I was young and naive. I'm not naive anymore. You can't con me.",
        "Kim: Oh, trust me. I'm too tired to con anybody. This job -- killer. [Scoffs]",
        "Rama: Really, Kim? Shaking your booty? It's like digging coal, huh?",
        "Kim: It's hard work! And the pay sucks. But I have been setting a little aside each week so that I would be able to pay you back.",
        "Rama: Stop it! You had no intention of ever paying me back!",
        "Kim: Of course, I did! And then the most amazing thing happened -- financially. Something's about to come through for me, and I will definitely be able to -- hey! There he is. Just ask my brother. He'll tell you all about it.",
        "Cutter: Tell her all about what?",
        "Kim: You know, that I'm gonna be a very rich woman. So I can pay Rama back the loan she gave me.",
        "Cutter: I -- sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm...just here to do my civic duty!",
        "Kim: Your what? Why are you talking like that?",
        "Cutter: Officers! She's, uh, she's in here!",

        "Nate: Maybe we should watch it some other time.",
        "Danielle: Why?",
        "Nate: I think I should have picked a comedy. I mean, you're just -- when we saw \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" you were just so into the remake, and --",
        "Danielle: Yeah. And y-- and you wanted me to see the original.",
        "Nate: Someday. But, um, maybe now's not the right time.",
        "Danielle: Yeah. It's just a little close to home, you know? Uh, the guy -- he's -- he's trying so hard to get his life together, but how can he when his psycho mother is controlling everything? You know, he's like her puppet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: This is not happening.",
        "Irene: Why? Because you shot me?",
        "Todd: I shot you. I shot you dead.",
        "Irene: And yet...here I am.",
        "Todd: No. You're in my head. Get out of my head, Irene.",
        "Irene: Sorry. As long as you draw breath, so do I.",
        "Todd: No, you don't. There are people in this world who care about me, and they're helping me. And you're not a part of that.",
        "Irene: What can they do that I can't?",
        "Todd: Starr helped me get out of jail. Blair dug a bullet out of me. And T\u00e9a's gonna make sure that I don't go to jail for a murder that I didn't commit.",
        "Irene: Oh. Is she, now?",
        "Todd: Yes, she is. So all your work to frame me for Victor's murder was a waste of time. The cops' case is falling apart as we speak. I'm gonna walk.",
        "Irene: [Chuckles] You may not go to prison, but you won't walk away. A guilty man never escapes. Not really.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Hi. Wait, these -- these aren't real cops, are they?",
        "Officer: Oh, we're definitely real... ma'am.",
        "Cutter: Guys. Guys, she's gonna have some questions. You guys mind if -- if -- if you just wait a second before you take her away?",
        "Kim: Take me where?",
        "Officer: No problem.",
        "Cutter: Thanks. Here. Why don't you guys just make yourselves comfortable over here? You need a drink or anything, I'm a partial investor.",
        "Kim: Cutter, this isn't funny. What is going on?",
        "Rama: You're busted, Kim.",
        "Kim: For what? Is this about the handicapped sticker on my car? Because that is totally legit. I have sciatica from the pole! My doctor gave me a note and every--",
        "Cutter: It's not about the sticker. Look, you've been on the run for a long time from the truth. We all have. But me and Rama -- we couldn't run no more. All right? So we went to the police, and we told them the whole story.",
        "Rama: We showed them the evidence.",
        "Kim: What story? What evidence? What are you talking about?",
        "Cutter: The proof that you're the killer.",
        "Rama: I've been holding onto this for a very long time.",

        "Rex: Hey! Your future's almost here! You ready for your wedding?",
        "Natalie: Oh, I just wish it was over with already. I mean, I'm looking forward to it. You know, I just wish there was a stamp, make it official that Liam, Brody, and I are a family.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Gigi pretty much said that, too.",
        "Natalie: What is wrong with me? Everything that comes out of my mouth makes things worse.",
        "Rex: No, no, no, no. You didn't -- you didn't say anything wrong. Like I said, I'm done living in the past. I'm trying to look forward. Things have got to get better from here on out -- for me, for Shane, and for you, too. I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: All right. Thanks.",
        "John: All right.",
        "Brody: What was that about?",
        "John: He had a tip on, uh, on Victor Lord's murder.",
        "Brody: Anything good?",
        "John: I don't know. We'll have to -- have to work on it a little bit.",
        "Brody: Can I help?",
        "John: Maybe. Uh... how are things between, uh, you and your -- your buddy Vimal?",
        "Brody: He's not exactly a buddy.",
        "John: Yeah, I didn't think so. You guys got into it the other day in the station, didn't you?",
        "Brody: We had a difference of opinion. Not a big deal. Why? Did he say something?",
        "John: He thinks it was a cop that killed Victor.",
        "Brody: A cop? He's full of it, John.",
        "John: Yeah. Probably. That guy lies about everything, but, um, Victor was killed with a 9 millimeter.",
        "Brody: So what? A lot of people shoot a 9 millimeter.",
        "John: I tell you what. Let's, uh, let's play this one by the book. Let's -- let's clear everyone on the force -- including you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm not gonna contaminate the evidence. I need to listen to that voicemail.",
        "Bo: You have a transcript. You know what it says.",
        "T\u00e9a: Reading is not the same thing. I need to listen to it.",
        "Bo: Then you're gonna have to wait till the next phase of discovery.",
        "T\u00e9a: Bo, please. [Voice breaking] It's my husband. [Sniffles] This is the last time I'll ever hear his voice.",
        "Bo: T\u00e9a, come on. We both know what he says and why. Do you want your last memory of Victor to be... the way he died?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: So, way better than the remake, no?",
        "Danielle: It's still the same sad ending.",
        "Nate: Well, it's not totally sad. I mean, at least the crazy mother didn't win in the end. Right?",
        "Danielle: I mean, I'm glad we watched it. I just wish that... the brainwashed guy had lived, you know? After everything that was done to him, he deserved a chance to be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What are you talking about? What is it you think I have to be guilty about?",
        "Irene: Did it slip your mind? That's all right. I'm here to remind you, to keep you honest.",
        "Todd: You're my conscience? No. I-I don't need you. I've got my own. And for once in my life, it's finally clear.",
        "Irene: Even though you killed your own mother?",
        "Todd: I was protecting my family.",
        "Irene: And Victor?",
        "Todd: I didn't kill Victor.",
        "Irene: Do you admit that you considered it?",
        "Todd: Hell yeah, I considered it.",
        "Irene: You even armed yourself, prepared for battle?",
        "Todd: Yeah. But I didn't go through with it. I -- I took off. I -- I walked around. I went anywhere. I-I did whatever I could to keep myself from killing my brother.",
        "Irene: Yeah. That's what you told yourself. But there was nothing aimless in that walk you took. You had a purpose -- a destination. Think. See? It's all coming back, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: Echo! Miss DiSavoy! You get your butt down here! We got to talk about that document!",
        "Rex: Document? What document?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I don't care how many pictures you come up with. I didn't kill that guy, and you know it.",
        "Rama: Oh, Kim. I know you're ashamed. I would be, too, if I'd accidentally poisoned a man.",
        "Kim: Me?! I had nothing to do with that.",
        "Rama: Then why do I have a picture to prove it?",
        "Rama: Because you faked it! That was a picture of Cutter, not me.",
        "Cutter: I-I told the D.A. That she'd probably try and turn this around on me.",
        "Kim: The D.A.?!",
        "Rama: Your brother did the right thing. We had to come clean about that night. Knowing what you did to that poor man -- we just couldn't live with ourselves.",
        "Kim: Oh, my God. You're setting me up. You son of a bitch. How could you do this to me?",
        "Cutter: I'll always love you. But justice had to be done. Be gentle with her. She's still my little sister.",
        "Officer: You need to come with us, ma'am.",
        "Kim: Oh, the hell I do. Aah!",
        "Rama: Extensions! I should have known. Kim, is there any part of you that is real?",
        "Kim: You want real? Chew on this.",
        "Rama: [Screaming]",
        "[Both screaming]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: Oh, it's no big deal. I'll call her later. Echo, I'm gonna call you later.",
        "Rex: To talk about a document?",
        "Roxanne: Uh, just a little business.",
        "Rex: What kind of business do you have with Echo?",
        "Roxanne: Aw, you know -- business. Uh, what kind of business do you think? My business, of course, you know, is follicular stuff. It's a dye job. Oh, she needs her roots done, so I'm gonna have her sign a document so she won't sue me, just in case she flips her wig, you know, if I make it the wrong color or something like that -- I don't know -- so to speak. [Laughs]",
        "Rex: Like a release form.",
        "Roxanne: \"Like a release form.\" Yeah. Like a release form. Honey, I've got to tell you, I am really, really worried about Shane.",
        "Rex: He's pretty shaken up from last night, but he'll be okay. Roxanne:. Oh. You bet he will be. And you will be, too. You are my two favorite guys. And I know you're gonna make it.",
        "Rex: I was just telling Natalie the same thing.",
        "Roxanne: Oh. Is she around?",
        "Rex: No. You just missed her. Which is good. I wanted to run something by you.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, about Natty.",
        "Rex: Is it me, or has nobody thrown Natalie and Brody an engagement party?",
        "Roxanne: Why would they need an engagement party?",
        "Rex: Uh, because they're engaged.",
        "Roxanne: And what are you smoking?",
        "Rex: When she showed me the ring on her finger, I guess I just assumed.",
        "Roxanne: Brody put a ring on it?",
        "Rex: That's great, right?",
        "Roxanne: Hell no! What about John?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What are you getting at? Are you asking me to turn in my weapon for testing?",
        "John: I'm asking you to follow procedure.",
        "John: Is everyone else's weapon getting tested?",
        "John: Absolutely -- you, me, everyone else. But you let me deal with that.",
        "Brody: You cannot think I used my gun on Victor Lord. Is this payback for Natalie and me?",
        "John: I don't know what that means, and I sure as hell hope you didn't kill Victor Lord. That would be bad for all of us. This is the job, Brody.",
        "Brody: Well, it feels very personal.",
        "John: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. If I ask you nicely, will you comply with the order and surrender your weapon?",
        "Brody: And what if I don't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Victor: Hey, Shaun, it's me. I need to put you back on the payroll to humor my ex-wife. Uh, it's really nothing. You won't have to do anything at all. Hello? So, uh... oh, my God. What the hell are you doing here?",

        "Danielle: Thanks again for remembering that, you know, my birthday's tomorrow.",
        "Nate: Mm-hmm. Hey. Your mom's gonna remember it, too. She's just really busy trying to help your dad now.",
        "Danielle: Makes me feel a little better hearing you say that. Thanks.",
        "Nate: Maybe it'll make up for my, uh, weird choice in birthday presents.",
        "Danielle: Let's put it this way -- next time, I pick the movie.",
        "Nate: This mean you're willing to give me another chance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You got to be kidding me. Are you -- are you telling me you're refusing to do this?",
        "Natalie: Refusing to do what?",
        "Brody: John wants ballistics to test every sidearm issued to the LPD.",
        "Natalie: What for?",
        "Brody: He thinks someone in the department might have killed Victor Lord.",
        "Natalie: \"Someone\"? Are you serious?",
        "John: Yeah, I'm serious. The murder weapon was a 9 millimeter. Are you gonna cooperate or not?",
        "Natalie: [Scoffs] This is insane. You're gonna test -- I'm gonna go talk to Uncle Bo.",
        "Brody: No. Natalie. Go ahead. Test it.",

        "Irene: I triggered something, didn't I?",
        "Todd: There's nothing to trigger. I didn't go anywhere near Victor's house that night. What are you doing?",
        "Irene: Think, Todd. Think about the storm. It was raining. Remember?",
        "Todd: It was raining. Was it?",
        "Irene: You were listening for Victor's voice. Then you heard it. Your heart began to pound. You knew he was inside. You knew you had him.",
        "Todd: I don't know where you're getting all this. None of this happened -- n-none of it. None of it.",
        "Irene: You had the gun in your hand. It was heavy, wasn't it? You tried the door, but it was locked. How did you get in?",
        "Todd: I didn't. I... I-I didn't.",
        "Irene: You spotted something. Keys. If you had any doubt, it vanished at that moment. Remember that moment, Todd? Let it all come back. Let it all come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: You've got some abrasions, ma'am. There's a first-aid kit outside.",
        "Kim: Oh, she doesn't need first aid! She needs a lie detector! They both do.",
        "Officer: I'm gonna have to call this in. Be right back.",
        "Cutter: Sure. She ain't going nowhere.",

        "Kim: How could you team up with that bitch?",
        "Cutter: Rama was coming after you with or without me. I had to make sure she didn't turn on me, too.",
        "Kim: Oh, and tell everyone it was really you?",
        "Cutter: I wish it didn't have to be this way.",
        "Kim: It's not just me I'm worried about. What about Stacy? I mean, if I go away, well, who takes care of her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Stacy: I need Rex.",
        "Nurse: We're -- we're gonna get you everything you need, okay? You just stay calm, and I'll get the doctor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: No, no, no. That is not right. She cannot marry Brody. She would have told me!",
        "Rex: Well, you've been busy. Tampering with possible murder weapons eats up a lot of time.",
        "Roxanne: Don't you get smart with me when your sister is about to make the stupidest mistake of her life!",
        "Rex: Why is it a mistake? Brody and Natalie have a kid. They live together.",
        "Roxanne: Because she doesn't love Brody. She loves Johnny McBain, and she always will.",
        "Brody: She's not supposed to care that John doesn't love her?",
        "Roxanne: Johnny does love her!",
        "Rex: You don't know that.",
        "Roxanne: Hell yes! I do know that -- he just told me that the other night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Relax, man. Ballistics done. We'll have an answer in a minute.",
        "Brody: You should never have asked the question.",
        "John: Hey, listen, I'm running down every lead. I have to, all right? 'Cause if I don't, some sharpie defense attorney finds out we didn't, we can kiss a conviction goodbye.",
        "Brody: Right. You're just being thorough.",
        "John: I'm doing you a favor, Brody.",
        "Brody: How do you figure that?",
        "John: Better answering those questions here and now than on the stand or in front of Internal Affairs.",
        "Brody: You know, Vimal Patel has done time at Statesville, and now he says one thing about a cop.",
        "John: I know. I know. But you argued with the man. You argued with him on the day that Victor died, and you still haven't told me why.",
        "Brody: Liam's not my son. [Crying] He's John's. Vimal wasn't accusing me of killing Victor Lord, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "John: Okay. So what were you two shouting about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: Don't stop now. You can see it. You're almost there.",
        "Todd: No. I'm just -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm sick. That's all. I have a gunshot. My fever's back. And... none of this is real. You're not real.",
        "Irene: What you did to Victor -- that was real. And I understand why. He took everything. Your home, your family, your identity. You had to get it back. So...what did you do?",
        "Todd: I went to his off-- I went to my office. I told him I want my life back.",
        "Irene: And he refused... leaving you just one option.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Okay, I admit I lost it, but it had nothing to do with Victor Lord. So let's... you already done?",

        "T\u00e9a: Thank you.",
        "Bo: Are you okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: I will be... once the murder charge is dropped... because whoever Victor was talking to that night, it wasn't Todd.",
        "Natalie: Sorry, John. Sorry to disappoint you, but Brody's gun was not used to kill Victor Lord. Brody's innocent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Irene: And that's how you ended up at the door with the keys in one hand and a gun in the other. You had to get back what was yours.",
        "Todd: Hello?",
        "Victor: So, uh... oh, my God. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Todd: You take my life, Victor? I take yours. Oh, my God. [Sobbing]",
        "Irene: There, there. Isn't it good to have your memory back?",

        "Nate: [Sighs]",
        "Danielle: And...",
        "Nate: I know. Okay? I... I was ashamed. And I lied, and I humiliated us both in the worst possible way.",
        "Danielle: Yeah.",
        "Nate: But I don't want to just stand here and promise you that I will never hurt you again. I want a chance to prove it. I want to show you I can be the guy that you deserve, Dani. If you'll let me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: Let's go.",
        "Kim: Cutter, please. What's gonna happen to Stacy? Without me, they're just gonna let her die!",
        "Cutter: That's not my problem.",
        "Kim: Oh, the hell it isn't. If I go down for this, Stacy is your responsibility. You owe me that much!",
        "Rama: He owes you nothing!",
        "Kim: That's not true! I could have turned you in, but I didn't. I protected you all this time. Ow! Stacy is your responsibility. If anything happens to her, it's on you, Cutter. It's all on you.",
        "Rama: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: We thought the call button had malfunctioned, but then...",
        "Stacy: I need help. I need to get to Rex.",
        "Doctor: You need to lie still. You're not fully mobile yet. Do you remember what happened to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: John told you he still loves Natalie. He said those words?",
        "Roxanne: \"L-u-v\" -- love, baby. He spilled his guts at Rodi's the other night.",
        "Rex: At Rodi's?",
        "Roxanne: Yes, at Rodi's! What about it?",
        "Rex: No, no, no. Natalie told me about that conversation. John specifically said he does not still love Natalie.",
        "Roxanne: Yeah, well, he didn't admit it at first, but then when I leaned on him. Excuse me, but how did she even know about that? Did she tell you that she was there?",
        "Rex: Don't tell her I said anything.",
        "Roxanne: I'm gonna tell your sister she's a moron.",
        "Rex: What are you talking about?!",
        "Roxanne: She didn't hear the best part, okay? She heard half the part. Your dim-witted sister didn't even get to the best part. John loves Natalie.",
        "Rex: And n-Natalie has no idea?",
        "Roxanne: Yeah. That's why she can't marry Brody.",
        "Rex: Whoa! Where are you going?",
        "Roxanne: Natty needs to hear the truth, and I'm gonna be the one to tell her.",
        "Rex: No, no. That's the last thing you're gonna do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: So, why do you think a cop killed Victor?",
        "John: Someone made a statement, someone who worked for Victor.",
        "Natalie: Not that secretary?",
        "John: What secretary? Natalie, what secretary?",
        "Natalie: Uh... you know what? Uh, sorry. I-I guess I-I just got a little confused. You said somebody who worked for Victor, and I-I misunderstood.",
        "John: I was talking about Vimal Patel. Who were you talking about?",
        "Natalie: Not important.",
        "John: You know, why don't you let me be the judge of that?",
        "Natalie: Uh... look, John, this is kind of -- this is pointless.",
        "Brody: Just tell him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Without further evidence, this will never make it past a grand jury.",
        "Bo: Well, even if we make the murder charge go away, there's still the matter of Todd's escape.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd is willing to face that as long as you drop the murder charge.",
        "Bo: I'll talk to Nora.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you, Commissioner. And I want you to know, this is not about Todd. I need to find who murdered my husband.",
        "Bo: I just hope that you're not putting your faith in the wrong person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: There's no evidence. There's nothing that can put me in that house.",
        "Irene: Oh, you were very careful, weren't you?",
        "Todd: How could I kill my own brother and then not know it until now?",
        "Irene: Well, you talked about it often enough. All those nights in neighboring cells, I encouraged you to take care of --",
        "Todd: It was you. You forced me to do it.",
        "Irene: You didn't do anything you didn't want to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Uh, Victor's secretary stopped by and offered a statement.",
        "John: When was this?",
        "Natalie: A couple of weeks ago.",
        "John: A couple weeks ago? I don't remember seeing anything in the files.",
        "Natalie: I didn't think it was worth recording.",
        "John: Excuse me?",
        "Natalie: Her statement wasn't relevant to this murder.",
        "John: Oh, you made that determination. What did she say?",
        "Natalie: She said that she overheard a conversation in Victor's office between Victor and Brody.",
        "John: Between Victor and Brody. What were they saying?",
        "Natalie: I don't -- I don't -- I don't really remember.",
        "Brody: I threatened him.",
        "Natalie: Brody, you don't have to say anything.",
        "Brody: It's okay. I told him if he did anything to hurt me or my family, I'd kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I didn't kill my brother. You know, you... you -- you kill your brother, that's something you remember, right? How could I block something like that out?",
        "Irene: Force of habit. Eight years in captivity taught you to bury the parts of yourself that you didn't like. But I know the real you.",
        "Todd: No, you don't. You don't know me. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me.",
        "Irene: I know you are the son of Victor Lord. Don't you forget it... because nobody else will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: So, what do you say? Huh? Give me another shot. Please?",
        "Danielle: I can't be your girlfriend. Not without... going on a date first. L-listen to me. I'm willing to take this slow... and see what happens, okay?",
        "Nate: Dani, that's... slow.",
        "Danielle: Yeah.",
        "Nate: Slow's good.",
        "Danielle: Right.",
        "Nate: [Chuckles] So, uh... until next time?",
        "Danielle: Next time. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: [Sighs] All right... I'll check on her, just this once.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Doctor: Lie still, please. Lie still.",
        "Cutter: Wait. W-what happened? She woke up?",
        "Nurse: Yes, but she's still a little confused.",
        "Doctor: Do you know who the president is? How about your name? Can you tell me your name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: Let go of me. Your sister needs to know that John loves her.",
        "Rex: Don't you think he should be the one to say that?",
        "Roxanne: He can't!",
        "Rex: Why the hell not?",
        "Roxanne: He can't! It's his pride!",
        "Rex: Oh, well... then I think she's better off without him. She's got a good guy, Rox. He makes her happy. They're starting a family together.",
        "Roxanne: Brody is not the one.",
        "Rex: He could be... if she gives him half a chance, and that's what she wants to do.",
        "Roxanne: How do you know?",
        "Rex: She told me. She's moving on, Rox. Just like me. I'm letting go of Gigi -- she's letting go of John. Now, let her do this, Rox, okay? Let her be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Well, I can see how you'd find that irrelevant. You know, Brody, you don't usually threaten to kill a man without provocation. So what did Victor do? How'd he threaten to hurt your family?",
