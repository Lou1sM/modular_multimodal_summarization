        "Jessica: How long are you going to keep this up?",
        "Jared: And by \"this,\" you mean?",
        "Jessica: I mean parking your ass on our sofa, drinking our wine.",
        "Jared: Ok, actually, the wine and the sofa belong to me, given that I own 51% of everything Brennan.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nash: I got it.",
        "Jared: No, whoa. That -- hang on. delivery. It's for me. You're not the boy.",
        "Natalie: No. But I'm here to deliver what you really want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: I do not know what's going on here, all right? But I'm not going to let you disrespect Shaun.",
        "Antonio: Don't you mean \"George\"?",
        "Vincent: The man has every right to hit on that woman.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, right, ok. Well, maybe in your world.",
        "Vincent: Look, lieutenant, think what you want about me, ok? But Shaun -- he's all right.",
        "Antonio: Well, Talia seems to think so.",
        "Vincent: Hmm. Now, I do not know what her story is, ok? But that business with Shaun -- it's just for show.",
        "Shaun: Hey, Talia.",
        "Layla: Fine.",
        "Talia: Hey.",
        "Cristian: Hey.",
        "Vincent: Hey.",
        "Shaun: Hey.",
        "Antonio: You know, Vincent just said that Talia isn't really your girlfriend.",
        "Layla: That is ridiculous. Of course, she is.",
        "Shaun: I guess it's time to come clean.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hey, Todd, it's Blair. Please give me a call and let me know what's going on. Thanks. If you're here for the show, you might as well come back in an hour.",
        "Marty: I'm here to talk to you, about Todd's son.",
        "Blair: Todd and my family are none of your business, Marty.",
        "Marty: Anything's my business when it concerns somebody I care about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Makes sense she'd come here. I was so stupid. I should have known Ron was lying.",
        "John: I'm just glad warren tracked her car, and not the feds. Now, all we have to do is persuade Marcie to give it all up before they make an arrest.",
        "Todd: Wow. Guys, did you just forget to invite me to this party? Because that's my kid you're looking for, remember.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: I asked you if you locked the door. Yeah? Ok. Thanks. Both of you, stay in the van. Do not leave, you got it?",
        "Todd: Question. How does a cop with no badge get a surveillance truck? Answer -- he calls in a favor from a pal at the FBI so he can help his brother's wife beat a kidnapping rap.",
        "John: I'll deal with you later. Right now, I don't have time for this crap. Dad always said we'd end up in a van down by the river.",
        "Todd: So how does it feel to know this is all your fault? I mean, if you had told the truth from the beginning about who the baby's father really was --",
        "Michael: I'm his father. Ok? You just share DNA.",
        "Todd: You know, Michael, when this is all over, not only are you going to lose this kid, you're going to go to jail for perjury. Yes. You are going to pay, my friend.",
        "Michael: I'm already paying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Lights are out. Nobody seems to be home. This is your call, John.",
        "Marcie: All right, so you gave her the pacifier for him because he -- he likes that. And -- oh, and -- and the little bag with the grapes in it. He loves those.",
        "Man: All right, look, my wife and I -- we have six kids. Don't worry, she'll take care of your little boy.",
        "Ron: Yeah, and -- and it won't be for long, just till we get everything straightened out here.",
        "Man: Yeah. I'll go check on the vehicle.",
        "Ron: Thanks, Rocco.",
        "Marcie: Thanks, Rocco.",
        "Ron: So, you're absolutely sure about this?",
        "Marcie: Kind of guess I have to be, right?",
        "Ron: Because if you go tough with this, after today, Marcie Walsh McBain and her son, Tommy, no longer exist.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: There's been a misunderstanding here. Obviously.",
        "Sarah: Uh, I'm going to go kick something. Excuse me.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, me, too. Good luck, bro.",
        "Talia: Look, there's something I want to explain to you, ok?",
        "Shaun: No --",
        "Talia: I never -- I will. See, I didn't tell Vincent that Talia's my girlfriend cause I didn't want to. I have a problem being with only one person. You know about it, right, baby?",
        "Talia: Um -- yeah. Your commitment issues.",
        "Shaun: For real. Talia's always been down with us seeing other people.",
        "Talia: Look, thank you, Shaun, for saying all of this, ok? But --",
        "Shaun: I'm saying it because it's the truth. All right?",
        "Talia: Ok, but the real truth is -- um -- I started something that got way out of hand.",
        "Sarah: Is that you?",
        "Cristian: That's right.",
        "Sarah: I didn't know you boxed.",
        "Cristian: I used to.",
        "Sarah: And that's Evangeline there in the front row.",
        "Cristian: You're right, that is her.",
        "Sarah: Looks like she's cheering for you.",
        "Cristian: Well, that's because she came to all my fights.",
        "Sarah: So, you guys were together then?",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Sarah: Layla told me that you guys were broken up when she got hurt.",
        "Cristian: Can I ask you something?",
        "Sarah: Sure.",
        "Cristian: Why were you and Layla talking about me and her sister?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Marty, I don't need to hear anything you have to say about Todd. I saw you at the courthouse with John, so I know whose side you're on, all right?",
        "Marty: I'm not taking sides.",
        "Blair: Oh, that's right. Because you are so kind and you're a shrink and have compassion for everyone.",
        "Marty: Well, in this case I do, and it's not because I'm a psychiatrist. It's because I'm human. And when I said something concerned me about this case, it wasn't about John or Michael or Marcie. It's about Todd's son.",
        "Blair: So you're actually acknowledging who he is? That's huge for you.",
        "Marty: Well, the court gave him custody, so yes, it's Todd's son, and it's for that little boy that I'm asking for your help.",
        "Blair: What kind of help?",
        "Marty: I assume Marcie is going to be brought back to Llanview sooner or later. And when she is, I am hoping that you can convince Todd to forgive her and Michael.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What the hell is your brother doing in there? Well, he'd better come out of that house with my kid, or at least some clue as to where your crazy wife took him.",
        "Michael: Will you stop calling her crazy?",
        "Todd: Ok, yes, you're right. She's not crazy, she's a -- she's perfectly sane and reasonable baby thief.",
        "Michael: Marcie's a great mother, ok? I mean, she was doing everything right. You know, she was first in our baby's CPR class, hmm? She buys him all the right toys. She makes re they're safe, you know? She saves every piece of paper that he scribbles on.",
        "Todd: You know -- huh -- when Jack was this age, he used to -- he used to take one of those big crayons -- hold it in his fat little fist and write all the time.",
        "Michael: Yeah, Tommy does that. Well -- I mean, it's all scribbles, but it means something to him.",
        "Todd: Well, what about words, man? Is he talking yet, or what?",
        "Michael: Yeah, he says -- he says \"yight\" for \"light,\" and he says \"doggie\" and \"kitty\" and \"up,\" \"mine,\" \"more,\" \"daddy.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Man: Anything?",
        "John: I was trying to see if Ron pulled any maps off the internet or anything.",
        "Man: As long as it helps tell us where Marcie's gone.",
        "John: Yeah. Hey, warren, I appreciate you working with me on this.",
        "Warren: It's a sad case. Your sister-in-law shouldn't be treated like she's a criminal.",
        "John: I was wondering why the local police weren't watching the house.",
        "Warren: Bingo.",
        "John: What do you got?",
        "Warren: Look what I found in the couch.",
        "John: It's still fresh. Marcie was here earlier.",
        "Warren: It's getting out of hand, John. I think I should call ahead, have them set up roadblocks at the city exits. She's on the run again and we need to stop her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: How long is --",
        "Ron: Look --",
        "Marcie: This take?",
        "Ron: Hey, don't worry, ok? Rocco works fast. He does. Now, look, you came in here today with a blue car, with Pennsylvania plates, and you're going to go out of here --",
        "Marcie: In a red car -- a dark red car from Florida -- I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Well, well, well, what do you got for me, Natalie?",
        "Natalie: A proposition.",
        "Jessica: Ok, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whatever it is, maybe you should talk about it with me and Nash first.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jared: Yeah?",
        "Boy: I got a large mushroom and pepperoni for Banks.",
        "Jared: Yeah, great. No, that's me. Where do you keep the petty cash?",
        "Nash: Uh --",
        "Jared: I'll get this one. Here we go. We got -- are you an Eagles fan?",
        "Boy: Yeah.",
        "Jared: Oh, games in OT you got to come in. Come on, sit down.",
        "Boy: Yeah? It's ok?",
        "Jared: Sure. Yeah. And you were saying, Nat?",
        "Nash: Never mind what she was saying! I want you out of my house, now!",
        "Jared: Smells good. You guys grab a slice.",
        "Nash: Oh, that son of a --",
        "Jessica: Nash, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't.",
        "Jared: Yeah -- you better listen to your wife, Nash. You wouldn't want to manhandle me in my own house.",
        "Natalie: Well, I probably -- why don't I take him into my 49% and beat the hell out of him?",
        "Jessica: Ok, Jared, why are you here? Why are you here? We hate you! This is my and Nash's home. We're trying -- we're trying to raise a baby here, Jared.",
        "Jared: It's a good thing I like kids.",
        "Natalie: Ok, no lawyers. We're going to handle this ourselves. You got your job back at B.E. I drew up a new contract. All you have to do is sign it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Marty, that is just a swell idea. I'm sure it would be a snap. I'll just say, \"You know, Todd, would it bother you so much if you could forgive Michael and Marcie? I mean, all they did was, you know, keep you away from your son, and -- and put your life through hell for months. I mean, come on, Todd. Show a little compassion.\" Yeah.",
        "Marty: Blair, you and I both know, as well as Todd, the McBains did not know they were adopting his son.",
        "Blair: No, but Michael sure knew about him a long time ago and didn't tell anybody. Now Marcie's run off with Todd's son. Once again, Todd does not know where his son is, and that was after he offered to share custody with Marcie, and she turned him down flat. What do you -- you want Todd to make nice with people that would do something like that to him? I mean, come on.",
        "Marty: I'm not asking anybody to make nice, and if you wouldn't just go off and actually listen to what I am trying to say --",
        "Blair: I didn't start this, Marty.",
        "Marty: I am asking you to consider something. Now, Marcie is either going to be found, or she is going to come back on her own. Either way, Todd is going to be getting his son back. Does he need to get revenge on her, too? And -- and is that the best thing, you know, for that little boy?",
        "Blair: Well, I don't think that little boy is really going to have a real grasp of what's going on here.",
        "Marty: Well, that's where you're wrong, ok? Because children as young as him can form lasting memories.",
        "Blair: Ok, see, I knew you were waiting to drop the psychobabble on me -- go ahead.",
        "Marty: You know, whether you like it or not, he has formed attachments to them. He thinks of Michael and Marcie as his loving parents, and he will always see them that way. So when he is old enough to understand what has happened, he is going to resent Todd, especially if he punishes them harshly. Is that what you want?",
        "Blair: I don't think Todd really thinks about years to come, about what he does now and how it's going to affect his future. But you and I both know that Todd does not forgive, and he certainly never forgets.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know, I got to admit, I never figured you and Marcie were the types who would try to hold on to a kid after you found out he belonged to someone else.",
        "Michael: Well, we really believed Tommy was an orphan, you know? We didn't think he had any parents. You know, so we took him into our house and we treated him like he was our own.",
        "Todd: Right, and then you found out he was mine, and you said to yourself, \"Well, you know, Todd's got two other kids. The hell with him.\"",
        "Michael: Huh. You know, what happened is a terrible tragedy, you know? I mean, if you think for one second that I didn't care about what you were going through, you're dead wrong, man. Now, I wish that we had all known the truth from the beginning. I wish that you didn't have to spend a year thinking that your son was dead. But I don't regret one moment that I spent with that boy. You know, he taught me that I love being a father. I will never, ever regret loving him. Look, I know that I don't have any rights anymore. But I'm appealing to you, you know, father to father. Do right by the kid, hmm? Be the father the kid deserves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: They catch Marcie in a roadblock, she goes in the system.",
        "Warren: I don't know what else to do.",
        "Lee: I do.",
        "John: What's going on, lee?",
        "Lee: Lee Ramsey, Special Agent.",
        "John: Been a long time.",
        "Lee: Yeah, you miss me?",
        "John: Hmm. I see you finally got that promotion you wanted.",
        "Lee: Yes, and I see you screwed up again -- lost your badge. That why you called in your old pal warren?",
        "Warren: Whoa -- how about we work this case together?",
        "Lee: No, you are off this case as of this moment -- and subject to disciplinary action for sharing details of a federal investigation with civilian.",
        "John: Well, no, not exactly a civilian. I didn't bring my resume, but I was an agent and a police officer.",
        "Lee: You are a suspended police officer with ties to the perp, and if you come within one inch of this case, I will fix it so that you never, ever wear a badge again, I guarantee that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Layla and I were not talking about you, it just came up -- that's all -- when she was fiddling with my bra.",
        "Cristian: Excuse me?",
        "[Sarah laughs]",
        "Sarah: She was using me for a fitting -- for exposed. Great bra.",
        "Cristian: All right, all right, come on, let's not get off the subject here. Why were you talking to Layla about Evangeline and me?",
        "Sarah: It just happened, ok? We were talking about Timbaland and how great the concert was, how good it was for Capricorn and you --",
        "Cristian: And all that got you started talking about Evangeline?",
        "Sarah: I brought it up.",
        "Cristian: Why?",
        "Sarah: The day of the concert, I overheard you talking to her mom, and it seemed like you really wished Evangeline was there with you.",
        "Cristian: That's right. I was wishing she was there because she is very important to me.",
        "Sarah: So, Layla said that you two were broken up at the time of the accident.",
        "Cristian: That's true, too. The accident was in my place, and Evangeline was there because I asked her to come over and look at some stuff I was working on. So that kind of makes me responsible.",
        "Sarah: And you're still in love with her?",
        "Cristian: You know, you ask a lot of questions.",
        "Sarah: And you evade a lot of questions. Why'd you stop boxing?",
        "Cristian: I hurt my hand.",
        "Sarah: Do you miss it? Or is that another question that you're not going to answer?",
        "[Cristian chuckles]",
        "Cristian: Yes, I miss it -- sometimes. The ring was a place where I felt completely honest, and nothing else in the world mattered. It was mine, and no one else's.",
        "Sarah: Like me and my singing.",
        "Cristian: Hmm, look at that. It seems like we both know what it's like to lose something we care about.",
        "Sarah: And now, we both have to find something new to care about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Don't be upset with Shaun. This is my fault, all of it. Ugh.",
        "Antonio: How?",
        "Shaun: She started this. She flirted with me at the bar --",
        "Talia: Ok, I never flirted with you. I -- I was friendly. Friendly, that's all.",
        "Shaun: Fine, if that's how you saw it. And what she meant by it, you know, getting out of hand, is -- it did get more serious than we both thought it was going to. Right, Talia?",
        "Talia: Um -- that's the story, pretty much.",
        "Antonio: Look, you don't have to say all this in front of people, you know? I mean, I -- it only came up because -- because of the way Shaun was treating you.",
        "Talia: What do you mean?",
        "Shaun: Antonio didn't like the way I was putting the moves on the other girl. That's the thing. I just can't be with one girl. It's the way I'm wired.",
        "Talia: Wait -- um -- are you breaking up with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Eagles game plays]",
        "Jessica: You can't do this.",
        "Natalie: I just did.",
        "Nash: Why?",
        "Jessica: Natalie, you don't have to give Jared a contract. We already told you that.",
        "Natalie: I know I don't have to. I want to.",
        "Jared: Let me see that.",
        "Boy: Yeah, Donovan, you're the man!",
        "Jared: Oh, did they win?",
        "Boy: D-Mac is the man! Gles going all the way!",
        "[Jessica turns off TV]",
        "Jared: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",
        "Jessica: Now you're going all the way out -- goodbye.",
        "Boy: Huh. See ya.",
        "Jessica: Goodbye.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Natalie: So --",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: This is your agreement. You get your job back, and you agree not to press any charges against my sister, or anyone in my family. And what happened with Tess two years ago -- it's all in the past",
        "Nash: Don't cave, Natalie. We can handle this.",
        "Natalie: Well?",
        "Jared: I want some additional perks.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",

        "Natalie: Like what?",
        "Jared: My own office.",
        "Natalie: Your own cubicle.",
        "Jared: And three weeks paid vacation.",
        "Natalie: Two weeks paid vacation, and a third only if you're still around in a year. So, are you going to sign this so we can get on with it?",
        "Jared: Hmm. Sorry.",

        "Ron: These are for you and Tommy.",
        "Marcie: Passports?",
        "Ron: Yeah. And a Florida drivers license. From now on, you're Aaron and Penny Shaw.",
        "Marcie: Penny Shaw? How did -- how did --",
        "Ron: Don't worry about it. I'm in construction. I meet people, ok?",
        "Marcie: But, Ronnie, I don't know --",

        "Warren: I know Ramsey's a hard-ass, and I know you two have a bad history, but he's not going to see the human side of this case. I'm sorry.",

        "Blair: So you're actually thinking about how Todd feels?",
        "Marty: Well, my son is in love with his daughter, and I think she's a great girl, so, yes. So, Blair, you know what? I think whatever our differences are, that we could at least --",
        "Blair: Oh, and they have been many differences.",
        "Marty: Yes, they are, but I think in this one instance, you and I can agree -- we would both do anything to protect our children.",
        "Blair: Any decent parent would.",
        "Marty: Well, then can you have a little compassion for Michael? I mean, how do you think it has been for him knowing what would happen -- if he told the truth, they would take his son away from him? And Marcie, what she is feeling right now knowing that is exactly what's going to happen -- they are going to take her son away from her.",
        "Blair: Look, how I feel is irrelevant here.",
        "Marty: Why?",
        "Blair: Because I can't tell Todd how to deal with Michael and Marcie. I mean, just think about it. I mean, what if it was Cole? What if some very, very nice woman took your son and ran away? Now, could you stand there while some well- meaning person told you to have a little compassion, a little heart? I don't think so. Nothing matters until Todd and his son are together once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What the hell's your brother doing in there? What's taking so long?",
        "Michael: What do you think he's doing? He's looking for evidence that will lead us to my -- Marcie and Tommy.",
        "Todd: Yeah, or he's burying it.",

        "Todd: He did it before.",

        "Todd: He knew my son was living with you and he suppressed it. Yeah, but he's not going to do it again.",

        "Lee: All right, let's go -- Rocco's garage now. And, John, if you don't want to end up in federal custody, you'll be here when I get back. Search -- keep an eye on him, all right?",
        "John: Hey, Marcie's not some kind of hardened criminal. Don't treat her like one.",

        "Ron: Yeah, but I'm still your big brother, and I will always worry about you.",
        "Marcie: Well, don't worry about me, ok? Don't because if you w I'm going to worry and then I'm not going to be able to do what I need to do.",
        "Ron: Ok, ok, ok.",
        "Rocco: I'll be in the back, all right?",
        "Ron: All right. Thanks, Rocco. Here -- I want you to take this. It's not much, but it'll definitely give you and Tommy -- Aaron -- a new start in life, and the passports are for when you need to leave the country, ok?",
        "Marcie: I'll pay you back.",
        "Ron: No. Don't even try doing that. They might trace it to me, so don't.",

        "Marcie: But maybe, you know, maybe someday I'll be able to --",
        "Ron: But maybe not. So maybe we should make this goodbye last a lifetime -- what do you think? Hey.",
        "Marcie: Can you say goodbye to Dad? And to Eric and even Jerry, who I hate.",
        "Ron: I will.",
        "Marcie: Because I love them -- you know that.",
        "Ron: Yeah. I will. I will.",
        "Marcie: Ronnie, I -- I really don't know how to thank you for all this -- you know, for everything that you've done, and I -- I just -- thank you.",

        "Talia: Hey, you know what, Layla? It's cool. Um -- I understand what Shaun's saying and I agree. We've had some good times, a few laughs, but in the long run, it wouldn't have worked out for reasons we both understand.",
        "Antonio: Well, you two -- you seem to know what you're doing, obviously. But I got to say, Shaun, that -- that you are losing one terrific woman.",

        "Talia: Um -- ok. You know, I -- I know I told you that I thought I was really starting to fall for Shaun. But I think I was trying to convince myself that was true, you know? So, breaking up was inevitable, I guess.",
        "Antonio: Well, I -- I have a confession.",

        "Natalie: I fired you because you are a backstabbing phony, and I can't stand you.",

        "Nash: All right, it's ok, it's ok. You know what? It's been my experience that when a guy wants everyone to know that he slept with someone, usually it's because it doesn't happen that often. Hey -- how was jail? How long were you there for? Tell us. And let you guys cool off, ok? Oh, and while I'm gone, don't get any crazy ideas and change the locks. I like you guys and I'd hate to have you evicted. But I do own the place.",
