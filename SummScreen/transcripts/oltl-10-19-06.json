        "The judge orders counsel into chambers. Todd feels that Spencer being a Buchanan is just another reason to hate him. Bo wants proof but Spencer will not hand that to him on a silver platter. He tells how Asa had an affair with Emma and that was how he came to be. Blair thinks that this is sick and she stomps out of the room. Rex begs Adriana not to go through with this plan to get back at Dorian, but she is determined to make her mother pay. She promises not to take things too far. After Rex leaves, Adriana sees that Layla is in the living room still staring at the flowers that Vincent sent. She feels bad for her friend. \"Oh don't pretend. I know that your boyfriend is trying to get dirt on mine!\" Adriana is shocked by Layla's outburst. Layla says that it isn't fair that Adriana gets a second chance at love with Rex, while she doesn't. Adriana is surprised by what she hears in the girl's voice. \"Love? You are in love with Vincent?\" Rex catches up with a source in the park. Mick had some dirty dealings with Spencer but it was too much for him to handle. \"They guy liked kids. There was this baby I seen him with once.\" Mick tells how he did a job for Truman where he took this Cochrane chick to the airport. Later, Mick wanted to make a few bucks and hit Spencer up for some work. When he arrived at Spencer's place, he saw the man coming out with a baby. He got in a car for a few minutes and then got out alone. The car drove off with the baby. Nash comes to Antonio and Jessica to thank them properly for being so cool about everything lately. He can get over Tess but he needs Jessica to do something for him first. Mick can't remember the car that Spencer was sitting in the night the baby was taken away but he runs to get a friend who may recollect. Rex turns and finds Marcie walking in the park with Tommy. He is happy of the child's adoption and hopes that he will be able to get another little guy back where he belongs. Rex is surprised to find Blair at Todd's place when he arrives to give him news. Blair eavesdrops from the stairs and hears about Todd trying to find his baby. Adriana tells the manager at Dorian's getaway that she will not be coming. Clint shows up and is seated. Viki arrives thinking that she is about to meet whoever wants to take over her paper. She becomes the other guest for the romantic evening to her surprise. She and Clint stare at each other confused. Dorian is dressed for her date and when she heads into the closet for the finishing touch, a hand pushes her in and closes the door. It is Adriana and she smiles knowing that she has ruined her mother's night with Clint."

        "Antonio: Ah. All right, drop everything. We're eloping. All right? Anywhere you want to go. We got you, me, the dress --",
        "Jessica: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second. This isn't the dress, this is a reject, ok? And you told me -- you promised me that the wedding gown is the one thing that I could keep a secret, so what's wrong? What's all this eloping stuff?",
        "Antonio: Um -- well, when -- you know when I said, you know, full disclosure with Nash?",
        "Jessica: What happened?",
        "Antonio: Yesterday, I -- ahem -- I gave him a cold shower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Hey, Nash. Hey, man, if you're here for a drink, I'm sorry, you are out of luck. The joint's closing for a private party.",
        "Nash: A drink. Is Antonio here?",
        "Vincent: No. No, I didn't see him.",
        "Nash: Well, why are you here?",
        "Vincent: Oh, me? I'm just relaxing in between appointments. Speaking of which -- I dropped by the vineyard.",
        "Nash: Yeah. I'm going to get back to work on that place today. Don't worry, your money's safe.",
        "Vincent: I always get paid. There's just the fact that I thought the vineyard was, like, this labor of love for you.",
        "Nash: It is. I just ran into a small, minor, personal problem, that's all.",
        "Vincent: I can relate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: How could you do this?",
        "Adriana: Door-to-door service? You're spoiling me. You coming in?",
        "Rex: I can't. Working.",
        "Adriana: Hmm. Did you find any evidence that Vincent set up Cristian?",
        "Rex: That case is about to break any second. Right now, I'm working on something for Todd.",
        "Adriana: Ok. I'm working on my own case today, too -- operation take down Dorian -- and it's about to break any second, just like yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Victoria Davidson. What hostile takeover? That's ridiculous. No, no, no. No, set up the meeting and find out everything you can. Oh, I'll be very pleased to tell him \"The Banner\" is not for sale.",
        "Spencer: I believe you need to know this, as well, your honor. My biological father is Asa Buchanan. I guess that makes me one of you Buchanan boys now, doesn't it?",
        "Clint: That's a lie!",
        "Natalie: Go to hell, you son of a bitch!",
        "[Judge pounds gavel]",
        "Judge: The next word out of anybody's mouth earns them a $1,000 fine. Counsel, in my chambers, now, the both of you.",
        "Bo: You ready to back that statement with proof?",
        "Spencer: Oh, you bet I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Ok, \"take down Dorian.\" It's sleek, catchy, to the point. Thing is, I'm still not liking the actual case.",
        "Adriana: Once again, she got a stalker after me to try to break us up.",
        "Rex: She deserves a taste of her own strychnine. I get it. But Dorian's your mom. You don't really want to see her hurt.",
        "Adriana: I love when you get all serious and protective. So old school. So sexy.",
        "Rex: I'm serious, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: I know. And sexy.",
        "Rex: Promise me you won't do anything extreme.",
        "Adriana: Convent girl's honor. Now get out of here, working boy. [Adriana giggles] Oh. Oh, Layla, I shouldn't have stayed over at Rex's last night. I should have been here for you. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: That's funny. You're here with me while your boyfriend's out to get mine.",
        "Adriana: What?",
        "Layla: Don't act like you don't know. Rex is digging up dirt to get Vincent put away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: You know, the heat wave this summer -- damaged half your yield.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I did. Huh. These are pictures of my vineyard in Napa. What, did you rent a helicopter? Do a little flyby?",
        "Vincent: I did my research.",
        "Nash: Well, then you should know that the wine industry is full of risk.",
        "Vincent: Oh, I like risk. The calculated kind. But I just hope that these problems that you're having won't prevent you from making your first loan payment.",
        "Nash: It won't. And as for my personal problems -- well, I know what I need to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Oh, ok. I still don't see how the cold shower really fits in here.",
        "Antonio: Well, I -- I felt sorry for the guy, so I got him over to his hotel, I tossed him in a cold shower to sober up, but not before he picked a fight with Cristian.",
        "Jessica: He had a fight with Cristian? Oh, my God -- was he hurt?",
        "Antonio: No, barely a scratch.",
        "Jessica: Oh, good.",
        "Antonio: I mean, Cristian mostly held off.",
        "Jessica: Good. I -- why Cristian? He barely even knows him?",
        "Antonio: Well, he's my brother. That's all he needed. And he's lucky it was Cristian. I mean, another guy wouldn't have held off.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I know. What was he thinking?",
        "Antonio: He's -- he's in a tailspin right now, you know? And, I mean, I can completely relate. It was just like when I was -- you know, when I found out that I was Manuel Santi's son. I mean, it doesn't matter what you do. It doesn't seem like you can pull yourself out.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but you got through it.",
        "Antonio: Well, yeah, but I -- you know, I had you and I had Jamie.",
        "Jessica: He doesn't have Tess.",
        "Antonio: Oh, but he does have Bree, honey. And, you know, if he -- if he allows her to be, that little girl could be his salvation.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. God, it's so frustrating, you know? I can't help Nash, I can't help Natalie. She must be going through hell right now because of Spencer Truman hearing.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, yeah. But you know, this might help her. You know, honoring John and following through with -- with his father's case.",
        "Jessica: Or it might make things worse.",
        "Antonio: Right. No, she has to do this, honey. For John. And besides, you know, hearings like this -- they're usually cut and dry. No surprises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spencer: Just because I have proof doesn't mean I have to hand it to you on a silver platter, Bo. The Buchanans always think everything has to be handed to them on a silver platter. Not this time.",
        "Todd: I tell you, if this bastard's a Buchanan, that's one more reason to hate him.",
        "Natalie: Is this some kind of legal stunt?",
        "Evangeline: First I've heard of it.",
        "Clint: You know, you're not the first grifter to go after our family's good name.",
        "Spencer: Here's a name for you -- Emma Bradley.",
        "Bo: Is that supposed to mean something to us?",
        "Spencer: She's my mother. Asa had an affair with her. He admitted it to me and David, as well.",
        "Clint: Oh, Vickers, yeah, of course. How many families has he tried to fleece?",
        "Kevin: Come on, David's a con man, Spencer's a murderer. Who knows what kind of psycho this Emma Bradley is?",
        "Spencer: Hey, you watch your mouth. You watch what you have to say about my mother, you understand?",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah? Or what?",
        "Spencer: Ah, yes. The famed Buchanan solidarity. Too bad Duke's not here to pile on, huh?",
        "Viki: You are a monster.",
        "Todd: Unbelievable.",
        "Blair: You're sick. And you'll never go near my children again.",
        "Dorian: Blair --",
        "Blair: It's all right.",
        "Kevin: Is that why you tried to destroy Kelly and me? Because you -- you thought I was family?",
        "Spencer: Asa Buchanan's my father. That's all I have to say.",
        "Clint: No, you are just the bitter kid of some woman my father dumped. And if you think you're going to cash in on it, think again.",
        "Bo: You know, there's a simple way to prove whether or not you are a Buchanan. A DNA test will tell us if you're pa's son.",
        "Spencer: Well, bring it on. Let's do it.",
        "Natalie: There's no way that man could be my uncle. He put John through hell.",
        "Michael: I don't care who he is. I don't care who his dad is! He killed my father, and I want him to rot!",
        "Marcie: Michael -- Michael -- Michael, please -- Tommy's starting to fuss, ok? I don't think all the stress can be good for him.",
        "Michael: Ok, you're right. You know what? You go home.",
        "Marcie: Are you sure?",
        "Michael: Yeah, you go home. I got to go to the hospital. I got to check things out. And when I'm done, I'll be right home to you, ok?",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Michael: I love you, sweetie.",
        "Marcie: I love you, too. You'll be ok?",
        "Evangeline: Hey.",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "Evangeline: You should probably go check on Blair. She looked upset.",
        "Todd: Yeah. She laid down with the devil. She'll have to deal with the demons. What's going on in the chambers?",
        "Evangeline: The defense is probably moving to dismiss the case.",
        "Todd: On what grounds?",
        "Evangeline: False arrest.",
        "Todd: Oh --",
        "Evangeline: Spencer Truman, as such, doesn't exist.",
        "Todd: That is insane.",
        "Evangeline: It won't work, I guarantee. But it will buy the defense time to come up with their next strategy.",
        "David: Well, so much for keeping quiet about Spencer's gene pool.",
        "Dorian: Stay away from me. I can't help you. Go.",
        "David: What are you -- you're the one who told me I should wait until he was convicted before I made a play for the money.",
        "Dorian: So help me, if you say that out loud one more time, I will sue you.",
        "David: For what? Dryer lint?",
        "Dorian: I'll wring your neck, ok? Now, stay away from me. I have to focus on Clint.",
        "David: Well --",
        "Dorian: Oh.",
        "Kevin: Listen, I'm going to call Grandpa, try to get some answers.",
        "Bo: I'll let you know if anything happens.",
        "Kevin: All right.",
        "Spencer: Hey, Kevin, maybe we can have a laugh about this over thanksgiving dinner someday, huh?",
        "Bo: You're going to be eating the rest of your Thanksgiving dinners in Statesville Prison.",
        "Spencer: We'll see about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: When were you going to tell me about Rex's latest case?",
        "Adriana: Ok, first of all, I just found out about it. Second, Rex isn't out to get Vincent. Cristian hired Rex to get proof that Vincent was behind drugging him at the fight.",
        "Layla: Vincent can go to jail over this.",
        "Adriana: You have to know he did it, Layla. Cris wouldn't accuse him for no reason.",
        "Layla: Well, where's the proof?",
        "Adriana: Look, I know this is hard for you. But my cousin could have been killed during that fight.",
        "Layla: I know! Why do you get to stay with Rex after all the crimes he's committed? Why do you still get to fall in love with him? Why do you still get to give him a second chance? And why can't I --",
        "Adriana: Whoa. Love? Are you saying you're in love with Vincent?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: What's the word?",
        "Shaun: Thunderbird. Ted's keeping his head down. I doubt if he makes you as the guy who fixed the fight.",
        "Vincent: Not if he wants to keep his health, he won't. What?",
        "Shaun: I'm not feeling it, man.",
        "Vincent: I know it was a mistake. I just need to shake this off and move on.",
        "Shaun: Hmm. Amen.",
        "Vincent: But to do that, I can't have anybody connecting me to what happened to Cristian Vega, understood?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Mick? What the -- get off me.",
        "Mick: Just making sure you're not wearing a wire. Now, like I already told the cops, I don't know no Cochran broad.",
        "Rex: Oh, that's funny. Your buddies tell me you got paid to drive Margaret Cochran to the airport, and she got on a plane to Thailand.",
        "Mick: Commish friend tell you that? He's got nothing on me.",
        "Rex: Oh, but I do. You remember that car you stripped down and sold to a drug dealer in Philly? Now, either you talk to me, or practice touching your toes, because you're in for a hell of a stretch if I tell the cops what I know.",
        "Mick: What do you want from me?",
        "Rex: What other jobs did you do for Spencer Truman?",
        "Mick: I didn't do nothing else. I swear. I thought about hitting up Truman for more dough. But that guy's into stuff I don't touch.",
        "Rex: Like what?",
        "Mick: Kids.",
        "Rex: You mean babies?",
        "Mick: Yeah, I -- I saw a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Ok, that's great. Yeah, I'll check back tomorrow. Cool.",
        "Jessica: Um -- hey there. You want to help me with this guest list?",
        "Antonio: Why don't we -- why don't we exercise a little first?",
        "Jessica: No. No way. You promised that you'd help me. We have a wedding to plan. We have a guest list, we have a menu, you have your groomsmen --",
        "Antonio: All right, ok. All right, I give up. All right? Anything you want. All right? Just -- just promise me that in the end, you'll say \"I do.\"",
        "Jessica: I promise.",
        "Antonio: Ahem. All right, I do have one question, though.",
        "Jessica: Ok.",
        "Antonio: Um -- ahem -- uh, why -- why is this dress a reject?",
        "Jessica: Well, why do you think? The neckline, the hemline, the glittery stuff.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, a little too Tess?",
        "Jessica: Yes --",
        "Antonio: Yeah?",
        "Jessica: A little too Tess.",
        "Antonio: All right, well -- [Knock on door] I do kind of like the back, though.",
        "Jessica: Give that to me. Get the door.",
        "Antonio: All right. Who could this be?",
        "Nash: Hey. I am stone-cold sober. I promise.",
        "Antonio: Come in.",
        "Nash: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no, she's napping. Sorry.",
        "Nash: My loss. It's all right. It's not why I came here, anyway. Hmm. I -- I came by to apologize to both of you. I'm sorry for what happened outside of Rodi's. It was wrong, wrong, wrong. Antonio --",
        "Antonio: You don't have to do this, Nash.",
        "Nash: Unfortunately, I do. You got me out of Rodi's, you sobered me up, and you didn't bust me for -- it's a little bit foggy, but whatever it was that went down with your brother. Thank you.",
        "Antonio: Look, you -- you being locked up would do Bree no good.",
        "Nash: Yeah, that's the other thing. Thank you for putting my daughter first. I want to do that, too. I mean, you -- you see, for me, it's always been Tess and my daughter, not Tess and Brennan. And now that Tess is gone, I'm trying to accept that. I miss her. But I got to move on. I can't keep waiting for her if I'm going to be the father that Brennan deserves.",
        "Jessica: You can do this.",
        "Nash: Yeah, I can. I can. But if I'm -- if I'm going to let go of Tess and move on, I need something from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Layla: We were talking about whether Vincent is guilty or not. What's love got to do with it?",
        "Adriana: Uh -- you're the one who compared me and Rex to you and Vincent.",
        "Layla: Well, didn't Rex try to frame your mother f murder or something?",
        "Adriana: And you know what? After what she put me through, I wish he would have succeeded. But that is beside the point. Because since we got together, Rex has done nothing but try to help people.",
        "Layla: Oh. Oh, I get it. So it's cool for your boyfriend to be a bad boy, but not mine?",
        "Adriana: Wake up, Layla! The whole time Vincent was dating you, he was putting your sister's boyfriend at risk -- for money. You would move mountains for Evangeline. How can you let him get away with that?",
        "Layla: You're right. We're done. We have to be.",
        "Adriana: Then why are you keeping his flowers?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: All right, from the top. Where did he pick up Margaret Cochran?",
        "Mick: Near the warehouse district. Looked too classy for the place.",
        "Rex: Ah, some chicks like to slum it.",
        "Mick: So we get there, Truman pays me, then he walks the Cochran chick to my car. Right away, I noticed she looked a little out of it.",
        "Rex: Like maybe she was drugged?",
        "Mick: Truman's a doctor. He can score anything.",
        "Rex: No doubt.",
        "Mick: So I get her to the airport, easy Breezy, and I took off to do a little partying with my crew.",
        "Rex: Well, you earned it.",
        "Mick: You said it. So, a week or so later, I decided to hit up Truman again. The guy's a big-shot doctor. I figured I -- I undersold myself. So a couple of guys and me -- we -- we swing back by the place. We see him coming out with this baby.",
        "Rex: What time of year was this?",
        "Mick: Winter. There was snow on the ground.",
        "Rex: All right, now this is very important. When did Spencer take the kid?",
        "Mick: Into a parked car. And get this. Five minutes later, he hops back out, minus the bambino. The car just drove away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Spencer better not use the Buchanan name to beat this thing.",
        "Evangeline: That family would eat glass before they'd help him. And even if they did, Nora's too good a D.A. to let that fly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: You know, from the first time I met him, I knew there was something I didn't trust.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "David: Maybe it's the faint scent of sulfur that always travels in his wake. You get it? Satan?",
        "Bo: Vickers, this is a private conversation.",
        "David: Well, then maybe you don't want to hear what our mother told Spencer on her deathbed.",
        "Spencer: Be careful, David. You don't want to be airing out my family's dirty laundry in public, now, do we?",
        "Clint: Truman, shut up! You're not a part of my family, and you never will be.",
        "Spencer: Don't be making promises you can't keep, now, big brother.",
        "Kevin: Hey, Bo, Grandpa was resting. I didn't want to wake him up, you know, with his heart.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Well, you made the right call. We'll -- we'll talk to Pa later and see if we can figure this whole thing out.",
        "Bailiff: Order, please. Will everyone please rise? The honorable Judge Fortier now presiding.",
        "Judge: Be seated. After conferring with counsel, I have determined that the defendant's parentage has no bearing on this case. So this hearing will resume. However, may I remind all of you -- this is a preliminary hearing in a murder case. It is not a circus. Its purpose is to establish first if a crime was committed. And second, if that crime could have been committed by the accused. If so ruled, the defendant, Spencer Truman, will stand trial in the court of common pleas for the murder of Thomas McBain. But if the evidence is insufficient, all charges against this defendant will be dismissed.",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Judge: Is counsel ready to proceed?",
        "Stan: We are, your honor.",
        "Nora: The commonwealth is ready, your honor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: I know he hurt you. And I'm so sorry. And I'm going to be here for you tonight with ice cream and chocolate cake and a rag doll named Vincent and a box of straight pins.",
        "Layla: Men suck.",
        "Adriana: You're going to find one that doesn't. Look, I got to run a few errands, but I will back as soon as I can. Are you going to be ok?",
        "Layla: You're going to hang with Rex?",
        "Adriana: No, actually. Planning a little something for Dorian.",
        "Layla: Hmm, hmm, hmm. Mommy dearest better watch out.",
        "Adriana: You know it.",
        "Layla: Love you, girl.",
        "Adriana: You, too.",
        "Layla: Reminder my ass.",
        "Vincent: Hey, sugar bear. Wow, those -- those are almost as gorgeous as you.",
        "Layla: I'm heading out.",
        "Vincent: Really? Where? I'll -- I'll be happy to --",
        "Layla: The trash.",
        "Vincent: I see. Can I come in?",
        "Layla: No.",
        "Vincent: Then I'll say what I have to right here. You know, Layla, you mean a lot to me, and -- I mean, a lot, and I -- I really would hate to see us ruined over some rumor.",
        "Layla: Some rumor?",
        "Vincent: There isn't any proof, is there?",

        "Rex: All right, let me get this straight. Spencer handed the kid off to somebody in a parked car?",
        "Mick: And the car drove off. Now, tell me that's not trafficking.",
        "Rex: All right. I need a make, model, color, license plate.",
        "Mick: It was night.",
        "Rex: Come on, you can make a vehicle blind.",
        "Mick: I was high.",
        "Rex: Don't play me.",
        "Mick: I was. But one of my guys -- he -- he could probably help you out.",
        "Rex: Get him. Got you, Spencer, you smug bastard.",
        "Marcie: Hey, Godfather.",
        "Rex: Mother. [As Vito Corleone] Hey. I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. [Normal voice] Vito Corleone -- \"The Godfather.\" What's wrong?",
        "Marcie: Uh -- I just came from Spencer Truman's hearing.",
        "Rex: And? Somebody shoot the scum?",
        "Marcie: Unfortunately not. But he did just announce that he's Asa Buchanan's son.",
        "Rex: Get out!",
        "Marcie: I'm serious.",
        "Rex: Truman, a Buchanan?",

        "Marcie: Oh, look, I forgot to tell you that -- with all the craziness that's going on -- Michael and I -- we're officially Tommy's parents.",
        "Rex: Huh, that's awesome. I'm very happy for you guys.",
        "Marcie: Thanks.",
        "Rex: You found the right family, little guy. Let's hope I can get another little guy back where he belongs.",

        "Judge: Are we ready?",
        "Nora: Yes, your honor. The commonwealth is ready. We've built a very strong case against dr. Spencer Truman based on solid fact. The first fact -- officer Thomas McBain was murdered. That has already been established. What we will show is that dr. Spencer Truman fired the fatal shot, and in so doing, took the life of not only a husband and a father, but an officer of the law. Exhibit A -- the bullet fragment that was removed from officer Thomas McBain during his surgery. Ballistics done by Llanview Police Department proves that this gun, Exhibit B, was the weapon that fired the fatal bullet. Exhibit --",
        "Judge: Please go on.",
        "Nora: Exhibit C -- Exhibit C -- photograph, your honor. Verified by the brother of the defendant. This photograph -- graph depicts the defendant and his father, Ned Truman. See here? It shows that they're holding identical, matching pistols. The same make and caliber of the murder weapon that you just saw.",
        "Judge: Are you all right, counselor?",
        "Nora: I'm fine, your honor, thank you. The commonwealth will prove that both guns ultimately belonged to the defendant, as they were gifts from his father. We also have a witness that places the defendant in the alley where Thomas McBain was shot only moments after the shooting occurred. And lastly, the defendant has linked himself irrevocably to the murder weapon by brandishing it in a standoff with the Llanview Police Department. Exhibit D, the report on that incident, proving that Spencer Truman was in possession of the murder weapon both prior to the shooting, as well as after. We have nothing further, your honor. Oh, but if the defense has any questions about any of our evidence, we're happy to bring forth witnesses.",
        "Bo: Are you ok?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, you ok?",
        "Nora: Oh, I'm fine.",
        "Evangeline: You're doing great.",
        "Stan: Rock-solid fact? Where? I don't see any. There was no witness to the murder of officer Thomas McBain. There was no witness who can place the gun in my client's hand at the time of the murder or any other time during the day. My client has spent his life saving lives, not ending them. I move to dismiss the case on the grounds of insufficient evidence.",
        "Natalie: No, no, the bastard did it. He did it!",
        "Judge: I am warning you --",
        "Viki: You're not helping. Sit down.",
        "Judge: I have heard both sides, and I see no reason to deliberate. I do, however, find that there is sufficient probable cause for the defendant to be held over for trial on all charges. The clerk will schedule the arraignment trial at the earliest possible date.",

But -- but not -- don't describe her like some kind of an illness that you had to get rid of, because she was gorgeous and funny. She was a free spirit. I -- I need you to make her real, as real to Bree as she was to me so that she'll know that she was loved, that she was wanted. Because Bree was wanted. All right? To know that she was loved enough that Tess could leave her. You think you can do that for me, Jessica?",
        "Jessica: I can't.",
        "Nash: What?",
        "Jessica: I can't, without your help. You see, I can tell Bree what I know about Tess, about how she lived, but you're the only one that can tell her how she loved.",

        "Todd: Ok. You know, I've done a lot of wrong in my life. A lot more than I've done right. But somehow, being a parent is something I got right, and I think I can be a good parent to this kid. And he's out there somewhere, so he needs to be saved.",
