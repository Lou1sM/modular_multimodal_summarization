        "John: Tell you what, Ramsey -- if I see my brother, I'll think about sending him over. In the meantime, don't pull any more of your crap.",

        "Ron: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Ramsey: Sooner or later, you're going to have to talk about it -- maybe to me, maybe not -- but it's going to happen. I bet you tried to talk her out of it, didn't you? Going AWOL with that baby? I checked you out -- no priors, straight-up guy. I bet you told her to go back to her husband. Hmm? Same thing you're going to tell your brother-in-law when he shows up. Oh.",

        "Ramsey: Or is it?",
        "Ramsey: You fuzzy son of a bitch. Your ass is grass, and your sister put you in the middle of it. Now, you have to ask yourself -- is the middle of it really worth screwing up your whole life? Huh?",

Well, the other happiest day of my life was when you came into our lives \u0096 yes it was. Michael, I want to have a baby. What would you say to that? I mean, look at him. Come on, how cute.",
        "Michael: I'd say this.",

        "Marcie: You know, the day you came into our lives -- no. We did not think we were ready for kids, I'll tell you that much. But the minute -- the minute I held you in my arms, I took you in my arms -- you know what? It didn't matter. None of it mattered because I knew. Oh, Tommy, I knew in an instant that I would love you and that I will always love you. You know that, right?",

She told you, huh? Look, Ron, man, I -- I was trying to protect her, you know? Man, I was going through hell knowing what I knew. I didn't think there was any reason for her to have to go through what I was going through, especially if it was completely unnecessary, you know? And Todd came up missing. Everybody thought he was dead. There was no reason for her to o",
