        "Natalie walks in on Cord and Tina kissing, continues into the parlor anyway, and completely ignores Tina. Finally, she blows up about Tina protecting Tess's secret that Natalie and Jared were locked in the basement. To make up for it, Tina offers to plan Natalie's wedding. Jessica and Ford ponder whether to reveal that John, not Brody, is Liam's father. She feels bad to blindside Brody with the information that another child he thought was his is not. Ford suspects Brody is not as clueless as Jessica thinks he is as he watches Brody and Vimal huddled in a corner. Brody tells Vimal that they need to discuss his suggestion to Shaun Evans that Victor Lord, Jr.'s murderer is a cop.",
        "Dani and Starr wonder what is happening with their father. Dani reveals that she and Nate are in contact again and she want to forgive him. Starr predicts that Nate will want to get back together. Starr says Tom\u00e1s Delgado can get 25 to life for killing Irene Manning, but that she doesn't think he did it. When her visiting time is over, Dani secretly passes the deck of cards that they'd been playing go-fish with to Starr. Blair finds Jack at the Sun preparing a slanderous story about his sister, Starr. Blair tells him that Bo said he would go easy on the obstruction of justice charges if Jack goes to the station and gives a true statement to replace the false one. Todd turns himself in. Nora tells Todd to look her in the eye and sat he didn't kill his brother. Todd concludes that this is personal for Nora and she admits that it is. Nora drops the murder charges for lack of evidence and immediately calls for Todd's arraignment for escaping police custody. As Bo leads Todd out of the DA's office, Blair and Jack enter the station. Jack engages Todd in a death stare. The guard takes Todd to the cell across from Starr."

        "Jessica: I wish I'd never found that stupid test.",
        "Ford: Yeah, but you did. So, what are you gonna do about it? Are you gonna tell them that Brody isn't Liam's father and that John is?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I just spoke to John earlier, and he seemed fine with the way that things are. Brody loves Liam so much. But is this my call?",
        "Ford: Well, here's your chance to find out.",

        "[Keyboard clacking]",
        "Blair: Jack?",
        "Jack: Oh, Mom. I'm glad you're here. What's another word for \"traitor\"?",
        "Blair: What are -- what are you doing here?",
        "Jack: Well, I've been getting a jump on the early edition. What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: Go fish.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Danielle: You said -- well, you asked if I had a 4, so I said, \"Go fish.\"",
        "Starr: Oh, you said, \"Go fish,\" right. Okay. I'm sorry, Dani. I'm so...distracted. I'm just really worried about Dad, you know? He's out there, and I'm stuck in here.",
        "Danielle: Well, I don't know how much help you'd do. I mean, I'm out here, and what am I doing?",
        "Starr: Did you hear anything from your mom?",
        "Danielle: Oh, sure. Not that I believe a word of it. She's been totally lying to me for days.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it's called deniability. She's just trying to protect you. You know, she is a lawyer.",
        "Danielle: Kind of makes me think that she's found him.",
        "Starr: Me? In here? They won't even tell me what time it is. But I'm sure it's a good thing. If your mom is lying to you, it must mean that she's getting Dad to turn himself in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Commissioner, my client is turning himself in, per our agreement.",
        "Bo: And the district attorney's here. She's up to speed.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you'll be dropping the murder charge.",
        "Nora: That depends.",
        "T\u00e9a: On what?",
        "Nora: Hey. Look me in the eye. Tell me you're innocent. Tell me you didn't kill your brother Victor.",
        "Todd: What, are you like a walking lie detector?",
        "Nora: It's been eight years, but I think I can read you. So, go ahead -- tell me that you didn't do it. I'm not vacating the charges until I hear those words.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: You're not very good at playing dumb, Cord. So, if Clint hadn't walked in on us, um... what would have happened?",
        "Cord: It's hard to say what would have happened. Um...I'm thinking probably this, followed by this... and, naturally, that would have led to...this.",
        "Natalie: Oh! [Clears throat]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Jessica: What are you doing here?",
        "Brody: Oh, I just thought I'd come get a drink after work.",
        "Jessica: You okay? You look a little upset.",
        "Brody: John and I kind of got into it at the station a little. It's nothing to worry about. What about you guys? I wasn't expecting to see you together.",
        "Jessica: Oh. Um... we were just --",
        "Ford: Hanging out. Listening to, uh, music.",
        "Brody: Great. Enjoy your evening.",
        "Ford: Well, that was super fun.",
        "Jessica: It's never gonna get better, is it.",
        "Vimal: What can I get you?",
        "Brody: Whiskey shot and a beer.",
        "Vimal: You got it.",
        "Brody: Patel. We need to talk.",
        "Vimal: About what?",
        "Brody: About Victor Lord's murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cord: Wow, look at you. You look great.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs]",
        "Cord: Hey, motherhood certainly agrees with you.",
        "Natalie: Thank you. Today. I mean, you should catch me when Liam hasn't slept all night or his breakfast is in my hair.",
        "Cord: [Chuckles]",
        "Tina: Natalie, it's so good to see you.",
        "Natalie: But I wouldn't trade him for anything because family means everything to me.",
        "Cord: Uh, it's about that time. Why aren't you wrestling him into bed? We can catch up later.",
        "Natalie: Oh, no, we will. I just -- is Mom here?",
        "Tina: No, she's at the Banner. Do you want me to call her?",
        "Natalie: No. [Clears throat] No, if she's at the paper, that means she's probably pretty busy.",
        "Cord: Uh, is there something I can help you with?",
        "Natalie: No, I don't think so. I'm just -- I'm really worried about Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You're not gonna put your sister on the front page of the newspaper.",
        "Jack: Why? It's the news, Mom.",
        "Blair: No, it isn't. It's muckraking, and you know it. And you're better than that, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, like I'm gonna take publishing advice from you. How's craze doing these days?",
        "Blair: You know what? Don't take that tone with me. Don't. What are you doing here, anyway? You should be in school instead of bullying Briggs all day long. And what makes you think you're even qualified to run this newspaper, huh?",
        "Jack: My father wanted me here.",
        "Blair: Victor wouldn't want you to slander your sister on the front of this paper, and you know it.",
        "Jack: I have work to do.",
        "Blair: No, Jack. Come on. Wait, wait. Let's just talk first, all right? I just came back from the police station, where I had a very long talk with Bo Buchanan.",
        "Jack: Let me guess. Shane's gonna walk for knocking me out and pulling a gun on me.",
        "Blair: Now, you're lucky that Bo wants what is best for Shane, 'cause he could just as easily use Shane's statement to haul you in.",
        "Jack: For what?",
        "Blair: For lying to the cops. Shane's statement proves that you gave false evidence. That's obstruction of justice. But Bo says that he would go easy -- easy on you if you just came in and told the truth.",
        "Jack: Yeah? Why would I do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: Jack's testimony will be thrown out, so if Todd does turn himself in, they'll have to drop the charges, right? Got any queens?",
        "Starr: Not in this cell.",
        "Danielle: You'll both be out soon.",
        "Starr: I don't know. My dad's busted out of jail, and I helped him.",
        "Danielle: I still can't believe you did that.",
        "Starr: Why? You busted Matthew out of Warwick.",
        "Danielle: Yeah, I helped a guy in a wheelchair escape from a British boarding school. You held a gun on two guards. Not exactly the same thing. Your turn.",
        "Starr: Oh. You got any 2s?",
        "Danielle: Go fish. So, what do you think's gonna happen? I mean, they can't keep you in jail, can they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: May I remind you that there's no evidence against Todd. He's innocent.",
        "Nora: Yeah, you have to believe that. 'Cause you wouldn't be able to represent him if you didn't, so... and I've been where you are now. I've had the honor of representing Todd Manning when he raped Marty Saybrooke. And he claimed he was innocent then, too. I -- and I fell for it way back then, but I... think I know better now. I want to hear it from you. I want you to tell me that you are innocent, that you didn't do it, that you didn't kill your brother.",
        "Todd: I'm innocent. I did not kill my brother. Satisfied?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Shane and his useless father both got cleared of killing Dad, right?",
        "Blair: Because they didn't do it.",
        "Jack: So that just leaves Scarface! He's guilty. I know it.",
        "Blair: Jack, you made false statements to the police. You're interfering with a criminal investigation.",
        "Jack: Who knows? Maybe I'm helping.",
        "Blair: You could go to prison, son!",
        "Jack: What, like Starr? Like your boyfriend, Tom\u00e1s? Like Scarface? Half this family is in jail, and you're worried about me?",
        "Blair: Yes, I'm worried about you because the story that you told the police is a lie.",
        "Jack: That doesn't mean the ending isn't true. If I hadn't told McBain that Scarface was the killer, he would have let him go. Scarface would be halfway around the world by now.",
        "Blair: You don't know that. He would never leave you kids. He wouldn't do it.",
        "Jack: Yeah? What was the last eight years?",
        "Blair: That wasn't his fault. Now, listen! I know that this is really hard for you to understand. I mean, look what -- look what Starr's going through.",
        "Jack: She volunteered for that.",
        "Blair: She's doing what she thinks is right -- exactly like you are, Jack. But what if you are wrong? What if Todd is innocent?",
        "Jack: What if you're the one who's wrong, Mom? You keep saying Scarface is innocent, but how do you know for sure?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I think this has gone on long enough.",
        "Bo: Nora, do you have grounds for an arrest?",
        "Todd: Is this even about Victor? This is personal for you, isn't it? I'm not the same man I was when I...when I attacked Marty Saybrooke.",
        "Nora: You know, for the last eight years, I actually started to feel sorry for Todd Manning. I mean, his kids were kidnapped, and he was raped. He was actually given a lethal injection. But you are not him. You're still the same guy who terrorized me in a beach house. You're still the same guy who hurts anyone who's unlucky enough to love you. My God, your daughter -- look at her. She's in a jail cell because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: At least I'm finally being arraigned.",
        "Danielle: When?",
        "Starr: Tomorrow morning. My mom posts bail, and then I'll be out of here.",
        "Danielle: As long as they don't try to make an example of you. Mayor Finn's on the news every other day making some nasty statement about our family. And if they bring in those guards to testify...",
        "Starr: What happened to staying positive?",
        "Danielle: I'm sorry. I'm just worried.",
        "Starr: Well, don't be. Right, if worse comes to worst, I'll just tell the judge that I have to get out of here, because it's my sister's 18th birthday.",
        "Danielle: You remembered.",
        "Starr: Why wouldn't I? It's a big deal, Dani. You think that I'd forget?",
        "Danielle: Well, with everything that's going on, I totally wouldn't blame you if you forgot about my birthday?",
        "Starr: Well, I didn't. Hope and I have been planning your present for weeks.",
        "Danielle: You know who else remembered? Nate. He came over with a birthday present, wrapped and everything.",
        "Starr: I thought you didn't want anything to do with him.",
        "Danielle: I didn't. But it's not always easy saying no to your ex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, having trouble with your fianc\u00e9? You know, I am a great listener.",
        "Natalie: I should get going.",
        "Cord: Oh, so soon? You can't even have a night cap with your brother? Hold on.",
        "Tina: You know, he actually managed to find a bottle of bourbon.",
        "Cord: Yes, because there are some people who shouldn't be drinking around here.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, you know, I would love to. It's just that I left Liam with Roxy, and I did promise I would get to him before last call.",
        "Cord: Well, you got to give me a rain check then.",
        "Natalie: For you, anything. Mwah! Oh, good to see you.",
        "Tina: Natalie, stop! There's -- there's something I have to say to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You had a little chat with Shaun Evans?",
        "Vimal: Why not? He's an interesting man.",
        "Brody: You know what? I think you're the interesting one, Vimal. You got to be since Shaun went straight to John McBain and told him your theory -- that Victor's killer was a cop.",
        "Vimal: I didn't mention your name. I just -- I don't think it's right that Todd Manning go down for a murder that we both know he didn't commit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Here we go. Some unleaded bubbly.",
        "Jessica: Um, you can get something a little bit stronger. You know, it's not gonna make me feel uncomfortable.",
        "Ford: Ah, it's okay. I'm the designated driver.",
        "Jessica: So I'll drive.",
        "Ford: Drive, yes. I'm sure your mother would enjoy seeing my clunker in your driveway, or me coming to pick it up tomorrow morning.",
        "Jessica: Look at you, Mr. Responsible.",
        "Ford: To, uh... to making the right decisions.",
        "Jessica: [Sighs] I thought I knew what the right thing was. But if this test is legit, then the right thing would be to tell everybody, right? But then Brody loses another son. How can I do that to him? I mean, he has no idea. He's completely in the dark.",
        "Ford: Are you sure about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: I can see that you're still upset about that misunderstanding a few years ago.",
        "Natalie: Misunderstanding? I almost died. Because of you. You knew that Tess had Jared and me locked in a basement. You didn't do a damn thing about it!",
        "Tina: I feel terrible about that! I mean, I never wanted to hurt you or Jared.",
        "Natalie: Don't -- don't you even say his name!",
        "Cord: Wow, catching up can be fun. Listen, why don't we just go to neutral corners here for a little bit, okay? Just take a time-out?",
        "Tina: Look, I don't want to fight.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, great. 'Cause I don't want to hear another word you have to say!",
        "Cord: Great, then why don't we just drop it, okay?",
        "Natalie: Fabulous idea, 'cause I don't want to hear any more excuses.",
        "Tina: Well, there is no excuse for what I did, all right? I let you down. I know that. I just wish there was a way I could make it up to you.",
        "Natalie: There isn't.",
        "Tina: Yes, there is. I can help you with your wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: It's not like we're dating.",
        "Starr: You hung out and watched a movie together.",
        "Danielle: So what? Lots of people do that. You got any 8s?",
        "Starr: [Sighs] I just want you to be careful.",
        "Danielle: I am. 7s?",
        "Starr: Are you looking at my cards?",
        "Danielle: How can I look at your cards?",
        "Starr: Well, then you're a mind reader.",
        "Danielle: [Laughs]",
        "Starr: I'm not judging Nate, okay? I just don't want anything to happen to you, and... Nate ends up with the wrong people.",
        "Danielle: Like Rick, your record producer. 9s?",
        "Starr: Baz talked me into that situation.",
        "Danielle: Well, do you think that Nate wanted to do a porno? Listen, I'm not making excuses for what he did. Okay, I... I'm just trying to forgive him. Got any 6s?",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Danielle: 'Cause I have a 6.",
        "Starr: Why are you trying to forgive him?",
        "Danielle: Because.",
        "Starr: \"Because\" is not an answer.",
        "Danielle: Why does it matter?",
        "Starr: Because if you forgive him, then he's going to want to get back with you.",
        "Danielle: No, no, we're just friends. That's all. So, any 6s? Go fish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, I'm not the only one that thinks Todd didn't do it. Starr's convinced, and so is T\u00e9a.",
        "Jack: What about the cops? If they thought he was innocent, they would have let him loose a long time ago, but they didn't. He had to break out of jail. What innocent man would do that?",
        "Blair: The only reason he broke out is because he was afraid that Irene was gonna kill us. And she almost did. But once he turns himself in, they're gonna drop the charges. They have to. They're gonna have to let him go because there's no evidence. They only have your statement, which everybody knows isn't true.",
        "Jack: So? That just means I have to keep up the pressure. They'll find more evidence, and then they'll have to convict Scarface.",
        "Blair: Jack, this is not about Todd! You lied to the cops! The cops know it! And if you don't make things right, they're gonna charge you, and it's gonna go on your record! And you know all those wonderful colleges that you and your friends are talking about? Do you think those colleges are gonna accept you?",
        "Jack: Who needs college?",
        "Blair: You need it, son! You need it! You listen to me. With or without you, Todd is gonna get out of jail, and he's gonna come back to work right here. It's over. And I pray to God that you are smart enough to give yourself a second chance. Because all of this, everything that you're doing -- lying to the cops, lashing out at the people that care about you -- do you know who that reminds me of? Hmm? It reminds me of Scarface. Jack, I don't want that life for you. And neither does... neither would your Uncle Victor. Jack! It doesn't mean they both don't love you!",
        "Jack: Let go of me!",
        "Blair: No! I'm never going to.",
        "Jack: How do I get out of this, Mom?",
        "Blair: Oh, God. There's only one way, son. One way. Just tell the truth. Tell the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Do I need to file a complaint with the judge, or is the district attorney quite finished?",
        "Bo: Nora, what's it gonna be?",
        "Nora: I'm dropping the charges. For now. Minute I get more evidence, I'm reinstating.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you so very much. Todd, let's go.",
        "Bo: No. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd's been shot. I need to take him to the hospital.",
        "Nora: No, I'm sorry. He has to be arraigned for escaping police custody. He's not going anywhere tonight.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You want to help me with my wedding?",
        "Tina: Well, come on. Who knows more about weddings than me?",
        "Cord: You sure as hell know how to crash 'em.",
        "Natalie: I think I will have that drink.",
        "Cord: Thatagirl.",
        "Tina: So, you're gonna let me do this?",
        "Natalie: You're serious? I mean, this isn't a joke?",
        "Tina: No, on my honor! Okay. As your mom's sister.",
        "Natalie: I appreciate, uh, the gesture. I just, uh... I think I'm gonna decline. Brody and I will figure it out.",
        "Tina: Are you kidding? No, there is so much work to do. I mean, you already have a baby and a demanding job. There's no way you're gonna be able to deal with all the caterers and photographers and all the dresses and all that kind of stuff. I mean, you'd be so tired, you wouldn't even have fun. So just let me do this, and I'll run everything through your maid of honor.",
        "Natalie: What maid of honor?",
        "Tina: W-w-wait. Y-you don't have a maid of honor?",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Tina: Well, I just assumed it was your sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Do you think that Brody knows? How?",
        "Ford: I don't know. Forget it. It's probably nothing.",
        "Jessica: No. No, there must have been a reason why you're saying that. Look, nobody knows, not even John. I found the test in a dog carrier.",
        "Ford: You're right. Exactly. It doesn't make any sense.",
        "Jessica: So where is this coming from?",
        "Ford: Brody's talking to Vimal Patel.",
        "Jessica: I know who he is.",
        "Ford: Well, he's the guy that changed Ryder's paternity test so it looked like Brody was the father.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but he did that because my dad told him to. Brody had nothing to do with that. He didn't lie. I mean... look, he's made a lot of mistakes, but he's a good person. If he knew that Liam wasn't his, he would say something.",
        "Ford: You're a good person.",
        "Jessica: No! He would say something. He wouldn't do that to Natalie. Or John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: I know -- I know that you wanted to keep the fact that Liam wasn't your child a secret and that you would do anything to keep him and that Victor Lord knew the truth.",
        "Brody: I did not kill Victor Lord. In fact, because of your theory, they had my gun tested. I was cleared.",
        "Vimal: Oh. Oh. Good. Good. I guess, uh... that's that.",
        "Brody: And just so we're clear, I may not have killed anyone that night, but I have taken lives before. Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan.",
        "Vimal: Is that a threat, Officer?",
        "Brody: No, Vimal. It's a fact.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Natalie: I'm sure they will be.",
        "Tina: I don't understand. You're sisters.",
        "Cord: And sometimes sisters have their ups and downs, Tina. Right? Like you and Viki.",
        "Tina: I know. That's why I'm here -- to make things better.",
        "Cord: But you can't force this kind of thing, all right? I-it's a timing thing, and Jessica is just not ready to be part of Natalie's wedding just yet.",
        "Tina: But this is a chance of a lifetime.",
        "Cord: I understand that, and maybe, someday soon, they will patch things up. But right now, it's not the time.",
        "Tina: But why?",
        "Natalie: Because... I'm marrying my sister's ex-fianc\u00e9.",
        "Tina: Oh.",

        "Vimal: What are you gonna do to me, Officer?",

        "Vimal: Yeah, your secret's safe with me.",
        "Brody: Then you got nothing to worry about.",
        "Vimal: Um... may I go?",
        "Brody: Yeah, go on. Get out of here. Hey, Vimal.",

        "Starr: Yes, I did! Hope and I play all the time. Sorry. I have lots of practice.",
        "Danielle: Practice? There's no strategy to Go Fish. It's just luck.",

        "Guard: Time to go, miss.",
        "Danielle: Sir, I just got here.",

        "Danielle: Thanks. He wasn't so bad.",
        "Starr: Not all of them are. It just depends. I think that he feels bad for me, because they took Tom\u00e1s to Statesville.",
        "Danielle: Only until his sentencing.",
        "Starr: Once they sentence him, he could go to Statesville for 25 to life.",
        "Danielle: What?",
        "Starr: It's not going to be good. Dani, he pled guilty to murdering our grandmother. Except...",
        "Danielle: What?",
        "Starr: I'm not sure he did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Okay. I see how this goes. You can't get me on death row, you're gonna watch me die in your holding cell.",
        "Nora: Mm-hmm, you look pretty healthy to me. Obviously, someone's been getting you treatment.",
        "T\u00e9a: My client needs medical attention.",
        "Nora: Okay, well, we can send a physician to his cell. Isn't that standard procedure, Commissioner?",
        "Bo: Yes, it is. Come on, Manning.",
        "Todd: Is this how you two get your jollies these days?",

        "Natalie: Um... my... [Sighs] My best friend just died recently, and since I've had Liam and I've been working a lot, really haven't had time to make new friends.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's getting late. I should probably be getting home. The thought of Tina giving Ryder a late-night feeding --",

        "Ford: Well, he's trying.",
        "Jessica: [Chuckles]",
        "Ford: Uh... you sure you want to sit on that document you found?",
        "Jessica: No. And that's why it'll have to keep. Let's go.",

        "Natalie: Thank you. I mean, thank you. But I don't think that's gonna work.",
        "Tina: Well, why not? You said yourself you don't have time.",
        "Cord: Tina, she said no.",
        "Tina: No! She didn't say no. She said it wasn't a good idea. But you know what? I think -- I think it's a great idea. Don't you want this to be a wonderful day -- a day that you -- you and Brody will remember forever? I-I mean, you're gonna have to write your own vows, but I'll take care of everything else. I'll be the one who deals with the photographers and all the dresses and the flowers and --",
        "Natalie: All right, I get it. I got your point. I don't have time.",

        "Cord: Yes. I am around.",
        "Natalie: Great.",
        "Cord: Take care.",
        "Tina: Yeah, and we'll be talking. I just have to find my swatches.",
        "Natalie: Swatches?",
        "Tina: Well, yeah. I mean... is blue your favorite color? I would think it was 'cause of your eyes being blue and everything?",
        "Natalie: Sure. That's great.",
        "Tina: Yeah, or maybe lavender.",
        "Natalie: Okay, no -- no purple. No purple. You know what? Why don't you two go back to that...whatever you were doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: Is there anything that you need?",
        "Starr: Just to get out of here. And you need to tell Hope that I beat you at Go Fish. She'll laugh because I always lose.",

        "Starr: And can you promise me that you'll have a good time at your birthday tomorrow?",
        "Danielle: You're gonna be there.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but what if something happens? They could postpone the arraignment. They could set bail to a gillion dollars.",
        "Danielle: No, no. Trust me. You'll be home.",

        "T\u00e9a: Todd will have to be arraigned for leaving custody, but the district attorney has graciously offered to drop the murder charge, since there's no evidence that Todd killed his brother?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, that's why we're here. Um...Jack has something to say. Apparently, his head injury was much worse than we thought, and he was mistaken about what he saw that night.",
        "Nora: Is that right, Jack? Were you mistaken again?",
        "Jack: I don't remember Todd hitting me anymore.",
        "Bo: Thompson, could you take the prisoner down, please? Lock him up. We have to amend his statement.",
        "Todd: Thank you, Jack. I do appreciate you finally telling the truth.",
        "Jack: I don't want your thanks. I did this only because I had to. It doesn't mean I think you're innocent.",

        "Cord: Still, it was very nice of you to do that.",

        "Ford: Yeah, it was.",
        "Jessica: You didn't have to walk me to the door, though.",
        "Ford: Hey, I am a gentleman.",
        "Jessica: Yes, you are. You let me work through all my stuff with this paternity test, and you didn't push me, and you didn't call me a terrible person.",
        "Ford: You're not a terrible person. A terrible driver, maybe...",
        "Jessica: Hey! I'm an excellent driver.",
        "Ford: Really? What about that pumpkin over there?",
        "Jessica: That's because I was backing up. And you would have hit it, too, except I would have warned you.",
