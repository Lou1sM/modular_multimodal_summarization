    "Recap": [
        "John knows that Dorian had something to do with Ray Montez getting shot and he questions her. He also notices that Vanessa had a pistol and intended to shoot Ray also. But Cristian defends Vanessa to the cops, explaining that she merely protected her step-daughter from the man who murdered her mother. And Dorian tells John that she backs the woman (Vanessa) who prevented a criminal from taking Langston away from her family. Gigi is not going to accept the fact that Adriana is preventing her from being with Rex. She and Marcie find out from Michael that Rex has been moved to a \"private care facility\" that is in Dorian's living room. And Marcie tells Gigi she can help her find a way to get into the house to be with Rex. Janet, the nurse, tells Todd she found out about Marty's history involving many things including her son Cole who believes his mother is dead. And she knows that Todd raped her. He tells Janet he knows all about her shady history and she better not tell Marty what she knows. Janet has a dilemma on her hands."

        "Gigi: Thank you for meeting me here. I didn't know who else to call.",
        "Marcie: Has Rex gotten worse?",
        "Gigi: I have no idea, thanks to Adriana.",
        "Marcie: Do you want me to go check on him for you?",
        "Gigi: He isn't here, Marcie, because Adriana moved him out of the hospital.",
        "Marcie: What? Where did she take him?",
        "Gigi: I don't know and she's not going to tell me.",
        "Marcie: I don't understand. Why would Adriana move Rex in his condition?",
        "Gigi: To keep me away from him.",
        "Marcie: I don't know.",
        "Gigi: Marcie, the woman blames me for ruining her life. Keeping me away from Rex is her revenge. She's as hateful as her mother.",

        "Blair: There you are, Dorian.",
        "Dorian: He's got a gun! He's got a gun!",

        "Marty: Your grandchild is very photogenic.",
        "Todd: And almost here.",
        "Marty: Oh, I know. The time has gone so quickly. I wonder what Starr's feeling right now.",
        "Todd: She's got to be glad it's almost over. And, you know, she doesn't want to see the kid when it's born.",
        "Marty: This has got to be really hard for her.",
        "Todd: It's the best thing for her and the baby.",
        "Marty: Anyway, I can't stop thinking about baby names.",
        "Todd: Hmm.",
        "Marty: You know what I was thinking? What about Patrick for a boy?",
        "Janet: I've got an idea. How about Cole?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Come on, come on, you okay? Hey, you all right?",
        "Markko: No, Lang, stay here.",
        "John: Vega!",
        "Antonio: Put the gun down now. Now!",
        "Sarah: What is going on?",
        "Blair: Are you all right?",
        "Starr: I'm fine. I'm okay.",
        "John: This is McBain. There's two cars and a bus down at Llanview International Airport. We've got two down with gunshots.",
        "Dorian: Is he dead?",
        "Talia: It's weak, but he still has a pulse.",
        "Vanessa: That's too bad.",
        "Talia: I wouldn't be too disappointed. If the ambulance doesn't get here soon, you're going to be charged with murder.",
        "Cristian: This is Ray Montez, your husband?",
        "Vanessa: Yes.",
        "Cristian: Vanessa, why did you do this?",
        "Vanessa: I couldn't let him hurt Lola. You saw how he was handling her.",
        "Antonio: Okay, that's enough. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay, who hired you? Who hired you?",
        "Man: I'm a pilot, man.",
        "John: Yeah, right. Who hired you to kill Ray Montez?",
        "Man: I don't know what the hell you're talking about, okay? I want a lawyer.",
        "John: Easy, easy, I'm a cop. I'm a cop. We've got an ambulance on the way. Take this prisoner, hold him until backup arrives. Keep an eye on him, all right?",
        "Security Guard: Oh, come on. Come on.",
        "Blair: Are you all right?",
        "John: Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.",
        "Blair: My God, it's a good thing you're such a good shot. Was that a hitman?",
        "John: Yeah. I'm just curious why she did it for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I was thinking that since you work here --",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: That maybe you could have access to his medical records. There's got to be something in there about where she took him.",
        "Marcie: I'm just a volunteer here in pediatrics and I don't have access.",
        "Gigi: What am I going to do? I have to find him, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Well, I -- well, here comes someone who might be able to help, maybe.",
        "Michael: Marcie, is everything all right?",
        "Gigi: Well, um, Michael, I need your help.",
        "Michael: Did Shane have another attack?",
        "Gigi: No, no, no, Shane's fine. Um, it's Rex. You were one of the doctors on his case.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I still am.",
        "Gigi: Okay, so then -- so then you know where Adriana has taken him?",
        "Michael: Yes, I do.",
        "Gigi: Okay, Michael, you've got to tell me where Rex is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Lang, you shouldn't be looking at this.",
        "Cole: I can't believe that woman just picked up the gun and shot Montez like that.",
        "Starr: I believe the guy went to shoot him first.",
        "Cole: But he was dressed like a pilot. Why would --",
        "Starr: Langston, how are you doing?",
        "Langston: I don't get it. She said my uncle was her husband. Why would she shoot her husband?",
        "Markko: I guess it wasn't such a great marriage.",
        "Langston: He never even told me he was married. She's, like, my aunt.",
        "Cole: Langston, that guy was never honest with you.",
        "Langston: He's still my uncle. He didn't deserve to get shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What did you just say?",
        "Janet: I've been listening to Cole Porter on the radio. Cole. That's a nice name, isn't it?",
        "Marty: Oh, Janet, I'm sorry. I don't think you realize that Todd has a bad association with that name.",
        "Janet: Oh, oh, I'm sorry. No, I didn't realize. What bad association?",
        "Todd: Uh, I'm going to get a snack. Do you want a snack?",
        "Marty: Sure.",
        "Todd: Come on -- come on in the kitchen and I'll explain it to you, Janet.",
        "Todd: What are you up to, Janet?",
        "Janet: That's funny; I was going to ask you the same thing.",
        "Todd: I don't play games.",
        "Janet: No, I think you reserve those games for Marty. And they're pretty disgusting games, too.",
        "Todd: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Janet: No, you know I thought Marty was the only one who was suffering a memory loss. I've been doing a little bit of research about her on the web. And nothing about Marty Saybrooke remotely resembles anything you've told me or her. Marty has a teenage son named Cole and that son has been led to believe that his mother is dead.",

        "Blair: Sweetheart, are you sure that you're all right, the baby and everything?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I was just freaked out, that's all.",
        "Blair: Yeah, me, too. Langston, are you okay?",
        "Langston: Uh, yeah, I guess. What are you doing here?",
        "Blair: Well, I was with John when he figured out something might happen here.",
        "Markko: What kind of something?",
        "Blair: He didn't go into the details. As long as you guys are okay, I want you stay right here, okay? I'm going to check with Dorian.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Markko: I wonder what McBain found out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Ambulance is on the way.",
        "Talia: Good, the rate this guy's bleeding, it better be.",
        "John: Hang in there. Anybody know what the hell happened here?",
        "Antonio: We were on our way to Colombia to track down Cristian.",
        "Sarah: But Cristian came off the plane when we got to the gate. He was with this woman and her child.",
        "John: What's your name?",
        "Vanessa: Vanessa Montez. This is Lola, my stepdaughter. Ray Montez is my husband.",
        "John: So what -- you traveled 3,000 miles to put a bullet in him?",
        "Cristian: No, she was running away from that guy. She thought he was out to get her and Lola. She must have gone into some kind of shock when she saw him standing there.",
        "John: Any idea why he would want to hurt his own daughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Hello.",
        "Dorian: Hi.",
        "Blair: It certainly looks like Langston's not heading to Colombia today.",
        "Dorian: Apparently not.",
        "Blair: What did you do, Dorian?",
        "Blair: Dorian, for someone who is so desperate to adopt Langston, you sure are calm, cool, and collected when you find out that, you know, Langston's leaving for Colombia.",
        "Dorian: That was because I knew there was nothing I could do about it. And you know that.",
        "Blair: No, what I know is that you were furious when you found out that Clint was behind all of this. And you told me that you had a plan. And then you met with Jackie McNaughton, that creep. And then, lo and behold, I show up here and there's a hitman at the airport just as Langston's uncle is sending her away.",
        "Dorian: Hmm. Everybody -- all the witnesses in this terminal saw some woman shoot him, okay? I have no idea who she is, but frankly, I'd like to give her a medal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Tell him, Vanessa, you and Lola came to Miami to get away from Montez. This guy is bad news, John. They needed a place to be safe.",
        "John: Well, she seems pretty safe now, doesn't she,",
        "EMT: Clear the patient, please.",
        "Talia: There's a gunshot wound, I was applying pressure as best I could.",
        "Antonio: All right, let's go.",
        "Cristian: Antonio, you don't need to do this.",
        "Antonio: You know the drill.",
        "Vanessa: Wait, what about Lola?",
        "Lola: Please, can I go with Vanessa?",
        "Antonio: Sure. We'll take you with us.",
        "Vanessa: Thank you.",
        "Cristian: I should go with them.",
        "Sarah: Well, then I'm going with you. I let you out of my sight once and I'm not going to let it happen again.",
        "Cristian: You know, the whole time I was gone, all I could think about was you. That's what got me through that. Come on.",
        "Dorian: Oh, honey, I'm so sorry you had to see this. I'm sorry all of you had to. But the EMT and the police seem to have everything in hand, so why don't we all go home now?",
        "John: I don't think so, Dr. Lord. I don't think you're going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Gigi, I'm sorry.",
        "Gigi: Michael. But you have to tell me where Rex is.",
        "Michael: I can't.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Gigi: He would want me to know where he is. He would want me to be there with him.",
        "Rex: As long as Rex is unable to speak for himself, his wife is acting as his custodian. Without her permission, I can't tell you anything. I'm sorry.",
        "Gigi: Michael, you're Rex's doctor. How could it possibly be good for him to be isolated from the people who love him? Adriana's name is on a marriage certificate, so that means she can just do whatever --",
        "Michael: Gigi, try to understand where I am coming from.",
        "Gigi: No, I am going out of my mind, Michael. I'm losing it. Rex needs me. And since Shane found out that Rex is his dad, he hasn't even been able to see him. Rex needs to know how much Shane and I need him. And he needs to hear it from me.",
        "Marcie: It's going to be okay.",
        "Gigi: No, no, it's not. Not if Rex dies and I never get to see him again. Michael, please, please -- think what it would be like if you thought that you might never be able to see the love of your life again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I didn't keep this information from you. You could have found it anytime you wanted.",
        "Janet: Oh, and I would have had if I knew you were lying to Marty about the most important thing in her entire life. She has a son out there who does not know she is alive. My God. My God, what else are you keeping from her?",
        "Todd: Wow. What is this, some high and mighty routine? Give me a break. You had no problem taking Ramsey's money when she went to live with him. When I offered you more money, you had no questions for me either. So why all the sudden so inquisitive, Janet?",
        "John: That's Marty Saybrooke. Her son Cole thinks she's dead. He misses her. And if she's alive and living with Manning, that also means she's living with the man who raped her.",
        "Janet: Look, I would have been upset no matter what. It doesn't matter why I found out.",
        "Todd: You're right. Actually, it doesn't matter. All that matters is what you're going to do with this information.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: John, how lucky we are that you were here.",
        "John: Yeah. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about the man you saw, the man with the gun.",
        "Dorian: No problem. Go right ahead.",
        "John: I think we should do this down at the station, Dr. Lord.",
        "Dorian: Of course. I'll come with you. Blair, I hope you don't mind seeing that the kids get home.",
        "Blair: Sure, I can do that for you.",
        "Dorian: Good. Langston, no matter what happens to your Uncle Ray, it's obvious he's not fit to be your guardian, so I'm going to go down to the court tomorrow and we'll petition to have them name me your guardian. All right, so -- all right. Andiamo.",
        "Blair: So, kids, you -- you want to go home? Let's go home, all right?",
        "Markko: Would it be all right if I took Langston home?",
        "Blair: Langston, is that what you want, sweetheart?",
        "Langston: Yeah, please.",
        "Blair: Okay, all right. Starr, Cole, come with me?",
        "Starr: Yeah. Come here. Oh, I'm so glad you didn't have to get on that plane with him.",
        "Langston: Me, too.",
        "Blair: Come on, sweetie.",
        "Langston: Thank you.",
        "Markko: Think I'm a jerk for being glad what happened kept you from getting on that plane?",
        "Langston: Well, then, I would be one, too, because I feel the same way.",
        "Markko: I'm just so glad this whole nightmare's over.",
        "Langston: I'm not sure that it is.",
        "Markko: You heard what Dr. Lord said.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but I just have a bad feeling. I feel like she didn't just happen to see the man who was about to shoot my Uncle Ray. I think she was expecting him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Interviewing Dorian Lord in regards to the shooting in Llanview airport. And for the record, Dr. Lord, you've waived your right to have an attorney present?",
        "Dorian: And why would I need an attorney? I'm here merely as a witness.",
        "John: Yes, can you tell us what you saw today at the airport?",
        "Dorian: Indeed. I saw a man dressed in a pilot's uniform reach into his jacket and pull out a gun. And that is when I shouted for help.",
        "John: In a crowded airport, a lot of things going on. Can you tell me how you happened to notice this particular man?",
        "Dorian: I have very good eyesight.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "John: Excuse me. What do you got, Thomas? Thank you. Hmm. Dr. Lord, did you know that this man -- the man that you saw -- was a contact killer, a hired gun, so to speak? So the question is how badly did you want to keep Langston away from her uncle?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Everything's going to be all right.",
        "Lola: I'm afraid. We're alone in this country. We have no one to help us here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I don't know what happened to Carlo Hesser after he dumped me in that prison.",
        "Antonio: And gave you Montez's name so that no one could track you down?",
        "Cristian: Antonio, I would never have gotten out of there if Vanessa hadn't gone looking for her husband. She pulled strings, paid people off, did whatever she had to do to get me out of there.",
        "Sarah: Because you promised to get her and that girl out of Colombia.",
        "Cristian: I'm not saying she's a saint, but I am standing here for a reason. And she was scared to death that Montez would come looking for her and Lola after she testified against him at that -- well, his murder trial. Maybe he got wind that she was on her way here and --",
        "Antonio: No, no, he's been in Llanview ever since he left the prison.",
        "Cristian: What?",
        "Antonio: He came here with Jared Banks and was working on some kind of deal with Clint Buchanan.",
        "Sarah: Do we know what my grandpa wanted with Montez?",
        "Antonio: No, no idea, but Montez is not only Vanessa's husband, he's also related to Langston Wilde.",
        "Sarah: So this is just some big coincidence that both Montez and his wife ended up here in Llanview?",
        "Antonio: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: My mom was right, you know. You are -- you were awesome.",
        "Cole: I just spoke to John because of you and Langston.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Cole: When I saw that gun and heard it go off, all I could think about was you and the baby. Is everything okay?",
        "Starr: Oh, yeah, you know, everything's fine now.",
        "Cole: But what do you mean, \"now?\"",
        "Starr: Well, yesterday, I had these contractions.",
        "Cole: Contractions? Doesn't that mean --",
        "Starr: Cole, no, it was, um, it was a false labor.",
        "Cole: So you and the baby are -- you're okay?",
        "Starr: We're fine now. But Dr. Joplin said that I might be having the baby sooner than we thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Marty has a right to know about her son. She needs to know there's someone out there that cares about her.",
        "Todd: She's got someone who cares about her right here.",
        "Janet: You? You raped her! You think that didn't come up on the search? Well, it did in disgusting detail. Now, you tell me what kind of a sick game you are playing with Marty's life. My God, she's falling in love with you.",
        "Todd: So what? I'm falling in love with her, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Sorry, Michael. I shouldn't have put you in this position and --",
        "Michael: No, okay, listen to me. I cannot speak to you specifically about Rex, but I can speak to you in generalities. Sometimes when there's nothing more the doctors can do for a patient, the family decides to move the patient closer to home.",
        "Gigi: Closer to home? Like a private facility closer than Llanview Hospital?",
        "Michael: Or like a very private, exclusive facility with a room for all of the equipment that Rex would need. And with all the comforts of a real home.",
        "Gigi: Are you telling me --",
        "Michael: No, I'm not telling you anything.",
        "Marcie: Thank you, Michael.",
        "Talia: Michael, GSW. Watch it, watch it.",
        "EMT: He's lost a lot of blood.",
        "Second EMT: We were able to stabilize him on the way in.",
        "Michael: Put him in here and call for stat past exam.",
        "Marcie: Did you see that guy?",
        "Gigi: What Michael said makes perfect sense. Adriana would want Rex in a place where she would be calling all the shots.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Beeping]",
        "Adriana: I'll be here with you always.",
        "Blair: Adriana?",
        "Adriana: Did they install the machines properly?",
        "Nurse: Yes, ma'am, and the equipment is all top-of-the-line.",
        "Adriana: Thank you. Good. Excuse me.",
        "Blair: When I left here a couple of hours ago, this was a living room. You want to tell me what's going on here?",
        "Adrian: What does it look like? I'm taking care of my husband.",
        "Blair: In Dorian's living room.",
        "Adriana: It would have been too hard and taken too long to get all the equipment up the stairs.",
        "Blair: I understand that, but I don't understand what is Rex doing here?",
        "Adriana: It was here or a long-term care facility.",
        "Blair: So Rex is that bad.",
        "Adriana: There's nothing more the doctors can do for him, and they don't keep patients like him in the hospital once they've made that decision.",
        "Blair: So they don't --",
        "Adriana: They're not saying that he's not going to wake up. But if he does, it will be on his own. And if he doesn't, I didn't want it happen in one of those places. And Michael McBain said that patients who aren't responding are usually taken care of at home.",
        "Blair: Um, is that what this is really about?",
        "Adriana: He had a name for it. It's called \"palliative treatment.\"",
        "Blair: Oh. Are you sure it's not called \"keeping Rex away from the woman you punched at your wedding?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Adriana took Rex to her mother's big, old mansion. That's what Michael was saying.",
        "Marcie: I think you're right.",
        "Gigi: Well, this is just great. This is just great. Rex is under the same roof as Dorian Lord, and she hates him and me. And have you seen the security around that place? There's no way I can get in there to see him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Is he going to make it?",
        "Michael: There's no way I can tell you that now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: You think there's any chance that Vanessa knew Ray was on his way to Llanview when he left the prison?",
        "Sarah: Well, how could she have known that?",
        "Antonio: I don't know. Maybe he, uh, maybe the warden or, uh, one of the guards knew where Jared Banks was from. That's why she bought your freedom and, uh, asked you to bring her here to Llanview.",
        "Cristian: Both Vanessa and Lola are scared to death of Montez. I mean, why would she go through all the trouble of making phony passports so she can get away from him?",
        "Cop: Excuse me, Detective Vega, should I take her down to be booked?",
        "Antonio: Give me a second. We're going to have to take you into custody, at least until your arraignment.",
        "Vanessa: I will fully cooperate with you. But before he takes me away, I have a favor to ask of Cristian.",

        "Markko: I saw that pilot point that gun at your uncle, I just thought --",
        "Langston: Markko, I don't want to go to Colombia with my uncle, but I don't want him to die, either. I mean, he's the only blood relative I have left.",
        "Markko: Not if what he said to that girl was true. Your uncle said that she was his daughter.",
        "Langston: He did, didn't he? No, but I can't think about that right now. They took Dorian down to the police station. And if she did what we think she might have done, she did it for me. I have to go to her, Markko.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry. I -- I'm really not sure what you're intimating here.",
        "John: I'm not intimating anything. I'm just stating the facts. You wanted to keep Langston with you, right? And you met twice with a man named Jackie McNaughton, who has ties to organized crime.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's because I have always been deeply involved in the rehabilitation of, uh, convicts.",
        "John: Hmm. Being one yourself.",
        "Dorian: Detective McBain, if I really wanted to have Ray Montez shot, why did I call out for help?",
        "John: Hold that thought. Hey, Thomas. Hey, do me a favor. Round up Jack McNaughton and let's bring him down here for questioning, okay? Thanks.",
        "John: It shouldn't take us long to find McNaughton and bring him in for questioning.",
        "Dorian: Wonderful. Then he'll corroborate my story.",
        "John: Well, we'll see, won't we?",
        "Dorian: Yes, we will. You -- you can't even be certain, can you, that -- that man intended to shoot Ray Montez.",
        "John: Oh, he was clearly aiming at him.",
        "Dorian: Oh, really? Then how is it that, uh, everybody at the airport, including me, including you, saw that woman shoot Montez?",
        "John: You don't seem really upset by any of this.",
        "Dorian: I'm not. She stopped a criminal from taking Langston out of the country to Colombia. So as far as I'm concerned, she is my personal hero.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vanessa: Lola doesn't have anybody in this country. Can you please make sure that she's safe while I'm in prison?",
        "Cristian: I'll take care of her.",
        "Lola: No. I want to go with you.",
        "Vanessa: You can't. But it's going to be all right, okay? Cristian's going to take care of you. Be strong for me.",
        "Lola: I'll try.",
        "Antonio: Come on, I'll take you down myself.",
        "Vanessa: Thank you.",
        "Cristian: Listen, Lola, do me a favor. Sit here while I talk to Sarah.",

        "Gigi: Adriana better make sure that Rex has everything he needs.",
        "Marcie: Look, you heard Michael, all right? He is on duty, Adriana can afford all that equipment that he needs to get better, and she can afford around-the- clock nurses. I do not agree with anything the woman has done, but she still does love Rex.",
        "Gigi: There's just so much I have to tell him. But there's no way I'm getting into Dorian Lord's house.",
        "Marcie: Maybe there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: You think I would use my husband's condition to spite Gigi? You must really hate me.",
        "Blair: No, Adriana, I -- I don't hate you. All right, I don't. I know that we've had our differences, but we are family, and I wouldn't wish this on anyone. And I certainly wouldn't wish this on Rex.",
        "Adriana: Thank you. I'm just trying to do what's best for him. The last time he and I spoke -- well, that can't be the last time ever. I have to make sure that he has the best chance of beating this. I'm sorry for inconveniencing all of you, but I am sure my mother will understand.",
        "Blair: Oh, I'm sure your mother has enough on her plate right now. But are you sure that this is the best thing for Rex?",
        "Adriana: You heard the nurse. This equipment is all top-of-the-line, and these two nurses came very highly recommended, and I can be here with him day and night. What?",
        "Blair: You know what? It's nothing. It's not the time to get in a fight with you.",
        "Adriana: When in your life have you ever waited for the appropriate time to say what's on your mind, Blair? Why start now?",
        "Blair: I just don't want you to get your hopes up, Adriana.",
        "Adriana: He's going to recover.",
        "Blair: That's what I mean. If Rex does recover, and that's what we all want -- listen, sweetheart, you two were separated by an ocean. And if he wakes up, it doesn't mean that the two of you are going to get back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You're keeping Marty's son from her. You've lied to her about everything, including the fact that you raped her. And now you are telling me you are falling in love with her?",
        "Todd: What kind of relationship is she going to have with a son she can't even remember?",
        "Janet: That is up to her, not you.",
        "Todd: Well, it's true, I am keeping her from her old life, but I am -- I'm giving her a new one. A better one, I think.",
        "Janet: Oh, don't tell me that. You are doing this for yourself.",
        "Todd: Yes. I'm going to get a new life, too. But, you know, I've already changed. I'm not the man from those articles. You've changed, too, haven't you? I'm sure you've changed since you were Lee Halpern. Who do you think you're dealing with here, Janet? You think I'm stupid enough not to look into your past? So I have a suggestion for you. My suggestion is this. Unless you want the people of Llanview, who you screwed over before, to know you're back in town, I suggest you keep your mouth shut. I assume we understand each other.",
        "Janet: Yes. We understand each other.",

        "Cole: Hey, thank you for telling me about the baby.",
        "Starr: Cole, just because I'm giving the baby to Marcie doesn't mean that you're not still the baby's father.",
        "Cole: I just -- I just can't believe it. I mean, our baby, he or she, is not going to be in there anymore. It's going to be part of this world.",
        "Starr: I know that -- that my decision is always going to be a huge problem for us, but I'm really hoping that we can, you know, be friends.",
        "Cole: Hey, it felt good working together with you, trying to help Langston out.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it felt good to me, too.",
        "Cole: I just -- and I don't know how I'd have got through this last year if it hadn't been for Langston and Markko and you. Especially you. I don't think anyone else could have helped me deal with my mom's death.",

        "Marty: You okay?",
        "Todd: Oh, hey, ha-ha. I've been better.",

        "Starr: Oh, please, I don't blame you. He's such a jerk.",
        "Cole: I just can't believe he -- he was going to ruin Langston's life just for business. And I don't even know if he knows that -- that Ray Montez was shot, and I'm not -- I don't want to be the one to tell him.",
        "Starr: Well, I don't blame you. You know, maybe he -- maybe you should stay here. You know, with a friend.",

        "Marty: Yeah. Okay. It also says it's a Scottish nickname for a person who is clever and wily. I don't think you're that wily.",
