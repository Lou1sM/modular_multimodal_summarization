        "Viki is helping Clint to get better. And right then, he gets a call from Cutter who now has the \"document\" allegedly signed by Rex giving Clint back everything, which Kim previously had but no longer has control over since she's in jail. He tells Clint that he can help him get back everything that Rex has taken in exchange for a percentage of it. Clint is curious to find out about the document and goes to discuss it with Rex. He is surprised to learn that his son no longer wants to fight for control of Clint's money and doesn't even care where the document comes from. he declares that his desire for money and power after Gigi died made him turn his back on his son so he no longer wants or needs it. Clint is surprised and willing to let Rex and Shane stay at his home although he no longer has to. And Cutter is now \"down and out\" with neither Rex nor Clint to help him with his blackmail geared toward the other. The mayor threatens to fire Bo if he does not do things her way, but he is not afraid knowing that doing that could hurt her election. Tom\u00e1s holds firm on taking the rap for Todd although Blair is very upset that he would throw his life away and end any chance they could have together. Yet, feeling responsible for what happened to Todd for the last 8 years, he believes that it's the \"right thing to do.\""

        "Clint: Are you sure about this?",
        "Viki: Absolutely. Come on. This has been a long time coming. I don't think we should waste another minute.",
        "Clint: Yeah. I'm not sure it's a good idea to rush things.",
        "Viki: Hey. There's no time like the present. Come on. You're here. I'm here. We should just do it.",
        "Clint: Don't you think we should talk to a doctor?",
        "Viki: The doctor was the one who recommended it, remember? I think his exact words were \"use it or lose it.\"",
        "Clint: What if I can't do it? It'd be so damn humiliating.",
        "Viki: Oh, no. I'm gonna help you, and you're going to enjoy it. I promise.",
        "Clint: Well, I'm not sure that I can go more than one round.",
        "Viki: Well, we won't know that till we try it, right? Ready?",
        "[Whistle blows]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: Hey. Well! Don't you look all official in Clint Buchanan's old chair. Are you comfy?",
        "Rex: Yeah, it is, actually.",
        "Roxanne: Yeah, well, don't get too used to it.",
        "Rex: What? Why?",
        "Roxanne: Because you're gonna have to give it back -- the chair, the desk, and everything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: [Mimics explosion] Send. [Sighs] It's too bad they had to knock you out. I could use someone to celebrate with. 'Cause my ship's about to come in all right, Clint. Time to ante up, you old bastard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Okay. 9 and 10. That was great!",
        "Clint: Yeah. Wasn't too bad.",
        "Viki: Now drop. Give me 20.",
        "Clint: Seriously?",
        "Viki: [Laughing] You should see the look on your face.",
        "Clint: May I remind you that I am a heart-transplant patient.",
        "Viki: I know that. Okay. Let's do another set.",
        "Clint: You're a harsh taskmaster.",
        "Viki: Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet. Off you go.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Clint: Oh, thank God for my cell phone.",
        "Viki: I knew I should have turned that off.",
        "Clint: [Sighs]",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Clint: Clint Buchanan.",
        "Cutter: Clint! Hey! It's Cutter Wentworth.",
        "Clint: What the hell do you want?",
        "Cutter: How would you like to get your company back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Come in.",
        "Mayor Finn: What the hell's going on?",
        "Bo: Mayor Finn. To what do I owe the pleasure?",
        "Mayor Finn: Do you want to tell me why you dropped the charges against Todd Manning for murdering Victor Lord Jr.?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Todd: You want to take my life, Victor? I'll take yours.",
        "Blair: Todd. Whoo-hoo. Have you not heard a word that I've said here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Hello, gentlemen. Todd and Starr are about to be arraigned for their jailbreak. As soon as that's over, you'll be sentenced.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: T\u00e9a, wait. Shouldn't we talk about my hearing?",
        "T\u00e9a: What is there to discuss? You tied my hands when you pled guilty to Irene Manning's murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Sorry I kind of... checked out for a minute. I'm a little tense.",
        "Blair: Well, you better wake up and start paying attention here.",
        "Starr: Yeah, Mom was saying that maybe the judge will take it easy on us today, because the murder charge was dropped. You never should have been in jail in the first place because you didn't kill Victor.",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Starr: [Winces] Stop!",
        "Blair: Todd! Hey! What on earth is wrong with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: The district attorney and I dropped the charges against Todd Manning due to a lack of evidence.",
        "Mayor Finn: You had an eyewitness.",
        "Bo: That's because Jack Manning recanted his statement. See? We're left with nothing.",
        "Mayor Finn: Well, so, you know, then you should have spent that time more productively and found more evidence.",
        "Bo: No, we never should have brought the charges against Manning in the first place. You pushed us into making an arrest and we had no case.",
        "Mayor Finn: Well, I had no choice.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but you've left Nora and me with no choice, either. And Victor Lord's killer -- he's still out there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I don't know what's going on with me.",
        "Starr: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I'm really worried about you, that's all.",
        "Starr: Well, I can't wait to get home to hope. I mean, I miss her so much.",
        "Blair: And she misses you, too, sweetheart, and you're gonna be home really, really soon, okay? So don't you worry about that.",
        "Starr: Thanks, mom.",
        "Blair: If our daughter spends one more night in jail, I'll never forgive you. You know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: T\u00e9a, I need you to understand why --",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I've tried to understand and I can't. I need you to understand that, as your lawyer, there's very little I can do for you now.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I know that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Do you also know that if you hadn't pled guilty, I could argue that you'd killed Irene in self-defense or to defend Todd or a hundred other reasons, but, no, you tied my hands. You've made it impossible. Now, excuse me. I have to go get Starr and Todd out of jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Finn: If you haven't found another suspect, that's on you, and I strongly object to you and your wife colluding to make this decision without consulting me first.",
        "Bo: What? I'm the commissioner of police. My wife is the district attorney. Now, nowhere in the law or in our job descriptions do I find an obligation for us to consult with you. Now, I'm sure you have work to do in your office. I think you should go there and do that, and I'm gonna do the same thing here. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Roxy, I don't know where you're going with this.",
        "Roxanne: I just told you. Out.",
        "Rex: Okay, look, I have a lot of work to do. I am the majority shareholder of this company, which kind of makes me the boss, so --",
        "Roxanne: So, how's it going for you, honey?",
        "Rex: I don't know. I've barely paid any attention to B.E. in the last few months. Not that I know what to do with it, but I'm trying to learn.",
        "Roxanne: Well, don't learn anything else, 'cause guess what. You're not the boss no more.",
        "Rex: Okay, let's have it. What's this about?",
        "Roxanne: I'm gonna explain it to you. Echo was supposed to do it, but she doesn't have the guts, so I will do it. You know the gun that you were supposed to get rid of? You know the gun that we thought that you used to kill Victor Lord?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Roxanne: Yeah, well, it's a long and complicated story, but I'm gonna leave out the part about Morris. Okay, we can save that for later. Okay, so, the bottom line is the gun has gone AWOL and Echo is just a little too desperate to get it back.",
        "Rex: How desperate?",
        "Roxanne: Well, very desperate, but it wasn't exactly her fault, because do you remember Clint's crazy ex-wife? Well, she wouldn't give the gun back unless you signed a document saying that you would give everything back to Clint Buchanan -- you know, all the stuff that he gave to you in exchange for Gigi's heart?",
        "Rex: Wait, wait, wait. Are you talking about Kim Andrews?",
        "Roxanne: Bingo! Yes, the skanky ex-hoochie-coochie dancer. Yeah, she wanted you to sign everything over back to Clint -- the desk, the house, the company, the cars, the cash, the whole kitchen caboodle.",
        "Rex: Okay, but I never signed any document, so what's the problem?",
        "Roxanne: Well, you didn't sign it, but Echo did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Cutter, what the hell are you babbling about?",
        "Cutter: Clint, are you okay? You sound out of breath.",
        "Clint: I am just fine except for the jackass wasting my time.",
        "Cutter: Clint, whatever you're doing, keep it up, 'cause you're gonna need that vim and vigor when you get back to work -- thanks to me and the opportunity that I have for you.",
        "Clint: Cutter, I'm in the middle of a meeting, so whatever scheme that you're selling me this week, I'm not interested.",
        "Cutter: Clint, I mean it. And not just the company -- the house, the cash, everything that Rex Balsom stole from you. I can return it to its rightful owner, safe and sound.",
        "Clint: You can? How?",
        "Cutter: Check your e-mail. Call me back. [Chuckles] Yes! As soon as that old warhorse sets his eyes on that document, I'm gonna be set for life. It's not exactly champagne, but it'll do for now. To money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Rex?",
        "Roxanne: The bad news is your bionic mommy is a forger, but the good news is she's very, very good at it.",
        "Rex: Yes, I'm aware of Echo's talents. So, where's this document that I supposedly signed?",
        "Roxanne: Okay, well, that's the thing, here, okay? 'Cause Echo was trying to get it back before you even knew the difference, but Kim gave it away. So someone else has it.",
        "Rex: Who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Rex?",
        "Cutter: No. I'm -- I'm Cutter. Remember? I told you.",
        "Stacy: Oh. Right. I'm in a hospital. Oh, there was an accident. My sister died. She died.",
        "Cutter: All right. Okay. Okay, so you remember the accident. Do you remember anything else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Roxy, who has the document with my forged signature?",
        "Roxanne: I don't know. You got me swinging.",
        "Rex: Okay, so, you're telling me that there's this piece of paper just floating around that says I want to give Clint Buchanan back everything I took from him.",
        "Roxanne: That's why I'm trying to warn you.",
        "Rex: Good plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Cutter claims he can return everything that I lost.",
        "Viki: [Laughs] [Laughing] How does he propose to do that?",
        "Clint: Don't know. He told me to check my e-mail.",
        "Viki: Oh, wow, that has got to be one big e-mail.",
        "Clint: Well, it won't hurt to read it. Here it goes.",
        "Viki: Okay. What's his plan?",
        "Clint: It seems he has a document signed by Rex, returning everything to me.",
        "Viki: Oh. Does he really?",
        "Clint: And he's willing to hand it over... for a price.",
        "Viki: Of course he is. Clint! If he has a document, it's obviously a fake.",
        "Clint: Look for yourself.",
        "Viki: [Sighs] Why would Rex sign that?",
        "Clint: I have no idea, but it's interesting.",
        "Viki: No, it's not interesting. It's a scam.",
        "Clint: Like I said, it's interesting.",
        "Viki: Clint, really, you should not be dealing with that man, okay? Cutter Wentworth is a con artist. Do you remember that he sold us our own daughter when Jessica was Tess?",
        "Clint: Yes. Of course, I remember.",
        "Viki: Good. So, you don't want to go near that.",
        "Clint: I think it's worth looking into.",
        "Viki: You cannot be serious.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Finn: You think you can just dismiss me?",
        "Bo: No, I think we've said all we have to say.",
        "Mayor Finn: I disagree. Do you know how I found out that the charges were dropped against Todd Manning? Blanca Morales called me for a comment.",
        "Bo: Okay, I want you to feel free to always direct her calls to this office.",
        "Mayor Finn: No. The point is that you and Nora never should have kept me out of the loop on this. I don't understand. What's going on? Is Nora a little bit jealous because you and I flirt occasionally?",
        "Bo: Kathleen. This is not personal.",
        "Mayor Finn: Yeah. Yeah. Well, if I wasn't consulted, I should have at least been told. I was completely blindsided. I should have had a prepared statement and a press conference to make this announcement.",
        "Bo: That's it, isn't it? You're not giving me hell because you're invested in the Victor Lord murder case. This is -- this is because you're missing out on a photo op.",
        "Mayor Finn: Oh, Bo, no, really. Come on.",
        "Bo: You want camera crews. You want cheering crowds. You -- you want the opportunity to take credit for Todd Manning turning himself in, so, Kathleen, come on. Admit it. This is about your re-election.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Hey, Blair.",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Why aren't you inside the arraignment?",
        "Blair: Well, the judge said I couldn't be there. You here for your sentencing hearing?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, afraid so.",
        "Blair: I hate seeing you out here like this, especially when you don't have to be.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I do.",
        "Blair: No, you don't. Will you explain to me why you're doing this, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Now, it appears that everyone is here. Ms. Delgado, how do the defendants plead in this matter of Todd Manning's escape from a holding cell at the LPD?",
        "T\u00e9a: Your honor, I move that all charges against them be dropped.",
        "Nora: What? Wait. You're kidding me, right? You're not serious.",
        "Judge: Do I need to remind the district attorney that she'll have her turn?",
        "Nora: Forgive me, your honor, but for counsel to even suggest that the charges be dropped -- two guards were held at gunpoint. I mean, it was lucky that no one was hurt, let alone killed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your honor, if I may. Mr. Manning believed, quite accurately, as it turned out, that Irene Manning, his mother, posed a real threat to his family. Lives were at stake.",
        "Nora: And if Mr. Manning and Miss Manning believed there was a credible threat, then they should have come to the police.",
        "Starr: Oh, please. No one would have believed us.",
        "Todd: Stop.",
        "Nora: Regardless, the people do acknowledge the fact that Miss Manning has no prior criminal record and that she was clearly manipulated by her father into committing a felony with him, so the commonwealth is willing to drop the charges against Miss Manning...if Mr. Manning pleads guilty and serves two years in prison.",
        "T\u00e9a: Absolutely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: No, I don't remember the accident. I don't remember anything.",
        "Cutter: Are you sure?",
        "Stacy: I remember what you told me -- that my sister died, and I lived.",
        "Cutter: Damn it. I was hoping you'd get your memory back, so I can get the hell out of here.",
        "Stacy: You don't think I want to remember?",
        "Cutter: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Hey, do you want me to get a nurse? I can get them to give you something to relax again.",
        "Stacy: No, I don't want to be knocked out. I need -- I need to focus. Who are you?",
        "Cutter: I told you. I'm Cutter. I'm...a friend of a friend.",
        "Stacy: A friend of mine? So, I have other people in my life besides my sister?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: You know, I know you've had your share of worries, you know, what, with Shane and Gigi and everything like that.",
        "Rex: Yeah. Thanks, Rox.",
        "Roxanne: But I did want to tell you. I think Clint is gonna send his goons over here to kick you out on your butt, okay? I wouldn't put it past him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Are you seriously considering calling Cutter back and making a deal with him?",
        "Clint: Well, why not? Rex signed the thing, didn't he?",
        "Viki: We don't know that.",
        "Clint: No, but why assume otherwise? Even if it is a very good forgery, it might hold up in court.",
        "Viki: Oh, I cannot believe you just said that.",
        "Clint: Rex is not taking very good care of the business. Now, Cord says that he is well on his way to driving B.E. right into the ground.",
        "Viki: Then let Cord deal with it.",
        "Clint: Viki. What if this is my one chance -- my only chance -- to get everything back that I lost?",
        "Viki: No. I'm begging you. Let this go. Please. You and Rex are finally making some progress.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, by signing this, he obviously wants to make more progress.",
        "Viki: Oh, if he signed it, and that is a very big \"if.\" He probably did it out of grief, and if that's the case, you don't want to take advantage of him.",
        "Clint: He once took advantage of me.",
        "Viki: Clint, if that document is real, why does Cutter Wentworth have it? He's completely untrustworthy. You know that. All this is gonna do is cause your heart much more stress and that is the very last thing you want. Please, please. I am begging you. Do not call him. Just ignore this whole thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: All right, thanks, Rox. Goodb--",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rex: It's Clint. Why am I not surprised?",
        "Roxanne: Ooh, he's trying to cash in.",
        "Rex: It's okay. I'll handle it.",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Roxanne: You sure you don't want me to stick around for moral support?",
        "Rex: I'm okay. I'll -- I'll talk to you later. Thanks. Yes?",
        "Clint: I need to see you.",
        "Rex: Well, why don't you call my secretary and come into my office? Oh, wait, you can't, can you?",
        "Clint: No, Rex. I'm not at liberty to leave the house, here.",
        "Rex: May I ask what this is regarding?",
        "Clint: Just get over here.",
        "Viki: I thought you were calling Cutter.",
        "Clint: I couldn't.",
        "Viki: Why not?",
        "Clint: You asked me not to.",
        "Viki: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Finn: I am the face of this city, and this is a high-profile case.",
        "Bo: The only profile that you're worried about is your own. Now, the last time I looked, I'm the police commissioner. I'm not your campaign manager.",
        "Mayor Finn: Oh, Bo, come on. You can't be that naive. But politics is a fact of life. Now, we can pretend that we never indulge in self-promotion to protect to our jobs, but we do.",
        "Bo: But the one thing I have never done is put politics before the job.",
        "Mayor Finn: Of course. Of course not. No, that's your whole shtick. I know. You're just a honorable, straight-arrow kind of cop, and I think some people might find that quality attractive, but it's not always gonna work for you. Eventually that's gonna wear thin.",
        "Bo: Well, thank you for the advice, but your re-election -- that's your problem. Now, I'm busy. I have a murder to solve, and I'm sorry that I don't have the time to supply you with photo ops.",
        "Mayor Finn: [Chuckles] Is that right? All right, well, if that's the case, then...you're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Your honor, Mr. Manning did break out of prison with the help of his daughter. No one is disputing that.",
        "Nora: Sounds like a guilty plea to me.",
        "T\u00e9a: But there were significant extenuating circumstances. Mr. Manning had every reason to believe that his family was in grave danger and that he had to do something desperate in order to protect them.",
        "Nora: Even if the defendant had good reason, is irrelevant. The fact remains a crime was committed.",
        "T\u00e9a: Your honor, the court needs to consider this man's history. Todd Manning has been terribly wronged -- first by a rogue branch of the government that kept him illegally imprisoned and tortured him for eight years. Next by shoddy police work that resulted in his arrest and incarceration for the murder of his brother -- a crime he did not commit. Subsequently, Mr. Manning turned himself in and the charges were dropped because the commonwealth admitted its mistake. Mr. Manning, your honor, does not deserve to be unjustly imprisoned for yet a third time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I need to do this, Blair.",
        "Blair: Why? For Todd?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, that's part of it. Todd lost eight years of his life because of me. I turned him over to that bitch Irene, and I never even bothered to figure out what happened to him.",
        "Blair: So this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna take the rap for him? Try to make it up to him? You did not kill Irene Manning.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Well, maybe I should have. Either way, there's blood on my hands. There's so much blood on my hands, Blair. You have no idea how many people I killed for that woman. Yes, in the beginning, I thought it was legitimate, even patriotic. That was so far from the truth.",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s, you didn't know that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Blair, it was slaughter -- senseless slaughter -- and I have never been called to answer for the things I've done, so if paying for Irene's murder is gonna make up for all those lives that I took --",
        "Blair: It won't. It won't. Tom\u00e1s, I thought that we had something real and good, or at least I thought that, and you're ready to throw it all away? We -- I guess I never even mattered to you, did I?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What? Are you crazy? I love you, Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Ms. Delgado is turning Mr. Manning into a martyr, which is preposterous. He doesn't deserve a medal for manipulating his daughter into committing a felony with him or endangering her life or the lives of two guards, as well.",
        "T\u00e9a: The law recognizes extenuating circumstances.",
        "Nora: And the people were willing to offer a deal, but Ms. Delgado wasn't happy with the terms, so now the commonwealth will rescind the offer...and recommend that this case go to trial. Mr. Manning and Miss Manning will be tried for breaking out of jail and for assaulting two guards, and as Miss Manning is an adult, she will be tried as such.",
        "Judge: Very well, then. The defendants will enter their plea --",
        "Todd: No. Look, you want to punish somebody, punish me. You can lock me up and throw away the key, but you leave her alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Okay, I'm here. What's this about?",
        "Clint: Straight to the point. I like that. I was just made aware of a certain document. I was made aware of it by Cutter Wentworth.",
        "Rex: Cutter Wentworth. Yeah, I'm familiar with it.",
        "Viki: Well, what is that all about?",
        "Clint: How did Cutter get that? And if you signed it, why does he still have it?",
        "Viki: Did you sign it, Rex?",
        "Rex: You know what? It doesn't matter if I signed it. The truth is, I'm just trying to let everything go. Live a normal life, focus on my son.",
        "Clint: What are you saying?",
        "Rex: I'm saying I don't want your money. I don't need it. And if you want it all back, I'll give it to you.",
        "Clint: Are you telling me that you took all my money, my company, my father's house in exchange for Gigi's heart? And now you're telling me that you're offering to give it all back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You said you're a friend of a friend, so who is the friend? Please? I need to know.",
        "Cutter: What's the point? She's not coming back, okay?",
        "Stacy: What do you mean? W-why not?",
        "Cutter: She got in trouble. She had to leave.",
        "Stacy: And who's Rex?",
        "Cutter: Rex?",
        "Stacy: Yeah. That name --",
        "Cutter: Whoa, whoa. Easy.",
        "Stacy: I know I've heard it before.",
        "Cutter: Doctors said you shouldn't. You're not stable, okay?",
        "Stacy: I'm fine.",
        "Cutter: Stay in bed.",
        "Stacy: I'm fine!",
        "Cutter: Stay in bed.",
        "Stacy: See? [Groans]",
        "Cutter: I knew that was gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Look, I just lost Gigi. The only reason I strong-armed you into giving me everything that you had was so I could use your money and power to avenge her death.",
        "Viki: Oh, Rex.",
        "Rex: But Gigi's gone and she's not coming back. And you warned me this need for revenge, it did terrible things to me, and especially to Shane. As far as the company goes...",
        "Clint: Yes?",
        "Rex: [Sighs] I pretty much sucked at running it. It's your company, not mine. I'd rather spend time with my kid.",
        "Clint: Are you serious?",
        "Rex: I'm as surprised as you are. This is not what I expected to do when I came over here, but maybe this document falling into your lap is a sign. I should have never bargained with Gigi's heart, and I don't think she would have approved, so...I think it's time we just put everything back to the way things were.",
        "Clint: All right. I'll have the necessary papers drawn up.",
        "Rex: Shane and I will be out by the end of the week. Viki, would it be okay if Shane and I rented the carriage house again just until we found our own place?",
        "Viki: Oh, honey. You just stay as long as you like.",
        "Rex: Thank you. Clint.",
        "Clint: Rex. Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Seriously, Kathleen. You're firing me?",
        "Mayor Finn: That's right. I mean, clearly, we don't have the same priorities. We're always butting heads. I've enjoyed our sparring, I admit it, but it's not good for the city. I am the mayor, after all. Things have changed. I really think this is the for the better, so I'll accept your resignation effective immediately.",
        "Bo: No. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No. You fired me, so let's call it what it is.",
        "Mayor Finn: Yeah, that's fine. Have it your way.",
        "Bo: I just want to remind you of something, though. You know, my approval ratings -- they're much higher than yours. So...good luck when you have to explain to the voters why you canned me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Dad, Dad, don't do this. Please sit down.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen to your daughter.",
        "Todd: You are not putting my daughter on trial. Everything that happened in that jail cell was my fault. I forced her to help me escape. Leave her alone.",
        "Judge: Mr. Manning, sit down now. Now, I am sorry, Mr. Manning, Miss Manning, but you have to pay for what you've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You love me? Really? How could you do this to me?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Believe me. This is the last thing I want. But if I don't square things up with my conscience for all the terrible things, then what kind of man am I? I felt like I lost my soul a long time ago. If I don't do something drastic to get it back, then I have nothing to offer you.",
        "Blair: No, that's not true. You have a soul. You have a beautiful, creative, wonderful soul. I know because I felt it. You have so much that you want to give and I have so much that I want to give back to you, but how am I gonna do that if you throw your life away? If you lock yourself away from me for, what, the rest of your life, maybe?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I have to do this, Blair.",
        "Blair: [Sighs]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You asked me to save him, remember? You were afraid for him. You sent me after him. So that's what I'm doing. I'm saving Todd...for you. Because you asked me to. So I'm asking you to tell me the truth. Is there still some part of you that is just so in love with Todd? It's true, isn't it? That's why you asked me to save Todd when he went after Irene? Part of you is still in love with him, aren't you?",
        "Blair: What happened?",
        "Starr: It went well.",
        "Blair: It did?",
        "Starr: Well, mostly.",
        "Blair: Oh, good.",
        "Starr: Dad and I both plead guilty.",
        "Blair: Guilty?!",
        "Starr: Yes. But we both got suspended sentences and community service.",
        "Blair: Oh, my God! That's great!",
        "Todd: Well, we're gonna be picking up trash on the side of the road, so...",
        "Blair: Well, that's pretty great.",
        "Nora: Well, I think you got lucky there, Todd. You softened up the judge by taking the fall for Starr.",
        "Todd: Told you I wouldn't let our little girl go down for that.",
        "Blair: Well, it's a damn good thing.",
        "Todd: Am I free to go?",
        "Nora: Just a matter of some paperwork.",
        "T\u00e9a: Tom\u00e1s, they're ready for us. We need to go now.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Congratulations, Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: If you'll excuse me, I need to pack up my office.",
        "Mayor Finn: Just stop, all right? You're impossible. I can't even fire you and get away with it.",
        "Bo: Does that mean that you're rescinding my dismissal?",
        "Mayor Finn: Correct. Forget that it ever happened, but I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for me.",
        "Bo: No, I understand completely.",
        "Mayor Finn: As much as I hate to admit it, you're actually right. The voters would hate me if I fired you. I can't afford to take that risk.",
        "Bo: Well, that, and come on, you have to admit -- you'd miss me too much if you fired me.",
        "Mayor Finn: Don't press your luck, Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Nurse!",
        "Stacy: No! I don't want the nurse! I just want to know -- I just want to get out of here.",
        "Cutter: You're too weak to do that. Where are you gonna go? You can't even walk.",
        "Stacy: I just want to know who I am and where I'm from.",
        "Cutter: Don't be stupid.",
        "Nurse: What happened?",
        "Cutter: She woke up, she got mad, and she still can't remember anything.",
        "Nurse: Get you back in bed.",
        "Cutter: [Sighs]",
        "Stacy: No. No, no, no! Not that! Please! I just want to know who I am! I just want to know who I am!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I don't need my house anymore, since I can't leave this place. So that old barn that Asa built, it's just gonna stand empty?",
        "Rex: You can always sell it.",
        "Clint: Oh, no. No. I don't want it leaving the family, and... well, you're family. You're a Buchanan. You're my son and Shane is my grandson, so I was just thinking you can turn over those B.E. shares to me, and I can run the company from here, and as far as the investments go, well, given your track record, maybe I should hold on to those, too. But...I want my son and my grandson to continue living in Asa Buchanan's house.",
        "Rex: Well, the truth is that that house costs a fortune to maintain. I would never be able to afford it.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, since you've been doing me a favor, I will, uh -- I will cover those expenses. But you and Shane -- you can continue living there as long as you like.",
        "Rex: Thank you. I appreciate that very much.",
        "Clint: Why are you staring at me like that?",
        "Viki: Oh. [Crying] Oh, my God. You just did such a great thing.",
        "Clint: It was a practical decision. I do not want that house standing empty.",
        "Viki: And of all the people that you could have asked to live there. [Laughs]",
        "Clint: It's logistical. I didn't want that boy to be troubled with another move.",
        "Viki: Well, you can deny it all you want. You just took an enormous step with your son, and you know it. Okay. Speaking of steps... let's go finish your exercises.",
        "[Whistle blows]",
        "Clint: Just a minute. There's something I need to do.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Cutter: Clint. Hey, buddy. What's it gonna be?",
        "Clint: Take your document and shove it.",

        "Viki: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: See this, Morasco? I'm giving everything back to Clint. I'm moving on. But don't think this means I won't miss you, because I will. For the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Damn it! You were supposed to be my ticket out of here, my golden goose. But, no. Apparently, my golden goose has flown the coop. [Sighs] Unless my golden goose is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mayor Finn: There was a time, Bo, when that smile of yours would have let you get away with just about anything, but that was then and this is now.",
        "Bo: Meaning?",
        "Mayor Finn: Meaning if you don't find who really killed Victor Lord Jr. by the time I'm re-elected, then you will be fired before I'm even sworn in.",
        "Bo: Kathleen, if there's anything you know about me, it's got to be I do not like threats.",
        "Mayor Finn: Oh, that's not a threat, though, Bo. That's a promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Okay, Starr, we need to go start your process for release.",
        "Starr: Okay, good. I can't wait to get home to my little girl. I'll see you later.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Starr: Wish Tom\u00e1s luck for me.",
        "Blair: I will, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: I wish there was something we could do to help him.",
        "Blair: Okay, you've done enough to get people out of jail. Why don't you go with Nora, okay?",
        "Nora: Come on.",
        "Starr: Finally. We're free.",
        "Todd: Yes, we are.",
        "Starr: That's it. Okay.",
        "Blair: Okay, I need to talk to you.",
        "Todd: Why? What's the problem?",
        "Blair: I just need to understand why you're free and Tom\u00e1s isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: It is not too late for you to change your plea. Things looked pretty intense between you and Blair out there. Forget about me and your family. You've walked away from us before. But are you really ready to walk away from Blair?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So, tell me the truth, Todd. Can you really, in good conscience, allow Tom\u00e1s to be put away for a murder that you committed?"
