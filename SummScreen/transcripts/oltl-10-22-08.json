        "Cole: No, you -- you were looking at me funny.",
        "Starr: I was?",

        "Adriana: What brings you here, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Well, actually, I -- I'm here to see Starr if she's around. She had, uh, oh, those, uh, those Braxton-Hicks contractions. You know, those false labor pains? So I just wanted to come by --",
        "Adriana: Cut the crap, Marcie. You found out that I moved Rex from the hospital and you're here to plead Gigi's case -- again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Bo: Come in.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Bo: Hey.",
        "John: Everything all right?",
        "Bo: I just got a message that Adriana's had Balsom moved from the hospital to whoever the hell knows where.",
        "John: Nothing you can do?",
        "Bo: No, she's next of kin. You know, my hands are tied. She was standing guard outside his hospital room, deciding who could go in and who couldn't. You know, I thought she'd come to her senses.",
        "John: That's a bad situation.",
        "Bo: Yeah, and that's not the only one.",
        "John: What's going on, Bo?",
        "Bo: Remember when you came to talk to me about Jessica?",
        "John: Yeah, about the search warrant over at Manning's place.",
        "Bo: Yeah, you said something was off about her.",
        "John: Yeah, I remember.",
        "Bo: I think you were right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Hey, how's it going in here, huh? Why are you looking at my kid like you've seen a ghost?",
        "Marty: I may have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It's never a good time to see you, but now is a particularly bad time. It's late and --",
        "Tina: Well, that's too bad because I need your help, and, uh, I'm not going to leave until you give it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Boy, are you a sight for sore eyes.",
        "Viki: Hello, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: When did you get in?",
        "Viki: Last night.",
        "Viki: You're not imposing. In fact, I was on my way out to see you.",
        "Charlie: Really?",
        "Viki: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about Jared.",
        "Charlie: Oh, sure, what do you want to know?",
        "Viki: Have you seen or heard from Jared lately?",
        "Charlie: Not for a couple of days. Why?",
        "Viki: Oh, God, I'm worried. I don't know how to say this except to just say it, okay? But I think that Natalie and Jared may both be missing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Natalie groans]",
        "Natalie: Where the hell is Tess?",
        "Jared: I don't know.",
        "Natalie: You know, it's not like I want to see her face or anything, but I just want to know why she's not down here torturing us.",
        "Jared: Yeah, or at least feeding us.",
        "Natalie: Jared, what if -- what if she never comes back? What if we never get out of here? I mean, I'm -- I'm starving and my ankle's really starting to hurt again.",
        "Jared: We will figure something out.",
        "Natalie: What, Jared? What are we going to do? How are we going to get out of here alive?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Well, what do you mean, missing?",
        "Viki: When's the last time you spoke to Jared?",
        "Charlie: A couple of days ago. And I've called him a few times since, just to check in, and -- well, he hasn't called me back. Actually, that's why I'm here.",
        "Viki: Okay, I talked to Jared. I called him last night when I got in, okay? It was a terrible connection. I could barely hear him, but he said something about something being urgent, and then I lost the call. And I tried to call him back, and it went straight to voicemail and has been ever since. And then when I got up this morning, I found out he never came home last night. And I have been trying to call him all day today and so has Bo.",
        "Charlie: Bo?",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Charlie: Okay, Viki, now you're getting me nervous.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm actually kind of scared myself.",
        "Charlie: What's happened?",
        "Viki: Come in, Charlie. Look, there's something I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You're alone with my daughter and you're seeing ghosts?",
        "Marty: No, I didn't mean it to sound like that, exactly. I -- I was, um, holding, I was holding her and all of a sudden, \"Jabberwocky\" came into my head.",
        "Tess: Jabber what?",
        "Marty: It's a poem. It's a Lewis Carroll poem. And I was reciting it to Bree, and then all of a sudden I remembered reciting it to another baby. Um, and I think it was a memory.",
        "[Bree babbles]",
        "Marty: Yeah. You've known me for a long time, right? Um, was I -- was I close to someone that had a little boy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Todd, how long has it been since I have asked you for anything?",
        "Todd: Not long enough.",
        "Tina: Yeah, well, why don't you try not being such a hard-ass, okay? Because it, uh, really doesn't work with me.",
        "Todd: All right, what do you want?",
        "Tina: Have you seen Jessica?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So you think Jessica's lost it.",
        "Bo: I'm starting to.",
        "John: What happened?",
        "Bo: Banks came to me with his, uh, Tess angle yesterday. And I don't like to listen to a thing this guy has to say, because it's always like he's trying to hustle me.",
        "John: I thought the same thing when he came to me about Natalie leaving town.",
        "Bo: But it's Balsom. You know, Balsom's like a brother to Natalie, and now he's been shot. He's in a coma. And after all the messages that everybody has left for Natalie, no one's heard a word. Does that sound like Natalie to you?",
        "John: No, it doesn't.",
        "Bo: No. And Viki came back from Africa. She still hasn't heard from Natalie. So I talked to Viki about my suspicions, I could see a light go on.",
        "John: I guess she would know.",
        "Bo: Losing Nash the way that Jessica did, you know? Losing the vineyard, being pregnant and still being responsible for a toddler, that's a lot to handle. Viki thinks that Tess could be in control again.",
        "John: And you think Tess has something to do with Natalie being missing.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I do now. As of last night, Banks is nowhere to be found, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Here, baby, come here, sit down. Sit down.",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Jared: Let me get a look at this. Oh, sweetie, you are really swollen. Does, uh --",
        "Natalie: Ow!",
        "Jared: Okay, all right. You know what? We need to wrap this, like, right away.",
        "Jared: God, we could use few anti-inflammatory pills, too.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, the only person we can rely on is \"Doctor Tess,\" and she loves inflicting pain, especially on me. Jared, I can't stand this. I've got to get out of here right now. I've got to get out of here now.",
        "Jared: Then let's get out of here right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: So that letter would have been written under duress.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm. Tess forces Natalie to break it off with Jared, and then in the meantime --",
        "John: As Jessica, she keeps the cover-up any way she can.",
        "Bo: Mm-hmm, that could explain the way she was acting at Manning's.",
        "John: Yeah, and why she came to see me the next day at the station, running interference for him. It didn't really seem like Jessica.",
        "Bo: I don't think it was.",
        "John: Makes me wonder what she knows about Natalie and Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I have not seen Jessica, scout's honor.",
        "Tina: Okay.",
        "Todd: Now, good-bye.",
        "Tina: Well, then I have another question for you.",
        "Todd: What's that?",
        "Tina: Do you know the combination to Viki's safe? Because, um, I put some, well, some valuables in there and then Jessica, well, she just decided to change the combination. And I wondered if maybe she told it to you.",
        "Todd: No, she didn't. Now, get the hell out of my house, Tina, immediately.",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Well, thanks for taking care of little grape. Say, \"bye- bye, Marty. Bye-bye.\" We have stuff to do now, see ya.",
        "Tina: Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? I'm your sister, Todd!",
        "Marty: Something wrong?",
        "Tess: About that little boy you remembered, I -- I think I do know something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm not going to be reading to our baby when it's born, Marcie is.",
        "Starr: I just meant that one day, you are going to be a great father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: No, I'm not here to plead anybody's case. I -- actually, you know, I -- I'm really surprised to even see you here. I thought that you would be with Rex. I mean you, of all people, 24-7, you know, wherever he is.",
        "Adriana: Rex is fine.",
        "Marcie: He's unconscious.",
        "Adriana: You know what I mean. He's stable. Anyway, I was on my way to go see Rex, so if, you know, there's nothing else --",
        "Marcie: Well, yeah, yeah, there is. I'm here to see Starr, remember?",
        "Adriana: Starr's not here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: \"And has thou slain the Jabberwock?\"",
        "Gigi: Damn it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: But it's really late, you know. I mean, are you sure that Starr isn't here?",
        "Adriana: Yep.",
        "Marcie: Any idea where she might be, maybe?",
        "Adriana: I'm not her babysitter.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Adriana: Sorry, Marcie, look, I'm just really anxious to get to Rex, so --",
        "Marcie: Yeah, of course. Oh, you know what? I'll -- I'll just leave her a note. You know, just let her know that I was here. Oh, do you have a pen?",
        "Adriana: No, not on me, no.",
        "Marcie: Oh, well, maybe I have one in my bag, here --",
        "[Cell phone vibrates]",
        "Adriana: Is something wrong?",
        "Marcie: Actually, I'll just give her a call.",
        "Adriana: No, you know what \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Starr: What's up?",
        "Marcie: Hey, Starr. I came by your house to check on you, to see how you're doing, and I hear that you're not home.",
        "Starr: I'm in the living room with Rex.",
        "Marcie: Oh, you're in the living room with Rex.",
        "Starr: Hold on.",
        "Gigi: Thank you, Marcie.",
        "Shaun: Excuse me, are you lost?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] You know, maybe it was Todd and Blair's kids that you were thinking of.",
        "Marty: No, I don't think so because Todd said that, uh, we didn't see much of each other in the last few years.",
        "Tess: Yeah, I bet he did.",
        "Marty: Is he out there?",
        "Tess: Yes, but he's, uh, not alone.",
        "Marty: Someone's with him?",
        "Tess: Yeah, so we should stay really, really quiet.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God. Is it -- is it John McBain?",
        "Tess: I think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Viki had it out with Tess?",
        "Bo: Nobody's seen Tess since this morning. That's got Viki even more worried.",
        "John: With Balsom, you've got a lot on your plate, right now.",
        "Bo: Well, I'm just trying to focus on what I can do something about, you know? Natalie's always been impulsive, but just to disappear right off the face of the earth?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Bo: What are you thinking, John?",
        "John: If Jessica is this Tess and Manning knows about it, explains why she's been defending him and it explains why she said he didn't have anyone up at that house.",
        "Bo: So you think Tess is in on whatever Manning's got going on?",
        "John: Has to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Move it or lose it, sis.",
        "Tina: Hey, why are you being so mean to me? We are family and family is supposed to help one another.",
        "Todd: Get out before I call the cops.",
        "Tina: Oh, that is sweet. You hate the cops. And what's more important, the cops hate you.",
        "Todd: So what?",
        "Tina: So you bug them, they're gonna find some old case against you and just reopen it just for the fun of it. So, I need your help in opening Viki's safe without the combination.",
        "Todd: Oh, you'd like me to help you steal from my sister?",
        "Tina: Well, I'm not stealing from Viki. I stole from -- look, possession is nine-tenths of the law. And whatever's in that safe was in my possession before Jessica changed the combination, so I need you to help me jimmy the lock or whatever and don't act like you don't know how to do it.",
        "Todd: Uh, the only way to open that safe without the combination is to blow it up. Is that helpful, Tina?",
        "Tina: This is not a joke, Todd. This is a matter of life or death.",
        "Todd: Yeah, yours.",
        "[Todd laughs]",
        "Tina: No, not mine, but someone very near and dear to me will die if I don't open that safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared you know how to get us out of here?",
        "Jared: Trust me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I think I'll go over to Manning's. I think I'll go right now.",
        "Bo: You're just looking for another reason to get back in that house.",
        "John: Maybe.",
        "Bo: The mayor's told you you've got to stop harassing Manning.",
        "John: Who's harassing him?",
        "Bo: He's afraid you'll shed more light on his boy, Ramsey.",
        "John: Hey, forget about him, all right? Here's what we know. We know Manning and Tess are working together, right? What we don't know is how long it's gonna last. I say this is the time we get over there and see what we can find out.",
        "Bo: I know that part of you really wants to help me out.",
        "John: If something's happened to Natalie, I damn well want to know what it is.",
        "Bo: I know, but you're also looking for an excuse to, uh, get back into Manning's house and find that woman that you think that he's hiding there. I can't let you do that, John. Now, why don't you tell me what you're really thinking? Who do you think this woman is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Are you sure you saw John McBain?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Well, I didn't see his face, but he's outside having a conversation with somebody and it didn't sound very friendly.",
        "Marty: Well, then I need to get out of here.",
        "Tess: No, Marty, just stay, relax. Trust in Todd. He's going to take care of everything, okay? Hang out with Bree. That always relaxes me.",
        "Marty: Push down. There you go. Mm-hmm, push.",
        "[Marty growls playfully]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Why are you being so mean? Look, I know he's just a dog, but I love him.",
        "[Todd laughs]",
        "Tina: Well -- well, I hate the thought of somebody doing anything to hurt him. And if I don't pay that ransom, he just may die.",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah.",
        "[Todd laughs]",
        "Todd: It's a hard knock life.",
        "Tina: Don't you even care about Natalie and Jared?",
        "Todd: Hmm, scoot back. Don't let the door hit you.",
        "Tina: Todd! Todd --",
        "[Tina sighs]",
        "Tina: I guess I'll have to get into that safe all by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Hey, how's it going in here?",
        "Marty: Jessica said that she saw you talking to John McBain.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: Is that what she said? No, no, it was just some woman looking for some money for some charity. She's gone now. Is everything all right?",
        "Tess: Yes, but Marty remembered something. She had a memory about a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I am so sorry, Viki. I thought that Jessica was healed.",
        "Viki: So did I. The thing is, Tess always dealt with Jessica's anger for her. And Jessica had -- oh, my God, she was so angry when Nash died. And then apparently, it was Jared who was the first person to figure out that something was wrong.",
        "Charlie: Hmm, my Jared? How would he know?",
        "Viki: Well, Jared knew Tess long before he knew anyone else in the family. I mean, you must know this. Tess is the reason that he went to prison. I do not get that I didn't see that this was happening. I'm her mother and I have the same illness.",
        "Charlie: Okay, look, but you were dealing with Nash's death and the loss of the company and us.",
        "Viki: But I'm the reason that Tess existed in the first place. Oh, God, Charlie. What if Jared and Natalie are missing and it's because of Tess?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared, of course I trust you. I love you. I trust you with my life. But if you know a way to get us out of here --",
        "Jared: Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Listen, we're not in this room. There are no walls. We're not in this house. We're not in this town. We're not even in this state.",
        "Natalie: I wish --",
        "Jared: Shh. Oh, there's a -- a cool breeze blowing and a fire in the fire pit and the sun is setting in a sky so huge it looks as if it goes on forever. Can you feel it?",
        "Natalie: I can feel it.",
        "Jared: Good, now open your eyes.",
        "Natalie: I miss this place.",
        "Jared: This is where I first told you I loved you. And you let me. And you forgave me. And we made love.",
        "Natalie: It's such a beautiful night. I wish I could just stay here forever.",
        "Jared: No other worries in the world.",
        "Natalie: No loss and no pain.",
        "Jared: I know, just you and me under this huge Texas sky.",
        "Natalie: And our love. Jared, that's all I want. I wish we could just stay here.",
        "Jared: If you want to, if we try, we can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What's this about a baby?",
        "Marty: It was incredible. And I had it twice.",
        "Todd: You had what twice?",
        "Marty: I was holding Bree and I had what had to have been a memory, because it was so indelible, of holding a baby and reading to him. Todd, did I know somebody with a son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Why would you tell Marcie that I wasn't here?",
        "Marcie: Because she probably didn't want me to know that Rex was in your living room.",
        "Adriana: Okay, yes, you're right. I didn't.",
        "Starr: Okay, I don't understand. But Marcie and Rex are friends. What's so bad about her seeing him?",
        "Adriana: It's not Marcie I'm worried about. It's her pal, Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I was just about to take a smoke break. I can't do it in there with the oxygen tank. You got a light?",
        "Shaun: You're a nurse?",
        "Gigi: So I forgot something. It's one of those days, you know?",
        "Shaun: You should forget about smoking. It's really bad for your health.",
        "Gigi: You're right, filthy habit. I guess I'll just take a few minutes to breathe in the nice clean air. I can't believe what a lovely night it is.",
        "Shaun: I didn't see you come in with the other nurses.",
        "Gigi: Oh, I'm relief -- night shift. I'm a night owl, so -- hey, what's with the 20 question, anyway?",
        "Shaun: Hey, I'm sorry. There's a lot of security around this place and this is my job. This is what I do.",
        "Gigi: Got it. I'll stop giving you a hard time.",
        "Shaun: All right, I've got to do my rounds of the property. I'll see you back inside.",
        "Gigi: Not if I can help it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, everybody knows somebody with kids.",
        "Marty: Yeah, but --",
        "Todd: But what? I mean, you know, you're a therapist. You must have had clients who had kids.",
        "Marty: No, oh, no. No, it's more than that. You told me I'm an only child, so that rules out nieces and nephews. But you told me that I had an aunt, so maybe she had a child or --",
        "Todd: No, no, I don't know. I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know. It could be any kid, Marty. Anybody would be happy to let you hold their kid. And you're a natural mother, just wonderful.",
        "Marty: I wasn't just holding him. I loved him. And it was like the truest love I've ever felt. It was so pure and -- and --",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: Todd, it feels so strong. I still feel it. What does that mean?",
        "Todd: Um, it means you're a -- you're, uh, one of the most caring individuals I've ever met and that you're going to be a great mom -- a great mom when we get Starr's kid.",
        "Marty: I'm starting to have memories.",
        "Todd: Well --",
        "Marty: Maybe it's all going to come back to me now.",
        "Todd: Would you excuse me for a second? I've got to \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ah, I found your secret baby stash, and I took the liberty of using one of the portable cribs and some blankets. You don't mind, do you?",
        "Todd: No, no.",
        "Tess: And I found the cutest little green frog. Bree was drooling all over it.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm glad she likes it.",
        "Tess: Yeah. You've got a sweet set-up up there. You have quite the plan here, don't you, Grandpa?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Okay, what makes you think that Jessica could have anything to do with Natalie and Jared's disappearance?",
        "Viki: Well, it wouldn't have been Jessica, would it? It would have been Tess. The point is I have to find them, all of them. Because for one thing, when Jessie or Tess left, she took Bree with her, and I do not like the idea she's alone with that baby.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but if Jessica is Tess, do you honestly think that she is a danger to her family and my son?",
        "Viki: If she's Tess, that means she's been lying to us for months about who she is and about what she's after.",
        "Charlie: Boy, and she did blame Jared and Natalie for Nash's death, that's for sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Dance with me.",
        "Natalie: To what music?",
        "Jared: Listen, you'll hear it.",
        "Singer: You found courage to let your heart through and I don't want to let you down it's a little late to give to how all this can all go wrong please believe me",
        "Jared: How's your ankle?",
        "Natalie: I can't even feel it.",

        "Adriana: I know you're not, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: I thought that we had cleared all of that up before you left for Paris. Just because I'm friends with Gigi, doesn't mean that you're not my friend, that I'm not concerned about you.",
        "Starr: You know what? Actually, we're going to leave you two alone to talk.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I should probably get going.",
        "Starr: And I'll walk you to your car.",
        "Marcie: Oh, well, take your time. Really, not a problem. Look at you. You're a mess. I mean, your clothes and your hair. It's a double mess. This isn't you.",
        "Adriana: Do you really think that matters to me right now?",
        "Marcie: Well, I think that it should.",
        "Adriana: Excuse me?",

        "Marcie: Yeah. All-righty then, come on. Lead the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Jared really was upset when Natalie didn't show up at the hospital to see Rex. I know that.",
        "Viki: And right after that, he went to Bo's office. And then I talked to him last night, but he has not been seen or heard from since.",
        "Charlie: Oh, my God.",
        "Viki: Charlie, I am so, so sorry.",
        "Charlie: Look, Jared loves Natalie with all his heart. If they are together, that is exactly where he wants to be. But I'm telling you, I -- we need to find him.",
        "Viki: Bo is working on that.",
        "Charlie: What can I do?",
        "Viki: I have no idea.",
        "Charlie: I mean, is there any possibility that we should poke around Jared and Natalie's room? I mean, Jared has always been very organized. He might have left some kind of notes or something indicating what he was thinking, where he was going.",
        "Viki: That's very smart. Let's do that.",
        "Charlie: Okay.",
        "Viki: Charlie?",

        "Tina: Thanks a million, Todd. You have helped me in more ways than you will ever know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You can stay one night, but Bree can stay as long as she wants. She's always welcome here.",
        "Tess: Ah, no, no. You stick to stealing your own kid's kid. You don't steal mine.",
        "Todd: If you cared about your kid, you'd let her go before you do to her what Niki Smith did to Jessica.",
        "Tess: Okay, what did Tina want?",
        "Todd: Tina was rambling about some safe and her dog. Oh, and she also mentioned Natalie and her boyfriend.",
        "Tess: And what did you tell her?",
        "Todd: Yeah, you know, if you did something to Natalie and her boyfriend that would put you in jail --",
        "Tess: Oh, that's a hoot. You're really concerned about the law now.",
        "Todd: I'm not going down with you, Tess.",
        "Tess: No one is going down, Todd. It's just a shame my plan didn't work out the way it was supposed to.",
        "Todd: What plan is that?",
        "Tess: Are you worried about Natalie? Don't be. She got exactly what she wanted. Her and Jared are -- are together. You see, I do have a soft side. It must be the Jessica in me.",
        "Todd: You're the one in Jessica. And let me tell you something. When she gets her footing back, she's going to boot your ass out.",
        "Tess: Okay, now let me tell you something. You better go check on the mother of your joint grandchildren -- is that how it is? Because her memory is starting to rev up. And if holding Bree has her remembering baby boys, imagine what's going to happen when she's bouncing her own grandchild on her knee, huh? Huh? Yeah, okay, mama's hungry. I'm going to go to the kitchen. Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So Jessica and her kid are going to stay the night. They're having some problems with something.",

        "Charlie: Viki, Viki, Viki, we will find them, okay? We will. Look, I don't know where you and I stand with each other anymore, but for right now, the only thing that matters is you and I find our kids, okay?",

        "Jared: Good, because we'll be back there again when we're free.",

        "John: I can't tell you what I'm thinking, Bo. Too many people could get hurt if I float something out there and it ends up being false. I'm not trying to be secretive, I just can't be wrong about this one.",
        "Bo: So there's a lot at stake.",
        "John: Could be.",
        "Bo: I don't like being kept in the dark, John.",
        "John: I know, Bo. And listen to me. The minute I get any evidence, you're going to be the first to know about it.",
        "Bo: Fine. And if you come up with anything on my niece while you're leaning on Manning --",
        "John: It goes without saying. You want some help with this Jessica situation?",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do, but first, I've got to find her.",

        "Marty: Doesn't matter. I just get so sick of not knowing who I am for real.",
        "Todd: Well, you know, you are about to be a mother to a real baby who really needs you. That's pretty real, isn't it?",

        "Cole: Yeah, I miss my mom, but I'm okay. You know, I know that wherever Marty Saybrooke is now that she's at peace. I just wish I could say the same thing for Rex.",
