        "Nora and Bo have a plan to get Matthew involved in a boarding school and hopefully convince him that his life can be ok without the surgery. Rachel informs her mother that Shaun has regained consciousness. But Nora knows she better not tell that to Matthew because he could convince Greg to do the surgery. Meanwhile, Tea reveals to Rachel that she has a secret she's keeping from Todd and it involves their son. Matthew meets a school mate. And he may be Todd and Tea's son. Natalie persuades Rex to help her find Jared while he's on the run before the cops do. And it just happens to conflict with the couples' therapy session that Gigi wants to have with Rex. When he cancels on her and Schuyler has two tickets to a concert they both want to see, Schuyler and Gigi conclude that instead of missing out, they should attend the concert together."

        "Kim: Bait.",
        "Stacy: A little treat for you.",
        "Kim: If you want Gigi as much as I think you do, that's your next move.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: It's great Dr. Saybrooke can fit us in tonight, huh?",
        "Rex: Yeah. Great.",
        "Gigi: And Shane is staying at Justin's tonight, so we have the whole night to ourselves.",
        "Rex: Huh? Oh. Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Deb said she and her boyfriend did couples therapy.",
        "Rex: Yeah?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. She says sometimes you get homework assignments to help you get closer.",
        "Rex: Bonus.",
        "Gigi: You saving all your words for the session, honey?",
        "Rex: I'm trying, Geeg.",
        "Gigi: I know it'll be weird at first. But if we can talk about our problems like adults...",
        "Rex: In front of a total stranger.",
        "Gigi: A professional who isn't gonna be on your side or my side.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I know.",
        "Gigi: You'd rather eat nails.",
        "Rex: True.",
        "[Gigi chuckles]",
        "Rex: But if it will help us get back, I'm there.",
        "Gigi: Me, too. I don't want anything messing us up again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Honey, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. We just had to move fast.",
        "Bo: Is there any luck with tracking down parolees that knew Jared or Wayne Landers? Is that our best shot at tracking down Jared?",
        "Nora: I know what we did was extreme. I just couldn't let Matthew risk his life.",
        "Rachel: Well, at least now I know why you didn't want me to come along.",
        "Bo: I'll check back in a few hours. Let me know if you need my help with that Jersey prison. Thanks, John.",
        "Nora: I'll call you soon, honey. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Unbelievable! What are you doing here?",
        "T\u00e9a: I was visiting someone. Last time I saw you this upset, you tore into me.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, well, believe it or not, T\u00e9a, I have bigger problems than you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I can believe it. Because as your former roommate and old friend, I can tell something's really bothering you.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, well, I could say the same.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You want to talk about it?",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: About what happened.",
        "Todd: No. There's nothing to say.",
        "Blair: Bull.",
        "Todd: I got nothing to say to you about T\u00e9a, Blair.",
        "Blair: Well, if T\u00e9a is the problem -- no, thank you -- I can certainly listen.",
        "Todd: No, you can't.",
        "Blair: I hate seeing you like this.",
        "Todd: You didn't tell me about Ross and T\u00e9a.",
        "Blair: Well, I thought T\u00e9a was gonna tell you about Ross.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes. It's very sad that the job fell to you, isn't it?",
        "Blair: I tried to save you from some pain, Todd.",
        "Todd: Oh. Well, maybe it's all your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Hey. Where you going?",
        "Matthew: Uh, to check out your car collection.",
        "Kevin: Garage is this way. Come here. I'll help you.",
        "Matthew: I can do it myself.",
        "Kevin: Okay. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help.",
        "Matthew: You really want to help me? Then do it. Help me escape.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I had to tell Rachel everything. She thought I ditched her because I didn't trust her, and I didn't want her to think that. Besides, she was about to call the Seattle hospital pretty soon to ask for an update.",
        "Bo: Did she understand?",
        "Nora: She got real quiet. She had wonderful news, though.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Nora: Shaun woke up.",
        "Bo: That's amazing. I thought --",
        "Nora: I know.",
        "Bo: Good for him.",
        "Nora: Yeah. I guess the good doctor fixed his brother after all. Does that change anything?",
        "Bo: No. I mean, even if Evans agrees that now he wants to do the surgery, it's still too much of a risk. There's no going back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Escape?",
        "Matthew: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: Matthew, you're not a prisoner here.",
        "Matthew: Then why can't I have a cell phone? I'm sure my friend Destiny's been leaving me a ton of messages. I can't even talk to my own sister. What is that?",
        "Kevin: I think that your parents just want you to settle in. All right, look, I'll talk to them about the cell phone.",
        "Matthew: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Do you think we should tell Matthew about Shaun?",
        "Nora: Well, he's gonna hear it from Destiny anyway.",
        "Bo: Are we gonna let them talk?",
        "Nora: We kind of have to, don't we? I mean, that's his best friend.",
        "Bo: If she tells him about Shaun, then he's gonna want to go right back and have Evans do the operation. So we don't tell Matthew about it?",
        "Matthew: So you don't tell me about what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: That's amazing! He's awake?",
        "Rachel: It's like he's been asleep for a day, not for weeks.",
        "T\u00e9a: Wow! Oh, wow. You were on your way to break up with him when we heard that he'd been shot.",
        "Rachel: I said too much that day.",
        "T\u00e9a: But it's true, isn't it? This is about Greg, isn't it? Hey, look, I have eyes. I saw what happened in the courtroom that day.",
        "Rachel: That was a while ago.",
        "T\u00e9a: So what's happened since then?",
        "Rachel: You know, I've actually learned my lesson. I don't need you spreading my business around whenever it suits you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, I promise I will not use what you tell me against you in a court of law or anywhere else. I promise. Look, Matthew's case is over. He won.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: \"Hale Bopp\"?",
        "Stacy: Uh, yeah. It's Gigi's favorite nineties band. Her bedroom was wall to wall with Hale Bopp posters.",
        "Kim: They're reuniting and playing in Philly tonight.",
        "Stacy: If you take her to that concert, you'll bag her in one night.",
        "Schuyler: \"Bag her\"? Like a deer? Wow. You guys are certifiable.",
        "Stacy: Hey, I think it's a great plan.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi and Rex are together, period.",
        "Kim: So Gigi went nuts when we went out on a date because?",
        "Stacy: And Rex was totally ticked off because?",
        "Kim: This'll work, Schuy.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, look, Gigi and Rex are a couple. They want to be together. I'm sure they've worked out any problems they've had. Stop eating the garnishes.",
        "Stacy: Well, that was a bust.",
        "Kim: And a waste of phone bill money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Finally!",
        "Natalie: I had to wait till Gigi left.",
        "Rex: You can't return a call? I'm worried sick. So is Roxy.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I cannot deal with her right now.",
        "Rex: I get that.",
        "Natalie: She left me all these messages, and I don't know what to say to her.",
        "Rex: Is there any news?",
        "Natalie: Oh, yeah. A whole section full of it. Wayne Landers, Pamela's body, and Jared is the number one suspect on the run.",
        "Rex: I'm really sorry.",
        "Natalie: Well, I don't want sympathy. I need your help.",
        "Rex: Name it.",
        "Natalie: I need you to find my husband before the police do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Smell.",
        "Kim: You want coffee. Have a cup already.",
        "Stacy: No. Decaf is not the same. Thank goodness I have Twizzlers.",
        "Kim: Oh, you better share those.",
        "Stacy: Uh-uh. Sorry. They're all mine. I deserve all the treats I can get.",
        "Kim: Well, I hope you stocked up, because my kitty's almost gone.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Kim: My stash. You know, the rest of my savings? I'm running out of money.",
        "Stacy: So I'll tell Rex to kick some more in.",
        "Kim: He's not gonna fund me.",
        "Stacy: I'll just tell him I'm eating more. I mean, hello. Look at me. He'll believe it.",
        "Kim: And what'll that buy? A new teddy and a tank full of gas? I need a job.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, there's not much demand for exotic dancers here in Llanview.",
        "Kim: Oh, and can you imagine what kind of sweaty frat boys and comb-over losers we'd meet if there was? Ooh. No, thanks. And the only reason to dance in Vegas was to meet high rollers. I need a new career.",
        "Stacy: Like?",
        "Kim: Rich divorcee.",
        "Stacy: You're not gonna find that in the classified ads.",
        "Kim: Is there any real money in Llanview?",
        "Stacy: Um, yeah. Uh, hello. Page one?",
        "Kim: \"Millions, murder, and intrigue: Body found at Buchanan Lodge\"? That's what I'm talking about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: It says here McBain's leading the investigation.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, tell me about it. He's been practically living at my house.",
        "Rex: He's good. He'll have a lot of manpower out there.",
        "Natalie: That's the problem.",
        "Rex: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Natalie: Look, the cops -- they don't know Jared, you know? And you're a private eye. You don't have to follow the same rules as they do.",
        "Rex: Okay. So I go in, and I tell the cops that I can get into places where they can't?",
        "Natalie: No!",
        "Rex: \"No\" what?",
        "Natalie: Look, John is out for blood. He's already decided that Jared's a double murderer.",
        "Rex: Did you hear him say that?",
        "Natalie: Like he would.",
        "Rex: He's a fair guy. If Jared is innocent, he'll be okay. Is he?",
        "Natalie: Wha -- what?",
        "Rex: You can tell me. I will still be here. Do you think Jared committed those murders?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a says that she and Ross filed for divorce.",
        "Blair: And you found no proof of that divorce, did you?",
        "Todd: No, I didn't.",
        "Blair: Okay. So how's it my doing?",
        "Todd: I don't know yet.",
        "Blair: Oh, man.",
        "Todd: You're just a little too confident.",
        "Blair: Great, Todd.",
        "Todd: She swears that she and Ross filed for divorce, and you swear she didn't. Why is that?",
        "Blair: Because I know T\u00e9a is a lying skank.",
        "Todd: Or maybe you made sure the papers were never filed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: I -- I got to go.",
        "T\u00e9a: So you'll never trust me again?",
        "Rachel: Probably not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh.",
        "Rachel: Truth? You really did me a big favor that day in court. You made me see what I was doing with \u0096",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, it -- it really will stay between us, okay?",
        "Rachel: I didn't even know it then, but this thing with Greg was already happening. Shaun got shot, and the surgery -- we got closer. A lot closer.",
        "T\u00e9a: Meaning?",
        "Rachel: You know exactly what I mean. And then Destiny calls and tells us that Shaun came to.",
        "T\u00e9a: I see.",
        "Rachel: Yeah. The three of us, when everybody knows there can only be two.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a said that you were trying to break us up.",
        "Blair: She blames me for the holes in the ozone. She's the one that kept the -- her marriage a secret from you, okay? It was her.",
        "Todd: I think you could've done that.",
        "Starr: Hi! Mom, I'm so glad that you are home.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Hey, little girl. Come to me.",
        "Starr: Are you sure you're okay? Gosh, I'm sorry I wasn't here when you got out.",
        "Blair: It's all right. I heard you had some nice volunteer work that you were doing.",
        "Starr: Yeah. Me and Langston worked at the soup kitchen, and it felt really good. You know, it was a privilege to help out. You know what I mean?",
        "Todd: You took my granddaughter to a soup kitchen?",
        "Starr: No, I did not take your granddaughter to a soup kitchen. She stayed with Grandma. And I will take her one day when she's older. Whoa-ho-ho! When Mommy's not so clumsy. Are you sure it's okay for you to be home right now?",
        "Blair: Yeah. You know, I'm a little banged up, but I'm fine. Here you go.",
        "Starr: Do you remember anything, you know, the stuff that happened before the accident?",
        "T\u00e9a: How do I know what it's like to love a child? I have one.",
        "Blair: Your child isn't Ross'. But it's Todd's.",
        "Blair: Not yet.",
        "Todd: She's gonna remember sooner or later, though, right? I mean, you even had hypnosis.",
        "Starr: Is it really that big of a deal?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "Todd: Yes. You said T\u00e9a told you something important.",
        "Blair: Well, if it was that important, it would've come back to me.",
        "Starr: Yeah. I'm sure you'll remember it when you're not even thinking about it. Hmm?",
        "Blair: Maybe I will, and maybe I won't. But I'm not gonna make myself crazy trying to remember.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I don't know what Jared's done. I only know what he tells me.",
        "Rex: Which is?",
        "Natalie: Honestly, Rex, I can't -- I can't read him anymore. You know, he talked to me, but he doesn't make any sense. I mean, it's Jared. It's my Jared. But the words that are coming out of his mouth -- they couldn't --",
        "Rex: Tell me exactly what he said.",
        "Natalie: Well, he confessed.",
        "Rex: To murder?",
        "Natalie: No. Um, no. But he was working with Wayne Landers.",
        "Rex: Wayne La -- the body on the terrace at Llanfair?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, Wayne and Jared were apparently in prison together. And Wayne got out of prison and was gaslighting Jessica, and they wanted her to believe that Nash was haunting her from the grave or alive or something.",
        "Rex: Why?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I mean, they were just messing with her.",
        "Rex: Again, why?",
        "Natalie: He didn't say. You know, he just -- he just said that he was responsible for what was happening.",
        "Rex: All of it?",
        "Natalie: I don't know. I couldn't ask him any more because then he gets this text message and he clams completely up.",
        "Rex: Okay. What did it say?",
        "Natalie: I didn't get a good look at it, and he totally left.",
        "Rex: Did he say anything before he left?",
        "Natalie: All he said is that he would explain when he could and, um, that I should stay out of it. And then the next thing I know, we find Pamela's body and Jared's wallet at the lodge.",
        "Rex: Uh, didn't this Pamela help Jared make his claim as a Buchanan?",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "Rex: And then didn't she come forward and say that she lied?",
        "Natalie: That, too.",
        "Rex: Okay. So Jared's accomplice and the woman who exposed him have both turned up dead?",
        "Natalie: Okay, I know that this looks really bad, but I know this is not Jared.",
        "Rex: Jared has a history. You know that as well --",
        "Natalie: Okay, I know what Jared has done before! But I also know what he could never do. Jared is not a cold-blooded killer.",
        "Rex: So no way he had anything to do with these murders?",
        "Natalie: I can't say that. But, look, if -- if he did kill those people, I know that he had a really good reason.",
        "Rex: You believe that?",
        "Natalie: I have to. I love Jared. And when you love someone, you -- you have to trust them, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Hey!",
        "Schuyler: Hey. You look right with the world.",
        "Gigi: I am.",
        "Schuyler: Good. I -- I was worried because things didn't look so great with you and Rex the other night. So...",
        "Gigi: Oh, yeah. Well, we had a huge blowout about...",
        "Rex: Do you have feelings for Schuyler Joplin?",
        "Gigi: A bunch of stuff. But you know how that goes.",
        "Schuyler: Uh, yeah.",
        "Gigi: But we are -- oh, my God. Hale Bopp? Um, I was online for, like, two hours the morning they went on sale trying to score these tickets. They were sold out in, like, 20 minutes, I heard.",
        "Schuyler: Good band, huh?",
        "Gigi: The best! I would've done anything to see them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Look at that! Hey --",
        "Kim: I've got a body on the terrace. Don't bother me.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, but Gigi's circling in. Schuyler's actually hanging in there. Ah. He's giving her the puppy dog eyes.",
        "Kim: Is Buchanan Enterprises publicly traded?",
        "Stacy: Huh?",
        "Kim: How much are these people worth?",
        "Stacy: I don't know! Their pictures are on page 12.",
        "Kim: Is this the whole family?",
        "Stacy: I guess most of it.",
        "Kim: Would it kill them to list assets, too? Let's see. How about him?",
        "Stacy: Clint? No, he's married.",
        "Kim: So what?",
        "Stacy: No, you don't want that.",
        "Kim: Sometimes married is better. They're easier to manage. Guilty. They won't take you to court for their money.",
        "Stacy: Oh, he's a newlywed, and his wife is the district attorney.",
        "Kim: Okay. Scratch Clint.",
        "Stacy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Kim: How about this one? Not too old. Kind of hot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I'm sure your parents can tell you what they meant, Matthew.",
        "Matthew: Why are they just staring at me like that?",
        "Nora: The look on your face.",
        "Matthew: Leave and you won't have to see it.",
        "Bo: We weren't sure how much to tell you about the school.",
        "Nora: Yeah. You were gonna be seeing it for yourself soon enough, and I doubted you would trust anything we had to say anyway.",
        "Matthew: Gee, I wonder why.",
        "Kevin: Uh, did you, by any chance, bring a phone that gets service here? Because he's gonna need one in school.",
        "Bo: I'm working on that. We'll drop it off to you tomorrow.",
        "Matthew: You seriously expect me to go to this school tomorrow?",
        "Nora: No. Actually, tonight.",
        "Matthew: What?",
        "Nora: Well, they're very excited to meet you, and they want to get you all settled in before classes tomorrow.",
        "Matthew: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Then there are his parents. They really bought into everything that Shaun was saying. In their minds, we're practically already married. I'm the reason why he fought to survive.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, Rachel.",
        "Rachel: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, you got to tell Shaun.",
        "Rachel: Now?",
        "T\u00e9a: There will never be a perfect time, Rachel. Trust me. You can wait too long and lose your chance forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Good girl! Oh, it's so wonderful to be here with my family.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it looks like we're gonna have a wedding to get ready for.",
        "Blair: Hmm. So I heard.",
        "Starr: Mm-hmm. Did you meet Amelia, Aunt Dorian's fianc\u00e9e?",
        "Blair: Uh, kind of.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: Dorian's gonna strike out with women just as she's struck out with men.",
        "Starr: Dad --",
        "Todd: You know it's a stunt, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I know it is. But Amelia's nice, and they're doing it for a good cause. And I think we should all get together on this one. Okay? All right, I'm gonna go fix hope a bottle. You two can take care of her?",
        "Blair: We got her.",
        "Starr: All right.",
        "Blair: Yes, you want to come spend some time with your nana, right?",
        "Todd: You can't bring yourself to say \"Grandma,\" can you?",
        "Blair: Oh, could you take her, Todd?",
        "Todd: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Blair: Thanks.",
        "Todd: Here, little girl. Come with a big man who's not afraid to say the \"G\" word.",
        "Blair: Uh, so you really think that, um, Dorian's gonna get married, even though this is probably a scam?",
        "Todd: Well, \"A\", she can get out of it because gay marriage isn't legal in this state, and, \"B\", she wouldn't be the first woman who tried. Marriage is a joke, Hope.",
        "Blair: Not always.",
        "Todd: Come on. Can you name me one happy couple who's been together for more than 5 years? See? Now, but this here -- look at this. This here is what counts. Our children. They're everything.",
        "Blair: Yes. They are the best of us.",
        "Todd: Yes, and they're forever. See, my kids -- that's it for me. They're the reason I'm still alive and kicking.",
        "Blair: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: For what?",
        "Blair: The year when they kept the kids away from you.",
        "Todd: \"They\"?",
        "Blair: Well, the court. Look, I don't want to fight with you about it. I --",
        "Todd: You know, that was, by far, the worse thing you've ever done. It was unforgivable.",
        "Blair: Well, you're here now.",
        "Todd: Yeah, and they are, too. When I think about how I could've lived my whole without knowing Sam existed...",
        "Blair: Um, I have something I need to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You need to tell Shaun now. Now, listen to me. No matter how hard it is, every minute you wait, it'll be worse.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, you're probably right.",
        "T\u00e9a: Good luck.",
        "Rachel: T\u00e9a, wait. You know, I am a professional counselor. I can even promise you confidentiality. Come on.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's a mess. Hmm. Oh, things with Todd usually are messy.",
        "Rachel: Word on the street is you were married to someone else when you married Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, for what it's worth, I actually thought I was divorced.",
        "Rachel: Why weren't you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Blair Cramer. She's made it her life's work to destroy my relationship with Todd.",
        "Rachel: And you gave her the ammo to do it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. And now she can make sure that Todd hates me for the rest of his life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Um, what I said before, when I said I didn't remember what happened before I fell, well, it's not --",
        "Starr: There are florist books all over the kitchen.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Starr: Yeah, and they're filled with different wedding bouquets and stuff, and it got me thinking. Like, well, Aunt Dorian, Aunt Amelia both have a -- that's really weird.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Starr: No, my mom, my dad, and my baby all in one room and no drama? No yelling?",
        "Blair: Well, it makes you think you walked into the wrong house, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah, it does. And it's permanent: 3 generations.",
        "Todd: Yeah, we were just talking about that: How kids are forever.",
        "Blair: How they bind us together.",
        "Todd: Oh, man, it's a good thing I didn't have a kid with T\u00e9a. I'd never be rid of her.",
        "Starr: Oh, you still have it, Dad. You know how to kill a really, really nice moment. Come on, Hope. Come to Mommy. Come on. It's time for your nap. Say good-bye to Grandma and grumpy, grumpy Grandpa.",
        "Blair: Have a nice nap, sweetie.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Todd: Okay, what were you gonna say?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Before she came in, you said you had something to tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Did you know that they're breaking the law? I took them to court, and the judge ruled that I can make my own decision about my surgery. How can you guys, of all people in this world, break the law?",
        "Nora: The judge's ruling was wrong?",
        "Matthew: Oh. So you guys can decide when the law is, you know, correct and when you can just blow it off?",
        "Bo: We still have the right to choose your school, and that's what we've done.",
        "Kevin: And it happens to be a great school, too, Matthew. I mean, Kelly and I want to send Zane there when he's old enough.",
        "Matthew: To boarding school? Bars on the windows? Electric fence?",
        "Nora: Oh, Matthew.",
        "Bo: Oh, come on, son.",
        "Kevin: It's not like that.",
        "Matthew: Well, I guess it doesn't have to be. It's not like I'll get very far on foot anyway -- ever.",
        "Kevin: Uh, look, I'll tell you what. Why don't I take you over to Warwick, get you settled in?",
        "Matthew: Whatever.",
        "Kevin: Give everybody here a break for a few hours.",
        "Matthew: Whatever.",

        "Matthew: You're kidding, right?",
        "Nora: You can hate us as much as you want to, but we are doing this for you.",
        "Matthew: Let's go, Kevin.",
        "Nora: And because we love you.",

        "Schuyler: Actually, Kim gave me the tickets.",
        "Gigi: Wow. Lucky guy. So you two are going?",
        "Schuyler: No. No, no. Tickets were actually kind of a gift. Uh, you take them.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, yeah. Take them. You and Rex can go.",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, that -- that's so nice. You don't want to go yourself?",
        "Schuyler: You know what? It's -- it's last-minute, and I don't have anyone to go with. And plus, I didn't spend 2 hours online trying to find them. So you, go. Have fun.",
        "Gigi: Well, I'd love to, but, um, Rex and I already have plans for tonight.",
        "Schuyler: Oh. You can't move it for a Hale Bopp reunion?",
        "Gigi: No, no. This is big.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah?",
        "Gigi: Yeah. We're going to couples counseling.",
        "Schuyler: Oh. Oh. Well, that's -- that's --",
        "Gigi: That's something guys hate?",
        "Schuyler: You bet. Yeah. And you're grinning.",
        "Gigi: I am because Rex is willing to do it anyway. And I know that it's gonna make us a lot stronger, and -- ohh -- and I love that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You want my help? You got it.",
        "Natalie: Oh, thank you.",
        "Rex: But I get involved in an open police case without their permission, they could take my P.I. license. And I don't know what I can do that they are not doing already.",
        "Natalie: I do. I found this in our room.",
        "Rex: Why didn't you give it to John?",
        "Natalie: Because I want a head start at finding Jared.",
        "Rex: So you can talk him into turning himself in?",
        "Natalie: Right. After I find out the whole story.",
        "Rex: You promise?",
        "Natalie: Yes! Rex, I swear! But we have to get to him first!",
        "Rex: So the lakeside? You two ever go there?",
        "Natalie: I've never even heard of the town.",
        "Rex: I have. It's hours from here.",
        "Natalie: Well, that's good that we're starting now, then.",
        "Rex: Whoa!",
        "Natalie: Rex, this is a manhunt! Okay? We only have a few hours.",
        "Rex: Nattie, I can't go tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: This can be the most important night of my life with Rex.",
        "Schuyler: Wow. That's big.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. He's committed enough to do something really hard for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Rex, I can't do this alone, and you're the only one I trust.",
        "Rex: Tomorrow. Maybe later tonight.",
        "Natalie: No, it's too late.",
        "Rex: No, you don't know what I've got going --",
        "Natalie: Rex, please! I feel like everything is closing in! Okay? If we don't find Jared tonight, I am afraid I'm never gonna see him again! Please, you have to help me!",
        "Natalie: Rex, it's already a statewide manhunt. Okay? Jared probably knows that. That means he's -- he's gonna run, or the cops are gonna get to him first. And God only knows what he's gonna do if he's desperate. Please!",
        "Rex: Okay. Just let me call Gigi first. When she hears what it is --",
        "Natalie: No, no, no. No, no, no.",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Natalie: You can't tell Gigi. Gigi works for John. She breathes a word, he'll find out.",
        "Rex: You're right!",
        "Natalie: That was easy.",
        "Rex: We are withholding evidence in a double murder. If I tell Gigi anything, she'll be part of it, too.",
        "Natalie: Rex, I'm sorry.",
        "Rex: Forget it. God knows I've done worse with less reason. Ohh. I'll handle Gigi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Who knows? After tonight, I might even be able to stomach my sister.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, therapy ain't that miraculous...or fast.",
        "Gigi: I'm looking for the good.",
        "Schuyler: But it can save your life and your relationships.",
        "Gigi: That's better.",
        "Schuyler: So Stacy's still the big problem between you two?",
        "Gigi: She claims she's carrying Rex's child.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Stupid question.",
        "Gigi: No, it's not. Yeah, she's a problem. She's a big one, but she's not the only one.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Gigi: Hey.",
        "Rex: Gigi, I got to say this really fast. And I'm really, really sorry, but I can't go tonight.",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Rex: Something came up: Work. Something huge. I have to go out of town.",
        "Gigi: Tonight? You -- you can't leave tomorrow?",
        "Rex: No, I can't.",
        "Gigi: That's it?",
        "Rex: I can't -- I can't say more. I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't really, really important.",
        "Gigi: More important than us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Okay, Jared Banks: Hot and local.",
        "Stacy: Right. But he's Buchanan by marriage to Rex's sister, actually. He's also wanted for two murders.",
        "Kim: Three strikes again. This family is damn near useless to me. Too bad the kid in the wheelchair is so young.",
        "Stacy: Wait! Huh. I think I found you Mr. Right Buchanan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I can't leave him when he's this angry.",
        "Bo: Well, I don't think that us being here will help, even if we could stay.",
        "Nora: No, I can stay. I can, because I can quit my job.",
        "Bo: Nora --",
        "Nora: Oh, I may not even have a choice about that one, but I can. I -- I want to be here from now on. Don't you?",
        "Bo: Yeah. If it would make things better for Matthew, sure. Of course. But it won't. He'll just focus on going back and having that surgery instead of the great life that he could still have.",
        "Nora: Maybe.",
        "Bo: We both got to get back. And maybe if we're not here for him to push against, maybe he'll stop.",
        "Nora: Huh. Did you ever think you'd hit the point in life where you wish your son wasn't a fighter?",
        "Bo: Oh, he's a Buchanan. You know, we all pick stupid fights when we're young. Pa had the scars to prove that.",
        "Nora: I hate the lying. Lying to Rachel when we left. Lying to Matthew now by not telling him about Shaun.",
        "Bo: Well, you told Rachel the truth, and we will tell Matthew about Shaun.",
        "Nora: And when are we gonna do that, when we feel like it?",
        "Bo: When it's best for Matthew.",
        "Nora: You know what the hardest part about all of this is? I know exactly how Matthew feels.",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: I mean, I got to tell you something. I don't like us very much right now.",
        "Bo: Is there anything you want to do differently?",
        "Nora: No. I just can't stand how much he hates us. I'm having a really hard time with that.",
        "Bo: Come on.",
        "Nora: God, Bo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: The third years can be a bit shirty this time of year.",
        "Matthew: Excuse me?",
        "Kevin: Uh, it means in a bad mood.",
        "Woman: What with exams and all. But I'm sure you won't be a nobby no-mates for long.",
        "Matthew: Really? Gee, where's the Quidditch field?",
        "Woman: You can't try out for the team until you've passed advanced spells and potions. Would you like to see your digs now? I'm sure your roommate's here.",
        "Matthew: Can't wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: It's not that big a deal, really.",
        "Todd: Are you sure? Because it sounded like maybe you remembered more than you told me.",
        "Blair: No, I -- but I did find out before your wedding that their divorce wasn't finalized. She thought that Ross had filed the papers.",
        "Todd: But he hadn't, and you knew that.",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a should've known, too.",
        "Todd: True.",
        "Blair: And she should've told you about Ross, whether the divorce was finalized or not, and she had all the time in the world to do it. She could've done it, actually, at any time.",
        "Todd: That's also true. Yes.",
        "Blair: So if she was done with Ross, then what was the big deal?",
        "Todd: I don't know. It just seems to me there's a piece missing still.",
        "Blair: Oh, I just wish that I could remember it. Ohh --",
        "Todd: You all right? Hey --",
        "Blair: Yeah. I --",
        "Todd: You want some meds or anything?",
        "Blair: No. I'm feeling lightheaded. I think I need to lie down. Would -- would you mind helping me to my room, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: T\u00e9a, how much more damage can Blair do to you and Todd?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, it's not all Blair's fault. Much as I'd like to blame it all on her, it's my fault, too.",
        "Rachel: But Todd knows about your other husband, so it's all out in the open, right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not quite.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I will explain everything as soon as I get back, okay? We'll reschedule, and I will go as soon as I get back, okay? Okay?",
        "Gigi: Okay.",
        "Natalie: Did I just ruin your life?",
        "Rex: No. It's fine. It's just one night.",
        "Natalie: Rex, I don't know what I would do right now without you.",
        "Rex: Let's go find your husband.",

        "Gigi: Rex doesn't have time for us.",
        "Schuyler: That's not what it sounded like.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no. He just took a top-secret job. That he can do. No problem. But if I hear a word about it, I'll be in trouble. Does that make any sense to you?",
        "Schuyler: No, it sounds like it's dangerous, and he didn't want to worry you.",
        "Gigi: Then what the hell is Rex doing taking a job like that? He has a son to think about.",
        "Schuyler: And you.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, well, obviously I am way down the list.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, I highly doubt that.",
        "Gigi: Oh, you're defending him?",
        "Schuyler: No! No --",
        "Gigi: Sorry. There's just nothing you can say right now.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, I got that about 5 minutes ago.",
        "Gigi: What the hell am I supposed to do tonight? Go home and worry about Rex all night with not a clue what to do about it?",
        "Schuyler: No. No. You're gonna take these Hale Bopp tickets and you're gonna go with me to the concert, because I think that's the only thing that's gonna distract you tonight.",
        "Gigi: Sold.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Talk to me.",
        "Gigi: Okay. So he's single, and he's not wanted for murder, and he's a citizen of Llanview.",
        "Kim: All good.",
        "Stacy: And he has a really high-power job, so he works all the time. So you could totally shop all day long.",
        "Kim: And spend his dividend checks. He's kind of cute, you know?",
        "Stacy: Yeah. I mean, I think you should totally go for it.",

        "Bo: Matthew's gonna be fine.",
        "Nora: Really?",
        "Bo: Yeah, really. He can't stay mad forever. It's not who he is. He's gonna make friends, and it's gonna be a whole new world.",
        "Nora: Okay. Keep saying that. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: We'll take it from here.",
