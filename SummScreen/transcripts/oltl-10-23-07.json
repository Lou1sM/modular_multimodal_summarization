        "Sarah comes into the Capricorn Club per Cristian's request. He makes up some lame excuse for getting her there at that time of morning. Sarah sees through his little ploy and accuses him of being jealous that she and Jared had shared. Nash and Jessica come up with a ploy to get Jared out of their home, but it seems to backfire on them when their other two poker players leaves. Nash challenges Jared to a poker game to regain sole ownership of the house and vineyard. Jared lets them know that nothing will stop him from going out with Sarah. Todd sneaks into Blair's bedroom to pack his things to go to search for Tommy with John and Michael. Todd and Blair share a passionate kiss good-bye. Natalie barges in on Miles and tells him what has been going on over to Jessica's and Nash's and Jared barging in on them. Miles sees through Natalie's reactions to the situation and accuses her of having feelings for Jared. Natalie denies what Miles is saying as the truth. John and Marty also share a passionate good-bye. Todd soon arrives. Michael lets Roxy know that he had known for quite awhile that Tommy was really Todd's son. Michael calls John and lets him know that he is ready to go. John, reluctantly, lets Michael know that Todd had just arrived also. As they get ready to leave, the Llanview Police arrive and place Michael under arrest for perjury. Todd whispers to John that Michael will not be accompanying them on their little road trip."

        "Sarah: Ok. So what do you want?",
        "Cristian: Hmm. Good morning to you, too.",
        "Sarah: No, it's too early for \"good morning.\" Why did you call me in?",
        "Cristian: Well, if you're going to be booking bands, we're going to have to talk budget.",
        "Sarah: Now?",
        "Cristian: The sooner the better.",
        "Sarah: What a load.",
        "Cristian: Excuse me?",
        "Sarah: You don't want to talk about money. You dragged me in here at the crack of dawn, because you're pissed that I kissed Jared Banks last night.",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Knocking continues]",
        "Miles: All right, all right, all right, all right.",
        "Natalie: Do you have any cream?",
        "Miles: Good morning, Natalie. Come on in.",
        "Natalie: You know, when my mom's in town, we never run out of anything. And now that she's not here, I mean, I guess I'm going to have to be the one going through the cupboards, figuring out what we need, making a list and giving it to Lois, tell her to go to the store, and I'm from a trailer park! Ok, I don't want to ask Lois to go to the store for me, and I certainly don't have time to do it by myself!",
        "Miles: Can you give me a ballpark figure on how long this rant's going to last?",
        "Natalie: Rant?",
        "Miles: Well, whatever you're missing, I -- I don't think it's milk. What's going on with you?",

        "[Rock music plays]",
        "Jared: Ok, what the hell is going on here?",
        "Nash: Oh, good morning! Just a friendly game of poker -- want to buy in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "John: Be right there.",
        "Marty: Hi.",
        "John: Hey.",
        "Marty: I -- I brought you some coffee.",
        "John: Thanks.",
        "Marty: Oh, is this a bad time?",
        "John: No-- actually, it is.",
        "Marty: I'm sorry, I probably should've called first.",
        "John: Look, I haven't forgotten everything with us. But the verdict went down, and I've been in free-fall ever since.",
        "Marty: It's ok.",
        "John: You say that like you mean it.",
        "Marty: I do.",

        "Jared: Give me a break! You're playing poker at this hour in the morning?",
        "Nash: Oh, no, no, no, no, we started much earlier, but we had to keep it down because of Bree. You know, we just dropped her off at daycare, so now we can crank it up!",
        "[Cheers]",
        "Jessica: Hey, you remember Melba and Boo, Roxy's friends, right?",
        "Melba: Hi!",
        "Boo: What's shakin', baby?",
        "Jared: Ok, this is ridiculous!",
        "Nash: What's that? I can't hear you.",
        "Jared: Can you turn that down?",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Jared: Turn it down!",
        "Jessica: Oh, is it bothering you?",
        "Jared: Please!",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Nash: My heavens, he is cranky in the morning.",
        "[Volume lowers]",
        "Jessica: Yeah, after we gave him the master bedroom and --",
        "Jared: I know what you're doing here.",
        "Jessica: Everything.",
        "Jared: You're setting me up, and it's not going to work. Have no idea what he's talking about, do you?",
        "Jessica: Got me.",
        "Jared: The -- the loud music, these two -- characters. It's amateur night and it's not going to change a thing.",
        "Nash: All I did was invite Boo and Melba up from Atlantic City -- hey, I got to win back some of the cash you got from me, right?",
        "Jared: You actually want to risk a rematch? You did lose the controlling interest in your vineyard last time we played cards, Nash.",
        "Nash: That's true. That is true, but now I got Jessica here, so maybe my luck will change. Hey, take a seat.",
        "Melba: Yeah, take a load off.",
        "Boo: Yeah we lost a wad to you, too, and me and Melba, we don't like to lose.",
        "Melba: Uh-uh.",
        "Jessica: It's not like you have a job to go to or anything.",
        "Nash: Ooh!",
        "Boo: You going to sit down and ante up, or what?",
        "Jared: Why not?",
        "Melba: Whoa! Maybe you ought to throw some clothes on, or I'm going to have one hell of a time concentrating on my cards.",
        "[Boo and Melba laugh]",
        "Jared: All right, well, don't lose all your money before I get back.",
        "Boo: Ooh.",
        "Nash: With any luck, he'll be out of our hair by the end of the day.",
        "Jessica: And more importantly, out of the house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Ugh. What in the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Todd: God, you didn't have to bite me.",
        "Blair: Well, you know -- I didn't, really? I wake up from the middle of a -- a deep sleep, and you have your hand over my mouth -- you're lucky that I didn't hurt you worse.",
        "Todd: I was trying not to wake the kids. Actually, I was trying to make sure that Dorian didn't release the hounds.",
        "Blair: Well, you scared me to death.",
        "Todd: Sorry.",
        "Blair: What are you doing skulking around my room in the morning anyway like this?",
        "Todd: Why don't you just go back to sleep?",
        "Blair: I went to bed last night and you weren't home. Did you sleep at all?",
        "Todd: A couple hours.",
        "Blair: Todd -- what's going on? What are you doing?",
        "Todd: Getting some stuff. You know, the maid keeps putting my clothes in your room -- she thinks because we're married, we're sleeping together.",
        "Blair: Well, are you getting all your stuff because you're moving back to the penthouse?",
        "Todd: No, I'm getting my stuff because I'm going to go find my kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey. Nice shirt.",
        "Roxy: Thought you'd like it. I got one for you, too.",
        "Michael: Thanks, but wearing a shirt like that in front of Todd would be like waving a red flag in front of a bull.",
        "Roxy: Screw Todd. Since when do you care what he thinks or feels about anything?",
        "Michael: Since myself, himself, and my brother decided we'd go looking for Marcie -- together.",
        "Roxy: What? You want to say that again?",
        "Michael: The three of us will be spending a lot of time together in an automobile, so I think pissing the guy off deliberately is probably a bad idea.",
        "Roxy: Let me see if I got this right -- the three of you are going to be in a car together looking for Marcie and the baby? Speaking of screws, I think you got a couple loose.",
        "Michael: You may be right, but we have to find her before the FBI does, and my brother wants to keep an eye on Todd, so it kind of works out.",
        "Roxy: Have you heard from her?",
        "Michael: No. My brother tracked her to her brother's house in New Jersey, but she was gone before we got there.",
        "Roxy: Hey, you got to give her a lot of credit. You know, it takes a lot of moxie to snatch Tommy and run off like that.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, I'll tell you one thing -- there is no way she's going to give that kid up without a fight.",
        "Roxy: And now she's got to stay one step ahead of the FBI?",
        "Michael: Yeah -- the FBI, the cops, and Todd.",
        "Roxy: Ooh, man. If she can pull this off, I bet I know the subject matter of her next bestseller.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Well, don't worry, I didn't come here to talk about us. I -- I really wanted to know if you found out anything about Marcie.",
        "John: We lost her again.",
        "Marty: Oh, I know how worried you must be. Is there anything I can do to help?",
        "John: No. I think I've got it covered.",
        "Marty: So do you have any idea where she is?",
        "John: We're pretty sure her brother helped her dump her car and get a fake ID -- did all that before she ducked out on us.",
        "Marty: I really am sorry. I know how much that little boy means to you.",
        "John: Yeah, he means a lot.",
        "Marty: I understand, I mean, how horrible it must be not -- not knowing where they are or what's happening to them.",
        "John: It's tougher on Mike.",
        "Marty: You know, I just don't understand it. How could she just leave him behind?",
        "John: Mike knew that Manning is Tommy's father and he didn't tell her. She thinks that's the reason why she lost her son.",
        "Marty: Well, if she gets caught.",
        "John: It's not a matter of \"if,\" it's a matter of \"when.\"",
        "Marty: Oh, I -- I didn't realize you were going somewhere. But you're going after her, aren't you? I -- I guess I should've known.",

        "Jared: Yeah?",
        "Jessica: Are you sure you don't want something to drink other than coffee?",
        "Jared: Nope, coffee is fine, thank you.",
        "[Boo gargles]",
        "Jared: Do you re-- do you really have to make that noise?",
        "Boo: Oh. I'm sorry, sorry.",
        "[Sipping loudly]",
        "Boo: Ah. It's your bet, Jarhead.",
        "Jared: Ok, don't call me that. Do not call me that.",
        "Boo: Well, Jessica told me it was your nickname.",
        "[Boo chuckles]",
        "Jared: How did you know that?",
        "Jessica: Natalie's my sister, she tells me everything.",
        "Jared: Well, I don't like it, so don't call me it.",
        "Boo: Stop stalling, Jar-- Jared. Bet or fold?",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: Call. Full boat -- 4s over queens.",
        "Boo: Damn.",
        "Jessica: Jared? Jared?",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Jared: So now you're going to start throwing peanuts at me?",
        "Jessica: Well, you're supposed to catch them in your mouth. See?",
        "Jared: Ok, I could choke on that.",
        "Nash: It's ok, I know the Heimlich maneuver.",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah, that's -- that's funny, ok. So what do we have in store for tomorrow? Do we got clowns and bagpipes coming?",
        "Jessica: I don't know what he's talking about.",
        "Jared: This -- this lame attempt to annoy me -- it couldn't be more obvious.",
        "Jessica: But is it working?",
        "Jared: Ok, sorry, guys. Not only am I not leaving, I haven't lost a cent.",
        "Nash: Ah, but, you know, you haven't actually won anything yet, either, have you?",
        "Melba: Hmm -- no, we all pretty much broke even.",
        "Boo: It's been real, but we got a pretty long drive back to Atlantic City, so, hey, let's do this again sometime?",
        "Jared: Hmm.",
        "Nash: Oh, well, hey, next time, don't even bother calling first, just come by, money in hand.",
        "Boo: Will do.",
        "Melba: Aw. Thanks, honey.",
        "Jessica: I'll walk you to the door.",
        "Melba: Mm-hmm. You got my purse, honey?",
        "Boo: Oh -- maybe.",
        "Nash: So what do you say, Jarhead, one more hand?",
        "Jared: Heads-up poker, you and me, huh?",
        "Nash: Hmm.",
        "Jared: Hope you got some",
        "Nash: Actually, I do. We each put up 10% of our shares of the vineyard. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Don't flatter yourself, Sarah. This has nothing to do with you kissing Jared Banks.",
        "Sarah: It sure had you and Natalie pretty steamed up last night.",
        "Cristian: Listen, if you want to ignore what we said and date a loser like Jared, it's your business.",
        "Sarah: So you call me in here -- before the gas 'n sip even opens -- to work on a budget?",
        "Cristian: Well, it's quiet. It's a good time to talk. Plus, you got to know the bottom line once you start haggling with these band managers.",
        "Sarah: You're playing with me. You know I don't have a clue about any of that financial crap. I use my contacts to book bands, that's what I do. Whether or not they bring in money, that's your problem.",
        "Cristian: Like hell. You book a band that costs us more than what they make, and the club loses money instead of making it.",
        "Sarah: So why don't you do the budget and tell me how much I can pay the bands? I'm going back to sleep.",
        "Cristian: You know, this is so you. You want to have all the fun, but you don't want any of the responsibility.",
        "Sarah: What's with the lecture? Put on a suit, and you'd be my grandpa.",
        "Cristian: You don't want to learn? Fine.",
        "Sarah: So this mood you're in has nothing to do with me and Jared?",
        "Cristian: Nothing.",
        "Sarah: You're sure?",
        "Cristian: Positive.",
        "Sarah: God. You are in such denial, it's scary.",
        "Cristian: Denial about what?",
        "Sarah: About liking me, and being jealous that I kissed another guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm upset because I have no cream for my coffee, and you're saying that it's a big deal? I don't --",
        "Miles: No, I was just asking you what was going on with you, that's all. You're the one who's making a big deal out of it. You know, my psychiatrist would have a field day with you.",
        "Natalie: Oh, God, tell me you're not turning into one of those?",
        "Miles: One of what?",
        "Natalie: You're seeing a therapist, and then all of a sudden, everything and everyone has some sort of hidden meaning to it. You know, maybe a shrink's not such a good idea for you.",
        "Miles: You know, you didn't have a problem with me seeing a shrink before. What's different? Hey, could it be that there's something going on with you because of John and Marty?",
        "Natalie: No, I -- I told you that I'm getting past all that. It has nothing to do with John. Huh.",
        "Miles: So -- it's something. What's his name?",
        "Natalie: Why does it have to be a him?",
        "Miles: Natalie --",
        "Natalie: Ok, ok. Yeah, it's that guy I told you about -- Jared Banks.",
        "Miles: The guy that you don't want to work with?",
        "Natalie: Yes.",
        "Miles: Well, is he causing you trouble at work?",
        "Natalie: Yes -- well, no, I -- I fired him.",
        "Miles: So what's the problem?",
        "Natalie: He just won't back off. You know, ever since I fired him \u0096 he moved in with Jessica, and now he's driving them crazy. He won't move out unless I give him his job back, which I offered him his job back, and he wouldn't take it.",
        "Miles: So why did you fire him?",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm -- you're not going to believe this. Ok, out of the blue, he grabs me, kisses me, and then he has the nerve tell me that I liked it.",
        "Miles: Arrogant.",
        "Natalie: Mm-hmm, and it gets better. He figures out that I'm on to him, it's not going to work on me, so he starts coming on to my cousin Sarah.",
        "Miles: And you care about this because --",
        "Natalie: Because she's my cousin, and he's a con artist, and he kissed her and he's taking her out on a date.",
        "Miles: Do you want to know what I think?",
        "Natalie: I think you're going to tell me whether I want you to or not.",
        "Miles: I think you're bent out of shape because you're jealous. Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You've been suspended, John, you don't have the authority to do this.",
        "John: Well, even if I wasn't suspended, this would be out of my jurisdiction. The minute she crossed state line, this case was turned over he feds.",
        "Marty: Well, then why don't you let them handle it?",
        "John: Oh, I think I should find Marcie first.",
        "Marty: Ok, what are you not telling me?",
        "John: I know the agent who's in charge of the case from back in my days at the Bureau, Lee Ramsey -- he's a real ass.",
        "Marty: You don't think that he would hurt Marcie or the baby, do you?",
        "John: I think he could push Marcie into doing something dangerous. Everything will go down a lot easier if I find her first.",
        "Marty: Just be careful.",
        "John: Well, it's not like she's armed and dangerous.",
        "Marty: Well, from what you said, though, this Lee Ramsey guy -- he's not going to like it that you're going after her without him knowing it, and, you know, you're too good of a cop to go to jail for interfering with a federal investigation. It could ruin your career -- you know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What makes you think that I am jealous of Sarah and Jared? Please.",
        "Miles: Because of the way you're acting.",
        "Natalie: And how the hell am I acting?",
        "Miles: Do you remember what I was like when I found out about John and Marty?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- let's see. You were obsessed. I can't stand being in the same room as Jared.",
        "Miles: And my therapist would say that's denial.",
        "Natalie: Advice, Miles -- cut back on the shrink.",
        "Miles: Well, if I do, maybe you should pick up the open hours, because I think you'd benefit from expressing all these feelings about Jared.",
        "Natalie: So the guy slobbers on me and I'm a goner? I mean, come on -- Miles, that is so demeaning to me. You think I'm just going to fall for this con who's a good kisser? Ok. Maybe I have feelings for him.",
        "Miles: Would you like to discuss these feelings?",
        "Natalie: Hate. Distrust, loathing. Those are my feelings for Jared. See? I shared. Happy now?",
        "Miles: Natalie, I just want to help you. I owe you that. When I was going off the rails, you were there for me. I just want to do the same for you.",
        "Natalie: But I'm not going off the rail Miles. I just want to protect Nash and Sarah from Jared.",
        "Miles: Ok. Ok, fine.",
        "Natalie: So you believe me now?",
        "Miles: No. I believe that you believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Jealous? Of you and Jared? Not a chance.",
        "Sarah: Oh. So the idea that you might like me makes you laugh?",
        "Cristian: I do like you, Sarah. I think you're a great girl, and that's why it makes me kind of -- I don't know -- sad, I guess, to see you doing something so stupid as hooking up with a guy like Jared.",
        "Sarah: Oh, come on. You don't even know him.",
        "Cristian: You don't know him. I think I have the guy's number.",
        "Sarah: Well, you're just listening to Natalie.",
        "Cristian: Do you really want to hook up with a guy who's got it in for your family?",
        "Sarah: From what I've heard, he has every right to be mad at Princess Jessica after what she did to him.",
        "Cristian: It was Tess, not Jess.",
        "Sarah: Oh, what, so all is forgiven? I mean, she treats the guy like crap, throws him into prison for something he didn't do, but she was sick, so he's just supposed to let it go?",
        "Cristian: Listen, this has nothing to do with Jared and Jessica or Natalie and Jared. This is about you and Jared. And Natalie says that the only reason this guy wants to hook up with you is because you're a Buchanan.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, I know, I was there. She acts as if I couldn't possibly attract a man on my own. How sweet of cousin Natalie to look out for me.",
        "Cristian: We just don't want to see you get hurt, or disappointed, Sarah.",
        "Sarah: Well, thank you very much, but I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: From what I know about your history, I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, we up for another hand?",
        "Nash: Actually, I just proposed another hand to him. I actually proposed that we each put up 10% of our stake in the vineyard. That way, he'll have a bigger piece of the pie.",
        "Jessica: Ooh.",
        "Jared: And if I lose, you have controlling interest.",
        "Nash: Yeah.",
        "Jared: Do you think I'm a fool?",
        "Nash: , I -- I think that you're a guy who likes to take risks.",
        "Jared: Should I rethink that every time we've played poker, I won?",
        "Nash: We've only played once.",
        "Jared: Well, if I win again, do you agree to stop with the loud music in the morning and the -- the weird types at the breakfast table?",
        "Nash: Probably not.",

        "Jared: Yeah, well, payback's a bitch, and so are you.",

        "Michael: Nothing is going to happen to Marcie.",
        "Roxy: Hey, right. You know, I didn't mean to imply that it would. It's just that she's between a crock and a hard place. She's got the feds after her and she's got you three guys after her. So no matter who catches her and the baby, she's going to have to give the baby back to Todd. Am I right about that?",
        "Michael: Yeah. Yeah, that's the truth. But I think it'll be easier for her if we find her before the FBI does.",
        "Roxy: Oh, man, I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Michael: Well, maybe it's not, but look, I have to -- I have to try and find her. I have to try and talk some sense into her. I have to tell her she's not going to be able to get away with this.",
        "Roxy: She's already getting away with it.",
        "Michael: Yeah, the FBI just put a new guy on the case. The guy's a real pit bull. It's only a matter of time before he brings her in. Now, if she turns herself in, maybe she can avoid heavy jail time.",
        "Roxy: Well, why should she go to the joint when she's running away with her own kid?",
        "Michael: Tommy's not legally ours anymore, you know that. I can't let Marcie go to jail, not after everything I've already done to her.",
        "Roxy: What have you done to her?",
        "Michael: I found out last winter that Todd was really Tommy's father, and I didn't tell her anything. I -- I wanted to protect her.",
        "Roxy: So how the hell did she find out?",
        "Michael: Lindsay.",
        "Roxy: Whoa. Man.",
        "Michael: Yeah. \"Whoa\" is right. Oh, Roxy -- this thing is such a mess, you know? I keep thinking that maybe if I had -- if I had told her, maybe we could have done something, you know? Maybe we could have disappeared. But I didn't. And now Todd's going to end up with Tommy, no matter what. You know, the best I can hope for in this situation is that Marcie can -- can get out of this with the least amount of suffering.",

        "Todd: Oh, ye of little faith",
        "Blair: Why won't you let the police and the FBI handle all of this?",
        "Todd: I don't trust the police and the FBI to do it right. And actually, I'm kind of working with them, anyway.",
        "Blair: \"Kind of work--\" what do -- what do you mean, \"kind of working\" with them?",

        "Todd: Oh, come on, Blair.",
        "Blair: Don't treat me like I'm a nagging wife here I've been in on this with you from the beginning, and I expect a little truth here, a little honesty. You have to tell me everything, for the kids' sake.",
        "Todd: Well, you know the guy, and you have his number.",
        "Blair: Rex?",

        "Todd: You know me, Blair. I'm not going to sit around by the phone waiting for it to ring when one of my kids is in trouble. I'm going to go out there and I'm not going to come back until I got him. That's it.",
        "Blair: Well, I know how much you want to find him, Todd. Just -- will you be careful, please?",

        "Michael: Well, he's a -- he's an amazing kid, you know?",

        "Roxy: Just a couple of hours a week, and, really, it'll be a piece of cake. You know, we could serve juice and, you know, do art projects like, you know, gluing up stuff on top of other stuff and -- and, well, you could be, like, the basketball coach.",

        "Cristian: That's a little cold, don't you think?",
        "Sarah: I didn't mean it the way it sounded -- I hope she wakes up today. But waiting for her to wake up is another great way out of making a decision about what you want to do with your life.",
