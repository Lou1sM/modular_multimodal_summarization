It belongs to a girl who is Tea's daughter. Her name is Daniella Rayburn. Matthew doesn't have a chance to tell Destiny where he is before Daniella catches him using her phone. But Destiny is able to tell that the call came from England. And she asks David Vickers if he can help her find Matthew since Matthew is his brother. Brody gets a call from his sister, Nadine who tells him she needs his help. Jessica urges him to go and tells him she will be ok. But as soon as he's gone, she gets a call that sounds like it's from Nash. Tea confesses to Rachel that she and Todd have a child and Ross has falsely believed she is his.

        "Todd: You're good. Yeah.",
        "Blair: What are you doing?",
        "Todd: I'm going to call the doctor. You've been woozy since you got back.",
        "Blair: No, look, I'm fine. I just -- I just need to lie down, that's all.",
        "Todd: You sure?",
        "Blair: Yeah. Ahem. I guess it's not a good time to bring up what happened with you and T\u00e9a. I mean, at least until I'm stronger. Look, I know that we're not together anymore, Todd, but you'll always be the father of my children, and I --",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: I just hate seeing you in so much pain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ross: Ah. Freedom's just another word for a long, hot shower without having to worry about dropping the soap. Hey, you know I'm grateful for you to -- or for springing me.",
        "Elijah: Yeah, well, it's Blair Cramer you should thank, for dropping those kidnapping charges against you.",
        "Ross: All you had to do was ask?",
        "Elijah: Her ex-husband was there to take her home from the hospital. You know, right time, right place.",
        "Ross: Look, I know that you think she did it just to make Todd jealous.",
        "Elijah: No, I know that's why she did it. Trust me, bro, you're not the man she wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Can we just pretend that I never said anything?",
        "Rachel: T\u00e9a, wait! I don't think so.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ugh.",
        "Rachel: What child?",
        "[Rachel sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Remember how --",
        "[T\u00e9a chuckles]",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd and Ross and I were stranded on that island together?",
        "Rachel: Yeah, it's kind of a hard story to forget.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I never told anyone how this all happened.",
        "Rachel: How what happened?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh -- well, Todd and I had sex on the island, okay? It was really romantic. It was a deserted island, palm trees, the ocean, love of my life. Only Todd wanted to get back to the mainland the whole time, with or without me. So -- when he was making this raft, I got between him and the raft and I -- I told him how I felt about him.",
        "Rachel: And then?",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: And -- and then --",
        "Rachel: Okay. It's a little offbeat, I guess, but still romantic.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Real romantic. Especially the part where it becomes patently obvious that he was still in love with Blair.",
        "Rachel: Did you know you were pregnant?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I didn't know at the time. I mean, I -- I was with Ross later, and then I just figured the baby was Ross'.",
        "Rachel: Come on, T\u00e9a, you're a smart cookie. You had to have known that there was at least a chance.",
        "T\u00e9a: He was fashioning a raft out of palm fronds, Rachel, to get back to Blair. Todd had made his choice, and it wasn't me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Pain? I'm not the one who fell.",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Blair: Well, Dorian fixed the window. I guess I'm never going to know whether I fell or I was pushed.",
        "Todd: So you really think you pissed her off enough to make her want to kill you?",
        "Blair: Maybe.",
        "Todd: Well, maybe she figured out that you knew what her other big secret was, which must have been huge.",
        "Blair: You know what? Maybe we shouldn't -- we shouldn't talk about it now.",
        "Todd: Well, I thought you wanted to remember it.",
        "Blair: I do.",
        "Todd: Well, okay, then why the 180?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Todd chose Blair, so you chose Ross?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, Rachel, Todd and I had sex once. The chances were slim. Ross and I had sex many times. I figured chances were good it was Ross'. You know, sue me.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: Quite frankly, I didn't want to know.",
        "Rachel: What changed?",
        "T\u00e9a: I got a call from Ray Montez to represent him. Don't laugh. But I figured that was a sign for me to come back to Llanview and -- and finally, you know, face Todd, to know whether or not the baby was his. So, I had a DNA test run. It wasn't hard to get a sample. And that's when I knew for sure. The baby I had had all those years ago was not Ross'. It was Todd's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Matt looks about as happy to be here as I am.",
        "Headmistress: Mr. Buchanan's name is Matthew, not Matt.",
        "Tom: Oh. You hear that, M.B.? You know, we're misters and she's the mistress. You ever read \"Fanny Hill\", hmm?",
        "Headmistress: Thomas, you've already cost your house 10 penalty points this week. Would you like to try for 20?",
        "Tom: Sure. Why not? Double or nothing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: You have to help me.",
        "David: I'm sure there's a logical explanation.",
        "Destiny: I called the hospital in Seattle. They said Matthew's surgery was cancelled. He never showed.",
        "David: Well, maybe he changed his mind.",
        "Destiny: After fighting so hard to have that surgery? Something's happened to him. I know it.",
        "David: Something like what?",
        "Destiny: You're his brother, aren't you? Find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bree: More chicken.",
        "Jessica: More chicken? Why don't you try your peas and carrots, huh?",
        "[Brody gasps]",
        "Jessica: Try those peas and carrots, okay, Miss? Have you found Jared yet?",
        "Brody: Not yet.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Brody: I'm sorry.",
        "Jessica: I talked to Natalie. She's going out of her mind.",
        "Brody: So is Charlie.",
        "Jessica: Well, you're going to have to find him soon, because I don't know how much more either of them can take.",
        "Brody: Well, we got an APB out, and John's working around the clock.",
        "Jessica: I know, I know. I just feel so bad for her, you know? I -- I keep on racking my brain for things to do to help her, but -- I even asked her, you know? And she said all she wants is Bree and I to stay here.",
        "Brody: Your sister -- she's used to being the one to take care of things.",
        "Jessica: I know. She's usually taking care of me. Hey, are those peas and carrots a no-go?",
        "Brody: Hey, doesn't it creep you out -- the elephant?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, it does. But what am I supposed to do? I can't take it away from her. She thinks her dad gave it to her.",
        "Brody: Yeah, I --",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: Okay. Well, now, you're just playing with it. Come on, let's go upstairs. Lois will give you a bath, okay? Somebody's life is going to be normal.",
        "Bree: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Yes, yes, yes, yes \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: It's going straight to voicemail. Hi, Dad, it's me, your son -- David -- Buchanan.",
        "[David chuckles]",
        "David: Listen, I heard that maybe Matthew's surgery was cancelled, and I was just wondering if --",
        "Destiny: Ask him where they are -- what he did with Matthew.",
        "David: I am an adult. I will handle this. Listen, I'm here with Matthew's friend Destiny. We haven't heard from you, and so we were just hoping maybe you'd give us a jingle, when you have a chance. That'd be super. Okay, thanks, Dad. What?",
        "Destiny: That's your idea of doing something? I could have done that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Oh, I'm sorry if I implied the spankings you administered were --",
        "Headmistress: I assure you, Mr. Buchanan, this school has never administered spankings.",
        "Tom: Huh. Oh, you'll go easy on him? Probably because you're in a wheelchair.",
        "Headmistress: You have just earned your house another 10 penalty points. I'm confident you'll be happy here, Mr. Buchanan. Please let us know if you'd like to transfer to another room.",
        "Tom: Top of the evening to ya -- witch.",
        "Matthew: She's not so bad.",
        "Tom: What are you, 12?",
        "Matthew: I'm 15.",
        "Tom: And she isn't okay, she's the warden.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, and this is a school, right? So as long as we go to class, we can come and go as much as we want, right?",
        "Tom: Yeah, and we can play with the unicorns on the way out, right? You ever read \"Tom Brown's School Days\"?",
        "Matthew: Well --",
        "Tom: This is a British public school. Which means \"private\" in American. Which means they can do whatever the hell they want to us.",
        "Matthew: So we're on lockdown?",
        "Tom: Welcome to the club, my friend. Welcome to the club.",
        "[Matthew sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Blair was totally covering in front of her ex. She said she had no idea why you would come to visit her in the hospital. But she also said she was so sorry you got hurt. So when I mentioned dropping the kidnapping charges, she was all for it. Manning got a little hot and bothered. He told me to tell you to stick with the wife you have and stay the hell away from Blair.",
        "Ross: Right, sure. And you're -- you're telling me all this because --",
        "Elijah: Because you're going after a woman who can't wait to see the last of you. It's obvious -- she's still in love with her ex.",
        "Ross: You want to know who I'm going after, Eli? My kid. Those ancient kidnapping charges -- those are the only things holding me back.",
        "Elijah: I wouldn't say that, little brother. You're out on bail. There are still a few other charges pending.",
        "Ross: So what am I supposed to do, just sit here and do nothing, huh, while T\u00e9a walks all over me?",
        "Elijah: No, that's not what I'm saying --",
        "Ross: Eli, my kid means everything to me.",
        "Elijah: I know, Ross. Just promise me you're not going to do anything stupid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: So how long have you known that Todd was the father?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, when I first got back to Llanview, he was in love with Marty Saybrooke, and he was in jail for supposedly having raped her again.",
        "Rachel: So you figured leave well enough alone?",
        "T\u00e9a: Exactly. I didn't have the tests run until later. I was representing Todd and falling for him hard and fast. I -- I knew I had to know.",
        "Rachel: So when you found out then, why didn't you tell him?",
        "T\u00e9a: My child is the most important thing in the world to me. I still didn't trust Todd. The one thing I figured had changed after all these years was that he was finally over Blair. And then, I found him sleeping with her, yet again.",
        "Rachel: So, to punish him, you kept quiet about his child?",
        "T\u00e9a: No.",
        "Rachel: Come on, T\u00e9a, I'm not stupid. Life is one big negotiation to you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd sleeps with another woman, I'm supposed to reward him with our child?",
        "Rachel: So you wanted to hurt him because he hurt you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, damn it! Yes, I did!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, I've been hypnotized twice to get this memory out, and nobody wants to remember more than me. But I think me falling out of that window was just so frightening that my -- my brain won't let me go there. You know? I --",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm.",
        "Blair: I don't know what else to do, Todd.",
        "Todd: Well, I guess you could get hypnotized again and tell Marty to make you remember this time.",
        "Blair: Come on. It doesn't work that way. And I really want to remember exactly what T\u00e9a said right before she pushed me out that window. I -- I'm just -- I'm afraid.",
        "Todd: Of what?",
        "[Blair sighs]",
        "Blair: I don't know.",
        "Todd: Yeah, don't worry about it. You're home now. I'm here, and I'm not going to let anything happen to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You need to learn to chillax, little sister. What's the big deal? The B.E. jet is state of the art. If it went down --",
        "Destiny: I'm not worried about them crashing. I'm worried about what they did to Matthew.",
        "David: What who did?",
        "Destiny: His parents!",
        "[David sighs]",
        "Destiny: When he told them that he was going to Seattle to have the surgery, they said they wouldn't fight him anymore, that they'd all fly out together, one big happy family.",
        "David: The Buchanans are a big, happy family.",
        "Destiny: Matthew's mom begged my brother to do the surgery. And when he said he wouldn't, she lost it. Said there's nothing she wouldn't do to keep Matthew alive.",
        "David: That's what's known as a figure of speech.",
        "Destiny: Do I have to spell it out for you?",
        "David: Oh, no. I'm not good at spelling. In fact, in my fifth grade spelling bee, I went out on the word --",
        "Destiny: Kidnapped.",
        "David: No. Is that one of those words that has a hyphen in it?",
        "Destiny: I think Matthew's parents tricked him onto their plane and then took him somewhere he didn't want to go.",
        "David: I'm starting to get confused.",
        "Destiny: I saw them right before they left. They seemed all jumpy.",
        "David: Well, what do you expect? Their son was shipping out for delicate back surgery.",
        "Destiny: K-I-D-N-A-P-P-E-D. Are you going to help me find him, or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Listen. I know what you're going through, man, but -- your parents left you here, right?",
        "Matthew: I thought I was going to Seattle.",
        "Tom: Well, rainy enough for you?",
        "Matthew: I thought I was going to get the surgery that was going to get me my life back, but I guess my parents thought differently.",
        "Tom: So, you mean --",
        "Matthew: Yeah.",
        "Tom: So that's what's with the basketball sneaks, huh?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. My best friend gave them to me. You know, so when I could finally walk again, I can wear them. She wants me to call her when the surgery's over. Hey, do you have a cell phone I could use?",
        "Tom: No. Warden took it. Listen, I know this blows, but this is our chateau d'if. This is where we bide our time.",
        "Matthew: I don't have time. Look, every day I stay in this chair, that just lessens my chance of walking again. I can't live like this.",
        "Tom: Be right back.",
        "Matthew: Where are you going?",
        "Tom: To get you a phone.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elijah: Still got that temper, huh? Just like when we were kids.",
        "Ross: You try being little brother in our family, hotshot.",
        "Elijah: And that's why you've got a rap sheet a mile long?",
        "Ross: Look, Eli, this isn't some two-bit scam we're talking about, it's my kid. I told you what T\u00e9a wants me to do, right?",
        "Elijah: Yeah. Sign away your parental rights in exchange for a briefcase full of money. You did mention that.",
        "Ross: Like she just wants to wipe me off the map completely, like we never had a kid together. Like I was never a father.",
        "Elijah: Well, I'm not going to let that happen.",
        "Ross: It -- you -- it's happening. It's happening right now, this day, this second. I don't know where my kid is. I just -- if I find T\u00e9a, I swear, Eli --",
        "Elijah: Hey -- hey, you listen to me. If you ever want to see that kid again -- you want to be a father, you're going to have to finally grow up. All right? Patience, I understand, is a virtue in a parent.",
        "Ross: Look, man, I know that I wasn't the best father in the world. And it was never because I didn't care. I know I can make up for lost time if --",
        "Elijah: Ross, we're going to find your kid. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Todd is the father of your child.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. He's also the father of Blair's children. It's like she'll always have that prior claim on him.",
        "Rachel: He married you.",
        "Ross: Yeah. I forgave him for sleeping with Blair. He convinced me that would never happen again.",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: I was going to tell him that we had a child together right before we got married. I figured it would be this incredible gift I could give him, right?",
        "Rachel: What stopped you?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, God, it's so selfish. Hmm. But I figured that I would always wonder, you know?",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: I would always wonder if he was marrying me for me. I didn't want it to be about the kid. I wanted him --",
        "[T\u00e9a sighs]",
        "T\u00e9a: To be marrying me because he loved me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh -- no. No, T\u00e9a --",
        "Todd: What is it?",
        "Blair: Where is she?",
        "Todd: You dreaming? Where is who?",
        "Blair: T\u00e9a -- she was here.",
        "Todd: What are you talking about?",
        "Blair: Oh, my God.",
        "Todd: What is it?",

        "Brody: The chicken's good.",
        "Jessica: Hey, I'll make you something if you want.",
        "Brody: No, I'm fine. Besides, I have an eyeball on these Hershey bars over here.",
        "Jessica: Don't you dare. They're for Halloween for the trick-or-treaters.",
        "Brody: I know, I know.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Brody: Hey -- you didn't sleep last night, did you?",
        "Jessica: No. No, I didn't. I just kept on going over in my head the whole history, you know --",
        "Brody: You and Jared?",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I just thought that he forgave me. You know, I know it's a lot to forgive, what Tess did to him, but I thought that he understood my D.I.D., you know?",
        "Brody: But we still don't know what his involvement --",
        "Jessica: We know that he hired Wayne Landers to pretend to be my dead husband come back to life. And that doesn't sound like forgiveness to me. You know, I don't care -- I don't care what he does to me, and I understand that he wants to get back at me, but, you know, why do that to Bree? She's just a little girl that misses her dad.",
        "Brody: Look, only Jared can answer that one.",

        "Brody: Well, I haven't heard from you in over a year.",
        "Nadine: Yeah, I know.",

        "Blair: You know, Marty warned me that this might happen.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: That it would all come back to me in a rush, maybe even when I was sleeping.",
        "Todd: Well, tell me now before you forget.",
        "Blair: All right. I was -- I was here, and I remember waking up, cold. Because T\u00e9a had poured water on me. And she was furious because I had told you that she was still married to Ross. And she said --",
        "Todd: What, now? You can do it.",
        "Blair: No, I can't, Todd. It's just too awful.",
        "Todd: What's too awful?",
        "Blair: It's what she was planning to do to you.",
        "Todd: You can tell me. It's okay. Go ahead.",
        "Blair: Oh, it was -- she never loved you, Todd. It was all a scam, something that she cooked up with Ross to take you for all your money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm so insecure about Todd that I didn't tell him about our child. Huh. It kind of blows the image of a high-powered lawyer lady, doesn't it?",
        "Rachel: I'm just sorry that you had to go through it all alone.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hmm.",

        "Rachel: You were going to tell him after the wedding?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. But then Blair told Todd about Ross and everything went to hell. It really is hell, Rachel. Todd hates me.",
        "Rachel: He doesn't hate you.",
        "T\u00e9a: I humiliated him. He feels like I played him. I cannot stand to look him in the eyes. The look of disappointment is -- not the best time in the world to tell him that we have a child together.",

        "T\u00e9a: That's my point, Rachel. I have to know how Todd is going to react. He could use Daniella to get even with me. She is the one pure, beautiful thing that the two of us made. And I cannot risk breaking that little girl's spirit -- a move Todd Manning is a master at. I will not have her be a rope in a tug of war between us.",

        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. You know how I grew up. Puerto Rican super's kid in the basement of a swanky Park Avenue building, everyone looking down their noses at me. You should see this place. Rolling fields, ponds, instructors with PhD's from all over the world. They're teaching her how to ride. The only thing I knew how to ride at her age was the \"A\" train. No, no, no, no. No one's going to look down their nose at my daughter.",

        "T\u00e9a: Oh, Ross doesn't know where she is. Don't look at me like that. There's more to it. He's not all roses and rainbows. Ross went crazy when I told him I wanted a divorce last year. I'm his meal ticket. He threatened to take Daniella away from me.",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "T\u00e9a: That's the kind of man he is. No, so I -- I took her away from him. I had to. No one's taking her away from me -- not him, not anyone.",

        "David: Yeah. There, you see that? Looks like the little road racer's okay.",
        "Destiny: I guess.",

        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. She figured it out. That's what we were arguing about before she fell out the window -- which was an accident, by the way. I was trying to stop her from running straight to Todd. We struggled, and that's when she did the half gainer out the window.",
        "Rachel: I believe you. But why hasn't she said anything?",
        "T\u00e9a: There must be a God, because Blair can't remember what we were talking about before her accident. Head injury.",

        "Rachel: Are you serious?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, I'm serious. I don't want that crazy bitch to be the one to tell Todd that he and I have a child together.",
        "Rachel: Okay, help me understand how this is going to work. Blair wants Todd. You lied to Todd. Blair knows the truth. You think she's going to let a little thing like a bump on the head stop her from exposing you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: That's why T\u00e9a was on a rampage. When I told you that she was still married to Ross, it spoiled their plans.",
