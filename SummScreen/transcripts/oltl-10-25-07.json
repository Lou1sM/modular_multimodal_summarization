        "Jared: Mrs. Buchanan, really, I -- you're offering to let me stay here?",
        "Renee: Yes, that's what I said. I have plenty of room, and you've had a run of bad luck, so why shouldn't I try to help you out?",
        "Bo: Well, I'll tell you why. It's because this is crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I can't just move into your house. It's not right. You -- you have your own lives.",
        "Blair: Langston, we want this for you. I wouldn't have offered if I didn't mean it, sweetheart.",
        "Dorian: Yes, Blair would never have offered unless she was willing to back it up.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: This situation has been very unusual since the very beginning. First, you demanded that Langston should just come here and stay. And now, your niece wants custody without consulting anyone including her husband. From what I can see, in my opinion, this is an impulsive decision. The child herself said that she doesn't want to be here.",
        "Langston: \"The child\" totally wants to be here. Starr is my best friend and Dr. Lord has been incredible to me. I just -- I just don't want Mrs. Manning making some decision, because she feels sorry for me, and I hate being talked about like I'm not even in the same room. I'm not a charity case.",
        "Blair: Sweetheart, we don't feel that way about you. We don't. Look, Mrs. Woodrow, come on. Will you work with us here? I mean, what do I have to do to make this happen right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "Marcie: Ok. All right, Tommy -- I mean, Aaron, right? Who's my little Aaron? Are you?",
        "[Tommy babbles]",
        "Marcie: What? What? Guess what I have -- look what I have! Look what I have! Yes! Look, look! Aaron, Uncle Ronnie gave us this letter -- do you remember? Do you remember what he said? Huh -- yes! He said not to open it until we were how many miles -- 100? Was it 100? Was it 100? 100 miles -- no, wait. We're 400 miles away now. So is it time to open it? Huh? Let's look. Ready? One, two, three. Oh, my --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Just be cool, Manning, and keep your mouth shut.",
        "Todd: Sure. I'll let you do all the talking.",
        "John: Look, warren gave us this lead under the radar. We have to play this right.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, it's hush-hush. Bureau espionage.",
        "John: Something like that.",
        "Officer: I'm Trooper Carlisle. You asked to see me?",
        "John: Yeah, Trooper --",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm Agent Youngblood with the Bureau. Did you pull over this woman last night, along with this kid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Oh, my God. Will you look at this? Your -- your Uncle Ronnie, he can't afford this. There's a letter. \"Sis, you know I don't want you to run. But if this is what you think you need to do, then I'm going to do whatever it takes to help you. You'll need something to get you and the little guy started -- I wish it was more.\" Huh. You know something, honey? I think that's all the money he had. \"I'm your big brother and that means it's my job to take care of you, and Eric and Jerry -- they feel the same. We're with you whatever happens, so memorize this next part and then make sure you get rid of this letter.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Have you seen this woman?",
        "Trooper Carlisle: You FBI? Show me some I.D.",
        "John: Uh, you made a -- a call to Agent Warren.",
        "Trooper Carlisle: I saw the APB on the wire. I thought maybe it wasn't this woman, and -- and that kid, I -- I just don't know.",
        "Todd: Well, if it's that kid, it's that woman.",
        "John: This woman's a fugitive.",
        "Trooper Carlisle: I read the report, but the -- the woman I pulled over had dark hair.",
        "Todd: Yeah, don't they have hair dye in these parts?",
        "John: Ok, think -- think back. Are you sure it wasn't this woman, Trooper?",
        "Trooper Carlisle: Before I answer that, I'm going to need to see Agent Youngblood's I.D. Show me your badge, Agent Youngblood.",

        "[Paris, Texas]",
        "Natalie: You know, we haven't done a girls' night in months. Do they have girls' night in Paris?",
        "Viki: Look, sweetheart, I told you the other night when we were emailing, you know. I'm just not ready to leave Paris yet.",
        "Natalie: Well, I don't mean to be a nag.",
        "Viki: Honey, it's -- I'm -- I'm finding out things about myself that I never knew. I -- I don't know how to put it other than that. But that doesn't mean that I don't miss you all terribly.",
        "Natalie: Oh, you know, mom, I have a really, really great idea.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Natalie: Why don't I come -- why don't I come and visit you for the weekend? You know, you can show me your city.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Natalie: You're never going to believe who just walked in the door -- it's Dad.",
        "Viki: Oh, good. Give him my best.",
        "Jessica: Natalie won't hand over the phone.",
        "Nash: Uh -- doesn't sound like she's coming home any time soon.",
        "Clint: Oh.",
        "Natalie: Mom says hi.",
        "Clint: Ok, say \"hi\" back. Natalie?",
        "Natalie: He says hi.",
        "Clint: Natalie, I need to talk to the three of you.",
        "Natalie: Oh, Mom, Dad needs to talk to us and he's got that look on his face. It's probably B.E. stuff.",
        "Viki: Well, go -- that's fine. You go ahead and talk to him and you do -- do business, ok? I love you, darling.",
        "Natalie: I love you, too, and I'm -- I'm serious about coming to see you in Paris. I mean, I -- I never thought. I just -- well, if I can get the time off, I will. Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Renee: Bo, um -- Jared was a great fan of your father's and, quite frankly, I enjoy his company. I like him.",
        "Bo: But a total stranger -- living in this house?",
        "Renee: I've had a lot of experience reading people, Bo, and this man is good people. I don't want to hear what you're going to say -- don't waste your breath. I miss Asa, I miss him every minute of every day, but if you think that I am so grief-stricken that I can't take care of myself, you're wrong. My eyes are wide open -- always have been, always will be. The one thing that I have never been is a fool.",
        "Bo: And you're right, Renee. I just think that Mr. --",
        "Jared: Banks, sir.",
        "Bo: Ah, Mr. --",
        "Jared: Jared Banks.",
        "Bo: Mr. Banks.",
        "Jared: Yeah.",
        "Bo: I just think that your -- your timing is just a little bit convenient. See, my father -- Pa -- he's not here to be admired anymore. What do you really want?",
        "Jared: Nothing. I just stopped by to make a courtesy call, and I am as surprised as you are that Mrs. Buchanan has offered me a room. I'm touched. More than that, I am honored, but I couldn't possibly accept.",
        "Nigel: Pity. Would you like me to show you out?",
        "Renee: No, Nigel. He's not getting the bum's rush.",
        "Jared: No, I'm not offended, really.",
        "Renee: I am. I enjoy your company, and Asa would have enjoyed your company, as well.",
        "Bo: But he just turned you down. Renee, Mr. Banks has made other arrangements obviously.",
        "Renee: I heard what he said, Bo. Look, I know that you're polite. And, you know, politeness was not a trait that my husband admired, so I know that you want to stay here. Nigel, would you please prepare one of the guest rooms, the one facing the garden?",
        "Jared: I appreciate your offer, more than you know, but I couldn't possibly impose in this way.",
        "Renee: Then you should leave here and not come back.",
        "Jared: What --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What's wrong, Dad?",
        "Clint: Nothing's wrong. I just have some news.",
        "Natalie: You're kind of freaking us out, dad.",
        "Clint: Your grandfather's will is going to be read and I'd like the three of you to be here, that's all.",
        "Jessica: And Nash, too?",
        "Clint: Well, yeah. He's part of the family.",
        "Jessica: Well, yeah.",
        "Nash: Thank you. Yeah, well, we'll -- we will be there.",
        "Clint: All right. Natalie?",
        "Natalie: Of course. Why wouldn't we be?",
        "Clint: Um -- and Bree is ok to fly?",
        "Jessica: Why?",
        "Clint: Because the reading of the will is not going to be in Llanview. It's going to be at your grandfather's ranch in Texas.",

        "Gigi: You ok?",
        "Viki: I'm sorry -- what?",
        "Gigi: Your phone -- you said you only use it for emergencies.",
        "Viki: Oh -- oh, no, everything's fine.",
        "Gigi: I don't know if I believe that.",
        "Viki: What do you mean?",
        "Gigi: Well, we've been friends for going on two months now and you don't want to tell me who you were talking to.",
        "Viki: Oh. I was talking to my daughter.",
        "Gigi: You have a daughter?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: You never told me that. What else have you been keeping from me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: This is not my decision. I can take this request to my supervisor.",
        "Dorian: Then please do that.",
        "Blair: Langston wants to be here, we want her here, and you know if she goes back into the system, she won't have a say in this. Please. Hasn't Langston been through enough already?",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Miss Wilde, can you see yourself living here?",
        "Langston: But I don't know -- I need a minute. I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: Um, I'll go take care of her.",
        "Dorian: I think that my niece and I need a few minutes alone, please. Hilda? Hilda! Hilda: Yes, ma'am?",
        "Dorian: I wonder if you wouldn't make a nice bracing cup of tea for our guest -- in the kitchen.",
        "Hilda: Yes. Right this way, ma'am.",
        "Dorian: Hilda? Hilda -- please shut the doors. Thank you.",
        "Blair: Look, I am so sorry that I said no before and then suddenly said yes when the kids walked in, but you know what? I saw Langston's face when she saw Mrs. Woodrow and I -- Starr's best friend. I could not let her go live with strangers, I couldn't. I just couldn't.",
        "Dorian: Blair, I have never been prouder of you in my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Trooper Carlisle: Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Now, there's something off about you two and as soon as I take care of this, I'm going to call agent warren, find out the real story. And if you're thinking about beating it out that door, don't. This is my neck of the woods. I'll find you.",
        "Todd: What are you doing? Let's go.",
        "John: Don't you think you've done enough damage? I'll tell you what -- why don't you give me one good reason why I shouldn't tell that guy the truth, you get thrown in lockup, and I go looking for Marcie and Tommy on my own?",
        "Todd: Oh, get over yourself.",
        "John: You have any idea of how much trouble you could've gotten us into?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: \"If you're reading this letter, you're at least a few hundred miles south of me. Keep on going to Decatur, Georgia.\" Decatur, Georgia. What are we going to do in Decatur, Georgia?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I wasn't trying to keep my children a secret.",
        "Gigi: Children?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: How many do you have?",
        "Viki: I have four. I have two sons -- wonderful sons -- and I have twin girls -- well, they're women.",
        "Gigi: You raised four kids?",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: You go, girl. All I have is one and I hit the wall about 10 times a day. Of course, that one is my Shane.",
        "Viki: Hey, I was not the model of motherhood, believe me.",
        "Gigi: Hmm, I'm always telling myself just get him through high school without killing him and then everything will be all right.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but, jeez, then you'd end up dealing with the grown-up problems and that's when you \"wish\" that he was 6 years old again and he thought you hung the moon, you know?",
        "Gigi: I guess. So, where's their dad?",
        "Viki: Oh, we've been divorced for some time.",
        "Gigi: You two get along?",
        "Viki: Yeah, actually. We get along very well.",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Gigi: Wow.",
        "Viki: I mean, some days better than others, but you know, when you have children with a man, there's always a connection.",
        "Gigi: Sure.",
        "Viki: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: So what are your girls like?",
        "Viki: Oh -- even though they're twins, they're really, really different. I mean, they used to butt heads, but now they're crazy about each other and they're beautiful and really smart.",
        "Gigi: Well, why wouldn't they be all that? Look at their mom.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Why are they reading Grandpa's will in Texas?",
        "Clint: Because Asa left specific instructions. His lawyer just contacted me today.",
        "Natalie: Were there any other instructions?",
        "Clint: Yeah -- a list of people who he wants there and -- well, I know this is short notice, so if it's not a good time, I'll let Beaver know.",
        "Nash: Beaver?",
        "Clint: Beaver Calhoun is Asa's attorney.",
        "Natalie: That's Grandpa to have a lawyer named \"Beaver.\"",
        "Nash: Well, we will be there. I mean, you said that Bree was great on the plane to London --",
        "Jessica: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, we're there.",
        "Clint: Ok, that's good. Natalie?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, definitely. I mean, work could live without me for a while, I -- especially for something important.",
        "Clint: Yeah, you know, your Uncle Bo said being at the ranch was real good because he could feel Pa's presence there, and I think that would be good. How's your mother doing?",
        "Jessica: Well, she's fine, I guess. She's just hard to get a hold of these days.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, she's mom, you know -- not a big phone person. Sounds great, but --",
        "Clint: But what?",
        "Natalie: She really doesn't want to come home -- made that very clear. And she doesn't seem to want to know why it matters to me.",
        "Clint: All right, you two. I want to know.",
        "Nash: Come on, you got to tell him. It's the Jared thing.",
        "Clint: What's going on?",
        "Nash: Well, Jared is getting a little out of line. He's hard to handle, none of us know how to straighten him up -- what? Come on -- I'm right, aren't I? That's the story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I can't thank you enough for offering to let me live here. It -- it's one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me, but I don't want to cause problems with your family.",
        "Renee: Asa was my family. And he's not with me anymore. And I miss him. I don't want to sound pathetic, but I do feel very much alone, but when you're around, I feel a little less so.",
        "Jared: Why?",
        "Renee: Because, I told you -- you remind me of Asa when we met. You're -- you're like him. People either liked him or they wanted to shoot him between the eyes. And -- and he was full of drive and spirit and a \"gut\" full of ambition. And you even look a little like him -- you're a handsome, tall drink of water and if you make me feel a little closer to him when you're around, I don't see anything wrong with that. And as for you two, it's none of your damn business.",
        "Bo: And I'm sorry, Renee. This is your house and I have no right to barge in here and tell you what to do.",
        "Nigel: I guess we both should know by now that doesn't work.",
        "Bo: Hmm. But the thing is this is Pa's house -- at least it was. The thought of a total stranger moving in here --",
        "Renee: He's not a stranger to me. I feel like some fresh air. Would you, um, care to take a walk with me?",
        "Jared: I'd be delighted to, ma'am.",
        "Renee: Huh -- good.",
        "Bo: Yeah, what is going on here, Nigel?",
        "Nigel: I am not 100% certain, but if I were to hazard a guess --",
        "Bo: No, please do. I mean, that's why I asked you.",
        "Nigel: The man is, for want of a better term, a gold digger, perhaps hoping to become the new lord of the manor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: I'm sorry, that was so rude. I don't know what's wrong with me.",
        "Starr: Well, Langston, your parents are -- I know that everything really sucks for you right now.",
        "Langston: Big-time.",
        "Starr: But my mom meant what she said. Don't you -- don't you want to live with us?",
        "Langston: Yeah -- how could I not? But it's your family. I mean, it's one thing to stay over and hang out and stuff, but to move in permanently?",
        "Starr: It's better than living in a foster home.",
        "Langston: It so is. I'm just freaking out right now. I -- I woke up this morning and I was like, \"I can't do this. I can't live like this.\"",
        "Starr: Is that why you cut school and wanted to take off?",
        "Langston: Now I just feel like I'm in the way. That's why I didn't say anything about my parents. I don't want someone who isn't my mom and dad telling me what to do, and I don't want to be a bother.",
        "Starr: Ok, now you're just being a pain.",
        "Langston: Oh.",
        "[Starr chuckles]",
        "Langston: Do you really think this could work?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I do -- if you want it to. It's your decision, Langston.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: There's no reason to be proud of me. I'm doing this for Langston. It was the right thing to do.",
        "Dorian: I have no idea why Langston's making this so difficult.",
        "Blair: I don't think she's trying to make it difficult. I think she's -- I think she's terrified. I mean, I know what that's like -- I've been there.",
        "Dorian: Yeah, but if that woman senses any reticence, we're in danger of losing Langston.",
        "Blair: Well, we can't let that happen.",
        "Dorian: I do have one other concern.",
        "Blair: What's that?",
        "Dorian: Todd.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Who were you texting?",
        "John: Warren. Carlisle's in there calling him to check out Agent Youngblood. I told him to play along.",
        "Todd: Do you think he will?",
        "John: Depends on how annoyed he gets.",
        "Todd: Ah, I'm sorry. I'm just doing everything I can to find this kid.",
        "John: Yeah, you said that already. Look, just stop playing this so stupid.",
        "Todd: Well?",
        "Trooper Carlisle: Warren vouched for you, Agent Youngblood, and you, Lieutenant McBain. Sorry for the delay.",
        "John: Look, you're just doing your job, all right? But now that we're all on the same page, do you think you could look at the picture and tell us -- was this the woman you pulled over?",
        "Trooper Carlisle: Yeah, it's possible. She had dark hair, glasses.",
        "Todd: What about now?",
        "Trooper Carlisle: Could have been. I can't tell you for sure.",
        "Todd: Ah, we're wasting our time with this idiot.",
        "Trooper Carlisle: Well, if it's any help, they were headed to Florida.",
        "Todd: Florida? Where?",
        "Trooper Carlisle: I don't know. It was just a routine traffic stop.",
        "Todd: John, she's taking her precious Tommy to Florida, and then it's a hop, skip, and a jump to who knows where.",
        "Trooper Carlisle: Did you say \"Tommy\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Your mother will be back soon. I mean, she can't stay away from \"The Banner\" too long, can she?",
        "Natalie: Oh -- she'll come back for \"The Banner\"?",
        "Jessica: We're just worried about her -- you know, her health and all and she's been through so much and you guys were so great with me when I was sick.",
        "Clint: Yeah. And we all know how she feels about my relationship with Dorian.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Natalie: She was really there for me with the stuff with John. Maybe she deserves a break.",
        "Clint: You two are forces to be reckoned with, and I couldn't be prouder of you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, yay!",
        "Clint: All right, now, I am going to get on the company jet and go to Texas for the reading of the will. What about the three of you?",
        "Natalie: Absolutely.",
        "Jessica: Make that four -- Bree needs her first pony ride.",
        "Clint: Bree does need her first pony ride. Hey, Nash, it was good to see you -- don't get up. Talk to you soon. Bye.",
        "Natalie: Bye, Dad.",
        "Jessica: I'll walk you out.",
        "Clint: Ok. You take care.",
        "Jessica: Bye.",
        "Nash: Why, oh, why, oh, why don't you want Clint to know what's going on with Jared? He could squash him like a bug.",
        "Jessica: Because I don't want my dad to know that Tess caused a whole other set of problems, ok? He and my mom have been through enough.",

That's who we need to ask for, ok? \"Harvey,\" like -- like that little imaginary bunny that you like. Ok? Listen, we're going to go there and we're going to ask for Harvey and then we're going to stay with him for a little while, ok? And then we're just going to go wherever he tells us that we have to go -- because we have to keep moving. All right? And I know that it's hard -- I know how hard it is for you and me to keep moving.

        "Mrs. Woodrow: Yes, I know about that from the papers.",
        "Blair: Ok. Because we are a family and because that little baby is now a part of this family, we're going to welcome him, welcome him with open arms, with as much love as we would give our other two children. And that's exactly what we would like to do for Langston. I mean, if you would allow us to have her into our home and help her through a very difficult time in her life, it would be our privilege. She's Starr's best friend, and I know Langston. She's a very sweet, considerate young woman and that's why she was worried that it would be too much for us and a burden, but you wouldn't be too much, sweetheart. And you'd never be a burden, ok? Mrs. Woodrow, did you see this house when you walked in? I mean, it's huge. There's more than enough room. And there's certainly more than enough love. I mean -- I was -- I was raised in the foster care system because I didn't have any other options, and some of the homes weren't so bad and then some were. But that's why I don't want Langston to be in just any foster home -- I want her to be in this home. I don't want this to be a temporary landing place for her. I want this to be a real home, a place where she feels that she's welcomed and loved. And I know that we can give that the childcare system is set up for people who have no place to go -- you know that. Well, Langston -- she does have someplace to go, she has us. So, please, can you just, you know, look past your rules and -- and think with your heart? I did. My Aunt Dorian did. And Starr loves Langston just like a sister. Please? Can we do what's right here?",
