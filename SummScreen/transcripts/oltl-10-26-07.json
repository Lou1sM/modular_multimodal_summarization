        "Natalie: Oh! So I guess as a booking agent, my cousin Sarah is just a one-hit wonder.",

        "Marcie: Excuse me?",
        "Bartender: Can I help you?",
        "Marcie: Um -- can -- can I have a ginger ale, and maybe an apple juice for my son? He's a little thirsty.",

        "Bartender: Rules are rules.",
        "Man: I make the rules here. I think we can make an exception in this case. Especially if your name is Penny Shaw and you're keeping a low profile from men in black.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Trick or treat.",
        "Carlotta: Oh! How could I not have a treat for such a beautiful little clown? You look completely wonderful. Can grandma have a hug?",

        "Antonio: Well, we decided that it was a bit of a gender stereotype.",
        "Carlotta: Really? Did you use a big word like that? Wow. I -- I know that only big girls do that, so I guess my little girl's not a baby anymore.",
        "Jamie: Bree's the baby.",
        "Antonio: Uh -- why don't you go over there and get some candy, all right? Come on,. The clown outfit was -- ahem -- part of a plot.",
        "Carlotta: What kind of a plot?",
        "Antonio: Well, she asked me the other day if she could go trick-or-treating with Bree, and I didn't really know how to tell her that I wasn't sure if I could work that out. So I -- we decided to dress her up as a clown, and then I told her that -- you know, that clowns scare babies.",
        "Carlotta: You did the right thing.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I don't know. You know, she's always known Bree as -- as her sister since the day she was born.",

        "Marcie: Pleasure to meet you, Harvey. I was told that you're one of Eric Walsh's friends?",
        "Harvey: Love that kid -- and his husband, James. They gave me the 411 about your situation. Don't worry, Marcie. You and Tommy are in good hands.",
        "Bartender: Harvey? What if J.D. Delroy stops in like he does every night when he gets off duty what if he sees the kid and he closes us down before the big show?",
        "Harvey: What if you don't get miss Penny her ginger ale and I have to take you outside and have a serious discussion with you?",
        "Bartender: Fine. Don't blame me when he shuts us down.",
        "Harvey: Don't listen to a word he says. He's just got his nose of joint because his shorts are too tight.",
        "Bartender: I heard that.",
        "Harvey: Besides, Eric and James have done right by me on more than one occasion. I'd do anything for them, which means I'd do anything for you.",

        "John: Marcie and Tommy's safety comes before my sanity -- barely.",
        "Todd: Ah, yes. There it is. \"The evil Todd Manning is out looking for his son. World, beware. We are not safe.\"",
        "John: Isn't that how it always is?",
        "Todd: You know, even you can't keep an eye on me 24 hours a day, John. Let's just -- let's just imagine that teaming up with you is not really blowing my skirt up, and I decide to give you the slip.",
        "John: Not going to happen.",
        "Todd: No, but I -- I not only get away, I just leave you in the dust, and then I get a lead on Marcie. Ha, then I find her -- there she is, and I got her trapped, I got her cornered. Now, what do you suppose would be the worst thing that could happen in that scenario?",
        "John: You screw up, Marcie and Tommy end up dead.",
        "Todd: Uh-uh. Do you really think after everything that I have done to find this kid, that I would let anything untoward befall him?",
        "John: Go to sleep, Manning.",
        "Todd: What kind of father do you think I am?",
        "John: The kind that doesn't deserve a kid at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Moe: It's pronounced \"conk,\" not \"conch.\" They are \"conk fritters,\" not \"conch fritters.\" Think of me conking you over the head.",
        "Gigi: I'll do that. And you think of me picking up that frying pan and putting it where the moon don't shine, Moe!",
        "Charlie: Should I be going over there to break that up?",
        "Viki: Oh, no, no, no, they're fine, they do that all day long. So, do you know what you want yet?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I mean, well, there's so much to choose from, and half of it's in French.",
        "Viki: Well, Moe was actually a cook in the navy and he traveled around the world. That menu's a little intimidating to newcomers. I tell you what -- I'll give you a few minutes, ok?",
        "Charlie: Ok -- or you can sit and give me your opinion on what's good -- I mean, if you wouldn't mind. Viki:",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Ok, I have one question for you -- why \"Flash\"?",
        "Sarah: God, did you have to bring that up?",
        "Jared: It's -- it's cute, really. What?",
        "Sarah: I'm waiting for you to ask me if I was into comic books or if I knew my career was going to be a flash in the pan.",
        "Jared: Don't be so hard on yourself. I heard your CD. You were good.",
        "Sarah: I guess. But that part of my life is over.",
        "Jared: You moved on?",
        "Sarah: Not to bigger things -- yet -- but definitely better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: It's not.",
        "Natalie: What's not?",
        "Cristian: The casual thing -- \"Where's Sarah?\" Come on.",
        "Natalie: It was an innocent question.",
        "Cristian: You were there when she and Jared made their plan for tonight.",
        "Natalie: I didn't really think they were going to go through with it.",
        "Cristian: Why not?",
        "Natalie: Because The Palace is not cheap, he doesn't have a job, and she's been cut off from her trust fund.",
        "Cristian: I guess they worked it out.",
        "Natalie: Well, it doesn't bother me at all.",
        "Cristian: Sure.",
        "Natalie: I just feel sorry for Sarah.",
        "Cristian: Right. I know.",
        "Natalie: You know, I blew Jared off, and then he goes straight for the next Buchanan, and you could've stepped up and stopped this from happening.",
        "Cristian: I said something to her this morning. You know what? If Sarah wants to go out with the guy, no lecture from me is going to change her mind. In fact, I think she's doing it to prove something to the two of us.",
        "Natalie: Ok. That settles it, then.",
        "Cristian: Settles what?",
        "Natalie: We have to get her out of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: O.J. was the best I could do.",
        "Marcie: Thank you. I appreciate it.",
        "Harvey: You can get back to work now, Zorro.",
        "Marcie: You know, I almost didn't make it here. I got pulled over by the highway patrol.",
        "Harvey: What happened?",
        "Marcie: I -- I think he thought that I was drunk. You know, I was -- I was driving so slow because I was really, really tired. Every time I get out of the car and someone looks in my direction, I think that we're done for. Harvey, I'm not really sure how long I can keep this up for.",
        "Harvey: You made it here, didn't you? You must be doing something right.",
        "Marcie: I guess so.",
        "Harvey: Breathe a little easier now. I know you got people after you, but you got people on your side again.",
        "Marcie: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Yeah, so you finally admit it. You don't want to help find my kid, you want to keep me from finding him.",
        "John: I'm not getting into this with you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you know I'm right.",
        "John: You know, if I wanted you out of the way, I could've dumped you a hundred miles back.",
        "Todd: What was all that crap about me not deserving a kid? Yeah. Like you know what it takes to be a father.",
        "John: Yeah, well, if I'm so ignorant, why do you keep asking for my opinion?",
        "Todd: Ac, I don't really care what you think.",
        "John: Oh.",
        "Todd: I just want to make sure when we find this kidnapping bitch, that you do your job -- and make sure she hands over my son.",
        "John: You know, when we get -- we get Tommy back, you can start ruining his life right away. Until then, just shut up.",
        "Todd: I'm not the one who hurt him.",
        "John: You don't even care, do you, that Michael and Marcie are the only family he's known. It's always going to be about you, isn't it?",
        "Todd: What, you don't think I can make him happy?",
        "John: You said it, not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Talia: Look, I'm really sorry. I was working vice tonight, ok? The Lieutenant was afraid that the hookers were going to try to shake down the trick-or- treaters. And I was just really cold and I wanted a cup of coffee, and I'm sorry, I thought no one would be in here right now.",
        "Antonio: Don't worry about it, ok? We're know you're on the job. Right, Mami?",
        "Carlotta: Yeah, of course. Let's get Papi's friend a nice cup of coffee.",
        "Talia: I guess I didn't need to tell your mom to make that cup of coffee to go.",
        "Antonio: Oh, why are you so worried?",
        "Talia: Your daughter thinks I'm a clown, ok? If she starts talking about running away to join the circus, you might want to set her straight.",
        "Antonio: And you might want to try and calm down.",
        "Talia: Did you see your mom's face?",
        "Antonio: Yeah, she's -- she's a little conservative, but she does have a sense of humor.",
        "Talia: Well, I -- I know how she feels -- my Muslim ancestors are spinning in their graves. Listen -- um -- look, will you just look at me? I'm going to -- going to go.",
        "Antonio: Wait.",
        "Talia: What?",
        "Antonio: Are you ok?",
        "Talia: Yeah -- this isn't my favorite assignment, and it's been a really long day.",
        "Antonio: Talked to Shaun at all?",
        "Talia: No -- I mean, it's better that way, you know. It's like it never happened.",
        "Antonio: Yeah.",
        "Carlotta: Ok, a nice, hot cup of coffee for Papi's friend the clown. Oh, no, no, sweetheart, on the house. Thank you for protecting our children.",
        "Talia: Ok, tiny clown, have fun trick-or-treating.",
        "Jamie: You have your costume. Why can't you come with us?",
        "Talia: Um --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: How's the salad?",
        "Sarah: Awesome.",
        "Jared: I didn't think Buchanans ate anything but red meat.",
        "Sarah: How do you know so much about us?",
        "Jared: You know, I wanted to work at B.E., so I thought it'd be a good idea to know the territory.",
        "Sarah: Sorry it didn't work out. For what it's worth, Natalie really jerked you around.",
        "Jared: Huh. Well, you know, you got to be able to role with the punches and punch back harder, right in the kidneys. Sarah chuckles]",
        "Sarah: That sounds like Asa.",
        "Jared: It is -- page 112 of the unauthorized biography.",
        "Sarah: Hmm. He hated that book.",
        "Jared: He did?",
        "Sarah: He always said it didn't make him look tough enough.",
        "Jared: Oh. I wish I could've known him.",
        "Sarah: Me, too.",
        "Jared: You did -- he was your great-grandfather.",
        "Sarah: We used to be really close, and I moved away and lost touch. When I came back into town, I didn't even go to see him. I just pestered my Grandpa, Clint, to try to get my money back.",
        "Jared: One thing the biography said over and over and over was that Asa Buchanan was all about his family, no matter what.",
        "Sarah: Maybe. The thing that really gets me is now that I don't care about the money, I can't seem to get away from it.",
        "Jared: How so?",
        "Sarah: They're having a reading of his will at his ranch in Texas and the whole Buchanan clan is going.",
        "Jared: Really?",
        "Sarah: Yeah. My grandpa called me today and told me.",
        "Jared: You don't want to go?",
        "Sarah: Don't get me wrong, I really loved Asa, but I'm not one for family gatherings.",
        "Jared: Well, why do you think he's having the reading in Texas?",
        "Sarah: He liked to make people jump through hoops in order to get their hands on money. He's probably laughing his butt off in heaven right now.",
        "Jared: Oh. Maybe it's not about hoops or money. You know, maybe he's trying to send you some sort of message.",
        "Sarah: Maybe. I really don't want to talk about myself anymore.",
        "Jared: Ok.",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: What do you want to talk about, then?",
        "Sarah: The real reason you asked me on this date tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: I am not going to mess with Jared and Sarah.",
        "Natalie: No, it's not \"messing with,\" it's like taking care of our own.",
        "Cristian: She's not one of my own.",
        "Natalie: Ok, fine, I'll handle this alone.",
        "Cristian: Natalie, there's nothing to handle here, ok?",
        "Natalie: Jared is a creep and has a thing for my family. He bought out Nash and Jess' vineyard just to get back at Jess. He knows how sick that Jess was last year, and he knows that Nash and Jess have a baby to take care of, but he doesn't care about them, and I can guarantee you he does not care about Sarah. This bothers you, doesn't it?",
        "Cristian: There's nothing going on with me and Sarah.",
        "Natalie: Right. Boss/employee thing, I get it.",
        "Cristian: Well, she has a little crush on me.",
        "Natalie: And it's one-way, right?",
        "Cristian: It is.",
        "Natalie: Even if it is, do you care if Sarah gets hurt? I mean, you gave her a job, you gave her a place to live. To me, that says you do care.",
        "Cristian: All right. What do I have to do?",
        "Natalie: Take your dinner break, we'll go get a bite to eat -- at The Palace.",
        "Cristian: You want to crash their date?",
        "Natalie: No, I don't think of it as \"crashing a date,\" I think of it as a \"fact-finding mission.\" Are you in or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm not that bad a father, really. I have a couple of good kids, smart kids, loyal. And they would go to the mat for anybody they cared about. And I just don't think that -- that you can raise good kids if you're an evil bastard like everyone says I am.",
        "John: But Blair had nothing to do with that?",
        "Todd: You -- you have never lived in my house. You have never seen me make them feel better when they're feeling down or read them bedtime stories, change their diapers.",
        "John: Yeah. I wasn't there when you gave jack away to strangers, either.",
        "Todd: Ah, touch\u00e9. Yes, I screwed up.",
        "John: Yeah. You thought he wasn't yours, and that's all that matters.",
        "Todd: Well, Blair had my head so screwed up, man, oh --",
        "John: Ok, so it's -- it's Blair's fault you did what you did to Jack, and now it's Michael and Marcie's fault for what you're doing to Tommy.",
        "Todd: Actually, I blame you, because you kept the truth from me. I don't think any of this would've happened if you --",
        "John: Really?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "John: Don't forget you had a needle in your arm when I dragged Cochran in to prove that you hadn't killed her, and how do you repay me, huh? By ruining my brother's life, by ruining Tommy's life.",
        "Todd: Well, I -- I made things up with Jack, I can make them up with Tommy.",
        "John: You remember that when you're taking him away from the only mother he's ever known.",
        "Todd: Jeez -- you know he's my son. Am I supposed to just walk away?",
        "John: Why not?",
        "Todd: That's why you thought we should make the trip together right? Wear me down, make me give up my rights as a father?",
        "John: I just want you to consider a point of view other than your own.",
        "Todd: Yours.",
        "John: Well, how about Tommy's, hmm? Have you thought about what you're going to say to him when he asks you why you took him away from two people who loved him?",
        "Todd: Yes -- I'm going to tell him that I love him, too, and that -- here's a novel thought -- that I wanted to be with him because he's my son.",
        "John: Ok. You going to tell him who his mother was? Or what you tried to do to her when she found out she was pregnant?",

        "Marcie: It was beautiful. It really was. It was -- um -- it was romantic, too, and simple. Very simple, you know, it was this simple, little ceremony on the beach at cape cod and it was at sunset, and the sky was this amazingly odd color of cotton candy pink and yellow tulips.",
        "Harvey: Were you in the wedding party?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, I was. I -- I read Eric's favorite sonnet. \"Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Love --\"",
        "Marcie and Harvey: \"Is not love --\"",
        "Harvey: \"Which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove.\"",
        "Marcie: You know it.",
        "Harvey: I think old bill Shakespeare must've been thinking of Eric of James when he wrote that.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. It was a really happy day. It was, and I took a million different pictures, you know? Pictures I probably won't ever see again because me and this little guy, we kind of had to take off -- really soon, I know we did.",
        "Harvey: Don't worry about it. No picture from a camera could make me see that wedding the way you just did. Now, I am going to have to leave you for a while. The big show goes on soon and Harvey needs to get in costume. You're welcome to stay for the show, or I can run you over to my place if you want to call it a night.",
        "Marcie: Probably should go back over to your place, but quite honestly, I'm sick and tired of having no one to speak to.",
        "Harvey: You just sit tight, then. No need to get up at the crack of dawn, either. Where you're going is a long way off. You need to get rest before you get back on the road. All right, children, Alma's coming, don't be impatient!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You know, he's not your nephew anymore, John, so you're officially absolved from worrying about him.",
        "John: Let me tell you something. He's always going to get my protection whether you like it or not.",
        "Todd: I know. He's also got his father's protection and his mother's protection, and his brother's and his sister's, his Aunt Viki's.",
        "John: Michael and Marcie, they're just cut off?",
        "Todd: I'm not going to -- I'm not going to create some kind of blended family just so you feel better about the situation.",
        "John: This isn't about me.",
        "Todd: really? See, I think it is. Because I know you like to play hero for your little brother, and I know you feel like you screwed up this time.",

        "Cristian: Oh, right, and we're both so good at that.",
        "Natalie: Ok. Here. We'll flip a coin, all right? Heads, we go have dinner and we keep an eye on Sarah. Tails, she's on her own.",

        "Sarah: You did read the book, right? I'm in there.",
        "Jared: Ok, it doesn't exactly depress me that this is driving Natalie crazy. And, yes, I do plan to pick your brain about your family and the business. But that's all secondary. We are here tonight because I am insanely attracted to you.",

        "Todd: So you put managing their situation above the law?",
        "John: Yeah, for a few days.",
        "Todd: Yeah, right. If miles hadn't told Blair the truth, you'd still have your mouth shut about it.",
        "John: You know, I'm going to make sure you get your son back in a way that causes the least amount of harm to Tommy. I suggest when you get him back, you start acting like father of the year.",
