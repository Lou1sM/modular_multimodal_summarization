        "In the British boarding school, right when Danielle is talking to her mom (Tea) and knows that Ross (whom she believes is her dad) is there and her mom is preventing her from talking to him, she gets to know Matthew. They find out they have some things in common, both being \"kidnapped\" and put into the boarding school by their parents. But little do they know that he knows her mom and her involvement in his and his parents' very situation involving this. Blair wants Todd to believe that Tea and Ross wanted to scam him and take his money. But he questions that. Jessica gets a call from somebody who sounds exactly like Nash. John and Fish find out that it really does match Nash's voice. Fish knows he is not over Kyle but believes Kyle is over him. Cristian and Layla know better. Kyle knows he is not ready to marry Nick because he is not over Oliver Fish"

        "Todd: You know, like -- back and forth like a pinball from you to T\u00e9a and back.",
        "Blair: Oh, I think you're leaving out Marty there.",
        "Todd: Well, see? There you go. I mean, I get pissed off at one of you, I go back to the other. I got to stop. I'm tired. I got to slow down. I got to stop making such big moves.",

        "Kyle: I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Nick: Look, do you think that this is some sort of test to your manhood? What, you gave me your word? So regardless of your feelings, you have to get married?",
        "Kyle: No. I know this is important.",
        "Nick: Yeah, but is it important to you? That's all that really matters.",
        "Kyle: I'm going through with this.",

        "Kyle: No, I'm not --",

        "Kyle: Really?",
        "Nick: Yes. You don't have to prove anything by going along with this. And if you do this and it's not really what you want, you're just gonna end up resenting me for getting you involved at all.",
