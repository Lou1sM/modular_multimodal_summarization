        "Todd confides to Viki that he doesn't know what to do with his life now that he has it back. He says his options are limited since Victor Junior gave his assets to their Mother, Irene. Viki reminds him that Irene is now dead too. Tina enters and suggests that as Irene and Victor's first-born, everything should now come to her. Viki says she won't take sides and that they need to leave it to the lawyers and let the judge decide. Todd decides that he wants everything back, not just the money but his kids and Blair too. She reminds him that when he disappeared 8 years ago, he and Blair were already divorced. Tomas goes to visit Blair, who slams the door in his face. Eventually she opens it. He tells her that he wants to move forward with her, but he needs to know where she and Todd stand. She tells him that she and Todd share children. They kiss to seal the deal.",
        "Cutter goes to Llanfair looking for Stacy. Tina says she had been there and thought she was Gigi Morasco and lived there. Stacy goes to Gigi's gravesite and verifies Tina's claim that Gigi is dead, which makes her wonder who she is and who is in the grave. Jack sees the Gigi look alike when he visits Victor, Junior's grave. He tells her she is dead, he is sorry, and it was an accident. Then he runs home and worries Blair, who observes that he looks as if he has seen a ghost. Cutter finds Stacy and explains to her that she isn't Gigi, Gigi is dead, and she is Gigi's sister, Stacy. He tells her she looks like Gigi because she had plastic surgery so she could steal Gigi's life and more specifically, her fianc\u00e9. Stacy isn't impressed with who Cutter says she is. Rex wants to spend Halloween at Gigi's grave. Shane wants to skip Halloween because it won't be the same without Gigi. Rex suggests that Aubrey join them at the party and dress as the third musketeer in Gigi's place. The three agree. Rex and Shane decide to go to Gigi's grave together before they go to the party."

        "Cutter: I'm looking for someone.",
        "Tina: Who?",
        "Cutter: Um, uh, well, it's -- it's a girl.",
        "Tina: Does she have a name?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: [Breathing heavily] So it's true.",
        "Rex: Look, I'm fine. It's just, with Cutter and all the wedding plans, it's just -- it makes me realize how much I miss Gigi. I'm gonna visit her grave. I want to feel close to her tonight.",
        "Stacy: It's all true -- what I read on the internet, what everybody said. Gigi Morasco is dead. But how? I look just like her! I saw her picture in the paper! It's me! I'm Gigi Morasco. And I'm dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, Dad, but they made me change my statement about Scarface. But just 'cause I didn't see him shoot you doesn't mean he didn't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You took my life, Victor. I'll take yours.",
        "Viki: Todd, you all right? Where'd you go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Blair: Hold your horses!",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Trick or treat.",
        "Viki: You seem very distracted tonight. Something on your mind?",
        "Todd: Are you gonna hand out dental floss with all these jawbreakers?",
        "Viki: There's nothing wrong with an occasional overdose of sugar.",
        "Todd: Viki?",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Todd: You're the person in my life that I count on to always be the same -- to be consistent. And you're the one that whittles little wooden toys for kids at Christmas, and for Halloween, I'm expecting you to pass out little sealed bags of sliced apples.",
        "Viki: What's bothering you? You can tell me anything. I think you know that.",
        "Todd: It's very good of you to let me stay here. You know, like nothing's changed... after what I've done.",
        "Viki: Okay, what have you done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What did I do?",
        "Blair: Check your calendar. Tomorrow's Halloween.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: In my neighborhood, we celebrated beggar's night. Go around to people's houses the night before Halloween. Try to get a jump on the candy.",
        "Blair: Big candy bowl in Dorian's kitchen.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: That's not the treat I was looking for. I want your forgiveness.",
        "Blair: For what?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What I said to you before about your feelings for Todd. That's your past. If I can't get you to move beyond that, I don't deserve you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I haven't done anything. You know, except kidnap Sam in a super-hero outfit. That was a little iffy. Oh, and I did steal Dorian's gun, but, you know, I look at that like a public service, 'cause really, Dorian shouldn't be running around town with a gun. Maybe I shouldn't be running around with a gun, either, threatening people.",
        "Viki: Just Victor.",
        "Todd: Right.",
        "Viki: Okay, fine. So your behavior has been a little -- I don't know -- whatever. Frankly, given what you've been through the past eight years, I think it's a bloody miracle you're functioning at all.",
        "Todd: Depends who you ask.",
        "Viki: You didn't kill Victor. That's the bottom line. That's all that matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It should be Scarface in this grave, not you.",
        "Man: You're one of those kids. You come here on Halloween, disturb a grave --",
        "Jack: I would never do that. This is my father's grave. I was just clearing off the leaves, which is your job! Look at this place -- it's a mess!",
        "Man: I'm sorry. The wind blows the leaves.",
        "Jack: So get a rake and leave me alone.",
        "Man: A couple weeks ago, these kids scratched the death date off some poor woman's grave -- Gigi Morasco.",
        "Jack: Don't say her name. Not here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: So, this girl, she has a name. What is it?",
        "Cutter: S-s-she's got a couple. It's complicated.",
        "Tina: Oh, is it one of those hyphenated ones? 'Cause I totally understand. I mean, I've had a few names myself.",
        "Cutter: No, it's not hyphenated.",
        "Tina: Then what is it?",
        "Cutter: Well, here. Maybe -- I'll show you a picture. Maybe you've seen her.",
        "Tina: [Inhales deeply] Oh! I was afraid it was her. Yes, she was here.",
        "Cutter: She was?",
        "Tina: Yeah, you know, there's a funny thing about names. 'Cause, you know, she said her name was \"Gigi Morasco\" and that she lived here, but I know that's not true because I went and I asked my niece, and she said that Gigi Morasco was dead. So, this girl, she has to be confused, right? I mean -- I mean, wouldn't that be funny? Two Gigi Morascos in the same little town?",
        "Cutter: Oh, she's confused, all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Wake up! Wake up! This has to be some kind of dream. Ow! I'm alive. I'm alive, and I look just like her. I'm her! There's no other explanation. I just -- I just wish I could remember how I got here... and who is buried in this grave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: I can understand you wanting to go to the cemetery. It's real. After Cutter lied to you about Gigi still being alive, I would think the cemetery would be your belief, you know? At least you know it's true.",
        "Rex: Yeah. You know, it's -- it's... I can't see her or -- or touch her or hear her voice, and it's not even like that place meant anything to her. It's just where I still feel close to her.",
        "Aubrey: Well, that's good.",
        "Rex: Yeah.",
        "Aubrey: You go ahead. I'll finish up here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Dad. Are you going out?",
        "Rex: Uh, yeah. You need anything?",
        "Shane: Do I have to wear a costume to Aunt Natalie and Brody's party?",
        "Rex: You -- Mr. Comics -- don't want to wear a costume on Halloween, your favorite holiday?",
        "Shane: Do I have to or not?",
        "Rex: No. No, of course not. You want to tell me what's going on?",
        "Shane: Remember last winter when we got snowed in and watched all those old movies on TV? Well, Mom had this great idea that this Halloween we should go as the three musketeers.",
        "Rex: That's a great idea.",
        "Shane: Yeah. We even found these old hats at the flea market. But Mom's dead and we can't do it, so the truth is, I'd rather just skip the whole thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: I'm missing something. I am missing something that would make this all add up. A woman who looks just like me named Gigi Morasco is dead. Only I'm not dead, which is the only thing I know for sure. I can't remember how I ended up in the hospital or anything else, but there's got to be someone who knows me. There's got to be someone who can tell me what is going on.",
        "Jack: You!",
        "Stacy: You know me? Who am I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: So, do you know where she went?",
        "Tina: Oh, you mean the dead girl? Well, I told her to wait, okay? 'Cause, you know, this is my sister's house, and she sometimes takes in strays, so I didn't know who all was living here, so I went in the library to talk to my niece, and then she told me that Gigi Morasco is buried in St. James cemetery.",
        "Cutter: St. James cemetery. So, do you think she overheard your conversation?",
        "Tina: Maybe. I mean, she wasn't here when I got back.",
        "Cutter: She left?",
        "Tina: Yeah, which I thought wasn't very polite of her, you know? And where are you going?",
        "Cutter: I've got to run! Thank you, whoever you are! Oh, and I wasn't here.",
        "Tina: What? Oh, maybe it's me. Nah. That's not possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Hey, Shane. I heard what you were just talking about -- the three musketeers. That would have been cool. I'm sure there's some two-man team you guys could go as, though, right?",
        "Rex: Yeah, how about Butch and Sundance?",
        "Shane: I don't know.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, come on. We just have to put our heads together. I'm sure we can come up with something. Pretending actually happens to be one of my specialties.",
        "Shane: I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling it. The three musketeers is the only thing I can think of.",
        "Shane: Okay, then those guys it is. Aubrey's coming to the party. She doesn't have a costume. She can be the third one.",
        "Aubrey: I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You're free. You're free of Victor, and it's time to start rebuilding your life, and let's leave some of this for the children.",
        "Todd: You know what I'm gonna be for this Halloween? The invisible man, 'cause that's pretty much what I was for eight years, so it's not that much of a stretch. It's funny, right? Mmm. Oh, my God. Do you have, like, a peanut chew or something? That's disgusting.",
        "Viki: We don't give out peanuts anymore. Too many children have allergies.",
        "Todd: Oh, I know. Tell me about it. I come back, all of a sudden, everybody's allergic to everything. Can you explain something to me?",
        "Viki: Hm?",
        "Todd: What the hell is gluten?",
        "Viki: You're not invisible anymore. You're home. You're a very important part of this family and this community, you know? It's time to pick up the reins.",
        "Todd: Oh, great, a horse metaphor.",
        "Viki: I am serious.",
        "Todd: [Sighs] I don't know what to do. You talk about rebuilding my life -- I don't know where to start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Just give me another chance. Don't shut me out.",
        "Blair: You're the one that walked out on me, Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No.",
        "Blair: Really? I don't know what else you'd call it -- volunteering for a 20-year stretch in prison? Confessing to killing Irene Manning when you didn't? Knowing that it would take you away from me. And I begged you. I begged you to change your plea. But you didn't care about me. You didn't care about our relationship. You were gonna throw everything away just so you could alleviate your guilt. So, you know what? No, don't talk to me about giving you a second chance. You wouldn't even be here if Todd hadn't come forward.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: But he did, and now everything's changed.",
        "Blair: Not everything.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Now you're reminding me of my sister.",
        "Blair: [Scoffs] Not a way to win points with me.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Meaning you're a tough woman, you know what you deserve, and you won't settle for less. I wouldn't have it any other way. Blair, I just want a future with you, so you just got to give me a chance, please. I know I have to prove it to you. I'm asking. Give me another chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: You know me. I can see it in your face.",
        "Jack: Get away from me!",
        "Stacy: Who am I?",
        "Jack: You're -- you're dead. Okay, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. It was an accident. I didn't mean it.",
        "Stacy: Mean what?",
        "Jack: Get away from me!",
        "Stacy: Wait! Wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: It is completely up to Shane, but I think it would be a good idea. What do you say? You in?",
        "Shane: Dad, do you remember when me and Schuyler went as Batman and Robin? You weren't too happy about that.",
        "Rex: That is completely different.",
        "Aubrey: Hey, I'm gonna go get some cider. You guys want some?",
        "Rex: Sure. Aubrey is just a friend. She could never replace your mom. I just figured since she was gonna be at the party, she could fill in. That is, if you have your heart set on the three musketeers, okay? But like I said, you don't even have to dress up. This is just a family thing.",
        "Shane: You really won't care?",
        "Rex: No way. This is a party that we're throwing for your aunt Natalie and Brody. And I think your mom, who was close to both of them, would want us to have fun, you know? Celebrate. They deserve it. They're getting married.",
        "Shane: I guess you're right.",
        "Rex: Life goes on, Shane. Nobody knew that more than your mom. But that does not mean that we forget her. It does mean we can enjoy Halloween... And let go of some of the ghosts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Dad, Dad, you've got to help me! I saw her -- Gigi Morasco. She's back! I killed her, but she's back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Thank God. Do you know how long I've been looking for you -- where I've been? What the hell were you thinking? You're in no condition to be running around cemeteries, doing stupid... thanks, by the way, for using my credit card. I really appreciate that, although it was nice of you to leave it for me.",
        "Stacy: I'm sorry. But I couldn't just lie there in the hospital bed not knowing who I was. I needed to find someone who knew me who could tell me why I was in a coma, and you had taken off, so what else could I do? I needed answers.",
        "Cutter: Did you find them?",
        "Stacy: I don't know what I found. I started looking up stuff on the internet, but what I found there made no sense. Then I found this. I saw my face. I'm Gigi Morasco. I've got to be. I look just like her. So, I went back on the internet, and I found my address, and I went home, only the people at my house said that Gigi Morasco was dead, which is what it says on the internet. Why is everyone saying that? Even that boy --",
        "Cutter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What boy?",
        "Stacy: I don't know! I don't know who I am! I don't know anything. I don't know who is in this grave. Why is my name on it?!",
        "Cutter: Because it's not your name. That's the name of the woman buried here -- Gigi Morasco.",
        "Stacy: But how could that be?",
        "Cutter: Because you're not Gigi. You're her sister.",
        "Stacy: She had a twin?",
        "Cutter: No. You're her sister Stacy.",
        "Stacy: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Okay, make it quick.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I know I hurt you when I refused to change my plea, and, yes, I felt guilty. I still do. I'm the reason Todd spent eight years in that facility.",
        "Blair: Irene's the reason. You were the tool.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You're right, and I should have realized that. I ignored my own instincts, and I let a man whose family loved him spend eight years rotting in jail. They tortured him, Blair, and that tortures me.",
        "Blair: [Sighs]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You say what you want about Irene, but I'm the one who put Todd in her lap. Anyway, I have to live with that, and I just have to try to do better. But I knew there was something wrong there, and I just shut my eyes, and I can't live like that anymore, Blair. That's why I confessed.",
        "Blair: You lied.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: To save Todd. I thought I'd put him through enough.",
        "Blair: Okay, so you're a boy scout, all right? It doesn't mean that I will ever trust you again.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You're right. You deserve to come first. I want to do that for you. But how could you love me when I don't love myself? I had to see this through. And, yes, maybe I was flying blind, but everything worked out. Todd came forward, charges were dropped, now I'm free. He's free. That means a lot to me.",
        "Blair: Okay, well, if you didn't feel badly about it, we would definitely have a problem, so I understand all of that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Blair, I have not slept a night solid for eight years. I didn't want to come to you. I had too much on my conscience, and I just had to work through those feelings, and I had to find a way to trust myself.",
        "Blair: Well, how many of these little tests are you gonna give yourself that you have to pass? Because I'm really not the stay-home-and-worry kind of girl, Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: If we decide to move forward, that's it. We do it together, and we make these choices together.",
        "Blair: So no more lone wolf?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I think the question you need to be asking yourself is, \"Do you want this, or is Todd still a factor?\"",
        "Blair: Right. Okay, okay. Yeah, I knew -- I just knew it was gonna come back down to this.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, it's important.",
        "Blair: Tom\u00e1s, when I asked you to go check on him to see if Todd was safe, it didn't mean that I was still in love with him.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Okay.",
        "Blair: He's the father of my children.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, we've established that.",
        "Blair: Yes, we have. And we've also established that Irene was gonna kill all of us. It was only natural that I was worried about him. I -- it's --",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Who are you trying to convince, Blair? Me...or yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You start in close with your family. Get to know them again -- your children, your granddaughter.",
        "Todd: She's pretty cute, huh?",
        "Viki: She's wonderful.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Viki: And you're very lucky.",
        "Todd: We have Starr to thank for that. Jack won't talk to me, though. T\u00e9a won't let me anywhere near Danielle.",
        "Viki: Okay, that is going to take time, but she is your daughter.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I don't think T\u00e9a is gonna let me stop by for a play date. You know, \"Oh, hi, Danielle. Sorry about your dead dad. Nice to meet you. I'm your new dad.\"",
        "Viki: You will find a way to get close to her.",
        "Todd: Really? How? What am I gonna do, take Danielle out for ice cream? 'Cause that would be a little weird, right -- me taking Danielle out for ice cream? It doesn't matter, right? It's not like I can afford it. I'm one ice-cream cone away from living in a homeless shelter.",
        "Viki: All of that will be straightened out.",
        "Todd: How? Victor took everything from me. He took my money, my investments, my newspaper, and he gave it all to Irene.",
        "Viki: Irene is dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: So I guess everything belongs to me. For me, bedtime was tough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I don't have to convince anybody of anything.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Well, we can't move forward if you've got unfinished business.",
        "Blair: Well, I -- oh, my God, Jack, what's wrong? What's wrong? You're as white as a sheet. Are you all right?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You alone?",
        "Jack: Yeah. And I'm fine.",
        "Blair: No. No, you're not. You look like you've seen a ghost, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: No, Stacy's dead. She fell through the ice. I looked it up. She drowned in some lake or something.",
        "Cutter: That's -- that's what they thought, but, apparently, you survived.",
        "Stacy: So all that stuff you said about Stacy and Gigi being in an accident together -- that was a lie? I was in a coma from almost drowning?",
        "Cutter: No, no, no. The coma came later. You walked away from the lake. Apparently, the coma was after the accident.",
        "Stacy: But the internet didn't say anything about Stacy being in the basement. All the sites said Gigi was alone.",
        "Cutter: They got it wrong.",
        "Stacy: Not the pictures! I don't look anything like Stacy! I look exactly like Gigi.",
        "Cutter: Okay, I know that it's confusing. I'm still trying to figure it out myself. But this is the truth, and I know it's gonna sound crazy, but you, Stacy, you had yourself done over to look exactly like Gigi. It's the truth.",
        "Stacy: Done over. You mean like plastic surgery?",
        "Cutter: Whatever it took.",
        "Stacy: Why would I do that?",
        "Cutter: 'Cause you wanted her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Hey, so, I was thinking. The whole three musketeers thing? That's something you were gonna do with Gigi, and I don't want to intrude on that, so I'm gonna bow out, okay?",
        "Rex: Shane, it's up to you, buddy.",
        "Shane: I thought about it, too, and my dad's right. Nobody can ever replace Mom. And she'd want us to have fun. I mean, it's Halloween, so if you still want to go, I think we should all go together as the three musketeers.",
        "Aubrey: Um, are you both okay with it?",
        "Rex: Whatever Shane wants.",
        "Shane: There's just one thing. You're gonna have to wear a mustache.",
        "Aubrey: A mustache? No! No way!",
        "Shane: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: I'm sorry. I couldn't help but overhearing that if Victor's will holds and my mother's will holds, then everything goes to me.",
        "Todd: Talk about a hold-up.",
        "Tina: What? I'm her daughter.",
        "Todd: I'm her son.",
        "Tina: Okay, so we can go halvesies.",
        "Todd: I'm not going halvesies with you on anything.",
        "Viki: Oh, here we go.",
        "Todd: That was my money.",
        "Viki: Give it to me.",
        "Todd: Victor Lord Sr. Left it to me. It is all mine.",
        "Tina: You know, you have got to teach him to share.",
        "Viki: Not my job.",
        "Todd: Victor Lord Jr. had no right to take that money from me, much less give it to Irene!",
        "Tina: Okay, you have a point there, but since you were declared legally dead --",
        "Todd: Do I look dead?",
        "Tina: You could use a little color.",
        "Todd: I'm not dead, so all of this is -- is fruit of the poisonous tree.",
        "Viki: No, that's rules of evidence.",
        "Todd: And the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.",
        "Viki: That's genetics.",
        "Todd: Victor Lord left the money to me, and I'm still alive. Anything based on me being dead is -- is -- is -- help me out here -- null and void. Did I get that right?",
        "Viki: No, that's for a judge to decide.",
        "Tina: Yeah, and since I am every bit as much Victor's child as you are, then I have a case, right?",
        "Todd: You have a case of the stupids.",
        "Tina: He just called me stupid!",
        "Viki: Stop it! Stop it!",
        "Todd: You're stupid.",
        "Viki: We're gonna let the lawyers decide this.",
        "Todd: Really? Are you serious? Sis!",
        "Viki: What?! I'm not taking sides.",
        "Tina: No, and none of us are, all right? We are one big, happy family, and we need to stick together, right?",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Tina: Yes. Okay. Ow! So greedy.",
        "Todd: I'm not.",
        "Tina: Are too! Oh, I almost forgot. I have a wedding to plan. Greedy.",
        "Todd: This is all your fault. And let me tell",

        "Blair: Was somebody chasing you?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Blair: Well... wait a minute -- you weren't throwing eggs at Mr. Van Etten's house, were you? Because I warned you about that last year --",
        "Jack: I was nowhere near the van Ettens'!",
        "Blair: Well, then, where were you?",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter.",
        "Blair: Well, it matters to me, son. You look like you've seen a ghost, and, my God, you're sweating.",
        "Jack: I'm fine! How many times do I have to tell you? I'm going to bed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Jack: [Sighs] Get a grip. It's not possible. People do not come back from the dead. That couldn't have been Gigi. Could it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: All right. I'll think about the mustache thing, but I need you guys' help.",
        "Rex: With what?",
        "Aubrey: Well, what did they do -- the three musketeers? I mean, I know the whole sword-fighting thing. Did they say anything?",
        "Rex: \"All for one, and one for all,\" right?",
        "Shane: Yeah, I think they all pretty much said that.",
        "Aubrey: \"All for one, one for all.\" I like that.",
        "Rex: See? You can say it. You just have to know how to point your sword.",
        "Aubrey: [Laughs] All right. Like this?",
        "Rex: No, it's more like this.",
        "Aubrey: [Laughs] Like this?",
        "Rex: Mm-hmm.",
        "Aubrey: Okay. I like that. This is good. This is gonna be fun.",
        "Shane: Yeah, Mom thought so, too.",
        "Aubrey: Do you still have the hats?",
        "Shane: Yeah, I think they're up in the attic.",
        "Aubrey: All right. I'll run up and get them.",
        "Rex: You okay?",
        "Shane: Yeah. Why not? I mean, Aubrey's cool. I'd still want to do it with Mom, but...",
        "Rex: Well, listen. You remember those plastic swords that you used to have? She would mop the floor with us.",
        "Shane: Yeah, you're right. Especially you. I mean, look at you. You have no technique.",
        "Rex: Oh, yeah? En garde!",
        "Shane: En garde!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: What do you mean, I wanted Gigi's life? I was jealous?",
        "Cutter: Yeah. I mean, I think that's how it started out. She had what you wanted, so you decided to take it. That's why you got the plastic surgery -- to replace her.",
        "Stacy: God! How twisted am I?",
        "Cutter: I didn't know you back then, so I really couldn't say.",
        "Stacy: So, what's that mean?",
        "Cutter: My guess would be the coma. I really don't know that much. It's just -- you know that friend of yours, the one that took care of you?",
        "Stacy: Yeah, you said her name's Kim.",
        "Cutter: Right. Well, luckily, I guess she was there, and so she pulled you out of the basement, and that's why the cops never found you -- 'cause you were gone before they showed up, and... that's all I know. That, and you're damn lucky that you survived all that and all you lost was your memory.",
        "Stacy: Hm. Oh, serves me right for going after my sister -- if that's even true.",
        "Cutter: Look, all I know is Gigi Morasco's dead and buried, okay? They even took her heart out, gave it to somebody else, so that's her in the grave. As for that face you got, think about it, you know? You're her sister. Couldn't have taken much to make you look like her.",
        "Stacy: But why? Huh? What was -- what was so special about Gigi's life that I wanted to replace her?",
        "Cutter: Her fianc\u00e9, Rex Balsom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: [Sighs] I was gonna go to the cemetery to visit your mom. I'm not so sure you'd want to go with me, since seeing Jack there.",
        "Shane: The hell with Jack.",
        "Rex: Well, that's it. All those old movies are clearly a bad influence.",
        "Shane: Oh, yeah?",
        "Rex: Hey, do not make me use this.",
        "Shane: Come on. Let's go see Mom. We can wish her a happy Halloween. And about Jack -- you're right. It's time to move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Jack certainly knows how to make an entrance, doesn't he? I think he gets that from my aunt Dorian.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm glad he interrupted us. I shouldn't have pushed you about Todd. It's none of my business, and frankly, I don't really care.",
        "Blair: So you keep telling me.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm human, Blair. I'm sure he wants you. Who wouldn't? You're beautiful, you're smart, you're full of life. You're the woman I painted all those years ago. But you've had him.",
        "Blair: I was married to him.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I understand the pull of the familiar. I understand all that. It's like a pair of old slippers you keep under the bed.",
        "Blair: I don't have a pair of old slippers under my bed.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No, you don't, because you want something new. At least, that's what my instincts tell me.",
        "Blair: I, um... I think you should go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Could you please explain to me how this is my fault?",
        "Todd: You let that woman into your house.",
        "Viki: She's my sister. She's your sister.",
        "Todd: And you -- you gave her a second chance.",
        "Viki: How many second chances have you had -- two, four, 987?",
        "Todd: Well, for the most part, I deserved most of those.",
        "Viki: I'm not gonna debate this with you, nor am I going to get between you and the squabbles you have --",
        "Todd: You already did! You totally took her side.",
        "Viki: I did not take her side. We're all in the same family. We're all on the same side.",
        "Todd: If only the old man had seen it that way.",
        "Viki: Yes. Yes. Our father put us through hell, okay? But can we please not allow him to continue to -- don't do that! -- Not allow him to do that from the grave? It's only money.",
        "Todd: Yeah, easy for you to say.",
        "Viki: Todd, there's plenty of money to go around.",
        "Todd: Define \"plenty,\" and if it doesn't begin with, \"I get everything I want,\" I'm really not interested.",
        "Viki: But the courts might not agree with you.",
        "Todd: To hell with the courts. Leopard skin is the fabric of desperation. There is no way I'm gonna let her get her grubby little claws on my money.",
        "Viki: She only wants her fair share.",
        "Todd: No, you saw her! She -- if you weren't here, she would have taken that entire bowl of candy.",
        "Viki: What a tragedy.",
        "Todd: Well, it says who she is. She wants it all.",
        "Viki: No, she said halves. You want it all.",
        "Todd: Mm! Mm! I do want it all. You know what? I should thank Tina. She really helped me clear my thoughts. All this talk about me not knowing how to rebuild my life. I know now. I know where to start. I'm gonna start with Tina's jugular. I'm gonna play with it on -- on -- on your kitchen floor.",
        "Viki: That's attractive.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you want the old me back? I'm back. I want it all. I want my money, I want my newspaper, I want my children -- everything that I lost. Especially Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'll go, but not yet. There's something I need to know first.",
        "Blair: What's that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Okay, what's so special about Rex Balsom?",
        "Cutter: Beats me. I hardly know the guy.",
        "Stacy: Well, he was Gigi's fianc\u00e9.",
        "Cutter: Hey, look. You're shivering. All right, let's talk about this someplace warm.",
        "Stacy: No, I want to know!",
        "Cutter: And look, I'll tell you, okay? But you just walked out of a hospital. You're weak. I don't want you collapsing on me. Come on.",
        "Stacy: Wait. There's something I want to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If you were alive, you'd tell me I was being an idiot. And a chicken. So, okay, I'm back, and I'm gonna find out if that woman I saw -- if it was really Gigi Morasco... or if I was just seeing things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Someone else is here.",
        "Rex: Yeah, well, graveyards can be pretty popular on mischief night.",
        "Shane: Look -- someone put on a flower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Maybe we should have taken a left at that fork back there. Everything looks different in the dark.",
        "Stacy: You'll tell me everything, right? About me and this Rex?",
        "Cutter: Yeah, yeah, buddy, just... come on, let's go. This place creeps me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Your mom loved these.",
        "Shane: Yeah, I know. She would always stop and smell them whenever we passed the florist downtown.",
        "Rex: I can really feel her tonight.",
        "Shane: Me too.",
        "Rex: She's with us, Shane. Your mom is always watching us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Did you get your answer?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yep. Just needed to make sure there was still something there.",
        "Blair: Did your instincts tell you that?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Never hurts to check. I love you, Blair... I want you... and I'm not giving up on you.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Eight years, I never stopped thinking about her.",
        "Viki: You want Blair back?",
        "Todd: She's the mother of my children.",
        "Viki: When you disappeared eight years ago, you were divorced.",
        "Todd: Well, maybe that wasn't such a great idea.",
        "Viki: You had a lot of problems.",
        "Todd: What couple doesn't have their ups and downs? I thought about her every day when we were apart. It's a very difficult thing to miss a woman. And I was terrified that I had been forgotten.",
        "Viki: I can't speak for Blair, but, you know, things change.",
        "Todd: The minute I saw her at the movie premiere and I kissed her, and I knew right away that she remembered. She remembered. She's the one. She saved my life in the woods. She did. If it weren't for her, I would have bled to death all over your kitschy overstuffed sofa. And the whole time we're there together, there's something between us. We both felt it.",
        "Viki: I thought she was involved with Tom\u00e1s Delgado.",
        "Todd: Yeah, well... it's like you said, things change."
