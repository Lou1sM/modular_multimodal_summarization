        "Hannah takes Starr, James and baby Hope hostage at gunpoint. She leads them to a gravesite wearing a western hat, has Starr and James dressed like the grim reaper, has baby Hope dressed like a pumpkin and pulls her in a wagon. She tells them she's going to have them dig their own grave. She laughs and tells them that on Halloween, while they are dressed in costumes, nobody will suspect anything. And when they are dead nobody will look for them. She tells Starr and James that after they are dead, baby Hope will have a new mommy. Starr tells her that will never happen and is very worried and frightened when Hannah knocks James out and demands that Starr buries him in the dirt if she wants to save her baby. Meanwhile, Langston takes Robert to the hospital and finds out from his doctor that he's lying about his injury being caused by overexerting himself at the gym. He tells her that Robert has been assaulted. At that point, she calls the cops an stays with Robert, distracted from finding Starr and Hope and unaware that Hannah has not only them but James as well. Of all the people to answer her call to report the assault to the cops, Inez answers. As soon as she finds out her son has been assaulted, she rushes to the hospital. Clint acts concerned and gives her no reason to suspect him of anything and accompanies her. Robert is not about to tell anybody what happened to him or that Clint is responsible for it. But he coldly observes Clint hugging his mom outside his hospital room when she expresses her worries about both of her sons being hurt. Meanwhile, after the explosion, Cole has shot and killed Eli. And knowing he will be charged with murder and locked up for light, Marty takes the rap for it and turns herself in to the cops. Bo and Nora know there is something up with her. Inside the wreckage of the building, Todd and John are together trying to find their way out. For the first time, John confesses to Todd that Tea might very well be alive, based on what Greg told him. Blair and Tea are together in another part of the room. Right then, the 4 of them come together and Todd is stunned when he sees Tea for the first time."

        "James: Okay, you know what? I'm not wearing this.",
        "Starr: Me either.",
        "Hannah: Put your masks back on before somebody recognizes you. Come on! Where's your Halloween spirit?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: What--what happened? Where's Bo?",
        "Brody: He's still at the site. Nora. I heard Elijah Clarke detonated a bomb. What the heck?",
        "Brody: Bo's okay.",
        "Nora: Thank you. Thank God. What about the girls? Did he let the girls go-- what's going on?",
        "Brody: Clarke's dead.",
        "Marty: I shot him. Please, let me call Cole now. He thinks Starr and Hope died in that explosion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Damn you, Clarke. I'd kill you again if I could.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Ah.",
        "Langston: Hey, how you feeling?",
        "Ford: Did you get James?",
        "Langston: No. He's not picking up.",
        "Ford: Ah. Something's wrong.",
        "Langston: Hey, you're not going anywhere until they checked out your x-rays. Finally.",
        "Doctor: Sorry. Radiology was backed up.",
        "Langston: Well, did you figure out why he was coughing up blood?",
        "Doctor: He has a lot of internal injuries.",
        "Ford: I told you.",
        "Langston: Could this have happened if he was working out at the gym?",
        "Doctor: Only if he was the punching bag. Somebody gave you a serious beatdown.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Inez: Of course, Nate. You stay there with her. I will see you later. Daniella's safe.",
        "Clint: Oh, thank God for that. What about the others?",
        "Inez: Bo has a team over there looking for survivors.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Fire chief won't let us back in until there's an all clear. They have to make sure that the floor won't cave in... before we start searching.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, we got to get back in there.",
        "Bo: We're gonna send in a team just as soon as they let us.",
        "Natalie: Search and rescue, not recovery, right?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: 'Cause John isn't dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, come on. Hey, be careful. Go easy.",
        "Todd: Uh! [Panting] You go easy. Half my family could be back there.",
        "John: I know, but you have no idea where this debris is gonna fall, who it's gonna hit. One of the kids could be down here.",
        "Todd: Starr!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Wait, did you hear that?",
        "Blair: No.",
        "T\u00e9a: It was a voice.",
        "Blair: Are you sure?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yes, I'm sure! I couldn't hear what it said? Hello! Hello! Is anyone there?",
        "[Coughing]",
        "T\u00e9a: Hello!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: This doesn't mean that he's dead. You know, a building collapsed, and he could have dropped it. I mean, it's not like he would have gone back in to get it. You know, he was trying to save people, so I mean John wouldn't have thought twice if it fell out of his pocket.",
        "Bo: I know.",
        "Natalie: Or he could have dropped it on purpose, like he was trying to lead us so that we would know where to find him, like, you know, like a clue. Do you know exactly where you found it? Because I'm telling you, Uncle Bo, that's it. He's trying to send us a message.",
        "Bo: All right, no, no. Natalie, do you want to sit down?",
        "Natalie: No, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm totally fine because John is going to come out of that building any minute because he wouldn't die like this. He couldn't. There's still more people to save, right? I mean, that's what he does, right? Right? Oh, my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: My baby girl. How can you and your mommy be gone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hannah: Okay, we're here. You can take your masks off now.",
        "Starr: Where are we?",
        "Hannah: Off the beaten path, but you can still get beaten. Ha ha! Oh. Okay, start digging.",
        "James: What?",
        "Hannah: Those two shovels-- there's one for each of you. Oh, let's make it into a game. Um, whoever gets to 6 feet first, wins.",
        "Starr: 6 feet?",
        "James: No. No!",
        "Hannah: Yes. Ha. You're digging your own graves.",
        "James: We're not doing it.",
        "Hannah: Okay, it's your funeral. Ha ha! Oh, I don't remember Halloween being this fun. Ah! Ha ha! Go ahead.",
        "Starr: What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do, Hannah? Are you gonna shoot us or are you gonna bury us alive?",
        "Hannah: It depends on how the next hour goes.",
        "James: You won't do it. Hannah, you're not a killer.",
        "Hannah: Push me and find out!",
        "James: You'd kill a mother in front of her baby?",
        "Hannah: She's not gonna be a mother for long, will she? No. No, she won't. Mommy's going bye-bye.",
        "Starr: You're not gonna get away with this, Hannah!",
        "Hannah: Yes, I will. It'll just be like a game of hide and seek. Except nobody's gonna find mommy and her special friend, Uncle James because nobody will look here. Graveyards are the perfect place to hide dead people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Starr and Hope weren't in the warehouse.",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Marty: Look, Cole thinks they're dead. Please, you have to let me call him.",
        "Brody: I'll make the call for you.",
        "Marty: No, I have to do it--his mother! He's a mess right now.",
        "Brody: You only get one phone call.",
        "Marty: I know that.",
        "Brody: You need a lawyer.",
        "Marty: I don't. I don't. I don't. I shot him. I killed him.",
        "Nora: Okay, you know what? You need to stop talking.",
        "Marty: No, I don't. I've already said it. I shot him. I killed him. I wanted to kill him.",
        "Nora: Just--did he attack you?",
        "Marty: He pushed me down the stairs.",
        "Nora: No. I mean tonight. Were you defending yourself?",
        "Brody: Clarke was under arrest, in handcuffs when she shot him.",
        "Nora: No. No. No. God, Marty, what the--what--why did you do that?",
        "Marty's voice: Cole! Oh, my God. Thank God you're all right. Are you hurt? What happened here? He's dead.",
        "Cole's voice: Good. He should be.",
        "Marty: It's true. Eli killed my baby, so I killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Come here. Sit down. Do you need a doctor?",
        "Natalie: No.",
        "Bo: Medic!",
        "Natalie: No, no. No. He moved.",
        "Bo: What?",
        "Natalie: I mean, he or she. It's the first time. I mean, that's a sign, isn't it? He's trying to tell me something.",
        "Bo: Yeah, he's trying to tell you to get out of the smoke and get some rest.",
        "Natalie: Like his dad. He's in there, and he's in here. This baby wants to be born. He wants John to be his father.",
        "Bo: Well, yeah. Who else would it be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Marty, you should listen to Nora and stop talking.",
        "Marty: I don't care!",
        "Nora: You will tomorrow!",
        "Marty: Take this down, Brody. I thought Eli had killed my granddaughter and Starr on top of ending my pregnancy. I wanted him dead, so I killed him. Please let me use that phone and call my son!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Copy that. Come on, Nat. Let's get you out of here.",
        "Natalie: You know, I can help.",
        "Bo: No, you can't. Look, you're not trained in search and rescue, all right? That fire chief won't even let my guys back in the building right now. I need you with the department. I need you working that Clarke shooting, okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but that won't take long.",
        "Bo: Well, then come on. Let's get after it, then. Look, John is gonna give me hell for not getting you and his baby out of all of this smoke. Do you want to make John happy, huh?",
        "Natalie: Bo...I have to know.",
        "Bo: I know, and you will because I'm gonna come back here, and you are gonna be the first call I make after I find him. Okay?",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Bo: All right. Come on. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Did you hear a voice? A woman's voice?",
        "John: No. You think it was Starr or Blair?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "John: Hey. What exactly did you hear?",
        "Todd: I--I don't know. Some--some wind, ghost. Nothing. Forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Okay, stop it.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Muffled yell]",
        "Blair: Stop it! Yelling like that, you want to bring this place down, huh, do you? Stop.",
        "T\u00e9a: You think that's really a thing--\"my little voice\"?",
        "Blair: Your little voice is like a bullhorn!",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, it is like a bullhorn.",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "T\u00e9a: It feels good to use it, too, to yell.",
        "Blair: Yeah, why don't you just sit down and take a break, all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I think I'd better. I don't know how many times I can come back from the dead. Blair. Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, well, I don't believe in ghosts.",
        "Todd: Neither did I before T\u00e9a.",
        "John: Uh! You do now?",
        "Todd: Can we just keep digging, please?",
        "John: Hey, look, Manning, what you went through...",
        "Todd: Yeah, I thought losing T\u00e9a was the worst thing that could happen to me. Try losing your kid.",
        "John: I can't. Whoa. Do me a favor. Hold this while I try to pull this away.",
        "[John straining]",
        "Todd: Why are we even bothering? Do you really think we'll find them?",
        "John: We got a shot.",
        "Todd: I got to get Blair back to the kids, man.",
        "John: Hey, listen, she might have made it out of here already.",
        "Todd: She and Dani and the boys might be the only people in the world left to care about me... and who I care about.",
        "[John straining]",
        "Todd: What?",
        "John: I'm just digging, man.",
        "Todd: Well, you can say it. I'm getting what I deserve.",
        "John: You think that someone's dead and that's punishment for you?",
        "Todd: Seems as good a reason as any. What, you got something to say to me, go ahead and say it, John.",
        "John: You may not be as alone as you think.",
        "Todd: Is this gonna be some kind of come to Jesus pitch? Find the Lord and I never walk alone again?",
        "John: Forget it.",
        "Todd: You sure? I mean, you don't want to hold hands--",
        "John: I said forget it!",
        "Todd: Oh, I've already forgotten. [Indistinct]. God lost my number a long time ago.",
        "John: All right, there's something you should know, but you got to promise to hold it together.",
        "Todd: Like how?",
        "John: Just shut up. Listen quietly and stay cool.",
        "Todd: Know what? Forget it. I don't want to hear it.",
        "John: Yes, you do, but you got to promise.",
        "Todd: All right, spit it out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Ah, no, no, no. You sit your skinny ass down.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, I do not have a skinny ass.",
        "Blair: Well, okay, I won't argue with that, but no more talking about dying, all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, it's not an option.",
        "Blair: No, it's not. You're not gonna leave me with Todd again.",
        "T\u00e9a: Miss me?",
        "Blair: Yeah, I did, but you know what? I'm not the only one.",
        "T\u00e9a: I miss Dani so much.",
        "Blair: And she missed you, T\u00e9a, and I'll tell you what. Your little girl's not gonna have to cry herself to sleep one more night because you're gonna sit there, you're gonna get strong, and you're gonna get home to her.",
        "T\u00e9a: Can't wait for that.",

        "Hope: Mommy.",

        "Todd: How was he gonna do that?",
        "John: He blackmailed Greg Evans into giving T\u00e9a something that made her have the symptoms of a tumor. When the time came, he was supposed to finish the job. In the end, Evans couldn't do it, so he told you T\u00e9a was dead, then he secretly moved her to Cherryvale.",
        "Todd: So she's in Cherryvale now?",
        "John: No. Clarke found out about it, and he kidnapped her.",

        "Bo: She and John started putting it together. I found out after the explosion.",
        "Nora: This is unbelievable. Unbelievable. The grief everyone went through. I said nice things about her. Not even Todd deserved that. This--this Eli, he's demonic.",

        "Starr: Hannah, listen to me. Hannah, listen. If you stop now, no crime has been done, right? So you could just turn yourself in. That would be even better!",
        "Hannah: How? How?",
        "Starr: How? Uh, well, I already told you. I will say that you just found--that you found me and Hope and you wanted to hide us from Eli Clarke. I'll say you were trying to help us, okay?",

        "Starr: To get to the doctor!",
        "Hannah: Shut up! You want to make me mad? You want to hear my angry voice? Then try and play me again. Your boyfriend did a really bad thing, so he goes first. Say good-bye.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Hannah: Say good-bye, Starr. Come on.",
        "Starr: What? What do you mean, say good-bye? No, this is not good-bye, Hannah!",
        "Hannah: Yeah, maybe you'll see him on the other side. Come on. Hurry up!",
