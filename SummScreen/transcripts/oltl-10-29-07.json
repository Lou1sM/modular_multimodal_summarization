        "Jared: No. Four can play this game.",
        "Jared: Whew! Ahem. You are so sweet, I'm hungry for dessert.",
        "Renee: Ahem.",
        "Natalie: Hi, Renee.",
        "Renee: I'm glad to see you two reconnecting, and I like appetizers. But if you're going for the main course, you better get a room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Ah, that was delicious, and thank you for the tip on the motel.",
        "Viki: Oh, no problem. I'll be right back with your change.",
        "Charlie: Oh, no, no, no, no. The change is for you.",
        "Viki: Oh -- hey, that's way more than 15%.",
        "Charlie: All the rest is for the friendly conversation.",
        "Viki: Oh. Well, that's really nice. Thank you. Hmm.",
        "Gigi: That man likes you. Are you going to let him just walk out of here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Hi, Blair.",
        "Rex: You singing tonight?",
        "Blair: Why?",
        "Rex: No reason, just thought I'd ask.",
        "Adriana: Any word about Tommy?",
        "Blair: His name is not \"Tommy.\" And even if I did know something, I certainly wouldn't tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Look, man. This place where we are right now -- it's not exactly the kind of place Mommy would ordinarily take you to, right? But the thing is that these people -- they are really nice people. They are, just like Harvey, right? He's great, and he's a very good friend of Uncle Eric and Uncle James, and do you want to know what he's going to do? Do you want to know? He's going to hide us.",
        "Lee: Well, have you seen this woman?",
        "Bartender: Uh -- hard to say. After all, tonight's Halloween. No one's who they appear to be -- not even you, Colonel.",
        "Lee: Agent. Maybe we'll have a little look around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So you're positive that Warren said she's headed for Decatur?",
        "John: That's where the Feds are heading, so we're assuming.",
        "Todd: Yeah. At this rate, by the time we get there, she'll be gone.",
        "John: Who do you think you're calling?",
        "Todd: My people, see if they have a contact --",
        "John: No, you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: And just how would you suggest that I keep him here -- stun gun or restraints?",
        "Gigi: Oh, come on, Viki. You have a little experience, I'm sure. You must have a bag of tricks.",
        "Viki: \"A bag of tricks\"? Honey -- honey? I'm an adult, ok, I'm an older adult. I can't pass him a note in study hall.",
        "Gigi: Do you always wrap yourself in sisterhood when you're scared?",
        "Viki: Scared?",
        "Gigi: Scared. Look, if you at least go into the store. I'm not saying pick out curtains with the guy. I'm saying heat up his coffee, talk about the cowboys.",
        "Viki: But I don't even know this man.",
        "Gigi: And it's going to stay like that if you don't -- all right, all right, I'll back off.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Gigi: Only if you answer one question for me, though. Honestly, a simple question.",
        "Viki: Nothing is simple with you.",
        "Gigi: Did you notice his eyes?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Gigi: I said \"honest answer.\"",
        "Viki: Blue, really blue.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. So you noticed that, huh? Did you also notice that he's really good-looking, and he's the perfect age, and what else do you need to know?",
        "Viki: They could be contacts.",
        "Gigi: Oh, Viki, I -- I don't get you.",
        "Viki: Why are you pushing me to Charlie? I mean, handsome guys come in here all the time, I don't see you making any overtures.",
        "Gigi: That's because of Shane.",
        "Viki: Shane? I always assumed you had a boyfriend.",
        "Gigi: Oh, no, no, not me.",
        "Viki: Why not?",
        "Gigi: Because -- when I realized I would be raising Shane alone, I made a promise to him. I told him he'd always be first with me, and I just don't want to put him through having a new uncle every three months.",
        "Viki: Even if you could find happiness for yourself?",
        "Gigi: I -- I'm ok, I'm fine. But if Shane were all grown up, and a man like Charlie came along -- honey, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Uh, no, Cris and I -- we're -- we're not reconnecting.",
        "Renee: You could've fooled me.",
        "Cristian: No, she's right, Renee, we're just friends.",
        "Renee: Ah, \"just friends\"? Well, whatever you want to call it, please don't do it in my restaurant, ok?",
        "Natalie: They started it.",
        "Renee: Started what?",
        "Natalie: You didn't see him when you were walking in? He -- he was practically removing her tonsils with his tongue.",
        "Renee: Natalie, Jared is a gentleman. I don't think that he would act like that, especially in my restaurant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Harvey: [Feminine voice] Oh, hi there, boys! So glad y'all came in costume -- I just \"love\" a man in black. Now, tell me, are you supposed to be Mr. Jones or Mr. Smith?",
        "Lee: Ma'am --",
        "[Harvey gasps]",
        "Harvey: And polite. I just may have to keep you -- forever. Have a seat. Show's just about to start, and I can tell that you boys definitely need cocktails. Isn't that right?",
        "Man: Hi, I'm Clarence, a friend of Harvey's. But don't say anything, don't look around. Just pick up your boy and come with me.",
        "Lee: Please keep your hands off me, ma'am.",
        "Harvey: Oh, come on, baby, don't be shy. Give us a little sugar.",
        "Lee: We're federal agents.",
        "Harvey: Oh! Tie me up, tie me down!",
        "Lee: Have you seen this woman?",
        "Harvey: This your wife? Because I know I could make you forget all about her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Just because we sympathize with Michael and Marcie --",
        "Blair: \"Sympathize\"? I think it was more than that. You dug up as much nasty dirt as you could possibly find on Todd and you fed it to Michael and Marcie's attorney.",
        "Adriana: And the court still ruled in Todd's favor. Can't we get past this?",
        "Blair: She ran off with Todd's son -- he may never see him again.",
        "Adriana: That's not Rex's fault.",
        "Blair: Really? If Marcie's so-called friends had just told her that it was her responsibility to hand over the baby to the father, I think there's a pretty good chance she might not have run away. What do you think?",
        "Rex: Nobody could've predicted what she'd do.",
        "Adriana: Rex thinks of Tommy as his godson. Can't you understand that, Blair?",
        "Rex: You and Todd just expected Marcie to turn on a dime and hand over the only child she'll ever have?",
        "Blair: Marcie had her day in court, Rex, and she lost. I think there's a big possibility she knew something was going to happen -- and that was after Todd offered to share custody with her, and she turned him down flat. Now, she didn't get the decision that she wanted. She steals Todd's son and runs off with him?",
        "Adriana: I know that it is hard to not know where they are.",
        "Blair: Oh, like you really care what's hard for me and Todd. You know, Adriana, we're flesh and we're blood, and you sided with the enemy.",
        "Adriana: Blair, it is not that simple, and you know it.",
        "Blair: Really?",
        "Adriana: The McBains are good people, and their lives have been ruined -- Marcie's on the run, Michael's been arrested.",
        "Blair: He -- when was Michael arrested?",
        "Rex: This morning.",
        "Adriana: They charged him with perjury.",
        "Blair: So you're saying Michael is here in -- in Llanview?",
        "Adriana: Yeah, as far as I know. I mean, I know he made bail, but he could be anywhere. Why? What's wrong with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: May I have my phone back, please, John?",
        "John: Why, so you can blow the one lead that we got?",
        "Todd: I'm not going to blow anything.",
        "John: I told you when we nearly got locked up back there that I was calling the shots.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, and here we are, just crawling down the highway.",
        "John: We're making good time.",
        "Todd: Listen, the Feds are headed for Decatur. What's the harm in finding out if they're there yet?",
        "John: Because when your guys show up, Ramsey's going to know we have a pipeline into his organization -- Warren could lose his job.",
        "Todd: I don't give a rat's ass about Warren.",
        "John: We lose Warren, we lose our source. Hey -- you try that again, I swear I'm going to push you out of this car.",
        "Todd: Would you just give me my phone?",
        "John: You want the phone? I mean, do you really want it?",
        "Todd: Yes.",
        "John: Next time, it's going out the window -- then I shoot you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: That's the third call you've gotten in a row. Don't you wonder what's going on?",
        "Viki: No. I put my curiosity about men on the shelf.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Viki: I had a husband who died, uh, very young -- way too soon, just like yours.",
        "Gigi: Oh, Viki, I'm so sorry.",
        "Viki: Yeah. And so after that, I took my heart and I put it in bubble wrap for a while, sort of give it a rest, you know, for a lot of reasons.",
        "Gigi: There hasn't been anybody?",
        "Viki: Well, I made one sort of attempt, but that didn't end very well.",
        "Gigi: What would it take to get you back up on the horse?",
        "Viki: The right man, I guess.",
        "Gigi: Oh. And who is he?",
        "Viki: Um -- I don't know. I mean, he'd have to be somebody who had his own life, and -- and who would be perfectly comfortable with me having my own life. I'm not about to get involved with somebody who would expect me to ask permission. And it would have to be somebody who loved children and had a sense of humor. It wouldn't hurt if he had a great laugh.",
        "[Charlie laughs]",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Gigi: Ladies and gentlemen, I rest my case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'm sorry she went off on you like that.",
        "Adriana: She probably thinks I deserve it.",
        "Rex: Well, you didn't.",
        "Adriana: Her loyalty to Todd is a little hard to take.",
        "Rex: Well, it's not like their -- their marriage is for real. I still think Tommy would be better off with Michael and Marcie.",
        "Adriana: Did you know that Todd agreed to share custody?",
        "Rex: Michael said that he offered it right before the judge made his decision, so I'm sure it was probably just panic mode. Even if Marcie would've taken it, who knows how long it would've lasted -- or if it would've been good for Tommy.",
        "Adriana: Still, I can understand why Blair is so angry.",
        "Rex: Babe, what you're feeling right now, all this guilt -- you know as well as I do it's not, because we got caught between family and friends. It's because we knew Tommy was Todd's, and we didn't tell anybody.",
        "Adriana: It's not guilt, Rex. I'm scared. Michael was arrested for lying about Tommy.",
        "Rex: Yeah, on the witness stand. We didn't do that. Now, nobody except John, Michael, and Marcie knows what I know. So, when Tommy's finally home, she'll get over this.",
        "Adriana: Not unless she finds out the truth, and then she'll kill us.",
        "Rex: She'll be mad --",
        "Adriana: No. She'll kill us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Todd, I told you to call me. Yeah, and you actually could've mentioned that Michael was stuck here in Llanview. God only knows what you and John are doing to each other. Now, listen, I'm going to call you back, and, please, do not put me back to voicemail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You give it your best shot, you out-of-work flatfoot. Jeez, I thought they taught cops how to drive. [Mocking John] Yeah, this is John McBain. I'm in a high-speed pursuit down the highway.",
        "John: You're now officially annoying me.",
        "[Todd sighs]",
        "Todd: [Normal voice] Wow, some road trip this is. I'm hungry. You have no decent food, no satellite radio. You're not very good conversation -- you won't talk to me.",
        "John: Oh, I got something I want to say.",
        "Todd: Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?",
        "John: You know what your problem is? You're not bright. You know, you can't see past --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: Don't answer that.",
        "Todd: No, it's just Blair.",
        "John: Don't say anything.",
        "Blair: Todd?",
        "Todd: Yep?",
        "Blair: Why didn't you answer before?",
        "Todd: I was in the middle of something.",
        "Blair: Are you ok? I heard about Michael being arrested.",
        "Todd: Oh, yes, I know about that, too. It turns out perjury is illegal.",
        "Blair: So you're alone with John, huh? How's that going?",
        "Todd: Oh, it's peachy. You know, we're bonding -- he threatened to shoot me.",
        "Blair: Well, maybe you deserve it.",
        "Todd: Oh, no, I didn't do anything, I just --",
        "John: Hey, Blair, how you doing? You want to know what he did? I'll tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Viki, I thought you said this motel was right across the street.",
        "Viki: Yeah, it is -- oh, you can't see it from here, I'll show you where it is. Hey, Noelle. Hi, Shane.",
        "Noelle: Hi, Viki. Gigi, I went over to your place to borrow some brown sugar, so I could make my gooey butter bars, and look what I found.",
        "Gigi: Shane Morasco. Have you been fighting? When I get you home, I'm going to wear you out!",
        "Shane: It's no big deal.",
        "Gigi: It is a big deal. You tell me who gave you that eye, and I'll give them a taste of their own medicine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I can't believe that you think Jared Banks is a gentleman.",
        "Cristian: It's not going to happen again, I promise. No more tonsil hockey in the dining room.",
        "Natalie: That has to go for them, too.",
        "Renee: I'll speak to them. Hey, that looks good. It's delicious.",
        "Jared: Sarah told me the food was good here, and she was right. This is a wonderful restaurant, Mrs. Buchanan.",
        "Renee: Well, I'm glad that you're enjoying your evening, and I'm sorry if there have been any -- disturbances.",
        "Jared: Disturbances? Hmm.",
        "Renee: Um -- Natalie and Cristian thought there was something that they were concerned about with you and Sarah.",
        "Jared: They're just jealous.",
        "Renee: \"Jealous\"?",
        "Jared: Well, we got the last piece of tiramisu.",
        "Renee: Ah. Natalie seemed to think it was a little more involved than that.",
        "Jared: I can't imagine what would be bothering her.",
        "Renee: Well, Natalie sometimes makes mistakes, but she can be very charming once you get to know her.",
        "Jared: Yes, I'm sure that's true of all the Buchanans. But you, Mrs. Buchanan, you are my favorite.",
        "Renee: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Don't you hear that, Sarah. He couldn't wait to see you tonight.",
        "Sarah: That's good to know.",
        "Renee: Asa was particularly fond of Sarah.",
        "Jared: I don't doubt it.",
        "Renee: Oh, I almost forgot -- you left, and I didn't give you keys to the mansion.",
        "Jared: Ah. Well, thank you. Do I have a curfew?",
        "Renee: It's up to you. It's going to be a lot of fun having you around. Enjoy your evening.",
        "Jared: We will.",
        "Sarah: Thanks. So, we're already on to dessert, and in all this time, you didn't mention you moved into my great-grandfather's mansion.",
        "Jared: I --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: What'd he say?",
        "Renee: Not a lot. Uh -- I'd like a word with you.",
        "Natalie: Who, me?",
        "Renee: Now. I'm very fond of Jared Banks --",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know --",
        "Renee: No, no, no, let me finish. And I know that he's ambitious, but he's also very charming and very, very bright, and I think that he would be a great asset at Buchanan Enterprises. So I would like you to consider rehiring him -- if not for me, do it for Asa in his memory.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: John, I'm sure Todd was just trying to help.",
        "John: What he's trying is my patience. You tell this jackass that you married that I have as much at stake as he does? Here.",
        "Blair: Look, John, I know he's --",
        "Todd: He's what?",
        "Blair: Todd?",
        "Todd: Yes, Blair, please continue. I'd like to hear your half of the conversation.",
        "Blair: I -- I just asked him how to make it a little easier for both of you.",
        "Todd: Well, that's sweet, but I'm not here to lighten his load. He kept me from my son when I first found out -- and you helped him. You gave him a reason to lock me up. If you hadn't done that, none of this would've happened.",
        "Blair: Well, it did, and here we are, so is there any way that we can make any of this easier?",
        "Todd: Now, let me think. I don't know, I guess I could wrestle him for his gun and shoot him and then take his car.",
        "Blair: How about this -- at the next town you pass by, you and John say your goodbyes, you rent a car, and you call your own PIs, ok?",
        "Todd: And let him get to his sister-in-law before I do? No, I don't think so -- he'll let her go.",
        "John: My only concern is we all get out of this in one piece.",
        "Todd: And my concern that your sister-in-law rots in hell.",
        "John: You know, Manning, this is a pretty deserted stretch of road. I leave you out here, they'll never find you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Clarence, come on! There has to be a back door, a -- a fire escape -- something?",
        "Clarence: Child, this is the FBI -- they have agents back, front, and center. You go out of this building, and they will grab you.",
        "Marcie: No, I cannot stay here, Clarence, I can't.",
        "Clarence: Don't you worry, Harvey will never give you up.",
        "Marcie: Yeah? Well, where is he, because I don't see him out there.",
        "Harvey: [Feminine voice] Now, tell me, who is this creature? No, no, no, no, let me guess -- she's a spy!",
        "Clarence: You see that gorgeous thing out there talking to the man in black?",
        "Marcie: No way!",
        "Clarence: The boy really cleans up.",
        "Marcie: Oh, my --",
        "Clarence: Ain't he something? Shh-shh!",
        "Harvey: She's a spy, isn't she?",
        "Lee: Never mind who she is. Have you ever seen her?",
        "Harvey: Oh, forget about her, baby. I'm all the woman you'll ever need. Oh, Zorro?",
        "Bartender: Yes, ma'am, right here.",
        "Harvey: Get these boys a drink -- on me.",
        "Lee: Ma'am, we're on duty.",
        "Harvey: So why don't you go home, change into something a little more comfortable, and pick me up after the show.",
        "Lee: Do you know a man named Harvey DeWitt?",
        "Harvey: Oh, yes, honey, 'deed I do -- intimately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Noelle, could you please cover my station so Shane and I can talk?",
        "Noelle: Oh, sure, honey.",
        "Gigi: What happened?",
        "Shane: Everybody was talking about what they were going to be for Halloween.",
        "Gigi: Yeah?",
        "Shane: Tyler Wilcox -- he said --",
        "Gigi: Go on.",
        "Shane: He said I should go as -- as a little bastard. I told him to shut his mouth, but then he and his friends ganged up on me.",
        "Gigi: First of all, what he said is \"not\" what you are.",
        "Shane: He said it's because I don't have a dad.",
        "Gigi: Your daddy's dead.",
        "Shane: I said that --",
        "Gigi: And he was one of the finest men who ever drew breath. Did you -- did you tell Tyler that your daddy was a Navy Seal who could beat the daylights out of Tyler Wilcox's daddy any day of the week, and that he died before you were born, because he was on a top-secret mission for the government?",
        "Shane: I didn't have time.",
        "Gigi: He was a hero, Shane, and you are a hero's son. And if Tyler Wilcox says anything to you ever again, I will drive over to his house and grab his mama by the hair of her head, and teach her and her boy some manners.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You think he's going to be sleeping in basket?",
        "Clarence: Nothing softer than a bed of beat-up button-downs. And nothing cuter than a little boy fast asleep.",
        "Marcie: You think Harvey's going to be able to get rid of the FBI?",
        "Clarence: If anybody can drive away a man with a job, it's Harvey.",

Of course, maybe -- maybe after you take off your ur maybe all the glamour's gone. And at the same time, perhaps -- perhaps absence has made her heart grow fonder.
