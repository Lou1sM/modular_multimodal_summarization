        "John: Just a minute.",
        "John: Hey, Fish.",
        "Fish: Bad time?",
        "John: No, I'm just a little surprised to see you, that's all. Come on in.",
        "Fish: Uh, remember my laptop? The one that the mayor grabbed just as I was enhancing the image of that woman?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Fish: Well, I filed a complaint with the mayor's office, and, um, I finally got it back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John's voice: Whatever Manning's paying you, it's not worth your soul. And if you're party to keeping a woman concealed from her son who loves her, God help you. Call me back.",
        "Marty: Janet? I just came in to check on Bree.",
        "Janet: Oh, of course.",
        "Marty: Are you okay? Because you -- you've seemed kind of upset since you went out the other night to the pharmacy. Are you -- anything you want to talk about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nora: Hi.",
        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Nora: You busy?",
        "Cole: No, I'm just working on my common app for college.",
        "Nora: Okay, I'll come back later.",
        "Cole: Well, no, it's -- it's okay. I'm kind of stuck, anyway.",
        "Nora: Mm. Ah, creative writing essay.",
        "Cole: Yeah, you notice all the stuff I got accomplished, all of one word written.",
        "Nora: What's the topic?",
        "Cole: Here we go, \"in the form of a letter,\" uh, \"write about the person who has had the greatest impact on your life.\"",
        "Nora: Wow, that's tough.",
        "Cole: Yeah, especially since one of the people I'm thinking about hasn't even been born yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Langston: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hi, so is it over? Are you not going to Colombia?",
        "Langston: That's what Mr. Buchanan said today.",
        "Starr: Really?",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Starr: Oh, my God, Langston. Oh, my gosh, you're really not leaving.",
        "[Starr squeals]",
        "Langston: Wait, but you are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bodyguard: Is this woman approved?",
        "Todd: Yeah, she should be on the list, she's my sister.",
        "Bodyguard: Okay.",
        "Todd: Um, you are back from Africa.",
        "Viki: Obviously, yeah.",
        "Todd: Yes. It's good to see you.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Todd: Africa -- was it fun in Africa?",
        "Viki: I will tell you about it later. Look, I need to know where Jessica is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You two seem surprised to see me. Did you think I wasn't coming back? Did you think I'd gotten caught?",
        "Jared: It's only a matter of time, Tess.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Mom and Bo are on to you.",
        "Tess: Oh, yeah, I know. But clever me, I didn't come anywhere close to this house until I saw Viki leave. Oh, and by the way, Bo and Viki still have no idea where you two jerks are.",
        "Natalie: Okay, what did you do, come down here to gloat some more?",
        "Tess: As fun as that is, actually, no. I have something for you. And you two are going to get a kick out of this.",
        "Jared: So what's in the bag, Tess?",
        "Tess: Lunch. I'm afraid I've been neglecting you two. You must be starving. Look, I have all your favorites.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, right. I'm not going to take anything of yours. You probably poisoned it.",
        "Tess: Natalie, don't be such a cynic, God.",
        "Natalie: You're right; I should be way more trusting.",
        "Tess: Okay, okay, okay, if you're going to be such a worry-wart, I will try a little bit just for you, okay? Mm, see, there -- delicious.",
        "Jared: I guess we better take it. Never know when we're going to get another meal again.",
        "Tess: Mm, you should listen to your hunky boyfriend, Natalie. Enjoy.",
        "Natalie: What kind of games are you playing now?",
        "Tess: Games? Natalie, what kind of person do you think I am? Do you think I would let you starve to death?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Have you seen her or heard from her, Todd?",
        "Todd: Jessica? No, I don't know where she is. I have not seen her.",
        "Viki: You're lying.",
        "[Todd scoffs]",
        "Marty: Is someone bothering you?",
        "Janet: Oh, no, no, I'm fine.",
        "Marty: If you don't mind me asking, who was on the phone?",
        "Janet: Oh, it was just a telemarketer. It's a good thing it didn't wake up the baby.",
        "Marty: I know, she's sleeping. Beautiful, sweet girl. You have to tell me, is it too much for you taking care of the baby and me?",
        "Janet: Oh, Marty, no, no. You're no trouble at all anymore and neither is the baby. I just -- I just didn't get a good night's sleep, that's all.",
        "Marty: If you're sure.",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Marty: I can't quite stay away from this room now that there's a baby in it.",
        "[Janet chuckles]",
        "Marty: Yeah, it's just when I'm holding her, there's something about the way she feels in my arms and plays with my hair. Oh, and that baby smell --",
        "Janet: Marty, maybe I should be asking you if you're all right.",
        "Marty: There's just something so familiar about it. Can I tell you something a little odd? When -- when I was looking at Bree earlier, I was seeing -- I don't know, maybe remembering a little boy. He was a toddler just about her age.",
        "Janet: You remember yourself with a little boy?",
        "Marty: Yes, and it's always the same little boy, like a child I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Let me see.",
        "Fish: Okay, wait, wait. I should've been more specific.",
        "John: What does that mean, \"more specific\"?",
        "Fish: Okay, that's my laptop, but the hard drive's been ripped out of it.",
        "John: Then what the hell did you bring it here for?",
        "Fish: I just thought that --",
        "John: Why are you thinking, Fish? I mean, I don't really care what you think, all right? I've already got a pile of nothing, all right? I've got a corrupt a mayor. I've got useless judges. I've got witnesses that won't talk or may not be alive.",
        "Fish: But if you're still looking for the identity of that woman --",
        "John: She's not \"that woman\" anymore. She's got a face and she has a name.",
        "Fish: Wait, are you saying you know who that woman is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So this little boy is -- is part of a memory?",
        "Marty: A fragmented one. But Todd says it's -- I'm sure I had friends that had children, and I must have just gotten close to one of them. I mean, it's probably no more than that.",
        "Janet: Marty, what if it isn't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Whoa, Langston, calm down. I'm just packing a bag for the hospital.",
        "Langston: Oh.",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Langston: No, I was afraid that you were going away to have the baby or something.",
        "Starr: No, I'm staying right here with my mom and Marcie and you and everyone else.",
        "Langston: Jeez, that's -- that's good. Whoa.",
        "Starr: Okay, so, tell me how -- how are you so sure that you're not going to Colombia?",
        "Langston: Well, I just found out that my uncle's out of the woods -- physically, anyway.",
        "Starr: Is that good news?",
        "Langston: Well, he's being extradited to Colombia to serve out the rest of his sentence.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: Yeah, it turns out that he'd escaped and that's how he came to Llanview. He was convicted of murdering his wife, and his daughter testified against him.",
        "Starr: And they wanted you to leave the country with that guy?",
        "Langston: Yeah, I know, it's a big mess, but, you know, at least it's not my mess anymore. And Clint Buchanan's actually helping to make sure everything goes okay for me now, so --",
        "Starr: That's good. Well, how's Vanessa and your cousin?",
        "Langston: Lola's staying with Cristian Vega, and Vanessa might be getting out on bail tomorrow. So, I don't know what's going to happen with them. But, you know, I don't want to talk about all that right now. I want to help you get ready. I mean, you have a lot of stuff to do now. What does this book say? Look, I opened right to the chapter on what you need to bring to the hospital.",
        "Starr: What is that, a list? Jeez, it's like three pages long. I'm gonna need, like, a trunk.",
        "Langston: I know.",
        "Starr: Start reading.",
        "Langston: Okay, okay, all right, um, \"a watch with a second hand to time contractions. Okay, um, \"warm socks\"? What do warm socks have to do with having a baby?",
        "Starr: Beats me.",
        "Langston: Weird. Um, okay, let's see what else. All right, um, \"newborn clothes and blankets to bring the baby home in.\" You know, who needs this list anyway?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I definitely don't need to read that section.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: You're thinking about the baby?",
        "Cole: He or she will be born any time, now.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I heard. Listen, Cole, I came here because I want to apologize to you. I've been so busy and preoccupied, but the problem is solved now. Buchanan Enterprises is back in the hands of the Buchanan family.",
        "Cole: Really?",
        "Nora: Yes, so, I'm -- I'm here now, 100% focused on you, and I'm at your disposal.",
        "Cole: Thanks.",
        "Nora: Okay.",
        "Cole: You know, if I didn't have you --",
        "Nora: Oh.",
        "Cole: It makes a big difference.",
        "Nora: Oh, gosh, it's hard to believe it's been almost a year, huh?",
        "Cole: Yeah, it doesn't feel that long.",
        "Nora: I don't know about you, but anniversaries always stir up feelings, you know? Some good, some bad.",
        "Cole: Yeah, same here. But it's like my feelings for my mom and my baby, they get all mixed up together.",
        "Nora: What do you mean?",
        "Cole: Well, I mean, part of the reason why I wanted to hold on to the baby so much was because I didn't want to let go of my mom.",
        "Nora: Because you thought your mom would live on in the baby?",
        "Cole: Yeah, but it doesn't work. The baby might have her smile or her eyes, but I can't bring my mom back to life no matter what I do. And whether I raise the baby myself or someone else does it, my mom is still going to be gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I don't understand what you mean.",
        "Janet: Marty, what if this memory of this child, this little boy, was an important piece in the story of your life? Maybe this is the start of something.",
        "Marty: I know, I thought about that, too, but now part of me is afraid to remember more.",
        "Janet: Well, why is that?",
        "Marty: The way I see it, I can either drive myself crazy trying to remember my past, or I can calm down and be grateful for my recovery and look forward to, you know, a future with Todd and this baby and starting a new life.",
        "Janet: Then you're happy now?",
        "Marty: I'm happy when I think about being with Todd and the baby. And according to him, I wasn't happy in the past. I fell in love with a man who wasn't good for me. I mean, John was using me. He was hurting me. Why should I try to remember that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I think I know who the woman is.",
        "Fish: You're kidding me. What's her name?",
        "John: No way, Fish, I'm not getting anyone else involved in this.",
        "Fish: Oh, come on, McBain. If the mayor hadn't grabbed my computer, I'd have seen her face right along with you.",
        "John: It's gotten complicated. I need to be sure I'm right before I get anyone else's hopes up.",
        "Fish: What hopes? What are you talking about?",
        "John: Look, if I can prove that Manning has got her up at the house, I'd have grounds to search again.",
        "Fish: What have you got?",
        "John: Not enough to get a warrant. You know, Fish, what I need is I need a witness. I need someone who can testify they actually saw this person in the house.",
        "Fish: Any possibilities?",
        "John: Right now I'm counting on the conscience of a woman that works for Todd Manning, which pretty much means she doesn't have one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So you truly have what you want?",
        "Marty: Well, not yet. But I'm looking forward to getting away with Todd so we don't have to keep looking over our shoulders and worrying that John McBain and what he's going to do if he finds that I'm still alive. But the main thing is that I'll be with Todd. And yes, he is what I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I'm telling you, Viki, I have not seen Jessica.",
        "Viki: Uh-huh. Okay, let's back up here. Apparently, John McBain was here and he did see her here with you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that was weeks ago. You were talking about a couple of days.",
        "Viki: Yeah, and he also felt that she was trying to help you deflect some sort of search warrant.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: He feels that I'm responsible for the climate change and the high price of crude oil, I'm sure.",
        "Viki: So he has no reason to be suspicious of you?",
        "Todd: No, no, he just has it in for me. He always has.",
        "Viki: Uh-huh, so why the search warrant? What was he looking for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: How is your ankle, sis?",
        "Natalie: Better.",
        "Tess: Excellent, that's great because I want you two to be completely comfortable while you enjoy this meal. Oh, by the way, Jared, that's beluga, not osetra, okay? I spent a little bit of extra cash because I know how much you guys enjoy it.",
        "Jared: Why are you doing this, Tess? Why are you serving us up this meal?",
        "Tess: Would you rather I had brought you burgers and fries? Peanut butter sandwiches? No, no, that wouldn't do, not for your last supper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: The search warrant was just McBain's way of jerking me around. He made such a scene that Jessica got all upset and she thought she was having contractions.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but she was fine just a little while later. See, he thinks she was deliberately trying to cause a distraction.",
        "Todd: Now, why would she do that?",
        "Viki: You tell me.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: Look, I mean, I know she has a nice soft spot for me and I for her, of course, but I don't think she'd try to fool the cops for me for any reason.",
        "Viki: No, I agree with you. Jessica would not do that, but Tess would in a heartbeat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fish: Well, what else do you have to go on?",
        "John: I've already told you too much. It's not even an official case.",
        "Fish: Yeah, it wasn't official when I ran the enhancement program either, but that was the most interesting work I've done since I was transferred to Cherryvale.",
        "John: Fish, I'm not bringing you in on this, okay?",
        "Fish: I've got skills that you can use, John. Computers can take you places that humans can't.",
        "John: You're just not going away, are you? All right, a couple of rules, here. I'm not giving up the woman's I.D. Clear on that? Don't ask any questions I can't answer, all right? Don't do that again.",
        "Fish: It was the last time.",
        "John: All right, I have something to show you. Several people have been in contact with the woman up at Manning's house. Aside from Janet Ketring, and so far she's not talking, none of them has been available for comment, all right? Obviously, Ramsey's dead, but there's this guy, Keyshawn Riddick. He was Manning's bodyguard, all right? I believed he helped transport the woman from Lee Ramsey's to Manning's in the first place. He went AWOL right after I searched Manning's place.",
        "Fish: Coincidence?",
        "John: No, no, I think, uh, Manning didn't want him talking. He shipped him off somewhere.",
        "Fish: You think he's dead?",
        "John: It's possible.",
        "Fish: And this woman, you think Manning has her, what, chained to a radiator or something?",
        "John: I wouldn't put anything past him, but I think it's more complicated than that.",
        "Fish: But you're assuming this woman's there against her will.",
        "John: I don't think this woman would stay with Todd Manning. The woman I know wouldn't let her son think she was dead.",
        "Fish: Okay, not that I'm asking questions here or anything, but people think she's dead and you know this woman?",
        "John: I had a relationship with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Moving away with Todd is not just about getting away from John McBain, it's about starting a new life.",
        "Janet: Oh, Marty, I understand that more than you know.",
        "Marty: You know, you never talk about yourself.",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Marty: Were you always a nurse?",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Marty: Oh. A family, any children?",
        "Janet: Well, I have a daughter.",
        "Marty: Really? Does she live near here?",
        "Janet: Well, I don't see her for reasons that I can't go into right now. I had to leave that part of my life behind and go on without my daughter.",
        "Marty: It must have been a pretty tough situation for you to leave your child behind. I can't imagine.",
        "Janet: Oh, a lot of people wouldn't understand what I did, but I feel my daughter was better off this way. I, uh, I couldn't be the mother she deserved.",
        "Marty: Well, sometimes you have to think about the greater good.",
        "Janet: Hmm, sometimes it's hard to know what that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I lost the person that I talked to, that I laughed with, the person who took care of me, the person who was my mom. And now she's just gone, and I --",
        "Nora: I know. I miss her, too.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, uh, you two were, like, uh, friends forever, right?",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: Well, we weren't friends forever in the very beginning, that's for sure. We were on opposite sides of probably the biggest battle of her life.",
        "Cole: Ah, that's right. You were the, uh, the hotshot lawyer they hired to defend Todd after he raped her.",
        "Nora: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Yeah, my mom told me that when you realized that he was guilty, you threw the case.",
        "Nora: Yeah, it almost got me disbarred in the process, but -- no, your mom and I then went on to become very good friends. I was so happy when she fell in love, learned a profession. Then she wrote me about you and I was just over the moon.",
        "[Nora chuckles]",
        "Nora: And so was she.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I can picture that.",
        "Nora: I learned a valuable lesson. You can be on opposite sides of a fence, but don't be afraid to have the courage to knock it down.",
        "Cole: You know, I think that's what's happening with me and Starr.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I try not to think about that moment the baby will be taken away from me.",
        "Langston: Starr, I'm sorry. I should have, you know, read that to myself before I just blurted it out.",
        "Starr: No, it's okay. Langston, it's not -- it is going to happen. I made it happen. It just -- it didn't seem so real before.",
        "Langston: You're so brave, Starr.",
        "Starr: I don't feel brave right now, but I'm -- I'm going to get through it because at the end, the baby will be placed in Marcie's hands and I know that -- that's a good thing. It is. Oh, jeez, Langston, we've had our share of messes this year, haven't we?",
        "Langston: That, we have. But we've had good times, too, you know, I think.",
        "Starr: And you'll be here no matter what else happens, right?",
        "Langston: Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You think Jessica is Tess?",
        "Viki: Yeah, I do.",
        "Todd: But, uh, wasn't Jessica integrated?",
        "Viki: Well, we thought she was, yeah. But I think the shock of Nash's death may very well have been enough to bring Tess back.",
        "Todd: Oh, my God.",
        "Viki: And, yes, while I agree with you, uh, Jessica would not have tried to help you get out of what trouble you may or may not be in with the police, I think that Tess would, okay?",
        "Todd: Right.",
        "Viki: And knowing Tess, I don't think she would do it out of the goodness of her heart.",
        "Todd: Well, what are you trying to suggest, Viki? Are you suggesting that -- that I knew she was Tess and have known since McBain was here?",
        "Viki: Have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Our last supper? What is this, another death threat?",
        "Tess: No, no, just a heads up, which is more than Nash got before he died.",
        "Natalie: You know what? I've had enough!",
        "Tess: No, no, I don't think you've had nearly enough, sweetheart.",
        "Natalie: You are a hateful bitch!",
        "Jared: Natalie, don't. There's no use talking to her.",
        "Natalie: No, if I'm going down, I am not going down quietly!",
        "Tess: No, no, I don't suppose you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Look, I don't know why you would cover for Tess. But look, if you are covering for her, if you know anything at all, you have to tell me. This is incredibly serious.",
        "Todd: Oh, yeah, I get that.",
        "Viki: Yeah, Natalie and Jared are both missing. Jessica blamed them for Nash's death. I'm sure that Tess does, too. Knowing that, I mean, there's no telling what she would do to them or what she may have already done to them.",
        "Todd: Do you think I would cover for Tess for no reason?",
        "Viki: No, no, I don't. And that's why I'm racking my brain trying to think of the reason.",
        "Todd: I'm not playing games, here.",
        "Tess: Well, you're going to have to, otherwise, I'll blow the whistle on your little living arrangement with Marty.",
        "Todd: Listen, uh, Viki, I need to --",
        "Viki: What is this doing here? I gave this to Bree.",
        "Todd: Yeah, that's Bree's. Bree was with Jessica when McBain showed up.",
        "Viki: Oh, oh, but that was weeks ago, right? Yeah.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Viki: I gave this to Bree two days ago when I got back from Africa, so Jessica was here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Marty, maybe you're luckier than I am. You don't have any baggage to carry around. You don't have any ghosts following you.",
        "Marty: I'm lucky to be alive, that's for sure.",
        "Janet: Oh, yeah.",
        "Marty: And to be getting a second chance, I know that. And so is Todd. I mean, I don't really know his whole story, but there's something so sad in his eyes, and I think it's more than just what the divorce caused.",
        "Janet: So maybe you'll get him to tell you about it sometime.",
        "Marty: Maybe. I don't know, sometimes I feel that fate put me in his hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Fish: So you and this woman you think is at Manning's had a thing?",
        "John: Go ahead and say it.",
        "Fish: Say what?",
        "John: That I'm inventing this because I want her to be alive, that I'm chasing after something for all the wrong reasons based on entirely circumstantial evidence.",
        "Fish: Is that what you think?",
        "John: No. I know I'm right. It's irrational, but I feel it in my gut.",
        "Fish: Hey, Pi is irrational, too, but it's also the basis of every single mathematical formula. So where do we start?",
        "John: We? Where do you get this \"we\" stuff?",
        "Fish: Uh, yeah.",
        "John: No, Fish, I'm already on the mayor's hit list. You do this, and you will be, too. I mean, he gets done with you, you won't even have that dumb job in Cherryvale.",
        "Fish: Okay.",
        "John: All right. This has to stay between us, all right? This gets out and we're wrong, we could be hurting a whole lot of people.",
        "Fish: Got it. What do you need me to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I asked you a question.",
        "Todd: Jessica spent the night with Bree.",
        "Viki: When?",
        "Todd: She left today.",
        "Viki: Why didn't you tell me that?",
        "Todd: Well, I was about to tell you.",
        "Viki: Oh, give me a break, Todd.",
        "Todd: She told me she didn't want anyone to know that she was here.",
        "Viki: Why?",
        "Todd: Uh, she said that she was -- had to get out of Llanfair. It was driving her crazy, and she needed some time to think.",
        "Viki: Was she Jessica or was she acting like Tess?",
        "Todd: She seemed fine to me, both of them did.",
        "Viki: And where is she now?",
        "Todd: I don't know.",
        "Viki: Okay, okay. Do me a favor. Just tell me what you do know, okay? And don't leave anything out this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: You know, Natalie, if you have something to say, you better make it quick.",
        "Natalie: Oh, I have plenty to say, and you are going to listen.",
        "Tess: Ooh, I'm quaking in my boots.",
        "Natalie: I've already told you that what happened to Nash was an accident.",
        "Tess: No, I'd have to say it was murder.",
        "Natalie: No, it wasn't murder, Tess. And everyone seems to get that but you. You only think that it was murder because you just -- you don't understand that loved ones are lost, and we all have to pick up and deal with our grief and learn how to survive. That's just the way life is.",
        "Tess: Wow, God. Move over Jean Paul Sartre.",
        "Natalie: And you don't know what life is because you don't have one. I mean, really you're just a -- well, you're a pathetic, vengeful, psychotic nobody.",
        "Tess: Oh, okay. Now I'm insulted.",
        "Natalie: And that baby you're carrying? It's not yours. Well, and neither is Bree, really. Neither was Nash because really, Nash was Jessica's husband --",
        "Tess: Natalie \u0096",
        "Natalie: And the father of Jessica's children.",
        "Tess: Shut up, Natalie. Stop talking!",
        "Natalie: And the real person is Jessica, and you took her away from us. So Jared and I, we're not the murderers. You are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You know, I'll watch Bree if you want to go read or rest.",
        "Janet: Oh, no. No, I couldn't.",
        "Marty: Well, I'd like it. I actually do just enjoy watching her sleep.",
        "Janet: Marty, you're really happy now?",
        "Marty: Oh, don't worry about me. I mean, you've done a wonderful job. I'm almost recovered, and, yes, I'm finally happy.",
        "Janet: I'm glad.",
        "Janet: She's happy, and cops lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: I'm so glad to hear that you and Starr are getting your friendship back again.",
        "Cole: Yeah, well it's better this way.",
        "Nora: Well, to be able to understand someone else's choices even though they're completely different from your own, and have compassion for someone who hurt you? You really are your mother's son.",
        "Cole: Well, I wish I could be more like her. I mean, she was so strong. She was like -- I don't know, she was one of those people who everyone loved. Well, everyone but Todd and Blair.",
        "Nora: Oh, she was a remarkable woman. And you brought her much happiness.",
        "Cole: And a lot of grief, too.",
        "Nora: Oh, well, there were some problems after your father died, but who wouldn't have had them?",
        "Cole: She shouldn't have had to worry about me as much as she did. She should have been happier. It just really gets to me, you know? Like, why did she have to die just when it actually looked like she actually had a chance to be happy again with John?",
        "Nora: I don't know, honey.",
        "Cole: I used to bug her all the time about going out and meeting guys.",
        "Nora: Oh, Cole.",
        "Cole: I know. But she told me she could never find what she had with my dad, but then she met John. And every time I saw her face when she looked at him or she talked about him, I think she realized she found that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: This woman, she had been in a bad accident and Ramsey found her. But, you know, that was almost a year ago, so with medical treatment and rehab \u0096",
        "Fish: She could be pretty well recovered by now.",
        "John: Exactly. So why would she stay with Manning if she didn't have to?",
        "Fish: And why would Manning be doing all of this for her? I mean, what's in it for him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It's so weird. My dad just isn't even a part of my life any more.",
        "Langston: You were so close to him.",
        "Starr: He says it's because we're so much alike. God forbid.",
        "Langston: Do you think that it's off that he's respecting the restraining order? I mean, that's so not like him.",
        "Starr: Oh, no, he didn't. He, like, snuck in my window.",
        "Langston: What?",
        "Starr: Just to tell me that he loved me.",
        "Langston: When did that happen?",
        "Starr: It was a while back. I really haven't seen him lately. Except for when he walked in on my childbirth class and decided to tell me in front of the whole room of people that he accepted my decision about the baby. Okay, Langston, I know you hate him and with good reason.",
        "Langston: I don't hate him --",
        "Starr: But there is --",
        "Langston: Exactly.",
        "Starr: There is another side to him, Langston, I promise you.",
        "Langston: I believe you.",
        "Starr: It's just that my mom says that he's therapy-proof. I just wish that there was someone out there that could help him be the man that he's capable of being.",

        "Marty: Hey, it's all right. It's all right, sweetie. I know. I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I wish I could tell you more, but --",
        "Viki: Well, could I please see the room where she stayed?",
        "Todd: Well, there's nothing to see, she left. She didn't leave anything behind.",
        "Viki: You know what? You're still lying.",
        "Todd: Come on, Viki --",
        "Viki: Oh, no, you come on. Damn it, Todd. You know, lying is like second nature to you. You lied about having D.I.D. I mean, come on. You continually deceive not just me, everyone in your whole family, everyone you've ever been involved with.",
        "Todd: I'm different now. And I -- I'm trying. I'm sorry for what you're going through, really, but --",
        "Viki: You don't get it, do you? I am really beside myself with worry over Natalie and Jessica.",
        "Todd: No, I get that.",
        "[Viki exhales]",
        "Viki: May I have a glass of water, please?",

        "Jared: Natalie's right, you know. You murdered Jessica, and all you are is angry. You can't take responsibility for your own actions.",
        "Tess: This is priceless, I swear. Are you two lecturing me?",
        "Jared: Yes, I lied, but so did you. And it cost me two years of my life, remember?",
        "Tess: You're still alive, aren't you?",
        "Jared: Oh, I wish so much that Nash were alive, but the fact is he died while I was trying to help him.",
        "Tess: Don't. Don't make me laugh, Jared.",
        "Jared: I was trying to make up for what I'd cost him.",
        "Tess: But you didn't, did you? No, he fell through the skylight and he died. And I will never see him again, and it's because of you, you murdering bastard.",
        "Natalie: You know what? You're a psychotic, sadistic bitch!",
        "Tess: Okay, are we done? Are we done with insults and the sob stories? Are you done blasting me? Good. Now it's my turn to do the blasting.",

        "Langston: Do you think your dad would ever go see a shrink?",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? He thinks he's the poster child for sanity. It's the rest of us that are all crazy, see.",
        "Langston: I'm -- I'm sorry you have to deal with all that on top of this.",

        "Cole: Yeah, she's the reason why I'm working my ass off. Sorry.",

        "Cole: I'm trying really hard in school this year, you know. And she's -- she's how I'm able to get through all the stuff that's going on with Starr right now. I feel like she's here helping me work through all this rotten college application stuff.",

        "Fish: Yeah, but you said you can't find him, right?",
        "John: Nope, even my contacts in the bureau couldn't track him down. So I was thinking, a smart techno guy like yourself might be able to find someone no one else can.",
