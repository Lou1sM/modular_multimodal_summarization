        "Matthew is getting to know T\u00e9a's (and Todd's) daughter, Dani while at the boarding school. She \"suggests\" that maybe he calls her excellent lawyer mom to help him with the fact that his parents have violated a court order. Yet she has no clue that he's already been her mom's client nor does he know that she is Tea's daughter. Dorian still wants to pull of the scam wedding to Amelia. But not many people want to help her. And Destiny persuades David to go with her to London to find Matthew instead of staying in Llanview to help Dorian. There's a Halloween party and costume contest where Shane, Gigi and Schuyler compete with Todd, Blair and Jack for the best costume."

        "Ross: Has your P.I. got back to you?",
        "Elijah: Nice to see you, too.",
        "Ross: Look. You told me he was working on getting T\u00e9a's cell phone records.",
        "Elijah: Yeah. It's a little more complicated than that.",
        "Ross: No, no. Just tell me, has he found my daughter? Where's Dani?",

        "Tom: Hey, why didn't you knock? What if I was naked?",
        "Dani: I'd have pointed and laughed.",
        "Tom: Ah, very funny. Well, I don't have your C.A.R.E. package, so --",
        "Dani: I didn't say you did.",
        "Tom: So, what the hell you want?",

        "Destiny: We have to save Matthew.",

        "Destiny: Lots of people telecommute.",
        "David: Yeah? Well, their clients aren't closeted straight women.",
        "Destiny: So?",
        "David: So, as much as I wish Dorian wasn't marrying someone she doesn't love, if anyone else finds that out, it will be an election catastrophe. I am needed here.",
        "Destiny: You're needed in London. Matthew is being held prisoner there.",
        "David: Held prisoner? Ha ha ha! Little girl, have you ever been to London?",
        "Destiny: No. I spend my vacations at my summer home.",
        "David: Well, it's a young guy's paradise -- great restaurants, clubs, rich girls with titles and a deep-seated urge to rebel.",
        "Destiny: I don't think it's the same for a dude in a wheelchair.",
        "David: Yeah? What am I supposed to do?",

        "Bo: I'm not sure how much good I'd be.",

        "Dani: You stole my C.A.R.E. package?",
        "Tom: I didn't know it was yours. It was in my mailbox, so --",

        "Matthew: So, she sends you this stuff all the time? She must really miss you.",
        "Dani: Oh, no way. She's just guilty for not letting me see my father.",

        "Todd: I wouldn't get your hopes up on winning that trophy, Schuyler. The only prize sex offenders get is an ankle bracelet.",
        "Gigi: You ought to know. Come on.",
        "Jack: What's a sex offender?",
        "Todd: Well, for instance, I was a sex off --",

        "Jack: Why?",

        "Elijah: Why would you think that?",
        "Ross: Well, T\u00e9a is unbelievable.",
        "Elijah: Ross, did something happen?",
        "Ross: Oh, Lord, I ran into her. She was talking to Dani on her cell phone. She wouldn't let me speak to her. She hung up on her. Then she damn near killed me with a vase full of roses. Then she erased Dani's number out of her cell phone so I couldn't get it. Oh, she's out of control.",
        "Elijah: Yeah. She's also holding most of the cards. Where are you going?",
        "Ross: Where am I go -- I'm going to find T\u00e9a, teach her a lesson.",
        "Elijah: There's no need.",
        "Ross: I want my daughter back, Eli.",

        "Bo: Me, too.",
        "Nora: You think he's making friends?",
        "Bo: Oh, sure, sure. He's always been good at that. Kids are resilient.",
        "Nora: That's what I keep telling myself.",
        "Bo: It's me I'm not sure about.",
        "Nora: You think there's an instruction manual on how to put an ocean between you and your son?",
        "Bo: Especially when he hates us right now.",
        "Nora: Oh, my God, I'm on the verge of an anxiety attack, and it hasn't even been a day.",
        "Bo: Well, the headmistress says that it's best not to visit until he's become acclimated.",
        "Nora: Acc -- well, when the hell is that supposed to be? He's dead set against this place.",
        "Bo: I know, but he'll get through it, and so will we.",
        "Nora: Oh -- okay. I know I am a neurotic mother, and I know that I really need to cut the cord.",
        "Bo: Now come on. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Nora: Oh, good.",
        "Bo: I got to see him, too.",

        "Matthew: It must suck to be in the middle of a war between your parents.",
        "Dani: I don't remember what it was like when they weren't fighting.",
        "Matthew: Wow.",
        "Dani: It's not like your life is completely suck-free.",
        "Matthew: It's not turned out to be so bad.",
        "Dani: At least your parents get along.",
        "Matthew: Probably because they're divorced.",
        "Dani: Oh, how pathetic are we?",
        "Matthew: Yeah. No kidding.",
        "Dani: Oh, I totally forgot why I came in here.",
        "Matthew: What, your mom sent you a cake with a file in it?",
        "Dani: I got a message for you.",
        "Matthew: From who?",
        "Dani: A friend of yours. Destiny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: I have to admit, you have an admirable way with a guilt trip.",
        "Destiny: My dad says that.",
        "David: Have you even considered how you're going to pull this off?",
        "Destiny: Like I said, you're a Buchanan. You get us into that compound.",
        "David: And then what?",
        "Destiny: I was counting on you to help me with that part.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Sorry. I got the message yesterday, but the headmistress has been on my case about frequenting the boys' halls, whatever that means.",
        "Matthew: Probably that you're actually trying to have some fun.",
        "Dani: God forbid. This was the only time I could sneak it back in.",
        "Woman: Message one. Destiny's voice: Hey, this is a friend of Matthew Buchanan's. Can you have him call them back? Thanks.",
        "David's voice: Give your name.",
        "Destiny's voice: Oh, right. My name is Destiny Evans. Matthew has my number. Bye.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Dani: She sounds worried, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: I thought you were good at this kind of stuff.",
        "David: I will have you know I am a master of many things. Scheming is but one.",
        "Destiny: Then what's the problem?",
        "David: Ha ha! Where to begin? Let's see. Do you even have a passport? Wow. Aruba! I've always wanted to go there.",
        "Destiny: Greg sent the whole family for Christmas.",
        "David: Still, how do you propose to get us there?",
        "Destiny: On a plane.",
        "David: Do I look like an ATM to you?",
        "Destiny: Already taken care of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Destiny doesn't know where I am.",
        "Dani: She doesn't know you were going away?",
        "Matthew: We both thought I was going to Seattle for that surgery I told you about. She even showed up on the plane to wish me good luck before we took off.",
        "Dani: How'd she get through security?",
        "Matthew: Nothing stops Destiny from doing what she wants to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Coach? Do you know that's the second-ugliest word in the English language, right behind \"motel\"?",
        "Destiny: That's all I could afford.",
        "David: Broke into your piggy bank, did you?",
        "Destiny: And I cleaned out my savings account.",
        "David: Mm-hmm. So, you really care for Matthew, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Destiny has been on my side since we started high school.",
        "Dani: Before your accident?",
        "Matthew: It was her idea for me to fight for my surgery. She never gave up hope. She even gave me those sneakers over there for me to wear after my operation.",
        "Dani: Good friend.",
        "Matthew: Yeah. Too bad she'll never see me in them.",
        "Dani: So, she stood by you all this time, and you're giving up?",
        "Matthew: I'm trapped here.",
        "Dani: I'm trapped here. You've got a friend on the outside.",
        "Matthew: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Dani: Stop messing around and call in the cavalry, already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You must've opened that account when you were an embryo.",
        "Destiny: It's just money.",
        "David: [Gasps] I will wash that mouth out with soap.",
        "Destiny: It's not important.",
        "David: But Matthew is?",
        "Destiny: Of course.",
        "David: Why?",
        "Destiny: I love him.",
        "David: [Clucks tongue] Hmm-hmm. Destiny, does Matthew know?",
        "Destiny: No.",
        "David: You don't want to tell him?",
        "Destiny: He wouldn't hear me.",
        "David: Story of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Let me see if I understand you. You're saying that my first official act if I'm elected mayor --",
        "Amelia: When you're elected --",
        "Dorian: Okay. Should be to legitimize all these symbolic gay marriages.",
        "Amelia: If you want to effect real change.",
        "Dorian: But I cannot change the law.",
        "Amelia: But you can issue marriage licenses.",
        "Dorian: If I do what you're suggesting, that would mean that you and I really were married.",
        "Amelia: Well, that doesn't have to change anything between us or between you and David. You'd still be free to love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Greg: You've got a follow-up in 3 weeks.",
        "Shaun: I haven't even left, and you're pulling me back.",
        "Greg: Hey, well, feel free to reschedule. Just make sure you thank all the nurses who looked after your sorry butt.",
        "Shaun: I'll kiss them on the way out. So, when's that?",
        "Mr. Evans: Hey, what's the hurry? You got a whole bunch of time ahead of you, man.",
        "Shaun: Sooner you bail me out, the sooner I can hit the town with Rachel.",
        "Mr. Evans: Careful. You shouldn't push yourself too hard.",
        "Shaun: They took the stitches out.",
        "Mr. Evans: Not you. Rachel.",
        "Shaun: Trust me. She's been waiting for this day just as long as I have. Excuse me, Pop. I got to go get fly.",
        "Mr. Evans: Yeah. You okay?",
        "Greg: Yeah. Yeah. Couldn't be better.",
        "Mr. Evans: Hmm, you sure?",
        "Greg: I may not be as good as twinkle toes out there, but, yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Mr. Evans: Hmm, even though you've given up on Rachel. Eh, your mother told me.",
        "Greg: Um, seemed like the best move for everyone.",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, I have to disagree.",
        "Greg: I thought you two were a united front.",
        "Mr. Evans: Not this time. If you want Rachel and Rachel wants you, you should be together.",
        "Greg: What about Shaun?",
        "Mr. Evans: Look. I don't want to see either one of my sons unhappy.",
        "Greg: Yeah. Well, if he gets his heart broken --",
        "Mr. Evans: No way to stop it.",
        "Greg: Pop --",
        "Mr. Evans: The longer you wait, the worse it's gonna be.",
        "Greg: Yeah, but Mom --",
        "Mr. Evans: She's can't protect Shaun forever, and she can't live your life for you, either.",
        "Greg: Does she know that?",
        "Mr. Evans: Well, I'll talk to her when the time is right.",
        "Greg: Yeah. What time is that?",
        "Mr. Evans: When Shaun gets his heart broken.",
        "Greg: No. I can't. I can't do this, Pop.",
        "Mr. Evans: No. It's up to Rachel what happens now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rachel: Seems like Ross keeps showing up at the worst possible moments.",
        "T\u00e9a: Ha! Wish I could get rid of him, believe me.",
        "Rachel: You're not afraid of him, are you?",
        "T\u00e9a: He's very unpredictable.",
        "Rachel: In my trade, that's code for abusive.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. He has a temper. I've only seen it a few times, like when I tried to leave him last year. He went crazy.",
        "Rachel: When else?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, when I went to Todd's recently, he wanted me to let him speak to Daniella. I wouldn't, so things got a little physical. What are you doing?",
        "Rachel: I'm calling the police.",
        "T\u00e9a: What's the point?",
        "Rachel: In arresting the person that assaulted you?",
        "T\u00e9a: It'll be my word against Ross'.",
        "Rachel: Well, at least get a big, burly cop to scare the crap out of him.",
        "T\u00e9a: He's already under arrest, totally unrelated charges.",
        "Rachel: And you just want to let this go?",
        "T\u00e9a: Look. I cannot corner him, Rachel. He could kidnap Daniella, and I cannot let that happen.",

        "Elijah: Will you calm down?",
        "Ross: How?",
        "Elijah: T\u00e9a's phone records. There's one number that keeps cropping up daily. It's to a mobile phone just outside London.",
        "Ross: London, London. Dani is in London? Is she by herself?",
        "Elijah: No, not quite. There's also several calls to the office of a boarding school there.",
        "Ross: T\u00e9a sent her to some English preppie prison, huh?",
        "Elijah: So it seems.",
        "Ross: This the address?",
        "Elijah: Yeah, to the administrative office.",
        "Ross: Well, all right, big bro. Let's get going. Let's get a move on.",

        "Eunice: Be quick about it, people. I have a protest to get to.",
        "Blair: Come on.",
        "Todd: Okay. We're totally taking these losers. Am I right?",
        "Jack: Yep.",
        "Eunice: As you know, in Halloween fashion, one day you're in, and the next day, you're out.",
        "Todd: Hey, uh, Joplin. I hope you brought your milk money because you're about to be schooled.",

        "Headmistress: Your parents left specific instructions that you weren't to have a phone.",
        "Dani: It's not his. It's mine.",
        "Headmistress: And what did we say about not frequenting the boys' floor?",
        "Dani: We didn't say anything because I don't know what \"frequenting\" means.",
        "Headmistress: Perhaps you should go back to your room and look it up.",
