        "Bo tells the others that Spencer has offered to help save Kelly's baby. Dorian balks at that idea. Bo will go and talk to the man and see if this is just a way to escape, or use this to get an immunity deal. Dorian feels that Kelly should be told about this and she goes into the hospital room to do just that. Natalie meets up with Cristian and she is furious. \"It's Vincent!\" Vincent arrives at the hospital and Evangeline tells how Hugh is trying to tell her something. He was saying, \"It's me,\" but she doesn't understand why he would be telling her that. Vincent and she go to the man and they can't hear him saying anything that they can understand. Evangeline starts leaving so she won't have to be in the same room with Vincent longer than she has to. He tells her that she doesn't have to leave on his account. He didn't mean to hurt Layla and that is the same thing that he told Natalie. Evangeline is disbelieving when Vincent says that he will make things right for Cristian and she storms off. When alone with Hugh, Vincent sits and tells the man that he really screwed up and now all the beautiful ladies are running off from him. \"Layla dumped me, Evangeline hates me and now Natalie she is probably running all over town telling that I set Cristian up. She kissed me you know.\" Vincent sees when Hugh's hand moves to the side of the bed and clenches. Vincent goes on to say that he didn't take advantage or anything, but there was definitely chemistry between them. \"Hey I didn't kiss her she kissed me.\" He leaves and tells his friend not to worry as he doesn't plan on moving up on Natalie. Natalie tells Cristian that Vincent confessed that he was the one who set the man up. Cristian wants her to come with him to the station but Natalie will not go. She says that she will do this the next day maybe. Cristian is suspicious of her protecting the guy over him. \"Is something going on with you two?\" She can't believe he is asking her that. \"John just died!\" Exactly, and that is why Cristian knows that Vincent would be right there to take advantage of someone in that position. She says that Vincent is trying to change and she wants to give him a chance like people did for her when she first came to town. \"I hope that there isn't anything between the both of you because tomorrow you and I are going to the station to make a report about Vincent setting me up!\" Kevin tells Spencer to take his offer to help Kelly and go to hell. He and Kelly decide on the C-section. The doctor gets the baby. \"It is a boy!\" the doctor says. Kevin and Kelly are thrilled, but it is too quiet. \"Is something wrong with my baby?\""

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We have to deliver this baby now.",
        "Kelly: No, no, it's too soon. Tell him. Tell him that there's something you can do to stop this.",
        "Doctor: We're trying, but the medication isn't working. The baby's heart rate is slowing down after every contraction.",
        "Kelly: Oh, God, Kevin!",
        "Kevin: No, it's ok, it's ok. Hey, there's good doctors here. They're going to take care of you, ok?",
        "Kelly: I can't do this. I can't lose this baby. I can't lose this baby, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Paige, are you telling me Spencer wants to come down here and help Kelly?",
        "Paige: He says he can save the baby.",
        "Bo: How? I mean, what -- what could he do that the doctors here aren't already doing?",
        "Paige: Well, he -- he's not admitting anything, but he's implying that he -- he made something happen and he's the only one who can fix it for her.",
        "Bo: That's a lot of bull. It's just -- he's looking for a chance to get out of jail.",
        "Paige: Yeah, probably.",
        "Bo: What? What, you -- you think there's something actually that he could do?",
        "Paige: I honestly don't know.",

        "Starr: I was until you asked me, mom.",
        "Todd: Hey. Lay off, she's a little worried about you. So am I.",
        "Blair: That girl showing our family in a slide show like that?",
        "Starr: Ok, mom, just drop it, ok, please?",
        "Blair: Well, I can't help it if I care, Starr.",
        "Cole: Hey, Starr's way too tough to let some airhead like Britney get to her.",
        "Todd: You know what somebody ought to do with Britney and her father? Take them and dip them in boiling oil until they die.",
        "Blair: Come on, Todd.",
        "Starr: Dad, no one wants to listen to you.",
        "Todd: I'm just getting into the holiday spirit.",
        "Blair: No, come on. Why don't you go bob for apples or whatever you want to bob for.",
        "Langston: The after-party at Madison's?",
        "Todd: After-party? What after-party?",
        "Cole: I can't. I've got practice early.",
        "Todd: That's right, and you've got a curfew, young lady.",
        "Cole: Yeah. My mom is way strict about that, too.",
        "Todd: Is that right? Well, I don't know the woman, but I like her quite a bit.",
        "Langston: Ok, then. We're out of here.",

        "Boy: Later.",
        "Todd: I don't think so, you little punk.",

        "Blair: Would you stop torturing her?",
        "Todd: All right. It's a little late. We should be going. And we'll drop you off so you don't miss your curfew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You're upset about me? What did I do?",
        "Natalie: No, it's not what you did. It's what was done to you by Vincent Jones.",
        "Cristian: Oh. Look, if you're talking about fixing the fight, I've got no proof.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I do now Vincent just admitted it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: He -- he does seem upset. You think maybe he needs a doctor?",
        "Nurse: I'd better check.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, thank you. I appreciate that.",
        "Vincent: What's going on? How's Hugh?",
        "Evangeline: What are you doing here?",
        "Vincent: I don't need a reason to visit a friend.",
        "Evangeline: Somehow I find it hard to imagine you being anybody's friend.",
        "Vincent: Yeah? Well, we go back.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, that's right, that's right. You're his buddy from college. Yeah, that must've been a really long time ago.",
        "Vincent: Well, it hasn't been a long time ago and it doesn't make a difference -- and I want to know what the problem is.",
        "Evangeline: I don't know. He's saying things.",
        "Vincent: What things?",
        "Evangeline: I was talking to him and suddenly he said, \"it's me,\" I think.",
        "Vincent: \"It's me\"?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, I know who he is. I mean, doesn't he know? Something's -- something's wrong.",
        "Vincent: I don't know. Let's go check on him.",
        "Evangeline: All right. Hi. Could you make anything out?",
        "Nurse: No, I -- I'll tell the doctor.",

        "Hugh: Nat --",
        "Vincent: What did -- what did he just say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Spencer said he did something to Kelly when he operated on her, something that would've caused this?",
        "Bo: That's the way Paige understood it.",
        "Clint: Well, does Paige think there's any truth to it?",
        "Bo: She didn't rule it out.",
        "Viki: Well, what could he have done?",
        "Bo: I don't -- I don't know. Dorian, what --",
        "Dorian: Well, he could've done a number of things, but he was supposed to do a cervical cerclage, which is supposed to prevent preterm labor, but who knows if he did it and he also might have introduced an infection into her system.",
        "Viki: Well, that's certainly possible. He did it to Kevin, didn't he?",
        "Bo: Well, nothing's impossible with Truman.",
        "Clint: Unless he turns out to be family, which to me is beyond the pale.",
        "Bo: No, he will never be one of us, never. I don't care what the DNA tests say.",
        "Viki: Bo, what -- what do we do?",
        "Bo: Spencer's offering to come down here and save the baby.",
        "Clint: Oh, why would he want to help? He hates all of us.",
        "Bo: I think maybe he's looking for a chance at maybe an immunity deal, maybe a chance to escape. I'm going to go to the jail right now and see if I can figure this whole thing out.",
        "Viki: Well, listen, in the meantime, Kevin and Kelly have to be told about this.",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Oh, no. Kelly can't stand any more upset.",
        "Viki: Dorian, you cannot keep this from Kelly. Whether or not Spencer can help or not, it has to be their decision to make.",
        "Dorian: Kelly is the baby's mother. I am her aunt. I should be the one to tell her.",
        "Clint: Well, Viki and I are going in with you.",
        "Dorian: All right.",
        "Bo: All right, look, I'll call you if I find out anything and if -- if Kelly and Kevin, if they decide that they want Spencer down here, I'll make that happen.",
        "Clint: All right. Thank you, Bo.",
        "Bo: All right.",

        "Michael: Ok, Kelly. Ok, that's it.",
        "Kelly: Ah!",
        "Michael: It's almost over.",
        "Kevin: Why the hell isn't the medicine stopping the contractions?",
        "Michael: It doesn't always, ok? It may be too late.",
        "Doctor: Prep her for a section.",
        "Kelly: No, no. I can't have this baby now!",
        "Michael: We can't wait, Kelly. Look, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to ask all of you to leave. We need to deliver this baby.",
        "Dorian: Wait -- there's some information I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It's a little early.",
        "Todd: No, you heard him. His mom is strict.",
        "Cole: Yeah, it's cool, Starr.",
        "Starr: No, it's not. We could take a cab home.",
        "Todd: What if you can't find one?",
        "Starr: Dad --",
        "Blair: No, listen -- wait, wait, wait. We'll send our car back to pick you guys up, ok?",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Todd: Hey -- one hour. Not a minute more. You got that?",
        "Cole: I'll make sure she's not late, sir.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you better.",
        "Blair: Say good night, Todd.",
        "Todd: Good night, Todd.",
        "Blair: Come on.",
        "Starr: \"Sir\"?",
        "Cole: Parents eat it up -- well, most, anyway.",
        "Starr: If you haven't noticed, my parents aren't like most parents.",
        "Cole: Yeah, they're actually kind of cool.",
        "Starr: You can say that with a straight face after the slide show that Britney made up? You must think we're a bunch of freaks.",
        "Cole: I like freaks.",
        "Starr: If that's supposed to make me feel better --",
        "Cole: I'm sorry. Bad joke. But I do like you.",
        "Starr: You can say that after everything you know about me?",
        "Cole: Hey, we all have screwed-up family stuff.",
        "Starr: Yeah, but you have to admit mine's pretty extreme.",
        "Cole: Well, I was wondering something. Your dad -- did he really rape somebody?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Vincent told you he fixed that fight? He just said it just like that, right out?",
        "Natalie: Right out.",
        "Cristian: Why?",
        "Natalie: I don't know exactly.",
        "Cristian: All right. How'd it happen?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- well, we ran into each other -- um -- on the roof of John's place --",
        "Cristian: Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up.",
        "Natalie: And we started talking.",
        "Cristian: The rooftop? What was Vincent doing on the rooftop?",
        "Natalie: He saw me earlier. I was with Jessica trying on dresses for the wedding. It got to me, I ran out. He followed me to John's place to make sure I was ok.",
        "Cristian: Are you ok?",
        "Natalie: Uh -- I'm better now. Anyway, the point is Vincent told me the real reason Layla broke up with him -- which is because he set you up to lose that fight!",
        "Cristian: So he really did do it?",
        "Natalie: We already knew that.",
        "Cristian: Well, yeah, but not for sure. Now I got proof. Come on, you're a witness. Let's go.",
        "Natalie: Go where?",
        "Cristian: To the police station so you can make a statement.",
        "Natalie: It's hearsay, Cristian.",
        "Cristian: We'll let them decide that, Natalie. Come on, let's go.",
        "Natalie: You know what? It's really late. Can --",
        "Cristian: The police station is open 24/7.",
        "Natalie: Can we just do this in the morning?",
        "Cristian: And what, give him time to do damage control? I can't let him get away with this.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Cristian: Why are you sitting on it?",
        "Natalie: I'm not, but --",
        "Cristian: But what? Why are you protecting this guy all of a sudden?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: Hugh? What did you just say? Could you make it out?",
        "Vincent: I don't know. He's, like, mumbling or something. I -- I don't know.",
        "Evangeline: Hugh, Hugh, can you tell me what's wrong?",
        "Hugh: Na--",
        "Vincent: I'm going to -- I'm going to get the nurse back in here right away. Nurse? Here you go. There you are. He -- he's doing something. I don't know.",
        "Evangeline: Yeah, he's -- uh -- he's saying something and it's upsetting him.",
        "Nurse: The doctor ordered a sedative. That should help.",
        "Evangeline: I should probably go.",
        "Vincent: Don't leave on my account.",
        "Evangeline: Honestly, Vincent, after what you did to Cristian and to my sister, I really -- I don't even want to be in the same room with you.",
        "Vincent: I never meant to hurt your sister.",
        "Evangeline: Oh, but it was ok to hurt Cristian?",
        "Vincent: You know, you can believe whatever you want about me. But I didn't want it to go down the way it did, and that's what I told Natalie tonight, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: Why are you doing this, Spencer?",
        "Spencer: What? Offering my medical expertise to try to help Kelly and her baby?",
        "Paige: Oh, out of the goodness of your heart, right?",
        "Spencer: Well, it's true, Paige. You know, we've always had sort of a soft spot for Kelly, which is why I've worked so hard to help her have a baby in the first place.",
        "Paige: Yeah, you made her think that. But I know you didn't do anything, nothing at all in that operating room.",
        "Spencer: There were other doctors there, you know, Paige. They could attest to my surgical abilities and my skills as a -- as a surgeon, as a physician. I mean, you don't have to believe that I did anything, but I did help her, and now she needs my help again. And what you have to do is convince Bo to get me out of here so I can examine her myself. Find out what is going on.",
        "Paige: \"What is going on?\" I'll tell you what's going on. She is in labor, ok? The drugs aren't stopping it, and you -- you can't stop it, either.",
        "Spencer: Has her water broken yet?",
        "Paige: No.",
        "Spencer: Then you don't know what I can do, do you? Wouldn't it just be terrible if Kelly lost her baby because of your poor choices -- much the same way Todd lost his baby?",
        "Paige: Oh, please.",
        "Spencer: You were there, Paige.",
        "Paige: Don't even begin to lay that on me.",
        "Spencer: You helped deliver that kid, right? You chose not to say anything, not to tell anybody, costing him precious time. Now he doesn't know if he'll ever find that baby or not. But this is your chance to redeem yourself, Paige. You've got to convince Bo to let me treat Kelly.",
        "Paige: Oh, yeah. You're going to help her, right, like you helped her the last time?",
        "Bo: What did you do to Kelly, Truman?",
        "Spencer: Just exactly what I said I would do, Bo. Whatever's happening now is -- is probably completely unrelated. The thing is there's a child's life at stake here. The baby's in trouble, Kelly's in trouble, and I'm the one with the expertise to do something about it. Now, what are you going to do? You going to get me out of here, get me into that hospital so that I can save the newest addition to our family before it's too late?",
        "Bo: Well, that's not my call. It's up to Kelly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Are you serious? Spencer might actually be responsible for this? Oh -- oh, God!",
        "Kevin: Contractions slowing at all?",
        "Michael: Not at all.",
        "Kevin: And Truman made this happen?",
        "Clint: Well, we don't know that for sure. Bo went over to the jail to find out what he can.",
        "Viki: Michael, can you wait just a little longer?",
        "Michael: No, I'm sorry, this baby's coming.",
        "Kevin: And there's nothing we can do to stop it?",
        "Kelly: Spencer maybe.",
        "Dorian: Kelly, what are you saying?",
        "Kelly: Spencer can save my baby.",
        "Dorian: You mean you're actually willing to let him help?",
        "Clint: Come on, you're not seriously considering that?",
        "Dorian: Well, at this point we have to consider all possibilities, including the possibility that Spencer's telling the truth.",
        "Kevin: Or it's just another one of his lies. He's been trying to screw our family ever since he got here. For all we know, he could've killed Duke, and now he wants to do the same thing to this baby.",
        "Viki: Kevin is absolutely right. I don't think we can let him harm our family any longer.",
        "Dorian: What if Spencer can help her, and we don't let him? I mean, if this is what Kelly wants, I think we should honor her wishes.",
        "Clint: Well, whether Truman can help or not, this is what he enjoys -- making us wonder, tormenting us.",
        "Dorian: Well? A decision does have to be made.",
        "Kevin: Just -all right, listen to me. Is there a way that -- that Truman could've caused this? And if he did, can he fix it now?",
        "Michael: I -- I don't know. Listen, anything's possible. But if her water breaks, there is nothing that anyone can do.",
        "Kevin: Now, just hang in there. Hang in there, Kelly.",
        "Michael: Spencer is an unbelievable doctor, ok, one of the best I've ever seen. I mean, he -- he brought td manning back to life.",
        "Kelly: He can do this. He can save my baby.",
        "Michael: Look, I don't -- I don't know that that's true.",
        "Kevin: Well, what would you do?",
        "Michael: What would I do? Listen, I -- I can't make that call, ok? I have way too many personal feelings for -- for Spencer Truman. Beside that, it's not my baby.",
        "Kelly: Oh, God!",
        "Michael: It's -- it's yours.",
        "Kelly: Oh, God!",
        "Kevin: Hang in there.",
        "Kelly: Ah!",
        "Kevin: Breathe, ok? Just keep breathing like we learned in class.",
        "Doctor: We can't wait much longer.",
        "Kelly: Kevin, what do we do? What do we do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked. I just didn't know if Britney made it up or not.",
        "Starr: It's ok.",
        "Cole: No, it's not. I mean, it's your dad's stuff, and if he did, then, you know, it's -- it's old news.",
        "Starr: He did it a long time ago. He d it in college, and then he did time for it, and he would never do anything like that again.",
        "Cole: Ok. Then -- fine, it's done. So, do you want to dance again or something?",
        "Starr: My feet are kind of killing me, and you have practice tomorrow.",
        "Cole: So you want to go?",
        "Starr: If it's cool with you?",
        "Cole: Sure. Whatever you want.",
        "Starr: I'll just -- uh -- grab my jacket.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Can I make you a drink?",
        "Todd: Yeah, please. Hey, were there -- were there any adults there at that dance when we left?",
        "Blair: I don't think so.",
        "Todd: There weren't any?",
        "Blair: Uh-uh.",
        "Todd: All right. You pay the sitter. I'm going to -- I'm going to be right back.",
        "Blair: Where you going?",
        "Todd: I'm going to get Starr.",
        "Blair: Our driver is picking them up.",
        "Todd: Well, that's all well and good, but I don't -- I just don't like her being alone at that dance unsupervised.",
        "Blair: Todd, she's not alone. She's with that boy, Cole.",

        "Blair: You want to erase all of it? Come on, Todd, there was some pretty good stuff, you know?",
        "Todd: Let's see -- oh. I'm drawing a blank. Besides the birth of our children, can you name one?",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah, I could name a few. Let's see -- how about when we went sledding behind Rodi's?",
        "Todd: Sledding?",
        "Blair: Sledding -- don't you remember that? That was lots --",
        "Todd: That's a good one.",

        "Todd: Yeah, it's funny -- all those memories have you in them.",
        "Blair: Real-- never occurred to me.",

        "Vincent: Ok. One little comment about how I run off all the hot women, and I'm telling you, man, I'm out of here. Yeah. You were right. I messed up. Layla's done with me, and her sister wants to nail me to the wall. And Natalie almost ripped my entire head off when she found out that I was the one behind the fix. Actually, I told her. I know -- hmm -- wasn't the smartest move I ever made. She's probably off telling her uncle, \"the commissioner,\" all about it right now -- if she hasn't already. You're probably wondering why I copped to it. I don't know. I had a weak moment -- when I kissed her.",

I said my apologies. You would have been proud of me, man, I'm telling you. But I tell you, there was definitely a connection. Which doesn't make any sense, because I'm still feeling the sting from Layla. You know, I was really -- I was crazy about that girl. Anyway, chill, man. You don't have to worry about me moving up on Natalie, and you can take that on my word. Why are you looking at me like that? How'd you know my fingers were crossed? Anyway, listen, you rest up, bro.
