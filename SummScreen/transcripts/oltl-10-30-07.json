        "Rex overhears Adriana on the phone and he thinks that she is pregnant. Starr and Langston watch a scary movie, but Langston's mind is far from on the movie. Langston lets Starr know that she doesn't think that she can do this. When Starr questions her as to what she is talking about Langston tells her that she doesn't think that she can fit in here. In Angel Square, Roxy and Miles are busily giving out balloons to the children for Halloween. Blair frantically searches for Jack. She finds him sitting on a bench. Jack tells her that she is more concerned with Starr and Todd is more concerned about his other son and Jack feels left out. Blair tries her best to assure him that he is loved and cared about the same as Starr and Tommy. Marty is at the diner and she telephones John for the umpteenth time. She leaves him a message once again. A masked man watches her from outside the window. Ramsey barges into the dressing room of the drag queens while they are dressing. He wants to ask them a few questions. John and Todd come into the bar and they want to find Marcie before Ramsey does. Layla and Vincent kiss when trick-or-treaters arrive at the door and to Layla's surprise it is Antonio, Talia, and Jaime. Rex questions Adriana if there is anything that she wants to tell him. Starr assures Langston that she is already part of the family. There is a knock on the door and it is Cole and Markko in their Halloween costumes. Starr begins to throw candy at them. Ramsey shows the pic of Marcie to all the drag queens unaware that Marcie is dressed as one of the drag queens. As Marty starts to leave the diner, the masked man comes in and refuses to let her pass until Blair comes in with Jack. The masked man leaves. Markko lets Langston know that he is not who she thinks he is. Starr and Cole and Langston and Markko are kissing when they hear Blair drive up. They immediately get up and pretend as though they are watching television. Ramsey busts John and Todd for following him to Georgia. The drag queens and Marcie manage to escape before she is found out by Ramsey. Ramsey breaks into the back room again and finds the bartender there. Ramsey holds a gun on him to make him talk."

        "Adriana: And how far into my pregnancy before I start to show? Oh. So it's normal to feel uncomfortable that early? I'd like to come see you as soon as possible.",
        "Rex: Oh, my God. Adriana's pregnant?",

        "[Woman screams]",
        "Starr: Oh, please. Is this not the most lamest slasher movie you have ever seen? Langston? Langston, are you ok?",
        "Langston: I'm scared. What's going to happen?",
        "Starr: Are you kidding me? You already know what's going to happen. The woman was told that she shouldn't leave the room, but instead, she's going to walk through the hallway with her nightgown on. Then the creepy guy's just going to come out and get her.",
        "Langston: Not the movie. What's going to happen to me?",
        "Starr: Langston, you know the answer to that, too. You're going to come here and live with us.",
        "Langston: I don't know if I can do this, Starr. I don't know if I can be a part of your family.",

        "[Children yell]",
        "Roxy: Hey, shut up! You want a balloon, you're going to have to back up, ok? No crowding the talent here.",
        "Miles: Uh -- I think we're going to need some more balloons. I'll be right back.",
        "Roxy: Oh, man --",
        "Miles: Hey, man, you take care, all right? Don't -- don't hit me with that club.",
        "Roxy: Oh.",
        "Miles: Whoop -- oh.",
        "Blair: What are you doing here?",
        "Miles: This is part of my community service.",
        "Blair: Oh, you're paying for almost killing Todd by dressing up like -- what are you, the Fonz? -- And making, like, stupid balloon animals?",
        "Miles: I wasn't found guilty of that.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah.",
        "Miles: No, I wasn't.",
        "Roxy: Damn right. All he was doing was blackmailing and hijacking Marty's confession from the shrink. If you ask me, which I know you weren't, he got railroaded. You know, I hate to say anything, but this whole rug-rat circuit -- it really blows..",
        "Blair: Have either of you seen my son anywhere?",
        "Roxy: Uh -- yeah, he's right over there.",
        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Blair: You are in so much trouble. Do you know that? You were supposed to wait for me at Capricorn and we were going to come over here together.",
        "Jack: I couldn't wait. I was afraid that they would run out of all the candy, so I asked the waitress if I can have some money. And I took the bus here. Hey, can I have one of those?",
        "Blair: No, you cannot, Jack. Sweetie, do you know how worried I was?",
        "Jack: Wow, that's a shocker. I thought all you care about is Langston and Starr. All Daddy cares about is finding my baby brother. No one cares about me anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hi, John, it's Marty again. I just wanted to see if you found out any news about Marcie and Tommy, and make sure you're ok. So call me, ok?",

        "Clarence: Haven't you never heard of knocking?",
        "Harvey: Sorry, girls. These boys from the FBI just won't take no for an answer. They're looking for a missing woman.",
        "Lee: A fugitive.",
        "Clarence: Oh, I'm sorry, honey, but you struck out. Ain't nobody here but us drag queens",

        "Todd: Wonder what planet do you suppose those people are from?",

        "Rex: One beer for me, one club soda for you, just like you asked for.",
        "Adriana: Thanks.",
        "Rex: You sure you don't want wine or something?",
        "Adriana: Uh -- I'd better not. Are you going as a ghost tonight?",
        "Rex: Huh? Huh?",
        "Adriana: You're white as a sheet. Are you ok?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I'm fine, I -- I -- I -- you were the one who said you weren't feeling ok.",
        "Adriana: Yeah, my stomach. I have to start watching what I eat.",

        "Adriana: I don't know. Ok, out with it.",
        "Rex: Out with what?",
        "Adriana: When you left the table, did you get some kind of bad news?",

        "Starr: Langston, what are you talking about? You're already a part of this family.",
        "Langston: I'm not a part of any family, Starr. And even when I was, I was an only child. I don't know anything about brothers and sisters.",
        "Starr: You think I did before jack came along? Langston, I've tried to hide him in my hamper, and I tried to lose him in a park, and I promise I'm not going to do that with you.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but your mom basically had to say that she would take me in.",
        "Starr: No, she didn't.",
        "Langston: Oh, come on. Ms. Woodrow from Child Services was standing right there, ready to haul me off.",
        "Starr: She wouldn't have said anything if she didn't want you here.",
        "Langston: I just don't want to mess up anything with us.",
        "Starr: Is that what's bothering you?",
        "Langston: And what if it doesn't even happen?",
        "Starr: Ms. Woodrow said it would.",
        "Langston: Yeah, but what if she changes her mind? Or her boss says no and I have to go back to the group home, or somewhere else? Somewhere worse?",
        "Starr: Langston, you're being crazy. My mom can get around this. It's all going to work out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You sure this is the place warren told you about?",

        "Clarence: Nope. Never laid eyes on her.",
        "Lee: You sure about that?",
        "Harvey: No such thing as a little bit pregnant and a little bit sure. Now, can we get on with our show?",
        "Lee: No, not yet. What about you, in the corner?",
        "Todd: I think maybe warren got it wrong. Marcie and my kid would stick out like RuPaul at a biker bar. They either never showed or already left.",
        "John: We'll see. Hey, buddy -- you seen this woman tonight?",
        "Bartender: Like I told the other guys, no.",

        "Langston: That would be kind of funny.",
        "Starr: Do you want to get the door? It's your house, too.",
        "Langston: Ok.",

        "Cole: It's us, it's us!",
        "Langston: No duh. I left you, like, 12 messages.",
        "Markko: Hey. Oh. So? Mrs. Manning's going to be your foster mom, for real?",
        "Langston: Looks like it.",
        "Cole: We want to celebrate with you guys.",
        "Langston: Well, it's going to have to be early. I'm still stuck at that stupid group home till it's official. I have to be back before midnight or else I'm busted.",
        "Cole: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get this party started.",
        "Starr: Right this way, Mister.",

        "Adriana: Sometimes I really need to hear that. And do you know how much I love you?",
        "Rex: I want a future with you.",
        "Adriana: We've already started it.",
        "Rex: Yeah? You think so? Aren't we?",
        "Rex: Yeah, but I'm -- I'm talking about more than that. Planning a life together.",
        "Adriana: What's up with you? You know that things don't always go according to a plan and you never know what could happen.",
        "Rex: Adriana, is there -- is there something you don't want to tell me?",

        "Roxy: Yeah, that's because you're good at it. I suck. Oh, hey, why don't you put on this scary mask and scare those little boogers far, far away?",
        "Miles: No, I don't think so.",
        "Roxy: Yes!",
        "Miles: No, I'm happy with my costume.",
        "Roxy: Costume? You look like all my old boyfriends.",
        "Miles: [As the Fonz] Hey. [Normal voice] I wanted a costume with no frills. I spent most of my life looking like a monster. Most people -- they don't get past the mask. Well, I think the kids are ready for some more balloons.",
        "Roxy: Aye, aye, if you say so, sir.",
        "Miles: Uh -- Roxy --",

        "Roxy: You mean, Marilyn Manson?",
        "Miles: Yeah.",
        "Roxy: No, cause the kids love it. I mean, who cares? You know, the parents are stiffs.",

        "Blair: I know things have been a little weird lately, but your dad and I have never stopped caring about you, ok?",
        "Jack: I told you I was the line leader today. You guys didn't even listen.",

        "Jack: When dad brings the baby home, will I have to share a room with him?",

        "Jack: Yeah, so?",
        "Blair: \"Yeah, so,\" newborns cry all the time. Your little brother's, like -- what is he going to be? -- Almost 2 years old. That's pretty big. They don't cry as much.",
        "Jack: Ethan said all his parents do is worry about the baby. What if you guys are like that?",
        "Blair: Is that what you are worried about? Are you worried that your daddy and I are not going to have enough time for you, Jack?",

        "Harvey: Sister, we could all use one. The point is, Marcie is out of danger.",
        "Marcie: No, no, no, no, I am not out of danger, Harvey. That agent -- he said those two men were looking for me. They know Aaron and me, so I have got to get my son and I have got to get out of here, so I need to know if there is a back way.",
        "Clarence: Not unless we start tunneling now.",
        "Marcie: Clarence, I cannot stay here.",

        "Rex: So, you tell me everything?",
        "Adriana: Yeah. Even if there was something that I didn't tell you at first, it's not because I don't trust you, it's because I don't have it worked out in my head yet. I don't know how to explain it.",
        "Rex: Well, maybe that's when you should tell me, so that I can help you work it out, especially if it affects me, too.",
        "Adriana: Rex, I would never make an important decision unless I talked it over with you first. I'm going to go to the ladies' room.",
        "Rex: Hey, you feeling all right?",
        "Adriana: I'm fine.",
        "Rex: Or maybe she isn't pregnant. She would tell me, wouldn't she?",

        "Layla: Hmm. It looks like more than that to me.",

        "Layla: That little girl wants a mama again.",
        "Talia: Layla?",
        "Layla: What?",
        "Talia: Don't.",

        "[Talia gasps]",
        "Talia: Oh, my goodness, that's very messy.",
        "Layla: For our most special trick-or-treaters. But it's going to take you a while to eat. Do you want to design some clothes for your dolls on my computer?",
        "Jamie: Cool!",
        "Layla: Come on.",
        "Antonio: I know Shaun works for you, man, but, you know, Talia's better off without him. Sorry.",
        "Vincent: I never thought it had staying power anyway. But Talia, she seems fine.",
        "Antonio: Oh, yeah. Yeah, she does. She -- she's toughing it out. But it must have been hard on her, you know, finding out that he wasn't as serious about her.",
        "Vincent: Well, maybe she wasn't as in to him as you think.",
        "Antonio: Oh. Well, she deserves somebody who's going to treat her better.",

        "Marty: Look, I'm sorry, this isn't funny. Do you want something?",
        "Blair: I don't want you eating any more candy, ok? We're getting ready to order some food, and I don't want you to stay awake all night long.",

        "Blair: Ok.",
        "Marty: Blair, do you know who that was?",
        "Blair: He had a mask on. I'm not clairvoyant. Why?",
        "Marty: Uh -- no reason. Look, I've been trying to reach John to find out what's going on with him and Todd, but he's not answering.",
        "Blair: Well, I talked to Todd.",
        "Marty: Well, what did he say? Have they found Marcie and Tommy?",
        "Blair: No, but they have a lead. Looks like Todd will be bringing his son home soon -- that is, if John and Todd don't kill each other first.",
        "Marty: All right, well, can you let me know if you hear anything?",
        "Blair: You know, I'm being nice to you for the kids' sake, but I really don't feel like being your best girlfriend, you know.",
        "Marty: Ok, yeah, we don't need to exchange makeup tips, ok? Just information would be nice.",
        "Blair: Hey.",
        "Jack: Can I have a root beer float?",
        "Blair: No, you cannot. I don't want to peel you off the ceiling, ok?",
        "Jack: Oh.",
        "Blair: Listen, I think we need to do a little bit more talking, anyway.",
        "Jack: But we already talked.",
        "Blair: I know, but I think we still need to talk a little bit more based on how you're feeling. You know, a lot of kids -- when they've got a new little baby brother or sister coming into the family, they start thinking that the parents, you know, won't have enough time for them.",
        "Jack: Can I have chocolate milk, please? Jack -- Jack, you know that your dad and me love you very much. Right?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "Blair: Hey. You remember the other night when all of us were sitting around Dorian's big old dining room table, you, me, Daddy, and Starr, and how it felt like we were, like, Miles and Miles away from each other?",
        "Jack: And I slid the salt to Starr and it fell on her lap.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Well, the point I'm trying to makes that around that big old table, we still have a lot of room, ok? Jack, but there will always be a special place for you there, right there at that table, and right here in our heart, ok?",

        "Starr: Cole, what's taking Markko and Langston so long?",

        "Cole: Starr, they're probably just doing what I want to do.",

        "Langston: What's wrong?",
        "Markko: Can you keep a secret?",
        "Langston: Hello? I think that's already been established.",
        "Markko: Ok. I know you think of me as this macho dude. Right?",
        "Langston: Yeah, definitely.",
        "Markko: Horror flicks creep me out.",
        "Langston: Really?",
        "Markko: Well, I -- you know, I don't start crying or screaming or anything, but you know --",
