Meanwhile, Destiny and David fly to England to find Matthew. She knows that he is not over Dorian. Dorian does not let on that she is not over him until Fish announces to the anti gay rights committee that he is proud to be gay.

        "Shane: Can I go, Mom?",
        "Gigi: Honey, I don't know. I'm kind of worried about all those protesters.",
        "Roxy: Oh, come on. The event is about love, and I'll take good care of Shane. It's about the kind of love that you and Rex have, the kind that can't be stopped, no matter what or who gets in the way.",
