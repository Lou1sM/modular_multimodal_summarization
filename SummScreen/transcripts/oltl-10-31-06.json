        "\"Take this baby to NICU STAT!\" Kelly looks around worried about her newborn son and what might be wrong with him. Michael can only tell that they are doing all the necessary tests right now. Natalie shows up to see Hugh and finds Vincent there. She is surprised but then remembers that he and Hugh were friends. He wants to know what she is doing there. She tells that she has a hard time knowing that Hugh survived the accident while John didn't. She is starting to accept that. \"And I have you to thank for that,\" Natalie says turning to Vincent. In the bed, the bandaged man's fist clenches and unclenches quietly. Michael tells that there is a 25% chance of the baby living. After Kelly is put into a room, she will get to see her baby. Kelly is stabilized and now she and Kevin can concentrate on their son. \"We have to give him a name. He has to know that he is somebody.\" Natalie talks about how she only kissed Vincent because she was looking for John, but she realizes that the man is in her heart and she doesn't have to kiss anyone, especially Vincent to prove that. \"Well you may be sorry you kissed me, but I'm not!\" Vincent says. BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! A nurse comes running in to stabilize her patient and Vincent and Natalie's visit is shortened. Vincent tells that it is funny but earlier, Hugh got upset with him over something else that he said and the very same thing happened. Natalie doesn't care about that. She tells that she told Cristian the truth about the setup. Vincent isn't worried about that. \"You were married to Vincent, who is going to believe anything that you say?\" Kelly was thinking about names and she couldn't find any that she liked until she got to the Z's. \"Zane it means god's grace.\" Since that is the reason that Kelly had the baby, she sand and Kevin decide that is the name they will give the child. Rex has a lead. He has three cars that possibly were the ones that had Todd's baby in it so long ago. He is sure that he will get a lead from one of them. Adriana has no direction in her life. Rex reminds her that she told him that she was interested in fashion design at one point. Bo learns the DNA results will be ready the next day. Natalie goes back into Hugh's room to say goodbye to him. She tells that now that she sees what kind of pain the man is in, she knows that she can deal with her problems and face that John is truly gone. She goes to the door but turns suddenly and asks the mummy-like figure if he said something. When she gets no response, she continues out. After she is gone, the eyes of the man in the bed both fly open at the same time. They are sky blue"

        "Vincent: Well, I've already told him.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, so what? It's not like he can do anything about it anyway.",
        "Vincent: But you can. What? You're not going to say anything about what you're going to do or already did? Ok, fine. We've established why I'm here. What's your excuse?",

        "Todd: Ok. That's fine. But, you know, let us know if they ever do again.",
        "Starr: They won't. Britney and I are friends now. It was just some big misunderstanding -- we're fine now. Everybody's good, ok? I'm really tired and I'm going to go to bed. Good night.",

        "David: Why'd you switch bunks? You wet the bed?",
        "Spencer: Oh, dear God, David. Please just go away. What do you want?",
        "David: You know, there's something I've been thinking about. If you've known ever since we were kids that you were Asa Buchanan's son, why did you keep it to yourself? Because if it was me, I'd have shown up on his doorstep, played that Buchanan chip. I wouldn't have run scams, done Ned Truman's dirty work. You could've lived in that big house. Instead, you're facing the big house. You could've been rich, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: I am rich, David.",
        "David: No, you're not Buchanan rich. Those people have more money than God and Trump combined. You could've had a nice slice of that sizable pie.",
        "Spencer: I have a slice of the pie, David. Trust me.",
        "David: Hmm.",
        "Bo: The DNA test results aren't in yet, but until they prove otherwise, there's no way in hell I'm related to you.",
        "David: Unfortunately, I still am.",
        "Spencer: What brings you back, Commissioner?",
        "Bo: I don't know if you're interested, but Kelly had her baby.",
        "David: What? Wait, it -- it's too soon. Is the baby ok?",
        "Bo: Alive. He's in Neonatal ICU.",
        "David: \"He\"? It's a boy?",
        "Bo: Yeah, Duke and Kelly had a son.",
        "David: Is she ok? And Dorian -- wait, does Dorian know?",

        "Bo: Ah, family will take care of it. You know, Kevin's there.",
        "David: All right. I hope she's ok. She really wanted this baby. This whole thing was a miracle, a miracle that you had your hand in.",
        "Spencer: Yeah, that's right, David. Go ahead. Pile on. Bo and Paige already accused me of somehow engineering this baby's premature birth. It's ridiculous, man. I had nothing to do with it. I mean, I swear to God on my father's grave -- scratch that, my father's life -- I didn't do anything to Kelly. I mean, I'm good, but even I have limitations, right?",
        "David: You knew if Kelly got pregnant, she could lose the baby or she could even die. So when you say that you did nothing, does that mean the whole procedure was a scam, Spencer? You knew the whole thing would turn out like this anyway?",

        "Kelly: I want to see my son. I want to know what's going on with him. Do you know anything?",
        "Viki: No, honey, we don't know anything. I'm sorry. Dorian, we should not be here.",
        "Kelly: No, please, stay, stay. Pray for my son.",
        "Dorian: Oh. Have you checked the baby's glucose serum and his bilirubin?",
        "Michael: We are doing all the tests, everything that's necessary.",

        "Marcie: Oh, well --",
        "Rex: Huh, buddy? You clubbin'?",
        "Marcie: He changed his sleeping pattern, again. You know, I mean, the pediatrician said that, you know, wait it out, give him some time, and maybe it'll change back, but we'll see about that.",
        "Rex: Or he'll just end up being a night owl, like his Godfather.",
        "Marcie: Please. Do not give him any ideas. I need coffee. Put that there.",

        "Adriana: Oh.",
        "Rex: And him.",
        "Adriana: Don't worry. There's plenty I want to do with my life before I can even think about having kids. Oh.",
        "Rex: All right, so you were starting to tell me about --",
        "Adriana: Oh, yeah, well --",
        "Marcie: I think I should've gotten a whole pot. You know, between staying up with Tommy and waiting up for Michael, well, I think I'm never going to get any more sleep for the rest of my life.",
        "Adriana: Oh. Oh, my gosh! I -- I just realized something.",
        "Marcie: What?",
        "Adriana: Do you guys realize who Tommy looks like?",

        "Blair: And we danced.",
        "Todd: We had to dance, didn't we?",
        "Blair: And we almost kissed. Todd yeah, we almost kissed, but we didn't.",
        "Blair: Oh, Todd, we did when we came back. And we were heading up the stairs to make love because we're still in love. And if I didn't know it before tonight, I do now. It's like it was -- before.",
        "Todd: Oh, right, \"before,\" like when -- when I was arrested and you abandoned me? Like that kind of \"before\"?",
        "Blair: The way that it used to be, Todd -- when we didn't have to think or talk about any of that. We just knew what the other person wanted, and you know that better than -- than I do. Right?",
        "Todd: That was then.",
        "Blair: Yeah. And this is now. And tonight, I read your mind. I know what was in your heart.",

        "Blair: Not quite.",
        "Todd: Maybe not for you.",

        "Todd: What's wrong?",
        "Starr: I can't get online. My computer's not working.",
        "Todd: Well, I thought you needed to go to bed you were so tired?",
        "Starr: Yeah, I know, but I have to, um, do research for a project last-minute. I forgot about it.",
        "Todd: Oh, really?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Yeah? What's the subject? High school boys? [Todd laughs]",
        "Starr: Dad, Cole's a nice guy.",
        "Todd: Oh, ok. And what do you really know about him, though?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Mom, I'll be home right away. I just forgot something at the gym. Love you, too.",
        "Coach: What are you doing out so late?",
        "Cole: Oh, I forgot my gym bag here.",
        "Coach: Well, get it, get home, and get to sleep. We got a big game coming up.",
        "Cole: Oh, I know, coach.",
        "Coach: I pulled strings to get you transferred here to play varsity. Don't let me down.",
        "Gabe: Coach can be a real pain sometimes, huh?",
        "Cole: What's his deal anyway? I mean, you're on the team. How come he didn't come after you for still being here?",
        "Gabe: Well, I'm not the big stud who's supposed to bring home the trophy and save coach's job.",
        "Cole: What?",
        "Gabe: Yeah, yeah. From what I hear, his job's riding on the championship. No pressure or anything. Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: The baby is extremely premature. He weighs one pound, 11 ounces, and he's 13 inches long. That being said, premature babies face a number of uphill challenges.",
        "Kevin: Well, what kind of risks are we talking about here?",
        "Dorian: Kevin, please. Kelly's been through enough.",
        "Kelly: No. I want to know.",
        "Michael: More and more children born at this stage are surviving and even going on to live healthy and productive lives.",
        "Kelly: So he's going to live? He's going to be ok?",
        "Michael: I didn't say that.",
        "Kevin: Well, what kind of a percentage are we talking about?",
        "Michael: You know, I generally don't like to speak in those terms --",
        "Kevin: Well, Michael, we need to know, ok?",
        "Michael: Ok. 25%, 30% chance of survival.",
        "Michael: The baby's in an incubator. Vital signs are being monitored and he's breathing on a ventilator.",
        "Kelly: When can I see him?",
        "Michael: Soon. We need to run some more tests. We need to get you out of recovery and into a room and as soon as that happens, we'll arrange for you to see your baby.",
        "Kelly: Thank you.",
        "Michael: You have to rest now, ok? You've been through a lot, and this little guy is going to need for you to be strong for him.",
        "Dorian: Yeah. Honey? I'll find out everything that I can.",
        "Kevin: Hey, you should try and get some sleep.",
        "Kelly: No, please stay.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Kevin: Oh, baby. You're going to be ok. All right?",
        "Kelly: I have to be for my baby.",
        "Kevin: You will be. You're strong. Oh. Sweetie, listen to me -- you don't have to do this alone. Ok? We always were stronger together -- you know that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You did something to Kelly, didn't you? That why she had the baby too early. Don't bother denying it, Spencer.",
        "Spencer: Just go ahead, David. You're going to think what you want anyway.",
        "David: I ought to kill you, you son of a bitch!",
        "Bo: No, no, no. It's all right, David, because Kelly's ok, the baby's alive, and if Spencer did do something, we just hope that it failed just like every other one of his plans.",
        "Spencer: What -- what could you possibly profess to know about any of my plans?",
        "Bo: I'll tell you what I know -- I know Todd Manning is alive and well and he's a free man. I'm still the Commissioner of Police. David and Paige -- they've been cleared of Thomas Mc Bain's murder.",
        "David: Wait -- Paige has been cleared?",
        "Bo: Yeah. Yeah, you see, Spencer's the one that drove the final nail into Thomas Mc Bain's coffin --",
        "Spencer: Hmm.",
        "Bo: Not Paige. He just made her think she did it.",
        "David: That's his favorite subject.",
        "Spencer: You got nothing, Bo. What, you got the word of a drunken old pedophile, the word of your ridiculously desperate girlfriend who's only trying to save her own ass? Come on, man.",
        "Bo: [Phone rings] Buchanan. You two will have to excuse me. Yeah.",
        "Spencer: What's so funny? What are you smiling at?",
        "David: I see something I've never seen before -- that bead of sweat above your brow. You're nervous. Bo was right -- you've lost Blair, your job, your reputation. You're not going to be rich anymore after your lawyers get through with you. Hmm.",
        "David: That beautiful gesture you made of leaving everything to your son, Hugh -- that'll be for naught. So, you're going to have nothing left, Spencer, unless -- oh -- I have an idea.",
        "Spencer: I bet it's a really bad one.",
        "David: You could stay rich if you die before you go to trial.",

        "Starr: Well, I know what I need to know about Cole.",
        "Todd: Yeah, like what?",
        "Starr: Dad, it's not like we're dating or anything.",
        "Todd: And what did you call tonight?",
        "Starr: We're just friends -- at least I hope we still are.",
        "Todd: Something happen?",
        "Starr: There was just a little bit of -- weirdness, that's all.",
        "Todd: Oh, did he try something with you?",
        "Starr: No. It was just about the whole Britney thing.",
        "Todd: Oh, I thought that situation was ok. You were -- you were cool with that.",
        "Starr: I am, it's fine.",
        "Todd: Huh. Hey? You know it's me here -- you can talk to me. We've always been upfront with each other, even when we couldn't be with other people. So what's the weirdness about?",
        "Starr: You. He wanted to know whether Britney's stupid slide show was the truth.",
        "Todd: Huh. What'd you tell him?",
        "Starr: I told him that I didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Todd: I'm sorry, sweetie.",
        "Starr: You don't have to be.",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no. Uh -- what I did in college, um -- gosh, it's really hard to talk to you about this --",
        "Starr: We don't have to talk about it.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I think we should. Um, just, I don't know what to say. Um -- I'm different now, you know? I'm not that guy anymore. And --",
        "Starr: I know that. You're my dad.",
        "Todd: Oh, sweetie. I just hate this. I hate that you have to -- you have to pay for this, for what I have done.",
        "Starr: Dad, I don't care about those kids.",
        "Todd: Well, you care about Cole, though, don't you?",
        "Starr: But he wasn't being mean. He was just asking.",
        "Todd: You know, if -- if he's -- if he's a decent guy, he won't hold it against you that I'm a freak.",
        "Starr: You're not a freak.",
        "Todd: And he'll see you for the beautiful, smart kid that -- or young lady that you are and if he doesn't, then he's not worth this -- you know, it takes a lot of courage for somebody to see what's inside another person.",
        "Starr: Like mom sees you?",
        "Todd: We're talking about you now.",
        "Starr: It's the same thing. No matter what you did, mom still sees the good inside of you. Why can't you be like that with mom?",
        "Todd: All right, let's go check out your computer.",
        "Starr: Fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I'm here because I used to work with Hugh and I've always liked him.",
        "Vincent: So you're telling me you drove all the way down to A.C. just for that?",
        "Natalie: Ok, maybe there's something else.",
        "Vincent: Like?",
        "Natalie: Like Hugh was in the same pileup as John. He lived and John didn't, and I'm just having a really hard time with it.",
        "Vincent: It's Hugh's fault?",
        "Natalie: No. No, it's not even about that, not at all. It's just seeing Hugh here, it -- it makes this all very real to me, that John didn't make it and that he's really gone.",
        "Vincent: Well, Hugh -- you know, he isn't much better off than that.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, but he's got hope. And there isn't any for John. I have to accept that.",
        "Vincent: Are you?",
        "Natalie: I'm trying.",
        "Vincent: Well, that's a start.",
        "Natalie: Well, I have you to thank for that.",
        "Vincent: Me?",
        "[Monitor beeps]",

        "Vincent: Oh. I know. And you said it before. And what exactly are you thanking me for? For being enough of a sleaze to snap you out of it?",
        "Natalie: I don't want to disrespect him by finding someone else to replace him. Especially someone like you. Because he deserves better than that.",
        "Vincent: And what about what you deserve? You ought to be thinking about that.",
        "Natalie: What I do is none of your business. If I want to look for John, I don't have to look very far. Because I realize he's in my heart, right here -- where he'll always be. I'm just sorry I had to kiss you to find that out.",

        "Marcie: Actually, he really reminds me a lot of Michael. You know? I know it sounds weird because he's adopted. Oh, he's falling asleep. [Marcie laughs] But you know what? It doesn't matter who he looks like, because he's a Mc Bain. Yes, he is, and he always will be.",

        "Adriana: Well, I'm so glad that everything worked out for you.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. You know, I think it was fate. Especially now that I'm taking care of him, you know, it feels like -- it's like I was meant to do it.",
        "Adriana: Well, you're a natural, Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Well, it's kind of easy when you love someone this much. He just kind of fell into our laps and -- well, now that he's here, I can't really imagine my life without him.",
        "Adriana: Well, I don't think you have to worry about that. This little guy is not going anywhere.",

        "Cole: She has a name, ok? It's Starr.",
        "Gabe: Oh, yeah. Whatever.",
        "Cole: Hey, and you know what? That was a pretty crappy thing Britney did to her. Spreading all that stuff on the big screen for everybody to see.",
        "Gabe: Yeah, all right, chill.",
        "Cole: I mean, it's not cool.",
        "Gabe: Chill. It's not like Britney's my girlfriend or anything, ok? And besides, it's not like none of it's true. I mean, Manning did time in jail for rape. He did other stuff, too.",
        "Cole: Hey, Starr didn't do anything.",
        "Gabe: I understand. If you want to cover for her, that's fine. That's your business. Don't let her mess you up. We got a lot riding on this next game. You -- you sure you got everything you need to handle it?",

        "Blair: Well, a lot of history is going down tonight, including ours. Like you think I bought for one minute that misunderstanding with you and Britney? That was all-out war.",
        "Starr: Mom, please, it's ok.",
        "Blair: No, it's not ok. Sweetie, I know you don't want me to worry, but that girl is no friend of yours. You know that, don't you?",
        "Starr: Just let me deal with it, will you?",
        "Blair: Well, unfortunately, I'm going to have to. I can talk to her parents, I can talk to the principal, but -- or the teachers, but -- sweetie, girls like that have a way of finding a way to torture you. Take it from somebody who knows.",

        "Todd: How would you know that?",
        "Blair: What you said to Starr. About seeing somebody for who they really are. She's right, Todd. That's the way it was with us. You know, you -- nobody ever got us, but we always got each other. We always believed in each other, even when we made mistakes.",
        "Todd: Except when it counted.",
        "Blair: You know, Todd, I definitely made a huge, huge mistake, and I have admitted that a million times. But you think back on all the other times that I believed in you when no one else did. You're not going to find that with anybody else, and you know that. Brandy's on the table. I'll go get the glasses.",

        "Vincent: No. Who used to be married to Cristian.",

        "Adriana: No. God, no. But wouldn't it be great if I came up with a magazine that could put \"craze\" out of business? That would really make Dorian crazed.",
        "Rex: Hey, here's a thought. How about coming up with something that makes you happy, instead of Dorian miserable?",
        "Adriana: But I'm happy making Dorian miserable.",

        "Adriana: Where did you get this?",
        "Rex: A long time ago, before we ever went out, I met up with you at Rodi's. You had been doodling on that napkin, telling me about your dreams to be a fashion designer.",
