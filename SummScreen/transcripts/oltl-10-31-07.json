        "Natalie: Which was? You still can kiss, you know.",
        "Cristian: Thank you. My point -- that Sarah and Jared can go out on their little date to make moon eyes at each other, but no way was any of it going to bother us. And it worked, right? Right?",

        "Jared: She says she turns in early.",
        "Sarah: So what's the problem?",
        "Jared: Ok, the real reason is it's our first date and I don't want to move along too far, too fast.",
        "Sarah: Jared, I wasn't intending on throwing you on the bed and having my way with you. I had a good time tonight -- I don't want it to end. I'll make hot chocolate.",
        "Jared: Hot chocolate, huh?",
        "Sarah: And then we'll put the cups in the sink and I'll kick you out.",

        "Sarah: I have a three-date rule.",
        "Jared: Huh.",
        "Sarah: I don't want to push things, either, by the way. You want things to go faster than that, you might want to try your luck with my cousin Natalie -- at least I've heard. That was bitchy, wasn't it?",
        "Jared: Not if it's true.",

        "Markko: All I hear is Langston stuffing her face with popcorn.",
        "Langston: Stop! Why don't we play Bloody Mary?",
        "Starr: Fine, you want to ignore me? I really did hear something.",
        "Cole: Ok, what did it sound like?",
        "Starr: I don't know. It -- it wasn't a voice or anything, but the sound -- it just wasn't -- it wasn't right.",
        "Langston: Well, this place is old. Old houses make weird noises.",
        "Starr: Well, I never heard it make this noise before.",
        "Langston: Because it wasn't Halloween and you weren't paranoid or scared.",
        "Starr: But, Langston, my aunt has spent so much money to make sure that this house doesn't make noise. Cole, she got it rewired and re-everything?",
        "Cole: Ok, ok, ok, you know what -- you know what? It was probably Jack. He probably didn't go to bed like your mom told him and he's just hanging out trying to scare us.",
        "Starr: Well, I thought about that, but then I heard the noise come from outside and --",

        "Singers: Is it in his eyes?",
        "Todd: You're under orders from Ramsey? Like hell -- you can't keep me from leaving.",
        "Ramsey: You're not going anywhere, McBain.",

        "Cristian: What's the matter?",
        "Natalie: What'd you say?",

        "Cristian: Listen, if you want me to leave, I can leave. Just be nice about it?",
        "Natalie: No. I wasn't -- no, I wasn't talking to you. I -- it was more like to myself, you know, like \"go away\" thoughts of Jared -- jerk.",
        "Cristian: Right. Um -- so let's change the subject.",
        "Natalie: Let's, please.",
        "Cristian: Nice night for trick-or-treating, huh? Cool, but not -- not too cool, well, not for you.",
        "Natalie: Feel the same way.",
        "Cristian: He really does get to you, doesn't he?",
        "Natalie: He does not.",
        "Cristian: Right.",
        "Natalie: Hmm -- ok. Yeah, he does, but not in the way you think.",
        "Cristian: How do you think I think?",
        "Jared: Yeah. Tell us.",
        "Jared: You saw me kissing someone else and now you can't stop thinking about me",

        "Jared: How do you answer that one, Sparky?",
        "Sarah: Are you going to shut that door or not?",
        "Natalie: I think not. You can't shut me out that easily. I mean, come on. You're going to choose a kid over a real woman?",
        "Sarah: Marshmallows?",
        "Jared: Excuse me?",
        "Sarah: In your hot chocolate? I find that sometimes they make it taste less like instant, unless you don't like them.",
        "Jared: Like what?",
        "Sarah: Marshmallows.",
        "Jared: Yeah, I do. I will have them and I'm going to -- I'm going to help you, actually.",
        "Sarah: You're going to help me boil milk?",
        "Jared: Gee -- um --",
        "Sarah: I think I can handle that on my own. Why are you so jumpy all of a sudden?",
        "Natalie: What say you and I ditch this place and go get a real drink.",
        "Jared: No.",
        "Sarah: \"No\" what? What's wrong?",
        "Jared: Huh?",
        "Sarah: How much did you have to drink tonight?",
        "Jared: No, uh -- no, sorry. I'm just -- I'm a little lightheaded.",
        "Sarah: Is it something you ate? Are you nauseous?",
        "Jared: No, it's not that, either. Um -- I'm just not thinking straight right now.",
        "Sarah: Maybe you should go lie down on the sofa.",
        "Jared: Yeah -- sofa. Ok. Yeah -- sofa. Whew.",

        "Jared: Yeah, but the stigma of prison tends to linger.",
        "Sarah: Hey, I'm not one to judge with my own not-so-squeaky-clean past. And like my great-grandfather -- he was no choir boy. Didn't change how I feel about him, huh?",
        "Jared: Uh -- yeah, but you have to accept family without question. You have no such obligation with me.",
        "Sarah: Ok, you want suspicion? I'll give you suspicion. You are playing me, you slimy son -- what -- you think I'm not on to you? Huh, huh? This is all some game to get back at Jessica -- I can tell. And anyways, it's Natalie you really lust after, you horny creep. You can't wait to get your hands on --",
