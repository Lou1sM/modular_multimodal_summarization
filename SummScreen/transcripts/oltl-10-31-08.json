        "Many things are happening at the same time. Cole is having memories of his deceased mother and somehow knows he cannot leave town to go to college although he consciously wants to. Starr is very near to giving birth. At that same time, Tess goes to make certain that Natalie and Jared are \"in line\". But it looks like she's going into labor and dependent on them to help her. Marty envisions a baby that she knew many years ago but cannot pinpoint that it was Cole. Yet, she tells Todd that she cannot go anywhere or do anything until she knows who this baby is. Yet, she doesn't remember Cole quite yet. Nor does anybody know that she is alive except for Todd, Tess and Janet."

        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Starr: Oh. Hi.",
        "Cole: You come here often?",
        "Starr: Only when you're in trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Tess hasn't been home for two days so she's not going back there, but Tess will come back here for Bree. And when she does, I will be waiting for her.",
        "[Viki sighs]",
        "Todd: No, you can't do that.",
        "Viki: Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Yes, I'm on my way -- with payment in full.",
        "[Tina sighs]",
        "Tina: I sure hope I get my money's worth, because three people and one wonderful dog are depending on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ow!",
        "Jared: What is it, Tess? What's wrong?",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, is it the baby?",
        "Tess: It's nothing, it's cramps.",
        "Natalie: You're pregnant -- you're not supposed to have cramps.",
        "Tess: How do you know? Have you ever been pregnant? Will you ever be? Well, I guess if Jared works fast, maybe he can give you the gift of life for the next, what, 30 seconds or 30 minutes or for however long I set that bomb timer for. Death sex would be right up your alley, huh? Talk about going out with a bang.",
        "Natalie: Tess, you're obviously not okay. Tell me what's going on.",
        "Tess: I'm fine.",
        "Natalie: You need to call your doctor.",
        "Tess: Don't you tell me what to do. I know my body and everything is fine.",
        "Jared: Yeah, because you look like you're going to pass out.",
        "Tess: Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Then the three of us would blow sky- high, huh?",
        "Natalie: It's not just the three of us, okay? You have a baby in there and you have a responsibility to take care of Nash's baby.",
        "Tess: I will, just as soon as I take care of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, you are such a pretty jewel. Oh, I would take such good care of you. I would polish you, I would keep you safe and dry and I would only wear you to the absolute best parties.",
        "[Tina sighs]",
        "Tina: But I can't. I can't keep you. I got to give you to Cain for Jared, Natalie, Jessica, and David Vickers. I've got to do the brave thing. I do, but you know, Cain is going to take good care of you. I know he will. I mean, at the very least, he'll get a very good price for you. And then I, for once in my life, am going to be the one to save the day.",
        "Charlie: Well, hi, there. You must be Tina.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Why would you think I'm in trouble? Well, besides the fact that I'm in the cemetery at night by myself on Halloween? How'd you know where to find me?",
        "Starr: I got your email. And I tried calling your cell phone but you didn't pick up.",
        "Cole: I -- I turned it off when I got here.",
        "Starr: I called your house number and Nora picked up. She said she didn't know where you were. I figured that you would be anywhere tonight, it would be here to see your mom.",
        "Cole: So I guess you read my essay? The second I sent it, I wished I could unsend it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hi. Hi, hi. Oh, I know it's a lot to ask, but -- yeah. Do you think you could tell me your name? Huh?",
        "[Baby babbles]",
        "Marty: Oh? That's okay, no pressure. All on your own time. Gosh, I just wish I knew who you were. Huh? Who you belong to. There must be some reason I keep seeing you. When am I going to know what that is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Why can't I stay here?",
        "Todd: I'm just thinking even if Tess comes back, we don't know when it's going to be. It could be tonight, could be tomorrow, could be --",
        "Viki: It doesn't matter. Whenever it is, I'll just be here.",
        "Todd: But that's another problem. If she knows you're here, she's never going to show up. I mean, she could come tonight and see your car in the driveway. She'll just turn right around.",
        "Viki: And how do you know that?",
        "Todd: Well, didn't you say she was trying to avoid you?",
        "Viki: I parked around the corner.",
        "Todd: Oh.",
        "Viki: What is the real reason you don't want me here?",
        "Todd: Uh, I was just hoping that you'd take Bree and go because it's difficult for me to have her here. It reminds me of my kids and how I can't see them.",
        "Viki: How long has it been?",
        "Todd: Blair took out a restraining order against me. I can't come within a hundred feet of them.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. You know, Todd, I know how much you love those children.",
        "Todd: But?",
        "Viki: I didn't say \"but.\"",
        "Todd: You were thinking it. I could tell. I know what you're thinking. You tried to warn me -- about being such a son of a bitch about them, how I deserve it. Maybe you're right, maybe I do. Maybe I got what's coming to me. Maybe you do, too.",
        "Viki: Me?",
        "Todd: Yes. Tess comes out, you're not around. You didn't even notice. You go jetting off to Africa and leave Tess to ruin Jessica's and Natalie's lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Time's running out and I wish I could stay for the fireworks, but Bree's waiting for me and -- ow! God, ow. Oh.",
        "Natalie: I knew it, I knew it -- the baby's in trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Don't come near me or I'm going to pulverize you.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm staying right here. I'm -- I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Tina: Did Cain send you?",
        "Charlie: Well -- Cain?",
        "Tina: Because he told me I had 24 hours and I've still got plenty of time.",
        "Charlie: Okay, look, I don't know this Cain from -- from Abel.",
        "Tina: Well, then who are you and what are you doing here?",
        "Charlie: Okay, look -- okay, look, my name is Charlie Banks. And --",
        "Tina: Well, Charlie -- \"Charlie Banks\"? You mean Viki's Charlie?",
        "Charlie: Yes, and I hope so.",
        "Tina: Oh, oh. Thank God.",
        "Charlie: Whoa, would -- would you mind putting that thing down?",
        "Tina: Oh, yeah. I'm -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to threaten you.",
        "Charlie: No, that's all right.",
        "Tina: Yeah, not like I'd know what to do with that thing anyway. Huh.",
        "Charlie: Huh.",
        "Tina: So, um, how did you get in?",
        "Charlie: Well, Lois let me in.",
        "Tina: Oh. So, what can I do for you, Charlie Banks?",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm looking for Viki.",
        "Tina: I haven't seen her.",
        "Charlie: Mm-hmm. No sign of Jessica either?",
        "Tina: Uh, nope. I haven't seen her either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Tess? Tess, come on, talk to us. Tell us what's happening.",
        "Jared: We can help you.",
        "Tess: It's okay, baby. It's okay. You have to listen to Mom and slow down. It's okay.",
        "Jared: When's the baby due?",
        "Natalie: It's too soon. Tess? Okay, you got to --",
        "Tess: Don't start with me, Natalie!",
        "Natalie: All right, you're in trouble and --",
        "Tess: Shut up, Natalie!",
        "Natalie: I am not shutting up until you listen to reason, okay? That is my niece or nephew in there, all right? You are in trouble, that baby's in trouble. You need help more than you need us dead. Now, let us out of here, Tess.",
        "[Tess pants]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Uh -- yeah. When I got here, there was nobody here at all.",
        "[Tina chuckles]",
        "Tina: Nobody here but us chickens. But, listen, I have a real important meeting I have to get to, so, um, hey, it was great meeting you and I heard a lot about you from Viki.",
        "Charlie: Well, she said a lot to me about you, too.",
        "Tina: Really?",
        "Charlie: Absolutely.",
        "Tina: Um -- hmm. Uh -- you know, it's -- it's probably all true and I hope you don't hold it against me.",
        "Charlie: Well, as long as you'll do the same for me.",
        "Tina: You know, actually, Viki hasn't told me that much about you.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Tina: No -- it's more like when your name comes up, she just kind of stares at her ring and twirls it around.",
        "Charlie: That bad, huh?",
        "Tina: That good. She only does that when she is head over heels -- or worried. Or both.",
        "Charlie: Well, thank you for that vote of confidence, then, I think. Uh --",
        "Tina: And, you know -- I can see why she fell for you.",
        "Charlie: What, just like that, huh?",
        "Tina: Oh, I am a very good judge of character when it comes to men. You know, and I once fell for a guy like you -- you know, honest, decent, salt of the earth. I even married him and had his kids.",
        "[Tina sighs]",
        "Tina: I hope Viki has more sense than I did.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm not really sure I've been all that good for Viki.",
        "Tina: You know what, Charlie Banks? I'm going to give you a little bit of advice. You know the -- the caring, sensitive thing? I mean, that worked really well when you were trying to win Viki, but now that you want to win her back, you got to get her attention, just knock her socks off.",
        "Charlie: Well, I'm -- I'm working on that.",
        "Tina: Oh. You've got some tricks up your sleeve?",
        "Charlie: Well, you'll find out -- soon, I hope.",
        "[Tina chuckles]",
        "Tina: Oh, and your son is a great guy, too.",
        "Charlie: Well, I couldn't agree with you more. I just wish I knew where Jared was so that I could tell him that to his face.",
        "Tina: Um -- I -- I think he knows.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: What exactly are you saying?",
        "Todd: I'm saying when you -- when you ditch the family for months on end, go off slumming in Texas in that diner or -- or going to Africa to do your good works, things tend to fall apart on the home front, not that it's your fault, of course.",
        "Viki: You certainly make it sound like it is.",
        "Todd: I'm not saying that you could've stopped Marcie McBain, for example, from stealing my son but it -- it did go away once you showed up again.",
        "Viki: Are you kidding? She took me hostage.",
        "Todd: And you got through to her, didn't you? Just like you usually get through to Tess. Maybe Natalie wouldn't be missing now.",
        "Viki: Oh, anything else I've done wrong?",
        "Todd: Hey, you know, you've always held me accountable for my actions. I'm just returning the favor.",
        "Viki: And what does any of this have to do with the fact that I'm sitting here waiting for Tess?",
        "Todd: I don't know. I'm just saying that maybe if you hadn't have gone, things would've turned out different for a lot of people.",
        "Viki: How were you affected by that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hey. Um -- maybe if I held you. I remember. Would you mind if I picked you up? Oh. Oh, oh!",
        "Marty: Lullaby and good night in the sky stars are bright wild roses in bloom fill with fragrance the room",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I just shouldn't have sent you my essay, that's all.",
        "Starr: Cole, I thought it was amazing.",
        "Cole: Me spilling my guts?",
        "Starr: It takes a lot of guts to write something like that down on paper and then to send it out to strangers?",
        "Cole: Yeah, well, I still don't know if I will.",
        "Starr: Look, I think you should. I'm no college admissions person, but if I read that essay, I would think that here is someone who's real, who's not afraid to say how he feels. I'd probably think that you were the most incredible person that there is. Why do you wish that you didn't send me that email?",
        "Cole: Just wasn't fair -- you know, sending it to you without telling you that I talked about you in it.",
        "Starr: Cole --",
        "Cole: I -- yeah, I know. We're -- we're friends.",
        "Starr: We are.",
        "Cole: But it's not like it was before.",
        "Starr: I'm -- I'm really grateful that you wanted me to read that letter even if you did change your mind. It means a lot to me.",
        "Cole: You didn't have to come here.",
        "Starr: Yes, I did. You couldn't be alone, Cole, not tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: May your slumber be blessed lay you down and now I rest may your slumber be blessed",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I've done stuff that -- well, you know my rap sheet.",
        "Viki: I'm not sure what you're talking about. Is it Blair and the children?",
        "Todd: No, it's just -- well, you know how I'm always talking about what's been done to me by other people? Well, this time I did it to myself, I created it. And I have just been needing someone on my side.",
        "Viki: And you think I abandoned you?",
        "Todd: Oh, no, it's not about you.",
        "Viki: Have you met someone?",
        "Todd: Yes, as a matter of fact, someone who listens to me, who doesn't judge me like everyone else.",
        "Viki: That's good.",
        "Todd: Really?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Everyone should have someone. No one should be alone.",
        "Todd: Even me?",
        "Viki: Especially you.",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: I'm sorry.",
        "Viki: For what?",
        "Todd: Oh, I didn't mean to come down on you like that. You shouldn't have to have the whole weight of the family on your shoulders. I could've done more.",
        "Viki: What could you have done?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Viki: Excuse me. Charlie, have you heard anything?",
        "Charlie: No, I'm sorry. You know, I made the rounds of all of Jared's regular places and nobody's seen or heard from him. And so I stopped by your place to see if maybe you had gotten back here from your brother's and I'm -- that's where I am now.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm still at Todd's. But Tess was here.",
        "Charlie: What, and -- and Todd knew that?",
        "Viki: No, no, no. He thought she was Jessica.",
        "Charlie: What -- Tess isn't there now?",
        "Viki: The thing is that she left the baby here and she went off somewhere and we have no idea where she is.",
        "Charlie: Okay, but is Bree all right?",
        "Viki: Yeah, she -- she seems to be fine. Um -- I'm -- I'm going to wait here for Tess until she comes back for Bree.",
        "Charlie: Okay, well, why don't you bring Bree back here and we'll wait together?",
        "Viki: Oh, I don't know.",
        "Charlie: Look, Tess is going to go straight to you when she finds out that you've got Bree.",
        "Viki: Maybe you're right. Maybe I should come home okay, fine. I'll -- I'll be there. I'll be there soon, okay? Bye.",
        "Todd: Going home?",
        "Viki: Yeah. Yeah, at least Bree can sleep in her own bed. But look, if Tess comes back here --",
        "Todd: I'll be waiting with a straitjacket.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Let us out of here. You need our help.",
        "Tess: Like I need a kick in the gut.",
        "Natalie: Okay, did your water break? Are you having any contractions?",
        "Tess: None of your damn business!",
        "Natalie: God, you are so stubborn! Really, are you -- are you willing to put this revenge in front of your own life? In front of your own baby's life? Is this vendetta really worth losing your life? Losing that baby's life?",
        "Tess: Not going to happen.",
        "Natalie: Really? Okay, all right, Uncle Todd.",
        "Tess: What does he have to do with this?",
        "Natalie: Because you are so much like him. You're so much like him, and look at him, look how he turned out -- he's all alone in that big house. Is that what you want -- to be like Todd? Do you really, really want to put your life and your baby's life at risk here just so you can say you won?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: That's my girl.",
        "Todd: Hey.",
        "[Bree cries]",
        "Todd: Oh. Here you go.",
        "Viki: Listen, you be very careful, will you, because she may be Tess but she's carrying Jessica's baby.",
        "Todd: Okay, you can count on me.",
        "Viki: Ah, yeah, right.",
        "Todd: Bye.",
        "Viki: What a good girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Marty hums]",
        "Todd: Marty?",
        "Todd: What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Come on, Tess. Before you have another contraction, just let us out.",
        "Jared: Just enter the damn code, Tess, and we'll get you out of here. We'll get help for you and your baby, okay?",
        "[Tess gasps]",
        "Tess: Oh. I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry. I tried so hard. I can't do it anymore. I can't. I can't lose you.",
        "[Tess pants]",
        "Tess: Oh.",
        "Tess: Oh, God! If you burn me, I swear to God I'll make you pay. I swear to God I will make you pay if it's the last thing I do. Do you have it, you got it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What were you doing just now?",
        "Marty: Um, I came in to check on Bree. Where is she?",
        "Todd: Viki just took her.",
        "Marty: Why? What's Jessica going to say when she comes back and her child's not here?",
        "Todd: Viki's Jessie's mom.",
        "Marty: I know, but she left her with us. I mean, I'd be upset if somebody took my child without telling me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I put Bree to bed.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, good. Now, are you all right?",
        "Viki: Yeah, I'm okay. Still no word on Tess?",
        "Charlie: No, nothing on Tess or Jared or Natalie.",
        "Viki: I don't know what to do. I have no idea what to do. I mean, all we can do is just wait and hope that she shows up, right, Tess.",
        "Charlie: Now, what did Todd say when you talked to him?",
        "Viki: Oh, please. Oh, no -- insisted he had no idea that Jessica was Tess.",
        "Charlie: You don't believe him?",
        "[Viki chuckles]",
        "Viki: Todd has always had a very casual relationship with the truth. Although, I think in this case, tonight he was just trying to get rid of me.",
        "Charlie: But why would he do that?",
        "Viki: Todd? It could be anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I thought I heard singing when I came up.",
        "Marty: You heard that, huh?",
        "Todd: Yeah. It sounded like a lullaby.",
        "Marty: Yeah, the lights were kind of low and I thought Bree was here. I feel kind of like an idiot.",
        "Todd: No, no, not at all. It was lovely. If I was a babe, I'd -- I'd be in dreamland if I heard a voice like that. What?",
        "Marty: I wasn't singing to Bree.",
        "Todd: Who were you singing to?",
        "Marty: Huh. The son I never had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I can't believe you're looking at colleges.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I know. I mean, I wouldn't be if Nora hadn't stayed on my case.",
        "Starr: Do you think you know where you want to go?",
        "Cole: I applied to a couple of schools in California.",
        "Starr: Wow, California. Well, you did live there. I guess that could work.",
        "Cole: I was also thinking about maybe Notre Dame or Michigan.",
        "Starr: They're really good schools.",
        "Cole: Yeah. Well, Nora thinks I have a lock at L.U. because of my mom.",
        "Starr: L.U. is a great school, and you're a jock, and I think it would be really easy for you to get in. You would definitely -- definitely get in.",
        "Cole: I don't know if I want to go to L.U.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Cole: Because I'd feel like I got in because of my mom or because of what happened to my mom.",
        "Starr: So?",
        "Cole: I've spent this last year being the kid whose mom died. Everything I did, the way I acted, was all about me being alone, even though I wasn't. But then it hit me when I wrote this letter. I mean, instead of being all about what happened and what I lost, I should be thinking about how lucky I am that I had my mom for as long as I did. My mom, she worked so hard to teach me to be my own person, to stand up for myself. I don't want to feel like I'm working what happened to her. I don't want a free pass because my parents aren't around, and I don't want to blame my mistakes on my parents because they're not here. Wherever I go, whatever I do, it's all on me. I have to stand on my own two feet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: I was worried about you.",
        "Viki: You didn't need to be, you know? One thing I know, Todd would never, never let Tess do anything to me. I cannot believe I'm talking about my own child that way.",
        "Charlie: Viki. I -- I don't know what to do.",
        "Viki: Okay, I think the only thing we have to do is figure out how we're going to handle Tess when she comes for Bree.",
        "Charlie: Tell me something. Did Tina do all of the dealings with Tess the whole time you were gone?",
        "Viki: You know Tina?",
        "Charlie: Oh -- yeah, just met her, as a matter of fact. Believe me, your description does not do her justice. Huh.",
        "Viki: Why, what'd she do?",
        "Charlie: Well, I'll tell you what she didn't do. She didn't -- she didn't clobber me over the head with this rolling pin.",
        "Viki: She was going to hit you?",
        "Charlie: Well, I think she thought I was somebody else, so -- but she is worried about something.",
        "Viki: Oh, Lord. What kind of trouble is she in now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Smitty?",
        "Smitty: Who'd you think I was, Brad Pitt?",
        "Tina: I wasn't sure with all these people in costume.",
        "Smitty: I'm just going as a tired, old jeweler tonight. What are you supposed to be?",
        "Tina: Oh, a deposed faux-princess, desperately in need of a white knight.",
        "Smitty: Whoa. At your service, my lady.",
        "[Tina and Smitty laugh]",
        "Tina: So, my Lord, you got the goods?",
        "Smitty: Don't I always?",
        "Tina: Oh, Smitty.",
        "Smitty: Huh?",
        "Tina: You are quite the artiste.",
        "Smitty: For you, Tina, only my best. Of course, no forged jewel can stand up to close scrutiny, so --",
        "Tina: Don't worry. I know the score. Now, these babies here, they just have to fool one fool long enough for me to get what is rightfully mine for me to be able to put my niece where she rightfully belongs, in a padded cell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You're doing the right thing, Tess.",
        "Tess: It's not for you.",
        "Natalie: I know, I know, it's for the baby.",
        "Jared: We're going to get you straight to the hospital as soon as we get out of here.",
        "Natalie: God, Nash would be so proud of you.",
        "[Tess rattles lock]",
        "Jared: It didn't work.",
        "Natalie: It must've -- you know, maybe try the buttons again. You know, just try it again.",
        "Tess: Who says Nash would be proud of me?",
        "Jared: No, no -- no, no, no, she just meant that -- that he would be glad to know that you did whatever it took to save his baby.",
        "Tess: Yeah. He'd say, \"Your baby needs you now, so get up off your ass, Tess.\" And he'd also say, \"if you can take care of these two creeps at the same time, then do that, too.\"",
        "Natalie: No, you know he wouldn't say that!",
        "Tess: Yes, he would. I knew him better than anyone, even better than Jessica, and he wouldn't settle for anything less than having it all, and I am going to give it to him.",
        "[Tess breathes heavily]",
        "Tess: So screw you and your help! I can do this on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I saw trick-or-treaters everywhere on my way over here.",
        "Starr: Oh, so did I. Actually, my grandma handed out the candy this year. I didn't feel too into Halloween.",
        "Cole: Remember last year when we told Jack he could stay up and watch the movie with us?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: When I was on my way over here, I saw a kid wearing that mask. The same mask that guy wore -- the guy that I found in my apartment, the one that took me and my mom.",
        "Starr: Cole, are you okay?",
        "Cole: The mask, you know, I guess it's a classic. I'm sure it's going to be around every year.",
        "Starr: And I say we should torch the warehouse.",
        "Cole: You know, just for a second, everything hit me again. But just for a second, and then I was okay. And that's when I knew I was going to be okay. And then I could say goodbye to my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What're you talking about?",
        "Marty: Hmm. I don't know if I'm losing my mind or just getting it back.",
        "Todd: Well, start from the beginning.",
        "Marty: Um, okay. Well, I think it's all this time I've been spending with Bree. It's just kind of woke up something inside of me.",
        "Todd: Like memories?",
        "Marty: I don't know what they are. I just know that I came up here to check on her, she wasn't in the crib, and all the sudden, he's there. He's right there in that crib.",
        "Todd: I bet it's just your mind playing tricks on you.",
        "Marty: I know the unconscious can do really strange things, but I think my mind is trying to reveal something to me. I know it sounds crazy, but it seemed so real. I could not have conjured up an image like that out of thin air. No, this -- this little boy means something to me. He means something very profound and very vital and I need to understand what it is.",
        "Todd: Marty, I thought we agreed, we are not going to look into the past.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I know we did, but -- not now. This -- this -- this -- I need to understand what this is or it's going to eat at me for the rest of my life. This little boy is going to come back to me in any -- in some shape or form until I understand what his significance is. I can't leave him behind. Do you understand where something could haunt you for the rest of your life unless you do something and everything you possibly can to put it to rest?",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Charlie: Nothing. I was just -- it was just something, um -- was what Tina said about when you do that.",
        "Viki: When I do what? Twist my ring?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Tina said that you do that when you're, um, you know, worried or when you're --",
        "Viki: Or when I'm what?",
        "Charlie: Nothing.",
        "Viki: Tell me. What did she say?",
        "Charlie: Well -- she said you do it when -- when you're head over heels.",
        "Viki: She said that, huh?",
        "Charlie: Her words, not mine, so --",
        "Viki: Tina, the great observer of mankind. Thinks she knows everything about me.",
        "Charlie: Well, does she?",
        "Viki: I don't know. It's so late. Where is Tess? What is she doing? I'm going to have to go check on Bree.",
        "Charlie: Look, Viki, I could stay. I mean, if you really want me to leave, I will.",
        "Viki: No. No, I would love you to stay if you don't mind. I don't know if I can handle Tess by myself.",
        "Charlie: Well, I was going to stay parked outside, even if you did ask me to leave, so --",
        "Viki: Charlie, it could get really, really ugly, you know? I mean, she might need to be restrained. And she's pregnant. I was going to call Bo, but I didn't want to set her off.",
        "Charlie: Viki, I won't let anything happen to you, okay? Or your daughters. You have my word.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Running on rage is only going to get you so far, Tess.",
        "Tess: Just got to get me up the stairs and you know what? The pain's all gone now.",
        "Natalie: No, okay, but what if you have another contraction?",
        "Tess: I'm sorry for giving you guys hope, but -- wait, who am I kidding? I'm not sorry at all. It's all part of the fun, right? You know, when I think of Nash falling through the skylight and me begging for his life, I'm going to think about you two begging for your life and how it got you nothing, just like my begging got me nothing with Nash, so --",
        "Natalie: Hey, you got to stop thinking about us because I am begging for your baby.",
        "Tess: My baby will be fine!",
        "Jared: You don't know that. We will make sure of it.",
        "Tess: Shut up. Thanks -- it's been real.",
        "[No dialogue]",
        "Natalie: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Whatever it is about this little boy, it's something fundamental about me. It may be the one thing that I need to know before I can go on with the rest of my life.",
        "Todd: But what if -- what if that one thing undoes everything else?",
        "Marty: Why would you say that? You know something I don't know? Todd, if there's something you know about what this child means to me, you'd better tell me right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: What do you say we get out of here and go find Langston and Markko and smash some pumpkins?",
        "Starr: I actually have a better idea. I think I have some toilet paper in my car and we should go T.P.-ing.",
        "Cole: I'm glad you found me and that you read my letter.",
        "Starr: Me, too.",
        "Cole: Just give me a second, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Cole: I'm going to make you proud of me, Mom. I love you.",
        "Starr: Uh --",
        "Cole: What's wrong?",
        "Starr: I think my water just broke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Why did you want me to come down here?",
        "Todd: Something I wanted you to see. I don't have a choice anymore.",
        "Marty: Well, what do you have there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: We don't know how long Tess set that bomb for. I mean, it could go off any minute.",
        "Jared: No, she would be moving a lot faster if that were the case. We still have time, and Tina is still out there. She's going to do something; she's going to rescue us. We have to keep believing that, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Cain, I can't believe you're keeping me waiting with Natalie and Jared sweating it out in the basement.",
        "Cain: This dog belong to you, lady.",
        "Tina: Look, get lost. I don't have any candy. Cain?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: You know, Jared, you know as well as I do that this bomb could go off any minute and kill everyone in the house.",
        "Jared: That bomb was rigged by a crazy, pregnant bimbo! It may never go off, okay? Natalie, listen to me, do not give up.",
        "Natalie: Come on, Jared, we've tried everything. I think it's time we say our goodbyes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Okay, baby. They're going to be fine, we both will. We just got to get your sister and get out of here before this place blows.",
