        "At Rex and Shane's party, many things are going on with many different people. Tina wants Cord to be Brody's best man and herself as Natalie's maid of honor although they have not agreed. Cord is suspicious that this is a \"scheme\" on her part to get back with him, but he admits that he may want to get back with her. Gigi/Stacy and Cutter attend although \"uninvited\" and wearing disguises. Nobody recognizes her, but Aubrey reveals Cutter. Rex and Shane are getting along with Aubrey but Natalie is suspicious of her. Roxy wants Rex to be Brody's best man and argues with Tina. Clint and Viki stay home. He sees that the mysterious envelope addressed to him has disappeared from her living room table. Somehow it's made its way to Rex's home in the hay barn where Cutter discovers it. Todd is getting closer to Blair and to Sam until Irene \"haunts\" him reminding him that once they find out he murdered Victor, they will hate him. Jessica, Robert Ford, and Bree attend the party but have to leave early. Jessica and Robert are growing closer as are Viki and Clint."

        "Blair: Oh! Trick-or-treaters! You sure you don't need help with that one, buddy?",
        "Sam: No. Mom, it's a surprise.",
        "Blair: Okay. Well, you better hurry up because it's cutting into your trick- or-treat time, my friend. Coming! [Gasps]",
        "Todd: Grrr! Trick-or-treat!",
        "Blair: Aren't you getting a little long in the tooth for this?",
        "Todd: [Sighs] The day I'm too old for free candy is the day I'm dead. And thank God. I'm still kicking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So, Liam and Ryder are down for the count. Would you like to help with the trick-or-treaters? Trick-or-treaters?",
        "Clint: Yeah, I will in a minute. I'm looking for a letter that I swear I saw earlier.",
        "Jessica: Clear out, ghosts! We're home!",
        "Viki: Hi! Oh! Whoa, look at the candy.",
        "Clint: Bree, you made out like a bandit.",
        "Viki: And in record time. You guys were barely gone an hour.",
        "Jessica: Well, we would have forged on, but someone had to play hero.",
        "Bree: Uncle Bobby put out a fire.",
        "Viki: Really?",
        "Ford: Well, we passed this one house, and there was a flaming brown paper bag on the stoop, and I stomped it out without thinking. I-I left my shoe outside.",
        "Viki: [Laughs]",
        "Bree: But now can we go to the party? Please, Mommy. Can we go to Aunt Natalie's party?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Congratulations on your engagement, you guys.",
        "Natalie: Oh, thank you.",
        "Roxanne: Okay. One for you. One for you. One for you. And then one for me. And as my late great-grandmommy Ella used to say, \"Bottoms up and tops off.\"",
        "Shaun: What exactly are we drinking?",
        "Roxanne: Witch's brew.",
        "Natalie: Okay. What's in it?",
        "Roxanne: Oh, well, it's a little bit of this and a lot of that.",
        "Brody: Might want to run this down to the lab.",
        "Roxanne: Mm. This is the perfect drink for Halloween. 'Cause one shot of this, the doors between this life and the next life fling wide open. We see and we feel and we hear everything in 3-D. Right is left. Left is right. Up is down. And the best part of all, we see dead people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Oh, my God.",
        "Cord: What?",
        "Tina: Well, her hair's different, but that's her.",
        "Cord: Who?",
        "Tina: The dead girl.",
        "Cord: Tina, not so loud. That's Rex's fianc\u00e9e, Gigi Morasco. She died.",
        "Tina: Well, yeah, but the -- the -- the young man that was looking for her, I mean, he said she was just confused.",
        "Cord: Tina, have you been pre-gaming that witch's brew?",
        "Tina: No, Cord. Cord, I swear. I-I know this girl. She came to Llanfair just -- just yesterday. This girl is alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Showtime.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Cutter: Hey. It's okay. You can do this.",
        "Rex: Uh, nice costumes. Friends of the bride's or friends of the groom's or friends of mine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you're out howling tonight. You always did have a fondness for Halloween.",
        "Todd: You know I love a freak. And you have the best candy. I'm not getting any sugar from your bowl?",
        "Blair: [Chuckles] You want sweets? Is that what you're here for?",
        "Todd: You know it. That, and I kind of wanted to see Hope's costume.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm sorry. You kind of missed that one, 'cause Starr and James took her out already trick-or-treating.",
        "Todd: So, go get Jack. We'll T.P. the Buchanan house together. I'm serious. Go get Jack. I got, like, 96 rolls of double-ply in the car.",
        "Blair: Listen, I think you just need to take it slowly with Jack.",
        "Todd: He's my son.",
        "Blair: Well, he still thinks of Victor as his father. And he needs to grieve in his own time.",
        "Todd: Okay. How long do I got to wait for that?",
        "Blair: As long as it takes.",
        "Todd: Mm.",
        "Blair: I think maybe we could start with him, you know, actually using your real name --",
        "Todd: That would be great. 'Cause if I never hear that nickname again, it'll be too soon.",
        "Sam: Hey, Scarface.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: So, who's hiding under those masks?",
        "Roxanne: Listen, Monsieur Musketeer. What are you doing here?",
        "Rex: Answering the door.",
        "Roxanne: I'm sure these freaks are not gonna mind if I snare you away to share a drink with the guest of honor.",
        "Rex: Come on in. Make yourselves at home.",
        "Cutter: Don't mind if I do. Wow. Talk about up close and personal. That was Rex, the guy that you changed your face and nearly died for. Ring any bells?",
        "Roxanne: No one is drinking enough of my witch's 'rew.",
        "Rex: Well, it sounds like you've downed enough of it yourself.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, excuse me. You afraid I'm gonna make some kind of scene?",
        "Rex: Oh, like you need to drink to make a scene. I'm more concerned about your loose lips.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, you're scared that I'm gonna tell Nattie that Johnny still loves her. No, don't worry about anything. I promised I wouldn't. I made a promise to you. And Roxanne Louise Balsom never belches on a promise.",
        "Rex: Good, because my sister is marrying Brody.",
        "Brody: Damn straight. Any reason she wouldn't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bree: Please, Mommy. Can we go to Aunt Natalie's party?",
        "Jessica: Honey, I told you. That party is for grownups. Besides, it's almost your bedtime.",
        "Viki: Um, Bree. Sweetheart. Why don't you show Grandpa what kind of candy you got?",
        "Clint: Oh, yes.",
        "Viki: Don't let him eat too much.",
        "Clint: [Laughs]",
        "Viki: I'd like to talk to your mommy for a minute.",
        "Clint: Oh, we're gonna take inventory. Do you know what inventory is? You thought you had candy, but you got inventory.",
        "Viki: Honey, why not go to the party?",
        "Jessica: Oh, you can't be serious.",
        "Viki: Look, your father and I will look after Bree, okay? And I think Natalie would be really pleased if you came.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: What is this?",
        "Jessica: It's a paternity test. It's Liam's paternity test.",
        "Ford: I-I don't understand. Liam's paternity test should say that Brody's the father. Why does this say John?",
        "Jessica: I have no idea. I wouldn't be so sure of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Need some help?",
        "Aubrey: Oh, no. I'm the hired help tonight. You're the guest of honor. You just relax and have fun.",
        "Natalie: Oh, no. I-I am having a great time. And you're doing a really, really good job. You should be proud of yourself.",
        "Aubrey: Thank you, Natalie. That means a lot.",
        "Natalie: Prouder than of what you did to Joey. You ripped his heart out and drove over it with a steamroller. Don't try it with Rex.",
        "Aubrey: I promise you, there is nothing going on between me and Rex.",
        "Natalie: Your promises don't mean diddly. All you need to know is that I won't stand for it. See, my brothers, they have this weakness for a pretty face who talks a good game. But I don't. So, watch your step. And keep that cheese dip coming. I love it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Cord, what am I gonna do?",
        "Cord: Well, you can start by explaining what the hell you're talking about.",
        "Tina: O-okay. See, I-I was busy planning Natalie and Brody's wedding, all right? And then there was this girl at the door, and she said that -- that she used to live at Llanfair and that her name was Gigi Morasco, so I went in and asked Jessica, but then she said that Gigi Morasco was dead. And then when I went outside, the girl had disappeared.",
        "Cord: Tina, obviously, this is somebody else.",
        "Tina: W-well, yeah, but then a young man showed up a little later, and he said he was looking for someone, and he showed me the picture, and it was the same girl!",
        "Cord: Hold on a second, Tina.",
        "Tina: No, I can't hold on, Cord! I have to tell Rex that -- that his dead fianc\u00e9e is alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Okay. So, you remember anything?",
        "Stacy: No. Nothing.",
        "Cutter: Figures. I don't know. I just saw the two of you. I honestly thought for a second it would all come back.",
        "Stacy: I didn't remember anything. But I got this feeling like he was important to me.",
        "Cutter: You did go to some far-out lengths to try and snag him. I tell you what. I'm gonna go get us some drinks. You just stay here for a couple minutes and then we'll do another pass. But don't take that mask off for anyone, okay?",
        "Aubrey: Excuse me, sir, but you are totally coming undone.",
        "Cutter: [Coughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Happy Halloween to my favorite guy! I love you, Shane!",
        "Shane: That's my mom. I'm home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Like my costume? I'm Jaws.",
        "Todd: I will never go in the water again. Did you get a lot of candy?",
        "Sam: Tons. We didn't even hit the south side yet.",
        "Todd: That's 'cause your mom doesn't know where the really good candy is.",
        "Sam: I tried to tell her. She's taking me back out later.",
        "Todd: Well, at least she listens to one of us. You want to take this off?",
        "Blair: You are asking for it.",
        "Todd: I am?",
        "Blair: Yes, you are. There you go.",
        "Sam: Is Scarface trick-or-treating too?",
        "Blair: Now, Sam. That's not his name.",
        "Sam: That's what Jack said.",
        "Blair: Well, Jack is playing a trick on you.",
        "Sam: Again?",
        "Blair: Besides, you know, we don't call our friends \"Scarface,\" now, do we?",
        "Todd: Well, maybe we're not friends anymore. You know, we haven't seen each other in a long time. What do you think, Sam? We still friends?",
        "Sam: How can we be friends if I don't know your real name?",
        "Todd: That's a good question. From now on, you can call me Todd.",
        "Sam: No, I can't.",
        "Blair: Why not?",
        "Sam: That's Dad's name, before the bad man made him go away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Uh, we were just talking about how excited Natalie is to be marrying you.",
        "Roxanne: That's right. Wild, wild horses couldn't keep Nattie away from that altar. Or me, neither. Not that I want to try. Not that I want to do anything.",
        "Brody: Well, I can't tell you guys how much your support means to me. You know, Natalie and Liam are the best things that ever happened to me. I want to make the Balsoms proud.",
        "Rex: Quit fishing for compliments. I already said all the nice things I could about you the other day.",
        "Brody: I remember. You called me a stand-up guy. And I was wondering if you wouldn't mind standing up for me at the wedding.",
        "Tina: Rex.",
        "Rex: Brody, I-I would be honored to be your best man.",
        "Tina: Rex, listen, there's something I -- wait a minute. You can't be his best man. That's Cord's job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: How's the -- how's the rehab going?",
        "Clint: I'm not supposed to have too much candy, so if you find something healthy, like raisins in there, you save them for me, all right?",
        "Ford: Um, I remember when I got out of the hospital a year ago, it, uh, was a long haul before I could, you know, be 100% again. Of course, I didn't have a-a heart transplant. I-I'm sure that's pretty involved. Uh, so, what kind of regimen does the doctor have you on?",
        "Clint: What do you think?",
        "Ford: Well, I can imagine you're probably gonna have to do --",
        "Clint: Do yourself a favor and shut up. I know what you're doing, and it's as clumsy as it is stupid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I don't think that it's unreasonable that I would not want to celebrate the engagement of my sister and my ex-fianc\u00e9.",
        "Viki: See, I thought you two had reached some sort of d\u00e9tente.",
        "Jessica: Well, nobody's been punched or strangled lately, but I wouldn't exactly say that we're doing each other's nails.",
        "Viki: It would be such a magnanimous gesture on your part if you were to go.",
        "Jessica: I don't know, Mom. I could go, but [Sighs] Seeing Natalie and Brody celebrating and dancing together, I just -- I would hate to say something that we would all regret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Happy Halloween to my favorite --",
        "Shane: I was looking for that. My mom gave it to me last Halloween, but she died. Thanks for finding it. You want a cupcake? My mom loved them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: I'm sorry, Rex, but this is all wrong.",
        "Natalie: Uh, what's the problem?",
        "Tina: Well, Brody just asked Rex to be his best man.",
        "Natalie: And?",
        "Tina: Well, didn't he discuss this with you? I mean, 'cause certainly nobody ran it by me, and I have been working my tail off as the maid of honor to plan this wedding. I think somebody should have discussed it with me who exactly I was gonna be matched up with.",
        "Roxanne: Hey, you. Best man is Brody's call. And if he wants my boy to stand up for him, that's the way it's gonna be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You see that woman with Shane? Do you know her?",
        "Natalie: No. She's probably somebody's date.",
        "Aubrey: Careful, or you will totally come undone. Here, let me help you. Turn around.",
        "Shane: I'm Shane. What's your name? Are you okay? What's wrong?",
        "Aubrey: Oh, where are you going? Are you okay? Wait a second. I know those nipples!",
        "Stacy: [Breathing heavily] [Sighs]",
        "Aubrey: Why do I recognize that chest? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven abs! There's only man I know with seven abs!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shaun: Ladies, you both need to calm down!",
        "Roxanne: I can be calm. By the time I get done with you, you're gonna be bald!",
        "Tina: Yeah, well, at least I don't style my hair with a bug zapper!",
        "Roxanne: Aah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Look, I didn't mean to step on anyone's toes.",
        "Cord: Yeah, well, you didn't. You really didn't.",
        "Tina: W-w-well, why are you letting him off the hook like that? Can't you see that Cord is hurt because you didn't even consider him for the job?",
        "Roxanne: He doesn't even know Brody!",
        "Tina: Well, exactly. It's the perfect opportunity for them to bond. Besides, what about balancing the tableau?",
        "Roxanne: Tableau? What's that? Phony French? Dorian, where are you when we need you?",
        "Tina: I am gonna look ridiculous opposite Rex. I mean, if that's what Natalie wants, then she might as well replace me with Jessica.",
        "Natalie: Don't tempt me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Honey, I can understand why you wouldn't want to go. But --",
        "Jessica: Wait. Do you hear that? It's quiet.",
        "Viki: It's much too quiet.",
        "Jessica: Ford.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Come on, Ford. Even you aren't dumb enough to think that we could ever get along.",
        "Ford: At least I'm making the effort.",
        "Clint: Well, don't, because you are and always will be an unscrupulous dog led around by his hormones. I will never forget how you took advantage of my daughter.",
        "Ford: And you're a miserable, old bas-- you're a miserable, old coot bent on making your daughter's life as difficult as possible. Jessica has accepted my place in Ryder's life. Why can't you?",
        "Clint: Because a one-eyed, three-legged, rabid dog would be a better father to Ryder.",
        "Ford: Sticks and stones. I'm not going anywhere, and you can either accept that or you can rage yourself into another heart attack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You remember how we talked about how some people have two names? Like your dad. Some people call him Todd. Other people call him Victor.",
        "Sam: Like how Marcie and Michael called me Tommy when I was little, even though my name is Sam?",
        "Blair: Yeah, kind of like that. But anyway, see this guy over here in the wolf costume? You know what his name is? His name is Todd. And you know who he is? He's your uncle. He was your daddy's brother.",
        "Sam: Do you bug my dad like Jack bugs me? Sometimes he holds me down and drools on me.",
        "Blair: [Chuckles] You know what, sweetheart? Sometimes brothers do things to hurt each other.",
        "Todd: You take my life, Victor? I take yours.",
        "Blair: I'll tell you what. Deep down, I know that Jack doesn't mean it. But it still doesn't make it right. So, I can talk to him if you want.",
        "Sam: Dad would make him pay me in candy.",
        "Todd: That means that Victor was a good dad.",
        "Sam: He was. I miss him. Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You don't want to accept me in Jessica's life, that's fine. But don't be surprised if that costs you her respect. So, go ahead. Make my life miserable. Because while you are picking on me, I'm gonna be the picture of niceness. I will smile and say \"Yes, sir,\" even when you blast me when nobody's looking, because there's nothing I won't do to make my son proud of me. And if you end up looking like a nasty son of a... S.O.B., Then that's on you.",
        "Clint: Enough. Maybe...you got a point.",
        "Ford: I-I do?",
        "Clint: Yeah. Maybe I should make the effort. Or maybe I can learn to tolerate you.",
        "Ford: If you can tolerate me, I can tolerate you.",
        "Viki: Did you see that?",
        "Jessica: Ford and Dad make nice? Yes, I did.",
        "Viki: Will wonders never cease?",
        "Jessica: Uh, Bree, come here, sweetie. Why don't you go and get your coat and bag? We have one more house that we have to hit, okay? Okay. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Tina, I'm sure you understand.",
        "Tina: No. I don't. A-and I'm sure nobody else does. I mean, everybody knows I should be paired with Cord.",
        "Natalie: Well, it's too late. Brody asked Rex. Rex accepted. Right?",
        "Rex: If Brody wants to go with Cord, that is fine. I do not want to cause problems for Tina. Excuse me.",
        "Tina: Well, that is very magnanimous of him. You know, I am thinking bow tie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Hey, Shane. What was up with that woman you were talking to?",
        "Shane: I couldn't find my card that Mom gave me, but she found it.",
        "Rex: Who was she?",
        "Shane: I don't know. She didn't say anything, and then she just ran out.",
        "Stacy: That poor boy. He...he... he was in so much pain.",
        "Cutter: Look, you got to get this mask back on, all right? We got to go.",
        "Stacy: It felt like -- like --",
        "Cutter: What? Like you guys were mortal enemies?",
        "Stacy: No. That can't be true.",
        "Cutter: It is what it is, kiddo. Let's get the hell out of here.",
        "Aubrey: So soon? I knew it! You are going down, Cutter, you and your little friend here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Wow, this is really turning out to be quite a party.",
        "Cord: Yeah, unless you're Natalie, Brody, Roxy, or Rex.",
        "Tina: Why? Are they fighting?",
        "Cord: Yes, Tina. With you. Because you tried to install me as Brody's best man.",
        "Tina: Well, I thought that's what you wanted!",
        "Cord: I know exactly what you're trying to do here, and it has got nothing to do with Natalie and Brody's wedding.",
        "Tina: Well, I don't know what you mean.",
        "Cord: Whatever. As long as it distracts you from that whole Gigi Morasco business.",
        "Tina: Gigi Morasco. Oh, my gosh. I almost forgot. I got to go find Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: I knew I recognized that body.",
        "Cutter: Can't get me out of your head, huh?",
        "Aubrey: Have you no shame, Cutter? Crashing an engagement party? And I told you to stay away from Rex!",
        "Rex: No, that's okay.",
        "Aubrey: I caught Cutter and his little accomplice here. I'll call Security and have --",
        "Rex: No. Don't worry it. I'll handle it. What are you doing here?",
        "Cutter: I heard there'd be candy.",
        "Rex: You still trying to convince me that Gigi's alive somewhere, hoping that I'll give you a finder's fee in exchange for my dead fianc\u00e9e? Oh, this must be your little partner in crime.",
        "Cutter: Lay off, Balsom.",
        "Rex: No, no. This is -- this is -- this is the girl you were gonna try to pass off as Gigi, right? Well, hey, let's see lose the mask, see how close you would have come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Rex! Where is he?",
        "Cord: All right, Tina. Come on. You're coming with me.",
        "Tina: What? To find Rex?",
        "Cord: No, to talk. Just you and me. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Are you sure you're okay with Cord being your best man and not Rex? Because honestly, if that bothers you, I'm sure if you talked to Cord, he would have no problem stepping aside.",
        "Brody: No, I don't want to argue with Tina. Going to war was nothing compared to that woman.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs]",
        "Brody: Besides, the only thing I care about is becoming your husband. [Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Hey, remind me to send your mom a thank-you for letting me borrow Joey's old shoe. It makes for a great costume.",
        "Jessica: It does?",
        "Ford: Yeah, \"The Man With One Red Shoe\"? The movie?",
        "Jessica: Oh. Bree, why don't you look at the pumpkins? I'm a little on edge.",
        "Jessica: No, no. Um, so Brody and Natalie can wonder why you're taking my daughter out trick-or-treating? I don't think so. It would have been worse to stay at home. But thank you. And thanks for coming.",
        "Ford: Sure. I can't let you do this alone.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I'll be fine. And civil.",
        "Ford: Even though you're still on the fence about, you know, telling Natalie that Liam might be John's?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Bree: Trick-or-treat!",
        "Todd: I'm done. Hey. Check it out. Let's see yours.",
        "Sam: It's you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, it is. Blows my pumpkin right out of the patch.",
        "Blair: Okay, who's ready to go trick-or-treating?",
        "Sam: Me! Can Uncle Todd come, too?",
        "Blair: Well, actually, Uncle Todd may already have some plans.",
        "Todd: Nope. No plans. I'm going trick-or-treating. You just try and stop me.",
        "Sam: Yes!",
        "Blair: [Chuckles] Okay, Sam. Well, why don't you go get your goodie bag, okay?",
        "Todd: Go ahead. Go throw on a costume. I'll, uh, put these pumpkins outside.",
        "Blair: Thank you.",
        "Todd: For what?",
        "Blair: Just for being so kind to Victor's little boy.",
        "Todd: He's your little boy, too, right?",
        "Blair: Um...I'll be back.",
        "Todd: Just spit it out, Manning. Tell her you want her back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So, what's next? Uh, a cookout with Carlo Hesser?",
        "Clint: Excuse me?",
        "Viki: You're just on some streak. You extended an olive branch to Rex then to Brody then to Robert Ford. Can David Vickers be far behind?",
        "Clint: You think I'm losing my edge?",
        "Viki: No. On the contrary. You are rediscovering something that -- that is inside yourself, something that's been gone, actually, since the day you were estranged from Bo. I hope it sticks...because it reminds me of the way things used to be.",
        "Clint: When things were simpler.",
        "Viki: [Chuckles] When were things ever simpler?",
        "Clint: They were when you wore that. You remember?",
        "Viki: Yeah. You know, when Joe died, I thought that a part of me had died with him, and I thought my only purpose in life would be to raise my two boys, that there were no more chances for me.",
        "Clint: Well, how wrong you were. And as far as I'm concerned, you still have all sorts of chances. And the question is... when are you gonna start taking them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Blair, I've floated on a raft across an ocean to get to you. Broke out of a paramilitary institution. I feel like you owe me. You want to make out? Yeah, I wouldn't, either. Not exactly Shakespeare. Alas, poor Victor. I knew him well. Simple and direct, Manning. It's always the way to go. I love you, Blair. I always have. I want you back. Not really gonna make out with a pumpkin. Pumpkin's a pumpkin. [Sighs] I love you. I want you back. I love you and I want you --",
        "Irene: Ask and ye shall receive.",
        "Todd: Go away.",
        "Irene: So you can tell Blair that you love her and want her back? I think not.",
        "Todd: You have no say in that. On your bike.",
        "Irene: What about Sam?",
        "Todd: The kid likes me.",
        "Irene: You think he'd be drawing pumpkins in your likeness if he knew you killed his father? Would Jack forgive you? Would Blair understand and take you back?",
        "Todd: Only one way to find out.",
        "Irene: Blair is going to hate you. So is sweet little Sam. And Jack? Well, nothing much will change there. I guess we found our silver lining.",
        "Todd: They're not gonna find out. How are they gonna find out? You're not gonna tell them. You're dead.",
        "Irene: I won't say a word. But I won't need to, because you will do all the work for me.",
        "Todd: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Irene: No? Well, then, by all means, tell Blair how you feel. Reunite. Have a grand time trick-or-treating. We'll see how long your happiness lasts once they see through your disguise to the killer that you really are. You'll be left all alone, begging for me to come back. [Laughs]",
        "Todd: Go back to hell!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Boy, you don't give up, do you? You're still challenging me.",
        "Clint: Well, that's what I do best. Ever since we first met. You remember?",
        "Viki: How could I forget? When I met you, you were an arrogant pain in the... butt. [Chuckles] Thought you knew everything there was to know about journalism.",
        "Clint: Joe agreed. That's why he hired me.",
        "Viki: He hired you to keep an eye on me.",
        "Clint: [Chuckles] And look at me. Still on the job.",
        "Viki: I think that that's a career you could finally retire from.",
        "Clint: Oh, no can do. It was a lifetime appointment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Natalie, that's too much.",
        "Natalie: Oh, come on. I'm her aunt. I'm supposed to spoil her.",
        "Bree: Hey. This isn't a treat. Someone tricked me!",
        "Natalie: Do you have to go so soon?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I don't want Bree to be up too late.",
        "Natalie: Well, Rex is just about to make a speech. I mean, he should be any minute.",
        "Ford: Actually, Jessica's covering for me. I had a bad candy apple earlier, and I felt a little queasy on the way over, so...",
        "Jessica: I have to drop Ford off. Yeah.",
        "Natalie: Sure. Yeah.",
        "Brody: We really appreciate you stopping by.",
        "Jessica: Congratulations. Come on, sweetie.",
        "Natalie: Bye, Bree.",
        "Brody: That was nice of them.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It was.",
        "Jessica: Thank you for coming to my rescue.",
        "Ford: Anytime.",
        "Jessica: [Laughs] Come on, Bree. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Well, come on, lady. Let's lose the mask and see the woman Cutter thought I'd fall for.",
        "Cutter: Whoa. Hey. Hey. That's enough. You guys caught us. The jig's up. Yay for you. No need to manhandle her. We're leaving.",
        "Aubrey: I'm really sorry. I should have had a better anti-Cutter strategy.",
        "Rex: It's not your fault. I'm just glad you caught on to them.",
        "Aubrey: But they're gone now. Don't let them ruin your night. Come on.",
        "Stacy: Why did Rex say you were trying to pass me off as Gigi? What the hell are you up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Cord, why did you bring me in here? It smells like a petting zoo.",
        "Cord: Because I didn't want to have to yell at you in front of an audience, Tina.",
        "Tina: Well, that's never stopped you before.",
        "Cord: You think I enjoy doing that kind of thing?",
        "Tina: Well, I don't know. Why do you do it?",
        "Cord: Because you make me crazy, Tina! What are you doing trying to push me off on Brody as his best man?",
        "Tina: Well -- I -- I told you it was for the family. You know, brothers-in- law. I thought you guys could get to know each other.",
        "Cord: Yeah. That's it? That's the only reason?",
        "Tina: Well, of course, that's it. S-scout's honor.",
        "Cord: You were never even a Brownie.",
        "Tina: No, but I could have been. I mean, I really look fabulous in a sash.",
        "Cord: Mm. Tell me the truth. Are you trying to use Natalie and Brody's wedding to get us back together?",
        "Tina: Would it really be so bad?",
        "Cord: We can't. We can't.",
        "Tina: Cord, I know you want me, and I want you, so why fight this?",
        "Cord: Because, Tina, this -- this is trouble.",
        "Tina: But we thrive on trouble. We always have.",
        "Cord: No, Tina, you thrive on trouble, all right? I never did.",
        "Tina: Cordero Roberts, you are the world's worst liar. And you know how I know that? Because I'm the world's best. Except... when it comes to you. You always see right through me. So look in my eyes, all right? Just look in my eyes and tell me that I'm lying when I say we can make this work. Tell me I'm lying when I say we belong together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Go ahead on upstairs. I'll be up in a second. And no candy, okay? I have to check it first. Go ahead.",
        "Ford: Night. Thank you for letting me tag along tonight.",
        "Jessica: Well, thanks for coming. Who knows what would have happened if you hadn't been there?",
        "Ford: What's the worst that could have happened? You'd tell the truth?",
        "Jessica: And destroy Natalie and Brody's family in the process. I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.",
        "Ford: Well, if you ever need to talk about it again, you know how to reach me. Oh, and, uh, tell your mom I will drop off the shoe tomorrow.",
        "Jessica: \"The Man With One Red Shoe.\" That's Tom Hanks, right? The one about the guy who everybody thinks is important.",
        "Ford: But he's just your average Joe.",
        "Jessica: Until his love interest realizes that he has the potential to be a lot more.",
        "Ford: Good memory.",
        "Jessica: Keep the shoe. It suits you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I'd like to make a toast. Thank you.",
        "Aubrey: Thanks.",
        "Rex: First, to Aubrey Wentworth for putting together this fantastic party. Thank you.",
        "[All cheering]",
        "Rex: And, next, to my sister and future brother-in-law. Natalie and Brody, I'm glad you guys found each other. And I know if you always put your family first, you will always be happy. So hold on tight and don't let go. Congratulations!",
        "[All cheering]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I, uh, I'm going to, uh, check on the boys.",
        "Clint: All right. I'm gonna clean up this mail. You didn't sort through this earlier, did you?",
        "Viki: No. Why?",
        "Clint: Well, I'm looking for a letter that was addressed to me. I swear it was here. Now it's gone.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Stacy: Tell me the truth, Cutter. What kind of game are you playing with me? Answer me.",
        "Cutter: Look, I'll tell you everything. I'll explain it all, okay? But right now what we need to do is leave before someone sees you.",

        "Blair: What is the matter with you?",
        "Todd: I, uh... [Clears throat] I was just playing around.",
        "Blair: Well, it looks like you were about to throw that pumpkin.",
        "Sam: My pumpkin?",
        "Todd: No, I wouldn't do that, Sam. I'm your friend, right? A good friend wouldn't do something like that. Right?",
        "Sam: Right.",
        "Blair: Okay, well, now that we've got all of that settled, let's go trick-or- treating.",

        "Todd: Well, 'cause it's like -- well, I got plans.",
        "Blair: Are you all right?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Sam, I'll make it up to you. I'll take you next year, all right?",

        "Todd: Yeah. I promise.",
        "Blair: Okay. Come on.",
        "Irene: Good call, son. You're better off without her. More time for me."
