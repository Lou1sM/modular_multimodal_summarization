        "Tina wants to get back with Cord. He reveals he would like that also but has trust issues with her and doesnt' want to get his heart broken again. She tells him she is committed to showing him she's a better person and is there for him and Viki and not just in it for the money or schemes anymore. Cutter is plotting his plan to prevent Kim from contacting Clint. Clint however, knows something is \"not right\" and Kim has not disappeared on him after attempting to use him for his money then finding out he's not rich, as Nigel suggests. And he knows there is something \"signficant\" about Kim's friend in the private Kentucky hospital. Meanwhile, Cutter works on Gigi/Stacy who demands he tells her the truth. he tells her that she is Stacy, a con artist just as capable of wrong doing as he is. She is in love with Rex. He wants her to be with the man she loves and she needs to trust him. Viki can see that Todd intends to get Blair back although he has the deep dark secret where Irene's ghost has convinced him that he killed Victor. Starr tells Blair something similar about her mom getting back with her dad. But she's not certain whether to move forward with Tomas or get back with Todd. Rex somehow knows there is something significant about the unidentified woman with the mask who crashed his Halloween party with Cutter. And he goes to find her after Cutter has left. Little does he know who she is (or who she looks exactly like)."

        "Starr: What's that?",
        "Blair: Nothing.",
        "Starr: Oh? Is that... yes, it is. The happiest day of your life. At least, that's what you told me.",
        "Blair: Well, too bad you can't live in a picture or a portrait. I mean, who knows. Do you think that's what Tom\u00e1s loves? The idea or image of me?",
        "Starr: Mom?",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm?",
        "Starr: Did Tom\u00e1s tell you he's in love with you?",
        "Blair: Yeah, he did.",
        "Starr: What about Dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: What are you doing?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Painting.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, I can see that. Why?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Therapy. It's what I do. It's time to get back to it. I need a fresh start.",
        "T\u00e9a: Painting Blair. What's going on with you two, Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: She's furious with me. I would have left her and gone to jail for a crime I didn't commit.",
        "T\u00e9a: She can get over that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I think it's about Todd. Maybe she's still in love with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Your father and I have been over for a very long time.",
        "Starr: Oh, is that why he came over last night? Sam told me.",
        "Blair: Actually, he came over to see you and Hope, but you had already taken her out trick-or-treating.",
        "Starr: Sure he did. Is that why he stayed later, Mom? That was just an excuse.",
        "Blair: What, you don't think he wanted to see his granddaughter?",
        "Starr: I'm sure, but that does not change the fact that he is still in love with you.",
        "Blair: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Good morning. I didn't know if you came home last night. So, how did it go with Blair?",
        "Todd: It went.",
        "Viki: Oh. So, good. Did you tell her how you feel?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Viki: That's a shame. You seemed so determined. Why didn't you tell her?",
        "Todd: You take my life, Victor? I take yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nigel: Sir, your private investigator called and left a message. He says he's unable to locate Kimberly Andrews. He thinks perhaps she's using an alias, which is highly likely.",
        "Clint: Anything else?",
        "Nigel: He wants to know if you'd like him to continue looking. If so, he needs more money. Sir, at the risk of overstepping, I strongly recommend you tell the investigator his services are no longer required.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: What's the problem?",
        "Man: The horses are real spooked. I think there's somebody inside.",
        "Rex: I bet I know who. Wait here. If I'm not back in five minutes, call the cops. Hey! Wentworth, come out! I know it's you! You're trespassing! You know, after what you pulled last night, I'd be more than happy to gut you like a fish. Come out or I swear to God I'm gonna take this pitchfork and shove it -- I can't believe it's you. You're really here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paper rustling]",
        "Cutter: \"Dear Clint, I'm so sorry I couldn't call. My brother, Cutter, set me up on a phony murder charge.\" Mm. That's true. \"Can't get to you or my friend. Need you to know it's Stacy Morasco. She didn't drown. Changed her face to look like Gigi.\" Oh. [Chuckles] Wow, sis. Way not to hold back. Good thing I intercepted this thing. I could be in a lot of trouble.",
        "Stacy: You are in trouble. I kept my mouth shut last night. But if you don't tell me the whole truth now, I am going straight to Rex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Sorry about that.",
        "Cord: Uh, no. Actually, I think we're the ones who are sorry.",
        "Rex: No. No. It's okay.",
        "Tina: No. No. Really. We didn't mean to --",
        "Rex: No, not hearing it. Uh, just the ho-- the horses got spooked from, uh, strange noises. So...remember that.",
        "Tina: Did you see that? Your brother nearly killed us.",
        "Cord: Just relax. I-I think everything is fine now.",
        "Tina: \"Fine\"? Is that the best you could do? No, I think it was fantastic. It was wonderful. It was marvelous. Who should we tell?",
        "Cord: Uh, tell?",
        "Tina: Yeah, I-I think we should start with Viki and then, you know, we can kind of work our way to Clint.",
        "Cord: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait. What exactly do you want to tell Viki and my pa about...this?",
        "Tina: Well, not about this. I mean, I don't think we need to give him any details, do you?",
        "Cord: Uh, no. T-then what do you want to tell them?",
        "Tina: Well, that we're back together again! I mean, at first, they're gonna be very skeptical, especially Clint. But once they see that this forever, this is gonna be wonderful. What?",
        "Cord: Look, uh, about last night...",
        "Tina: I know. It was wonderful, wasn't it? What? What's wrong?",
        "Cord: Listen, just -- just because we made love, it doesn't mean that we're back together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: Hey.",
        "Rex: Hey. I almost pitchforked a naked couple just now hiding in the stables. I thought it was Cutter.",
        "Aubrey: I'm sorry about that. He never should have gotten through the front door.",
        "Rex: It was not your fault.",
        "Aubrey: Yes, it was. I was in charge of the party. I should have been more on top of it.",
        "Rex: Well, if the guy was wrapped in a mummy costume, I'm glad you could see him at all.",
        "Aubrey: At least all the craziness happened in the stable and didn't ruin the party for everyone else.",
        "Rex: Shane didn't seem too upset. That's the main thing.",
        "Aubrey: He was okay this morning?",
        "Rex: He didn't even mention the woman. But to think how close she came. And what if she had said, \"Shane, I'm your mom\"?",
        "Aubrey: How are they gonna pull that off, anyway? I mean, obviously, you would see that she doesn't look like Gigi or sound like her.",
        "Rex: Still, for somebody to do that to Shane...",
        "Aubrey: I know. I was so furious with Cutter. I wanted to strangle him with those mummy rags.",
        "Rex: Well, the guy's a total jerk. I get he doesn't care who he hurts. But what about that woman?",
        "Aubrey: What about her?",
        "Rex: Well, she has to have known how much Shane misses his mom. W-w-what kind of woman does that to a grieving kid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: Last chance, Cutter. You tell me what's going on with Rex, or I'll ask him myself.",
        "Cutter: You know.",
        "Stacy: You said we went to that party to jog my memory, that -- that I would see Rex and remember and that's all!",
        "Cutter: Exactly.",
        "Stacy: Bull! I heard what Aubrey said!",
        "Cutter: Aubrey -- Aubrey's my ex-girlfriend. She's jealous.",
        "Aubrey: Oh, she didn't sound like she missed you all that much! I should have known!",
        "Cutter: Okay. All right. Settle down.",
        "Stacy: No! You weren't helping me! You just have some plan that you want to use me for. Well, you can forget it!",
        "Cutter: Hear me out, okay?",
        "Stacy: I've heard enough!",
        "Cutter: Not from me. Now you're gonna hear the truth. All of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: So, Kimberly Andrews is still your favorite, huh? Nigel, I know how you feel about her, but she came here because she was in trouble and she needed -- she needed help for her sick friend. But when I got that help, she just disappeared.",
        "Nigel: [Sighs]",
        "Clint: Without any money.",
        "Nigel: It was very wise of you to offer the services of the hospital instead of cash.",
        "Clint: About all I could do.",
        "Nigel: Indeed. Sir, I thought Rex Balsom looked into this matter for you already.",
        "Clint: He did, but, uh, they gave him the runaround at that hospital in Kentucky.",
        "Nigel: Because the stripper friend in question had already checked out of the hospital.",
        "Clint: Spit it out, Nigel. I know you're dying to.",
        "Nigel: Sir. It seems obvious that Miss Kimberly's friend couldn't have been that sick in the first place. This was patently a ruse to try and extract money from you. And when Miss Kimberly discovered you were no longer wealthy...",
        "Clint: She abandoned the ship, huh?",
        "Nigel: It pains me to say it, sir, but I believe, as the young people say, she's just not that...into you.",
        "Clint: Nigel, are you watching those reality shows again?",
        "Nigel: You deserve someone whose affections are genuine and not dependent on outside factors. In my humble opinion, you should forget about Kimberly...sir.",
        "Clint: You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: No, I did not tell Blair how I feel. What? It wasn't the right time.",
        "Viki: Well, I mean, I know it's not an easy thing to do. That's -- I guess that's why I was so glad that you were determined to try.",
        "Todd: Wow. That's the last time I ever tell you what my plans are.",
        "Viki: [Chuckles] Okay, well, I mean, what happened? Why didn't you tell her?",
        "Todd: Someone scared me.",
        "Viki: Who?",
        "Todd: Sam.",
        "Viki: [Chuckling] Sam? You were scared of a little boy?",
        "Todd: You should have seen his costume.",
        "Viki: You sure it wasn't someone else? Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Todd: [Scoffs] No. I -- [Chuckles] I was not even thinking about Tom\u00e1s.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Anyway, I don't want to talk about me. What's wrong?",
        "T\u00e9a: Nothing. Nothing. I'm on a roll. I've been packing up Victor's things, you know. Uh...",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Pajarito...",
        "T\u00e9a: 'Cause it was time, you know. I've been putting it off, so I just woke up this morning, and I did it. I took all of Victor's clothes out of our closet. It's all this empty space now. Um, but the boxes are upstairs. I called this char-- oh, Victor has the most beautiful suits, you know, so I-I called this charity that gives business clothes to people looking for jobs, and -- but that was the easy part, the clothes. Then there was the stuff on the dresser. He has this -- this, um, this golden pen that Sam used to love to play with that, you know, the clicker, so -- and the -- the Jack goes to -- the watch goes to Jack, and Starr gets a lot of the other things. T-they're all upstairs in the box, but most --",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You did good, hermanita. Please, you do not have to do this alone. I'm here. Just let me help you.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, t-that's okay.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No, it's not okay. Please. I'm here. Just let me be a good brother for once. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: It has been obvious from the minute Dad came back to town.",
        "Blair: You're seeing things.",
        "Starr: Yeah, like Dad kissing you in front of everyone at the movie premiere.",
        "Blair: That was all for show, Starr. He was trying to prove that he was the real Todd Manning.",
        "Starr: Okay. Who did he call, huh, when he got shot and he needed help?",
        "Blair: The biggest sucker he knows.",
        "Starr: No, the person he trusted the most, and you went.",
        "Blair: Well, excuse me if I didn't want to see the father of my children bleed to death.",
        "Starr: And you're positive that's all it was?",
        "Blair: I thought fairy tales were supposed to have happy endings.",
        "Todd: Who says this one's over?",
        "Starr: Something happened. Yes, it did! I can see it in your face!",
        "Blair: No, he was weak. He was babbling. You know how your father gets when he's like that.",
        "Starr: No matter had happened in life, you and Dad have always had a connection -- always. And it's still there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Well, of course we're back together. What are you talking about?",
        "Cord: [Sighs] Look, honey, we've always had chemistry. That's true.",
        "Tina: Oh, no, no. This was much more than just lust.",
        "Cord: Yeah. Yeah, it was.",
        "Tina: Look, why can't you just say it -- that you have never loved anyone as much as you love me?",
        "Cord: That may be true.",
        "Tina: I mean, I can say it -- that I have never loved anyone as much as I've loved you. I mean, and that'll never die.",
        "Cord: Tina, I-I-it doesn't change anything.",
        "Tina: Well, why does it have to change?",
        "Cord: Honey, how many times do we have to go through all of this?",
        "Tina: Cord.",
        "Cord: Every time you tell me to trust you, you pull the ball away, Tina, and I'm the one that ends up lying flat on my back. I'm sorry, Tina. Look. We're -- we're older now, all right? Let's try to be a little wiser. Let's just...not go there again. Do you get it?",
        "Tina: Yeah, I get it. I get it perfectly, that you think I'm good enough to have sex with but not good enough for anything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: You want to know if there was something in it for me? Yeah. Of course, there was, all right? But it was gonna help you, too.",
        "Stacy: What about Rex?",
        "Cutter: Rex! This is probably gonna help him most of all! Stacy, trust me, all right? Y-you love this guy so much. All you wanted to do was be around him and make him happy. When you saw him at the party, when you saw Rex, now, did it spark anything --",
        "Stacy: What was your plan, Cutter? Just tell me what you were going to do!",
        "Cutter: I was gonna let you finish what you started, okay? You wanted to replace Gigi, so I was gonna help you with that.",
        "Stacy: Oh, really? How?!",
        "Cutter: I thought that I'd help Gigi come home to Rex. You guys would live happily ever after for...yeah, for a price.",
        "Stacy: Oh, and you just expected me to let you rip off Rex?",
        "Cutter: Well, you know, I thought that I deserved a little something for my time and my effort and my silence. That's right, Stacy. That's the best part is, I was gonna keep your secret. Nobody would learn the truth from me.",
        "Stacy: [Chuckles] So you were gonna blackmail me.",
        "Cutter: We'd both get what we wanted.",
        "Stacy: You are such a user.",
        "Cutter: Hey, I'm not --",
        "Stacy: A sleazy, disgusting user! So out of here.",
        "Cutter: You're right! Okay? Everything you just said is true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You're not telling me to shut up... or that I'm crazy for thinking there's still something between you and Dad.",
        "Blair: No, I'm not.",
        "Starr: Spill! Tell me what happened now. Tell me!",
        "Blair: Nothing happened. He was here. It felt like maybe he was going to say something.",
        "Starr: That he's still in love with you? Seriously?",
        "Blair: I-I don't know! I don't know! He was here, like I said, and then all of a sudden, he exploded out of here. He came up with some lame excuse, and then he -- he left.",
        "Starr: Well, Dad has been through a lot.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? He was like that way before Irene locked him up. He's always been moody and unpredictable.",
        "Starr: Look at what happened when he came back. I mean, we had replaced him. Think about how -- how that made him feel. Maybe he was afraid that you were gonna reject him, and he took off.",
        "Blair: I -- okay, you know what? That's enough talking about your father, all right?",
        "Starr: And where are you going?",
        "Blair: I'm going over to T\u00e9a's. She said that Victor has a box of stuff for you kids.",
        "Starr: Mom!",
        "Blair: Goodbye!",
        "Starr: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: What is bothering you? I mean, I know it's something.",
        "Todd: It's Sam. He's having a hard time. I mean, he just lost his dad. This is a very confusing time for him.",
        "Viki: I'm sure it is, yeah.",
        "Todd: And he really needs Blair right now.",
        "Viki: But he likes you. You would be a big help to him.",
        "Todd: What? By getting it on with his mom?",
        "Viki: No! By being around. It would be good for him -- and good for Blair.",
        "Todd: No. No. No. I'm the last person that kid needs around. That kid needs his dad! I'm not his dad! I'm the reason his dad his dead!",
        "Viki: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: So, you're admitting you're a lying con artist?",
        "Cutter: Yeah. That's me.",
        "Stacy: Hmm.",
        "Cutter: You don't want to do that.",
        "Stacy: Why?! Why not?! Why shouldn't I go tell Rex right now?",
        "Cutter: Because you're just like me.",
        "Stacy: What?",
        "Cutter: Maybe -- maybe you're better 'cause you did it for love. But that doesn't matter. We're exactly the same.",
        "Stacy: I don't have to listen to this.",
        "Cutter: Gigi -- look what you did to yourself. How many surgeries do you think this took? How -- how -- how many sutures? How many stitches? How many bruises? How much pain? You put yourself through hell so you could look like Gigi. And your plan -- your plan was to take over her life. You and I both know what that means.",
        "Stacy: I didn't do anything.",
        "Cutter: No, you didn't. But you were going to. So, I want you to think about that and then tell me how bad of a guy I am.",
        "Stacy: I have to get away from you!",
        "Cutter: Where? Where? I-I-I-I'm the only in town who's gonna take care of you.",
        "Stacy: Yeah, that's because you want to use me! I have to make this right! Don't you see?",
        "Cutter: Okay. Walk out the door. What are you gonna do? You have no money. You have no friends.",
        "Stacy: I...h-had a friend.",
        "Cutter: You did. And she's long gone. Your best friend couldn't live with what you did. So -- so, what's your plan?",
        "Stacy: Well, you can't use me to take Rex's money.",
        "Cutter: So, you're gonna go to Rex?",
        "Stacy: Yes.",
        "Cutter: You're gonna to go Rex? W-what do you expect to do? You're gonna show up on his doorstep? What are you gonna tell him? Y-you're gonna tell him that you're Stacy? How do you think he's gonna feel you show up on his doorstep with Gigi's face?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aubrey: You want me to get rid of that?",
        "Rex: No, I'm gonna return it.",
        "Aubrey: Rex, what?",
        "Rex: I'm gonna find this woman and ask her what the hell she thinks she's doing.",
        "Aubrey: Don't. You know she'll be with Cutter. He won't let you anywhere near her without a fight.",
        "Rex: Fine by me.",
        "Aubrey: I don't have enough cash to bail you out of jail. Okay? A-and who's gonna take care of Shane if you're in lockup?",
        "Rex: I'm just going to talk to them.",
        "Aubrey: No, you're not. I know you're furious. I get that. But just forget about Cutter and his stupid schemes. Don't let them cost you, too.",
        "Rex: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Aubrey: Move on. Forget about Cutter. Forget about the woman. They're just sick, little cons. And now that you know what they're up to, they can't hurt you. [Sighs]",
        "Rex: What?",
        "Aubrey: I just...heard myself. I wonder how many times someone's thought that way about me, that I'm toxic waste.",
        "Rex: Hang on.",
        "Aubrey: But I am. I was. I'm just as bad as Cutter.",
        "Rex: No, you aren't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cutter: Okay. Let's hear it, Stacy. You go to Rex and you tell him what? What? You want to tell him that you're Stacy?",
        "Stacy: I-I could explain.",
        "Cutter: Explain what, exactly? You can't remember who you are. And what you do remember, it ain't pretty. He'll throw you out. Or he could probably find a way to throw you in jail.",
        "Stacy: No! See, I'm not that person!",
        "Cutter: Okay. So, you don't want to be Stacy anymore.",
        "Stacy: No, I just -- I just can't believe that that was me, that I did all those things!",
        "Cutter: So take a chance on a new life! That's all I want! That's all you've ever wanted! You wanted to be the woman that Rex loved! You wanted to be Gigi, and now you can be -- if we handle this right.",

        "Cord: And I hear you.",
        "Tina: Oh, do you? 'Cause if you did, you'd see that everything is different!",
        "Cord: [Sighs]",
        "Tina: What?",
        "Cord: Look at you. You just charge in to a situation with guns blazing to get what you want. You're still the same, Tina.",

        "Cord: It's just you. That's how you are, Tina. And too many times now, you've [Sighs] You broke my heart that way. I-I-I don't know what to do. How am I ever gonna trust that -- that it's not gonna happen again?",
