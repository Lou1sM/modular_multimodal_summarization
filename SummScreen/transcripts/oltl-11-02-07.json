        "Noelle: You've been here all day, Viki, and it's starting to slow down. I can take it from here.",
        "Viki: Ok. You know what? Um -- Gigi's not here, and I'm not really tired. I'm going to stay a while, ok? Hey, you're back.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, you know, for some reason, I just can't seem to stay away from this place. Hmm.",
        "Noelle: Aren't they just as cute as pie?",
        "Moe: Adorable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Now, remember, girls, there isn't anything we can't handle. Ha. I also need you to always remember that your first impression is your most lasting.",
        "Starr: But we already met Ms. Woodrow.",
        "Langston: Yeah.",
        "Dorian: Honey, please. Now, then, Starr, stand up straight.",
        "Starr: Ahem.",
        "Dorian: Shoulders back. Very good. I love your hair. The outfit is terrific. I wouldn't have chosen jeans, but there's no time to change. And your shoes -- oh, darling, they're fabulous. Langston, you're --",
        "Langston: You can say it. Four-letter word, starts with H, ends in R.",
        "Dorian: That wasn't the four-letter word I was thinking of. Honey, this group home they forced you to live in -- was it filled with demented hair stylists that forced you to put those streaks in your beautiful hair?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Dorian: Ooh.",
        "Langston: Ahem.",
        "Dorian: Ready?",
        "Markko: The cavalry's here.",
        "Langston: Ah.",
        "Markko: Whatever you need, we got you covered.",
        "Langston: Hello.",
        "[Langston giggles]",
        "Dorian: Boys, I'm afraid this isn't a good time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: That's him over there, David Vickers.",
        "David: Cranberry or fresh-squeezed orange juice? Fresh-squeezed orange juice is an extra dollar.",
        "Alex: He works here?",
        "Woman: You didn't know?",
        "Alex: Oh, how the mighty have fallen.",
        "Woman: Fraternization between staff members and clients is against Dreamland policy.",
        "Alex: I'm sure it is. But so is taking bribes. I'll keep it just between us girls.",
        "Woman: Ok.",
        "Alex: Thank you.",
        "David: Alex Olanov.",
        "[Alex giggles]",
        "Alex: David Vickers -- I can't believe it.",

        "Todd: How much longer is this going to take?",
        "Marty: Well, we are about to cross over lake --",
        "Todd: Did I ask you?",
        "Marty: Pontchartrain so --",
        "Todd: How much longer is this going to take?",
        "[John sighs]",
        "John: If you don't can it, you're going to be swimming across the lake.",
        "Todd: What the hell is this place, New Orleans? Why the hell do you think Marcie's there, anyway?",
        "Blair: Because John thinks that she might be there.",
        "Todd: \"There\" where? I mean, if Marcie's there, how do you expect to find her \"there\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I guess this is it. Let's try it, come on. Here we go.",
        "Man: Right on time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Hey, Moe, I persuaded Charlie to try your green chili and chorizo quiche.",
        "Moe: Thank you. I wish you could persuade Gigi to work the rest of her shift.",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. She had to take Shane to the doctor.",
        "Moe: And knowing her, she'll probably take him to ice cream and a movie and forget she ever had a job.",
        "Viki: I'm here. What's the problem?",
        "Moe: If she doesn't show, she's fired.",
        "Viki: Don't you think sometimes Moe takes that irascible thing a little too far?",
        "Noelle: That's just Moe. I'm more interested in how you got a man to eat quiche.",
        "Viki: I told him that no matter how light and fluffy it tasted, it still wasn't good for him.",
        "Noelle: He likes you. His face lights up every time he sees you.",
        "Viki: Noelle, Charlie and I have known each other casually for, like, a whole day. Please, don't turn this into a romance.",
        "Noelle: When you came in here a couple months ago, I said you looked like you were looking for something, and you said I was right.",
        "Viki: I remember that.",
        "Noelle: What if what you were looking for is Charlie?",
        "Viki: Hmm.",

        "Starr: This is it. Do you really think it'll work?",
        "Dorian: Yes, it's got to work. Ok, everybody, positive thinking. Come on.",
        "Starr: Ok, everyone straighten up and --",
        "Dorian: Yep.",
        "Starr: Look --",
        "Langston: Come here. Do I look ok?",
        "Dorian: Gorgeous.",
        "Starr: Zip that up more.",
        "Dorian: Ready? Positive attitude. Hmm? Why, Ms. Woodrow, so good to see you again. Please do come in. And you?",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: This is Mr. Preston, my supervisor.",
        "Dorian: How do you do? So good to meet you, sir.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: This is Dr. Lord. And this is Langston Wilde.",
        "Langston: Hi, it's nice to meet you.",
        "Mr. Preston: Hello.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: And this is Starr Manning, her best friend and the applicant's daughter.",

        "Mr. Preston: Hi.",
        "Cole: And we're good friends of Langston, too. I'm Cole.",
        "Mr. Preston: Cole.",
        "Markko: Hey, \"Markko.\"",
        "Mr. Preston: Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you all. Now, getting down to the matter at hand --",
        "Dorian: Yes, yes, yes, indeed. But let me take your coat first.",
        "Mr. Preston: Ok, thank you.",
        "Dorian: Oh, I cannot thank you enough for expediting this interview. So, shall we all go into the living room? Girls, sofa.",
        "Starr: Yes.",
        "Dorian: Boys over there. Ms. Woodrow, please, won't you have a seat? Mr. Preston \u0096",
        "Mr. Preston: Thank you.",
        "Dorian: Thank you so much. So as I was saying, thank you very, very much for expediting this interview, because we are all anxious for Langston to put her dreadful experiences behind her, and move on with her life.",
        "Starr: With us.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Oh, there's no need to thank us, Dr. Lord. Placing children in loving families \u0096",
        "Mr. Preston: Is our job.",
        "Dorian: Yes, and your Ms. Woodrow has been doing her job just splendidly.",
        "Mr. Preston: Would you please inform Mrs. Manning that we're here, and we can begin the final interview.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: Is there a problem?",
        "Dorian: No. It's just that Mrs. Manning -- um -- is not here.",
        "Mr. Preston: Actually, that is a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Wendell Jonas Freeman, where on earth your manners got to? Come on in here, honey.",
        "Marcie: Hi.",
        "Woman: How you doing, little fella?",
        "Marcie: I'm Penny Shaw, and this is my son, Aaron. Hi.",
        "Wendell: Go on, introduce yourself.",
        "Boy: Wendell Anthony. But everybody just call me junior.",

        "Wendell: Good ears.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Wendell: I'd shake your hand, but I still got to clean up from work.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no, that's ok, I understand. No, honey.",
        "Junior: My dad fixes cars real, real good.",
        "Marcie: Oh, really? That's -- that's -- that's very -- that's great. That's really cool. Junior: He's got his own truck and everything.",
        "Marcie: Oh, well \u0096",
        "Junior: You want to see? It's right out here on the street.",
        "Celia: Don't even use this as an opportunity to dodge your homework, mister. Now, go on back there, and don't come back till you got something to show your daddy and me. Go. Scoot.",
        "Marcie: He's very sweet.",
        "Celia: Got to be firm, though, especially with boys.",
        "Marcie: I -- I know.",
        "Wendell: About a year or two, you'll know what she's talking about.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm. It's already beginning, believe me. You -- you don't know how much I appreciate this. You don't even know us.",
        "Wendell: Well, Celia's brother Clarence says to help you, and that's what we'll do.",
        "Marcie: I know, but I don't want to be any trouble, I really don't.",
        "Wendell: Ain't no guarantees in life. You got to do what you believe is right.",
        "Marcie: Oh, I -- did Clarence tell you --",
        "Wendell: The less we know about your situation, the less we can tell anybody come asking. Now, is that your car on the street?",
        "Marcie: Yes, sir.",
        "Wendell: Well, give me your keys. I'll bring it around back, bring your things in for you.",
        "Marcie: Can you hold him for a second?",
        "Wendell: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marcie: Thank you. Here, the keys are right here.",
        "[Tommy fusses]",
        "Marcie: I'll put them in your pocket. Ok, there you go. It's ok. Thanks.",
        "Wendell: I'll be back shortly.",
        "Marcie: Thank you.",
        "Celia: Come on, girl, sit down. Take a load off.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: Yeah, warren, what's going on? I understand. Hey, listen to me. Thanks, all right? I owe you one.",
        "Todd: You know where they are, don't you? Mr. Preston: I don't understand. If Mrs. Manning was unavailable or needed to reschedule, I'm sure --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well, you see, Mrs. Manning was called out of town for a family emergency, quite suddenly, and of course, that was just before we got the wonderful news that child services was ready to approve her as Langston's foster mother. However, I do have all of the paperwork right here. Yes, indeed. It's signed and notarized. And of course, I am available to answer any initial questions or concerns that you may have",
        "Mr. Preston: That's all well and good, but without the interview, I'm afraid --",
        "Dorian: Well, couldn't you make this one exception and schedule the interview at a later date?",
        "Mr. Preston: Well, if Mrs. Manning isn't available, I'd like to speak with her husband.",
        "Dorian: Mr. Manning would love to speak to you.",
        "Mr. Preston: Excellent.",
        "Dorian: However, Mr. Manning had to go out of town with Mrs. Manning to handle this family emergency. But I'm sure the second that it is resolved, I can assure you \u0096",
        "Mr. Preston: Does the husband concur with Mrs. Manning's decision to foster Langston?",
        "Dorian: Concur? He's all for it? Mr. Preston: I can't seem to find his affidavit to that effect.",
        "Dorian: That's because there isn't one. Mr. Preston: No husband and no affidavit?",
        "Dorian: Well, here's the story. Mr. Manning has been out of town for a long -- Mr. Preston: So there is no way to verify that he's even aware of the situation with Langston?",
        "Dorian: Well -- Mr. Preston: If that is the case, then there is no way that I can approve Mrs. Manning's application.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: In all the fantasies I've had about you, you've never been working -- at a job.",
        "David: Did you know that if you work for a living, the federal government takes taxes out of your paycheck?",
        "Alex: Shocking. Why are you doing it?",
        "David: I had an encounter with my conscience.",
        "Alex: Ooh. What was that like?",
        "David: Unpleasant. It was after this thing I had with Viki Davidson.",
        "Alex: Ooh.",
        "David: No, not that kind of thing.",
        "Alex: Oh.",
        "David: The kind of thing that makes you want to be a better man.",
        "Alex: How's that working for you?",
        "David: I massage alcoholic starlets and up charge for orange juice. How do you think it's going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendell: The car is good and hidden, and I put your things in the second bedroom for you.",
        "Marcie: Oh, thank you so much. We don't have much. So we won't be in your way. You know, I -- I only had about five minutes to get everything together, so --",
        "Wendell: Well, we can probably find something for Aaron, huh?",
        "Marcie: No, no, no. Oh, please, don't. Please, you've already done so much for us.",
        "Wendell: We're resourceful.",
        "Celia: Just let us see what we can do. You going to grow up soon and cause your mama all kinds of trouble, isn't that right?",
        "[Marcie and Wendell laugh]",
        "Marcie: Believe me, he's already started it. I will -- I'll put him down for two seconds, I'll turn around -- you know, blink, and he'll be hiding somewhere in the apartment. I won't even know where he is.",
        "Wendell: Smart boy.",
        "Marcie: And very fast.",
        "Celia: Got to enjoy it, honey. They're a gift, nothing less.",
        "Marcie: He's my life. Right? Huh?",
        "Celia: Why don't you put him down in a room and let him get some rest? And I'll go make us all some food.",
        "Marcie: Oh, I -- I'd be glad to help.",
        "Celia: Go on, scoot, and do what I told you.",
        "Marcie: Ok, ok, but I am making breakfast. I'm making breakfast tomorrow morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: John, do you know where they are?",
        "Blair: Was that your F.B.I. contact?",
        "John: Ramsey suspects warren of leaking information to us.",
        "Marty: Well, does Ramsey have proof?",
        "John: He knows we're up to something. I can't let warren jeopardize his job over this.",
        "Todd: Oh, no. No, don't let warren jeopardize his job. It's just my son's life at stake here, and what's that compared to a man's pension?",
        "Blair: Hey, come on. What does that mean for us, John?",
        "John: It means after this one last favor, warren's out.",
        "Todd: What favor?",
        "John: I asked warren to run background checks on all the employees at -- at faces in Decatur. It turns out one of them has family in New Orleans.",
        "Marty: And that means --",
        "John: I overheard the club owner talking to someone on the phone back in the jail, and he told that person that by the time the agents got back and tossed the club, Marcie would be in the big easy.",
        "Todd: You had a lead and didn't tell me? What else have you been keeping from me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You know, Noelle, what you were talking about? Um -- I'm not sure that I want the answer to what I'm looking for to be a man.",
        "Noelle: What else is there besides being with somebody?",
        "Viki: Oh, honey, there's so much more. There's things like, you know, living among friendly people, and going home at the end of the day to a nice room that you pay for with money you earn from a job you really enjoy. Stuff like that, you know?",
        "Noelle: Maybe. But I just think --",
        "[Bell rings]",
        "Noelle: We're not deaf, Moe.",
        "Moe: Here you go.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Jeez.",
        "Moe: Stop filling Viki's head with all that romance talk.",
        "Noelle: I just said I thought --",
        "Moe: I don't want her walking around with her head in the clouds the way you do.",
        "Viki: Hope you like it.",
        "Charlie: Well, you haven't steered me wrong yet. Um --",
        "Viki: You should probably eat it while it's hot.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I just want to finish this one thing, and then -- yeah -- I promise, I'll clean my plate.",
        "Viki: What \u0096 what's that project you're working on? You never did tell me.",
        "Charlie: Uh -- I know.",
        "Viki: Ooh. Sorry. I didn't realize it was a mystery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You were in lockup. Telling you would just -- would have made you nuttier than you already are.",
        "Todd: You think?",
        "Blair: Well, do you think that this agent Ramsey got the same lead as the one you got from your friend?",
        "John: He didn't overhear what I overheard in jail. You know, even if he does do background checks on the employees, he won't know what he's looking for.",
        "Marty: So we should be ahead of him, right?",
        "John: Unless somebody spots Marcie, Ramsey shouldn't know she's headed to New Orleans.",
        "Todd: Ha, ha, we got her!",
        "John: Maybe.",
        "Todd: What do you mean, maybe?",
        "John: If Marcie gets to New Orleans, if the family takes her in, if they're still at the same address that we have on file then yeah, maybe we're getting closer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Dear Lord, we thank you for the food on this table, the roof over our heads, and the love in our hearts. Please continue to give us the strength to face whatever tomorrow may bring. We give special thanks for this chance to give help and comfort to this woman and her child. We ask that you keep watching over them, keeping them safe. In Jesus' name, amen. Warren, Marcie, and junior: Amen.",
        "Wendell: We don't stand on ceremony. Just dig in.",
        "Marcie: Ok. Looks delicious.",
        "Celia: It ain't much, but thank you.",
        "Wendell: Can you pass the butter, please?",
        "Marcie: Oh, yeah, of course. Here you go.",
        "Wendell: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: You know, I think I'm going to go check on my son for a second. Junior: He woke up and said \"da-da.\" Then he conked right back out.",
        "Marcie: Yeah -- if it's ok --",
        "Celia: He's fine, honey. You'd hear him if he wasn't. Now, go on. Eat your food.",
        "Marcie: Yes, ma'am. Um -- I noticed on my way up here that, you know, you could still see a lot of damage from the hurricane.",
        "Wendell: There's still a lot to get done.",
        "Marcie: You know, you see news reports all the time, but it's nothing like seeing it for real.",
        "Wendell: Nothing compared to living through it.",
        "Marcie: Looks like you guys were relatively lucky.",
        "[Wendell puts fork down]",
        "Marcie: Did -- did I say something wrong?",
        "Celia: No, honey. It's just -- this ain't our house. That's gone. We pretty much lost everything we had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: So? Tell me your whole story.",
        "David: Last time I left Llanview, I had a bit of egg on my face.",
        "Alex: Because of Viki?",
        "David: Yeah.",
        "Alex: When I first saw you here, I thought you were here because you had an addiction.",
        "David: I came here addiction-free. This place makes me want to develop one, that's for sure.",
        "Alex: I'm sorry, this tastes a little odd.",
        "David: It, unlike myself, is a virgin.",
        "Alex: Hmm.",
        "David: Come on, Alex. What are you expecting? This is rehab.",
        "Alex: Well, how do you stand it?",
        "David: I made a big mistake with Viki. It's a long story. Interesting plot twists, but ultimately not worth retelling. But after I made that big mistake, I got this grand idea that I would show her I was capable of change.",
        "Alex: Oh, can't you do that without working at a job for 7.50 an hour?",
        "David: My original plan was to come here as a client.",
        "Alex: But you don't have an addiction.",
        "David: Alex, what rock did you crawl out from under? There's \"rehab\" rehab, and there's P.R. rehab. I planned on being in the second category. I mean, the food here is great. The massages are even better, and I can bask poolside while I change my image.",
        "Alex: So why didn't you do that?",
        "David: You don't like to talk about money, right?",
        "Alex: I'll force myself.",
        "David: You know how you're new money? Well, I'm \"had-money, gave-money-back- to-impress-girl, now-got-no-money.\" If that was too many hyphens, it means that I'm flat broke. Nigel's voice: Mr. Buchanan has another son. It's David Vickers.",
        "David: So, enough about me. What are you doing here?",
        "Alex: Category one rehab.",
        "David: Oh, nothing wrong with the classic variety. Tell me about that monkey on your back. What is it? Drugs? Alcohol? Botox?",
        "Alex: Sex.",

        "Mrs. Woodrow: If we expedited this process, it was because we were receiving constant pressure from you.",
        "Dorian: Well, that's because it's of paramount importance that Langston be removed from that transient environment into a stable and loving home.",
        "Mrs. Woodrow: We understand that.",
