        "While on the flight to find Dani in London before Ross, Tea confesses to Elijah that Ross is not her father's daughter. Todd Manning is. They both know that both men will be furious with her for that. While Dani and Matthew are talking about their similar situations and how they can escape from the boarding school, she can somehow \"sense\" her father's presence while Ross breaks in, demands they let him see his daughter but gets removed from the boarding school. Bo and Nora admit that they have always been in love even though she is married to Clint and he has never forgiven her for her past indiscretion. Back in Llanview, Rachel admits to Shaun that she does not love him. Greg is the man she has \"feelings\" for. Fish admits to the anti gay protesters that he is gay and proud of it. Kyle then admits he cannot go through with marrying Nick when he only loves Fish. Dorian is ready to marry Amelia. David views them from the television and is devastated."

I want to welcome all of you to this celebration of love and commitment. I know that it's the first time that many of you have been to a ceremony like this, but at its heart, it's as simple as it is profound.

Even when they feel betrayed and lost, even when it feels futile, love has a way or reigniting and reanimating our lives, of surfacing at a time when we least expect it, especially in people who only needed a chance to show you you could shine. Love is our pulse, our breath, and no matter who you find yourselves in love with, it's always a gift, so cherish and celebrate your love as couples and as partners for life.
