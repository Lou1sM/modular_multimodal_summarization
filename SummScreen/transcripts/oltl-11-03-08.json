        "John: How's it hanging, Keys?",
        "Keys: Detective McBain. What are you, on vacation?",
        "John: I don't take vacations. My whole life's been one big vacation.",
        "Keys: What brings you to paradise?",
        "John: She does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Why are you showing me this? I mean, who are they? Do I know them?",
        "Starr: Okay, okay.",
        "Cole: I called your mom; she's going to call Marcie, all right?",
        "Starr: Cole, I know. I was there when you did it.",
        "Cole: Okay, I just don't want you to be afraid. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Starr: I was scared about your driving.",
        "Cole: I just didn't think you'd want to have the baby at my mom's grave, that's all.",
        "Starr: I just think you didn't want to be one to deliver the baby -- ah!",
        "Cole: What? Whoa, was that a contraction? We need some help over here. She's having a baby!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Cain, you're here. And you brought David Vickers.",
        "Cain: And you brought the jewels.",
        "Tina: There you are, my sweetheart. Oh, I'm so excited. Oh, I'm so excited. Come here, come on. There we go. Come here, sweetheart. Come here. Oh my goodness, it's you! Oh, oh, oh. Who are you? You're not David Vickers.",
        "Cain: It's not?",
        "Tina: You son of a bitch. What are you trying to pull?",
        "Cain: I just wanted you to know what it felt like to have something fake passed off as the real thing, like you did with the crown jewels.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: Jessica? Are you all right?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Hi, Charlie. How are you?",
        "Charlie: I'm good. And you? I mean, you just didn't look that good.",
        "Tess: No, I'm fine. You know, I'm tired. Second time around, and pregnant. Still pregnant, huh?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well we're glad you're here. I mean, your mother's been looking for you. She's worried about you.",
        "Tess: Well, you know her, she's always worrying. So what are you doing here? I mean, so you guys are back together again?",
        "Charlie: Oh, well -- I don't know about that. You know, your mom's upstairs, and she's going to be so relieved to see you. I'm going to go get her.",
        "Tess: No. Charlie, wait. I need to speak to you alone, first.",
        "Charlie: Jessica, are you all right?",
        "Tess: [As Jessica] Yeah, um -- yeah. Before I talk to my mom, I need your help.",
        "Charlie: I don't understand.",
        "Tess: I've been having blackouts. You know, losing time? You know about my alter, yes?",
        "Charlie: Yeah, your mother told me.",
        "Tess: Good, good. You know, before I go and speak with her and get help, I -- she's been through so much, you know. I just need to make sure that you're going to be there for her to lean on.",
        "Charlie: You don't have to worry about that, I'm going to give her all the help she needs.",
        "Tess: Good. Yeah, she's been through so much. I don't want her to go through this alone.",
        "Charlie: She won't. I'm going to go get her, she's upstairs.",
        "Tess: Sorry, Charlie. The clock, or more accurately, dynamite is ticking and I don't want to be here when it -- ow! God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cain: Oh, good dog, Cord. In you go.",
        "Tina: Cord?",
        "Cain: Cord Roberts. Saw him at the pound, licking himself. The name just came to me.",
        "Tina: You are incredibly cruel, just playing with my emotions like this.",
        "Cain: Yeah, well you were playing with my nest egg, princess. That's even worse. So, now, give me the jewels.",
        "Tina: No, no, no. Not until you give me David Vickers, the real David Vickers, back in my arms.",
        "Cain: How do you know he's even up for the trip?",
        "Tina: What?",
        "Cain: Maybe I gave him a little potato chip with dip.",
        "Tina: No.",
        "Cain: Yeah, well you tried to poison me with onion dip, didn't you?",
        "Tina: Well, you were threatening me with a sledge hammer.",
        "Cain: Well, at least it was direct. An act of passion, okay? Poisoning dip is sneaky. You know how I felt when I found out what you did? Betrayal is not too strong a word.",
        "Tina: Well, I didn't even make that dip. Tess did.",
        "Cain: Who the hell's Tess?",
        "Tina: Jess under stress is Tess, all right? Look, I want my dog back, all right? So just get me my dog. Just get him right now.",
        "Cain: I want the jewels.",
        "Tina: No. And if you come near me one more time, I am going to scream. Because this park is filled with trick-or-treaters. And cops.",
        "Cain: Well, then. It looks as if we're at an impasse, doesn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keys: She's cute. Friend of yours?",
        "John: You don't recognize her?",
        "Keys: I can't really say I do. She's not really my type.",
        "John: Ladies, you want to give us a minute here? Thanks.",
        "John: It's nice down here. So you're telling me you don't recognize the woman you moved from Ramsey's apartment? The woman behind the door at Manning's who you tried to keep me from? And then after I questioned you, Manning set you up down here with a condo, expense account, salary. I've got the paper trail; I know he's bankrolling you.",
        "Keys: What can I say? The man likes my work. He's got me on retainer, in case he needs me again. That's not against the law, is it, McBain?",
        "John: No. But aiding and abetting a kidnapping is. So is false imprisonment.",
        "Keys: Look, I don't know anything about a kidnapping, or that lady. I do know you're blocking my sun, so unless you got a warrant, get off my property.",
        "John: Keys, I was hoping we could do this the easy way.",
        "Keys: Get off!",
        "John: Listen to me. Listen to me good. The woman in the picture, you tell me about her. Tell me about her now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You're not going to tell me who they are?",
        "Todd: That's my daughter, Starr.",
        "Marty: Ah. I gathered, she's beautiful. Is that --",
        "Todd: That's the baby's father.",
        "Marty: Cole?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Marty: You said he got rough with your daughter.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know what I said.",
        "Marty: Well, then why are you showing me his picture?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: We were at the cemetery when my water broke.",
        "Michael: Did Dr. Joplin show you how to check it?",
        "Starr: Yes, it was clear.",
        "Michael: Good, that's great.",
        "Starr: So is the baby coming soon?",
        "Michael: Well, blood pressure's lower than mine. Have you started having contractions yet?",
        "Starr: Uh, yeah. When we first got here, and Cole started screaming.",
        "Cole: Okay, so I overreacted.",
        "Michael: Since it's your first baby, and you've only had one mild contraction --",
        "Starr: Mild?",
        "Michael: It's an early labor contraction. I think we got a little time. I'm going to page Dr. Joplin, and then once she's done examining you, she'll probably be able to give you a more specific time of when we can expect to meet this baby. Did you call your mom?",
        "Cole: I did. She and Mrs. -- Your wife are on their way over.",
        "Michael: Good. Get some rest, you've got a lot of work ahead of you.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Starr: Wow. Okay, so this is it.",
        "Cole: I guess so. You okay?",
        "Starr: A little. I'm a little better now. But I'm kind of scared of what's to come.",
        "Cole: Would you like me to stay with you?",
        "Starr: Only if you want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I just wanted you to see what she looked like.",
        "Marty: Yeah, but this is a picture of the two of them together. I mean, after what you said he did to her, I'm surprised you kept this, let alone show it to me. I wasn't singing to Bree.",
        "Todd: Who were you singing to?",
        "Marty: The son I never had.",
        "Todd: Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all. And I was pretty angry when I said he did that to Starr. I just -- I lost it when I found them together.",
        "Marty: Well, any father would.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I was just thinking about her. Her life was ruined, and he was going to get off easy.",
        "Marty: Well, I understand that. But, you know, when you talked about him, it had been months since that night, and you still had a lot of anger in your voice. What made you change your mind now?",
        "Todd: You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Ah! I thought the pain had stopped. Okay. Okay. I got to get out of here. I've got to get out of here before Viki comes back. Okay.",
        "Viki: Bree just did not want to go to sleep. Charlie? Charlie! Charlie? Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Oh, baby. Please settle down, it's too early. Just go back to sleep, okay? Okay, we're going to go pick up Bree from Todd's, and then we're going to get out of this town, okay? Tomorrow morning, we're going to go, and we can order room service breakfast. I can watch the news about how Llanfair blew up and -- ow! Stop, please! Not yet, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I changed your mind about him?",
        "Todd: Yeah, your point of view. You know, Jessica said that she thinks that you're turning me into a softy.",
        "Marty: Uh, no. I can't turn you into anything. Maybe you're just a little more comfortable with -- you know.",
        "Todd: What? What, my feminine side?",
        "Marty: No, you're --",
        "Todd: Don't say that.",
        "Marty: Letting your guard down.",
        "Todd: All right, that's better. I do know that when I'm with you, I don't feel so attacked all the time.",
        "Marty: You really do feel that way? It must have been awful.",
        "Todd: I think it made me see the world in black and white. And I -- well, Starr's boyfriend isn't such a bad guy.",
        "Marty: So why did you tell me he was?",
        "Todd: I hate talking like this.",
        "Marty: I know you do. But that means it's important, right? Tell me, why did you say that?",
        "Todd: He stood up to me. He wasn't afraid of me.",
        "Marty: And you wanted him to be?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I wanted to call the shots. But he wouldn't have it.",
        "Marty: I'm liking this kid more and more.",
        "Todd: You know, I was just trying to protect my daughter.",
        "Marty: As you should. But I think it's great that you don't hate him anymore. It's good for him, it's good for Starr, and it's good for you.",
        "Todd: Maybe. I hate changing.",
        "Marty: I get that.",
        "Todd: There's something else you should know about this kid. I did my best to scare the hell out of him, but he wouldn't dump Starr, even after he found out about the baby.",
        "Marty: Wait a minute, they're still together?",
        "Todd: Mm-mm.",
        "Marty: Well, why not?",
        "Todd: Oh, they disagreed about the baby. He wanted to keep it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Yeah, I would like to stay. But I was such a jerk about the adoption, I could see if you want me to go.",
        "Starr: You were not a jerk, Cole. You love this baby, and you wanted us all to be a family. And no, I don't want to be alone, not even for a minute.",
        "Cole: Okay. I'll try not to freak out like I did before.",
        "Starr: Actually, your freaking out kind of calmed me down.",
        "Cole: How could screaming \"she's having a baby\" calm you down?",
        "Starr: Because I knew you wouldn't let anything bad happen to me. Before, when I went into false labor, I was really scared. But with you here, I'm okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I thought you said the reason Starr wanted to give up the baby was that she was alone.",
        "Todd: No, he changed his mind. Signed away his rights, said it was up to her.",
        "Marty: And she wanted to give the baby to you. Says a lot about the kind of dad you are.",
        "Todd: Oh, I don't know about that.",
        "Marty: I do. So does Starr. Gosh, she loves you very much.",
        "Todd: I don't know. She loves him.",
        "Marty: Cole?",
        "Todd: Yeah. And he loves her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Just so we're clear, there's no way you're going to be there in the delivery room.",
        "Cole: Darn it. You know, guys really like that kind of thing, too.",
        "Starr: Okay, well, guys have a choice. I don't.",
        "Cole: Hey, you're going to do great. You do everything great.",
        "Blair: Starr?",
        "Starr: Well, if it isn't granny Blair.",
        "Blair: Now, that's not funny. I have to be nice to you, because you're having a baby. Hi, Cole. Are you okay, sweetheart?",
        "Starr: Yeah. My water broke, I had one contraction. It was kind of an attention grabber.",
        "Blair: Was Cole with you?",
        "Starr: Yeah, he brought me here to the hospital.",
        "Blair: Was he giving you a hard time about the baby? Because I can get him to leave, okay? Are you sure?",
        "Starr: No, no. He's being great. I want him here.",
        "Marcie: Am I late? Are you okay?",
        "Starr: Oh, I'm good, Marcie. Dr. Joplin's on her way.",
        "Marcie: Good. Oh! Cole, nice to see you.",
        "Joplin: So Dr. McBain tells me your water broke.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it was really freaky, wasn't it?",
        "Cole: Yeah, a little. Joplin: Are you the baby's father?",
        "Cole: Yes, ma'am. Cole Thornhart, nice to meet you.",
        "Joplin: Well, I don't get to see boyfriends of teenage mothers show up for the delivery very often.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'm not her boyfriend, just her friend.",
        "Joplin: Ah. Well, friend, I'm getting ready to examine Starr. So, if you'd like to wait in the lounge --",
        "Cole: Yeah. That sounds like a good idea.",
        "Joplin: All right.",
        "Cole: I'll see you later, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Joplin: Okay. Let's see how eager this baby is to make an appearance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Well, they love each other. I hope someday the baby has a chance of knowing them. I wouldn't mind that, either.",
        "Todd: No, we can't think about that now, because we gotta get this baby and get as far away from John McBain as we can so he can't find us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on, Keys. Let's start with what she was doing at Ramsey's in the first place?",
        "Keys: You know what, McBain? Screw yourself.",
        "John: Wrong answer, chief. Let's see how oxygen dependent you really are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Of course we're at an impasse. Because you are horrible. You're stubborn, you're cruel to animals, and you're just plain mean.",
        "Cain: Huh. And you're not, huh?",
        "Tina: No, I am in agony. Because I don't know how my baby is, and you're taunting me.",
        "Cain: Your feelings for that mutt are very moving.",
        "Tina: He is not a mutt.",
        "Cain: If you'd just showed half the feelings for me as you did for that dog --",
        "Tina: Wait. Are you actually jealous of David Vickers?",
        "Cain: As if.",
        "Tina: Well, maybe you should be. Because you know what? He is twice the man that you are.",
        "Cain: Let me tell you something about that dog, okay? He follows me around. He cuddles up with me in bed.",
        "Tina: No!",
        "Cain: Yes, he would go with anyone who could work a can opener. And I would do anything for you.",
        "Tina: Oh yeah, anything. What, like take all the jewels and parachute out of an airplane, just so you could keep the jewels to yourself.",
        "Cain: They were fake jewels. And you were trying to cut me out of the deal from the word \"go,\" weren't you?",
        "Tina: Well, you didn't know that.",
        "Cain: But you did. After everything we've been through...",
        "Tina: But that was just a test to see if I could trust you. And, oh, boy, did you fail that one.",
        "Cain: I was planning a life for us. I was going to make you the center of my world, Tina.",
        "Tina: Oh, yeah. And I'm supposed to believe that one?",
        "Cain: True. Until you called me Cord.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I'm glad you told me all of this.",
        "Todd: You don't seem very happy about it.",
        "Marty: I just don't know why you did it now. I told you how I want to find out about this little boy that I keep seeing or remembering, and you show me this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joplin: Everything looks great. The baby's nicely positioned, the heartbeat is nice and strong, and all your vitals are good.",
        "Starr: Okay, so how much longer do we have?",
        "Joplin: Well, you're only partially effaced, and you've got a couple of centimeters dilated. It's going to be a while.",
        "Starr: I thought that once your water breaks, like, you have the baby.",
        "Joplin: Uh, it's going to happen. But you've just started dilating, and you haven't had your second contraction yet. You know, at your age, I'd feel better if I had you admitted.",
        "Blair: You know what? I'd feel better, too.",
        "Joplin: Okay. So from here on out, liquids only for you. Okay? I'm going to go start the paperwork, get you admitted.",
        "Starr: Mom.",
        "Blair: What? Oh, okay, okay. Starr, it's all right. Just breathe. Do what Wendy said to. No noise, just breathe. Breathe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Cole, if it means anything to you, man, I've seen guys a lot older than you flip out a lot worse than that.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I just don't like thinking about her hurting.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I know. But you know what? She's going to be fine. She's got her mom in there, and Marcie. What, what's wrong?",
        "Cole: No, I was just thinking about my dad. I lost my dad, and now, my kid won't even have one.",
        "Michael: Yeah, right.",
        "Cole: I mean, I know that Marcie's going to be great, even if she's by herself. Listen, Dr. McBain, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.",
        "Michael: No, no. No, it's okay. Look, Starr's going to be fine. The baby's going to be fine. Ain't nothing to worry about.",
        "Cole: You really think that?",
        "Michael: Sure. Why, what're you worried about?",
        "Cole: You really think Starr's dad is not going to try to wreck it all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I get the feeling you haven't told me everything.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Todd: Hold on. It's Jessica, I'd better take it. Hey!",
        "Tess: Yeah, um, I'm coming over to pick up Bree.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm glad you called; there's been a change of plans.",
        "Tess: Oh, oh...",
        "Todd: Are you all right?",
        "Tess: I'm going to be fine. You know, maybe you should hang onto her for a little while, okay?",
        "Todd: Yeah, well, that's the thing.",
        "Tess: Thanks for taking care of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Charlie, I need you to wake up. Charlie, wake up.",
        "Charlie: Oh.",
        "Viki: Charlie, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Ow! Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Viki: No, no, I'm going to call an ambulance, okay?",
        "Charlie: No, no, no. Jessica was here.",
        "Viki: She was?",
        "Charlie: Yes, but... it was Tess.",
        "Viki: Did she do that to you?",
        "Charlie: Yeah.",
        "Viki: Oh, my God. Did she leave?",
        "Charlie: I think so.",
        "Viki: Charlie, did you tell her that we have Bree, and that Bree's not at Todd's?",
        "Charlie: No, I didn't get a chance to.",
        "Viki: Thank God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: She must have hung up. No, straight to voice mail.",
        "Marty: Is something wrong?",
        "Todd: Uh, she said she wants us to keep Bree a little longer.",
        "Marty: But she's at your sister's.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. She hung up before I could tell her. She's probably calling Viki.",
        "Marty: Right. Hey, and before that rings again, are you ever going to tell me why you showed me that picture now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You want to tell me who the woman was at Manning's? It's the woman in the picture, isn't it?",

        "John: Oh, you don't know the half of it, Keys.",
        "Keys: Okay, okay! The woman in the picture, Manning's got her in his house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You really have to see a doctor. You know, you were unconscious.",
        "Charlie: No, I'm okay.",
        "Viki: Here. You know, and you could have a head injury.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, look, why don't we just find out where Jessica is before we call in more people into this?",
        "Viki: I can't believe she did this to you. I'm so sorry.",
        "Charlie: I'm okay, really. I mean -- man, Viki, she played me like a -- like a poker hand.",
        "Viki: What does that mean?",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, it was like she was -- it was like Jessica was -- it was like she was opening up to me and telling me all about her blackouts, and, you know, losses of time. I -- I'm -- it just never occurred to me that she was conning me.",
        "Viki: Well, she's very, very good at playing Jessica. Anyway, now we know for sure that she is Tess.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, and...",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Charlie: I just don't think she's going to be playing any games anymore. I think she's on the run.",
        "Viki: Well, she would have to be, right?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Well, we still don't know what she's done with Natalie and Jared.",
        "Viki: No, but at least she doesn't know that we have Bree.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Okay, Bree will be fine. Todd and Marty will take good care of her. Why is this happening? God, are these contractions? I didn't feel a thing with Bree. Okay, okay. You can't be born now. We've got to go someplace safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Okay. It's okay.",
        "Marcie: Okay. Um, you okay?",
        "Starr: Yeah. How many more of those do I have left?",
        "Blair: We don't know, sweetheart. That's why it's very important that you rest between every contraction, okay?",
        "Marcie: You were really great, though, at your breathing.",
        "Starr: Thanks.",
        "Marcie: Of course. I, um -- I just...",
        "Starr: Is there something wrong?",
        "Marcie: I feel bad. I feel bad about being happy. I mean, you're going through all of this just for me.",
        "Starr: No. I want you to be happy, okay? I want his mother to be over the moon that he's being born, okay?",
        "Marcie: Well, then, you got your wish.",
        "Blair: Or her.",
        "Marcie: Well, is there anything that I can get you? Um, maybe some ice chips, a brand new car, anything.",
        "Starr: Actually, some ice chips would be really nice.",
        "Marcie: You got it. I'll be right back.",
        "Starr: Okay. She's so nervous. Did Dad do something?",
        "Blair: No, sweetheart. She's not nervous, she's just excited. This baby means everything in the world to her. I think she's just a little overwhelmed.",
        "Starr: She just cannot wait to take over.",
        "Blair: I know.",
        "Starr: But you know what? I'm glad. I mean, that she's going to be a great mom.",
        "Blair: You know what it means? It means you are a great kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: How's it going?",
        "Marcie: Starr is amazing, and I'm a nervous wreck. I can't believe that at this time tomorrow, you know, I'm going to be a mom.",
        "Cole: You'll be great, just like you were with Sam.",
        "Marcie: Yeah? Well, I mean, that was when I was with Michael. I don't know how to do this on my own.",
        "Cole: Well, my mom raised me on her own, so it can work.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. I just hope that I do as good a job as she did, you know?",

        "Marty: Never mind. You don't have to tell me. I didn't mean to push it.",

        "Marty: Saved by the bell.",
        "Todd: Sorry. Oops, it's our doctor.",
        "Marty: This could be it?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Hold on. Hey, it's Todd.",

        "John: The woman Manning had is Marty Saybrooke?",
        "Keys: Yeah, her name was Marty.",
        "John: You saw her.",
        "Keys: You made me talk and then you don't believe me? Okay, okay. Geez. Her name was Marty. I used to carry her around and keep people from seeing her.",
        "John: Manning's orders.",
        "Keys: Yeah, Manning's orders.",
        "John: \"Carried her around,\" what does that mean? Was she -- was she in a coma or something?",
        "Keys: No, she was just -- she was weak, like -- like she was in a bad accident or something.",
        "John: So, what, Manning's got her locked up? Was she gagged?",
        "Keys: No, man, it was nothing like that. It was -- maybe because she was so bad off, it seem like she don't want to leave, like she was happy he was taking care of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: You're hurt because I called you by Cord's name?",
        "Cain: Yeah, \"hurt\" doesn't even reach it.",
        "Tina: Oh, Cain, that's so silly. I mean... look, I was about to be beheaded and to have my judgment day, which for me is going to be a very, very tricky interview. And, what, I have a little slip of the tongue, and you use that as an excuse to steal and kidnap?",
        "Cain: It's not just that you said it, it's how you said it, Tina. You still love the guy. Admit it.",
        "Tina: My God, it's like dealing with a 14-year-old girl.",
        "Cain: You're -- you're not thinking straight, okay? Because you know what? I could just bonk you on the head, take the jewels, and you'll never see David Vickers again.",
        "Tina: No. Look, I'm sorry, all right? I -- I'm sorry. I never should have said that. I guess I just wasn't thinking about how sensitive you are, and the depths of your feelings, and... it's no wonder David Vickers runs to you. He can see things deep beneath the surface.",
        "Cain: Too little, too late, Tina. I don't buy it. You can say whatever you can to get what you want, so give me the jewels.",
        "Tina: No, not until you give me my dog back. You give him to me, or you're -- you're going to have to bonk me on the head like you say, or give me my dog. The choice is yours.",

        "Joplin: She's fine. She's surrounded by people who love her. Even the baby's father is here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: I can't believe it. I can't believe I'm going to be a mom again. And then -- see, the thing is, what would make it perfect is if you would share it with me. Michael, please come home. Please come home with me and the baby.",
        "Michael: Marcie, I wish I had your faith.",
        "Marcie: Michael, please. Please believe me. Todd isn't a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: How is the baby?",
        "Joplin: The baby couldn't be better. Please don't make me tell your daughter otherwise. Don't do this. Don't do this terrible thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keys: You satisfied? That woman and Manning, they're friends, okay? Are we done here?",
        "John: Yeah. We're done here. But you're going back to Llanview, and you're going to tell the judge exactly what you just told me.",
        "Keys: You know what? I don't think so, John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Todd: All right, I'm sending her over.",
        "Joplin: Look, it's way too early. The baby's not going to be born for hours.",
        "Todd: You better be telling me the truth.",
        "Joplin: I am.",
        "Todd: You know, your son's not going to like jail. They're not really his kind of people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Todd isn't a problem. And everything in the Middle East is just going to kind of iron itself out.",
        "Marcie: No one has seen him in weeks, Michael. He has told me, Starr, and Blair that he has accepted this adoption. And he has promised that he will not try to take the baby.",
        "Michael: Well, it's great that we have his word on it.",
        "Marcie: Look, he's not tried to make one move, not one. Will you please -- please, Michael, at least just think about it. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joplin: I'm telling you the truth. The baby probably won't be born until tomorrow.",
        "Todd: All right. Keep me posted.",
        "Joplin: Yeah. And you use this time to think about what you're doing. Not just to my son, but to your daughter. Think about what kind of man you'll be if you go through with this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: You got security down here. Bikini think tank went to go get them, huh?",
        "Keys: Yeah, that's right.",
        "John: I need your testimony to get into that house, Keys. You're going to help me.",

        "Marty: Is everything okay?",
        "Todd: Yes. Thank you for calling so much. It's, uh, this is a wonderful evening. Thank you. Starr's in labor.",
        "Marty: Oh, my God.",
        "Todd: So I think the baby is going to be born soon, and you and I are going to be parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Cain, please. You got to listen to me. I got to get back, because there are some people who really, really, really need me.",
        "Cain: Man, you got to feel sorry for people who really, really, need your help.",
        "Tina: Well, and I really, really need to see my dog.",

        "Keys: And I said that everything's fine, okay? Me -- me and this guy got to have a meeting.",
        "John: Good job, Keys. You know, I got to be honest with you. I'm getting sick of following the rules. So if you want this to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, just do exactly what I say from here on out.",
        "Keys: This woman and you, it's personal, isn't it?",
        "John: Yeah, it's personal.",

        "Todd: Eh... she just went into labor. Should be some time, according to the doctor.",
        "Marty: All right. Sometime, okay. Well, we got to fill that time, huh? I have an idea. Why don't you tell me about the picture?",
        "Tess: What are you going to do when Marty gets better and crawls out of that cocoon that you built for her? And, you know, she finds out the truth, and then she's going to hate you.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Marty: Are you kidding me with that phone?",

        "Marty: Yeah, it did.",
        "Todd: So I wanted to show you the picture of Starr and the baby's father, because I wanted to take your mind off some baby from the past, and -- and help you focus, help us both focus, on the baby we're going to have in our future.",
        "Marty: Oh.",

        "Marcie: But.",
        "Michael: I can't allow myself to fall in love with another child. I don't think that I would ever trust that it would last. I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder for Todd Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Todd, listen, Tess was here, and it -- it's bad. Um, have you heard from her?",
        "Todd: A couple of minutes ago.",
        "Viki: What did she say?",
        "Todd: She asked me to keep Bree a little longer, and she hung up before I had a chance to tell her you had her. Viki, I tell you, she didn't sound good. Sounded like something was wrong.",
        "Viki: Did she say where she was going?",
        "Todd: Sorry. I don't have a clue.",
        "Viki: Okay. If you hear from her again, would you call me please? Thanks. She didn't go to Todd's. Where on earth could she have gone?",
        "Tess: It's okay. It's okay. Todd has Bree, and she's fine, okay? And everybody at Llanfair can just go to hell, okay? Now all we have to do is wait for your dad to show up. Nash? Nash? Please. I need your help. Ow, ow.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Todd: Be there when she has the baby so you can deliver it right to me.",
        "Starr: Grandma, there's something wrong with my baby.",
