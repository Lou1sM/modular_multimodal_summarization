        "Everybody awaits the outcome of Viki's and Dorian's election results. Meanwhile, Dorian knows she is not over David and that it's a lie to have married Amelia. Nick is similarly depressed to know that Kyle has left him at the altar because he really loves Oliver Fish. Rex gets an urgent phone call from his aunt in Michigan who tells him she is dying and desperately needs his help, so he rushes to her side. John realizes it's a bit odd that it happened right after Brody got a call about a family emergency for his sister in Michigan. It appears that Rex's aunt and Brody's sister are working together. Brody is bound and gagged, and they are ready to drug Rex."

        "Newscaster: Voter turnout for today's mayoral contest is expected to be heavy. The same-sex wedding ceremony yesterday in Angel Square, featuring candidate Dorian Lord and her fianc\u00e9e Amelia Bennett, will no doubt influence voters.",
        "Starr: We're with them. Yum.",
        "Langston: It's so cool you guys get to vote.",
        "Starr: Are you kidding? I'm so glad that I can't vote. With both of my aunts running against each other, I can't win.",
        "Langston: Well, I would vote for my mother. You are voting for Dorian, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Just me -- the guy you have feelings for.",
        "Gigi: Hi.",
        "Schuyler: Hey, you know, when we talked about how we were gonna deal with this, I didn't think ignoring it would be the answer.",
        "Gigi: I should've kept my big mouth shut.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah. Why?",
        "Gigi: I don't want to have these feelings. I told you that. Anyway, it's just a symptom.",
        "Schuyler: Of what?",
        "Gigi: I went online last night to read about couples counseling, and it said that sometimes when people who are in committed relationships start having feelings for another person, it's just a symptom because there's something wrong in their real relationship.",
        "Schuyler: Oh, wow. Wow. So I guess I don't have to go to medical school. I mean, I could just work for a medical web site.",
        "Gigi: I was just doing some research. I have to do something. With Rex out of town, I can't go to counseling.",
        "Schuyler: So Rex is still out of town?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I hope this is where Jared went.",
        "Rex: Yeah, me, too. But all we know is that he used a computer to map out a route to this town. Since Nash used to live here...",
        "Natalie: Why isn't he answering the door?",
        "Rex: Gee, Nattie, I left my x-ray vision in my other pants.",
        "Natalie: Jared!",
        "Rex: Hello? Anybody home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I wish I had better news, but so far, my people have found no leads whatsoever on Jared.",
        "Viki: And I know you said you would call if you heard anything, but we were just hoping.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. It's kind of getting to all of us: The girls, too.",
        "Viki: Natalie left me a message saying that she needed a break from the reporters.",
        "Clint: Mm-hmm. I know. She's a wreck. She had to get away.",
        "Viki: You know that Jessie has now decided suddenly to leave Bree with Renee, and she's gone to join Brody in Michigan, where he's dealing with some sort of a family crisis?",
        "Clint: Yeah. As if we needed anything else to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What -- ugh. Hey! Ugh. Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I got a question for you.",
        "Clerk: I answered all your questions last night.",
        "John: Right. Natalie and Rex -- they went back to Llanview. Thing is, they never showed up. So what do you say we start over again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Jared?",
        "Rex: Hello?",
        "Natalie: He's not in there.",
        "Natalie: Jessica?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Newscaster: Given the similarity of their platforms, the candidates' personal histories are certain to be a factor in the minds of many voters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: Look, Mrs. Banks took me in when my parents threw me out.",
        "Langston: So you would vote for her over my mother?",
        "Markko: I'm just saying that's a really big deal. I mean, she's a good person.",
        "Dorian: Hello. Oh. Oh, boys! Oh-ho-ho! It's so good to see you here. My, my, my. You showed up yesterday for my wedding ceremony. And here you are waiting on line? You're fantastic. Come on. Yay. Hey, hey.",
        "Langston: Yeah, they are fantastic.",
        "Dorian: Hi, girls. So tell me, uh, how is the wedding playing out with the internet generation?",
        "Cole: Well, there's been, you know, a lot of talk.",
        "Dorian: Good. Positive?",
        "Cole: It's sort of mixed.",
        "Dorian: As long as they're talking.",
        "Starr: Aunt Dorian, I know I gave you a really hard time about coming to your wedding, but I have to say that it was a beautiful ceremony, and I am really glad that I went.",
        "Dorian: I'm glad you were there.",
        "Langston: And if I didn't know any better, I would think you guys were a real couple.",
        "Dorian: Wow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Amelia: I hope it's enough to get her elected.",
        "Nick: Yeah.",
        "Amelia: I know yesterday wasn't exactly what you expected.",
        "Nick: I'm -- I'm okay.",
        "Amelia: Maybe Kyle just wasn't ready to get married.",
        "Nick: You think?",
        "Amelia: Anyway, you should be proud of what we accomplished. There were a lot of couples pledging their love to one another.",
        "Nick: Yeah. That's great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: I always keep a couple of these around. Oh, I thought I had a sports bar or something, but no such luck. You're good. I might actually keep you around this time. You want some?",
        "Oliver: No, thank you. I'm not hungry. Uh, Kyle, we need to talk.",
        "Kyle: About what? Like we haven't been talking enough already? What? We've been up here, like -- what time is it? It's, like, 10 hours? All right. Let's see. What did we -- what have we not covered? We did how we met. We did our first kiss, our last kiss, college years. We did Kyle Lewis' own personal hell the last few months. And, uh, we talked about how amazing you were yesterday. I still can't believe how you faced off against that crowd.",
        "Oliver: Well, I had a gun.",
        "Kyle: This is true. I keep forgetting that.",
        "Oliver: And there's you breaking up with Nick.",
        "Kyle: And I was unarmed.",
        "Oliver: Well, I had your back.",
        "Kyle: That you did.",
        "Oliver: Something's different.",
        "Kyle: I'm grateful?",
        "Oliver: For what?",
        "Kyle: I don't know. How you kept me from marrying Nick. No, it wouldn't have been fair to him. It's not his fault. He's just not you.",
        "Oliver: You're smiling.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I am.",
        "Oliver: Okay. But, um, we really need to talk about the future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, hey, we feel what we feel, and it has nothing to do with Rex being out of town or me getting into med school. We -- we kissed each other because we wanted to.",
        "Gigi: Maybe I wanted to then, but I don't want to. Not really. Rex and I went through hell to be together. We went off the rails because we thought our kid might die and because my sister was working us. But we are staying together and working through this because we love each other, and we have Shane. And anyway, you're going to med school. You're not gonna have time for anything else.",
        "Schuyler: What? What? Are you listening to yourself? Because I'm gonna be busy, I'm just not gonna have feelings for you anymore? You're just gonna will yourself to stop wanting me? That's -- that makes no sense, and you know it.",
        "Gigi: Well, what do you want me to do, Schuyler? Leave Rex and run away with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What are you two doing here?",
        "Rex: It's a long story. We followed Jared to this motel a couple hours from Llanview and...",
        "Natalie: The clerk there said that he met him.",
        "Rex: Jared had used his computer to get directions here.",
        "Jessica: To the cottage or to Napa?",
        "Natalie: To Napa. But we just assumed he was coming here.",
        "Rex: What are you doing here?",
        "Natalie: Did you talk to Jared?",
        "Jessica: No. Nash told me to come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: How should I know where your friends went? I heard them saying they were headed home, but maybe they stopped somewhere. I don't know.",
        "John: Let me tell you something. You keep lying to me, and I find out someone gets hurt, I'm coming after you.",
        "Clerk: I don't have to talk to you. You have no jurisdiction here.",
        "John: Who told you that?",
        "Clerk: I know my rights. You can't harass me.",
        "John: You know what? You're absolutely right. Hmm. Officer Miotti, come on in here?",
        "Clerk: Wait a minute.",
        "John: Uh, my friend here has got an extensive criminal record.",
        "Clerk: What are you talking -- what -- that was 20 years ago, the petty theft!",
        "John: You know those B&E's up there at the Rolling Hills Estates? It seems to match his M.O. To a \"T\", don't you think?",
        "Ofc. Miotti: Works for me.",
        "Clerk: Hey, wait a second. You can't --",
        "John: Just watch me.",
        "Clerk: This is police brutality.",
        "John: No. This is just you being stupid. But I tell you what. In case you get smart after a couple days in jail, that's my card.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay. Before you phone St. Ann's, I know Nash is dead. Okay? I was with him when he died. But the other night I got a call from somebody, and his voice -- it sounded just like him.",
        "Rex: Please tell me you hit \"record\"?",
        "Jessica: John recorded it. And then he took the recording and gave it to forensics, and they compared it to a recording that I kept of Nash's voice, and it matched.",
        "Rex: That's not possible.",
        "Jessica: I know. I know it's not possible. And then yesterday he called again and he told me to come here. So here I am.",
        "Rex: Did you tell John?",
        "Jessica: The voice told me not to tell anyone.",
        "Rex: Okay, but this place has been abandoned since...",
        "Jessica: Since Nash followed Tess to Llanview. I know.",
        "Natalie: Uh, guys? This place -- it's not abandoned anymore. It's still warm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Newscaster: Recent events have pulled Victoria Banks off the campaign trail. Will it affect support for her today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: John McBain is doing everything he possibly can to find Jared, but I think most of all he's just trying to figure out what is actually going on.",
        "Clint: Yeah. And I wish him luck. My people will continue to look, of course. But so far, they've come up empty.",
        "Charlie: Oh. Thanks for all your help, Clint.",
        "Clint: Charlie, Jared has become like a son to me, too.",
        "Viki: What do you hear from Nora?",
        "Charlie: And yeah. How's Matthew doing?",
        "Clint: Well, Nora and Bo are hoping that this change of scenery will allow Matthew to see his situation a bit differently.",
        "Viki: Well, give them my love, will you?",
        "Clint: I will. And, Charlie, you take care of yourself. Because I know firsthand that feeling powerless -- it's awful when your kids are in trouble.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. Yeah, it is. But at least we can go out there and get you elected today, huh? Have you voted yet, Clint?",
        "Clint: Oh, yeah. First thing this morning.",
        "Charlie: And I assume you voted for Viki?",
        "Clint: As if I'd vote for Dorian.",
        "Viki: Thank you very much.",
        "Clint: You'll always have my vote.",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Well, hello, Marty. I don't need a psychic to guess who you voted for, given your history and the fact that you stole Blair's husband.",
        "Cole: You know, isn't a candidate supposed to be nice on Election Day?",
        "Dorian: I'm being nice. And when I'm elected, my door is always going to be open to my supporters. Excuse me. Ah! Noelle and Moe, glad to see you out casting your vote. Wonder where my campaign manager is.",
        "Noelle: You mean your wife? I think she's up there.",
        "Dorian: You're right. Thank you.",
        "Noelle: Who'd you vote for?",
        "Moe: Uh-uh. Not until you vote.",
        "Noelle: Oh, shoot, Moe! I don't know what to do. I mean, Viki's one of my best friends. But -- well, we lived at Dorian's house for all those months. I've worn the woman's clothes, for heaven's sake.",
        "Moe: Just do what you always do -- trust your heart.",
        "Noelle: Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: Markko, how could you not vote for Dorian? She's my mother. And you said that you support their platform. I mean, you came to the wedding.",
        "Ernesto: Geraldo?",
        "Markko: Papi. Hey, Ma.",
        "Ernesto: We saw you on television yesterday.",
        "Starr: Dorian invited all of us to her wedding. So...",
        "Langston: And since we support what she was doing, we all showed up.",
        "Starr: Don't make it worse, Langston.",
        "Markko: I'm surprised you watched the ceremony, Papi.",
        "Ernesto: What choice did I have? It was on every channel. I just don't understand why these people had to flaunt their behavior.",
        "Langston: \"These people\"?",
        "Aurelia: Dorian.",
        "Dorian: Aurelia. Mr. and Mrs. Rivera, I'm proud to present my partner, Amelia Bennett.",
        "Amelia: Hola.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: I'm not asking you to run away with me. I just want you to be honest with me.",
        "Gigi: I have. I love Rex.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah, and you're attracted to me.",
        "Gigi: Because you helped me figure out what Stacy was up to, and you were there for me when Rex couldn't be.",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, Rex can't be there for you a lot lately. Just be honest with yourself.",
        "Noelle: Hey. Gigi?",
        "Gigi: Hi. Wow, I haven't -- I haven't seen you and Moe in ages.",
        "Noelle: I know you've had a lot of big things to deal with, though. How's Shane? Is he still doing all right?",
        "Gigi: He's great. Thank you.",
        "Noelle: So have you voted yet? Because I just can't make up my mind.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, sometimes it's impossible to choose.",
        "Noelle: No, something tells me you're not worried about the election.",
        "Gigi: Ohh, God, Noelle. What if the love of my life isn't really the love of my life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: I didn't see any signs of anybody outside.",
        "Natalie: I wonder who's been staying here, then.",
        "Jessica: Well, Nash sold the place, but it's strange. Don't you notice? It looks exactly like our place in Llanview.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I -- I know. Okay, tell me, do you remember anything about the time that Tess and Nash lived here?",
        "Jessica: Well, this is where Nash and Tess fell in love, you know?",
        "Rex: Does John McBain know you were headed here?",
        "Jessica: No. I didn't tell him. I didn't even tell my mother. The voice...",
        "Rex: Told you to say nothing. What is this? A twin thing?",
        "Natalie: We don't want to worry Mom.",
        "Rex: So you just disappear and worry everybody? You told Brody, right?",
        "Jessica: I didn't want...",
        "Rex: To worry him either. Okay.",
        "Jessica: Listen, he's in Michigan. His sister has a really big problem, and I just told him to go and deal with it. But I'll call him now, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Brody: Nadine? Thank God. You got to untie me.",
        "[Ring]",
        "Brody: Nadine! Last thing I remember, you were fixing my coffee before I went to the airport. You drugged my coffee, didn't you?",
        "[Brody grunts]",
        "Nadine: I'm sorry. I couldn't let you leave.",

        "Newscaster: The deciding factor in this race could be those passionate newcomers, the first-time voters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Hey, John, it's Marty. I miss you. Okay, call me when you get back. You won't believe what's going on in Angel Square.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aurelia: So, Dorian, you and Amelia are missis and...missis?",
        "Dorian: Amelia is my partner. We did have a commitment ceremony yesterday, but it was more symbolic. It's not legal, actually.",
        "Amelia: Oh, but it -- it will be when Dorian wins the election. Her first act as mayor will be to legalize yesterday's marriages.",
        "Ernesto: Let's go vote, Aurelia. Ahem.",
        "Dorian: Amelia, would you please excuse us? Thank you. Markko, I know you love your parents.",
        "Starr: He hasn't -- he hasn't voted yet. So...",
        "Dorian: Yes indeed. And although I know they have their idiosyncratic predispositions, it's clear that they have raised a son who can think for himself. Bravo.",
        "Markko: That's me -- independent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You know how Rex and I are trying to get back on track?",
        "Noelle: Yeah. Ever since that sister of yours got herself pregnant.",
        "Gigi: Well, she had help. And, uh, the more pregnant she gets, the more time Rex spends with her, and the more time I spend with Schuyler.",
        "Noelle: Uh-oh.",
        "Gigi: It's not like that. I mean, at least it wasn't at first. We were friends, and -- and we worked together. Until last night.",
        "Noelle: What?",
        "Gigi: We kissed.",
        "Noelle: Oh, Gigi --",
        "Gigi: I didn't mean to! I mean, I don't think I did. Oh, I -- I -- that's just what I don't understand: How I can love Rex and still want to kiss Schuyler.",
        "Noelle: Well, the heart's a big place, honey. There's room for lots of people in there. But the bedroom? That's real small -- or, at least it should be.",
        "Gigi: No, Schuyler and I haven't gone anywhere near the bedroom.",
        "Noelle: But that's what you're worried about, isn't it? Look, honey, Rex did a bad thing. And maybe you just needed to stir things up a little to get back at him? But, honey, love is like muffins. Don't stir too hard. The lumps are supposed to be there. Unless maybe you're done with Rex?",

        "Oliver: Ahh. I am gonna have to face the guys in the station, then my parents.",
        "Kyle: You really think they tuned in to watch the group gay commitment ceremony?",
        "Oliver: Kyle, it made national news. There's absolutely no way they missed it.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, that's true. Well, it's good. It's about time they know how amazing their son is.",
        "Oliver: Okay, I kissed you on national television.",
        "Kyle: Oh, don't worry about it. They'll blame me. They already do. I'm the big corruptor, remember? Besides, isn't it kind of a relief now? I mean, it's -- it's out there. It's over. You're out there. And look what you get as a great prize.",
        "Oliver: True. Thank you for refusing to let me hide.",
        "Kyle: Anytime.",
        "Oliver: So how does this work now?",
        "Kyle: What do you mean?",
        "Oliver: I mean you and me. We're talking about a relationship, right?",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I sure hope so.",
        "Oliver: Because I have absolutely no idea how to do that. You know, I've never been in a real relationship with a man.",
        "Kyle: Have you ever been in a real relationship with anyone?",
        "Oliver: In the closet? You know, I've never even been on a date with a guy.",
        "Kyle: Wow. Okay, well, uh, it's really complicated. Okay, here's step one: Would you like to go out with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: And of course, if I hear anything at all about Jared, I will give you a call.",
        "Charlie: Yeah. And I'll be glad to just get over to the polls, where I can stop thinking about things that I can't do a thing about -- at least for a little while.",
        "Clint: I can hardly wait to hear Dorian's concession speech. I mean, can you believe her claiming to be gay? I mean, excuse me, but I know for a fact that she's anything but.",
        "Viki: Okay. Yeah, well, she's, uh, she's a complicated woman.",

        "Clint: No, she didn't.",
        "Viki: She just said that she was trying to dodge the reporters.",
        "John: Hmm. I know she's trying to dodge me.",
        "Clint: Why is that?",
        "John: She and Rex are chasing a lead.",
        "Clint: What kind of a lead?",
        "John: She didn't share that with me. But I think she's trying to find Jared before I do.",
