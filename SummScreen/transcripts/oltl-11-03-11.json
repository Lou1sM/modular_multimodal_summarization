        "Viki, Roxy, and Tina all help Natalie get ready for her wedding. Natalie has second thoughts while listening to Tina share her \"similar\" experience of denying her feelings for Cord and lying to herself that Max was the man to marry. Natalie is secretly afraid that she's doing the same thing, denying her feelings for John and lying to herself by marrying Brody. Jessica tells Robert Ford that she cannot keep the secret to herself any longer as John, Natalie and Brody all need to know the truth that Liam is John's son. Dani admits to Tea that she needs time to grieve the loss of Victor knowing him as her father. Todd goes to find Jack working at The Sun and tells his son this is rightfully his company. He wants to work with Jack who needs to realize that he lied about Todd killing Victor. Vimal's teenage sister goes to visit him at the office. She is running away from their parents who want to arrange a marriage for her to the wrong boy. She envisions a rich, American boy who sounds like Jack as the right one for her. Jack notices her outside the hallway, and she concludes he may be the one for her."

        "Viki: Oh, Tina.",
        "Tina: Viki.",
        "Viki: Do you need a hand?",
        "Tina: Yeah, I guess I didn't think it through how I was gonna bring all this downstairs. I was so excited to see Natalie in her wedding dress.",
        "Viki: Well, I'm sure it's gorgeous if you had anything to do with it.",
        "Tina: Oh, go on. [Chuckles]",
        "Viki: I have to tell you, I never thought I would see the day when my sister could give away millions and still be happy.",
        "Tina: Well, after everything my mother did to Todd...",
        "Viki: She didn't treat you so well, either, you know.",
        "Tina: No. But I don't need the money. I have Cord, and all is right with the world.",
        "Viki: Well... maybe not all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: If I'm gonna dog-sit you, you can't stare at me like that, okay? What?! What is that look about? Look [sighs] I didn't ask for this. You got me into this mess, okay? I didn't ask for you to fetch this from Victor's house, okay? And I didn't ask to know that Brody might not be Liam's father. What am I supposed to do about it now, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[David Vickers barks]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "John: I am this close to having your number blocked.",
        "Roxanne: Well, that ain't gonna do you any good, Johnny. See, you got some explaining to do. How come you didn't crash the party and tell Nattie that you still loved her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: So, I know it says lunch doesn't start till 11:00, but I'm just dying for a cheeseburger and fries.",
        "Waiter: I think I can work something out.",
        "Destiny: Thanks. Actually, make that a chili cheeseburger and onion rings.",
        "Waiter: [Chuckles] You got it.",
        "Marcie: I'll have what she's having. I recognize a pregnancy craving when I hear one. Destiny.",
        "Destiny: Hi, Mrs. McBain. Long time, no see.",
        "Marcie: I'll say.",
        "Destiny: Yeah. I guess a lot's changed since freshman English.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: If Todd got everything that belonged to Victor, what does that mean for us? I mean, we'll have to move, right? This is his house, so we'll have to move. Oh, my God. And his money. Mom, what are we gonna do about money?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh! Hey!",
        "Danielle: You're not listening to me!",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry. I happen to have a few things on my mind.",
        "Danielle: Yeah, tell me about it! Now that everything was given to Todd, we're -- we're gonna end up on the street!",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sighs] I happen to make a very good living, thank you very much! We don't need him to support us or anyone else, for that matter.",
        "Danielle: You know that that's not what I meant. Okay, but this house is his.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen... Todd told me that your well-being is the most important thing to him. I imagine that means that he wants us to stay here.",
        "Danielle: Yeah, we'll see.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, your father is not the prince of darkness like Jack makes him out to be. You have to stop listening to your brother. He just misses Victor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You gave Victor a chance to be your father. Please do the same with Todd.",
        "Danielle: I'll think about it.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know... I love Victor with all my heart. But there was a time I would have done anything for Todd. I fell for him... hard, flat on my face. But he'll always be a part of me, because he's a part of you. Promise me you'll give him a chance to be your father. Promise me you won't be as hard on him as Jack is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Jack. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you think that I was him.",
        "Jack: You don't belong here.",
        "Todd: Well... I do. Um, I own this place. You may not like it, but this is my newspaper.",
        "Jack: It's a media company that my dad gave to my grandma.",
        "Todd: But she's dead.",
        "Jack: Because of you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I-I shot her, Jack. Right after she shot me, right after she made me think that you and everybody else that I cared about was dead.",
        "Jack: Doesn't mean this is your newspaper again.",
        "Todd: Well, actually, it does. Irene left it to my sister.",
        "Jack: Aunt Viki?",
        "Todd: No, your aunt Tina, who in [chuckles] -- In a really bizarre spasm of generosity gave me back everything that was mine to begin with.",
        "Jack: You're lying.",
        "Todd: No, I'm not. It's all right here in black and white. You can look at it for yourself. But I'll tell you something, Jack. I would love for you to still work here.",
        "Jack: Go to hell!",
        "Todd: Jack. Hey, Jack! Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: Capsicum bhaji and veggie samosa? You know how to spoil me, my love. [Laughs] I love you, too, Rama. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Watch where you're going, you Badirchand!",
        "Neela: Right back at you, Bakland!",
        "Vimal: Neela?",
        "Neela: Surprised to see me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Destiny: [Sighs]",
        "Marcie: Are you okay?",
        "Destiny: Yeah, it's just... all becoming very real.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Destiny: I'm having a baby.",
        "Marcie: You have to be excited. I mean, you're excited, right?",
        "Destiny: You kidding me? I'm scared to death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay, I'm hanging up now.",
        "Roxanne: Wait, wait, wait. Johnny, the wedding is tomorrow. So you got one day to tell Nattie how you really feel about her.",
        "John: I'm not gonna do that.",
        "Roxanne: Well, I sure as hell can't do it. And I promised Rex that I wouldn't. But you didn't promise nothing to nobody. So you can do it. Carpe diem!",
        "John: Oh, what, you speaking Latin now?",
        "Roxanne: Is that Latin? I thought Robin Williams was teaching those kids English. Well, anyway, it doesn't matter. It means \"seize the diem.\" Okay, Johnny, you gotta seize the damn diem!",
        "Natalie: Roxy?",
        "Roxanne: Uh, gotta go.",
        "Natalie: Did you just tell John to \"seize the damn diem\"? What's that all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: It is okay to be scared. I know that I was before my son, Gabe was born.",
        "Destiny: You were?",
        "Marcie: Oh, yeah. I mean, I always dreamed of having a baby, but like you said, all of a sudden, it becomes very real.",
        "Destiny: Wow. So what happened?",
        "Marcie: Uh, I figured out what they meant by \"labor.\" And I'm not gonna lie to you. It is tough. But I promise you that it is worth it. When it's all over, all said and done, you have this beautiful, healthy little baby boy in your arms, and, Destiny, let me tell you something, there's no better feeling on earth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I trust we have everything?",
        "Tina: Oh, I swear, Viki, I have it all covered.",
        "Viki: Good. Hello.",
        "Ford: Hey.",
        "Viki: Oh, there's my grandson! Hi, sunshine.",
        "Ford: Is, uh -- is Jessica around?",
        "Viki: Yes, she's in the library.",
        "Ford: Thanks. You guys need any help or --",
        "Viki: No, we're fine. Thank you. Bye, darling.",
        "Ford: Bye-bye.",
        "Viki: Bye-bye. Bye, Ryder. Bye.",
        "Tina: Well, I think you're gonna have some more good-looking grandchildren. Well, all I'm saying is he is very handsome.",
        "Viki: Yes, he is. But there's nothing going on between Robert Ford and Jessica.",
        "Tina: I don't know. Babies have a way of bringing people together. I mean, just look at Natalie and Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Bet you Uncle Victor loved this, huh? Having something to hold over John's head. That's if it's even real! I mean, I can't tell Natalie unless I know for sure, right?",
        "[David Vickers barks]",
        "Jessica: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Ford: I think a bark is just a bark.",
        "Jessica: Oh. [Chuckles] Hey, sweetie. Mom's being silly, isn't she? Yes, she's talking to a dog. And I'm silly.",
        "Ford: Especially since the dog probably doesn't have a horse in this race.",
        "Jessica: Do you?",
        "Ford: It's not my call, Jess. Whether your sister's wedding goes off without a hitch or not, it's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: What is with you?",
        "T\u00e9a: What do you mean?",
        "Danielle: You're usually decked out in your best power suit and heels by now. What's going on?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, I -- you know what? I think I'm gonna work from home. I don't feel so great.",
        "Danielle: Are you sick?",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe. It's probably just grief messing with me.",
        "Danielle: Well, I can stay home if you want me to.",
        "T\u00e9a: Nice try.",
        "Danielle: No, Mom, really. If you need anything...",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I need for you to go to school. And think about what I said about Todd.",
        "Danielle: I will. But I have to grieve, too. You know, in my own way. And I can't figure out anything about Todd until I do. Does that make sense?",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course, sweetie. Of course, it does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Jack, I saw these headlines you came up with. You're going after Starr. You're coming after me. They're -- they're insensitive. They're -- they're inaccurate. They're outrageous. They're -- they're borderline libelous. And they're perfect. They are exactly what this company needs to sell newspapers. And if I were you, in your position at your age, I would be doing exactly the same thing. You might be my son after all. You may not like it, but it's a fact, Jack. And here's the thing, okay? [Sighs] I've been gone for like eight years, and it seems like everything has changed. DVDs -- done. CDs -- finished. Successful daytime television talk shows -- completely obsolete. And the printed word is -- is -- is dead! And I need someone like you, someone with your youthful perspective, to point this company in the right direction. Jack, come on. What do you say? Please, will you stick around?",
        "Jack: You really think I want to work with the bastard who killed my father?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: So good to see you! I miss you so much!",
        "Neela: Me, too, Bhaiya.",
        "Vimal: You just -- you just keep getting taller and prettier. But -- but why didn't Mumby and Jumby tell me you were visiting?",
        "Neela: Because I'm not.",
        "Vimal: What do you mean?",
        "Neela: I've come to live with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: So, this is the infamous David Vickers, huh?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ford: So, it's just you looking after this pooch?",
        "Jessica: Yes. Tina is off planning for the wedding. You know, I almost feel sorry for Natalie, but I guess... guess it'll all be over soon, right?",
        "Ford: The wedding is tomorrow.",
        "Jessica: Yes. In less than 24 hours, my twin will be marrying my ex-fianc\u00e9. There's got to be a country song in that, huh?",
        "Ford: So, that means you only have a day to deal with what you know.",
        "Jessica: So I speak now...",
        "Ford: Or forever hold your peace.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: It was good seeing you.",
        "Destiny: You, too, Mrs. McBain.",
        "Marcie: You remember what I said, okay?",
        "Destiny: Okay.",
        "Marcie: Okay.",
        "Destiny: Hey, Lieutenant.",
        "John: Hey, kid. Well, you still have a way with them.",
        "Marcie: Oh, well, I'm sure my current students would disagree with you.",
        "John: Hmm. Just got done, uh, packing up Mike, and he said you'd be here. Are you gonna leave without saying goodbye?",
        "Marcie: You know, I know that goodbyes aren't your thing.",
        "John: No, no. But for you, I will make an exception.",
        "Marcie: Oh, John. You are going to be sorry you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxanne: Um, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Natalie: Really? 'Cause I just heard you on the phone. You said John's name, and you told him to seize the day.",
        "Roxanne: Damn.",
        "Natalie: Diem.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, whatever. Oh, good! The dress is here. [Chuckles] Oh! I can't wait to see this baby. I hope it sparkles!",
        "Tina: Oh, actually, it is the picture of taste and elegance.",
        "Roxanne: Oh. B-O-A-R-I-N-G. No, no! Nattie's got to stand out. I just hope that my faxinator doesn't outshine the bride.",
        "Tina: A \"faxinator?\"",
        "Roxanne: Yeah, it's, you know, they're kind of like a hat thing, you know, that kind of looks like it's growing out of your forehead.",
        "Tina: What, like a horn?",
        "Viki: I think Roxy means a \"fascinator.\" Tina, is the seating chart in here?",
        "Tina: Oh, yes. Thank you, Viki.",
        "Viki: Okay.",
        "Tina: Natalie, I am so happy for you. I mean, this time tomorrow, you are gonna be taking your vows with your soul mate. You won't make the same mistake I did with Cord.",
        "Natalie: What mistake?",
        "Tina: You mean my sister never told you about the time I almost married the wrong guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You seriously think I want to spend time here, bonding with you, after you killed my father?",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Todd: You take my life, Victor? I take yours. You lied to the cops. I wasn't even there that night.",
        "Jack: Doesn't mean it isn't true.",
        "Todd: Charges were dropped.",
        "Jack: So?",
        "Todd: So... Jack, I'm your father! I'm your father. I was there when you were born.",
        "Jack: And then you gave me away.",
        "Todd: But I got you back. And I swore that I would do anything I could -- I would spend the rest of my life trying to make it up to you. Here I am. I'm standing right here, and I'm begging you, please, give me the chance to make it up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm sorry. I shouldn't be pressuring you about your father.",
        "Danielle: It's okay.",
        "T\u00e9a: It's just I feel like I've been so wrapped up in my own grief and suffering, missing Victor, trying to find out who killed him, that I've been neglecting you.",
        "Danielle: Well, you're here, aren't you? Remember what we said after the funeral? We both miss Victor, so we're in this together. Do you think it'll make us feel better?",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Danielle: Finding out who killed him.",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't know. But your uncle Tom\u00e1s seems to think so. Police's trails run cold, so he wants to use his CIA contacts.",
        "Danielle: Really?",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danielle: Well, that's got to help.",
        "T\u00e9a: I hope so.",
        "Danielle: Does he have any leads?",
        "T\u00e9a: Not yet. But he's got to turn up something. Anything is better than having no clue who did this to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I thought about you every moment. Well, every moment that I was lucid enough to think, Jack. I wondered, you know... if you still had training wheels, if you were mouthing off to your teachers. And look at you. You're practically a grown man. And I missed all of it. And I'm -- I'm asking you for the honor of getting to know you.",
        "Jack: You want to get to know me? How about we get to know you first? Look me in the eye and tell me you didn't kill my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: You've come to live with me and Rama? But -- but what about school?",
        "Neela: I can't go here?",
        "Vimal: What? No, no! No, of course not! You -- how did you even get here?",
        "Neela: I'm practically an adult, Vimal. I can take a plane by myself.",
        "Vimal: Do Mumby and Jumby know you're here?",
        "Neela: Yes! They are the ones who sent me. Doesn't it make sense? They want me to learn in an American school so I can grow up to be as successful as you.",
        "Vimal: Is that so? Well, then how come they didn't tell me?",
        "Neela: It was to be a surprise. They knew you and Rama would welcome me into your home.",
        "Vimal: Of course. Of course we will. But I'm sure they'll want to know that you made it safe, so I'll just call them --",
        "Neela: I called them as soon as I landed.",
        "Vimal: Oh, well, I'll just tell them that you made it safe to my place of work.",
        "Neela: Vimal, no! You can't call them.",
        "Vimal: Why not? They don't know you're here, do they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Now, believe it or not, I thought that I was madly in love with Max. I mean, I really thought I was happy, that I belonged with him. But it turned out it was just denial. I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean, Max is a great guy and everything, and it's not like I didn't love him. I-I did. He -- he just wasn't Cord. And you know what? I stayed in that denial right down to the wedding. I mean, we got to the altar to take our vows, and that denial just blew up right in my face.",
        "Natalie: What happened?",
        "Tina: Okay, well, Max and I got to the altar to say our vows, and then all of a sudden, it just slipped out, and I said, \"I, Tina, take thee, Cord.\" I know. It's terrible, isn't it? But, see, that's what happens when you have a soul mate and you lie to yourself.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, Tina, could you just shut up?! Seriously, just shut up!",
        "Tina: Wh-- what? Ah!",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Tina: Was it something I said?",
        "Viki: Uh, I'm going to go and talk to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: Michael told me about your little, um, run-in with Roxy.",
        "John: What a dumb brother. I knew he couldn't keep that to himself.",
        "Marcie: Oh, no. Come on. There are no secrets between husbands and wives. And there shouldn't be between you and Natalie, either.",
        "John: I'm not the one she's marrying.",
        "Marcie: That's only because she doesn't know the truth, John. That you love her. Maybe if she knew...",
        "John: What do you want me to do, Marcie, huh? You want me to go bang on the church doors right before they're saying their vows? I've seen that movie.",
        "Marcie: No, I guess that's not your style. But you know what? There is still a whole day before she starts walking down that aisle, John. I don't think that you should let her get away. 'Cause I really think you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life...if you don't already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Come on.",
        "Natalie: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Viki: Are you okay?",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry. No, I'm fine, really. Seriously.",
        "Viki: Could have fooled me.",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] It's Tina. You know, she just drives me absolutely crazy. She never shuts up, does she?",
        "Viki: No, she does not. Oh, honey, I think I know what's troubling you. Tina was going on and on about Cord and Max, right? And that made you think about Brody and John.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Did you have fun with your daddy last night?",
        "Ford: Are you kidding? We had a blast. We always have a blast, right? What did we do? We went and we rode the train in the park. The little train, yeah? And then -- and we blew the whistle. You should have seen it. He was laughing so hard. Then what did we do? We went home and we watched Chaplin movies.",
        "Jessica: [Gasps] Charlie Chaplin?",
        "Ford: Yeah. See, I figured it's kind of like a gateway. There's no words. You should have seen him. He might become the next Spielberg or Coppola.",
        "Jessica: Are you guys ready for matching Oscars?",
        "Ford: Listen, if it's what he wants to do with his life, I'll support him in anything he does. Right? Yay! What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: I can't take it. I have to tell the truth about Liam.",
        "Ford: So, you're gonna tell the truth about Liam?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'm ready.",
        "Ford: What changed your mind?",
        "Jessica: You, with Ryder.",
        "Ford: Well, I didn't mean to guilt-trip you or anything.",
        "Jessica: Of course you didn't. I was just thinking about how close we came to never knowing that you were Ryder's father.",
        "Ford: Yeah, well, I can't imagine life without this little guy.",
        "Jessica: I know. And it almost happened. Because my dad wanted to play God, and I was so angry at him for that. And I can't do the same thing to Natalie.",
        "Ford: But we still don't know if the test results are legit. I mean, there's still so many questions.",
        "Jessica: Yes. John deserves the chance to find out those answers.",
        "Ford: And what about Brody?",
        "Jessica: Brody. God, I don't know. It's so cruel. The only thing worse than finding out now is him finding out later after he's gotten the family that he's always wanted.",
        "Ford: And, uh, Natalie?",
        "Jessica: [Sighs] Natalie deserves the truth, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Besides coming to this diner this morning, I don't live with regrets.",
        "Marcie: Oh, sure you don't, John. I bet you regret finding out Liam wasn't yours. I bet you regret losing Natalie to Brody.",
        "John: I, uh -- I didn't lose her to him, all right? We -- we parted ways and she moved on.",
        "Marcie: Okay. But you do realize now that you could have made it work, John. When you thought Liam was yours, your loved him.",
        "John: He wasn't mine. It was a lie.",
        "Marcie: I realize that, and that was terrible. And if I had been here, I would have let her have it. But there's something called forgiveness, John, and it's actually a really good thing, you know. Listen, Michael lied to me, didn't he, about Sam? He let me think that Sam was gonna be mine forever, but we got past that.",
        "John: That was different.",
        "Marcie: I don't think so. I think that Natalie put you and Brody in the same position that your brother put me and Todd or Victor, whatever his name -- they put us in the same position. No, maybe you're right, okay? Maybe you are. Maybe the difference is that you actually had an option I never had. You could have stayed with Natalie. You could have loved that baby.",
        "John: As what? As mommy's friend?",
        "Marcie: No, as his stepfather, John, and Liam would have loved you just the same.",
        "John: Yeah, well, that's off the table now.",
        "Marcie: No, it's not. Because you can still have that family with Natalie, John. You can be happy.",
        "John: [Sighs] You know, this isn't about me anymore, all right? She's marrying someone else tomorrow, and I don't know about you... I can take a hint.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I love Brody.",
        "Viki: Yes, I know you do, honey. Um, but that doesn't mean that you can't also love John.",
        "Natalie: Am I making a mistake? Is Brody my Max Holden?",
        "Viki: No. No, you love Brody. And Brody loves you. And, frankly, that is a stronger foundation than for many marriages that I have seen over the years.",
        "Natalie: Well, I mean, it's not like John is my Cord, either. I mean, Cord loves Tina after all these years, you know, and...I don't mean anything to John.",
        "Viki: Honey... just because John said that to Roxy doesn't mean that that's necessarily how he really feels.",
        "Natalie: Mom, he couldn't have been more clear. He doesn't -- doesn't love me. But Brody does. And we have a son together, and we're gonna be a family, so what more could a girl ask for, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Brody is Max and John is Cord.",
        "Roxanne: Exactly. You do remember that I was married to Max, right?",
        "Tina: [Gasps] That's right! You told me! Oh, I want to hear all the details.",
        "Roxanne: Honey, I could write a book.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Natalie: Aunt Tina... I owe you a huge apology. I'm sorry. I think I'm just having a pre-wedding jitters.",
        "Tina: Oh, honey. That's okay. Really, I understand all about those.",
        "Natalie: Anyway, I want to tell you that you've been doing a really great -- great job as maid of honor, and, actually, it means a lot to me all the hard work you've been doing.",
        "Roxanne: Don't exactly make up for the fact that she leaves you locked in a basement.",
        "Viki: Honey, you know what? The seamstress is gonna be here soon.",
        "Natalie: Right! Yes. I should go try on my dress.",
        "Tina: Oh, I'll go get it. I'll come with you.",
        "Viki: Roxy.",
        "Roxanne: I couldn't help myself.",
        "Tina: Here you go. Oh, I hope this dress makes all your dreams come true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Hey, Destiny. Come on in. Thanks for giving Danny a ride.",
        "Destiny: It's no problem.",
        "Danielle: She's just using me for my playlist.",
        "Destiny: Ha. You wish.",
        "Danielle: You want some French toast?",
        "Destiny: Uh, thanks, but I just scarfed down a burger in the car.",
        "T\u00e9a: For breakfast?",
        "Destiny: It's what the baby wanted.",
        "Danielle: Pregnancy's weird.",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't suppose you remember forcing me to eat nothing but fish and plantains?",
        "Danielle: What do you expect from me? I wasn't even born.",
        "Destiny: [Chuckles] You know, it's funny. At first, I couldn't eat anything. But now, I can't stop. I think I will have a piece of French toast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: You've run away, haven't you?",
        "Neela: Of course I have. Forgive me for wanting to live in the 21st Century.",
        "Vimal: Is this about what I think it's about?",
        "Neela: Raajeev. That frog. He's finished university.",
        "Vimal: Mumby and Jumby still want you to marry him?",
        "Neela: Yes, as soon as I finish school. But what if I want to go to university? What if I don't want to marry someone as...hideous as he is?",
        "Vimal: Well, looks aren't everything, Neela.",
        "Neela: They are if you're not rich.",
        "Vimal: You're starting to sound like Rama now.",
        "Neela: Is that so wrong? She seems to know how to choose a man.",
        "Vimal: Oh, no, no. Flattery will get you nowhere with me, sister. Have you tried talking to our parents about this?",
        "Neela: Of course I have, but you know how they are with guilt.",
        "Vimal: Yeah, I know.",
        "Neela: I can't get married, Vimal. Raajeev is not the man of my dreams.",
        "Vimal: And who is?",
        "Neela: I don't know. Only that he's an American, my own age, with beautiful wavy hair and a fantastic body.",
        "Vimal: That's all?",
        "Neela: It wouldn't hurt if he's rich. But he must also be ambitions and strong-willed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Look me in the eye and swear to me that you didn't kill him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: Sounds like the boy of your dreams is just that -- in your dreams.",
        "Neela: Maybe, but I'll never know if I don't look for him. Please, let me stay here. Let me see what's out there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I swear to you -- and this is the truth -- that I did not kill your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: I'm sorry, Neela, but you know I can't let you stay here.",
        "Neela: Vimal, no.",
        "Vimal: No, maybe when you're 18, we can work something out.",
        "Neela: By then, it'll be too late. Please, don't do this to me. Don't send me back.",
        "Vimal: I'm sorry, but I have no choice.",
        "Neela: Where are you going?",
        "Vimal: To call home and figure out the best way to get you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I did not kill your father, Jack. I need for you to believe that.",
        "Jack: I don't. He thinks I'm buying his crap. Guy's even crazier than I thought he was. Hey. Are you okay?",
        "Neela: [Crying] Oh, my God. It's you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Danielle: So, how'd the check-up go? Is it a boy or a girl in there?",
        "Destiny: I wouldn't let Liv tell me.",
        "Danielle: What? Why not?",
        "Destiny: Well, I figured everything else about this pregnancy has been a surprise, so why not keep it going?",
        "Danielle: Well, that's fine. You know, since Danny works either way. Just saying. Hey, remember when all this first started? You were in total denial. You said there's no way you could be pregnant.",
        "Destiny: Well, I never thought this could happen to me. Guess I was wrong.",
        "Danielle: Guess so.",
        "Destiny: We should get going.",
        "Danielle: Yeah, we should. Here, I got this.",
        "Destiny: Thanks.",

        "Roxanne: [Laughs]",
        "Viki: Oh, darling, you look so lovely.",
        "Roxanne: Natalie could look gorgeous in a burlap sack, but this looks swell. Of course, I did like the last dress, you know, the dress that you had for the last wedding where you almost married John.",
        "John: I appreciate all this, but this isn't my call, all right? Natalie's already made up her mind.",
        "Marcie: You really think that?",
        "John: And Lovett's not such a bad guy. Natalie could do worse.",
        "Marcie: And she can do better.",
        "John: Yeah. He's Liam's father.",
        "Marcie: John, can you live with yourself knowing that you didn't at least try to win back the woman that you love?",
        "John: Don't you have a plane to catch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I mean, I-I -- this secret, it's awful. It's all I think about. I can't sleep. And when I do, it's all I dream about. I can't live like this.",
        "Ford: So when are you gonna tell Brody?",
        "Jessica: Well, it's not really my place to tell Brody. Or John, for that matter. The only person they should hear this from is my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Natalie, just have fun, but practice your vows, okay? Brody. Brody. B-rody.",
        "Natalie: What did you say to her?",
        "Roxanne: Uh, nothing. Listen, um, I realize there's some business that I have to take care of, so --",
        "Natalie: What? But I'm --",
        "Roxanne: No, okay. I'll be right back.",

        "Marcie: What's this? Hmm?",
        "John: Something for the new little guy.",
        "Marcie: Aww. It's very sweet, John. You know, Gabe wore a hole in the last one you sent him.",
        "John: No kidding? Well, I'm gonna get him a new one.",
        "Marcie: Well, you can give it to him yourself when you come visit us in Seattle.",
        "John: Okay, someday.",
        "Marcie: No, soon I hope. You know, your mom is loving it there. Your whole family's there now. It's like a whole new hometown for you.",
        "John: I never really thought of it that way.",
        "Marcie: Well, you need to start thinking about that. Listen, I want you to know that we are all here for you always. And who knows? You know, maybe you could bring Natalie along for a visit.",
        "John: You know, I think you were right the first time. I hate goodbyes. Get the hell out of here.",
        "Marcie: Mm-hmm. Come here. I love you. Mm.",
        "John: Hey, look, um... take care of this little miracle, okay?",
        "Marcie: I will.",
        "Roxanne: Johnny.",
        "John: Oh. I swear, Roxy, I'm getting a restraining order.",
        "Roxanne: Yeah, like you'd be the first.",
        "John: What do you want?",
        "Roxanne: No, honey. What do you want? Natalie is all alone at the hair haven, so if you're gonna make a move, now's your time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Oh, Victor, wherever you are... wherever you are... you won this round. I mean, yeah, I may have killed you. Jack hates my guts. And he has good reason to. You.",

        "T\u00e9a: Okay. [Sighs] All right. Okay. All right. It's nothing. It's nothing. Oh, my God. Am I pregnant?",
