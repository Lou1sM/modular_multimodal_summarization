    "Recap": [
        "Todd and Marty are getting ready to run away together after they \"adopt\" Starr's baby. Marty still suspects nothing from Todd. John persuades Todd's former bodyguard to confess to the judge that he helped Todd move Marty from Ramsey's old house to Todd's new house. And he demands that he gets another search warrant. But the judge tells him no way. He has no proof that Marty could be alive and no grounds for the search warrant. John then tantrums and gets physically removed from the courtroom. Vanessa has her arraignment hearing. Cristian tells the judge that he will let her stay with him and protests that she is not a threat nor a flight risk. But Ray Montez protests to Antonio that Vanessa is lying with all that she says about him. Rex goes to talk to Brody privately and thanks him for taking care of Shane. Brody is willing to make peace with the fact that Rex is Shane's father and the man Gigi loves. But Shane cannot part with Brody nor accept that he is not his dad. When Starr is alone in her hospital room, she calls Todd and admits to her father that she loves him. At that point, Todd may be having second thoughts. Janet and Dr. Joplin are also wondering whether they should go through with Todd's plan when Starr's baby is born."

        "Ray: I'm innocent. You know, you could help me. Someone needs to help me. Someone needs to do something. I'm an innocent man.",
        "Officer: The guy's been ranting like this since he woke up.",
        "Ray: I did not kill anyone. You hear me? I did not kill anyone. Vanessa -- Vanessa set me up.",
        "Antonio: So you said last night, before you were sedated.",
        "Ray: I'm awake. I'm awake, now. You've got to listen to me. Vanessa is not what she appears to be.",

        "Nora: The district attorney's office is seeking the charge of attempted murder against Vanessa Montez in the shooting of Ray Montez.",
        "Judge: Thank you, Ms. Hanen. How do you plead, Mrs. Montez?",
        "Vanessa: Not guilty, Your Honor.",

        "Shane: What?",
        "Gigi: I want you to remember something, okay? Brody is sick, so --",
        "Shane: So he may not seem like himself. I know, you've told me a gazillion times. I don't care. I still want to see him.",
        "Gigi: Right, okay. Okay. Hi, excuse me. My son and I are here to see Brody Lovett.",
        "Officer: You can't go in now. Lieutenant Lovett already has a visitor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You're the last person I expected to visit me.",
        "Rex: We need to talk.",

        "Starr: No. No. No. Oh, God -- please, no.",
        "Addie: Starr.",
        "Starr: No.",
        "Addie: Starr, are you all right?",
        "Starr: My baby. Grandma, there's something wrong with my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: That was Dr. Joplin. Starr's in labor. It should be a while yet, though.",
        "Janet: Oh, okay. Well, my bags are packed. I'd better go.",
        "Todd: Good. Now, you understand, you have to be there when she has the baby so you can deliver it right to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keys: Would you quit poking me with that thing? Where the hell am I going to go, huh?",
        "John: Just tell the judge what you told me. That Manning is keeping Marty Saybrooke in his house.",
        "Blair's: Hey, John. Hey. I left a voice mail for you last night. What are you doing with this low life? Oh, I know. You're digging up information on Todd, right? Find anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Dr. Joplin is expecting you. That's all you'll need.",
        "Janet: I'll call you.",
        "Marty: Todd, what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Brody has another visitor, Shane.",
        "Shane: I heard. I was standing right there.",
        "Gigi: Maybe we should come back.",
        "Shane: Why? We can just wait for the other person to leave.",
        "Gigi: Honey, I --",
        "Shane: Mom, you already let me take a day off from school. Do you really want me to skip another day?",
        "Gigi: No.",
        "Shane: Then please, I need to see Brody. And he needs to see me even more.",
        "Brody: You're able to get around.",
        "Rex: Oh, I wasn't crazy about my spleen, anyway. I should be fine.",
        "Brody: That's great news.",
        "Rex: They said I was real lucky.",
        "Brody: I never meant to hurt anyone.",
        "Rex: Look, I didn't come here to slam you for shooting me. Although I do admit I've had better experiences. I came here to say thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: Oh, Starr. The doctor says there's nothing wrong with your baby.",
        "Starr: Okay. Right.",
        "Addie: It was just a bad dream, that's all.",
        "Starr: A bad dream. Oh, thank God.",
        "Addie: Do you want to tell me about it?",
        "Starr: I was -- I had the baby. And she was a girl, a beautiful girl. And I was giving her kisses. And everyone was telling me how beautiful that she was. And she just -- she disappeared. And I thought that I lost her or that I did something wrong.",
        "Addie: Well, you didn't. You did everything right, sweetheart. Your baby's going to be healthy and happy.",
        "Starr: I just think it's really hitting me now. I've been carrying this baby for most of the year, and I feel like we've been through so much together. And now -- now I'm expected to have this baby and just to hand her off. And there'll be no more -- no more kicks, no more kicks and no more baby and it'll just be me again -- all alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Janet had to go out.",
        "Marty: No, I mean what is all this?",
        "Todd: Oh, all that's for you.",
        "Marty: All this is for me?",
        "Todd: All of it.",
        "Marty: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Todd: Yes, of course.",
        "Marty: Yeah? I mean -- [Gasping] Oh, my gosh, it's beautiful.",
        "Todd: Now, you know, that's pretty nice, but you should see these nightgowns I got you. They're pretty risqu\u00e9, and I don't want you to wear them around the grocery store or in the park with the kid, okay?",
        "Marty: You're funny. You -- wait a minute, you got me a whole wardrobe?",
        "Todd: Oh, enough to last you a while.",
        "Marty: How did you know my size?",
        "Todd: I guessed.",
        "Marty: You really picked these out?",
        "Todd: Well, not exactly. I got one of those personal shoppers at Logan's.",
        "[Marty laughs]",
        "Todd: I described you.",
        "Marty: You did? How did you describe me?",
        "Todd: I said no frills, you know, no ruffles and stuff. You're -- you're high- class. You're smart and classy, very classy.",
        "Marty: Ah, I don't know about that.",
        "Todd: Well, she was into it. She wanted to know the color of your hair and everything.",
        "Marty: Really? What did you tell her?",
        "Todd: I told her blonde. But not bottle blonde, you know. And I said -- see that? That smile that starts from the eyes, those eyes that are somewhere between -- what did I say? I said they're somewhere between baby blue and sky blue, like those stones in Sri Lanka. Very romantic. Anyway, I don't know if she got any of it. This all might be wrong.",
        "Marty: No! It's perfect.",
        "Todd: Oh, I have something else. Come here.",
        "Marty: Coming, coming.",
        "Todd: Sit down.",
        "Marty: What is this?",
        "Todd: That's our new house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hey, I'm sorry; it's kind of a bad time. I can't really talk right now.",
        "Blair: That's okay. If it has something to do with Todd and this creep, then maybe I don't want to know.",
        "John: Hey! Do your talking on the inside.",
        "Keys: I was just --",
        "John: Shut up! All right? Stay here. Don't move. You move, I'll shoot you and I'll call it resisting arrest.",
        "John: There's something you should know.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "John: This is about Todd, and it's going to affect a lot of people.",
        "Blair: Like who? You and me?",
        "John: Maybe.",
        "Blair: You're scaring me now, John.",
        "John: Everything's going to be okay.",
        "Blair: You sure about that?",
        "John: I care about you. A lot -- I need you to know that.",
        "Blair: Well, I care about you too. Look, I've got to get over to the other hearing. But whatever Todd has done, it doesn't matter to me. As long as he stays away from the boys, Starr, and her baby, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Our house?",
        "Todd: Very nice, eh? I did the whole thing online. I got this online.",
        "Marty: You bought --",
        "Todd: Yeah, once I saw the views and the space it has.",
        "Marty: Okay, I can't believe it. You actually bought a house online?",
        "Todd: It's our house now.",
        "Marty: Oh, my goodness. It's beautiful. Where is it?",
        "Todd: It's outside of Taos, New Mexico, 1,791 miles from Llanview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Innocent. Is that why your own daughter testified against you at your own trial?",
        "Ray: Lola never saw anything.",
        "Antonio: But she heard enough to tell Vanessa that you murdered her mother.",
        "Ray: That was Vanessa telling Lola. She dripped poison in that child's ear. She made my daughter believe I killed her mama.",
        "Antonio: Are you saying that your own daughter lied under oath?",
        "Ray: I don't blame her. She was confused. She was hurt so bad. She lost her mother in the most terrible way. She could never make sense of it until Vanessa made sense of it for her years later. That was all it took. There was no evidence. It was just Lola and Vanessa testifying against me.",
        "Antonio: Well, whatever they said must have been pretty convincing for you to wind up behind bars for what could be the rest of your life.",
        "Ray: It was completely convincing. Vanessa is the most persuasive woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: I accept your not guilty plea, Mrs. Montez. Now let's move on to the question of bail. People on bail?",
        "Nora: Yes, Your Honor. The people request remand, please.",
        "Vanessa: What? No, no.",
        "Judge: Please, please sit down, Mrs. Montez.",
        "Nora: Your Honor, the defendant came into this country on a forged passport. She could leave the same way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: How's Starr?",
        "Blair: She's not in active labor yet. So what did I miss?",
        "Dorian: Not much. Though if the judge is willing to hear from witnesses I'd like to publicly thank that woman for what she did. If it weren't for her Ray Montez would have taken Langston out of the country by now. You know, when you weren't here, I thought maybe Starr went into labor -- had the baby.",
        "Blair: No, I just ran into John.",
        "Dorian: What happened?",
        "Blair: I'm not quite sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: You're late.",
        "John: I apologize, Your Honor.",
        "Judge: What do you want now, McBain? Another warrant?",
        "John: Well, you told me if I got concrete evidence that Todd Manning was holding someone --",
        "Judge: I told you I'd issue a warrant. And I made good on my promise.",
        "John: Yes, Sir, and when I executed that warrant, Manning had assistance in hiding the evidence.",
        "Judge: And you were given a warning by Mayor Lowell to cease and desist in your investigation.",
        "John: I know, but circumstances --",
        "Judge: I am not the mayor. My only concern is the law. And because I consider you a man of integrity, God only knows why, I am not going to throw you out of here.",
        "John: I appreciate that, Judge.",
        "Judge: So if you have new evidence that could lead me to issue you another warrant, I'd love to hear it.",
        "John: Thank you, Your Honor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: New Mexico.",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you mentioned it when we had our picnic, you remember? And you're right, it's perfect, the perfect place to raise children and start a new life.",
        "Marty: Okay, it's beautiful, but it's huge.",
        "Todd: Eh, 7,000 square feet.",
        "[Marty laughs]",
        "Todd: Wait until you see the property that it's on. Mm-hmm.",
        "Marty: Ooh -- yeah? You spent time there?",
        "Todd: Uh, in my head.",
        "Marty: Oh, boy.",
        "Todd: When I was a kid I had this book called \"Great Escapes.\" And when things got rough -- well, my father wasn't exactly a model citizen. Anyway, I would open this book and I would look at all the pictures of the pueblos and the canyons and I would just imagine that I was there.",
        "Marty: Where you could be free.",
        "Todd: Right there. In Sri Lanka.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Grandma, don't worry about it. I haven't seen my dad in a really long time.",
        "Addie: I'm relieved. But only because --",
        "Starr: Because my mom says that he's the root of all evil.",
        "Addie: It must be very difficult for you, Starr. I'm so sorry.",
        "Starr: But you loved him, right? You saw the good in him, just like I did.",
        "Addie: People do change. Look at me.",
        "Starr: The dad I used to know would never just give up, or let Marcie adopt my baby. You know, maybe my dad has changed for the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Ah, just when I think I'm getting to know you, Mr. Manning. You certainly are full of surprises.",
        "Todd: You ain't seen nothing yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: I'm very proud of you, Shane, for putting someone else's needs above your own.",
        "Shane: That's what Brody did, isn't it? When he told you that he wanted to be my dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You want to thank me?",
        "Rex: For standing by Gigi when I left her. For being a father to Shane these past several months. You're everything a son could want from a father. I'm guessing you were to Shane what Bo Buchanan is to me, a man a son could look up to.",
        "Brody: Until I blew it.",
        "Rex: I blew it long before you did. I cut and ran.",
        "Brody: And now you're back.",
        "Rex: My marriage is over. Gigi and I are together, yeah.",
        "Brody: It was always you, you know, for her.",
        "Rex: And Shane still wishes you were really his dad.",
        "Brody: But he's your son.",
        "Rex: I hope I can be as good a father to him as you were. I also came here to say that I hope things turn out okay for you. I really do.",
        "Brody: Hey, Rex? Shane -- he loves hot dogs.",
        "Rex: Good to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Mom, I can see Brody. Come on.",
        "Vanessa: My stepdaughter, Lola, has nobody but me. I will not run away. I look forward to defending my actions regarding Mr. Montez.",
        "Judge: In the matter of bail --",
        "Cristian: Your Honor, there's something I want to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: Todd showed a side of himself to me he didn't show to everyone. And I'd like to believe that the faith I had in him wasn't misplaced.",
        "Starr: I know it wasn't.",
        "Addie: Still, he did a lot of -- he did some bad things. He hurt a lot of people, including you.",
        "Starr: So he'll probably have to do something really heroic to make up for all of that, right?",
        "Addie: That was your last water. I'll go fill this up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Dr. Joplin?",
        "Dr. Joplin: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Todd Manning sent me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Tomorrow?",
        "Todd: Yeah, Starr should have the baby today, so when they release the kid we can head out to New Mexico tomorrow.",
        "Marty: Well, wait. If she's in labor, why aren't you at the hospital with her?",
        "Todd: Oh, her mother's there and I think it would be too hard on Starr if I was there.",
        "Marty: Oh, right. I understand.",
        "Todd: She said she would call with updates.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Todd: Yeah?",
        "Starr: Dad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: So let's hear this new evidence.",
        "John: Yes, Your Honor. This man is Keyshawn Reddick. He worked for Mr. Manning in the capacity as a bodyguard. Mr. Reddick saw the woman that Manning is keeping in his house. As a matter of fact, he transported the woman from Lee Ramsey's house to Todd Manning's and he's here today to positively I.D. her.",
        "Judge: Go ahead.",
        "John: Start talking, Keys.",
        "Judge: I'm waiting.",
        "John: Tell him her name.",
        "Keys: Her name was Marty Saybrooke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: The federal marshall is on his way. He's going to accompany you back to Colombia.",
        "Ray: If I go back there, I will die in that prison.",
        "Antonio: You know, you should have thought of that before you made someone else die.",
        "Ray: Can I see my daughter?",
        "Antonio: No, I don't think that's going to happen. The kid doesn't want anything to do with you.",
        "Ray: I am innocent! Why won't anyone believe me? I didn't kill anyone. Vanessa set me up.",
        "Antonio: Tell it to a judge in Colombia.",
        "Ray: I did. You have a little girl, Detective.",
        "Antonio: What if I do?",
        "Ray: You love her more than your life, no? What if someone came -- a woman -- and turned your little girl against you?",
        "Antonio: I didn't murder my daughter's mother.",
        "Ray: Nor did I. That's why they let me out of that prison. That's why Vanessa came to this country. That's why she tried to kill me. She is a spider. She pulls you into her web. She plays with you, and when she is tired of you, you are done.",
        "Antonio: Why, Ray? Why would Vanessa have wanted you taken out so badly?",
        "Ray: Ask her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: You have something to offer, Mr. Vega?",
        "Cristian: I don't know Vanessa well, but I do know that when she says she's terrified of Ray Montez, it's for real. And I know that because I helped her get away from the guy. She only did what I would do if someone threatened the life of someone I loved.",
        "Judge: So testify on her behalf at trial.",
        "Cristian: Vanessa Montez saved my life, Your Honor. That's the kind of person that she is. And if you grant her bail, I personally guarantee that she will not leave your jurisdiction -- until she's found innocent, of course.",
        "Judge: Ms. Hanen, any objection to my granting Ms. Montez's request for bail, contingent on Mr. Vega's offer?",
        "Nora: No objection, Your Honor, because of the child.",
        "Judge: Bail is set at $25,000, and, Ms. Montez, you will surrender all of your phony passports.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Blair: Well, I'm going to head back to the hospital to see Starr.",
        "Dorian: I'll come with you.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Dorian: Langston?",
        "Langston: I'll be right there.",
        "Blair: Okay, we'll be right outside.",
        "Langston: Come with me? Lola? I heard what Vanessa said about you being all alone, and I just wanted to let you know that you're not. We're cousins, and if you ever need anyone to talk to, or --",
        "Lola: I'll call you.",
        "Langston: You still have my number, right?",
        "Markko: You can count on both of us.",
        "Lola: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: Mom.",
        "Gigi: I promised Shane that he could see Brody. Hey. Is he, uh --",
        "Rex: Uh, he's fine. Well, as fine as it's possible to be when -- I know he'd be really happy to see you, Shane.",
        "Shane: Let's go.",
        "Gigi: Don't leave -- just wait.",
        "Brody: Geege, Shane.",
        "Shane: Are you feeling any better?",
        "Brody: I am, much.",
        "Shane: Mom, can I talk to Brody alone?",
        "Brody: MPs are on watch.",
        "Gigi: I'll be right outside.",
        "Brody: I am so sorry, Shane, for what I put you through that night on the mountain.",
        "Shane: I know that you didn't mean to hurt anybody.",
        "Brody: But I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: How did you get over here?",
        "Rex: I called a man with a van.",
        "Gigi: Hmm. You know, you really shouldn't have gotten out of bed so soon.",
        "Rex: I wanted to clear some stuff up with Brody.",
        "Gigi: How did it go?",
        "Rex: Better than it went with Shane.",
        "Gigi: Rex, you know you have to give him time.",
        "Rex: He couldn't even look at me, Gigi. What do you do when your kid hates you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Are you all right? Is it the baby?",
        "Starr: No, I just had a few contractions. Dad, are you still there?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I'm here.",
        "Starr: I'm in the hospital.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know. I mean, uh, I knew it had to be soon.",
        "Starr: It's not happening really fast, though. I'm scared.",

        "Starr: Okay, Dad.",
        "Todd: It's good to hear you laugh. I've missed you. I'd see you every day if I could.",

        "Starr: Dad, did you mean what you said, about changing to be a better man?",
        "Todd: Yes, I meant it.",
        "Starr: Maybe one day when I have a baby -- a baby that I'll keep, maybe you can be a part of that baby's life.",
        "Todd: I want that more than anything. And I want you to know that everything I've done -- everything has been because I love you.",
        "Starr: I do know that. And maybe -- and maybe if you can just back me up on my choices, then one day I will be able to do the same for yours.",

        "John: She didn't die. Excuse me, Your Honor, she didn't die. She survived that accident somehow. Lee Ramsey found her, and after he died, Todd Manning took her in.",
        "Judge: And she was at his house?",
        "John: Is -- has been -- for months. We believe that she is disabled in some way and can't leave. In every sense of the word, she is Todd Manning's prisoner, the man who raped her. And now I have brought you a witness who can place her in that house, and you have to issue that warrant.",

        "Rex: Well, here's what I've decided. I'm going to guilt the kid, and pile on the pressure. That's not what I decided. I think we should take it slow. He's already got enough to deal with. And I got you.",
