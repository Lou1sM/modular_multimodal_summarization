        "When Robert is recovering in the hospital, he urges James to know that he could be in serious trouble for refusing to tell the cops where Cole is when he knows where to find him. He's aiding and abetting a fugitive. And he asks his brother why he would put himself though so much of a risk if he can't \"get the girl\" and accepts Starr going back to Cole. Bo warns Inez of the same. She goes to warn James. And Robert expresses appreciation to her for caring about James. Yet he won't tell anybody who assaulted him. Meanwhile, Starr is ready to go on the run with Cole. But he tells her that that is no life for her and for baby Hope. So he decides to turn himself in. Meanwhile, both Viki and Rex are suspicious of Echo and know that she knows some secret about Rex's birth. She makes it clear that she knows of Rex and tells Clint he needs to know about \"her son\"."

        "T\u00e9a: Am I dreaming?",
        "Todd: I hope not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Hmm. I'm really in bed here with you?",
        "Todd: I think I was gonna ask you the same question.",
        "T\u00e9a: There's only one way to find out.",
        "Todd: How's that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: Hey. Whoa. What is all this? Come in.",
        "Nate: Your locker was piled high with this stuff. Thought you'd want to know how much your friends at lhs wanted you to come home.",
        "Dani: What, like my 3 friends?",
        "Nate: Turns out it's more like 300.",
        "Dani: Am I gonna find a mushy card from you in there?",
        "Nate: Maybe, but there aren't enough cards or flowers in the world to tell you how much I miss you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Inez, hold on just one second, okay? I need to talk to you about your son.",
        "Inez: Which one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: Clint, I told you last night that I needed to see you.",
        "Clint: So you did.",
        "Echo: Clint, please. It's important.",
        "Clint: Sorry, I'm busy.",
        "Rex: Spying on your brother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on, buddy. Just one little kick. One little kick for your old man.",
        "Natalie: I hate to break it to you, but baby McBain doesn't do anything on command, kind of like his dad.",
        "John: Hmm. I'm gonna take a shower. Then I'm gonna go out and get you two breakfast. Think maybe he'll give me a little kick then?",
        "Natalie: It's worth a try.",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Natalie: [Sighs] Please let this be John's baby and please don't let it be Brody's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hey. The sun is up. Shouldn't you be at the station?",
        "Brody: I'm on bed rest with the mother of my child.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm. Well, not for long. I have my OB appointment today.",
        "Brody: It's really gonna happen this time?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Dr. Wright's been monitoring me. She says it's safe for me to have the test. In a little while, we'll know if this baby's yours.",
        "Brody: Or Ford's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Don't believe everything you read.",
        "Ford: Dude! What's up? Get over here. Let me make sure you're okay.",
        "James: I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "Ford: You sure?",
        "James: You're the one in the hospital bed.",
        "Ford: Oh, no, I'm 100%. It's just good to have you back. I'm not gonna lie. I was kind of buggin' out.",
        "James: Yeah, you and me both.",
        "Ford: So, did Starr come running back into your arms after you saved her life?",
        "James: I wish. She went straight back to Thornhart.",
        "Ford: What are you gonna do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Last night was one of the best nights of my life.",
        "Cole: Mine, too. Starr, it was the last night we're ever gonna spend together. I'm gonna turn myself in for killing Elijah Clarke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Good. You're up.",
        "Echo: What's this?",
        "Viki: It's a book. \"The Love Letters of Rick and Lili.\"",
        "Echo: Why do I get the feeling you're not inviting me to join your book club?",
        "Viki: Don't you play innocent with me. You copied the letters out of that book to fool Rex into believing that these fictitious characters are his parents.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: I want to talk to you about your son James.",
        "Inez: Oh. His picture's all over today's paper for saving Starr Manning's life.",
        "Bo: Yeah, he was a real champ on that one, but it's what he did afterward that was wrong.",
        "Inez: What did James do?",
        "Bo: He lied to John McBain about Cole Thornhart's whereabouts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: I'm gonna leave Starr alone. What else can I do, man? She loves Cole, not me.",
        "Ford: You don't think that her feelings for you might have changed a little?",
        "James: Why?",
        "Ford: The fact that you got buried alive for her might have something to do with it.",
        "James: Dude, trust me. That was not romantic.",
        "Ford: Are you really this dense? You figured that Hannah had Starr and hope before anybody else did, and you wouldn't stop until you found them. Dude, you swung in like a freaking superhero and saved the day.",
        "James: It was nothing like that.",
        "Ford: Then why else would you do this if not to end up with Starr?",
        "James: I didn't save her life so she would ditch Cole and come running to me in slo-mo.",
        "Ford: You didn't?",
        "James: No. I wasn't expecting anything in return. It's enough for me that she's alive and happy, and I don't make her happy. Cole does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Cole, you don't have to go to prison!",
        "Cole: Right, right.",
        "Starr: You don't.",
        "Cole: You're right. I don't. I could just get a new lawyer--",
        "Starr: No, I don't mean that. I was up all last night thinking about this. I'm gonna go get Hope, okay, and we're gonna find someplace to live, somewhere where no one can find us. And then we'll live together forever with our little girl. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: You don't want Cole to go to jail?",
        "James: No. If it weren't for me, Cole would already be in jail. Bobby, I'm covering for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: Jessica, either way, I promise you, everything is gonna be okay for both of us.",
        "Jessica: You mean that?",
        "Brody: Of course I do. We are getting married. I love you. I am gonna love having a family with you.",
        "Jessica: I love you, too.",
        "Brody: Hey, can we do this?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jessica: Oh, don't tell me that's someone from work.",
        "Brody: Yeah, it is. Hey.",
        "Natalie: Hey. Do you have a second?",
        "Brody: Well, actually--",
        "Natalie: You're with my sister.",
        "Brody: Yep.",
        "Natalie: I'll call back.",
        "Brody: Wait. What's up?",
        "Natalie: What you said last night... you were right. I... I can't keep pretending that this is definitely John's baby. And for my peace of mind and yours, I need to find out who the father of my baby is.",
        "Brody: You sure?",
        "Natalie: I don't know what I'm gonna do if this baby is yours and not John's, but yeah. It's a go on the baby's paternity test.",
        "Brody: Let me know as soon as you find out.",
        "Natalie: Hey!",
        "John: Hey. What was all that about? Something about a paternity test?",
        "John: Who were you talking to?",
        "Natalie: Brody.",
        "John: About a paternity test?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. For Jessica's baby. She doesn't know if Brody's the father.",
        "John: I knew it was something. Brody's been...Brody's been pretty edgy lately.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "John: None of my business.",
        "Natalie: Oh, well, it's pretty much out in the open ever since Brody went after the guy at L.U.",
        "John: Yeah? Student?",
        "Natalie: Professor. Robert Ford.",
        "John: Jessica slept with that guy Ford?",
        "Natalie: Yeah. It was a mistake, a horrible mistake, and now she might be having another man's baby because of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: When I found out that Cole was being arrested for Eli Clarke's murder, I had to go the distance. I had to make sure that she had her time with Cole.",
        "Ford: And you did this by aiding a fugitive.",
        "James: If that's what it takes, yeah.",
        "Ford: When's it gonna be enough, huh? When you're sitting in a cell next to Cole? Come on, James, you could go to jail for this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Starr, I love you so much, and I love that you would go on the run for me, but I can't let you do it. I murdered a man in cold blood.",
        "Starr: Because you thought that Hope and me were dead.",
        "Cole: You're right. I did. I thought that Eli had blown up that warehouse with you and Hope in it. But, Starr, that doesn't change anything. He was defenseless and I killed him.",
        "Starr: Cole, I keep telling you that you did the world a favor.",
        "Cole: Starr, the cops don't see it that way, and neither do I. Starr, even if I could justify it--even if I could get us out of state and get us new identities and get us a nice place to live, what kind of life is that for you and hope... leaving the rest of your family behind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dani: I was so happy when I thought that Starr and Hope had gotten away from Eli. I had no idea that Hannah had them. If anything had happened to them...thank God your brother found them.",
        "Nate: Yeah.",
        "Dani: He tracked them down when no one else could.",
        "\\Nate: It's like he's got a sixth sense when it comes to Starr.",
        "Dani: Hmm. He's really nuts about her, isn't he?",
        "Nate: What can I say? You Manning daughters are irresistible. So, are the 'rents around?",
        "Dani: No. And they've got a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign taped to their bedroom door.",
        "Nate: What do you mean, like in a hotel room?",
        "Dani: Yeah, sort of, only theirs is handwritten and taped to the door.",
        "Nate: Hmm, classy.",
        "Dani: Yeah. I'm totally thrilled that my mom is alive and that she's healthy and that my parents can finally be together, but I don't want to think about them\u0097",
        "Nate: Nobody does.",
        "Dani: Yeah.",
        "Nate: I guess I'm lucky. I never had to deal with that since my mom and dad split before I was born.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm finally feeling better, knowing that I'm back in bed with you and that this isn't a dream. I'm finally home.",
        "Todd: Is that why you were snoring so loud then last night?",
        "T\u00e9a: I do not snore.",
        "Todd: Oh, really? Oh, okay. If you say so.",
        "T\u00e9a: You know what, after a good night's sleep, I can finally say I'm starting to feel like myself again.",
        "Todd: I like the sound of that.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Yeah, and I'm starting to think clearly, and...I've been thinking that, you know...you married me in a last-chance swell of emotion when you thought I was dying. You were gonna be the tragic widower without me, without the reality of marrying me. And now I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. So, listen, if you want to reconsider, I totally understand. I...",
        "Todd: What was that?",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, I'm serious. Just answer me. Do you want to stay married to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Echo: I'm sorry, Viki. I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Viki: Yesterday when Rex told you about the love letters his parents wrote to each other, you pretended not to know anything about it. And then when Rex read the letter, something rang a bell for me, and I remembered an old novel that was on my bookshelf. \"The Love Letters of Rick and Lili,\" the letters that Rex thinks his parents wrote to each other were copied directly from that book, and it all fits. Because Lili in the novel lives in New Mexico.",
        "Echo: What does that have to do with me?",
        "Viki: Isn't that where you slunk off to after you tried to wreck my marriage and destroy Clint's life?",
        "Echo: You think I did this? Why would I copy some old love letters to fool Rex Balsom, someone I didn't even know?",
        "Viki: If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't be asking you, would I? Why don't you want Rex to know who his parents are?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: I don't need to spy on my brother. Bo already stole my wife. What more could he do to me?",
        "Rex: I could think of a few things.",
        "Clint: Balsom, I don't give a damn what you think. And frankly, I'm getting sick and tired of you butting into my business every damn time I turn around. What are you doing here anyway?",
        "Rex: Well, it's a free country, but I'm here for the same reason you are. To see Bo.",
        "Clint: What makes you think I'm here to see Bo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: James told John that Cole Thornhart was hiding in a certain hotel room last night. Turned out to be wrong.",
        "Inez: Maybe James really thought that he was there.",
        "Bo: I'd give my son the benefit of the doubt, too, but we have reason to believe that he lied to John purposely. He's not doing Cole any favors, or himself.",
        "Inez: I'm sorry. He made a mistake.",
        "Bo: It's a little more than a mistake. If he doesn't tell us the truth, he could be charged with obstruction of justice.",
        "Inez: Okay. I'm gonna talk to him then. The last thing I want is another son that's in trouble right now.",
        "Bo: Whoa. Who's in trouble? No, Inez. Come on. You know you can talk to me.",
        "Inez: Bobby was beaten so badly that he ended up in the hospital, but he's not telling anyone who did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: You looking to replace Kim Andrews with Bo's assistant? If she knows what's good for her, she'll run screaming in the opposite direction, like Kim did.",
        "Clint: Watch your step, Balsom, or I'll make sure Gigi won't be able to afford to go to L.U.",
        "Rex: And I'll tell Bo what you did to his son, David Vickers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: All you had to do was tell the cops where Cole was and Starr would be free. She'd be with you.",
        "James: Bobby, I'm not like you. I don't just assume that a girl wants me because I want her.",
        "Ford: Yeah, but you're protecting a killer.",
        "James: What are you doing? You were coughing up blood.",
        "Ford: I'm fine.",
        "James: Bobby, I talked to your doctor. If we hadn't made you come here, you might have died.",
        "Ford: They gave me some medicine. It's not that big of a deal.",
        "James: No, I guess not. According to Langston, you're refusing to tell anyone who did this to you and why they did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: It happened when Jess went back to high school.",
        "John: Unbelievable.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, Cristian basically made it very clear that he was in love with Layla. And Jess felt like she lost the love of her life. So she was hurt, confused, and she found Ford.",
        "John: So it was a one-night thing?",
        "Natalie: Exactly. Exactly. It was a mistake. It didn't mean anything at all, and it had no bearing on her love for Brody. At all. It shouldn't have any bearing on their relationship now, but now she might be having Ford's baby.",
        "John: Huh. I had no idea Brody was carrying all this around. That's gotta be rough.",
        "Natalie: Yeah.",
        "John: I hope the kid is his.",
        "Natalie: What if it isn't? I mean, what would you do? Would you be able to raise another man's child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: John is going to forget about all this eventually. He doesn't want to charge you with this, and once everything calms down, we'll find a way to see our families.",
        "Cole: John won't let this go. It's a murder. He's a cop. The cops will always be looking for me, Starr.",
        "Starr: We're just gonna have to find a way to deal with it.",
        "Cole: Starr! I can't put you and Hope in that kind of danger. Look, hope has been traumatized enough.",
        "Starr: You don't think it's going to traumatize her to lose her dad?",
        "Cole: Starr, when you guys were missing, all I did was think about what you might be going through. All I wanted was for you to be safe. I mean, Starr, I prayed...and I begged, and I even made a bargain that if you wanted to be with James, that that would be okay.",
        "Starr: You did?",
        "Cole: Yeah. Starr, I didn't care what you did or who you were with. I just wanted you and Hope to be alive.",
        "Starr: Well, we are, and I want you.",
        "Cole: I know that...now. Starr, what I'm trying to say is, I will give up anything, do anything for you and Hope. And I can't have you and hope waking up every day thinking that this might be the day the cops drag me away. What if the cops are surrounding the place right now?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: I have a question for you.",
        "T\u00e9a: What?",
        "Todd: Did the drugs that Evans and Clarke gave you completely fry your brain, or what?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, listen. I was just thinking that...",
        "Todd: Eh eh eh eh!",
        "T\u00e9a: What? No.",
        "Todd: Stop thinking, then. Stop thinking about thinking. Don't think! Don't think about it!",
        "T\u00e9a: What'll we do instead?",
        "Todd: Well, I have an idea.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Giggles] You do?",
        "Todd: Mm-hmm.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, tell me.",
        "Todd: I don't think I should say it out loud. It's a little dirty. Maybe I should just show you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: Yeah? Are you up for it?",
        "T\u00e9a: Please.",
        "Todd: Hallelujah. Some wedding night, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: We already had a wedding night.",
        "Todd: So? Who says we can't have another one? I want another wedding, too.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd, we had a wedding.",
        "Todd: No, I want a, you know, big one.",
        "T\u00e9a: Should I be worried?",
        "Todd: I don't know. Maybe you should be. Look at me. I'm happy.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, God.",
        "Todd: I don't know if you've noticed, but that's not a common occurrence with me, so I want to celebrate your being alive and have our wedding. Everyone we know. This can be kind of a dual wedding, a T\u00e9a's alive/wedding party.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: Inez, if James does come in and tells what he knows about Thornhart, he's gonna be just fine. But if not, John will bring him in. We can't let this thing go.",
        "Inez: Okay. I understand. Thank you for telling me.",
        "Bo: Okay.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Bo: Buchanan. Hey, Price. Anything on Thornhart?",

        "Woman: Oh, I'm so sorry.",
        "Starr: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Woman: I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone was in here. Let me...",
        "Cole: Is that the way you want to live your life? Terrified every time someone's at the door?",
        "Starr: As long as Hope and I are with you, that's all that matters.",
        "Cole: Starr, what am I gonna do with you?",
        "Starr: Just say yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Nice change of subject.",
        "James: Did you seriously think I wasn't gonna ask? You were in pain, Bobby. You were coughing up blood.",
        "Ford: Thanks. I was there.",
        "James: Is this about some new girl?",
        "Ford: What?",
        "James: Okay. I didn't think so, but I know you're gung-ho about getting together with Langston again. I just needed to make sure it wasn't some jealous boyfriend.",
        "Ford: Yeah, shocking, isn't it?",
        "James: Tell me. Who did this to you, Bobby? Why do you keep trying to protect this person?",
        "Ford: Because maybe I deserved it.",
        "James: You've gotta be kidding me. That means we deserve what Dad did to us when we were kids?",
        "Ford: Not the same.",
        "James: It is exact same thing. No matter what you did, no one should get hurt like this.",
        "Ford: You're really not gonna let up on this--",
        "James: You're damn straight. I found Starr. I can figure out who did this to you.",
        "Ford: All right. I'll tell you, but you can't do anything and you can't say anything to anybody or you're going to get us both hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Inez.",
        "Inez: Clint, what are you doing here?",
        "Clint: I thought I'd try and corral you, take you to lunch.",
        "Inez: Oh, thank you, but I don't think I can. There's something I need to take care of.",
        "Clint: Want me to go along? Maybe I could be of some help.",
        "Inez: It's very nice of you, but I think I have to do this on my own.",
        "Clint: Okay.",
        "Rex: Looks like she blew you off, old man.",
