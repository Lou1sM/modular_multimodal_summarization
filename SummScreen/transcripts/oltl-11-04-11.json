But it's nowhere to be found. Yet Jessica concludes that she's going to go and tell her sister what she \"knows\" regardless.",

        "Louie: [Laughs] In the flesh. Remember your old pal Louie? From the docks. I saved your life. [Clicks tongue]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: It would be just like you, Victor... [Scoffs] ...To leave me pregnant. Do I remember our last time? [Inhales sharply] How could I ever forget it? It's been -- it's been so many months, though. I mean -- [Chuckles] If I were pregnant... why wouldn't I have... figured that out by now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do I know you or something?",
        "Neela: No.",
        "Jack: Okay. So you're cool? 'Cause I kind of have to go.",
        "Neela: So do I. Take me with you.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Neela: May I come with you?",
        "Jack: Sure. What the hell?",
        "Vimal: Neela! Uh... Neela! Neela!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Well, of course I remember you. You don't forget a man who pulls you out of a river. I'm just surprised to see you. That's all.",
        "Louie: You're not the only one.",
        "Todd: You're supposed to be dead.",
        "Louie: Well, what I am and what I'm supposed to be are two different things.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know the feeling. Come on in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neela: Thank you so much.",
        "Jack: I didn't do anything.",
        "Neela: You helped me to escape.",
        "Jack: I just wanted to get away from Scarface.",
        "Neela: Scarface, like the movie?",
        "Jack: Worse. He's some jerk who wants to be my dad. But I won't let it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Tina's with Natalie at Foxy Roxy's, getting ready for the wedding. I guess there's...no time like the present.",
        "Ford: Would you like me to come along as, you know, backup?",
        "Jessica: No, it's okay. But would you mind staying here and watching David Vickers? My dad's really great with the baby, but the dog is...",
        "Ford: Sure, whatever you need.",
        "Jessica: Thank you.",
        "Ford: What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: The test was right here.",
        "Ford: Are you sure?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I'm positive. It was here when we went upstairs, and... now it's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: [Breathes deeply] [Clears throat] I, Natalie, take you... I, Natalie... take you... I, Natalie... take you... John.",
        "John: Hi.",
        "Natalie: Hi. What are you doing here?",
        "John: I heard you were here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: This doesn't make any sense.",
        "Ford: Let's keep looking. It has -- it has to be around here somewhere.",

        "John: You look pretty.",
        "Natalie: [Chuckles] Thanks.",
        "John: Nice dress. It's almost as nice as...",
        "Natalie: What?",
        "John: Liked your other wedding dress, too.",
        "Natalie: I'm surprised you remember.",
        "John: So am I.",
        "Natalie: Um... is there something going on at the station?",
        "John: No. Not that I know of.",
        "Natalie: Oh, so -- so this isn't about work.",
        "John: No, this is personal.",
        "Rama: Roxy! I hope I'm not too late. Wow. Look at you. What a lovely dress.",
        "Natalie: Thanks. I -- I have a fitting. The seamstress is on her way.",
        "Rama: Yeah. Of course. I'm just here to work, so don't worry about me. Pretend I'm not even here, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I don't get it. I put the paternity test right here. It has to still be here.",
        "Ford: It couldn't just disappear. Maybe we just take a break.",
        "Jessica: No! I can't! I need that test now! Today! I need it so I can tell Natalie that Liam is really John's son before she marries Brody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Of course I'm not pregnant. You know, I -- I -- I -- I -- I am upset. My hormones are just -- they're all over the place. I'm stressed, you know? I'm stressed. Th-that's all it is.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Who are you talking to?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, um... I was practicing my opening statements.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Don't.",
        "T\u00e9a: And I have a trial starting next week, so I --",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Don't. I heard what's going on with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: Neela, where are you? Where would you go without your clothes? Somebody didn't take you, di-- no. No. How could you be abducted on your first day in this country?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, what happened to you? My mother said you were dead and at the bottom of the river, and she made it sound like she was the reason.",
        "Louie: Heh, your mother sent those goons?",
        "Todd: Yeah. She was not exactly a nurturer.",
        "Louie: No kidding.",
        "Todd: How did you manage to survive? Vimal.",
        "Vimal: Uh, Mr. Manning.",
        "Todd: Yes?",
        "Vimal: I'm sorry. I've been using this office for a while. It's been empty. And it's hard to get used to you not being the janitor.",
        "Todd: We're in the middle of a meeting.",
        "Vimal: Yeah, and I'm sorry to interrupt, but my sister is missing. Her name is Neela. She's about this tall. She's probably the only runaway Indian girl in the building.",
        "Todd: Probably, but we haven't seen her.",
        "Vimal: She got on a plane from Mumbai on her own, without our parents' permission and --",
        "Todd: Vimal, we haven't seen her. Can you close the door on your way out?",
        "Vimal: Of course. Sorry.",
        "Todd: You just got to...",
        "Vimal: Sorry to bother. Now I see the family resemblance. You're definitely Victor's brother. Neela, why can't you just do what you're told?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Scarface wants to control me.",
        "Neela: My parents are the same way. And my big brother.",
        "Jack: Everyone thinks I should be so happy to have him around, like we're gonna bond. No way.",
        "Neela: No way.",
        "Jack: Why should I? I don't even know the guy.",
        "Neela: That's exactly how I feel.",
        "Jack: And now he's trying to make me do things. Like, he wants me to work in his office. Like I'd even spend 10 minutes with the guy.",
        "Neela: Why should you?",
        "Jack: Why should I accept him?",
        "Neela: And why should I accept the frog?",
        "Jack: What frog? What are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Rama: Vimal, I'm at work.",
        "Vimal: Drop it. Drop everything, please. I need your help, now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: [Clears throat] So, I'm guessing you didn't stop by to tell me that I, uh... have a nice dress.",
        "John: No. No, I didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ford: Okay, maybe when we took Ryder upstairs somebody came in and cleaned?",
        "Jessica: No. No! It's Lois' day off, and we were upstairs for like two seconds. And we're the only people here-- people.",
        "Ford: What?",
        "Jessica: That little... David Vickers!",
        "Ford: The dog?",
        "Jessica: She was the one that stole it in the first place, and you notice how she's not yipping around?",
        "Ford: She was here when we went upstairs.",
        "Jessica: The last time she took it, she brought it in the dog carrier. That's how she got from Victor's house to here, and...",
        "Ford: Anything?",
        "Jessica: No! Nothing! It's empty! Where else would she have put it?!",
        "Ford: What is it with that dog and that stupid piece of paper?! You'd think it was a bone!",
        "Jessica: You don't think that she got outside and buried it.",
        "Ford: No, no, please. The dog probably has a pedicure or something. I can't see her digging for anything. Where is she, anyway?",
        "Jessica: David Vickers! David Vickers!",
        "Ford: [Whistles] Hey, dog, come here! We just want to talk to you!",
        "Jessica: And we have treats! David Vickers, there you are. Come on. Tell us where the paper is.",
        "Ford: We should follow her and see where she goes.",
        "Jessica: Come on! Show us the paper. Look at her. Don't look at me all innocent. I know you know where it is.",
        "Ford: Let's go, you mutt! Take us to that paternity test!",
        "Jessica: She's not moving.",
        "Ford: All right. What's it gonna be, Vickers? Huh? Gonna take us to that test, or you gonna become a toilet brush with legs?",
        "Jessica: That's a little harsh.",
        "Ford: Hey, you want the dog to cooperate, don't you? Now, listen -- we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Now, sit. That's more like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: You heard me.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: You said you're stressed. Of course you are. T\u00e9a, all I can say is I'm working this murder case as hard as I can.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And maybe once you get some justice for Victor, you'll be able to sleep a little better, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: I hope so.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: T\u00e9a, you don't look -- you don't look well. Did you eat today?",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, you know, my stomach's been feeling a little funny, but don't -- don't worry. It's nothing.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Okay. Does it help? Talking to Victor.",
        "T\u00e9a: You think I'm crazy to talk to him?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No, no. If he starts answering back, then I might worry.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Chuckles] Don't worry. I do most of the talking.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm gonna put this to rest, T\u00e9a. I promise. I'm starting from square one. I'll work this murder case from the ground up even if... even if Blair never talks to me again.",
        "T\u00e9a: What's her problem?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I told her I needed to look at every possible suspect, including Todd.",
        "T\u00e9a: Todd? Tom\u00e1s, why? Todd is not guilty of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, how did you survive my mother?",
        "Louie: Probably easier than you. The minute those guys started shooting, I hit the water. I splashed around for a minute, then I did the dead man's float.",
        "Todd: You're joking.",
        "Louie: [Chuckles] Those guys probably thought I was some drunk old bum who'd sink like a stone. I was a GM3 on a swift boat in Nam. We capsized once. I was in the water six hours.",
        "Todd: I guess we should be happy they couldn't shoot straight.",
        "Louie: Oh, oh, they hit me.",
        "Todd: You were wounded?",
        "Louie: No. Same thing that saved you saved me. I had a chill that night, so I had on that bulletproof vest you left me to keep warm.",
        "Todd: I'm so glad.",
        "Louie: Well, I figure we're even. I saved your life. You saved mine.",
        "Todd: Sorry you had to go through all that.",
        "Louie: Oh. Kept life interesting, that's for sure. Wow! Ha ha, look at you. I saw it in the paper. You landed.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Louie: Looks like you did what you had to do to get your life back. Just like you said.",
        "Todd: You take my life, Victor? I take yours. Got my life back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: Neela was right here? In Todd Manning's office?",
        "Vimal: Yeah, she arrived out of nowhere and told me that Mumby and Jumby had given her their blessing to come here and live with us.",
        "Rama: That's pretty presumptuous. Without so much as calling us to ask?",
        "Vimal: It wasn't true. As soon as I tried to call Mumbai, she admitted that she'd run away.",
        "Rama: What? She came alone on an airplane without permission? Why?",
        "Vimal: Our parents have arranged her marriage, and she despises her betrothed.",
        "Rama: Oh, gosh. Poor Neela. Let me talk to her.",
        "Vimal: No, she's gone.",
        "Rama: What do you mean?",
        "Vimal: She's vanished.",
        "Rama: What happened? Tell me exactly what happened.",
        "Vimal: I left to go call Jumby in Mumbai, and she was supposed to wait right here, and I came back, and she had gone, but her suitcase was still here.",
        "Rama: She left all her clothes.",
        "Vimal: No teenage girl does such a thing. Do they?",
        "Rama: Not without good reason. Oh, poor Neela. She must be very upset.",
        "Vimal: Stop saying that. \"Poor Vimal,\" please. If I don't find Neela, my parents are gonna kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neela: The frog is actually a man, otherwise known as Raajeev.",
        "Jack: Yeah? So, who's that?",
        "Neela: The creature my parents are forcing me to marry.",
        "Jack: No way.",
        "Neela: Indeed way. They swear I'll learn to love him once we are married, but I won't let that happen.",
        "Jack: Seriously? Your parents are making you get married?",
        "Neela: To a hideous creature I could never, ever love.",
        "Jack: How old are you?",
        "Neela: Too young to throw away my life on Raajeev. I know that.",
        "Jack: So, what are you gonna do?",
        "Neela: I left Mumbai, came to America to live with my brother and his wife.",
        "Jack: That's a plan.",
        "Neela: I thought, of course, my brother would understand. But he's as bad as my parents. He's calling them right now to tell them where I am.",
        "Jack: Wait. They don't know? You just left and came to a whole different country?",
        "Neela: I was desperate. But I won't go back. I'll never go back. I know in my heart it's wrong to marry a man I will never love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: It's not really going how I had it planned, but... look, I'm just gonna say what I have to say, okay?",
        "Natalie: Sure. Go ahead.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Natalie: Need to take that?",
        "John: No. It'll wait.",
        "Natalie: Okay, 'cause it might be the station.",
        "John: Yeah. It might be the station.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Well, that was a lovely tour. Thanks a lot, David Vickers.",
        "Ford: This dog is just jerking us around. Where'd you hide that paternity test, dog? Okay, \"sit\" is not the answer to everything.",
        "Jessica: Listen, sweetie. I know how it is, okay? I've been there. You make one little mistake and you try to cover up, and the whole thing snowballs. And pretty soon, you're eating out of garbage cans, you're fighting with the neighbor's cat, living a life of crime. Okay? But it doesn't have to be like that. We can make sure you don't do hard time.",
        "Ford: Seriously? I was thinking a kennel on top of a Llantano mountain with a shock collar. All right, buddy, listen to me. You think we're kidding around? Huh? You know where I work, pal? Man bites dog. You like the sound of that? Huh? No, I didn't think so. We need that paternity test. Now cough it up.",
        "Jessica: You don't think she ate it.",
        "Ford: Oh. Do you think? You want to get your stomach pumped? Or we could just wait and see if it comes out.",
        "Jessica: Ew!",
        "Ford: You wanted to find the paper.",
        "Jessica: Okay, well, not that bad. And stop it, okay? It's not funny. David Vickers is not gonna give up the test, and we've looked everywhere, so it's gone. It's just vanished.",
        "Ford: Looks like.",
        "Jessica: Maybe this is a sign.",
        "Ford: Of what?",
        "Jessica: Maybe I shouldn't tell Natalie that Liam is John's son. Maybe I should just forget the whole thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: [Clears throat] Everything okay?",
        "John: Yeah. Everything's okay. It's, uh... it was a work -- work thing. It's nothing to worry about.",
        "Natalie: Good.",
        "John: Good. O-okay. So, uh...",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Natalie: [Clears throat] Well, you're a popular guy.",
        "John: Yeah. Leave me alone.",
        "Natalie: Look, John, if you need to go and take care of some work --",
        "John: No, this -- it's -- it's nothing to do with work. This is the business, all right?",
        "Natalie: I thought you said it had nothing to do with work.",
        "John: Not police business.",
        "Natalie: John, what's going on with you?",
        "John: Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you.",
        "Natalie: All right, then tell me already.",
        "John: Well, I just... [Breathes deeply] I want to tell you how I feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: I'm sorry, Vimal. I just -- I just can't help but feel sorry for Neela. Can't we help her and keep her here?",
        "Vimal: But we'd have to find her first.",
        "Rama: She's still a little girl.",
        "Vimal: In lipstick.",
        "Rama: She's far too young to be told her life is decided for her, especially if she's promised off to a man she dislikes. Who is it?",
        "Vimal: Raajeev Dattatraya.",
        "Rama: Ugh! Poor Neela.",
        "Vimal: We have to find her, get her on the next plane back to Mumbai.",
        "Rama: Can't we talk about this?",
        "Vimal: I already told Jumby we'd have her on the next plane back.",
        "Rama: We'll see. Vimal, clearly, Neela knows her own mind. If she feels so strongly that Raajeev is the wrong guy for her, then she shouldn't be forced to marry him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If it were me, I'd tell this frog dude and his family to shove it.",
        "Neela: \"Shove it\"?",
        "Jack: Yeah, they can't make you marry someone. Just say no.",
        "Neela: That's what you do?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Neela: Of course you would. \"Shove it.\" I like that.",
        "Jack: It works for me.",
        "Neela: I'm afraid it's not that simple. There is an arrangement. It's the tradition in our family, in our culture.",
        "Jack: So, is there, like, a contract?",
        "Neela: I don't know. There could be paperwork, but... it doesn't matter. My father gave his word. And that's binding.",
        "Jack: Geez. I'm sorry. It's just this is all really new to me. Or old -- like, really old-school.",
        "Neela: They think it's the best way to have a happy marriage. They chose Raajeev to help settle me down.",
        "Jack: Sounds like fun.",
        "Neela: It's horrible! That's why I ran away.",
        "Jack: That's what I should do. Run away.",
        "Neela: From Scarface?",
        "Jack: Sounds really good.",
        "Neela: That sounds perfect.",
        "Jack: I'd never have to see that freak again.",
        "Neela: May I ask, why do you hate this Scarface so much?",
        "Jack: Well, for one thing, he killed my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Louie, where have you been? I looked everywhere for you.",
        "Louie: I didn't want to be found. Getting shot has that effect.",
        "Todd: Sure does.",
        "Louie: So I laid low -- Pine valley, Corinth -- around.",
        "Todd: The cops couldn't find you, either. And they couldn't find the gun. They even dragged the river looking for it. Nobody found it.",
        "Louie: Aha. That is because... I still have it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: I can't believe you're taking Neela's side here. You want her to move here, with us, date some American boy?",
        "Rama: Why not? If that's who she chooses.",
        "Vimal: Oh, so it's arranged marriage you're opposed to.",
        "Rama: No, I just understand how Neela feels. She's young. She's romantic. She wants to fall in love and make her own choices.",

        "Vimal: Yeah, maybe, but she's still not here.",
        "Rama: Well, her bag is here, Vimal. You know, and she can't have much money. She's around somewhere.",
        "Vimal: You're right. You're right. She can't have gotten far. Unless some American pop star drove by and threw her in the back of his limousine.",
