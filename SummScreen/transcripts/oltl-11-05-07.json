        "Langston: I can't believe your Aunt Dorian wants to foster me. Why would she want to take all that on?",
        "Starr: Because you're amazing.",
        "Langston: I'm a huge responsibility. Your aunt's, like, free. I mean, it's one thing for your mom to do it. She already has two kids. But your aunt doesn't need all this.",
        "Starr: One thing about my Aunt Dorian -- and promise you won't tell anybody this -- but she needs to be needed.",
        "Markko: Is Cole not here yet?",
        "Starr: No, he said he had to stop home, but he should be here soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: Are you sure this doesn't have any booze in it?",
        "David: I told you, Alex, this is rehab. No booze, no grass, no pills. Although, they do make a pretty mean pi\u00f1a colada.",
        "Alex: Mmm.",
        "David: Which I can help you out with, if you know what I mean. I got a little SPF 110 proof.",
        "Alex: Ooh! You naughty boy.",
        "David: Now, I ordinarily don't like to pry, but just out of curiosity -- how well off did your ex leave you?",
        "Alex: Mmm. David -- Dickie was very generous.",
        "David: How generous?",
        "Alex: Well, he used to say that if we piled up his money, it would go from the earth to the moon, and the moon back. I got half.",
        "David: Oh, ho, ho, ho! To the moon, Alex.",
        "[Alex laughs]",
        "Alex: Oh, dear.",
        "David: What?",
        "Alex: I've just done something very cruel, haven't I?",
        "David: You have?",
        "Alex: Well, yes. Can you ever forgive me? You said you had no money, you had to work at this menial job, and I've just been going on and on about my money. This is terrible.",
        "David: Hey, knock yourself out.",
        "Alex: No, it -- it's -- my therapist said that I have to be rigorously honest, and I know I've hurt you, so I have to make amends.",
        "David: Amends? Well, if you must.",
        "Alex: Oh, I must. And since I have too much money and you don't have any, I'm just going to have to fix that, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yeah, that'll fix it.",
        "Todd: Is this part of your grand scheme, you know? To get us marooned out here in the middle of nowhere while Marcie -- oh, excuse me -- Penny gets away?",
        "John: Yeah, that was the plan.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I think it might be, because, you see, all we have is your word that she's going to New Orleans. I mean, by now, she could be in Tucson. She could be in Miami. She could be in Albuquerque. I don't know where she could be by now.",
        "Marty: But you know John would never lie about something like that.",
        "Blair: Well, John does whatever suits John. When are you going to learn that?",
        "John: Hey, I'm following a lead. There's no guarantees.",
        "Todd: Oh, a lead.",
        "John: And I don't remember inviting any of you along!",
        "Todd: So you hear a drag queen tell another drag queen that Marcie's going to New Orleans.",
        "John: You got something better to go on? Then shut up.",
        "[Horn beeps]",
        "Blair: Hey, hey -- that may be the tow truck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendell: This may take a while. After I turn around and back in, you might want to get out, stretch your legs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: So, if there's nothing else I can get you --",
        "Charlie: Well, actually, um, there is.",
        "Viki: You just said there wasn't.",
        "Charlie: What I'd like is, I'd like to take a lovely woman out tomorrow night, and I'd like that woman to be you.",
        "Viki: I don't know what to say.",
        "Charlie: Well, I think I can help you here. Just say yes.",
        "Viki: May I ask you a question?",
        "Charlie: Sure can.",
        "Viki: Why me?",
        "Gigi: Oh, God, Viki. Thanks for covering me.",
        "Viki: Sure.",
        "Gigi: I was in the emergency room for hours with Shane. He had an asthma attack.",
        "Viki: Is he all right?",
        "Gigi: Yeah, he is now, but it took them forever to get him breathing right.",
        "Moe: You were supposed to have been here an hour ago.",
        "Gigi: And you were supposed to give me health benefits.",
        "Viki: You have a child with asthma, and you don't have health insurance?",
        "Moe: It's the restaurant business, Viki. Get used to it.",
        "Gigi: Shane's just fine, Moe! Thanks for asking!",
        "Charlie: Ahem. Um -- in answer to your question --",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Charlie: Why you?",
        "Viki: Oh, right. I'm sorry. Yes.",
        "Charlie: Because you're the only person in town I know. You've been very nice to me. I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to you, and I always got the feeling that maybe you felt the same way. Uh -- not to mention, I have a thing for women in uniform. Um -- did I answer your question yet?",
        "Viki: Yes. You sure did, beautifully. I'm sorry, Charlie, I can't go out with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Hey, Halloween's over, pal. So if this is some kind of joke -- now, I'll tell you what's going to happen -- you're going to turn around and you're going to walk out that door and I'm going to pretend like you didn't break into my apartment. Which is a crime, by the way. Ok, you want to -- you want to do it the hard way? Ok.",
        "Markko: I still don't get why they don't just let you stay at Starr's while they figure out this whole foster thing.",
        "Starr: Or at least let you go to our school.",
        "Langston: The only good thing about my new school is they're reading \"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\" in English.",
        "Starr: Didn't we read that last year?",
        "Langston: And I kept my paper.",
        "Markko: Yeah.",
        "[Langston chuckles]",
        "Starr: Well, it's really boring without you at school.",
        "Langston: Any news from Britney?",
        "Starr: Uh-uh, not one. Not even her posse has heard from her.",
        "Markko: It's just as well.",
        "Starr: Yeah, I know. Could you imagine all the trouble she'd be causing if she was here right now?",
        "Langston: Not even just to me. She'd dedicate a whole website to Mrs. McBain.",
        "Markko: Yeah, anything to get back at Starr.",
        "Starr: Yeah, well, that's because Mrs. McBain decided to steal my little brother. Dr. McBain?",
        "Michael: Hey, Starr. Have you heard from your dad?",
        "Starr: No, but he's probably really busy with my mom.",
        "Michael: Your mom?",
        "Starr: Yeah. She went down there to be with him. And Cole's mom went down there with your brother. So between the four of them, they should be able to find Mrs. McBain and my dad's son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: Rex, you got to call me back ASAP. I need to know when Adriana and you are going to go public about the pea-in-the-pod situation because I got a little self-image thing I got to take care of. Damn, I am too young to be a grandma. You look like hell, man.",
        "Michael: Hmm. I feel like hell.",
        "Roxy: Do doctors get fevers?",
        "Michael: We're human.",
        "Roxy: Don't they give you some kind of special immunity when you sign up? Speaking of nasty little germs, those kids I work with -- whew. Wait a second, what are you doing here? I thought you were going to go on the road and look for Marcie and Tommy with Mutt and Jeff.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I got arrested right before we left.",
        "Roxy: You got arrested? Why?",
        "Michael: Perjury.",
        "Roxy: For lying in court about knowing that Tommy was actually Manning's.",
        "Michael: Right. So I guess I don't need you to pick up my -- my mail for me, because it looks like I'm going to be here to do that. Have you heard from Marcie?",
        "Roxy: I think she's smarter than that. She knows the cops have got the phones taped.",
        "Michael: I think it's \"tapped.\" Well, at least John's out there looking for her, you know? He'll find her.",
        "Roxy: Maybe.",
        "Michael: What do you mean?",
        "Roxy: You know, if a person wants to disappear bad enough, no one will ever find them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: If it's ok with you, I think I'm going to stay here. I got to finish this list. Aaron's out of everything.",
        "Wendell: After I get these folks squared away, I'll take you to the store.",
        "Marcie: Thanks.",
        "Wendell: Lady, you be a good girl. You keep Penny company.",
        "Marcie: Hmm.",
        "Wendell: Howdy.",
        "John: How you doing? Thanks for coming out.",
        "Wendell: You folks need some help?",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Todd: Yeah, Evel Knievel here thought he could jump Lake Pontchartrain.",
        "Marty: You know, put a lid on it, Todd.",
        "John: I think the lower A-arm is cracked. Radiator hose is shot.",
        "Wendell: Yeah. Sure looks like it.",
        "Todd: Can you fix it?",
        "Wendell: I'll tow her in the shop -- take a look.",
        "Todd: Where can I rent a car?",
        "Wendell: No place around here.",
        "John: How long do you think it would take to fix?",
        "Wendell: That depends.",
        "Marcie: Diapers, wipes, juice boxes, grapes, cereal --",
        "[Lady whimpers]",
        "Marcie: What's the matter? What's the matter, lady? You want to go out? All right, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: Listen, I -- I don't have a lot of cash on me, but I'll tell you what. We'll go to the bank. I have a couple thousand saved up. Please, not the watch. Really, it was my Dad's.",
        "Markko: You got to feel for the guy.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Markko: Well, he obviously has no idea where his wife is, or Tommy.",
        "Starr: And whose fault is that? He's known for months that Tommy was my Dad's son and he wasn't going to tell anyone, Markko.",
        "Langston: Still, it's got to hurt -- losing everything?",
        "Starr: Well, I hope it does.",
        "Langston: Whoa.",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: That's a little harsh, don't you think?",
        "Starr: His wife kidnapped my little brother, Langston. Do you think that that's right?",
        "Langston: No, of course not, but I can understand it. I mean, she's desperate. I've been ere. I made all sorts of mistakes. I feel sorry for her.",
        "Starr: Well, you can't feel sorry for her and be a part of my family. It just doesn't work that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: God, lady, what am I going to do? Oh, my God. What are we going to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wendell: I don't have that particular part in the shop.",
        "Todd: Oh, what a shock. The man doesn't stock out-of-date A-arms. I'm very surprised. Listen, why can't you just get a new car?",
        "John: How long will it take to get the part?",
        "Wendell: That depends.",
        "Todd: You don't understand -- he can't get t part. Do you see? He's not a mechanic who can work on prehistoric vehicles. However, do you know if there's another mechanic who does?",
        "Wendell: You folks can try one of the big outfits. You know, one of the 1-800 FELLAS, but there's no telling how long it'll take for them to get here. They're not local, and around these parts since the hurricane, it's been pretty sparse.",
        "Marty: Yeah, I noticed they still haven't rebuilt a lot of the storefronts.",
        "Wendell: No, they put most of the dollars where the tourists can see them. But most of the regular folks still digging out -- those that stayed. But we help each other out.",
        "Todd: That's touching. Who do I have to -- who do I have to pay to get an a-arm?",
        "Wendell: Well, I'd be happy to take your money, but it's not that simple. I got to make some calls, see who's got the part in stock.",
        "John: Look, I apologize for my passenger. We're -- we're in a hurry.",
        "Wendell: I can fix that hose as soon as I get in the shop, but I won't have that a-arm till tomorrow morning at the earliest.",
        "John: We appreciate it.",
        "Wendell: So grab yourself out of the car whatever you need. Me and my friend Penny will get you hooked up.",
        "Todd: Sorry, \"Penny\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: Give me another one, will you, darling?",
        "David: Delighted.",
        "Alex: I think I've just done it again, haven't I?",
        "David: Done what?",
        "Alex: Flaunted my money when you don't have any.",
        "David: Don't worry about that.",
        "Alex: Oh, I am, David. Please, let me make it up to you. Here. Look. This is what they do for me at the bank. They iron each one, and then they wrap it in a little pink bow. It's so much nicer that way, isn't it?",
        "David: Yeah.",
        "Alex: Otherwise, money's just green. Green, wrinkled, dirty -- sort of like Dickie. Here.",
        "David: Wow. 100 bucks?",
        "[Alex giggles]",
        "David: It can almost buy you breakfast in this place.",
        "Alex: Well, it's a date. No, wait, I'm not dating. Not after what I did to poor Dickie. He had to give me the deed to his place in Key West. And then the cars, the jewelry, the little bed-sit on park, and the house in Bridgehampton.",
        "David: I know what you mean. I hate the Hamptons.",
        "Alex: Well, that's when my addiction started. Dickie would go to London on business. Then it would just be me and the gardener. And the pool boy. And the little man who did the tile work around the sink. It was really pretty fun, but it was wrong. It was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.",
        "David: Hey, hey -- please, don't do that.",
        "Alex: Why?",
        "David: Well, it hurts, doesn't it?",
        "Alex: Huh. Yeah. Oh --",
        "David: You ok?",
        "Alex: Oh. Oh, your touch -- oh, your touch is so wonderful.",
        "David: Huh.",
        "Alex: Hmm. I mustn't.",
        "David: You mustn't?",
        "Alex: Uh-uh. No more sex, no more sex.",
        "David: Ever?",
        "Alex: Well, I'm reading this book and it says that if I'm celibate for six months, I'll be a virgin again.",
        "David: You haven't had sex in six months?",
        "Alex: No, I just started. Six weeks, three days, two hours.",
        "David: Look, Alex, I know you want to make amends to Dickie and all, but you really should not deny yourself. It's not healthy. And these things that you say that you can't get over -- I can help you.",
        "Alex: But my therapist says I don't have any boundaries. And she says that when I want someone, I just give myself completely to them, and there's -- it's been six long weeks, David.",
        "David: Oh, Alex --",
        "Alex: Mmm.",
        "David: I can help you.",
        "Alex: Mm-hmm.",
        "David: Just let me in.",

        "Charlie: Can I ask you a question?",
        "Viki: Sure.",
        "Charlie: Why won't you go out with me?",
        "Viki: Charlie, we've had, like, two or three conversations about the menu. I don't even know you.",
        "Charlie: Well, see, and then we can fix that.",
        "Viki: Besides, I have to work a split shift tomorrow. I'm going to be tired.",
        "Charlie: Well, so we can go another night, then.",
        "Viki: Charlie --",
        "Charlie: What? You're just working your way up to telling me that you're already going out with someone?",
        "Viki: No. No, and actually, that's how I want to keep it.",
        "Charlie: Ah. All right. Uh -- yeah, I get that. Doesn't hurt to ask, right?",
        "Viki: Right. I'm sorry.",
        "Charlie: No --",
        "Viki: I mean, I wish things were different for me, but they're just not, ok?",
        "Charlie: Yeah. I guess just get the check, then.",
        "Viki: I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: It's not that I don't trust you, it's just that my therapist told me to stay away from men like you. Attractive men. She said I'm too vulnerable.",
        "David: Well, wait, hold on a second. Hold on, hold on. I can understand that. I can, because -- I'm vulnerable, too.",
        "Alex: You are?",
        "David: Yes. Alex, as a matter of fact, all of my therapists used to say that I'm so vulnerable, they could see right through me.",
        "Alex: Oh, how awful for you.",
        "David: And this morning, when I went outside to teach tai chi, no shadow. I'm like an empty vessel.",
        "Alex: You poor, deprived man. Oh.",
        "David: Wait a second. I can smell the cash.",
        "Alex: It's my signature scent. They call it \"cash.\"",
        "David: It's so subtle. Oh, Alex, we were -- I'm telling you, we're made for each other. You and all that beautiful money.",
        "Alex: Hmm.",
        "David: And me and my encyclopedic knowledge of the Kama Sutra. Do you know that in Polynesia, the natives make love at the full moon wearing nothing but the oil of the Puna Puna flower?",
        "Alex: I've never smelled a Puna Puna blossom.",
        "David: It grows in the same climate as the lick-it lick-it root.",
        "Alex: Oh.",
        "David: Oh, Alex, there's so much I want to show you.",
        "Alex: Oh.",
        "David: It can all be yours.",

        "Roxy: Can I do something for you, like a shave?",
        "Michael: Oh, thanks, Rox. If you could just sit with me for a little while, it would really mean a lot to me.",
        "Roxy: Sure.",
        "Michael: You're the only friendly face I've seen all day. I'm never going to forget how you took care of Tommy. You know? The boy loves you. It's almost like you're his --",
        "Roxy: Aunt, because I'm not old enough to be his grandmother, right?",
        "Michael: I just wish that Marcie would have considered joint custody. You know, Todd offered. We could have shared Tommy.",
        "Roxy: You know, speaking of Cher -- she's hot, right? You know, for a grandmother?",
        "Michael: I'm sorry?",
        "Roxy: Because maybe to feel better, maybe I should make up a list of, like, hot grandmothers, like Cher, Goldie Hawn, Priscilla Presley, because it's -- you know, it's not how old you are or, you know, or how bad everything is, it's like -- you got to change the way you look at it, you got to change your attitude. So Marcie's on the lam and, hey, you know, I'm not 19. But I ain't dead yet. And neither is Marcie.",

        "Langston: Just because I feel sorry for Mr. McBain means I can't be a part of your family?",
        "Starr: And you don't think I feel bad for Mrs. McBain? I know she loves Tommy, but once she found out that he belongs to my dad, she had no right to run away with him like that.",
        "Langston: People make mistakes, Starr.",
        "Starr: Well, I am sick of the people in my life who are supposed to be grownups running off and breaking the law and doing things that they would kill us if we did.",
        "Markko: She's got a point.",
        "Starr: And what about Tommy? Did he get a vote when Mrs. McBain decided to go out the window? No. This thing is completely unfair, and Jack is freaking out, and this whole thing blows right now, Langston.",
        "Langston: Sorry. I didn't mean to add to it.",
        "Starr: Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that you wouldn't be a part of my family. I guess sisters fight.",
        "Langston: Sisters?",
        "Starr: Well, foster cousins, twice removed. Right?",
        "Langston: No. Sisters.",
        "Markko: Aw.",

        "Viki: If you need money --",
        "Gigi: I've got it covered, oh -- of course, if I had health benefits --",
        "Moe: I'd be paying 40 times what big companies and labor unions pay. Then I'd have to charge $50 for a cheeseburger. You think I have health insurance?",
        "Viki: Well, it is a terrible problem, I know that. I mean, the premiums for small businesses have gone up 15% in the last three years alone.",
        "Moe: How come you got those numbers on the tip of your tongue?",
        "Viki: A newspaper that I read regularly -- there was a whole series of articles they did on that.",
        "Moe: Oh. I'll get that chicken-fried steak working, even though it's a crime to do that to a good piece of meat.",
        "Viki: Hey, I'm going to give Charlie his check and then I'm going to go home, ok?",
        "Gigi: Hmm. I saw you two having a big, old heavy conversation.",
        "Viki: Yeah, he asked me out.",

        "Gigi: Viki! Where is he going to take you?",
        "Viki: Nowhere. I said no.",
        "Gigi: Why?",
        "Viki: Honey, I don't even know him.",
        "Gigi: Oh. He was sweet to Shane, he told me I'm a good mom, he's good-looking, and he likes you. What else do you need to know?",
        "Viki: I don't want a man in my life right now, ok, not even a nice man. Besides, what's the point in starting something if we're never going to see each other again?",
        "Gigi: What are you talking about? Are you leaving Paris?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alex: Oh! Oh. Stay back. Uh -- if you care about me at all, you will stop tempting me.",
        "David: But, Alex, we're made for each other!",
        "Alex: I know, but I -- I made myself a promise, a vow that I would never hurt anybody again the way I hurt poor Dickie.",
        "David: You can hurt me -- I don't mind.",
        "Alex: Well, I do mind. And my therapist said that if I really want to change, I have to do everything differently. So, once I become a virgin again, I made myself a promise that I would never, ever give myself again to anyone unless we were really committed -- I mean, really committed.",

        "Todd: Is this Penny? Well?",
        "Wendell: I'm sorry, folks. Penny's my dog.",
        "John: Your dog? Really? So, you haven't seen this woman in the photo?",
        "Wendell: No. And it's a small town. Strangers like y'all -- y'all stick out like a sore thumb. Well, let's get to it. We got to track down that a-arm.",
        "Wendell: So like I said, you folks grab what you need out of the car, and I'll get you hooked up.",

        "Michael: Hmm. Yeah, and the FBI, the State Police, and whoever Todd's hired.",
        "Roxy: So what I said to you before -- that was a line of bull, because Johnny's going to bring Marcie back here, he's going to throw her in the slammer, and then Tommy's going to have to go to Todd's.",
        "Michael: And there ain't a damn thing I can do about it.",
        "Roxy: You are so wrong about that. You've got to stay strong for her when she gets back, so get a shave -- just clean it up -- and be the husband and the doctor that she can depend on. Am I right?",

        "Starr: Oh, no.",
        "Cole: I, um -- can I -- can I call you later?",
        "Starr: Yeah, sure, I guess.",
        "Cole: Yeah, I'll call you, ok? I promise.",
        "Langston: He's not coming?",
        "Starr: He -- he said that his computer crashed and he thinks he lost his history paper.",
        "Markko: Oh. That sucks.",
        "Langston: Is he going to have to rewrite it?",
        "Starr: Well, not if somebody who knows her way around the computer goes over there and finds it for him.",

        "Gigi: Oh. What's wrong with having one nice evening with a good man? Why can't you just take a chance? So what if there aren't any guarantees? Sometimes, a person has to go for it in their life, you know what I mean? And you know what, Viki? Do your own dirty work.",

        "Alex: And I give my lovers everything -- the keys to my heart, my house, my Ferrari.",
        "David: Safe-deposit box?",
        "Alex: Of course. And I'd be happy to do that again if I could make sure I had the right man. It's so humiliating to fill a man's wallet and his stock portfolio and his mutual fund and find out all he really wanted was to have me in his bed.",
        "David: Oh, Alex. We would never have that problem.",
        "Alex: Well, I just have to be sure and -- let me spell it out for you. I won't give myself to any man again un-- unless I'm married.",

        "Langston: And since he is pretty much a boy genius when it comes to computers --",
        "Starr: I know -- you guys are probably right. I know how much Cole wants to ace history this semester, so --",
        "Markko: Ugh, don't remind me. Hey, I should probably go. I still have to proof my paper.",
        "Langston: Yeah. I need to get back to the group home before 10:00. I don't want any \"lates\" on my sheet, at least not until your aunt Dorian's approved and I'm officially out of there.",
        "Starr: Hmm.",
        "Markko: Can I drop you someplace?",
        "Starr: Um -- no, you know what? I think I'm good. I just have some reading to do, and if Cole gets all caught up, I might meet up with him later.",
        "Langston: Ok. See ya -- sis. Is that way geeky?",
        "Starr: Yes, totally geeky. No, it's really cool. I love it.",

        "Roxy: All right, man, I know -- you'll work it out.",
        "Michael: And you're right. Now, I need to pull it together on my end so that Marcie has something to come home to. I should probably start talking to some lawyers, you know, try to work out a game plan.",

        "Wendell: No, ma'am, I'm sorry. There's only room for the one passenger in the truck.",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: Dibs. I'll get us a hotel.",
        "Wendell: But by the time I get you hitched up, you could walk to the gas station. Ain't but a mile down the road. They'll give you a lift to --",
        "Blair: A mile?",
        "Wendell: To the motel.",
        "John: Keys are in the ignition. Let's go.",

        "Wendell: Look, look. Now, I know I said I didn't want to know what's going on with you. From what I gather, you and that fellow, the one that likes to boss everybody around --",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Wendell: You all got a difference of opinion about that boy of yours, and all I can say is I'm proud to help you.",
        "Marcie: Thank you.",
        "Wendell: Right. Soon as I get done, I'll take you home and get you cleaned up.",
        "Marcie: You know, I don't really know what I would've done without you -- you or your wife, Celia.",
        "Wendell: It's like I told that fellow -- people around here help each other out.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. I just don't really know how much more of this I can take, you know, because it's just -- it's --",
        "Wendell: You love that boy?",

        "Marcie: It's John's cell phone.",

        "Alex: Well, I have to be sure, David. I really need to make sure that whoever I'm with appreciates all my talents and everything that I know, like my fine wine collection, my early-American art collection, my 90-foot yacht.",
        "David: There's a -- you own a -- I could captain a yacht.",
        "Alex: See? You do understand. I couldn't possibly give myself to someone who doesn't enjoy all that I have to offer.",
        "David: And you'd -- you'd have to be married -- to each other.",
        "Alex: Well, my therapist says if I really want to get over my sex addiction, that I have to find somebody who really loves all of me. Otherwise, I will just keep flitting from fling to fling to fling to fling.",
        "David: Yeah, I -- I got it, ok, so -- so.",
        "Alex: I know it's a lot to ask, but the right man will know what to do.",
