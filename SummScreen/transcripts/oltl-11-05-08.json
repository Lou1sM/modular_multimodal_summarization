        "Shane: Rex, wait.",
        "Rex: Yeah?",
        "Shane: I was thinking, maybe we could talk?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cain: See? Nothing to sweat. Your hands are nice and sweet smelling, even though you had to wash with motel soap, oh, my God.",
        "Tina: Cain, where is my dog? Why won't you let me see David Vickers?",
        "Cain: Uh, he's on his way, okay? Just like he was a half an hour ago when you started yelling at me about it then.",
        "Tina: Don't you see I don't have any time? There are people who desperately need me. I am working against the clock here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Can you see it? Can you see the timer?",
        "Jared: No, Tess put it so we can't, no matter what angle we're trying to look at it. Damn it!",
        "[Jared sighs]",
        "Jared: I'm sorry. I know that doesn't help. I just feel like if I could see that damn timer, we'd know how much time we had before this thing --",
        "Natalie: Blows us away.",
        "Jared: Look, someone could still find us. I did, okay?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, with Tina's help.",
        "Jared: Maybe Tina will finally do the right thing and tell someone.",
        "Natalie: She hasn't yet, Jared.",
        "Jared: Natalie, please, don't give up, okay? We have a future to plan together.",
        "Natalie: Jared, I'm sorry, but it's time to face reality. There is no more hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, sweetheart, I wish you could tell me where your Aunt Natalie is and where your mommy is.",
        "[Bree crying]",
        "Viki: I know, I know, I know. I wish I knew.",
        "Clint: Oh, thank God you have her.",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Clint: Has there been any word, yet?",
        "Viki: No, not at all. And Charlie's out looking for Tess now.",
        "Clint: You know, while you were away, I was here. I should've kept this from happening. Oh, Viki, where are our daughters?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Someone's here. Nash?",
        "Viki: [As Niki] Nope, Nash is history. It's just you and me, honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Too much, isn't it?",
        "Todd: Yeah, it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Niki Smith?",
        "Niki: In the flesh. Or whatever passes for it in your mind, anyway.",
        "[Tess groans]",
        "Niki: Still here. You should be glad I'm here.",
        "Tess: I came here to be with Nash. I sure as hell don't want you.",
        "Niki: Well, sorry, I'm all you got. You know, this is good stuff. You should have some.",
        "Tess: Well, I'm pregnant. I'm about to have a kid and -- oh, not to mention the Hep C and the donor liver.",
        "Niki: Jeez, you sound like your uptight mother.",
        "Tess: Oh, she's not my mother, and neither are you.",
        "Niki: Right, 'cause you gave birth to yourself. But you did give birth to Bree, so you know this is not going to be a walk in the park, right? You should have some, take the edge off. Besides, I don't like drinking alone.",
        "Tess: It never stopped you before.",
        "Niki: You're right, it didn't.",
        "Tess: It's too soon. It's too soon for this baby.",
        "Niki: Well, that's not up to you, is it? 'Cause kids, they've got a mind of their own. You sure did.",
        "Tess: What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Did you get her to sleep?",
        "Viki: Finally. That child is so unhappy and so tired.",
        "Clint: You know, Viki, if I hadn't been so wrapped up in getting back at Dorian and being angry at Natalie, Natalie would still be here and Jessica would be getting the help that she needs.",
        "Viki: You don't know that.",
        "Clint: Oh, that's very generous of you, but it's not true. Oh, we don't even know if they're hurt. We don't even know if they're alive.",
        "Viki: No, no, no, they are not gone. I know that. I don't know how I know it, but I -- I know it. The problem is, I -- I just don't know how much longer -- Clint, they need us. They need us and there's nothing we can do about it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Clint: It's Bo. Yeah, Bo, is there any news about the girls?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I know you've given up hope.",
        "Natalie: I just believe in facing things, Jared.",
        "Jared: But we're still here, all right, okay? And as long as we're here, breathing and talking and holding each other, there is hope.",
        "Natalie: You've just been so amazing through all of this. I mean, you -- you didn't believe Tess. You knew that I didn't leave you. You just -- you knew.",
        "Jared: It's because I know you, Sparky.",
        "Natalie: Maybe you shouldn't call me that right now.",
        "[Jared and Natalie laugh]",
        "Natalie: Jared, if we were able to live, like, a long happy life, what would you have wanted?",
        "Jared: Exactly what I have right here.",
        "[Timer beeping]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Well, it was either this or a sweatsuit. Maybe I should go upstairs and get --",
        "Todd: No, no, no, no, the dress isn't too much, you are.",
        "Marty: I know, what am I thinking, right? Your daughter's going into labor, and here I am playing dress up.",
        "Todd: Marty, Marty, I'm absolutely blown away.",
        "Marty: You're what?",
        "Todd: I'm standing here looking at you and I'm thinking, this woman deserves everything good in life. And I know -- I think I know how you feel about me. I can see it in your eyes. And you have to find a way to stop it, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: You want to talk to Rex alone?",
        "Shane: I was kind of thinking that, yeah. Is it okay?",
        "Gigi: Oh, it's totally okay, of course. Um, maybe I'll just -- I just go talk to Brody, then.",
        "Rex: Want to go up there?",
        "Shane: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: What are you doing here? I know you hate my guts.",
        "Gigi: Well, see, that's where you're wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shane: That's not like forever, is it?",
        "Rex: No, I can kind of walk already. The doctors are just making me stick to the wheels a little longer.",
        "Shane: Good, because, you know, that would suck.",
        "Rex: Big time, but it's all good.",
        "Shane: So, you're my dad.",
        "Rex: Yeah, lucky me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cain: The hotel could use an upgrade on the amenities, but you get what you pay for, right?",
        "Tina: I am not kidding, Cain. Where is my dog?",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Cain: Aha!",
        "Cain: You're late.",
        "Man: Traffic.",
        "Tina: Oh, David Vickers! Baby, are you okay?",
        "Cain: Just hold your horses.",
        "Tina: But -- but we have a deal, the jewels for the dog.",
        "Cain: Not so fast, sister. I'd like you to meet Neil Silver.",
        "Neil: Catchy name for a jewelry appraiser, huh?",
        "Tina: A what?",
        "Neil: Yeah, Neil Diamond would've been a better name, but that was taken. That was a fun lawsuit.",
        "Tina: I am so insulted.",
        "Cain: Oh, really? Because I think you might be trying to pass off phony jewels again? Remember who you're dealing with, all right? So fork them over, and they better be real this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Thank you, Bo. Yeah. No, no, I'm -- I'm with Viki now. So you call again if anything else happens, yeah.",
        "Viki: What was that about?",
        "Clint: Bo finally got that mechanic to talk. Rocco, the guy who looked at Natalie's car after your accident?",
        "Viki: What did he say?",
        "Clint: He said he told Jessica that those brakes had been tampered with. And then he said that Jessie told him that it was a family matter and she would \"take care of everything.\"",
        "Viki: Oh, God.",
        "Clint: I think you need to sit down.",
        "Viki: That means -- oh, my God, it means that Tess really -- she was trying to kill Natalie and Jared.",
        "Clint: And almost killed you.",
        "Viki: Well, she would want me dead. I mean, she blames me, and quite rightly so, for what happened to her when she was a child.",
        "Clint: Viki, that was not you and you know that. That was Niki Smith.",
        "Viki: And what difference does that make now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Save the spin control, okay? I know what happened to me when I was too little to take care of myself.",
        "Niki: Well, I tried to keep an eye on you, but you always liked wandering around.",
        "Tess: Because you hit on every creep in that dive bar we used to hang out in.",
        "Niki: Hey, girl's gotta have a social life, don't she? And Viki never gave me a hell of a lot of time, so I had to cram it in whenever I could. But, listen, I never wanted you to get --",
        "Tess: We are not talking about this right now.",
        "Niki: I think it's time we did.",
        "Tess: God, shut up, shut up! Just get out of my head. Get out of my head!",
        "Niki: Got your attention?",
        "Tess: What do you want?",
        "Niki: I'm going to make things right. How do ya like them apples?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: You want me to stop feeling what I feel for you? Is this because I turned down your proposal?",
        "Todd: No, it has nothing to do with you. You didn't do anything wrong. It's all me.",
        "Marty: I don't know what that means.",
        "Todd: I didn't see this coming. You walk in here in this dress, and you seem so whole, so healed and beautiful and ready to move on. And when I said that it's too much, I meant you. You're just too much. I'm sorry, you're too much of what's good in the world, and I just don't deserve it.",
        "Marty: What are you saying?",
        "Todd: I'm saying you're going to have to let me go before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Fine, okay, you don't trust me? Great, well I'm going to let your, uh, jewelry appraiser friend, here, make an even bigger fool out of you than you already are. Read it and weep.",
        "[Neil chuckles]",
        "Neil: That's a hot little biscuit. Whoa, talk to me. Oh, you are pretty. You're a dirty little girl. Who wants an apple martini? That's right.",
        "Cain: All right, stop ogling the thing and tell me what you think.",
        "Neil: It's a hell of a rock.",
        "Cain: Is it a real rock?",
        "Neil: Oh, yeah, 10 carats at least. Probably royalty. I'm thinking Bavarian.",
        "Tina: Ah, so David Vickers and I will be going.",
        "Cain: No, no, no, no, not yet you won't.",
        "Tina: What now?",
        "Cain: Well, you didn't honestly didn't think I'd hand over your precious little gem here, without Mr. Silver checking the rest of our crown jewels, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: How can you not hate me? I knocked down your friend, Marcie. I put your son in danger. For God sakes, I shot his father.",
        "Gigi: You scared the hell out of me, that's for sure. But you weren't you when you did that, so I can't hate you. What happened to you all those years in Iraq and Afghanistan, that's what put you over the edge, Brody.",
        "Brody: Plenty of other guys went through what I did -- worse. They didn't try to play soldier up on a mountain with a 10-year-old kid. I couldn't keep my thoughts straight. I lost control of my head.",
        "Gigi: That must have been real scary.",
        "Brody: It still doesn't mean it wasn't my fault. Geege, I'm sorry. I can't take any of it back, but I am so sorry.",
        "Gigi: I know. And, Brody, I'm sorry, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: The first thing I want to say to you, Shane, is I'm sorry.",
        "Shane: For what?",
        "Rex: For not being there for you and your mom when you were growing up.",
        "Shane: I thought you didn't know about me.",
        "Rex: I didn't, but I shouldn't have taken off like I did. I didn't even say good-bye to your mom. And even if I had known about you, I can't say what I would've done. There were a few years of my life where I -- where I pretty much sucked as a human being.",
        "Shane: Why are you telling me this?",
        "Rex: Because I don't want you blaming your mom for any of this. What you and your mom went through, that's on me. I wouldn't have made a good dad or husband for anybody -- the way Brody was willing to be. What I'm trying to say, here, Shane, is I get it if you still feel connected to Brody. You spent your whole life thinking that he was your father. And when you met him, he was a pretty cool guy, so don't feel weird if you still feel that way. You're going to get through this, okay? I know it. And not just because you're going to have your mom and me to help you with it, but because you're one of the toughest, most amazing kids I've ever known.",
        "Shane: Exactly how many kids do you know besides me?",
        "Rex: A couple, but none of them are my son. I've never felt more proud or more lucky to have you as my son. So if I can say anything at all that matters, I hope that does.",
        "Shane: So what do we do now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I -- I totally must have lost it, you know? 'Cause I'm seeing you and I -- and I think just heard you say you want to make things right.",
        "Niki: Hmm, well you're not imagining it. Well, you are, but I do.",
        "Tess: It's a little late, don't you think?",
        "Niki: Uh, no. Why else do you think I'm here in your head, talking to you?",
        "Tess: I want Nash. I want Nash. If I could just see Nash, I know that everything would be okay.",
        "Niki: He's not coming, honey.",
        "Tess: He's been here before.",
        "Niki: Yeah, not for a long time. He's gone now.",
        "Tess: Well, you're not here either, so what's your point?",
        "Niki: Okay, I'm guessing the reason you want Nash is that pain in your gut, right?",
        "Tess: I want Nash. I just want you to get out of my head, so Nash can be here.",
        "Niki: What the hell do you think he's going to do for you? I'm the one you need.",
        "Tess: You're the one that's making me sick.",
        "Niki: I'm the one that's going to make you better.",
        "Tess: Just go to hell!",
        "Niki: Tess, avoiding the painful stuff doesn't work. I learned that, you know, up there. You can run, you can't hide. 'Cause the bad stuff, it has a way of sticking, you know, of creeping up on you. And just when you think you got it all beat, boom! It blows up in your face. And that way, it doesn't solve nothing, absolutely nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Timer beeps]",
        "Jared: This is exactly where I want to be.",
        "[Natalie scoffs]",
        "Natalie: Right, locked up in a glass room with a ticking time bomb going off God only knows when?",
        "Jared: I'd pick it over a villa on the Riviera if it meant being with you.",
        "Natalie: I know that's a lie, but it's okay. I like it. You can keep going.",
        "Jared: Seeing that smile is all I need.",
        "Natalie: Jared, no it's not. I mean, we're going to die in here.",
        "Jared: Then we are going to die in each other's arms.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Let you go? We're about to leave town with a baby to raise.",
        "Todd: Not anymore.",
        "Marty: What, this is all up to you? You call the shots? I don't get a say in this?",
        "Todd: No, you had a say, Marty, whether you know it or not. Every time I walk in the room or I tell you one of my stupid jokes, I see the look in your eyes. I know what it is and I don't deserve it from you. I thought I did. But right now -- Marty, you can have whatever you want in the world. You can have whoever you want in the world.",
        "Marty: But I want you.",
        "Todd: Don't.",
        "Todd: You have to go right now. You have to get out of here before it's too late.",
        "Marty: Too late for what?",
        "Todd: Just go, now! Don't look back.",
        "Marty: Why would you want me to go? Your daughter's in labor. We're about to have our baby. Is that what this is about? You've got cold feet? You don't want me to raise this child with you?",
        "Todd: No, I told you, it's not you.",
        "Marty: You know, I'm getting so sick of hearing, \"it's not you, it's me.\"",
        "Todd: Well, that's too bad, because that's what it is. You think I'm some great guy, some white knight in shining armor --",
        "Marty: I don't think you're perfect.",
        "Todd: \"Perfect\" doesn't quite catch it.",
        "Marty: I don't want perfect. I don't want perfect, I want you.",
        "Todd: You could have better.",
        "Marty: And what does that mean?",
        "Todd: It means that -- you don't even know what's out there. You haven't seen the world. You've been here -- I've been keeping you from the world. I mean, you think you don't have anywhere else to go.",
        "Marty: Don't tell me what I think, and don't tell me what I feel. I stay here because I want to be here. I could have left weeks ago, but I didn't because I chose you. So tell me, why are you suddenly not choosing me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I was the one who chose not to know what happened to Jessica for all those years, so the blame lies with me.",
        "Clint: That is like blaming Jessica for whatever happened to Natalie and Jared, and I know you don't feel that way.",
        "Viki: No, I don't, but it still comes back to me, Clint. Even when the girls were born -- it wasn't Niki who let Mitch Lawrence take Natalie away, it was me because I was so horrified by the thought that he had fathered one of them.",
        "Clint: That was Mitch's fault, not yours. He drugged you and raped you.",
        "Viki: Jessica's his daughter.",
        "Clint: She's my daughter -- mine. I love Jessica and Natalie just the same, even though lately I haven't shown much love at all to Natalie.",
        "Viki: Neither have I. But you know what? We'll get them back. And when we do, we will tell them that we love them and we will tell them every single day.",
        "Clint: Viki, everybody we love we shouldn't take for granted, because every day, you never know. You know, the only thing that Natalie did was fall in love. And to my mind, that was such a crime, I couldn't stop punishing her.",
        "Viki: I know, I know, me, too. But I was so upset for Jessica.",
        "Clint: I would give anything to be able to have the chance to tell Natalie I'm sorry.",
        "Viki: I know, me, too. And we just have to pray that we get the chance. We can't give up.",
        "Clint: I'm not giving up, but I can't take this. I just want to be able to do something -- do anything.",
        "Viki: We've got to find Tess. We have to find her soon, and we have to stop her before she does something she can't take back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Niki: So what's it going to be, huh? You going to keep blaming the world for your problems forever?",
        "Tess: My -- my problems?",
        "Niki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tess: You mean the ones that you caused? You mean the reason that Jessica created me in the first place because she was too sweet and wonderful to deal with it on her own. I don't blame the world, Niki, I blame you. What kind of person takes a little girl to a roadside bar and leaves her alone so the pervert in the house next door can rape her?!",
        "Niki: Same kind of person who tries to kill her own sister?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Maybe we could disconnect the wires.",
        "Jared: Ah, that might set it off.",
        "Natalie: I know, but --",
        "Jared: And what if we have more time than we think, you know? Do you want to risk losing that? Losing each other, if there is the smallest shred of hope left?",
        "Natalie: I can't just sit around here and wait to die.",
        "Jared: Then let's not, and say we did.",
        "Natalie: Don't make me laugh.",
        "Jared: Okay, okay. You don't want to sit around and wait. Well, I think there's a better way to pass the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: I can't believe you let Shane come see me.",
        "Gigi: He wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Brody: I appreciate it more than I can tell you.",
        "Gigi: Well, it seems like it was a very good thing for Shane, too.",
        "Brody: He must have been so scared. That poor kid.",
        "Gigi: Yeah, I'm -- I'm doing everything I can, but I think he may need to see someone else -- someone with training, you know.",
        "Brody: You'll do right by him. You always have, no matter what you think.",
        "Gigi: Well, there's something I want to do for you, too.",
        "Brody: You don't owe me anything.",
        "Gigi: But see, I do, because you were there for me when I needed someone. You showed up for me when I was a kid and scared and pregnant. What happened after that was not our fault. And then you showed up for me again, and you took care of Shane, even though I was out looking for Rex. And I will never forget all that.",
        "Brody: Yeah, but I messed up plenty, too. I phonied up that DNA test.",
        "Gigi: I know, and I wanted to wring your neck -- more than once. But I always knew, bottom line, you loved my kid. I know why I love him, but you didn't have to. You put all your own stuff aside so you could help Shane and me. You didn't leave me alone when you could have, so that's why I'm not going to leave you alone now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: The first time I met you, I said to myself, \"now, that's a great kid.\" But how could you not be with a mom like yours, right?",
        "Shane: And I wasn't so great to you sometimes.",
        "Rex: Well, before Brody came back, we were pretty good -- at least I thought we were.",
        "Shane: I saw how much my mom was into you. I wanted you to break up with Adriana, so you could be with my mom and be my --",
        "Rex: But I -- I didn't. And then Brody came back. And I get it -- he's the only guy you ever knew as your dad.",
        "Shane: Until now.",
        "Rex: Shane, I already love you. And I'm not saying that I'm sitting here waiting for you to feel the same way about me. I know this is not what you wanted, and I know it's going to be a long time before you can even think about feeling the same way about me, but maybe we just give it some time and see where it goes. All I'm asking, if you'll let me, is a chance to be your dad, too. What's that?",
        "Shane: Oh, my dad -- Brody, he just gave it to me. It's a silver star.",
        "Rex: Well, that was nice of him. What's it for?",
        "Shane: It's for valor. He says that that means courage.",
        "Rex: Well, he gave it to the right man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: You had one of the jewels checked -- the biggest one. And it was worth a fortune, right?",
        "Neil: I wouldn't kick it out of bed.",
        "Tina: Now you want me to wait around here while you check every last one of them?",
        "Cain: Damn straight, princess.",
        "Neil: Might as well -- you paid for the whole afternoon.",
        "Tina: No, it is not going to happen. What, you want to know if those jewels are fake? You want to know? They are! Fine, are you happy?",
        "Cain: No, I'm not happy. But I am satisfied, okay? So just tell me, please, where are the real jewels?",
        "Tina: I don't care, because they don't matter anymore, you got it? Because I have had it. I've had enough. I mean, I have been lied to. I have been yelled at. I have been threatened, and I have been blackmailed, and it is going to stop. You know, I have been made to feel like I have to lie, just -- just to get by. And you know what? There are people whose lives are in danger because I have been too scared to help them, and that is going to stop. It's going to stop right now. So you want the jewels -- fine! You can have them, because I am leaving and I am taking my little dog with me because nobody else is going to push me around. David Vickers, are you okay?",
        "[Dog whimpers]",
        "Tina: What's wrong -- what did you do to my dog?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: Tess was right about one thing, and it's what she said about Nash, that whether he had five minutes or five days, he wouldn't waste any of it. I don't want to waste any time left with you, not kissing you and touching you and making love to you.",
        "Natalie: Jared, you're right. I mean, if this is the last moments we have together, I want to be loving you, too.",
        "Natalie: If someone rescues us, this could be a little embarrassing.",
        "Jared: I can deal with that. And if they don't, well, what a way to go, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: No. No, don't you turn this around on me. My so-called sister and her boyfriend? They deserve to die.",
        "Niki: No, no, nobody deserves to die, not even a figment of your imagination. Hell, you're talking to me, ain't ya?",
        "Tess: What do you want from me? What, you want me to say that I hate you? I do, I hate you! I wish I could wipe your smug face off the planet, but I can't because you don't exist anymore.",
        "Niki: Bingo.",
        "Tess: \"Bingo\" what?",
        "Niki: You hate me. You want me dead. You want to put me in a basement with a ticking bomb.",
        "Tess: No.",
        "Niki: But you can't, because I don't exist. Tess, you got cheated out of going after me, so you had to go after somebody else instead.",
        "Tess: No, no. No, they deserved it. They got what was coming to them.",
        "Niki: No, no. Maybe I deserved it, not Natalie and Jared, and you know it. What are you going to do about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: This is wrong. I was wrong, and I don't want to ruin you. Just go. Just go, and get as far away from me as you can.",
        "Marty: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Todd: Yeah, why not?",
        "Marty: Because I just learned to walk, and I can't run in these shoes. Oh, and there's this other little bit. I'm in love with you. So the only way I'm going to go out that door is if you can tell me that you don't love me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: What's wrong with David Vickers? He's so fat. Cain Rogan, I swear to you if you did something to hurt my dog, you're going to be missing more than the royal jewels.",
        "Neil: Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think I know why this dog is panting.",
        "Tina: Why, what -- what is it?",
        "Neil: Well, listen, I know diamonds better than I know dogs, but, uh, this dog's in labor.",
        "Tina and Cain: Labor?",
        "Neil: Yeah, take it from a guy in three paternity suits. I know pregnant when I see it.",
        "Tina: Well -- well, what are you saying?",
        "Cain: Um, darling, I think he's saying that David Vickers is a bitch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Thanks, Shane, for talking with me.",
        "Shane: Well, we had to talk sometime, didn't we?",
        "Rex: Yeah, I guess we did. But your mom and I wanted it to be on your clock, not ours. So for me, it feels a little ahead of schedule, so, thanks. Hey, when I get back on my feet, why don't -- why don't we go out for some hot dogs or something?",
        "Shane: I love hot dogs.",
        "Rex: Yeah, somebody told me that. How about we shake on it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Thank you for calling. Yeah, bye. Addie Cramer -- Starr's in labor. They've taken her to the delivery room.",
        "Clint: Is everything okay?",
        "Viki: Apparently, yeah. I should be there.",
        "Clint: Look, if you want to go, go. I'll take care of things here.",
        "Viki: I don't know if I can, I mean, with everything that's going on here.",
        "Clint: All we're doing is waiting for the phone to ring. And if something happens, I know where to find you.",
        "Viki: Yeah. Maybe I'll just -- I'll just check in the E.R., you know. Oh, Clint.",
        "Clint: They're going to be okay. You said it yourself.",
        "Viki: I know, but the more time that passes --",
        "Clint: We are going to get them back, all right? Now, you take your own advice. Don't give up.",
        "Viki: No, they'll be all right. We'll see the girls again. We will. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: So what are you saying? You want me to go and save Natalie and Jared?",
        "Niki: Well, somewhere deep inside, you know that it's wrong, don't you?",
        "Tess: No. No, they killed Nash.",
        "Niki: That was an accident.",
        "Tess: If they hadn't done what they had done, then --",
        "Niki: Tess, come on, not even you are buying that anymore. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here in your head talking to you. Come on. We're going to go to that basement, just you and me, okay? And you're going to let Natalie and Jared out, and then you're going to put me inside, which is what you wanted to do all along, okay? You're going to lock me up with all that pain and anger and hurt, and you can blow us all to kingdom come. Hey, if you don't want to do it for yourself and your sister, do it for that baby you're carrying, you know, and do it for the one that's at home, crying for her mama. I'm talking about Bree. Don't do to her what I did to you. Come on. Let's go do it, all right? Then you can focus on what's important. I won't let you down again, I promise you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't say that to me, Marty. Don't tell me you love me.",
        "Marty: Why, because you don't feel the same way?",
        "Todd: I do feel the same way. It's true, God help me. I love you.",
