        "Bo: Yeah, and you love me.",
        "Nora: Yes.",
        "Bo: Yeah, so that's out there now. That -- that doesn't go away.",
        "Nora: I know.",
        "Bo: But you're going home to Clint. Are you running away from us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Eli: You know I'm right, T\u00e9a. Sooner or later, you're going to have to tell Danielle who her real father is.",
        "T\u00e9a: All I know is, right now, I have to get her out of here. How long does it take to pack?",
        "Eli: She's a teenage girl. And she's furious at you. I'm sure she's in no hurry.",
        "T\u00e9a: All I've been hearing about for months is how much she hates it here.",
        "Eli: Yeah. It doesn't mean she wants to leave with you. Especially since she found out my brother was here looking for her yesterday.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's why I have to get her out of here. If he gets his hands on her, I'll never see my little girl again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matthew: Destiny, what -- what are you doing here?",
        "Destiny: I figured out where you were from your phone message. Your brother David and I hopped on a plane.",
        "Matthew: You and David? Get out of here.",
        "Destiny: I was so worried. Your parents finally told me where they stashed you. What's with the luggage? Are you going somewhere?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: Jeff, hi.",
        "Jeff: You're off tonight.",
        "Gigi: Yes. I just need my paycheck, fast.",
        "Jeff: I'm not sure if they're here yet.",
        "Gigi: Oh, could you look?",
        "Jeff: What's your hurry?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nadine: He's out?",
        "Corrine: Well, it looks like. Rex? Rex? You must have used enough to drug a moose.",
        "Nadine: Well, the last thing we need is him waking up.",
        "Corrine: Well, I don't need him dead, either.",
        "[Nadine sighs]",
        "Nadine: He's fine. The hard part's over.",
        "Corrine: Oh, what? You mean lying to my only nephew who never did me wrong in his whole life?",
        "Nadine: Yeah, that part.",
        "Corrine: Why?",
        "Nadine: Just don't ask. We have our instructions. That's all we can think about right now.",
        "Corrine: Right. Keeping Rex away from Natalie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Now I wish Rex was here. I mean, I understand about his Aunt Corrine, but still --",
        "Jessica: Maybe he emailed.",
        "Natalie: Rex?",
        "Jessica: Brody. I can never get reception here.",
        "Natalie: Well, maybe that's why Jared hasn't called.",
        "Jessica: If he's here, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: It has to be him. I mean, why else would he have mapped out the route to -- to Napa on that motel computer? Plus, that coffee pot was still warm. Someone's here.",
        "Jessica: Or it's the guy pretending to be Nash.",
        "Natalie: It's sick, I know. I'm really sorry.",
        "Jessica: I just don't understand why I can't get ahold of him.",
        "Natalie: You know what? I'm sure that he handled his sister's problems. He's now probably back in Llanview --",
        "Jessica: He would have called me, Natalie -- if he could.",
        "Natalie: Are you afraid that something's happened to Brody?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brody groans]",
        "Nadine: Okay, come on. Yes, he's your darling nephew. I just did the same thing to my only brother. You know a way out of it?",
        "Corrine: I'll take his feet.",
        "Nadine: Okay.",

        "Nadine: Ugh -- okay. Can you take him from here?",
        "Corrine: Yeah.",

        "Nora: Oh. You should have heard Clint on the phone just now.",
        "Bo: What did he say?",
        "Nora: Everything right.",
        "Bo: Well, I mean, he can do that sometimes. But that's all it took?",
        "Nora: It was like a big dose of reality that just hit me in the face.",
        "Bo: We're not real?",
        "Nora: No. No, we're not -- not here. Certainly not here. We're in, like, this little cocoon here. Here, Clint and our life in Llanview -- it doesn't even exist, you know?",
        "Bo: Yeah.",
        "Nora: I -- I can't kiss you and tell you that I love you when I'm married to your brother.",
        "Bo: I still can't believe you're married.",
        "Nora: Well, I am.",
        "Bo: It never felt real.",
        "Nora: Oh, I should have stopped the wedding.",
        "Bo: Yeah, I thought you were going to, you know? Five times, but -- hell, I thought I was going to stop it.",
        "Nora: Yeah, I did, too.",
        "Bo: And I should have. But, you know, you married my brother.",
        "Nora: And we both love him.",
        "Bo: So what's going on, red? Is that it?",
        "Nora: What?",
        "Bo: I mean, did we miss, you know? Tough luck? Is it too late for us?",

        "Matthew: [Whispers] I'm busting out.",
        "Destiny: Shut up.",
        "Matthew: I have to.",

        "Dani: Matthew?",
        "Matthew: Oh, sorry. Des, this is Dani.",
        "Destiny: The girl with the phone?",
        "Dani: Yeah, the girl who needs to get out of here now.",
        "Matthew: Her mom showed up and wants to ship her off tonight.",
        "Dani: So we have to leave, like, 10 minutes ago. She'll have armed guards down here any minute.",
        "Destiny: Intense.",
        "Matthew: Yeah. I still can't believe you're here.",
        "Dani: Matthew, we have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Did you see any security when we came in here?",
        "Eli: No, now that you mention it.",
        "T\u00e9a: So how can the headmistress talk about how airtight this joint is?",
        "Eli: Well, beats me. I don't know anything about this place.",
        "T\u00e9a: I mean, Ross slipped through security last night.",
        "Eli: Yeah, but they caught him and got him out.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, God. If he had seen Daniella, or she had seen him...she adores him. She would have gone anywhere with him, no questions asked.",
        "Eli: Of course she would. She thinks he's her father.",
        "T\u00e9a: And that is the only reason to tell her the truth.",
        "Eli: T\u00e9a, come on. How long do you honestly think you can keep a lid on this?",
        "T\u00e9a: Just give me a break here with that, okay, Eli?",
        "Eli: Fine.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, how am I supposed to tell Daniella that Ross is not her father without telling her that Todd is?",
        "Eli: You can't.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, she'll want to see him. What do I say to her then, huh?",
        "Eli: You'll figure something out. Meanwhile, I am going to fly the two of you out of here. Where are you going?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no. Uh-uh, uh-uh.",
        "Eli: Why not? Don't you trust me?",
        "T\u00e9a: I've made enough decisions for Daniella. I'm not going to make that mistake again. I'll give her a few choices. Where the hell is she?",

        "Schuyler: Hi.",
        "Gigi: Hey.",
        "Schuyler: How's it going?",
        "Gigi: Good. Great. I'm just here to pick up my check.",
        "Schuyler: Yeah? Then what?",
        "Gigi: Uh -- guess I'll go home and watch the election results. They said on the radio that it's close.",
        "Schuyler: Uh-huh. So this is it?",
        "Gigi: What?",
        "Schuyler: Soon, we'll be talking about the weather and pretending we're not even friends?",
        "Gigi: Schuyler, I came way too close to crossing the line. I can't let it be more.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, you ever wonder why it's such a struggle if you're sure you don't want me?",
        "Gigi: I'm going out of town. Okay? For a few days. Rex is in Michigan taking care of his sick aunt, and I'm going to go help him.",

        "Nadine: Hello?",
        "John: Nadine Lovett?",
        "Nadine: Who are you?",
        "John: Detective John McBain, Llanview police department. I work with your brother Brody. I had a case in the area. He told me to drop by.",
        "Nadine: Oh. Well, Detective --",
        "John: John.",
        "Nadine: John, you just missed him.",
        "John: You got to be kidding me.",
        "Nadine: No. He left for Llanview a few hours ago.",
        "John: That's funny; he said he'd be here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Maybe Brody called the house.",
        "Natalie: Look, it's going to be okay. Jared should be here soon.",
        "Jessica: And that's supposed to fix everything, Natalie? I can't reach Brody. Someone's impersonating my dead husband. And what, everything's going to be fine once your homicidal husband shows up?",
        "Natalie: Whoa! Jared didn't kill anyone. He didn't!",
        "Jessica: The last two people he ran scams with are dead! And now he's disappeared.",
        "Natalie: That's because he knows. He knows that John is dying to pin all of this on him.",
        "Jessica: We never should have stayed here alone, Natalie. We should have called the cops like you told Rex that we would. We are sitting ducks here, Natalie!",
        "Natalie: No, we're not!",
        "Jessica: Do you get that? God! Rex never would have left if he hadn't known that you didn't call John.",
        "Natalie: It wouldn't help!",
        "Jessica: I shouldn't have let that happen.",
        "Natalie: What are you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm calling John. I don't care what you say.",
        "Jessica: Natalie, I'm calling John. Enough's enough.",
        "Natalie: Okay, please -- please don't. Jared didn't kill anyone.",
        "Jessica: Well, then John will give him a fair shot.",
        "Natalie: Really? Really? You think John's going to give my husband a chance? He's convinced that he's guilty, and how in the world is Jared going to prove he's innocent while he's locked up?",
        "Jessica: Well, he'll have a lawyer, won't he?",
        "Natalie: The case will be closed. There won't be any more questions. Do you want to find out who's pretending to be Nash? Do you want to find out --",
        "Jessica: Yes, of course I do. Of course.",
        "Natalie: Okay. Then give us a chance to find out before John gets involved and shuts us down.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Natalie: Thank you. Well, what are you -- what are you doing?",
        "Jessica: I am going to call John to see if he's heard from Brody and see if he has any news about Jared. Don't worry. I won't tell him where we are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nadine: Well, I don't know what Brody said, but he's not here.",
        "John: That's the damnedest thing. He knew I was coming by. We were going to talk about -- oh, wait a minute, I get it.",
        "Nadine: What?",
        "John: Oh, it's -- it's this thing we do. He's testing me.",
        "Nadine: Oh, I don't think he's playing anything.",
        "John: Oh, trust me, he's still around. If you give me two minutes, I'll find him.",
        "Nadine: Hey, you can't just burst in --",
        "John: Relax. It's just this little game we play.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "John: That's probably Brody now.",
        "Nadine: Well, he doesn't have that number.",
        "John: Aren't you going to answer it?",
        "[John's cell phone rings]",

        "Corrine: Oh, he just stepped out for a minute. I'll tell him you called.",
        "Gigi: You sound bad, Ms. Balsom. What have the doctors told you?",
        "Corrine: Oh -- oh, you know doctors.",
        "Gigi: Yeah. It can get confusing. Look, I'm on the next plane out there, so --",

        "T\u00e9a: Well, where's Daniella? She's not here.",
        "Headmistress: It hasn't been that long. Daniella's accumulated the usual number of extra things that teenage girls generally --",

        "Headmistress: Miss Delgado, there's no need for --",
        "T\u00e9a: [British accent] No, no, no, there is every need. [Normal voice] You told me yourself that your security forces had to drag my ex-husband out of here last night. My daughter is not safe here.",
        "Headmistress: Now, really --",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no, you listen to me. You get your security forces -- your famous security forces to go to her room and ask for her back here immediately!",
        "Headmistress: As you wish.",
        "Eli: T\u00e9a --",
        "T\u00e9a: Shut up! Just shut up! This is all your fault.",

        "Destiny: But everything's changed. Shaun woke up.",
        "Matthew: Really? That's amazing.",
        "Destiny: Yeah, he's awake. He's good. Greg really did save him.",
        "Matthew: And so did you. Greg gave up, but you didn't. I mean, Rachel must -- wait, Rachel knows about Shaun, right?",
        "Destiny: Sure.",
        "Matthew: Which means my parents know.",
        "Destiny: Yeah.",
        "Matthew: They lied to me about that, too?",
        "Destiny: That doesn't matter anymore. I'll bet Greg will do your surgery now. You don't have to go to Seattle. You can come back to Llanview with me.",

I remember every single word I said. I remember every single word you said. I remember every single word that Little Richard said.",

        "Bo: No, no, but, Nora, that's over.",
        "Nora: No, but that's how we got here, Bo. That's how we got broken.",
        "Bo: But it doesn't matter. I still want to grow old with you.",
        "Nora: God, we sound like a lot of fun, huh?",
        "Bo: No, come on. You know what I'm saying.",
        "Nora: I know. Yeah. What happens if something gets in the way again?",
        "Bo: Well, it could.",
        "Nora: The last thing I want to do is make a promise that is not going to be kept.",

        "T\u00e9a: Listen, it's not your fault. I know what I said before, but it's my fault. It's my fault for having stayed with Ross too long. If I lose her, I'll have no one to blame but myself.",
