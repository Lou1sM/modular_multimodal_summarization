        "Antonio tries to call Nash but doesn't get an answer. Clint and Cris offer to head out there to see what is up with the man who is reported to be upset over something. When they get to Nash's place, he has a fire going, and there is beer everywhere. Antonio soon figures it out. They made a bachelor party for him, even though he said he didn't want one. They all get a beer and sit by the fire to enjoy some male bonding. There are a few moments of awkward silence and the Cris speaks. \"Are we bonding yet?\" Jessica, Viki and Natalie sit and have a few drinks. Roxy heard there was a party for the ladies and she shows up but it disappointed to hear there are going to be no strippers. They decide to have some Cosmos, but Jessica has an inkling for something with Vodka in it. \"Vodka?\" Viki comments. \"Isn't that something that Tess would drink?\" David goes to see Hugh and Paige takes that time to go and get something to eat. When alone with Hugh David starts talking to the man, apologizing for making him sign the document that he had with him. He tells that the document isn't any good anyway. He tells Hugh that he is lucky that he lived as John was in the same accident and died. Hugh has a bad reaction to the news and manages to say, \"No! No!\" David finds this very strange and just stares at the man. Adriana and Blair also attend the party with gifts and its drinks all around. Roxy's gift is so scandalous that Jessica is afraid to take it out of the box. At the bachelor party, Antonio wonders if they can get pizzas out there at that time of night. \"Well then my timing is good then.\" Todd is in the doorway with goodies in paper bags. Rex apologizes knowing that the reason that Todd is there is because he let on where the party was. David takes Hugh's rambling to mean that the man doesn't feel like himself and nothing more. He understands and promises to bring some cannolis the next time that he returns. When alone in the room again, Hugh makes a statement. \"I'm not Hugh!\" Kevin and Kelly talk and decide that the only way to have a family is to move out of Llanview. Jessica is worried about how the wedding is going to affect Natalie but Natalie says that she will be fine.",
        "\"John would want it that way!\" Lemon Drop Shots are brought to the table for Jessica but she doesn't drink them and has champagne instead. After the party is over, everyone leaves. Jessica is at the table alone. She grabs a Lemon Drop Shot and tosses it back when no one is listening. \"See Tess? I told you. This is going to be my wedding!\" At the bachelor party, all toast to 'love'. Everyone's happy but Nash over this"

        "Antonio: Well, he's not answering and his voicemail's not picking up.",
        "Clint: Hey, when I talked to him, he -- well, he sounded as if he had had a couple.",
        "Antonio: I just saw him earlier and he said he was laying off the booze.",
        "Cristian: Maybe he changed his mind. I really hope he didn't hurt himself.",
        "Antonio: Huh. And since when do you care? I mean, you don't even like the guy.",
        "Cristian: Well, like you said, he's Bree's father.",
        "Antonio: Fine. I'll go back out there.",
        "Clint: No, we'll -- we'll all go.",
        "Antonio: Why do we all need to go?",
        "Cristian: Look, Antonio, you're marrying Jess tomorrow instead of him marrying Tess. I think you're the last guy he wants to see right now.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, we need somebody to go there, make sure he doesn't get tanked up and then do something stupid at the wedding, and I'm just saying it might be more than a one-man job.",
        "Cristian: That's right.",
        "Antonio: All right, I'm sold. Let me say goodbye to Jess.",
        "Clint: All right, but there's one more thing -- I don't want Jessie worrying about Nash on the night before her wedding, so would it be all right if Cristian -- why don't you tell a little white lie to the ladies to get us out of here?",
        "Cristian: Ok. Sure.",
        "Antonio: All right.",
        "Cristian: Excuse me, ladies. Sorry to interrupt. Jess, Antonio finally came to his senses and he's going out with us for a couple of drinks.",
        "Viki: Ooh.",
        "Jessica: Well, what's wrong with here? Why can't you just drink here?",
        "Clint: No, no, no, no. He can't relax at his own club, you know. Oh, you two girls, would you drive your mother home?",
        "Viki: I'll drive.",
        "Antonio: Uh, well, I -- I guess this is it.",
        "Jessica: I guess it is.",
        "Antonio: Next time I see you will be on the altar. Save the rest for tomorrow.",
        "Jessica: Hmm. Have fun.",
        "Antonio: Thanks. Bye, ladies.",
        "Viki: Bye.",
        "Clint: Good night.",
        "Cristian: Good night.",
        "Natalie: Good night.",
        "Jessica: Um -- are they up to something?",
        "Viki: I don't know.",
        "Jessica: No, no, it -- dad's up to something.",
        "Viki: You think? I have no idea what that could be.",
        "Nash: Guess I better do what I got to do, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Hey.",
        "Paige: David. What are you doing here?",
        "David: I'm being a thoughtful uncle.",
        "Paige: Oh, that is very sweet, but he is sleeping.",
        "David: Hmm. All those medical bills piling up? It's too bad that it turns out that Spencer isn't Asa Buchanan's son, which makes him his grandson, huh?",
        "Paige: Are they absolutely sure that Spencer's not a Buchanan?",
        "David: Oh, yeah, they're sure.",
        "Paige: So everything he did to Bo's family was based on a lie?",
        "David: Oh, Spencer's a bastard, but it has nothing to do with Asa Buchanan. My brother is a self-made man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: Oh, I can't believe it. I really thought that I was going to be able to give Todd some good news.",
        "Adriana: I know.",
        "Rex: I mean, if a lawyer was involved, there has to be some kind of paper trail.",
        "Adriana: The one with all the answers is Spencer Truman. Do you think he'll ever tell Todd where his baby is? No. Right.",
        "Rex: This is the one thing Truman still has over Todd. He'll never give it up.",
        "Adriana: I'm proud of you for staying on the case.",
        "Rex: When I locate this kid, everybody will know me not as that punk Rex, but as a good P.I. plus there's this little kid living out the with people who were picked out for him by Spencer Truman and a shady lawyer. Todd's not going to give up until he finds his baby. Neither will I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Well, it looks like nothing is really broken here, Todd.",
        "Todd: Oh, I'm sorry about that. I just, you know, got so much on my mind. I've got this Spencer trial and I've got my kid to find and I'm policing Rex all the time. Obviously this guy who got rid of my kid was no rookie and -- I don't know. It seems like this guy is probably out of Rex's league.",
        "Blair: I think Rex was right about the attorney Spencer hired, though.",
        "Todd: Well, maybe, but I just wish he'd have figured it out before the guy died and all his records were destroyed.",
        "Blair: Oh. Rex is not going to back down.",
        "Todd: No, not if I keep paying him.",
        "Blair: I think it's more than that. I think Rex really cares about helping you.",
        "Todd: Why?",
        "Blair: Because he's a nice human being that really cares about helping you find your child, Todd. And you can laugh, and maybe you think that that is, you know, something that you're not like, but -- what? Not everyone is as cold and as ruthless as you can be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: He's just so tiny.",
        "Kevin: Yeah. He's still going to be tiny when they send him home, too. You're going to have your hands full.",
        "Kelly: Well, I'm sure Dorian will hire an army of nannies. Huh.",
        "Kevin: You going back to her place?",
        "Kelly: Yeah -- probably. You know, I mean, with a preemie, I need as much help as I can get.",
        "Kevin: You know, I've been having this crazy thought lately.",
        "Kelly: What?",
        "Kevin: What if the person that helps you with Zane is me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: If I'm so cold and ruthless, what are you hanging around for?",
        "Blair: Because I've had a few ruthless moments myself.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you are a bitch.",
        "Blair: You're a bastard.",
        "Todd: Check this out.",
        "Blair: \"Million-dollar baby. Publisher Todd Manning is offering a reward of $1 million to anyone with information leading to the return of his son.\" A million dollars?",
        "Todd: Well, he is my son.",
        "Blair: I think it needs a stronger headline.",
        "Todd: No, I like it.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. And I know what else you like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Hey, what are you looking for?",
        "Rex: That list of people with the same car that Spencer Truman was seen getting into with that baby. I mean, what if our lawyer friend was the wrong guy? What if I just jumped on him because it made the most sense?",
        "Adriana: You didn't. Everyone else was either out of town or 90 years old.",
        "Rex: Yeah, I know. I guess I'm just hoping I missed something.",
        "Adriana: It has to be the lawyer.",
        "Rex: And there has to be a way to get the information, even without his records.",
        "Adriana: Whew.",
        "Rex: You know what? Think I know what that way is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Ok, let's talk about your dress.",
        "Jessica: Ah.",
        "Viki: Is it everything you hoped it would be, honey?",
        "Jessica: Oh, more. It's so beautiful. The second I put it on, I could picture myself being married in it.",
        "Viki: Yay!",
        "Natalie: Yes, and same with the bridesmaids' dresses, too. I mean, I think everyone is going to look so good in them.",
        "Viki: I agree.",
        "Jessica: I was going to ask you if there's anything at all that I could do tomorrow to make things easier for you.",
        "Natalie: Yes -- stop worrying about me a please enjoy yourself tomorrow. You deserve it. It's what John would want for you, too.",
        "Viki: You know, the mother of the bride has absolutely nothing to do on the day of the wedding except smile, so if you need to talk, you come to me, ok?",
        "Natalie: I will, thank you. Ok, ok, to tomorrow.",
        "Viki: To tomorrow.",
        "Jessica: Tomorrow.",
        "Viki: Cheers, cheers to tomorrow.",
        "Jessica: Um -- hmm. Sorry, I -- Um --",
        "Viki: What?",
        "Jessica: Your wedding ring -- are you not wearing it anymore?",
        "Viki: Uh -- no, not on my left hand, no. I have it here. You know, darling, my -- my husband is with God and so, technically, I'm not married anymore.",
        "Natalie: Mom and I sort of had a deal, that I would take my engagement ring off that John never had a chance to give me, and I put it in my jewelry box.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but mom had a lot more time to deal with this than you did. Are you sure you're not moving too soon?",
        "Natalie: Well, there's a fine line to walk between moving too soon and not facing reality. You know, an engagement ring is supposed to mean that you're getting married, and I'm not -- at least not to John, anyway.",
        "Viki: Hey, you know what? Our lives are not over.",
        "Jessica: Well, speaking of that, does dad know that you're not wearing your wedding ring anymore? Are you moving on?",
        "Viki: What has dad got to do with it?",
        "Jessica: You tell me.",
        "Viki: Oh, for heaven's sakes.",
        "Roxy: Hey, chicas. Are we, like, ready to party?",
        "Natalie: Hey, Roxy.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Viki: Roxanne. What -- what a surprise.",
        "Roxy: I was so happy when you called up and said that you gals finally came to your senses and you were going to have a bachelorette party after all.",
        "Viki: Oh, yeah.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry -- a what?",
        "Viki: It's a surprise --",
        "Roxy: Scooch, scooch.",
        "Viki: And don't you look festive.",
        "Roxy: Ha, thanks.",
        "Natalie: Well, I thought it'd be fun to have Roxy here.",
        "Viki: Yes. Well, the more, the merrier.",
        "Natalie: Well, you know we needed some fun at this party, and when Roxy puts her mind to it, she is fun.",
        "Roxy: Hallelujah, sisters. Ok, how about if we change this wake into a party? Hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Well, whatever Nash is drinking, he could probably put it down.",
        "Cristian: What are you talking about?",
        "Antonio: He could burn e place down.",
        "Cristian: Jeez.",
        "Antonio: You know, I mean, the last time we were here, we put this wall up when we were drinking a couple of bottles of water. Hey, somebody's got a tub full of sodas, beer.",
        "Nash: Almost like somebody was planning a party, huh?",
        "Antonio: What?",
        "Clint: The bachelor party you never wanted. This is it.",
        "Cristian: Whoa, you did say you didn't want to go to a bar.",
        "Antonio: You did this, didn't you? You set me up. You know, I should've smelled this a mile away -- \"we should all go.\" You -- that's cute.",
        "Nash: Actually, it was me.",
        "Antonio: You?",
        "Nash: Ah, come on. Four guys, bucket of beer, no strippers -- not what I'd call a crazy night.",
        "Antonio: All right, why -- why did you do this?",
        "Nash: Well, after you left, I started thinking. If I was getting married tomorrow, would you do the same thing for me?",
        "Antonio: Actually, no. No, I don't think I would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You know what I don't understand is, why would our mom lie about that? She loved us. Why would she make up a story about having a child with Asa?",
        "Paige: I don't know.",
        "David: Well, whatever her reasons were, sure screwed up Spencer. Ruined my brother's entire life.",
        "Paige: Yeah, and now he's on trial for murder. Is that hard for you to watch?",
        "David: What, are you kidding? I want a front-row seat. I wouldn't miss this for the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roxy: So? When does everyone else show up?",
        "Natalie: Um, this is just about it, maybe one more.",
        "Roxy: Aren't these customers going to mind when the stripper goes into his act?",
        "Viki: No stripper.",
        "Roxy: No telegram delivery man?",
        "Viki: No.",
        "Roxy: No hot exterminator with a thong under his jumpsuit?",
        "Natalie: Roxy, I'm in mourning.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, I'm very upset about no stripper, too. Maybe we should just drink ourselves silly.",
        "Viki: Can't drink, Roxy -- you know, heart transplant?",
        "Roxy: Liquor goes to your heart? It goes someplace completely different on me.",
        "Natalie: Well, I think we need some sort of celebration.",
        "Jessica: You know what? I agree.",
        "Roxy: Ok. How about cosmos because they pack a real good punch but they go down easy? And, Vik, they do wonders for the bladder.",
        "Viki: Oh, I'm going to remember that, thank you.",
        "Jessica: Um -- cosmos sound great. Actually, you know what? Those look interesting.",
        "Roxy: Ooh, that's my kind of science project.",
        "Jessica: Or you know what's great? Lemon drops.",
        "Natalie: You like those, Jess?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. They're these shots. They're, you know, a little sweet, a little sour, and a whole lot of vodka.",
        "Viki: Lemon drop shots. I guess Tess liked those, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: Come on. If I was getting married tomorrow, you wouldn't throw a bachelor party for me?",
        "Antonio: Well, that depends on who you were marrying.",
        "Nash: It's a good answer, moot point. Antonio, things are what they are. Everybody, grab a beer, whatever, and we'll all drink to your happiness. Ahem.",
        "Antonio: Ah.",
        "Clint: Well, there's nothing like a fire in a barrel to help along the male bonding.",
        "Cristian: So, are we bonding yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You mean that? You want to be a part of Zane's life?",
        "Kevin: Of course I do.",
        "Kelly: Well, that would be amazing. It would be beyond belief.",
        "Kevin: I mean, think about it. If I'm not there, then Dorian is going to be all over this little guy.",
        "Kelly: Huh.",
        "Kevin: She's going to have him hating me and my whole family before he speaks his first word.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, well, that may happen anyway regardless of whether you're around or not.",
        "Kevin: You're not angry at me for making her leave tonight, are you?",
        "Kelly: No. I'm -- I'm tired of the constant little remarks and innuendos about the Buchanans. It's like a broken record. It just keeps playing over and over and over again.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, she is right about the way I treated you, you know.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, well, she doesn't know what you were going through at that time. I do.",
        "Kevin: Well, one thing I know about Dorian is that she loves you very much. And now you have a son who's a Buchanan. I mean, how is she supposed to handle that?",
        "Kelly: What do you care?",
        "Kevin: I just don't want you torn between Dorian and me. You know, if you want to move out to a place of your own, then I'll hire a baby nurse or -- or a nanny if you want. I mean, if you want, you could move back into the carriage house.",
        "Kelly: Are you asking me to move back in with you?",
        "Kevin: Oh, no, no. I mean, I -- I wouldn't have to be there, you know.",
        "Kelly: Oh, great. I -- I misunderstood.",
        "Kevin: Ok. If I did ask you to move back in with me, I mean, is that something that's even possible?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Todd: Saved by the bell.",
        "Blair: Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.",
        "Todd: Yeah?",
        "Rex: I've been thinking.",
        "Todd: That's not what I pay you for.",
        "Rex: There might still be a way to locate your kid through that lawyer.",
        "Todd: Keep talking.",
        "Rex: All right, if he did this for Spencer, he didn't do it out of the goodness of his heart. I'm going to check his bank records, passport, credit cards, stuff like that -- follow the money.",
        "Todd: Ok. Whatever it costs, you're covered.",
        "Rex: And I'm going to see what kind of traveling he did in late February and who he met there.",
        "Todd: Hey, find my son, there's a whole lot of money in it for you, Rex.",
        "Rex: Good. I'll start tomorrow.",
        "Todd: What's wrong with right w?",
        "Rex: Adriana and I are going to the bachelor parties of Antonio and Jessica.",
        "Todd: Where are these parties?",
        "Rex: The girls are at Capricorn and the guys are out at Nash Brennan's vineyard.",
        "Todd: All right, got it.",
        "Rex: You aren't thinking of going, are you?",
        "Todd: Me? I wasn't invited.",
        "Rex: That's not an answer.",
        "Todd: I'll talk to you tomorrow.",
        "Rex: I think maybe I just did a bad thing.",
        "Todd: Lock up for me, will you?",
        "Blair: Wait a minute. Where are you going?",
        "Todd: Bachelor party for Antonio.",
        "Blair: Oh, as in Vega, the guy who, like, hates your guts?",
        "Todd: Yeah, but he's marrying my favorite niece and now I'm part of his family.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah, and you're just in the mood for trouble, aren't you?",
        "Todd: No, no, no, just -- I'm a well-wisher, that's all.",
        "Blair: Oh, why don't you give some well wishes to your favorite niece?",
        "Todd: Uh, well they're at Capricorn and no men allowed, so I'd be intruding.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah, and you wouldn't be intruding wi Antonio?",
        "Todd: It's a bachelor party and I'm a bachelor, aren't I?",
        "Blair: Ha, ha, ha.",
        "Todd: Make sure you turn off the lights.",
        "Blair: Yeah? Two can play that game, big guy. That's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You've been here day in and day out since the accident. That can't be easy.",
        "Paige: He's my son. I love him.",
        "David: What about his adoptive parents?",
        "Paige: They love him, too, of course.",
        "David: They good people?",
        "Paige: They're excellent people.",
        "David: You know, when I was little, I wished my parents weren't my real parents. No such luck.",
        "Paige: Would you -- would you like to stay with him while I go get something to eat?",
        "David: Do I get to wear one of those hats? They look good on me.",
        "Paige: No, actually, just the gown. But you have to be careful not to touch him -- it could cause infection.",
        "David: I know better than to touch a burn victim, Paige.",
        "Paige: Oh, and one more thing -- they've cut way back on his pain meds, so sometimes he's in a lot of pain. He gets very agitated. And if that happens, you have to call the doctor or the nurse right away, ok?",
        "David: All right.",
        "Paige: All right.",
        "David: Will do. Take care.",
        "Paige: Bye.",
        "David: Hey, Hugh? It's David -- your uncle. [David chuckles] I -- I know the last time I was here, we didn't get to talk too much. I was kind of in a hurry and I -- well, I did sort of a crappy thing. You may not remember because you were soaked to the gills with morphine, but I sort of made you sign a power of attorney. I didn't know putting a pen in your gauzed hand and forcing you to make a fist around it would cause that much pain. I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and just so you know, that document is for the most part useless. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho. No, no -- take it easy. Hugh, take it easy. I don't know why people don't know about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Yes. Tess liked lemon drop shots. What's the big deal?",
        "Viki: It's not.",
        "Natalie: Roxy, why don't we go to the bar and get some drinks?",
        "Roxy: Cosmos or those lemon plop drops?",
        "Natalie: We'll decide when we get there.",
        "Roxy: Ok.",
        "Jessica: Ok, I admit it. I am different. The Tess part of me keeps on coming out more and more.",
        "Viki: No, darling, no. This is all part of integration.",
        "Jessica: I just -- I used to be the good girl, you know?",
        "Viki: But a little Tess mixed in with your goodness is not a bad thing.",
        "Jessica: Really? Are you sure? Because lately, I've been having these urges to cut loose, and it's scary, because I have a baby to raise. I'm getting married tomorrow and I need this marriage to work. I really do. Oh.",
        "Viki: Are you confused?",
        "Jessica: No. My love for Antonio is the one thing that I am absolutely sure of. I just constantly worry about Tess.",
        "Viki: Honey, that's understandable, but I think you are fine.",
        "Jessica: Well, you thought that you were fine, but it turns out that niki was just inside waiting, lurking to come out.",
        "Viki: Baby, no, that's not true. I brought her out. I allowed her to come out because she was the only one who could fill in the blanks about what happened to you.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, but remember you told me how she came out because she didn't want you to get married?",
        "Viki: That was a long time ago and a completely different situation. She -- she ran away from the church. Are you afraid that Tess is going to do that?",
        "Jessica: We, I wasn't until all of the sudden I started having these cravings for lemon drops. Tess loves Nash. She doesn't even like Antonio.",
        "Viki: But Tess is not that big an influence in your life anymore. Honey, you haven't had a single blackout since you've been integrated, have you?",
        "Jessica: No. But, I mean, when something breaks and you glue it back together, you can still see the cracks in it. I just don't feel like this seamless personality yet.",
        "Viki: Well, then maybe committing yourself to Antonio will make everything more seamless because it's what you wanted for so long.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, it is. It is, it is.",
        "Viki: Sweetheart, what exactly are you worried about?",
        "Jessica: I don't know. I'm -- I'm worried about standing there at the altar and the Tess part of me not letting me go through with it. I am worried about waking up the next morning and thinking that it's a horrible mistake, and what if that happens?",
        "Blair: There the bri-to-be. Hi, I just wanted to wish Todd's favorite niece a big congratulations. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Hmm.",
        "Clint: Excuse me.",
        "Cristian: All right, guys, here you go. Cards up.",
        "Antonio: Ow.",
        "Cristian: Ok, I'm in, too.",
        "Antonio: All right, I'll -- I'll see you two and I'll raise you four.",
        "Nash: I fold.",
        "Cristian: You sure about that, man?",
        "Nash: Oh, yes. My third eye is telling me to fold and run away. What?",
        "Clint: Your third eye?",
        "Cristian: Must be a California thing.",
        "Nash: Oh. Now I'm definitely writing you guys as so transparente.",
        "Antonio: Transparente.",
        "Cristian: All right, four it is. Let's see your cards.",
        "Antonio: Ah. Guess what, guys. Drink four, gentlemen.",
        "Cristian: Cheers.",
        "Nash: Score one for the California kid.",
        "Antonio: Hand me that red stuff.",
        "Cristian: Yeah.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Nash: That's good stuff.",
        "Clint: Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, God. I almost forgot. This is a toast.",
        "Cristian: Ok, another toast.",
        "Clint: Antonio, listen to me. Antonio, I've known you for a long time. You did good for my family, even before you and -- and Jessica got together. I consider you to be a friend, and so does my brother. Bo considers you -- I'm going to stop drinking after this toast. Antonio, to friendship.",
        "Antonio: To friendship.",
        "Cristian: To friendship.",
        "Nash: Friendship.",
        "Antonio: Salud.",
        "Cristian: Yes.",
        "Nash: Yes what?",
        "Cristian: I'm hungry",
        "Clint: Me, too.",
        "Antonio: You think we could get some pizza delivered out here?",
        "Todd: It looks like I came at just the right time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: It seems like you can actually hear me. I'll tell you what. How about some news? Let's see, what's the -- the news around Llanview? Well, the good news is Spencer is not Asa Buchanan's son. That sort of brings up the bad news, because if he's not a Buchanan, neither are you.",
        "Hugh: Oh --",
        "David: What's that? Did you say no?",
        "Hugh: Oh --",
        "David: Well, I don't blame you for being disappointed. A lot of money in that family. But, hey, tell you what. When they start letting you eat real food, I'm going to bring you a real treat. There's a bakery down here called PietrAsanti's. They have got some amazing cannolis. Out of this world. You know, when I was in jail, all I could think about was those damn pastries. Now, you may not be aware of this, but I helped Natalie and John find the gun that was used to kill John's father. And in a way, they sort of thanked me and -- well, since I was singlehandedly the one to crack the case, they offered me a few of those cannolis. All right, they didn't bring the cannolis that were actually from PietrAsanti's, but then again, I did shoot at John's dad, so I sort of consider us even after all. I think John's one of those guys that just thinks a deal's a deal. John was -- he was in the same wreck you were in, Hugh. But he wasn't as lucky as you were. If you call this lucky. You see, John died.",
        "Hugh: No. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Blair, hi. No, of course you're not interrupting.",
        "Blair: Oh, good. I just wanted to wish you happiness -- all the happiness in the world, and say finding your true love -- well, it doesn't always happen.",
        "Jessica: I know. Thank you.",
        "Viki: Blair, you know, I've been reading -- ahem -- all those articles about Spencer Truman that you and Todd have been publishing in \"The Sun.\" Do you think that's a good idea?",
        "Blair: Well, I did until Evangeline said that, you know, it might give Spencer's lawyer some ammunition.",
        "Viki: How?",
        "Blair: Claims that Spencer won't get a fair trial here in Llanview, that the case might be venued out.",
        "Viki: Aha. So perhaps you should talk to Todd, make him stop doing it?",
        "Blair: Yeah, and hear all the lectures about the first amendment?",
        "Viki: Oh, come on. That's not freedom of the press --",
        "Blair: Well --",
        "Viki: That's a vendetta -- one that could have very disastrous consequences.",
        "Blair: Well, I tried to talk to Todd about it, but we'll just have to wait and see what happens.",
        "Roxy: Surprise.",
        "Natalie: All right, ladies, no more shoptalk. Blair? Hi.",
        "Blair: Hi.",
        "Natalie: Why don't you join us.",
        "Blair: Be glad to. Wow, look at all of this.",
        "Roxy: Yeah, it's pretty cool. Ok, cider for Viki, and champagne for everybody else, against my better judgment, by the way. And I got vodka shots on the side. I don't know nothing about those lemon plop drops, but -- you know, I saw you once drink these.",
        "Jessica: Uh -- thank you, I think.",
        "Roxy: Ok. So, how about a toast? Anybody want to make one?",
        "Blair: Here we go.",
        "Jessica: Oh, ok.",
        "Blair: I'll -- I'll make one.",
        "Roxy: What, no shots?",
        "Jessica: Um -- I think I'll stick with the champagne, thanks.",
        "Blair: Well, here, I'll make the toast.",
        "Viki: Ok.",
        "Blair: To true love. For people who belong together, to stay together.",
        "Viki: Excellent. I'll drink to that.",

        "Roxy: Just the first round, but there's plenty more where this came from.",

        "Viki: Well, darling, you appear to have presents.",
        "Adriana: I know!",

        "Todd: What do you think would happen to your wedding night, Antonio, if my favorite niece found out you did not accept my heartfelt congratulations?",
        "Antonio: Ah, she wouldn't care. She knows how I feel about you.",

        "Kelly: I don't -- I don't know, either. One thing's for sure. If there is, it can't be here.",
        "Kevin: You mean in Llanview?",
        "Kelly: There's just -- there's too much family, and everyone knows what happened. It's too much history.",
        "Kevin: So you're saying if -- if we get a fresh start, it has to be --",
        "Kelly: Someplace else.",

        "Roxy: I got it online. Oh, but don't worry, baby, I never used it.",
        "Natalie: Oh. I'm so relieved.",
        "Roxy: You know, they're making amazing strides in sexual tachnophelia.",
        "Natalie: Ok, let's not hear about that. Please don't share. Mom, do you think we can stick these gifts in the car?",
        "Viki: I think that's a good idea. You can carry that one.",
        "Natalie: Ok.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: Sometimes, guys may not like the idea of marriage. You know, it can be pretty scary, having to commit to one person for the rest of your life. You know? And most of the time, there's a lot expectation involved, with most women. And that's scary in itself. But that's why I think it's a good idea for us to bump into a guy like my brother, who saw Jessica Buchanan one day and said, \"that's it. She's the one.\" And kept saying it through all kinds of trouble.",
        "Nash: Oh, that's me.",
        "Cristian: Yeah, right, like -- like you. But my brother kept at it. He didn't give up. He was consistent. And he's not going to be alone because of that. Something to think about. You're a real life lesson, my brother. Here's to you and Jessica, and to love.",

        "David: Well, if I had known that you didn't know, I wouldn't have gone on about those stupid cannolis. But you remember him, don't you? You were right there when I came out of the office with a pink box. There were about four of them left at that point. That was when you told me that things were going to start looking up for me. You know what, Hugh? No one had said that to me in long time, and I really appreciated it. I still do.",
        "Hugh: Not -- Hugh -- [Hugh coughs]",
        "David: You don't feel like you? Well, if it makes you feel any better, you don't look like you. You look horrible. But, hey, you're getting better. I think that's probably why they're pulling you off of the drugs that they've been giving you. You know what? I've been probably keeping you up. I should probably let you get some rest, but I'll be back. Hey -- and I'll bring some cannolis. Huh?",
