Starr gives birth to a boy. Tess has a \"vision\" that she gave birth to a girl with the help of Nikki. Tina is distracted with Cain after discovering that her dog is a female and pregnant and has given birth to puppies."

        "John: Hey, hey, George. Hey, listen to me. Listen, wait, wait.",
        "George: What? What is it, Detective?",
        "John: I need -- I need -- I need to make a call.",
        "George: The mayor said --",
        "John: I don't care what the mayor said.",
        "George: The mayor said no calls, no visitors.",
        "John: I know my rights! You're not listening to me. You're not listening. Don't you understand? Todd Manning has Marty Saybrooke locked away in his house, the man who raped her. Do you want to be responsible for that? George, you got to let me call the commissioner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Don't say that to me, Marty. Don't tell me you love me.",
        "Marty: Why, because you don't feel the same way?",
        "Todd: No, because I do feel the same way. It's true. God help me, I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: How is she?",
        "Dr. Joplin: Starr and the baby are fine.",
        "Janet: Are you going to warn her?",
        "Dr. Joplin: What, that her father wants me to kidnap her baby and tell her it died?",
        "Janet: Look, if you warn her about the possible complications, it may help soften the blow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Langston: So, how long does this part take, the actual delivery?",
        "Marcie: I don't know. Don't look at me.",
        "Blair: Well, it depends on how long Starr has to push, but you are doing great, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: I have two words for you -- \"birth control.\"",
        "[Blair chuckles]",
        "Dorian: It isn't going to be long now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cain: Face it, schatzie, David Vickers is a bitch.",
        "Tina: What are you saying? No, my David Vickers is every inch a man.",
        "Man: She have this problem often?",
        "Cain: Usually, she can tell the difference.",
        "Tina: The breeder told me he was a he.",
        "Cain: Yeah, this just in -- sometimes people lie. The question is, who's the bad boy?",
        "Tina: What are you saying?",
        "Cain: It takes two to tango, princess. So, who's the baby daddy, David? Or I should say Davida?",
        "Tina: Uh, are you implying that my little baby here had s-e-x?",
        "Cain: Yes, and now she's p-r-e-- preggers, princess. That means someone was asleep at the wheel, T-I-N-A.",
        "Man: Yeah, seriously, every time the dog went to squat, you -- you didn't notice it was a she?",
        "Cain: Well, see, Tina hires people to actually take out the dog to go --",
        "Tina: Now -- now give me a break, will you? My life hasn't exactly been easy lately. I mean, you have no idea what's going on at Viki's house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Aunt Viki.",
        "Viki: Hi.",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "Viki: Oh, darling, how you doing, huh?",
        "Blair: Well, she is a champ.",
        "Starr: Who invented this?",
        "Blair: A man.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Starr: How did you know I was here?",
        "Viki: Your grandmother Addie called me.",
        "Dorian: What could she have been thinking except that you haven't called or been in touch.",
        "Blair: Dorian, not now, okay?",
        "Viki: No, no, no, she's right, she's right. I have been neglecting you and I am so sorry.",
        "Starr: Don't worry about it. I know you've been away and you've had to take care of Jessica. Jessica is due pretty soon, isn't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Niki: Jared and Natalie don't deserve to die. I do. I'm the one you blame, right?",
        "Tess: Right.",
        "Niki: Okay. So let's get to the basement before that dynamite you planted blows your sister and her boyfriend to Smithereens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: It's okay.",
        "Todd: No, it's not.",
        "Marty: We love each other, and I want this.",
        "Todd: I believe that you think you do but you don't.",
        "Marty: Are you afraid that I'm not strong enough? Because I am. I'm healthy, I'm well, and it's all because of you.",
        "Todd: That's wonderful.",
        "Marty: Then there's no reason for us not to be together.",
        "Todd: I can't let you do it. It's not fair to you.",
        "Marty: I want a life with you and your grandchild. I do. So come upstairs with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: Now look what you've done, you bad boy. You're a mommy.",
        "Cain: Dog's a slut.",
        "Tina: Hey, don't talk that way to him, okay? He can't help it if he's irresistible.",
        "Man: Yeah, okay. I'm going to let you two wacky kids figure this out on your own, but, um, call me if you ever want to sell that stone, or need something notarized, or want to learn Spanish. Times are tough.",
        "Tina: Oh, well, look, I know you're mad at me, but it's not my fault.",
        "Cain: Yeah, it never is.",
        "Tina: Well, it's my crazy niece's fault. That's -- never mind. What's important here is that we're going to bring new life into the world.",
        "Cain: What -- talking puppies.",
        "Tina: David Vickers' puppies. Our puppies and if -- if anything would happen to David Vickers, I'd just die because he's my best friend. I -- please? Please, Cain, you -- you are going to help me, aren't you?",
        "Cain: Okay. Well, David Vickers, looks like I'm going to be Scarlett to your Melanie. You, I can always kill later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: You are going to get through this with flying colors. I know you will. Marcie is a very lucky woman.",
        "Starr: No, the baby's the lucky one.",
        "Marcie: You know, if I can be half the mother you are, we'll all luck out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: I was so sure he'd be here.",
        "Niki: Nash? Sorry, kid, doesn't matter how many people you blow up, nothing's going to bring him back.",
        "Tess: Ow, oh. Ow, oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Darling, I just wanted to let you know that I'm thinking about you and I love you very, very much.",
        "Starr: I love you, too.",
        "Viki: Would you let me know?",
        "Dorian: Of course.",
        "Viki: Thanks.",
        "Marcie: And I'll call you as soon as we get all settled in case you want to come by.",
        "Viki: Yes.",
        "Marcie: You're all welcome.",
        "Blair: You just let us know how Jessica's doing. Thanks for stopping by, okay?",
        "Viki: Thank you.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "Viki: Bye, sweetheart.",
        "Starr: Bye. I'm really glad Grandma called her.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dorian: Yes, of course. Excuse me. Starr, honey, I want to apologize to you because I know I was not very supportive about your decision. It's just that I couldn't bear the idea of a Cramer baby being --",
        "Blair: Dorian, come on.",
        "Dorian: But in true Cramer fashion, you stuck by your guns. I'm sure that Marcie is going to make a wonderful mother and that she loves this baby already.",
        "Marcie: I do. I love him or her more than you know.",
        "Dorian: Yes, otherwise, you wouldn't risk Todd's wrath.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Joplin: I'll handle this the way I see fit.",
        "Janet: I'm just concerned about the mother.",
        "Dr. Joplin: And I'm not? This goes against everything I believe in.",
        "Janet: So why are you doing it?",
        "Dr. Joplin: I could ask you the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Come on, George, one call.",
        "George: I'll tell you what. The first thing in the morning, I'll call the commissioner --",
        "John: Ah.",
        "George: As soon as I punch out I'll let him know you're here, all right?",
        "John: George, George, this is not going to wait till morning. Come on, George. You know me. You got to let me out of here.",
        "George: If I let you out of here, I lose my job. Just take it easy.",
        "John: Hey, listen to me! Don't tell me to take it easy, George!",
        "George: What? Sometimes you just got to play by the rules, John.",
        "John: Yeah? Till when? Till she ends up dead? Till she ends up dead? Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: What is it?",
        "Todd: I can't do it. You don't understand.",
        "Marty: Well, explain it to me.",
        "Todd: I can't.",
        "Marty: When you found me, I was completely broken, and you put me back together. Then I fell in love with you.",
        "Marty: Whatever it is you -- you need to let me help you. Don't you think you owe me that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I really do not know if I can do this.",
        "Langston: No, what are you talking about? You're a rock star.",
        "Blair: Marcie, we probably should get into our scrubs, okay?",
        "Marcie: Oh, yeah, I'll go ask the nurse.",
        "Blair: Okay, great. Listen, when we come back, I'm look like a real doctor.",
        "Langston: So, how bad does it hurt? Yeah, okay.",
        "Starr: It's better with the epidural, but -- but before, it didn't just feel like you break your ankle or something or -- or you get a cut. It feels more like your insides are being squeezed.",
        "Langston: Okay, adopting. It's going to be okay.",
        "Starr: I'm really, really, really scared.",
        "Langston: I know. But you can handle it. You're the strongest person that I know -- besides Dorian, of course.",
        "Dorian: Let's go. All right, they're ready for you now and don't worry about a thing, darling. You and your baby are going to be just fine.",
        "Starr: Okay, but where's my mom?",
        "Dorian: Uh, they've gone to change into scrubs so they can be in the delivery room with you, of course.",
        "Langston: If you need me, I'm going to be right outside, okay?",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Cole: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, you okay?",
        "Starr: You came?",
        "Cole: I told you I would.",
        "Starr: I know but I just know how hard this is on you.",
        "Cole: What -- it's harder on you right now.",
        "Dorian: It's really sweet of you to stop by but this girl has a baby to deliver. Come on.",
        "Starr: Thank you for coming. I'll see you.",
        "Cole: See you after?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Starr is in labor. I thought you might like to know that in case you're still picking up your messages. Jessie, darling, please, please call me back. I'm so incredibly worried about you. It's Mom.",
        "Dorian: Viki?",
        "Viki: Dorian. How's Starr?",
        "Dorian: She's in the delivery room. It could be a while.",
        "Viki: Oh. Please do thank Addie for me again for, you know, calling me.",
        "Dorian: I will. Did Clint tell you that I've given him back his company?",
        "Viki: Yes, he mentioned that.",
        "Dorian: Is that all you're going to say?",
        "Viki: I'm sorry, Dorian. We're having some problems in the family.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "Dorian: It has always been my blessing and my curse that I can tell when you're in trouble. So what is it this time?",
        "Viki: Well, if you must know, I just came from the morgue where I was looking for my daughters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Okay, I -- I have to get to Natalie -- oh, God -- before that bomb goes off.",
        "[Tess groans]",
        "Tess: Come on. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone vibrates]",
        "[David Vickers whimpers]",
        "Tina: Don't you worry, David Vickers. I'm going to help you.",
        "[Phone vibrates]",
        "Cain: Don't look at me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Tina, pick up, pick up! God, Tina, Tina, go, as soon as you get this, you have to go downstairs, you have let Jared and Natalie out of the room, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tina: What -- I thought you were going to be Scarlett to David Vickers' Melanie.",
        "Cain: Yeah. Look, it's one thing to be a prince but a prince with a medical degree, I --",
        "Tina: Look -- look, all you have to do is just boil some water and bring me some towels. You can handle that, right?",
        "Cain: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: Oh, and hurry, Tina, I rigged that dynamite of yours. It's going to go off. Please -- oh, God -- she's an idiot! She won't be able to disconnect it. I -- that woman -- ow! God, ow! Please, stop, I'm not ready. Ah!",
        "Niki: Ready or not, that baby is about to make an entrance.",
        "Tess: No, it -- I can't do this alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Jessica's missing?",
        "Viki: And Natalie and Jared, as well.",
        "Dorian: What happened?",
        "Viki: I might as well tell you since it all started with you.",
        "Dorian: Of course, blame me.",
        "Viki: When Nash died, Jessica was despondent. We knew that. What we did not know, until it was too late, unfortunately, is that she was also gone. You see, Tess has taken over again.",
        "[Dorian sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Niki: You're not alone, Tess. I'm here. I'm going to take care of you. Come on.",
        "Niki: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: How's she doing there, Doctor?",
        "Dr. Joplin: She's doing good. You're almost fully dilated, Starr.",
        "Starr: Okay, how's the baby?",
        "Dr. Joplin: Good. The baby's perfect.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "[Heart beats]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Marty, if I stay here with you in this room --",
        "Marty: What?",
        "Todd: I'm going to hurt you.",
        "Marty: What do you mean, if we make love?",
        "Todd: No, we can't make love.",
        "Marty: Why? What -- is this because of what happened to me?",
        "Todd: Well, yeah, you don't remember what happened to you, but I do and --",
        "Marty: But it's over. It -- it can't hurt me anymore.",
        "Todd: You don't know that.",
        "Marty: Todd --",
        "Todd: What if we do it and you remember afterwards?",
        "Marty: Then you'll help me through it. This would never be about you.",
        "Todd: But it's not me I'm worried about. It's you. It's what you're going to feel.",
        "Marty: But I don't remember my life before. And these last few months, the way you've cared for me when I was so helpless, if I can't trust you, I can't trust anyone. So now you need to trust me. I know that what we're feeling right now has nothing to do with what happened to me in a fraternity house. It's love.",
        "Todd: You should know something about me, Marty. Everything I touch, I ruin.",
        "Marty: That's not true.",
        "Todd: It is.",
        "Todd: John McBain didn't steal Blair from me, like I said. I drove her to him. I've really hurt my children, too. Everyone I've ever loved, I've hurt, at some point. I can't do that to you. I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Oh, hey, you are doing great, sweetheart. You're doing great.",
        "Starr: I can't keep this up.",
        "Blair: Yes, you can.",
        "Starr: No, I want to go home!",
        "Marcie: Starr, just focus.",
        "Blair: Starr, come on.",
        "Starr: I -- if you say that one more time, I swear --",
        "Marcie: You'll what? Come on, tell me. What will you do?",
        "Starr: I will hit you.",
        "Blair: Oh, Starr.",
        "Marcie: Langston was right, you are a rock star.",
        "Starr: Oh, I can't do it.",
        "Blair: Yes, you can, sweetie.",
        "Starr: I can't. No, I can't! I want to go home! I'm sorry, Marcie, I can't do it. I can't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cain: Okay, uh, hot water and towels. Now what?",
        "Tina: Oh, I feel so bad. I mean, she must be in so much pain.",
        "Cain: Ooh, poor little Davida. Don't worry; we'll get you through this. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Tess blames Natalie and Jared for Nash's death.",
        "Dorian: I thought she was blaming me.",
        "Viki: No, she's not quite as logical as the rest of us. In any case, Jessie and Natalie and Jared, all three of them have just disappeared.",
        "Dorian: I'm sorry. I had no idea.",
        "Viki: And neither did I. I was in Africa. Clint was busy trying to get the company back from you. So Tess had free rein. What she did was she forced Natalie, apparently, to write a letter to Jared, saying that it was all over between them and that she was leaving town.",
        "Dorian: I wonder where she got that idea from. Come on, Viki, you forced me to write a letter like that to Joe.",
        "Viki: No, Dorian, actually, that wasn't me. It was Jean Randolph, my alter who fixed the messes because you had chosen to seduce my son Joey when he was still a teenager.",
        "Dorian: Right. I really hope things turn out all right for you and your family. I really do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tess: So what, you're going to be my midwife, Niki Smith?",
        "Niki: You see anybody else?",
        "Tess: I'm better off alone.",
        "Niki: I know I screwed you over when you were a kid. That's over. Right now, I'm it. I'm all you got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Jean? Jean Randolph?",
        "Jean: Victoria. Don't look so surprised. Who else would it be?",
        "Viki: But why?",
        "Jean: Because you need me.",
        "Viki: No, I'm integrated.",
        "Jean: For what it's worth. But just as Jessica turns to Tess for help, you have chosen once again to turn to me for guidance, to help you see what is directly in front of your face.",
        "Viki: I don't understand.",
        "Jean: Think, Victoria. Use the brain that Victor and Eugenia gave you. For once, Dorian actually said something useful.",
        "Viki: You -- you mean about you forcing her to write a letter?",
        "Jean: Yes. Although, why Tess would choose to adopt my tactics when she is so much more like Nicole, I really don't know.",
        "Viki: What are you saying?",
        "\u0091Jean: I'm making an observation.",
        "Viki: So you don't think it's a coincidence, the letter?",
        "Jean: I don't believe in coincidences, Victoria. I believe in deductive reasoning. After all, she's your daughter.",
        "Viki: So she's taking her cues from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Tess breathes heavily]",
        "Tess: I don't trust you.",
        "Niki: Doesn't matter.",
        "[Tess breathes heavily]",
        "Niki: Come on, kid. I'm going to take the pain, okay? You're going to give me the pain, all of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: My father was a sick man.",
        "Marty: You're not your father.",
        "Todd: But I have those tendencies. I've done some bad things.",
        "Marty: We've all done things we regret. That's what makes us human. The fact that you can look back and wish you'd done things differently, that just shows how much you've grown. I mean, your own daughter wants to give you her child. Doesn't that say something to you?",
        "Todd: Marty, I know that you think I'm a changed man and -- I -- I just know that if we do that tonight, I'm going to hurt you.",
        "Marty: I'll probably hurt you, too. It's part of the package. You know, no matter how hard we try, we make mistakes.",
        "Todd: It's more than just making mistakes. I mean, I --",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: I can't seem to -- I see things so much differently than everyone else. I mean, if there's a disagreement, if I have a disagreement with somebody, I -- you know, I get really --",
        "[Todd chuckles]",
        "Todd: I want to do things, and I do, and people get hurt.",
        "Marty: I know. I -- I'm not naive. I've seen you as you are.",
        "Todd: I'm not sure about that.",
        "[Marty sighs]",
        "Marty: Todd, I'm a woman with no memory. No memory. That could drive you crazy, but I've learned that tomorrow's not always a foregone conclusion. And we make each other laugh. I think that says a lot. Think about it. In a way, I'm your creation. Hmm. You, uh, rescued me from dying together. Come on, look at me, you didn't do a bad job.",
