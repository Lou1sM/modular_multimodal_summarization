She goes home with Schuyler and is ready to seduce him. Jessica runs into Jared. John, Brody and Rex find out that Nadine and Corinne have scammed them because they were \"paid\" by somebody.

        "Blair: I think she's gonna need a little help.",
        "Todd: No way. Have you ever heard this kid wail?",
        "Starr: Oh! All right, you ready? 1, 2 -- ah!",
        "Blair: Jack!",
        "Starr: Jack!",
        "Jack: I wanted to make sure she got her wish.",
        "Todd: Hope's gonna end up with a Z-box now.",
        "Cole: If she can play with the box, she'll be happy.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah. Okay, it's official. She is one year old today, so you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna party!",
        "Starr: Yeah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Amelia: The polls just closed.",
        "Dorian: Oh, that's wonderful. We'll soon have something else to celebrate: My victory over Viki.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Your mommy asked me to bring you these. She misses you so much. Good heavens, what are you doing here?",
        "Marcie: Do you think I could stay away today?",

        "Schuyler: Uh, yeah. That's probably best for all concerned.",
        "Gigi: I can't -- I can't stay here",
        "Schuyler: I know. I know. You just -- hold on a second, okay? I'm gonna call you a cab.",
        "Gigi: Uh, can't you drive me?",
        "Schuyler: I -- I get off at 11:00, Gigi.",

        "John: Everything okay? You seem a little flustered.",
        "Brody: John.",
        "John: Brody. How could you hold out on me like that?",
        "Brody: Rex is back there, too. He's out cold, but his pulse is strong.",
        "John: How about you? You okay?",
        "Brody: Yeah. Whatever they drugged us with, it just knocks you out for a while.",
        "John: You drugged your own brother.",
        "Brody: Yeah. Put it in my coffee. Why'd you do it, Nadine?",
        "John: To keep you from getting to Jessica.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: How did you know I was here?",
        "Jessica: I didn't. Nash told me to come. But I didn't come here with Nash, right? It was you, wasn't it?",

        "Marcie: Ha ha! No. 7 1/2 months pregnant.",
        "Viki: Oh.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. We're both doing great.",
        "Viki: It's a miracle.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. Part of me still can't believe it.",
        "Viki: Wow.",
        "Marcie: But that's why I wanted to be here today.",
        "Viki: For Chloe?",
        "Marcie: Of course. A year ago today, we said good-bye to her.",
        "Viki: You know something, Marcie. You were one of the few people who ever saw her. I'm awfully glad you were with her.",
        "Marcie: Well, I wanted to -- wanted her to know her life meant something, it mattered.",
        "Viki: Oh, God.",
        "Marcie: She may not have been the baby that I was gonna adopt, but she still mattered to me. She mattered to so many people.",
        "Viki: Oh, she did.",
        "Marcie: You know, in a strange way, I kind of have her to thank for this.",
        "Viki: I guess you do because if you and Michael hadn't grieved together --",
        "Marcie: Yeah, we may not have ever gotten back together.",
        "Viki: Oh, my goodness.",
        "Marcie: Ha ha!",

        "Marcie: Oh, maybe not.",
        "Viki: Aw...",
        "Marcie: But I did also come back because I'm still registered to vote here, and I'm happy to report that I got back in time to vote for you for mayor.",
        "Viki: Ha ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dorian: Have the returns started to come in?",
        "Amelia: Zero precincts reporting. This may take a while.",
        "Dorian: Well, then, it is Hope's birthday, and maybe we should just, um, mute.",
        "Langston: I really hope Dorian wins.",
        "Markko: Yeah, I know. I know you do.",
        "Langston: So you never told me who you voted for.",

        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Cole: Uh, it's, uh, kind of unbelievable, huh?",
        "Starr: I know. Only Hope could get a group like this together in one room.",
        "Langston: Well, a year ago today we thought there was no hope. I mean, how could this day not bring us all together?",
        "Blair: Well, Langston, I couldn't have said it better myself.",
        "Starr: All right, now, everyone together.",
        "Blair: Look at Mommy! Starr; smile! 1, 2, 3! Cheese!",

        "Schuyler: Look, I know you're upset about seeing the sonogram thing.",
        "Gigi: What, this? [Scoffs] You can't even tell it's a baby. Who do you think the little nipper looks like, my slut sister?",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, don't do that.",
        "Gigi: I don't even know if it looks like Rex. It's been so long since I've seen him I barely remember what he looks like.",

        "Gigi: I told you, he's with Moe and Noelle. They're --",
        "Schuyler: No. I -- yeah. I know that. At their place or your place?",
        "Gigi: Mine, of course. Of course. I would never do anything inappropriate.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay, I don't want Shane to see you like this.",
        "Gigi: Me either.",
        "Schuyler: All right, so maybe we can just -- maybe we can hang out in John's back office or something like that for a little --",
        "Gigi: I don't want to stay here.",
        "Schuyler: Well, where do you suggest we go?",
        "Gigi: Let's go to your place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Local PD's on the way, and we got an EMT for Rex. He's still not coming around. What'd you give him?",
        "Corrine: Just something to make him sleep.",
        "Brody: What's the matter with you? You're Rex's aunt. How could you do this to him?",
        "Corrine: He'll be fine.",
        "Brody: And why did you team up with this one?",
        "Nadine: Nice way to talk about your own sister.",
        "Brody: You two wanted us out of the way; you needed us out of the way, why? I need to talk to Jessica. Do you -- do you know if she's all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You called me. You told me to come here.",
        "Jared: No, no. Wait.",
        "Jessica: You sounded like Nash. How did you sound like Nash?",
        "Jared: Wait. I didn't call you.",
        "Jessica: Well, you just said it was you.",
        "Jared: There was trouble.",
        "Jessica: Wha --",
        "Jared: Yes. Someone's stalking you.",
        "Jessica: What?",
        "Jared: I figured Natalie told you.",
        "Jessica: That you were stalking me?",
        "Jared: It wasn't me. It was because of me. Wayne Landers was the one doing this.",
        "Jessica: So you didn't make any calls?",
        "Jared: No.",
        "Jessica: And you didn't tell me to come here?",
        "Jared: No.",
        "Jessica: You're a liar. You lied the whole time, pretended to take care of me, but really you've been using my memories to hurt me.",
        "Jared: Listen --",
        "Jessica: No! I'm not listening. I'm going home to my daughter. I'm getting the hell out of here.",
        "Jared: Jessica, sorry. I can't let you do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brody: You are up to your ass, Nadine. Your best bet is to tell us what's going on.",
        "Nadine: Okay, someone made me call you, get you to come here.",
        "John: We need a name, Nadine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What are you gonna do to me?",
        "Jared: Okay, I just need you to listen.",
        "Jessica: To what?",
        "Jared: What happened the night I got to the lodge. Pamela Stuart --",
        "Jessica: You killed her.",
        "Jared: No.",
        "Jessica: And you killed the guy that was pretending to be Nash.",
        "Jared: I didn't kill anyone.",
        "Jessica: Then why won't you let me go?",
        "Jared: Ju --",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God. What did you do to Natalie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Markko: I got you a root beer. It's your favorite, right?",
        "Langston: Thanks.",
        "Markko: Come on, are you gonna stay mad at me forever?",
        "Langston: I'm considering it.",
        "Markko: Just because I won't say who I voted for?",
        "Langston: I don't care who you voted for.",
        "Markko: Then why are you mad?",
        "Langston: Because we're a couple. We're supposed to tell each other everything.",
        "Markko: So you wouldn't be upset if I voted for Mrs. Banks?",
        "Langston: Of course not.",
        "Markko: Good. Uh...I mean, I totally voted for Dorian.",
        "Langston: You did?",
        "Markko: Are you kidding me?",
        "Langston: Oh, I knew it! I knew you couldn't vote against my mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Look at you. I didn't think it was possible.",
        "Todd: What?",
        "Blair: You actually look like you're having a good time.",
        "Todd: Sure. I decided to take your advice.",
        "Blair: When did I ever say anything that was...wise?",
        "Todd: Well, you told me to focus on what I do have and not what T\u00e9a tried to take from me.",
        "Blair: Oh, yeah?",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Blair: It's Todd. T\u00e9a has a child with Todd.",
        "Todd: You all right?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I'm -- I'm fine.",
        "Todd: Good, 'cause that one's got a dirty diaper. I think you should...",
        "Blair: Oh, well, I think it's time for you to take it on.",
        "Todd: Oh, that's -- hey, Jack, Jack, you want to make some money?",
        "Blair: Ha ha!",
        "[Hope crying]",
        "Marty: How do you do it?",
        "Blair: You're not gonna start with me.",
        "Marty: How do you watch him with that baby knowing you're keeping him from his own child?",
        "Blair: It's, uh, not my decision, and it's not yours either.",
        "Marty: Another lecture on patient/doctor confidentiality?",
        "Blair: Uh-huh. It's T\u00e9a's decision, all right? She's the one that doesn't want Todd to know.",
        "Marty: You sure about that?",
        "Blair: Yes. I was there when he confronted her about a big secret. Yeah. And she let him think that it was all about her and Ross stealing his money.",
        "Marty: Yeah, because you'd already told Todd that that's what T\u00e9a told you.",
        "Blair: This is none of your business, you got it, Marty?",
        "Marty: Yeah, but it is Todd's business.",
        "Todd: Hey, hey, hey. Do I have to remind you two this is a party?",
        "Blair: Oh, everything's good, Todd.",
        "Todd: Uh-huh.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm.",
        "Todd: What's going on?",
        "Marty: There's something I need to tell you. It's about your child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Schuyler: Hey, ready?",
        "Gigi: Time to go.",
        "Schuyler: Okay, okay. Uh, you know, I got to warn you. My place, it's a little messy.",
        "Gigi: I don't care.",
        "Schuyler: Haven't -- don't have a lot of company.",
        "Gigi: I said I don't care!",
        "Schuyler: Gigi, are you sure -- are you sure you don't want to call Rex?",
        "Gigi: I already left him a ton of messages.",
        "Schuyler: Okay. Okay, but listen, if Rex comes home early and you're not there --",
        "Gigi: He doesn't care about me, okay? He's got way more important stuff on his mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Who are you working for?",
        "Nadine: I don't know.",
        "Brody: Don't give me that. You said someone had you two get Rex and me here.",
        "Nadine: It was just a voice on the phone.",
        "Brody: You did all this for a stranger? You told me you were in trouble, you said you needed me.",
        "Nadine: I know what I said. He offered me money.",
        "Brody: Money.",
        "Nadine: This house is in foreclosure! I needed it! That much was true.",
        "Brody: You kept me from going back to Jessica.",
        "Nadine: I didn't --",
        "Brody: You drugged me for money?",
        "Nadine: I didn't want to, but he said you had to stay.",
        "John: Wait a minute. You're saying you never saw the person you were dealing with?",
        "Nadine: No, never.",
        "John: How'd you get the money?",
        "Nadine: It was deposited into my account as soon as Brody showed up.",
        "John: All of it?",
        "Nadine: No. Half. I'd get the rest if Brody stayed here all week.",
        "Brody: Ha ha!",
        "John: What about you?",
        "Corrine: Someone called me.",
        "John: Same deal, half up front?",
        "Corrine: I didn't need the money. He scared me.",
        "Brody: He threatened you?",
        "Corrine: Well, no, not exactly.",
        "John: Either of you happen to tape this conversation?",
        "Corrine: I didn't.",
        "Nadine: No.",
        "Brody: And you never -- you only talked to him on the phone; you never saw his face? The guy had to be watching this place if he knew I was here.",
        "John: Well, unless he had someone reporting back. Either of you recognize this man?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I didn't do anything to Natalie.",
        "Jessica: Stop lying.",
        "Jared: Look, I haven't talked to her since I left Llanview because I don't want her involved in this.",
        "Jessica: But she knew you were at that motel.",
        "Jared: What motel?",
        "Jessica: Well, she wouldn't have gone there if she didn't know that you were there.",
        "Jared: Wh -- Jessica, where is she?",
        "Jessica: Well, you know where she is. I was with her when -- when you sent her that text message.",
        "Jared: Wait, what text -- wait. She said she got a text message from me?",
        "Jessica: No, but as soon as she got it -- when she left, you showed up.",
        "Jared: Jessica, are you saying she's here? Are you saying --",
        "Jessica: You planned it, Jared!",
        "Jared: No!",
        "Jessica: Where is she? Where is Natalie?",
        "Jared: I don't know, but I've got to find her! What -- what are you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm calling the police.",
        "Jared: No, y --",
        "Jessica: Jared!",
        "Jared: Okay, listen to me. If the police come within one inch of this place, Natalie could die!",

        "Jack: See? It just turned blue.",
        "Dorian: Oh, dear, that means Viki's taken the third district.",
        "Jack: But that one's red.",
        "Amelia: That's your Aunt Dorian's. The numbers are almost identical.",
        "Dorian: Yes! Ha ha! You see, Viki and I are now Even Steven.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: It's about your child... and mine. It's Cole and Starr.",
        "Todd: Well, what? I didn't do anything to them.",
        "Marty: No, no, not lately, no.",
        "Todd: So what's the problem?",
        "Marty: Well, Hope's birthday is an anniversary for me, too. A year ago tomorrow, my son found out that I was still in his life. It's an important thing for a child to know his or her parent is there, watching out for them. And I know we've reached a kind of detente, but if I find you even thinking about coming between Starr and Cole, I will be watching.",
        "Todd: Relax, Marty. Enough people hate me already. I'm not gonna add Starr to the list.",
        "Marty: And I do know that you love your children more than anything in the world.",
        "Todd: Yeah.",
        "Marty: Yeah. Well, of course Blair knows that, too.",
        "Todd: That was really weird.",

        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Starr: Hi.",
        "Cole: Is everything okay?",
        "Starr: What do you think she wished for?",
        "Cole: Uh, I don't know. Maybe some wings for her stroller. Or all the icing she can eat.",
        "Starr: Do you think she even knows it's her birthday?",
        "Cole: Probably not. Ever since we got her back, we act like every day's her birthday.",
        "Starr: When she was born, I made a wish for her. Remember how awful it was that night?",
        "Cole: I don't like to think about it.",
        "Starr: Me either. I thought that we had lost her forever and I thought that I had lost you forever.",
        "Cole: Well, I never left you, not really.",
        "Starr: My wish came true.",
        "Cole: We're together now. You, me, and our baby.",

        "Marcie: Today's Hope's birthday, too.",
        "Viki: I know. You know, Marcie, what you did, giving that baby back to Starr and Cole --",
        "Marcie: It was the right thing to do.",
        "Viki: It was an extraordinary act.",
        "Marcie: Starr had changed. She wasn't that scared little girl anymore who didn't want to raise her own child. You know, all I care about is what's best for Hope.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, then I expect you'll be pleased to know that child is so happy, so spoiled, and so healthy.",
        "Marcie: I knew her parents would see to that.",
