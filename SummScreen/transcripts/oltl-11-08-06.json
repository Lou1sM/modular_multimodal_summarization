        "\"What are you doing there?\" Nash ignores her question and simply tells Jessica not to marry Antonio. She gets angry. She knows what this is about and she hates this because she never led him on. He tells her that she is a new person and she has a new heart and she is ignoring that. He just wants her to listen to it. Antonio is nervous. \"Is she hear yet?\" Clint and Kevin have come in and they know that time is running out but instead of saying 'no', they simply say that Jessica is on her way. Rex worries about Natalie and where she could be. He is relieved to see that she is holding up well. Everyone is getting concerned about Jessica not showing up and no one has seen them. Claudia and Blair are at the bar getting sauced and they share their problems with men. \"Hey you want to go crash a wedding?\" a drunken Blair suggests. Claudia loves that idea. They head out. The bridesmaids are talking about Jessica not showing up yet and Adriana thinks that this might have something to do with Nash not being around either. \"They let him get to her?\" The drunkards have arrived and they stare at the bridesmaids who stare right back. Claudia heads to Antonio upset that he managed to let Nash and Jessica get together. Antonio isn't worried about that. In fact he is more worried about her having given up her sobriety after being on the wagon for so long. Blair is at the back of the church and she spills everything out of her purse onto the floor. Everyone stares at her as she picks up her change, etc in a very unladylike manner. \"If you embarrass me or my niece today Blair, I will throw you out of here myself.\" Todd is standing over her and he isn't pleased. She takes a seat at the back of the church all alone. Nash does his best to make Jessica see that she shouldn't marry Antonio that day. She doesn't want to be a cop's wife and he knows it. She says that he doesn't know everything that he thinks that he does about she, about Antonio She tells him to go to hell. Vincent shows up to the wedding and asks Evangeline to come and talk to him for a minute. She leaves Cris and Vincent starts the conversation about how they couldn't understand why Hugh would get agitated at different times when they were visiting. He doesn't get to finish what he is saying as the wedding is about to start. The Flower Girl and bridesmaids do the walk and then it is time for the bride to come up, but when the door opens, Nash is there. The crowd grumbles. He rushes to his place at the front. The music starts again, and this time when the door opens, Clint is there with Jessica. \"Are you okay with this honey?\""

        "Natalie: You weren't supposed to see that.",
        "Bo: It's ok. You're allowed.",
        "Natalie: Not today. Today is Jessica's day and I'm not going to mess this wedding up.",
        "Bo: This meant a lot to John.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, it didn't bring him much luck, though.",
        "Bo: Natalie, listen to me. He died a happy man. He was -- he was holding on to this, and that tells me that you were with him in the end.",
        "Natalie: You know -- I gave this to him at Christmas. We were broken up. So I had -- well, I had sent it to the station, and I remembered, and I ran up there to get it back because I didn't want to look pathetic or giving the wrong signal or whatever -- I don't remember. And, you know, I thought that St. Jude was the patron saint of cops.",
        "Bo: St. Michael.",
        "Natalie: Yeah. Yeah, I know that now. Nope, this guy here -- patron saint of lost causes. Isn't that perfect?",
        "Bo: You are not a lost cause. You are the furthest thing from it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: We'll be right back, all right?",
        "Antonio: Ok.",
        "Kevin: Nash was here earlier, and then he took off, and Jess never made it. I don't like this, dad.",
        "Clint: Yeah, well, we just have to trust him.",
        "Kevin: Trust him? The guy kidnapped Jess and the baby once before, remember?",
        "Clint: That was before Jessie was integrated. Things have changed, Nash knows that.",
        "Kevin: Well, you hope.",
        "Clint: Yeah -- look, your sister's a grownup, she can take care of herself.",
        "Kevin: Really?",
        "Clint: Really. She'll be here. And if she -- if she's not here, we'll have to find a way to deal with it.",
        "Kevin: All right. Well, I'm going to check out front anyway.",
        "Clint: Yeah, I'm going to go with you, but tell the guys we'll be back in a bit.",
        "Kevin: Ok. Hey -- we'll see you guys at the altar, and congratulations. My sister's in good hands.",
        "Antonio: Thanks, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: All right.",
        "Antonio: I'll take care of her, I promise.",
        "Kevin: Ok.",
        "Clint: I know you will. I couldn't ask for a better son-in-law.",
        "Antonio: Well, I think the same way about my future father-in-law.",
        "Clint: All right.",
        "Cristian: So, how are the nerves?",
        "Antonio: Oh. Well, I got Jessica, Bree and Jamie. No reason to be nervous.",
        "Cristian: You're lying, aren't you?",
        "Antonio: A little. You know, I want to get it right. I don't want to have to do it again.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nash: My God, you look beautiful. You look exactly --",
        "Jessica: Like me. I look exactly like me. I don't understand why everybody keeps on going on and on and on about Tess, because she's not here! She's --",
        "Nash: I never said anything about Tess.",
        "Jessica: Shouldn't you be at the church or something?",
        "Nash: Shouldn't you?",
        "Jessica: I was just on my way out until you broke in here and stabbed Antonio in the back after he treated you better than you deserve!",
        "Nash: That's not what this is about. This isn't about me.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Oh, I know it's not about you. Nash, I am sorry if you're still hurting, but I never led you on.",
        "Nash: You're integrated. I talked to the doctors, and I get it. You're in love with Antonio and you chose him over me, and I get that, too. But you are acting like you're not integrated. You and Antonio are acting like Tess is gone and the old Jessica is back, but that's not what happened. You're a new person with a new heart, and you're not listening to that heart, and it's breaking mine!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Well, tell me, doc, does that chart tell you the color of his eyes?",
        "Dr. Sheridan: Mr. Jones, if you persist, you will have to leave.",
        "Vincent: Listen, man, I went to college with this guy, all right? I know the color of his eyes. I listened to women go on and on and on about his beautiful brown eyes. His eyes are not blue!",
        "Dr. Sheridan: His eyes could be purple for all I care. Do not upset my patient.",
        "Vincent: I'm not upset, you're the one that's upset! You don't want to hear the truth!",
        "Dr. Sheridan: Look, I understand Mr. Hughes is a good friend of yours. Friends and family often get confused --",
        "Vincent: Oh --",
        "Dr. Sheridan: When confronted by a serious illness.",
        "Vincent: Are you trying to say that I am confused?",
        "Dr. Sheridan: I just think you're ups by your friend's condition --",
        "Vincent: You're damn right I'm upset! Listen --",
        "Dr. Sheridan: Hey --",
        "Vincent: Hugh is my-friend. Hugh's eyes are brown. I know the color of his eyes. This man -- this poor guy right here -- I don't even -- his eyes are blue. So you trying to tell me that a car accident is changing the color of a man's eyes?",
        "Dr. Sheridan: All right, all right, calm down. All right? Mr. Hughes needs his sleep. God knows the kind of pain he's in. Every second is a blessing. Calm down.",

        "Adriana: Haven't seen him.",
        "Clint: Ok, I'm going to wait for Jessica outside. Excuse me.",
        "Natalie: I'm going to join you. I need some fresh air.",
        "Adriana: Natalie? Do you think something happened?",
        "Natalie: You know, I warned him not to screw this day up. But with Nash, he's capable of anything.",
        "Bo: You know, there's something different about Kev.",
        "Viki: Yeah, I know. It seems as if he's finally made peace with himself.",
        "Bo: And Duke's baby?",
        "Viki: You know something, Bo? He loves him as if he were his own son. It's amazing -- I thought I knew my son. And after all these years, I'm just now finally finding out who he really is -- and I like him. He's a good man.",
        "Bo: I think I know what you mean.",

        "Todd: Hmm. Truman?",
        "Evangeline: Yeah. A lot of loose ends and unanswered questions. I keep -- I keep thinking I'll just call John to track them down or --",
        "Todd: You'll handle it. You'll handle it.",
        "Evangeline: So, why didn't you want Blair to come?",
        "Todd: Because every time she sees me with you, she goes ape. She makes it about her. I don't want to make Jessica's wedding \"The Todd and Blair Show.\"",
        "Evangeline: Uh -- you're as big of a Drama Queen as Blair is.",
        "Todd: Is that a fact?",
        "Evangeline: Yes.",
        "Todd: Yeah, she still thinks she's the one I want.",

        "Claudia: Mmm.",
        "Blair: How drunk are you?",
        "Claudia: Why?",
        "Blair: What do you feel about, like, crashing a wedding?",
        "Claudia: I loved that movie!",
        "Blair: Did you -- well, if you liked that, baby, you going to love this.",
        "Claudia: Yeah!",
        "Blair: Let's go.",
        "Claudia: Yeah, and -- and knowing Nash the way I do --",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm?",
        "Claudia: Instead of seeing a wedding, we may end up seeing a train wreck.",
        "Blair: \"Train wreck\"? Oh, wow, this should be good. Hey, Phil? You keep the change, big guy. Ooh, there -- you are so cute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I am marrying the man that I love.",
        "Nash: You are not listening to your own heart.",
        "Jessica: No, Nash, you're the one that is not listening. Look at me -- I am in my wedding dress. I'm about to go to the church to marry the man of my dreams -- my dreams. God, the only reason that you're involved in this is because Antonio felt sorry for you.",
        "Nash: He's doing me no favors, believe me!",
        "Jessica: Then don't show up today! It's not about you!",
        "Nash: Don't marry him! Don't marry Antonio. You don't really want to, and you can't promise him 100% of your soul.",
        "Jessica: I am one person now!",
        "Nash: Really?",
        "Jessica: One -- Jessica!",
        "Nash: Well, if you're as integrated as you say you are, then you are ignoring a big part of yourself -- a part of you which is so precious, so beautiful, so wild and exciting. He doesn't love that part of you. He wants to marry you and settle down here in Llanview for the next 50 years -- buy a house, get a dog --",
        "Jessica: I want that, too!",
        "Nash: Everybody does. But you want more. I know you do, even if you don't.",
        "Jessica: Don't tell me what I want and what I don't want. You don't know Antonio. You don't know what we've been through! It hasn't always been easy, and it's not always been my fault! He's grown. We've grown together, and we're going to keep on growing together. So will you give me some damn credit and let me run my life? [Jessica sighs]",
        "Nash: I'll \"give you some damn credit\" when you admit that Tess changed you.",
        "Jessica: She did. She gave me Bree, and now she's gone.",
        "Nash: \"She gave you Bree\"? That's it? [Nash chuckles] Really? You look exactly like her. That -- that -- that dress of yours, that makeup, the way you drink and dance --",
        "Jessica: That's integration, Nash.",
        "Nash: Exactly. You're integrated, which means you're a new person. And until you and Antonio understand that, this wedding is doomed to fail before you even get to the altar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Hey, bill? Hey, what's up, man? It's Vincent Jones. Yeah, man, did you hear about Huey Hughes' accident? Yeah, man, it's bad. He's in bad shape, but at least he's alive, you know? I want to ask you a question -- don't laugh because it's a little weird. I was in his room the other day talking to the nurse, and she said when he opened his eyes, his eyes were blue. Yeah, that's what I thought.",

        "Jessica: You don't know anything about us!",
        "Nash: Really? I was there when you went through a very traumatic, personal experience, but you're walking around like you walked out of it without a scratch!",
        "Jessica: I did.",
        "Nash: Well, then you're not integrated. Jessica, you're confused about o you are. What are you going to do when you're walking down the aisle and you see Antonio at the altar and me standing right beside him?",
