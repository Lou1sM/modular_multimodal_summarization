        "Cristian: You came back to tell me you missed me? You could have -- you could have done it over the phone.",
        "Sarah: The thing is, I wanted to tell you without words.",

        "Jessica: Um -- anyone seen Sarah this morning?",
        "Renee: Well, I passed by her room. The door was open, I poked my head in, she wasn't there, so I assumed she'd come down to breakfast.",
        "Clint: Well, maybe she took an early walk.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no. Sarah doesn't go for walks.",
        "Matthew: Maybe she's with Natalie and Jared. They're not here, either.",
        "[Jared whistles]",
        "Natalie: Oh, god!",

        "Marcie: This looks delicious. I sure do love your home cooking, Celia. Thank you. I've actually had my first decent night's sleep since I -- well, since I left with Aaron.",
        "Celia: Well, that's good.",
        "Marcie: Yeah. And I can't even believe how close I came to being caught last night. If you hadn't covered for me, Wendell --",
        "Wendell: Well, those two men -- they don't look like the type to give up easy.",
        "Marcie: No, they aren't. And I don't quite know how to thank you for protecting Aaron and me.",
        "Celia: Honey, I think we know how.",
        "Marcie: Well, name it.",
        "Wendell: The best way for you to thank us is by leaving here.",

        "Todd: Hmm -- good. I slept good.",

        "Lindsay: Thank you.",

        "Antonio: Sorry. Who did you think it was?",
        "Cristian: Nobody. Nothing. Dot worry about it.",
        "Sarah: Good morning, everybody.",
        "[Good mornings]",
        "Clint: We were just wondering where you were.",
        "Sarah: I'm right here.",
        "Nigel: Good morning, Miss.",
        "Sarah: Good morning, Nigel.",
        "Nigel: Hmm -- there is a breakfast on the sideboard in the dining room.",
        "Sarah: Oh, sorry, dude. It's way too early for solid food.",
        "Clint: Sarah, come on, you got to have something.",
        "Sarah: Uh -- all right. Give me a screwdriver, hold the vodka.",
        "Nigel: Orange juice, straight up, it is. Sara perfect.",
        "Clint: So, did you sleep well?",
        "Sarah: I slept like a log.",
        "Renee: I came by your room. You weren't there.",
        "Sarah: Oh, I got up early. It's so quiet around here.",
        "Nora: You didn't hear those big-mouthed birds? What are they, chickens?",
        "Renee: Crows.",
        "Sarah: I'm used to the sounds of the city, I guess. So I got up and went for a walk. It is gorgeous here early in the morning. I guess that's why great- Grandpa liked it so much.",
        "Renee: Yep. You know, when Asa bought this ranch, he saddled up and he rode every mile of every boundary. He knew every inch of this place, didn't he, Clint?",
        "Clint: Yeah.",
        "Matthew: You know, when dad took me down here last time, we packed up the horses and we rode them down to the pastures, right where those two streams meet up. We -- we went fishing, we camped out, and it was all on Grandpa's land. Ooh, yeah -- and we also saw some cattle, too. He taught me how to herd them. You know what? Why don't we ride some horses today? You think maybe we can --",
        "Nora: You know what? No. No, no, no, we're not going to do that right off the bat. You know, we -- we'll just wait a little bit on that. We -- we're expecting a lawyer to come and read Asa's will, ok?",
        "Sarah: Are you guys nervous?",
        "Jessica: Why should we be nervous?",
        "Sarah: I don't know -- I heard great-Grandpa changed his will.",
        "Renee: He did.",
        "Clint: Yeah -- a couple of months ago.",
        "Renee: It was like he knew there wasn't much time.",
        "Jessica: Nigel, were you there when Grandpa changed his will?",
        "Nigel: Actually, yes. Yes, I was.",
        "Sarah: Hey, where's Natalie? Wasn't she supposed to get up at dawn and go for a walk with that hunky ranch guy?",
        "[Renee chuckles]",
        "Renee: Well, they haven't come back yet, and I don't know where Jared is. He must still be in bed.",
        "Clint: Hmm.",
        "Jessica: I wonder how things went between Natalie and chuck last night.",
        "Nash: You think maybe your sister went for a little roll in the hay with the ranch hand?",
        "[Jessica chuckles]",
        "Jessica: Well, I did everything I could do to promote it. You know, Natalie's been alone a long time, and chuck -- well, chuck is very tall in the saddle.",
        "Nash: Well, I'm just glad that Natalie is thinking about something other than Jared Banks, for once.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: I heard noises. I thought maybe you were in trouble.",
        "Natalie: So you just come barging in here?",
        "Jared: The door was open, ok?",
        "Natalie: That doesn't give you the right to walk in.",
        "Jared: Yeah, well, I guess after I left last night, you made a little more than cocoa, huh, chuck?",
        "Natalie: That's none of your business.",
        "Chuck: Look, the lady doesn't want you here, so --",
        "Jared: Ok, shut your big fat trap, cattle boy.",
        "Chuck: I'm not the one breaking into people's rooms.",
        "Jared: Hey, first of all, I didn't break into anyone's room. Second of all, bite me. This is not your problem.",
        "Natalie: Don't speak to him that way.",
        "Chuck: Look, it's Natalie's problem, and I don't think she likes you shoving your way into her personal life.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, Jared, you hear that? My personal life is none of your business, so do me a favor and get out. And keep your big, fat mouth shut around my family about this.",
        "Jared: Yeah, ok, if I was going to tell anyone, that'd mean I care, and I don't.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Chuck: Well, if you wanted to make him mad, that sure did it.",
        "Natalie: Ah, that service was way above and beyond the call of duty, chuck.",
        "Chuck: Don't mention it. He's not going to jump out from behind something and cut me up, is he?",
        "Natalie: Well, you heard him -- he doesn't give a damn what we do.",
        "Chuck: Yeah, but he didn't mean that.",
        "Natalie: I know.",
        "Chuck: So, I did ok?",
        "Natalie: You were great.",
        "Chuck: Usually jumping into a bed with a pretty little thing like you means a whole other thing.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know.",
        "Chuck: All right if I put my shirt back on?",
        "Natalie: If you have to.",
        "Chuck: So, you going to tell me what's really going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: So, a good night's sleep put you in a better frame of mind?",
        "Todd: Yeah. I have not been sleeping well since Marcie took the kid. I mean, I get to sleep, but then I can't stay asleep. I get all these dreams.",
        "Blair: Yeah. You feel like you've been working all night?",
        "Todd: Yeah. But not last night. No dreams, nothing. Maybe it was the company.",
        "Blair: Maybe.",
        "Todd: Or just maybe it was sleep deprivation catching up with me.",
        "Blair: Hmm. I know I always feel like I sleep better when I'm with you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, me, too. Want some coffee, or --",
        "Blair: Yes. Yeah, I think there's one of those pitiful little coffeemakers in the bathroom.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know, I love those.",
        "Blair: So, you make a pot. You know how I like it.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I know how you like it.",
        "Blair: Mm-hmm. Well? You going to make me the coffee?",
        "Todd: No, I'm not. We got to get going. I'll get you a coffee on the road.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Thanks for listening to me last night.",
        "John: You don't have to thank me.",
        "Marty: No, I just -- you know, when Patrick was murdered, I just wanted to die, too. I just felt so guilty, you know, that I wasn't there.",
        "John: I know what you mean.",
        "Marty: I know you do. I think I've always known. I mean, being able to share this with somebody -- it's like, well, just this huge weight has been lifted off of me. I never thought I would feel this way again.",
        "John: I wasn't sure I could, either.",
        "Marty: So this -- you know, between you and me, it's -- it's a good thing, yeah?",
        "John: It's a good thing.",
        "Marty: I cannot believe we have to get back in the car with Todd and Blair.",
        "John: You might want to take a shower.",
        "Marty: Yeah. You know, there's a coffeemaker in the bathroom.",
        "John: Hmm.",
        "Marty: Hmm.",
        "John: Motel, bathroom, coffeemaker -- hmm.",
        "Marty: Yummy?",
        "John: Yummy. Not so much. Tell you what -- why don't you take your shower? I'll run across the street to the convenience store. Coffee, black, one sugar?",
        "Marty: Yes. So how is it you know everything about me?",
        "John: Be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marcie: You're right. And I completely understand. You know, after everything that you two have been through, I don't want you to get in trouble with the law because of me. That's the last thing you needed.",
        "Wendell: I think it's you who doesn't understand.",
        "Celia: You're welcome to stay here as long as you want.",
        "Wendell: It's true. Just last night was a close call.",
        "Celia: We think it would be best for you to go somewhere else.",
        "Marcie: No, I think it would be best for all of us. I just -- I just -- I don't really know where to go next or -- or what to do.",
        "Celia: We might be able to help with that.",
        "Wendell: A friend of ours wants to help you.",
        "Marcie: Wendell, why did you go and do that for?",
        "Celia: The address is at top, and Wendell wrote out the directions for you. Just tell her we sent you.",
        "Wendell: I tuned up your car this morning, it's running good.",
        "Celia: A little something for you and the baby.",
        "Marcie: No, I -- I -- I can't take this, Celia, I can't.",
        "Wendell: It's not much, but right now, you need it more than we do.",
        "Marcie: No! Wendell, I can't take this. Listen, Aaron and I, we're going to make it. Ok, we are survivors. And besides, I have all that money that my brother still gave me because of your kindness. So please, you have already done enough! Please!",
        "Wendell: No, ma'am.",
        "Marcie: Don't think that you can out-stubborn me, because you can't, ok? Wendell, if this is about your pride, then please help me to keep my pride. Please. Thank you. Celia -- I noticed that you -- you admired my bracelet last night, and, you know, my husband -- he bought this for me on a whim at the mall.",
        "[Marcie chuckles]",
        "Marcie: But I want you to have it.",
        "Celia: Oh, just because I said I liked it doesn't mean I want it.",
        "Marcie: It wasn't expensive. And I'm always going to feel like I owe you, and it'll -- look, it'll just be a really small way of saying \"thank you.\"",
        "Celia: If I say no, are you going to stand around here arguing about it?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, pretty much.",
        "Celia: We don't have time for that.",
        "Marcie: No, we don't, do we? So -- so just take it, ok? Please, just -- just take it.",
        "Celia: Thank you.",
        "Marcie: Hmm.",
        "Marcie: Ok. So -- well, those two guys -- they're going to come looking for me soon, right? They're going to be calling on the car and wanting to know when it's going to be ready, so --",
        "Wendell: Who knows? It might just take me hours to find the part they need.",
        "Marcie: Well, then I think I'd better take advantage of that head start, right?",
        "Celia: I'll pack you some food while you get Aaron ready.",
        "Marcie: I'll never forget you, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bo: The doctor said that -- that you're doing better.",
        "Lindsay: Yeah, I'm doing better. Things are a little hazy. I don't remember everything, but the things I do remember confuse me.",
        "Bo: Yeah. Um -- I'm not here to question you. This isn't an official visit. I just wanted to come by and see how you're doing, that's all.",
        "Lindsay: I'm ok. How are you doing?",
        "Bo: Good. You know, good. I get up, I go to work, then I go home. I eat some takeout, go to bed, get up in a few hours, and go back to work.",
        "Lindsay: That doesn't sound like much of a life.",
        "Bo: No, it -- it's ok.",
        "Lindsay: How's Matthew?",
        "Bo: Matthew's really --",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Bo: Oh -- he's doing good. Excuse me. This is Matthew right now. Hey, bud. What's up?",
        "Matthew: Hey, Dad. You told me to call when I got here, but it was pretty late. I just wanted to let you know that I got here ok.",
        "Bo: Ok, good, good, I appreciate that.",
        "Matthew: Did I call at a bad time?",
        "Bo: You know, I've told you, there's never a bad time for you to call me. I'm here visiting Lindsay.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, tell him I said hi.",
        "Bo: She says hi.",
        "Matthew: You tell her I said hey back.",
        "Bo: He says hi back. So, how's everything going down there?",
        "Matthew: Grandpa's lawyer's getting ready to come over in a little while.",
        "Bo: Good old Beaver Calhoun.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, I'll -- I'll call you after they read the will and let you know what happened.",
        "Bo: Ok, I'd appreciate that. Listen, tell your uncle Clint that he can call me if he needs anything, or if he just wants to talk to me about anything, ok?",
        "Matthew: All right, I will.",
        "Bo: And I'm sorry I'm not down there with you.",
        "Matthew: Yeah, it's ok, Dad. I love you.",
        "Bo: I love you, too, bud. Bye-bye. Ah.",
        "Lindsay: You didn't mention that Matthew was out of town.",
        "Bo: Yeah, yeah, he's down -- he's down there in Texas with the whole family, down at pa's ranch.",
        "Lindsay: Why didn't you go with them?",
        "Bo: Because I've got to work.",
        "Lindsay: Oh, come on. You're the boss. You can take the time off if you want to.",
        "Bo: Maybe, yeah. How about this? I don't want to go down there.",
        "Lindsay: Hmm. You keeping something from me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: You want coffee?",
        "Antonio: Listen, if -- you know, if you have other plans --",
        "Cristian: I don't have any plans. Come on.",
        "Antonio: All right. It's just, you know, when you answered the door, it looked like you were expecting someone -- someone who wasn't me.",
        "Cristian: Just tell me what you want.",
        "Antonio: Well, it's actually really exciting. The accountant wants the fourth- quarter stuff for Capricorn as close as possible after the end of the year.",
        "Cristian: Not a problem. I don't seem to be doing anything but work, anyway.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. Yeah, that's what Jamie says about me.",
        "Cristian: How is my cutie little niece?",
        "Antonio: Missing Jessica and the baby.",
        "Cristian: What about you?",
        "Antonio: Trying not to. You?",
        "Cristian: I'm good.",
        "Antonio: Huh? Who's got you sleeping on the couch?",
        "Cristian: Nobody. I just fell asleep reading.",
        "Antonio: Hmm, I see. So, you are sleeping, working, and reading?",
        "Cristian: Sounds familiar?",
        "Antonio: Well, actually, I got Jamie. See, I was putting her to sleep last night, and she said, \"Papi, you know what? You're my best friend.\"",
        "Cristian: Such a great kid.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, yeah. You know, Cris, you have to do something with your life besides work. What about your painting?",
        "Cristian: Come on, man, don't lecture me.",
        "Antonio: All right, I'm not.",
        "Cristian: I don't know. I guess I got out of the habit of painting when Sarah was here.",
        "Antonio: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: I mean, her stuff was all over the place, and you know how I like to work when -- when I'm alone.",
        "Antonio: Didn't she move in with Layla?",
        "Cristian: Oh, yeah. Yeah -- what a relief.",
        "Antonio: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Cristian: Well, we'd -- we'd come home at night from the club and she'd want to stay up talking about how the night went, and, you know, she'd show up with a C.D. from some band that I had to listen to, cranking it up on my stereo. I mean, I think she ruined my amp. And her eating habits -- I mean, I'd wake up and she'd be grilling grilled cheese for breakfast. And then she'd decide she was getting too fat, and guess what -- my fridge would be full of berries, yogurt, and god knows what. It was a nightmare.",
        "Antonio: Yeah, I don't believe it.",
        "Cristian: I'm serious. It was a nightmare, believe me. It's all true.",
        "Antonio: No, that's not what I'm talking about.",
        "Cristian: What are you talking about?",
        "Antonio: You miss her, don't you? You miss Sarah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: So you haven't seen Jared or Natalie since they both went to sleep last night?",
        "Renee: No, is there a problem?",
        "Jessica: Well, chuck is probably showing Natalie the ranch.",
        "Nash: Yeah, and Jared is probably stealing the silverware.",
        "Renee: Ugh.",
        "Sarah: Will you guys lay off of him?",
        "Clint: Didn't we have a talk about this just last night?",
        "Sarah: Exactly. Jared is my guest, and that's all there is to it.",
        "Jared: And I am very grateful that I am.",
        "Renee: Good morning, Jared. We were all wondering where you were.",
        "Jared: I was just checking out this amazing house. I've gotten so much insight into how Asa grew up and became the man that he was.",
        "Nigel: Between insights, would you care for coffee?",
        "Jared: Oh, yeah, thanks, Nigel. Sorry. I sound a little full of myself.",
        "Renee: Not a bit of it. I am so thrilled that you get to see all of this place.",
        "Jared: Well, I am lucky man. Not only do I get to learn more about one of my heroes, I get to do it in the company of two beautiful women -- Sarah and you, Renee.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chuck: I'm still not sure I understand.",
        "Natalie: Well, Jared keeps telling me what I'm thinking and what I want. So he needed to be put in his place.",
        "Chuck: You think that did it?",

        "Ramsey: FBI We have reason to believe this woman is here. If she is, I would not want to be you. Harboring a fugitive is not a parking ticket.",

        "Blair: Well, from the look on your face, I don't think I slept as well as you did.",
        "John: Ok. I'll check in later.",
        "Todd: What was that about?",
        "John: That was the County Clerk's office. Clarence Jenkins' family home was destroyed in the hurricane. There's nothing left.",

        "John: Just the place in Decatur.",

        "Bo: Well, it's no secret. The whole family went down to Pa's ranch because that's where his will is being read.",
        "Lindsay: And you didn't go because?",
        "Bo: Well, if -- if I was down there, it really wouldn't change anything.",

        "Bo: Uh, I'm sure that somebody's going to give me a call just as soon as everything's finished.",
        "Lindsay: Uh-huh. What's the real reason you didn't go?",
        "Bo: Oh, I had some issues with pa before he died, the way he led his life. And it just seemed like going all the way down to Texas to hear this will read, it -- it was like he was jerking my chain one last time and I -- I just didn't like the feeling. And besides that, it really wasn't a good time to leave.",
        "Lindsay: Please don't tell me that you stayed here because of me.",
        "Bo: Well, the last time I went to Texas --",
        "Lindsay: Yeah?",
        "Bo: You ended up in this place, you know?",
        "Lindsay: Well, I don't think that you going to Texas had anything to do with me ending up in this place.",
        "Bo: Ok. Then let me put it this way -- I didn't go down there because I didn't want to go down there, and then we could just leave it at that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Did you call your dad?",
        "Matthew: Yeah, but we couldn't talk for very long. He was with Lindsay. Uh -- uncle Clint, my dad said if you need anything, just give him a call.",
        "Clint: Thank you, Matthew.",
        "Natalie: Oh, well, good morning, everyone. I hope all of you had good of a night as I did last night.",
        "Jessica: Oh, is there something going on that we should know about?",
        "Natalie: All I can say is I had the best night that I've had in a long time. I was all knotted up and now I feel so relaxed.",
        "Renee: Morning, chuck.",
        "Chuck: Miss Renee.",
        "Renee: Are you responsible for Natalie's good mood? I know you two were going to saddle up earlier this morning.",

        "Natalie: I'd love to take a ride.",
        "Jared: Ahem.",
        "Clint: Uh -- chuck? Keep an eye on her, would you? Been a long while since she's been in the saddle.",
        "Natalie: Oh, that's ok. Chuck he is an expert, so I'm in good hands.",

        "Chuck: Yeah, I think so.",

        "Clint: What was that about?",

        "Jessica: But we definitely have our suspicions. Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: So, where do we go from here? You're out of leads and your friend at the FBI is not going to help us anymore.",

        "Wendell: I don't know about her, either.",
        "Ramsey: That's funny because we tracked her here through your wife's brother. Now, unless you want your towing license pulled --",
        "Wendell: You can't do that.",
        "Ramsey: And I can have your wife's high-heeled brother thrown in jail. How do you think lipstick is going to play in the Decatur, Georgia, city lockup?",
        "Celia: Leave Clarence out of this.",

        "Celia: Right, just a minute. It's the man you towed last night.",
        "Wendell: Tell him his car's ready, and I found his cell phone, too. I'll bring them over to the motel.",
        "Celia: The car's ready -- he's got your phone, too. He'll drop them off, but it might be a while.",

        "Cristian: She's all right.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. Look, I -- I'm no one to, you know, give advice on romance and relationships -- but I'm going to anyway. If you feel something for her, go for it.",

        "Antonio: Why's that?",
        "Cristian: Well, she kind of gave me an opening.",

        "Matthew: Why do they call you \"Beaver\"?",
        "Beaver: Long story, son, but you didn't come all the way down here to hear that. You came to hear Asa's last wishes, and I think you'll find that Asa had a different way of looking at everything, including his will.",

        "Lindsay: You know what would be really great? If Matthew could come visit me when he gets back.",

        "Antonio: Because of Evangeline?",
        "Cristian: It just doesn't feel right going out.",
        "Antonio: Hmm. I see. So -- so Sarah, she -- she just backed off?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, she's eyeing some guy now, some guy named Jared Banks.",
        "Antonio: Oh. He's the -- he's the guy who -- who bought my share of Nash's vineyard.",

        "Cristian: No, because I'm a good judge of character.",
        "Antonio: Oh, right, of course. Have -- have you had a chance to talk to her about him?",
        "Cristian: Yeah, but it didn't work. You know, Natalie doesn't like the guy, either.",
        "Antonio: Yeah -- why not?",
        "Cristian: She just said she doesn't trust him.",
        "Antonio: Hmm.",
        "Cristian: She thinks he's trying to work his way into the Buchanan empire.",
        "Antonio: Oh, I see. Is that why he -- he tried to buy into the vineyard? Could he be a threat to Jessica?",
        "Cristian: I don't know, I don't know, but I just wish that if Sarah was trying to prove a point, she'd do it with someone else.",
        "Antonio: Listen, if you want me to look into this guy's background, I can --",
        "Cristian: No, Antonio, Sarah's got to figure things out for herself. And as far as Jessica goes, she's married to Nash, ok? So this Banks guy -- that's their problem, not yours.",
        "Antonio: Right. Right, right.",
        "Cristian: Look, I don't want to talk about this. Why don't we talk about your love life? What's going on?",
        "Antonio: You know what? I'm due back at the station. Why don't -- why don't you let me know when you can go over those books from Capricorn with me?",
        "Cristian: Whenever's good for you.",

        "Chuck: Yes, sir.",
        "Beaver: Well, you might want to stick around. There's a bequest for you in Asa's will. Now, I'm sure you all know that it was Asa's wish to have the reading of his last will and testament done right here at the ranch. I don't mind at all. It's a good place, this ranch. I've got an associate doing a reading for Asa's grandsons -- uh, what's his name now? -- Kevin and Joey and Cord over in London right now. Probably about tea time now over there.",
        "Clint: Could we get to the reading of the will?",
