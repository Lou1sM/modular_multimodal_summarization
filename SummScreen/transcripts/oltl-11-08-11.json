        "Jack lets Neela hide at La Boulaie. Vimal and Rama try to find her and get a call from Vimal and Neela's father who wonders why his daughter has not returned and why he can't talk to her. Rama goes to find her and she reveals that she has met a boy she really likes named Jack Manning. Rama remembers who Jack is and is concerned. Jack is still hell bent on making Todd pay for taking his father's company and his life and for getting away with murder. Tomas also wants to find out if Todd killed Victor and seems a bit biased to believe he did so that Tomas can have a future with Blair. Tea reveals to Viki that she is pregnant by Victor. Viki is delighted. Clint finds out that Viki has secretly gotten Tea to petition the court to let Clint attend Natalie's wedding and that she's worried she's gotten his hopes up for nothing when Tea tells her the request was denied."

        "Tom\u00e1s: Looking at it right now.",
        "Blair: So what do you think? Could Baker have done it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: This ought to keep Tom\u00e1s off my back for a little while.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Todd: Hello?",
        "T\u00e9a: You busy?",
        "Todd: Maybe come on in. Is everything all right? Is Dani all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, yeah. She's fine. I-I'm fine. I, um... I have news about Victor.",
        "Todd: They caught his killer?",
        "T\u00e9a: . [Laughs] Not yet. I'm not -- I'm not here about that.",
        "Todd: Is it about the will? Because if Tina changed her mind --",
        "T\u00e9a: No, no, no. It's not about that either.",
        "Todd: Then what is it?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm pregnant... with Victor's child. I-I wanted to tell you in person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: It's gone! It's gone! I told you we should have taken it with us or hired a guard or...",
        "Rama: It's right here, Vimal. The cleaning crew must have moved it.",
        "Vimal: I was hoping that it meant that she'd come back.",
        "Rama: We know she's all right, Vimal.: Vimal: No, we know nothing of the kind. She's a child.",
        "Rama: She's a teenage girl who flew all the way from Mumbai on her own.",
        "Vimal: Rama, she's been missing all night. She may be down at the docks. Saw her. There's criminals over there. The police are constantly combing the river for murder weapons and bodies.",
        "Rama: Vimal, we saw her run away, okay? She's fine.",
        "Vimal: She was dragged away by that juvenile delinquent.",
        "Rama: A handsome boy in a clean shirt and new pants. Vimal, which he probably removed to fulfill his lust.",
        "Rama: Stop it! Relax! Calm down, okay? You and I can do anything together if we put our mind to it? Just chill out, all right? Promise you we'll find your sister.",
        "Neela: Enough, Vimal. Stop calling me. I'm not going to answer. I won't let you send me back to India, not now, not when I've met...Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: I, uh -- I don't even know where to start.",
        "Clint: Natalie, say what you need to say. I can take it.",
        "Natalie: You know, everyone thinks that what you did to Rex and Jessica was unforgivable.",
        "Clint: Are you one of them?",
        "Natalie: After what I did, I don't really have room to judge.",
        "Viki: Good morning.",
        "Clint: Good morning.",
        "Viki: Lois said you, uh, didn't have breakfast.",
        "Clint: Not hungry. [Clears throat). She really has grown up since she had Liam.",
        "Viki: Yes. Yes, she has.",
        "Clint: How I wish I could be there today.",
        "Viki: I know. If there were anything I could do, I would, you know.",
        "Clint: Uh, maybe it's for the best.",
        "Viki: What do you mean?",
        "Clint: Oh, I forgot to tell you. I called the tech crew at B.E. They sent a videographer over to the church, and they're gonna hook up a live feed. It's gonna go right to my computer, so I'll be able to watch the wedding. It won't be the same, of course, but at least it's something. I'm gonna check in with them.",
        "Viki: I need an answer, and I need an answer now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Baker's on the list.",
        "Blair: But you don't think he did it?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: T's too soon to tell. Right now, I'm looking at anybody with motive and opportunity.",
        "Blair: Anybody in particular? L",
        "Tom\u00e1s: There's already been too much finger-pointing already, Blair.",
        "Blair: All right. Well, I guess we'll be able to discuss that tonight.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Right. Our brainstorming session.",
        "Blair: Unless, of course, you want to change your mind about that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No, no. I want to put our heads together. I just hope it can be about something other than just work.",
        "Blair: We'll see.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yes, we will.",
        "Blair: Well, pick me up at 8:00.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Will do.",
        "David: Blair, you look horrible. Not to worry. Uncle David's here. He can fix anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clint: Viki, what do you think of this? They're gonna put the camera on the altar and sort of looking at Natalie as she's facing the minister.",
        "Viki: I don't think the church will allow you to do that.",
        "Clint: Well, then, the only other place to put it is in the front pew, and that means I'm gonna get a continuous view of my daughter's back.",
        "Viki: Clint, wait a minute. What did you mean before when you said you thought it was just as well -- it might be just as well that you weren't there today?",
        "Clint: You got a short memory, Viki. The last time I took my two t daughters down the aisle, I ruined everything, for both Natalie and Jessica, and then you let me have it.",
        "Viki: A lot has changed since then.",
        "Clint: And you'd still let me have it if I crossed that line.",
        "Viki: Yes. I thought that's what you liked about me.",
        "Clint: Ah, among other things.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Viki: Excuse me. Hi, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hey, Ms. Lord. I have Mr. Buchanan's tuxedo.",
        "Viki: Oh! Oh, hang on, hang on. Here we go. That's for you.",
        "Katie: Enjoy the wedding.",
        "Viki: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Clint: That's my tux.",
        "Viki: Is it?",
        "Clint: You know it is. Now, why'd you get it dry-cleaned? I'm not going to the wedding. I'm under house arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rama: We spoke to Neela last night.",
        "Vimal: No, you spoke to Neela last night.",
        "Rama: And she said she's fine!",
        "Vimal: Well, we haven't heard from her since. And I've called her 27 times!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Vimal: Ooh. Where are you?! Are you all right?!",
        "Jumby: Vimal? Vimal?",
        "Vimal: It's Jumby. I told him she'd be on the next plane back. She should have arrived by now. I-I can't tell him she's missing.",
        "Rama: Then why did you answer the phone? You have to speak to the man, okay?",
        "Vimal: Jumby! Is that you?!",
        "Jumby: Vimal.",
        "Vimal: Sorry. [Hisses] It's a bad connection.",
        "Jumby: Um, now, where is Neela? She wasn't on the plane.",
        "Rama: Okay, but she obviously wasn't on the plane. She's here in Llanview.",
        "Vimal: Well, what do I tell him?",
        "Rama: You know your father. Tell him that he wrote down the wrong flight number or something.",
        "Vimal: Oh, perfect. Jumby, um, did you write down the flight number?!",
        "Jumby: Yes, of course.",
        "Vimal: Oh. Uh, let me just check to make sure that I gave you the right one!",
        "Jumby: There was only one flight, Vimal. Your mother is talking to the airline. No one has seen her. We're very worried.",
        "Vimal: No. There is no reason to worry, Jumby. I'm sure that Neela's fine. Jumby What do you mean you're sure? What's going on, huh? Are you telling me the truth?",
        "Vimal: Yes, of course. Jumby, I always try to tell you the truth.",
        "Jumby: Vimal, please. If your sister is in trouble --",
        "Vimal: No, no! Neela is not in trouble.",
        "Jumby: Then why isn't she here?",
        "Vimal: Because -- because she was not on that flight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So...did you sleep okay?",
        "Neela: [Chuckles] Like an angel. Thank you for hiding me here last night.",
        "Jack: Oh, sure. Um... I don't really know what you eat for breakfast.",
        "Neela: Fruit is perfect.",
        "Jack: I, um- I brought you some clothes. They're my sister's. Unless you want me to run back to The Sun and grab your suitcase.",
        "Neela: No, please. I'm sure my brother has that suitcase booby-trapped. He'll catch you, or he'll plow you back here, and then he'll send me back to India to marry that frog. But I'll never let that happen, never, because I don't want to marry a boy like...",
        "Jack: A boy like who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You're pregnant.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Todd: That's, uh... um... congratulations. Congratulations.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know it won't bring Victor back, but, um, I have a part of him., I've been going through a pretty rough time, Todd, and, uh... now I-I feel like I still have him with me. It gives me a reason to -- to wake up in the morning.",
        "Todd: I'm happy for you... really.",
        "T\u00e9a: Haven't told Dani yet, but I'm pretty sure she's gonna be thrilled.",
        "Todd: Maybe our idiot brother will drop his obsession with solving Victor's murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Ah, Mr. Calmar. Thank you for coming.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Whatever I can do, Tom\u00e1s. You know that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Thank you. Were you able to find out if Baker was in custody the night that Victor was murdered?",
        "Mr. Calmar: From what I was able to ascertain, yes, the Feds had him.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: When did they let him go?",
        "Mr. Calmar: When they released Irene.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So he couldn't have killed Victor.",
        "Mr. Calmar: I think that's a safe assumption. Although Todd Manning doesn't agree.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Todd Manning has no proof.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Not the first time a tabloid has taken license with the truth.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No monsieur. I think it's more than that. Manning implicates Baker, it takes the heat off of him.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Tom\u00e1s, a few weeks ago, you were willing to go to prison for this man. Now you want to send him there yourself?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No, , no. Only if he's guilty.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Forgive me, my friend, but is it possible that your motive is personal?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: What do you mean?",
        "Mr. Calmar: With Todd out of the way, you're guaranteed a future with Blair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: What the hell are you doing here, David?",
        "David: Is that any way to greet your favorite uncle?",
        "Blair: Kelly's father is my favorite uncle.",
        "David: You've never met Kelly's father. Don't even know who he is.",
        "Blair: True. Yet by comparison, he's still a better uncle than you could ever hope to be.",
        "David: That hurts, Blair. But you know what? I'm not gonna let your negativity bring me down. I'm on top of the world. I just wrapped my movie in Sweden, which is gonna be a huge hit, by the way. I'm on my way to D.C. to see Dorian. We're gonna end our three-month dry spell.",
        "Blair: Gross.",
        "David: Jealous?",
        "Blair: Of what?",
        "David: My wit, my looks, my charm?",
        "Blair: What are you doing here, David?",
        "David: Dorian sent me.",
        "Blair: For what?",
        "David: Two things. Number one, did you vote?",
        "Blair: Yes!",
        "David: For her?",
        "Blair: Yes! What's the second?",
        "David: I'm supposed to make sure that Todd Manning stays out of your life forever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Oh, I had your tuxedo cleaned. Well, I mean, I-I thought that, uh, Cord could wear it, because you know that Tina roped him into being Brody's best man, and Cord didn't bring a tuxedo.",
        "Clint: Cord and I are not the same size.",
        "Viki: Well, close enough, you know? I-I had it altered a little bit.",
        "Clint: You altered by tuxedo?",
        "Viki: No, I didn't alter your tuxedo. Okay, I didn't want to tell you like this because I didn't want you to be disappointed, but a week ago, I ask T\u00e9a to petition then' court for special permission for you to attend Natalie's wedding.",
        "Clint: Oh, God. Viki, that's wonderful.",
        "Viki: Well, no, no, no. No, no, no. We haven't got an answer yet. So please don't get your hopes up..",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: Jumby, Neela was not on that flight because you see, because --",
        "Rama: She was bumped.",
        "Jumby: Bumped?",
        "Rama: Yeah. The flight was overbooked, so she --",
        "Jumby: Rama, uh, is that you?",
        "Rama: Yes, papa \"j,\" it's me.",
        "Jumby: Uh, so, when is my daughter coming home?",
        "Rama: Uh, t-the airline has promised us that she will be on the first flight available. It's just that, you know, t-there's such few seats, and it's overbooked, and it'll just take a day or two, you know? But we'll let you know as soon as possible.",
        "Jumby: Uh, put Neela on the phone.",
        "Rama: Put Neela on the phone?",
        "Jumby: Yes. Put her on the phone.",
        "Rama: Uh, you -- you can't speak to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neela: I want to marry someone I love. Arranged marriages are so my father's generation, but he's insisting, and he always gets his way.",
        "Jack: Tell me about it. You know Scarface, the guy who killed my dad? He's using the newspaper he stole from him to pin the murder on someone else.",
        "Neela: That's terrible.",
        "Jack: Tell me about it. Look... this used to my dad's face. And now look. It's Scarface. He trying to make it like my dad never existed.",
        "Neela: He must be an evil man.",
        "Jack: Totally. But he's not gonna get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, Blair told me he's been asking a lot of questions.",
        "Todd: He's trying to pin your husband's murder on me after everything I did to keep him out of jail.",
        "T\u00e9a: Look, don't take it personally, okay? My brother loves me. He wants closure for Dani and me. I know you didn't kill my husband.",
        "Todd: Well, nice to know I got at least one person on my side. It was Baker. I know firsthand what -- what he's capable of. I tried to tell your brother that, but good luck telling him anything.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, he's very thorough.",
        "Todd: No. He just wants me out of the way.",
        "T\u00e9a: I don't think that's true.",
        "Todd: Really? Who is he dating?",
        "T\u00e9a: You think he's jealous of you?",
        "Todd: He's dating Blair. He sees me as some kind of threat.",
        "T\u00e9a: Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Dorian sent you all h this way to keep Todd away from me?",
        "David: She says it's been on her mind since you pulled that slug out of him.",
        "Blair: He was dying!",
        "David: She wishes you let him.",
        "Blair: He's the father of my children.",
        "David: She said you'd say that. See, she doesn't buy it. She thinks you still have feelings for him.",
        "Blair: [Scoffs]",
        "David: Uh-huh. You hesitated. She said you'd hesitate.",
        "Blair: So what if I hesitated, okay? I'm with Tom\u00e1s now. He wants a life with me, a future.",
        "David: And Todd doesn't, so we're done here. I can go.",
        "Blair: It's not that simple, David.",
        "David: Why not?",
        "Blair: Let's -- let's go trick-or-treating.",
        "Todd: Um, I'm -- I'm not gonna make that.",
        "Blair: You're not? Why not?",
        "Todd: Uh, I-I can't.",
        "Blair: Why not?",
        "Todd: Well, 'cause it's like -- like -- well, I got plans, like --",
        "Blair: Are you all right?",
        "Todd: Yeah. Sam, I'll, um -- I'll make it up to you. I-I'll take you next year, all right?",
        "Sam: Promise?",
        "Todd: Yeah, I promise.",
        "Blair: Okay.",
        "David: You're hesitating again.",
        "Blair: Okay, you know, if you really must know, Mr. Nosy butt, Todd came over here on Halloween, all right? I felt that he wanted to say something to me, but he didn't.",
        "David: Classic Todd, isn't it?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "David: He's too scared to let his real feelings out. Here's my advice --",
        "Blair: [Groans]",
        "David: No, to. Yes, Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Blair: You know what, David? You're absolutely right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: I'm actually a little concerned that we haven't heard, because we should have had an answer by now.",
        "Clint: Well, you know how backed up the courts are. But Delgado is the best. She will get it done. And then thanks to you, I will be walking my daughter down the aisle.",
        "Viki: Hopefully, okay? Besides, it was just a phone call.",
        "Clint: It was more than that.",
        "Viki: Oh, Clint, please, promise me, don't get your hopes up.",
        "Clint: My clean tuxedo tells me that you're pretty darn confident.",
        "Viki: No, I'm not! [Sighs] Look, if -- if you were going to walk Natalie down the aisle, you can't do it in a sports jacket, right? So I had to be prepared, I mean, just in case",
        "Clint: Wait a minute. I got to write a toast. I can't show up at the reception with nothing to say. And don't you worry. I am not going to embarrass you. I am gonna get it [Smooches] Just right.",
        "Viki: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jumby: I want to speak to my daughter. Why is this a problem?",
        "Rama: There's no problem.",
        "Jumby: Then put her on the phone.",
        "Rama: Uh, you want me to put Neela on the phone?",
        "Jumby: Yes.",
        "Rama: Uh, I can't. She can't speak to you.",
        "Jumby: Why not?",
        "Rama: Because -- because...",
        "Vimal: Jumby, it's Vimal. Sorry. I had to go take care of something. Neela can't come to the phone right now because she's sleeping.",
        "Jumby: She's sleeping? Now?",
        "Vimal: Yes, because of the jet lag.? And then we had to wake up early to pack, and then the ordeal at the airport -- whoa. So she's really exhausted. But we'll let you know when we find out more. Give my love to Mommy. Bye.",
        "Rama: Oh, thank God, Vimal. You saved me.",
        "Vimal: No, you saved me. Now we just have to save Neela.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Neela: I'm so sorry, Jack. To lose your father and then to have the man who murdered him s steal his birthright -- that must be so horrible for you. But when you say you won't let him get away with it, what do you mean? I'm only asking because you told me that this man, Todd Manning, owns the newspaper free and clear. So what can you possibly do about it?",
        "Jack: A lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: You are the last person I'm going to discuss Blair with.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Scoffs] What was I thinking, trying to get a straight answer from you?",
        "Todd: Let me ask you something. Why do you care anyway?",
        "T\u00e9a: She's dating my brother. And with your history with her, I'd have to say I'm rooting for him.",
        "Todd: Wow. Thanks.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, come on, Todd. Every time she's let you back into her life, you've hurt her.",
        "Todd: No. Don't confuse me with my brother.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, there's no chance of that.",
        "Todd: I'm just saying, a lot of that wasn't even me.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Scoffs] Blair has turned herself inside of out trying to get over you. Yeah. She's very happy with Tom\u00e1s who's ready to give you a fight. So, uh, watch out if I were you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Claude, you know me better than that.",
        "Mr. Calmar: I know how much you care for this woman.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: All the more reason to find out if her ex-husband killed his brother. I made a promise to my sister to find Victor's killer, and I intend to do that no matter where it leads me. Now, this photograph that I forwarded to you last night, the man who was meeting with Manning -- did you find him?",
        "Mr. Calmar: It's remarkable how much detail you can get from a cell phone. He's a homeless man, a Vietnam vet and sometimes police informant named Louis Dupree.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Louie.",
        "Mr. Calmar: You know him?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: [Sighs] Manning told the police that the gun he took from Dorian Lord's safe the night that Victor was shot -- that he gave it to his good pal Louie.",
        "Mr. Calmar: The man Irene supposedly killed?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Yeah, one and the same. And then last night, I'm standing in Todd Manning's office, and I'm asking him about Louie. Meanwhile, Louis Dupree is sitting right there in front of me.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a's got my number. She can call me anytime. I'd love to talk to her, provided I'm not in the middle of something as I am right now.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I don't believe we've met.",
        "Todd: Let's skip the pleasantries, okay?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: I'm not gonna take too much of your time. I just need some answers for my sister. She's asked me to look into Victor's murder. My sister's husband -- Todd's brother, Victor -- was shot to death recently.",
        "Louie: I heard something about that.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: And I promised her I'd get to the bottom of it.",
        "Louie: Well, I see. Then I imagine you will want some privacy.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Interesting. He said nothing?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Not a word. And I know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Do you have a pen? I need to write that down. You just admitted I was right.",
        "Blair: Todd is afraid of his feelings. He always has been.",
        "David: Even more reason to write him off.",
        "Blair: And he probably thinks I'm with Tom\u00e1s already, so he's afraid of getting hurt, so I have to make -- I have to make the first move.",
        "David: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you saying?",
        "Blair: I'm saying that if I want to know how Todd really feels, I have to find him and make him tell me.",
        "David: You're gonna confront Todd? Why?",
        "Blair: Well, it's like you said. He's not gonna come to me, right?",
        "David: Even more reason to move on with Tom\u00e1s.",
        "Blair: No, I can't do that. I can't do that until I know where things stand with Todd.",
        "David: You're never gonna know where things stand with Todd. He doesn't have the guts to tell you.",
        "Blair: Oh, come on. Guts don't have anything to do with it, any more than guts had anything to do with Dorian picking you.",
        "David: I have plenty of guts, gorgeous guts. In fact, you should see the director's cut of my have-a-seat commercial.",
        "Blair: I'm gonna go find Todd.",
        "David: Blair, you are making a huge mistake.. So what if Todd has feelings for you? Does that mean you're gonna dump Tom\u00e1s?",
        "Blair: No! I- don't know. But, you know, I care about both of them, David, and I can't make a full decision until both of their cards are on the table.",
        "David: Uh, no, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let you do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone buzzes]",
        "T\u00e9a: Ooh. I got messages stacking up. I got to go. But think about what I said?",
        "Todd: Sure. What'd you say? Just kidding.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Scoffs]",
        "Todd: That's great news. Especially for Sam. He's gonna have a little sister or brother.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. And you'll have a niece or nephew.",
        "Todd: T\u00e9a's pregnant with Victor's kid? You take my life, Victor, I take yours. Maybe everything's gonna be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom\u00e1s: Money was changing hands. Manning was paying him off when I walked in.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Paying him for his silence?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: No, for the gun. If Louie's alive, he's got the gun. It's the only explanation. I walked in asking questions about Louie. Louie's sitting there right in front of me. Why doesn't Todd just introduce him to me, say, \"This is the guy that can clear my name? Done\"?",
        "Mr. Calmar: Perhaps he doesn't trust you.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: It's not me he doesn't trust. I walked in. I interrupted something. Manning wasn't sure that he had Louie nailed down. That's why he kept his mouth shut.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Where are you going?",
        "Tom\u00e1s: If I'm right about this, if Manning just bought the gun that can prove he killed his brother, the next step is to destroy it.",
        "Mr. Calmar: Tom\u00e1s, be careful. Manning is dangerous.",
        "Tom\u00e1s: So am I.",

        "Neela: Jack, what can you do? Todd Manning's a powerful man.",
        "Jack: And I'm not?",

        "Jack: I'll be back. Stay here.",
        "Neela: Where are you going?",
        "Jack: I've got something l I need to take care of.",
        "Neela: I'll go with you.",
        "Jack: No. I have to do this alone.",
        "Neela: Do what?",
        "Jack: It's better if you don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vimal: What if Neela was not all right when you talked to her?",
        "Rama: What do you mean, Vimal? She told me herself.",
        "Vimal: What if her captors forced her to say so?",
        "Rama: Captors?! It was one boy!",
        "Vimal: And now they've done something to her.",
        "Rama: Vimal, I'm sure she's fine.",
        "Vimal: No, but we have no way to know! I-I should have called the police right away.",
        "Rama: All right. I'll go with you.",
        "Vimal: No, no, no, h! You stay here in case she comes back.",
        "Rama: Okay, I'll stay here.",
        "Vimal: Take this with me. Maybe they can have their dogs follow the scent. [Groans] I can't think about that. My little sister at the bottom of the Llantano River, killed by some boy?",
        "Rama: Vimal, she laughed, okay? I'm certain she's fine. Just remember she's a teenager.",
        "Vimal: Just say a prayer for her, please. And keep trying her phone.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Neela: Vimal, stop calling me.",

        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Viki: oh, T\u00e9a! T\u00e9a, I just left you two messages. [Stammers] Do you have an answer?",
        "T\u00e9a: Uh, yes, I do. I just heard from the judge's clerk. Um, I'm sorry. The judge turned down the request. Clint won't be allowed to attend his daughter's wedding.",

        "Rama: Neela, please don't hang up.",
        "Neela: I'm not going back to India. I won't marry a boy I don't love.",

        "Neela: Without Vimal?",
        "Rama: Yes, just you and me. Now tell me, where are you?",
        "Neela: At this big house called La Boulaie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Victor, you won't be there when your son is born. I know what it's like to miss a kin. I'll look after your family for you. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. Things are looking up for me. I'm in the clear with the gun. Tom\u00e1s is off somewhere, chasing his bilingual tail. Yeah, all I got to do now is get the circulation up with the paper, win back Blair before Tom\u00e1s gets his hands on her...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Come in.",
        "T\u00e9a: I'm really sorry.",
        "Viki: It's not your fault. Actually, the judicial system has been very kind to Clint, letting him live here instead of a cell at Statesville.",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, still, it's his daughter's wedding. I wish I'd been able to make this happen for both of you.",
        "Viki: Thank you for trying.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. Well, at least we didn't tell him that we put in the request, so that way, the disappointment won't make missing the ceremony. Oh, no.",
        "Viki: I had to tell him he was here when the cleaner's delivered his tuxedo, and he got all excited, and he's writing a toast.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh... Viki, I am so sorry.",
        "Viki: It'll be all right. He's had, uh, I don't know, a video feed...hooked up from the church to his computer, so he will be able to see the ceremony. And I'm sure that Natalie and Brody will come by after the ceremony. So I-it's gonna be fine.",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",
        "Viki: How are you? I'm sure this hasn't been an easy few weeks for you.",
        "T\u00e9a: No. Um... I got some good news today. Um...it's still very early, and I haven't told Dani yet. Um...I'm pregnant... [Laughs] ...With Victor's baby.",
        "Viki: Oh, oh, oh!",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Get out of my place, David!",
        "David: Listen, no. I can't. I can't let you run back to Todd. Dorian would kill me. Of course, she'd refuse to have sex with me. Did I mention it's been three months?",
        "Blair: [Sighs, groans] I cannot deal with your love life right now, 'cause I have to deal with my own.",
        "David: All right. Fine. But you know what? You're no longer my second-favorite niece.",

        "Viki: [Gasps]",
        "T\u00e9a: Especially since I-I had always thought Dani was his. And then when I found out that she was Todd's, I was broken-hearted, you know?",
        "Viki: But now you will have a child of his.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah.",
        "Viki: And I'll have a new niece or nephew.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Laughs]",
        "Viki: It's absolutely wonderful.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Sobs] [Voice breaking] I thought -- I thought that it would never happen and now it has. [Laughs] It's like he's reached down -- or, in his case, up... [Both laugh] ...and he's -- he's given me this gift. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Yeah, of course, she voted for you, baby. Twice. Todd -- no, no. She's done with him. I took care of that. I know. But we will. I can't wait to see you, too. Bye.",
        "Todd: What are you doing here, Vickers? Where's Blair? I need to talk to her.",
        "David: Aah! What about?",
        "Todd: Well, not that it's any of your business, but Blair and I started a conversation on Halloween, and I want to finish it. There's something I need to tell her. Where is she?",
        "David: What's so urgent?",
        "Todd: I want her back.",

        "Viki: Are you feeling all right?",
        "T\u00e9a: Ah. I-I-I can't even process that this is what's happening. All the symptoms, I thought they were all just stress-related.",
        "Viki: But you had a test done.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I had it done yesterday. I-I still can't believe it. [Laughs] I knew it, uh -- I knew that Victor wanted more children.",
        "Viki: He'd be so happy.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Laughs] Oh, he'd be insane",
        "Viki: Yeah, he would.",
        "T\u00e9a: [Voice breaking] I miss him so much.",
        "Viki: I know you do, sweetheart. I do, too.",
        "T\u00e9a: Thank you. Not everyone feels that way.",
        "Viki: Well, not everyone knew him the way you did.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're right. Uh, I should actually go. [Laughs]",
        "Viki: Thank you for telling me. Hey, if there is anything at all that you need, okay?",
        "T\u00e9a: I'll call you. [Sobs]",
