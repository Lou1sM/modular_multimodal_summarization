        "Marcie: All right, mister. Now, you know, if you weren't such a cranky pants before, I could have taken you to your very first wedding. Yes! Oh, it would have been a really nice way for mommy and daddy to celebrate their six-month anniversary. Because, you know, we really haven't had time to -- well, you know what? I think I'll let your daddy handle that conversation when you get a little older. All right, my little love bug, it's time for you to go to bed. Nighty-night. All right, sleep tight, baby. Nighty-night. Yes, I'll see you later. Yes, I will. [Marcie giggles] Who's that? Shh, Michael. I'm trying to get him to sleep.",
        "Michael: Oh. Sorry.",
        "Marcie: That's ok. It's about time you got home. So, how was today?",
        "Michael: Oh, today was awful, long. Had me in the ER all day. I'm going to sleep now.",
        "Marcie: Mike? Mike? Happy anniversary.",

        "[\"Wedding march\" plays]",
        "Nash: What are you going to do when you're walking down the aisle, and Antonio is standing there at the altar, and I'm standing right beside him?",
        "Jessica: I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cole: I wasn't sure you were going to make it.",
        "Starr: I told you I would, didn't I?",
        "Cole: Well, people say lots of things.",
        "Starr: Good luck.",
        "Cole: Thanks. I'm going to need it.",
        "Starr: Not from what I heard. You're the star of the team.",
        "Cole: You're buying into that? Huh. I'm just some chump in a jersey.",
        "Starr: The fastest chump.",
        "Cole: Well, maybe. But I keep having this dream. It's like two seconds to go, we're down by five. We're on the 50-yard line. I run a fade. That's like straight down the field. So I beat my man. I'm running. I'm way past him, right?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Cole: Malcolm -- he throws the ball. Perfect spiral right into my hands.",
        "Starr: And?",
        "Cole: I drop it.",
        "Starr: I'm sure that won't happen. You're going to be great. You're going to catch it. I'm sure you have really good hands. No, I mean -- I didn't mean --",
        "Cole: No, no, I'll take it as a compliment.",
        "Starr: Ok.",
        "Cole: I mean, a football compliment.",
        "Starr: I'm sure --",
        "Cole: Because -- I mean, because you have to have good hands when you're a quarterback.",
        "Starr: Right. I'm sure you'll do great.",
        "Cole: Well, I'd better because the coach is putting the pressure on me, and so is everybody else.",
        "Starr: What? You can tell me. Who am I to judge, considering?",
        "Cole: I don't want you to think I'm a jerk.",
        "Gabe: Hey, dude. Let's get suited up, all right?",
        "Starr: You're not going to drop the ball. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: Did you see Cole?",
        "Britney: Of course. In fact, I'm supposed to meet him in the locker room. You know, for a little pregame tension relief.",
        "Girl: You are?",
        "Second girl: Yeah, right.",
        "Britney: It's true. In fact, he's expecting me right now.",
        "Girl: Yeah? Then let's see you go in there.",

        "Boy: Whoo! Come on, lions! Let's kick some titan butt!",
        "Second boy: Let's have a fight, yeah!",
        "Coach: Huddle up. This is it. We've had a great season. But we might as well flush it all down the dumper if we don't beat these guys. So pull it together and get your gear on!",
        "Boys: Yeah!",
        "Coach: How you feeling?",
        "Cole: Fine.",
        "Coach: Good. Because the game's on your shoulders now, son. We can pick their secondary apart, but you're going to have to have the game of your life.",
        "Cole: Right.",
        "Coach: Speed and power, right?",

        "Cole: Because I practice and work out.",
        "Gabe: Yeah, and use steroids.",
        "Cole: Yeah, ok, right. I don't want to use them anymore. You know, I don't want to be winning games just because I'm using more drugs than the other guy.",
        "Gabe: Cole, my friend, you've got the goods, all right? You're strong and you're fast, but if you want to take this thing to the next level, you have to grab advantage of everything you can. I mean, you don't think that every guy out there playing d-1 football isn't looking for an edge?",
        "Britney: Cole -- Gabe, sweetie, do you think you could leave me and Cole alone for a minute? I -- I need to give him a little present.",
        "Cole: I need to be by myself, Britney. By myself, not with you.",
        "Britney: But -- oh, but, Cole, honey --",
        "Cole: What do you want?",
        "Britney: Well, you know, I just thought you must get really tight and nervous before a big game. I just wanted to help you relax.",

        "Michael: Burrito. Had one on the way home.",
        "Marcie: I can't believe you had a burrito, Michael. I cooked dinner.",

Into this holy estate, these two now come to be joined. If there is any among you who know just cause why they may not be lawfully married, speak now, or else forever hold your peace.",

        "Starr: I heard her talking to the cheer squad, and she said that he invited her in for some extra game activities, and then she went right in there.",
        "Langston: \"Activity\" as in \"nasty activity\"?",
        "Starr: I don't think he meant pushups. They're doing it.",
        "Langston: Come on, Starr. Britney is a lying be-atch.",
        "Starr: But she went right in there. And when I was talking to him before, he said that he had to tell me something. Maybe that's it. Maybe he wanted to tell me that he was going to go do activities.",

        "Cole: I'm fine. And you're not supposed to be in here.",
        "Britney: Maybe you misunderstood me. Any guy on this team would jump at the chance to be with me. Come on, Cole, no strings attached. Just you, me, maybe the equipment room.",

And it's part me and part Tess, and I would be lying if I didn't say that it was a jumble of emotions right now. But I have to figure out some sort of way to find it peace and happiness. I know that this must be very difficult for you, standing up and being a part of this. But you're doing it for your daughter, and it is such an amazing act of love and bravery. And I really thank you for that. And I know how much this pains you. But I have to listen to my new heart. And it's telling me to marry Antonio. He's the man that I love. He's the man that I choose. It's the life that I want. It's the life that I choose. This is who I am. It's not going to change.",

        "Marcie: It's -- it's a remote-control key finder. You know, because you're always losing your keys all the time, and I know it's not as good as rubies, but I --",
        "Michael: It's -- it's perfect. But you know, I can always get new keys. But there is one thing on earth that I never want to lose again. That's you.",

        "Todd: Oh, Evangeline?",
        "Blair: Yeah. You know, here, together, at a wedding. I -- I freaked. I freaked, and I am petty, I am jealous, and I'm an idiot. Yeah, that's me. Especially when it comes to you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, you are. But, you know, I can be all those things, too, when it comes to you.",

        "Jessica: We just had some unfinished business. And it's -- it's ok now. We understand each other, and that's important. And I want to be your wife. I don't want to wait another second.",
        "Antonio: Come on. Ok. We're ready.",
        "Andrew: Now I'd like to ask Viki and Carlotta to come up for the lighting of the unity candle.",
        "David: The unity candle? What do they light that with, the fidelity torch?",
        "Andrew: Jessica and Antonio, but also the coming together of two families. The Buchanans and the Vegas.",
        "Andrew: Antonio and Jessica have chosen to write their own vows, which they will now exchange. I love baseball so much.",
        "Jessica: There were times when I thought this day would never come. And I know I've put you through a lot over the past few years. Most guys would've given up on me a long time ago. But you're not like most guys. You have this inner strength and when you look at me in my eyes and you tell me everything's going to be ok, I believe you. For most of my life, I have been incomplete. I've been half a person. And you loved me anyway, despite all of my missing pieces. And I know that I would not be standing here today if it weren't for you. You believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. And you had faith in me when I didn't have faith in myself. And when I didn't have any strength, you gave me yours. And when I tested you -- which I did, a lot -- you gave me understanding and you keep on doing that every day. I know as a whole person, I'm going to love you for the rest of my life, and I can hardly wait to be your wife.",
        "Antonio: So much for inner strength.",

        "Coach: What are you doing in here? You're not supposed to be in here -- do you understand me? You're supposed to be getting everyone fired up for the game, not hanging around my locker room distracting my players. Now get out there.",
        "Gabe: So? What happened with Britney?",
        "Cole: She wanted to give me something before the game.",
        "Gabe: You mean lik-- damn. I don't think it's a good idea. I mean, I heard about fighters who don't have sex for, like, weeks because it makes their legs wobbly when they fight.",
        "Cole: It's not about wobbly legs.",
        "Gabe: Yeah, I -- I knew that.",
        "Cole: You know, Britney has issues.",
        "Gabe: I know. But, I mean, free sex -- come on. Even if you don't take it, it's nothing to be depressed about. What's eating you, man?",
        "Cole: I blew up at her, man. I -- I couldn't even control myself. I just frickin' lost it. Here.",
        "Gabe: No, keep them.",
        "Cole: I don't want them anymore. You know what? I'll just work harder for the edge that you said I need.",
        "Gabe: No. Look, you keep them. Maybe you'll change your mind, ok? Whatever. Now, look, get suited up. We got a game to win here, all right? Come on.",
