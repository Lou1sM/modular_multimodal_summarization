        "\"Get Natalie!\" John shouts that while someone is in his room. Vincent goes to Natalie at the church and they talk about Hugh. She gets angry that Vincent goes on about his friend getting better when her boyfriend is dead. \"What does he have to do with me anyway?\" Vincent tells that if what he is thinking is true, then a lot of people will be affected. He didn't come to see her. He came to be in the church. He has fond peaceful memories of being in church from his childhood. Natalie doesn't know if she believes in miracles. \"John wouldn't believe in anything that he could see with his own two eyes.\" This gives Vincent an idea and he rushes out. Jessica thanks Nash for letting things go smoothly. He says that he is surprised. She keeps talking about how Tess is alive inside her, but he knows that Tess wouldn't run away and hide from things. Jessica goes running to Antonio to tell him how much she loves him and all that, but she doesn't get to finish cause Cristian makes a toast to the bride and the groom. After he is finished Nash wants to make a toast. The color drains from Jessica's face. All that Nash says is that he wishes happiness, and thanks for the inclusion in the wedding. Clint knew that he was a good man and always tells people that. Todd returns to the wedding alone and spends time with Cristian and Evangeline. \"You wanna dance?\" And off he goes with Evangeline holding his arm, leaving Cris to stew. When the bouquet is thrown Evangeline catches it. When the garter is thrown, Todd catches it. Natalie has a miracle when John appears to her in the church and wants to marry her. She is magically transformed into and bride and he waits for her to walk the aisle to him so they can marry but her mother calls and interrupts the whole fantasy. Jessica goes outside and Nash is there alone. He seems to get it now that he has seen her marry, that his fantasy won't happen. \"Does Antonio know you are out here?\" She answers flippantly. \"I'm still here aren't I?\" Inside, Antonio is nearby the door and hears everything. He seems disturbed by what he hears. \"I heard that you were starting a lingerie line!\" Adriana just looks at her mother and walks off. David is pleased with Dorian. She got to dance with Clint and has made progress. \"One step at a time.\" Vincent returns to the hospital to visit the man who he know now isn't his friend. \"I know that you are not Hugh. I have to find out who you are. If you have to get something out, I am it! Tell me!\" The man's eyes open, and his mouth starts to move. \"I I am John!\" Vincent's face freezes as he takes the news in."

        "Vincent: This crazy idea -- what? I'm not doing anything.",
        "Natalie: Hugh was in the same accident that John was in. Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to hear how wonderful Hugh is doing, knowing that John didn't have that same chance?",
        "Vincent: I'm not trying to hurt you.",
        "Natalie: Oh, aren't you? I mean, I kissed you up on the rooftop because I was completely out of my mind. You told me about Cristian and I wasn't understanding, so what perfect way to get even with me by telling me about your old friend Hugh and how much progress he's making?",

        "Natalie: So what are you saying, you're religious now?",
        "Vincent: No. My mama -- she used to go to church every Sunday. And I would go with her, every week up until the day she died. Hmm. Now, her church -- her church was not even nearly as fancy as this one, but it was nice and peaceful. Maybe that's what I'm looking for -- peace.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, that's what I've been looking for -- peace, up on the rooftop with John. I don't know when I'm going to get it through my thick skull that miracles just don't happen.",

        "Kelly: Oh.",
        "Kevin: And now, we can raise this baby together.",
        "Kelly: But not here, not in Llanview. There's so much history, the wounds being opened up every day.",
        "Kevin: Well, it's -- it's kind of incredible that you should say that right now.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Seems like you don't have a whole lot of faith in faith.",
        "Natalie: John died the night before we were going to start our new life together. So if that's part of some grand plan, I'm sorry. That sucks.",
        "Vincent: You know, I'm not religious. But I don't even think that God would be that cruel.",
        "Natalie: I don't. All I know is I'm going to stick with the cold, hard facts because that's what John did. He didn't believe in anything that he couldn't see with his own two eyes.",
        "Vincent: Huh. You know, he's right. Thank you.",
        "Natalie: For what?",
        "Vincent: For helping me find the answers that I came here looking for.",

        "Evangeline: Really? That's strange.",
        "Paige: Why?",
        "Evangeline: Well, I was visiting him at the hospital the other day with his friend Vincent Jones and he was trying really hard to move and to say something.",
        "Paige: That's a good sign. It doesn't happen much when I'm around.",
        "Bo: Hugh is friends with Vincent Jones?",
        "Evangeline: I know -- it's strange, but they went to college together.",
        "Paige: Hmm.",
        "Evangeline: Anyway, I hope I didn't upset you by bringing it up.",

        "Paige: Well, he's been to see Hugh a lot. I think they're really good friends.",

        "Nash: I'm never sure what you're capable of.",
        "Jessica: Stop saying that. I married Antonio because I love him. It was the right thing to do.",
        "Nash: \"Right thing to do.\" If you say so.",

        "Jessica: You.",
        "Nash: Me?",
        "Jessica: Yesterday, you come to me and you say you're happy that I'm getting married. It's what you and Tess would've wanted. And today, you show up at my mother's house saying that marrying Antonio is a mistake. I'm beginning to believe that I'm not e only one with a split personality.",
        "Nash: Oh, that's good. Look, I said what I said last night because I didn't know what else to say, but you keep telling me that Tess is alive and well and running around in you, but Tess wouldn't run away from the truth, now, would she?",
        "Jessica: The truth?",
        "Nash: The truth.",
        "Jessica: Well, the truth is Antonio and I have been nothing but fair to you, and every time that we are, you undermine us. Another truth is that I have been protecting you from Antonio by not telling him the things that you've done and that ends today, pal.",
        "Singer: Someone that special someone",
        "Antonio: Yeah? Hey, baby. You look upset. What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: There's something that I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I hate this.",
        "Britney: And just as I'm about to make my move, I see Cole stash this little bag of pills into his locker like he was trying to hide something. I checked it after he left -- he's totally on drugs.",
        "Amber: Oh, my God. What are you going to do?",
        "Britney: Find Wexler and have her search his locker. I mean, can you say \"expelled?\"",
        "Amber: Right. But, like, isn't everyone going to be really mad when they find out you got the best player on the team expelled?",
        "Britney: Well, yeah, but --",
        "Amber: And don't you think Wexler is going to be suspicious if you just walk into her office and say, \"Cole has drugs in his locker\"? That kind of sounds like you planted them, doesn't it?",
        "Britney: Well, ok, so the plan has a couple of flaws, but there are other options.",
        "Langston: You excited about your date?",
        "Starr: What?",
        "Langston: All that \"stick around after the game\"? That's Cole asking you out.",
        "Starr: Really?",
        "Langston: You really like him, don't you?",
        "Starr: I keep trying to find something wrong with Cole, but I can't.",
        "Coach: Ok, guys, listen up. We're one touchdown up, but that's not much. And now the tins have been watching us for two quarters, so don't get cocky. Games like this are won in your head. And, Cole, you got away with that pass in the second quarter, but it won't happen again. The next time you try it, they'll be in their end zone spiking the ball.",
        "Gabe: Don't worry, coach. Cole will think of something.",
        "Coach: Cole's not a one-man team, Gabe. But play like you are, all right? All right. Let's get back on the field.",

        "Antonio: Today? Uh -- yeah, I think so.",
        "Jessica: And you know that I have been waiting for this day for so long, and when I was up there at the altar and I said \"I do,\" I meant it, right?",
        "Antonio: Yes, I know that. So what is it?",
        "Cristian: All right. Can I -- can I have your attention, please?",
        "Jessica: Oh.",

        "Cristian: Well, as you all know, I'm the best man of this wedding.",
        "Evangeline: Yes, you are.",
        "Cristian: And part of my job description is to give a speech, so here it goes. Antonio, it wasn't easy growing up with you as a brother. I mean, for one thing, I wish you would've been a little better-looking. Maybe more girls would've come around, you know? No, seriously -- please, don't laugh too hard. We've had our ups and downs. But if I could pick a man to be my hero, a man to be my friend, and a man to be my brother, they would all be you. I know you two have been through a lot to be together. But seeing you here today together, married and happy, is the most I could wish for. So here's to you, brother, and to you, Jessica, my brother's beautiful wife who now is my beautiful sister. To Antonio and Jessica.",

        "Kelly: I love London. I always have.",
        "Kevin: And the best thing is that we can raise Zane as our -- our son. You know? No one has to know how he came to be.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, but, Kevin, we know. And -- and that's not going to change. We're going to take that wherever we go. Are you ready for that, really? I mean, are you really ready to accept Zane as -- as Duke's son?",
        "Kevin: Well, I wasn't until I held him in there, you know? And then everything that happened before just kind of fell away. I mean, I couldn't love him more than if he were my own.",
        "Kelly: Would you be saying that if Duke were alive?",
        "Kevin: I don't know.",

        "Nash: Antonio, Jessica, and I -- Jessica and I -- we have a beautiful baby girl together. And I am just so happy that my baby girl is going to grow up in a house so chock-full of love. Because, you see, Jessica is not just a beautiful, sweet girl. But she's a great person. And I wish her all the happiness in the world. So I'd like to thank you both for including me in this day, and wish you both all the happiness in the world. Thank you. Uh-oh.",
        "Clint: Nice speech.",
        "Nash: Yeah, thanks.",
        "Clint: You had me worried there for a minute, especially since you and Jessica were both late for the wedding.",
        "Nash: Well, it all worked out in the end, didn't it?",
        "Clint: Yeah. I don't know what went on between you and Jessie, but in your speech, you were right. She deserves to be happy. Nash, I keep telling people that you're a good man. Thank you for not making a liar out of me.",
        "Antonio: Well, that was decent of Nash, wasn't it?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm. [Jessica sighs]",
        "Antonio: Was -- was that what you wanted to tell me? That he was going to give a toast?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evangeline: That could have been tense.",
        "Todd: Let me ask you something, Cristian. When Antonio invited Tess' ex- boyfriend to his wedding with Jessica, what was he on?",
        "Cristian: My brother's not afraid of Nash. He and Jess are in love. And when two people love each other the way they do, there's nothing a third person can do to come between them.",
        "Todd: Is that right? Put that theory to the test. Hey, good-looking, would you like to dance?",

        "Viki: Hi, darling.",
        "Jessica: Hi, mom. Sorry -- my feet are starting to hurt.",
        "Viki: I can imagine. Are you having a wonderful day?",
        "Jessica: I am. I'm just -- I'm worried about Natalie. I mean, she stayed behind at the church, and she should have been here by now.",
        "Viki: You know, honey, I think she probably needed some time to think about John and the wedding that they will never have.",
        "Jessica: I knew this day would be hard on her.",
        "Viki: Yeah, but she's getting through it all in her own way. And by tomorrow morning, she'll be that little bit stronger than she was this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John's voice: So we going to do this or not?",
        "Natalie: John, you're --",
        "John: Right here. What are you waiting for?",
        "Natalie: I never thought I'd see you again.",
        "John: There's something I want to say to you, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: John, well, what is it? What are you trying to say?",
        "Man: I love --",
        "Nurse: Enough with the talking. You rest.",
        "Vincent: Yeah. Sorry. Here to see my friend.",
        "Nurse: Don't wake him up.",
        "Vincent: Ok. Something is not making any sense. Now, I know you're hurt bad. But you are not you. Either you act like you don't know me, or you act like you hate my guts. And I tried to tell myself how I would react if I was burned as bad as you. But then that nurse said something about you having blue eyes. And I went around and I checked. Hugh has brown eyes. And I can't go around tearing people's lives upside down on something that I think. I need to know. I have to know. Oh, man. It's the truth. You're not Hugh Hughes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Girl: All right! Yeah!",
        "Coach: Well, there's going to be some titans with their tails between their legs on that bus tonight.",
        "[Cheers]",
        "Coach: And also tonight, Cole broke Llanview high's record for the most touchdowns scored by an individual in a single game. Well, I hope you're all hungry, because I'm buying the pizza. Hit the showers, guys. Come on, let's go.",
        "Boy: Good job, huh? Way to go. Great.",
        "Cole: Hi.",
        "Starr: Hi -- um -- so, running the funny-shaped ball to the big h -- that's a good thing, right?",
        "Cole: See? Football's easy.",
        "Starr: You make it look easy.",
        "Cole: I'm glad you were here.",
        "Britney: Aw, Starr looks so happy.",
        "Amber: We hate that, right?",
        "Britney: It won't last long. Not after I go to the coach and sadly tell him that I think my friend Cole is on drugs. They'll have to test him just to prove I'm wrong. He'll be expelled and kicked off the team, and Starr will be humiliated -- again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: John, I think this is the one time where you're going to have to talk.",
        "John: Well, I'm not one for big speeches.",
        "Natalie: I know. And it's ok.",
        "John: So I think I'll just stick to the basics. Natalie, I --",

        "Viki: Sweetheart, where are you?",
        "Natalie: I was just -- I was just trying to do something I never got the chance to do. But I guess I'm going to have to let go of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Ok. If you're not Hugh, then Hugh is -- oh, my God -- oh, jeez. What am I going to do? The first thing I need to know is who the hell you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paige: You're such a wonderful dancer.",
        "Bo: Why, thank you.",

        "Bo: Thank me?",
        "Paige: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bo: For what?",
        "Paige: Well, for listening and worrying about me, and buying me steaks and burgers. Thanks.",
        "Bo: Well, honey, that's what a guy does when he's crazy about a lady.",
        "Paige: I can't believe you're giving me another chance.",
        "Bo: Believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Hi, Mom.",
        "Viki: Oh, sweetheart. You ok?",

        "Rex: I put out some feelers about Spencer and the dead lawyer and your missing kid. Somebody called me and claimed they had information.",
        "Todd: Well, what did that somebody say?",
        "Rex: I don't know yet. We're still playing phone tag. But when I know, you'll know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Could I have everyone's attention? Single ladies, gather around.",

        "Evangeline: No.",
        "Cristian: Porque no?",
        "Evangeline: Porque mi pongo nerviosa.",
        "Cristian: Nerviosa, eh?",
        "Evangeline: Si.",
        "Cristian: Well, that's too bad, because, you see, I have this bet down with my brother that you were going to catch the bouquet. But I guess I'm going to lose the money.",
        "Evangeline: How much money?",
        "Cristian: Cinquenta dolares.",
        "Evangeline: Alli estoy.",

        "Dorian: Wait a minute -- I'd like to try. Excuse me.",
        "Viki: It's a nice idea, but I don't really think I'm up to catching a bouquet. Sleeves are too tight.",
        "Jessica: Ready? One, two, three.",
        "Antonio: All right, gentlemen. Gather around. It's the guys' turn.",
        "Clint: Right.",
        "Antonio: Ahem.",
        "Woman: Whoa.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I'm sorry, I misunderstood.",
        "Kelly: Kevin, I want to go to London with you. I think it sounds wonderful, but you have been so angry at -- at me and at Duke for what we did. And I just have to know that that is in the past before I do something as radical as moving to another country with you.",
        "Kevin: I'm just saying that if Duke were alive, I don't know what any of us would be doing right now. Look, the most important thing is that we're a family.",
        "Kelly: I don't know what to say.",
        "Kevin: Say yes.",
        "Kelly: Ok. Yes. Yes.",

        "Starr: Then this was my first.",
        "Cole: Oh. Well, my dad and I started watching the Eagles games when I was 4, and then he started throwing passes to me when I was 6.",

        "Cole: Yeah. Well, it was.",
        "Amber: Do you think you should just forget about them?",
        "Britney: Amber, thinking like that is what gives you the D-plus average. Tomorrow, they'll get what's coming to them. Go, me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cristian: So, I guess you catching the garter means you and Blair are getting back together.",
        "Todd: No, not a chance.",
        "Evangeline: But you did catch the garter.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I did. And you caught the bouquet. See ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adriana: Are you all broken up that I didn't catch the bouquet?",
        "Rex: Are you?",
        "Adriana: I have a lot to do before I can even think about getting married.",
        "Rex: Your company's going to happen.",
        "Adriana: Lots of things are going to happen.",

        "David: So, sorry about the bouquet.",

        "Dorian: Doesn't mean much. Hmm.",

        "Nash: Jessica --",
        "Jessica: Nash, I -- I just came out for some air in the middle of the dancing and stuff. But I didn't know you were out here, so --",
        "Nash: No. Hey, wait. I suppose we'd better talk about what happened, huh?",
        "Jessica: I thought we already did.",
        "Nash: When the minister asked if anybody had any objections, I really, really wanted to say that I did.",
        "Jessica: Well, thank God you didn't.",
        "Nash: Yeah. I figured that I probably could stop this wedding. But I could not stop you from loving Antonio. I meant what I said in the toast. I want you to be very, very happy. And I came by to talk to you before you got married because -- well, I had to take one more crack at trying to convince you that it was too soon after integration to get married. It didn't work. You got married. You're a married lady, so that's that.",
        "Jessica: Good.",
        "Nash: Does Antonio know?",
        "Jessica: Well, you're still standing, aren't you?",
        "Nash: Yeah. Well, I won't tell him, either. So I guess he'll never know, huh?",

        "Natalie: Thank you.",
        "Clint: For what?",
        "Natalie: For not asking me how I'm doing.",
        "Clint: You know, people mean well.",
        "Natalie: I know. I just think that mom and Jessica were right. This day is really tough for me. I was watching the wedding, and I couldn't help imagine what it would be like marrying John. I mean, even as I sat in the church, I -- I pictured how it would be.",
        "Clint: And what would it be like?",
        "Natalie: Like everything in my dreams. But it's like John -- it's like he's trying to tell me something, but he never has the chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vincent: Look, man, it may be hard for you to talk. Or maybe you don't want to talk to me. But here's the deal. If you want to get the word out, I'm all you got.",
