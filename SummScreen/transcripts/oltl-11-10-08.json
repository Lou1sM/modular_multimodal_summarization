    "Recap": [
        "Todd informs Dr. Joplin and Nurse Janet that he won't go through with his plan after all. He is ok with letting them give Starr's baby to Marcie. They announce to Starr, Blair and Marcie that the baby will be fine. Marcie names her Hope. Everything is going to be good for everybody. Except, unknown to everybody, Jessica's new alter, Bess, has snuck into the hospital with her dead baby and \"swapped\" her for Starr's which she takes home with her. John finds Marty while Todd is out. But she believes only what Todd has told her about him; that John is the enemy and Todd is her hero. At that point John tells Marty that it was Todd who raped her. Viki and Charlie successfully remove the bomb and unlock the door to let Natalie and Jared out. But they all wonder what has happened to \"Tess\" knowing that she has probably already had her baby."

        "Natalie: There's only 10 minutes left.",
        "Jared: You two have to get out of here now.",
        "Viki: No, we're staying.",
        "Charlie: Look, Tina has called 911. The bomb squad will be here before you know it.",
        "Natalie: You don't know if they're going to make it here in time.",
        "Jared: And even if they do, they still have to defuse it.",
        "Viki: If you stay, we're staying.",
        "Natalie: Mom, no. Please, you guys have both got to get out of here, or Tess is going to kill us all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: I don't believe in coincidences. Other people do. They're frightened by them. They need an explanation. Tess would read her horoscope. Jessica would say everything happens for a reason. But I know better. It's simple math. For every negative, there is a positive. That's the problem I have to solve. It's a simple, mathematical equation. I'm going to turn a negative into a positive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: Wait a minute, Marcie, you called Todd?",
        "Marcie: No, I talked to Todd. I ran into him in the hallway, and he wanted to know about Starr.",
        "Blair: How did he even know that she was here?",
        "Marcie: I don't know, maybe the hospital called him.",
        "Blair: I bet you that he has spies all over this place, watching your every move.",
        "Marcie: No, I don't think that was it. He didn't know anything about the baby. I was the one who told him that it was a girl. Which -- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Blair: Okay. But if he wants more information, he's going to have to get it 100 yards away from here.",
        "Starr: Mom.",
        "Blair: No, I don't want him anywhere near you, Starr.",
        "Starr: Mom, I'm the one that called him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Forget what I said about the baby. I'm not going to do it.",
        "Joplin: I just told your daughter there's something wrong with her.",
        "Todd: Oh, but there isn't, right?",
        "Joplin: No, I was just following your orders.",
        "Todd: Right. I mean, it's got 10 fingers and 10 toes and all that?",
        "Joplin: Yes, the baby's fine. You have a perfectly healthy granddaughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, do you miss your mother, you little sweetheart? Yeah, of course you do. And she loves you very much. But, you know, so will your new mother and your new father. They -- well, you know, they love you already. And they haven't even met you yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Starr had a daughter.",
        "Joplin: Yes, I thought you knew that.",
        "Todd: Yeah, I do. It's just sinking in now. What's she look like?",
        "Joplin: Probably the way Starr did when she was born.",
        "Todd: Yeah? I wasn't there when Starr was born.",
        "Joplin: Let me understand this. You're not going to take the baby?",
        "Todd: No, I'm not that man anymore. Someone told me I don't have to be.",
        "Joplin: And you don't want me to say the baby died?",
        "Todd: No, I want you to give the baby to Marcie McBain, like Starr wants.",
        "Joplin: So you're not going to do any of the things we talked about?",
        "Todd: No, changed my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: Just go to sleep. When you wake up, Todd will be home.",
        "John: Marty.",
        "John: You're alive.",
        "Marty: How did you know?",
        "John: I didn't for a long time.",
        "Marty: How did you find me?",
        "John: It wasn't easy.",
        "Marty: Todd said you'd never find me.",
        "John: Where is he?",
        "Marty: He'll be right back.",
        "John: Then we should go.",
        "Bodyguard: I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You called your dad?",
        "Starr: Yeah.",
        "Blair: Sweetie, why didn't you tell me?",
        "Starr: Are you kidding?",
        "Blair: You've got a point.",
        "Starr: It was this morning. I was in labor and I was really scared and Dad is always there when big things happen with me.",
        "Blair: So what'd he say?",
        "Starr: He said that he loves me and misses me and for me to take as many drugs as I can get my hands on.",
        "Blair: Well, that's Todd. Did you ask him to come here?",
        "Starr: I should have figured that he would. I'm sorry.",
        "Blair: Don't apologize for loving your daddy, okay?",
        "Starr: Well, do you think that it was stupid of me, Mom?",
        "Blair: No, I don't think it was stupid, I just think it was stupid for me to think that he would change.",
        "Starr: He hasn't been bothering us, Mom.",
        "Blair: Look, he talked to Marcie.",
        "Starr: And he stayed in the hallway. He has yet to come in here, right? That's got to mean something.",
        "Blair: As long as he stays out in the hallway. Starr, we have enough to worry about right now, you know, with the baby.",
        "Marcie: I kind of told him about that. And I really -- I don't know why I did it.",
        "Blair: Marcie, it's all right, you were worried.",
        "Marcie: He made me feel better and he told me that everything was going to be okay.",
        "Blair: Todd was nice to you?",
        "Marcie: Yeah, he was. I guess babies are miracles.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Because it's going to take a miracle for Todd to change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joplin: May I ask what changed your mind?",
        "Todd: No.",
        "Joplin: Yeah. Well, whatever it is, I'm relieved. The sooner we tell everyone the truth, the better.",
        "Todd: Was Starr upset?",
        "Joplin: A little bit.",
        "Todd: What'd you say to her?",
        "Joplin: Mr. Manning --",
        "Todd: What'd you say to her?",
        "Joplin: I told her what you told me to say, that there was something wrong with the baby, and I had to take her to NICU.",
        "Todd: That's it? No, that's nothing. For a second, you had me worried there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: Why can't everything be as simple as math? So clean. \"A\" squared plus B squared equals C squared. Same answer every time. No emotions to get in the way. When you have emotions, you make mistakes. Like Todd. He made the mistake of letting Tess know what he was doing with his daughter's baby. And doctors. They make mistakes. They pretend not to, but they do. And Victoria. She trusted Jessica when she shouldn't have. But I can't fix all of those things. And Victoria's so emotional, she can't fix them either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: Look, there's got to be a way to open this door. Can you use the crowbar or something?",
        "Charlie: No, the shock might set off the bomb.",
        "Jared: Dad, just go and get Viki out of here.",
        "Charlie: Look, we told you we're staying.",
        "Jared: That's stupid!",
        "Charlie: No, stupid would be me spending all those years looking for you just to lose you now.",
        "Viki: What if you overrode the system? Can you short-circuit it or something?",
        "Charlie: No, I just don't think that setting off sparks down here right now would be a good idea.",
        "Viki: There's got to be something that we can do.",
        "Natalie: Mom, there is. There is, okay? You can go find Jess. You can go find Jess because she really needs your help so much right now and just tell her I love her, okay? Just tell her that I always loved her.",
        "Viki: Stop it, stop it.",
        "Natalie: Tell Bee and Nate -- tell them that I loved being their aunt. I love them, and I am so sorry I can't watch them grow up. I'm sorry.",
        "Jared: No, it is okay.",
        "Viki: No, it is not okay.",
        "Jared: Just go, there's nothing you can do, okay?",
        "Charlie: The hell there isn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Bodyguard: My job.",
        "[Marty screams]",
        "John: You okay? Yeah?",
        "Marty: Yeah.",
        "John: Let's go. Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: We have to get rid of that bomb.",
        "Viki: Well, you can't defuse it, Charlie, it's too dangerous.",
        "Charlie: I know, I didn't say defuse it, I said get rid of it.",
        "Viki: Well, that's crazy.",
        "Charlie: Well, you got a better idea?",
        "Viki: It's a live explosive.",
        "Charlie: I know. And that's exactly why you're getting out of here.",
        "Viki: No, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Charlie: Come on, Viki. What about those people that Natalie was talking about? They depend on you. Are you just going to leave them to fend for themselves? I mean, I'm not kidding, Viki.",
        "Viki: Neither am I. What do we do now?",
        "Charlie: Take this drawer out.",
        "Jared: Okay, be careful, okay?",
        "Charlie: I will.",
        "Jared: Okay.",
        "Natalie: Mom?",
        "Viki: What, honey, what?",
        "Natalie: I just want you to know how much I love you.",
        "Viki: I love you, too.",
        "Natalie: And I just -- I want to say I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.",
        "Viki: Oh, Natalie, no. I'm the one that should apologize, baby.",
        "Charlie: Slowly, slowly. Very slowly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I have a little girl. And she misses me. But I believe everything in this world happens for a reason. I have to believe that. And I know this is the right thing to do. And you are going to be the luckiest little girl, I promise. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bess: Girl? Perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: You know, the nurse said that you could have something to eat. So, are you hungry?",
        "Starr: I'm not hungry at all.",
        "Blair: What about you, Marcie?",
        "Marcie: Oh, no. No, I'm not hungry either, and I think that's the first time in my life I've ever said that. Do you think they would let us know if she got worse? What am I saying? Of course they would.",
        "Starr: Marcie.",
        "Marcie: Yeah.",
        "Starr: What have you been thinking of naming the baby?",
        "Marcie: Oh. Well, I did have a name, but I don't know about it now.",
        "Starr: Why?",
        "Marcie: Well, because, what if the baby hates the name?",
        "Blair: Oh, Marcie.",
        "Starr: Why would the baby hate the name?",
        "Marcie: Well, I hated my name when I was growing up. I always wanted it to be something exotic. You know, like your name. Starr. How did you come up with it?",
        "Blair: Oh, I didn't. Todd did. He bought a gift while I was pregnant, and it was signed, \"Merry Christmas, my little star.\"",
        "Marcie: Oh, that's really sweet.",
        "Blair: Yeah. But this -- you were my real present.",
        "Marcie: That's how I feel, too.",
        "Starr: I just hope that she's going to be okay.",
        "Marcie: I think she will be. No, I know she will be.",
        "Blair: There you go.",
        "Marcie: She will be. After Sam, I didn't want to love anybody. Or anything. Because whenever I did, it was -- well, it was taken away from me. And you, you showed up at my doorstep and you didn't want to take anything from me. You wanted to give me something. You -- you want to give me your baby. The thing is, Starr, you gave me something more. You gave me something so much more. You gave me hope for my life. So, honey, that's what I'm going to call her. Hope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Where's Janet?",
        "Joplin: With the baby.",
        "Todd: I'm going to go see her.",
        "Joplin: Mr. Manning --",
        "Todd: Don't worry; I'm not going to try anything.",
        "Joplin: No, it's about my son.",
        "Todd: Oh, don't worry about that.",
        "Joplin: You're not going to turn him in?",
        "Todd: No, he's your problem, not mine.",
        "Joplin: Thank you.",
        "Todd: Oh, don't thank me. I'm not the one you should be thanking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: What are you doing?",
        "Marty: Protecting myself.",
        "John: That guy's gone.",
        "Marty: He'll be back, and so will Todd.",
        "John: Right, so we should --",
        "Marty: One step closer, and I'll shoot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, Mr. Manning. I didn't expect you.",
        "Todd: Yeah, we need to talk.",
        "Joplin: How's the baby?",
        "Janet: Oh, perfect.",
        "Joplin: I should probably go do another Apgar just to make sure.",
        "Todd: What's that?",
        "Joplin: It's a standard test for newborns. I'll be right back.",
        "Janet: Yes.",
        "Todd: What is it with doctors and their tests? It's like they expect something to go wrong.",
        "Janet: Well, you must remember all this from when your children were born.",
        "Todd: No, I don't.",
        "Janet: Well, she'll be fine. So you wanted to talk to me about something?",
        "Todd: Uh, yeah. The deal's off.",
        "Janet: Excuse me?",
        "Todd: I told Joplin to take the kid down to Marcie and Starr.",
        "Janet: Does this mean --",
        "Todd: I want you to try to return all the baby stuff we bought. See if you can get a refund.",
        "Janet: Is there something wrong with Marty?",
        "Todd: Like what?",
        "Janet: Well, you said you were going away together.",
        "Todd: Who said we're not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marty: I mean it. Don't come any closer.",
        "John: Why are you afraid of me?",
        "Marty: I'm not afraid of anyone anymore.",
        "John: Marty, it's me.",
        "Marty: I know who you are.",
        "John: So you put the damn gun down.",
        "Marty: I know who you are, and I know what you did.",
        "John: Marty.",
        "John: Okay, I get it. You mean it.",
        "Marty: You better believe it. Get over here.",
        "John: Marty --",
        "Marty: Over here! Now!",
        "John: Okay. All right. Take it easy.",
        "Marty: Put it under the bed. Put the gun under the bed. Do it.",
        "John: Okay. All right, all right. Take it easy. Here you go. I'm putting it down. Shh -- easy, easy. Why don't you just tell me what's going on here?",
        "Marty: Don't act so innocent. I know more than you think.",
        "John: I don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Marty: Todd told me everything.",
        "John: What did he tell you?",
        "Marty: He told me -- he told me that you took his wife, that you turned his kids against him, and you're trying to ruin his life.",
        "John: No. He's a liar. He's a liar, and you'll realize that the minute I get you out of here.",
        "Marty: Ah, I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "John: Marty, I'm here to help you.",
        "Marty: You're not here to help me. You're not. You're here to kill me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Uh, yeah. Marty and I are still planning on going away.",
        "Janet: Does she know you're not taking this baby?",
        "Todd: No, not yet.",
        "Janet: Well, what're you going to tell her?",
        "Todd: I'll tell her that Starr changed her mind. She's a kid. Kids change their minds.",
        "Janet: But do you think she's going to understand that?",
        "Todd: It's not like we can't have another one.",
        "Janet: I think she wanted this one.",
        "Todd: Janet, you know why I wasn't there when Starr was born? Because I was in Ireland. Actually, for Marty. Trying to make things up to her. And while I was there, I got shot in the back, and I spent the rest of that year recovering. My wife spent the rest of the year getting laid.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry.",
        "Todd: Well, my point is that I decided that I wasn't going to do anything for anyone else, because whenever you do, you're the one that ends up getting hurt.",
        "Joplin: 10 Apgar.",
        "Todd: What's that mean?",
        "Joplin: Well, that means I was right -- she's perfect.",
        "Todd: Okay, what're you waiting for? Take it down to Starr and Marcie.",
        "Joplin: Well, she thinks I brought the baby to NICU. I mean, it would take time for the baby to be released, even if she is healthy.",
        "Todd: So you just tell her that the baby's healthy, but it's going to be awhile before she can see her.",
        "Joplin: Right.",
        "Todd: Oh, hey! Hey! Make sure you tell Marcie, too.",
        "Janet: Well, I guess that could happen. I guess you and Marty could have your own children.",
        "Todd: Uh, I better get going. Seems a little suspicious, me hanging around her obstetrician's office.",
        "Janet: Oh. Oh, Mr. Manning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: I think Hope is a beautiful name.",
        "Marcie: Yeah? Well, my dad and my brother, Ron, they love it. But, my brother, Eric, he said that it was bad luck.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? He's probably just a worrier.",
        "Marcie: Do you think it was her lungs? You know, when I worked for Dr. Conklin, whenever a newborn -- whenever there was something wrong with them, it was usually their lungs.",
        "Blair: Well, they would say, probably.",
        "Starr: How do you know that?",
        "Blair: Well, that's just what doctors do. They always feel like they have to tell you everything that's wrong. It makes them feel like a big doctor. That's why it's called the practice of medicine.",
        "Marcie: You seem like you know a lot.",
        "Blair: Well, when Starr was born, she went right to ICU.",
        "Marcie: What? You and Todd must've been so worried.",
        "Blair: Well, Todd wasn't here. He was missing. We all thought he was dead.",
        "Marcie: And you had to go through all of that, all by yourself?",
        "Blair: Just like you and Starr.",
        "Marcie: Yeah, but for Starr to be sick like that.",
        "Blair: It was hard. It was tough. But, you know, look at her. She turned out pretty healthy. Just like your baby's going to.",
        "Starr: I really hope so.",
        "Blair: She will.",
        "Starr: Do you think Dad would want to see the baby?",
        "Blair: Well, he can't, sweetheart. We have the restraining order.",
        "Starr: But he came all this way, and --",
        "Blair: You want him to see the baby?",
        "Starr: I don't know, I just thought --",
        "Blair: You want me to lift the restraining order?",
        "Starr: He hasn't bothered us in a really long time.",
        "Blair: Well, you know what? I'll think about it. I'll think about it. Right now, I'm going to go check on your baby.",
        "Blair: Hey, how's Starr's baby?",
        "Joplin: I have good news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: What do you want?",
        "Janet: I have some questions for you.",
        "Todd: How many?",
        "Janet: First, would you like to see your granddaughter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: I'm not here to kill you. I'm here to help you.",
        "Marty: Help me? Like you helped me from that van? Left me to die after it went off the road?",
        "John: That's not what happened.",
        "Marty: What happened is that you left me there to die. So I wouldn't tell the authorities that you botched your case.",
        "John: What? Who told you that?",
        "Marty: Didn't think I knew that, did you?",
        "John: Marty, you're remembering this all backwards.",
        "Marty: You're not going to tell me what I know and what I don't know.",
        "John: Marty, you were in a bad accident. It happens.",
        "Marty: Mm-hmm, right. So you're going to tell me what I know? You're going to tell me what I should do? I should go anywhere with you?",
        "John: Listen, I don't know what you think, but you are not safe here. You're not safe in this house.",
        "Marty: Do I look like I need saving? You will not make me your victim again.",
